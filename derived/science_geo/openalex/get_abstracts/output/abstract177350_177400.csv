In this article we demonstrate that exposure of HCT116 human colon carcinoma cells to IGF-1 induces the expression of HIF-1α, the regulated subunit of hypoxia-inducible factor 1, a known transactivator of the VEGF gene. In contrast to hypoxia, which induces HIF-1α expression by inhibiting its ubiquitination and degradation, IGF-1 did not inhibit these processes, indicating an effect on HIF-1α protein synthesis. IGF-1 stimulation of HIF-1α protein and VEGF mRNA expression was inhibited by treating cells with inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and MAP kinase signaling pathways. These inhibitors also blocked the IGF-1- induced phosphorylation of the translational regulatory proteins 4E-BP1, p70 S6 kinase, and eIF-4E, thus providing a mechanism for the modulation of HIF-1α protein synthesis. Forced expression of a constitutively active form of the MAP kinase kinase, MEK2, was sufficient to induce HIF-1α protein and VEGF mRNA expression. Involvement of the MAP kinase pathway represents a novel mechanism for the induction of HIF-1α protein expression in human cancer cells."

Fibril formation is a complex nucleation-dependent polymerization process characterized in vitro by an initial lag phase. To a significant degree, this phase is a consequence of the energy barrier that must be overcome in order for Aβ monomers to fold and oligomerize into fibril nuclei. Here we show that low concentrations of 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) convert predominately unstructured Aβ monomers into partially ordered, quasistable conformers. Surprisingly, this results in a temporal decrease in the lag phase for fibril formation and a significant increase in the rate of fibril elongation. The TFE effect is concentration dependent and is maximal at ∼20% (v/v). In the presence of low concentrations of TFE, fibril formation is observed in Aβ samples at nanomolar concentration, well below the critical concentration for Aβ fibril formation in the absence of TFE. As the amount of TFE is increased above 20%, helix content progressively rises to ∼80%, a change paralleled first by a decrease in elongation rate and then by a complete cessation of fibril growth. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that a partially folded helix-containing conformer is an intermediate in Aβ fibril assembly. The requirement that Aβ partially folds in order to assemble into fibrils contrasts with the mechanism of amyloidogenesis of natively folded proteins such as transthyretin and lysozyme, in which partial unfolding is a prerequisite. Our results suggest that in vivo, factors that affect helix formation and stability will have significant effects on the kinetics of Aβ fibril formation.

Biol. 2000; 130: 88-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Though these proteins are non-homologous and have diverse native tertiary and quaternary structures, all polymerize into extended fibrils with diameters of ∼7–10 nm that are stained by amyloidophilic dyes such as Congo red and Thioflavin S. The dye-binding property of these assemblies is a result of the high β-sheet content within the fibrils (5Glenner G.G. Prog. Histochem. Cytochem. 1981; 13: 1-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). X-ray diffraction analysis has revealed a cross-β structure,i.e. the β-strands are oriented perpendicular to the fibril axis and stack into axially aligned extended β-sheets (6Kirschner D.A.

Biol. 1968; 32: 343-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The underlying mechanism of fibril formation for several of the amyloidogenic proteins, including lysozyme and transthyretin, involves a partial destabilization of the protein's native conformation through either mutations or environmental changes (8Booth D.R. Sunde M. Bellotti V. Robinson C.V. Hutchinson W.L. Fraser P.E. Hawkins P.N. Dobson C.M. Radford S.E. Blake C.C.F. Pepys M.B.

The resulting conformer is prone to aggregation, and its native-like secondary structure is converted to an extended β-sheet structure during this process. In addition, certain non-amyloidogenic proteins can form fibrils when partially denatured by incubation at acidic pH or in the presence of organic solvents (10Chiti F. Webster P. Taddei N. Clark A.

Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1350-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).In contrast to fibrillogenesis of natively folded proteins, amyloid β-protein (Aβ)1 fibril formation in vitro involves the conversion of an irregularly structured conformer into a highly stable, β-sheet-rich assembly (for review, see Ref. 13Teplow D.B. Amyloid: Int. J. Exp. Clin. Invest. 1998; 5: 121-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In vivo, the structure of the nascent Aβ monomer is unknown. Αβ is produced through successive endoproteolytic cleavage events adjacent to and within the transmembrane domain of the amyloid β-protein precursor (AβPP) (14Selkoe D.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 447-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). The structure of the extramembranous portion of the Aβ region of AβPP, comprising the N-terminal 28 amino acids of Aβ, has not been determined. The remaining 12–14 amino acids composing the C-terminal portion of Aβ may exist as a helix in AβPP; however, peptide bond hydrolysis involves helix disruption (15Kyte J. Structure in Protein Chemistry. Garland Publishing, New York, NY1995: 77Google Scholar). Both random coil (RC)→β-sheet and α-helix→β-sheet transitions thus could occur during Aβ folding and assembly.Recent in vitro studies of Aβ fibrillogenesis support the hypothesis that helix → strand transitions play a prominent role in the fibril assembly process. Walsh et al. (16Walsh D.M. Hartley D.M. Kusumoto Y. Fezoui Y. Condron M.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Selkoe D.J. Teplow D.B. J. Biol.

These studies suggested that fibrillogenesis involved the transient formation of a helix-containing intermediate (16Walsh D.M. Hartley D.M. Kusumoto Y. Fezoui Y. Condron M.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Selkoe D.J. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25945-25952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). In an extensive series of experiments examining the fibrillogenesis of 18 clinically relevant alloforms of Aβ, Kirkitadze et al. (18Kirkitadze M.D. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 1103-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) confirmed and extended these findings, observing in each case the formation of an oligomeric, helix-containing fibril intermediate. Interestingly, Kallberg et al. (19Kallberg Y. Gustafsson M. Persson B. Thyberg J. Johansson J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12945-12950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) have found that several amyloid-forming proteins contain α-helices in polypeptide segments, which are predicted, based on theoretical considerations, to form β-strands. Based on this finding, it was postulated that α-helix/β-strand discordant sequences predict which proteins have a propensity to form amyloid. Both the prion protein and Aβ display this discordance, in agreement with the theory. In addition, direct experimental study of a number of other discordant helix-containing proteins revealed for the first time that they could indeed form typical β-sheet-containing fibrils (19Kallberg Y. Gustafsson M. Persson B. Thyberg J. Johansson J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12945-12950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). A reasonable postulation, based on these and other data, is that stabilization of α-helical conformation could block fibril formation (19Kallberg Y. Gustafsson M. Persson B. Thyberg J. Johansson J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12945-12950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In fact, in the presence of high concentrations (>40%) of the co-solvent trifluoroethanol (TFE), both Aβ(1–40) and Aβ(1–42) are structured, exhibit predominantly α-helical conformations, and do not fibrillize (20Barrow C.J. Yasuda A. Kenny P.T.M. Zagorski M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 1075-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 21Coles M. Bicknell W. Watson A.A. Fairlie D.P. Craik D.J.

Biochem. 1995; 233: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Here, we took advantage of the ability of TFE to facilitate helix formation to examine in greater detail the effect of helix stabilization on Aβ assembly. This approach also has been used successfully to study the effect of helix stabilization on the folding of globular proteins (24Chiti F. Taddei N. Webster P. Hamada D. Fiaschi T. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 380-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, our results reveal that helix stabilization may facilitate as well as inhibit fibril formation, depending on its strength.DISCUSSIONIncreasing evidence suggests that a seminal event in the amyloidogenesis of most proteins and peptides is the partial unfolding of the native conformer (8Booth D.R. Sunde M. Bellotti V. Robinson C.V. Hutchinson W.L. Fraser P.E. Hawkins P.N. Dobson C.M. Radford S.E. Blake C.C.F. Pepys M.B. Nature. 1997; 385: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar, 9Kelly J.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 33Dobson C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 329-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1691) Google Scholar). This unfolding process produces molecules with increased propensities for fibril nucleation and for addition to pre-existent nuclei or fibrils. The structural destabilization leading to unfolding can be induced by a variety of environmental or genetic factors, including pH, oxidants, metals, and mutations in the cognate structural genes (34Kelly J.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Complete unfolding leads to amorphous aggregation and catabolic elimination of the misfolded protein. A very stable native fold precludes sufficient population of the amyloidogenic state and results in the absence of significant fibril nucleation and elongation.In contrast to studies of natively folded proteins, in vitrostudies of Aβ fibrillogenesis have suggested that fibril assembly involves a transition of the natively unfolded peptide monomer to a β-sheet−rich polymer (13Teplow D.B. Amyloid: Int. J. Exp. Clin. Invest. 1998; 5: 121-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Recently, careful examination of the conformational transitions associated with the formation of Aβ protofibrils (16Walsh D.M. Hartley D.M. Kusumoto Y. Fezoui Y. Condron M.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Selkoe D.J. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25945-25952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar) and fibrils (18Kirkitadze M.D. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 1103-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) have revealed that an α-helix-containing intermediate forms during the assembly process. The intermediate contains a significant amount (19–32%) of helix, but the intermediate forms from Aβ monomers containing little or none of this secondary structure element (18Kirkitadze M.D. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 1103-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Conversion of the intermediate into fibrils results in the loss of helical elements. Here, to better understand the role of helix formation in the earliest phases of Aβ folding and assembly, the behavior of LMW Aβ was studied in the presence of the helix-facilitating co-solvent TFE. At low concentrations (<20% v/v), rather than inhibiting fibrillogenesis, TFE significantly accelerated fibril assembly in a concentration-dependent manner. These data support the hypothesis that, in some cases, amyloid fibril formation by natively unfolded proteins requires the “partial folding” of the disordered monomer to form a discrete intermediate, which then undergoes additional conformational transitions in the process of fibril assembly. Recent studies of another natively unstructured peptide, α-synuclein, are also consistent with this mechanism (35Uversky V.N., Li, J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10737-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). This partial folding hypothesis is the mirror image of that invoked to explain the fibrillogenesis of natively folded proteins such as transthyretin (36Lai Z. Colon W. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6470-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) or lysozyme (8Booth D.R. Sunde M. Bellotti V. Robinson C.V. Hutchinson W.L. Fraser P.E. Hawkins P.N. Dobson C.M. Radford S.E. Blake C.C.F. Pepys M.B. Nature. 1997; 385: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar).TFE is a co-solvent known to destabilize hydrophobic interactions within polypeptide chains and to stabilize local hydrogen bonds between residues close in the amino acid sequence, particularly those forming α-helices and β-hairpins (37Buck M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 297-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Because hydrophobic interactions play an important role in Aβ fibril formation, we reasoned that TFE should weaken these interactions and thus decrease the rate of fibril formation. In addition, we expected that stabilization of α-helices would slow down or prevent fibril assembly. Surprisingly, although low concentrations of TFE did in fact stabilize α-helices in Aβ, the rate of fibril formation increased substantially relative to that observed in the absence of TFE. During fibril assembly, the expected increase in β-sheet level was mirrored by a proportionate decrease in α-helix level. Interestingly, the accelerating effect of TFE was not correlated linearly with its concentration, but exhibited a maximum at ∼20%. At higher concentrations, the rate of fibril formation decreased progressively, eventually reaching zero. In the presence of 20% TFE, a significant amount of helix existed in Aβ (54% in Aβ(1–40) and 45% in Aβ(1–42)), yet the rate of fibril formation was significantly faster than that observed in conformers displaying maximum random coil content (70% RC) or maximum helix content (80% helix). These results emphasize the importance of the partially helical conformer of Aβ in controlling the kinetics of fibril formation.An important question is why disordered Aβ monomers form fibrils at a significantly slower rate than when they exist as partially folded, helix-containing conformers. One explanation is that the disordered Aβ conformers are not able to associate to form the stable, oligomeric assemblies required to nucleate fibril formation. Rather, they form a diverse population of fibril-incompetent, unstable aggregates (38Otzen D.E. Kristensen O. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9907-9912Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, recent studies of the oligomerization state of LMW Aβ prior to fibril nucleation and growth have shown that the peptide exists in a rapid equilibrium involving monomers, dimers, trimers, and tetramers (26Bitan G. Lomakin A. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35176-35184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). It is likely that partial folding of the Aβ monomer is necessary to facilitate the correct intermolecular packing within Aβ oligomers. These packing interactions provide sufficient energy to overcome the entropic costs of the partial ordering of the Aβ monomer which takes place during this oligomerization. The helical components of these ordered assemblies would then convert into β-strands and β-turns coincident with nucleus or “seed” formation and then fibril formation. This mechanism is supported by recent studies of the fibrillogenesis of a model 38-residue helix-turn-helix peptide, αtα, which revealed that helix-rich oligomeric intermediates form prior to the appearance of β-sheet-rich fibrils (39Fezoui Y. Hartley D.M. Walsh D.M. Selkoe D.J. Osterhout J.J. Teplow D.B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1095-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).A consideration of basic aspects of protein folding leads to mechanistic interpretations similar to those above. For example, it has been suggested that efficient protein folding can be induced by restricting the conformational space associated with amyloid-incompetent conformers (33Dobson C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 329-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1691) Google Scholar). In doing so, the stochastic process by which the natively unfolded conformer searches conformational space as it folds and assembles is less likely to produce off-pathway conformers. Here, helix formation facilitates the organization of nascent disordered Aβ into a partially folded conformer, one that has a high probability of accessing later amyloid-competent conformational states. This results in the efficient movement of Aβ down the pathway of fibril formation and explains the fact that fibril formation is observed even in Aβ samples of nanomolar concentration, well below the critical concentration for Aβ fibril formation in the absence of TFE. It is important to emphasize that Aβ fibril formation may involve more than one pathway. Energy landscape models of protein folding can be exceptionally complex, but do include pathways for fast folding (40Chan H.S. Dill K.A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1998; 30: 2-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 41Baldwin R.L. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The helix-containing intermediate may be part of a fast folding pathway through which random coil Aβ may form fibrils more rapidly than through other pathways. Other, as yet unidentified, intermediates also may exist.Protein folding theory also predicts that if the partially folded intermediate is stabilized sufficiently, the activation barrier for its structural reorganization into the fibril will be large enough to stop fibril formation (24Chiti F. Taddei N. Webster P. Hamada D. Fiaschi T. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 380-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 42Dobson C.M. Sali A. Karplus M. Angew. Chem. 1998; 37: 868-893Crossref Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 43Dill K.A. Chan H.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar). Consistent with this prediction, the further stabilization of helical elements within Aβ obtained using high concentrations of TFE prevented fibril formation. Quantitative guanidine denaturation/renaturation experiments showed that the effects of TFE were associated with significant changes in helix stability. This finding is in agreement with results of fundamental studies of the mechanism of TFE-mediated helix induction in peptides (44Luo P.Z. Baldwin R.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8413-8421Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) and proteins (24Chiti F. Taddei N. Webster P. Hamada D. Fiaschi T. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 380-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In the latter work, low concentrations of TFE or hexafluoroisopropanol significantly increased the folding rate of the protein acylphosphatase and converted an apparent two-state folding process into a process characterized by the accumulation of partially structured species. However, at higher TFE concentration, the folding process was inhibited by the formation of additional non-native hydrogen bonds (24Chiti F. Taddei N. Webster P. Hamada D. Fiaschi T. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 380-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Here, in the Aβ case, low concentrations of TFE accelerated fibrillogenesis through stabilization of local helical structure. This suggests that at early stages in the peptide assembly process, local hydrogen bonding is very important. It is also important to note, as discussed previously, that high concentrations of TFE significantly weaken hydrophobic interactions (37Buck M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 297-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to its demonstrated effect on α-helix content and stability, the mechanism of inhibition of fibril formation at high TFE concentration could include destabilization of hydrophobic interactions.Our results lead to certain predictions about the behavior of Aβin vivo, where the structure of the nascent peptide is unknown. If the peptide is largely helical, which it may be because of its partial composition of the AβPP transmembrane domain, then significant relaxation of portions of the helix would be necessary for Aβ to fold into an amyloid-competent conformation. Alternatively, Aβ may be largely unstructured, as it is in vitro, because of the fact that it has no prosthetic groups or disulfide bonds to stabilize a folded conformation. Formation of the partially folded intermediate thus would be necessary for fibrillogenesis to occur. In either case, conditions facilitating the population of the partially folded state would be expected to accelerate fibrillogenesis and to allow the process to occur at lower nominal Aβ concentration.In vivo, Aβ(1–40) and Aβ(1–42) appear to be seminal players in the early stages of amyloid formation (13Teplow D.B. Amyloid: Int. J. Exp. Clin. Invest. 1998; 5: 121-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Our examination of the effects of TFE on the folding and assembly of these peptides revealed that each is affected in a qualitatively similar way. TFE facilitates helix formation and accelerates the fibrillogenesis of both peptides in a concentration-dependent manner in which maximal effects are observed at a TFE concentration of ∼20%. Where and how within the Aβ peptide might the initial coil → helix transition occur? Evidence suggests that the answer to the first question is the region of Aβ encompassing Lys16-Asp23. This octapeptide segment comprises amino acids with high helical propensities (45Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Fasman G.D. Prediction of Protein Structures and the Principles of Protein Conformation. Plenum Press, New York, NY1989: 1-98Google Scholar). Prior conformational studies of Aβ have shown that this region forms helices under the appropriate conditions (23Sticht H. Bayer P. Willbold D. Dames S. Hilbich C. Beyreuther K. Frank R.W. Rosch P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In addition, subtle changes in amino acid sequence (e.g. Val18→Ala) significantly facilitate nascent helix formation (46Soto C. Castaño E.M. Frangione B. Inestrosa N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3063-3067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), and recent studies have shown directly that helix destabilization in the Leu17-Val24 region leads to fibril formation (47Janek K. Rothemund S. Gast K. Beyermann M. Zipper J. Fabian H. Bienert M. Krause E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5457-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Finally, the central hydrophobic cluster of Aβ, Leu17-Ala21, which plays a critical role in organizing Aβ folding and fibril formation (48Zhang S.S. Casey N. Lee J.P. Folding Des. 1998; 3: 413-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 49Esler W.P. Stimson E.R. Ghilardi J.R., Lu, Y.A. Felix A.M. Vinters H.V. Mantyh P.W. Lee J.P.

Once formed, intermolecular interactions among partially folded, helix-containing Aβ monomers could lead to peptide oligomerization followed by conformational reorganization to form the extended β-sheets that compose the mature amyloid fibril. This process is consistent with data obtained in studies of the fibrillogenesis of Aβ alloforms associated with familial forms of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (18Kirkitadze M.D. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 1103-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) and has been shown to occur in the fibrillogenesis of the model peptide αtα (39Fezoui Y. Hartley D.M.

The process of structural organization of Aβ into a partially folded intermediate contrasts with the mechanism of amyloidogenesis of natively folded proteins in which partialunfolding is a prerequisite. These results suggest that factors that affect helix formation and stability in vivo,e.g. membranes and lipoproteins, will have a significant effect on the kinetics of Aβ fibril formation. For this reason, therapeutic strategies focusing on helix stabilization must be pursued with care. The amyloidoses are a group of disorders characterized by aberrant protein folding and assembly, leading to the deposition of insoluble protein fibrils, cell and organ dysfunction, and in many cases, death (1Sipe J.D.

Biol. 2000; 130: 88-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Though these proteins are non-homologous and have diverse native tertiary and quaternary structures, all polymerize into extended fibrils with diameters of ∼7–10 nm that are stained by amyloidophilic dyes such as Congo red and Thioflavin S. The dye-binding property of these assemblies is a result of the high β-sheet content within the fibrils (5Glenner G.G. Prog. Histochem. Cytochem. 1981; 13: 1-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). X-ray diffraction analysis has revealed a cross-β structure,i.e. the β-strands are oriented perpendicular to the fibril axis and stack into axially aligned extended β-sheets (6Kirschner D.A.

Depending on the cellular context, Ras activation may have different biological consequences: induction of cell proliferation, senescence, survival, or death. Augmentation and selective activation of particular effector molecules may underlie various Ras actions. In fact, Ras effector-loop mutants interacting with distinctive effectors provide evidence for such selectivity. Interactions of active Ras with escort proteins, such as galectin-1, could also direct Ras selectivity. Here we show that in comparison with Ras transfectants, H-Ras/galectin-1 or K-Ras4B/galectin-1 co-transfectants exhibit enhanced and prolonged epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated increases in Ras-GTP, Raf-1 activity, and active extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Galectin-1 antisense RNA inhibited these EGF responses. Conversely, Ras and galectin-1 co-transfection inhibited the EGF-stimulated increase in phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity. Galectin-1 transfection also inhibited Ras(G12V)-induced PI3K but not Raf-1 activity. Galectin-1 co-immunoprecipitated with Ras(G12V) or with Ras(G12V/T35S) that activate Raf-1 but not with Ras(G12V/Y40C) that activates PI3K. Thus, galectin-1 binds active Ras and diverts its signal to Raf-1 at the expense of PI3K. This demonstrates a novel mechanism controlling the duration and selectivity of the Ras signal. Ras gains selectivity when it is associated with galectin-1, mimicking the selectivity of Ras(T35S), which activates Raf-1 but not PI3K. Ras proteins activate diverse effector molecules.

Oncogene. 2000; 20: 7486-7493Crossref Scopus (339) Google Scholar), could also direct Ras selectivity. As noted above, Ras signal selectivity may produce different effects on different cells. We hypothesized that interactions of active Ras with escort proteins could direct selectivity of Ras signals. In a recent study, we found that galectin-1 is such an escort; it is associated with the constitutively active (GTP-bound) H-Ras(G12V) mutant (13Paz A. Haklai R. Elad G. Ballan E. Kloog Y. Oncogene. 2000; 20: 7486-7493Crossref Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Galectin-1 belongs to a family of β-galactoside-binding proteins, which act both within cells via sugar-independent interactions with other proteins and outside of cells via sugar-dependent interactions with glycan chains of cellular glycoconjugates after their secretion, which is independent of a classical signal sequence (14Barondes S.H.

Our own findings suggested that active Ras is a binding partner of galectin-1 and that this partnership is required for the membrane anchorage of active H-Ras but not its wild type counterpart (13Paz A. Haklai R. Elad G. Ballan E. Kloog Y. Oncogene. 2000; 20: 7486-7493Crossref Scopus (339) Google Scholar). We proposed that active H-Ras is stabilized in the cell membrane when in complex with galectin-1 and that this would have an impact on Ras signals. Consistent with this proposal was the observation that overexpression of galectin-1 in HEK 293 cells up-regulated basal extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity under conditions where extracellular galectin functions were blocked (13Paz A. Haklai R. Elad G. Ballan E. Kloog Y. Oncogene. 2000; 20: 7486-7493Crossref Scopus (339) Google Scholar). These early experiments defined a role for galectin-1 as an escort protein of active H-Ras, and we wondered whether it affects the Ras choice of target proteins. We prepared green fluorescent protein (GFP)-H-Ras and GFP-K-Ras in pEGFP-C3 by inserting the respective full-length cDNAs of the human Ras isoforms into thePstI/BamHI site of pEGFP-C3 (CLONTECH) as detailed previously (13Paz A.

We cloned rat galectin-1 cDNA and inserted it into the KpnI and HindIII sites of pcDNA3 (sense orientation) or into the NotI site (antisense orientation) as detailed earlier (13Paz A. Haklai R.

We maintained cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum (13Paz A. Haklai R. Elad G. Ballan E. Kloog Y. Oncogene. 2000; 20: 7486-7493Crossref Scopus (339) Google Scholar). We transfected 1.5 × 106 COS-7 cells with a total amount of 1.5 μg of DNA by dextran (Amersham Biosciences) or 8 × 105 HEK 293 cells with total amount of 6 μg of DNA by calcium phosphate (Sigma). The cells were harvested 48 h after transfections using lysis buffers containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (13Paz A. Haklai R. Elad G. Ballan E. Kloog Y.

Data were expressed as means ± S.D., and differences between means were examined by Student's t test. We co-transfected COS-7 cells with 0.75 μg of plasmid DNA coding for galectin-1 along with 0.75 μg of plasmid DNA coding for each H-Ras(G12V), H-Ras(G12V/T35S), H-Ras(G12V/Y40C), H-Ras(wt), K-Ras(G12V), or K-Ras(wt) and lysed them 48 h later. Lysates containing 7 mg of protein were subjected to immunoprecipitation with 3 μg of mouse pan-Ras Ab (Ab-3; Calbiochem) followed by SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotting (13Paz A. Haklai R. Elad G.

We then visualized Ras proteins and the 14-kDa galectin-1 protein by ECL and quantified the bands by densitometry with Image Master VDS-CL (Amersham Biosciences) using TINA 2.0 software (Ray Tests). We co-transfected HEK 293 cells with the combination of 0.15 μg of plasmid DNA coding for GFP-H-Ras or for GFP-K-Ras and 5.85 μg of empty pcDNA, 2.85 μg of plasmid DNA coding for galectin-1 and 3 μg of pcDNA, or 2.85 μg of galectin-1 antisense RNA plasmid (galectin-1-AS) and 3 μg of pcDNA. Twenty-four h after transfection the cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF for the times indicated and lysed in 0.5 ml of Ras binding domain (RBD) lysis buffer (24Herrmann C.

We used lysates containing 30 μg of protein for the determination of total GFP-Ras (∼54 kDa) by Western immunoblotting with pan-anti-Ras Ab and lysates containing 500 μg of protein for the determination of GFP-Ras-GTP by the glutathione S-transferase (GST)-RBD pull-down assay followed by Western immunoblotting with pan-anti-Ras Ab as detailed previously (21Fridman M.

We determined ERK or phospho-ERK using 30 μg of lysate protein by Western immunoblotting, ECL, and densitometry as detailed above. ERK immunoblots were incubated with 1:2000 rabbit anti-ERK1/2 Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and then with 1:1000 peroxidase-goat anti-rabbit IgG; phospho-ERK immunoblots were incubated with 1:10,000 mouse anti-phospho-ERK Ab (Sigma) and then with 1:10,000 peroxidase-goat anti-mouse IgG. We determined Raf kinase activity with a Raf-1 immunoprecipitation kinase cascade assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology). HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with plasmids coding for K-Ras, H-Ras, H-Ras(G12V), or its effector loop mutants along with a plasmid coding for galectin-1 or with empty vector as detailed above. All combinations included 1.5 μg of plasmid DNA coding for Raf-1(wt). Twenty-four h after transfection, the cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then either left unstimulated (activated Ras transfectants) or stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 5 min. The cells were then lysed in 0.5 ml of Raf-1 kinase assay kit lysis buffer. Raf-1 was immunoprecipitated from 300 μl of lysate and assayed in the coupled kinase assay using myelin basic protein (MBP) from Sigma as a substrate and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as a phosphate donor according to the manufacturer's instructions. The amount of 32P-labeled MBP thus formed was estimated in a scintillation counter. We determined PI3K activity using a published procedure (25Pardo O.E. Arcaro A. Salerno G. Raguz S. Downward J. Seckl M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12040-12046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) in HEK 293 cells that were transfected and treated with EGF as detailed for the Raf-1 kinase assay (omitting the Raf-1 plasmid). We lysed the cells with 0.5 ml of PI3K lysis buffer (25Pardo O.E. Arcaro A. Salerno G. Raguz S. Downward J. Seckl M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12040-12046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), immunoprecipitated the enzyme from 500 μl of lysate with rabbit anti-PI3K p85 Ab (Upstate Biotechnology), and assayed its activity with 0.5 mg/ml phosphatidylinositol and 125 μm ATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. We extracted the lipids with chloroform/methanol and then separated them by TLC (25Pardo O.E. Arcaro A. Salerno G. Raguz S. Downward J. Seckl M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12040-12046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Phospholipid markers were use for the identification of the 32P-labeled phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate product (25Pardo O.E. Arcaro A. Salerno G. Raguz S. Downward J. Seckl M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12040-12046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The32P-labeled lipid products were visualized by an overnight exposure on an x-ray film, and the spots were then quantified by TINA analysis. Our previous experiments suggested that the activated forms of H-Ras and of K-Ras4B (referred to as K-Ras), but not of N-Ras, interact with galectin-1. We therefore focused on H-Ras and K-Ras, attempting first to determine whether GDP-bound Ras(wt) interacts with galectin-1. This was done by co-immunoprecipitation assays with H-Ras(wt) or H-Ras(G12V)/galectin-1 co-transfectants and K-Ras(wt) or K-Ras(G12V)/galectin-1 co-transfectants. The wild type isoforms were GDP-bound, and the constitutively active mutant forms were GTP-bound. We found that with comparable levels of Ras and galectin-1 expression, galectin-1 co-immunoprecipitated with H-Ras(G12V) or with K-Ras(G12V)—GTP-bound forms much more efficiently than it did with H-Ras(wt) or with K-Ras(wt) (Fig.1 A). H-Ras(wt) binding of galectin-1 was (mean ± S.D., n = 3) 32 ± 4% that of H-Ras(G12V) (p < 0.05), and K-Ras(wt) binding of galectin-1 was 6 ± 2% that of K-Ras(G12V) (p < 0.01). Less galectin-1 co-immunoprecipitated with K-Ras(G12V) than with H-Ras(G12V). Perhaps the affinity of H-Ras-GTP toward galectin-1 is higher than that of K-Ras-GTP. Alternatively, more galectin-1 molecules may associate with H-Ras(G12V) than with K-Ras(G12V). We cannot exclude the possibility that the observed differences between the apparent amounts of galectin-1 that were co-immunoprecipitated with K-Ras(12V) and with H-Ras(12V) are a result of a difference in the affinity of the Ras Ab toward H- and K-Ras isoforms. In any case, since the activated forms of Ras seemed to associate with galectin-1, this association could affect the stability of the bound nucleotide and as well as Ras-effector interactions. Thus, we looked at the impact of Ras-GTP/galectin-1 interactions on the stability of the bound nucleotide employing Ras(wt) isoforms that alternate between GDP- and GTP-bound states. We expressed GFP-tagged versions of H-Ras and K-Ras to permit a clear distinction from endogenous Ras and to permit comparison to the previously described galectin-1 influence on localization of these fusion proteins (13Paz A. Haklai R. Elad G. Ballan E. Kloog Y. Oncogene. 2000; 20: 7486-7493Crossref Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Following transfections in HEK 293 cells and stimulation with EGF, we pulled down GFP-Ras-GTP with GST fused to the RBD of Raf-1, which binds Ras-GTP but not Ras-GDP (21Fridman M. Maruta H. Gonez J. Walker F. Treutlein H. Zeng J. Burgess A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30363-30371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 24Herrmann C. Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In cells transfected with GFP-H-Ras or GFP-K-Ras, we found a typical EGF-stimulated transient increase in Ras-GTP that peaked at 5 min and returned to basal levels after 10–15 min (Fig. 1,B and C). In Ras/galectin-1 co-transfectants, we found higher basal and EGF-stimulated Ras-GTP levels and prolongation of the EGF response (Fig. 1, B and C). The apparent levels of GFP-Ras-GTP were about 2–2.5-fold higher in the co-transfectants and remained relatively high even 1 h after stimulation. The higher EGF-induced increase in Ras-GTP was mediated by intracellular galectin-1, since adding galectin (0.5 μm) to the medium failed to increase basal GFP-Ras-GTP levels or the EGF response (Fig. 1 D). Moreover, there was no effect of 100 mm lactose, which interferes with galectin-1 binding to glycan ligands, on the response to EGF stimulation in the co-transfectants (not shown). The above results, in keeping with the preferential co-immunoprecipitation of galectin-1 with Ras-GTP over Ras-GDP, suggest that galectin-1 binds preferentially to Ras-GTP, stabilizing it in a conformation that may also render Ras less sensitive to Ras-GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) (26Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Wiesmuller L. Lautwein A. Schmitz F. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1997; 277: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). Accordingly, galectin-1 might have been expected to raise basal Ras-GTP levels by stabilizing the small percentage of Ras-GTP that exists under normal conditions; this was indeed the case (Fig. 1, B and C). In the presence of EGF, the level of Ras-GTP is higher, and more is available to bind to galectin. Thus, the -fold increase in Ras-GTP in response to EGF was similar in the absence and in the presence of galectin-1; the values recorded in GFP-Ras transfectants and in GFP-Ras/galectin-1 co-transfectants were 2.1 and 2.5, respectively. This is consistent with the idea that when Ras-GTP molecules are formed, they “search” for galectin-1 partners. To build up in the membrane, they have to find such partners, and the more galectin there is, the more Ras-GTP can accumulate. We gained additional support for the above assertion by knocking down endogenous galectin-1 in HEK 293. These cells express galectin-1 (13Paz A. Haklai R. Elad G. Ballan E. Kloog Y. Oncogene. 2000; 20: 7486-7493Crossref Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 23Lahm H. Andre S. Hoeflich A. Fischer J.R. Sordat B. Kaltner H. Wolf E. Gabius H.J. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 2001; 127: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and galectin-1-AS specifically abolished galectin-1 expression; antisense RNA for the related galectin-3 protein has no effect on galectin-1 levels or on GFP-H-Ras(G12V) in HEK 293 cells (13Paz A. Haklai R. Elad G. Ballan E. Kloog Y. Oncogene. 2000; 20: 7486-7493Crossref Scopus (339) Google Scholar). We co-transfected cells with galectin-1-AS and GFP-Ras and then stimulated the co-transfectants with EGF and found that both basal and EGF-induced increases in Ras-GTP were strongly inhibited (Fig. 1, B and C). EGF still induced a 2-fold increase in GFP-Ras-GTP as in cells singly transfected with GFP-Ras, demonstrating a shift in Ras-GTP/Ras-GDP equilibrium in the opposite direction from the one induced by galectin-1 overexpression. These experiments establish a functional link between galectin-1 and active Ras, suggesting that this linkage may have an impact on Ras effectors. We next examined the impact of Ras/galectin-1 interactions on Raf-1, a canonical Ras effector, using cells transfected with galectin-1 or Ras(wt) alone or Ras(wt) and galectin-1 together. The cells were stimulated for 5 min with EGF, a time point at which peak Ras-GTP levels after EGF stimulation were observed (Fig. 1, B and C). We then measured Raf-1 activity in the cell lysates by immunoprecipitating Raf-1 and assaying its activity in a kinase cascade Raf kinase assay. We found that whereas basal activities in galectin-1, H-Ras, or K-Ras transfectants were elevated compared with pcDNA controls, EGF induced an increase in Raf-1 activity, which was stronger in the galectin-1/Ras(wt) co-transfectants compared with galectin-1 or Ras(wt) transfectants (Fig.2 A). In line with the observed equilibrium shift in basal and in EGF-stimulated increases in Ras-GTP (Fig. 1, B and C), the -fold increase in Raf-1 activity was, however, not altered by galectin-1; the recorded values were 2.2 ± 0.3, 1.85 ± 0.2, 1.7 ± 0.1, 1.6 ± 0.1, 1.7 ± 0.09, and 1.7 ± 0.2, respectively (mean ± S.D., n = 4), in pcDNA controls, galectin-1, H-Ras(wt), H-Ras(wt)/galectin-1, K-Ras(wt), and K-Ras(wt)/galectin-1 transfectants. Thus, the galectin-1 enhancement of the EGF-stimulated increase in Ras-GTP (Fig. 1, B and C) promoted elevated Raf-1 activity (Fig. 2 A). We then used GFP-H-Ras or GFP-K-Ras transfectants and GFP-Ras/galectin-1 co-transfectants to examine whether the enhancement of EGF-induced Raf-1 activity propagated to ERK. We found that galectin-1 enhanced the EGF-stimulated increase in the active phospho-ERK protein (Fig. 2, B and C). Similar to its effects on the EGF-induced increase in GFP-Ras-GTP (Fig. 1,B and C), galectin-1 promoted a stronger and more prolonged activation of ERK, and galectin-1-AS inhibited the EGF response (Fig. 2, B and C). We conclude that galectin-1-Ras interactions enhance the Ras activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. This prompted the question whether such an effect of galectin-1 is confined to this pathway or might be operative in a different pathway. Therefore, we next examined the effects of galectin-1 expression on a second well established Ras effector, PI3K type I, the catalytic subunit of which interacts directly with active Ras-GTP (4Rodriguez Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. Nature. 1994; 370: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar, 5Rodriguez Viciana P. Warne P.H. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2442-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). We studied H-Ras- or K-Ras-transfected cells or cells co-transfected with galectin-1 and each of these two Ras isoforms. The cells were stimulated for 5 min with EGF, and PI3K was then immunoprecipitated from the cell extracts by anti-PI3K p85 Ab. The precipitates were subjected to a PI3K assay. We found, as expected, that EGF stimulated PI3K activity, inducing 1.6 ± 0.1- and 1.8 ± 0.3-fold increases, respectively (means ± S.D., n = 3), in PI3K activity in H-Ras and in K-Ras transfectants (Fig. 3). However, co-transfection with galectin-1 strongly inhibited the EGF-mediated stimulation of PI3K activity (Fig. 3). The degrees of inhibition of EGF stimulation by galectin-1 were 84 ± 12 and 63 ± 8%, respectively (means ± S.D., n = 3, p < 0.05), in the H-Ras and K-Ras cells. Thus, under the very same conditions where galectin-1 enhanced basal and EGF-stimulated increases in Ras-GTP and activation of the Raf-1/MEK/ERK cascade, it inhibited PI3K activation by the growth factor. These results suggest that the interactions of galectin-1 with H-Ras-GTP or with K-Ras-GTP provide selectivity to the Ras signal. Apparently, the signal of galectin-1-Ras-GTP mimics that of the Ras(T35S) effector loop mutant that activates Raf-1 but not PI3K (9White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. Van Aelst L. Karin M.

Our results raised the possibility that galectin-1 induces a conformational change in Ras-GTP that permits interaction with Raf-1 but not with PI3K. We examined this possibility using H-Ras(G12V/T35S), which preferentially binds and activates Raf-1, and H-Ras(G12V/Y40C), which preferentially binds and activates PI3K (5Rodriguez Viciana P.

Science. 1996; 271: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The use of constitutively active Ras mutants enabled us to examine the effect of galectin-1 on the selectivity of Ras signaling without the possible interference of its effect on Ras-GTP stabilization. We first tested this assertion in H-Ras(G12V) and in H-Ras(G12V)/galectin-1 co-transfectants. Compared with vector controls, H-Ras(G12V) induced a 4.7 ± 0.9-fold increase in Raf-1 activity and a 12.2 ± 1.6-fold increase (mean ± S.D., n = 4) in PI3K activity (Fig. 4, A andB). Raf-1 activity in galectin-1/H-Ras(G12V) co-transfectants (Fig. 4 A) was no higher than it was in H-Ras(G12V) transfectants, but PI3K activity (Fig. 4 B) was strongly inhibited (72 ± 12%, mean ± S.D.,n = 4, p < 0.01). These results demonstrate that the effects of galectin-1 on H-Ras-GTP stabilization and on signal selectivity are separable. We could then use H-Ras(G12V) effector loop mutants to explore the nature of the galectin-1-induced shift in the Ras signal. We found, as expected, that H-Ras(G12V/T35S) induced a 4.2 ± 0.3-fold increase (mean ± S.D., n = 4) in Raf-1 activity but did not increase PI3K activity (Fig. 4 A). Raf-1 activity was not enhanced in galectin-1/H-Ras(G12V/T35S) co-transfectants (Fig.4 A). In H-Ras(G12V/Y40C) transfectants, we detected a small increase in Raf-1 activity and a strong 9.0 ± 0.9-fold increase (mean ± S.D., n = 4) in PI3K activity (Fig. 4,A and B), confirming the known selectivity of this mutant. Raf-1 activity in the galectin-1/H-Ras(G12V/Y40C) co-transfectants was as low as in the H-Ras(G12V/Y40C) transfectants (Fig. 4 A), but the PI3K activity was as high as in the Ras(G12V/Y40C) transfectants (Fig. 4 B). Thus, the ability of galectin-1 to inhibit PI3K activation in galectin-1/H-Ras(G12V) co-transfectants was not apparent at all in galectin-1/H-Ras(G12V/Y40C) co-transfectants, demonstrating that galectin-1 does not alter the signal in a mutant that is already locked in a conformation that favors interaction with a distinct Ras effector. This is also consistent with the observation that galectin-1 neither enhanced nor inhibited Raf-1 activity in the galectin-1/H-"

In humans, mutations in either of the two subunits for this channel, the sulfonylurea type 1 receptor (Sur1) or Kir6.2, cause persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy. We have generated and characterized Sur1 null mice. Interestingly, these animals remain euglycemic for a large portion of their life despite constant depolarization of membrane, elevated cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentrations, and intact sensitivity of the exocytotic machinery to Ca2+. A comparison of glucose- and meal-stimulated insulin secretion showed that, although Sur1 null mice do not secrete insulin in response to glucose, they secrete nearly normal amounts of insulin in response to feeding. Because Sur1 null mice lack an insulin secretory response to GLP-1, even though their islets exhibit a normal rise in cAMP by GLP-1, we tested their response to cholinergic stimulation. We found that perfused Sur1 null pancreata secreted insulin in response to the cholinergic agonist carbachol in a glucose-dependent manner. Together, these findings suggest that cholinergic stimulation is one of the mechanisms that compensate for the severely impaired response to glucose and GLP-1 brought on by the absence of Sur1, thereby allowing euglycemia to be maintained.

In response to a rise in the intracellular ATP/ADP ratio that occurs with glucose metabolism the closure of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP)1 channels causes the β cell membrane to depolarize. This, in turn, leads to the opening of voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels, a rise in the cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), and the subsequent exocytosis of insulin (5Rorsman P. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The β cell KATP channel is an octameric complex of two proteins: an inward-rectifier K+channel, Kir6.2, and the sulfonylurea receptor type 1 (Sur1), which are present in a 4:4 stoichiometry (6Clement J.P., IV Kunjilwar K.

Gonzalez G. Bryan J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Sulfonylureas, which are widely used for treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, act by binding to KATP channels and stimulating their closure (10Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Mutations in Sur1 are a frequent cause of persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PHHI), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by excess and unregulated secretion of insulin. Because initial identification of Sur1 as a candidate gene for PHHI by Aguilar-Bryan et al. (11Aguilar-Bryan L. Nichols C.G. Wechsler S.W. Clement J.P., IV Boyd III, A.E. Gonzalez G. Herrera-Sosa H. Nguy K. Bryan J. Nelson D.A. Science. 1995; 268: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar), more than 50 different mutations in this gene, as well as 2 mutations in Kir6.2, have been identified in PHHI patients (12Shepherd R.M.

Analyses of pancreatic β cells from PHHI patients, as well as functional studies of mutated KATP channels introduced into cultured cells, suggest that impaired KATP channel function and/or expression is a common mechanism underlying PHHI (13Shyng S.L.

Both Kir6.2 and Sur1 knock-out mice have previously been shown to maintain euglycemia, despite the absence of functional KATP channel in their islets (16Miki T. Nagashima K. Tashiro F. Kotake K.

However, the mechanisms that enable mice lacking KATP channels to maintain regulated insulin secretion are not known. Because identification of these mechanisms may lead to new insights into the regulation of insulin secretion, we have also generated mice that lackSur1. We found that Sur1 null mice secrete normal amounts of insulin upon meal ingestion, largely through intact second phase insulin secretory responses, and that an intact response to cholinergic stimulation may explain the ability of these mice to regulate their insulin secretion in the absence of KATPchannels. These results suggest that, although KATPchannels play an important role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, other insulin secretagogues act to stimulate secretion of this hormone through KATP channel-independent mechanisms. Both BAC (129/SvJ) and P1 (129/Ola) clones containing theSur1/Kir6.2 gene locus were isolated by PCR screening (Genome Systems, Inc., St. Louis, MO). The gene targeting strategy involved the placement of tandemly oriented loxP sites around a 1.01-kbp DNA fragment that contains the proximal promoter and exon 1 of Sur1, and its subsequent removal with cre recombinase (Fig. 1 B). Positive selection was achieved with a phosphoglycerol kinase-neomycin resistance gene (pgk-neo) cassette, and negative selection with a phosphoglycerol kinase-herpes simplex virus type I thymidine kinase gene (pgk-tk) cassette placed outside the 3′ arm of the targeting vector. After electroporation of RW4 ES cells (Genome Systems, Inc., St. Louis, MO), 21 of 321 clones (6.5%) were found to be resistant to both G418 and gancyclovir and to have the desired 10.1-kb band after digestion with KpnI and hybridization with the BamHI/BglII probe (Fig. 1 C). Chimeric animals were generated by microinjection of two different ES cell clones into C57BL/6 blastocysts. Germline transmission of theSur1 lox+neo allele was obtained with ES cell clone 2G4. The Sur1 lox+neo allele was converted to the Sur1neo allele by pronuclear microinjection of 1 ng/μl CMV-cre expression vector (pBS185) into embryos obtained from matings ofSur1 lox+neo/w andSur1 w/w mice. Mice were fed a standard rodent chow diet, maintained on 12-h light/dark cycle, and were specific pathogen-free. The Sur1 lox+neo,Sur1neo, and Sur1walleles were distinguished by PCR using two different sets of primers. The primers SUR.1 (5′-CAATTCCTCAACTGAGGCTCTTAA) and SUR.2 (5′-TCGCAGAGTGACCTCACAGCCTGT) amplify a 530-bp DNA fragment from theSur1 lox+neo allele and a 412-bp fragment from the Sur1w allele. The primers SUR.1 and Neo-5′ (5′-AGCCTCGTTCCACATACACTTCA) generate a 414-bp fragment from theSur1neo allele. The predicted band of 1566 bp from the Sur1 lox+neo allele is not detected using standard PCR conditions. Mice with a mixed genetic background (129/SvJ × C57BL/6) were used in all studies except for pancreas perfusion study, with wild-type littermates serving as the controls. In the pancreas perfusion study, congenic animals that were produced by backcrossing for nine generations with C57BL/6J mice were used. In this case, the controls were either wild-type littermates or age-matched C57BL/6J animals. Islets of Langerhans were isolated from 8–10-week-old mice by a collagenase technique (18Lacy P.E. Kostianovsky M. Diabetes. 1967; 16: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (2498) Google Scholar) and dispersed into single cells in Ca2+- and Mg2+-deficient medium as previously described (19Lernmark A. Diabetologia. 1974; 10: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Whole-cell K+ currents were recorded using the perforated-patch configuration of the patch-clamp technique as described previously (20Bränström R. Efendiæ S. Berggren P.O. Larsson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14113-14118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The rate of exocytosis was determined as changes in cell capacitance (21Deeney J.T. Gromada J. Hoy M.

Cell capacitance was measured for >2 min with 0.2-s intervals after establishment of the standard whole-cell configuration. The pipette solution (intracellular-like solution) contained 125 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Hepes, 3 mm Mg-ATP, 10 mm EGTA, and 0, 2, 5, 8, 9, or 9.8 mm CaCl2. The free Ca2+concentrations in these solutions were estimated to 0, 0.05, 0.22, 0.9, 2.0, and 10 μm, respectively, using the binding constants of Martell and Smith (22Martell A.E. Smith R.M. Critical Stability Constants. 1 and 2. Plenum Press, New York1974Google Scholar). Rates of exocytosis are presented as the increase in cell capacitance observed during the first 60 s following establishment of the whole-cell configuration, excluding any rapid changes occurring during the first 10 s required for equilibration of the pipette solution with cytosol. Cells were loaded with 2 μm fura-2/AM in culture medium containing 3 mm glucose at 37 °C for 30 min. Fluorometry using two excitation wavelengths at 340 and 380 nm was performed on either an Axiovert 35M microscope (Zeiss, Oberkerchen, Germany) equipped with an imaging system from Life Science Resources (Cambridge, United Kingdom), or an Axiovert 135TV microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a cooled CCD camera (Photometrics Ltd., Tucson, AZ) and an Inovision imaging system (Inovision Corp., Durham, NC). Groups of 10 islets were preincubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing 115 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.6 mmCaCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 20 mmNaHCO3, 16 mm HEPES, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin with 1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine at 37 °C for 1h and incubated for another 15 min in same buffer with or without 10 mm GLP-1-(7–36). The reaction was stopped by 50 mm HCl and neutralized with NaOH. Concentration of cAMP was determined by a cAMP 125I scintillation proximity assay (Amersham Biosciences). Hyperglycemic clamp studies were performed using chronically cannulated, 12–20-week-old conscious mice as described previously (23Niswender K.D. Shiota M. Postic C. Cherrington A.D. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22570-22575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Mice were fasted for 6 h prior to experimentation. A 4-μCi bolus of tracer ([3-3H]glucose, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was given at −100 min, followed by a constant infusion at 0.04 μCi/min for the remainder of the 220-min study. The tracer and glucose solution were infused through a cannula implanted into the right jugular vein. The glucose turnover rate (mg·kg−1·min−1) was calculated as the rate of tracer infusion (dpm/mg) divided by the corrected plasma glucose specific activity (dpm/mg) per kilogram body weight of the mouse. The glucose clearance (ml·kg−1·min−1) was calculated as the rate of glucose turnover rate divided by the plasma glucose concentration (mg/ml). Blood samples were taken from the cannula implanted into the left carotid artery at indicated time. Mice at 8–16 weeks of age were fasted for 16 h prior to experimentation. In situ pancreas perfusion was performed according to the method of Bonnevie-Neilsenet al. (24Bonnevie-Nielsen V. Steffes M.W. Lernmark A. Diabetes. 1981; 30: 424-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. After ligating the superior mesenteric, hepatic, splenic, and right and left renal arteries, and tying off the aorta just below the diaphragm, the celiac trunk was perfused with oxygenated Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 3% Dextran T70 (AmershamBiosciences) at 1 ml/min through a catheter placed in the aorta. The effluent was collected at 1-min intervals from the portal vein. Blood glucose levels were determined by a glucose oxidase method using a blood glucose analyzer (Hemocue, Mission Viejo, CA). Plasma glucose levels were determined by the UV method (25Kunst A. Draeger B. Ziegenhorn J. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1984: 163-172Google Scholar). Plasma insulin concentrations were measured using either RIA kit (Linco Research, St. Louis, MO) or ELISA kit (Crystal Chem, Chicago, IL). Insulin concentrations in the pancreas perfusate were determined by RIA using anti-insulin coated tubes (ICN, Orangeburg, NY) and radiolabeled insulin (Diagnostic Products, Los Angeles, CA). Plasma GLP-1 (active form) concentrations were determined using ELISA kit (Linco Research, St. Louis, MO). Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Differences between groups were evaluated using Student'st test. p < 0.05 was considered to be significant. Overlapping BAC and P1 clones containing the mouse Sur1/Kir6.2 gene locus were obtained and analyzed by DNA sequencing to determine intron/exon structure. The mouse Sur1 gene was found to consist of 39 exons ranging in size from 33 to 243 nucleotides and to span ∼80 kbp (see Fig. 1 A). In contrast, the Kir6.2 gene is intronless, spans only 1.5 kbp, and lies ∼5 kbp downstream of the 3′ end of the Sur1 gene. The gene targeting strategy shown in Fig.1 (B–D) was used to generate mice containing theSur1 lox+neo allele. To create a null allele forSur1 (Sur1neo), a ∼1-kbp gene segment containing both promoter and exon 1 sequences was removed bycre-mediated recombination. Analysis of 199 offspring from the intercrossing of mice that were heterozygous for theSur1neo allele (e.g. Sur1 neo/w, where windicates the wild type allele) showed a Mendelian distribution of genotypes (50 Sur1 w/w , 107 Sur1 neo/w, and 42Sur1 neo/neo). Mice lackingSur1 (e.g. Sur1 neo/neo) were fertile and indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates in term of growth rate (data not shown). Pancreatic β cells from mice lacking Sur1exhibited a continuous train of action potentials that were blocked by an inhibitor of the L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel, similar to that reported by Seghers et al. (17Seghers V. Nakazaki M. DeMayo F. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9270-9277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the lack of functional KATP channels inSur1 neo/neo β cells as assessed by measurements of whole-cell K+ currents. By using the standard whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique, cells were depolarized to potentials between −60 and +50 mV in 10-mV steps from a holding potential of −70 mV. This protocol was applied twice, immediately and at 3 min after establishment of configuration using a pipette solution devoid of Mg-ATP. The whole-cell K+currents were significantly increased as intracellular ATP was washed out in control (Sur1 w/w) β cells, indicating the activation of ATP-dependent K+currents (Fig. 2 A). However, wash out of ATP did not affect the corresponding currents inSur1 neo/neo β cells (Fig.2 B). We also observed elevated basal [Ca2+]i inSur1 neo/neo β cells, as seen previously in Kir6.2 knock-out mouse β cells (16Miki T. Nagashima K. Tashiro F. Kotake K. Yoshitomi H. Tamamoto A. Gonoi T. Iwanaga T. Miyazaki J. Seino S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10402-10406Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar).Sur1 w/w β cells typically responded with a prompt increase in [Ca2+]ias glucose was increased from 3 to 17 mm (n= 13) (Fig. 2 C). In contrast,Sur1 neo/neo β cells showed variable [Ca2+]i responses. In the presence of 3 mm glucose, several of theSur1 neo/neo β cells exhibited oscillations in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 2,D and E), whereas otherSur1 neo/neo β cells showed increased but non-oscillating levels of [Ca2+]i (Fig. 2 F). Upon stimulation with 17 mm glucose, the majority of theSur1 neo/neo β cells responded with a transient decrease in [Ca2+]i, which later on was increased to a higher sustained level (Fig. 2,D–F). Despite of elevation of basal [Ca2+]i in β cells, we did not observe hyperinsulinemia inSur1 neo/neo mice. Rather, the animals remained euglycemic for a large part of their life (Fig.3 A). Older animals showed mild hypoglycemia compared with the control animals; however, this did not appear to be the result of hyperinsulinemia, as seen in PHHI patients, because there was no difference in plasma insulin level betweenSur1 w/w andSur1 neo/neo mice (Fig.3 B). To test the possibility that the exocytotic machinery in Sur1 neo/neo β cells is impaired by the chronically elevated [Ca2+]i, we examined the sensitivity of the exocytotic machinery to Ca2+ by measuring an increment of cell capacitance at different Ca2+ concentrations. Either 0.9 or 10 μm free Ca2+ produced a more pronounced increase in cell capacitance in Sur1 neo/neo β cells compared with Sur1 w/w β cells, indicating a higher sensitivity of the exocytotic machinery to Ca2+ in Sur1 neo/neo β cells than Sur1 w/w β cells (Fig.4 A). Approximating the Hill equation to the average rates of exocytosis in response to various concentrations of free Ca2+ (Fig. 4 B) yielded EC50 values of 0.47 μm forSur1 w/w β cells and 0.43 μm for Sur1 neo/neo β cells. The results demonstrate that sensitivity of the exocytotic machinery to Ca2+ is not impaired inSur1 neo/neo β cells.Figure 4Machinery for exocytosis in Sur1 neo/neo β cells is sensitive to Ca2+.

The plasma glucose concentration was held at ∼300 mg/dl in conscious animals for 2 h by infusion of glucose solution through an implanted cannula. In response to this prolonged hyperglycemic stimulusSur1 w/w mice showed an increase in their plasma insulin concentrations of 5.8-fold (0.55 ± 0.13 to 2.72 ± 0.70 ng/ml, p = 0.025). In contrast, the Sur1 neo/neo mice showed only a 1.5-fold increase in their plasma insulin concentrations (0.55 ± 0.13 to 0.81 ± 0.26 ng/ml, p = 0.115) (Fig.5). The glucose infusion rate necessary to maintain hyperglycemia, as well as the glucose turnover and glucose clearance rates in Sur1 neo/neo mice, were all lower than in Sur1 w/w mice (37, 58, and 58%, respectively; see Fig. 5 and TableI). The reduction of all of these parameters indicates diminished glucose tolerance in theSur1 neo/neo mice because of impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.Table ISummary of metabolic parameters determined during hyperglycemic clamp experimentsSur1 w/w (n = 4)Sur1 neo/neo (n = 6)Plasma glucose (mg/dl)301 ± 9298 ± 6Plasma insulin (ng/ml)2.72 ± 0.70.81 ± 0.31-ap < 0.05 vs. Sur1 w/w mice.Glucose infusion rate (mg·kg−1·min−1)51.9 ± 9.319.5 ± 2.91-bp < 0.01 vs. Sur1 w/w mice.Glucose turnover (mg·kg−1·min−1)53.7 ± 5.931.1 ± 1.31-bp < 0.01 vs. Sur1 w/w mice.Glucose clearance (ml·kg−1·min−1)18.0 ± 2.410.5 ± 0.51-bp < 0.01 vs. Sur1 w/w mice.The average values of metabolic parameters during hyperglycemic clamp (time: 60–120 min) were calculated.

Open table in a new tab The average values of metabolic parameters during hyperglycemic clamp (time: 60–120 min) were calculated. Data represent the mean ± S.E. The finding that mice without Sur1 are euglycemic for much of their life was in apparent conflict with their markedly impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Therefore, to test the possibility that non-glucose secretogogues were acting to stimulate insulin secretion in the absence of functional KATP channels, we measured blood glucose and plasma insulin levels in both Sur1 w/wand Sur1 neo/neo mice during the postprandial period. After a 16-h fast, the mice were given free access to food and both blood glucose and insulin levels were determined. Both sets of mice were observed to begin refeeding within a few min and to eat frequently for at least 30 min. The blood glucose levels in both the Sur1 w/w andSur1 neo/neo mice increased rapidly until about 60 min, then gradually decreased (Fig.6 A, upper graph). Although the difference in mean values between the two groups was not significant, 2 of 4Sur1 neo/neo mice studied showed abnormally high levels of postprandial glucose concentration (> 250 mg/dl at 60 min), whereas none of theSur1 w/w animals showed any values over 200 mg/dl through the experimental period (Fig. 6 A,inset). Sur1 w/w mice exhibited a 9-fold increase in their plasma insulin levels 30 min after initiation of refeeding and maintained plasma insulin concentrations that were within 80% of this peak level during rest of the experimental period (Fig. 6 A, lower graph). Interestingly, although the plasma insulin level did not rise as rapidly during the first 30 min inSur1 neo/neo mice, similar or higher levels were observed thereafter until the end of the 150-min test period. The oral intake of glucose is known to stimulate the secretion of incretin hormones such as glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which augment the effect of glucose on the islet (26Drucker D.J. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 159-169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ahrén B. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 642-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus, to determine whether ingested glucose might have contributed to the increase of insulin secretion after refeeding ofSur1 neo/neo mice, we performed a gastric glucose tolerance test. After a 16-h overnight fast, glucose (2 g/kg body weight) was administered via gavage. This caused the blood glucose concentrations to increase rapidly in both theSur1 w/w andSur1 neo/neo mice during the first 20-min period (Fig. 6 B, upper graph). In the Sur1 w/w mice the blood glucose concentration reached a peak of 374 ± 10 mg/dl at 20 min before declining, whereas in the Sur1 neo/neomice the blood glucose peaked at 433 ± 26 mg/dl at 30 min. However, whereas the plasma insulin concentration increased rapidly in the Sur1 w/w mice, it did not change in Sur1 neo/neo mice (Fig.6 B, lower graph). The peak plasma insulin levels achieved after meal ingestion in theSur1 w/w mice was over 3-fold of that observed in response to the glucose gavage. For theSur1 neo/neo mice this difference was even more striking, with the peak plasma insulin level being ∼13-fold higher for the meal compared with the glucose gavage. The lack of any significant increase in plasma insulin concentrations in Sur1 neo/neo mice after gastric glucose gavage led us to test whether incretins were being secreted, whether they were able to cause a normal rise in cAMP levels, and whether they were able to augment insulin secretion inSur1 neo/neo mice. To explore these possibilities, we first measured the plasma concentration of GLP-1-(7–36) amide during refeeding after an overnight fast but found no differences between the Sur1 w/wand Sur1 neo/neo animals (6.6 ± 2.2 pm versus 7.5 ± 1.5 pm, respectively). The lack of any difference suggests that GLP-1 is secreted normally in the Sur1 neo/neomice. We next examined the effect of GLP-1-(7–36) on insulin secretion in these animals. In Sur1 w/w mice a transient but drastic increase in plasma insulin level was observed 5 min after intravenous administration of GLP-1-(7–36) (10 nmol/kg body weight) with glucose (1g/kg body weight), whereas only a moderate increase was observed with glucose alone (Fig. 6 C). In marked contrast, GLP-1-(7–36) failed to stimulate any rise in the plasma insulin concentration inSur1 neo/neo mice at 5 min after administration. Only a slight increase in the insulin concentration, which resulted in a modest improvement of glucose tolerance, was observed 20 min after administration of GLP-1-(7–36) in these mice (Fig. 6 C). Changes in blood glucose concentration during this test showed that glucose tolerance was significantly improved in Sur1 w/w mice but only slightly inSur1 neo/neo mice by GLP-1-(7–36) administration (Fig. 6 C). The inability of GLP-1 to stimulate insulin secretion inSur1 neo/neo mice does not reflect a lack of cAMP production. As shown in TableII, we measured cAMP levels in isolated islets and observed Sur1 neo/neo islets produced a similar amount of cAMP to Sur1 w/w islets in response to GLP-1-(7–36).Table IICyclic AMP production by GLP-1 in isolated isletsGLP-1(−)(+)Sur1 w/w96 ± 9827 ± 67Sur1 neo/neo88 ± 19767 ± 88Islets were incubated in the absence or presence of 10 nmGLP-1-(7–36) for 15 min, and intracellular cAMP was measured.

Data are shown in femtomoles of cAMP/10 islets and represent the mean ± S.E. of five independent experiments. To understand the mechanisms by which Sur neo/neo mice are able to secrete nearly normal amount of insulin in response to feeding, we tested the effect of carbachol, a cholinergic agonist, on insulin secretion from perfused pancreas. Cholinergic stimulation is known to potentiate sustained insulin secretion from normal islets in glucose-dependent manner (28Persaud S.J. Jones P.M. Sugden D. Howell S.L. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). When the glucose concentration was shifted from 3 to 11 mm, a clear biphasic insulin secretion was observed inSur1 w/w pancreata, whereas"

We investigated glucose metabolism in isolated islets from 10–12-week-old Zucker fatty (ZF) and Zucker lean (ZL) rats (results expressed per mg/islet of protein). ZF rats were obese, hyperlipidemic, and normoglycemic. They had a 3.8-fold increased β-cell mass along with 3–10-fold increases in insulin secretion to various stimuli during pancreas perfusion despite insulin content per milligram of β-cells being only one-third that of ZL rats. Islet glucose metabolism (utilization and oxidation) was 1.5–2-fold increased in the ZF islets despite pyruvate dehydrogenase activity being 30% lowered compared with the ZL islets. The reason was increased flux through pyruvate carboxylase (PC) and the malate-pyruvate and citrate-pyruvate shuttles based on the following observations (% ZL islets): increasedV max of PC (160%), malate dehydrogenase (170%), and malic enzyme (275%); elevated concentrations of oxaloacetate (150%), malate (250%), citrate (140%), and pyruvate (250%); and 2-fold increased release of malate from isolated mitochondria. Inhibition of PC by 5 mm phenylacetic acid markedly lowered glucose-induced insulin secretion in ZF and ZL islets. Thus, our results suggest that PC and the pyruvate shuttles are increased in ZF islets, and this accounts for glucose mitochondrial metabolism being increased when pyruvate dehydrogenase activity is reduced. As the anaplerosis pathways are implicated in glucose-induced insulin secretion and the synthesis of glucose-derived lipid and amino acids, our results highlight the potential importance of PC and the anaplerosis pathways in the enhanced insulin secretion and β-cell growth that characterize β-cell adaptation to insulin resistance.

Insulin resistance is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes (1Reaven G.M. Annu. Rev. Med. 1993; 44: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). However, most affected individuals do not develop diabetes because of a compensatory increase in insulin secretion (2Kahn S.E. Prigeon R.L. McCulloch D.K. Boyko E.J. Bergman R.N. Schwartz M.W. Neifing J.L. Ward W.K. Beard J.C. Palmer J.P. Porte Jr., D. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1663-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). The mechanism of the β-cell adaptation is poorly understood. Particularly unclear is the dichotomy that insulin resistance is typically accompanied by elevated blood and tissue triglyceride and fatty acid (FA)1 levels (3Brunzell J.D. Hokanson J.E. Diabetes Care. 1999; 22: C10-C13Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) when multiple studies of isolated islets and β-cell lines cultured with FA have shown detrimental effects on β-cell function and viability (4Zhou Y-P.

A well known mechanism for altered cellular function from excess FA is the glucose-fatty acid cycle of Randle, part of which is impaired activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) (8Randle P.J. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1998; 14: 263-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). This effect is reported to occur in FA-cultured islets (9Zhou Y.P. Grill V.E. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). PDH supplies pyruvate-derived acetyl-CoA to the citrate cycle so that in most tissues excess FA results in lowered ATP production. Intact β-cell mitochondrial function is required for glucose-induced insulin secretion (10Wollheim C.B. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 374-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 11Silva J.P. Kohler M. Graff C. Oldfors A. Magnuson M.A. Berggren P.O. Larsson N.G. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 336-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), leading to speculation that this is a mechanism of FA-induced impaired β-cell function (9Zhou Y.P. Grill V.E. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, lowering and raising PDH activity in clonal β-cells through adenoviral overexpression of PDH kinase and the catalytic subunit of PDH phosphatase, respectively, had little effect on glucose-induced insulin secretion (12Nicholls L.I. Ainscow E.K. Rutter G.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 1081-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This may reflect a second pathway for mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism in β-cells through pyruvate carboxylase (PC). Downstream of PC are pyruvate shuttles (13MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20051-20058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Farfari S. Schulz V. Corkey B. Prentki M.

Deeney J.T. Yaney G.C. Tornheim K. Prentki M. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 299S-304SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar) which are proposed to provide coupling factors for glucose-induced insulin secretion. The effect of FA on these pathways is uncertain. We investigated rat islets cultured for 4 days with 0.25 mmoleate/5.5 mm glucose (17Liu Y.Q. Tornheim K. Leahy J.L. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1747-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). PDH activity was 35% lowered, but glucose oxidation and insulin secretion were normal to supernormal depending on the studied glucose concentration. We proposed the reason was the observed unaffected PC activity and enhanced flux through the malate-pyruvate shuttle; the latter is proposed to be an effector of insulin secretion through the malic enzyme production of cytosolic NADPH (13MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20051-20058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Lu D. Mulder H. Zhao P. Burgess S.C. Jensen M.V. Kamzolova S. Newgard C.B. Sherry A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Support for our conclusion is the lowered PC expression resulting in defective malate-pyruvate shuttle activity reported in FA-cultured islets with impaired glucose-induced insulin secretion (20Iizuka K. Nakajima H. Namba M. Miyagawa J. Miyazaki J. Hanafusa T. Matsuzawa Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1586: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Also, PC expression and activity are lowered in islets of diabetic rodents with defective glucose-induced insulin secretion (21MacDonald M.J. Efendic S. Östenson C.G. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 886-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 22MacDonald M.J. Tang J. Polonsky K.S. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1626-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These results focus on PC and the malate-pyruvate shuttle as components of the β-cell adaptation in states of excess FA such as insulin resistance. However, all of the cited studies were performed in vitro. The current study investigated Zuckerfa/fa fatty rats. These rats are obese, insulin resistant, and hyperlipidemic because of mutated leptin receptors (23Phillips M.S. Liu Q. Hammond H.A. Dugan V. Hey P.J. Caskey C.J. Hess J.F. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 18-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). Moreover, they are not diabetes-prone (24Cockburn B.N. Ostrega D.M. Sturis J. Kubstrup C. Polonsky K.S. Bell G.I. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1434-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 25Pick A. Clark J. Kubstrup C. Levisetti M. Pugh W. Bonner-Weir S. Polonsky K.S. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 358-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), making them an excellent model to investigate β-cell adaptation to insulin resistance. Zucker fatty (fa/fa, ZF)and Zucker lean (fa/− or −/−, ZL) rats were studied at 10–12 weeks of age (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) except for β-cell mass measurements that were performed in 10-week-old ZF and ZL rats. Tail vein blood was obtained from normally fed rats at 9:00 a.m.; glucose concentration was measured using Glucose Analyzer II (Beckman, Fullerton, CA), and plasma insulin, triglycerides, and FA were measured by commercial kits (Alpco; Winham, NH, Sigma; Wako; Richmond, VA, respectively). Islets were isolated by an adaptation of the Gotoh method (26Gotoh M. Maki T. Satomi S. Porter J. Bonner-Weir S. O'Hara C.J. Monaco A.P. Transplantation. 1987; 43: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar): pancreas duct infiltration with collagenase, histopaque gradient separation, and hand picking. DNA was measured by the Labarca method (27Labarca C. Paigen K. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4553) Google Scholar), protein by a commercial kit that used BSA as standard (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and insulin content post acid ethanol extraction using an insulin RIA (28Albano J.D. Ekins R.P. Maritz G. Turner R.C. Acta Endocrinol. 1972; 70: 487-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Freshly isolated islets were used after 30 min of incubation in KRB, 5.5 mm glucose, and 0.07% BSA unless stated otherwise. Because of the larger cell number of the islets from ZF versus ZL rats, methods utilized half the number of islets from obese versus lean rats and results are expressed per milligram of islet protein. Rats were euthanized, and pancreata dissected and immersion-fixed in 4.0% paraformaldehyde/100 mm phosphate-buffered saline. Following paraffin embedding, 5-μm sections throughout the entire pancreas were mounted as ribbons on microscope slides to facilitate section counting. At 200-μm intervals, (∼20 slides/pancreas), sections were rehydrated and immunostained with guinea pig anti-insulin IgG (Linco, St. Charles, MO) followed by donkey anti-guinea pig IgG-peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Following development with diaminobenzidine/H2O2, sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, cleared, and mounted in Permount. The proportion of β-cell surface area versus surface area of the whole pancreas was determined by digitally imaging at least three non-overlapping 3.89 mm2 fields per section on a Zeiss Universal microscope coupled to a Spot RT color charge-coupled device camera (Diagnostics Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI). β-Cell mass was calculated for each animal as the average proportional β-cell surface area multiplied by pancreatic weight. The perfusion technique has been described elsewhere (29Weir G.C. Knowlton S.D. Martin D.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1974; 54: 1403-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The perfusate was oxygenated KRB buffer, pH 7.4, that contained 4% dextran T70 and 0.2% BSA fraction V (Sigma). The perfusion protocol is shown at the top of Fig. 1. Following 17 min of equilibration at 7.8 mmglucose, 1-min samples were collected in tubes on ice that contained 8 mg of EDTA and stored at −20 °C pending analysis by insulin RIA. Immediately after the perfusion, the pancreas was excised, blotted, and stored at −20 °C in acid ethanol pending homogenization and insulin RIA. Glucose utilization and oxidation were determined withd-[5-3H]glucose and [U-14C]glucose as described (30Hosokawa H. Corkey B.E. Leahy J.L. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 392-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Insulin secretion was measured in duplicate vials of five islets following a 60-min incubation in KRB, 10 mm HEPES, 0.5% BSA, glucose (2.8, 8.3, 27.7 mm) at 37 °C in a shaking water bath. Islets were sedimented by gentle centrifugation and assayed for insulin content post sonication and extraction in acid ethanol. Insulin in the medium was measured by insulin RIA and expressed as percent of islet insulin content. Experiments were performed with and without 5 mm phenylacetic acid (PAA), which is an inhibitor of PC activity (14Farfari S. Schulz V. Corkey B. Prentki M. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Freshly isolated islets were incubated 60 min at 37 °C in prewarmed and oxygenated KRB that contained the stated glucose concentration in the text or figure followed by biochemical analysis. Citrate concentration was measured as described (31Liu Y.Q. Tornheim K. Leahy J.L. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1889-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Islets (200 ZL, 100 ZF) were lysed with trichloroacetic acid and placed on ice followed by centrifugation to remove precipitated proteins. Supernatant was neutralized by ether extraction 5×, lyophilized, and resolubilized in 100 μl of H2O. Extract (20 μl) or citrate standard (0.1–2 nmol) was added to 0.1m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, 40 μmZnCl2, 3 μm NADH, 0.4 μg/ml malate dehydrogenase, final volume 0.5 ml. Fluorescence was determined at 340 nm excitation and 465 nm emission, then repeated 5 min after adding 10 μl of citrate lyase solution with the Δ value representing the citrate content. G6P concentration was measured as described (32Liu Y.Q. Tornheim K. Leahy J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1870-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Islets underwent rapid lysis after the 60-min incubation using 10 μl of 40 mm NaOH and were placed on ice for 10 min, and then 3 μl of 0.15 m HCl was added with incubation at 75 °C for 20 min to destroy cellular enzymes to ensure stability of the G6P. Extract (20 ZL islets, 10 ZF islets) was added to 15 μl of reaction buffer (0.15 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.1, 20 μm NADP, 0.02 units/ml grade 1 glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from yeast; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and incubated 30 min at 28 °C in a shaking water bath followed by addition of 4 μl of 1 mNaOH and incubation at 75 °C for 20 min to destroy any remaining NADP. The formed NADPH was amplified by the cycling method by adding 100 μl of reagent (9 units/ml of type II glutamate dehydrogenase, 5 mm α-ketoglutaric acid, 1 mm G6P, 6 units/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) for 60 min at 38 °C, followed by heating to 100 °C for 10 min to stop the reaction. The sample (100 μl) was transferred to a UV cuvette containing 1 ml of 0.006 units/ml of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase in 0.15 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.1, 30 μm NADP, 0.1 mm EDTA, 30 mm ammonium acetate, and 5 mm MgCl2and let stand at room temperature for 30 min.

Following incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, the reaction was stopped by injecting 200 μl of 1 n HCl into the cup. CO2 was trapped in the filter paper by injecting 100 μl of 1 n KOH into the center well. PDH activity 1 unit = 1 μmol of CO2/min. PC and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) were measured as described (17Liu Y.Q. Tornheim K. Leahy J.L. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1747-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Islets (100 ZL, 50 ZF) were homogenized in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm cysteine, and 0.02% BSA. PC: 80 μl of extract was added to 0.92 ml of reaction buffer (80 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 2 mm ATP, 8 mm potassium pyruvate, 21 mm KHCO3, 9 mm MgSO4, 0.16 mm acetyl-CoA, 0.16 mm NADH, 5 units/ml malate dehydrogenase).

Islets (100 ZL, 50 ZF) were sonicated in 100 μl of 50 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.4, 3 mm MnCl2, and 0.02% BSA. Extract (50 μl) or NADPH standard (1–12 nmol) was added to 0.95 ml of prewarmed reaction buffer (50 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.4, 3 mm MnCl2, 0.02% BSA, 0.1 mm NADP, 1 mml-malate). Fluorescence was measured 20 min at 340 nm excitation and 420 nm emission. Mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (mGPD) was measured as described (17Liu Y.Q. Tornheim K. Leahy J.L. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1747-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Islets (100 ZL, 50 ZF) were sonicated in 0.1 ml of 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 230 mm mannitol, and 70 mm sucrose. Extract (10 μl) was added to 200 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm Bicine buffer, pH 8, 1 mm KCN, 50 mml-glycerol-3-phosphate, 4 mmiodonitrotetrazolium violet) for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of ethyl acetate followed by centrifugation and absorbance determination of the ethyl acetate layer at 490 nm. Results were compared with the standard curve made with 0–10 nmol of iodonitrotetrazolium violet in reaction mixture with or without (as blank) islet extract. The method is previously described (17Liu Y.Q. Tornheim K. Leahy J.L. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1747-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial isolation: islets (400 ZL, 200 ZF) were homogenized in 0.4 ml of 5 mm potassium HEPES, pH 7.5, 230 mm mannitol, and 70 mm sucrose and centrifuged at 600 × g for 5 min to sediment the nuclear and cell debris, followed by recentrifugation of the supernatant at 5,500 × g for 10 min to sediment the mitochondria.

Malate release was measured using the method of MacDonald (13MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20051-20058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mixture was placed at 37 °C, and 50-μl samples were taken at 0 and 10 min. Samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 2 min followed by addition of 15 μl of 0.92 m perchloric acid to the supernatant, return of pH to 7.0 with 1 m KOH, and recentrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 2 min. Malate was measured using the method of Sener et al. (33Sener A. Malaisse-Lagae F. Dufrane S.P. Malaisse W.J. Biochem. J. 1984; 220: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Supernatant (40 μl) or malate standard (0–30 pmol) was added to 200 μl of reaction buffer (100 mm Tris/KCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm NAD, 0.2 mm [3H]acetyl-CoA, 20 μg/ml malate dehydrogenase from pig heart, 60 μg/ml citrate synthase from pig heart) at room temperature for 60 min. The final product of [3H]citrate was separated with 600 μl of charcoal mixture (120 ml of 95% ethanol, 8 g of charcoal, 38 g of citrate acid monohydrate) and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min followed by liquid scintillation counting of the supernatant. All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. For protocols that used isolated islets from a single rat, then values are the number of rats studied. If pooled islets from more than one rat were needed, the n values are the number of experiments performed. Statistical significance was determined by the unpaired Student's t test. The 10–12 week-old ZF rats were obese, normoglycemic, hyperinsulinemic, and hyperlipidemic versus the lean controls (Table I). ZF rats had a 3.8-fold increased mass of islet β-cells. Pancreas insulin content was 150% of the ZL rats so that insulin content per mg of β-cells in the ZF rats was only 35% of the ZL rats (0.9 ± 0.1 μg/mg β-cells ZF versus 2.6 ± 0.1 μg/mg β-cells ZL, p < 0.001). Isolated islets were similar: ZF islets were hypercellular compared with ZL islets (3-fold increased DNA and protein contents), and insulin content per islet protein was 40% of the ZL islets (23 ± 3 ng of insulin/μg of protein ZF versus 56 ± 9 ng of insulin/μg of protein ZL, p < 0.001). Pancreas perfusions carried out at 7.8, 16.7, and 16.7 mm glucose plus 10 mmarginine (Fig. 1) showed a 10-fold increase of insulin secretion at 7.8 mm glucose, and 3-fold increases at both high glucose conditions in the ZF rats (allp < 0.001).Table IGeneral characteristics of 10–12-week-old Zucker fatty rats and Zucker lean ratsZLZFp valuennGeneralBody weight (g)245 ± 10 (13)357 ± 10 (13)0.001Blood glucose (mm)7.8 ± 0.1 (7)7.7 ± 0.2 (4)NSPlasma insulin (ng/ml)1.9 ± 0.3 (7)18.2 ± 2.9 (6)0.001Plasma triglycerides (mg/dl)69 ± 4 (6)545 ± 39 (6)0.001Plasma free fatty acids (meq/liter)0.68 ± 0.04 (6)1.01 ± 0.04 (6)0.001PancreasWeight (g)1.58 ± 0.08 (5)1.86 ± 0.37 (5)NSβ-Cell mass (mg/pancreas)22 ± 0 (5)85 ± 3 (5)0.001Insulin content (μg/ pancreas)58 ± 3 (5)76 ± 8 (5)NSIsolated isletDNA (ng/islet)44 ± 1 (4)118 ± 7 (4)0.001Protein (μg/islet)0.56 ± 0.05 (4)1.76 ± 0.13 (4)0.001Insulin content (ng/ islet)31 ± 3 (6)41 ± 4 (6)NSBlood or tissue was obtained at 9:00 a.m. from normally fed 10–12-week-old Zucker fatty and Zucker lean rats. β-Cell mass was measured in 10-week-old rats.

Glucose utilization (Fig.2 A) and oxidation (Fig.2 B) per mg of islet protein were 1.5–2-fold increased in the ZF islets at 2.8 and 16.7 mm glucose (utilization 2.8 mm glucose p < 0.025, 16.7 mmglucose p < 0.001; oxidation 2.8 mmglucose p < 0.015, 16.7 mm glucosep < 0.005). We next investigated potential mechanisms for the increased glucose metabolism. We previously studied rat islets cultured for 1 day with palmitate and noted increased basal glucose metabolism and insulin secretion (30Hosokawa H. Corkey B.E. Leahy J.L. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 392-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), possibly because of a lowered concentration of G6P that diminished end-product inhibition of hexokinase. We proposed that the mechanism was up-regulation of PFK activity through a dual effect, increased PFK expression and lowered production of the PFK allosteric inhibitor citrate by citrate synthase, so that flux through glycolysis was increased (31Liu Y.Q. Tornheim K. Leahy J.L. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1889-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 32Liu Y.Q. Tornheim K. Leahy J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1870-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, we found no difference in G6P level between the ZF and ZL islets after 60 min of incubation at 8.3 mm glucose (0.99 ± 0.08 nmol/mg protein ZLversus 1.26 ± 0.14 nmol/mg protein ZF,n = 4, p = NS),V max values for PFK (52 ± 2 nmol/min/mg protein ZL versus 68 ± 14 nmol/min/mg protein ZF,n = 6, p = NS), or citrate synthase (44 ± 3 nmol/min/mg protein ZL versus 43 ± 5 nmol/min/mg protein ZF, n = 4, p = NS). Rather, the citrate concentration after 60 min of incubation at 8.3 mm glucose was increased in the ZF islets (Fig.3 A). An alternate mechanism based on our study of 4-day oleate-cultured islets (17Liu Y.Q. Tornheim K. Leahy J.L. Diab"
https://openalex.org/W2081465644,"Myeloid cell leukemia 1 protein (MCL1) is an anti-apoptotic protein that is structurally related to Bcl-2. Unlike other Bcl-2 family proteins that are constitutively expressed, MCL1 is inducibly expressed in cells that are recently exposed to growth and differentiation stimuli. Here, we report the identification of fortilin as a novel MCL1-interacting protein by screening of a yeast two-hybrid library with MCL1 as bait. Fortilin specifically interacted with MCL1 both in vitro andin vivo. The intracellular localization of fortilin was predominantly nuclear and identical to that of MCL1, as shown by immunostaining and confocal microscopy analysis. Fortilin, like MCL1, was rapidly inducible in serum-stimulated human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells. Although the depletion of intracellular fortilin by small interfering RNA (siRNA) against fortilin (siRNA-fortilin) did not affect intracellular MCL1 level, the depletion of intracellular MCL1 by siRNA-MCL1 was associated with the significant reduction of the fortilin protein level, without affecting the fortilin transcript numbers. In addition, a pulse-chase experiment showed that the depletion of MCL1 by siRNA-MCL1 was associated with the rapid degradation of fortilin protein, which was found quite stable in the presence of MCL1. Furthermore, the half-life of fortilinR21A, a point mutant of fortilin lacking the binding to MCL1, was significantly shorter than that of wild-type fortilin as shown by a pulse-chase experiment. These data suggest that MCL1, in addition to being an anti-apoptotic molecule, serves as a chaperone of fortilin, binding and stabilizing fortilin in vivo. Taken together with our previous observation that fortilin overexpression prevents cells from undergoing apoptosis (Li, F., Zhang, D., and Fujise, K. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 47542–47549), it is likely that MCL1, an anti-apoptotic protein inducible by growth and differentiation stimuli, stabilizes another anti-apoptotic protein fortilin maximizing the prosurvival environment in cells.

MCL1 was originally identified as a protein structurally similar to Bcl-2 from the ML-1 human myeloid leukemia cell line stimulated by phorbol ester (1Kozopas K.M. Yang T. Buchan H.L. Zhou P. Craig R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3516-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Subsequent functional studies confirmed that MCL1 functions as an anti-apoptotic molecule and is capable of blocking apoptosis induced by various apoptotic stimuli, including staurosporine (2Reynolds J.E., Li, J. Craig R.W. Eastman A. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), etoposide (3Zhou P. Qian L. Kozopas K.M. Craig R.W.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6348-6352PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies showed that antisense depletion of MCL1 in phorbol ester-stimulated U937 cells can rapidly trigger apoptosis (5Moulding D.A. Giles R.V. Spiller D.G. White M.R. Tidd D.M. Edwards S.W. Blood. 2000; 96: 1756-1763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that the selective overexpression of MCL1 in hematopoietic tissues of transgenic mice improves the survival of hematopoietic cells and increased the outgrowth of myeloid cell lines (6Zhou P. Qian L. Bieszczad C.K. Noelle R. Binder M. Levy N.B. Craig R.W. Blood. 1998; 92: 3226-3239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).However, despite its well demonstrated anti-apoptotic function, MCL1 distinguishes itself from other members of pro-survival Bcl-2 subfamily such as Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, A1, and Bcl-w (7Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4779) Google Scholar) by the fact that its intracellular level rapidly and transiently fluctuates in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli.

Intriguingly, MCL1 has been shown to interact with and negatively regulate the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a cell cycle-regulatory protein essential for G1 to S phase transition, and thereby retard the cell cycle progression (22Fujise K.

Thus, on the basis of its anti-apoptotic function, we have redesignated this protein fortilin (from the Latin fortis, meaning strong, robust) (28Li F. Zhang D. Fujise K. J. Biol.

The data presented here suggest that, in addition to acting as an anti-apoptotic protein itself, MCL1 may function as a protein partner of fortilin, binding to and stabilizing fortilin.DISCUSSIONWe have described the specific interaction between MCL1 and fortilin, a novel protein that prevents etoposide-induced cell death in U2OS cells (28Li F.

Our results presented here indicate that MCL1 is a protein partner of fortilin that binds and stabilizes fortilin. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an interaction between MC1 and fortilin in the literature.The interaction between MCL1 and fortilin is likely to be biologically significant. First, the interaction occurs not only in vitrobut also in vivo, in both yeast and mammalian cells (Figs. 1(A–C) and 7A). Second, MCL1 and fortilin are both predominantly localized in the nucleus by immunostaining analysis (Fig. 3, A and B). Third, both MCL1 and fortilin are rapidly induced by serum stimulation and exhibit similar expression kinetics in aortic vascular smooth muscle cell system (Fig. 4).

Consistently, as suggested by in vitro binding assays (Fig.2), fortilin apparently interacts with only one member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins: MCL1.RNAi is the process of sequence-specific, post-transcriptional gene silencing in animals and plants, initiated by dsRNA that is homologous in sequence to the silenced gene (31Elbashir S.M. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (2677) Google Scholar). It has been shown that 21-nucleotide siRNA duplexes specifically suppress expression of endogenous and heterologous genes in different mammalian cell lines and that the most efficient silencing is obtained with siRNA duplexes composed of 21-nucleotide sense and 21-nucleotide antisense strands, paired in a manner to have a 19-nucleotide duplex region and a 2-nucleotide overhang at each 3′-terminus (32Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8078) Google Scholar). This system would be advantageous over the overexpression system where fortilin or MCL1 is overexpressed and the stability of its partner is evaluated. This is because only a small amount of a native protein may be needed to fully stabilize its binding partner. Using the siRNA system, we first showed that MCL1 does not require fortilin to remain stable. On the contrary, MCL1 depletion quickly destabilized fortilin (Figs. 5 A and 6(A–C)). In addition, a point mutant of fortilin that lacks MCL1 binding was much more prone to degradation than wild-type fortilin (Fig. 7 B). It is thus likely that fortilin, through its binding to MCL1, becomes more stabilized and less susceptible to degradation.In the Introduction, we discussed that the inducibility of MCL1 is unique among anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins and that MCL1 is rapidly up-regulated upon growth and differentiation stimuli to cells (10Chao J.R.

Shalon D. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Science. 1999; 283: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar). With this in mind, one can speculate that the increase in stability of fortilin by MCL1 may be used by growing and differentiating cells to quickly increase the intracellular pro-survival environment by countering a potential instability associated with growth and differentiation. This stabilization of one anti-apoptotic protein (in this case fortilin) by another anti-apoptotic protein (in this case MCL1) has not been reported in literature and calls for further investigation. The regulatory role of the anti-apoptotic protein MCL11 in apoptosis needs clarification. MCL1 was originally identified as a protein structurally similar to Bcl-2 from the ML-1 human myeloid leukemia cell line stimulated by phorbol ester (1Kozopas K.M. Yang T. Buchan H.L. Zhou P. Craig R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3516-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Subsequent functional studies confirmed that MCL1 functions as an anti-apoptotic molecule and is capable of blocking apoptosis induced by various apoptotic stimuli, including staurosporine (2Reynolds J.E., Li, J. Craig R.W. Eastman A. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), etoposide (3Zhou P. Qian L. Kozopas K.M. Craig R.W. Blood. 1997; 89: 630-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), calcium ionophore A23187 (3Zhou P. Qian L. Kozopas K.M. Craig R.W. Blood. 1997; 89: 630-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), UV irradiation (3Zhou P. Qian L. Kozopas K.M. Craig R.W. Blood. 1997; 89: 630-643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and c-Myc overexpression (4Reynolds J.E. Yang T. Qian L. Jenkinson J.D. Zhou P. Eastman A. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6348-6352PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies showed that antisense depletion of MCL1 in phorbol ester-stimulated U937 cells can rapidly trigger apoptosis (5Moulding D.A. Giles R.V. Spiller D.G. White M.R. Tidd D.M. Edwards S.W. Blood. 2000; 96: 1756-1763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that the selective overexpression of MCL1 in hematopoietic tissues of transgenic mice improves the survival of hematopoietic cells and increased the outgrowth of myeloid cell lines (6Zhou P. Qian L. Bieszczad C.K. Noelle R. Binder M. Levy N.B. Craig R.W. Blood. 1998; 92: 3226-3239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, despite its well demonstrated anti-apoptotic function, MCL1 distinguishes itself from other members of pro-survival Bcl-2 subfamily such as Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, A1, and Bcl-w (7Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4779) Google Scholar) by the fact that its intracellular level rapidly and transiently fluctuates in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli. For example, certain cytotoxic agents (8Lomo J. Smeland E.B. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Blomhoff H.K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 40-43PubMed Google Scholar, 9Myklebust J.H. Josefsen D. Blomhoff H.K. Levy F.O. Naderi S. Reed J.C. Smeland E.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) drastically reduce MCL1 levels and then induce apoptosis. On the contrary, a number of cytokines and growth factors have been shown to rapidly up-regulate MCL1 levels, including granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (10Chao J.R. Wang J.M.

This rapid up-regulation, as well as the down-regulation of MCL1, has been attributed to the presence of PEST sequences (1Kozopas K.M. Yang T. Buchan H.L. Zhou P. Craig R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

With this in mind, one can speculate that the increase in stability of fortilin by MCL1 may be used by growing and differentiating cells to quickly increase the intracellular pro-survival environment by countering a potential instability associated with growth and differentiation. This stabilization of one anti-apoptotic protein (in this case fortilin) by another anti-apoptotic protein (in this case MCL1) has not been reported in literature and calls for further investigation. We have described the specific interaction between MCL1 and fortilin, a novel protein that prevents etoposide-induced cell death in U2OS cells (28Li F. Zhang D. Fujise K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47542-47549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Our results presented here indicate that MCL1 is a protein partner of fortilin that binds and stabilizes fortilin. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an interaction between MC1 and fortilin in the literature. The interaction between MCL1 and fortilin is likely to be biologically significant. First, the interaction occurs not only in vitrobut also in vivo, in both yeast and mammalian cells (Figs. 1(A–C) and 7A). Second, MCL1 and fortilin are both predominantly localized in the nucleus by immunostaining analysis (Fig. 3, A and B). Third, both MCL1 and fortilin are rapidly induced by serum stimulation and exhibit similar expression kinetics in aortic vascular smooth muscle cell system (Fig. 4). Of all the Bcl-2 family proteins, only MCL1 is inducible (10Chao J.R. Wang J.M. Lee S.F. Peng H.W. Lin Y.H. Chou C.H., Li, J.C. Huang H.M. Chou C.K. Kuo M.L. Yen J.J. Yang-Yen H.F. Mol. Cell.

Consistently, as suggested by in vitro binding assays (Fig.2), fortilin apparently interacts with only one member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins: MCL1. RNAi is the process of sequence-specific, post-transcriptional gene silencing in animals and plants, initiated by dsRNA that is homologous in sequence to the silenced gene (31Elbashir S.M. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (2677) Google Scholar). It has been shown that 21-nucleotide siRNA duplexes specifically suppress expression of endogenous and heterologous genes in different mammalian cell lines and that the most efficient silencing is obtained with siRNA duplexes composed of 21-nucleotide sense and 21-nucleotide antisense strands, paired in a manner to have a 19-nucleotide duplex region and a 2-nucleotide overhang at each 3′-terminus (32Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8078) Google Scholar). This system would be advantageous over the overexpression system where fortilin or MCL1 is overexpressed and the stability of its partner is evaluated. This is because only a small amount of a native protein may be needed to fully stabilize its binding partner. Using the siRNA system, we first showed that MCL1 does not require fortilin to remain stable. On the contrary, MCL1 depletion quickly destabilized fortilin (Figs. 5 A and 6(A–C)). In addition, a point mutant of fortilin that lacks MCL1 binding was much more prone to degradation than wild-type fortilin (Fig. 7 B). It is thus likely that fortilin, through its binding to MCL1, becomes more stabilized and less susceptible to degradation.

The Rho family small GTPases regulate actin cytoskeletal dynamics in different cell types. The function of two family members, Rho and Rac, is required for the stability of cadherins at cell-cell contacts. Consistent with the published data we have found that Rac is activated upon induction of intercellular adhesion in epithelial cells. This activation is dependent on functional cadherins (Nakagawa, M., Fukata, M., Yamaga, M., Itoh, N., and Kaibuchi, K. (2001) J. Cell Sci. 114, 1829–1838; Noren, N. K., Niessen, C. M., Gumbiner, B. M., and Burridge, K. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 3305–3308). Here we show for the first time that clustering of cadherins using antibody-coated beads is sufficient to promote Rac activation. In the presence of Latrunculin B, Rac can be partially activated by antibody-clustered cadherins. These results suggest that actin polymerization is not required for initial Rac activation. Contrary to what has been described before, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases are not involved in Rac activation following cell-cell adhesion in keratinocytes. Interestingly, inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling efficiently blocks the increased Rac-GTP levels observed after contact formation. We conclude that cadherin-dependent adhesion can activate Rac via epidermal growth factor receptor signaling. Cadherins are transmembrane receptors that mediate cell-cell adhesion.

They play an essential role in embryonic development and maintenance of tissue architecture in adults (1Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2923) Google Scholar). Cadherins interact in an anti-parallel fashion with the same type of receptors on adjacent cells (known as homophilic binding), thereby mediating formation of cell-cell contacts. Intercellular adhesion is strengthened by the clustering of cadherin receptors at junctions and the association between cadherin complexes and the actin cytoskeleton (2Adams C.L. Nelson W.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 572-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 3Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. Ann. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 119-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Cadherin-dependent adhesion is subject to regulation by cytoplasmic proteins, and recent work has focused on modulation by the Rho family of small GTPases. Members of this family of GTP-binding proteins regulate actin cytoskeletal dynamics and focal complex formation in different cell types (4Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5216) Google Scholar). The function of two family members, Rho and Rac, is required for the stability of cadherins at cell-cell contacts (5Braga V. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The exact mechanisms by which Rho and Rac operate are unclear, but we and others have shown that Rac plays a role in actin recruitment to junctions (6Takaishi K. Sasaki T. Kotani H. Nishioka H. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) and to clustered cadherin receptors (7Braga V.M.M. Machesky L.M. Hall A. Hotchin N.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1421-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 8Lambert M. Choquet D. Mege R.-M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Rho and Rac function in signal transduction cascades downstream of a variety of cell surface receptors. For example, Rho mediates stress fiber formation in response to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)1 stimulation, whereas Rac is required for growth factor-induced membrane ruffling (9Kjoller L. Hall A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 166-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). More recently it has been directly demonstrated that ligand binding to cell surface receptors can activate Rho and Rac (10Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar, 11Bernard V. Bohl B. Bokoch G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13196-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In addition, the regulation of the activity of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 by integrin engagement has been determined and shown to be dependent on time, matrix composition, and matrix concentration (12Adams J.C. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 13del Pozo M.A. Price L.S. Alderson N.B. Ren X.D.

Lately, it has become apparent that cadherin-mediated adhesion can trigger intracellular signaling events including activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3-kinases) and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (16Kim S.H., Li, Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36999-37005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 17Pece S. Chiariello M. Murga C. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 41227-41233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In addition, the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor has been coimmunoprecipitated with the cadherin adhesion complex from epithelial cells and is activated upon cell-cell contact formation (18Pece S. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41227-41233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 19Hoschuetzky H. Aberle H. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1375-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent work has demonstrated that cell-cell contact formation can activate Rac in Madine-Darby canine kidney and Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with C-cadherin (20Nakagawa M. Fukata M. Yamaga M. Itoh N. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1829-1838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,21Noren N.K. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3305-3308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Spreading of E-cadherin-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells on immobilized E-cadherin ectodomain also induces Rac activation (22Kovacs E.M. Ali R.G. McCormack A.J. Yap A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6708-6718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In addition, levels of GTP-bound Rac are higher in VE-cadherin-expressing endothelial cells than in VE-cadherin-null cells (23Lampugnani M.G. Zanetti A. Breviario F. Balconi G. Orsenigo F. Corada M. Spagnuolo R. Betson M. Braga V. Dejana E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1174-1189Crossref Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Although these studies showed that Rac activation is dependent on cadherin function, they did not establish the functional significance of Rac activation upon cell-cell contact formation, nor did they address the question of whether cadherin clustering is sufficient to enhance GTP loading on Rac. Although two studies found that PI3-kinase activity was required for full Rac activation, inhibition of PI3-kinase function did not reduce Rac activity to basal levels (20Nakagawa M. Fukata M. Yamaga M. Itoh N. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1829-1838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kovacs E.M. Ali R.G. McCormack A.J. Yap A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6708-6718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), suggesting that other signaling pathways may be involved in Rac activation downstream of cadherin-mediated adhesion. In light of these results, we were interested to determine whether cadherin-mediated adhesion could also activate Rac in keratinocytes. Normal keratinocytes provide the ideal system to look at Rac activation on induction of cell-cell adhesion. They can be grown to confluence in the absence of cadherin-dependent contacts (in low calcium medium), and then cell-cell adhesion can be induced by addition of calcium ions (known as the calcium switch) (24Hodivala K.J. Watt F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 589-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Because cells are confluent and touching each other, they do not need to migrate to form junctions, and contact formation occurs rapidly. Using this system, we investigated the requirements for Rac activation following cell-cell contact formation in terms of (a) clustering of cadherin receptors, (b) actin polymerization, and (c) PI3-kinase and EGF receptor signaling. Our results shed light on the mechanisms via which cadherin receptors are functionally coupled to Rac activation. Normal human keratinocytes (strains Kb and Sa, passages 3–7) were cultured as described previously (25Braga V.M. Betson M., Li, X. Lamarche-Vane N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3703-3721Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to confluence in low calcium medium (25Braga V.M. Betson M., Li, X. Lamarche-Vane N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3703-3721Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To induce intercellular adhesion calcium chloride was added to 2 mm. Microinjection experiments and recombinant protein production were performed as described previously (7Braga V.M.M. Machesky L.M. Hall A. Hotchin N.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1421-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence was performed as described previously (7Braga V.M.M. Machesky L.M. Hall A. Hotchin N.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1421-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Primary monoclonal antibodies used were: anti-E-cadherin (HECD-1, mouse and ECCD-2, rat) (26Hirai Y. Nose A. Kobayashi S. Takeichi M. Development. 1989; 105: 271-277PubMed Google Scholar); anti-P-cadherin (NCC-CAD-299, mouse) (27Shimoyama Y. Yoshida T. Terada M. Shimosato Y. Abe O. Hirohashi S. J.

Secondary antibodies and Dextran-Texas Red were from Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories (Stratech Scientific). Rabbit anti-mouse IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin were bought from Sigma. Pull-down assays, using a GST-PAK-CRIB fusion protein, were performed essentially as described (32Sander E.E. van Delft S. Klooster J.P. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A. Michaelis F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). One 9-cm dish of confluent keratinocytes was used per data point. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mmsodium chloride, 10 mm magnesium chloride and 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mm pefabloc). Lysates were incubated with PAK-CRIB beads (20 μg/dish) for 45 min, and beads were washed three times with wash buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mm sodium chloride, and 10 mmmagnesium chloride). Precipitated proteins and 2% of each lysate were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted, and probed for Rac. For antibody blocking experiments, cells were incubated with 5 μg/ml HECD-1 and 2 μg/ml NCC-CAD-299 for 30 min at 37 °C prior to addition of calcium. As a control, cells were preincubated with 7 μg/ml rabbit anti-mouse IgG. For clustering experiments, keratinocytes grown in low calcium medium were incubated for 15 min on ice with 5 μg/ml HECD-1 and 2 μg/ml NCC-CAD-299. Anti-mouse IgG was added to 35 μg/ml, and cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. For bead experiments, 15 μm latex beads (Polysciences) were coated with HECD-1 described as previously (7Braga V.M.M. Machesky L.M. Hall A. Hotchin N.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1421-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Latrunculin B (Calbiochem) was titrated to 0.3 μm, which prevented actin cytoskeleton remodeling in keratinocytes without causing cellular retraction. Cells were treated with Latrunculin B or Me2SO control for 10 min and incubated with HECD-1-coated beads (2.4 × 107 beads per dish) for 10 min before lysis. In inhibition experiments, cells were incubated with 30 μmLY294002 (Sigma), 316 nm tyrphostin AG1478 (Calbiochem) (18Pece S. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol.

In EGF stimulation experiments, cells were incubated with LY294002 or Me2SO vehicle as described above before stimulation with 10 nm EGF for 10 min. To probe for Akt phosphorylation, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm benzamidine, 2.5 μg/ml microcystin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mm pefabloc). Lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted, and probed using antibodies specific for total Akt (PW66) or Akt phosphorylated on serine 473 (PW56) (30Watton S.J. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 433-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mm sodium chloride, 2 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm pefabloc, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, and 1 mm sodium molybdate). Lysates were run on SDS-PAGE gels, blotted, and probed for total EGF receptor, activated EGF receptor (clone 74), or EGF receptor phosphorylated on tyrosine 1173 (R42/pY1173) (31Oksvold M.P. Skarpen E. Lindeman B. Roos N. Huitfeldt H.S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A number of studies have shown that a dominant negative version of Rac (N17Rac) inhibits the localization of cadherin receptors at sites of cell-cell contact (6Takaishi K. Sasaki T. Kotani H. Nishioka H. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 7Braga V.M.M. Machesky L.M. Hall A. Hotchin N.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1421-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Dominant negative mutants are presumed to function by sequestering upstream activators for the small GTPases, the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) (reviewed in Ref. 33Feig L.A. Nat. Cell. Biol. 1999; 1: E25-E27Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). However, there appears to be more than 46 GEFs for Rho family GTPases, many of which are rather promiscuous in exchange activity (reviewed in Ref. 34Zheng Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 26: 724-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that N17Rac blocks cadherin-mediated adhesion by inhibition of a Rho GTPase other than Rac. To determine whether Rac does indeed play a role in regulation of cadherin localization at intercellular junctions, we investigated whether an activated version of Rac (L61Rac) can rescue the inhibitory effect of N17Rac on cell-cell contacts. Normal human keratinocytes cultured in the absence of intercellular contacts were injected with recombinant dominant negative Rac protein, and cell-cell adhesion was induced for 1 h. Cells were fixed and stained for E-cadherin (Fig.1, A and B). As reported previously (7Braga V.M.M. Machesky L.M. Hall A. Hotchin N.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1421-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), N17Rac inhibited localization of cadherin receptors at boundaries between injected cells (Fig. 1, Aand B). Microinjection of L61Rac alone had no effect on cadherin localization at junctions after incubation for 1 h (Fig.1, C and D). Interestingly, co-injection of L61Rac and N17Rac completely rescued the inhibitory effect of N17Rac on cadherin-mediated adhesion (Fig. 1, E and F). This effect is specific for L61Rac because L61Cdc42 cannot restore junctional cadherin staining in N17Rac-injected cells. 2J. K. Zhang, unpublished observations. Together these results provide strong evidence that N17Rac blocks localization of cadherin receptors at junctions by inhibiting Rac function. Thus, Rac plays an important role in the regulation of cadherin-mediated adhesion. Because Rac activity is required for the stability of cadherin receptors at junctions, is Rac activated upon cell-cell contact formation in keratinocytes? To evaluate Rac activation, we performed pull-down assays utilizing the Cdc42/Rac interactive binding (CRIB) domain of the Rac effector p21-activated kinase (PAK) (32Sander E.E. van Delft S. Klooster J.P. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A. Michaelis F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). We confirmed the specificity of the assay under our conditions by loading keratinocyte lysates with GTPγS or GDP and assessing Rac activity (Fig. 2 a). To investigate whether cell-cell adhesion can activate the small GTPase Rac, we grew keratinocytes in low calcium medium and induced cell-cell contacts for various time periods before measuring Rac activation. We found that endogenous Rac was activated 2–4-fold within 5 min of addition of calcium, and this activation was sustained up to 120 min (Fig. 2, b and c). It is possible that the up-regulation of Rac described above was caused by stimulation of calcium-dependent intracellular signaling pathways rather than induction of cadherin-dependent adhesion. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we inhibited cadherin function during the calcium switch. Keratinocytes express at least two members of the cadherin family (E- and P-cadherin) (26Hirai Y. Nose A. Kobayashi S. Takeichi M. Development. 1989; 105: 271-277PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were preincubated with anti-E- and anti-P-cadherin antibodies at concentrations known to block cadherin function in keratinocytes (24Hodivala K.J. Watt F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 589-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). To confirm that the antibodies blocked cadherin function, we demonstrated that, in the presence of the inhibitory antibodies, no cadherin clustering was found at intercellular boundaries (Fig. 2 d). Incubation with anti-cadherin antibodies prevented Rac up-regulation upon addition of calcium ions, whereas control IgG did not (Fig. 2 e). Thus, the Rac activation is dependent on functional cadherin receptors, and addition of calcium ions per se is not sufficient to trigger Rac activation. These results demonstrated that cell-cell adhesion mediated by cadherins could activate Rac in keratinocytes. Because junction formation is accompanied by the clustering of cadherin receptors (3Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. Ann. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 119-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar), we investigated whether clustering of cadherins with antibodies was sufficient to activate Rac. Keratinocytes grown in low calcium medium were incubated with anti-E- and anti-P-cadherin antibodies (mouse monoclonals). Clustering of the receptors was then induced by addition of anti-mouse IgG, before assaying for Rac activity. Under these conditions, we could observe clusters of cadherins on the cell surface by immunofluorescence (Fig.3 A). We found that clustering induced a modest increase in Rac activity relative to samples where the anti-cadherin antibodies were omitted (Fig. 3 B). Quantification of the relative Rac activation in several experiments revealed that treatment of cells with anti-cadherin antibodies alone only induced a 1.2-fold increase in Rac activation relative to cells treated with anti-mouse IgG alone. Clustering of surface cadherins with two layers of antibodies induced a larger increase in Rac activation (1.7-fold; Fig. 3, B and F). However, the degree of Rac activation after antibody clustering is lower than the activation observed following cell-cell contact formation (2–4-fold). We hypothesized that this weak Rac activation may be due to the small number of cadherin molecules per cluster formed. To overcome this problem, we incubated cells for 10 min in low calcium medium with beads coated with anti-E-cadherin antibodies. Immunofluorescence of cells treated with these beads revealed binding of anti-E-cadherin beads to the cell surface and recruitment of α-catenin and F-actin to the beads (Fig. 3 C,arrowheads). In contrast, few beads coated with BSA alone bound to the cell surface, and those that did recruited little α-catenin or F-actin (Fig. 3 C, arrows,top panels). We found that cells incubated with anti-E-cadherin beads showed increased Rac activation in comparison with cells treated with BSA beads (Fig. 3 D). Quantification of the results of three experiments revealed that anti-E-cadherin beads enhanced Rac activation by a factor of 2.1 compared with BSA beads (Fig. 3 G), suggesting that clustering of cadherins is sufficient to activate Rac. To determine whether new actin polymerization is required for Rac activation by clustered cadherin molecules, we treated cells with Latrunculin B prior to receptor clustering. Latrunculin B inhibits actin polymerization by sequestering actin monomers (36Coue M. Brenner S.L. Spector I. Korn E.D. FEBS Lett. 1987; 213: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 37Spector I. Shochet N.R. Blasberger D. Kashman Y. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1989; 13: 127-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with Latrunculin B for 10 min before adding anti-E-cadherin beads still allowed binding of beads to the cell surface and recruitment of α-catenin but blocked actin recruitment (Fig.3 C, arrows, bottom panels). Upon assaying for Rac activation, we found that Latrunculin B treatmentper se caused an increase in Rac activation. Incubation with E-cadherin beads in the presence of Latrunculin B induced a further 1.4-fold increase in Rac activation (Fig. 3, D andG). Thus, Rac activation can occur in the absence ofde novo actin polymerization, but full induction of Rac activity does require formation of new actin filaments. However, the use of beads to artificially cluster cadherin receptors may resemble the phagocytotic process. Rac activity is necessary for Fcγ-mediated phagocytosis (38Caron E. Hall A. Science. 1998; 282: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Therefore, the possibility exists that anti-E-cadherin beads may induce Rac activation by triggering early events in phagocytosis. As a control to confirm that this was not the case, we treated cells with beads coated with antibodies against another cell surface receptor, α3β1-integrin. As expected, these beads showed little staining for α-catenin but did recruit F-actin (Fig.3 C, asterisks). However, anti-α3β1-integrin beads did not induce increased Rac activity relative to BSA control beads (Fig.3 E). Thus, the clustering of cadherin receptors can specifically activate Rac. We next explored which signaling pathways operate downstream of cadherin-dependent contact formation to induce Rac activity. We investigated three different classes of signaling molecule: PI3-kinases, the EGF receptor, and ERK1/2. We made use of the compounds LY294002, tyrphostin AG1478, and PD98059, specific inhibitors of PI3-kinases, the EGF receptor, and mitogen-activated kinase or ERK kinase-1 (MEK1), respectively (39Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Levitzki A. Gazit A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3254) Google Scholar). We confirmed that the inhibitors were functional under our experimental conditions by probing lysates for Akt phosphorylated on serine 473 (for LY294002; Fig. 4 A) or activated ERK1/2 (AG1478 and PD98059; Fig. 4, B andC). As expected, phosphorylation and activation of these molecules were blocked. Inhibition of keratinocytes with LY294002 increased Rac activity (compare with low calcium sample; Fig. 4 D) but did not inhibit Rac activation induced by cell-cell adhesion. We therefore concluded that PI3-kinases do not play a major role in Rac activation downstream of cadherin adhesion in keratinocytes. Similarly to LY294002, treatment of keratinocytes with tyrphostin AG1478 increased Rac activity (Fig. 4 D). However, the drug dramatically decreased Rac activation upon induction of cell-cell adhesion. Therefore we concluded that EGF receptor function participates in cadherin-dependent Rac stimulation (Fig.4 D). Consistent with this conclusion, calcium-induced cell-cell adhesion induces EGF receptor activation in normal keratinocytes 3M. Betson, E. Lozano, and V. M. M. Braga, unpublished observations. as has been observed in HaCat cells (18Pece S. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41227-41233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Rac activation in these experiments was quantified relative to the control low calcium cultures treated with Me2SO (Fig.4 G; −calcium, DMSO). However, there was some variability in the degree of Rac activation induced by drug treatment per se. For this reason Rac activity was also calculated relative to the control low calcium cultures treated with each inhibitor and was arbitrarily set at 1 (Fig. 4 I; −calcium). The inhibitors Latrunculin B, AG1478, or LY294002 can all activate Rac in keratinocytes. To investigate whether this Rac activation is a nonspecific consequence of treatment with different inhibitors, we incubated cells with the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059. Treatment with PD98059 compound did not increase the basal level of Rac activity in low calcium medium, nor did it inhibit activation of Rac induced by cell-cell contact formation (Fig. 4 E). Quantification of these experiments is shown in Fig. 4, H and I. Thus, blocking signaling pathways in general does not lead to Rac activation. In addition, these results suggested that the ERK/mitogen-activated kinase cascade is not involved in induction of GTP loading on Rac downstream of cadherin-dependent adhesion. EGF-stimulated activation of Rac is PI3-kinase-dependent in fibroblasts (42Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekman D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3071) Google Scholar). Given our results, we were interested to determine whether a similar pathway exists in keratinocytes. Cells grown in the absence of cell-cell contacts were incubated with the PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 and stimulated with EGF for 10 min. Whereas in untreated cells EGF stimulation induces a strong Rac activation, this is blocked by inhibition of PI3-kinase (Fig. 4 F). Thus, as in fibroblasts, EGF-induced Rac activation is PI3-kinase-dependent in keratinocytes. Our results demonstrate for the first time that"

A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that E2F-1 bound to Apaf-1 promoter upon E2F-1 overexpression, suggesting that Apaf-1 is under transcriptional regulation of E2F-1. These data demonstrate a novel mechanism of apoptosis in which an increase in Apaf-1 levels results in direct activation of caspase-9 without mitochondrial damage, leading to the initiation of a caspase cascade.

Dean D.C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2393-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Target genes of the E2F family include those encoding enzymes for DNA synthesis (DNA polymerase α, thymidine kinase, thymidylate synthase, dihydrofolate reductase, and ribonucleotide reductase), regulators of DNA replication (HsOrc1, Cdc6, MCM5, MCM6, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen), and components of the cell cycle machinery (Cdc2, Cdk2, cyclins A, D1, D2, and E, E2F-1, E2F-2, pRB, p107, and the Myc and Myb families) (2Kel A.E.

Among E2F family members, E2F-1 is unique in its ability to induce apoptosis, which may play a role in the cellular homeostasis of multicellular organisms (3Qin X.Q. Livingston D.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G.

Xie J.E. Dyson N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3684-3692Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The apoptosis-inducing ability of E2F-1 is important for suppressing untoward expansion of proliferating cells and, thus, provides an internal defense mechanism against tumor development. The importance of E2F-1-induced apoptosis under physiological conditions is clearly demonstrated by spontaneous development of multiple tumors in mice lacking E2F-1 (7Field S.J. Tsai F.Y. Kuo F.

Goillot E. Harlow E. Dyson N.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that deregulation of E2F-1 activity contributes to enhanced proliferation and resistance to cytotoxic drugs in human melanoma cells (9Halaban R. Cheng E. Smicun Y. Germino J. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). E2F-1 is also involved in the accelerated apoptosis of hematopoietic progenitor cells, which is considered the major mechanism of bone marrow failure in myelodysplastic syndrome (10Mundle S.D. Mativi B.Y. Cartlidge J.D. Dangerfield B. Broady- Robinson L., Li, B. Shetty V. Venugopal P. Gregory S.A. Preisler H.D. Raza A. Br. J. Haematol. 2000; 109: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To clarify the molecular basis of these diseases, it is essential to understand the precise mechanisms of E2F-1-induced apoptosis.There are a few reports dealing with the mechanisms of E2F-1-mediated apoptosis. First, Bates et al. (11Bates S. Phillips A.C. Clark P.A. Stott F. Peters G. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1998; 395: 124-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar) reported that E2F-1 induces transcriptional activation of ARF, which stabilizes p53 by sequestering MDM2, a ubiquitin ligase for p53. The stabilization of p53 results in facilitation of p53-dependent apoptosis. Obviously, this is not the sole mechanism of E2F-1-induced apoptosis, because E2F-1 can trigger cell death in p53-deficient tumors, including most leukemia cell lines (12Fueyo J. Gomez-Manzano C. Yung W.K.A. Liu T.J. Alemany R. McDonnel T.J. Shi X. Rao J.S. Levin V.A. Kyritsis A.P. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). p53 is also shown to be dispensable for E2F-1-mediated cell death by genetic approaches (13Phillips A.C. Bates S. Ryan K.M. Helin K. Vousden K.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1853-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Second, the lack of NF-κB activation has been described as a mechanism of increased sensitivity of E2F-1-overexpressing cells to apoptotic stimuli through the death receptor pathways (14Phillips A.C. Ernst M.K. Rice N.R. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 771-781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). However, this mechanism is not applicable to all cell types, because E2F-1 can induce apoptosis in a death receptor-independent manner in certain settings. Most recently, three groups demonstrated the involvement of the p53 homologue p73 in E2F-1-mediated apoptosis (15Lissy N.A. Davis P.K. Irvin M. Kaelin W.G. Dowdy S.F. Nature. 2000; 407: 642-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 16Stiewe T. Putzer B.M. Nat. Genet. 2001; 26: 464-469Crossref Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 17Irvin M. Marin M.C. Phillips A.C.

Although p73 is known to cause apoptotic cell death, its underlying mechanism is still unclear (18Sheikh M.S. Fornace Jr., A.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In view of the fact that p73 is also a transcription factor, it is possible that other direct mediators act downstream of p73 in E2F-induced apoptosis.To explore the mechanisms of E2F-1-induced apoptosis, we established K562 sublines that can overexpress E2F-1 conditionally. Using this system, we found that E2F-1 was capable of activating caspase-9 to initiate the caspase cascade without mitochondrial damage. We further demonstrated that the activation of caspase-9 was caused by up-regulation of Apaf-1, which is a direct transcriptional target of E2F-1.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we investigated the mechanisms of E2F-1-induced apoptosis using K562 sublines that can overexpress E2F-1 conditionally. When E2F-1 was overexpressed in these cells, apoptosis was readily induced after 72 h, following a transient increase in the S phase at 12 h. This confirms the notion that E2F-1 promotes cell cycle progression and apoptosis simultaneously to suppress untoward expansion of proliferating cells (3Qin X.Q. Livingston D.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G.

The activation of caspase-9 is usually triggered by the release of cytochromec from damaged mitochondria in response to certain apoptotic stimuli such as anticancer drugs, ultraviolet radiation, and serum deprivation (40Hakem R. Hakem A. Duncan G.S. Henderson J.T. Woo M. Soengas M.S. Elia A. de la Pompa J.L. Kagi D. Khoo W. Potter J. Yoshida R. Kaufman S.A. Lowe S.W. Penninger J.M. Mak T.W. Cell. 1998; 94: 339-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). Subsequently, cytochrome c binds to Apaf-1 and, in association with adenine nucleotides, facilitates a conformational change of Apaf-1 to expose its CARD domain (35Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I.

Apaf-1 oligomerizes through the exposed CARD domain and recruits procaspase-9 by a homophilic interaction involving CARDs, which results in catalytic autoactivation of caspase-9. However, E2F-1 activates caspase-9 through a different pathway; it bypasses the translocation of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol and directly induces autoactivation of caspase-9 via the increase in intracellular Apaf-1 levels. The involvement of other direct activators of caspase-9, including a CARD-containing adapter Nod-1/CARD4 (29Inohara N. Koseki T. del Peso L., Hu, Y. Yee C. Chen S. Carrio R. Merino J. Liu D., Ni, J.

Up-regulation of Apaf-1 is also observed during apoptosis caused by the adenoviral oncogene E1A, but it occurs as a secondary event of cytoplasmic accumulation of cytochrome c and therefore is distinct from that of E2F-1 (41Fearnhead H.O.

Although the mechanism by which caspase-9 is activated by the increase in Apaf-1 is at present unclear, a high concentration of Apaf-1 may increase the probability of physical interaction between procaspase-9 molecules even in the absence of mitochondrial damage, resulting in oligomerization and subsequent autoactivation of procaspase-9. This hypothesis is substantiated by studies in which forced expression of Apaf-1 solely promoted apoptosis in human myeloid leukemia cell lines (42Perkins C. Kim C.N. Fang G. Bhalla K.N. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4561-4566PubMed Google Scholar, 43Perkins C. Fang G. Kim C.N. Bhalla K.N. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1645-1653PubMed Google Scholar).Finally, we provide evidence that Apaf-1 is a direct transcriptional target of E2F-1 by analyzing the 5′-untranslated regions of the Apaf-1 gene. This finding is consistent with the results of a recent effort to identify E2F-responsive genes by global analysis of gene expression using high density oligonucleotide arrays; Apaf-1 is one of the newly identified E2F-1-inducible genes (44Muller H. Bracken A.P. Vernell R. Moroni M.C. Christians F. Grassilli E. Prosperini E. Vigo E. Oliner J.D. Helin K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 267-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Interestingly, E2F-2 and E2F-3 did not up-regulate Apaf-1 in this analysis, which is consistent with the fact that E2F-1 has the strongest ability in promoting apoptosis among E2F family members (5DeGregori J. Leone G. Miron A. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7245-7250Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). However, there are some reports suggesting that other E2F proteins, especially E2F-2 and E2F-4, are also capable of inducing apoptosis (45Chang Y.-C. Nakajima H. Illenye S. Lee Y.-S. Honjo N. Makiyama T. Fujiwara I. Mizuta N. Sawai K. Saida K. Mitsui Y. Heintz N.H. Magae J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4713-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 46Dirks P.B. Rutka J.T. Hubbard S.L. Mondal S. Hamel P.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying apoptosis induced by E2F-2 and E2F-4 may be different from that of E2F-1, because E2F-2 and E2F-4 cannot transactivate Apaf-1 (44Muller H. Bracken A.P. Vernell R. Moroni M.C. Christians F. Grassilli E. Prosperini E. Vigo E. Oliner J.D. Helin K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 267-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 47Weinmann A.S. Yan P.S. Oberley M.J. Huang T.H.-M. Farnham P.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Because E2F-4 was not able to induce apoptosis in our system (data not shown), it is likely that E2F-4-mediated apoptosis involves p53-dependent pathways.The structure of the Apaf-1 promoter is characteristic; it lacks either a typical TATA motif or initiator elements and is devoid of canonical binding sites for known transcription factors except E2F, Sp-1, and p53. Instead, the Apaf-1 promoter shows an extremely high G and C content (>60%) with an observed/expected CpG ratio of greater than 0.8, which fulfills the requirement of a CpG island (21Gardiner-Garden M. Frommer M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 261-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar). These features suggest that methylation of the CpG island serves as the major mechanism of transcriptional regulation of Apaf-1. Indeed, Apaf-1 expression is defective in approximately half of melanoma cell lines, which is reversed by 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, an inhibitor of methylation (39Soengas M.S. Capodieci P. Polsky D. Mora J. Esteller M. Opitz-Araya X. McCombie R. Herman J.G. Gerald W.L. Lazebnik Y.A. Cordon-Cardo C. Lowe S.W. Nature. 2001; 409: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). This implies that the Apaf-1 gene is silenced by methylation of the CpG island, and the modulation of the methylation status alleviates the repression to induce Apaf-1 transcription. In this study, we demonstrated the binding of E2F-1 to the Apaf-1 promoter in E2F-1-overexpressing cells using the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. This result indicates that E2F-1 participates in the derepression of the Apaf-1 gene probably by affecting promoter methylation. The mechanisms by which E2F-1 modulates the methylation status of the Apaf-1 promoter are currently under investigation in our laboratory.While this manuscript was being prepared, an almost identical observation was published by Moroni et al. (48Moroni M.C. Hickman E.S. Denchi E.L. Caprara G. Colli E. Cecconi F. Mullar H. Helin K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Moreover, Fortin et al. (49Fortin A. Cregan S.P. MacLaurin J.G. Kushwaha N. Hickman E.S. Thompson C.S. Hakim A. Albert P.R. Cecconi F. Helin K. Park D.S. Slack R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) reported that p53 up-regulates Apaf-1 as a direct transcriptional target during neuronal cell death. Notably, the former study clearly demonstrated that cytoplasmic translocation of cytochrome c is accompanied by E2F-1-induced apoptosis, which contradicts our present finding. This contradiction may stem from the difference in the p53 status of host cells used in each study; p53 expression is defective in our cell line, whereas Moroni et al. (48Moroni M.C. Hickman E.S. Denchi E.L. Caprara G. Colli E. Cecconi F. Mullar H. Helin K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) used primary human fibroblasts and U2OS cells, both of which possess normal p53. Although our finding may be unique to p53-deficient cells, it instead makes two important points clear. First, E2F-1 can transactivate the Apaf-1 gene in the absence of p53. This is clinically important because most cancer cells lost the function of p53. Second, it is suggested that the E2F-1/Apaf-1 pathway (growth-associated intrinsic route) works in parallel with the p53/Bax/cytochrome c pathway (DNA damage-triggered extrinsic route) in promoting apoptotic cell death.In conclusion, these data demonstrate a novel mechanism of apoptosis in which an increase in Apaf-1 levels induced by E2F-1 results in direct activation of caspase-9 without mitochondrial damage, leading to the initiation of a caspase cascade. Because both E2F-1 and Apaf-1 are frequently deregulated in various pathologic conditions, this finding may contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of many diseases. E2F is a family of transcription factors that control G1/S transition of eukaryotic cells by regulating the expression of various growth-related genes (1Harbor J.W. Dean D.C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2393-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Target genes of the E2F family include those encoding enzymes for DNA synthesis (DNA polymerase α, thymidine kinase, thymidylate synthase, dihydrofolate reductase, and ribonucleotide reductase), regulators of DNA replication (HsOrc1, Cdc6, MCM5, MCM6, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen), and components of the cell cycle machinery (Cdc2, Cdk2, cyclins A, D1, D2, and E, E2F-1, E2F-2, pRB, p107, and the Myc and Myb families) (2Kel A.E. Kel-Margoulis O.V. Farnham P.J. Bartley S.M. Wingender E. Zhang M.Q. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 99-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Among E2F family members, E2F-1 is unique in its ability to induce apoptosis, which may play a role in the cellular homeostasis of multicellular organisms (3Qin X.Q. Livingston D.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Adams P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10918-10922Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 4Wu X. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1997; 94: 7245-7250Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). In response to mitogenic stimuli, E2F-1 is induced in quiescent cells and promotes both cell cycle progression and apoptosis (6Du W. Xie J.E. Dyson N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3684-3692Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The apoptosis-inducing ability of E2F-1 is important for suppressing untoward expansion of proliferating cells and, thus, provides an internal defense mechanism against tumor development. The importance of E2F-1-induced apoptosis under physiological conditions is clearly demonstrated by spontaneous development of multiple tumors in mice lacking E2F-1 (7Field S.J. Tsai F.Y. Kuo F.

Goillot E. Harlow E. Dyson N.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that deregulation of E2F-1 activity contributes to enhanced proliferation and resistance to cytotoxic drugs in human melanoma cells (9Halaban R. Cheng E. Smicun Y. Germino J. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). E2F-1 is also involved in the accelerated apoptosis of hematopoietic progenitor cells, which is considered the major mechanism of bone marrow failure in myelodysplastic syndrome (10Mundle S.D. Mativi B.Y. Cartlidge J.D. Dangerfield B. Broady- Robinson L., Li, B. Shetty V. Venugopal P. Gregory S.A. Preisler H.D. Raza A. Br. J. Haematol. 2000; 109: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To clarify the molecular basis of these diseases, it is essential to understand the precise mechanisms of E2F-1-induced apoptosis. There are a few reports dealing with the mechanisms of E2F-1-mediated apoptosis. First, Bates et al. (11Bates S. Phillips A.C. Clark P.A. Stott F. Peters G. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1998; 395: 124-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar) reported that E2F-1 induces transcriptional activation of ARF, which stabilizes p53 by sequestering MDM2, a ubiquitin ligase for p53. The stabilization of p53 results in facilitation of p53-dependent apoptosis. Obviously, this is not the sole mechanism of E2F-1-induced apoptosis, because E2F-1 can trigger cell death in p53-deficient tumors, including most leukemia cell lines (12Fueyo J. Gomez-Manzano C. Yung W.K.A. Liu T.J. Alemany R. McDonnel T.J. Shi X. Rao J.S. Levin V.A. Kyritsis A.P. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). p53 is also shown to be dispensable for E2F-1-mediated cell death by genetic approaches (13Phillips A.C. Bates S. Ryan K.M. Helin K. Vousden K.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1853-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Second, the lack of NF-κB activation has been described as a mechanism of increased sensitivity of E2F-1-overexpressing cells to apoptotic stimuli through the death receptor pathways (14Phillips A.C. Ernst M.K. Rice N.R. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 771-781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). However, this mechanism is not applicable to all cell types, because E2F-1 can induce apoptosis in a death receptor-independent manner in certain settings. Most recently, three groups demonstrated the involvement of the p53 homologue p73 in E2F-1-mediated apoptosis (15Lissy N.A. Davis P.K. Irvin M. Kaelin W.G. Dowdy S.F. Nature. 2000; 407: 642-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 16Stiewe T. Putzer B.M. Nat. Genet. 2001; 26: 464-469Crossref Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 17Irvin M. Marin M.C. Phillips A.C. Seelan R.S. Smith D.I. Liu W. Flores E.R. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Vousden K.H. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nature. 2000; 407: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Although p73 is known to cause apoptotic cell death, its underlying mechanism is still unclear (18Sheikh M.S. Fornace Jr., A.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In view of the fact that p73 is also a transcription factor, it is possible that other direct mediators act downstream of p73 in E2F-induced apoptosis. To explore the mechanisms of E2F-1-induced apoptosis, we established K562 sublines that can overexpress E2F-1 conditionally. Using this system, we found that E2F-1 was capable of activating caspase-9 to initiate the caspase cascade without mitochondrial damage. We further demonstrated that the activation of caspase-9 was caused by up-regulation of Apaf-1, which is a direct transcriptional target of E2F-1. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we investigated the mechanisms of E2F-1-induced apoptosis using K562 sublines that can overexpress E2F-1 conditionally. When E2F-1 was overexpressed in these cells, apoptosis was readily induced after 72 h, following a transient increase in the S phase at 12 h. This confirms the notion that E2F-1 promotes cell cycle progression and apoptosis simultaneously to suppress untoward expansion of proliferating cells (3Qin X.Q. Livingston D.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Adams P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10918-10922Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 4Wu X. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Med. 1998; 4: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).We found that E2F-1 was capable of activating caspase-9 to initiate a caspase cascade in the absence of mitochondrial damage. The activation of caspase-9 is usually triggered by the release of cytochromec from damaged mitochondria in response to certain apoptotic stimuli such as anticancer drugs, ultraviolet radiation, and serum deprivation (40Hakem R. Hakem A. Duncan G.S. Henderson J.T. Woo M. Soengas M.S. Elia A. de la Pompa J.L. Kagi D. Khoo W. Potter J. Yoshida R. Kaufman S.A. Lowe S.W. Penninger J.M. Mak T.W. Cell. 1998; 94: 339-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). Subsequently, cytochrome c binds to Apaf-1 and, in association with adenine nucleotides, facilitates a conformational change of Apaf-1 to expose its CARD domain (35Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6183) Google Scholar, 36Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). Apaf-1 oligomerizes through the exposed CARD domain and recruits procaspase-9 by a homophilic interaction involving CARDs, which results in catalytic autoactivation of caspase-9. However, E2F-1 activates caspase-9 through a different pathway; it bypasses the translocation of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol and directly induces autoactivation of caspase-9 via the increase in intracellular Apaf-1 levels. The involvement of other direct activators of caspase-9, including a CARD-containing adapter Nod-1/CARD4 (29Inohara N. Koseki T. del Peso L., Hu, Y. Yee C. Chen S. Carrio R. Merino J. Liu D., Ni, J.

Subsequently, cytochrome c binds to Apaf-1 and, in association with adenine nucleotides, facilitates a conformational change of Apaf-1 to expose its CARD domain (35Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I.

Apaf-1 oligomerizes through the exposed CARD domain and recruits procaspase-9 by a homophilic interaction involving CARDs, which results in catalytic autoactivation of caspase-9. However, E2F-1 activates caspase-9 through a different pathway; it bypasses the translocation of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol and directly induces autoactivation of caspase-9 via the increase in intracellular Apaf-1 levels. The involvement of other direct activators of caspase-9, including a CARD-containing adapter Nod-1/CARD4 (29Inohara N. Koseki T. del Peso L., Hu, Y. Yee C. Chen S. Carrio R. Merino J. Liu D., Ni, J.

Cell. 2000; 102: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1959) Google Scholar), is to be determined because E2F-1 also modulates the expression of these molecules. Up-regulation of Apaf-1 is also observed during apoptosis caused by the adenoviral oncogene E1A, but it occurs as a secondary event of cytoplasmic accumulation of cytochrome c and therefore is distinct from that of E2F-1 (41Fearnhead H.O. Rodriguez J. Govek E.-E. Guo W. Kobayashi R. Hannon G. Lazebnik Y.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13664-13669Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism by which caspase-9 is activated by the increase in Apaf-1 is at present unclear, a high concentration of Apaf-1 may increase the probability of physical interaction between procaspase-9 molecules even in the absence of mitochondrial damage, resulting in oligomerization and subsequent autoactivation of procaspase-9. This hypothesis is substantiated by studies in which forced expression of Apaf-1 solely promoted apoptosis in human myeloid leukemia cell lines (42Perkins C. Kim C.N. Fang G. Bhalla K.N. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4561-4566PubMed Google Scholar, 43Perkins C. Fang G. Kim C.N. Bhalla K.N. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1645-1653PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, we provide evidence that Apaf-1 is a direct transcriptional target of E2F-1 by analyzing the 5′-untranslated regions of the Apaf-1 gene. This finding is consistent with the results of a recent effort to identify E2F-responsive genes by global analysis of gene expression using high density oligonucleotide arrays; Apaf-1 is one of the newly identified E2F-1-inducible genes (44Muller H. Bracken A.P. Vernell R. Moroni M.C. Christians F. Grassilli E. Prosperini E. Vigo E. Oliner J.D. Helin K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 267-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Interestingly, E2F-2 and E2F-3 did not up-regulate Apaf-1 in this analysis, which is consistent with the fact that E2F-1 has the strongest ability in promoting apoptosis among E2F family members (5DeGregori J. Leone G. Miron A. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7245-7250Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). However, there are some reports suggesting that other E2F proteins, especially E2F-2 and E2F-4, are also capable of inducing apoptosis (45Chang Y.-C. Nakajima H. Illenye S. Lee Y.-S. Honjo N. Makiyama T. Fujiwara I. Mizuta N. Sawai K. Saida K. Mitsui Y. Heintz N.H. Magae J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4713-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 46Dirks P.B. Rutka J.T. Hubbard S.L. Mondal S. Hamel P.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying apoptosis induced by E2F-2 and E2F-4 may be different from that of E2F-1, because E2F-2 and E2F-4 cannot transactivate Apaf-1 (44Muller H. Bracken A.P. Vernell R. Moroni M.C. Christians F. Grassilli E. Prosperini E. Vigo E. Oliner J.D. Helin K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 267-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 47Weinmann A.S. Yan P.S. Oberley M.J. Huang T.H.-M. Farnham P.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Because E2F-4 was not able to induce apoptosis in our system (data not shown), it is likely that E2F-4-mediated apoptosis involves p53-dependent pathways. The structure of the Apaf-1 promoter is characteristic; it lacks either a typical TATA motif or initiator elements and is devoid of canonical binding sites for known transcription factors except E2F, Sp-1, and p53. Instead, the Apaf-1 promoter shows an extremely high G and C content (>60%) with an observed/expected CpG ratio of greater than 0.8, which fulfills the requirement of a CpG island (21Gardiner-Garden M. Frommer M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 261-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar). These features suggest that methylation of the CpG island serves as the major mechanism of transcriptional regulation of Apaf-1. Indeed, Apaf-1 expression is defective in approximately half of melanoma cell lines, which is reversed by 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, an inhibitor of methylation (39Soengas M.S. Capodieci P. Polsky D. Mora J. Esteller M. Opitz-Araya X. McCombie R. Herman J.G. Gerald W.L. Lazebnik Y.A. Cordon-Cardo C. Lowe S.W. Nature. 2001; 409: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). This implies that the Apaf-1 gene is silenced by methylation of the CpG island, and the modulation of the methylation status alleviates the repression to induce Apaf-1 transcription. In this study, we demonstrated the binding of E2F-1 to the Apaf-1 promoter in E2F-1-overexpressing cells using the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. This result indicates that E2F-1 participates in the derepression of the Apaf-1 gene probably by affecting promoter methylation. The mechanisms by which E2F-1 modulates the methylation status of the Apaf-1 promoter are currently under investigation in our laboratory. While this manuscript was being prepared, an almost identical observation was published by Moroni et al. (48Moroni M.C. Hickman E.S. Denchi E.L. Caprara G. Colli E. Cecconi F. Mullar H. Helin K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Moreover, Fortin et al. (49Fortin A. Cregan S.P. MacLaurin J.G. Kushwaha N. Hickman E.S. Thompson C.S. Hakim A. Albert P.R. Cecconi F. Helin K. Park D.S. Slack R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) reported that p53 up-regulates Apaf-1 as a direct transcriptional target during neuronal cell death. Notably, the former study clearly demonstrated that cytoplasmic translocation of cytochrome c is accompanied by E2F-1-induced apoptosis, which contradicts our present finding. This contradiction may stem from the difference in the p53 status of host cells used in each study; p53 expression is defective in our cell line, whereas Moroni et al. (48Moroni M.C. Hickman E.S. Denchi E.L. Caprara G. Colli E. Cecconi F. Mullar H. Helin K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) used primary human fibroblasts and U2OS cells, both of which possess normal p53. Although our finding may be unique to p53-deficient cells, it instead makes two important points clear. First, E2F-1 can transactivate the Apaf-1 gene in the absence of p53. This is clinically important because most cancer cells lost the function of p53. Second, it is suggested that the E2F-1/Apaf-1 pathway (growth-associated intrinsic route) works in parallel with the p53/Bax/cytochrome c pathway (DNA damage-triggered extrinsic route) in promoting apoptotic cell death. In conclusion, these data demonstrate a novel mechanism of apoptosis in which an increase in Apaf-1 levels induced by E2F-1 results in direct activation of caspase-9 without mitochondrial damage, leading to the initiation of a caspase cascade. Because both E2F-1 and Apaf-1 are frequently deregulated in various pathologic conditions, this finding may contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of many diseases. We thank Drs. Tadashi Mayumi, Kiyoshi Kawakami, and Keiko Ikeda (Jichi Medical School) for helpful discussions. We are grateful to Yukiko Fukuda-Kamiyoshihara for excellent technical assistance."

Using yeast two-hybrid screening, we found that GSK-3β binds to AKAP220, which is known to act as an A-kinase anchoring protein. GSK-3β formed a complex with AKAP220 in intact cells at the endogenous level. Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and type 1 protein phosphatase (PP1) were also detected in this complex, suggesting that AKAP220, GSK-3β, PKA, and PP1 form a quaternary complex. It has been reported that PKA phosphorylates GSK-3β, thereby decreasing its activity. When COS cells were treated with dibutyryl cyclic AMP to activate PKA, the activity of GSK-3β bound to AKAP220 decreased more markedly than the total GSK-3β activity. Calyculin A, a protein phosphatase inhibitor, also inhibited the activity of GSK-3β bound to AKAP220 more strongly than the total GSK-3β activity.

The serine/threonine kinase GSK-31 was first described in a metabolic pathway for glycogen synthase regulation that is sensitive to insulin-mediated inhibition (1Plyte S.E. Hughes K. Nikolakaki E. Pulverer B.J. Woodgett J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1114: 147-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). GSK-3 subsequently has been shown to regulate several physiological responses including protein synthesis, gene expression, subcellular localization of proteins, and protein degradation in mammalian cells by phosphorylating many substrates (1Plyte S.E.

The substrates of GSK-3 include neuronal cell adhesion molecule, neurofilament, synapsin I, tau, transcription factors, adenomatous polyposis coli gene product, β-catenin, and cyclin D1. The cDNAs of GSK-3α and GSK-3β in mammals have been isolated, and they encode protein kinases with molecular masses of 51 and 47 kDa, respectively (4Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2431-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). GSK-3 is highly conserved through evolution and plays a fundamental role in cellular responses. For example, Xenopus GSK-3 determines the cell fate and regulates axis formation during early development (5He X. Saint-Jeannet J.-P. Woodgett J.R. Varmus H.E. Dawid I.B. Nature. 1995; 374: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 6Yost C. Torres M. Miller J.R. Huang E. Kimelman D. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1443-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). TheDrosophila zeste-white3/shaggy gene product is structurally and functionally homologous to GSK-3β (7Ruel L. Bourouis M. Heitzler P. Pantesco V. Simpson P. Nature. 1993; 362: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and is required at several developmental stages during fly embryogenesis for correct embryogenic segmentation (8Simpson P., El Messal M. Moscoso del Prado J. Ripoll P. Development. 1988; 103: 391-401Google Scholar, 9Perrimon N. Smouse D. Dev. Biol. 1989; 135: 287-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A Dictyosteliumhomolog of GSK-3 (GSKA) has been found to be important for cellular differentiation (10Harwood A.J. Plyte S.E. Woodgett J. Strutt H. Kay R.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 139-148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, theskp1+ gene product is a homolog of GSK-3 and regulates cytokinesis (11Plyte S.E. Feoktistova A. Burke J.D. Woodgett J.R. Gould K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 179-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, there are four genes, MCK1,MDS1/RIM11, MRK1, andYOL128c, which encode homologs of mammalian GSK-3. Mck1 acts in the transcriptional regulation of meiosis genes (12Neigeborn L. Mitchell A.P. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 533-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), the chromosomal segregation processes at mitosis (13Shero J.H. Hieter P. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 549-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), the cell cycle delay caused by the addition of Ca2+ (14Mizunuma M. Hirata D. Miyaoka R. Miyakawa T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1074-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and protein degradation (15Andoh T. Hirata Y. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6712-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, GSK-3 regulates various cellular functions. GSK-3 is a unique protein kinase in that many GSK-3 substrates require prior phosphorylation by a priming serine/threonine kinase to form the motif S-X-X-X-S(P) (S and Xindicate serine and any amino acid, respectively) before phosphorylation by GSK-3 (1Plyte S.E. Hughes K. Nikolakaki E. Pulverer B.J. Woodgett J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1114: 147-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 2Cohen P. Frame S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of GSK-3β has been determined (16Dajani R. Fraser E. Roe S.M. Young N. Good V. Dale T.C. Pearl L.H. Cell. 2001; 105: 721-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 17Frame S. Cohen P. Biondi R.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1321-1327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). The binding site for the priming phosphate on substrates of GSK-3β has been identified and found to contain three crucial basic residues, Arg96, Arg180, and Lys205. Other unique features of GSK-3 are that it is constitutively active and that various extracellular signals inhibit its activity. There are multiple regulatory mechanisms of GSK-3β in mammals (2Cohen P. Frame S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar, 3Grimes C.A. Jope R.S. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 391-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of GSK-3β is the most extensively studied mechanism of regulation. The activity of GSK-3β is decreased by phosphorylation of Ser9. Several kinases have been found to be capable of mediating this modification including p70 S6 kinase, p90Rsk, PKB, protein kinase C, and PKA (18Goode N. Hughes K. Woodgett J.R. Parker P.J. J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 20: 9356-9363Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). This inhibitory mechanism by phosphorylation of Ser9 is intimately connected with the unique substrate specificity requirements of GSK-3β. When Ser9 of GSK-3β is phosphorylated, it can interact with the same residues that are involved in the binding of the priming phosphate on substrates. This transforms the amino terminus into a “pseudosubstrate” inhibitor, thereby preventing substrates from binding to the catalytic center. The inhibition of GSK-3β might allow different signals to promote the dephosphorylation of some of the many proteins that have been identified as substrates of GSK-3β. However, the mechanism by which different signals inhibit GSK-3β efficiently and specifically is not known. PKA also has broad substrate specificity. Despite this, PKA has the ability to phosphorylate individual substrates selectively in response to discrete extracellular stimuli. Evidence that anchoring of the regulatory subunit of PKA to AKAPs targets PKA in close proximity to relevant substrates and confers that specificity in the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway has been accumulated (25Colledge M. Scott J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 216-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 26Edwards A.S. Scott J.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 27Feliciello A. Gottesman M.E. Avvedimento E.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 99-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). AKAPs were first identified as proteins that co-purified with the PKA holoenzyme. Although there are more than 40 unique members in the AKAP protein family, there is no overall sequence similarity among different AKAPs. They are characterized by their interaction with type I or II regulatory subunits of the PKA holoenzyme. AKAPs also possess unique target sequences that direct the PKA-AKAP complex to cellular compartments. Furthermore, some have the ability to maintain signaling scaffolds by simultaneously associating with other kinases and phosphatases. For example, AKAP220 has been shown to bind to the catalytic subunit of PP1 in addition to PKA (28Lester L.B. Coghlan V.M. Nauert B. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9460-9465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 29Schillace R.V. Scott J.D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 321-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). When thus bound, PP1 is inhibited, suggesting that AKAP220 functions to regulate phosphatase activity (30Schillace R.V. Voltz J.W. Sim A.T.R. Shenolikar S. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12128-12134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, the physiological significance of the complex formation of PKA with AKAP220 is not known. While analyzing the modes of activation and action of GSK-3β we found that GSK-3β binds directly to AKAP220. Here we show that GSK-3β, PKA, PP1, and AKAP220 form a complex. Furthermore, we demonstrate that GSK-3β complexed with AKAP220 is regulated by PKA and PP1 more efficiently than GSK-3β free from AKAP220. These results suggest that one of the mechanisms by which PKA regulates GSK-3β is mediated by AKAP220. Plasmids that cover human AKAP220 (hAKAP220) nucleotides −175–5413 and 3866–9748 were kindly supplied by Drs. K. Taskén (University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway) (31Reinton N. Collas P. Haugen T.B.

Human GSK-3β cDNA was provided by Dr. J. R. Woodgett (Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Canada). The anti-MBP and anti-GST antibodies were prepared in rabbits by immunization with recombinant MBP and GST, respectively. MBP and GST fusion proteins were purified from Escherichia coli according to the manufacturer's instructions. The anti-Myc antibody was prepared from 9E10 cells. COS, PC12, and 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum, 10% fetal calf serum and 5% horse serum, and 10% fetal calf serum, respectively. The anti-AKAP220, anti-AKAP149, anti-GSK-3β, anti-PP2Ac, anti-PP1c, mouse monoclonal anti-PKARIIα, and anti-PKAc antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The anti-GSK-3α, rabbit polyclonal anti-PKARIIα, anti-HA (16B12), and anti-GFP antibodies were from Upstate biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), Covance, and Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR), respectively. [γ-32P]ATP was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. pBTM116HA/GSK-3β, pCGN/GSK-3β, pCGN/GSK-3βK85M, pCGN/GSK-3βY216F, and pGEX-2T/GSK-3β were constructed as described (32Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). Standard recombinant DNA techniques were used to construct the following plasmids: pCGN/hAKAP220 (full length), pCGN/hAKAP220-(1–1108), pCGN/hAKAP220-(1011–1901), pEF-BOS-Myc/hAKAP220-(1011–1901), pEF-BOS-Myc/hAKAP220-(1011–1455), pEF-BOS-Myc/hAKAP220-(1017–1316), pEF-BOS-Myc/hAKAP220-(1316–1445), pEF-BOS-Myc/hAKAP220-(1456–1901), pMAL-c2/hAKAP220-(1011–1901), and pCGN/GSK-3βS9A, where Ser9 is mutated to Ala. In these plasmids, some plasmids were constructed by digesting the original plasmids with restriction enzymes and inserting the resultant fragments into the vectors. The other constructions were performed by inserting the fragments generated using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) into the vectors. The entire PCR products were sequenced, and the structures of all plasmids were confirmed by restriction analyses. To determine whether AKAP220 forms a complex with GSK-3β, GSK-3α, PKA, PP1, or PP2A at the endogenous level, PC12 cells (100-mm diameter dish) were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 5 mm NaF). The lysates (500 μg of protein) were immunoprecipitated with anti-AKAP220, anti-Myc, anti-GSK-3β, anti-GFP, or anti-PKARIIα antibody, and then the immunoprecipitates were probed with the anti-AKAP220, anti-PKARIIα, anti-GSK-3β, anti-PKAc, anti-GSK-3α, anti-PP1c, and anti-PP2Ac antibodies. To demonstrate the complex formation of the deletion mutants of AKAP220 with GSK-3β, PKA, and PP1 in intact cells, COS cells (60-mm diameter dish) transfected with pEF-BOS-Myc- or pCGN-derived plasmids were lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer. The lysates (200 μg of protein) were immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA, anti-Myc, anti-GFP, or anti-PKARIIα antibody, and then the precipitates were probed with the anti-HA, anti-Myc, anti-GSK-3β, and anti-PKARIIα antibodies. In these experiments, the rabbit polyclonal anti-PKARIIα antibody was used for immunoprecipitation and the mouse monoclonal anti-PKARIIα antibody was used for immunoblotting. In another experiment to show the complex formation of AKAP220, the lysates (250 μg of protein) of PC12 cells were incubated with GST-PP1cα or GST (35 pmol of each) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B for 1 h at 4 °C. After GST-PP1cα or GST was precipitated by centrifugation, the precipitates were probed with the anti-GSK-3β and anti-AKAP220 antibodies. To examine the direct interaction of AKAP220 with GSK-3β using the purified proteinsin vitro, 0.6 μm GST-GSK-3β was incubated with MBP-AKAP220-(1011–1901) or MBP (15 pmol of each) immobilized on amylose resin in 50 μl of reaction mixture (20 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% CHAPS) for 1 h at 4 °C. After MBP-AKAP220-(1011–1901) was precipitated by centrifugation, the precipitates were probed with the anti-GST antibody. To determine whether AKAP149 forms a complex with GSK-3β or PKA at the endogenous level, 293 cells (60-mm diameter dish) were lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer. The lysates (1 mg of protein) were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Myc, anti-AKAP149, anti-GFP, or anti-PKARIIα antibody, and then the immunoprecipitates were probed with the anti-AKAP149, anti-PKARIIα, anti-GSK-3β, and anti-PKAc antibodies. COS cells (60-mm diameter dish) expressing Myc-AKAP220-(1011–1901), Myc-AKAP220-(1011–1455), or Myc-AKAP220-(1456–1901) were lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer. After the lysates (200 μg of protein) had been immunoprecipitated with the anti-GSK-3β or anti-Myc antibody, the immunoprecipitates were washed once with lysis buffer and three times with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and then incubated with 50 μm GS peptide 1 (YRRAAVPPSPSLSRHSSPHQSEDEEE) or GS peptide 2 (YRRAAVPPSPSLSRHSSPHQS(P)EDEEE) in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (400–800 cpm/pmol) for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction mixture was then spotted onto phosphocellulose filters (Whatman P81) and washed with phosphoric acid (33Welsh G.I. Foulstone E.J. Young S.W. Tavaré J.M. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 34Murai H. Okazaki M. Kikuchi A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The activity of GSK-3β was calculated by subtracting the activity of phosphorylation of GS peptide 1 from that of phosphorylation of GS peptide 2. When effects of Bt2cAMP on wild-type GSK-3β and GSK-3βS9A were compared, Myc-AKAP220-(1011–1901) was expressed with HA-GSK-3β (wild type) or HA-GSK-3βS9A in COS cells. Yeast two-hybrid screening was carried out as described (32Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar, 35Ikeda M. Ishida O. Hinoi T. Kishida S. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 814-821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using bovine serum albumin as a standard (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). To discover new functions of GSK-3β, we attempted to identify a GSK-3β-binding protein(s) and screened a mouse brain cDNA library by the yeast two-hybrid screen using wild-type GSK-3β as bait. When ∼5 × 105 transformants were screened, several clones were found to confer both His+ and LacZ+ phenotypes, and one clone was found to encode the carboxyl-terminal region of mouse AKAP220. AKAP220 was originally identified as an A-kinase anchoring protein with a molecular mass of 220 kDa (28Lester L.B. Coghlan V.M. Nauert B. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9460-9465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Among various cells tested (including COS, CHO-IR, 293, L, PC12, Rat-1, SW480, NIH3T3, F9, DLD, and C57MG), we detected significant expression of AKAP220 in PC12 cells, a line of rat pheochromocytoma cells (data not shown). Because GSK-3β was detected more than GSK-3α in PC12 cells (Fig.1 A, lane 1), we examined whether AKAP220 forms a complex with GSK-3β in PC12 cells. When the lysates of PC12 cells were immunoprecipitated with the anti-AKAP220 antibody, PKARIIα and PKAc were detected in the AKAP220 immune complex (Fig. 1 A, lane 3). Furthermore, GSK-3β was also observed in the immune complex (Fig. 1 A,lane 3). When the lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Myc antibody as a control, neither PKA nor GSK-3β was co-precipitated (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). When the lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-PKARIIα antibody, AKAP220 and GSK-3β were observed in addition to PKAc in the PKARIIα immune complex (Fig. 1 A, lanes 4 and5). Reciprocally, AKAP220 and PKARIIα were co-precipitated with GSK-3β (Fig. 1 A, lanes 6 and7). GSK-3α was not observed in the AKAP220 complex (Fig.1 A, lane 3), but this might have been because of the low detection of GSK-3α protein by the antibody that we used. AKAP149, another AKAP family member, formed a complex with PKA but not with GSK-3β (Fig. 1 B). These results indicate that GSK-3β and PKA form a complex with AKAP220 in intact cells at the endogenous level. Various constructs of AKAP220 used in this study are shown in Fig.2. To examine which region of AKAP220 is necessary for the complex formation with GSK-3β, HA-AKAP220 (full length), HA-AKAP220-(1–1108), or HA-AKAP220-(1011–1901) was expressed in COS cells (Fig. 3 A,lanes 1–4). Endogenous GSK-3β was complexed with HA-AKAP220 (full length) and HA-AKAP220-(1011–1901) but not with HA-AKAP220-(1–1108) (Fig. 3 A, lanes 5–8). These results indicate that GSK-3β forms a complex with the carboxyl-terminal region of AKAP220. To further analyze the binding region, various deletion mutants of Myc-AKAP220 were expressed in COS cells. GSK-3β was co-precipitated with Myc-AKAP220-(1011–1901), Myc-AKAP220-(1011–1455), and Myc-AKAP220-(1017–1316) but not with Myc-AKAP220-(1316–1445) and Myc-AKAP220-(1456–1901) (Fig.3 B). These results demonstrate that GSK-3β forms a complex with a region within amino acids 1017–1316 of AKAP220. Axin is another GSK-3-binding protein and plays an essential role in the Wnt signaling pathway (32Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). Previously we showed that two kinase-inactive mutants of GSK-3β, GSK-3βK85M and GSK-3βY216F, do not associate with Axin (32Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). In contrast to Axin, AKAP220 associated with both kinase-inactive mutants as well as wild-type GSK-3β (Fig.3 C), suggesting that AKAP220 and Axin associate with GSK-3β in different manners. To examine whether GSK-3β binds to AKAP220 directly, MBP-AKAP220-(1011–1901) and GST-GSK-3β were purified (Fig. 3 D, lanes 1 and 3). GST-GSK-3β but not GST precipitated with MBP-AKAP220-(1011–1901) immobilized on amylose resin, and GST-GSK-3β did not precipitate with MBP (Fig. 3 D, lanes 5–7). These results indicate that the binding of GSK-3β and AKAP220 is direct. To examine whether GSK-3β complexed with AKAP220 is active, the kinase assay was performed. In this assay GS peptides 1 and 2 were used as substrates. It is known that GSK-3β specifically phosphorylates GS peptide 2 but not GS peptide 1 (33Welsh G.I. Foulstone E.J. Young S.W. Tavaré J.M. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). When the lysates expressing Myc-AKAP220-(1011–1901) were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Myc antibody, the activity to phosphorylate GS peptide 2 was observed specifically in the Myc-AKAP220-(1011–1901) immune complex (Fig.3 E), indicating that active GSK-3β forms a complex with AKAP220. Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 3 B, GSK-3β activity was observed in the Myc-AKAP220-(1011–1455) immune complex but not in the Myc-AKAP220-(1456–1901) immune complex (Fig. 3 E).Figure 3Determination of the GSK-3 β-binding site on AKAP220. A, interaction of the AKAP220 deletion mutants with GSK-3β in intact cells. The lysates (20 μg of protein) of COS cells expressing HA-AKAP220 deletion mutants were probed with the anti-HA and anti-GSK-3β antibodies (lanes 2–4). The same lysates (200 μg of protein) were immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were probed with the anti-HA and anti-GSK-3β antibodies (lanes 6–8). The lysates of COS cells transfected with empty vectors were used as a control (lanes 1 and 5). Arrowheads indicate expression of HA-AKAP220 (full length) or its mutants.

The same lysates (200 μg of protein) were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Myc antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were probed with the anti-Myc and anti-GSK-3β antibodies (lanes 7–11).

The lysates of COS cells transfected with empty vectors were used as a control (lane 1). WT, wild type. D, direct interaction of AKAP220 with GSK-3β. Purified proteins (0.5 μg of each protein) used in this experiment were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (lanes 1–4). GST-GSK-3β or GST (0.6 μm) was incubated with MBP-AKAP220-(1011–1901) (lanes 5 and 6) or MBP (lane 7) (15 pmol of each) immobilized on amylose resin, and then MBP-AKAP220-(1011–1901) and MBP were precipitated by centrifugation. The precipitates were probed with the anti-GST antibody. Results shown are representative of three independent experiments. E, activity of GSK-3β in the AKAP220 complex. After the lysates (200 μg of protein) of COS cells expressing Myc-AKAP220-(1011–1901) (lanes 1 and 2), Myc-AKAP220-(1011–1455) (lanes 3 and 4), or Myc-AKAP220-(1456–1901) (lanes 5 and 6) had been immunoprecipitated with the anti-Myc antibody, the immunoprecipitates were incubated with GS peptide 1 (lanes 1, 3, and5) or GS peptide 2 (lanes 2, 4, and6). The activities of phosphorylation of GS peptides 1 and 2 were measured. Results shown are expressed as means ± S.E. from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It has been shown that AKAP220 binds to PP1 in addition to PKA (29Schillace R.V. Scott J.D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 321-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether GSK-3β, PKA, and PP1 bind simultaneously to AKAP220. The site of AKAP220 that binds to PKA is the region within amino acid residues 1650–1663 (31Reinton N. Collas P. Haugen T.B. Skålhegg B.S. Hansson V. Jahnsen T. Taskén K. Dev. Biol. 2000; 223: 194-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). When various deletion mutants of Myc-AKAP220 were expressed in COS cells and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-PKARIIα antibody, AKAP220-(1011–1901) and AKAP220-(1456–1901) but not AKAP220-(1011–1455) formed a complex with PKARIIα (Fig.4 A), consistent with the previous report (31Reinton N. Collas P. Haugen T.B. Skålhegg B.S. Hansson V. Jahnsen T. Taskén K. Dev. Biol. 2000; 223: 194-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Taken together with the observation that GSK-3β interacts with AKAP220-(1017–1316), these results clearly demonstrate that GSK-3β and PKA bind to the different sites of AKAP220. It has been reported that PP1 binds to residues 1195–1198 of AKAP220 (29Schillace R.V. Scott J.D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 321-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar,31Reinton N. Collas P. Haugen T.B. Skålhegg B.S. Hansson V. Jahnsen T. Taskén K. Dev. Biol. 2000; 223: 194-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Indeed, PP1 was observed with GSK-3β and PKA in the AKAP220 immune complex when the lysates of PC12 cells were immunoprecipitated with the anti-AKAP220 antibody (Fig. 4 B). Under the same conditions, PP2A was only slightly immunoprecipitated with AKAP220 (Fig. 4 B). When the lysates of PC12 cells were incubated with GST-PP1cα, endogenous GSK-3β and AKAP220 were detected in the GST-PP1cα complex (Fig. 4 C). Furthermore, overexpression of HA-PP1cα did not affect the complex formation of GSK-3β and Myc-AKAP-(1011–1901) (Fig. 4 D). Although we did not definitively conclude that the sites of AKAP220 that bind to PP1 and GSK-3β are different, it is likely that GSK-3β, PKA, and PP1 can bind to AKAP220 simultaneously and that they form a quaternary complex. Finally we examined the physiological significance of the binding of GSK-3β to AKAP220. Because PKA and PP1 regulate the GSK-3β activity (23Fang X., Yu, S.X., Lu, Y. Bast Jr., R.C. Woodgett J.R.

https://openalex.org/W2052833744,"We have studied the regulation of AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid) receptor channels by serotonin signaling in pyramidal neurons of prefrontal cortex (PFC). Application of serotonin reduced the amplitude of AMPA-evoked currents, an effect mimicked by 5-HT1Areceptor agonists and blocked by 5-HT1A antagonists, indicating the mediation by 5-HT1A receptors. The serotonergic modulation of AMPA receptor currents was blocked by protein kinase A (PKA) activators and occluded by PKA inhibitors. Inhibiting the catalytic activity of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) also eliminated the effect of serotonin on AMPA currents. Furthermore, the serotonergic modulation of AMPA currents was occluded by application of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) inhibitors and blocked by intracellular injection of calmodulin or recombinant CaMKII. Application of serotonin or 5-HT1Aagonists to PFC slices reduced CaMKII activity and the phosphorylation of AMPA receptor subunit GluR1 at the CaMKII site in a PP1-dependent manner. We concluded that serotonin, by activating 5-HT1A receptors, suppress glutamatergic signaling through the inhibition of CaMKII, which is achieved by the inhibition of PKA and ensuing activation of PP1. This modulation demonstrates the critical role of CaMKII in serotonergic regulation of PFC neuronal activity, which may explain the neuropsychiatric behavioral phenotypes seen in CaMKII knockout mice.

Changes in serotonin receptors, the serotonin transporter, and serotonin release have been found in PFC from subjects with schizophrenia and depression (3Sumiyoshi T. Stockmeier C.A. Overholser J.C.

Disturbed serotonergic neurotransmission as well as altered activity of PFC are considered as characteristic features of neuropsychiatric disorders (6Breier A. Schizophr.

Many effective drugs that constitute a major advance in the treatment of mental disorders primarily target the serotonin system (9Fuxe K. Ogren S.O. Agnati L.F. Benfenati F. Fredholm B. Andersson K. Zini I. Eneroth P. Neuropharmacology. 1983; 22: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 10Meltzer H.Y. Clin. Neurosci. 1995; 3: 64-75PubMed Google Scholar, 11Busatto G.F. Kerwin R.W. J. Psychopharmacol. 1997; 11: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In addition to serotonin, it has been found that glutamate receptors are altered in selective brain regions of schizophrenia patients (12Harrison P.J. McLaughlin D. Kerwin R.W. Lancet. 1991; 337: 450-452Abstract PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 13Sokolov B.P. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2454-2464Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and chronic administration of antipsychotic drugs causes the change of glutamate receptors (14Fitzgerald L.W. Deutch A.Y. Nestler E.J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2453-2461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), implying a role for cortical glutamatergic dysfunction in mental diseases (15Bachus S.E. Kleinman J.E. J. Clin. Psychiatry. 1996; 57 Suppl. 11: 72-83PubMed Google Scholar). These studies suggest that one important target of serotonin could be the postsynaptic glutamate receptors and dysregulation of glutamatergic transmission by altered serotonin system may be responsible for the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. The pleiotropic functions of serotonin are afforded by the concerted actions of multiple serotonin receptor subtypes. The 5-HT receptors are composed of several families that can be grouped on the basis of conserved structures and signaling mechanisms (16Martin G.R. Eglen R.M. Hamblin M.W. Hoyer D. Yocca F. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 2-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Multiple G-protein-coupled 5-HT receptors have been identified in glutamatergic PFC pyramidal neurons (17Goldman-Rakic P.S. Lidow M.S. Gallager D.W. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 2125-2138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Feng J. Cai X. Zhao J.H. Yan Z. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6502-6511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although previous studies have shown that serotonin can play both inhibitory and excitatory roles in neuronal networks through the coupling of different 5-HT receptors to distinct ion channels (19Andrade R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 861: 190-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), it remains unclear how these receptors may regulate postsynaptic glutamatergic signaling in PFC. The fast excitatory synaptic transmission is mediated primarily by AMPA-type glutamate receptors in PFC. The AMPA receptor is an oligomeric complex composed of four subunits GluR1–4 (20Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3660) Google Scholar). Changes in postsynaptic AMPA receptors have been implicated in synaptic plasticity (21Bliss T.V.P. Collingridge G.L. Nature. 1993; 361: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (9539) Google Scholar), and one important mechanism is the alteration of the phosphorylation state of AMPA receptors (22Roche K.W. Tingley W.G. Huganir R.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1994; 4: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Multiple protein kinases and phosphatases have been shown to modulate AMPA receptor functions (23Greengard P. Jen J. Nairn A.C. Stevens C.F.

Here we report that serotonin, by activating 5-HT1A receptors, produced a reduction of AMPA-evoked currents in PFC pyramidal neurons. This regulation of postsynaptic AMPA receptors is through a CaMKII-mediated mechanism, which is operated by activated PP1. Given the critical role of glutamatergic transmission in controlling synaptic plasticity and neuronal activity, our results may provide a molecular and cellular mechanism for 5-HT1A/CaMKII regulation of PFC functions. PFC neurons from young adult (3–5 weeks postnatal) rats were acutely dissociated using procedures similar to those described previously (28Yan Z. Surmeier D.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2592-2604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out with the approval of the State University of New York at Buffalo Animal Care Committee. In brief, rats were anesthetized by inhaling 2-bromo-2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane (1 ml/100 g, Sigma) and decapitated; brains were quickly removed, iced, and then blocked for slicing. The blocked tissue was cut in 400-μm slices with a Vibrotome while bathed in a low Ca2+ (100 μm), HEPES-buffered salt solution (in mm: 140 isethionic acid sodium salt, 2 KCl, 4 MgCl2, 0.1 CaCl2, 23 glucose, 15 HEPES, 1 kynurenic acid, pH 7.4, 300–305 mosm). Slices were then incubated for 1–6 h at room temperature (20–22 °C) in a NaHCO3-buffered saline bubbled with 95% O2, 5% CO2 (in mm: 126 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 26 NaHCO3, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 10 glucose, 1 pyruvic acid, 0.05 glutathione, 0.1 NG-nitro-l-arginine, 1 kynurenic acid, pH = 7.4, 300–305 mosm). All reagents were obtained from Sigma. Slices were then removed into the low Ca2+ buffer, and regions of the PFC were dissected and placed in an oxygenated Cell-Stir chamber (Wheaton, Inc., Millville, NJ) containing protease (1.2–1.4 mg/ml, Sigma) in HEPES-buffered Hanks' balanced salt solution (Sigma) at 35 °C. After 30 min of enzyme digestion, tissue was rinsed three times in the low Ca2+, HEPES-buffered saline and mechanically dissociated with a graded series of fire-polished Pasteur pipettes. The cell suspension was then plated into a 35-mm Lux Petri dish, which was then placed on the stage of a Nikon inverted microscope. Freshly dissociated neurons were precipitated on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips. After 10 min, they were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min and were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Following 1-h incubation with 10% bovine serum albumin to block nonspecific staining, the cells were incubated with the polyclonal GluR1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., 1:1000) and monoclonal MAP2 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., 1:1000) at 4 °C overnight. After washing off the primary antibodies, the cells were incubated with a fluorescein-conjugated and a rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma, 1:200) for 50 min at room temperature. For the staining of F-actin, the cells were incubated with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, 1:5000) for 20 min at room temperature. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline for three times, the coverslips were mounted on slides with VECTASHIELD mounting media (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Fluorescent images were obtained using a Bio-Rad confocal microscope with a 100× oil lens. Whole-cell recordings of currents employed standard voltage clamp techniques (29Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15138) Google Scholar, 30Yan Z. Surmeier D.J. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1115-1126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Electrodes were pulled from Corning 7052 glass and fire-polished prior to use. The internal solution consisted of (in mm): 180N-methyl-d-glucamine, 40 HEPES, 4 MgCl2, 0.5 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA), 12 phosphocreatine, 2 Na2ATP, 0.2 Na3GTP, 0.1 leupeptin, pH 7.2–3, 265–270 mosm. The external solution consisted of (in mm): 135 NaCl, 20 CsCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 0.001 TTX, 5 BaCl2, 10 glucose, pH 7.3, 300–305 mosm. Recordings were obtained with an Axon Instruments 200B patch clamp amplifier that was controlled and monitored with a IBM PC running pCLAMP (version 8) with a DigiData 1320 series interface (Axon instruments, Union City, CA). Electrode resistances were typically 2–4 MΩ in the bath. After seal rupture, series resistance (4–10 MΩ) was compensated (70–90%) and periodically monitored. Care was exercised to monitor the constancy of the series resistance, and recordings were terminated whenever a significant increase (>20%) occurred. The cell membrane potential was held at −70 mV. The application of AMPA (100 μm) or glutamate (1 mm) evoked a fast desensitizing inward current. Peak and steady-state values were measured for generating the plot as a function of time and drug application. AMPA or glutamate was applied for 1 or 2 s every 30 s to minimize desensitization-induced decrease of current amplitude. Drugs were applied with a gravity-fed “sewer pipe” system. The array of application capillaries (approximately 150-μm inner diameter) was positioned a few hundred microns from the cell under study. Solution changes were effected by the SF-77B fast-step solution stimulus delivery device (Warner Instrument Co., Hamden, CT). Serotonin receptor ligands serotonin, R(+)-8-OH-DPAT, NAN-190, 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT), WAY-100635, 2,5-dimethoxy-4- iodoamphetamine (DOI), 5-methoxytryptamine, ketanserin, and SDZ205557 (Sigma/RBI, St. Louis, MO), as well as second messenger reagents Sp-cAMPS, Rp-cAMPS, PKI-(5–24), okadaic acid (OA), okadaic acid methyl ester (OAE), KN-93, KN-92, KN-62, calmodulin, recombinant CaMKII α subunit, and calcineurin autoinhibitory peptide (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) were made up as concentrated stocks and stored at −20 °C. Stocks were thawed and diluted immediately prior to use. Serotonin was prepared freshly for every experiment. The amino acid sequence for the phosphorylated I-1 peptide pThr35I-1-(7–39) was: PRKIQFTVPLLEPHLDPEAAEQIRRRRP(pT)PATL. Data analyses were performed with AxoGraph (Axon Instruments Inc.), Kaleidagraph (Albeck Software, Reading, PA), and Statview (Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkeley, CA). Box plots were used for graphic presentation of the data because of the small sample sizes (31Tukey J.W. Exploratory Data Analysis. Addison-Wesley, Menlo Park, CA1977Google Scholar). The box plot represents the distribution as a box with the median as a central line and the hinges as the edges of the box (the hinges divide the upper and lower distributions in half). The inner fences run to the limits of the distribution. For analysis of statistical significance, Mann-Whitney U tests were performed to compare the current amplitudes in the presence or absence of various agonists. ANOVA tests were performed to compare the differential degrees of current modulation between groups subjected to different treatment. The whole-cell voltage-clamp technique was used to evaluate the regulation of spontaneous and miniature excitatory synaptic currents by 5-HT1A receptors in PFC slices. Patch electrodes (5–9 megohms) were filled with the following internal solution (in mm): 130 cesium methanesulfonate, 10 CsCl, 4 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 1 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 12 phosphocreatine, 5 MgATP, 0.2 Na3GTP, 0.1 leupeptin, pH 7.2–7.3, 265–270 mosm. The slice (300 μm) was placed in a perfusion chamber attached to the fixed-stage of an upright microscope (Olympus) and submerged in continuously flowing oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid. It takes about 1 min to change solutions completely in the perfusion chamber. Cells were visualized with a 40X water-immersion lens and illuminated with near infrared (IR) light and the image was detected with an IR-sensitive charge-coupled device camera. Multiclamp 700A amplifier was used for these recordings. Tight seals (2–10 gigohms) from visualized pyramidal neurons were obtained by applying negative pressure. The membrane was disrupted with additional suction, and the whole cell configuration was obtained. The access resistances ranged from 13 to 18 megohms. Cells were held at −70 mV for the continuous recording of EPSCs. To evaluate the regulation of miniature excitatory synaptic currents by 5-HT1A receptors in PFC cultures, the whole-cell voltage-clamp technique was used. PFC primary cultures were prepared as previously described (32Hayashi K. Shirao T. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3918-3925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, frontal cortical neurons from E18 rats were dissociated and plated onto culture dishes. After 6–8 daysin vivo, cells were used for recording. The same internal and external solutions as those for dissociated cell recordings were used. The membrane potential was held at −70 mV. Synaptic activities were analyzed with Mini Analysis Program (Synaptosoft, Leonia, NJ). All quantitative measurements (1 min of events) were taken 3–4 min (slice) or 1–2 min (culture) after drug application. Statistical comparisons of the amplitude of synaptic currents (mean ± S.E.) were made using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test. After incubation, slices were transferred to boiling 1% SDS and homogenized immediately. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 10 min), and the protein concentration for each sample was measured. Equal amounts of protein from slice homogenates were separated on 7.5% acrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. Then the blots were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Antibodies used include: anti-Thr286-phosphorylated CaMKII (Promega, 1:2000), anti-CaMKII (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., 1:2000), anti-Ser831-phosphorylated GluR1 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., 1:500), and anti-GluR1 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., 1:2000). After being rinsed, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (Amersham Biosciences, 1:2000) for 1 h at room temperature. Following three washes, the blots were exposed to the enhanced chemiluminescence substrate. Quantitation was obtained from densitometric measurements of immunoreactive bands on films. Data correspond to the mean ± S.E. values and were analyzed by ANOVA tests for statistical significance. To test the potential impact of serotonin on postsynaptic AMPA receptors in PFC, we first examined the effect of serotonin on AMPA receptor-mediated currents in dissociated pyramidal neurons located in the intermediate and deep layers (III–VI) of the rat PFC. Acutely isolated PFC pyramidal neurons were readily distinguished from GABAergic interneurons by their distinct morphological features: a pyramidal-shaped soma and a prominent apical dendrite (18Feng J. Cai X. Zhao J.H. Yan Z. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6502-6511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The confocal image of double-immunocytochemical labeling with GluR1 (an AMPA receptor subunit) and MAP2 (a dendritic marker) in a representative dissociated PFC pyramidal neuron is shown in Fig.1 A. It is evident that the dissociated neuron has not only elaborate dendritic processes but also densely located spines, where the majority of glutamatergic inputs is received. GluR1 is highly enriched in dendritic spines and shafts in the dissociated PFC pyramidal neuron, confirming that the subcellular localization of AMPA receptors is well preserved. Given the enrichment of F-actin in dendritic spines, we also co-stained the dissociated PFC pyramidal neurons with F-actin and MAP2, to confirm that the small protrusions along dendritic arbors were indeed spines (Fig.1 A, inset). Double staining of GluR1 and F-actin indicated that they were highly co-localized (data not shown). Application of AMPA (100 μm) elicited an inward current that consisted of two major components: a fast-desensitizing peak and a non-desensitizing sustained part (Fig. 1 B). The AMPA-evoked current was completely blocked by the non-NMDA antagonist CNQX (10 μm, n = 3), indicating that it is mediated primarily by AMPA receptors. Serotonin decreased both the transient peak and the steady-state AMPA current (Fig. 1,B–D). The modulation was reversible and took 1–3 min to stabilize. In 87.5% of PFC pyramidal neurons we tested (n = 104), bath application of 5-HT (20 μm) caused a significant reduction in the amplitude of AMPA-evoked currents (peak, 15.1 ± 0.9%; steady-state, 17.9 ± 0.9%; mean ± S.E., n = 90, p < 0.01, Mann-Whitney U test). The desensitization kinetics of AMPA currents was not significantly altered by 5-HT. Serotonin also reduced the amplitude of glutamate (1 mm)-evoked currents that are mainly mediated by AMPA receptor activation (peak, 14.0 ± 1.5%; steady-state, 14.3 ± 0.5%; n = 22, p < 0.01, Mann-Whitney U test). Since multiple 5-HT receptors are simultaneously expressed in individual PFC pyramidal neurons (18Feng J. Cai X. Zhao J.H. Yan Z. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6502-6511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we next used subtype-specific agonists and antagonists to examine which 5-HT receptor was involved in the modulation of AMPA currents. 5-HT1A, 5-HT2Aand 5-HT4 are among the most prominent serotonin receptor subtypes expressed in PFC pyramidal neurons, so we first examined the potential role of these receptors in the modulation of AMPA currents. In a sample of PFC pyramidal neurons we tested, AMPA currents were not significantly affected by the 5-HT2 receptor agonist DOI (20 μm, 1.0 ± 0.6%, mean ± S.E.,n = 5, p > 0.05, Mann-WhitneyU test) or the 5-HT4 receptor agonist 5-methoxytryptamine (20 μm, 2.7 ± 1.9%,n = 8, p > 0.05, Mann-WhitneyU test), suggesting that the serotonergic effect on AMPA receptors was not mediated by 5-HT2 or 5-HT4receptors. On the other hand, application of the 5-HT1Areceptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT (20 μm) significantly reduced the amplitude of AMPA currents (peak, 15.7 ± 1.8%; steady-state, 13.8 ± 1.0%; mean ± S.E., n = 34,p < 0.01, Mann-Whitney U test) in ∼90% of the PFC pyramidal neurons tested (an example is shown in Fig. 1,B–D), mimicking the inhibitory effect of 5-HT. As summarized in Fig. 1 E, 5-HT and 8-OH-DPAT decreased the amplitude of both peak and steady-state AMPA currents to similar extents. To verify that 5-HT1A receptors were mediating the modulation seen with 8-OH-DPAT or 5-HT, the ability of 5-HT1A antagonist NAN-190 to prevent the action of 8-OH-DPAT or 5-HT was examined. As shown in Fig.2, NAN-190 (20 μm) almost completely eliminated the effects of 5-HT (Fig. 2 A) or 8-OH-DPAT (Fig. 2 B). Removing the antagonist restored the ability of 5-HT or 8-OH-DPAT to modulate AMPA currents. Fig. 2 C summarized the effects of 5-HT1A agonists on AMPA currents in the absence or presence of various antagonists. The median reduction of peak AMPA currents by 8-OH-DPAT was 17.1% (n = 10), similar to the 5-HT effect (median reduction: 16.4%, n = 9). In the presence of NAN-190, the inhibition of AMPA currents by 5-HT (n = 9) or 8-OH-DPAT (n = 10) was both significantly blocked (median reduction: 1.3% and 1.9%, respectively,p < 0.01, ANOVA). However, in the presence of the 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin (20 μm,n = 5) or the 5-HT4 antagonist SDZ205557 (20 μm, n = 7), 5-HT reduction of AMPA currents was not altered (median reduction of peak currents: 16.5% and 13.2%, respectively, data not shown). Another 5-HT1Areceptor agonist 5-CT (20 μm) also decreased the amplitude of AMPA currents (median reduction of peak currents: 11.4%,n = 7), and this effect was significantly attenuated in the presence of another 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635 (20 μm, median reduction of peak currents: 1.0%,n = 5, p < 0.01, ANOVA). These results suggest that the serotonergic effect on AMPA receptor channels is mediated by 5-HT1A receptors, consistent with the abundant expression of 5-HT1A receptors in almost all PFC pyramidal neurons detected with the single cell mRNA profiling method (18Feng J. Cai X. Zhao J.H. Yan Z. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6502-6511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To understand the impact of 5-HT1A receptors on glutamatergic synaptic transmission, we examined the effect of 8-OH-DPAT on AMPA receptor-mediated excitatory synaptic currents (EPSCs). Spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSCs) and miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) were recorded in PFC pyramidal neurons in acute slices and primary cultures. Application of CNQX (10 μm) blocked both sEPSCs and mEPSCs (n = 5), indicating that these synaptic currents are mainly mediated by AMPA receptors. As shown in Fig.3 (A and B), bath application of 8-OH-DPAT to the PFC slice reversibly reduced the sEPSC amplitude by 20.1% (p < 0.01, K-S test). In nine PFC pyramidal neurons we examined, 8-OH-DPAT decreased the mean amplitude of sEPSCs by 19.5 ± 1.8% (mean ± S.E., n = 7, p < 0.01, K-S test). The frequency of sEPSCs was also reduced by 8-OH-DPAT (57.1 ± 4.1%, n = 7,p < 0.001, K-S test), suggesting the existence of a presynaptic mechanism as well. To better isolate the postsynaptic effect of 5-HT1A receptors, we exposed PFC slices to TTX (0.5 μm), and mEPSCs were measured. Bath application of 8-OH-DPAT to the PFC slice reversibly reduced the mEPSC amplitude by 18.6% (Fig. 3, C and D, p < 0.01, K-S test). In eight PFC pyramidal neurons we examined, 8-OH-DPAT decreased the mean amplitude of mEPSCs by 15.9 ± 2.7% (mean ± S.E., n = 6, p < 0.01, K-S test). Because mEPSCs of pyramidal neurons in PFC slices often had small sizes (mean amplitude: 14.1 pA; n = 6), we further examined the modulation of mEPSC by 5-HT1A receptors in cultured PFC pyramidal neurons. A representative example is shown in Fig. 3(E and F). Bath application of 8-OH-DPAT caused a reversible reduction of the mEPSC amplitude by 22.0% in the cultured neuron (p < 0.01, K-S test). Similar to the results in PFC slices, 8-OH-DPAT decreased the mean amplitude of mEPSCs by 17.1 ± 1.9% in cultured PFC pyramidal neurons (mean ± S.E., n = 10, p < 0.01, K-S test). These results indicate that activation of 5-HT1A receptors could down-regulate AMPA receptor function by a postsynaptic mechanism. The frequency of mEPSCs recorded from PFC pyramidal neurons in slices and cultures was also reduced by 8-OH-DPAT (slice: 23.9 ± 3.1%,n = 6, p < 0.01, K-S test; culture: 53.1 ± 6.1%, n = 9, p < 0.001, K-S test), confirming that 5-HT1A receptors could also regulate excitatory transmission by a presynaptic mechanism. We next examined the signal transduction pathways mediating the modulation of AMPA currents by 5-HT1A receptors. A classic pathway for 5-HT1Areceptors is to couple to Gi/Go proteins to inhibit adenylate cyclase and cAMP formation (33Raymond J.R. Mukhin Y.V. Gettys T.W. Garnovskaya M.N. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 1751-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). This led us to speculate that the 5-HT1A reduction of AMPA currents is through the inhibition of PKA. If that is the case, then the effect of 5-HT1A on AMPA receptor currents should be blocked by stimulating PKA and occluded by inhibiting PKA. To test this, we applied selective PKA activators and inhibitors. As shown in Fig. 4 A, application of the membrane-permeable PKA activator Sp-cAMPS (50 μm) blocked the modulatory effect of 5-HT. Removing Sp-cAMPS restored the ability of 5-HT to modulate AMPA currents. On the other hand, in the presence of the membrane-permeable PKA inhibitor Rp-cAMPS (50 μm), application of 5-HT failed to further reduce AMPA currents (data not shown). To confirm the involvement of PKA in 5-HT modulation of AMPA currents, we dialyzed neurons with the specific PKA inhibitory peptide PKI-(5–24) (34Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar) and then examined 5-HT effects. The AMPA currents were reduced by 17.4 ± 1.2% (n = 5) during the dialysis of PKI-(5–24), which was similar to the effect of 5-HT treatment. After ∼5 min of dialysis to allow PKI-(5–24) to enter the cell to inhibit PKA activity, subsequent application of 5-HT had little effect on AMPA currents, whereas a control peptide with the scrambled sequence sPKI-(5–24) did not affect 5-HT-induced reduction of AMPA currents (Fig. 4 B). Shown in Fig. 4 C is a summary to compare the effects of 5-HT in the absence or presence of various PKA activators and inhibitors. 5-HT caused little change in AMPA currents in the presence of Sp-cAMPS (1.8 ± 0.8%, mean ± S.E., n = 12,p > 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test), or Rp-cAMPS (1.4 ± 0.8%, n = 10, p > 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test), or PKI-(5–24) (1.3 ± 0.8%,n = 8, p > 0.05, Mann-WhitneyU test), which was significantly different from the 5-HT effect in the absence of these agents (14.8 ± 1.8%,n = 22, p < 0.01, ANOVA). These results suggest that 5-HT reduction of AMPA currents depends on the inhibition of PKA. The 5-HT1A-induced inhibition of PKA could directly reduce AMPA currents through decreased phosphorylation of GluR1 subunit on the PKA site (35Roche K.W. O'Brien R.J. Mamme"
https://openalex.org/W2087965446,"Netrins are a family of secreted proteins that guide the migration of cells and axonal growth cones during development. DCC (deleted in colorectalcancer) is a receptor for netrin-1 implicated in mediating these responses. Here, we show that DCC interacts constitutively with the SH3/SH2 adaptor Nck in commissural neurons. This interaction is direct and requires the SH3 but not SH2 domains of Nck-1. Moreover, both DCC and Nck-1 associate with the actin cytoskeleton, and this association is mediated by DCC. A dominant negative Nck-1 inhibits the ability of DCC to induce neurite outgrowth in N1E-115 cells and to activate Rac1 in fibroblasts in response to netrin-1. These studies provide evidence for an important role of mammalian Nck-1 in a novel signaling pathway from an extracellular guidance cue to changes in the actin-based cytoskeleton responsible for axonal guidance.

Src homology 3 Src homology 2 glutathione S-transferase phosphate-buffered saline Cdc42 GTPase-activating protein In the developing nervous system, newborn neurons extend their axons to their targets in response to attractive and repulsive cues. The neuronal growth cone, located at the tip of the growing axon, is a highly motile structure that can be viewed as a sophisticated signal transduction device capable of recognizing extracellular guidance cues and translating them into directed neurite outgrowth (1Tessier-Lavigne M. Goodman C.S. Science. 1996; 274: 1123-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2691) Google Scholar, 2Mueller B.K. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 351-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Over the past years, a combination of cellular and genetic studies has led to the identification of several proteins playing a critical role in guiding axons along their pathways, including members of the ephrin, semaphorin, netrin, slit, reelin, and nerve growth factor families of proteins (3Song H.-J. Poo M.-M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Several classes of transmembrane proteins have also been identified and characterized as their respective binding receptors (4Patel B.N. Van Victor D.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For instance, two classes of receptors, DCC and the UNC-5 proteins, have been described for the netrins. Netrins are bifunctional molecules attracting and repelling different classes of axons. The DCC family of receptors mediates growth cone attraction by netrins (5Keino-Masu K. Masu M. Hinck L.

A role for the fly protein Dock in axon guidance has been well characterized duringDrosophila eye and nervous system development (18Garrity P. Rao Y. Salecker I. McGlade J. Pawson T. Zipursky S.L.

Garrity P.A. Keshishian H. Zipursky S.L. Zinn K. Development. 1999; 126: 1527-1535PubMed Google Scholar). Nck, the mammalian homolog of Dock, is a ubiquitously expressed protein composed of a single SH2 and three SH3 domains and is represented by two genes (22Li W. She H. Histol. Histopathol. 2000; 15: 947-955PubMed Google Scholar, 23Li W. Fan J. Woodley D.T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6403-6417Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In this paper, we provide biochemical and functional evidence for the involvement of Nck in mediating the netrin-1 receptor DCC signaling. We demonstrate that DCC associates with Nck in embryonic spinal commissural neurons. The interaction of DCC and Nck is independent of netrin-1 and involves the direct binding of DCC to two SH3 domains of Nck-1. Furthermore, DCC associates with the actin cytoskeleton and is responsible for the relocalization of Nck-1 to the Triton-insoluble fraction. In N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells, a dominant negative Nck-1 inhibits the ability of DCC to induce neurite outgrowth. In fibroblasts, dominant negative Nck-1 blocks the activation of Rac1 by DCC in the presence of netrin-1. Thus, we propose that Nck-1 is constitutively associated with DCC through two SH3 domains. In the presence of netrin-1, Nck-1 bound to DCC is now able to interact with downstream effectors via the SH2 domain to mediate changes in the actin-based cytoskeleton through activation of Rac1. pRK5 encoding full-length DCC (pRK5-DCC) was as described previously (15Li X.

DNA was purified using a Qiagen kit. For microinjection studies, purified plasmids were filtered through a 0.2-μm cellulose acetate membrane (Corning) before microinjection into cells. Whole brains were extracted from newborn rats and incubated in 10 ml (per brain) of a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Brain tissues were homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer and incubated for 30 min on ice. Lysates were cleared by a 10-min centrifugation at 14,000 rpm, and supernatants were passed several times through 25-gauge needles. The supernatants were then subjected to immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Commissural neurons were obtained by dissecting E13 rat embryo dorsal spinal cords as described previously (16Shekarabi M. Kennedy T.E. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 19: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 103 cells were plated onto 13-mm coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine and laminin-1 or on laminin-1-coated 60 mm dishes and maintained for 48 h after dissection in neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% inactivated fetal bovine serum. After treatment or not for 10 min at 37 °C with 160 ng/ml netrin-1, commissural neurons plated on coverslips were subjected to immunofluorescence, whereas 60-mm plated cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Mouse fibroblast Swiss 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics and maintained in an atmosphere of 10% CO2. Confluent serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells were prepared as described (27Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3831) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated in 10% serum at a density of 6 × 104 onto acid-washed coverslips. 7–10 days later, the cells became quiescent and were subjected to serum starvation for 16 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 g/liter NaHCO3. The eukaryotic expression vector pRK5 encoding full-length DCC was microinjected alone or with GST, GST-Nck-(SH31/SH32/SH33)1–251, GST-Grb2-SH3 into the nucleus of ∼100 cells over a period of 20 min in CO2-independent medium (Invitrogen) using Eppendorf microinjection system 5246. During microinjection, cells were maintained at 37 °C within a humidified atmosphere. Cells were returned to the incubator for a further 5 h before the addition of purified netrin-1 at 500 ng/ml for 10 min. N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells and COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics at 10% CO2. N1E-115 cells were plated onto coverslips previously coated with laminin (20 μg/ml; VWR Canlab) for 24 h at 37 °C, washed twice with water, and left to air-dry. Transfection was carried out with LipofectAMINE transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol and as previously described (15Li X. Saint-Cyr-Proulx E. Aktories K. Lamarche-Vane N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15207-15214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). 0.4 μg of pRK5 or pRK5-DCC or either 0.4 μg of pcDNAmyc-Nck-1, -Nck(R308K)1–377, -Nck(W38R,W143R,W229R)1–377, or -Nck-(SH31/SH32/SH33)1–251were used. COS-7 cells were transfected using the DEAE-dextran method as described previously (28Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). The amount of plasmids used per 100-mm dish was as follows: pRK5, 5 μg; pRK5-DCC, 2.5 μg; pcDNAmyc-Nck-1, 2.5 μg. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were either serum-starved overnight or not and treated with netrin-1 at 500 ng/ml for different periods of time. At the indicated times, microinjected Swiss 3T3 cells or transfected N1E-115 cells were rinsed with PBS and fixed for 10 min in freshly prepared 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde. All steps were carried out at room temperature, and coverslips were rinsed in PBS between each of the steps. Cells were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and free aldehyde groups were reduced with 0.5 mg/ml sodium borohydride for 10 min. Cells were double-labeled after the procedure previously described (15Li X. Saint-Cyr-Proulx E. Aktories K. Lamarche-Vane N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15207-15214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with monoclonal anti-DCC antibodies (Pharmingen, G97–449), polyclonal anti-Nck antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology, 06-288), or anti-vinculin (Sigma) diluted in PBS for 60 min. Then, coverslips were transferred to a secondary antibody mixture composed of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Sigma) or goat anti-rabbit (Sigma) and tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) for 60 min. For vinculin staining, cells were incubated with a tertiary fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-goat antibodies for an additional 30 min. Coverslips were mounted by inverting them onto 8 μl of Mowiol containingp-phenylenediamine as an anti-bleach reagent. After 2 h at room temperature, the coverslips were examined on a Zeiss Axiovert 135 microscope using Zeiss oil immersion 63× objective lens. Fluorescence images were recorded using a digital camera (DVC) and analyzed with Northern Eclipse software (Empix Imaging Inc.). In N1E-115 cells, a neurite was defined as a process that measured at least the length of a cell body. Dissected E13 rat dorsal commissural neurons treated or not for 10 min at 37 °C with 160 ng/ml netrin-1 were rapidly rinsed with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and then permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. Blocking was performed for 1 h in 5% heat-inactivated normal goat serum. Coverslips were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with monoclonal anti-DCC antibody (2 μg/ml) and polyclonal anti-Nck (2 μg/ml, Upstate Biotechnology). Cells were then gently washed with PBS and incubated with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Sigma) antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted as described above. Coverslips were analyzed using a Zeiss LSM410 invert laser-scanning confocal microscope, and images were captured with a 63× objective lens. Acquired images were analyzed using Zeiss LSM software. Newborn rat brains, dissociated commissural neurons treated or not with 160 ng/ml netrin-1, or COS-7 cells transfected with pcDNAmyc-Nck-1 alone or together with pRK5-DCC were lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. 1 mg of protein lysates were precleared with 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C overnight. The supernatants were incubated with normal mouse IgGs (Pierce) or with monoclonal anti-Nck (Upstate Biotechnology, 05-160) antibody at 4 °C for 2 h and with 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads for an additional hour. Beads were washed three times in lysis buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE and revealed by immunoblotting using anti-DCC and polyclonal anti-Nck antibodies (29Lussier G. Larose L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2688-2694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and the ECL reagent detection kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The level of immunoprecipitated DCC and Nck proteins obtained from commissural cell lysates was determined by densitometry (Bio-Rad imaging densitometer GS-700). Escherichia coli transformed with various GST fusion proteins were grown at 37 °C for 1 h. Expression of the fusion proteins was induced by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm) for 3 h at 37 °C, except for GST-p65PAK, which was induced at room temperature. Cells were sonicated in buffer A (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1% followed by incubation with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed 3 times with buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). GST fusion proteins were eluted in Buffer D (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) containing 0.005 mm glutathione (Sigma). The interaction of the cytoplasmic tail of DCC expressed as a GST fusion protein (DCC-C) and Nck-1 was assessed using a dot blot assay. In brief, GST (5 or 50 μg), GST-p65PAK (5 μg), GST-CdGAP proline-rich domain (5 μg), and GST-DCC-C (5 μg) were spotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The filter was air-dried and incubated with blocking buffer (Tris-buffered saline containing 5% milk and 0.05% Tween 20) for 2 h at room temperature. The cDNA encoding Nck-1 was subcloned into pGEX-2TK (Amersham Biosciences) containing a protein kinase site located between the GST domain and the multi-cloning site that allows in vitro phosphorylation of GST-Nck-1. According to the manufacturer's protocol, GST-Nck-1 coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in kinase buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 10 μl [γ-32P]ATP (10 mCi/ml), and 10 μl of protein kinase catalytic subunit from bovine heart (50 μg/ml) (Sigma, P2645). The reaction was stopped by adding 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Beads were washed 5 times with PBS, and radiolabeled GST-Nck-1 was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 10 mm glutathione. The membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C with blocking buffer containing 106cpm of radiolabeled GST-Nck-1. The membrane was then washed with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20. Nck-1 binding to the different GST fusion proteins was visualized by autoradiography. COS-7 cells transfected with pRK5-DCC were lysed in buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). 1 mg of protein lysate was precleared with 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C overnight. The supernatant was incubated with 20 μg of GST fusion proteins and 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 2 h. Beads were washed three times with buffer A and boiled in SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, and DCC was revealed by immunoblotting using anti-DCC antibody and ECL reagent detection kit. The amount of GST fusion proteins was detected by Ponceau S (Sigma) staining. COS-7 cells transfected with pRK5, pRK5myc-Rac1, pRK5-DCC, and pcDNAmyc-Nck1 or co-transfected with pRK5-DCC and pcDNAmyc-Nck-1 were serum-starved overnight and treated with netrin-1 at 500 ng/ml for different periods of time. Cells were washed 3 times with cold PBS followed by incubation on ice for 10 min with gentle shaking in 200 μl of extraction buffer (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride containing 0.1 to 1% Triton X-100). The extracted material (soluble fraction) was collected, and 100 μl of SDS sample buffer was added to each sample. Dishes were rinsed twice with cold PBS, and the insoluble fraction was collected in 300 μl of SDS sample buffer. The proteins were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. DCC, Rac1, and Nck-1 were revealed by immunoblotting using anti-DCC, monoclonal anti-Myc (15Li X. Saint-Cyr-Proulx E. Aktories K. Lamarche-Vane N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15207-15214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), or polyclonal anti-Nck antibodies and the ECL reagent detection kit. The level of DCC and Nck-1 proteins in the soluble and insoluble fractions was determined by densitometry. For immunofluorescence detection of DCC associated with the actin cytoskeleton after detergent extractions, Swiss 3T3 cells microinjected with pRK5-DCC and treated with netrin-1 for 30 min were incubated with cytoskeleton buffer (10 mm 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid, pH 7.0, 300 mm sucrose, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 10 min on ice, rinsed with PBS, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min followed by immunofluorescence detection as described. To determine whether Nck plays a role in the netrin-1 receptor DCC signaling, we attempted to determine if endogenous Nck and DCC could be co-precipitated from rat day 1 brain lysate. In this experiment, DCC was found to co-precipitate with Nck in rat whole brain protein lysates, with no band corresponding to DCC observed in immunoprecipitates using normal mouse IgGs (Fig.1 A). To assess whether the interaction between endogenous Nck and DCC is similar in neurons that respond to netrin-1, we immunoprecipitated Nck from dissociated commissural neurons obtained from the dorsal half of micro-dissected embryonic day 13 rat spinal cords. After 2 days in culture, cells were incubated with or without 160 ng/ml netrin-1 for 10 min before cell lysis. DCC was found to co-precipitate with Nck both in the absence or in the presence of netrin-1, and DCC was not significantly detected in the negative control using normal mouse IgGs (Fig. 1 B). After netrin-1 treatment, the higher amount of DCC proteins co-precipitated with Nck correlated with the increased amount of immunoprecipitated Nck (Fig. 1 D). Time course incubation with netrin-1 from 5 to 20 min did not show any increase in the level of DCC interacting with Nck (data not shown). Furthermore, when DCC was co-expressed with Nck-1 in COS-7 cells that do not express endogenous DCC or netrin-1 (15Li X. Saint-Cyr-Proulx E. Aktories K. Lamarche-Vane N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15207-15214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), DCC also co-immunoprecipitated with Nck-1 in the absence of netrin-1 (Fig. 1 C). As previously found (16Shekarabi M. Kennedy T.E. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 19: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), DCC was observed in the cell bodies along the axons of the commissural neurons and as a punctate staining enriched in the growth cones and at the tip of the filopodia (Fig.2, A and B). Nck was also highly enriched in the cell bodies and along the axons. Similar to the distribution of DCC, Nck was present in the filopodia and lamellipodia of the growth cones (Fig. 2, A andB). Confocal microscopy analysis revealed that DCC and Nck highly colocalized in the cell bodies and along the axons both in the absence (Fig. 2 A) or in the presence of netrin-1 (Fig.2 B). They were also found to be associated at discrete sites at the tip of the filopodia in the growth cones (Fig. 2, Aand B). Hence, DCC interacts with Nck in vivo, and this interaction is independent of netrin-1 in embryonic commissural neurons. To characterize the interaction of DCC with Nck, GST pull-down experiments were performed using lysates of COS-7 cells expressing DCC incubated with wild type or mutated Nck-1 expressed as GST fusion proteins (TableI). As shown in Fig.3 A, wild type Nck-1 or the three SH3 domains of Nck-1 showed binding to DCC, whereas the Nck-1 SH2 domain showed no interaction. To dissect the interaction of DCC with the SH3 domains of Nck-1, each of the SH3 domains of Nck-1 were expressed as GST fusion proteins and incubated with lysates of DCC-expressing cells. The third SH3 domain of Nck-1 was found to interact with DCC. In addition, the first SH3 domain of Nck-1 also bound to DCC but to a lower extent. No significant binding was observed with the second SH3 domain (Fig. 3 A). Full-length Nck-1 containing amino acid substitutions W38R, W143R, and W229R in each of the SH3 domains predicted to inhibit interactions with proline-containing proteins (30Tanaka M. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6829-6837Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 31Pawson T. Gish G.D. Cell. 1992; 71: 359-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar) did not interact with DCC (Fig.3 A). However, Nck-1 protein mutants containing these amino acid substitutions in individual SH3 domains were still able to interact with DCC (Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that the first and third SH3 domains of Nck-1 are sufficient to mediate the interaction with DCC.Table ISummary of the binding of DCC to the various Nck-1 protein mutants and their effect on DCC-induced neurite outgrowthThe numbers in superscript indicate amino acid residues of Nck-1.

To assess the specificity of the interaction between DCC and Nck-1, we incubated lysates of DCC-expressing cells with the SH3 domains of Grb-2, Src, and the endocytic protein intersectin. As shown in Fig.3 C, no binding was observed with the carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2, the SH3 domain of Src, or the SH3A and -D domains of intersectin, suggesting a specific interaction between Nck-1 and DCC. To determine whether Nck-1 interacts directly with the cytoplasmic tail of DCC, we have expressed a GST fusion protein with the complete intracellular domain of DCC (DCC-C) in E. coli. Direct binding between DCC-C and Nck-1 was assessed in a dot blot assay using purified Nck-1 expressed as a GST fusion protein and phosphorylatedin vitro with [γ-32P]ATP (Fig.3 D). Nck-1 was able to bind directly to the cytoplasmic domain of DCC and to the serine/threonine kinase p65PAKknown to interact with the second SH3 domain of Nck-1 (32Bokoch G. Wang Y. Bohl B.P.

No binding was observed with the proline-rich domain of CdGAP or with high amounts of GST proteins. Therefore, Nck-1 interacts directly in vitro with the intracellular domain of DCC. Mouse N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells express netrin-1 but not DCC (15Li X. Saint-Cyr-Proulx E. Aktories K. Lamarche-Vane N. J. Biol.

When DCC is ectopically expressed in N1E-115 cells, the majority of DCC-expressing cells show neurite outgrowth in a netrin-1-dependent manner (15Li X. Saint-Cyr-Proulx E. Aktories K.

To address the cellular function of Nck-1 in the context of netrin-1-mediated DCC signaling, we expressed full-length Nck-1 or various Nck-1 mutant proteins alone or together with DCC into N1E-115 cells and measured the number of transfected cells with neurite outgrowth (Fig. 4 A and TableI). 60% of transfected cells with the expression vector pRK5 encoding DCC exhibited neurite outgrowth, whereas Nck-1 induced neurite outgrowth in more than 50% of transfected cells. When DCC and Nck-1 were expressed together in N1E-115 cells (Fig. 4 B), 80% of transfected cells now showed neurite outgrowth (Fig. 4 A).

https://openalex.org/W2008815214,"Understanding the regulation of Akt has been of major interest for elucidating the control of normal cellular physiology as well as malignant transformation. The paradigm for activation of Akt involves phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent membrane localization followed by activating phosphorylation of Thr-308 and Ser-473. Many of the activating signals for Akt involve the stimulation of receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases, and the most potent activator known is the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate, highlighting a possible role for tyrosine phosphorylation in the regulation of the enzyme. In this study we show that activation of Akt by pervanadate or serum is associated with tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt. In addition, in SKOV3 ovarian carcinoma cells that exhibit high basal levels of Akt activity, Akt was tyrosine-phosphorylated in the basal state, and this phosphorylation was further enhanced by both pervanadate and insulin-like growth factor-1. We have used NH2-terminal sequencing and phosphate release analysis to directly identify Tyr-474 as the site of tyrosine phosphorylation. Substitution of Tyr-474 with phenylalanine abolished tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt and resulted in up to 55% inhibition of Akt activation, indicating phosphorylation at Tyr-474 is required for full activation of the kinase. Our data identifies a novel regulatory mechanism for this pleiotropic enzyme that may be applicable to the AGC family of protein kinases given the conserved nature of the COOH-terminal hydrophobic motif containing Tyr-474.

Substitution of Tyr-474 with phenylalanine abolished tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt and resulted in up to 55% inhibition of Akt activation, indicating phosphorylation at Tyr-474 is required for full activation of the kinase. Our data identifies a novel regulatory mechanism for this pleiotropic enzyme that may be applicable to the AGC family of protein kinases given the conserved nature of the COOH-terminal hydrophobic motif containing Tyr-474. phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pleckstrin homology insulin-like growth factor-1 glutathioneS-transferase hemagglutinin Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid dithiothreitol high performance liquid chromatography The protein kinase Akt plays key regulatory roles in a range of physiological processes including glucose metabolism (1Cross D.A.

Furthermore, the kinase is inappropriately regulated in a number of tumors (13Bellacosa A. de Feo D. Godwin A.K. Bell D.W. Cheng J.Q. Altomare D.A. Wan M. Dubeau L. Scambia G. Masciullo V. et al.Int.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2324-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Understanding the regulation of Akt has thus been of major interest for elucidating the control of normal cellular physiology as well as malignant transformation. The paradigm for activation of Akt involves phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)1-dependent membrane localization followed by activating phosphorylation of Thr-308 in the activation loop of the kinase and Ser-473 at the COOH terminus (4Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 5Downward J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar, 17Hemmings B.A. Science. 1997; 275: 628-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Binding of the PH domain of Akt to PI3K-generated phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate releases the autoinhibitory function of this domain allowing phosphorylation of Thr-308 by PDK1, while the mechanism of Ser-473 phosphorylation remains to be determined definitively. Many of the activating signals for Akt involve the stimulation of receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases, and the most potent activator known is the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate, highlighting a possible role for tyrosine phosphorylation in the regulation of the enzyme. Recent reports show that the tyrosine kinases Syk and Btk are required for B cell receptor induced activation of Akt (18Craxton A. Jiang A. Kurosaki T. Clark E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30644-30650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and Chen et al. (19Chen R. Kim O. Yang J. Sato K. Eisenmann K.M. McCarthy J.B. Chen H. Qiu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31858-31862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that activation of Akt induced by EGF or v-Src transformation requires tyrosine phosphorylation. In addition, dephosphorylation of active Akt with the tyrosine phosphatase PTPβ markedly reduced kinase activity (19Chen R. Kim O. Yang J. Sato K. Eisenmann K.M. McCarthy J.B. Chen H. Qiu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31858-31862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Chen et al. (19Chen R. Kim O. Yang J. Sato K. Eisenmann K.M. McCarthy J.B. Chen H. Qiu Y. J. Biol.

That mutation of these sites has major effects on activity, and phosphorylation is not surprising given the essential nature of this region of the enzyme. To enable direct biochemical identification of regulatory sites of tyrosine phosphorylation we have utilized pervanadate, the most potent activator of Akt to maximize the stoichiometry of phosphorylation. In this report we show that activation of Akt by pervanadate or serum was associated with tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt. In addition, in SKOV3 ovarian carcinoma cells that exhibit high basal levels of Akt activity, Akt was tyrosine-phosphorylated in the basal state, and this phosphorylation was further enhanced by both pervanadate and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). We have used NH2-terminal sequencing and phosphate release analysis to identify Tyr-474 as the site of tyrosine phosphorylation. Substitution of Tyr-474 with phenylalanine abolished tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt and resulted in up to 55% inhibition of Akt activation, indicating that phosphorylation at Tyr-474 is required for full activation of the kinase. Phosphorylation site analysis reveals that mutation of this site or the neighboring regulatory site Ser-473 to Phe and Ala, respectively, inhibits phosphorylation of Thr-308 concomitant with decreased activation of the kinase. In vitro studies confirm these mutations render the kinase insensitive to activation by PDK1. As corresponding carboxyl-terminal residues are found in many other members of the AGC kinase family, these data identify a novel regulatory mechanism for this pleiotropic enzyme that may be applicable to related AGC protein kinases. The peptide substrate RPRAATF, and carboxyl-terminal peptide from Akt1 (CRRPHFPQFSYSASSTA) used to raise polyclonal antibodies, were synthesized by Auspep Pty Ltd. IGF-1 was purchased from ICN, and wortmannin and Affi-Gel 10 resin were from Sigma. pECE HA-Akt1 (20Andjelkovic M. Jakubowicz T. Cron P. Ming X.F. Han J.W. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5699-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) was subcloned as a KpnI/EcoRV fragment into a pCDNA3 vector containing GST, in-frame. GST-Akt1 Phe-474, GST-ΔPHAkt1, GST-ΔPHAkt1 Phe-474, GST-ΔPHAkt1 Ala-473, and GST-ΔPHAkt1 Ala-473/Phe-474 mutants were created with the QuikChangeTMSite-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The kinase inactive construct HA-Akt K179A had the essential catalytic domain lysine residue mutated to alanine. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. The Myc-tagged PDK1 was generated as described previously (21Park J. Hill M.M. Hess D. Brazil D.P. Hofsteenge J. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37459-37471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed on COS1 cells grown at 50–80% confluence using FuGENE (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at a ratio of 3 μl of FuGENE/1 μg of DNA according to the manufacturer's protocol. COS1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum. The transformed ovarian epithelial cell line SKOV3 was cultured in RPMI with 10% fetal calf serum. Prior to stimulation all cells were cultured to a confluence of ∼80% and maintained in serum-free DMEM for at least 24 h. Serum-starved cells were then incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere with various stimuli under optimized conditions. Following stimulation, cells were rinsed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), Dounce homogenized, and cleared by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at 13,000 × g. The supernatant (cell extract) was retained. The protein concentration of cell extracts was determined using the Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay with bovine serum albumin as a protein standard. Sheep and rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed to the COOH-terminal 16 residues of Akt1 (RRPHFPQFSYSASSTA) were affinity-purified on an Affi-Gel 10 resin (Sigma) coupled to the COOH-terminal peptide. The bound antibody was eluted with 7m urea, 1 m NaCl and 100 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.01% azide. This antibody recognizes the three isoforms of Akt. It was used at 3 μg/ml for immunoblotting, and 5 μg were used to immunoprecipitate 200 μg of protein lysate. Mouse 12CA5 and 9E10 monoclonal antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate HA and Myc epitope-tagged constructs, respectively, 5 μg of antibody per 200 μg of protein lysate. Under the conditions employed, endogenous and epitope-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with an efficiency of >80%. A mixture of anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (PY-7E1, PY-1B2, and PY20: Zymed Laboratories Inc.) was used for Western blotting at 1:3000 dilution, anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies P99 (Santa Cruz) and 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology) were used at 1:2000 dilution as was the anti-PDK1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). 1 μg of anti-PDK1 antibody was used to immunoprecipitate from 500 μg of cell lysate. Phospho-specific antibodies recognizing Akt phosphorylated on Ser-473 or Thr-308 were obtained from New England Biolabs and used at 1:2000 dilution. GST-Akt was purified from cell extracts (50 μg) using glutathione beads and Akt activity determined by incubation in a total volume of 20 μl of 25 mmTris·HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mmbenzamidine, 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (5000 cpm/pmol), and 10 mm MgCl2 with 150 μm RPRAATF peptide at 30 °C for 10 min. Assay conditions were developed so less than 5% of the peptide substrate was consumed in the standard activity assay. The reaction was terminated by adding trichloroacetic acid to 10% (w/v) and incubating on ice for 20 min. Following centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 ×g, the supernatant containing the substrate peptide was spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose cation exchange paper (Whatman), and32Pi incorporation was quantitated by scintillation counting (22Conus N.M. Hemmings B.A. Pearson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4776-4782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). For in vitro reactivation assays GST-ΔPH Akt mutants were purified from extracts of transiently transfected, serum-starved COS1 cells using glutathione beads. Following elution with 25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm benzamidine containing 20 mm reduced glutathione, 0.2 μg of each construct was incubated with immunoprecipitated Myc-PDK1 in 25 mmTris·HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mmbenzamidine, 50 μm ATP, and 10 mmMgCl2. The assays were performed in a total volume of 40 μl, with shaking at 30 °C for 30 min and centrifuged immediately after the incubation. The supernatant was either assayed for Akt activity as described above or resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using the Akt1 antibodies. Phosphopeptides corresponding to approximately 100 cpm were hydrolyzed for an hour at 95 °C with 50 μl of 5.7 n HCl. HCl was removed by drying, resuspending into 100 μl of pH 1.9 buffer (formic acid:glacial acetic acid:H2O; 50:156:1794 v/v), and drying again. The dried hydrolyzed peptides were resuspended into 2–5 μl of pH 1.9 buffer together with phosphoamino acid standards and spotted on a TLC plate. Phosphoamino acids were separated by electrophoresis at 1000 V for 90 min in (1:2) pH 1.9 buffer/pH 3.5 buffer (pyridine:glacial acetic acid:H2O; 1:10:189 v/v) and visualized with ninhydrin (0.1% w/v in ethanol) or using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Selected phosphopeptides corresponding to at least 400 cpm were covalently coupled to a Sequelon arylamine membrane and analyzed on a Hewlett-Packard G1000A protein sequencer as described previously (23Xu A. Suh P.-G. Marmy-Conus N. Pearson R.B. Seok O.Y. Cocco L. Gilmour R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2981-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Fractions were collected at each cycle of Edman degradation and 32P radioactivity counted. The chemical sequence of the phosphopeptides was identified on the same protein sequencer by solid phase sequencing as described previously (23Xu A. Suh P.-G. Marmy-Conus N. Pearson R.B. Seok O.Y. Cocco L. Gilmour R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2981-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Akt is maximally activated by treatment of COS1 cells and Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with the potent tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, pervanadate (20Andjelkovic M. Jakubowicz T. Cron P. Ming X.F. Han J.W. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5699-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous Akt may play a role in its activation and assayed for this possibility by Western blot analysis of Akt immunoprecipitates from pervanadate-treated COS1 cells using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 1 a). Pervanadate treatment induced marked tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt in COS1 cells. Furthermore, tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt in pervanadate-treated COS1 cells was abolished by the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin, indicating either that the responsible tyrosine kinase is PI3K-dependent or that, like Thr-308 phosphorylation, the tyrosine phosphorylation requires a phosphoinositide-induced conformational change in the kinase (5Downward J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). Akt appears to play a major role in the biology of ovarian epithelial cells and 40% of ovarian tumors display elevated levels of Akt activity (16Yuan Z.Q. Sun M. Feldman R.I. Wang G., Ma, X. Jiang C. Coppola D. Nicosia S.V. Cheng J.Q. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2324-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that the ovarian carcinoma cell line SKOV3 exhibits elevated basal Akt activity that can be further stimulated by pervanadate and growth factors (data not shown). Consistent with these data, Akt in these cells exhibits a low but reproducible basal level of tyrosine phosphorylation that is further stimulated by pervanadate and IGF-1 treatment (Fig. 1 b). Similar patterns of Thr-308 and Ser-473 phosphorylation were observed, consistent with a regulatory role for tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt in SKOV3 cells. The Ser-473 phospho-specific antibody gave a more intense signal that is likely to reflect both more robust phosphorylation of this site and the higher sensitivity of this antibody. In both cases blots were re-probed with Akt antibodies to control for the levels of the kinase in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1, a and b). It is unclear whether the high molecular weight tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in Akt immunoprecipitates from pervanadate-treated SKOV3 cells represent members of a signaling complex or nonspecific proteins, highly phosphorylated in response to pervanadate. Certainly, they are not present in immunoprecipitates from IGF-treated cells, despite similar levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt being detected, indicating they are not a prerequisite for tyrosine phosphorylation of the kinase. To directly identify the site(s) of this tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt, we chose COS1 cells, because the response was most robust, and these cells can be transiently transfected to achieve expression levels of the kinase sufficient for biochemical characterization. Transiently transfected cells were metabolically labeled with32Pi and the immunoprecipitated Akt subjected to tryptic phosphopeptide mapping. Phosphopeptides were separated by HPLC and further analyzed by thin layer chromatography as described previously (24Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Han J.W. Williamson N.A. Kozma S.C. Wettenhall R.E. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5279-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). A range of phosphopeptides (A–L) was observed, with peptides E, F, G/H, I/J, and K all generated in response to pervanadate treatment (compare Fig. 2,a and b). This was particularly interesting as the only regulated phosphorylation sites positively identified so far reported are Thr-308 in the activation loop and Ser-473 in the COOH-terminal regulatory region of the kinase (25Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2498) Google Scholar). Phosphopeptides E, F, G/H, and K were stimulated by serum treatment (Fig. 2 c), although to a lesser extent, consistent with the relatively poor activation of the kinase induced by serum (20Andjelkovic M. Jakubowicz T. Cron P. Ming X.F. Han J.W. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5699-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). To confirm these phosphopeptides were not artifacts of the over expression system, phosphopeptide maps were generated from endogenous kinase (Fig.2 d). As with serum stimulation, phosphopeptides E, F, G/H, and K were all enhanced by pervanadate treatment, indicating the existence of at least two novel regulated phosphorylation sites in Akt in addition to Thr-308 and Ser-473. To characterize and identify these phosphopeptides, each was further purified by preparative 2 dimensional thin layer electrophoresis and chromatography and then subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis, phosphate release analysis, and NH2-terminal sequencing as described previously (24Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Han J.W. Williamson N.A. Kozma S.C. Wettenhall R.E. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5279-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed peptides E and I/J contained phosphotyrosine, peptides A–D and F contained phosphoserine, and peptides K and L contained phosphothreonine (Fig.3 a). Phosphate release analysis and NH2-terminal sequencing enabled positive identification of all peptides except G/H and I/J (Fig. 3 b) and are summarized in Table I.Table ISummary of phosphopeptide identification dataA/BC/DEFG/HI/JKLHPLC fractions51–5353–5455–5759–6063–6471–7273–7481–83PAA analysisSerSerTyrSerThrTyrThrThrPhosphate release33,5984None114N-terminal sequencingSGXPXDSGXPRPXFPQFRPXFXQNoneNoneXFXGTPEYFDEEPhospho siteSer-124Ser-124,129Tyr-474Ser-473Not knownHA?Thr-308Thr-450 Open table in a new tab Phosphopeptide E, present in both epitope-tagged and endogenous kinase, was identified as being phosphorylated on Tyr-474, adjacent to the known regulatory phosphorylation site Ser-473 (phosphopeptide F). This is an exciting finding, directly identifying a regulatory tyrosine phosphorylation site in Akt for the first time. The I/J peptides were absent from endogenous maps (Fig. 2 d) and maps of GST-tagged Akt (data not shown) and run as a single spot when subjected to performic acid oxidation, indicating they are differentially oxidized forms of the same peptide. This phosphopeptide contained phosphotyrosine, but did not yield phosphate release or NH2-terminal sequence data. Taken together this data indicate I/J may correspond to phosphorylation of the blocked NH2-terminal hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged peptide, a possibility to be aware of when analyzing anti-phosphotyrosine blots of HA-tagged proteins. Phosphopeptides F and K correspond to the known regulatory sites Ser-473 and Thr-308, respectively. The intensities of each of the regulated sites were determined by analysis of the original image files using Scion Image for Windows acquisition and analysis software (Scion Corporation, Frederick, MD). The peptides included in the analysis are circled in the relevant figures. Tyr-474 is phosphorylated to a similar extent as Thr-308 and Ser-473 in response to pervanadate (Fig. 2 b; 1224:1082:1410 units, respectively). Similar levels of relative phosphorylation were also observed upon serum stimulation (Fig. 2 c; 398:223:414 units, respectively), although incorporation in to all sites was low. Tyr-474 is also significantly phosphorylated in endogenous Akt (Fig.2 d; 557 units versus 1614 for Thr-308 (35%) and 2321 for Ser-473 (24%)) although to lower levels than observed for overexpressed Akt. The peptides A/B and L contain Ser-124 and Thr-450, respectively, known sites that are constitutively phosphorylated (25Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2498) Google Scholar), consistent with the lack of pervanadate-induced phosphorylation observed for these peptides. Peptides A and B and C and D run as single spots when subjected to performic acid oxidation (data not shown). Peptides C and D are doubly phosphorylated on Ser-124 and Ser-129 and are not evident in the endogenous kinase. The relative phosphorylation of Thr-450 was significantly lower in Akt from serum treated Cos1 cells compared with resting cells. The basis for this difference is unclear but may reflect selective effects of serum on the phosphorylation of Ser-124. None-the-less, as mutation of Thr-450 has little effect on kinase activation (26Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Ahmed N.N. Datta K. Malstrom S. Stokoe D. McCormick F. Feng J. Tsichlis P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that lack of phosphorylation of Thr-450 accounts for the poor activation of Akt by serum. We found no evidence of alternative tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides in the HPLC profile of tryptic digestions of endogenous or overexpressed Akt from pervanadate stimulated COS1 cells (data not shown). While the yields of phosphopeptides during the tryptic digestion and purification were high (see figure legends 2 and 3), it is impossible to exclude the selective loss of individual peptides. To further examine the possibility of alternate tyrosine phosphorylation sites, we constructed a mutant GST-tagged Akt with Tyr-474 substituted with Phe. This substitution abolished tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt consistent with Tyr-474 being the major site of tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig.4 a). Furthermore, this substitution resulted in 37 and 55% inhibition of pervanadate- and IGF-1-stimulated activity, respectively (Fig. 4 b), consistent with the partial inhibition of Akt activity observed following incubation with PTPβ (19Chen R. Kim O. Yang J. Sato K. Eisenmann K.M. McCarthy J.B. Chen H. Qiu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31858-31862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). These effects were not due to differences in expression levels as indicated by Western blotting (Fig.4 c). Similar results were obtained using endothelial nitric oxide synthase as protein substrate for Akt (see Supplementary data). To investigate the mechanism of regulation via phosphorylation of Tyr-474, we examined the effects of its mutation to phenylalanine on phosphorylation of Ser-473 and Thr-308 (Fig. 4 c). Western blotting with phospho-Ser-473 antibody reveals that the Phe-474 mutant is phosphorylated at Ser-473 at slightly lower levels than wild type GST-Akt, indicating the mutation has not caused major changes in the local conformation. Thr-308 phosphorylation in the Phe-474 mutant was significantly lower than in wild type. The hydrophobic motif containing Ser-473 and Tyr-474 is conserved in the AGC family of protein kinases and has been implicated in binding PDK1 (27Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the equivalent tyrosine residue in the kinase PRK2 is required for PDK1 interaction as is an adjacent NH2-terminal acidic residue. To test whether the reduction in Thr-308 phosphorylation was due to effects of the mutation on PDK1 binding, each Akt construct was co-transfected with PDK1. The Phe-474 mutation had little effect on PDK1 binding following pervanadate stimulation (Fig. 4 d,upper panel). In addition, immunoprecipitates of endogenous PDK1 from pervanadate-treated cells contained similar amounts of mutant and wild type GST-Akt (Fig. 4 d, lower panel). This observation is consistent with recent data showing that the region of PDK1 that interacts with the hydrophobic motif of AGC kinases is not required for activation of Akt (28Biondi R.M. Kieloch A. Currie R.A. Deak M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4380-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). These results indicate that phosphorylation of Tyr-474 plays a more subtle role in regulating Akt activity rather than causing a major perturbation of PDK1 binding. We failed to detect any peptide doubly phosphorylated on Ser-473 and Tyr-474, as would be expected if the two sites cooperated in activating the kinase. While this may be due to selective loss of this peptide, given the complex pattern of phosphorylation of the kinase, it is also possible that a complex interplay exists between the regulatory phosphorylation sites. Indeed, as with the Phe-474 mutant, mutation of Ser-473 to Ala resulted in a marked reduction in Akt activity (25Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2498) Google Scholar). This reduction correlates with decreased phosphorylation of both Thr-308 and Tyr-474 compared with Ser-124 and Thr-450. To compare the relative intensities of Tyr-474 and Thr-308 phosphorylation in the wild type (Fig. 2 b) and Ala-473 mutant (Fig.5 a) kinase, the intensity of each was expressed as a ratio of the intensity of Ser-124 phosphorylation. The peptides included in the analysis arecircled in the relevant figures. Tyr-474 was phosphorylated to a ratio of 0.25 (1906/7662 units) in the mutant compared with 0.48 (1224/2525) in wild type. Thr-308 phosphorylation was more sensitive to mutation of Ser-473 with a ratio of 0.05 (342/7662) compared with 0.43 (1082/2525) in wild type. This dramatic effect on Thr-308 phosphorylation was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig.5 b). Thus, the phosphorylation of either COOH-terminal site can influence phosphorylation of the other two regulatory sites and hence kinase activity. To further analyze the mechanism of regulation of Akt via carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation in vitro, Tyr-474 and Ser-473 were mutated to Phe and Ala, respectively, both separately and together within constructs lacking the PH domain. This form of the kinase is capable of direct activation by PDK1 (29Filippa N. Sable C.L. Hemmings B.A. Van Obberghen E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5712-5721Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 30Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346 (Pt. 3): 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar) (Fig.6). Consistent with the in vivo data presented above, while ΔPH Akt was stimulated more than 5-fold by exogenous PDK1, the Phe-474 and Ala-473 mutants were only stimulated 1.5- and 2.7-fold, respectively. The double mutant was not significantly activated by PDK1. In this study we have identified Tyr-474 as the target of a novel regulatory mechanism for the Akt protein kinase. This finding is consistent with the observations of Chen et al. (19Chen R. Kim O. Yang J. Sato K. Eisenmann K.M. McCarthy J.B. Chen H. Qiu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31858-31862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) who reported that EGF stimulation and Src transformation also induce tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Akt. In addition, Chenet al. (19Chen R. Kim O. Yang J. Sato K. Eisenmann K.M. McCarthy J.B. Chen H. Qiu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31858-31862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) found the Src family kinase inhibitor PP2 inhibited EGF-induced activation of Akt. Taken together, these data raise the intriguing possibility of a novel mechanism that directly regulates the activity of Akt via a tyrosine kinase. Furthermore, this mechanism may be relevant to the increased Akt activity found in tumors given the increased basal tyrosine phosphorylation observed in the ovarian tumor-derived SKOV3 cell line. It is clear that phosphorylation of Tyr-474 plays an important role in regulating Akt activity, although the detailed mechanism of this regulation remains to be elucidated. Our in vivo data indicate that the mutation of either Ser-473 or Tyr-474 markedly reduces Thr-308 phosphorylation and kinase activation. This was confirmed in vitro where substitution of either residue markedly reduced PDK1-induced activation of Akt PH domain mutants. The finding that the double mutant abolished activation implies Ser-473 and Tyr-474 may cooperate in facilitating activation of the kinase by PDK1. We have shown this mechanism to be dependent on PI3K activity. Given the effects of PP2 on Akt activity, it is likely that this PI3K dependence is due to the requirement for PH domain-mediated localization of Akt close to membrane localized Src family kinases as recently reported for DAPP-1 (31Stephens L.R. Anderson K.E. Hawkins P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42767-42773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Very recently, crystallographic studies have indicated that the COOH-terminal hydrophobic motif undergoes a Ser-473 phosphorylation-dependent interaction with the NH2-terminal lobe of the kinase that results in activation of the enzyme (32Yang J. Cron P. Thompson V. Good V.M. Hess D. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1227-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Peptide analogues of this region and the equivalent region from the related kinase PRK2 (27Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) activate the kinase by mimicking this interaction, binding with and simultaneously stabilizing the activated conformation of the kinase (32Yang J. Cron P. Thompson V. Good V.M. Hess D. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1227-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Importantly, substitution of the homologous residue to Tyr-474 in the PRK2 peptide reduced its ability to activate Akt by 90%. This observation indicates a key role for the conserved tyrosine in regulating the affinity of the hydrophobic domain with the NH2-terminal lobe, consistent with our findings that mutation of Tyr-474 inhibits activation of the kinase. The findings presented in this study are based on direct chemical identification of the phosphorylation site. However, they are in direct conflict with those of Chen et al. (19Chen R. Kim O. Yang J. Sato K. Eisenmann K.M. McCarthy J.B. Chen H. Qiu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31858-31862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) who used mutational analysis to assign the tyrosine phosphorylation to two sites near the activation loop of the kinase (Tyr-315 and Tyr-326). It is not surprising that mutating these sites has major effects on activity and phosphorylation given the essential nature of this region of the enzyme. While it is possible that the different stimuli employed result in phosphorylation of alternative sites, we found no evidence of alternative tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides in the HPLC profile of tryptic digestions of wild type or Phe-474 mutant Akt from serum- or pervanadate-stimulated COS1 cells. Despite efficient recovery of phosphorylated peptides throughout the isolation procedure, it is possible alternative tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides have been selectively lost. However, substitution of Tyr-474 with Phe abolished tyrosine phosphorylation of Akt consistent with Tyr-474 being the major site of tyrosine phosphorylation. These in vivo experiments are invaluable as, unlike phospho-specific antibodies, they allow assessment of the relative phosphorylation of the known and novel regulatory sites. It is important to note this assessment is predicated on the assumption that individual phosphopeptides are recovered with similar efficiencies during the digestion and mapping process. As observed above, this is a reasonable assumption given the high efficiency of overall recovery of32Pi incorporated into peptides; however, some selective loss of individual peptides is possible. Tyr-474 is phosphorylated to a similar level as Thr-308 and Ser-473 in response to pervanadate or serum and is significantly phosphorylated in endogenous Akt. This is an exciting and significant observation that is reinforced by the functional role for phosphorylation of Tyr-474 indicated by structure function analysis using the Phe-474 mutant. Furthermore, corresponding tyrosine residues are found in many other members of the AGC kinase family including p70s6k, S6K2, and protein kinase C α, γ, and ε (24Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Han J.W. Williamson N.A. Kozma S.C. Wettenhall R.E. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5279-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 33Shima H. Pende M. Chen Y. Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Kozma S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6649-6659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting this may be a common regulatory mechanism for this family of mitogen-stimulated protein kinases, providing a general mechanism linking tyrosine phosphorylation and growth factor signaling. While the mechanism by which tyrosine phosphorylation regulates Akt activity remains elusive, it appears to involve a complex interplay between the regulatory phosphorylation sites. The mutation of either COOH-terminal site affects the phosphorylation of the other two regulatory sites without marked effects on PDK1 binding. Phosphorylation of Tyr-474 may, in fact, contribute to the long-standing difficulty in establishing the mechanism of regulation of Ser-473 phosphorylation (34Toker A. Newton A.C. Cell. 2000; 103: 185-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The complexity of these regulatory events reflects the plethora of cellular stimuli that feed into the Akt signaling pathway (3Hemmings B.A. Science. 1997; 277: 534Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 4Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 5Downward J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar) and raises the possibility of agonist-specific pathways differentially activating the kinase. Furthermore, the activation process may be more complicated still, with a family of proteins homologous to the product of the T cell lymphoma 1 locus (TCL1) being capable of binding and activating Akt (35Laine J. Kunstle G. Obata T. Sha M. Noguchi M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 395-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The role of phosphorylation in this process remains to be ascertained. Definitive examination of the role of Tyr-474 in the regulation of Akt and the interplay between its phosphorylation and that of Ser-473 and Thr-308 awaits the generation of phospho-specific antibodies to both the Tyr-474- and Ser-473/Tyr-474-phosphorylated peptides and identification of the kinases responsible for phosphorylating these two COOH-terminal residues. These reagents will be invaluable in understanding the process of Akt activation in both normal and transformed cells.

Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3537) Google Scholar). PKC isoforms can be divided into three subfamilies. Conventional PKCs are activated via recruitment to membranes, mediated by the Ca2+-dependent binding of a C2 domain to phospholipids, and this effect is further potentiated by the binding of diacylglycerol (DAG) to C1 domains (1Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3537) Google Scholar). By contrast, novel PKCs bind DAG, but not Ca2+ and phospholipids, while atypical PKCs are not affected by any of the above activators (1Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3537) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies of the activation of PKC are complicated by the need for cell disruption and isolation of membrane and cytosol fractions (2Deeney J.T. Cunningham B.A. Chheda S. Bokvist K.

However, while PKC may play an important role in agonist stimulation of exocytosis from neurosecretory cells (10Graham M.E. Fisher R.J. Burgoyne R.D.

However, the role of PKC in the stimulation of insulin secretion is controversial. Acute activation of conventional and novel PKCs with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate strongly stimulates insulin secretion (19Zawalich W. Brown C. Rasmussen H. Biochem.

Cell. Endocrinol. 1990; 70: 119-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), or an inhibitor specific for classical PKC isoforms (Go6976), slightly enhances the first phase of glucose-stimulated insulin release from rat islets (28Zawalich W.S. Zawalich K.C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 177: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) while diminishing the sustained phase. Down-regulation of conventional PKC isoforms with phorbol esters has little effect on glucose-stimulated insulin release (29Arkhammar P. Nilsson T. Welsh M. Welsh N. Berggren P.O. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To determine whether active PKCs may play a role in the spatial coordination of exocytosis in individual β-cells without necessarily affecting total insulin release, we have therefore generated fusion constructs between EGFP and PKCβII, PKCδ, and PKCζ. PKCβII and PKCα represent the major conventional PKC isoforms in β-cells (20Tian Y.M. Urquidi V. Ashcroft S.J.H. Mol. Cell. Endocrin. 1996; 119: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and PKCβII activity has recently been shown to be important for the regulation of the preproinsulin gene (23Kaneto H.

These changes appear to be produced largely by transient depolarizations of the plasma membrane and stimulated Ca2+ influx. The formation of microdomains of [Ca2+]c immediately beneath the plasma membrane, demonstrated directly by targeting a green fluorescent protein-based Ca2+ probe (“pericam”) (35Nagai T. Sawano A.

Cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen or Sigma, and molecular biologicals from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Adenoviruses were constructed and amplified using the pAdEasy system (36He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T., Yu, J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Adenoviral generation from the recombinant shuttle vectors was performed, and infection of cells and islets was performed as previously described (37Ainscow E.K. Zhao C. Rutter G.A. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1149-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Recombination with pAdEasy-1, transfection into HEK 293 cells, and viral amplification of the pShuttle-CMV based plasmids encoding each recombinant PKC isoform-GFP fusion proteins was performed essentially as previously described (37Ainscow E.K. Zhao C. Rutter G.A. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1149-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Determination of viral concentration was by comparison of the absorbance at 260 nm with a viral stock of known titer (37Ainscow E.K. Zhao C. Rutter G.A. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1149-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). MIN6 cells were infected with a multiplicity of infection of 30, ∼16 h prior to imaging. Primary isolated islet β-cells and MIN6 cells (passages nos. 20 to 30) were cultured and infected with adenoviruses as previously described (38Ainscow E.K. Rutter G.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In each case, the concentration of glucose was lowered to 3 mm for 16 h before experiments. Coverslips (24 mm in diameter) were placed in a thermostatted Leyden chamber, (model TC-202A, Medical Systems Corp.) on the stage of an inverted Leica SP2 confocal imaging system using a 63X (numerical aperture = 1.45) oil immersion objective. All experiments were carried out in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (KRB): 125 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mmNaH2PO4, 0.5 mm MgSO4, 3 mm glucose, 10 mm Hepes, 2 mmNaHCO3, pH 7.4, containing, initially, 3 mmglucose and equilibrated with O2/CO2 (19:1). Images were acquired at a rate of 0.5 s−1 and processed off line. Green and cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) fluorescence were imaged simultaneously through alternate excitation (0.2 s−1) at 430 and 488 nm with emitted fluorescence filtered between 450 and 490 nm and between 520 and 560 nm, respectively. Under these conditions, cross-contamination of the two signals was negligible. MIN6 cells were infected with adenoviral PKCβII·EGFP as described above and cultured overnight in medium containing 3 mm glucose. 1 h prior to imaging, cells were micro-injected using an Eppendorf 5171/5242 micromanipulator/pressure microinjector with a solution of 0.5 μm Calcium Crimson conjugated to 10,000 Da dextran (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), to give an approximate final concentration of 20 nm in the cytosol. The cells were washed once and incubated at 37 °C until use. During imaging, cells were incubated in KRB medium and maintained at 37 °C on a heated stage. Cells that had been successfully injected with Calcium Crimson dye and were expressing the PKCβII·EGFP were identified by epifluorescence and imaged on a Leica confocal imaging spectrophotometer system (TCS-SP) running on a DM/IRBE inverted microscope (×40 objective). Fluorescence of Calcium Crimson (568-nm excitation, Kr laser; 580–640-nm emission) and EGFP (488-nm excitation, Ar laser; 520–560-nm emission) were monitored simultaneously and analyzed using Leica TCS software. Additions were made via a small volume of a stock solution (3.5 m KCl) followed by rapid mixing with a pipette. Changes in Calcium Crimson fluorescence were determined throughout the whole cell and presented as an increase relative to basal fluorescence. EGFP fluorescence was determined in the vicinity (∼1 μm) of the plasma membrane and in the bulk cytosol. The ratio of the average fluorescence of these regions was used as a measure of PKCβII·EGFP translocation. Relative changes in this ratio, normalized to basal conditions, are given. To generate a plasmid encoding plasma membrane-targeted ratiometric pericam (ratiometric-pericam-pm), cDNA encoding ratiometric pericam (35Nagai T. Sawano A. Park E.S. Miyawaki A. Proc Nat. Acad Sci U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3197-3202Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar) was digested usingBamHI/EcoRI. The restricted fragment encoding the pericams was subcloned into pcDNA 3.1(+) (Invitrogen). TheNheI/BamHI fragment of synaptosomal-associated protein of 25-kDa cDNA was inserted with the correct orientation into ratiometric-pericam/pcDNA3.1(+) vector. cDNA encoding an in-frame fusion construct between phogrin (39Wasmeier C. Hutton J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18161-18170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and ECFP was generated by replacement of the Asn1/PstI fragment of phogrin·EGFP (40Pouli A.E. Emmanouilidou E. Zhao C. Wasmeier C. Hutton J.C. Rutter G.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) with the Asn1/Nsi1 fragment from phogrin·Ycam2 (41Emmanouilidou E. Teschemacher A. Pouli A.E. Nicholls L.I. Seward E.P. Rutter G.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (66) Google Scholar) encoding ECFP. Correct orientation and sequence of inserts was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Transfection of MIN6 cells was performed using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions 2–3 days prior to experiments. MIN6 cells in KRB buffer were imaged at 37 °C using an Olympus IX-70 with an IMAGO charge-coupled device camera (Till Photonics GmbH, Grafelfing, Germany) controlled by TillvislON software (Till Photonics). Cells were illuminated alternatively for 100 and 90 ms at 410 and 480 nm, and the emitted light was filtered at 535 nm. The ratio images were used to calculate [Ca2+] off line according to established methods (42Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To assess translocation of PKCβII·EGFP, we employed a TIRF (also known as evanescent wave microscopy) microscope similar to that described previously by Tsuboi et al. (32Tsuboi T. Zhao C. Terakawa S. Rutter G.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1307-1310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 33Tsuboi T. Kikuta T. Warashina A. Terakawa S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 2002; 277: 15957-15961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The incident light for total internal reflection illumination was introduced from the objective lens (Olympus, numerical aperture = 1.65, 100X magnification) through a single mode optical fiber and two illumination lenses. To observe the EGFP fluorescence image, we used a 488-nm laser (argon ion laser, 30 mW, Spectra-Physics) for total internal fluorescence illumination and a long pass filter (515 nm) for barrier. The laser beam was passed through an electromagnetically driven shutter (Till Photonics). The shutter was opened synchronously with camera exposure under control by TillvisilON software (Till Photonics). Images were acquired every 2 s. To analyze the data, translocation events were manually selected and the average fluorescence intensity of individual plasma membrane regions was calculated. Data are given as means ± S.E. of at least three individual experiments. Comparisons between means were performed using one-tailed Student's t test for paired data with Microsoft ExcelTM or Origin 7TM (OriginLab, Northampton, MA) software. Fig. 1 A shows the responses to a stepped increase in glucose concentration from 3 to 25 mm of adenovirally expressed PKCβII·EGFP, imaged by laser-scanning confocal microscopy in primary β-cells. An increase in fluorescence ratio (plasma membrane: cytosol) was observed in 7 of 16 cells examined (from two separate preparations; mean increase 13.5 ± 4.2%), with partial oscillations (i.e. retranslocation to the cytosol) observed in three of seven cells. In some cases, recruitment was “patchy” with evidence of localization on membrane-associated organelles (Fig. 1 A,arrow). Implicating [Ca2+]cincreases in these effects of glucose, cell depolarization with 35 mm KCl (Fig. 1 B) or stimulation of muscarinic receptors with carbachol, 100 μm (Fig. 1 C), also caused a clear increase in the proportion of plasma membrane-bound PKCβII and in each case the appearance of focal points of high fluorescence (arrows). In contrast to PKCβII·EGFP, neither PKCδ·EGFP nor PKCζ·EGFP displayed any detectable change in subcellular distribution in primary β-cells in response to the above stimuli, while phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) caused translocation of PKCδ from the cytosol to the nuclear periphery (not shown; see also Fig. 7 for response in MIN6 cells). To explore the mechanisms involved in the glucose-stimulated translocation of PKCβII·EGFP in more detail we next used clonal MIN6 β-cells. In contrast to primary β-cells, these well differentiated and glucose-responsive cells (43Miyazaki J. Araki K. Yamato E. Ikegami H. Asano T. Shibasaki Y. Oka Y. Yamamura K. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar) can be easily microinjected with both plasmid cDNAs and with Ca2+ indicator dyes (37Ainscow E.K. Zhao C. Rutter G.A. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1149-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) without marked deterioration of cell function. Examined first by laser-scanning confocal microscopy, PKCβII·EGFP translocated to the plasma membrane in response to 25 mmglucose in 7 of 22 MIN6 cells examined (Fig.2 A). Retranslocation to the cytosol was clearly evident in almost half (three of seven) of the cells examined. To provide greater temporal and spatial resolution we next employed TIRF microscopy (31Toomre D. Manstein D.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 298-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 32Tsuboi T. Zhao C. Terakawa S. Rutter G.A. Curr.

Chem. 2002; 277: 15957-15961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This technique involves the generation of a thin (<100 nm) field of fluorescence at the surface of the coverslip and thus at the surface of an attached cell. Hence a fluorophore such as PKCβII·EGFP will only fluoresce as it approaches very close to (within ∼50 nm) the plasma membrane while molecules in the cytosol remain in darkness. Since MIN6 cells display a flattened morphology, this technique was anticipated to permit a more precise quantification of plasma membrane-associated PKCβII. PKCβII EGFP was translocated to the plasma membrane with a half-time of ∼60 s and a peak increase in membrane:cytosolic PKCβII·EGFP of ∼1.5 (Fig. 2 B). Translocation was not provoked by a non-metabolizable sugar (galactose, not shown) and was completely suppressed by chelation of extracellular Ca2+ with EGTA or by cell hyperpolarization with the ATP-sensitive K+ channel opener, diazoxide (Fig. 2 B, trace 4). In some cells, “hot spots” and waves of PKC were clearly detectable (see movie “Fig. 2 B” at http://www.jbc.org). These effects were not observed in cells expressing a membrane-targeted GFP chimera (not shown) and are thus unlikely to result simply from changes in the shape of the cell. Moreover, the effects of glucose upon translocation were only marginally reduced by inhibition of phospholipase C activity withU73122 (Fig. 2 B, trace 5) (44Sanderson M.J. CIBA Found. Symp. 1995; 188: 175-189PubMed Google Scholar) at a concentration (10 μm) that completely inhibited the effects of carbachol on PKCβII translocation (see Fig. 5 B,trace 3; see movie “Fig. 5 B” at http://www.jbc.org for the effect of carbachol alone) or [Ca2+]c (not shown). Changes in free Ca2+concentration were measured throughout the cell cytosol after expression of a ratiometric pericam (35Nagai T. Sawano A. Park E.S. Miyawaki A. Proc Nat. Acad Sci U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3197-3202Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar) in this compartment. Elevating the glucose concentration from 3 to 30 mm caused a gradual increase in [Ca2+]c from ∼200 nm to close to 1 μm (resting 0.18 ± 0.1 μm, maximum 1.03 ± 0.34 μm,n = 10 cells in each case; Fig. 2 C), with a half-time similar to that for the increases in PKCβII associated with the plasma membrane (Fig. 2, A and B). In some cells (4 of 10 examined) the glucose-induced increases were more oscillatory, consisting of spikes on a steadily increasing baseline (Fig. 2 D). We next tested the possibility that highly localized changes in [Ca2+]c immediately beneath the plasma membrane may be involved in PKCβII membrane recruitment. The formation of such a Ca2+ microdomain would be expected to permit phospholipid-dependent interaction of the PKCβII C2 domain with the membrane inner leaflet (45Nalefski E.A. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13216-13229Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), independently of the DAG binding domain (C1) (46Nalefski E.A. Slazas M.M. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12011-12018Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To achieve measurements of [Ca2+]c close to the inner surface of plasma membrane (<10 nm), we targeted the Ca2+ sensor, ratiometric pericam (35Nagai T. Sawano A. Park E.S. Miyawaki A. Proc Nat. Acad Sci U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3197-3202Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar) to this region of the cell. cDNA encoding the pericam was fused in frame with that encoding the soluble N-ethyl maleimide-sensitive factor receptor (t-SNARE), synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP25), which binds to membranes after palmitoylation (47Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar). The SNAP25·pericam chimera displayed a largely plasma membrane localization with some fluorescence on intracellular structures, possibly corresponding to the Golgi apparatus or mature secretory vesicles (Fig. 2 E, monochrome panel) (13Kennedy H.J. Pouli A.E. Jouaville L.S. Rizzuto R. Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13281-13291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Importantly, the molecular targeting of this construct eliminated the need for spatially selective excitation (i.e. by confocal or TIRF microscopy), permitting ratiometric measurement of fluorescence by conventional epifluorescence microscopy. The membrane-targeted pericam displayed a dissociation constant for Ca2+ close to that previously reported for the untargeted construct (1.7 μm) (35Nagai T. Sawano A. Park E.S. Miyawaki A. Proc Nat. Acad Sci U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3197-3202Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar) in digitonin-permeabilized cells (not shown). Resting Ca2+ concentrations reported with this pericam were not significantly different (0.21 μm) compared with the untargeted reporter (0.18 μm, Fig. 2, C andD). However, greater heterogeneity was apparent in the [Ca2+]c increases elicited by elevated glucose concentrations (Fig. 2 E, trace 1 versus 2) in cells expressing the plasma membrane-targeted pericam, with an average difference in the peak [Ca2+]c achieved at two randomly selected locations on the plasma membrane of 0.22 ± 0.06 μm(n = 8 separate cells). By contrast, no significant differences in peak [Ca2+]c in different areas of the cell cytoplasm were detected using the untargeted pericam, either in cells displaying a monotonic response to the sugar (Fig.2 C) or in those in which [Ca2+]coscillations were apparent (Fig. 2 D). Stimulation of Ca2+ influx with either depolarizing concentrations of KCl (in 29 of 34 cells examined, Fig.3, A and B; see movie “Fig. 3 B” at http://www.jbc.org ) or tolbutamide, which closes ATP-sensitive K+ channels (in 16 of 19 cells examined, Fig.4, A and B) caused cle"

These interactions include contacts to an 8–9-bp RNA:DNA hybrid within the active-site cleft of the enzyme, contacts to the melted nontemplate DNA strand in the vicinity of the hybrid, contacts to exiting RNA upstream of the hybrid, and contacts to ∼20 bp of duplex DNA downstream of the active site. Based on characterization of an amino acid substitution (G1161R) and a deletion (Δ1149–1190) in the jaw domain of the bacterial RNA polymerase largest subunit (β′), we report here that contacts of the jaw domain to downstream DNA at the leading edge of the transcription complex contribute to regulation during all three phases of transcription.

RNA polymerase transcription elongation complex nucleotide(s) amino acid(s) Cellular, multisubunit RNA polymerases (RNAPs)1 participate in a complex cycle of conformational changes to initiate, elongate, and terminate RNA transcripts. Each step in this cycle is mediated by a network of protein-nucleic acid interactions composed of interconnected parts of RNAP that contact DNA and product RNA (1Craig M.L. Tsodikov O.V. McQuade K.L.

During elongation, most nucleic acid contacts are made by two large subunits of similar structure and sequence in prokaryotic and eukaryotic RNAPs, called β′ and β in bacteria or RPB1 and RPB2 in eukaryotes. During initiation, these contacts are supplemented by sequence-specific DNA contacts made by auxiliary initiation factors (ς in bacteria) that mediate promoter engagement. In both initiation and elongation complexes, a key component in this protein-nucleic acid interaction network occurs between ∼20 bp of duplex DNA downstream of the polymerization site and a channel in RNAP composed of a trough formed mostly by β′(RPB1) and a cover formed by the lobe domain of β(RPB2). During promoter engagement, establishment of this contact is coupled to formation of the ∼15 bp melted transcription bubble and insertion of the template DNA strand into the active site of RNAP (Refs. 1Craig M.L. Tsodikov O.V. McQuade K.L. Schlax Jr., P.E. Capp M.W. Saecker R.M. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar and 10Saecker R. Tsodikov O. McQuade K.

Upon promoter escape, when RNAP forms a transcription elongation complex (TEC), the downstream contact persists and participates in the response of RNAP to pause, arrest, and termination signals (11LaFlamme S.E.

The downstream DNA interaction, which stretches from the position of duplex melting 1–3 nt in front of the catalytic center to ∼20 bp further downstream, can be subdivided into active-site proximal and active-site distal sets of contacts (Fig.1, B and C). The active-site proximal set of contacts is made at +5 to +8 by the lobe and domain called the clamp (formed mostly by β′), both of which can move relative to the central core of the enzyme (2Darst S.A. Opalka N. Chacon P. Polyakov A. Richter C. Zhang G. Wriggers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4296-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 8Cramer P. Bushnell D. Kornberg R.

Science. 2001; 292: 1876-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). The active-site distal set of contacts is made at +10 to +20 by the clamp and by another feature termed the jaw. In eukaryotic RNAPII, the jaw is extensive and includes an external domain of RBP1 and part of the RPB5 subunit, neither of which are present in bacterial RNAP. In bacterial RNAP, the jaw contact involves only a C-terminal segment of β′. Both major groove and backbone contacts are involved in the downstream DNA interaction of RNAP (7Cramer P. Bushnell D., Fu, J. Gnatt A. Maier-Davis B. Thompson N. Burgess R. Edwards A. David P. Kornberg R. Science. 2000; 288: 640-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 9Gnatt A. Cramer P., Fu, J. Bushnell D. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1876-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar), but it seems likely they will be largely sequence-nonspecific to ensure facile translocation of the duplex during transcription. Ederth et al. (17Ederth J. Isaksson L. Abdulkarim F. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2002; 267: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) recently reported that a deletion (Δ1149–1190) or a single amino acid substitution (G1161R) in the portion of the Escherichia coli RNAP β′ subunit that forms the bacterial jaw domain dramatically reduces the copy number of ColEI-type plasmids. They propose that these changes alter the relative activity of the promoters for the two RNA regulators of ColEI plasmid replication, RNAII and RNAI. Because RNAII primes plasmid replication and RNAI negatively regulates RNAII formation (18Tomizawa J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 683-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), a decrease in RNAII or an increase in RNAI would reduce plasmid copy number. Changes in contacts of RNAP to downstream DNA appear able to reduce promoter activity by reducing the longevity of open complexes formed at certain promoters (Refs. 19Barker M.M. Gaal T. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 689-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar and 20Bartlett M.S. Gaal T. Ross W. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 331-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar; see “Results”). Alternatively, it is possible that changes in transcriptional elongation and pausing, which are mediated in part by the downstream DNA contact, could alter the folding pathway of RNAI or RNAII (21Pan T. Artsimovitch I. Fang X.W. Landick R. Sosnick T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9545-9550Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To investigate these ideas further and to test the role of the RNAP jaw-downstream DNA contact in RNAP function, we purified RNAPs containing these alterations and tested their effects on transcription initiation and elongationin vitro using assays that reveal separate steps in the transcription cycle. Oligonucleotides were obtained from Operon Technologies (Alameda, CA); NTPs from AmershamBiosciences; [α-32P]CTP and [α-32P]UTP from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; and other chemicals from Sigma. Wild-type and mutant RNAPs were purified by chitin-affinity chromatography and intein-mediated removal of the chitin-binding domain tag after overexpression from a T7 RNAP-based expression plasmid, as described elsewhere. 2I. Artsimovitch, V. Svetlov, K. S. Murakami, and R. Landick, manuscript in preparation. To obtain overexpression plasmids encoding β′G1161R and β′Δ(1149–1190),rpoC fragments containing these mutations were PCR-amplified from strains JE1134 or JE221 (17Ederth J. Isaksson L. Abdulkarim F. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2002; 267: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) using oligonucleotides 101E and 102E (Table I), digested with SalI and BspEI, and then ligated into SalI, BspEI-cut pRL663, which expresses C-terminally His6-tagged β′ from alacI-regulated trc promoter (22Wang D.

The mutantrpoC genes were then transferred to the RNAP overexpression plasmid pIA4232 on a BsmI to XhoI fragment that is unique in both plasmids. Wild-type and mutant RNAP holoenzymes (core β′βα2 plus ς70) were prepared by incubating a 5-fold molar excess of ς70 with core enzyme for 30 min at 30 °C. ς70 was purified as described previously (23Gribskov M.

Linear templates for in vitro transcription were generated by PCR amplification and purified using QIAspin PCR purification reagents (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Supercoiled plasmids were isolated using the Qiagen midiprep reagents. DNA templates for open complex stability measurements (plasmids and primers for amplification of linear templates) were kindly provided by M. Barker and R. Gourse (University of Wisconsin, Madison). Lifetimes of open complexes were measured on supercoiled plasmid DNA (rrnB P1 and RNAII) or linear DNA templates (lacUV5 and λPR) using single-round transcription assays (24Leirmo S. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 555-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). RNAP and template DNA were incubated ∼15 min at 30 °C in initiation buffer (40 mmTris·HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) with different concentrations of NaCl (rrnB P1, 7.5 mm; RNAII, 35 mm;lacUV5, 100 mm; λPR, 150 mm). Aliquots (10 μl) were removed to a tube containing 1.5 μl of NTPs to yield final concentrations of 200 μmATP (1 mm ATP for the rrnB P1 promoter), 200 μm GTP, 200 μm CTP, and 10 μm[α-32P]UTP (50 Ci/mmol) at different times after heparin addition (10 μg/ml final concentration). Transcription was stopped after 10 min by addition of an equal volume of formamide loading buffer, and RNA samples were analyzed as described below. Elongation complexes were formed with 40 nm linear DNA template and 50 nm RNAP holoenzyme in 20–100 μl of transcription buffer (20 mmTris·HCl, 20 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 14 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.9). On the T7 A1 promoter templates, elongation complexes were halted at positions indicated in figure legends when transcription is initiated in the absence of UTP, with ApU at 150 μm, ATP and GTP at 2.5 μm, [α-32P]CTP at 1 μm. Halted complexes were formed for 15 min at 37 °C and stored on ice prior to use. Halted A29 complexes were formed on a linear DNA template containing a portion of the rpoB gene (Table I). Transcription was restarted by addition of NTPs to 40 μm each, and heparin to 50 μg/ml. Samples were combined at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 240, 480, and 600 s with an equal volume of stop buffer (10m urea, 98 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 25 mm Na2EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue) and analyzed as described below. Halted complexes were formed as described above in 50 μl of transcription buffer. Transcription was restarted by addition of nucleotides (ATP, CTP, and UTP to 150 μm; GTP to 10 μm) and heparin to 50 μg/ml. Samples were combined at times shown in the figures and after a final 5-min incubation with 250 μm each NTP (chase) with an equal volume of stop buffer and analyzed as described below. A29 complexes were formed on a linear DNA template (PCR-amplified fragment of pIA171) for 15 min at 37 °C. At time 0, KCl was added to a final concentration of 1 m, and samples were shifted to 45 °C to facilitate dissociation of the TECs. At increasing times (see Fig. 6), aliquots of the TEC were removed to 37 °C and transcription was restarted by addition of NTPs to 250 μm and heparin to 50 μg/ml. Following a 5-min incubation, reactions were quenched by the addition of an equal volume of stop buffer and analyzed as described below. Halted [α-32P]CTP-labeled A20 elongation complexes were prepared as above in 20 μl of transcription buffer with 40 nm linear DNA template and 50 nm RNAP holoenzymes containing ς70. Elongation was started by addition of NTPs to 400 μm each, KCl to 100 mm, and heparin to 25 μg/ml. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and stopped by addition of an equal volume of the stop buffer. Samples were heated for 2 min at 90 °C and separated by electrophoresis in denaturing 5–15% polyacrylamide gels (19:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) in 7 m urea, 44 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 1.25 mmNa2EDTA). Gels were dried, and the RNA products were visualized and quantified using PhosphorImager screens and ImageQuant Software (Amersham Biosciences). Pause half-life (time during which half of the complexes re-enter the elongation pathway) and pause efficiency (fraction of transcribing RNAP molecules that pause) were determined by nonlinear regression analysis as described (25Landick R. Wang D. Chan C. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 334-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Termination efficiencies were calculated as described by Reynoldset al. (15Reynolds R. Bermúdez-Cruz R.M. Chamberlin M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 31-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We began by testing a simple explanation for the finding that RNAII promoter (PRNAII) activity decreases in the jaw deletion mutant, whereas PRNAI activity increases (17Ederth J. Isaksson L. Abdulkarim F. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2002; 267: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), namely that the jaw mutants reduce the kinetic stability of open initiation complexes. Although the detailed mechanism of open complex formation involves at least three steps and can vary among promoters (10Saecker R. Tsodikov O. McQuade K. Schlax Jr., P. Capp M. Record Jr., M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 649-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), it can be generalized as an initial, RNAP concentration-dependent binding step to form closed complexes, which is rapid and characterized by an equilibrium constant K B, and subsequent RNAP-concentration-independent isomerization steps to form open complexes, which are characterized by composite rate constantsk 2 and k −2 (Refs. 26Chamberlin M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1974; 43: 721-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar and27McClure W.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 171-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar; Reaction 1). RNAP+P⇄KBRPc⇄k−2k2RPo(→+NTPTEC) REACTION1When k −2 is fast relative tok 2 (making open complexes kinetically unstable), the overall rate of initiation is sensitive to changes ink −2, whereas when k −2is slow relative to k 2 (making kinetically stable open complexes), the overall rate of initiation is insensitive to changes in k −2, and can even increasein vivo as a result of indirect effects (19Barker M.M. Gaal T. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 689-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 28Zhou Y.N. Jin D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This is true for two reasons. First, short-lived open complexes exist in a dynamic competition between collapse back to the closed complexversus NTP binding and productive initiation. An increase in k −2 will shift the competition away from productive initiation at these promoters while having little effect on initiation at promoters for which open complexes are long-lived relative to the time required for NTP binding and productive initiation. Second, the majority of cellular transcription is mediated by kinetically unstable open complexes formed at rRNA promoters. Thus, factors that decrease transcription from rRNA promoters (e.g. by increasing k −2 generally) also indirectly increase initiation at promoters that form long-lived open complexes by increasing the pool of RNAP available for promoter binding in cells (28Zhou Y.N. Jin D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2908-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 29Barker M.M. Gaal T. Josaitis C.A. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 673-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Because downstream DNA contacts are known to contribute to open complex longevity (19Barker M.M. Gaal T. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 689-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 20Bartlett M.S. Gaal T. Ross W. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 331-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and because PRNAI is known to form kinetically stable open complexes (24Leirmo S. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 555-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 28Zhou Y.N. Jin D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2908-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 29Barker M.M.

Science. 1997; 278: 2092-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), it is plausible that the RNAP jaw alterations could reduce plasmid copy number by directly reducing PRNAIIactivity and indirectly increasing PRNAI activity. To test this possibility, we examined the kinetic stability of open complexes formed at PRNAI, PRNAII, and three additional, well studied promoters: rrnB P1, lacUV5, and λPR. To measure open complex lifetimes, we incubated pre-formed open complexes with heparin, which acts as a competitor to trap free RNAP (31Pfeffer S.R. Stahl S.J. Chamberlin M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5403-5407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and then added radiolabeled NTPs to samples taken at increasing times to measure the fraction of complexes still able to form a productive RNA transcript (Ref. 24Leirmo S. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 555-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar; see “Experimental Procedures”). The mutant RNAPs exhibited dramatically decreased half-lives for PRNAII, rrnB P1,lac UV5, and λPR, as reflected by rapid disappearance of the ability to make RNA transcripts after addition of heparin (by factors of 10–40; Fig. 2 and Table II; note that the half-lives for different promoters cannot be compared with each other directly because the conditions differ among assays). In contrast, the longevity of open complexes formed at PRNAI was too long to measure, and thus we were unable to determine whether the mutants also affected the half-life of open complexes formed at this promoter (Fig. 2). However, the persistence of open complexes at PRNAI provides a useful control showing that the mutant RNAPs were fully active and did not yield inherently defective open complexes; rather, the relatively uniform 10–40-fold effect on k −2 of the jaw mutants likely fails to increase k −2 at PRNAI to a range that can be measured.Table IIHalf-lives of open complexes formed by wild-type and mutant RNAPsPromoterConditions2-aConcentrations given are of NaCl in the initiation reactions.

Open table in a new tab We conclude that altering the downstream DNA jaw of RNAP dramatically reduces open complex longevity at several promoters. In principle, this could result either from a decrease in the thermodynamic stability of open complexes or a decrease in the activation barrier between open and closed complexes. The latter effect, however, would also increase the rate of open complex formation (k 2) and counteract reduced initiation caused by increasingk −2. Because the jaw alterations were found to decrease transcription from PRNAII in vivo (17Ederth J. Isaksson L. Abdulkarim F. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2002; 267: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the most reasonable interpretation of our results is that the jaw domain of bacterial RNAPs makes a contact to downstream DNA that stabilizes the open complex. It also is possible that the jaw mutants affect elongation by RNAP and that changes in transcript elongation cause or contribute to lowered ColE1 plasmid copy number. Downstream DNA contacts are known to influence pausing by RNAP (11LaFlamme S.E. Kramer F.R. Mills D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8425-8440Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 13Lee D.N.

Biol. 1997; 268: 54-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and the pattern or extent of pausing could influence folding or interaction of RNAI and RNAII (21Pan T. Artsimovitch I. Fang X.W. Landick R. Sosnick T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9545-9550Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), which is the central event in the inhibition of replication primer formation by RNAI (18Tomizawa J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 683-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To ask how jaw alterations affect the activities of the TEC, we first tested their effects on the overall rate of transcript elongation. We formed initially halted TECs (at position 29 by withholding UTP during initiation) on a template that specified a fragment of the E. coli rpoB gene downstream from the halt site (see “Experimental Procedures”). Upon adjustment of all four NTP concentrations to 40 μm each, wild-type and mutant RNAPs resumed elongation and formed a run-off transcript in less than 1 min. However, β′Δ(1141–1190) RNAP reached the template end approximately twice as fast as wild type (half the TECs completed the run-off transcript in ∼20 s, rather than ∼40 s for wild type). β′GR1161 exhibited a much less dramatic increase in elongation rate. The increased elongation rate of β′(1141–1190) RNAP was reflected in a decrease in pausing at several prominent sites within therpoB gene (Fig. 3 A,arrows). We concluded that the downstream jaw contact of bacterial RNAP is partially responsible for recognition of transcriptional pause sites. Thus, reduced pausing and consequent effects on RNA folding also might influence the competition between RNAI-RNAII interaction and replication primer formation in ColEI plasmids. To investigate the role of the jaw domain in transcriptional pausing further, we tested examples of two classes of pause signals: the class I his leader pause signal, for which escape from the paused state is inhibited by RNA secondary structure called a pause hairpin, and the class II pheP opspause signal, for which escape from the paused state is inhibited by backtracking of RNAP along the RNA and DNA chains (34Artsimovitch I. Landick R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7090-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Both types of pausing occur in a two-step mechanism: isomerization to the paused state in competition with elongation past the site, followed by slow escape from the paused state. For the class I his pause, the downstream DNA sequence, as well as the RNA:DNA hybrid region and the bases in the active site, influence both steps (22Wang D. Meier T. Chan C. Feng G. Lee D. Landick R. Cell. 1995; 81: 341-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar); these three components plus the pause hairpin additively delay escape from the pause state by nucleotide addition (32Chan C.L. Landick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 25-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 33Chan C. Wang D. Landick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 54-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The determinants of the class II ops pause have not been analyzed. However, by analogy to the class II human immunodeficiency virus type 1 pause signal that affects human RNAPII, they include the thermodynamic stability of the RNA:DNA hybrid in the active conformation of the TEC, the hybrid stability in the backtracked TEC that forms at the pause site (35Nudler E.

The mature form of yeast frataxin (mYfh1p) assembles stepwise into a multimer of 840 kDa (α48) that accumulates iron in a water-soluble form. Here, two distinct iron oxidation reactions are shown to take place during the initial assembly step (α → α3). A ferroxidase reaction with a stoichiometry of 2 Fe(II)/O2 is detected at Fe(II)/mYfh1p ratios of ≤0.5. Ferroxidation is progressively overcome by autoxidation at Fe(II)/mYfh1p ratios of >0.5. Gel filtration analysis indicates that an oligomer of mYfh1p, α3, is responsible for both reactions. The observed 2 Fe(II)/O2 stoichiometry implies production of H2O2 during the ferroxidase reaction. However, only a fraction of the expected total H2O2 is detected in solution. Oxidative degradation of mYfh1p during the ferroxidase reaction suggests that most H2O2reacts with the protein. Accordingly, the addition of mYfh1p to a mixture of Fe(II) and H2O2 results in significant attenuation of Fenton chemistry. Multimer assembly is fully inhibited under anaerobic conditions, indicating that mYfh1p is activated by Fe(II) in the presence of O2. This combination induces oligomerization and mYfh1p-catalyzed Fe(II) oxidation, starting a process that ultimately leads to the sequestration of as many as 50 Fe(II)/subunit inside the multimer.

Mitochondria contain micromolar concentrations of chelatable iron (1Petrat F. de Groot H. Rauen U. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), i.e. iron that is not yet complexed in heme or iron-sulfur clusters and is bioavailable (2Tangeras A. Biochim. Biophys.

Keeping this iron pool in soluble and nontoxic form represents a remarkable biological challenge given the alkaline pH (3Darnell J. Lodish H. Baltimore D. Molecular Cell Biology. Scientific American Books, New York1990: 583-616Google Scholar) and the high production of O 2⨪ and H2O2(4Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1999: 1-34Google Scholar) within mitochondria. Thus, the existence of proteins capable of handling iron safely within mitochondria was first postulated several decades ago (5Flatmark T. Romslo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6433-6438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have identified a handful of inner mitochondrial membrane proteins involved in mitochondrial iron transport (6Kispal G. Csere P. Guiard B. Lill R.

The mitochondrial matrix protein frataxin has been implicated in mitochondrial iron homeostasis (10Babcock M. de Silva D. Oaks R. Davis-Kaplan S. Jiralerspong S. Montermini L. Pandolfo M. Kaplan J.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), but its precise function is still not known. Frataxin was first identified as the protein deficient in Friedreich ataxia, a neuro- and cardio-degenerative disease (12Campuzano V. Montermini L. Molto M.D. Pianese L. Cossee M. Cavalcanti F. Monros E. Rodius F. Duclos F. Monticelli A. et al.Science. 1996; 271: 1423-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (2284) Google Scholar). Studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have shown that defects in yeast or human frataxin are associated with the accumulation of iron in mitochondria and oxidative damage to both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA as well as to the iron-sulfur centers of mitochondrial aconitase and other respiratory enzymes (10Babcock M. de Silva D.

Similarly, mouse models in which the frataxin gene is selectively inactivated in neuronal or cardiac tissue present multiple respiratory enzyme deficits and accumulate iron in mitochondria in a time-dependent manner (16Puccio H.

In agreement with these observations, evidence of abnormal cellular iron homeostasis, increased oxidative damage, and respiratory enzyme deficits has been reported for the human disease (reviewed in Ref. 17Patel P.I.

We have proposed that the apparent involvement of frataxin in so many diverse processes could be explained if the basic function of this protein were to provide an iron storage mechanism to keep iron in a bioavailable and nontoxic form (17Patel P.I.

Indeed, titration of the mature form of yeast frataxin (mYfh1p) with Fe(II) under aerobic conditions results in stepwise assembly of a 48-subunit multimer with a molecular mass of 840 kDa and a hydrodynamic radius of 11 nm that sequesters 50 atoms of iron/subunit and forms iron-rich cores with a diameter of 2–4 nm (23Adamec J.

Gacy M.A. Twesten R.D. Owen W.G. Isaya G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6798-6804Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Similarly, the mature form of human frataxin assembles naturally during expression in Escherichia coli yielding regular multimers of ∼1 MDa and ordered polymers of these multimers that sequester ∼10 atoms of iron/subunit (25Cavadini P. O'Neill H.A. Benada O. Isaya G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 33: 217-227Crossref Google Scholar). Frataxin can be detected in a high molecular mass complex under native conditions in yeast or mouse heart, and both the yeast and the human protein bind stoichiometric amounts of 55Fe in metabolically labeled yeast cells (23Adamec J.

Benada O. Isaya G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 33: 217-227Crossref Google Scholar). In this study, we investigate the iron oxidation reaction of yeast frataxin. Our results support a direct role for frataxin in iron metabolism. HEPES, ferrous ammonium sulfate, 2-deoxyribose, thiobarbituric acid, and α-α′-bipyridine were from Sigma, and beef liver catalase was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All of the buffers and solutions were made with milli-Q deionized water. Stock solutions of ferrous ammonium sulfate (2–10 mm; pH 3.6) were freshly prepared in water previously deaerated by purging with argon gas (<0.2 ppm O2). Recombinant mYfh1p was expressed in E. coli (23Adamec J. Rusnak F. Owen W.G. Naylor S. Benson L.M. Gacy A.M. Isaya G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 67: 549-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and purified as previously described (24Gakh O. Adamec J. Gacy M.A. Twesten R.D. Owen W.G. Isaya G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6798-6804Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined from the absorbance and extinction coefficient of mYfh1p monomer (ε280 = 20,000 m−1cm−1). Iron concentration measurements were carried out by inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy at the Metals Laboratory, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN. Measurements of dissolved O2concentration were performed with a MI-730 micro-O2electrode connected to an O2-ADPT adapter (Microelectrodes, Inc., NH). A TBX-68T isothermal terminal block connected to a NI 4350 high precision voltage meter and a personal computer with the LabVIEW Base Package (National Instruments, Austin, TX) were used for data acquisition. The electrode was calibrated with HEPES-KOH buffer at each experimental pH and temperature, using buffer deaerated by extensive purging with argon gas (<0.2 ppm O2) (0% standard) and air-saturated buffer (21% standard). To determine the O2electrode response time, the electrode was equilibrated in air-saturated water and then quickly plunged into a rapidly stirred 100 mm dithionite solution or a deaerated solution, and the electrode output was measured versus time (26Yang X. Chen-Barrett Y. Arosio P. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9743-9750Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The electrode response followed first order kinetics with a half-life of 6 s. The drift of the O2 electrode was not significant (∼1 μm O2/40 min). O2consumption was monitored in a 0.6-ml cell. After addition of buffer with or without protein, the cell was sealed with a rubber stopper fitted with the O2 microelectrode described above and a cone-shaped capillary (height, 4.5 cm; volume, 200 μl) with the vertex toward the inside of the cell. The capillary was partially filled with buffer and used as a port to eliminate empty air space and air bubbles. The final volume of the sample in the cell was 0.465 ml. During measurements, the sample was rapidly stirred with a microspin bar, and the temperature was maintained constant by use of a water jacket connected to a circulating water bath. The diffusion of O2 to and from the cell was determined to be insignificant over a period of 40 min. The reactions were started by adding anaerobically prepared Fe(II) stock solution (5–15 μl of total volume added) to the sample using a gas-tight syringe with a 22-gauge needle that was inserted into the cell through the buffer-filled capillary. HEPES is known to retard Fe(II) oxidation, albeit to a much lower degree compared with other Good's buffers (27Yang X. Chasteen N.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 615-618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To minimize this effect, a relatively low concentration (10 mm) of HEPES-KOH buffer was used for O2 consumption measurements, which was sufficient to maintain the pH at 7.0–6.97 at all iron concentrations tested. An aliquot of Fe(II) stock solution was directly added to 10 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, with or without protein present. The samples (500 μl) were incubated at 30 °C for different times and immediately transferred to a Ultrafree-0.5 cell (nominal molecular weight limit = 5,000) (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C. The concentrate and the filtrate were transferred to Eppendorf tubes, a few crystals of dithionite and α-α′-bipyridine (final concentration, 2 mm) were added to each sample, and the concentration of Fe[α-α′-bipyridine]32+(ε520 = 9,000 m−1cm−1) was determined in a DU640B spectrophotometer (Beckman, Fullerton, CA) (28Richards T.D. Pitts K.R. Watt G.D. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1996; 61: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). After removal of the concentrate, insoluble iron was stripped from the Ultrafree membrane by adding 500 μl of buffer containing a few crystals of dithionite and 2 mm α-α′-bipyridine and by mixing vigorously for 1 min, followed by absorbance measurements at 520 nm as described above. For gel filtration analysis of assembly reaction products, the samples (1 ml) were centrifuged for 5 min at 20,800 × g at 4 °C and loaded onto a Superdex 200 column (23Adamec J. Rusnak F. Owen W.G. Naylor S. Benson L.M. Gacy A.M. Isaya G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 67: 549-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In anaerobic experiments, the buffer and the protein stock solution were made anaerobic by purging with moisturized argon gas (<0.2 ppm O2). Protein and Fe(II) were added to 2-ml vials sealed with a rubber septum (Sherwood Medical, St. Louis, MO) (final volume, 100 μl) by a gas-tight syringe, and the assembly reaction was incubated for 1 h at 30 °C (23Adamec J.

After cooling of the sample at 4 °C to stop any ongoing assembly reaction (24Gakh O. Adamec J. Gacy M.A. Twesten R.D. Owen W.G. Isaya G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6798-6804Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), a 50-μl aliquot was loaded onto a TSK-GEL G4000SW column (7.5 mm × 30 cm) (Tosoh Biosep, Montgomeryville, PA) using a 50-μl loop and a gas-tight syringe. The column was equilibrated with 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.3, 100 mm NaCl, previously deaerated by purging with research grade nitrogen gas (<0.5 ppm O2). The protein was eluted with 19 ml of the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min at 4 °C. To determine the production of H2O2 by electrode oximetry, catalase (2,600–3,900 units) was added to 0.465 ml of 96 μmmYfh1p in 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, either before or after the addition of Fe(II), and the O2 consumption and Fe(II)/O2 stoichiometry for the completed reaction were measured (29Zhao G. Bou-Abdallah F. Yang X. Arosio P. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10832-10838Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Production of H2O2 was further measured by the Amplex Red hydrogen peroxide/peroxidase assay kit from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR) (29Zhao G. Bou-Abdallah F. Yang X. Arosio P. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10832-10838Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). All of the reactions (1 ml) were performed in vials sealed with a rubber septum according to the manufacturer's protocol except that 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, was used instead of 50 mm phosphate pH 7.4 buffer (29Zhao G. Bou-Abdallah F. Yang X. Arosio P. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10832-10838Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The fluorescence intensity of samples in which Fe(II) was added to mYfh1p in the presence of Amplex Red and horseradish peroxidase (Amplex Red/HRP)1 was not significantly different from that of samples in which Amplex Red/HRP was added after the addition of Fe(II). In subsequent experiments, Fe(II) was therefore added to mYfh1p in the presence of Amplex Red/HRP. For standard curves, known concentrations of H2O2 were added to buffer in the presence of Amplex Red/HRP. Both H2O2 standards and unknown samples were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C and treated identically. Fluorescence emission was measured in a QuantaMaster fluorimeter (Photon Technology International, Ontario, Canada) from 570 to 610 nm with excitation at 530 nm. The concentration of H2O2 was calculated from the area under each fluorescence emission curve. Background fluorescence was determined with buffer containing Amplex Red/HRP for H2O2standards, and with buffer containing Amplex Red/HRP and the appropriate Fe(II) concentration for unknown samples. The absorbance at 530 nm was <0.02 for all samples. OxyBlot kit (Intergen, Purchase, NY) was used to detect protein oxidation. The reactions (25 μl) containing mYfh1p in the absence or presence of Fe(II) were incubated under the experimental conditions used in the Amplex Red/HRP assays described above, after which carbonyl groups were derivatized to 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone (DNP) by reaction with an equal volume of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine for 25 min at room temperature and neutralized according to the manufacturer's protocol. The samples were analyzed by 12% SDS/PAGE and Western blotting (30Branda S.S. Yang Z.Y. Chew A. Isaya G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1099-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) using a polyclonal anti-DNP antiserum. Following immunodetection of carbonyls, the proteins were detected by SYPRO Ruby staining of the membrane (Molecular Probes, Inc.). In oxidative degradation assays, different combinations of 48 μm Fe(II), 24 μmH2O2, and/or 5 mm 2-deoxyribose were incubated in 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, in the absence or presence of 96 μm mYfh1p (final volume, 200 μl) for 30 min at 30 °C. Phosphoric acid (4%) and thiobarbituric acid (1%) were added (200 μl each), and each sample was boiled for 15 min. After cooling of the samples on ice for 3 min, 75 μl of 10% SDS was added, and a malondialdehyde-thiobarbituric acid adduct (ε532 = 1.54 × 105m−1 cm−1) was measured as described by Halliwell and Gutteridge (31Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. FEBS Lett. 1981; 128: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Electrode oximetry was used to study the iron oxidation reaction of mYfh1p at low Fe(II)/mYfh1p ratios. We showed previously that these conditions result in the assembly of an oligomeric species, α3, predicted to represent the building unit of the mYfh1p multimer (23Adamec J. Rusnak F. Owen W.G. Naylor S. Benson L.M. Gacy A.M. Isaya G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 67: 549-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Fig.1 A shows the O2consumption curves recorded when 24, 48, or 144 μm Fe(II) was incubated in 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, at 30 °C, in the absence or presence of 96 μm mYfh1p. At 24 or 48 μm Fe(II), O2 consumption was facilitated in the presence of mYfh1p (Fig. 1 A). The stoichiometric Fe(II)/O2 ratios at the end of these two reactions were 2.2 and 2.4 (Fig. 1 A). Stoichiometric Fe(II)/O2ratios of 3.5 and 3.2 were otherwise measured when 24 or 48 μm Fe(II), respectively, was incubated in buffer without mYfh1p (Fig. 1 A). At 144 μm Fe(II), similar stoichiometric Fe(II)/O2 ratios of 3.9 and 4.0 were determined in the presence or absence of mYfh1p, respectively (Fig.1 A). A Fe(II)/O2 stoichiometry of ∼2 was consistently observed in repeated measurements at 24, 36, or 48 μm Fe(II) in the presence of 96 μm mYfh1p, corresponding to a Fe(II)/mYfh1p ratio of ≤0.5 (Fig. 1 B). A Fe(II)/O2 stoichiometry of 2.3 ± 0.4 (n = 4) was similarly determined in the presence of 30 μm Fe(II) and 60 μm mYfh1p (Fe(II)/mYfh1p = 0.5) (data not shown). However, the Fe(II)/O2 stoichiometry progressively increased to a maximum value of ∼4 at a Fe(II)/mYfh1p ratio of >0.5 (Fig.1 B). In contrast, an average Fe(II)/O2stoichiometry of ∼3.6 was consistently obtained in buffer without protein at different Fe(II) concentrations (Fig. 1 B). This was also the case when 30 μm Fe(II) was incubated at 20 °C in the absence or presence of 96 μm mYfh1p (Fe(II)/mYfh1p = 0.3), yielding a Fe(II)/O2stoichiometry of 4.3 ± 0.9 (n = 3) and 2.5 ± 0.4 (n = 2), respectively (data not shown). A Fe(II)/O2 stoichiometry of 2 is typical of the ferroxidation reaction of H-ferritin (26Yang X. Chen-Barrett Y. Arosio P. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9743-9750Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 32Waldo G.S. Theil E.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13262-13269Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The results reported above are therefore consistent with the presence of ferroxidase activity when ≤0.5 Fe(II) equivalents are added to mYfh1p, with autoxidation overriding ferroxidation at higher Fe(II)/mYfh1p ratios. In addition, at a Fe(II)/mYfh1p ratio ≤0.5, we have detected production of H2O2 (see below). These results together support a ferroxidation site similar to that of H-ferritin, in which H2O2 is produced from two-electron reduction of O2 at a binuclear iron center (27Yang X. Chasteen N.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 615-618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During iron deposition in vertebrate ferritins, autoxidation overrides ferroxidation when the Fe(II) concentration exceeds 2 Fe(II)/ferroxidation site (27Yang X. Chasteen N.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 615-618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This threshold corresponds to ≤2 Fe(II)/H-subunit, because each H-subunit contains one binuclear iron ferroxidation site (27Yang X. Chasteen N.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 615-618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we have assumed a binuclear iron site for mYfh1p and have estimated the number of ferroxidation sites per subunit using the following equation. Ferroxidation sites/subunit=0.5–0.6Fe(II)/subunit2Fe(II)/ferroxidation siteEquation 1 where “0.5–0.6 Fe(II)/subunit” is the smallest interval determined in Fig. 1 B within which autoxidation overcomes the ferroxidation reaction of mYfh1p, and “2 Fe(II)/ferroxidation site” is the threshold that cannot be exceeded to observe ferroxidase activity, as described for H-ferritin (27Yang X. Chasteen N.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 615-618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The equation yields a value of 0.25–0.30, suggesting a ferroxidation site formed by four or three subunits. A three-subunit site would be consistent with the progression, α→ α3 → α6 → α12 → α24 → α48, determined previously by gel filtration analysis of the iron-dependent stepwise assembly of mYfh1p (23Adamec J.

Gacy M.A. Twesten R.D. Owen W.G. Isaya G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6798-6804Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Importantly, α3, not α, was the smallest iron-containing species detected in this progression (23Adamec J. Rusnak F. Owen W.G. Naylor S. Benson L.M. Gacy A.M. Isaya G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 67: 549-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). To identify the form of mYfh1p responsible for iron oxidation, monomer (96 μm) was incubated with Fe(II) at a Fe(II)/mYfh1p ratio of 0.25, 0.5, or 1.5 at 30 °C for 25 min, which is the average time required for the iron oxidation reaction to be completed under these experimental conditions (Fig. 1 A). Immediately afterward, each reaction was subjected to ultrafiltration at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C with a molecular mass cut-off of ≤5 kDa. In controls containing buffer without mYfh1p, most iron was recovered in the flow-through and/or in insoluble form (Table I). In all reactions containing mYfh1p, however, most iron was recovered in the concentrate (Table I), indicating that it was bound to the protein. The Fe(III)/mYfh1p ratios in the concentrate from the three reactions analyzed in Table I were 0.21, 0.43, and 1.2. These ratios are close to the initial Fe(II)/mYfh1p ratio of 0.25, 0.5, and 1.5, respectively, indicating that most added iron was bound to mYfh1p at the end of the oxidation reaction.Table IAnalysis of iron binding by mYfh1p oligomer (α3)Fe2+/mYfh1p ratio1-aA fixed concentration of mYfh1p (96 μm) was incubated with 24, 48, and 144 μmFe(II) for 25 min under the conditions used for electrode oximetry in Fig. 1.

Open table in a new tab To identify the iron-binding species, duplicates of reactions Fe(II)/mYfh1p = 0.5 and Fe(II)/mYfh1p = 1.5 were incubated at 30 °C for 2 or 25 min and immediately analyzed by Superdex 200 gel filtration. In all four samples, most protein was recovered in peak α, corresponding to mYfh1p monomer (Fig.2). Inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy analysis demonstrated that peak α did not contain any significant levels of iron as previously reported (23Adamec J. Rusnak F. Owen W.G. Naylor S.

Genet. 2000; 67: 549-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), was observed in both reactions at each time point analyzed (Fig. 2). At 25 min, the Fe(III)/mYfh1p ratio in peak α3 was 0.6 for reaction Fe(II)/mYfh1p = 0.5 and 1.7 for reaction Fe(II)/mYfh1p = 1.5. These ratios are close to those determined by ultrafiltration (see above), suggesting that α3 is the iron-binding species present at the end of the iron oxidation reaction. Consistent with this interpretation, in Fig. 2 there is a small decrease in theA 280 of peak α from 2 to 25 min, and a concomitant increase in the A 280 of peak α3 that is not completely accounted for by the decrease in peak α. Nearly identical chromatograms were obtained in two independent gel filtration analyses, one of which is shown in Fig. 2, indicating that these results are reproducible. The time-dependent increase in peak α3 intensity can therefore be explained by progressive conversion of monomer to α3 and, consistent with the time course of O2consumption in Fig. 1 A, by progressive deposition of iron oxides inside α3. These data support the conclusion that α3 forms during, and represents the main iron-binding species at the completion of, reactions Fe(II)/mYfh1p = 0.5 and Fe(II)/mYfh1p = 1.5. However, when the completed reactions are analyzed by gel filtration, peak α3 accounts for only a small fraction of the total iron and protein, whereas most protein is eluted from the Superdex 200 column as iron-free monomer (Fig. 2). This suggests that α3 disassembles during gel filtration because it is not stable. By analogy with H-ferritin (26Yan"
https://openalex.org/W2001881897,"Recent studies have indicated that bile acids regulate the expression of several genes involved in bile acid and lipid metabolism as ligands for the farnesoid X receptor (FXR). We report here that bile acids are directly able to govern cholesterol metabolism by a novel mechanism. We show that chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) enhances low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene expression in human cultured cell lines (HeLa, Hep G2, and Caco-2). The proteolytic activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2), a major regulator for LDL receptor gene expression, is not affected by CDCA. Both deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid as well as CDCA, but not ursodeoxycholic acid, increase the mRNA level for the LDL receptor, even when Hep G2 cells are cultured with 25-hydroxycholesterol, a potent suppressor of gene expression for the LDL receptor. Although it seems possible that FXR might be involved in genetic regulation, both reporter assays with a reporter gene containing the LDL receptor promoter as well as Northern blot analysis reveal that FXR is not involved in the process. On the other hand, inhibition of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activities, which are found to be induced by CDCA, abolishes the CDCA-mediated up-regulation of LDL receptor gene expression. We further demonstrate that CDCA stabilizes LDL receptor mRNA and that the MAP kinase inhibitors accelerate its turnover. Taken together, these results indicate that bile acids increase LDL uptake and the intracellular cholesterol levels through the activation of MAP kinase cascades in conjunction with a down-regulation of bile acid biosynthesis by FXR. This work opens up a new avenue for developing pharmaceutical interventions that lower plasma LDL by stabilizing LDL receptor mRNA.

They are required for the efficient absorption of dietary fats and lipid-soluble vitamins in the gut. In humans, more than 90% of bile acids released into the duodenum are reabsorbed and returned to the liver, after which they are secreted again into bile. The catabolism of cholesterol to bile acid and their excretion are the main mechanisms for cholesterol elimination from the body and thus play important roles in cholesterol homeostasis. Elevated concentrations of cholesterol within the liver promote bile acid synthesis through an increase in cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7a1) activity at the transcription level, the rate-limiting enzyme of the pathway. On the other hand,CYP7a1 expression is repressed by bile acids. Thus,CYP7a1 is under the influence of both feed forward and feedback regulation (1Kliewer S.A. Lehmann J.M. Willson T.M.

LXRα is activated by cholesterol derivatives such as 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol and 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol and binds to a response element in the CYP7a1 promoter, thereby stimulating gene expression (5Lehmann J.M.

Another cholesterol derivative, 25-hydroxycholesterol, is not active on LXRα but is a potent regulator for the membrane-bound transcription factors designated as SREBP, members of the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper family, which govern the transcription of genes for cholesterol synthesis enzymes as well as the LDL receptor (9Brown B.S.

Several different oxysterols and bile acids exert distinct effects on cholesterol and bile acid metabolism by regulating the activities of transcription factors and nuclear receptors. Although it has been reported that the number as well as the genetic expression of the LDL receptor are up-regulated by CDCA (16Taniguchi T. Chen J. Cooper A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10071-10078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Carlson T.L. Kottke B.A. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 18Kawabe Y. Shimokawa T.

In the current report we have examined whether SREBPs are involved in CDCA-induced gene expression. Furthermore, based on sequence similarity between the 5′-flanking region of the human LDL receptor gene and a consensus sequence for FXR, an inverted repeat separated by 1 base pair (IR-1), we postulated that FXR might directly regulate transcription of the LDL receptor gene. To test this hypothesis, we have performed luciferase assays using a reporter gene containing the LDL receptor promoter in the presence of enforced-expressed FXR and CDCA and further investigated the effect of a potent, nonsteroidal FXR ligand. We demonstrate here that CDCA activates the MAP kinase cascade, but not FXR, thereby affecting the rapid degradation of LDL receptor mRNA. CDCA, LY294002, wortmannin, actinomycin D, 25-hydroxycholesterol, and lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) were purchased from Sigma. DCA, LCA, and UDCA were from Wako (Osaka, Japan). PD98059 and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were from Calbiochemand U0126 was from Promega. Hep G2, HeLa, and HEK293 cells were maintained in medium A (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C under 5% CO2 atmosphere. Caco-2 cells were maintained in medium A supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% non-essential amino acids at 37 °C under 5% CO2atmosphere. The cells cultured for 10 days after total confluency were considered as differentiated. Expression plasmids for human FXR and human 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor α (RXRα) were described previously (6Grober J. Zaghini I. Fujii H. Jones S.A. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. Ono T. Besnard P. J.

To generate pI-BABP, aBglII-HindIII PCR fragment coding the 5′-promoter region (−862/+30) of the human intestinal bile acid-binding protein (I-BABP) was inserted into a pGL3 basic vector. Total RNA was isolated using an RNA preparation kit (Isogen; Nippon Gene Corp.). The RNA was fractionated by electrophoresis in a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond-N; Amersham Biosciences). Probes for human LDL receptor, SHP, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, and 36B4 (19Inoue J. Kumagai H. Terada T. Maeda M. Shimizu M. Sato R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) using a random-primed DNA labeling kit (Megaprime DNA labeling system;Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was hybridized with radioactive cDNA probes, and the signals on the membrane were quantified using an image-analyzing system (FLA-3000; Fuji Film Inc.). The polyclonal antibody (RS004) against human SREBP-2 (1–481) has been described previously (20Sato R. Miyamoto W. Inoue J. Terada T. Imanaka T. Maeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24714-24720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The polyclonal antibody against rat extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK, p42/44 MAP kinase) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The polyclonal anti-active ERK antibody was from Promega. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies against rabbit immunoglobulins were from Amersham Biosciences. Hep G2 cells were harvested after 6 h of incubation with CDCA (250 μm) or after 48 h of incubation in the medium containing 5% LPDS supplemented with a 50 μm concentration of a hydroxymethylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitor (pravastatin) plus 50 μm sodium mevalonate. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (21Hirano Y. Yoshida M. Shimizu M. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36431-36437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Proteins were fractionated by SDS/10% PAGE. Western blot analysis was carried out using anti-human SREBP-2 antibodies with chemiluminescent substrate (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Hep G2 cells were cultured with either CDCA (250 μm) or PMA (100 nm) for 4 h. U0126 was added 30 min prior to either CDCA or PMA. The cells were lysed in 50 mm Hepes pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate. Total cellular proteins were fractionated by SDS/10% PAGE. Western blot analysis was carried out using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against either ERK or the dually phosphorylated active form of ERK with chemiluminescent substrate. HEK293 cells (35-mm dishes) were transfected by the calcium phosphate method with 0.2 μg of a reporter plasmid, 0.01 μg of pRL-SV40 (Promega), and expression plasmids (0.1 μg each) for human FXR and human RXRα (6Grober J. Zaghini I. Fujii H. Jones S.A. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. Ono T. Besnard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29749-29754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours later both firefly and renilla luciferase activities were quantified using a dual luciferase reporter system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions (21Hirano Y. Yoshida M. Shimizu M. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36431-36437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Several investigators have reported that CDCA induces the LDL receptor expression in Hep G2 cells (16Taniguchi T. Chen J. Cooper A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10071-10078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Carlson T.L. Kottke B.A. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 18Kawabe Y. Shimokawa T. Matsumoto A. Honda M. Wada Y. Yazaki Y. Endo A. Itakura H. Kodama T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To test whether this induction is observed in nonhepatic cells, Caco-2 cells, which share the morphological and functional properties of the ileal enterocytes, together with HeLa cells were cultured with 250 μm CDCA for 24 h, and total RNA was extracted. Because we observed that I-BABP gene expression was induced more by CDCA in differentiated Caco-2 cells than in undifferentiated Caco-2 cells (data not shown), RNA from both undifferentiated and differentiated Caco-2 cells was also prepared to study the difference in the CDCA-mediated induction related to stage of differentiation. Northern blot analyses using an LDL receptor and a control 36B4 probe were carried out (Fig.1). In all cells the LDL receptor mRNA levels were up-regulated ∼2-fold by CDCA, indicating that induction is not restricted to Hep G2 cells. In Caco-2 cells the stage of differentiation, with which expression of various genes dramatically changes, did not affect CDCA-mediated induction. Although the effect of CDCA was observed in all cells tested, we used Hep G2 cells in the following experiments to elucidate the mechanism of CDCA-induced expression of the LDL receptor gene in the liver, the primary organ for cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis. The results in Fig. 1 led us to speculate that SREBPs, which mainly regulate LDL receptor gene expression in response to the intracellular cholesterol level, might be activated by CDCA. To test this possibility, Hep G2 cells were cultured with a medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 0.3 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol (a potent oxysterol included to reduce the amount of nuclear SREBPs), either in the absence or presence of CDCA. As a control, Hep G2 cells were cultured with a medium containing an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor to induce the amounts of nuclear SREBPs as well as the LDL receptor mRNA level. Nuclear extracts were prepared and Western blot analyses were performed using an anti-human SREBP-2 antibody (Fig. 2 A). The amount of nuclear SREBP-2 was reduced by the addition of 25-hydroxycholesterol (lane 1) but was unaltered by treatment with CDCA (lane 2), whereas depletion of cellular cholesterol brought about a marked increase in the nuclear SREBP-2 (lane 3). Fig. 2 B shows that CDCA augmented the LDL receptor mRNA level even in the presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol (lane 2). These results clearly indicate that nuclear SREBP-2 alone cannot account for the CDCA-induced expression of the LDL receptor gene. It should be noted that the effect of CDCA overcomes the suppressive effect of 25-hydroxycholesterol on LDL receptor gene expression. We next investigated whether other bile acid molecules also affect gene expression in Hep G2 cells. In the following experiments the cells were cultured with 25-hydroxycholesterol to suppress LDL receptor mRNA, bringing about a situation in which the induction by bile acids would be clear. Because a dose of more than 100 μm CDCA under these conditions significantly and dose dependently induces LDL receptor mRNA (data not shown), a 250 μm concentration of bile acids was utilized in the current experiments. As shown in Fig. 3, CDCA, DCA, and LCA, but not UDCA, significantly induced the LDL receptor mRNA level, and a similar pattern was observed on regulation of SHP gene expression, which is one of the FXR-responsive genes in the liver. The only minor difference between the two patterns is that LCA, which has been reported to be a weak activator of FXR, only slightly induced the SHP mRNA level, whereas LDL receptor gene expression was significantly enhanced. The above data suggest that the LDL receptor gene might be one of the FXR-responsive genes. To evaluate the involvement of FXR in the up-regulation, we performed luciferase assays using reporter genes containing either the promoter region of the human LDL receptor or the human I-BABP gene, which is one of the FXR-responsive genes. The cells were cultured with 100 μm CDCA for 2 days because the concentration of 250 μm caused severe toxicity in the cells subjected to DNA transfection. When HEK293 cells were transfected with expression plasmids for both FXR and RXR, CDCA significantly induced luciferase activities driven by the I-BABP promoter (Fig. 4 A). On the other hand, the LDL receptor gene expression, which was significantly induced by cholesterol depletion (Fig. 4 A, lower panel), was only slightly stimulated by CDCA in the presence or absence of FXR/RXR (Fig. 4 A, upper panel). To further confirm the dissociation of FXR from the CDCA-induced regulation, Hep G2 cells were cultured with either CDCA or GW4064, a synthetic FXR ligand (7Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Price R.R. Watson M.A. McKee D.D. Moore L.B. Galardi C. Willson J.G. Lewis M.C. Roth M.E. Maloney P.R. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 517-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar), for 6 h, and induction of the LDL receptor and SHP mRNA was analyzed. As shown in Fig.4 B, the agonist did not mimic the stimulating effect of CDCA on LDL receptor gene expression, whereas both ligands significantly enhanced SHP gene expression. These results strongly support the notion that CDCA induces LDL receptor gene expression by a mechanism distinct from that of the FXR-mediated transcriptional up-regulation. Accumulating evidence suggests that bile acids modulate signal transduction pathways including the protein kinase A-, protein kinase C-, MAP kinase-, c-Jun N-terminal kinase- and PI3K-dependent cascades (22Bouscarel B. Kroll S.D. Fromm H. Gastroenterology. 1999; 117: 433-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 23Gupta S. Stravitz R.T. Dent P. Hylemon P.B. J. Biol.

J. 1996; 316: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To determine which of these pathways is associated with the regulation of the gene expression in these experiments, the effects of various inhibitors on the CDCA-induced expression were investigated. Treatment of cells with one of the PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin or LY294002, had no effect on the CDCA-mediated up-regulation of LDL receptor gene expression (Fig. 5 A). On the contrary, Fig. 5 B shows that the MAP kinase/ERK kinase (MEK) 1/2 inhibitors U0126 and PD98059 led to significant reduction of the LDL receptor mRNA levels induced by CDCA. These results indicate that the MEK/ERK pathway mainly regulates the gene expression of the LDL receptor. To confirm activation of ERK 1/2 by CDCA, we subjected cell extracts from CDCA-treated cells to Western blot analysis with an antibody that specifically recognizes the activated, phosphorylated forms of ERK 1/2 (Fig. 6). Hep G2 cells were also treated with PMA to activate the MEK/ERK pathway (26Kumar A. Chambers T.C. Cloud-Heflin B.A. Mehta K.D. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2240-2248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amounts of phosphorylated ERK 1/2 were very low in control cells but increased markedly in CDCA- and PMA-treated cells (lanes 1,3, and 5). Treatment of these cells with U0126 significantly inhibited both CDCA- and PMA-mediated activation of ERK (lanes 4 and 6). U0126 did not affect ERK protein expression, as indicated by Western blotting of the same cell extracts with an anti-ERK 1/2 antibody. Thus, CDCA activates ERK 1/2 via MEK activation, which can be inhibited by U0126. The same results were obtained in PD98059-treated cells (data not shown). We next examined whether CDCA stabilizes LDL receptor mRNA, thereby inducing the mRNA levels. Hep G2 cells were pretreated with actinomycin D for 30 min and then further treated with or without CDCA for the indicated period. As shown in Fig.7, the turnover rate of LDL receptor mRNA was prolonged 2-fold (t 12 = 3versus 6 h) by CDCA. The turnover of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein mRNA, which is involved in lipoprotein synthesis, was not affected by CDCA. We further determined whether CDCA-mediated stabilization of LDL receptor mRNA depended on activation of the MAP kinase pathway. Hep G2 cells were incubated with either CDCA or PMA in the presence or absence of a MEK inhibitor, and mRNA decay for 4 h was examined (Fig. 8, A andB). Treatment of cells with PMA as well as CDCA stabilized LDL receptor mRNA. The MEK inhibitors, U0126 and PD98059, blocked CDCA- or PMA-mediated stabilization of LDL receptor mRNA. These results suggest that the MEK/ERK pathway is associated with stabilization and that this effect can account for the CDCA-induced expression of LDL receptor gene. In the current report we provide the first evidence that bile acids, the final products of the cholesterol-bile acid biosynthetic pathway in the liver, directly regulate the LDL receptor gene expression by a novel mechanism. It is well established that bile acids undergoing enterohepatic circulation feedback repress their own biosynthesis. The activity of the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway, CYP7a1, is repressed at the level of gene transcription, which effect is exerted by the bile acid-activated FXR. Based on sequence similarity between the human LDL receptor promoter −338 to −350 (5′-AGGACAaTGGCAT-3′) and IR-1 (5′-AGGTCAaTGACCT-3′), a consensus sequence for FXR, we initially hypothesized that the gene is directly regulated by FXR. However, we here have reported that bile acids stabilize and increase LDL receptor mRNA through activation of the MAP kinase cascade. Therefore, it is evident that bile acids dynamically control the hepatic cholesterol levels through two distinct pathways and mechanisms, the repression of conversion from cholesterol to bile acids and also the induction of the LDL receptor. It has been reported that transient activation of the MAP kinase cascade by PMA or cytokines up-regulates LDL receptor transcription in an SREBP-independent manner (26Kumar A. Chambers T.C. Cloud-Heflin B.A. Mehta K.D. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2240-2248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Kumar A. Middleton A. Chambers T.C. Mehta K.D. J. Biol.

Gel shift assays using nuclear extracts prepared from untreated and the cytokine oncostatin M-treated Hep G2 cells revealed that an as yet unidentified complex, which appears with the administration of oncostatin M and disappears with U0126, is bound to the sterol-independent regulatory element in the LDL receptor promoter region −17 to −1 (30Liu J. Ahlborn T.E. Briggs M.R. Kraemer F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5214-5221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that MAP kinases phosphorylate both SREBPs and Sp1, which coordinately regulate LDL receptor gene expression, and augment their transcriptional activities (31Kotzka J.

Pages G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20631-20639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). We found that CDCA as well as PMA indeed activates the MAP kinase cascade (Fig. 6). Therefore, it is likely that the CDCA-dependent increase in LDL receptor mRNA observed in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 is in part because of a transcriptional up-regulation. In addition, the slight decrease of LDL receptor mRNA by treatment of the MAP kinase inhibitor alone (Fig. 5 B) suggests that MAP kinase activity might be involved in the basal transcription of LDL receptor gene. The current results and previous findings taken together strongly support the notion that CDCA activates the MAP kinase cascade, thereby stimulating the LDL receptor gene expression at the transcriptional as well as the posttranscriptional level. The mechanism by which CDCA stabilizes the LDL receptor mRNA remains unresolved. It has been reported that the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of human LDL receptor mRNA contains three AU-rich elements (AREs) based on sequence homology with the nonameric sequence UUAUUUAUU and that the sequence is sufficient to confer a brief constitutive mRNA half-life (34Wilson G.M. Vasa M.Z. Deeley R.G. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1025-1032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the human LDL receptor expression was found to be up-regulated by enhanced stability of the mRNA in mice engineered to express human LDL receptor, lacking the 3′-UTR sequence, instead of the mouse LDL receptor (35Knouff C. Malloy S. Wilder J. Altenburg M.K. Maeda N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3856-3862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Furthermore, three alu-like repetitive elements in the distal 3′-UTR have been shown to confer stability to the mRNA in the presence of PMA (34Wilson G.M. Vasa M.Z. Deeley R.G. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1025-1032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is also reported that cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA is stabilized by a MEK-dependent mechanism (36Xu K. Robida A.M. Murphy T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23012-23019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although it remains unclear whether the PMA-induced stabilization is directly associated with the MEK/ERK activation, these observations support the general notion that the MAP kinase cascades are involved in stabilization of certain mRNA. A recent study demonstrated that the mammalian exosome interacts with the ARE-binding protein, thereby promoting the rapid degradation of ARE-containing RNA (37Chen C-Y. Gherzi R. Ong S-E. Chan E.L. Raijmakers R. Pruijn G.J.M. Stoecklin G. Moroni C. Mann M. Karin M. Cell. 2001; 107: 451-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, possible that the alu-like repetitive elements do play an important role in the ARE-containing RNA degradation by the exosome in the presence of either PMA or CDCA. Whether in fact this is the case, and if so, the mechanism by which the 3′-UTR sequence of LDL receptor mRNA is involved in the CDCA-induced stability are under active investigation. We observed that UDCA from among the bile acids tested in the current experiments had the least effect on the LDL receptor and SHP gene expression (Fig. 3). It seems likely that the structural difference between CDCA and UDCA, specifically the 7β−hydroxy epimer of CDCA, is critical for the activation of the MAP kinases as well as for the recognition of the ligand for FXR (38Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J., Tu, H. Learned R.M. Luk A. Hull M.V. Lustig K.D. Mangelsdorf D.J. Shan B. Science. 1999; 284: 1362-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (2182) Google Scholar, 39Parks D.J.

Science. 1999; 284: 1365-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar). It is also noted that LCA, a weak activator of FXR, is a quite potent inducer of LDL receptor gene expression. Indeed, LCA was found to be more potent than cholic acid, and UDCA had no effect on the activation of MAP kinases (25Brady L.M. Beno D.W.A. Davis B.H. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because the non-ionic non-cytolytic membrane detergent octyl β-d-glucopyranoside had no effect on MAP kinase activation (40Marriott S.J. Griffith G.R. Consigli R.A. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 375-382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these bile acids appear to induce the activities of MAP kinases in a specific manner, not by their detergent-like effects. The observation that the CDCA-mediated elevation of LDL receptor mRNA even in the presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol was comparable with induction in response to cholesterol depletion (Fig.2 B) suggests that stabilization of LDL receptor mRNA may be a critical target for the modulation of human lipid metabolism. Ultimately, it may be possible to identify desirable compounds that have selective activity on stabilization of mRNA for the LDL receptor, thereby reducing the risk for atherosclerosis.

The effects of estrogens are mediated by their intracellular receptors. To date, two estrogen receptors (members of the nuclear hormone receptors superfamily) have been described: estrogen receptor α (NR3A1) (7Green S. Walter P. Kumar V. Krust A. Bornert J.M. Argos P. Chambon P. Nature. 1986; 320: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1938) Google Scholar) and estrogen receptor β (NR3A2, Nuclear Receptors Nomenclature Committee, 1999; Refs. 8Nuclear Receptors Nomenclature Committee Cell. 1999; 97: 161-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar and 9Kuiper G.G.

The estrogen receptor α (ERα)1 gene is transcribed from multiple promoters that give rise to mRNA variants with distinct 5′-untranslated regions (Ref. 10Kos M. Reid G. Denger S. Gannon F. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 2057-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar and references therein). In total, seven (A, B, C, D, E, F, and T) and six (A, B, C, E, F, and H) promoters are known for human and mouse ERα gene, respectively, and presumably these lists are not exhaustive. These promoters are utilized in a tissue-specific manner resulting in different levels of expression of mRNA variants in individual tissues (11Grandien K. Backdahl M. Ljunggren O. Gustafsson J.A. Berkenstam A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2223-2229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Denger S. Reid G. Kos M. Flouriot G. Parsch D. Brand H. Korach K.S. Sonntag-Buck V. Gannon F. Mol.

The different expression of human A, B, and C variants in normal and in cancerous breast tissue and tumor-derived cell lines has also been observed (11Grandien K. Backdahl M. Ljunggren O. Gustafsson J.A. Berkenstam A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2223-2229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,17Weigel R.J. Crooks D.L. Iglehart J.D. deConinck E.C. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 707-711PubMed Google Scholar). The alternative utilization of multiple promoters might serve to fine tune ERα levels within the cell. This could occur at the level of transcript production, transcript stability, or, as each variant has a different 5′-UTR, efficiency of translation of the transcript. It is known that in general the secondary structure and/or the presence of AUGs and associated open reading frames (ORFs) in the 5′-UTRs can regulate the translation of the main ORF (for review, see Refs.18Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar, 19van der Velden A.W. Thomas A.A. Int. J. Biochem.

There are two examples of such regulation in the nuclear hormone receptor family. Several short upstream ORFs (uORFs) in the mouse retinoic acid receptor β2 mRNA act to regulate the tissue-specific expression of the receptor at the translational level (21Zimmer A. Zimmer A.M. Reynolds K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 22Reynolds K. Zimmer A.M. Zimmer A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Recently the importance of a uORF for expression of the glucocorticoid receptor has also been reported (23Diba F. Watson C.S. Gametchu B. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The ERα genomic unit might be a good candidate for such regulation as it has a plethora of mRNAs with different 5′-UTRs that contain between one and six uORFs. In this study the effect of upstream AUGs (uAUGs) on the translation of major ERα mRNA variants in human and mouse was analyzed in transient transfection assays and by in vitrotoeprinting. The 5′-UTRs of the human ERα C, E, and F mRNAs showed a moderate negative effect on the translation of a reporter gene. However, human ERα T and mouse ERα C and F 5′-UTRs significantly suppressed the translation of a reporter gene. Mutation of the uAUGs partially or completely restored the translation efficiency of these mRNAs. The extent to which different uAUGs influence the translation of the downstream ORF with regard to their homology to a consensus Kozak sequence (24Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4148) Google Scholar) and the location of the associated uORFs relative to the main ORF translation start site was analyzed for the human T and mouse F variants. Toeprinting analysis revealed that leaky scanning occurs with mRNAs bearing these 5′-UTRs and excluded the internal ribosomal entry site-mediated translation as a major mechanism for translation of these mRNAs. This study shows that 5′-UTRs might play an important role in the regulation of ERα expression in some target tissues. GenBankTMaccession numbers of sequences used in this study are listed below. Note that the mouse F 5′-UTRs result from splicing of the exon F1 to the exon F2, respectively (10Kos M. Reid G. Denger S. Gannon F. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 2057-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The human sequences used were: cDNA, NM_000125; A, NM_000125; C, X62462; E, X86816/AJ002561; F, U68068/AJ002562; T, AJ421639. The mouse sequences used were: cDNA, M38651; C, M38651; F1, AJ272164; F2, AJ272165. The coding sequence of firefly luciferase was amplified from pGL3 basic plasmid (Promega) using the following primers: sense, 5′-GCGGGATCCATGACCATGGAAGACGCCAAAAACATAAAGAAAGGC-3′; antisense 5′-ATAGGGCCCTTACAATTTGGACTTTCCGCCCTTCTTGGCC-3′. The sense primer introduced a BamHI site and initiator ATG sequence of ERα (underlined) that when joined to luciferase forms aBstXI restriction site. The antisense primer contained anApaI site at its 5′-end. The amplified product was directionally cloned into the BamHI and ApaI sites downstream of the CMV promoter in pcDNA3.1-Hygro(+) vector (Invitrogen). The obtained construct, pcDNA3.1-Luc, was used as a parental vector for subcloning various 5′-UTRs of ERα. The 5′-UTRs of human and mouse ERα were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from human endometrium, liver, or testis and mouse liver RNA using a common antisense primer for human (5′-GGCGTCTTCCATGGTCATGGTAAGTGGCAGCCGGCG-3′) and mouse (5′-GGCGTCTTCCATGGTCATGGTAAGTGGCAGCCGGCG-3′) that introduced the beginning of the luciferase coding sequence behind the initiator ATG of ERα and formed the BstXI as described above. The 5′-UTRs of transcribed mRNAs contained 59 bp of vector sequence at their 5′-end followed by ERα 5′-UTRs fused to luciferase coding sequence. The sense primers, containing an NheI site at their 5′-end, were as follows: human A, 5′-CGCGCTAGCAGGAGCTGGCGGAGGGCG-3′; human C, 5′-CGCGCTAGCTTCACACACTGAGCCACTCGC-3′; human E, 5′-CGCGCTAGCAGTCAGAGAAATAATCGCAGAGCCTC-3′; human F, 5′-CGCGCTAGCACCAAAACTGAAAATGCAGGCTCCATGC-3′; human T, 5′-CGCGCTAGCCTCTTGCCTGCCGCCATGTAAGAAGC-3′; mouse C, 5′-CGCGCTAGCATCACACACCGCGCCACTCGATCATTCG-3′; and mouse F, 5′-CGCGCTAGCGAAAACACAAGGCTCCATGCTCAGC-3′. The resulting PCR products were cloned into the NheI and BstXI sites of pcDNA3.1-Luc. The human ERα expression vector plasmid HEO (pSG5-ERα) was kindly provided by P. Chambon (25Green S. Issemann I. Sheer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 369Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). The mouse ERα-expressing vector was constructed by subcloning the ERα coding sequence from pMT2-MOR (kindly provided by M. G. Parker) into the EcoRI site of the pSG5 vector (25Green S. Issemann I. Sheer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 369Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). The pSG5-Renilla vector was kindly provided by M. Hentze and contains the Renilla luciferase coding sequence cloned between the SmaI and BamHI sites of pSG5. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the procedure in the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All the constructs were sequenced. MDA-231, 293, MCF-7, HepG-2, HeLa, and NIH-3T3 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), penicillin (100 units/ml, Invitrogen), streptomycin (100 μg/ml, Invitrogen), and glutamine (2 mm, Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The cells were split into 24-well plates (for luciferase assays) or 6-cm dishes (for RNA isolation) such that they were 50–80% confluent on the day of transfection. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) for NIH-3T3 cells or FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for other cell lines following the recommendations of the manufacturer. One hundred nanograms of pcDNA3.1-Luc vector containing various 5′-UTRs and 100 ng of pSG5-Renilla vector were used in each transfection. The reaction volumes were scaled up 5-fold for 6-cm dishes. In experiments evaluating the effect of ERα on translation efficiency 100 ng of pSG5-ERα vector was used. Twenty hours after transfection cells were lysed for 1 h with Passive lysis buffer (Promega), and Dual-Luciferase assays (Promega) were performed following the recommendations of the manufacturer. Ten microliters of cell lysate were transferred into a 96-well plate, and the light emission was measured for 10 s with 2-s delay after the injection of 50 μl of luciferase assay reagent or Stop&Glow reagent on a EG&G Berthold Microplate Luminometer LB 96V. All experiments were performed at least three times in triplicate. RNA from cells transfected in the 6-cm dishes was isolated using the High Pure RNA Isolation kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's procedure. After elution from the columns the RNA was precipitated and redissolved to 1 mg/ml. RNase protection assays were then performed as described previously (26Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 7.71-7.78Google Scholar). The RNase protection probes for firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase were prepared as follows. A 133-bp fragment of firefly luciferase gene was amplified from pGL3 basic vector (Promega) using the following sense (5′-CGCGGATCCGGCGCCATTCTATCCTCTAG-3′) and antisense (5′-GCCGAATTCCCGCGTACGTGATGTTCACC-3′) primers, which introducedBamHI and EcoRI sites at the 5′- and 3′-end of the amplified product, respectively. The PCR fragment was subsequently subcloned into pBlueScript II (SK−) (Stratagene). Similarly, sense (5′-ACGGGATCCGGCCATGATTGGGGTGCTTG-3′) and antisense (5′-ATGGAATTCGGCCATTCATCCCATGATTCAATC-3′) primers were used to amplify a 120-bp fragment of Renilla luciferase from pRL-CMV plasmid (Promega) that was subcloned into BamHI and EcoRI sites of pBlueScript II (SK−). Both constructs were linearized byBamHI and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions in the presence of [α-32P]dUTP (10 mCi/ml, 400 Ci/mmol,Amersham Biosciences) using a ratio of hot to cold dUTP of 1:2.6. Dried gels were exposed to BAS-MS phosphorimaging plates (Fuji) and scanned on a Fuji FLA-2000 reader. The obtained signals were quantified using Aida version 2.0 quantification software. The toeprinting analysis was performed as described previously (27Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4853-4859Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, the constructs containing various human and mouse ERα 5′-UTRs upstream of the firefly luciferase coding sequence (pcDNA3.1-Luc constructs) were linearized by digestion with SfuI and transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions using 0.5 μg of linearized template in the presence of 1 mm rATP, rCTP, and rUTP, 0.05 mm rGTP, and 1 mm CAP analog (New England Biolabs). After a 10-min incubation at 37 °C rGTP was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the reaction was incubated further for 1 h. Transcribed RNA was extracted once with phenol/chloroform, purified twice through Mini Quick Spin RNA columns (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), precipitated by ammonium acetate, and dissolved in water in a final concentration of 50 ng/μl. One hundred nanograms of RNA were annealed with 20 pmol of primer (5′-TTCACCTCGATATGTGCATCTGTAA-3′) in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5 by heating to 65 °C for 2 min followed by a 5-min incubation at 37 °C. The annealed RNA/primer was added to the in vitrotranslation reaction containing 33 μl of Flexi rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega), 1 mm amino acids, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 70 mm KCl, 40 units of RNasin (Promega), and 3 mm cycloheximide or ethanol as vehicle. No MgCl2 was added, and the internal concentration of Mg2+ in the lysate was between 1.8 and 1.9 mm. The reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 15 min and then placed on ice. A 4-μl aliquot was analyzed by primer extension in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 40 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.625 mm dNTPs, 20 units of RNasin, 2.5 mm cycloheximide, and 100 units of Superscript (Invitrogen). The reactions were incubated for 45 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by extraction with 20 μl of phenol/chloroform, and 5 μl of the upper phase were separated on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (7 m urea). For sequencing reactions, the plasmids were annealed with the same primer and sequenced using the T7 Sequenase kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In the following text, ERα mRNA variants are designated by their capital letter, and the uAUGs and uORFs are designated by their distal position from the 5′-end of the mRNA. The 5′-UTRs of major human and mouse ERα mRNA variants used in this study are illustrated in Fig. 1. The lengths of the 5′-UTR variants are between 189 (human C) and 327 nucleotides (human F). Sequence analysis revealed the presence of AUGs and associated ORFs upstream of the main ORF translation start site in all variants. The numbers of uAUGs are: one in human A and E and mouse C, two in human C, four in human F, five in mouse F, and six in human T. The mouse F uAUG-4 has the most favorable Kozak context for translation initiation ((A/G)CCAUGG, Ref. 24Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4148) Google Scholar) having an A at position −3 and G at position +4. The other uAUGs are in a similar or a less favorable translation initiation context compared with the two initiation AUGs of the main ORF. The length of the associated uORFs varies from a single codon (human E, F4, and T1) to 111 codons (human T4). The human C2, T4, T5, and T6 uORFs extend beyond the initiation AUG into the ERα ORF. The human A 5′-UTR (the most GC-rich 5′-UTR, 72% GC) has the most stable secondary structure, as predicted by Mfold version 3.1 2Mfold server: bioinfo.math.rpi.edu. (28Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 911-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (3187) Google Scholar), with a Gibbs free energy ΔG = −114.98 kcal/mol and the most stable individual hairpin with a ΔG of only −17.7 kcal/mol. The most stable hairpin was identified in the human F 5′-UTR with ΔG = −20.6 kcal/mol. Secondary structures with free energy higher than ΔG = −30 kcal/mol are not considered to impair translation (29Kozak M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2850-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 30Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5134-5142Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 31Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Svitkin Y.V. Pause A. Haghighat A. Pyronnet S. Witherell G. Belsham G.J. Sonenberg N. RNA. 2001; 7: 382-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Therefore it is likely that none of the 5′-UTRs substantially inhibits translation of the downstream ORF due to their secondary structure. To evaluate the effect of various 5′-UTRs on translation of the main ORF, the constructs containing different 5′-UTRs placed upstream of a luciferase reporter gene were transiently co-transfected with a Renilla luciferase-expressing plasmid into ERα-negative human breast carcinoma cell line MDA-231MB (human 5′-UTRs) or mouse fibroblast cell line NIH-3T3 (mouse 5′-UTRs) (Fig.2). The parental vector has a 90-bp 5′-UTR devoid of any uAUGs and thus served as a control for translation efficiency. The firefly luciferase values were corrected for transfection efficiency using the Renilla luciferase activity and also with mRNA expression in transfected cells (RNase protection assays). The human A 5′-UTR increased the translation of luciferase ∼1.3-fold compared with the parental vector. The human C, E, and F 5′-UTRs had a rather moderate negative effect on translation efficiency. However, the human T and mouse C and F efficiently reduced the translation of the luciferase to 3, 40, or 20% of the wild type, respectively. Mutation of all upstream AUGs to UUGs restored or even enhanced the translation efficiency of all human 5′-UTRs but not those of mouse. The removal of all uAUGs had an especially pronounced effect on the human T where it increased the translation by more than 60-fold. Similar results were obtained using other cell lines such as HeLa, MCF-7, HepG2, and 293 (data not shown). Co-transfection with an ERα-expressing vector or transfection into the ERα-positive cell line MCF-7 was performed to determine whether ERα itself has an effect on translation of different mRNA variants. However, no change in translation efficiency has been observed either in the presence or in the absence of estradiol (data not shown). These results show that upstream AUG triplets in 5′-UTRs of the multiple mRNA of ERα variants can regulate the expression on the level of translation. The mouse F and human T 5′-UTRs, which reduced the translation from the downstream luciferase ORF most efficiently, contain six and five uAUGs, respectively. The contributions of individual uAUGs to the repression of translation were evaluated using constructs with single uAUGs or their combinations changed into UUG triplets (Fig.3). Interestingly, the mutation of the mouse F uAUG-1, -2, -3, or -5 did not have a significant effect on the translation. It was only the mutation of the uAUG-4 that was responsible for most of the 2.5-fold increase in translation efficiency of the construct lacking all uAUGs. Likewise, mutation of human T uAUG-1, -2, -3, -4, or -5 did not increase the translatability of the 5′-UTR significantly. However, the mutation of uAUG-6 improved the translation efficiency 6-fold. The combined mutation of uAUG-5 and -6 increased the translation ∼30-fold and thus restored the efficiency of translation of this construct to the level of the parental vector control. The additional elimination of the uAUG-4, which is in the frame with the uAUG-5, did not further improve the efficiency of translation. Nevertheless, the construct lacking all uAUGs augmented the translation an additional 2-fold above the level of the control. To determine the initiation AUG codons in mRNAs containing various 5′-UTRs of human and mouse ERα the ribosome toeprinting analysis was performed (Fig.4). Multiple toeprints matching one to four uAUGs were observed in all cases indicating that these mRNAs are translated by leaky scanning. A fraction of ribosomes passed the first AUGs, presumably due to a weak Kozak context, and initiated on the subsequent AUG codons. In the case of human A and E weak toeprints corresponding to the main ORF AUGs were also observed. Several toeprints that were induced by addition of cycloheximide but that do not correspond to any AUG (or GUG) were also observed (indicated by white asterisks in Fig. 4). Their origin is unclear. The human T was further analyzed by stepwise mutation of the uAUG codons into UUG codons starting at the 5′-end of the 5′-UTR and adding the downstream uAUGs (Fig. 5). Such additive removal of initiating codons caused ribosomes to initiate at downstream uAUGs and resulted in a corresponding “shift” of the toeprints further from the 5′-end of the mRNA. It is worth noticing that the toeprints matching the main ORF AUGs were observed only after the removal of all uAUGs. The varying strength of the toeprints might represent the potential of the particular AUG to serve as an initiating codon. This mutational analysis also confirmed the specificity of the observed toeprints. A toeprint not corresponding to any AUG was observed in mutants in which more than the first three uAUGs were removed (open arrow in Fig. 5). This might be caused by a stabilization of the secondary structure that is normally disrupted by the presence of the ribosome stalled at the first three uAUGs. The ERα mRNAs are transcribed from multiple promoters that are distributed over more than 150 kilobase pairs of genomic region (10Kos M. Reid G. Denger S. Gannon F. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 2057-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). We have shown that the expression of the ERα in human and mouse is regulated by 5′-UTRs on the level of translation. Whereas the human A, C, E, and F 5′-UTRs do not substantially inhibit translation of downstream ORF, the mouse C and F and especially the human T 5′-UTRs exhibit inhibitory effects to various extents (13Flouriot G. Griffin C. Kenealy M.-R. Sonntag-Buck V. Gannon F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1939-1954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Donaghue C. Westley B.R. May F.E. Mol.

This finding contributes to a more complete understanding of the mechanisms by which the desired levels of the ERα protein are achieved in target cells given the observed tissue-specific expression of ERα mRNA variants (11Grandien K. Backdahl M. Ljunggren O. Gustafsson J.A. Berkenstam A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2223-2229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the major mRNA variants expressed in human mammary gland and endometrium (well known estrogen target tissues) are A and C (13Flouriot G. Griffin C. Kenealy M.-R. Sonntag-Buck V. Gannon F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1939-1954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results presented here show that human C 5′-UTR has very little inhibitory effect, while human A even augments the translation of the main ORF. Thus A and C ERα promoters might be specifically utilized in these tissues in order to provide relatively high levels of ERα protein. On the contrary, the human T 5′-UTR, which is specifically expressed at low levels in testis (33Brand H. Kos M. Denger S. Flouriot G. Gromoll J. Gannon F. Reid G. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3397-3404Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), suppresses translation very efficiently. It is known that estrogen receptors are important for proper testis development and for normal spermatogenesis as exposure to excessive levels of estrogens or phytoestrogens during fetal and neonatal development leads to male reproductive disturbances (see Ref. 34O'Donnell L. Robertson K.M. Jones M.E. Simpson E.R. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 289-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar and references therein). Tight regulation of low ERα expression in testis is likely to be necessary. The weak translational efficiency of the human T mRNA might ensure that low levels of ERα are expressed in the target cell. Nevertheless, the possibility of cell-specific regulation of translation efficiency needs to be considered (e.g. a uORF in the retinoic acid receptor β2 mRNA represses its translation in heart and brain but not in other tissues; Refs. 21Zimmer A. Zimmer A.M. Reynolds K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar and 22Reynolds K. Zimmer A.M. Zimmer A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The extent to which 5′-UTRs influence the translation might also vary during certain stages of development or may depend on external signals. The experiments performed here in a small range of different cell types might not be adequate to detect such variations. It has also been reported in the literature that peptides encoded by short uORFs can regulate expression of the retinoic acid receptor β2 (see above) or the glucocorticoid receptor (22Reynolds K. Zimmer A.M. Zimmer A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 23Diba F. Watson C.S. Gametchu B. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, none of the ERα uORFs is homologous to any of these peptides. Furthermore, although the number and position of most uORFs in different 5′-UTRs is relatively well conserved between mouse and human, most of these share no homology. Only human C2 and mouse C are partially homologous; however, mouse C is significantly shorter (36 and 18 amino acids, respectively). Therefore, it seems unlikely that peptides encoded by uORFs in various ERα 5′-UTRs would influence the expression of ERα. The toeprinting analysis showed that ribosomes initiate on multiple upstream AUGs, and therefore the mRNAs containing various 5′-UTRs of human or mouse ERα are translated by a leaky scanning mechanism. Furthermore, the data obtained with mouse F and human T 5′-UTRs support the scanning and reinitiation model of translation (35Kozak M. Cell. 1978; 15: 1109-1123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) of these mRNAs (36Peabody D.S. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2695-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In this model the 40 S ribosomal subunits attaches to the cap and scans along the mRNA until it reaches the first AUG codon where it initializes translation. If the first AUG is not recognized (e.g. due to weak Kozak context or secondary structure) the ribosome may pass this AUG and initiate at another AUG downstream, resulting in leaky scanning (for review, see Refs. 20Morris D.R. Geballe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8635-8642Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar and37Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 234: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). After translating the ORF, the ribosome can reinitiate at another downstream AUG, detach from the mRNA, or stall at the termination codon of the ORF. The efficiency of reinitiation on a downstream AUG depends also on the distance between the end of upstream ORF and the AUG (38Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3438-3445Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 39Grant C.M. Miller P.F. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2616-2628Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 40Luukkonen B.G. Tan W. Schwartz S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4086-4094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When this distance is short (less than 79 nucleotides; Ref. 38Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3438-3445Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) the ribosome is less likely to recruit the necessary initiation factors before it reaches the next AUG, and consequently it fails to initiate on the downstream AUG. This model accounts for the contribution of individual uAUGs of the human T 5′-UTR to inhibition of translation efficiency (Fig. 3). This 5′-UTR contains six uORFs (Fig.1). The first three uORFs end far upstream of the main ORF, and the scanning/reinitiation model would predict that they have only a moderate effect on translation efficiency. This is confirmed by mutation of individual uAUG-1, -2, or -3, which did not dramatically improve the translation of luciferase (∼1.5-fold). On the contrary, translation of uORF-4 or -5 (which are in-frame to each other) or uORF-6 would be predicted to strongly inhibit translation of the main ORF as they all terminate downstream of the main ORF initiator AUG. Moreover, the translation of the uORF-2 would affect initiation on uAUG-4 allowing the ribosome to pass and reach uAUG-5 or -6. The mutation of uAUG-4 or -5 would have a minimal effect in the presence of uAUG-6. The results confirm this prediction. The mutation of uAUG-6 improved translation of luciferase ∼6-fold, and combined mutation of uAUG-5 and -6 improved translation more than 30-fold. The additional mutation of uAUG-4 did not have any effect. The additional mutation of the first three uAUGs (i.e. construct lacking all uAUGs) further increased the translation only 2-fold, reaching a 60-fold increase compared with the wild type sequence. Similar to the human T 5′-UTR, the mouse F 5′-UTR contains a large number of uORFs. The uORF-1 and uORF-2 terminate far upstream of the main ORF. The uORF-3 translation would be expected to be inhibited by the uORF-1 and uORF-2. The uAUG-4 has a favorable Kozak context. Consequently, the uORF-4 would affect the translation of the main ORF the most efficiently. The mutation analysis again confirmed this prediction (Fig. 3). Moreover, the toeprinting analysis showed that the translation initiation indeed occurs at the first several uAUGs in all 5′-UTRs tested. Therefore, the ribosomes reinitiate downstream at either another uAUG or the AUG of the main ORF. If we use the same model as above, it might be expected that the human E and F 5′-UTRs should not inhibit the translation of luciferase significantly as their uAUGs are not in favorable Kozak context and all uORFs end more than 100 nucleotides upstream of the main ORF (Fig. 1). However, it was not anticipated that the human A 5′-UTR would not inhibit the translation to an extent similar to mouse C or F 5′-UTRs as the last uORFs of all three 5′-UTRs terminate in approximately the same distance from the main ORF (54, 56, and 56 nucleotides, respectively). A strong toeprint matching the A uAUG indicates that most ribosomes initiate on this codon. Whether the secondary structure in human A 5′-UTR (72% GC) augments the recognition of the main AUG or another mechanism such as internal ribosome entry is responsible for this effect is not clear. Finally, mutation of all uAUGs in human 5′-UTRs restored or even augmented the translation of luciferase, whereas the mutants of mouse C or F 5′-UTRs lacking all uAUGs restored the translation efficiency to only 75 or 50% of the parental vector, respectively. It is possible that a negative element present in mouse in the common part of the 5′-UTRs between the common acceptor splice site and main ORF, which is only 70% identical between mouse and human, can negatively influence the translation initiation from the main AUG. However, further research is needed to clarify this issue. In summary, we have shown in this study that multiple 5′-UTRs positively and negatively influence the expression of ERα in human and mouse. The findings that human A and C are translated with a high efficiency while human T strongly inhibits the translation of the downstream ORF are especially physiologically relevant. Most of the observed effects are caused by upstream ORFs. Furthermore, we have shown that mRNAs containing human or mouse ERα 5′-UTRs are translated by leaky scanning and reinitiation."

In addition, we demonstrated that high level cyclin E expression potentiates the development of methyl-nitroso-urea-induced T-cell lymphomas in mice. To further investigate the mechanism underlying cyclin E-mediated malignant transformation, we have performed a mutational analysis of cyclin E function. Here we show that cyclin E mutants defective to form an active kinase complex with Cdk2 are unable to drive cells from G1 into S phase but can still malignantly transform rat embryo fibroblasts in cooperation with Ha-Ras. In addition, Cdk2 activation is not a prerequisite for the ability of cyclin E to rescue yeast triple cln mutations. We also find that the oncogenic properties of cyclin E did not entirely correspond with its ability to interact with the negative cell cycle regulator p27Kip1 or the pocket protein p130. These findings suggest that the oncogenic activity of cyclin E does not exclusively rely on its ability as a positive regulator of G1 progression. Rather, we propose that cyclin E harbors other functions, independent of Cdk2 activation and p27Kip1 binding, that contribute significantly to its oncogenic activity.

One of the important events in this phase of the cell cycle is the phosphorylation of the tumor suppressor protein Rb, which is one of the substrates of E-type cyclin-Cdk complexes (12Weinberg R.A.

The Rb protein is active in its nonphosphorylated or hypophosphorylated form and becomes hyperphosphorylated and inactivated by cyclin-Cdk complexes during G1 phase (12Weinberg R.A.

This inactivation by phosphorylation leads to the release of E2F family transcription factors from a complex with the Rb protein. E2F transcription factors in turn activate a set of target genes that are essential for entry into S phase (15Weinberg R.A.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F115-F177Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). A link between cyclin E and malignant transformation has been established by a number of independent studies. Cyclin E was found to be expressed at high levels in a number of human tumors (for an overview see Refs. 26Hall M. Peters G. Adv.

In particular, high levels of cyclin E and low levels of p27Kip1 have been correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer (32Keyomarsi K. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Rosenberg M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In addition, in several types of leukemias, in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cyclin E overexpression was detected and appeared to correlate with low rates of complete remission and disease free survival (36Wolowiec D.

Landberg G. Blood. 1998; 92: 770-777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that cyclin E can cooperate with constitutively active Ha-Ras in the malignant transformation of primary rat embryo fibroblasts (REFs)1 (38Haas K. Johannes C. Geisen C. Schmidt T. Karsunky H. Blass- Kampmann S. Obe G. Möröy T. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2615-2623Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have established a transgenic mouse model in which high levels of ectopically expressed cyclin E was targeted to the T-lymphoid lineage. These animals were significantly more susceptible to the induction of T-cell lymphomas upon treatment with methyl-nitroso-urea (39Karsunky H. Geisen C. Schmidt T. Haas K. Zevnik B. Gau E. Möröy T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7816-7824Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To explore in more detail the molecular mechanisms by which cyclin E overexpression can lead to malignant transformation, we have used cyclin E mutants and the REF transformation assay. We demonstrate here that the oncogenic activity of cyclin E relies on different domains of the protein, which are distinct in their function to mediate binding and/or activation of Cdk2, p27Kip1, and p130 and their ability to drive cells into S phase. cDNAs for cyclin E, cyclin E mutants, and Myc were subcloned into a pLTRΔ7bp vector (40Lovec H. Sewing A. Lucibello F.C. Muller R. Möröy T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 323-326PubMed Google Scholar), which was cut, PstI/T4-DNA-polymerase-blunted, and modified with a part of the multiple cloning site of pBluescript (Stratagene), that was cut NotI/Asp718I/Klenow-blunted, to gain pLTR-MCS+. The vector pEGFP-N3 (CLONTECH) was cut withBamHI/XbaI, and oligonucleotides encoding the FLAG epitope (GATCCATGGACTACAAAGACGATGACGATAAATAGTCTAGAGGC and CTAGGACTATTTATCGTCATCGTCTTTGTAGTCCATG) were inserted into these sites to replace the enhanced green fluorescent protein gene and gain a new vector, pFLAG-N3, which expresses the gene of interest with a C-terminal FLAG epitope under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Cyclin E mutants were PCR-amplified with the respective primers to generate 3′-ends of the cDNAs without stop codons and subsequently subcloned into pFLAG-N3 and pEGFP-N3 to obtain cDNAs coding for C-terminal fusion proteins. pM and pVP16 plasmids (CLONTECH) were cut withEcoRI/HindIII and modified with oligonucleotides encoding a new multiple cloning site (AATTCCTCGAGGGATCCTGCAGATCTA and AGCTTAGATCTGACGGATCCCTCGAGG) to gain pM-MCSnew and pVP16-MCSnew. The cDNAs for WT cyclin E and the cyclin E mutants were subcloned into pVP16 or pVP16-MCSnew. cDNAs for p27Kip1, Cdk2, Cdk3, and Cdk4 were subcloned into pM or pM-MCSnew. All cDNAs used in this study are human in origin. (All primer information is available upon request.) Essentially, experiments were carried out as described earlier (38Haas K. Johannes C. Geisen C.

Pregnant Fisher rats were killed at day 14 after mating, the embryos were removed, and carcasses were prepared in sterile PBS. Cells from the carcasses were isolated using trypsin, EDTA, 1% serum. The cells were separated from debris using low speed centrifugation and subsequently plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum at 3 × 106 cells/145-cm2 dish. After the cells had reached confluence, they were either frozen for storage or replated at 1 × 106 per 56.7-cm2 dish and used for transfection 6 h later. Transfections were carried out using the conventional calcium phosphate precipitation method overnight with 30 μg of plasmid DNA per dish. This included 15 μg of pGEJ6.6 (41Land H. Parada L.F. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1983; 304: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1960) Google Scholar) (containing constitutively active Ha-ras (Ha-Ras-V12) from a human bladder carcinoma) and 15 μg of the respective pLTR-MCS+ plasmid, carrying the cDNA for the cooperating oncogene (Myc as positive control). 16 h after the start of transfection, cells were washed with PBS, and fresh medium was supplied for another 24 h. Cells were then washed with PBS, trypsinized, and replated on four dishes and assayed for focus formation after 12–14 days. NIH 3T3 and HeLa cells were seeded in 12-well dishes (50,000 cells/well) and transfected using a standard Ca3(PO4)2 technique with 1 μg of plasmid DNA/well consisting of plasmids pM, pVP16, 5×Gal4-E1b-luc, and pZeolacZ (Invitrogen) in the ratio 5:5:1:5, respectively. 16 h after transfection, cells were washed with PBS, and fresh medium was supplied for another 24 h. Cells were then washed with PBS and lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (100 mm Tris, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100). 10 μl were subjected to measurement of the luciferase activity using a Lumat LB9507 luminometer (EG & G Berthold). As an internal standard, the activity of β-galactosidase coded for by pZeolacZ was determined using the same lysates and the β-galactosidase reporter gene assay kit (Roche Diagnostics). Luciferase RLU were normalized to β-galactosidase RLU. As a positive control, a Gal4dbd-VP16-fusion protein was expressed from pM3-VP16-plasmid (CLONTECH). Each experiment was performed at least three times in triplicate and in both cell lines. The correct expression of Gal4-dbd and VP16 fusion proteins was controlled by Western blotting using α-VP16, α-Gal4-dbd, and α-cyclin E antibodies (14-5, RK5C1, and HE12, respectively (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and α-cyclin E (Biozol)). NIH 3T3 cells were seeded on glass coverslips, transfected using a standard Ca3(PO4)2 method with pEGFP-N3 plasmids and either pEBFP-N3, pDsred-N3, or pCMV plasmids in an equal ratio. 16 h after transfection, cells were washed with PBS, and fresh medium was supplied for another 24 h. Cells were then washed with PBS and fixed using 1% formaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 20 min. After subsequent washing with PBS and nuclear staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, coverslips were mounted and analyzed using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM510) and software (both from Zeiss). Cell cycle distribution of cells, transiently transfected with pFLAG-N3 expression plasmids and pBB14 (Us9-GFP) as transfection marker (42Kalejta R.F. Brideau A.D. Banfield B.W. Beavis A.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 322-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), were analyzed using a flow cytometer. For cell cycle analysis with propidium iodide staining, transfected cells were trypsinized, pelleted, washed once with cold PBS, and fixed with 70% ethanol and 30% PBS overnight at 4 °C. Cells were collected, incubated in PBS with RNase A (10 μg/ml) and 2 μg/ml propidium iodide (both from Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature in the dark, and subsequently analyzed using a FACSCalibur and Cellquest software (both from Becton Dickinson). The transfected population of cells was gated by choosing the highly GFP-positive cells that overexpress the membrane-residing Us9-GFP marker protein. Toxicity in yeast was measured by transforming YPH 499 yeast (Mata, ura3–52, las2–801, ade2–101, trp1-Δ63, his3-Δ200leu2Δ1(Stratagene)) with plasmids (pRS416Met25) that conferred independence of uracil and the gene of interest, here the different cyclin E mutants, under the regulatable Met25 promoter (2Lew D.J.

By plating on selective medium with or without methionine, the toxic phenotype of the expressed cyclin E variant could be observed by growth or absence of growth depending on methionine. To investigate the ability to rescue a triple cln mutant strain ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae ΔL1 (Matα, ade1, his2, leu2–3, ura3, cln1::TRP1, cln2, cln3, GAL1::Cln2 (2Lew D.J. Dulic V. Reed S.I. Cell. 1991; 66: 1197-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar)), these cells were transformed with the above mentioned regulatable expression plasmids and plated on glucose (restrictive) or galactose (permissive) containing selective media with 1 mm methionine. The ability of cyclin E to rescue the triple Cln-deficient phenotype could be observed under restrictive conditions on glucose medium, when empty vector-transformed ΔL1 yeasts do not survive. Protein extracts were loaded and separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred onto NC-membranes (C++; Amersham Biosciences), and the protein of interest was detected as described previously (39Karsunky H. Geisen C. Schmidt T. Haas K. Zevnik B. Gau E. Möröy T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7816-7824Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Protein lysate concentrations were determined by Bradford assay, and equal amounts of proteins were used for Western blotting (30 μg), immunoprecipitations (100 μg), and kinase assays (200 μg). The following primary antibodies were used: against p27Kip1(C-19), Cdk2 (M2), and human cyclin E (C-19 or HE12) (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Antibody DCS-72 against p27Kip1 was generously provided by J. Bartek, and other antibodies against human cyclin E (N terminus) were from Biozol and against Cdk2 from CLONTECH. As secondary antibody, peroxidase-conjugated donkey α-rabbit IgG or peroxidase-conjugated donkey α-mouse IgG (Dianova) was used. For immunoprecipitation, the lysate volume equivalent to 100 μg of protein was dissolved in 1 ml of Dignam D buffer (20 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 75 mmNaCl, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 3% bovine serum albumin, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml bestatin, 1 μg/ml E64, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mmNa2MoO4) and precleared with 40 μl of a preequilibrated protein A-Sepharose slurry for 30 min. The supernatant was then incubated with 1 μg of the respective antibody for 30 min and 30 μl of a preequilibrated 50% (v/v) protein A-Sepharose slurry for another 90 min; alternatively, M2-agarose (Sigma) was used to precipitate FLAG-tagged proteins. The Sepharose beads were sedimented and washed three times with incubation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 3% bovine serum albumin, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml bestatin, 1 μg/ml E64, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mmNa2MoO4) and resuspended in 4× SDS-gel loading buffer (62 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 0.005% (w/v) bromphenol blue). All of the above mentioned incubations were carried out at 4 °C and constant movement using a head-over-tail-rotator. To assay Cdk2- or cyclin E-linked kinase activity, the respective immune complexes from 200 μg of protein/sample were precipitated as described above, washed three times in incubation buffer and once in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and resuspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mmEGTA, 5 mm MnCl2, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 44.4 μg/ml histone H1 (Roche Diagnostics), or 22.2 μg/ml glutathione S-transferase-Rb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)). Reactions were performed by adding 5 μl of kinase buffer without histone H1 but including 450 μm ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubating the total reaction volume at 37 °C for 30 min, terminated by the addition of 25 μl of SDS-gel loading buffer. Kinase reactions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and subsequently analyzed, using a Fuji bioimager BAS-1500 (Raytest) and Raytest Aida software or analyzed by x-ray film exposure. To determine whether a specific domain or function of cyclin E correlates with its activity to transform REFs in cooperation with an oncogenic, constitutively active Ha-Ras (Ha-Ras-V12) (45Parada L.F. Tabin C.J. Shih C. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1982; 297: 474-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), we constructed a series of cyclin E mutants in a modified pLTR expression vector (40Lovec H. Sewing A. Lucibello F.C. Muller R. Möröy T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 323-326PubMed Google Scholar) that would allow the expression of mutants that lack N-terminal, C-terminal, or central parts of the protein. These constructs were cotransfected into primary REFs together with a plasmid driving the expression of the oncogenic Ha-ras gene, and the formation of foci of transformed cells was scored. Compared with the full-length protein, mutants of cyclin E lacking up to 45 C-terminal or 129 N-terminal amino acids still produced significant numbers of foci that were able to grow as permanent cell lines (mutants 4–8; Fig.1 a). A similar situation was found for mutants 10 and 11, which lacked part of or the whole cyclin box (Fig. 1 a). Mutant 13, which carries an alanine residue instead of a threonine at position 380 and is no longer degradable via the phosphorylation-induced ubiquitin pathway, showed oncogenic activity that was similar to the WT full-length cyclin E in this assay (Fig. 1 a). Only mutants 1–3 and mutant 9 containing aa 1–215, aa 1–250, aa 1–300, or aa 219–395 lost their transforming potential and produced very few foci in REF assays that, in contrast to those generated with the longer mutants, could not be established as permanent lines (Fig. 1 a). Mutant 12, which carries a point mutation at aa 130 and is unable to bind Cdk2, did not give rise to any foci (Fig. 1 a). Analysis of extracts from cell lines that were established from foci demonstrated that all oncogenic cyclin E mutants were expressed at similar levels at the RNA or the protein level (Fig. 1, a and b). In addition, the constructs that were unable to provoke focus formation upon cotransfection with Ha-ras-V12 were also functional and able to express the respective cyclin E mutants in murine fibroblasts (Fig.1 c). The best characterized function of cyclin E is its role in the regulation of cell cycle progression from the G1 to the S phase. Here, cyclin E interacts with Cdk2 and activates its kinase activity to phosphorylate substrates, the most important of them being the pocket protein Rb and p130 (47Hannon G.J. Demetrick D. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2378-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). To test which part of the cyclin E protein is required for this task, all cyclin E deletion mutants were inserted in a vector that allowed expression of the mutants as FLAG-tagged versions. These constructs were transiently transfected into HeLa cells, and the mutant proteins were precipitated with immobilized α-FLAG antibodies (M2-agarose). The precipitates were mixed with histone H1 or glutathione S-transferase-Rb fusion protein, and kinase assays were performed. The protein complexes from this reaction were separated by SDS-PAGE and revealed that the cyclin E WT protein and mutants 5, 6, and 13 were able to phosphorylate both substrates, whereas all other mutants failed to do so (Fig.2). This indicated that already small changes in the cyclin E protein abrogate its ability to form a detectable active kinase complex with Cdk2. To test which cyclin E mutants can still form stable complexes with Cdk2, extracts from transformed REF cell lines that were established from foci and overexpress different cyclin E mutants were subjected to imunoprecipitations with α-Cdk2 antibodies. Western blot analysis of the precipitated complexes revealed that WT cyclin E as well as mutants 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 13 were coprecipitating and thus interacting with Cdk2 (Fig. 2 c). To be able to better quantify the binding of cyclin E mutants to Cdk2 and to detect weaker interactions, we performed a mammalian two-hybrid assay. For this assay, we generated expression constructs that allowed the production of cyclin E and its mutants as fusion proteins with the transactivating domain of VP16. The cDNAs for three known binding partners of cyclin E, namely Cdk2, p27Kip1, and the pocket protein p130, were expressed as fusions with a Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Gal4-dbd). The interaction between cyclin E or different cyclin E mutants and the respective binding partners was measured through the transcriptional activation of a luciferase reporter construct regulated by five Gal4-dbd-binding sites in the promoter (Fig.3 a). The correct expression of the VP16-cyclin E and the Gal4-dbd fusion constructs was determined by Western blotting (Fig. 3 b and data not shown). Clearly, the cyclin E WT protein and the mutants 5 and 6 that still are able to activate Cdk2 showed the strongest interaction with Cdk2 and with all other investigated partner proteins (Fig. 3 a). In addition, the cyclin E mutant 4 and to a lesser extent mutants 7 and 8 can still interact with Cdk2 (Fig. 3 a), confirming our results from the immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 2). Using this system, we also found that cyclin E mutants 7, 8, 10, and 11 did not interact with p27Kip1 or p130 (Fig. 3 a). Whereas cyclin E was not able to bind Cdk4 in this system, we found that, in contrast, Cdk3 could readily interact with WT cyclin E and mutants 5 and 6 and, to a lesser extent, with mutant 4 (data not shown). Cyclin E is critical for the progression of cells from G1to and through S phase, and ectopic expression of cyclin E can accelerate this process (see Introduction). We have tested which part of the cyclin E protein is indispensable for the acceleration of cells by transfecting the constructs, allowing the expression of FLAG-tagged cyclin E mutants (see Fig. 2) transiently into NIH 3T3 or HeLa cells along with a GFP expression construct. After transfection, GFP-positive cells were electronically gated per fluorescence-activated cell sorting and analyzed for their relative distribution within the four cell cycle phases by propidium iodide staining. Only WT cyclin E and the cyclin E mutants 4–6 were able to significantly enhance the relative proportion of transfected cells in S/G2/M phase to over 60%; all other mutants were unable to perform this task (Fig.4). WT cyclin E and mutants 4–6 were also positive for Cdk2 interaction in immunoprecipitation assays as well as in the mammalian two-hybrid test (Figs. 2 and 3), although only the full-length WT cyclin E protein and the mutants 5 and 6 but not mutant 4 showed a readily detectable kinase activity (Fig. 2). This demonstrates that high levels of mutant 4 can accelerate cell cycle progression without activating Cdk2, pointing to additional or alternate mechanisms of cyclin E action in controlling cell cycle progression. It has been demonstrated that high level ectopic expression of human cyclin E is toxic in yeast but on the other hand that low level expression can rescue a lethal yeastcln1−/−, -2−/−, and -3−/−mutation (2Lew D.J.

Expression of c-Myc has been shown to sensitize cells to TNF-mediated apoptosis by inhibiting NF-κB activation. However, the precise step in the NF-κB signaling pathway and apoptosis modified by c-Myc has not been identified. Using the inducible c-MycER system and c-Myc null fibroblasts, we found that expression of c-Myc inhibited NF-κB activation by interfering with RelA/p65 transactivation but not nuclear translocation of NF-κB. Activation of c-Myc promoted TNF-induced release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol because of the inhibition of NF-κB. Furthermore, we found that NF-κB-inducible gene A1 was attenuated by expression of c-Myc and that the restoration of A1 expression suppressed c-Myc-induced TNF sensitization. Our results elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which c-Myc increases cell susceptibility to TNF-mediated apoptosis, indicating that c-Myc may exhibit its pro-apoptotic activities by repression of cell survival genes.

Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2965) Google Scholar). The engagement of TNF receptor 1 by TNF recruits a TNF receptor-associated death domain containing protein (TRADD). TRADD plays a key role in two important signaling pathways: the caspase cascade and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation (2Hsu H. Shu H. Pan M. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). Through interaction with RIP, TRAF2, TRADD activates NF-κB to promote cell growth and cell survival (2Hsu H. Shu H. Pan M. Goeddel D.V.

The primary form of NF-κB is a heterodimer consisting of a DNA-binding subunit (p50) and a transactivation subunit (RelA/p65). In most unstimulated cells, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm by IκB family proteins. Upon stimulation by TNF, IκB kinase complex (IKK) is activated, resulting in the phosphorylation of IκB on two conserved N-terminal serine residues (7Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M.

The phosphorylated IκB is ubiquitinated and subsequently degraded by the 26 S proteasome pathway, liberating NF-κB to the nucleus where it activates gene expression (6Ghosh S. May M. Kopp E. Annu.

Although the induction of nuclear translocation of NF-κB is considered to be an important step for NF-κB-mediated gene transcription, recently, growing evidence has shown that NF-κB activity is also regulated by other mechanisms (9Chen L.

This phosphorylation significantly increased the NF-κB transactivation potential. Recently, we and others found that cell survival kinase Akt stimulated NF-κB transcription activities by modulation of the NF-κB transactivation domain, indicating that the NF-κB pathway played an important role in Akt-mediated cell survival (10Madrid L.V.

In contrast, pro-apoptotic p53 protein had been found to inhibit RelA/p65-dependent transactivation without altering RelA expression or inducible κB-DNA binding. p53-mediated repression of RelA activity was caused by competition for a limiting pool of the transcriptional co-activator protein p300 and cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein in vivo (12Webster G.A.

Following serum deprivation or growth factor withdrawal, c-Myc can induce or sensitize cells to apoptosis by inducing cytochrome crelease that is independent of caspase activation (37Juin P. Hueber A. Littlewood T. Evan G. Gene Dev. 1999; 13: 1367-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Interestingly, several studies also reveal that there is a regulatory connection between c-Myc and cell death receptor-mediated apoptosis (28Klefstrom J. Vastrik I. Saksela E. Valle J. Eilers M. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5442-5450Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 29Klefstrom J. Arighi E. Littlewood T. Jaattela M. Saksela E. Evan G.I.

Science. 1997; 278: 1305-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the CD95/Fas signaling pathway was required for c-Myc-induced apoptosis under serum deprivation. On the other hand, c-Myc expression rendered cells sensitive to TNF-mediated apoptosis in the absence of protein synthesis inhibitor, suggesting that c-Myc inhibits the expression of TNF-inducible anti-apoptotic genes (28Klefstrom J. Vastrik I. Saksela E. Valle J. Eilers M. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5442-5450Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 29Klefstrom J. Arighi E. Littlewood T. Jaattela M. Saksela E. Evan G.I.

Studies by Klefstromet al. (29Klefstrom J. Arighi E. Littlewood T. Jaattela M. Saksela E. Evan G.I. Alitalo K EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7382-7392Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) suggested that induction of TNF sensitivity by c-Myc was involved in NF-κB activation. However, the precise step in the NF-κB signaling pathway and apoptosis regulated by c-Myc has not been identified.In the current study, utilizing the inducible c-MycER system and c-Myc null fibroblasts, we found that the activation of c-Myc inhibited NF-κB transcription by predominantly interfering with the NF-κB transactivation potential but not the nuclear translocation of NF-κB. We found that activation of c-Myc potentiated TNF-induced cytochromec release because of inhibition of NF-κB. The results provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms of c-Myc-mediated TNF sensitization.DISCUSSIONThe pro-apoptotic activities of c-Myc were initially observed under the condition of serum deprivation and growth factor withdrawal (45Askew D.S. Ashmun R.A. Simmons B.C. Cleveland J.L. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1915-1922PubMed Google Scholar, 46Bissonnette R. Echeverri P.F. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Nature. 1992; 359: 552-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). Several target genes regulated by c-Myc, including p19ARF and p53, have been implicated in c-myc-induced apoptosis in response to serum deprivation (36Prendergast G.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2967-2987Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Consistent with its pro-apoptotic functions, c-myc was also capable of sensitizing cells to TNF-mediated apoptosis. Until now, only one study by Klefstrom et al. (29Klefstrom J. Arighi E. Littlewood T. Jaattela M. Saksela E. Evan G.I. Alitalo K EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7382-7392Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) showed that c-myc-mediated sensitization was caused by impairing NF-κB activation, and the mechanism of this inhibition was unclear. In this study, we found that c-Myc inhibited NF-κB activation by interfering with NF-κB transactivational function but not the nuclear translocation of NF-κB. Activation of c-Myc potentiated TNF-induced release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol. In this regard, we identified that the NF-κB-regulated anti-apoptotic genes A1 were suppressed by expression of c-Myc. The restoration of A1 expression inhibited c-Myc-mediated TNF sensitization. To the best of our knowledge, the results are the first to elicit the molecular mechanisms by which c-Myc sensitized cells to TNF-mediated apoptosis.Under serum deprivation, activation of c-Myc has been found to promote apoptosis by induction of the release of cytochrome c, which occurs before caspase activation (37Juin P. Hueber A. Littlewood T. Evan G. Gene Dev. 1999; 13: 1367-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Although both p53 and CD95/Fas signaling was found to play a role in c-Myc-induced apoptosis, neither was required for c-Myc-induced cytochrome c release (37Juin P. Hueber A. Littlewood T. Evan G. Gene Dev. 1999; 13: 1367-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar,38Hueber A.-O. Zornig M. Lyon D. Suda T. Nagata S. Evan G. Science. 1997; 278: 1305-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Thus, induction of cytochrome c release appears to be a primary event induced by c-Myc when cells are deprived of growth factors. Although the exact mechanisms by which c-Myc induces cytochrome c release are not clear, recent studies suggest that Bax is required for promoting cytochrome c release by c-Myc under serum or growth factor deprivation (47Soucie E.L. Annis M.G. Sedivy J. Filmus J. Leber B. Andrews D.W. Penn L.Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4725-4736Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In contrast, under normal growth conditions, expression of c-Myc promotes cell proliferation and is unable to induce the release of cytochromec and apoptosis (38Hueber A.-O. Zornig M. Lyon D. Suda T. Nagata S. Evan G. Science. 1997; 278: 1305-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Our studies suggest that c-Myc attenuated NF-κB transcription by impairing p65/RelA transactivation and subsequently sensitized cells to TNF-mediated apoptosis. Thus, it is unlikely that c-myc sensitizes cells to TNF-mediated apoptosis by direct induction of cytochrome c release. The release of cytochrome c observed in TNF-induced apoptosis induced by expression of c-Myc was a secondary effect. Our previous studies have demonstrated that inhibition of NF-κB by SR-IκBα potentiated TNF-induced caspase-8 activation (24Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.C. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although c-Myc suppressed NF-κB activation, TNF-induced caspase-8 processing was not enhanced by c-Myc. These results suggest that c-Myc may specifically inhibit NF-κB-regulated genes that play an important role in maintaining the integrity of mitochondria.Recently, c-Myc was found to suppress expression of Bcl-XLin primary myeloid and lymphoid progenitors and expression of Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 in precancerous B cells from Eμ-myc transgenic mice. The suppression of Bcl-XL RNA levels by Myc required de novo protein synthesis and was independent of ARF-Mdm2-p53 pathway (44Eischen C.M. Roussel M.F. Korsmeyer S.J. Cleveland J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 21: 7653-7662Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In contrast, we found that expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL was not inhibited by c-Myc. These discrepancies might be due to cell type specificities. Previously, we and others found that induction of Bcl-2 homologue A1 expression by TNF was dependent on NF-κB activation and that ectopic expression of A1 blocked TNF-induced cytochrome c release (25Wang C.-Y. Guttridge D.C. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5923-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that c-Myc inhibited NF-κB activation and thereby attenuated A1 expression, indicating that A1 was a critical target by c-Myc. Nevertheless, our results presented here and the findings of Eischen et al. (44Eischen C.M. Roussel M.F. Korsmeyer S.J. Cleveland J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 21: 7653-7662Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar) provide new insight into mechanisms of the pro-apoptotic function of c-Myc and suggest that c-Myc promotes apoptosis not only by induction of pro-apoptotic genes but also through repression of pro-survival genes. Bcl-2 protein levels have been found to be elevated for compensating c-Myc disregulation in lymphomas (44Eischen C.M. Roussel M.F. Korsmeyer S.J. Cleveland J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 21: 7653-7662Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Along these lines, it would be very interesting to examine whether the expression of A1 is disregulated in c-Myc-associated tumors. NF-κB has also been found to regulate other anti-apoptotic genes such as TRAF-1, TRAF-2, Bcl-XL, XIAP, c-IAP1, c-IAP2, and NF-κB-inducible death effector domain-containing protein (20Chen C. Edelstein L.C. Gélinas C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2687-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar, 21Chu Z.L. McKinsey T. Liu L. Gentry J. Malim M. Ballard D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 26398-26404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that disregulation of c-Myc only affects a subset of these genes. For example, we found that c-IAP2 expression was moderately reduced by c-Myc, which might lower the threshold of apoptosis, whereas TRAF-1 expression was not inhibited by c-Myc. The underlying mechanisms were unknown. The results may be related to the regulation of the promoter regions of these genes following c-Myc activation. However, it remains possible that c-Myc may inhibit unidentified NF-κB-regulated anti-apoptotic genes.The results presented here significantly extended previous studies and demonstrated that disregulation of c-Myc inhibited TNF-induced NF-κB activation through attenuating p65/RelA transactivation potential. In contrast, during the revision of this manuscript, Tanaka et al. (49Tanaka H. Matsumura I. Ezoe S. Satoh S. Sakamaki T. Albanese C. Machii T. Pestell R.G. Kanakura Y. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1017-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) reported that c-Myc blocked TNF-induced NF-κB binding activities. Currently, we cannot provide an explanation for this difference. Because of the technical difficulty, we could not determine whether the inhibition of NF-κB by c-Myc was required for de novo protein synthesis because the luciferase reporter was generally down-regulated in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors. There are several potential mechanisms by which c-Myc could inhibit p65/RelA transactivation. One is that c-Myc may interact with p65 to inhibit NF-κB transactivation. The c-Myc-binding partner Max has been found to bind to Mad family proteins, which are associated with Sin3, the transcriptional corepressor N-Cor, and histone deacetylases (48Ayer D.E. Laherty C.D. Lawrence Q.A. Armstrong A.P. Eisenman R.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5772-5781Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, our immunoprecipitation experiments found that c-Myc did not interact with p65/RelA or p50. In addition, our supershift assays found that c-Myc did not exist in the NF-κB-binding complex. 2Z. You and C.-Y. Wang, unpublished observation. Thus, it is unlikely that c-Myc inhibits NF-κB transactivation by recruiting co-repressors. However, we could not rule out the possibility that the interaction between p65 and c-Myc was transient and potentially unstable. It is therefore likely that c-Myc suppresses NF-κB transactivation by inducing c-Myc-regulated gene products. In the future, it would be very interesting to determine whether c-Myc-induced genes inhibit NF-κB transactivation using the Gal4-p65 reporter assay. These results will provide new insight into the regulation of NF-κB activation by c-Myc. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)1 is a pleiotropic cytokine that plays an important role in apoptosis, inflammation, and cell growth (1Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2965) Google Scholar). The engagement of TNF receptor 1 by TNF recruits a TNF receptor-associated death domain containing protein (TRADD). TRADD plays a key role in two important signaling pathways: the caspase cascade and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation (2Hsu H. Shu H. Pan M. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). Through interaction with RIP, TRAF2, TRADD activates NF-κB to promote cell growth and cell survival (2Hsu H. Shu H. Pan M. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar, 3Devin A. Cook A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Kelliher M. Liu Z. Immunity. 2000; 12: 419-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Conversely, TRADD recruits both Fas-associated death domain containing protein and caspase-8 to induce apoptotic caspase cascade under inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway (1Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2965) Google Scholar, 2Hsu H. Shu H. Pan M. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). NF-κB is initially identified and named for its role in the control of immunoglobin κ-chain gene expression in B lymphocytes (4Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5542) Google Scholar, 5Boothby M.R. Mora A. Scherer D. Brockman J. Ballard D. J. Exp.

The primary form of NF-κB is a heterodimer consisting of a DNA-binding subunit (p50) and a transactivation subunit (RelA/p65). In most unstimulated cells, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm by IκB family proteins. Upon stimulation by TNF, IκB kinase complex (IKK) is activated, resulting in the phosphorylation of IκB on two conserved N-terminal serine residues (7Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar, 8Régnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M. Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated IκB is ubiquitinated and subsequently degraded by the 26 S proteasome pathway, liberating NF-κB to the nucleus where it activates gene expression (6Ghosh S. May M. Kopp E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4570) Google Scholar). Although the induction of nuclear translocation of NF-κB is considered to be an important step for NF-κB-mediated gene transcription, recently, growing evidence has shown that NF-κB activity is also regulated by other mechanisms (9Chen L.

For example, two recent studies have shown that the Ca2+- and Na+-binding sites in FXa appear to be allosterically linked (e.g. changes at one site influence the other andvice versa) (9Underwood M.C. Zhong D. Mathur A. Heyduk T. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36876-36884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Rezaie A.R. He X. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1817-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition to linkage between the Na+- and Ca2+-binding sites, the S1 specificity site is also allosterically linked to the Na+-binding site but not the Ca2+ site (9Underwood M.C. Zhong D. Mathur A. Heyduk T. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36876-36884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Similar results were also recently reported for the anticoagulant protein, activated protein C (19Schmidt A.E. Padmanabhan K. Underwood M.C. Bode W. Mather T. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28987-28995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Whether Na+ binding to the catalytic domain of serine proteases has physiological relevance is open to debate, considering that the plasma concentration of Na+ is tightly regulated at ∼150 mm. It is important to consider, however, that for certain enzymes such as thrombin, the dissociation constant for Na+ is close to 150 mm (13Wells C.M. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11721-11730Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), indicating that small changes in the cation concentration or, more likely, changes in the availability of allosteric effector molecules that are linked to the Na+-binding site can dramatically influence enzyme activity (20Dang Q.D. Vindigni A. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5977-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The reported dissociation constant of Na+for calcium-bound APC is ∼23 mm, indicating that in vivo most of the APC would be bound to Na+ (19Schmidt A.E. Padmanabhan K. Underwood M.C. Bode W. Mather T. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28987-28995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The results with FXa and prothrombinase, however, are less clear. For example, the reported dissociation constant of Na+ for calcium-bound FXa ranges from 43 to 280 mm (9Underwood M.C. Zhong D. Mathur A. Heyduk T. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36876-36884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Rezaie A.R. He X.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5349-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Results with prothrombinase indicate that the activity of wild-type FXa incorporated into prothrombinase using various monovalent cations was minimally (<1.5-fold) affected by the presence of Na+ in the reaction buffer. However, this apparently was not the case using a Gla domainless form of FXa incorporated into prothrombinase or a Gla domainless variant (GDFXaY225P), since the rate of prethrombin-1 activation in the absence of Na+ was dramatically decreased (18Rezaie A.R. He X. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1817-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The Tyr225 to Pro variant in GDFXa and thrombin was shown to be essentially insensitive to Na+, and it behaves in a similar fashion to the wild-type enzymes assayed in the absence of Na+ (15Dang Q.D. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10653-10656Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 18Rezaie A.R. He X. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1817-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 22Guinto E.R. Caccia S. Rose T. Futterer K. Waksman G. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1852-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Reasons for the discrepancy between GDFXaY225P and GDFXa incorporated into prothrombinase in the absence of Na+compared with full-length FXa are currently not clear, but they could relate to unanticipated effects of various monovalent cations on other constituents of prothrombinase or to the nature of GDFXa compared with full-length FXa in the assembly and function within prothrombinase under these conditions. In the current study, three unresolved questions with respect to the FXa Na+-binding site were investigated: 1) does alteration of the Na+-binding site affect prothrombinase complex assembly; 2) what is the molecular basis for the reduced affinity of active site-directed probes for FXa in the absence of Na+; and 3) is the FXa Na+ binding site allosterically linked to other structural determinants in the protease domain? These questions were approached using a full-length, fully γ-carboxylated derivative of FXa, rFXaY225P. This particular variant of FXa is a useful tool to study the Na+-free state of the enzyme, since it has a markedly reduced sensitivity toward Na+ (as does thrombin Y225P (22Guinto E.R. Caccia S. Rose T. Futterer K. Waksman G. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1852-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar)), thus allowing for assessment of prothrombinase assembly in the presence of physiologically relevant concentrations of this monovalent cation. Hepes, sodium chloride, sodium cyanate, and polyethylene glycol (average M r = 8000) were from J. T. Baker Inc. Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, calcium chloride, EDTA, Russell's viper venom, and IEGR-AMC were purchased from Sigma. The fluorophore 4-aminobenazmidine (PAB) was from Aldrich. The concentrations of IEGR-AMC and PAB were determined in water using E 325 = 17,200m−1 cm−1 (23Jordan S.P. Mao S.S. Lewis S.D. Shafer J.A.

The peptidyl substrate methoxycarbonyl-cyclohexylglycyl-glycyl-arginine-ρ-nitroanilide (SpecXa) was from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT). H-d-phenylalanyl-pipecolyl-arginine-ρ-nitroanilide, S-2765, and S-2222 were purchased from Chromogenix (West Chester, OH). Substrate solutions were prepared in water, and concentrations were verified using E 342 = 8270m−1 cm−1 (25Lottenberg R. Jackson C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 558-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The affinity resin (AHV-5101-Seph) used to purify human FV from plasma and human thrombin were purchased from Hematologic Technologies (Essex Junction, VT). The calcium-dependent monoclonal human FX antibody (4G3 (26Kim D.J. James H.L. Biotechnol.

Tissue culture reagents were from Invitrogen.l-α-Phosphatidylserine (brain, sodium salt) andl-α-phosphatidylcholine (egg yolk) were purchased from Avanti Polarlipids (Alabaster, AL). Small unilamellar phospholipid vesicles composed of 75% (w/w) phosphatidylcholine and 25% (w/w) phosphatidylserine (PCPS) were prepared as described previously (27Barenholz Y. Gibbes D. Litman B.J. Goll J. Thompson T.E. Carlson F.D. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2806-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). The concentration of the phospholipid vesicles was determined by phosphorous assay (28Gomori G. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1942; 27: 955-960Google Scholar). Human FX was isolated from fresh frozen plasma essentially as described (29Krishnaswamy S. Field K.A. Edgington T.S. Morrissey J.H. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26110-26120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The FX activator (RVVX-CP) was purified from crude venom of Russell's viper as described previously (30Kisiel W. Hermodson M.A. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4901-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Plasma-derived FV was isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography as described by Katzmann et al. (31Katzmann J.A. Nesheim M.E. Hibbard L.S. Mann K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Human FVa was prepared by proteolytic activation of FV by thrombin and purified as described (32Kalafatis M. Krishnaswamy S. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 224-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Plasma-derived human antithrombin III, recombinant tick anticoagulant peptide (rTAP) expressed in Pichia Pastoris, and recombinant prethrombin-2 expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells were generous gifts from Dr. Sriram Krishnaswamy (The Joseph Stokes Jr. Research Institute, Philadelphia, PA). Molecular weights and extinction coefficients ( E 280nm0.1%) of the various proteins used were taken as follows: RVVX-CP, 93,000 and 1.18 (33Gowda D.C. Jackson C.M. Davidson E.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1988; 263: 5714-5723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); factor X, 56,000 and 1.16 (38Di Scipio R.G. Hermodson M.A. Yates S.G. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 698-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar); factor Xa 45,300 and 1.16 (38Di Scipio R.G. Hermodson M.A. Yates S.G. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 698-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The recombinant FX mutant Tyr225 → Pro (FXaY225P) was generated with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using two complementary oligonucleotides containing the desired mutation, the sense strand being 5′-CGTAAGGGGAAGCCCGGGATCTACACC-3′. The entire FX cDNA was sequenced in order to confirm the presence of the desired mutation and to ensure that there were no polymerase-induced errors. Wild-type or mutant rFX in the mammalian expression plasmid pCMV4 were stably expressed in HEK 293 cells and purified as previously described (39Larson P.J. Camire R.M. Wong D. Fasano N.C. Monroe D.M. Tracy P.B. High K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5029-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 40Camire R.M. Larson P.J. Stafford D.W. High K.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14322-14329Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Plasma-derived FX (pdFX) and rFX were activated using RVVX-CP and subsequently purified using benzamidine-Sepharose or Sephacryl S-200 as described (39Larson P.J. Camire R.M. Wong D. Fasano N.C. Monroe D.M. Tracy P.B. High K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5029-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 41Krishnaswamy S. Church W.R. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3291-3299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following purification, plasma-derived and recombinant FXa molecules were precipitated, collected by centrifugation, dissolved in 50% glycerol, and stored at −20 °C. Protein purity was assessed using precast NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) using the MES buffer system under reducing (50 mm dithiothreitol, final concentration) and nonreducing conditions followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Gla analysis was carried out according to the modified method of Price (42Price P.A. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) for alkaline hydrolysis. Separation of amino acids was accomplished using a DC-4A cation exchange column on a Waters LC-1 Plus high pressure liquid chromatograph (Milford, MA), and quantitation was done by postcolumn derivatization as described by Przysiecki (43Przysiecki C.T. Staggers J.E. Ramjit H.G. Musson D.G. Stern A.M. Bennett C.D. Friedman P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7856-7860Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This analysis indicates that rwtFX and FXY225P have essentially the full complement of Gla residues (10.5–10.8 mol of Gla/mol of FX) compared with pdFX (10.7 mol of Gla/mol of FX; theoretical = 11 mol of Gla/mol of FX). All kinetic measurements were performed in 20 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5 (assay buffer) unless otherwise indicated. The kinetics of peptidyl substrate hydrolysis (SpecXa, S-2765, and S-2222) was measured using increasing concentrations of substrate and initiated with either FXa or FXa assembled into prothrombinase. The ability of PAB to bind to FXa or prothrombinase was assessed by two independent methods. In the first method, the inhibitory constant (K i) of PAB for FXa or prothrombinase was assessed assuming classical competitive inhibition by initial velocity measurements of SpecXa hydrolysis by either enzyme using increasing concentrations of substrate at different fixed concentrations of PAB as previously described (44Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the second method, the binding of PAB to FXa or prothrombinase was directly assessed by fluorescence measurements essentially as described (45Betz A. Vlasuk G.P. Bergum P.W. Krishnaswamy S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Overall dissociation constants for rTAP binding to FXa and prothrombinase were inferred from measurements of residual enzyme amidolytic activity following incubation of the protease with increasing concentrations of the inhibitor essentially as described (46Krishnaswamy S. Vlasuk G.P. Bergum P.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7897-7907Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The rate of inactivation of FXa or prothrombinase by human antithrombin III was measured under pseudo-first order rate conditions. For the inhibition of FXa, human antithrombin III (0.16, 0.32, and 0.64 μm) was incubated with FXa (5 nm; FXaY225P, 10 nm) in assay buffer for up to 75 min (12 time points). At the end of the time course, 50 μl of SpecXa was added (100 μm final concentration) to monitor residual enzyme activity. For the inhibition of prothrombinase, human antithrombin III (1.6, 3.2, and 6.4 μm) was incubated with FXa (5 nm), FVa (50 nm), and PCPS (60 μm) in assay buffer for up to 30 min (12 points). Residual enzyme activity was monitored as described above. In both assays, each measurement was made in duplicate. Apparent dissociation constants (K d(app)) for FXa binding to FVa-PCPS were inferred from an assay measuring thrombin generation at various FVa concentrations as described previously (47Krishnaswamy S. Walker R.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3319-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Assay mixtures contained PCPS (60 μm), FXa (5 nm), recombinant prethrombin-2 (2 μm), and FVa at various concentrations (0.7–54.0 nm) in assay buffer. The kinetic parameters of prothrombinase-catalyzed prethrombin-2 activation (K m(app) andV max) were determined by measuring the initial rate of thrombin formation at increasing prethrombin-2 concentrations as described (47Krishnaswamy S. Walker R.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3319-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Assay mixtures contained PCPS vesicles (60 μm), FVa (30 nm), and various concentrations of recombinant prethrombin-2 (0–21 μm). Reaction mixtures (200 μl) containing SpecXa (10–850 μm) and PCPS (60 μm) with different fixed concentrations of FVa (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0, 10, and 20 nm) were prepared in the wells of a 96-well plate and allowed to incubate for 5 min at room temperature. Because the substrate stock solution was prepared in water, an appropriate volume of 10× assay buffer solution adjusted to pH 7.75 was added to each mixture to ensure that the final pH and concentration of buffer solutes were invariant. The reaction was initiated with FXaY225P (3 nm final concentration). Mixtures containing FXaY225P or pdFXa (1–2 μm) in assay buffer were incubated in the presence or absence of different fixed concentrations of PAB (50–2200 μm; 10 concentrations) and were reacted with either 0.2 or 0.6 m NaNCO. The final pH of the reaction mixture upon the addition of NaNCO was pH 7.45. At selected time intervals (5–300 min), 5 μl of the reaction mixture was placed in 95 μl of assay buffer, and the residual enzymatic activity was determined from initial steady state rates of SpecXa hydrolysis, or aliquots were mixed with 1.5 m hydroxylamine, pH 8.0, and then frozen at −80 °C for N-terminal sequence analysis. Amino-terminal sequence analysis was performed in the laboratory of Dr. Jan Pohl (Emory University Microchemical Facility). Quenched protein samples at various time points (40 pmol) were mixed with rTAP (20 pmol; internal protein control) and spotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and N-terminal sequence analysis was performed using an automated PE-Biosystems 491A pulsed liquid sequencer on-line with a PE-Biosystems 140S PTH analyzer. The peak area (in pmol) of PTH-Ile (first cycle of the heavy chain of FXa) and PHT-Tyr (first cycle of rTAP) were determined simultaneously. Control experiments included incubating the mutant protein as described above but in the presence of 0.2m NaCl. Data were analyzed according to the indicated equations by nonlinear least squares regression analysis using the Marquardt algorithm (48Bevington P.R. Robinson K.D. Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences. McGraw-Hill, New York1992Google Scholar). The qualities of the fits were assessed by the criteria described (49Straume M. Johnson M.L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 87-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Fitted parameters are reported ± 95% confidence limits. Initial velocity measurements of peptidyl substrate or macromolecular substrate (prethrombin-2) hydrolysis by FXa or prothrombinase were analyzed by fitting the data to the Henri-Michaelis-Menten equation (50Segal I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady State Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar) to yield fitted values for K m andV max. Initial velocity measurements of SpecXa hydrolysis by FXa or prothrombinase using increasing concentrations of substrate at different fixed concentrations of PAB were analyzed according to the rate expression for linear competitive inhibition (50Segal I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady State Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar) to yield the fitted values for K m,V max, and K i. Initial velocity data obtained following incubation of increasing concentrations of rTAP with two fixed concentrations of FXa or prothrombinase were analyzed as described (45Betz A. Vlasuk G.P. Bergum P.W. Krishnaswamy S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Data derived from direct fluorescence binding measurements between PAB and FXa and PAB and prothrombinase were analyzed as described previously (45Betz A. Vlasuk G.P. Bergum P.W. Krishnaswamy S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) taking into account the inner filter effect (51Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar). The rate of inhibition of FXa or prothrombinase by antithrombin III was measured under pseudo-first order rate conditions, and the second order rate constant was calculated by dividing the pseudo-first order rate constant by the concentration of antithrombin III. Dissociation constants and stoichiometries for the interaction between FXa and PCPS-bound FVa were obtained from the dependence of the initial rate on the concentrations of factor Va (52Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3708-3718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The equilibrium dissociation constants for the binding of FVa to membrane-bound FXa in the absence (K d1) and presence of peptidyl substrate (K d2) as well as the substrate dissociation constant for FXa (K s1) and membrane-bound FXa saturated with FVa (K s2) were calculated from initial velocity measurements of SpecXa hydrolysis at different fixed concentrations of FVa according to the system of ordinary differential equations describing Scheme I and using the rapid equilibrium assumption. The entire data set was globally fit using the program Dynafit (53Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar) to extractK s1, k cat1,K d1, K s2,K d2, andk cat2.

The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase family of protein kinases includes ATM (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated) and ATR (A-T and rad3-related), which are proximal to DNA abnormalities and send signals to regulate the mitosis-promoting cyclin B1-Cdk1 complex during G2checkpoint responses. After DNA damage, one mechanism of G2 checkpoint control involves regulation of cyclin B1-Cdk1 kinase activity. At the onset of mitosis, cyclin B1-Cdk1 kinase becomes active when the dual specificity phosphatase, Cdc25C, removes inhibitory phosphorylations on Cdk1. Once active, cyclin B1-Cdk1 complexes phosphorylate Cdc25C, which enhances its phosphatase activity. This results in an autocatalytic feedback loop and, therefore, generates a burst of cyclin B1-Cdk1 kinase activity that drives progression into mitosis. The G2checkpoint carries out cell cycle arrest in part by inhibiting the activity of cyclin B1-Cdk1 complexes through the effector kinase Chk1. After DNA damage and replication blocks, Chk1 is phosphorylated and activated by ATR and possibly ATM (5Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F.

Chk1 phosphorylates Cdc25C in a 14-3-3 binding site, which causes 14-3-3 to sequester Cdc25C away from cyclin B1-Cdk1 and prevents activation of cyclin B1-Cdk1 complexes (9Peng C.Y. Graves P.R.

Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). Initiation of the cyclin B1-Cdk1 autoamplification loop requires prior activation of Cdc25C. The kinase that first activates Cdc25C (the mitotic trigger kinase) has not been rigorously identified, although some evidence points to polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1).1 Polo-like kinases are a conserved group of protein kinases that are involved at several points in mitotic progression. They are thought to function in diverse processes such as the G2 to M cycle transition, centrosome assembly and separation, formation of the mitotic spindle, activation of the anaphase-promoting complex, and cytokinesis (11Glover D.M. Hagan I.M. Tavares A.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3777-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 12Nigg E.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Human and Xenopus polo-like kinases (Plk1 and Plx1, respectively) have been proposed to initiate mitosis by activating Cdc25C and participating in the Cdc25C/cyclin B1-Cdk1 amplification loop (13Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Taieb F.E. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1791-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 14Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Maller J.L.

Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1751-1757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of cyclin B1-Cdk1 kinase activity during the G2 checkpoint has been suggested to occur through inhibition of Plk1 activity, which would presumably result in an inability of Cdc25C phosphatase to activate cyclin B1-Cdk1 complexes. Evidence supporting a role for regulation of Plk1 in the G2 checkpoint includes the findings that cells experiencing a DNA damage-induced mitotic delay displayed an associated decrease in Plk1 kinase activity, and overexpression of a constitutively active mutant of Plk1 reversed the mitotic delay (17Smits V.A. Klompmaker R. Arnaud L. Rijksen G. Nigg E.A. Medema R.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Moreover, Plk1 activity was decreased in an ATM- and/or ATR-dependent manner after treatment of cells with radiomimetic drugs and UVC, respectively (18van Vugt M.A. Smits V.A. Klompmaker R. Medema R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41656-41660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Another mechanism of G2 checkpoint control independent of cyclin B1-Cdk1 activity is nuclear exclusion of cyclin B1. At the onset of mitosis, phosphorylation of cyclin B1 causes an inhibition of nuclear export and enhanced nuclear import, resulting in a net accumulation of cyclin B1-Cdk1 complexes in the nucleus (19Li J. Meyer A.N. Donoghue D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 502-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 20Hagting A. Karlsson C. Clute P. Jackman M. Pines J.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2728-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Interfering with nuclear exclusion of cyclin B1 and down-regulation of Cdk1 kinase activity were required to significantly reverse the DNA damage G2 checkpoint in HeLa cells (23Toyoshima F. Moriguchi T. Wada A. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2728-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 24Jin P. Hardy S. Morgan D.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In theXenopus system, phosphorylation of Ser-113 (analogous to Ser-147 in human cyclin B1), which resides within the cyclin B1 nuclear export sequence, interfered with the ability of the Crm1 nuclear receptor to bind to cyclin B1 and thereby inhibited nuclear export (25Yang J. Song H. Walsh S. Bardes E.S. Kornbluth S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3604-3609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Plk1 was recently shown to phosphorylate human cyclin B1 at Ser-147 and promote its nuclear accumulation (26Toyoshima-Morimoto F. Taniguchi E. Shinya N. Iwamatsu A. Nishida E. Nature. 2001; 410: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Thus, activation of Plk1 in G2 appears to drive mitotic progression by promoting the accumulation of cyclin B1 in the nucleus in addition to participating in the Cdc25C-cyclin B1-Cdk1 autocatalytic feedback loop. The G2 checkpoint may regulate the sub-cellular compartmentalization of cyclin B1-Cdk1 by controlling the phosphorylation status of cyclin B1 through inhibition of Plk1 activity. The bisdioxopiperazine, ICRF-193, is a topoisomerase II inhibitor that does not cause DNA damage but rather appears to block topoisomerase II at a point in its catalytic cycle after strand passage and religation but before release of the passed DNA and ATP hydrolysis (27Roca J. Ishida R. Berger J.M. Andoh T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Therefore, ICRF-193 sequesters topoisomerase II in a “closed-clamp” conformation that tethers two DNA strands and blocks additional cycles of strand passage (27Roca J. Ishida R. Berger J.M. Andoh T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). A checkpoint is activated in G2when topoisomerase II is inhibited with ICRF-193 (3Downes C.S. Clarke D.J. Mullinger A.M. Gimenez-Abian J.F. Creighton A.M. Johnson R.T. Nature. 1994; 372: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 4Deming P.B. Cistulli C.A. Zhao H. Graves P.R. Piwnica-Worms H. Paules R.S. Downes C.S. Kaufmann W.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12044-12049Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The topoisomerase II-dependent G2 checkpoint response to ICRF-193 was recently reported to be distinct from the DNA damage G2 checkpoint as it was ATM-independent and did not appear to be enforced through inhibition of cyclin B1-Cdk1 kinase activity. Rather, it was suggested that ATR-dependent signaling acted to sustain the nuclear exclusion of cyclin B1-Cdk1 complexes (4Deming P.B. Cistulli C.A. Zhao H. Graves P.R. Piwnica-Worms H. Paules R.S. Downes C.S. Kaufmann W.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12044-12049Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that inhibition of Plk1 kinase activity occurs in an ATR-dependent manner in cells arrested in G2 by ICRF-193. The mitotic delay response to ICRF-193 was reversed in cells expressing constitutively active Plk1 alleles, strongly suggesting that Plk1 kinase is an important element of the topoisomerase II-dependent G2checkpoint. G2 cells arrested with ICRF-193 also displayed reduced serine phosphorylation of cyclin B1 in vivo and reduced kinase activity on cyclin B1 in cell-free extracts. Taken together these data support a model for the topoisomerase II-dependent G2 checkpoint whereby ATR signaling inhibits Plk1 activity, which in turn blocks the phosphorylation of cyclin B1 and prevents the accumulation of nuclear cyclin B1-Cdk1 complexes. NHF1-hTERT cells were maintained in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mm glutamine. For synchrony experiments, NHF1-hTERT cells were grown to confluence arrest and then released into 2 μg/ml aphidicolin for 24 h after which they were rinsed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (28Kaufmann W.K. Wilson S.J. Mutat. Res. 1994; 314: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Fresh culture media was then added and the cells were returned to the incubator for 8 h. Cells were determined to be in the G2 phase of the cycle as evidenced by 4N DNA content with very few cells staining for the mitotic marker, phospho-histone H3. G2 phase cells were harvested or incubated with 0.01% Me2SO or 2 μm ICRF-193 in the presence of 100 ng/ml Colcemid for an additional 4 h. Cells were prepared for metaphase spreads as previously described (29Kaufmann W.K. Schwartz J.L. Hurt J.C. Byrd L.L. Galloway D.A. Levedakou E. Paules R.S. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1105-1114PubMed Google Scholar). The AT diploid fibroblast cell line (GM03395) was maintained in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% FBS and 2 mml-glutamine. GM847 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm glutamine, and 0.4 mg/ml G418 sulfate (30Cliby W.A. Roberts C.J. Cimprich K.A. Stringer C.M. Lamb J.R. Schreiber S.L. Friend S.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). For induction of kinase-inactive ATR allele, ATRki, 5.0 × 105 cells were plated into 100-mm dishes, and 1 μg/ml doxycycline was added for 48 h. HeLa cells were maintained in minimum Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS and 2 mml-glutamine. For transfections, cells were plated at a density of 8.0 × 105 cells/60-mm dish. After plating, cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of GFP-H2B plasmid together with 2 μg of control vector (pBABE plasmid DNA) or 2 μg of one of the Myc-tagged Plk-1 plasmids (wild type, T210D, or T210D and S137D (TDSD)) (17Smits V.A. Klompmaker R. Arnaud L. Rijksen G. Nigg E.A. Medema R.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) using Polyfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were either harvested for Western blot analysis, or ICRF-193-induced G2 arrest was assessed. Cells were incubated with Me2SO or 2 μm ICRF-193 for 2 h, and then mitotic index was quantified. For determination of serine phosphorylation of endogenous cyclin B1, this protein was immunoprecipitated from 200 μg of total cell extract using a cyclin B1 monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitates were then subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis (8% polyacrylamide gel) and immunoblotted with rabbit polyclonal anti-serine antibody (1:1000, Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Mitotic cells were quantified via flow cytometric analysis of cells with 4N DNA that stained positive for the mitotic epitope phospho-histone H3 (31Xu B. Kim S.T. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3445-3450Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested, rinsed with PBS, then resuspended in 1% formaldehyde in PBS and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were then rinsed once with PBS and stored in 70% ethanol at 4 °C. At the time of staining, cells were rinsed in PBS, pelleted, and resuspended in PBS containing 0.5 μg of anti-phospho-histone H3 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology), 5% FBS, 0.1% sodium azide, and NaCl (IFA solution) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were then rinsed twice in IFA, resuspended in fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse antibody diluted 1:20 (Santa Cruz) in IFA, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. After 2 washes in IFA, cells were resuspended in IFA containing propidium iodine (PI) (0.5 μg/ml) and RNase (2.5 μg/ml) and incubated at 37 °C for at least 30 min. For experiments with transfected HeLa cells, cells were fixed with 90% ethanol and 2.5% acetic acid in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were then rinsed with PBS, and nuclei were stained with DAPI (4′,5′-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride). The fraction of mitotic cells in 2000 GFP-positive cells was determined by fluorescence microscopy. Cyclin B1-associated Cdk1 kinase activity assays were performed as previously described (4Deming P.B. Cistulli C.A. Zhao H. Graves P.R. Piwnica-Worms H. Paules R.S. Downes C.S. Kaufmann W.K. Proc.

Cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, and 5 mm EDTA and incubated on ice for 20 min. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 45,000 rpm for 20 min. Plk1 was immunoprecipitated using 1 μg of a rabbit anti-Plk1 antibody (a generous gift from Doug Ferris, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health or from Upstate Biotechnology) from 300–500 μg of total protein. Samples were precleared for 30 min with protein G beads previously washed in 10× PBS and 1× kinase buffer. Samples were incubated with anti-Plk1 antibody for 2 h at 4 °C, after which 20 μl of protein G beads was added. After 30 min, samples were washed four times with kinase buffer and once in reaction buffer (20 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm NaF, 10 nm orthovanadate). Samples were then incubated with 20 μl of kinase buffer, 5 mg of dephosphorylated α-casein (Sigma), and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 34 °C for 50 min. The kinase reaction was stopped by the addition of 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide gel) and autoradiography. Cells were lysed in kinase lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmNaVO4, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm okadaic acid, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 μm AEBSF (4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride; Sigma) and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min. Cell extract (200 μg) was then incubated with 100 μm cold ATP, 15 mm MgCl2, and 2 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP for 45 min at 30 °C. Cyclin B1 was immunoprecipitated from the kinase reaction by adding 1 μg of cyclin B1 monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) and lysis buffer and incubating for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein G beads (Sigma) were added, and samples were incubated for an additional 30 min, after which the beads were washed 4 times with kinase lysis buffer. Cyclin B1 immunoprecipitates were then subjected to SDS-PAGE (8% acrylamide gel) and autoradiography. Plk1 activity levels are low in G1and S phase but start to rise in G2 and peak in mitosis (33Hamanaka R. Smith M.R. O'Connor P.M. Maloid S. Mihalic K. Spivak J.L. Longo D.L. Ferris D.K. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1617-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Because Plk1 activity is regulated by the DNA damage checkpoint and one function of Plk1 involves regulation of cyclin B1 localization, we determined whether ICRF-193-induced mitotic delay was associated with an inhibition of Plk1 activity. Normal human fibroblasts expressing telomerase (NHF1-hTERT) were synchronized to the G2 phase of the cell cycle and then incubated with ICRF-193 or solvent in the presence of Colcemid for an additional 4 h. Under these conditions there were few cells in the G2 phase population that stained positive for the mitotic marker, phospho-histone H3 (0.1%) (Fig.1 A). Me2SO-treated control cells accumulated in mitosis 8–12 h after release from aphidicolin (53%) (Fig. 1 A). Treatment of G2phase cells with ICRF-193 produced a severe inhibition of entry into mitosis compared with the control cells (89%, p = 0.001), as reflected by the low mitotic index (4.5%) (Fig. 1,A and C). As expected, Plk1 activity was low in G2-phase cells and significantly increased in control cells that had progressed to mitosis (Fig. 1 B). Cells treated with ICRF-193 displayed a significant inhibition of Plk1 activity compared with the control Me2SO-treated mitotic cells (34% of control, p = 0.006) (Fig. 1 C). It is important to note that ICRF-193-treated cells displayed higher Plk1 activity than cells harvested 4 h earlier at the beginning of G2 (Fig. 1 B), indicating that Plk1 activation was not completely prevented by the ICRF-193-induced checkpoint. It has been suggested that inhibition of Plk1 activity during G2checkpoint responses may control mitotic entry through regulation of cyclin B1-Cdk1 activity (17Smits V.A. Klompmaker R. Arnaud L. Rijksen G. Nigg E.A. Medema R.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 18van Vugt M.A. Smits V.A. Klompmaker R. Medema R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41656-41660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Given that we have previously reported a mitotic delay response to topoisomerase II inhibition with ICRF-193 despite high cyclin B1-Cdk1 kinase activity in log phase NHF1-hTERT fibroblasts and other human cell types (4Deming P.B. Cistulli C.A. Zhao H. Graves P.R. Piwnica-Worms H. Paules R.S. Downes C.S. Kaufmann W.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12044-12049Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), we investigated whether ICRF-193-induced inhibition of Plk1 activity was associated with an inhibition of cyclin B1 activity in synchronized cells. In synchronized NHF1-hTERT fibroblasts, cyclin B1-Cdk1 activity was low in G2 phase cells and high in mitotic cells (Fig.1 B). Cells undergoing an ICRF-193-induced mitotic delay displayed a substantial increase in cyclin B1-Cdk1 kinase activity when compared with G2-phase cells harvested 4 h earlier (Fig. 1 B). Consistent with our previous report in log-phase cells (4Deming P.B. Cistulli C.A. Zhao H. Graves P.R. Piwnica-Worms H. Paules R.S. Downes C.S. Kaufmann W.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12044-12049Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), G2-phase fibroblasts arrested with ICRF-193 displayed only a small inhibition of cyclin B1-Cdk1 kinase activity (28%, p = 0.14) compared with the control cells allowed to accumulate in mitosis (Fig. 1 B). These findings taken together with the observation of strong inhibition of Plk1 kinase activity (66%) (Fig. 1 C) suggest that inhibition of Plk1 activity and cyclin B1-Cdk1 activation during the topoisomerase II-dependent G2 checkpoint response are not directly linked. It was recently reported that inhibition of Plk1 activity after treatment of cells with DNA-damaging agents occurs in an ATM- and ATR-dependent manner (18van Vugt M.A. Smits V.A. Klompmaker R. Medema R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41656-41660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Because ATR was recently shown to be the relevant kinase that enforced the topoisomerase II-dependent G2 checkpoint (4Deming P.B. Cistulli C.A. Zhao H. Graves P.R. Piwnica-Worms H. Paules R.S. Downes C.S. Kaufmann W.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12044-12049Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), we next investigated whether ICRF-193-induced inhibition of Plk1 activity was mediated by ATR. AT cells have been previously shown to display a normal G2 checkpoint response to ICRF-193 (4Deming P.B. Cistulli C.A. Zhao H. Graves P.R. Piwnica-Worms H. Paules R.S. Downes C.S. Kaufmann W.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12044-12049Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Therefore, as expected, the inhibition of Plk1 activity observed after treatment with ICRF-193 was independent of ATM signaling (Fig.2, top panel). AT cells (GM03395) treated with ICRF-193 displayed an ICRF-193-induced inhibition of Plk1 kinase activity (57% of Me2SO control) (Fig. 2, top panel). The ICRF-193-induced inhibition of Plk1 activity observed in NHF1-hTERT cells was reversed in the presence of 2 mm caffeine, an inhibitor of ATM and ATR (data not shown). Taken together, these observations implied that regulation of Plk1 activity during the topoisomerase II-dependent checkpoint was ATR-dependent. To determine directly whether ATR mediates the ICRF-193-induced inhibition of Plk1 activity, Plk1 kinase assays were performed in GM847 fibroblasts containing an inducible kinase-inactive ATR allele (ATRki). Treatment of non-induced GM847 fibroblasts with ICRF-193 caused a significant inhibition in Plk-1 kinase (63% of control) (Fig. 2, bottom panel). However, cells induced to overexpress ATRkifailed to display the ICRF-193-induced inhibition of Plk1 activity (Fig. 2, bottom panel). Like mitotic entry, Plk1 activity was inhibited in an ATR-dependent manner by the topoisomerase II-dependent checkpoint response. Plk1 is activated by phosphorylation on serine and threonine residues that lie within a conserved activation loop (17Smits V.A. Klompmaker R. Arnaud L. Rijksen G. Nigg E.A. Medema R.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Mutation of Thr-210 (T210D) or both Thr-210 and Ser-137 to aspartic acid (TDSD) to mimic phosphorylation has been reported to result in constitutive activation of Plk1 (17Smits V.A. Klompmaker R. Arnaud L. Rijksen G. Nigg E.A. Medema R.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Overexpression of these alleles in U20S cells reversed the DNA damage-induced mitotic delay, which implied that Plk1 is a target of the DNA damage checkpoint (17Smits V.A. Klompmaker R. Arnaud L. Rijksen G. Nigg E.A. Medema R.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). To demonstrate directly that regulation of Plk1 activity was required for ICRF-193-induced checkpoint function, we tested the ability of human cells overexpressing wild type or constitutively active Plk1 alleles to undergo an ICRF-193-induced mitotic delay. To circumvent the problem of G1 arrest due to the transfection protocol in NHF1-hTERT fibroblasts, HeLa cells lacking functional p53 were used for these experiments. These HeLa cells had previously been shown to respond to ICRF-193 with a mitotic delay similar to that seen in NHF1-hTERT cells (4Deming P.B. Cistulli C.A. Zhao H. Graves P.R. Piwnica-Worms H. Paules R.S. Downes C.S. Kaufmann W.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12044-12049Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were co-transfected with either Myc-tagged wild type Plk1, Myc-tagged constitutively active Plk1 (T210D or TDSD), or an empty vector plasmid (pBABE) together with a GFP-histone H2B fusion protein (Fig.3 A). The transfection efficiency was equivalent between alleles and varied from 12 to 20% between experiments. This is illustrated by the low signal of Myc-tagged Plk1 compared with the endogenous Plk1 observed on the immunoblot from total HeLa cell extracts (Fig. 3 A). To account for the low transfection efficiency, only cells positive for GFP-H2B expression were examined for ICRF-193-induced mitotic delay. Treatment with ICRF-193 resulted in a 49% inhibition of mitosis in GFP-H2B-positive cells and a 40% inhibition of mitosis in GFP-H2B-positive cells expressing the wild type Plk-1 (Fig.3 B). GFP-H2B cells expressing the constitutively active Plk1 mutants (T210D or TDSD) displayed no inhibition of mitosis after treatment with ICRF-193 (98% of control and 105% of control, respectively) (Fig. 3 B). Thus, inhibition of Plk1 activity is required for the topoisomerase II-dependent checkpoint. One function of Plk1 is to phosphorylate cyclin B1 and promote its nuclear accumulation (26Toyoshima-Morimoto F. Taniguchi E. Shinya N. Iwamatsu A. Nishida E. Nature. 2001; 410: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that regulation of Plk1 activity during the checkpoint response to ICRF-193 controls the localization of cyclin B1-Cdk1 complexes by regulating the phosphorylation status of cyclin B1. To test whether treatment with ICRF-193 inhibits serine phosphorylation of cyclin B1 in vivo, cyclin B1 was immunoprecipitated from synchronized fibroblasts, then SDS-PAGE and immunoblots were performed using a phosphoserine antibody. As expected, serine phosphorylation on cyclin B1 was not observed in G2-phase cells but was present in mitotic control cells (Fig. 4 A). The serine phosphorylation on cyclin B1 was severely diminished in cells that experienced an IC"

To study the role of the sumoylation of TOP1, we mutated sites on green fluorescent protein (GFP)-TOP1 corresponding to the consensus sequence for protein sumoylation (ΨKXE, where Ψ is a hydrophobic residue) and assayed the mutants for basal and camptothecin-induced sumoylation. Only one of the eight mutants, K117R, located in the highly charged NH2-terminal region, showed a substantial reduction (∼5-fold) in basal and camptothecin-induced sumoylation; thus, Lys-117 appears to be the major sumoylation site. A triple mutant having the ΨKXE sequences flanking K117R additionally mutated (K103R/K117R/K153R) showed little if any sumoylation, but was degraded like wild-type GFP-TOP1 during camptothecin treatment. However, K103R/K117R/K153R-GFP-TOP1 was markedly concentrated within nucleoli, depleted from the remainder of nucleus, and failed to be cleared from nucleoli in response to camptothecin treatment. These data are consistent with a model wherein basal transient sumoylation of the NH2-terminal, highly charged, disordered region prevents TOP1 binding to sites in nucleoli, thus driving it to bind in the nucleoplasm; and camptothecin treatment, which increases TOP1 sumoylation, further shifts the binding resulting in delocalization of TOP1 from nucleoli to nucleoplasm.

CPT stabilizes the covalent TOP1-DNA intermediate by inhibiting the religation step of the DNA cleavage-religation mechanism. Previous studies have demonstrated that treatment of cells with CPT causes TOP1 to be hypersumoylated, ubiquitinated, and destroyed in proportion to the quantity of the covalent TOP1-DNA intermediate (1Beidler D.R.

In the case of TOP1, a putative low steady state level of sumoylation of TOP1 (<1%) has been observed in the absence of CPT treatment (1Beidler D.R. Cheng Y.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 907-914PubMed Google Scholar, 2Desai S.D. Liu L.F. Vazquez-Abad D. D'Arpa P. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5926-5932PubMed Google Scholar), which suggests that sumoylation of TOP1 may be important for regulating its activity, localization, or abundance under basal conditions.To explore the role of TOP1 sumoylation under basal conditions and in response to camptothecins, we used site-directed mutagenesis of sumoylation consensus sequences to identify sumoylation sites on TOP1. The major sumoylation site was identified to be Lys-117 in the amino-terminal region, as only this mutant (K117R) showed a reduction in both basal and CPT-induced sumoylation. A triple mutant with two sumoylation site mutations besides K117R (K103R/K117R/K153R) showed an even greater reduction in CPT-induced sumoylation. This triple mutant almost totally lacks sumoylation, although it was degraded similarly to wild-type GFP-TOP1 (WT-GFP-TOP1). Surprisingly, a striking difference in the localization of K103R/K117R/K153R-GFP-TOP1 was observed in comparison to WT-GFP-TOP1; K103R/K117R/K153R-GFP-TOP1 was much more highly concentrated in nucleoli, was less abundant in the remainder of the nucleus, and failed to delocalize from nucleoli upon CPT treatment.DISCUSSIONSumoylation of TOP1 and TOP2 increases within minutes after treatment of cells with drugs that specifically target the respective enzymes (2Desai S.D.

Basal sumoylation of endogenous TOP1 (i.e. without CPT treatment) has been observed in all the cell types we have analyzed and mainly consists of singly sumoylated TOP1, although a lesser abundance of doubly and triply sumoylated TOP1 is sometimes visible (e.g. see Fig. 3 A, compare WT (−) and (+) CPT; only mono- and di-sumoylated TOP1 are visible without CPT treatment). CPT treatment induces the sumoylation of TOP1 manyfold, and we and others have observed TOP1 with as many as six SUMO conjugates (2Desai S.D. Liu L.F. Vazquez-Abad D. D'Arpa P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24159-24164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 21Mao Y. Desai S.D. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26066-26073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).For both basal and CPT-induced sumoylation, the monomer is the most abundant, the dimer is less abundant, and so on with the abundance of multiply sumoylated forms being inversely proportional to the number of sumoylations (Fig. 3 and see Refs. 2Desai S.D. Liu L.F. Vazquez-Abad D. D'Arpa P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24159-24164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar and 21Mao Y. Desai S.D. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26066-26073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Here we have shown that within the highly charged amino-terminal region of TOP1, a conservative mutation of Lys-117 to Arg prevented the majority of both basal and CPT-induced sumoylation. However, residual sumoylations were observed on K117R-GFP-TOP1. To identify the sites of the residual sumoylations, the lysines of KXE sites flanking Lys-117 were additionally mutated. These double mutants, K103R/K117R-GFP-TOP1 and K117R/K153R-GFP-TOP1, exhibited significant residual sumoylation, and their partitioning between nucleoli and nucleoplasm was similar to WT-GFP-TOP1 and K117R-GFP-TOP1; they were also cleared from nucleoli during CPT treatment like WT-GFP-TOP1 and K117R-GFP-TOP1 (data not shown). Only the triple mutant, K103R/K117R/K153R-GFP-TOP1, which showed very little sumoylation, was found to be concentrated in nucleoli and depleted from nucleoplasm. None of the single mutants, except K117R, nor any of the double mutants having wild-type Lys-117 showed a detectable reduction in sumoylation. These results suggest that Lys-117 is the major sumoylation site on TOP1, and that the sumoylation of the sites flanking Lys-117 is sufficient to enable TOP1 to be cleared from nucleoli in response to CPT and to prevent the accumulation of TOP1 in nucleoli under basal conditions.Mutation of only a single lysine (Lys-117) eliminated the majority of sumoylated TOP1 despite the fact that up to six SUMO molecules have been seen attached to TOP1 (2Desai S.D. Liu L.F. Vazquez-Abad D. D'Arpa P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24159-24164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 20Mao Y. Sun M. Desai S.D. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4046-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). These observations can be explained by more than one model. First, the KXE sites may be differentially favored for sumoylation and de-sumoylation. If Lys-117 is the most favored sumoylation site with respect to its steady state sumoylation, it could account for the majority of mono-sumoylated TOP1. One of the sumoylation sites flanking Lys-117, either Lys-103 or Lys-153 may be the next favored; thus, sumoylation of Lys-117 plus Lys-103 or sumoylation of Lys-117 plus Lys-153 may account for the majority of di-sumoylated TOP1. Because mono-sumoylated TOP1 is severalfold more abundant than di-sumoylated TOP1, reduced sumoylation may only be observable when Lys-117 is mutated. This model of multiple mono-sumoylations predicts that the abundance of mono-sumoylated K117R-GFP-TOP1 might be roughly similar to di-sumoylated WT-GFP-TOP1. Our data are roughly consistent with this model (see Fig. 3,A and B). Our data do not exclude the possibility of a SUMO chain attached at Lys-117. SUMO chains consisting of SUMO-2/3 or SUMO-1 have been observed in vitro (23Tatham M.H. Jaffray E. Vaughan O.A. Desterro J.M. Botting C.H. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. J. Biol.

Melchior F. Dejean A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2682-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), and a low abundance of apparently di-sumoylated HDAC4 has been observed in cells co-transfected with HDAC4 and SUMO-2 (23Tatham M.H. Jaffray E. Vaughan O.A. Desterro J.M. Botting C.H. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35368-35374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). For consistency with the chain model, it would be necessary to postulate that a chain forms on a less favorable lysine when Lys-117 is mutated to explain the multiple sumoylations still visible on K117R-GFP-TOP1. Currently, the multiple mono-sumoylation model appears to be most consistent with our experimental data and with the fact that single SUMO conjugates on four closely spaced (IVL)KXE sites have been mapped on Cdc3 (25Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Notably, using antibodies specific to SUMO-1 or SUMO-2/3, we and others have observed SUMO-2/3 and SUMO-1 conjugated to TOP1 (20Mao Y. Sun M. Desai S.D. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The close juxtaposition of multiple sumoylation sites on TOP1 (Lys-103, Lys-117, Lys-153) is similar to that found on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae septins Cdc3 (Lys-4, Lys-11, Lys-30, Lys-63) and Shs/Sep7 (Lys-426, Lys-437) (25Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), the cytomegalovirus protein IE2 (Lys-175, Lys-180) (26Hofmann H. Floss S. Stamminger T. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2510-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), HDAC1 (Lys-444, Lys-476) (27David G. Neptune M.A. DePinho R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23658-23663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and GRIP1 (Lys-731, Lys-788) (28Kotaja N. Karvonen U. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30283-30288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) (see Table I). Multiple closely spaced sumoylation sites may be a redundancy mechanism for ensuring sumoylation. In the case of TOP1, the closely spaced sumoylation sites may ensure sumoylation of the amino terminus, which is largely disordered (29Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7602-7608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and in cells may dynamically switch among conformational forms.Sumoylation and ubiquitination sites in close proximity or involving the same lysine have been previously reported and suggested to serve a co-regulatory function. For example, sumoylation of the ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase Mdm2 appears to modulate its self-ubiquitination and destruction and thus the ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of p53 (10Buschmann T. Fuchs S.Y. Lee C.G. Pan Z.Q. Ronai Z. Cell. 2000; 101: 753-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In the case of IκBα, sumoylation may compete with ubiquitination for the same acceptor site lysine (18Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). These examples prompted us to test the hypothesis that the sumoylation of TOP1 might somehow regulate its proteasome-dependent degradation. However, we did not detect a difference between the degradation of transfected WT- and K103R/K117R/K153R-GFP-TOP1 (Fig. 4 and Table III). We did find that the degradation of both WT- and K103R/K117R/K153R-GFP-TOP1 mimicked the degradation of the endogenous TOP1 in the cell lines tested. In conclusion, a near complete lack of sumoylation of TOP1 had no effect on the CPT-induced degradation of TOP1.Sumoylation has been shown to alter the cellular distribution of several proteins (11Duprez E. Saurin A.J. Desterro J.M. Lallemand-Breitenbach V. Howe K. Boddy M.N. Solomon E. de The H. Hay R.T. Freemont P.S. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 381-393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Matunis M.J., Wu, J.

In every cell type we have tested (at least 10), we identified putative sumoylated forms of endogenous TOP1 under basal conditions (i.e. in the absence of CPT treatment), albeit at markedly lower abundance than after CPT treatment. We also observed basal sumoylation on WT-GFP-TOP1, but these forms were significantly reduced on K117R-GFP-TOP1 and K103R/K117R/K153R-GFP-TOP1, indicating that a small fraction of TOP1 is normally sumoylated in the absence of CPT. Suggesting a role for basally sumoylated TOP1, WT-GFP-TOP1 and K103R/K117R/K153R-GFP-TOP1 distribute differently within the nucleus. WT-GFP-TOP1 distributes to both nucleoplasm and nucleoli similar to endogenous TOP1 immunostaining; in contrast, the K103R/K117R/K153R-GFP-TOP1 concentrates in nucleoli and is depleted from the nucleoplasm (Fig. 5,A and B). Interestingly, the single mutant K117R-GFP-TOP1 and the double mutants K103R/K117R-GFP-TOP1 and K117R/K153R-GFP-TOP1 localized similarly to WT-GFP-TOP1, which may be the consequence of their residual sumoylation. This result suggests that basally sumoylated TOP1, whose steady state levels are only ∼1%, plays a role in partitioning TOP1 between nucleoli and the nucleoplasm.TOP1 is well known to be cleared from nucleoli after CPT treatment (4Danks M.K. Garrett K.E. Marion R.C. Whipple D.O. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1664-1673PubMed Google Scholar, 5Buckwalter C.A. Lin A.H. Tanizawa A. Pommier Y.G. Cheng Y.C. Kaufmann S.H.

We found that TOP1 clears from nucleoli during CPT treatment in the presence of proteasome inhibitors, suggesting that relocalization to the nucleoplasm rather than degradation of nucleolar TOP1 is responsible for the clearing (data not shown). Recent studies have shown that CPT-induced nucleolar clearing of TOP1 correlated with changes in total protein sumoylation and TOP1 sumoylation, which were experimentally varied by heat shock or the expression of wild-type or dominant negative Ubc9 (7Mo Y.Y., Yu, Y. Shen Z. Beck W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2958-2964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Here we have shown that WT-GFP-TOP1 is cleared from nucleoli within 5 min of CPT treatment, and its distribution within the nucleoplasm remained unchanged up to the longest CPT treatment time (60 min). After CPT treatment, WT-GFP-TOP1 localized to perinucleolar structures as have been previously observed (31Christensen M.O. Barthelmes H.U. Feineis S. Knudsen B.R. Andersen A.H. Boege F. Mielke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15661-15665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In contrast, K103R/K117R/K153R-GFP-TOP1 failed to clear from the nucleoli even after 60 min of CPT treatment (Fig. 5, A andB). K103R/K117R/K153R-GFP-TOP1 also failed to clear from nucleoli following treatment with 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside or actinomycin D, which caused endogenous TOP1 and WT-GFP-TOP1 to rapidly clear from nucleoli (data not shown). Thus, these results suggest that sumoylation of TOP1 is required for its clearing from nucleoli during exposure to CPT, 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside, or actinomycin D.The major sumoylation sites were found on the amino-terminal region of TOP1. The amino-terminal region of TOP1 has several notable features indicating an important role in regulating the cellular localization of TOP1. First, it contains the nuclear localization signals. Second, it contains the nucleolin binding site (32Bharti A.K. Olson M.O. Kufe D.W. Rubin E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1993-1997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and inSaccharomyces, the nucleolin ortholog, Nsr1p, physically interacts with yeast TOP1; and null mutants of NSR1 exhibited altered localization of TOP1 (33Edwards T.K.

Finally, the NH2-terminal region per se fused to GFP has been shown to concentrate in nucleoli and to clear from nucleoli in response to CPT (7Mo Y.Y., Yu, Y. Shen Z. Beck W.T. J. Biol.

We have also found that CPT-induced clearing of WT-GFP-TOP1 was not changed after mutagenizing the active site tyrosine to phenylalanine (data not shown). Together these results suggest that the major reason TOP1 clears from nucleoli during CPT treatment is not a result of slower nucleoplasmic versus nucleolar mobility resulting from preferential nucleoplasmic formation of the TOP1-DNA covalent intermediate as recently suggested (31Christensen M.O.

Basic stretches of amino acids have been identified as elements that may mediate nucleolar retention of proteins through interaction with polyanions (39van Eenennaam H. van der Heijden A. Janssen R.J. van Venrooij W.J. Pruijn G.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3680-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and in the case of TOP1, the 120 amino acids centered about Lys-117 are 35% Lys and Arg (28% Asp and Glu). It is possible that SUMO conjugates may disrupt this highly charged region, effectively dislodging TOP1 from binding sites in nucleoli and enabling a large part to continuously partition into the nucleoplasm under basal conditions. CPT treatment may cause an equilibrium shift toward lesser nucleolar retention and greater nucleoplasmic localization because of its known effect of increasing TOP1 sumoylation.Whether cancer cells can exploit the sumoylation-dependent partitioning of TOP1 to evade the cytotoxic effects of CPT requires further investigation. Topoisomerase I (TOP1)1is the molecular target of the camptothecin (CPT) class of cancer chemotherapeutics. CPT stabilizes the covalent TOP1-DNA intermediate by inhibiting the religation step of the DNA cleavage-religation mechanism. Previous studies have demonstrated that treatment of cells with CPT causes TOP1 to be hypersumoylated, ubiquitinated, and destroyed in proportion to the quantity of the covalent TOP1-DNA intermediate (1Beidler D.R.

To explore the role of TOP1 sumoylation under basal conditions and in response to camptothecins, we used site-directed mutagenesis of sumoylation consensus sequences to identify sumoylation sites on TOP1. The major sumoylation site was identified to be Lys-117 in the amino-terminal region, as only this mutant (K117R) showed a reduction in both basal and CPT-induced sumoylation. A triple mutant with two sumoylation site mutations besides K117R (K103R/K117R/K153R) showed an even greater reduction in CPT-induced sumoylation. This triple mutant"

Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1975; 26: 56-72Crossref Google Scholar). Seed proteins also play an important role in human and animal nutrition by providing the major share of dietary protein. These proteins may be classified as storage, structural, and biologically active proteins (2Fukusima D. Food Rev. Int. 1991; 7: 323-351Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The major biologically active proteins include lectins, enzymes, and enzyme inhibitors (e.g. trypsin inhibitor (TI)1). Many plant storage organs such as seeds and tubers contain from 1 to >10% of their soluble proteins as TIs. Besides their storage function, TIs have been ascribed other functional roles, such as regulating endogenous plant proteinases to prevent precocious germination, inhibiting trypsin during passage through an animal's gut, thus helping in seed dispersal, and protecting plants against pests and diseases (3Laskowski Jr., M. Kato I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 593-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar, 4Ryan C.A. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1990; 28: 425-449Crossref Google Scholar, 5Hou W.C. Lin J.S. Chen H.J.

Physiol. 2000; 47: 186-190Google Scholar). Their presence in major grain crops like cereals, legumes, and oil seeds, has nutritional and clinical implications and importance of their structure-function relationships has made TIs the subject of extensive studies (3Laskowski Jr., M. Kato I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 593-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar, 7Ussuf K.K. Laxmi N.H. Mitra R. Curr. Sci. 2001; 80: 847-853Google Scholar). Despite wide diversity, some TIs share sequence homology with seed storage proteins (8Odani S. Koide T. Ono T.C. Biochem. J. 1983; 213: 543-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Proteinase inhibitors and many seed storage proteins are encoded by families of polymorphic genes that probably arose by a complicated process of gene duplication, DNA exchange, and exon reshuffling (9Shewry P.R. Napier J.A. Tatham A.S. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 945-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Like many other seed proteins, TIs are synthesized as larger precursor proteins. After cotranslational cleavage of the signal (pre)peptide in the endoplasmic reticulum, they undergo limited proteolytic processing in vacuoles. Here short propeptides (N-terminal, internal, and C-terminal sequences) are cleaved off. Final assembly and deposition of the mature inhibitor take place in compartmentalized storage organelles along with inactive storage proteins (10Muntz K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 77-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Van Driessche E. Adv. Lectin Res. 1988; 1: 73-134Crossref Google Scholar). Some TIs, like that from Acacia confusa, are equally active both in the single polypeptide precursor form and the two-subunit mature form (12Hung C.H. Lee M.C. Lin M.T. Lin J.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 127: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A more interesting variation is the proteolytic processing of a large precursor to several different mature proteins, as occurs with both TIs and storage proteins (13Heath R.L. Barton P.A. Simpson R.J. Reid G.E. Lim G. Anderson M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 250-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 14Yamada K. Shimada T. Kondo M. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2563-2570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In previously reported cases, it is always the processed protein that is active as TI, whereas the precursors are either inactive or weakly active. There is controversy about the processing proteases and recognized amino acid sequence motif in seed proteins. The propeptide cleavage site is reported to have an Asn (or Asp) residue and a GP motif at or near the cleavage site (10Muntz K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 77-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Muren E., Ek, B. Bjork I. Rask L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 214-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 16Krebbers E. Herdies L. DeClercq A. Seurinck J. Leemans J. Van Damme J. Sengura M. Gheysen G. Van Montagu M. Vanderckhove J. Plant Physiol. 1988; 87: 859-866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, our sequence analysis showed that although GP is present in the 2S protein precursors of many plants, it is not present in all processing sites (e.g. Brassica juncea, Brassica carinata, and Brazil nut) (17Dasgupta J. Dasgupta S. Ghosh S. Roy B. Mandal R.K. Ind. J. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 32: 378-384PubMed Google Scholar, 18Mandal S. Mandal R.K. Curr. Sci. 2000; 79: 576-589Google Scholar). A number of different low molecular weight, single polypeptide TIs have been isolated and characterized from plants belonging to the Cruciferae (Brassicaceae) family (19Menegatti E. Tedeschi G.

On the other hand, TIs from Spergula arvensis (23Svendsen I. Nikolova D. Goshev I. Genov N. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1994; 43: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) andBrassica nigra (24Genov N. Goshev I. Nikolova D. Georgieva D.N. Filippi B. Svendsen I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1341: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) are larger proteins composed of 9- and 4-kDa subunits, lack chymotrypsin inhibitor activity, and are similar to the napin family 2S albumin in amino acid sequence. In all of these crucifers, the processed protein is the inhibitor. We have previously cloned and sequenced the 2S seed storage protein genes and their promoters from several Brassica species (17Dasgupta J. Dasgupta S. Ghosh S. Roy B. Mandal R.K. Ind. J. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 32: 378-384PubMed Google Scholar,25Dasgupta S. Mandal R.K. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 133: 301-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Comparing the amino acid sequences predicted by most of these cloned genes showed the sequence GPFRI, homologous to the TI active site motifs SPFRI and SPYRI in soybean Kunitz TIs (26Kim S. Hara S. Hase S. Ikenaka T. Toda H. Kitamura K. Kaizuma N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 98: 435-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Here we report a novel TI from the Indian mustard B. juncea (BjTI), which is the precursor of a seed storage protein. BjTI is active in the precursor form and after being processed is converted to the inactive 2S seed storage albumin with simultaneous loss of TI activity. In the mustard plant, the protein is produced in the precursor form during the midmaturation stage of seed development. This inhibitor imparts resistance to the developing seeds in the field. As the seeds mature, the inhibitor is naturally processed to the inactive seed storage protein, which is safe for human and animal consumption. This unique feature not only opens up a new field of interesting study but also presents several potential applications in crop improvement. TheB. juncea seeds, which normally express the TI, are naturally resistant to caterpillars and other insects. As the precursor of a seed storage protein, BjTI is expressed only in the seeds, not in any other plant part. Thus, it does not provide protection to the whole plant against insects, which feed on the vegetative parts. The coding sequence of BjTI was therefore introduced under a constitutive promoter for transgenic expression in tobacco and tomato plants, so that TI was expressed in all of the vegetative parts as well as the seeds. This gave highly significant protection against the major insect pestSpodoptera litura. One g of B. juncea midmaturation stage seeds (28 DAF) was pulverized in the presence of liquid nitrogen, mixed with 20 ml of phosphate buffer (10 mm, pH 7.2), and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 15 min. The clear light green extract was heat-treated at 70 °C for 5 min, recentrifuged to collect supernatant, and kept at 4 °C for 4 h. Part of the globulin protein precipitated here and was discarded after centrifugation. The final solution was vacuum-concentrated at low temperature to 2 ml and fractionated on a Biogel P-60 column (bed volume 70 ml; Bio-Rad), previously equilibrated with 10 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 50 mm NaCl. A 0.8-ml aliquot of the concentrated extract was loaded onto the column and eluted with the same buffer at 15 ml/h. Fractions (75 × 1 ml) were collected, and the protein was estimated using Lowry's method and OD at 280 nm. The peaks were assayed for TI activity (see below); the second small protein peak showed activity and was pooled and further purified on a carboxymethyl (CM)-cellulose column. Protein was bound to the column at low salt and eluted in a gradient of increasing (0–0.55m NaCl) salt concentration. Fractions showing positive TI activity and a 20-kDa band on SDS-PAGE were pooled. A reaction mixture of 400 μl containing 1 μg of trypsin (bovine trypsin; Sigma), varying amounts of BjTI (0.25–1.0 μg; volume adjusted to 100 μl with water), and 3 mg of azocasein (Sigma) in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris, 5 mmCaCl2, pH 8.0) was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The reaction was stopped with 400 μl of cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, incubated in ice for 10 min, and centrifuged at 30,000 ×g for 10 min. To the supernatant, an equal volume of 0.5m NaOH was added, and the A 428 was taken (27Gatehouse A.M.R. Gatehouse J.A. Boulter D. Phytochemistry (Oxf.). 1980; 19: 951-956Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). One unit of trypsin was arbitrarily defined as the amount that increased A 428 by 0.01 under the assay conditions. One unit of TI was defined as the amount that inhibited one unit of trypsin. To measure the inhibition of amidolytic activity of trypsin by BjTI, 1 μg of trypsin and TAME (2.5–10 mm) were incubated with 0, 200, and 300 ng of BjTI, and the rate of reaction was measured by recording A 247 (28Castellino F.J. Sodetz J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). One unit of trypsin was again arbitrarily defined as the amount that increased absorbance by 0.01/min. Trypsin inhibitory units were calculated from the number of trypsin units inhibited under similar conditions. Purified BjTI (10 μg) was incubated with seed extract of different developmental stages containing 12 μg of protein in 150 mm NaCl and 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) in a total reaction volume of 20 μl at 37 °C for different durations. The reaction mix was analyzed by SDS-PAGE or native PAGE. The XhoI-NotI fragment from pBSKS+:2S was cloned into the E. coliexpression vector pET 28a+ (Novagen) cut at the SalI andNotI sites. The resulting clones showed in-frame expression of the Bj2S sequence with His tag and T7 tag, confirmed by in vitro transcription and translation. The clones were transferred into a Bl21DE3pLysS E. coli host for overexpression. Overexpression and purification were carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol (pET system manual; Novagen). The Bj2Sc coding sequence from plasmid Bluescript KS+:2S was digested withKpnI and XbaI and cloned into the same sites of pGEM3Zf− vector. The resulting clone (pGEM3Zf−:2S) was used for in vitro mutagenesis using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, following the manufacturer's protocol. The Mn1 mutant (Asp37 → Glu and Gly40 → Ser) was generated using sense (5′-acagaatcagccagcccatttaggatt-3′) and antisense (5′-tgtcttagtcggtcgggtaaatcctaa-3′) primer sets in which the nucleotides C111 and G118 were changed to A111 and A118. The Mn2 (Pro41 → Cys and Phe42 → Pro) mutant was generated using sense (5′-acagactcagccggctgcccaaggatt-3′) and antisense (5′-tgtctgagtcggccgacgggttcctaa-3′) primer sets in which nucleotides C121, C122, A123, T124, T125, and T126 were changed to TGCCCA. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. About 1 μg of purified DNA was used in an in vitro coupled transcription-translation reaction using TNT-T7 QuickCoupled rabbit reticulocyte system (Promega). To 25 μl of reaction volume 20 μl of lysate mix and 10 μCi of [35S]methionine were added. Two μl of this reaction mix was used in subsequent processing experiments. The labeled pre-2S was incubated with midmature B. juncea seed extract containing 10 μg of protein in a reaction volume of 20 μl containing 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and 150 mm NaCl. Incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 2 h, and the whole reaction mix was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. The Bj2Sc sequence, initially cloned between theXhoI and XbaI sites in plasmid Bluescript KS+ (pBSKS+), was subcloned into the same sites in pKYLX7.1 vector (29Schardl C. Byard A.D. Benzion G. Altschuter M. Hildebrand D.F. Hunt A.G. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 61: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) having CaMV 35S promoter with duplicated enhancer (30Mogen B.D. McDonald M.H. Graybosch R. Hunt A.G. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 1261-1272PubMed Google Scholar). The pKYLX7.1:2S construct was mobilized into Agrobacterium tumifaciens (LBA4404) by triparental mating. Seeds of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum var. SR1), initially obtained from the Department of Agronomy, University of Kentucky (Lexington, KY), and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum var. Pusa Ruby) were surface-sterilized and germinated on Murashige and Skoog basal medium. Mature leaf discs of tobacco and cotyledonary explants of tomato were transformed by the gene constructs essentially according to the methods of Schardl et al. (29Schardl C. Byard A.D. Benzion G. Altschuter M. Hildebrand D.F. Hunt A.G. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 61: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and Fillati et al. (31Fillati J.J. Kiser J. Rose R. Comai L. Bio/Technology. 1987; 5: 726-730Crossref Scopus (396) Google Scholar), respectively. After treatment with agrobacterium, explants were transferred onto Murashige and Skoog medium with 3 mg/liter 6-benzylaminopurine and 1 mg/liter indole acetic acid. The transformed plantlets were selected in presence of 500 mg/liter cefotaxime and kanamycin (300 mg/liter for tobacco and 50 mg/liter for tomato). The transformed regenerated shoots were rooted on hormone-free Murashige and Skoog medium containing cefotaxime and kanamycin. The plants were grown in tissue culture rooms at 25 °C and 16-h light/8-h dark cycles. After several cycles of selection in kanamycin medium, the plants were potted and self-pollinated for successive generations. Total plant DNA was isolated from leaves by the method of Draper and Scott (32Draper J. Scott R. Plant Genetic Transformation and Gene Expression: A Laboratory Manual. Blackwell Scientific Publications, London1988: 199-236Google Scholar). PCR was done using 30-nucleotide primers corresponding to the 5′- and 3′-ends of the BJ2Sc gene (5′-atggcggacaagctcttcctcgtctcggca-3′) and (5′-ctagtaggagggcccaggcatggtcttctg-3′). Total plant RNA was isolated from leaf tissue by the acid guanidium thiocyanate-phenol/chloroform method. The radiolabeled probe was prepared by random-primed oligolabeling of DNA. For Western blot analysis, total leaf protein was prepared in phosphate-buffered saline. Forty μg of the leaf protein was separated on 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Polyclonal antiserum raised in rabbit against purified 2S protein was used as the primary antibody. The secondary antibody was goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma). The assay was done as described above. The total protein of the leaf extracts was quantified using the Bradford method. Then approximately similar amounts of leaf protein (120–150 μg) had their volumes adjusted to 100 μl with water. The percentage of total soluble leaf protein as BjTI was calculated for each sample from a standard curve of SBTI, assuming SBTI (181 amino acids) and BjTI (178 amino acids) to be of the same molecular mass. A ΔA 428 value of 0.226 was found to be equivalent to 1.0 μg of SBTI from the standard curve. Rearing of S. litura larvae in the laboratory was started with an egg mass to get a synchronous culture that was maintained for three generations (33Mandal S. Mandal R.K. Sci. Cult. 1999; 65: 169-171Google Scholar). The optimum temperature for the feeding experiments was found to be 22 °C, which gave a sufficiently slow growth rate to measure weight at intervals (34Mandal S. Mandal R.K. Environ. Ecol. 2000; 18: 177-180Google Scholar). The leaves of transgenic plants were given as food to the first, second, and third instar larvae. For each sample, 30 insects (three sets of 10 insects each) were placed separately and fed with leaves of transgenic lines to be tested, and several sets were kept as control. The larvae were weighed on alternate days, and the number of deaths and any abnormalities in development were recorded. The trypsin inhibitor was purified from midmature (28 DAF)B. juncea seeds by a combination of gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography. The elution profile of seed extract from the Biogel P-60 column (Fig. 1 A) showed three peaks (I, II, and III). SDS-PAGE analysis showed that peak I consisted of 12S globulins (cruciferins) giving five major bands (Fig. 1 C, lane 2); peak II consisted of a 20-kDa major band contaminated with 12S and 2S protein (Fig.1 C, lane 3); and peak III consisted of 9- and 4-kDa subunits of 2S protein (Fig. 1 C,lane 4). The trypsin-inhibitory activity of each of these fractions was assayed by azocasein hydrolysis. The middle peak (II) showed TI activity, whereas peaks I and III did not, even when up to 30-fold more protein was added compared with peak II. To further purify this 20-kDa TI, the fractions of peak II were pooled and subjected to CM-cellulose ion exchange column chromatography. In this elution profile, the purified TI was found in the first peak (Fig.1 B, peak I) eluted with 0.1m NaCl, whereas the second peak (II) had the contaminants. This novel 20-kDa TI was named B. juncea TI or BjTI (Fig.1 C, lane 5). The TI activity of BjTI was assayed using both azocasein and the synthetic substrate TAME. Trypsin (5 μg) was incubated with varying amounts of BjTI according to protocol and assayed for residual TI activity. By plotting the residual activity against the amount of inhibitor used and extrapolating the linear part of the curve to 0% residual trypsin activity, it was found that 4.2 μg of BjTI was needed to completely inhibit the enzyme activity of 5 μg of trypsin (Fig. 2 A). Since the crystalline bovine trypsin used was >98% pure and considering theM r of bovine trypsin to be 24 kDa and that of BjTI to be 20 kDa, the values correspond to a molar ratio of 1:1 for the trypsin and inhibitor complex. The stability of BjTI was studied by exposing it to altered conditions of pH, temperature, and protein-denaturing agents like urea and SDS and measuring the residual inhibitor activity. The results (presented as supplementary data; supplemental Tables II, III, and IV) showed BjTI to be stable over a wide pH range (pH 3.0–12.0; supplemental Table II) and to retain at least 70% activity after being heated to 80 °C for 10 min, losing significant activity only at 90 °C (supplemental Table III). Similarly, it retained 90% activity after treatment with 8m urea or 1% SDS for 1 h (supplemental Table IV). It had no free SH groups, as assayed by 5,5′-dithio-bis-2-nitrobenzoic acid, but it contained four pairs of Cys residues, forming disulfide (-S-S-) linkages. It also lacks chymotrypsin or amylase inhibitory activity. From the molecular weight and the absence of chymotrypsin inhibitor activity, BjTI may be included in the Kunitz family of TIs. The kinetics of BjTI were studied by the extent of inhibition of amydolitic activity of trypsin in the presence of two different inhibitor concentrations and varying concentrations of the synthetic substrate, TAME. The Lineweaver-Burk plot of these data showed that theK m changed with increasing amount of the inhibitor with a K i value of 6.4 × 10−10m, as determined from Fig. 2 B. Several experiments were carried out with the purified BjTI and the 2S seed storage protein gene (Bj2Sc sequence), some of which indicated, while others conclusively proved, that BjTI is not only a novel TI but is also the precursor of the inactive 2S seed storage protein. The purified BjTI from B. juncea seeds was subjected to proteolytic processing in vitro by incubation with maturing mustard seed extract, which contains the processing enzyme(s). With increasing time of incubation, more and more BjTI was processed to the mature 2S subunits (Fig. 3 A,lanes 3–7). The processing activity was lost when the seed extract was heated in boiling water bath for 5 min (Fig.3 A, lane 8). This in vitrostudy indicates that BjTI is the precursor of 2S protein. The loss of TI activity upon processing indicates that the TI active site amino acid residues reside at or near the peptide processing site. The levels of BjTI and processing activity changed with the developmental age (days after flowering) of mustard seeds. Since mustard flowers are of indeterminate type, they were tagged on the day of complete opening, and seeds were harvested on the 7th and 10th DAF and at 5-day intervals thereafter, and the mature seeds were finally harvested on the 50th day. Crude protein extracts from these seeds were assayed for TI activity, and results were expressed as arbitrary TI units. TI activity could be detected as early as 7 DAF and increased up to 35 DAF, rapidly declining thereafter (Fig. 3 B). However, a low level, about one-fifth of the highest activity, persisted in the harvested dry seeds. To check the levels of pre-2S (or BjTI) processing enzyme(s) during the course of seed development, fixed amounts of BjTI were incubated with protein extract made from seeds collected at 15, 21, and 28 DAF, and the products were separated by nondenaturing PAGE. The results showed that 15 DAF seeds already contained an appreciable amount of processing enzyme(s) (Fig. 3 C, lane 3). The level increased with the developmental age of the seeds (lanes 4–6) and was highest in the 28 DAF extract (lane 7). A low but detectable amount of processing enzyme(s) was present in the harvested dry seed extract. Thus, the biosynthesis of BjTI and its processing enzyme(s) occur in parallel. This pattern matches the synthesis and accumulation of 2S storage proteins, well studied in other Brassica seeds in this (35Dasgupta S. Mandal R.K. Seed Sci. Technol. 1993; 21: 291-299Google Scholar) and other laboratories. These in vivo studies indicated that BjTI is the precursor of 2S seed storage protein. We have previously cloned the B. juncea 2S protein gene (Bj2Sc; GenBankTM accession number X65972). To prove conclusively that BjTI is the precursor of B. juncea 2S albumin, we cloned the 2S coding sequence (Bj2Sc) into the expression vector pET 28a+. The clones were tested by in vitro coupled transcription and translation with [35S]methionine, and the product of the expected molecular weight was obtained (supplemental Fig. 7). The bacterially expressed precursor of 2S was purified as an ∼24-kDa tagged protein (supplemental Fig. 8). The purified precursor and the induced cell extract were assayed in vitro for TI activity using azocasein as substrate for trypsin. The expressed precursor was found to inhibit trypsin at a 1:1 molar ratio, like the native BjTI purified from B. juncea seeds. This conclusively proved that BjTI is the precursor of B. juncea 2S seed storage protein. For in vitro processing experiments with in vitro translated precursor of 2S, the Bj2Sc sequence was cloned into the pGEM3Zf− vector. In vitrotranscription and translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate of pGEM3Zf−:2S in the presence of [35S]Met yielded the expected 20-kDa product. For processing studies, the radiolabeled precursor of 2S was incubated for 120 min in PBS alone as control and also in 28 DAF B. juncea seed extract for 30 and 120 min. Whereas control incubation gave no processing (Fig.4 A, lane 1), some processing was observed after 30-min incubation with seed extract (lane 2), and processing was almost complete by 120 min (lane 3). From earlier studies, it is known that processing enzymes for seed storage protein precursors are seed tissue-specific but not species-specific (36Muren E., Ek, B. Rask L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In the present study, the precursor of 2S protein purified as BjTI from B. juncea seeds was processedin vitro by B. juncea seed extract (Fig.4 A) but not by B. juncea leaf extract (results not presented). We next tested the processing of in vitrosynthesized radiolabeled BjTI protein with pea (Pisum sativum) seed extract and compared it with that with mustard seed extract. The results showed that precursor protein was processedin vitro into mature 2S subunits by extracts from pea seeds (Fig. 4 B, lane 3) similar to that by mustard seed (lane 1). Furthermore, the processing enzymes showed partial thermostability toward heating at 65 °C for 5 min (lanes 2 and4). Earlier publications reported the involvement of an Asn (or Asp) residue for recognition of the processing enzyme(s) and the presence of a GP motif near the processing site. However, our previous alignment studies did not support this notion (17Dasgupta J. Dasgupta S. Ghosh S. Roy B. Mandal R.K. Ind. J. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 32: 378-384PubMed Google Scholar, 18Mandal S. Mandal R.K. Curr. Sci. 2000; 79: 576-589Google Scholar)."

We have demonstrated that osteoblasts are sensitive to hyperglycemia-associated osmotic stress and respond to elevated extracellular glucose or mannitol by increasing c-jun and collagen I expression. To determine whether MAPKs are involved in this response, MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts were treated with 16.5 mm glucose, mannitol, or contrast dye for 1 h. Immunoblotting of phosphorylated p38 demonstrated activation of p38 MAPK by hyperosmotic stress in vitro andin vivo. Activation peaked at 20 min, remained detectable after 24 h, and was protein kinase C-independent. Activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2) activation followed the same pattern as phospho-p38. Transactivation of cAMP response element (CRE)- and c-jun promoter (containing a CRE-like element)-reporter constructs increased following hyperosmotic treatment. SB 203580 (a p38 MAPK inhibitor) blocked ATF-2 phosphorylation, CRE transactivation, and c-jun promoter activation. Hyperosmotic activation of collagen I promoter activity was also inhibited by SB 203580, consistent with the involvement of c-jun in collagen I up-regulation. Therefore, we propose that hyperglycemia-induced increases in p38 MAPK activity and ATF-2 phosphorylation contribute to CRE activation and modulation of c-jun and collagen I expression in osteoblasts.

Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1999; 112: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cellular responses to elevated extracellular glucose are thought to contribute to the development of diabetic complications. Hyperglycemic responses can differ greatly between cell types and can involve osmotic stress pathways. Immediate effects of a hyperosmotic response include cell shrinkage, followed by modulation of ion transporter activity (2Lytle C. Forbush III, B. Am. J.

Subsequently, in mammalian cells, genes encoding proteins involved in the accumulation of intracellular “compatible osmolytes” are induced within hours to days after exposure to hyperglycemia (5Kwon H.M.

In addition to well known complications such as neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (type I) is associated with decreased bone mass and increased risk of osteoporosis (11Bouillon R.

Osteoblasts undergo three stages of development/differentiation: proliferation, extracellular matrix deposition, and extracellular matrix maturation to form bone (20Quarles L.D. Yohay D.A. Lever L.W.

In diabetic bone, the number of fully mature osteoblasts is decreased (19Verhaeghe J. van Herck E. Visser W.J. Suiker A.M. Thomasset M. Einhorn T.A. Faierman E. Bouillon R.

This suggests that hyperglycemia can suppress osteoblast differentiation. When osteoblasts are exposed to elevated extracellular glucose or mannitol in vitro, a similar effect occurs and is marked by decreased extracellular mineralization (23Zayzafoon M. Stell C. Irwin R. McCabe L.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 79: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 24Balint E. Szabo P. Marshall C.F. Sprague S.M. Bone (N.

Biophys. 2000; 377: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Hyperglycemia-induced changes in osteoblast phenotype include up-regulation of collagen I and c-junmRNA expression (associated with early stages of osteoblast maturation) and down-regulation of osteocalcin expression (a marker of differentiated osteoblasts) (23Zayzafoon M. Stell C. Irwin R. McCabe L.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 79: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Promoters of c-jun, collagen I, and osteocalcin contain AP-1 transcription factor-binding sites. Therefore, it is not surprising that expression of a dominant-negative AP-1 fusion protein in osteoblasts suppresses glucose and mannitol effects on gene expression. 1M. Zayzafoon and L. R. McCabe, unpublished results. 1M. Zayzafoon and L. R. McCabe, unpublished results. This finding suggests that AP-1 member levels and activity are involved in osteoblast responsiveness to hyperglycemia and osmotic stress. The mechanisms accounting for osmotic stress-induced c-junexpression and AP-1 activity in osteoblasts are not completely understood. Inhibitor studies have demonstrated that protein kinase C is involved in these osmotic stress-induced effects (23Zayzafoon M. Stell C. Irwin R. McCabe L.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 79: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In other cell types, MAPKs2 have also been demonstrated to be involved in mediating cellular adaptive responses to osmotic stress (28Roger F. Martin P.Y. Rousselot M. Favre H. Feraille E. J. Biol.

Activation of MAPKs is known to modulate gene expression and, in particular, to activate and increase expression of c-Jun and AP-1 activities. This can occur through activation of JNK and p38, which phosphorylate c-Jun and ATF-2, respectively, and thereby increase transactivation at AP-1 and CRE-like (jun2TRE) (26Morooka H. Bonventre J.V. Pombo C.M. Kyriakis J.M. Force T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30084-30092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) sequences in the c-jun promoter. The MAPK signaling pathways have also been implicated in the regulation of osteoblast phenotype and gene expression (27Hipskind R.A. Bilbe G. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D804-D816Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that hyperosmotic stress caused by a physiologically relevant increase in extracellular glucose results in the specific activation of p38 MAPK and its downstream transcription factor, ATF-2. This activation is associated with an increase in CRE and c-jun promoter transactivation. SB 203580, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, inhibits ATF-2 phosphorylation, CRE and c-jun promoter transactivation, and collagen I transactivation. These results demonstrate that p38 MAPK is involved in osmotic stress-induced osteoblast phenotypic changes. MC3T3-E1 cells (35Sudo H. Kodama H.A. Amagai Y. Yamamoto S. Kasai S. J.

Eleven days after plating and 24 h after the last feeding, glucose or mannitol (0.5 m stock solution) or diatrizoate meglumine (a contrast dye and osmotic agent that is not a sugar; Nycomed Inc., Princeton, NJ) was added directly to the medium in the tissue culture dish to yield the final concentrations of sugar noted for each experiment (ranging up to 22 mm or 22 mosm).

Samples were subsequently processed for whole cell protein and Western blot analyses as described above. Osteoblasts (MC3T3-E1 cells) were plated at a concentration of 100,000 cells/well of a six-well dish. Twenty-four hours later, cells were transfected with luciferase or chloramphenicol transferase reporter plasmids driven by the c-jun promoter (−1600 to +170 bp; generously provide by Dr. P.

Five hours after transfection with a DNA/LipofectAMINE mixture (Invitrogen), 1 ml of 20% fetal bovine serum-supplemented α-minimal essential medium was added to the cells. Fifteen hours later, the medium was aspirated and replaced with fresh 10% fetal bovine serum-supplemented α-minimal essential medium. Twenty-four hours later, cells were subjected for 3 or 12 h to the indicated treatment and then harvested and lysed. Reporter activity was read immediately using a luciferase (Promega) or β-galactosidase (CLONTECH) assay system and a luminometer. Chloramphenicol transferase activity was measured as previously described (26Morooka H. Bonventre J.V. Pombo C.M. Kyriakis J.M. Force T. J. Biol.

All statistical analyses were performed using the Microsoft Excel data analysis program fort test analysis or the SPSS statistical analysis program for analysis of variance with Bonferroni's test. Experiments were repeated at least three times unless otherwise stated. Values are expressed as means ± S.E. except where indicated. We previously demonstrated (23Zayzafoon M. Stell C. Irwin R. McCabe L.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 79: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) that elevation of extracellular glucose or mannitol alters osteoblast gene expression, including c-jun and collagen I. Given the important role of MAPK in the regulation of transcription factor activities and gene expression, we examined the effect of treating osteoblasts with 16.5 mm extracellular sugar (to yield a final concentration of 22 mm sugar, as seen in uncontrolled diabetes) on activation of MAPK. Figs. 1 and 2demonstrate that total levels of p38, ERK, and JNK were unaltered after 1 h of sugar treatment. However, examination of active phosphorylated MAPK forms identified a 3–4-fold increase in phosphorylated p38 in response to elevated extracellular glucose or mannitol (Fig. 1, A and B), suggesting that osmotic stress stimulates the activity of this kinase. Because both glucose and mannitol are sugars, we tested another hyperosmotic compound that is not a sugar, contrast dye (diatrizoate meglumine). Fig. 1 C demonstrates that p38 was also activated by this additional osmotic agent. Activation of the p38 pathway was specific because increases in phosphorylation of JNK or ERK were not evident (Fig. 2). Under these conditions, positive controls (addition of 150 nm12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or 300 mmglucose) demonstrated that these kinases could be activated in osteoblasts.Figure 2Elevation of extracellular glucose does not influence ERK and JNK phosphorylation. Osteoblasts cultured for 11 days were treated with 16.5 mm glucose or mannitol to yield a final concentration of 22 mm. Cells were harvested 1 h after addition of sugar for whole cell protein extraction. Extracts (50 μg/lane) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Immunoblots were developed using specific antibodies directed against ERK1/2, JNK1/2, phosphorylated ERK1/2, or phosphorylated JNK1/2. The blot is representative of three experiments and contains extracts from osteoblasts treated with 5.5 mm glucose (control (C)), 22 mm glucose (G), and 5.5 mm glucose + 16.5 mm mannitol (M).TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our previous study demonstrated that protein kinase C is involved in osteoblast responses to osmotic stress (23Zayzafoon M. Stell C. Irwin R. McCabe L.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 79: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Given that some protein kinase C isoforms are able to activate p38, we examined the role of protein kinase C in the osmotic activation of p38. As shown in Fig.3, preincubation of osteoblasts with an inhibitor of protein kinase C (200 nm Ro 31-8220) did not block activation of p38. Similarly, preincubation with other protein kinase C inhibitors (50 μm staurosporine and 100 nm Go 6976) did not block osmotic activation of p38 (data not shown). These findings demonstrate that protein kinase C activity is not required for osmotic activation of p38. However, treatment with these inhibitors is sufficient to suppress c-jun and collagen I mRNA induction by osmotic stress (23Zayzafoon M. Stell C. Irwin R. McCabe L.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 79: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), suggesting that both pathways are activated in parallel and that both could be important for osteoblast responses to osmotic stress. Activated p38 is known to phosphorylate and activate ATF-2 (44Zhu T. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2103-2114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To determine whether elevation of extracellular glucose or mannitol enhances ATF-2 phosphorylation, Western blot analyses were performed using specific antibodies directed against ATF-2 and phosphorylated ATF-2. Fig. 4 demonstrates that although levels of ATF-2 remained constant, phosphorylation of ATF-2 (similar to p38) was clearly elevated 3–4-fold 1 h after hyperglycemic treatment. To examine the characteristics of p38 and ATF-2 phosphorylation in response to osmotic stress, a complete time course was performed with osteoblasts being harvested at 0, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 60 min. Fig.5 A shows that phosphorylation of p38 was evident at 10 min, plateaued by 20 min, and remained activated 60 min after glucose treatment. Phosphorylation of ATF-2 was evident within 20 min after glucose treatment; this was slower than phosphorylation of p38 and is consistent with ATF-2 as a downstream target of p38. The response after 24 h was also examined. Although p38 is considered to be a fast and transient-activated kinase, p38 stayed activated even 24 h after the onset of osmotic stress (Fig.5 B). As expected, ATF-2 also remained activated at 24 h. To determine whether the effect on p38 and ATF-2 phosphorylation was dose-dependent, osteoblasts were treated with 2, 4.5, 9.5, and 16.5 mm glucose (final concentrations equal to 7.5, 10, 15, and 22 mm glucose, respectively), and phosphorylated p38 and ATF-2 levels were examined 1 h after treatment by Western analysis. Remarkably, Fig. 6 demonstrates that addition of as little as 4.5 mm glucose was enough to increase p38 phosphorylation in osteoblasts. This level of glucose (10 mm final concentration, 180 mg/dl) is often seen in patients who are diagnosed with diabetes, and we have shown previously that c-jun expression is increased at this glucose concentration (23Zayzafoon M. Stell C. Irwin R. McCabe L.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 79: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To examine whether p38 could also be activated by hyperosmotic stressin vivo, mice were injected subcutaneously over the calvariae with vehicle or mannitol. This method has previously been used by others to examine osteoblast responsiveness to hormones (40McCauley L.K. Koh-Paige A.J. Chen H. Chen C. Ontiveros C. Irwin R. McCabe L.R. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1975-1981Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 41Dunstan C.R. Boyce R. Boyce B.F. Garrett I.R. Izbicka E. Burgess W.H. Mundy G.R. J. Bone Miner.

Metab. 1999; 17: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Fig. 7 demonstrates that phosphorylation of p38 was increased in mannitol-injected calvariae compared with controls. Correspondingly, ATF-2 phosphorylation was also increased (Fig. 7). Thus, our in vitro response was reproduced in vivo. SB 203580 (4-(fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)-1H-imidazole) is a known inhibitor of p38 activity (29Sheikh-Hamad D., Di Mari J.F. Suki W.N. Safirstein R. Watts III, B.A. Rouse D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1832-1837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). To determine the role of p38 in phosphorylation of ATF-2 in response to the extracellular sugar elevation, we treated osteoblasts with SB 203580 30 min prior to glucose treatment and examined responsiveness. Fig.8 A demonstrates that 10 μm SB 203580 (36Nadkarni V. Gabbay K.H. Bohren K.M. Sheikh-Hamad D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20185-20190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) pretreatment inhibited hyperglycemia-induced ATF-2 phosphorylation. This inhibition was dose-dependent and apparent at 5 μm (data not shown) and suggests that p38, rather than other kinases such as JNK, is important for hyperglycemic activation of ATF-2. To determine whether osmotic stress due to elevation of extracellular sugar can functionally influence transactivation of CRE, an enhancer element known to bind ATF-2, MC3T3-E1 cells were transfected with CRE-luciferase or cytomegalovirus-luciferase reporter constructs and treated with glucose or mannitol. Fig. 8 B demonstrates that increasing extracellular glucose or mannitol enhanced CRE transactivation >5-fold compared with the control cells. Cytomegalovirus-luciferase did not show any increase, demonstrating the specificity of the CRE induction (data not shown). To study the role of p38 in transactivation of CRE, we treated osteoblasts with 10 μm SB 203580 30 min prior to glucose treatment and examined responsiveness. Fig. 8 B demonstrates that inhibition of p38 was sufficient to abolish the CRE transactivation in response to elevated extracellular glucose. Inhibition of protein kinase B (Akt), a potential target of SB 203580, did not affect this response (data not shown). Because we have previously identified c-jun and collagen I as genes responsive to hyperglycemia, we also examined their promoter activities that contain AP-1 and CRE enhancer elements. As expected, glucose or mannitol treatment increased expression of both c-jun and collagen I reporters (Fig. 9). Furthermore, inhibition of p38 suppressed c-jun and collagen I promoter transactivation, but did not affect control cytomegalovirus-luciferase expression, demonstrating a critical role for p38 in this response. We have shown previously that osteoblasts respond to an elevation in extracellular glucose through an osmotic response pathway (23Zayzafoon M. Stell C. Irwin R. McCabe L.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 79: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The response to hyperglycemia involves induction of c-jun and collagen I expression and suppression of osteocalcin, consistent with suppression of a differentiated osteoblast phenotype. Our findings that mannitol treatment completely mimics this effect (23Zayzafoon M. Stell C. Irwin R. McCabe L.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 79: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and that glucose uptake is unaffected during this time1 suggest that the response is osmotic in nature. We have also demonstrated that this response involves protein kinase C activation (23Zayzafoon M. Stell C. Irwin R. McCabe L.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 79: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Here, we show that a MAPK pathway is also required for osteoblast responsiveness to hyperglycemia. Specifically, phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was increased 1 h after addition of 16.5 mm glucose or mannitolin vitro and in vivo. Activation of p38 following treatment of osteoblasts with contrast dye, a non-sugar osmotic agent, further demonstrated that this response is not sugar-related and results from increased hyperosmotic stress. This level of hyperosmolarity failed to activate the other MAPKs (ERK and JNK) in MC3T3-E1 cells. Osmotic activation of the p38 kinase pathway in osteoblasts is consistent with the role of this pathway in cellular responses to stress (45Dong C. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar, 46Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2079112933,"Low molecular weight phosphotyrosine phosphatase (LMW-PTP) is an enzyme involved in platelet-derived growth factor-induced mitogenesis and cytoskeleton rearrangement. Our previous results demonstrated that LMW-PTP is able to bind and dephosphorylate activated platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-r), thus inhibiting cell proliferation. Here we revisit the role of LMW-PTP on activated PDGF-r dephosphorylation. We demonstrate that LMW-PTP preferentially acts on cell surface PDGF-r, excluding the internalized activated receptor pool. Many phosphotyrosine phosphatases act by site-selective dephosphorylation on several sites of PDGF-r, but until now, there has been no evidence of a direct involvement of a specific phosphotyrosine phosphatase in the dephosphorylation of the 857 kinase domain activation tyrosine. Here we report that LMW-PTP affects the kinase activity of the receptor through the binding and dephosphorylation of Tyr-857 and influences many of the signal outputs from the receptor. In particular, we demonstrate a down-regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Src homology phosphatase-2, and phospholipase C-γ1 binding but not of MAPK activation. In addition, we report a slight action of LMW-PTP on Tyr-716, which directs MAPK activation through Grb2 binding. On the basis of these results, we propose a key role for LMW-PTP in PDGF-r down-regulation through the dephosphorylation of the activation loop Tyr-857, thus determining a general negative regulation of all downstream signals, with the exception of those elicited by internalized receptors.

This is emphasized by the fact that PDGF and its receptor are currently under investigation as targets in numerous proliferative disorders, including cancer and cardiovascular and fibrotic diseases (1Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3557) Google Scholar). Binding of PDGF to the extracellular domain of the receptor is thought to induce receptor dimerization, allowing transphosphorylation of adjacent dimerized receptors on specific tyrosine residues within the intracellular region (2Hubbard S.R. Till J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 373-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated tyrosines supply docking sites for recruitment of cytosolic signaling proteins with appropriate binding motifs. The cellular function of receptor-associated proteins is believed to be modified as a consequence of association with and phosphorylation by the receptor itself. Thus, ligand binding initiates intracellular signaling events involving the synthesis of second messenger molecules, activation of small G proteins, protein phosphorylation cascades, and, finally, gene transcription. All these signaling pathways are thought to mediate biological responses to PDGF through cell cycle progression (3Heldin C.H. Ostman A. Ronnstrand L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F79-F113PubMed Google Scholar). The systems used to fine-tune receptor-induced signaling and the full variety of the signaling potential of the receptor remain uncertain. It has been demonstrated that PDGF-r expression is down-regulated for the duration of the second phase of the cell cycle and during cell differentiation. In particular, PDGF-r down-regulation appears to be regulated at two stages: a short time level, which is thought to be played essentially by an immediate endocytosis of ligand-receptor complexes, and a long-term down-regulation reply, played by receptor degradation by ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (4Joazeiro C.A. Wing S.S. Huang H. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. Liu Y.C. Science. 1999; 286: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar) and by decline of PDGFβ-r mRNA expression. It is well established that receptor tyrosine kinases are negatively controlled by phosphotyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) (5Jallal B. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4357-4363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Sorby M. Ostman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10963-10966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of tyrosine kinase receptors by PTPs could be a more rapid system with respect to the elimination of activatable PDGF-r from the membrane by clathrin-mediated internalization and the decrease of PDGF-r molecules by ubiquitin-mediated or lysosomal proteolysis or mRNA repression (7Ostman A. Bohmer F.D. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 258-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). There is little in the literature about the role of PDGF-r dephosphorylation by PTPs, although many PTPs have been found to interact with the receptor. In particular, SHP-2 (8Qi J.H. Ito N. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14455-14463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), density-enhanced phosphatase-1 (9Kovalenko M. Denner K. Sandstrom J.

Raugei G. Camici G. Dolfi F. Berti A. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and CD45 (11Way B.A. Mooney R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26409-26415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been depicted to dephosphorylate the activated PDGF-r, although the real significance of this dephosphorylation is largely unclear. In fact, PTP action on tyrosine kinase receptors could lead either to a broad reduction of receptor signaling, by targeting to all receptor phosphotyrosines, or to a modulation of signaling, through site-selective dephosphorylation. LMW-PTPs are a group of 18-kDa enzymes that are widely expressed (12Chiarugi P. Fiaschi T. Taddei M.L. Talini D. Giannoni E. Raugei G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33478-33487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Previous studies on the molecular biology of LMW-PTP in NIH3T3 cells demonstrated a well-defined role of this enzyme in PDGF-induced mitogenesis, showing that activated PDGF-r is a substrate for LMW-PTP (10Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Raugei G. Camici G. Dolfi F. Berti A. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 13Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Marra F. Raugei G. Fiaschi T. Camici G. Manao G. Romanelli R.G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6776-6785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The most relevant phenotypic effect of LMW-PTP overexpression is a strong reduction of the cell growth rate in response to PDGF stimulation. More recently, we have found that in NIH3T3 cells, LMW-PTP is constitutively localized in both cytoplasmic and cytoskeleton-associated fractions. These two LMW-PTP pools are differentially regulated because only the cytoskeleton-associated LMW-PTP fraction is specifically phosphorylated by c-Src after PDGF stimulation (13Chiarugi P. Cirri P.

Cytoskeleton-associated LMW-PTP influences cell adhesion, spreading, and migration, controlling the phosphorylation level of p190Rho-GAP, a protein that is able to regulate Rho activity and, consequently, cytoskeleton rearrangement in response to PDGF stimulation. Hence, LMW-PTP is able to perform multiple functions in PDGF-induced mitogenesis: whereas cytosolic LMW-PTP binds and dephosphorylates PDGF-r, thus modulating part of its signaling cascade, cytoskeleton-associated LMW-PTP acts on phosphorylated p190Rho-GAP, consequently playing a role in PDGF-mediated cytoskeleton rearrangement (15Chiarugi P.

Recently, we demonstrated that during PDGF signaling, LMW-PTP is regulated by a redox mechanism involving the two cysteine residues of the catalytic site, which turn reversibly from the reduced to oxidized state after PDGF stimulation. The reversibility of in vivoLMW-PTP oxidation is glutathione-dependent (12Chiarugi P. Fiaschi T. Taddei M.L. Talini D. Giannoni E. Raugei G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33478-33487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The additional catalytic pocket Cys-17 retains an intriguing and peculiar role in the formation of a S-S intramolecular bond, which protects the catalytic Cys-12 from further and irreversible oxidation. The presence of an additional cysteine near the catalytic one confers upon LMW-PTP the ability to rapidly recover its activity and finely regulate PDGF receptor activation. In this study, we revisit the role of LMW-PTP in PDGF-r down-regulation, demonstrating that it acts as a real termination signal for receptor activation because it dephosphorylates the PDGF-r-regulatory tyrosine (Tyr-857), thus determining a general negative regulation of all downstream signals, with the exception of those elicited by internalized receptors.

NIH3T3 or HepG2 cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. 10 μg of pRcCMV-C12S-LMW-PTP (expressing the dominant negative Cys-12 to Ser mutant of LMW-PTP) were transfected in NIH3T3 cells using the calcium phosphate method. Stable transfected clonal cell lines were isolated by selection with G418 (400 μg/ml). Mock-transfected cell lines were obtained by transfecting 2 μg of pRcCMVneo alone. The clonal cell lines were screened for expression of the transfected genes by (a) Northern blot analysis and (b) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using polyclonal anti-LMW-PTP rabbit antibodies. 1 × 106 cells were seeded in 10-cm plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum.

The cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with trypsin (1 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) in ice for 30 min with occasional rocking. The reaction was stopped by the addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor (1 mg/ml). Cells were then washed and solubilized in lysis buffer for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-PDGF-r antibodies and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The trypsin-resistant 190-kDa PDGF-r is the internalized receptor. The total PDGF-r amount was evaluated in parallel in non-trypsinized cells. Cell lysates in lysis buffer were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-PDGF-r subunit antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immunoprecipitated proteins were washed twice in lysis buffer, washed twice in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and finally resuspended in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MnCl2. The reaction was started with the addition of [32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, 20 μCi) to all samples, which were incubated at 4 °C for 10 min. The beads were then washed once with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and finally resuspended in 20 μl of Laemmli's sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE (19Sorkin A. Eriksson A. Heldin C.H. Westermark B. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 156: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The autoradiogram was scanned using Chemidoc Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Normalization was achieved by anti-PDGF-r immunoblot of a part of the analyzed samples. In addition, the PDGF-r kinase activity was assayed using an exogenous substrate, glutathioneS-transferase-PLC-γ (20DeMali K.A. Whiteford C.C. Ulug E.T. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9011-9018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were incubated in the presence of 20 mm1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid, pH 7.0, 10 mmMnCl2, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μCi of [γ-32-P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) for 10 min at 30 °C in the presence or absence of 0.5 μg of glutathioneS-transferase-PLC-γ1. The fusion protein included amino acid residues 550–850 of rat PLC-γ1. The reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of 2× sample buffer (10 mm EDTA, 4% SDS, 5.6 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 1% bromphenol blue). The samples were then incubated for 3 min at 95 °C, spun, and resolved on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the radiolabeled proteins were detected by autoradiography. Normalization has been achieved by anti-PLC-γ1 immunoblot of a part of the analyzed samples. The PI3K assay was performed as described elsewhere (20DeMali K.A. Whiteford C.C. Ulug E.T. Kazlauskas A.

Briefly, serum-starved cells were incubated with 30 ng/ml PDGF for 10 min and then lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Equal amounts of proteins were immunoprecipitated using PY20 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After washing, the immunobeads were resuspended in 50 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm EGTA. 0.5 μl of 20 mg/ml phosphatidylinositol was added, mixed, and incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. 1 μl of 1 mm MgCl2 and 10 μCi of [32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) were then added simultaneously and incubated at 25 °C for an additional 10 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 150 μl of chloroform, methanol, and 37% HCl (10:20:0.2). The samples were extracted with chloroform and dried. Radioactive lipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography using chloroform, methanol, 30% ammonium hydroxide, and water (46:41:5:8). After drying, the plates were autoradiographed. The radioactive spots corresponding to phosphatidylinositol phosphate were scraped and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. 1.5 × 104 cells were plated on a 6-well dish in complete medium. Cells were serum-starved for 24 h before receiving 30 ng/ml PDGF-BB for the indicated times, lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and centrifuged to remove the insoluble debris. The total protein content was evaluated by the BCA protein assay, and 20 μg of lysates were resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE. The resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and probed overnight with anti-phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 monoclonal antibodies. The binding assay was performed as described elsewhere (21Marra F. Pinzani M. DeFranco R. Laffi G. Gentilini P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, after PDGF-BB stimulation, HepG2 cells expressing wild-type or the Tyr to Phe mutant version of PDGF-r were lysed, and PDGF-r was immunoprecipitated. Immunocomplexes were collected as usual with protein A-Sepharose and washed several times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and once with binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100). Agarose-bound receptors were resuspended in 0.1 ml of binding buffer and allowed to associate with 1 μg of dominant negative glutathioneS-transferase-LMW-PTP at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed twice in 1 ml of binding buffer and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for anti-LMW-PTP immunoblot analysis. Previous studies have shown that in NIH3T3 cells, overexpression of dnLMW-PTP causes an increased mitogenic response to PDGF, whereas overexpression of the wild-type LMW-PTP has the opposite effect (10Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Raugei G. Camici G. Dolfi F. Berti A. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 23Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9640) Google Scholar). The dominant negative form of LMW-PTP is a mutant of the catalytic site Cys-12 to Ser. As in all PTPs, the catalytic site cysteine is capable of transiently forming the cysteinyl-phosphate intermediate, and the mutation of this amino acid residue converts the enzyme in an inactive phosphatase. The preservation of the substrate binding site(s) in the C12S mutant (i.e. the Arg residue in the catalytic pocket) maintains the potential to bind intracellular natural substrates, leading to the increase in their tyrosine phosphorylation level. Here we perform a time course experiment (Fig.1 A) in which cells overexpressing dnLMW-PTP were serum-starved for 24 h and stimulated with PDGF for 10, 45, and 120 min. The tyrosine phosphorylation level of PDGF-r was evaluated by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot, in comparison with mock-transfected cells. The blot has been reprobed with anti-PDGF-r antibodies for normalization (Fig.1 B). The results, shown in Fig. 1 A, demonstrated that overexpression of dnLMW-PTP leads to a great increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation level of the activated receptor. Notably, we observe an increase in both the peak of PDGF-r tyrosine phosphorylation (10 min) and the duration of activation of the receptor itself (Fig.1 C). Hence, overexpression of dnLMW-PTP produces a dramatic effect on the activation of PDGF-r, leading to a greater and longer activation with respect to mock-transfected cells. The internalization and trafficking of ligand-activated cell surface receptor have long been reported as a possible down-regulation mechanism for many receptors (24Berti A. Rigacci S. Raugei G. Degl'Innocenti D. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported recently that endosomes retain a role in either initiating or extending the signal elicited at the plasma membrane, namely, MAPK pathway activation (25Leof E.B. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 343-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 26Burke P. Schooler K. Wiley H.S. Mol. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 35301-35304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We analyzed the tyrosine phosphorylation level of internalized PDGF-r by trypsin treatment of agonist-stimulated dnLMW-PTP-overexpressing cells in comparison with mock-transfected ones. This method allows a direct analysis of receptor endocytosis by means of trypsin-directed proteolysis of the cell surface receptor. The internalized receptors are in fact the only ones retaining the original molecular weight, whereas the receptor molecules remaining at the cell surface are cleaved by trypsin. Our results (Fig.2 A) indicate that receptor internalization shows similar kinetics in both dnLMW-PTP-overexpressing cells and mock-transfected cells, with a maximum at 10 min after stimulation, followed by a slow decrease. The data have been normalized on the basis of anti-PDGF-r immunoblot by stripping and reprobing the same filter (Fig. 2 B) and plotting the values in Fig.2 C. The results indicate that LMW-PTP does not affect the tyrosine phosphorylation level of the internalized receptor and that the tyrosine phosphorylation level of the internalized receptor does not decrease as rapidly as the cell surface receptor phosphorylation level (Fig. 1) but remains high for at least 2 h. The tyrosine phosphorylation level of PDGF-r after stimulation is due to the regulation of the rate of phosphorylation or dephosphorylation. It has been reported that in PDGF-r, phosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosine in position 857 temporally precedes the complete autophosphorylation of the receptor in multiple SH2 domain binding sites and is required for the full activation of receptor kinase activity (16Baxter R.M. Secrist J.P. Vaillancourt R.R. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17050-17055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of LMW-PTP on Tyr-857, we analyzed the binding of LMW-PTP to Tyr-857 after PDGF-r activation. We have already reported that LMW-PTP binds only to agonist-activated PDGF-r through the phosphatase catalytic site, although we had no information about the specific tyrosine(s) involved in its binding (10Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Raugei G. Camici G. Dolfi F. Berti A. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 13Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Marra F. Raugei G. Fiaschi T. Camici G. Manao G. Romanelli R.G. Ramponi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6776-6785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells overexpressing the wild-type PDGFβ receptor or the Y857F mutant were stimulated with PDGF-BB, and the binding of dnLMW-PTP to agarose-bound activated PDGF-r was analyzed (Fig. 3 A). Receptor activation in cells expressing either wild-type or mutant PDGF-r was checked by antiphosphotyrosine immunoblot of the agarose-bound receptors (Fig. 3 B). The results show that the association between PDGF-r and LMW-PTP is dramatically reduced in cells expressing the Y857F mutant of PDGF-r compared with cells expressing the wild-type receptor, suggesting that Tyr-857 is a key binding site for LMW-PTP in the activated receptor. In addition, we analyzed the phosphorylation level of this residue by means of anti-phospho-Y857 antibodies (Fig. 3 C). PDGF-r content has been checked by anti-PDGF-r immunoblot of the stripped blot (Fig.3 D). The results indicate that phosphorylation of tyrosine 857, although transient, is dramatically increased by dnLMW-PTP overexpression. LMW-PTP appears to influence only the phosphorylation level of Tyr-857 in the maximum peak (namely, 10 min after PDGF stimulation), and does not appear to influence the temporal extent of its phosphorylation. The requirement of phosphorylation in Tyr-857 for receptor tyrosine kinase activity is well documented (29Jones S.M. Kazlauskas A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 30Fantl W.J. Escobedo J.A. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4473-4478Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In this light, we assayed PDGF-r autophosphorylation activity in cells overexpressing dnLMW-PTP (Fig. 4 A). PDGF-r kinase activity on an exogenous substrate such as PLC-γ1 was monitored under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 4 B), obtaining results in agreement with the PDGF-r autophosphorylation assay. The results of the normalized data (Fig. 4, A and B) show that dnLMW-PTP overexpression affects receptor kinase activity only at 10 min, and not at longer times. It has been proposed that the phosphorylation of the different tyrosines in PDGF-r display temporal and spatial distribution, suggesting that receptor functions corresponding to each of the phosphorylated sites were regulated as a function of time. In particular, Bernard and Kazlauskas (17Bernard A. Kazlauskas A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 704-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) propose that whereas the kinase activity of the receptor is regulated within the first 10 min after stimulation, other receptor functions persist for longer times. It is likely that LMW-PTP affects receptor kinase activity only at 10 min because the phosphorylation of tyrosine 857, which is required for activation of receptor kinase activity, is present only within that 10-min period. To investigate the hypothetical site selectivity of LMW-PTP in PDGF-r dephosphorylation, we analyzed the tyrosine phosphorylation level of different sites in a time course experiment with mock-transfected and dnLMW-PTP-overexpressing cells. We stimulated cells for the period necessary to commit cells to S-phase entry, namely, 8–9 h (28Vieira A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). We used phosphospecific antibodies directed toward Tyr(P)-857 (activation loop), Tyr(P)-751 (PI3K binding site), Tyr(P)-716 (Grb2 binding site), and Tyr(P)-1021 (PLC-γ1 binding site). The results in Fig. 5show that dnLMW-PTP appears to greatly increase the tyrosine phosphorylation level of Tyr-857 (Fig. 5 A) and Tyr-751 (Fig.5 B) and partially increase that of Tyr-1021 (Fig.5 C). On the contrary, the effect on Tyr-716 (Fig.5 D) is absent, in agreement with our previous observation about the lack of dephosphorylation of internalized activated receptors. Taken together, these data suggest that LMW-PTP acts as a general PDGF-r signaling terminator by lowering the phosphorylation level of the regulatory Tyr-857 and/or many of the phosphotyrosines that mediated SH2-binding protein activation but not of the Grb2 binding site Tyr-716. The tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGF-r leads to the recruitment of many SH2 domain-containing proteins. For many of them, different tyrosines have been found to be specific binding sites. In particular PI3K binds to Tyr-751, PLC-γ1 binds to Tyr-1021, and SHP-2 binds to Tyr-1009 (3Heldin C.H. Ostman A. Ronnstrand L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F79-F113PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kazlauskas A. Durden D.L. Cooper J.A. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Because the ability of these proteins to bind to the receptor is directly proportional to the phosphorylation of the binding site, we analyzed the recruitment of many SH2 domain-containing proteins to the receptor in mock-transfected and dnLMW-PTP-expr"

Fox T.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 91-113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Dieckmann C.L. Staples R.R. Jeon K.W. Jarvik J.W. International Review of Cytology.

Mutations in these nuclear genes often lead to respiratory deficiency, termed thepet 1 phenotype because colonies are petite in size on fermentable glucose medium. To understand how mitochondrial gene expression is regulated, the function of these nuclear PET genes must first be understood. The nuclear PET gene CBP1 encodes a protein that is imported into mitochondria and is required for the stability of the mitochondrial cytochrome b (COB) mRNA (4Dieckmann C.L. Pape L.K. Tzagoloff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1805-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 5Weber E.R. Dieckmann C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1594-1600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).COB mRNA is co-transcribed with the upstream tRNAglu. The tRNA is processed from the initial transcript by mitochondrial RNaseP and tRNA 3′-endonuclease, leaving a transcript we have called the COB precursor RNA. The precursor is further shortened at the 5′-end to produce what we have called the mature COB mRNA. In a wild-type strain, there is approximately five times more mature than precursor COB RNA. In a cbp1 null strain, the mature COB mRNA is undetectable, and precursor RNA is reduced 2- to 5-fold from wild-type levels (Fig. 1) (6Staples R.R. Dieckmann C.L. Genetics. 1993; 135: 981-991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). cbp1 null strains are respiratory-deficient, and no apocytochrome b is synthesized, which suggests that: the 5′-extension on the precursor RNA inhibits translation, the abundance of the precursor is below the threshold required for respiration (about 4% of the levels of mature mRNA in the wild-type strain), or Cbp1 is required for translation of COB RNAs. Evidence that precursor COB RNAs can be translated has come from studies of Pet127, a nuclear-encoded protein that is localized to mitochondria, where it plays a role in RNA processing. AΔpet127 null strain exhibits a leaky non-respiratory phenotype at 37 °C but respires well at 30 °C, the normal growth temperature for yeast. In pet127 strains, 5′-end processing of COB, VAR1, and ATP8/6mRNAs and 15 S rRNA is blocked, and unprocessed COBprecursor RNAs accumulate to levels equivalent to those of processed RNAs in wild-type strains (7Wiesenberger G. Fox T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2816-2824Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Since null pet127 strains have no mature COB mRNA, but respire well, the 5′-unprocessed RNAs must be translated at sufficient levels to support near wild-type respiratory capability. Additional data suggestive of a requirement for Cbp1 in COBRNA translation have come from analyses of point mutations in theCOB 5′-untranslated leader. Previously, we have defined a CCG trinucleotide in the otherwise AU-rich COB RNA leader that is especially important for Cbp1-dependent accumulation of COB RNAs. This CCG is located just downstream of the 5′-end of mature COB mRNA (Fig. 1). We have hypothesized that Cbp1 interacts with COB RNAs in the region containing the CCG trinucleotide. ACG and CCU mutant strains are temperature-sensitive for respiration and have very low levels of COB mRNA, whereas the CAG mutant strain is respiratory-incompetent at all temperatures and has undetectable levels of mRNA (8Chen W. Dieckmann C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6203-6211Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Δpet127 null mutations arose as spontaneous suppressors of the conditionally respiratory-deficient ACG and CCU mutations but were unable to suppress the CAG mutation. However, all three of theΔpet127 mutant strains (ACG, CCU, CAG) accumulated similar increased levels of COBprecursor RNA. 2M. A. Islas-Osuna and C. L. Dieckmann, unpublished results. 2M. A. Islas-Osuna and C. L. Dieckmann, unpublished results. Thus, the accumulated COB precursor RNAs must be translated in theΔpet127 ACG and CCU strains but not in the CAG strain. We have interpreted the respiratory-deficient phenotype of CAG as a loss of Cbp1 function in translation of COB RNAs. As a more direct test of the activities of Cbp1, we made a deletion in the CBP1 gene in a Δpet127 mutant strain with the expectation that a Δcbp1Δpet127 strain would accumulate enough COB precursor RNA to test our hypothesis that Cbp1 is required for translation. Measurements of respiratory capability, COB RNA accumulation, and synthesis of cytochrome b apoprotein in the single Δcbp1 andΔpet127 and double null Δcbp1Δpet127 mutant strains supports the hypothesis that Cbp1 is required for translation of COB RNAs.

Biol. 1993; 13: 4203-4213Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) except that the hybridization reaction was incubated at 47 °C for 90 min. 9 μl of each of the reaction mixtures were loaded on a 7 m urea, 6% polyacrylamide wedged sequencing gel. The signals obtained from precursor and mature COB mRNAs were quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and normalized to the signal from cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (COX2) transcripts in the same strain. InΔpet127 strains, COX2 levels are reduced modestly. Northern analysis done in triplicate showed that theCOX2 mRNA level is 70% of wild-type in theΔpet127 strain (data not shown). COB levels in the primer extension analyses of pet127 strains were corrected for this reduction in COX2 levels. In vivo pulse-labeling of mitochondrial proteins was performed as described previously (14Mittelmeier T.M. Dieckmann C.L. Curr. Genet. 1990; 18: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The cultures were labeled with 12.5 μCi/ml [35S]methionine for 2 h (Amersham Biosciences) in the presence of cycloheximide, which inhibits cytosolic protein synthesis. Translation products were fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE, dried, and visualized by exposing the gel to film for 14 days. Growth on media containing non-fermentable carbon sources such as glycerol is a simple and very sensitive method for measuring respiratory capability. Metabolism of glycerol requires a functional respiratory chain and ATP synthase in the mitochondrial compartment. To compare the respiration phenotype of the Δcbp1Δpet127strain with that of the single mutant and wild-type controls, the strains were grown overnight on rich glucose liquid medium (YPD) and then serially diluted and spotted on rich glycerol plates (YEPG) and incubated at 25, 30, or 33 °C (Fig.2). The wild-type and theΔpet127 strains grew very similarly at 30 °C on YEPG. The wild-type strain grew slightly better than the Δpet127strain at both 25 and 33 °C. The Δcbp1 andΔcbp1Δpet127 strains did not grow on glycerol at any of the three temperatures. The double Δcbp1Δpet127 deletion could lead to respiratory incompetence by affecting the stability, processing, and/or translation of COB transcripts. Either COB RNA is destroyed (epistasis of the cbp1 COB RNA instability phenotype) or COB RNA accumulates in theΔcbp1Δpet127strain in an unprocessed form (epistasis of the pet127 unprocessed COB RNA phenotype) but is not translated. To determine whether the respiratory deficiency of the double deletion strain Δcbp1Δpet127 was a result of the instability of COB transcripts, the steady-state levels ofCOB precursor and mature RNAs were determined by quantitative primer extension analysis (Fig.3). As observed previously, the respiratory-deficient Δcbp1 strain had no detectable mature COB mRNA and reduced levels of the COBprecursor RNA (6Staples R.R. Dieckmann C.L. Genetics. 1993; 135: 981-991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The respiratory-competent Δpet127strain had only COB precursor RNA at a level equal to the sum of precursor and mature mRNA in the wild-type strain (128% of wild-type levels of mature COB mRNA). Like theΔpet127 single mutant, the Δcbp1Δpet127strain had no mature COB mRNA but had substantial levels of COB precursor RNA (58% of wild-type levels of matureCOB message). Very slow respiratory growth on glycerol plates has been observed for strains that have as little as 4% of wild-type levels of mature COB mRNA (12Mittelmeier T.M. Dieckmann C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4203-4213Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The inability of the Δcbp1Δpet127 strain to respire, despite relatively high levels of COB precursor transcripts, supports the hypothesis that Cbp1 is required for translation ofCOB RNAs as well as their stability. To determine whether the cytochrome b protein was present in the Δcbp1Δpet127 strain, mitochondrial gene products in the double and single mutant strains were labeledin vivo with [35S]methionine and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4). As expected, apocytochrome b protein was detected at robust levels in both the wild-type and Δpet127 strains (lanes 2and 3), confirming efficient translation of COBprecursor RNA in the Δpet127 strain. In contrast, no apocytochrome b was detected in theΔcbp1Δpet127 strain (Fig. 4, lane 4), suggesting that Cbp1 is required for translation of COBRNAs. The absence of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (Cox1) in theΔcbp1Δpet127 strain is another indicator that Cbp1 is required for translation of COB RNAs, as opposed to assembly/stability of cytochrome b protein. Translation of an intron-excision maturase, encoded in the fourth intron ofCOB (bi4), is required for splicing of the bi4 intron and also for splicing of the fourth intron of COX1. Therefore, if bi4 maturase is not translated from the COB precursor RNA containing introns, fully spliced COX1 mRNA is not produced, and Cox1 protein cannot be translated (15Labouesse M. Netter P. Schroeder R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 144: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Nuclear-encoded factors that promote translation of specific mitochondrial messenger RNAs have been described: for COBmRNAs (Cbs1 and Cbs2), for ATP9 mRNAs (Aep1 and Aep2), for COX1 mRNAs (Pet309), forCOX2 mRNAs (Pet111), for COX3 mRNAs (Pet54, Pet494, and Pet122), and for ATP8/6 mRNAs (Nca2/Nca3) (reviewed in Ref. 3Grivell L.A. Artel-Sanz M. Hakkart G. de Jong L Nijtmans L.G. van Oosterum K. Siep M. van der Spek H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In many cases, the deletion of the nuclear gene results in a decrease in the abundance of the mitochondrial mRNA as well as a block to initiation of translation. Here we have shown that Cbp1 falls into this class of “translational activator” proteins as it affects both stability and translation ofCOB RNAs. In respiratory-competent Δpet127strains, COB precursor RNAs are translated to produce wild-type levels of cytochrome b protein. However, inΔcbp1Δpet127 strains, precursor RNAs accumulate but are not translated to produce either the COB-encoded maturases or cytochrome b. The translation of wild-type levels of cytochrome b in theΔpet127 strain indicates that precursor RNAs with extended 5′-ends are translated as efficiently as 5′-trimmed mRNAs. All evidence to date has pointed toward an internal entry mode of translation initiation for mitochondrial mRNAs (3Grivell L.A. Artel-Sanz M. Hakkart G. de Jong L Nijtmans L.G. van Oosterum K. Siep M. van der Spek H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For example, mitochondrial mRNAs often have quite long 5′-untranslated regions with multiple AUG sequences upstream of the bona fide start codon. The messages do not have 5′-cap structures that would be required for a cap-dependent initiation scheme similar to that for eukaryotic cytoplasmic translation (16Christianson T. Rabinowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14025-14033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Especially for COX2 and COB, sites near the start codon have been delineated through mutagenesis as being required for translation initiation (17Bonnefoy N. Bsat N. Fox T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2359-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Mittelmeier T.M. Dieckmann C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 780-789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it should not be surprising that mRNAs that are extended in length at the 5′-end, many nucleotides away from the ribosome entry site, can be translated. It has been known for some years that unspliced precursor mRNAs are translated; translation of the maturases in the introns of COB and COX1 is required for subsequent excision of the introns (15Labouesse M. Netter P. Schroeder R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 144: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). So why do COB, ATP8/6, and VAR1mRNAs have 5′-extensions that are shortened in a Pet127-dependent manner, whereas COX1, COX2, COX3, and ATP9 do not? COX1, COX2, COX3, andATP9 may not be susceptible to shortening by Pet127 because they have 5′-triphosphate ends (the RNA is not processed after transcription). For example, Escherichia coli RNaseE is much more active on RNAs with monophosphate 5′-ends than triphosphate ends (19Mackie G.A. Nature. 1998; 395: 720-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). COX3 transcripts are processed by cleavage of the upstream tRNAval. This 5′-processed mRNA may not be susceptible because the 5′-end is protected by RNA secondary structure or by proteins, such as the translational activators Pet494, Pet54, and Pet122 (20Brown N.G. Costanzo M.C. Fox T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1045-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). COB, ATP8/6, and VAR1mRNAs are susceptible up to the point where protection is provided. It may be that the sequences between the long and short mRNA 5′-ends of ATP8/6 and VAR1 are dispensable as has been shown for COB (13Chen W. Dieckmann C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16574-16578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but these sequences have not yet disappeared over evolutionary time, or there may be some subtle necessity for these sequences that has yet to be discovered. COB precursor RNAs were 2-fold higher in theΔpet127 than in the Δpet127Δcbp1 strain. This implies that Cbp1 protects against one or more degradation pathways that are not governed by Pet127, and/or the rate of transcription of COB is decreased in cbp1 mutant strains. Lower rates of COB transcription could be a specific effect of the loss of Cbp1, or they could be a general effect of the respiratory deficiency of this strain. Does Cbp1 work together with the COB-specific translational activators Cbs1 and Cbs2 to promote translation of the mRNAs? Cbp1 acts through a sequence that maps to the 5′-end of the matureCOB mRNA (−961 to −898), whereas Cbs1 and Cbs2 act through a site that maps to positions between −232 to −60 and −33 to −4 relative to the start codon at +1 (18Mittelmeier T.M. Dieckmann C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 780-789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). COB mRNA is stable in cbs1 and cbs2 mutants, but the mRNA is not translated (21Rödel G. Curr. Genet. 1986; 11: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Cbp1 is found in the soluble fraction when mitochondria are sonicated in buffer lacking salt, 4K. Krause and C. L. Dieckmann, manuscript in preparation. whereas Cbs1 is firmly embedded in the membrane and Cbs2 is peripherally attached (22Michaelis U. Körte A. Rödel G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 230: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The three proteins may interact at the surface of the inner membrane in a complex that includes COB mRNA. Cbp1 could become associated with the RNA during transcription, and through its affinity for the other two proteins, it could deliver the RNA to the membrane complex of Cbs1 and Cbs2, which promotes association with mitochondrial ribosomes. Testing of this model requires further genetic and biochemical experimentation. We thank Jacque Baca, Mike Rice, and Melissa Dellos for assisting with this manuscript."

Polyamine stimulation was observed only in strains in which the 33rd codon of RpoS mRNA is a UAG termination codon instead of a CAG codon for glutamine in wild-typeE. coli. Readthrough of the termination codon by Gln-tRNAsupE was stimulated by polyamines. This stimulation was found to be caused by an increase in both the level of suppressor tRNAsupE and the binding affinity of Gln-tRNAsupE for ribosomes. The stimulatory effect was observed with a UAG termination codon but not with UGA and UAA codons. Readthrough of the UAG termination codon at the 270th amino acid position of RpoS mRNA was also stimulated by polyamines, indicating that polyamines stimulate readthrough of a UAG codon regardless of its location within the RpoS mRNA. When cell viability of anE. coli strain having a termination codon in the 33rd position of RpoS mRNA was compared using cells cultured with or without putrescine, it was higher in cells cultured with putrescine than in cells cultured without putrescine. The level of ς38 subunit in the cells cultured with putrescine was higher than that in cells cultured without putrescine on days 2, 4, and 8, but the level of ς70 subunit was almost the same in cells cultured with or without putrescine.

Because polyamines interact with nucleic acids and mostly exist as polyamine-RNA complexes in cells (3Watanabe S. Kusama-Eguchi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1986; 156: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), altogether suggesting that polyamines regulate protein synthesis at several different steps.In Escherichia coli, the synthesis of OppA protein, a periplasmic substrate-binding protein of the oligopeptide uptake system, is strongly stimulated by the addition of putrescine to a polyamine-requiring mutant, MA261 (9Kashiwagi K. Yamaguchi Y. Sakai Y. Kobayashi H. Iarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8387-8391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that (i) the stimulation of OppA synthesis takes place at the level of translation; (ii) the position and secondary structure of the Shine-Dalgarno (SD)1 sequence (16Shine J. Dalgarno L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 1342-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (2549) Google Scholar) on OppA mRNA are important for this stimulation (17Igarashi K. Saisho T. Yuguchi M. Kashiwagi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4058-4064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); and (iii) polyamines cause a structural change of the SD sequence and the initiation codon AUG of OppA mRNA, facilitating formation of the initiation complex (18Yoshida M. Meksuriyen D. Kashiwagi K. Kawai G. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22723-22728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We also found that polyamines increase the translation of adenylate cyclase (Cya) mRNA by facilitating UUG codon-dependent initiation (19Yoshida M. Kashiwagi K. Kawai G. Ishihama A. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16289-16295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Analysis of RNA secondary structure suggests that exposure of the SD sequence of mRNA is a prerequisite for polyamine stimulation of UUG codon-dependent initiation (19Yoshida M. Kashiwagi K. Kawai G. Ishihama A. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16289-16295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).In the present study we found a novel mechanism of the polyamine stimulation, which is involved in the enhanced synthesis of RNA polymerase ς38 subunit by polyamines (19Yoshida M. Kashiwagi K. Kawai G. Ishihama A. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16289-16295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This type of the polyamine stimulation was observed only in E. colistrains in which the 33rd codon of RpoS mRNA is a UAG amber termination codon instead of a CAG codon for glutamine in wild-typeE. coli strains. Readthrough of the termination codon by Gln-tRNAsupE was stimulated by polyamines.DISCUSSIONPolyamines stimulate the synthesis of a set of proteins such as oligopeptide-binding protein (OppA) (17Igarashi K. Saisho T. Yuguchi M. Kashiwagi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4058-4064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), adenylate cyclase (Cya) (19Yoshida M. Kashiwagi K. Kawai G. Ishihama A. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16289-16295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and ς38 subunit (RpoS) (this paper). Up to now two different mechanisms have been identified: a structural change of OppA mRNA, leading to enhanced template activity for translation (17Igarashi K. Saisho T. Yuguchi M. Kashiwagi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4058-4064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and stimulation of initiation codon UUG-dependent fMet-tRNA binding to Cya mRNA-ribosomes (19Yoshida M. Kashiwagi K. Kawai G. Ishihama A. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16289-16295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The results herewith described show a novel mode of the polyamine stimulation of protein synthesis. Polyamines stimulate readthrough of the amber codon by enhancing the binding of amber codon UAG-dependent Gln-tRNAsupE on ribosome-associated RpoS mRNA (see Fig.9). Thus polyamines modulate protein synthesis not only at the level of initiation but also at the level of elongation of translation. We propose that genes whose expression is modulated by polyamines at the level of translation are referred to as “polyamine modulon.” Experiments are in progress to find other members of the polyamine modulon.The increase in readthrough of the amber codon by polyamines has been found for translation of the mutant gene 1 protein mRNA from T7 phage (42Tabor H. Tabor C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7087-7091Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Stimulation of readthrough of both UAG amber and UGA opal codons by polyamines also has been reported in E. coli and eukaryotic cell-free systems (43Hirashima A. Harigai H. Watanabe I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 88: 1046-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 44Morch M.D. Benicourt C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 105: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 45Hryniewicz M.M. Vonder Haar R.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1983; 190: 336-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In these cases, however, the mechanism was not studied in detail. As for polyamine stimulation of the synthesis of ς38 subunit, the translation suppression was found to be caused by stimulation of Gln-tRNAsupEbinding to ribosomes via two processes, i.e. an increase in the level of tRNAsupE and an increase in the binding affinity of Gln-tRNAsupE to ribosomes. As to the increase in tRNAsupE level, it is of interest to know whether polyamines stimulate transcription of the metT operon or stabilize tRNAsupE. If the latter is the case, the increase in both intracellular level and intrinsic function of tRNAsupE can be explained by a structural change of tRNAsupE by polyamines.Readthrough in vivo of the UGA opal codon at the 33rd codon of RpoS mRNA was not stimulated by polyamines in cells under our experimental conditions (see Fig. 3). The frequency of the use of UAG, UGA, and UAA as the termination codon in E. coli is 7.6, 29.3, and 63.1%, respectively (46Blattner F.R. Plunkett III, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (5962) Google Scholar). Furthermore, 316 among 4288 genes in E. coli K12 use tandem termination codons (47Major L.L. Edgar T.D. Yee Yip P. Isaksson L.A. Tate W.P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Because not so many genes use UAG as the real termination codon at the end of full-length reading frames, the gene expression as a whole may not be influenced strongly by polyamines even if polyamines stimulate the readthrough of UAG at the natural termination sites.We found that a mutation at the 33rd position of the ORF of RpoS mRNA occurs frequently. In such strains, polyamines enhance cell viability. The results confirmed that the ς38 subunit is important for cell viability (41Eisenstark A. Calcutt M.J. Becker-Hapak M. Ivanova A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 975-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and indicate that polyamines play an important role in cell viability of E. coli cells having an amber codon at the 33rd position of the ORF of RpoS mRNA. Polyamines, aliphatic cations present in almost all living organisms, are necessary for normal cell growth (1Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev.

In Escherichia coli, the synthesis of OppA protein, a periplasmic substrate-binding protein of the oligopeptide uptake system, is strongly stimulated by the addition of putrescine to a polyamine-requiring mutant, MA261 (9Kashiwagi K. Yamaguchi Y. Sakai Y. Kobayashi H. Iarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8387-8391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that (i) the stimulation of OppA synthesis takes place at the level of translation; (ii) the position and secondary structure of the Shine-Dalgarno (SD)1 sequence (16Shine J. Dalgarno L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 1342-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (2549) Google Scholar) on OppA mRNA are important for this stimulation (17Igarashi K. Saisho T. Yuguchi M. Kashiwagi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4058-4064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); and (iii) polyamines cause a structural change of the SD sequence and the initiation codon AUG of OppA mRNA, facilitating formation of the initiation complex (18Yoshida M. Meksuriyen D. Kashiwagi K. Kawai G. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22723-22728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We also found that polyamines increase the translation of adenylate cyclase (Cya) mRNA by facilitating UUG codon-dependent initiation (19Yoshida M. Kashiwagi K. Kawai G. Ishihama A. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16289-16295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Analysis of RNA secondary structure suggests that exposure of the SD sequence of mRNA is a prerequisite for polyamine stimulation of UUG codon-dependent initiation (19Yoshida M. Kashiwagi K. Kawai G. Ishihama A. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16289-16295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the present study we found a novel mechanism of the polyamine stimulation, which is involved in the enhanced synthesis of RNA polymerase ς38 subunit by polyamines (19Yoshida M. Kashiwagi K. Kawai G. Ishihama A. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16289-16295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This type of the polyamine stimulation was observed only in E. colistrains in which the 33rd codon of RpoS mRNA is a UAG amber termination codon instead of a CAG codon for glutamine in wild-typeE. coli strains. Readthrough of the termination codon by Gln-tRNAsupE was stimulated by polyamines. DISCUSSIONPolyamines stimulate the synthesis of a set of proteins such as oligopeptide-binding protein (OppA) (17Igarashi K. Saisho T. Yuguchi M. Kashiwagi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4058-4064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), adenylate cyclase (Cya) (19Yoshida M. Kashiwagi K. Kawai G. Ishihama A. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16289-16295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and ς38 subunit (RpoS) (this paper). Up to now two different mechanisms have been identified: a structural change of OppA mRNA, leading to enhanced template activity for translation (17Igarashi K. Saisho T. Yuguchi M. Kashiwagi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4058-4064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and stimulation of initiation codon UUG-dependent fMet-tRNA binding to Cya mRNA-ribosomes (19Yoshida M. Kashiwagi K. Kawai G. Ishihama A. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16289-16295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The results herewith described show a novel mode of the polyamine stimulation of protein synthesis. Polyamines stimulate readthrough of the amber codon by enhancing the binding of amber codon UAG-dependent Gln-tRNAsupE on ribosome-associated RpoS mRNA (see Fig.9). Thus polyamines modulate protein synthesis not only at the level of initiation but also at the level of elongation of translation. We propose that genes whose expression is modulated by polyamines at the level of translation are referred to as “polyamine modulon.” Experiments are in progress to find other members of the polyamine modulon.The increase in readthrough of the amber codon by polyamines has been found for translation of the mutant gene 1 protein mRNA from T7 phage (42Tabor H. Tabor C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7087-7091Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Stimulation of readthrough of both UAG amber and UGA opal codons by polyamines also has been reported in E. coli and eukaryotic cell-free systems (43Hirashima A. Harigai H. Watanabe I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 88: 1046-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 44Morch M.D. Benicourt C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 105: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 45Hryniewicz M.M. Vonder Haar R.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1983; 190: 336-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In these cases, however, the mechanism was not studied in detail. As for polyamine stimulation of the synthesis of ς38 subunit, the translation suppression was found to be caused by stimulation of Gln-tRNAsupEbinding to ribosomes via two processes, i.e. an increase in the level of tRNAsupE and an increase in the binding affinity of Gln-tRNAsupE to ribosomes. As to the increase in tRNAsupE level, it is of interest to know whether polyamines stimulate transcription of the metT operon or stabilize tRNAsupE. If the latter is the case, the increase in both intracellular level and intrinsic function of tRNAsupE can be explained by a structural change of tRNAsupE by polyamines.Readthrough in vivo of the UGA opal codon at the 33rd codon of RpoS mRNA was not stimulated by polyamines in cells under our experimental conditions (see Fig. 3). The frequency of the use of UAG, UGA, and UAA as the termination codon in E. coli is 7.6, 29.3, and 63.1%, respectively (46Blattner F.R. Plunkett III, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (5962) Google Scholar). Furthermore, 316 among 4288 genes in E. coli K12 use tandem termination codons (47Major L.L. Edgar T.D. Yee Yip P. Isaksson L.A. Tate W.P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Because not so many genes use UAG as the real termination codon at the end of full-length reading frames, the gene expression as a whole may not be influenced strongly by polyamines even if polyamines stimulate the readthrough of UAG at the natural termination sites.We found that a mutation at the 33rd position of the ORF of RpoS mRNA occurs frequently. In such strains, polyamines enhance cell viability. The results confirmed that the ς38 subunit is important for cell viability (41Eisenstark A. Calcutt M.J. Becker-Hapak M. Ivanova A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 975-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and indicate that polyamines play an important role in cell viability of E. coli cells having an amber codon at the 33rd position of the ORF of RpoS mRNA. Polyamines stimulate the synthesis of a set of proteins such as oligopeptide-binding protein (OppA) (17Igarashi K. Saisho T. Yuguchi M. Kashiwagi K. J. Biol.

Expression of the late mRNAs is restricted to the terminally differentiated cells in the upper layers of the epithelium and at least four papillomaviruses (bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1), HPV-1, -16, and -31) have been shown to contain cis-acting inhibitory RNA elements located in the late 3′ UTR (reviewed in Refs. 3Baker C.C.

In addition, negative RNA elements have been identified in the HPV-16 L1 and L2 open reading frames (4Schwartz S. Semin. Virol. 1998; 8: 291-300Google Scholar, 7Tan W. Felber B.K. Zolotukhin A.S.

We have previously identified and characterized an inhibitory AU-rich element (ARE) located in the HPV-1 late 3′ UTR region named h1ARE (4Schwartz S. Semin. Virol. 1998; 8: 291-300Google Scholar, 5Schwartz S. Sokolowski M. Collier B. Carlsson A. Goobar-Larsson L. Recent Res. Dev. Virol. 1999; 1: 53-74Google Scholar, 6Schwartz S. Upsala J. Med.

Using actinomycin D we showed that the presence of the h1ARE reduced the mRNA half-life (10Sokolowski M. Zhao C. Tan W. Schwartz S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2303-2319Google Scholar). The minimal inhibitory sequence termed XB spans 57 nucleotides (nt) and contains 93% A and U. The element contains two AUUUA- and the three UUUUU-containing sequences (9Tan W. Schwartz S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2932-2945Google Scholar, 10Sokolowski M. Zhao C. Tan W. Schwartz S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2303-2319Google Scholar). Replacing two uridines (U) with cytidines (C) in each motif inactivated the h1ARE (10Sokolowski M. Zhao C. Tan W. Schwartz S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2303-2319Google Scholar). The h1ARE interacts with cellular factors (11Zhao C. Tan W. Sokolowski M. Schwartz S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3659-3667Google Scholar, 12Zhao C. Sokolowski M. Tan W. Schwartz S. Virus Res. 1998; 55: 1-13Google Scholar), which bind to the c-fosARE (10Sokolowski M. Zhao C. Tan W. Schwartz S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2303-2319Google Scholar). Two of the h1ARE binding factors interacted with the wild type h1ARE but not with a functionally inactive mutant of the h1ARE (10Sokolowski M. Zhao C. Tan W. Schwartz S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2303-2319Google Scholar). These proteins were identified as HuR and hnRNP C (10Sokolowski M. Zhao C. Tan W. Schwartz S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2303-2319Google Scholar, 13Sokolowski M. Furneaux H. Schwartz S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1080-1091Google Scholar), and we later showed that binding of the HuR protein correlates with inhibitory activity of a panel of h1ARE mutants (13Sokolowski M. Furneaux H. Schwartz S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1080-1091Google Scholar). While HuR binds to both AUUUA- and UUUUU-motifs (13Sokolowski M. Furneaux H. Schwartz S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1080-1091Google Scholar), hnRNP C binds exclusively to the UUUUU-motifs (14Sokolowski M. Schwartz S. Virus Res. 2001; 73: 163-175Google Scholar). The role of hnRNP C in HPV-1 late gene expression is unclear. The HuR protein shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (15Keene J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5-7Google Scholar), and we observed that there was an inverse correlation between the levels of HuR in the cell cytoplasm and the inhibitory activity of the h1ARE (16Carlsson A. Schwartz S. Arch. Virol. 2000; 145: 491-503Google Scholar), suggesting that the presence of high levels of HuR in the cytoplasm antagonizes the inhibitory effect of the h1ARE, whereas a primarily nuclear association of HuR is associated with inhibition of HPV-1 late gene expression. Interestingly, the HIV Rev and RRE, and the SRV-1 CTE can overcome the inhibition (9Tan W. Schwartz S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2932-2945Google Scholar), suggesting that the h1ARE traps the HPV-1 late mRNAs in the nucleus and that this may lead to rapid mRNA degradation. Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of the h1ARE was greater at the protein level than at the mRNA level, suggesting that the h1ARE also inhibited the utilization of the mRNA. Here we present results of a mutational analysis of the h1ARE, and we provide evidence that the h1ARE inhibits mRNA translation. All the eukaryotic expression plasmids containing the h1ARE mutants are derived from pΔKX (11Zhao C. Tan W. Sokolowski M. Schwartz S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3659-3667Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). Oligonucleotides were annealed and cloned into pΔKX digested with KpnI and XbaI, which resulted in the insertion in pΔΚX of the wild type and mutant h1ARE sequences displayed in the figures. All mutants were sequenced. pCMVlacZ was constructed by replacing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene in pΔKX by the lacZ gene. To generate pCCΔ that lacks the h1ARE and its derivatives, a fragment containing the first 75 nts that are transcribed from the CMV promoter, the CAT gene and HPV-1 late 3′ UTR sequences spanning nt 7184–7447 was first amplified from pΔKX using oligonucleotides HCMV-S (5′-CGAGCTCTCAGATCGCCTGGAGACGCC-3′) and XhoIpA (9Tan W. Schwartz S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2932-2945Google Scholar), introducing unique 5′-SacI and 3′-XhoI sites. The PCR fragment was ligated to pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), downstream of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter, generating pΔ. pΔ was digested withApaI and EcoRV, filled in with T4 DNA polymerase, and religated to remove polylinker sequences between the T7 promoter and the cloned PCR fragment, generating pCCΔ. pCCΔ also lacks the downstream polylinker sequences between KpnI andXhoI, which are replaced by a unique NsiI site. To generate pCC, a PCR fragment was first amplified from pCCKH1 (11Zhao C. Tan W. Sokolowski M. Schwartz S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3659-3667Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B) by using oligonucleotides HCMV-S (see above) andXhoIpA (9Tan W. Schwartz S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2932-2945Google Scholar) followed by insertion into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). This step was followed by transfer of a SacI-XhoI fragment from the pCR2.1-based intermediate to pCCΔ, resulting in pCC. To generate pCC(A), which contains the h1ARE in the antisense orientation, a PCR fragment amplified from pCCKH1 by using oligonucleotides H1KPNI-A (5′-GGTACCGAACACTACTGTAGAATATGTG-3′) and H1XBA-S (5′-TCTAGAGCTACTAGTTCCACCACAAAGCGC-3′) was inserted intoEcoRV-digested pBlueScript (Stratagene) generating pKS-H1XK. This was followed by transfer of aKpnI-XbaI fragment from pKS-H1XK to pCC, resulting in pCC(A). Plasmids pCCXB, pCCAUM/UM, pCCAUM, pCCUM, pCCB2, and pCCC1 were generated by transfer of KpnI-XbaI fragments from the previously described plasmids pKSXB, pKSAUM/UM, pKSAUM, pKSUM, pKSB2, and pKSC1 (10Sokolowski M. Zhao C. Tan W. Schwartz S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2303-2319Google Scholar), respectively, to pCC digested with KpnI and XbaI. pCMVhGH has been described previously (17Ramirez-Solis R. Resendez-Perez D. Alvidrez-Quihui L. Rincon-Limas D. Varela-Martinez R. Martinez-Rodriguez H. Barrera-Saldana H. Gene. 1990; 87: 291-294Google Scholar). Radiolabeled RNAs for UV cross-inking were produced from pKSXB, pKSAUM/UM, pKSB2, and pKSC1 (10Sokolowski M. Zhao C. Tan W. Schwartz S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2303-2319Google Scholar). DNA transfections were performed with FuGENE (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described previously (10Sokolowski M. Zhao C. Tan W. Schwartz S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2303-2319Google Scholar). Transfections were performed in triplicates, and mean values and standard deviations are displayed in the figures. For RNA analysis triplicate samples were pooled and analyzed by Northern blot. Each plasmid was analyzed in at least three independent transfection experiments. RNA synthesis and transfections were performed as described previously (18Wiklund L. Spångberg K. Goobar-Larsson L. Schwartz S. J. Hum. Virol. 2001; 4: 74-84Google Scholar). To generate RNAs with a poly(A) tail of fixed length, two PCR fragments were first amplified with the following primer pairs: T7CATS (5′-GTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTACTGCGATGAGTGGCAGGG-3′) and HPV1ANTIPA (5′-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTCACACTTGTGTATAATGCACCGG-3′) (which encodes a A60 tail) or T7CATS and HPV1ALW (5′-CACACTTGTGTATAATGCACCGG-3′). The PCR fragments that were generated from plasmid pΔKX or pΔKX containing the 57-nt h1ARE fragment using the two primer pairs described above were gel-purified and used for synthesis of capped RNAs with and without the A60tail. Plasmids or RNA encoding CAT, human growth hormone (hGH), or β-galactosidase were included in all transfections to monitor the transfection efficiency. To monitor CAT protein levels, RNA-transfected HeLa cells were harvested as described previously (8Sokolowski M. Tan W. Jellne M. Schwartz S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1504-1515Google Scholar) at indicated time points. For DNA transfections, cells were harvested at 40 h posttransfection. The levels of CAT, hGH, and β-galactosidase proteins were quantified using CAT, hGH and β-galactosidase antigen capture ELISA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), respectively. All CAT quantitations were normalized to the protein concentration of the cell extract as determined by the Bradford method. Cytoplasmic RNA extraction and primer extension were performed as described previously (8Sokolowski M. Tan W. Jellne M. Schwartz S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1504-1515Google Scholar). To perform Northern blotting, total cytoplasmic RNA was extracted at various times posttransfection as previously described (18Wiklund L. Spångberg K. Goobar-Larsson L. Schwartz S. J. Hum. Virol. 2001; 4: 74-84Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was performed as described (10Sokolowski M. Zhao C. Tan W. Schwartz S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2303-2319Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of total or cytoplasmic RNA was separated on 1% agarose gels containing 2.2m formaldehyde, followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose filter and hybridization. Random priming of the DNA probe was performed using a DECAprime kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. UV cross-linking and synthesis of radiolabeled RNA were performed as previously described (11Zhao C. Tan W. Sokolowski M. Schwartz S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3659-3667Google Scholar, 19Spångberg K. Wiklund L. Schwartz S. Virology. 2000; 274: 378-390Google Scholar). GST-PABP, GST-HuR, and GST-PCBP were purified on GS beads according the manufacturers recommendations (Amersham Biosciences). To study the HPV-1 late 3′ UTR element named h1ARE (Fig.1 A) further, the 57-nt minimal element (XB) (Fig. 1 B) or a functionally inactive mutant thereof (AUM/UM) (Fig. 1 B) was inserted between the CAT reporter gene, driven by the human cytomegalovirus promoter, and the late HPV-1 poly(A) signals resulting in pXB and pAUM/UM (Fig.1 B). As controls, we used pΔKX (which lacks the major part of the late 3′ UTR), pCCKH1 (which contains the entire late 3′ UTR), and pCCKH1(A) (which contains the region of the late 3′ UTR containing the XB sequence in antisense orientation). HeLa cells were transfected in triplicate, the CAT production was monitored in each plate, and mean values and standard deviations are displayed in the figures. pCMVlacZ was included as an internal control in all transfections, and the variation was less than 20% between the samples in the triplicates. For RNA analysis, cytoplasmic extracts from the triplicates were pooled and subjected to RNA extraction and Northern blotting. Analysis of CAT production in transient transfections of HeLa cells and calculation of fold difference between pCCKH1(A)/pCCKH1 and pXB/pAUM/UM revealed that the fold difference between pCCKH1(A)/pCCKH1 and pXB/pAUM/UM were similar and demonstrated that the 57-nt XB contains the major inhibitory sequence (data not shown). The mRNAs containing the 57-nt XB fragment have a short half-life (Fig.1 C). In agreement with our previous findings, the presence of the h1ARE on the mRNA also results in a higher ratio of nuclearversus cytoplasmic mRNA (data not shown). We concluded that pXB and pAUM/UM could be used for further studies of the AU-rich element. The XB sequence contains two AUUUA motifs and three AUUUUUA motifs that were numbered I–V (Fig. 2 A). These motifs were all mutated in AUM/UM (Fig. 2 A). To investigate if all motifs were required for inhibition, the motifs were mutated one by one (Fig. 2 A). However, there was only a modest increase in CAT RNA and protein levels (Fig. 2, B andC) for each mutant. To obtain a clearer answer on the importance of each motif, consecutive mutations were introduced in the motifs (Fig. 3 A). The results revealed that higher expression levels were obtained as more motifs were mutated (Fig. 3, B and C), demonstrating that each motif contributed to inhibition. However, mutations in four of the motifs (pM4) yielded as high expression levels as mutations in all five motifs (pAUM/UM) (Fig. 3, B and C). To investigate if the fifth motif contributed to inhibition, it was mutated in pM2 (Fig. 3 A), resulting in pM2V (Fig.3 A). The results revealed that pM2V expressed higher RNA and protein levels than did pM2. These levels were similar to those produced from pM3 (Fig. 3, B and C), thereby demonstrating that also the fifth motif contributed to inhibition. Interestingly, the effect was greater at the protein level than at the RNA levels, for all analyzed mutants (Fig. 3, B andC). We concluded that all five motifs contributed to inhibition in an additive manner.Figure 3A, HPV-1 sequences inserted into the reporter plasmid are shown.

Mutations in the tri-U nucleotides, the flanking As or the Us immediately flanking the As were not well tolerated (Fig. 4, B and C). However, mutations in the second nucleotide position outside the As (Fig.4 A), did not significantly affect the inhibitory activity of these motifs (Fig. 4, B and C), indicating that the smallest inhibitory motif was UAUUUAU. The two UAUUUAU were separated by a four-nucleotide spacer sequence (Fig. 4 A). Substituting this sequence with four Cs did not affect the inhibitory activity of the h1ARE (Fig. 4, B and C), indicating that this spacer sequence did not contribute to the inhibitory activity. To determine the minimal inhibitory sequence of the penta-U motifs, the nucleotides flanking the penta-Us were mutated (Fig.5 A). The results revealed that mutations in both the As flanking the penta-Us and the Us flanking the As resulted in higher CAT protein and RNA expression levels (Fig. 5,B and C). Substituting two Us in the penta-U sequence with two Cs had the strongest effect, whereas mutations in the Us flanking the As had the smallest effect on the inhibitory activity (Fig. 5, B and C). Therefore, the minimal motif was UAUUUUUAU. The h1ARE may be divided into the B2 region with the two UAUUUAU motifs and the C1 region with the three UAUUUUUAU motifs (Fig.6 A). The B2 region, although less inhibitory than the XB sequence, as expected, inhibited CAT production and reduced mRNA levels to the same extent as the did C1 region (Fig. 6, B and C). Two B2 or two C1 regions were as inhibitory as the entire XB (Fig. 6, B andC), demonstrating that one type of motif (UAUUUAU or UAUUUUUAU) could substitute for one another. Furthermore, if the two AUUUA motifs were extended to two AUUUUUA motifs by insertion of two Us in each motif, resulting in pAUUUUUA (Fig.7 A), or if the three penta-U motifs were all shortened to contain only three Us, as in pAUUUA (Fig.7 A), the resulting inhibitory elements were nearly as inhibitory as the wild type h1ARE (Fig. 7, B andC). Both B2 regions and C1 regions acted by reducing mRNA steady state levels and protein production. Inhibition was also greater at the protein level than at the mRNA level. Taken together, the results demonstrated that both motifs acted in a similar manner.Figure 7A, HPV-1 sequences inserted into the reporter plasmid are shown.

Pooled RNAs from triplicate experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) For all mutants that retained inhibitory activity, we observed that the inhibitory effect was greater at the protein level than at the mRNA level (see Fig. 2, B andC, Fig. 3, B–D, Fig. 4, B andC, Fig. 5, B and C, Fig. 6,B and C, and Fig. 7, B andC). In other words, the mRNAs that contained the h1ARE, or partially active mutants thereof were utilized less efficiently by the translation machinery than mRNAs lacking the h1ARE or mRNAs containing functionally inactive sequences. To better compare the effect on protein production and the effect on the mRNA levels, multiple XB sequences were inserted into the reporter plasmid pXB, resulting in p2XB, p3XB, and p4XB (Fig.8 A), and the fold inhibition at the protein and mRNA levels was separately plotted against the number of XBs on the mRNA. As can be seen, there is a gradual decrease in CAT protein and mRNA levels for every inserted copy of the XB fragment (Fig. 8, B and C), and the fold inhibition was greater at the protein level than at the RNA level (Fig.8, B and C). Extrapolation of the data in a semilog plot allowed a better estimate of the inhibitory activity of one single XB sequence at protein and RNA levels (Fig. 8 D) within the context of these plasmid constructs. The results clearly demonstrated that XB had a greater effect at the protein level than at the RNA level (Fig. 8 D). On average from multiple experiments, we found that CAT protein levels were reduced 3.7-fold per XB and RNA levels 1.4-fold per XB in the context of the mRNAs with multiple XBs (Fig. 8 D). We concluded that in addition to the effect on mRNA half-life, mRNAs carrying the h1ARE are inefficiently utilized for translation. Deadenylation (20Ross J. Micobiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 15-95Google Scholar, 21Chen C.-Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Google Scholar) could potentially cause the inhibition of translation observed here. To determine the poly(A) tail length of the mRNAs shown in Fig. 8 C, they were subjected to oligonucleotide-directed RNaseH cleavage with the “RNaseH oligo” shown in Fig. 8 A followed by Northern blot using a probe located downstream of the RNaseH oligo. The results revealed that all mRNAs contained poly(A) tails of similar length (Fig.8 E), demonstrating that inhibition of translation was not a result of deadenylation. To study the effect of the h1ARE on translation further, we replaced the CMV immediate-early promoter with the bacteriophage T7 promoter and the cleavage and polyadenylation signal with the XhoI restriction site in the reporter constructs pCCKH1(A) and pCCKH1 (Fig. 1 B) used previously to study the h1ARE. These cloning steps resulted in pCC(A) and pCC (Fig.9 A) that were linearized withXhoI and used as templates for in vitro synthesis of capped and polyadenylated CC(A) and CC mRNAs as described under “Experimental Procedures.” These mRNAs contained the same sequences as the mRNAs produced by the pCCKH1 and pCCKH1(A) plasmids in the nuclei of transfected cells (Fig. 1 B). Capped and polyadenylated CC and CC(A) mRNAs were transiently transfected in triplicates into HeLa cells by electroporation, and the CAT levels produced at 20 h posttransfection were quantified by using a CAT ELISA. The results revealed that CC mRNAs that contain the h1ARE in sense orientation produced ∼15-fold lower CAT protein levels than the CC(A) mRNAs, which contain the h1ARE in antisense orientation (Fig. 9 A). Cotransfected hGH-encoding mRNAs included in all samples as an internal control produced similar hGH protein levels (Fig. 9 A). Next, aliquots of electroporated cells were harvested at different time points, and the levels of CAT protein were monitored and plotted against time (Fig. 9 B). Two interpretations of the results shown in Fig. 9 B were appropriate: either the mRNAs with the HPV-1 late 3′ UTR were rapidly degraded, preventing further CAT protein synthesis, or the mRNAs were not available for further rounds of translation as a result of a direct inhibition of translation, presumably by factors binding to the h1ARE. To investigate if the half-lives of the transfected mRNAs were reduced by the presence of the HPV-1 late 3′ UTR, CC and CC(A) mRNA levels at 1, 3, 5, and 23 h posttransfection were determined by primer extension (Fig. 9 C). CC and CC(A) mRNAs decayed at similar rates, as detected at 1, 3, and 5 h posttransfection (Fig. 9 C). Longer exposures also detected similar amounts of CC and CC(A) mRNA at 23 h posttransfection (data not shown). The mRNA half-lives were calculated to be 2.6 h for CC mRNAs and 2.7 h for CC(A) mRNAs. A number of control experiments were performed using CC(A) and/or CC mRNA. These experiments verified that electroporated RNAs were not sticking to the outside of the cell and that the majority of the transfected mRNAs are normally utilized by the translation machinery (data not shown). We concluded that the inhibitory effect on the transfected mRNAs, mediated by the HPV-1 late 3′ UTR, was not a result of reduced mRNA half-life in the cytoplasm and that the HPV-1 late 3′ UTR acted by inhibiting mRNA translation. In addition, the previously observed effect on the mRNA half-life was dependent on a nuclear experience of the mRNA and was not seen when in vitro synthesized mRNAs were transfected into cells. To confirm that the 57-nt minimal XB sequence containing the two UAUUUAU and the three UAUUUUUAU motifs inhibited translation in the RNA transfection experiments, CCXB and CCAUM/UM mRNAs (Fig.10 A) were transfected into HeLa cells in parallel. The CCAUM/UM mRNAs produced 41-fold higher levels of CAT than the CCXB mRNAs (Fig. 10 B). hGH protein levels produced from the internal control mRNAs were similar in both samples (Fig. 10 B). Next, capped and polyadenylated CCXB, CCAUM/UM, CCB2, and CCC1 mRNAs (Fig.10 A) were electroporated into HeLa cells, and the levels of CAT protein produced at 3, 6, 23, and 47 h posttransfection were quantified. hGH mRNAs were included in all samples as an internal control. Fig. 10 C shows that XB-containing mRNAs produced lower CAT protein levels than the AUM/UM-containing mRNAs as expected, whereas B2- and C1-containing mRNAs showed similar intermediate inhibition of CAT protein production compared with AUM/UM- and XB-containing mRNAs (Fig. 10 C). hGH protein accumulation in the cell culture medium was similar in all transfected samples at each time point (Fig. 10 C). The CAT protein production peaked at the 23 h time point for all four mRNAs, after which the CAT protein levels decreased. This is the expected result if the mRNAs have similar half-lives. The mRNA decay rates in the cells transfected with CCXB and CCAUM/UM mRNA were determined by primer extension on RNA extracted from the transfected cells. Fig. 10 D shows that the levels of CCXB and CCAUM/UM mRNAs were similar at 1 and 2.5 h posttransfection and decayed with a rate comparable to that observed for CC and CC(A) mRNAs (compare Figs. 10 D and9 C). The results confirmed that the h1ARE acts primarily by reducing mRNA translation in the RNA transfection experiments performed here and demonstrated that both the two UAUUUAU motifs and the three UAUUUUUAU motifs inhibit translation. The poly(A) tail is required for efficient mRNA translation (23Sachs A. Sarnow P. Hentze M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 831-838Google Scholar). We therefore wished to investigate if the HPV-1 AU-rich element interfered with the function of the poly(A) tail. We transfected polyadenylated and unpolyadenylated capped CC and CC(A) mRNAs and monitored the levels of CAT protein in the cells at 24 h posttransfection. Fig.11 A shows that the polyadenylated CC mRNA, which contains the HPV-1 AU-rich element in sense orientation, produced 56-fold lower CAT protein levels than polyadenylated CC(A) mRNA, which contains the HPV-1 AU-rich element in antisense orientation. In contrast, the presence of the h1ARE on the unpolyadenylated CC mRNA did not inhibit CAT production significantly (Fig. 11 A). The stimulatory effect of the 3′-poly(A) tail, when added to the capped CC mRNA, which contains the h1ARE, was only 1.5-fold, compared with 58-fold when added to the CC(A) mRNA. Translation of co-transfected hGH mRNA was similar in all samples (Fig. 11 A). Similar results were obtained in a time course experiment using the XB sequence and the inactive AUM/UM mutant (Fig. 11 B), demonstrating a connection between the 57-nt XB sequence and the poly(A) tail. Taken together, the results demonstrated that inhibition of CAT production by the h1ARE was dependent on a 3′-poly(A) tail. Therefore, the results showed that the stimulatory effect on translation mediated by the 3′-poly(A) tail on cap-dependent translation was perturbed by the h1ARE. Also here could the inhibitory effect of the AU-rich RNA element on translation be indirect through deadenylation. To investigate if the h1ARE promoted deadenylation of the in vitro synthesized mRNAs that were transfected into the HeLa cells, mRNAs with a poly(A) tail of fixed length were transfected into the cells and the length of the poly(A) tail was determined at 1 or 4 h posttransfection by Northern blotting. Capped mRNAs with and without the h1ARE or poly(A) tail were analyzed. The results revealed that the mRNAs were not deadenylated at 1 h posttransfection (Fig. 11 C). In addition, analysis of the polyadenylated mRNAs containing the h1ARE at 4 h posttranfection showed that the poly(A) tails remained intact (Fig. 11 C). Therefore, inhibition of translation was not caused by deadenylation. Having established that the h1ARE inhibited the function of the poly(A) tail, it was reasonable to speculate that the h1ARE, or h1ARE binding factors, interact directly with the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP). We therefore tested if PABP bind directly to the XB RNA. GST-PABP was UV cross-linked to XB RNA or AUM/UM RNA. UV cross-linking of GST-PABP revealed that GST-PABP bound strongly to the XB RNA but only weakly to the AUM/UM RNA (Fig. 12 A); GST-PABP did not bind to an unrelated RNA derived from the L1 coding region in HPV-16 (Fig. 12 A). The GST-HuR protein was used as positive control and interacted only with XB, as expected (13Sokolowski M. Furneaux H. Schwartz S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1080-1091Google Scholar), and GST-PCBP did not bind to any of the RNA sequences (Fig.12 A). To confirm that the binding of GST-PABP to the XB sequence was sequence specific, a competition experiment was performed. The XB RNA competed efficiently with the RNA probe for binding to GST-PABP, whereas the HPV-16 L1-derived RNA did not (Fig.12 B), demonstrating that the interaction with XB was sequence-specific. Analysis of the deletion mutants B2 and C1 that were shown to inhibit translation to a similar extent also interacted with the PABP (Fig. 12 A). Therefore, binding of PABP to the different mutants (B2, C1, and AUM/UM)) correlated with their inhibitory effect on translation. The mutational analysis presented here revealed that the HPV-1 AU-rich element consists of the two UAUUUAU heptamers and the three UAUUUUUAU nonamers. Previous studies on the c-fos ARE led to the conclusion that the UAUUUUAU motif was sufficient for mRNA destabilization but not optimal, and that multiple copies were needed for significant destabilization (24Lagando C.A. Brown C.Y. Goodall G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7984-7995Google Scholar). This is in agreement with the results presented here. Based on a mutational analysis and sequence alignments, these authors concluded that the minimal motif may be UUAUUUA(U/A)(U/A). In another article on the c-fosARE, a deletion analysis of the c-fos ARE led to the conclusions that the UUAUUUAUU nonamer, and not the UAUUUAU heptamer, was the shortest destabilizing motif (25Zubiaga A.M. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2219-2230Google Scholar). These authors also found that mRNAs containing multiple copies of the nonamer are degraded more rapidly than mRNAs with only one copy. Using the HPV-1 ARE, we also found that multiple copies of the motif were more inhibitory than one copy. However in our system, mutations outside of the heptamer UAUUUAU did not affect its ability to reduce mRNA levels. In the context of the HPV-1 ARE, the UAUUUAU was the shortest motif with inhibitory activity, indicating that the sequence context may affect the potency of an AU-rich element. In contrast to the HPV-1 AU-rich element that contains two UAUUUAU and three UAUUUUUAU motifs, the AU rich element on the IL-3 mRNA contains six AUUUA motifs. Mutations in three of these motifs had the same effect as deleting the entire element (26Stoecklin G. Hahn S. Moroni C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28591-28597Google Scholar). The HPV-1 AU-rich element contains five motifs, and we show that all five contribute to inhibition in an additive manner. Similarly, mutations in all three AUUUA motifs in the c-fos ARE resulted in mRNA stabilization (27Chen C.-Y.A. Chen T.-M. Shyu A.-B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 416-426Google Scholar). It appears that multiple copies of the “AUUUA”-related motifs are required for full function of the various AU-rich RNA elements. We have previously shown that the mRNA half-life is reduced by the presence of the h1ARE when using DNA transfections in which the mRNAs are synthesized in the cell nuclei (9Tan W. Schwartz S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2932-2945Google Scholar, 10Sokolowski M. Zhao C. Tan W. Schwartz S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2303-2319Google Scholar). In contrast, when the same mRNAs were introduced directly into the cytoplasm as described here, bypassing the nucleus, there was no effect on the mRNA half-life by the h1ARE. These results indicate that a nuclear experience of the h1ARE-containing mRNAs is necessary for rapid mRNA degradation, suggesting that the mRNAs are either modified in the nuclei or interact with nuclear factors that induce premature mRNA degradation. Recent results on the ARE-containing c-fos mRNA showed that HuR mediates nuclear export of c-fos mRNAs (28Gallouzi I.E. Steitz J.A. Science. 2001; 294: 1895-1901Google Scholar). HuR also increases the c-fos mRNA half-life, suggesting that nuclear export and mRNA stability are connected and that inefficient mRNA export leads to premature degradation. In a previous article, we reported that the HIV-1 mRNA export factor Rev in combination with RRE or the SRV-1 CTE could overcome the inhibitory effect of the h1ARE (9Tan W. Schwartz S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2932-2945Google Scholar), demonstrating that export of the h1ARE-containing mRNAs through an alternative, productive pathway overcomes inhibition and results in high expression. These results also demonstrated that the h1ARE has an inhibitory function in the nucleus, in addition to its inhibitory effect of translation in the cytoplasm described here. The h1ARE binds PABP and may inhibit the interaction between PABP and eIF4G, thereby preventing circularization of the mRNA and the subsequent loading of ribosomes on the mRNA. This is not without precedent since it was recently shown that the rotavirus mRNA 3′-end-binding protein NSP3 interacts with eIF-4G and that NSP3 competes with the PABP for the eIF4G (29Piron M. Vende P. Cohen J. Poncet D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5811-5821Google Scholar). Alterations of either the poly(A)-PABP or cap-eIF4E complexes lead to access to the poly(A) tail and cap by the poly(A) ribonuclease (PARN/DAN), resulting in deadenylation (30Wilusz C. Wormington M. Peltz S. Nature Rev. 2001; 2: 237-246Google Scholar). Deadenylation was not observed here. It has also been proposed that the shuttling elav-like proteins are involved in mRNA translation directly (31Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 266-277Google Scholar, 32Antic D., Lu, N. Keene J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 8684-8735Google Scholar). Similarly, redistribution of HuR protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is associated with increased protein production from mRNAs containing AREs with HuR binding sites (33Gallouzi I.E. Brennan C.M. Stenberg M.G. Swanson M.S. Eversole A. Maizels N. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3073-3078Google Scholar, 34Kasashima K. Terashima K. Yamamoto K. Sakashita E. Sakamoto H. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 667-683Google Scholar). Therefore, HuR may act similarly to HuB and promote polysomal loading of ARE-containing mRNAs. HIV-1 Rev protein that overcomes the inhibitory effect of the h1ARE in HeLa cells also induces polysomal loading of target mRNAs (35D'Agostino D.M. Felber B.K. Harrison J.E. Pavlakis G.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1375-1386Google Scholar, 36Arrigo S.J. Chen I.S. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 808-819Google Scholar). Perhaps elav-like proteins such as HuR lead mRNAs onto a productive pathway that includes efficient nuclear export and polysomal loading. The role of the h1ARE, HuR, and the PABP in the HPV-1 life cycle remains to be determined. We are grateful to H. Furneaux for GST-HuR plasmid, J. Bag for GST-PABP, H. Leffers for GST-PCBP, and A. Grynfeld for critically reading the manuscript."

The amount of NOVH increases in benign adrenocortical tumors and decreases in malignant adrenocortical tumors, suggesting that NOVH plays a role in tumorigenesis in the adrenal cortex.

We investigated the effects of these factors on the expression of novH in the NCI H295R adrenocortical cell line. The amounts of NOVH protein and novH transcripts were down-regulated by TGFβ1 and up-regulated by FGF2, whereas IGFs had no effect.

Co-transfection with dominant negative forms of c-Jun and MEKK1 also abrogated novH-targeted regulation by TGFβ1, whereas the overproduction of Smad proteins or dominant negative forms of Smad had no effect. Taken together, these results suggest that c-Jun and MEKK1 signaling but not Smad signaling are involved in the TGFβ1-dependent decrease in NOVH in NCI H295R cells.

It encodes a cysteine-rich secreted multimodular glycoprotein (10Chevalier G. Yeger H. Martinerie C. Laurent M. Alami J. Schofield P.N. Perbal B. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 1563-1575Google Scholar), which shares strong structural similarities with the other CCN proteins (5Bork P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 125-130Google Scholar, 11Brigstock D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 189-206Google Scholar). These proteins are involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, chemotaxis, angiogenesis, adhesion, and the formation of the extracellular matrix. In vivo, they appear to be involved in normal processes such as implantation, placentation, embryogenesis, differentiation, and development as well as pathological situations including wound healing, fibrotic disorders, and tumors (for a review see Ref. 11Brigstock D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 189-206Google Scholar). Relatively little is known about the functions of NOV. However, several reports have suggested that it up- or down-regulates cell proliferation, depending on the cell type, (3Joliot V. Martinerie C. Dambrine G. Plassiart G. Brisac M. Crochet J. Perbal B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 10-21Google Scholar, 12Liu C. Liu X.J. Crowe P.D. Kelner G.S. Fan J. Barry G. Manu F. Ling N., De Souza E.B. Maki R.A. Gene. 1999; 238: 471-478Google Scholar, 13Ellis P.D. Chen Q. Barker P.J. Metcalfe J.C. Kemp P.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1912-1919Google Scholar). There are also several lines of evidence indicating that NOV is involved in cell adhesion. Indeed, the multidomain structure of NOV and the other CCN proteins suggests that they bind to components of the extracellular matrix, including heparin-like oligomers (5Bork P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 125-130Google Scholar). The finding that fibulin 1C, an extracellular matrix-associated protein (14Balbona K. Tran H. Godyna S. Ingham K.C. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20120-20125Google Scholar, 15Zhang H.Y. Kluge M. Timpl R. Chu M.L. Ekblom P. Differentiation. 1993; 52: 211-220Google Scholar), interacts with the human NOV protein (NOVH) (16Perbal B. Martinerie C. Sainson R. Werner M., He, B. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 869-874Google Scholar) suggests that NOVH has a role in signaling pathways involving the extracellular matrix. It was recently shown that recombinant NOV can promote the adhesion of vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro and that changes innov expression occur following injury to the arterial walls (13Ellis P.D. Chen Q. Barker P.J. Metcalfe J.C. Kemp P.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1912-1919Google Scholar). In normal tissues, the expression of nov is tightly regulated during the development of the central nervous system (17Su B.Y. Cai W.Q. Zhang C.G., Su, H.C. Perbal B. C. R. Acad. Sci. III. 1998; 321: 883-892Google Scholar, 18Natarajan D. Andermarcher E. Schofield P.N. Boutler C. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 219: 417-425Google Scholar) and skeletal and visceral muscles (18Natarajan D. Andermarcher E. Schofield P.N. Boutler C. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 219: 417-425Google Scholar) and during chondrogenesis. 2M. Laurent, unpublished results. novH is highly expressed in the adrenal cortex during embryogenesis, and in adults novH is more strongly expressed in the adrenal cortex than in other endocrine tissues (19Martinerie C. Gicquel C. Louvel A. Laurent M. Schofield P. Le Bouc Y. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 3929-3940Google Scholar). Thus,novH may play an autocrine/paracrine role in the development and/or differentiation of these tissues. Interestingly, the expression of novH is altered in several human tumors, including Wilms' tumors (4Martinerie C. Huff V. Joubert I. Badzioch M. Saunders G. Strong L. Perbal B. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2729-2732Google Scholar, 10Chevalier G. Yeger H. Martinerie C. Laurent M. Alami J. Schofield P.N. Perbal B. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 1563-1575Google Scholar) and adrenocortical tumors (19Martinerie C. Gicquel C. Louvel A. Laurent M. Schofield P. Le Bouc Y. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 3929-3940Google Scholar). In adrenocortical tumors, which have a very poor prognosis (20Latronico A. Chrousos G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 1317-1324Google Scholar, 21Gicquel C., Le Bouc Y. Luton J.P. Bertagna X. Curr. Opin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 1998; 5: 189-196Google Scholar), quantitative and qualitative changes in novHexpression are correlated with the acquisition of the tumoral phenotype by adrenocortical tissue (19Martinerie C. Gicquel C. Louvel A. Laurent M. Schofield P. Le Bouc Y. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 3929-3940Google Scholar). Significant differences have been detected in the concentrations of NOVH and novH mRNA in benign and malignant tumors. Furthermore, the NOVH protein profiles are different in the two types of tumor, suggesting that novHplays a role in the early stages of tumorigenesis. The enhanced expression of novH in benign tumors may contribute to the benign phenotype by increasing cell adhesion, whereas the lower expression of novH in malignant tumors could be involved in cell invasiveness (19Martinerie C. Gicquel C. Louvel A. Laurent M. Schofield P. Le Bouc Y. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 3929-3940Google Scholar). Alternatively, the down-regulation ofnovH in malignant adrenocortical tumors suggests thatnovH could act as a tumor suppressor. This hypothesis is supported by the inverse correlation between tumorigenicity andnovH expression in glioma cells (22Wen-Xin L. Martinerie C. Zumkeller W. Westphal M. Perbal B. J. Clin. Mol. Pathol. 1996; 49: M91-M97Google Scholar) and by the fact that the ectopic expression of novH in glioma cells reduces their tumorigenicity in xenografts (23Gupta N. Wang H. McLeod T. Naus C. Kyurkchiev S. Advani S., Yu, J. Perbal B. Weichselbaum R. Mol. Pathol. 2001; 54: 293-299Google Scholar). 3M. Laurent, C. Martinerie, H. Thibout, M. P. Hoffman, F. Verrechia, Y. Le Bouc, A. Mauviel, and H. Kleinman, submitted for publication. Therefore, we decided to investigate the molecular mechanisms responsible for the alterations in novH expression in tumoral adrenocortical cells. For this purpose, in the present study we used the human NCI H295R cell line, which is derived from a human adrenocortical carcinoma that produces steroids (24Logié A. Boulle N. Gaston V. Perin L. Boudou P., Le Bouc Y. Gicquel C. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 23: 23-32Google Scholar, 25Gazdar A. Oie H. Shackleton C. Chen T. Triche T. Myers C. Chrousos G. Brennan M. Stein C. La Locca R. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5488-5496Google Scholar). A number of growth factors and cytokines such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor-α (TGFα), tumor necrosis growth factor (TNFα), interleukins (26Feige J.J. Vilgrain I. Brand C. Bailly S. Souchelnitskiy S. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 158: 7-19Google Scholar, 27Ilvesmaki V. Jaattela M. Saksela E. Voutilainen R. Mol. Cell.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2207-2210Google Scholar), insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) (for a review see Refs. 26Feige J.J. Vilgrain I. Brand C. Bailly S. Souchelnitskiy S. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 158: 7-19Google Scholar and 29Messiano S. Jaffe R.B. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 378-403Google Scholar), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) (26Feige J.J. Vilgrain I. Brand C. Bailly S.

Endocrinol. 1998; 158: 7-19Google Scholar and 29Messiano S. Jaffe R.B. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 378-403Google Scholar) regulate adrenal growth and functions in normal and fetal adrenal glands. The concentration of IGF-II, which also plays a role in adrenocortical tumorigenesis (24Logié A. Boulle N. Gaston V. Perin L. Boudou P., Le Bouc Y. Gicquel C. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 23: 23-32Google Scholar, 30Ilvesmäki V. Kahri A. Miettinen P. Voutilainen R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 77: 852-858Google Scholar, 31Gicquel C. Raffin-Sanson M. Gaston V. Bertagna X. Plouin P. Sclumberger M. Louvel A. Luton J. Le Bouc Y. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 2559-2565Google Scholar), is inversely correlated to novH expression in several malignant adrenocortical tumors, suggesting that IGF-II regulates the expression of novH or vice versa (19Martinerie C. Gicquel C. Louvel A. Laurent M. Schofield P. Le Bouc Y. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 3929-3940Google Scholar). Moreover, FGF2 and TGFβ1 can induce the production of other members of the CCN family such as CTGF and CYR61 in fibroblasts and in some epithelial cells (32O'Brien T. Yang G. Sanders L. Lau L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3569-3577Google Scholar, 33Brunner A. Chinn J. Neubaer M. Purchio A. DNA Cell Biol. 1991; 10: 293-300Google Scholar, 34Igarashi A. Okoshi H. Bradham D.M. Grotendorst G.R. Mol.

Thus, we examined whether novH expression is affected by IGFs, FGF2, and TGFβ1 in NCI H295R cells. We showed that the expression of novH is not modulated by IGFs but is up-regulated by FGF2 and down-regulated by TGFβ1. These regulations occur at the transcriptional level. Further studies indicated that two AP-1 consensus binding sites (−473 and −447) within thenovH promoter play a crucial role in TGFβ1 regulation but not in the stimulatory effect of FGF2. Finally, we provide evidence that c-Jun and MEKK1, but not Smad, can mediate the TGFβ1-dependent decrease of novHexpression. ThenovH promoter constructs p625NH-Luc and p492NH-Luc were derived from p625NH-CAT and p492NH-CAT, respectively (37Martinerie C. Chevalier G. Rauscher F.J. Perbal B. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1479-1492Google Scholar). Following digestion with HindIII and BglII, thenovH promoter fragments were subcloned into the promoterless p2KM[BT] luciferase reporter vector (38Darville M.I. Antoine I.V. Rousseau G.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3575-3583Google Scholar). p2540NH-Luc was obtained by replacing the 493-bp HindIII-Bsu36I fragment from p625NH-Luc with the 1.8-kb HindIII-Bsu36I fragment derived from the novH pBH7 subclone (4Martinerie C. Huff V. Joubert I. Badzioch M. Saunders G. Strong L. Perbal B. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2729-2732Google Scholar). The (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc reporter was a gift from Dr. J. M. Gauthier. Myc-Smad2, Smad3, Smad4, FLAG-Smad7, pCMV-TAM67, c-Jun-Ala, and MEKK1(K432A) have been described previously (39Prunier C. Ferrand N. Frottier B. Pessah M. Atfi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3302-3313Google Scholar, 40Prunier C. Mazars A. Noe V. Bruyneel E. Mareel M. Gespach C. Atfi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22919-22922Google Scholar, 41Pessah M. Prunier C. Marais J.

Chem. 1997; 17: 1429-1432Google Scholar). The constitutively activate MKK7 and the dominant negative Smad4 mutant were gifts from Dr. E. Nishida and Dr. R. Derynck, respectively. The reporter construct containing four copies of the AP-1 enhancer (pAP-1-Luc) was purchased from Clontech. Either one or both of the AP-1 consensus sites present at positions −473 (GGTGACAAACT) and −447 (CATGACTAAC) (Fig. 7 A) of p625NH-Luc were changed to TGctgAA using a two-step PCR strategy. Both strands of all the constructs were fully sequenced (Genome Express, Grenoble, France) to confirm the mutations before use. NCI H295R cells (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F12 medium supplemented with 2% Ultroser G (Invitrogen), 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, and 5 ng/ml sodium selenite (Sigma), 200 units/ml penicillin, 200 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2.5 mml-glutamine. Primary cultures of mouse astrocytes were obtained as follows. Brains from 3–4-day-old mice were dissected and crushed in minimum Eagle's medium. Cells were recovered by filtration through sterile filters (70-μm pores), resuspended in minimum Eagle's medium containing 25 mm Hepes, nonessential amino acids, and 10% fetal calf serum and plated out. Fibroblasts were allowed to adhere for 4 h, and any non-adhering astrocytes were replated on complete medium. To eliminate the influence of serum, NCI H295R cells were transferred into Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F12 medium supplemented with transferrin (5 μg/ml), selenium (5 ng/ml), 200 units/ml penicillin, 200 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2.5 mml-glutamine. All experiments were performed with cell lines obtained from passages 2–8 following thawing or with primary cultures from passage 2. Adrenocortical cell lines (NCI H295R) plated out at a density of 5 × 106cells per 100-mm dish were incubated in a serum-free medium for 24 h and then treated with TGFβ 1 (Sigma) or FGF2 (R&D Systems) or left untreated as indicated in the text. In some experiments, cycloheximide (10 μg/ml, Sigma) and actinomycin D (5 μg/ml, Sigma) were added to the medium 1 h before the addition of the growth factor. Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells by use of the acid-guanidium-thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Tri-Reagent, Sigma). Total RNA samples (10 μg) were loaded onto a 1% agarose-2.2 mol/liter formaldehyde gel, subjected to electrophoresis, and transferred onto nylon membranes. The membranes were hybridized as previously described with the 1.9-kb EcoRI novH probe or the 2.3-kbEcoRI-XhoI mouse nov (novM) probes (4Martinerie C. Huff V. Joubert I. Badzioch M. Saunders G. Strong L. Perbal B. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2729-2732Google Scholar, 10Chevalier G. Yeger H. Martinerie C. Laurent M. Alami J. Schofield P.N. Perbal B. Am. J.

Genomics. 1996; 38: 425-428Google Scholar) labeled by random hexamer priming (AmershamBiosciences) in the presence of [32P]dCTP. The signal fornovH or novM was normalized according to the intensity of the gapdh signal (Clontech). NCI H295R cells plated in 6-well plates (5 × 105 cells per well) were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) as described in the user's manual. For reporter assays, the reporter constructs (0.5 μg) were co-transfected with 0.1 μg of pCMV-β−galactosidase as an internal transfection control (Clontech). For assays in which the role of the transacting proteins was to be tested, 1.5 μg of the empty pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) vector or pcDNA3 encoding the protein of interest was used. In dose response experiments, the total amount of the expression vectors was kept constant by use of the empty vector. In each assay, cell cultures were serum starved prior to treatment with TGFβ1 (4 ng/ml) or FGF2 (10 ng/ml). Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were assayed by use of kits from Promega and PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Galacto-Star system), respectively. The data are presented as means ± S.E. of representative experiments performed in triplicate on at least two separate occasions. For the detection of endogenous NOV, cultured NCI H295R cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mg/ml aprotinin, 20 mg/ml leupeptin). For the detection of secreted NOV, proteins from conditioned medium corresponding to 2 × 105 cells (unless otherwise indicated) were collected after incubation overnight at 4 °C with heparin-Sepharose as described previously (10Chevalier G. Yeger H. Martinerie C. Laurent M. Alami J. Schofield P.N. Perbal B. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 1563-1575Google Scholar). Protein samples from the lysates (10 μg) or from the conditioned medium were subjected to electrophoresis in 12% reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gels before being transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Hybond P, Amersham Biosciences) for immunological detection. The membrane was incubated with the K19M anti-NOVH (1:500 dilution) polyclonal antibody (10Chevalier G. Yeger H. Martinerie C. Laurent M. Alami J. Schofield P.N. Perbal B. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 1563-1575Google Scholar) for 1 h at 37 °C. Immunoreactive proteins were detected by ECL (AmershamBiosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the detection of proteins encoded by transfected expression vectors, protein samples (40 μg) derived from the same cell lysates used for luciferase were subjected to immunoblotting. The anti-Myc (9E10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), monoclonal antibody was used to detect c-Myc-tagged Smad2, 3, and 4. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by ECL. JNK activity was determined as described previously (42Atfi A. Djelloul S. Chastre E. Davis R. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 17: 1429-1432Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5% deoxycholate, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10% glycerol. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and endogenous kinases were immunoprecipitated using anti-JNK (C-17; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody. Immune complexes were collected by binding to protein A-Sepharose and washed three times in lysis buffer and then twice with kinase assay buffer (25 mm Hepes, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 25 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μm sodium vanadate). JNK kinase was assayed for 20 min at 30 °C in 30 μl of a kinase reaction mixture containing 2 μg of GST-Jun (1–79; Biomol), 20 μm unlabeled ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was stopped by adding electrophoresis sample buffer, and proteins were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. Western blots were scanned with a GS700 imaging densitometer and processed with the Molecular Analyst data system (Bio-Rad). Northern blots were analyzed with a Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). NCI H295R cells are considered to be a good cellular model for adrenocortical tumors (24Logié A. Boulle N. Gaston V. Perin L. Boudou P., Le Bouc Y. Gicquel C. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 23: 23-32Google Scholar). To determine whether the expression of novH is influenced by environmental conditions, we used Western blotting to examine the amount of NOVH present in a conditioned medium when these cells were plated out at different densities. In serum-free medium, the amount of NOVH detected, corresponding to the same number of NCI H295R cells (105) tested, increased with cell density (Fig.1 A). The concentration of secreted NOVH also increased in the presence of serum (Fig.1 B). Thus, the production of NOVH in NCI H295R cells may be regulated by cell-cell contact and by growth factors present in serum. We next tried to identify growth factors that affect the production of NOVH in these cells. We focused on TGFβ1, FGF2, and IGFs because they play important roles in adrenocortical development and physiology (see Ref. 26Feige J.J. Vilgrain I. Brand C. Bailly S. Souchelnitskiy S. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 158: 7-19Google Scholar for a review). As shown in Fig.2, the amount of NOVH did not change following treatment with IGF-II or IGF-I; however, the amount of NOVH (in cell lysates or in medium) was decreased (∼ 80%) by TGFβ1 (4 ng/ml) and increased (∼3-fold) by FGF2 (10 ng/ml). The amount of NOVH increased only slightly in the presence of both factors, suggesting that TGFβ1 inhibits both basal and FGF2-induced expression of NOVH. The amount of novH mRNA was also affected by TGFβ1 and FGF2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3 A). Time-course experiments showed (Fig. 3 B) that novH down-regulation by TGFβ1 (4 ng/ml) was maximal after 24 h (72 ± 20%,n = 8), whereas stimulation by FGF2 (10 ng/ml) reached a maximum after 6 h, and this level was maintained for at least 24 h (2.5 ± 0.4-fold, n = 8). Next, we examined whether protein synthesis was required for the regulation of novH by TGFβ1 or FGF2 in NCI H295R. Pretreatment with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide 1 h before the addition of TGFβ1 or FGF2 did not block the effects of TGFβ1 but completely abolished the effects of FGF2 (Fig.4 A). Thus, TGFβ1 directly regulates the expression ofnovH, and FGF2 requires de novo protein synthesis, which could be rapidly induced. To gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms by which TGFβ1 and FGF2 regulate the amount of novH mRNA, we investigated the effects of these factors on the steady-state levels of transcripts. From Fig. 4 B it can be seen that when transcription was blocked with actinomycin D for 9 h, the basal level of novH mRNA decreased (∼3-fold), indicating that the half-life of novHtranscripts is less than 9 h in these cells. Under these conditions, TGFβ1 and FGF2 did not significantly modulate the inhibitory effect of actinomycin D. This is consistent with the hypothesis that these factors regulate the expression ofnovH at the transcriptional level. To better understand the mechanism by which TGFβ1 and FGF2 regulate the transcriptional activity of novH, we analyzed their effects on the novH promoter fused to the luciferase reporter gene in transient transfections in NCI H295R cells. We assessed the regulation of three different promoter constructs, p2540NH-Luc (−2540 to +87), p625NH-Luc (−625 to +87), and p492NH-Luc (−492 to +87) by TGFβ1 and FGF2 (Fig. 5 A). Treatment of all three constructs with TGFβ1 resulted in ∼50% inhibition, and treatment with FGF2 resulted in ∼150% stimulation (Fig.5, B and C). Thus, the promoter region between −2540 and −492 is not involved in the regulation of novH expression by these two factors. Furthermore, the stimulatory effect of FGF2 on p625NH-Luc promoter activity was reduced following the addition of TGFβ1 (Fig.5 D), which is consistent with our results for the endogenous NOVH. Therefore, we carefully examined the promoter region beyond position −492 to try to identify any specific cis-acting elements that could be involved in the regulation of novH by TGFβ1 and FGF2. We also investigated the ability of TGFβ1 and FGF2 to modulate the expression of nov in cells from other species. Using primary cultures of mouse astrocytes, we observed that FGF2 had no effect, whereas TGFβ1 also decreased the amount of nov RNA in these mouse cells (Fig. 6). Therefore, we compared the sequences of the human (novH) and murine (novM) promoter sequences (Fig.7 A). We found two consensus sequences corresponding to AP-1 binding sites in the novHpromoter region (at positions −473 and −447). Interestingly, these sequences were also present in the novM promoter region. The AP-1 family of transcription factors is implicated in various regulatory activities of TGFβ1 (44Chung K. Agarwal A.

To determine the role of AP-1 in the regulation of novexpression by TGFβ1 and FGF2, we used site-directed mutagenesis to alter the AP-1 sites (Fig. 7 B). Each of the point mutations resulted in a substantial decrease in basal promoter activity (∼4–5-fold) when these constructs were used to transfect NCI H295R. No further effect was observed when both AP-1 sites were mutated simultaneously (Fig. 7, B and C). As show"

To look for additional functions of POB1, we screened for POB1-binding proteins using a yeast two-hybrid method and found that POB1 interacts with mouse ASAP1, which is a human PAG2 homolog. PAG2 is a paxillin-associated protein with ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase-activating protein activity. POB1 formed a complex with PAG2 in intact cells. The carboxyl-terminal region containing the proline-rich motifs of POB1 directly bound to the carboxyl-terminal region including the SH3 domain of PAG2. Substitutions of Pro423 and Pro426 with Ala (POB1(PA)) impaired the binding of POB1 to PAG2. Expression of PAG2 inhibited fibronectin-dependent migration and paxillin recruitment to focal contacts of CHO-IR cells. Co-expression with POB1 but not with POB1(PA) suppressed the inhibitory action of PAG2 on cell migration and paxillin localization. These results suggest that POB1 interacts with PAG2 through its proline-rich motif, thereby regulating cell migration. POB1 was previously identified as a RalBP1-binding protein.

POB1 has a single EH domain in its amino-terminal region and proline-rich motifs and a coiled-coil structure in its carboxyl-terminal region. The EH domain has been initially identified as a repeated sequence present in three copies in the amino-terminal region of Eps15 and of the related molecule Eps15R, two substrates of the EGF receptor kinase (3Fazioli F.

Intersectin (Ese) has five SH3 domains in addition to two EH domains and is involved in the regulation of internalization of the transferrin receptor (11Yamabhai M. Hoffman N.G. Hardison N.L.

Because the binding sites of Ral and POB1 on RalBP1 are different, these three proteins form a ternary complex. EGF stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of POB1 and induces the complex formation between EGF receptor and POB1 (2Ikeda M. Ishida O. Hinoi T. Kishida S. Kikuchi A. J. Biol.

Expression of the EH domain or the carboxyl-terminal region of POB1 inhibits the internalization of EGF and insulin (18Nakashima S. Morinaka K. Koyama S. Ikeda M. Kishida M. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kishida S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3629-3642Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is conceivable that Ral, RalBP1, and POB1 regulate receptor-mediated endocytosis by transmitting the signal from receptors to Eps15 and Epsin. The Arf family of small G proteins is divided into three classes based largely on sequence similarity: class I (Arfs 1–3), class II (Arfs 4 and 5), and class III (Arf6) (24Tsuchiya M. Price S.R. Tsai S.C. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2772-2777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By linking GTP binding and hydrolysis, Arfs regulate membrane trafficking at various steps (25Boman A.L. Kahn R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 147-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar,26Taylor T.C. Kahn R.A. Melancon P. Cell. 1992; 70: 69-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For instance, Arf6 has been implicated in the regulation of membrane trafficking between the plasma membrane and a specialized endocytic component. Moreover, its function has been linked to cytoskeletal reorganization (27Franco M. Peters P.J. Boretto J. van Donselaar E. Neri A. D'Souza-Schorey C. Chavrier P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1480-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 28Song J. Khachikian Z. Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2257-2267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As with other small G proteins, the activity of Arfs is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GAPs. It has been shown that ArfGAP is involved in regulating the organization of focal adhesions (29Turner C.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E231-E236Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 30Turner C.E. West K.A. Brown M.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Evidence for a direct link between Arf signaling and focal adhesions came initially from the identification of the ArfGAP protein as a paxillin-binding protein. There are several ArfGAP families. All ArfGAP proteins share homology within the zinc-finger-containing ArfGAP domain and ankyrin repeat region. Among ArfGAP family proteins, PAG3 contains a pleckstrin homology domain in an extended amino terminus and has a proline-rich sequence followed by an SH3 domain at the carboxyl terminus (31Kondo A. Hashimoto S. Yano H. Nagayama K. Mazaki Y. Sabe H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). PAG3 binds to paxillin and serves as a GAP for Arf6. Overexpression of PAG3 in fibroblasts inhibits cell motility and reduces the paxillin recruitment to focal contacts in a GAP-dependent manner (31Kondo A. Hashimoto S. Yano H. Nagayama K. Mazaki Y. Sabe H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These results suggest that PAG3 plays a role in mediating changes in cell motility. To find additional functions of POB1, we screened proteins that bind to POB1. Here we report that the proline-rich domain of POB1 interacts with the SH3 domain of PAG2, a PAG3 homolog. Furthermore, we show that the functional interaction of POB1 with PAG2 may regulate cell migration. These results suggest that POB1 and PAG2 link the processes of endocytosis and cell motility. Recombinant baculovirus expressing GST-POB1 was provided by Dr. Y. Matsuura (Research Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases, Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University). Hygromycin-resistant CHO-IR cells that stably express POB1, PAG2, or their mutants were propagated as described (32Okazaki M. Kishida S. Murai H. Hinoi T. Kikuchi A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2387-2392PubMed Google Scholar). CHO-IR cells stably expressing both POB1 and PAG2, both POB1P423A/P426A and PAG2, or both POB1 and PAG2-(1–703) were generated by selecting with Blasticidin. The rabbit polyclonal anti-GST and anti-MBP antibodies were made by a standard method. The rabbit polyclonal anti-POB1 and anti-PAG2 antibodies were prepared by immunization with recombinant POB1-(322–521) and GST-PAG2-(935–1002), respectively. The mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody 12CA5 was kindly provided by Dr. Q. Hu (Chiron Corp., Emeryville, CA). The rabbit polyclonal anti-PAG3 antibody was prepared as described (31Kondo A. Hashimoto S. Yano H. Nagayama K. Mazaki Y. Sabe H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody was prepared from 9E10 cells. GST and MBP fusion proteins were purified from Escherichia coli according to the manufacturer's instructions. GST-POB1 was purified from Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf) 9 cells. Other materials were from commercial sources. Standard recombinant DNA techniques were used to construct the following plasmids. To construct pGBKT7/POB1-(321–521), pUC19/POB1 was digested with EcoRI and the 0.57-kb fragment was inserted in EcoRI-cut pGBKT7. To construct pBj-Myc/ASAP1-(1050–1147), pACT2/ASAP1-(1050–1147) was digested with SmaI and BglII, and the 0.3-kb fragment was inserted into XbaI-cut, Klenow fragment-blunted, and BamHI-cut pBj-Myc. To construct pUC19/POB1P423A/P426A, the 0.51-kb fragment encoding POB1-(321–494), in which Pro423 and Pro426were mutated to Ala, was synthesized by PCR, digested withBglII and SacI, and inserted intoBglII- and SacI-cut pUC19/POB1 (full-length). To construct pCGN/ POB1P423A/P426A, pUC19/POB1P423A/P426A was digested with EcoRI, blunted with Klenow fragment, and digested with PmaCI. The resultant fragment was inserted into SmaI-cut pCGN/POB1 (full-length). To construct pGEX-KG/POB1-(322–521)P423A/P426A, pUC19/POB1P423A/P426A was digested withBglII and EcoRI, and the 0.59-kb fragment was inserted with BamHI- and EcoRI-cut pGEX-KG. To construct pEGFP-c2/POB1P423A/P426A, pUC19/POB1P423A/P426A was digested with EcoRI and the 1.56-kb fragment was inserted into EcoRI-cut pEGFP-c2. To construct pGEX-KG/POB1-(322–421), pGEX-KG/POB1-(422–521), and pGEX-KG/POB1-(429–521), the 0.3-kb fragment encoding POB1-(322–421), the 0.3-kb fragment encoding POB1-(422–521), and the 0.3-kb fragment encoding POB1-(429–521), respectively, were synthesized by PCR. The synthesized fragments were digested with BamHI and EcoRI, and inserted into BamHI- and EcoRI-cut pGEX-KG. To construct pEGFP-c2/POB1, pUC19/POB1 was digested with EcoRI and the 1.56-kb fragment was inserted into EcoRI-cut pEGFP-c2. The construction of pEBG/PAG2 and pEGFP-c1/PAG2 will be described elsewhere. To construct pGEX-KG/PAG2-(1002–1132), pEBG/PAG2 was digested with NotI, which was blunted with Klenow fragment and digested with NheI. The resultant 0.39-kb fragment was inserted into NcoI-cut, blunted with Klenow fragment, and XbaI-cut pGEX-KG. To construct pMAL-c2/PAG2-(1002–1132), pGEX-KG/PAG2-(1002–1132) was digested withBamHI and SalI, and the resultant 0.39-kb fragment was inserted into BamHI- and SalI-cut pMAL-c2. The entire PCR products were sequenced, and the structures of all plasmids were confirmed by restriction analyses. pGEX-2T/POB1-(1–125), pGEX-2T/POB1-(126–227), pGEX-2T/POB1-(228–406), pGEX-2T/POB1-(322–521), pGEX-2T/RalBP1-(364–647), pMAL-c2/RalBP1-(364–647), pCGN/POB1, pGEX-2T/paxillin α, and pBJ-Myc/RalBP1 were constructed as described (2Ikeda M.

Yeast strain Y190 was used as a host for the two-hybrid screening (CLONTECH Laboratories Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Yeast cells were grown on rich medium (YAPD) containing 2% glucose, 2% Bact-peptone, 1% Bact-yeast extract, and 0.002% adenine sulfate. Yeast transformations were performed by the lithium acetate method. Transformants were selected on SD medium containing 2% glucose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, and necessary supplements. Y190 strain carrying pGBKT7/POB1-(321–521), in which POB1-(321–521) was expressed as a fusion protein with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain, was transformed with a mouse brain cDNA library constructed in pACT2, in which cDNA was expressed as a fusion protein with the GAL4 activator domain. Approximately 1.6 × 106 transformants were screened for the growth on SD plate medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine as evidenced by transactivation of a GAL4-HIS3 reporter gene and histidine prototrophy. His+ colonies were scored for β-galactosidase activity. Plasmids harboring cDNAs were recovered from positive colonies and introduced by electroporation into E. coli HB101 on M9 plates lacking leucine. HB101 is leuB−, and this defect can be complemented by the LEU2 gene in the library plasmids. The library plasmids were then recovered from HB101 and transformed into Y190 containing pGBKT7/POB1-(321–521). The nucleotide sequence of the plasmid cDNAs, which conferred the LacZ+ phenotype on Y190 containing pGBKT7/POB1-(321–521), was determined. CHO-IR cells or COS cells (6-cm diameter dishes) transfected with pCGN-, pEBG-, and pBJ-Myc-derived plasmids were lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin) as described (18Nakashima S. Morinaka K. Koyama S. Ikeda M. Kishida M. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kishida S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3629-3642Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The lysates (200 μg of protein) were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Myc, anti-HA, or anti-POB1 antibody, or precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B. The precipitates were washed once with 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 137 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol, twice with 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.5 m LiCl, and once with 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5. The precipitates were probed with the anti-PAG2, anti-PAG3, anti-POB1, anti-HA, anti-Myc, and anti-GST antibodies. Where specified, the lysates of the cells expressing GST-PAG2, HA-POB1, and Myc-RalBP1 were used. To examine whether paxillin interacts with the complex of PAG2 and POB1, CHO-IR cells (10-cm diameter plate) expressing HA-POB1 and/or GFP-PAG2 were lysed in 0.25 ml of lysis buffer. The lysates (480 μg of protein) were incubated with 5 μg of GST-paxillin α immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B for 1 h at 4 °C. After glutathione-Sepharose 4B was precipitated by centrifugation, the precipitates were probed with the anti-GFP and anti-HA antibodies. When the complex formation of POB1 with PAG3 was examined, 293 cells (6-cm diameter dishes) were lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer. The lysates (180 μg of protein) were immunoprecipitated with the anti-POB1 antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were probed with the anti-PAG3 and anti-POB1 antibodies. Various GST-fused POB1 deletion mutants (0.5 μm each) were incubated with 20 pmol of MBP-PAG2-(1002–1132) immobilized on amylose resin in 100 μl of reaction mixture (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 1 h at 4 °C. After the resin was precipitated by centrifugation, the precipitates were probed with the anti-GST antibody. To show the simultaneous binding of PAG2 to POB1 and paxillin in vitro, 0.5 μm GST-POB1-(322–521) and/or 1–4 μm GST-paxillin were incubated with 20 pmol of MBP-PAG2-(1002–1132) or MBP immobilized on amylose resin in 100 μl of reaction mixture (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 1 h at 4 °C. After the resin was precipitated by centrifugation, the precipitates were probed with the anti-GST antibody. The binding of MBP-PAG2-(1002–1132) to GST-POB1 was investigated by real-time SPR spectroscopy (BIACORE X, BIAcore System, Uppsala, Sweden). Measurements were performed at 25 °C in HBS-EP buffer (10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% polysorbate 20) at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. GST-POB1 was coupled to a CM5 sensor tip in amounts to yield 800 resonance units (RU) (1 RU is equal to 1 pg/mm2), via the goat anti-GST antibody that was covalently coupled to the surface of the sensor tip by standard amine-coupling chemistry. GST was coupled to the reference cell. MBP-PAG2-(1002–1132) was injected for 180 s followed by elution in HBS-EP buffer for 180 s. The observed changes in the relative diffraction indices, which represents the mass on the sensor tip surface, were recorded as a function of time. The value obtained from the reference cell, which represented nonspecific binding of MBP fusion proteins to GST, was subtracted from that with GST-POB1. Association and dissociation constants of the PAG2-POB1 complex were calculated using the BIAevaluation program version 3.1 (BIAcore).K d was calculated by fitting the data to the equation K d =kd/ka. The CHO-IR cells (5 × 104) were added to a 96-well dish that was precoated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin or BSA in PBS for 2 h. After 30 min of incubation, the cells were washed with PBS three times. Adherent cells were then fixed and stained with 0.1% crystal violet in 20% methanol for 5 min at room temperature and were washed with PBS extensively. The stain was eluted with 100 μl of 50% ethanol, and the absorbance at 590 nm was measured as described (37Suzuki J. Yamazaki Y., Li, G. Kaziro Y. Koide H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4658-4665Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The cell migration assay was performed using a modified Boyden chamber (tissue culture treated, 6.5-mm diameter, 10-μm thickness, 8-μm pore; Transwell, Costar, Cambridge, MA) as described (38Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). In brief, only the underside surface of the polycarbonate membrane on the upper chamber was coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin or BSA in PBS for 2 h. After the chamber was rinsed with PBS, it was placed into the lower chamber filled with 400 μl of Ham's F-12 medium containing 1% fetal calf serum. CHO-IR cells (2.5 × 104) suspended in the Ham's F-12 medium containing 0.1% BSA at 2.5 × 105 cells/ml were applied to the upper chamber and allowed to migrate to the underside of the upper chamber for 3 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. After the nonmigrated cells on the upper membrane surface were removed with a cotton swab, cells that migrated to the underside of the upper chamber were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and were stained with propidium-iodide solution. The number of the stained cells was counted and percent cell migration was calculated by dividing the number of stained cells by the number of applied cells. The CHO-IR cells expressing GST-PAG2, GFP-POB1, or GFP-POB1(PA) were grown on coverslips and then fixed for 20 min in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were washed with PBS three times and then permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2 mg/ml BSA for 20 min. They were washed and incubated for 1 h with the mouse monoclonal anti-paxillin and rabbit polyclonal anti-GST antibodies. After being washed with PBS, the cells were further incubated for 1 h with Cy5-labeled anti-mouse IgG and Cy3-labeled anti-rabbit IgG. The coverslips were washed with PBS and mounted on glass slides, and the fluorescence of Cy5, Cy3, and GFP was viewed with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM510, Carl-Zeiss, Jena, Germany). To determine the effects of POB1 on the inhibitory action of PAG2 for the paxillin recruitment to focal contacts, the number of cells where paxillin was recruited to focal contacts was divided by the total number of the cells counted. Approximately 100–300 cells were examined in each experiment. Various constructs used in this study are shown in Fig.1. To discover new functions of POB1, we attempted to identify POB1-binding protein(s). We screened a mouse brain cDNA library by the yeast two-hybrid method using the carboxyl-terminal region of POB1 (POB1-(322–521)) as bait. Several clones were found to confer both His+ and LacZ+phenotypes, and three of them overlapped, encoding the carboxyl-terminal region of mouse ASAP1 (ASAP1-(1050–1147)). ASAP1 has been identified as an ArfGAP and contains a zinc finger domain similar to that required for GAP activity for Arf (39Brown M.T. Andrade J. Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. Cooper J.A. Randazzo P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7038-7051Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). ASAP1 also contains a number of domains that are likely to be involved in regulation and/or localization: a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, three ankyrin (ANK) repeats, a proline-rich region, and an SH3 domain. To examine whether POB1 forms a complex with ASAP1 in intact cells, we expressed HA-POB1 and Myc-ASAP1-(1050–1147) in COS cells. When the lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Myc antibody, HA-POB1 was detected in the Myc-ASAP1-(1050–1147) immune complexes under the conditions that HA-POB1 formed a complex with Myc-RalBP1 (Fig.2 A). Previously we isolated PAG2 and PAG3 as paxillin-binding proteins (31Kondo A. Hashimoto S. Yano H. Nagayama K. Mazaki Y. Sabe H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Because human PAG2 has a higher homology with mouse ASAP1 (95% identity) than human PAG3 does (58% identity), we examined whether POB1 interacts with full-length PAG2 in intact cells. GST-PAG2 was expressed in CHO-IR cells stably expressing HA-POB1 (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1 and2). When the lysates of CHO-IR cells expressing both GST-PAG2 and HA-POB1 were precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose, HA-POB1 was co-precipitated with GST-PAG2 (Fig. 2 B,lanes 3 and 4).Figure 2Complex formation of POB1 with PAG2 in intact cells. A, interaction of POB1 with ASAP1. Lysates of COS cells expressing HA-POB1 alone (lane 2), HA-POB1 and Myc-RalBP1 (lane 3), or HA-POB1 and Myc-ASAP1-(1050–1147) (lane 4) were probed with the anti-HA and anti-Myc antibodies. The same lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Myc antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were probed with the anti-Myc and anti-HA antibodies (lanes 5–7). The lysates of COS cells transfected with empty vectors were used as a control (lane 1). B, interaction of POB1 with PAG2. GST-PAG2 was transiently expressed in CHO-IR cells stably expressing HA-POB1, and the lysates were probed with the anti-GST and anti-HA antibodies (lanes 1 and 2). The same lysates were precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose, and the precipitates were probed with the anti-GST and anti-HA antibodies (lanes 3 and4). C, complex formation of POB1 with PAG2 or PAG3 at endogenous level. The lysates of CHO-IR cells (lanes 1–3) or 293 cells (lanes 4–6) were probed with the anti-PAG2 and anti-POB1 antibodies (lane 1) or the anti-PAG3 and anti-POB1 antibodies (lane 4). The same lysates were immunoprecipitated with pre-immune serum (lanes 2 and5) or the anti-POB1 antibody (lanes 3 and6), and the immunoprecipitates were probed with the anti-PAG2 and anti-POB1 antibodies (lanes 2 and3) or the anti-PAG3 and anti-POB1 antibodies (lanes 5 and 6).

When the lysates of CHO-IR cells were immunoprecipitated with the anti-POB1 antibody, PAG2 was detected in the POB1 immune complex (Fig. 2 C, lanes 1–3). We also examined whether endogenous PAG3 interacted with endogenous POB1 in intact cells. Because PAG3 was expressed only slightly in CHO-IR cells, we used 293 cells. Endogenous PAG3 was observed in the POB1 immune complex from 293 cells (Fig. 2 C, lanes 4–6). These results indicate that POB1 forms a complex with PAG2 and PAG3 in intact cells at endogenous levels. To examine whether POB1 directly interacts with PAG2, GST-POB1 (full-length) was purified from Sf9 cells. Because it was difficult to purify full-length PAG2, PAG2-(1002–1132), which corresponds to ASAP1-(1050–1147), was purified as an MBP fusion protein. GST-POB1 was precipitated with MBP-PAG2-(1002–1132) but not with MBP (Fig.3 A). These results indicate that POB1 binds to PAG2 directly.

In solution, linker flexibility results in an ill defined orientation of the two globular domains relative to one another. We have previously shown a decrease in linker flexibility in response to cardiac troponin I (cTnI) binding. To investigate the relative orientation of calcium-saturated TnC domains when bound to cTnI, 1H-15N residual dipolar couplings were measured in two different alignment media. Similarity in alignment tensor orientation for the two TnC domains supports restriction of domain motion in the presence of cTnI. The relative spatial orientation of TnC domains bound to TnI was calculated from measured residual dipolar couplings and long-range distance restraints utilizing a rigid body molecular dynamics protocol. The relative domain orientation is such that hydrophobic pockets face each other, forming a latch to constrain separate helical segments of TnI. We have utilized this structure to successfully explain the observed functional consequences of linker region deletion mutants. Together, these studies suggest that, although linker plasticity is important, the ability of TnC to function in muscle contraction can be correlated with a preferred domain orientation and interdomain distance.

The troponin complex consists of three proteins, troponin T, troponin I (TnI),1 and troponin C (TnC). Troponin T interacts with tropomyosin and has been implicated in transmission of the contraction signal along the thin filament. TnI, the inhibitory subunit, has extensive contacts with TnC and actin and is responsible for inhibition of the actin-myosin interaction. The cardiac isoform of TnI (cTnI) differs from the skeletal isoform (sTnI) primarily by the presence of a 20–32-residue-long extension at the amino terminus (1Moir A.J. Perry S.V. Biochem. J. 1977; 167: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This cardiac-specific extension contains two adjacent protein kinase A phosphorylation sites that play a role in modulating contraction in response to β-adrenergic stimulation. TnC, the protein responsible for detection of the calcium signal and initiation of muscle contraction, consists of two globular domains separated by a flexible linker. In both skeletal (sTnC) and cardiac (cTnC) TnC (des-Met1,Ala2, C35S), the C-terminal domain contains two high affinity Ca2+/Mg2+-binding sites (III and IV) and anchors TnC in the complex. The N-terminal domain also contains two EF-hand motifs that have high specificity, but a lower affinity for Ca2+ (2Potter J.D. Hsu F.J. Pownall H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2452-2454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the cardiac isoform, Ca2+-binding site I is inactivated by substitution of key metal-binding ligands and an amino acid insertion (3Van Eerd J.P. Takahashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 64: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In the absence of bound Ca2+, the regulatory domain is in the inactive or “closed” conformation. Binding of Ca2+to the sTnC regulatory domain induces an opening of the regulatory domain and increased exposure of a hydrophobic pocket, the proposed binding site for the regulatory region of TnI (4Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In the cardiac isoform, the presence of both Ca2+ and the cTnI regulatory region appears necessary to stabilize a more “open” conformation with increased exposure of the hydrophobic pocket (4Li M.X.

A complete description of the solution structure for Ca2+-saturated TnC bound to full-length TnI requires collection of both long-range distance and orientation restraints. In this study, orientation restraints were extracted from1H-15N residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) measured by partially orienting Ca2+-saturated [2H,15N]TnC·cTnI in two different alignment media. RDCs in combination with cTnC domain structures (4Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 12Gasmi-Seabrook G.M. Howarth J.W.

Reson. 1998; 133: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) were used to elucidate the Ca2+-saturated cTnC structure in the cTnC·cTnI complex. [2H,15N]cTnC·cTnI were expressed and purified, and the cTnC·cTnI complex was prepared as previously described (8Abbott M.B. Dong W.J. Dvoretsky A. DaGue B. Caprioli R.M. Cheung H.C. Rosevear P.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5992-6001Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). NMR samples of Ca2+-saturated [2H,15N]cTnC·cTnI (0.4–0.6 mm) were prepared in buffer containing 10% 2H2O, 20 mm Tris-d 11 (pH 6.8), 500 mm KCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm Pefabloc, and 0.1 mm leupeptin. Pf1 filamentous phage was prepared as described previously (16Hansen M.R. Hanson P. Pardi A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 317: 220-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alignment of the medium was confirmed by observation of the quadrupole splitting of the2H2O signal. Typically, phage was titrated into the protein sample until a 2H2O splitting of ∼30 Hz was achieved. Nonionic liquid-crystalline medium consisting ofn-alkylpoly(ethylene glycol)/n-alkyl alcohol (C12E5/n-hexanol) was prepared as described previously (13Rückert M. Otting G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 7793-7797Crossref Scopus (538) Google Scholar) at a final molar ratio of ∼0.96. Typically, Ca2+-saturated cTnC·cTnI complexes (0.4–0.6 mm) were made 4.5% in C12E5/n-hexanol lamellar phase. Experiments were carried out on a Varian Inova 800-MHz spectrometer. The temperature was set at 38 °C for the Ca2+-saturated cTnC·cTnI complex in 4.5% C12E5/n-hexanol and at 40 °C for the Ca2+-saturated cTnC·cTnI complex in Pf1 phage liquid-crystalline solvent. 1H-15N correlation experiments utilized sensitivity-enhanced1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence-based pulse sequences (14Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarinen T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10663-10665Crossref Scopus (2407) Google Scholar), and RDCs were measured using a gradient α/β-transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy experiment (15Andersson P. Annila A. Otting G. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 133: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Typically, transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy-based experiments were performed using spectral widths of 12,000 and 2500 Hz for1H(t 1) and15N(t 2) with corresponding acquisition times of 170 and 44 ms, respectively. Data were processed using a 90° shifted sine-squared apodization inF 1(1H) andF 2(15N). The time domain data int 1 were extended using forward/backward linear prediction to 220 points and then zero-filled to 1024 points. The time domain data in t 2 were zero-filled to 4096 points. Dipolar contributions to the 1H-15N couplings were obtained from differences in couplings observed in partially oriented and non-oriented samples. Starting coordinates for the cTnC solution structure determination were created by merging coordinates for the solution structure of Ca2+-saturated cTnC-(1–89) bound to cTnI-(147–163) (Protein Data Bank code 1MXL) (4Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) with coordinates for the solution structure of Ca2+-saturated cTnC-(81–161) bound to cTnI-(33–80) (Protein Data Bank code 1FI5) (12Gasmi-Seabrook G.M. Howarth J.W. Finley N. Abusamhadneh E. Gaponenko V. Brito R.M. Solaro R.J. Rosevear P.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8313-8322Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), which had been further refined. 2N. Finley, unpublished data. To ensure sampling of all possible domain orientations, seven starting structures having extended conformations with different N- and C-terminal domain orientations were generated. Residues in the linker region (positions 84–92) were treated as rigid bodies separated by the known distance between consecutive residues assuming planar andtrans-peptide bonds. Rigid body minimization was used to evaluate relative domain orientation by simultaneously minimizing the N- and C-terminal domains to the experimentally measured RDCs recorded in two different alignment media. A long-range fluorescence resonance energy transfer-derived restraint of 48 Å from the thiol proton of Cys35 to Tb3+ bound at site III (17Dong W.J. Robinson J.M. Xing J. Umeda P.K. Cheung H.C. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and a radius of gyration restraint of 23.9 ± 0.5 Å derived from neutron scattering (18Olah G.A. Rokop S.E. Wang C.L. Blechner S.L. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8233-8239Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) were used to tether the two domains together. Calculations were carried out in XPLOR (19Brunger A.T. XPLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar), modified to incorporate refinement against RDC restraints (20Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Tjandra N. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 131: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) using rigid body minimization and constrained/restrained annealing protocols (21Wang G. Louis J.M. Sondej M. Seok Y.J. Peterkofsky A. Clore G.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5635-5649Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Structures with the lowest energy were selected for further refinement. Constrained/restrained simulated annealing was performed in several stages to further refine the domain-oriented conformation of Ca2+-saturated cTnC bound to cTnI. A mock crystal symmetry molecule was used to generate artificial crystal symmetry restraints, preventing rotation of cTnC domains relative to each other during the remainder of the refinement process. Initially, the linker region was refined using peptide bond distance restraints and Ramachandran-based dihedral restraints. The C-terminal domain of cTnC was then subjected to simulated annealing using the RDCs together with published nuclear Overhauser effect and dihedral restraints collected for the cTnC-(81–161)·cTnI-(33–80) complex (12Gasmi-Seabrook G.M. Howarth J.W. Finley N. Abusamhadneh E. Gaponenko V. Brito R.M. Solaro R.J. Rosevear P.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8313-8322Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The resulting structure was then passed through this procedure again, except that the C-terminal domain was treated as a rigid body, whereas the N-terminal domain was subjected to constrained/restrained simulated annealing using the residual RDCs together with published nuclear Overhauser effect and dihedral restraints for the N-terminal domain in the cTnC-(1–89)·cTnI-(147–163) complex (4Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (code1LA0). Relative cTnC domain orientation was described in terms of three consecutive rotations defined as bend, azimuth, and twist. The bend is defined as the angle between the D-helix (residues 73–83) and E-helix (residues 95–105). The azimuth of the bend was calculated relative to the orientation of sTnI-(3–33) bound to the C-terminal domain of sTnC in the crystal structure of sTnC·sTnI-(1–47) (Protein Data Bank code 1A2X) (11Vassylyev D.G. Takeda S. Wakatsuki S. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4847-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The cross-product of unit vectors along the bend (E-helix) and azimuth axis defines the twist axis, rotation about which completes the transformation. The azimuth axis was fully orthogonalized using the cross-product between the bend and the twist axis as the final azimuth axis. To model the structural consequences of progressive deletions within the cTnC linker region, the structure of cTnC bound to cTnI (Protein Data Bank code 1LA0) was used as a template. Two 7-residue deletion models were created by removal of amino acids corresponding to residues 90–96 and 86–92 from cTnC. The remaining linker residues were treated as rigid bodies separated by the known distance between consecutive residues assuming planar andtrans-peptide bonds. Nine- and 12-amino acid deletions corresponding to residues 88–96 and 85–96 of cTnC, respectively, were also constructed. To provide additional linker flexibility in the 12-amino acid deletion mutant, residues 81–83 were treated as rigid bodies in the rigid body minimization procedure. For each linker region deletion mutant constructed, rigid body minimization was used to determine cTnC domain orientation and position as described for full-length cTnC. A constrained/restrained simulated annealing algorithm was subsequently used to refine suitable low energy structures as described for full-length cTnC. Amide 1H and 15N resonance assignments for Ca2+-saturated [2H,15N]cTnC·cTnI in Pf1 filamentous phage or C12E5/n-hexanol were transferred from previously published assignments for Ca2+-saturated cTnC bound to cTnI (8Abbott M.B. Dong W.J. Dvoretsky A. DaGue B. Caprioli R.M. Cheung H.C. Rosevear P.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5992-6001Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Comparison of Ca2+-saturated cTnC chemical shifts in oriented and non-oriented cTnC·cTnI complexes showed minimal chemical shift perturbations due to the presence of the alignment media (data not shown). The absence of substantial chemical shift changes suggests that the cTnI-bound structure of cTnC is unaffected by addition of the alignment media. In the Pf1 filamentous phage liquid-crystalline medium, a total of 36 and 29 RDCs were measured in the N- and C-terminal domains of cTnC bound to cTnI, respectively. In the lamellar phase produced with C12E5/n-hexanol, 23 and 30 RDCs were measured in the N- and C-terminal domains of cTnC, respectively. In each alignment medium, a combination of resonance overlap, signal/noise, and line broadening prevented measurement of additional1H-15N RDCs. The magnitude of the principal axis and the rhombicity of the alignment tensors were estimated from the distribution of the dipolar couplings (22Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 133: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Values of −9.5 Hz for the magnitude of the principal axis of the alignment tensor and 30% rhombicity were estimated from RDCs measured in C12E5/n-hexanol lamellar phase. Similarly, values of −6.5 Hz and 25% for the magnitude and rhombicity, respectively, were estimated from RDCs measured in the Pf1 filamentous phage medium. Estimated alignment tensor parameters were used with experimentally measured RDCs to determine the relative cTnC domain orientation in the presence of cTnI. To avoid the multiple minima associated with using RDCs for solution structure determination (23Al-Hashimi H.M. Valafar H. Terrell M. Zartler E.R. Eidsness M.K. Prestegard J.H. J. Magn. Reson. 2000; 143: 402-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), an initial model was constructed for cTnC bound to cTnI from the domain solution structures using Ca2+-saturated cTnC-(1–89)·cTnI-(147–163) (Protein Data Bank code 1MXL) (4Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) for the N-terminal domain and Ca2+-saturated cTnC-(81–161)·cTnI-(33–80) (Protein Data Bank code 1FI5) (12Gasmi-Seabrook G.M. Howarth J.W. Finley N. Abusamhadneh E. Gaponenko V. Brito R.M. Solaro R.J. Rosevear P.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8313-8322Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) for the C-terminal domain. The RDC data, collected in both the C12E5/n-hexanol and Pf1 filamentous phage liquid-crystalline media, fit the cTnC N-terminal domain structure with an R-factor of 26%. Similarly, the RDC data collected in the C12E5/n-hexanol and Pf1 filamentous phage liquid-crystalline media fit the cTnC C-terminal domain structure with R-factors of 26 and 31%, respectively. The reasonable fit of experimentally measured RDCs in intact cTnC bound to cTnI with solution structures of the individual cTnC domains justified use of the individual domain structures as starting points in the structure determination of cTnC bound to cTnI. Rigid body minimization was used to determine the relative domain orientation by simultaneously minimizing the N- and C-terminal domains to the experimentally measured RDCs recorded in both alignment media. In addition, the overall shape of cTnC was constrained using long-range distance restraints obtained from the radius of gyration derived from neutron scattering data (18Olah G.A. Rokop S.E. Wang C.L. Blechner S.L. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8233-8239Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and an interdomain fluorescence resonance energy transfer distance (17Dong W.J. Robinson J.M. Xing J. Umeda P.K. Cheung H.C. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The inclusion of RDC data from two different alignment media does not completely eliminate the degeneracy in determining relative domain orientation. From seven initial starting structures, two different ensembles were obtained. In each ensemble, both sets of RDCs were simultaneously satisfied. In one ensemble, the linker region was significantly distorted, resulting in unfavorable backbone conformations as a consequence of simultaneously satisfying long-range distance restraints. Thus, structures within this ensemble were not further refined. The remaining ensemble of cTnC domain-oriented structures was further refined, with a mock crystal symmetry molecule to prevent domain rotation, using a constrained/restrained simulated annealing algorithm (24Clore G.M. Bewley C.A. J. Magn. Reson. 2002; 154: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This permitted refinement of individual domain structures and minimization of the linker region against experimentally determined RDCs without significantly altering domain orientation. The cTnI-bound cTnC structure was refined to R-factors of 15 and 22% for RDCs collected in the lamellar phase and Pf1 filamentous phage, respectively (Fig. 1). The average domain-oriented solution structure for Ca2+-saturated cTnC bound to cTnI is shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2depicts a structure in which the hydrophobic pockets in each domain face each other and act as a latch to constrain separate regions of the cTnI molecule. The quality of the average cTnC domain-oriented structure bound to cTnI was further examined using PROCHECK (25Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4282) Google Scholar). Residues in both domains show good covalent geometries with well defined secondary structures, having 97% of residues in the most favorable and allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot.Figure 2Surface representation of Ca2+-saturated cTnC bound to cTnI. Hydrophobic surface area is shown in yellow. The cTnI regulatory and N-terminal domain helices are shown in magenta andblue, respectively. cTnI peptides were modeled using the structures of cTnC-(1–89) bound to cTnI-(147–163) (Protein Data Bank code 1MXL) and sTnC bound to sTnI-(1–47) (Protein Data Bank code1A2X).

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8313-8322Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) is available with a peptide corresponding to residues 33–80 of cTnI. Superposition of this structure with the C-terminal domain of cTnC in the intact cTnC·cTnI complex yielded a backbone root mean square deviation of only 2.2 Å. Comparison of the structure of cTnC-(1–89) bound to cTnI-(147–163) (Protein Data Bank code 1MXL) (4Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) with the N-terminal domain in cTnC·cTnI yielded a backbone root mean square deviation of only 2.1 Å. The similarity of the cTnC-C and cTnC-N structures to their corresponding domains in the intact complex establishes the utility of using isolated domain structures as models for understanding the atomic details of divalent cation and TnI peptide interactions. Unfortunately, isolated domain studies cannot provide information on domain orientation, long-range protein-protein interactions, or the interdomain linker. We also compared amide 1H and 15N chemical shifts for cTnC in the intact cTnC·cTnI complex with those for cTnC-C (12Gasmi-Seabrook G.M. Howarth J.W. Finley N. Abusamhadneh E. Gaponenko V. Brito R.M. Solaro R.J. Rosevear P.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8313-8322Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and cTnC-N (26Paakkonen K. Sorsa T. Drakenberg T. Pollesello P. Tilgmann C. Permi P. Heikkinen S. Kilpelainen I. Annila A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6665-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Differences in amide 1H chemical shifts are a sensitive probe of backbone conformational changes. The average chemical shift difference between cTnC-C and the C-terminal domain of cTnC in the intact cTnC·cTnI complex was 0.02 ± 0.01 ppm. The chemical shift variation between cTnC-N and the N-terminal domain of cTnC in the cTnC·cTnI complex was 0.12 ± 0.01 ppm. Although larger chemical shift differences were observed between N-terminal domain structures, these were modest and generally smaller than the chemical shift changes that occur upon binding cTnI-(148–163) and Ca2+ to cTnC (26Paakkonen K. Sorsa T. Drakenberg T. Pollesello P. Tilgmann C. Permi P. Heikkinen S. Kilpelainen I. Annila A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6665-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the magnitude and direction of N-terminal domain chemical shift differences are consistent with minor perturbations of the closed-to-open regulatory domain equilibria. Because most cTnC N- and C-terminal domain amides showed the same resonances in the intact cTnC·cTnI complex as observed in the individual isolated domains, the contact area between cTnC and cTnI must not be much larger than those observed in the cTnC(1–89)·cTnI(147–163) peptide (Protein Data Bank code 1FI5) (12Gasmi-Seabrook G.M. Howarth J.W. Finley N. Abusamhadneh E. Gaponenko V. Brito R.M. Solaro R.J. Rosevear P.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8313-8322Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and the cTnC-N·cTnI peptide (Protein Data Bank code 1MXL) (4Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) structures. In addition, significant interdomain interactions within the complex are not expected. For each domain, solvent-exposed hydrophobic surface area was calculated and compared with that observed in the individual domain structures. The surface-accessible nonpolar area was determined utilizing the NMR-Refine module of Insight II (MSI). The calculated accessible nonpolar area for the N-terminal domain (residues 4–83) is 2614 Å2 for intact cTnC·cTnI and 2631 Å2for cTnC-N (Protein Data Bank code 1MXL). For the C-terminal domain (residues 93–159), the calculated accessible nonpolar area is 2280 Å2 for intact cTnC·cTnI and 2320 Å2 for cTnC-C (Protein Data Bank code 1FI5). Similarity in accessible nonpolar surface area further shows that individual cTnC domain conformations in cTnC·cTnI are similar to the aforementioned structures of the isolated N- and C-terminal domains bound to their respective cTnI binding peptides. Uncertainty in domain orientation is a persistent problem in structure determination of multidomain proteins. This is especially true in the multidomain EF-hand protein family, exemplified by TnC and calmodulin (CaM), due to the presence of a long flexible linker connecting individual domains. Analysis of heteronuclear relaxation data established that binding of cTnI decreases conformational fluctuations within the cTnC interdomain linker (27Abbott M.B. Gaponenko V. Abusamhadneh E. Finley N., Li, G. Dvoretsky A. Rance M. Solaro R.J. Rosevear P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20610-20617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The observed decrease in linker flexibility indicates that, in the presence of cTnI, cTnC interdomain motion is restricted. In addition, paramagnetic effects on [methyl-13C]Met residues in cTnC from a nitroxide spin label attached at Cys84 suggested that binding of cTnI decreases interdomain motion, resulting in a more extended cTnC structure (28Kleerekoper Q. Howarth J.W. Guo X. Solaro R.J. Rosevear P.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13343-13352Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the absence of TnI, the interdomain linker is considerably more flexible, resulting in an ill defined orientation between the two domains, with both domains aligning in the magnetic field to differing degrees. Restriction of interdomain motion in the presence of bound cTnI suggested that RDCs measured in liquid-crystalline media could be used to determine the average domain orientation of Ca2+-saturated cTnC bound to cTnI. With experimentally measured RDCs in two different alignment media and previously published long-range distance restraints, we determined the relative domain orientation of Ca2+-saturated cTnC bound to cTnI. The RDC-determined solution structure for cTnC, having both hydrophobic pockets highlighted, with cTnI residues 33–80 interacting with the C-terminal domain hydrophobic pocket and cTnI residues 147–163 interacting with the N-terminal domain hydrophobic pocket is shown in Fig. 2. This structure represents the first full-length TnC solution structure defining the relationship between globular domains in the presence of full-length cTnI. The relative domain orientation is such that hydrophobic pockets within each domain are positioned to “latch on” to different helical segments of cTnI. The relatively good fit of RDCs measured in Ca2+-saturated cTnC bound to cTnI with available domain structures (4Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 12Gasmi-Seabrook G.M. Howarth J.W. Finley N. Abusamhadneh E. Gaponenko V. Brito R.M. Solaro R.J. Rosevear P.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8313-8322Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) together with the modest differences in chemical shifts between the intact complex and isolated domains support the assumption that high resolution TnC domain structures provide biologically relevant models for understanding atomic details of domain-cation and domain-target interactions. Validation of domain structures permitted the use of long-range distance and orientation constraints to investigate how individual domains are functionally assembled to control muscle contraction. In addition, these studies suggest that cTnC may interact with relatively small regions of cTnI, being structurally unaffected by the remaining portions of the protein. A similar finding for CaM binding to CaM kinase I and peptide complexes has recently been reported (29Kranz J.K. Lee E.K. Nairn A.C. Wand A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16351-16354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In that study, chemical shift comparisons were used to show that the CaM·CaM kinase I peptide complex is a nearly perfect mimic for the interaction of CaM with the intact enzyme. Taken together, these studies suggest that both CaM and TnC interact with target proteins by recognizing and binding short EF-hand recognition motifs. Regions of cTnI outside the known peptide binding sequences have little effect on cTnC, consistent with disordered or flexible regions of polypeptide separating functional cTnI domains. Model peptide studies utilizing cTnI residues 129–149, containing the inhibitory region, suggest that the inhibitory region may not interact directly with cTnC (30Abbott M.B. Dvoretsky A. Gaponenko V. Rosevear P.R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This finding is consistent with flexible linkers allowing TnI domains to move relative to one another. To allow quantitative comparison of domain orientations between intact cTnC bound to cTnI with other Ca2+-binding protein·target complexes, the relative domain orientations are described by three parameters: bend, azimuth, and twist. When classified by the bend between the D- and E-helices, available TnC and CaM structures fall into two general families. The first family, as typified by the two Ca2+-loaded x-ray structure of TnC (Protein Data Bank code1TOP), exhibits a slight bend along a particular azimuth with little or no twist. This structure has a helical linker and adopts an extended conformation with the hydrophobic pockets facing in opposition. The second family shows a larger bend with a portion of the D/E-helical linker unwound (Fig. 3). The cTnI-bound cTnC structure falls into this second family, having a 70° bend in the linker region. Similarly, the crystal structure of sTnC bound to sTnI-(1–47) has a 93° bend in the linker region (11Vassylyev D.G. Takeda S. Wakatsuki S. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4847-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The azimuths for TnC bound to full-length TnI and TnI-(1–47) are 30° and −162°, respectively, producing different relative orientations of the hydrophobic binding pockets (Fig. 3). Differences in the disposition of the hydrophobic pockets between the solution structure of cTnC bound to cTnI and the crystal structure of sTnC bound to cTnI-(1–47) (11Vassylyev D.G. Takeda S. Wakatsuki S. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4847-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) may result from the influence of full-length cTnI or as a consequence of crystal-packing forces. In the solution structure of cTnC, each Ca2+-saturated TnC domain is positioned to act as a latch constraining the separate helical regions of cTnI. The binding of Ca2+ and the regulatory region of cTnI to the N-terminal domain of cTnC is generally believed to be the key interaction in a series of conformational rearrangements necessary for relieving inhibition of the actomyosin ATPase and initiation of muscle contraction. Assuming a largely structural role for the cTnC C-terminal domain-cTnI N-terminal domain interaction, the role of the linker region may be to optimally position the N-terminal domain for interaction with the regulatory region of cTnI. The removal of Ca2+ from the regulatory domain would result in the unlatching of the cTnI regulatory region. Such a model suggests an essential role for linker plasticity in the ability of TnC to regulate muscle contraction in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Comparison of domain orientation in the absence of Ca2+ is not possible because cTnC would only be anchored to the N-terminal domain of cTnI via C-terminal domain interactions. The functional and structural significance of the interdomain linker in TnC is poorly understood. Deletion of 7 residues was found not to impact regulatory function (31Babu A. Rao V.G., Su, H. Gulati J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19232-19238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a similar study, systematic deletion of 3–12 linker residues showed that up to 7 residues could be deleted with little change in maximal force development (31Babu A. Rao V.G., Su, H. Gulati J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19232-19238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Sheng Z.L. Francois J.M. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5711-5715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, with further deletions, inhibition increased until at 12 deletions the inhibition was complete (31Babu A. Rao V.G., Su, H. Gulati J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19232-19238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Sheng Z.L. Francois J.M. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5711-5715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In an attempt to provide a structural context to the observed functional consequences of linker region deletions, we have examined the influence of deleting 7, 9, and 12 residues from the linker region on cTnC length and domain orientation. Two different 7-amino acid deletions in the linker region have been reported (31Babu A. Rao V.G., Su, H. Gulati J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19232-19238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Sheng Z.L. Francois J.M. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5711-5715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Seven-residue deletions in the sTnC linker domain, corresponding to residues 90–96 and 86–92 in recombinant cTnC, were found to have little effect on maximal force development or the ability of sTnC to activate actomyosin ATPase (31Babu A. Rao V.G., Su, H. Gulati J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19232-19238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Sheng Z.L. Francois J.M. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Potter J.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 5703-5710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Computationally generated mutants, created by deletion of appropriate linker residues, were used as input structures in rigid body minimization and constrained/restrained simulated annealing protocols. Computationally generated deletion mutants were evaluated for their ability to simultaneously satisfy both experimentally measured RDCs and long-range distance restraints. Acceptable low energy structures, satisfying all experimental constraints, were obtained for both computationally generated mutant cTnC proteins with 7-residue linker deletions. No significant differences in domain orientations were found between the 7-residue linker domain deletion mutants and wild-type cTnC. Next, a computationally generated cTnC mutant with a 9-residue linker deletion, corresponding to residues 88–96, was subjected to rigid body minimization and constrained/restrained simulated annealing. Although structures satisfying the experimental constraints were obtained, significant strain within the linker domain was introduced. The strain was evidenced by the appearance of distorted covalent geometry in the linker region, including elongated covalent bonds and bond angles that deviate significantly from the ideal values. The PROCHECKG-factor (25Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4282) Google Scholar), a composite measure of covalent geometry, was used to evaluate the consequences of each deletion. TheG-factor for the solution structure of cTnC bound to cTnI is −0.21. For both 7-residue deletions, the G-factor remained essentially unchanged at −0.22. However, for the 9-residue deletion, the G-factor decreased to −0.63. This value is below the −0.5 threshold, indicating the development of significant deviations from ideal covalent geometry. Although TnC can accommodate a 9-residue linker deletion and not violate experimental constraints, the increase in intermolecular strain required to adapt a wild-type conformation is likely responsible for the significant decrease in maximal force generated (31Babu A. Rao V.G., Su, H. Gulati J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19232-19238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, orientation and distance restraints were inconsistent with computationally generated TnC structures having 12 linker residues deleted. Contraction was completely inhibited by TnC containing a 12-residue linker deletion (31Babu A. Rao V.G., Su, H. Gulati J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19232-19238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in agreement with our modeling studies. Thus, the solution structure for cTnC bound to cTnI can successfully explain the observed functional consequences of linker region deletions. Although plasticity within the linker region may play an important role, the ability of TnC to function in muscle regulation can be correlated with a preferred domain orientation and interdomain distance. Thus, the linker region also functions as a spacer to maintain the N- and C-terminal domains at an appropriate distance that likely correlates with the separation of TnI target peptides 33–80 and 147–163 in cTnI. Recent efforts to model the disposition of TnI relative to TnC have been hindered by the absence of structural information on TnI and long-range distance restraints (34Luo Y., Wu, J., Li, B. Langsetmo K. Gergely J. Tao T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 899-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 35Tung C.S. Wall M.E. Gallagher S.C. Trewhella J. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1312-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, the crystal structure of free TnC (10Herzberg O. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 761-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 36Houdusse A. Love M.L. Dominguez R. Grabarek Z. Cohen C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1695-1711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) was assumed to provide an accurate model for the solution structure of TnC in the complex and was used to define the overall length and domain orientation. The experimentally determined solution structure for cTnC bound to TnI demonstrates that the domain orientation differs from that of the free protein in the crystal (Fig. 3). Although initial events in muscle contraction are well characterized at the domain level, propagation of the signal remains poorly understood largely due to the uncertainty of interdomain position. Our structure provides a scaffold for further studies aimed at mapping interactions within the troponin complex responsible for the initiation of muscle contraction.

Genetic studies have shown that retrovirus integration requires two viral components, integrase and DNA sequences at the ends of the viral long terminal repeats (LTRs) (1Brown P.O. Coffin J. Hughes S. Varmus H. Integration in Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 161-203Google Scholar). In the cytoplasm, integrase forms a complex with the viral DNA. This is followed by two enzymatic reactions. In the 3′-processing reaction, integrase removes a dinucleotide from each 3′-end of the viral DNA, resulting in a terminating CA sequence. The processed DNA is transported into the nucleus and inserted in the host chromosome, producing a gapped intermediate. Gap repair is probably carried out by cellular DNA repair enzymes (2Yoder K.E. Bushman F.D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11191-11200Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar).Integrase is a 32-kDa protein that is composed of three distinct domains. The N terminus contains the “HHCC” zinc finger-like motif. Evidence suggests that the binding of zinc has a prominent role in the self-assembly of IN into an active multimeric complex (3Lee S.P. Xiao J.M. Knutson J.R. Lewis M.S. Han M.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 4Zheng R. Jenkins T.M. Craigie R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Caffrey M. Craigie R. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 839-840Crossref Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The central core and the C-terminal domain are DNA binding domains. The central core contains the catalytic triad, the D,D(35)E motif, which is responsible for the specific binding of the substrate and the enzymatic activity of integrase. The C-terminal domain has a nonspecific DNA binding activity. In solution, integrase has been shown to form monomers, dimers, and tetramers (6Sherman P.A. Fyfe J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

With a confocal microscope and a laser source, the observed volume is reduced to only 1 fl. In FCS, the temporal behavior of fluorescence fluctuations is analyzed by means of an autocorrelation function to study the dynamic processes underlying the fluctuations (11Elson E.L. Madge D. Biopolymers. 1974; 17: 1-27Crossref Scopus (1305) Google Scholar, 12Madge D. Elson E.L. Webb W.W. Biopolymers. 1974; 13: 29-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar, 13Magde D. Mol. Biol.

With fluorescently labeled molecules it is possible to detect alterations of their diffusion time because of their interactions with other molecules. In some cases, when high molecular mass association products are formed, high intensity fluorescent spikes are produced. These spikes confound normal autocorrelation analysis. In this case intensity distributions were studied, and we have developed in our laboratory a statistical method for automatically discriminating between the fluorescence of the spikes and the fluorescence of free molecules (14Van Craenenbroeck E.

To investigate the binding characteristics of HIV-1 integrase, we have developed an FCS-based method to determine its binding constants. The advantage of this method is the possibility of performing measurements on a tiny volume without UV cross-linking (16Pemberton I.K. Buckle M. Buc H. J. Biol.

Methods. 1997; 12: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Our results clearly demonstrate that the binding of HIV-1 integrase to DNA induces oligomerization under the conditions commonly used. Integration of the viral DNA of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)1 into the genome of a human cell is an essential step in the retroviral replication cycle. Genetic studies have shown that retrovirus integration requires two viral components, integrase and DNA sequences at the ends of the viral long terminal repeats (LTRs) (1Brown P.O. Coffin J. Hughes S. Varmus H. Integration in Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 161-203Google Scholar). In the cytoplasm, integrase forms a complex with the viral DNA. This is followed by two enzymatic reactions. In the 3′-processing reaction, integrase removes a dinucleotide from each 3′-end of the viral DNA, resulting in a terminating CA sequence. The processed DNA is transported into the nucleus and inserted in the host chromosome, producing a gapped intermediate. Gap repair is probably carried out by cellular DNA repair enzymes (2Yoder K.E. Bushman F.D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11191-11200Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Integrase is a 32-kDa protein that is composed of three distinct domains. The N terminus contains the “HHCC” zinc finger-like motif. Evidence suggests that the binding of zinc has a prominent role in the self-assembly of IN into an active multimeric complex (3Lee S.P. Xiao J.M. Knutson J.R. Lewis M.S. Han M.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 4Zheng R. Jenkins T.M. Craigie R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13659-13664Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The N terminus has been suggested to be involved in protein-protein interactions and substrate specificity (5Cai M.L. Zheng R.L. Caffrey M. Craigie R. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 839-840Crossref Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The central core and the C-terminal domain are DNA binding domains. The central core contains the catalytic triad, the D,D(35)E motif, which is responsible for the specific binding of the substrate and the enzymatic activity of integrase. The C-terminal domain has a nonspecific DNA binding activity. In solution, integrase has been shown to form monomers, dimers, and tetramers (6Sherman P.A. Fyfe J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Our aim was thus to obtain more insights into the actions of these peptides on adipocytes, an approach initially undertaken with a functional genomic assay. First we showed that 3T3-L1 adipocytes express both NPFF-R1 andNPFF-R2 transcripts, and that NPAF binds adipocyte membranes with a nanomolar affinity as assessed by surface plasmon resonance technology. Then, and following a 24-h treatment with NPFF or NPAF (1 μm), we have measured using real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR the mRNA steady state levels of already well characterized genes involved in key pathways of adipose metabolism. Among the 45 genes tested, few were modulated by NPFF (∼10%) and a larger number by NPAF (∼27%). Interestingly, NPAF increased the mRNA levels of β2- and β3-adrenergic receptors (AR), and to a lesser extent those of β1-ARs. These variations in catecholamine receptor mRNAs correlated with a clear induction in the density of β2- and β3-AR proteins, and in the potency of β-AR subtype-selective agonists to stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity. Altogether, these data show that NPFF-R1 and NPFF-R2 are functionally present in adipocytes and suggest that besides their well described pain modulation effects, NPAF and to a lesser extent NPFF, may have a global impact on body energy storage and utilization.

Although the restricted and limited expression in peripheral organs do not reconciliate multiple reported peripheral effects of NPAF or NPFF and may suggest the existence of an additional receptor subtype(s) (1Panula P. Aarnisalo A.A. Wasowicz K. Prog. Neurobiol. 1996; 48: 461-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), it highlights possible modulatory metabolic effects of these neuropeptides on adipose tissue, an aspect that has never been reported or explored. For such a purpose we have designed an assay aimed at providing insights into the biological effects of NPAF or NPFF on adipocytes. We used as a model the mouse 3T3-L1 preadipose cell line that mimics the morphological, metabolic, and hormonal features of adipose tissue development (18Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1975; 5: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). After having verified that 3T3-L1-differentiated fat cells express NPFF-R1 and NPFF-R2, mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes were exposed to NPAF or NPFF stimulation and mRNA steady state levels of about 50 genes, which products are involved in key pathways of adipose metabolism, were measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The well characterized tested genes are implicated in the six following pathways: insulin signaling and glucose metabolism, lipoprotein and cholesterol metabolism, energy storage, energy degradation, gene transcription regulation, and secretion of factors. With such an approach, one could evidence that NPAF, and to a lesser extent NPFF, modulate in adipocytes a finite number of genes among those tested. The products of these target genes are involved in several facets of adipocyte biology. Interestingly, we observed that NPAF induces the mRNA levels of the three β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) subtypes. To evaluate the consequences of modulation of β-AR transcripts, we focused the last part of our work on the characterization of NPAF effects on β-AR protein expression and functional responsiveness. In agreement with variations in mRNA levels, the neuropeptide increases β2- and β3-AR populations. This was paralleled by a higher potency of β2- or β3-AR-selective agonists and of (−)-epinephrine to stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity. This fine regulation may represent a physiological mechanism by which in fat cells, the neuropeptide could promote the vascular over the neuronal adrenergic control of cAMP-dependent biological events. 3T3-L1 cells (ATCC number CL-173) were grown and differentiated at 37 °C in an atmosphere of air/CO2(90:10, v/v) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 4.5 g/liter of d-glucose, 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin (50 units of penicillin/50 μg of streptomycin/ml of medium). Two days after reaching confluence, cells were induced into differentiation with a 2-day incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum containing insulin (1 μg/ml), dexamethasone (0.25 μm), and isobutylmethylxanthine (0.1 mm) (all from Sigma). Then preadipocytes were shifted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with insulin (1 μg/ml). After 10 days, when adipocytes have accumulated numerous lipid droplets as judged by Oil Red O staining (19Orlicky D.J. Lieber J.G. Morin C.L. Evans R.M. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1152-1161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cells were placed for 16–18 h in a defined medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (1:1, v/v), 4.5 g/liter ofd-glucose, l-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, 5% bovine serum albumin, then treated for 24 or 48 h with the indicated concentrations of human NPAF (AGEGLNSQFWSLAAPQRFa) or human NPFF (SQAFLFQPQRFa) (Bachem). Each experiment was performed three to five times. Membranes from mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes were prepared by hypotonic lysis in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, in the presence of protease inhibitors, followed by a 500-g supernatant centrifugation at 48,000 × g. Proteins were measured using the Bradford Coomassie dye method using bovine serum albumin as standard (Pierce). Adipocyte membranes were immobilized on hydrophobic surfaces to allow subsequent measurement by surface plasmon resonance (Biacore) of NPAF binding. For such a purpose, the HPA (hydrophobic association) sensor chip surface was cleaned with 50 μl of 40 mm N-octylglucoside in water at a flow rate of 10 μl/mn. After 10–30 s, 10 μl of adipocyte membranes (100 μg of protein/ml) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline were injected onto the surface in the sample flow cell at a flow rate of 3 μl/mn. Another flow cell also activated with N-octylglucoside but without membrane served as control. The process of spontaneous fusion of adipocyte membranes to the HPA surface was monitored as the sensorgram reading begins to level out after reaching a plateau. To allow formation of an homogenous surface, i.e. lipid monolayer, 10 μl of 10 mmNaOH was injected at a flow rate of 10 μl/min according to the manufacturers recommendation (Biacore). Then bovine serum albumin (10 μl at 0.1 mg/ml) was injected at a flow rate of 10 μl/min to fill out putative gaps that could have remained on the surface. All experiments were done at 25 °C in a continuous flow of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. HPA surface regeneration was achieved with repeated washes with 10 mm glycine at pH 2.0. NPAF was used at the indicated concentrations to monitor interaction with adipocyte membranes. Binding curves obtained using two concentrations of NPAF (10 and 1000 nm) were analyzed (BiaEvaluation software), and the data sets were best fitted with a 1:1 Langmuir binding interaction. Nonspecific binding to membranes was determined using an irrelevant peptide of the same size as NPAF: COOH-GSKGSKGSKGSKGSKGSK-NH2. Experiments were reproduced at least 3 times. Total RNA was prepared as described (20Krief S. Fève B. Baude B. Zilberfarb V. Strosberg A.D. Pairault J. Emorine L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6664-6670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA in 20 μl using random hexamers and murine Moloney leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Design of primers was done using either the Primer Express (Applied Biosystems) or Oligo (MedProbe, Norway) software. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analyses for the genes described in Table I were performed starting with 50 ng of reverse transcribed total RNA (diluted in 5 μl of 1× Sybr Green buffer), with 200 nm of both sense and antisense primers (Genset) in a final volume of 25 μl using the Sybr Green PCR core reagents in a ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System instrument (Applied Biosystems). Fluorescence was generated after laser excitation by bound Sybr Green to double strand DNA. Because we used Sybr Green in measurements of amplification-associated fluorescence for real-time quantitative RT-PCR, it was important to verify that generated fluorescence was not overestimated by contaminations resulting from residual genomic DNA amplification (using controls without reverse transcriptase) and/or from primer dimers formation (controls with no DNA template nor reverse transcriptase). RT-PCR products were also analyzed on ethidium bromide-stained agarose to ensure that a single amplicon of the expected size was indeed obtained. To measure PCR efficiency, serial dilutions of reverse transcribed RNA (0.1 pg to 200 ng) were amplified, and a line was obtained by plotting cycle threshold (CT) values as a function of starting reverse transcribed RNA, the slope of which was used for efficiency calculation using the formula E = 10‖(1/slope)‖ − 1 (21PE Applied Biosystems (Nov. 12, 1997) User Bulletin 2. Relative Quantitation of Gene Expression, 1–36.Google Scholar). Ribosomal 18 S RNA and GAPDH (which are not modified by treatment with the neuropeptides) amplifications were used to account for variability in the initial quantities of cDNA. Relative quantitation for any given gene, expressed as -fold variation over control (untreated cells), was calculated after determination of the difference between CT of the given gene A and that of the calibrator gene B (GAPDH) in treated cells (ΔCT1 = CT1A-CTB) and untreated cells (ΔCT0 = CT0A − CTB) using the 2−ΔΔCT(1−0) formula (21PE Applied Biosystems (Nov. 12, 1997) User Bulletin 2. Relative Quantitation of Gene Expression, 1–36.Google Scholar). GAPDHexpression of a control RNA was used as interplate calibrator. CT values are means of triplicate measurements. Experiments were repeated 3 to 5 times. For quantitation of murineNPFF-Rs, standard curves were determined after amplification of 5 × 102 to 5 × 106 copies of purified amplicons generated from 3T3-L1 cDNA using the sense and antisense primers.

Homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and membrane pellets were resuspended in the homogenization buffer and stored at −80 °C until use in adenylyl cyclase or binding assays. Protein was assayed (22Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Cell triglyceride content was determined with the InfinityTM triglyceride kit (Sigma). Adenylyl cyclase (EC 4.6.1.1) activity was measured for 10 min at 35 °C in a 50-μl standard assay consisting of 0.1 mm[α-32P]ATP (ICN Pharmaceuticals), 1 mmcAMP, 10 mm phosphocreatine, 0.5 unit of creatine phosphokinase, 100 μm GTP (except when GTPγS, NaF, or forskolin were used), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with or without a β-adrenergic effector. The reaction was initiated by the addition of crude membranes (20 μg of protein) and terminated as described (23Pairault J. Lasnier F. Laudat M.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 127: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) activity was measured in the cytosolic fraction by recording the initial rate of oxidation of NADH at 340 nm at 25 °C (24Kozak L.P. Jensen J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7775-7781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The standard mixture contained 50 mm triethanolamine, 25 mm HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.13 mm β-NADH, 1 mm dihydroxyacetone phosphate, 1 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and variable amounts of 100,000 × gsupernatants. For [125I]CYP binding experiments, membrane aliquots (40–60 μg of protein) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with [125I]CYP (Amersham Biosciences) with or without competing ligand in a final volume of 100 μl consisting of 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm GTP, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. After dilution in 2 ml of ice-cold 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, separation of bound from free radioligand was achieved by vacuum filtration over Whatman GF/C glass fiber disks presoaked in 0.3% polyethyleneimine, followed by three washes with the same buffer. Saturation experiments were performed with [125I]CYP concentrations ranging from 5 to 4000 pm. Competition experiments were carried out at 30 pm[125I]CYP. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 100 μm (±)-propranolol and represented 9.4 ± 0.5% of total binding at 30 pm[125I]CYP.

https://openalex.org/W2035597380,"Asparaginyl-tRNA (Asn-tRNA) is generated in nature via two alternate routes, either direct acylation of tRNA with asparagine by asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase (AsnRS) or in a two-step pathway that requires misacylated Asp-tRNAAsn as an intermediate. This misacylated aminoacyl-tRNA is formed by a nondiscriminating aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (AspRS), an enzyme that in addition to forming Asp-tRNAAsp also misacylates tRNAAsn. In contrast, a discriminating AspRS cannot acylate tRNAAsn. It has been suggested that the archaeal AspRS enzymes are nondiscriminating, whereas the bacterial ones discriminate. The archaeal and bacterial AspRS proteins are indeed distinct in sequence and structure. However, we show that both discriminating and nondiscriminating forms of AspRS exist among the archaea. Using unfractionated methanobacterial and pyrococcal tRNA, theMethanothermobacter thermautotrophicus AspRS acylated approximately twice as much tRNA as did AspRS from Pyrococcus kodakaraensis or Ferroplasma acidarmanus. Proof that Asp-tRNAAsn was generated by the methanogen synthetase was the conversion of Asp-tRNA formed by M. thermautotrophicusAspRS to Asn-tRNA by M. thermautotrophicusAsp-tRNAAsn amidotransferase. In contrast, Asp-tRNA formed by the Pyrococcus or Ferroplasma enzymes was not a substrate for the amidotransferase. Also, although all three AspRS enzymes charged tRNAAsp transcripts, only M. thermautotrophicus AspRS aspartylated the tRNAAsntranscript. Genomic analysis provides a rationale for the nature of these enzymes. The mischarging AspRS correlates with the absence in the genome of AsnRS and the presence of Asp-tRNAAsnamidotransferase, employed by the transamidation pathway. In contrast, the discriminating AspRS correlates with the absence of the amidotransferase and the presence of AsnRS, forming Asn-tRNA by direct aminoacylation. The high sequence identity, up to 60% between discriminating and nondiscriminating archaeal AspRSs, suggests that few mutational steps may be necessary to convert the tRNA-discriminating ability of a tRNA synthetase.

Söll D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 617-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). The remarkable ability of these enzymes to discriminate between numerous tRNA molecules has long been the focus of studies in protein-nucleic acid recognition (reviewed in Refs. 2Giegé R. Sissler M. Florentz C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5017-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar and 3Saks M.E. Sampson J.R. Abelson J.N. Science. 1994; 263: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Despite the need for precision, at least two misacylating tRNA synthetases happily exist in nature. Both aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (AspRS)1 and glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (GluRS) occur in mischarging forms, often in organisms that lack asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase (AsnRS) or glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (GlnRS) (reviewed in Ref. 4Ibba M. Becker H.D. Stathopoulos C. Tumbula D.L. Söll D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 311-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These organisms generate Asn-tRNA or Gln-tRNA by pre-translational amino acid modification. For instance, in place of direct Asn-tRNA formation by AsnRS (Fig. 1 A), a nondiscriminating AspRS misacylates tRNAAsn with aspartate (Fig. 1 B). A second enzyme, the tRNA amidotransferase GatCAB, converts Asp-tRNAAsn by amidation to the correct translational substrate, Asn-tRNAAsn (Fig.1 B). The heterotrimeric bacterial GatCAB enzyme can also form Gln-tRNA from Glu-tRNAGln (4Ibba M. Becker H.D. Stathopoulos C. Tumbula D.L. Söll D. Trends Biochem.

Sequence analyses indicate that the AspRSs form two distinct phylogenetic branches (5Wolf Y.I. Aravind L. Grishin N.V. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 689-710PubMed Google Scholar, 6Woese C.R.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5045-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), essentially a bacterial and an archaeal/eukaryotic branch. An AsnRS branch also separates both AspRS groups in some phylogenetic analyses (6Woese C.R. Olsen G.J. Ibba M. Söll D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

The phylogenetic segregation of the AspRSs into two groups is also supported by comparisons of AspRS structures from the three domains (8Ruff M. Cavarelli J. Mikol V. Lorber B. Mitschler A. Giegé R.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6532-6541Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Several residues critical for binding of the Asp-AMP adenylate are unique to the eukaryote- and archaea-type AspRSs and are distinct from those used in the bacteria-type enzyme (10Schmitt E. Moulinier L. Fujiwara S. Imanaka T. Thierry J.-C. Moras D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5227-5237Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Comparison of AspRS amino acid sequences reveals a relatively long (∼570 residue) enzyme common in the bacteria, compared with a shorter (∼430 residue) enzyme in the archaea. The size difference is mainly due to an insertion domain in the bacteria-type AspRS that is absent in the archaea-type enzyme (6Woese C.R. Olsen G.J. Ibba M. Söll D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 202-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar,12Imanaka T. Lee S. Takagi M. Fujiwara S. Gene. 1995; 164: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 13Becker H.D. Roy H.

Biochemical analyses led to the proposal that the bacterial AspRS was a strictly discriminating enzyme, whereas the archaeal AspRS could aspartylate tRNAAsp and tRNAAsn (10Schmitt E. Moulinier L.

However, a recent study indicated that the 583-residue, bacteria-type AspRS found in Chlamydia trachomatis could mischarge the chlamydial tRNAAsn when it was expressed along with Escherichia coli tRNA (17Raczniak G. Becker H.D. Min B. Söll D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45862-45867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This result suggests that the evolution and discriminating functions of the AspRSs may be more complex than originally envisioned. Here we show that the archaea-type AspRSs are also divided into discriminating and nondiscriminating types based on activity and function. The nature of tRNA discrimination by the archaeal AspRS enzymes appears to be correlated with the genomic presence ofasnS (18Tumbula D.L. Becker H.D. Chang W.-Z. Söll D. Nature. 2000; 407: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were synthesized and DNAs were sequenced by the Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University. Uniformly labeled [14C]Asp (50 μCi/ml, 213 mCi/mmol) and [3H]Asp (1 mCi/ml, 26 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham Biosciences, and [14C]Asn (50 μCi/ml, 228.4 mCi/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Values for cpm/pmol were determined by spotting dilutions in triplicate onto 3MM filter disks (Whatman), drying the filters, and scintillation counting. For [14C]Asp, [3H]Asp, and [14C]Asn, the values were 396, 8520, and 491 cpm/pmol, respectively. The value for [3H]Asp includes a conversion factor of 1.85, reflecting the different counting efficiencies of [3H]Asp and [3H]Asp-tRNA. This value was determined by charging to plateau an equal amount of transcript using [14C]Asp or [3H]Asp. Methanothermobacter marburgensis cells were obtained from R. Hedderich and R. Thauer (Max-Planck-Institut für terrestrische Mikrobiologie, Marburg, Germany). Pyrococcus furiosus cells were provided by R. Hader and K. O. Stetter (University of Regensburg, Germany).Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus ΔH genomic DNA was from J. Reeve (Ohio State University, Columbus, OH), Pyrococcus kodakaraensis genomic DNA was from Drs. H. Atomi and T. Imanaka (Kyoto University, Japan), and Ferroplasma acidarmanus (19Edwards K.J. Bond P.L. Gihring T.M. Banfield J.F. Science. 2000; 287: 1796-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) genomic DNA was from Paul Predki (Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute, Walnut Creek, CA). The genes encoding theF. acidarmanus tRNAAsn and tRNAAspwere contained in contig 145 (tRNA 2) and contig 144 (tRNA 1), respectively, of the organism's sequence data (genome.ornl.gov/microbial/faci/12oct00/trna_summary.html). For the F. acidarmanus tRNAAsn, position 68 in the tRNA was changed from A to G to yield a C-G base pair in the acceptor stem. The M. thermautotrophicus tRNAAsn is from MTH1276 (20Smith D.R.

The tRNA genes were synthesized from two overlapping oligonucleotides that included a T7 promoter and a BstNI site as described previously (16Min B. Pelaschier J.T. Graham D.E. Tumbula-Hansen D. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2678-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Following the in vitrotranscription reaction (18Tumbula D.L. Becker H.D. Chang W.-Z. Söll D. Nature. 2000; 407: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), the transcripts were extracted with phenol and chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and purified on a Q-Sepharose column (20 cm × 0.2 cm2) in Buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 7m urea). Nucleotides were removed with 3 column volumes of Buffer A plus 0.4 m NaCl, and transcripts were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.4–2 m NaCl in Buffer A. Fractions containing the transcripts as judged by a denaturing polyacrylamide gel were pooled, extracted with phenol and chloroform, and precipitated with ethanol. Excess urea was removed by a Nap-10 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences). Transcripts were resuspended in water and stored at −80 °C. Unfractionated tRNA was purified from 5 g of M. marburgensis and P. furiosus cells as described (15Curnow A.W. Tumbula D.L. Pelaschier J.T. Min B. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12838-12843Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) using extractions by phenol and chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1), precipitation in ethanol, and purification on DEAE-cellulose (DE52, Whatman). Phenol extractions were continued until the aqueous phase was clear. For purification fromP. furiosus cells, 0.1 m NaCl was included in the cell resuspension. The yields based on A 260measurements were 0.38 mg of tRNA/g of M. marburgensis cells and 0.61 mg of tRNA/g of P. furiosus cells. The genes encoding the AspRSs were from M. thermautotrophicus (MTH226; Ref. 20Smith D.R. Doucette-Stamm L.A. Deloughery C. Lee H. Dubois J. Aldredge T. Bashirzadeh R. Blakely D. Cook R. Gilbert K.

Gene. 1995; 164: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), andF. acidarmanus (Contig 143, gene 58, www.jgi.doe.gov/JGI_microbial/html/ferroplasma/ferro_mainpage.html). The genes were obtained by PCR from the genomic DNA using the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or thePfu Turbo enzyme (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Oligonucleotide primers introduced an NdeI site at the 5′-end of each gene and a BamHI site at the 3′-end of the M. thermautotrophicus and P. kodakaraensis genes, or anXhoI site at the 3′ end of the F. acidarmanusgene. After cloning into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and sequence confirmation, the genes were cloned into pET20b or pET28a (Novagen, Madison, WI). The NdeI-BamHI fragment containing the M. thermautotrophicus AspRS gene and the NdeI-XhoI fragment containing theF. acidarmanus AspRS gene were cloned into pET28a to yield N-terminally His6-tagged proteins. TheNdeI-BamHI fragment containing the P. kodakaraensis gene was cloned into the pET20b vector to yield native enzyme. The operon encoding the M. thermautotrophicusAsp-tRNAAsn amidotransferase (18Tumbula D.L. Becker H.D. Chang W.-Z. Söll D. Nature. 2000; 407: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) was also cloned into theNdeI-SacI sites of pET20b without the stop codon of the gatB gene. All proteins were expressed from theE. coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL strain (Stratagene), which expresses the E. coli minor tRNA genes argU,ileY, and leuW from a chloramphenicol-resistant vector. The cells were grown at 37 °C in LB (5 g of yeast extract, 10 g of tryptone, 10 g of NaCl, pH 7.0, per liter) with 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. For pET28a clones, 25 μg/ml kanamycin was included, the cells were induced with 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at anA 600 of 0.5, and growth was continued at 15 °C for 16 h before harvesting. For pET20b clones, 100 μg/ml ampicillin was included, the cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at an A 600 of 1.3, and growth was continued at 37 °C for 4 h before harvesting. All steps were performed at 4 °C except where noted. All enzymes were >95% pure as judged by Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (not shown). The His6-tagged AspRSs were purified from 5 g of cells on Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The cells were resuspended in Buffer B (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 20 mmimidazole, 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm benzamidine-HCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME)) plus 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme and 50 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and sonicated on ice with a Branson 250 sonifier (Branson Ultrasonics Corp., Danbury, CT), at an output of 50, three times for 30 s with a 2-min resting. The supernatant from a 100,000 × gcentrifugation of the cell suspension was mixed for 1 h with 1.5 ml of the Ni-NTA-agarose that was pre-equilibrated in Buffer B. A column (2.5 cm × 0.5 cm2) containing the resin and protein was washed with 20 volumes of Buffer B and then with 10 volumes of Buffer B containing 0.5 m NaCl and 10% glycerol. The AspRSs were eluted with Buffer B containing 250 mmimidazole. The M. thermautotrophicus AspRS was further purified on a Superdex 200 column (11 cm × 3 cm2,Amersham Biosciences) in Buffer C (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 0.4 m KCl, 0.1 mm Na2-EDTA, 5 mm β-ME, 5% glycerol). The AspRSs were concentrated on polyethylene glycol (PEG; 15,000–20,000 Mr in dialysis tubing (12,000–14,000 molecular weight cut-off) and dialyzed into Buffer C containing 20 mm KCl and 50% glycerol (v/v) for storage at −20 °C. The M. thermautotrophicus Asp-tRNAAsn amidotransferase containing a C-terminal His6 tag on the GatB subunit was also purified by this method, but it included an additional wash of the Ni-NTA column with 10 volumes of Buffer B containing 50 mmimidazole. P. kodakaraensis AspRS purification (10Schmitt E. Moulinier L. Fujiwara S. Imanaka T. Thierry J.-C. Moras D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5227-5237Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) was performed with modifications. Cells (26 g) were resuspended in 250 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 5 mm β-ME, 4 μg/ml lysozyme, and one Complete protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) and incubated overnight. Cells were lysed by 10 min of sonication, as described above, for 2 s plus 2 s of resting. An extract was prepared by centrifugation at 11,000 ×g for 30 min. The extract was heat-treated at 80 °C for 15 min to precipitate the majority of the E. coli proteins and centrifuged as above. Additional proteins were removed with a 0–50% (saturated) ammonium sulfate precipitation plus centrifugation, and the AspRS was precipitated with 50–80% (saturated) ammonium sulfate. The centrifuged precipitate was resuspended in 10 ml of water, dialyzed overnight against Buffer D (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm β-ME) and applied to a 20-ml UnoQR column (Bio-Rad) pre-equilibrated with Buffer D. Protein was eluted at 2 ml/min with a 300-ml linear gradient of 100–600 mm KCl in Buffer D. Active fractions were pooled, dialyzed overnight against Buffer D, concentrated on PEG as described above, and dialyzed again. The protein (1 ml aliquots) was loaded onto the Superdex 200 column (see above) pre-equilibrated in Buffer D. The active fractions were pooled, treated with 0.3% (w/v) streptomycin sulfate to precipitate residual nucleic acids, filtered (0.2 μm), and dialyzed overnight against Buffer D. The enzyme was concentrated on PEG and dialyzed into Buffer D containing 50% glycerol (w/v) for storage at −20 °C. Because the organisms used here grow in very diverse environments, the aminoacylation reaction conditions were optimized for each enzyme as well as for the tRNA source. The pH of each buffer stock, at 10-fold concentration, was adjusted at the temperature used in the assay. M. thermautotrophicus grows optimally at 65–70 °C at a neutral pH (22Zeikus J.G. Wolfe R.S. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 109: 707-713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, for the M. thermautotrophicus AspRS, pH 7.0 (HEPES-KOH) and 37–60 °C were used for the assays. Using unfractionated tRNA, aminoacylation activity with the P. kodakaraensis AspRS reportedly drops above 65 °C (23Fujiwara S. Lee S. Haruki M. Kanaya S. Takagi M. Imanaka T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Under our conditions, the optimal activity for this enzyme was at 60 °C and pH 6.0 (not shown), and therefore pH 6.0 (MES-KOH) and 45–60 °C were used. F. acidarmanus was isolated from a habitat at 40 °C and at a pH between 0 and 1. The intracellular pH values ofFerroplasma species have not been reported. However, the intracellular pH for their phylogenetic relative, Thermoplasma acidophilum, was pH 6.0 when the extracellular pH ranged from 0.5 to 3.0 (24Michels M. Bakker E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 231-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At 37 °C, the optimal activity of the F. acidarmanus AspRS was at pH 6.0 (not shown), and so pH 6.0 (MES-KOH) and 37 °C were used. For asparaginylation and aspartylation assays in cell extracts, cells (1 g) of M. thermautotrophicus, M. marburgensis, and P. furiosus were resuspended in 5 ml of Buffer C with 1 mm benzamidine-HCl and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and sonicated for 10 min as described above. The supernatant from a 100,000 × gcentrifugation was filtered (0.45 μm), concentrated on PEG, and dialyzed into Buffer C with 50% glycerol. The reactions contained 50 mm buffer (see above), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 2 μm transcript, 1.6 μg/ml protein extract, and 25 μm [14C]Asn or [14C]Asp. To avoid possible contamination of [14C]Asp in the [14C]Asn, [12C]Asp (1 mm) was included in the asparaginylation reactions, although omitting [12C]Asp did not alter the results for the P. furiosus extract (not shown). Prior to the assay, the transcripts were reannealed by heating to 90 °C, followed by gradual cooling to 25 °C, and including the addition of 2 mm MgCl2 at 60 °C. Except where noted, all AspRS reactions contained 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, and 5 mm DTT and included 100 mm or 50 mmbuffer (see above) with unfractionated or transcript tRNA, respectively. Assays with unfractionated tRNA additionally contained 80 μm [14C]Asp, 10 μm tRNA, and 5–25 nm of AspRS. Assays with transcripts additionally contained 12.5 μm [3H]Asp, 12.5 μm unlabeled aspartate, and 50 nm F. acidarmanus AspRS or 100–200 nm M. thermautotrophicus AspRS. Reactions with P. kodakaraensis AspRS and transcripts contained 50 mmMES, 50 mm KCl, 16 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP, 5 mm DTT, 10 μm[3H]Asp, 140 μm unlabeled aspartate, and 100–200 nm P. kodakaraensis AspRS. To obtain aminoacylation curves, 10-μl aliquots of the reaction were removed at various time intervals and spotted onto a 3MM filter disk. The filters were washed with shaking for 10–15 min each in 10, 10, and 5% trichloroacetic acid, respectively. For washes involving [3H]Asp, 10 mm unlabeled aspartate was included in the trichloroacetic acid solutions. The filters were rinsed in 95% ethanol, dried, and counted in 3 ml of Ultima Gold scintillation fluid (Packard Instruments). The [14C]Asp-tRNA substrate for the amidotransferase assay was prepared in 100 mm buffer (see above), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, 5 mm DTT, 80 μm[14C]Asp, and 10 μm unfractionated tRNA. Concentrations of the AspRSs were 25 nm for M. thermautotrophicus AspRS, 10 nm for P. kodakaraensis AspRS, and 5 nm for F. acidarmanus AspRS. After incubation at the relevant temperature for 40 min, the substrate was isolated by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation as described (15Curnow A.W. Tumbula D.L. Pelaschier J.T. Min B. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12838-12843Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The tRNA amidotransferase assay has been described also (15Curnow A.W. Tumbula D.L. Pelaschier J.T. Min B. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12838-12843Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Although the optimal growth temperature ofM. thermautotrophicus is near 65 °C, the reaction with the His-tagged M. thermautotrophicus Asp-tRNAAsnamidotransferase was performed at 37 °C as a compromise between optimal enzyme activity and the stability of the reaction product. The transamidation route to Asn-tRNA was suggested in the archaea when direct asparaginylation of tRNA could not be obtained inHaloferax volcanii or inMethanothermobacter (18Tumbula D.L. Becker H.D. Chang W.-Z. Söll D. Nature. 2000; 407: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 25Gupta R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9461-9471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Curnow A.W. Ibba M. Söll D. Nature. 1996; 382: 589-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, direct asparaginylation of unfractionated tRNA has been observed in the pyrococcal species P. furiosus (18Tumbula D.L. Becker H.D. Chang W.-Z. Söll D. Nature. 2000; 407: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Using a tRNAAsn transcript, we tested the ability of archaeal cell extracts to directly charge the tRNA with asparagine or, alternatively, with aspartate to provide a substrate for the GatCAB amidotransferase. The P. furiosus extract was able to asparaginylate the transcript directly, whereas the Methanothermobacterextracts had no such activity (Fig.2 A). However, theMethanothermobacter extracts could form Asp-tRNAAsn, whereas the P. furiosus extract lacked this ability (Fig. 2 B). This result confirms the nondiscriminating nature of M. thermautotrophicus AspRS that was predicted by the presence of a GatCAB tRNA amidotransferase (18Tumbula D.L. Becker H.D. Chang W.-Z. Söll D. Nature. 2000; 407: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Therefore, some archaea have a discriminating AspRS and an AsnRS (Fig.1 A), whereas others use a nondiscriminating AspRS and the GatCAB amidotransferase for Asn-tRNA formation (Fig.1 B). To identify whether the archaeal AspRSs possess different forms of tRNAAsn discrimination, the enzymes from three euryarchaea, M. thermautotrophicus,P. kodakaraensis, and F. acidarmanus, were expressed in E. coli and purified. For the substrate, unfractionated tRNA was purified from M. marburgensis (the same genus as M. thermautotrophicus) and P. furiosus (the same genus as P. kodakaraensis). The aspartylation levels of both tRNA preparations were tested with the AspRSs because discrimination can arguably be affected by differences in the sequence or modification of"
https://openalex.org/W2092719341,"To understand the role of the CCAAT binding factor (CBF) in transcription during the cell cycle, we studied the mouse topoisomerase IIα (topo IIα) promoter, which is activated during the late S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle and contains multiple CBF binding sites. Mutational analysis of the promoter shows that CBF binding to an inverted orientation of the CCAAT motif in the topo IIα promoter, but not to a direct orientation, is required for transcription activation during the cell cycle. In contrast, analysis of the promoter in an in vitroreconstituted transcription system shows that CBF activates transcription of the topo IIα promoter irrespective of the orientation of the CBF binding sites. This analysis demonstrates that only one of the three transcription start sites of the topo IIα promoter is stimulated by CBF, indicating that transcription activation by CBF is dependent on basal promoter structure. Interestingly, mutations of the start site that abolish CBF-dependent transcription activation in vitro do not inhibit activation of the promoter during the cell cycle. Consistent with this observation, expression of a truncated CBF-B subunit lacking a transcription activation domain, which inhibits activity of a collagen promoter, does not affect activity of the topo IIα promoter in fibroblast cells. In contrast, expression of an allele-specific CBF-B mutant that binds high affinity to a mutant CBF binding site containing a CCAAC motif revives transcription activation of an inactive mutant topo IIα promoter containing CCAAC during the cell cycle. Altogether, this study indicates that CBF binding, but not conventional CBF activation domains, are required for activation of the topo IIα promoter during the cell cycle. Considering these results together with results of another recent study, we hypothesize that binding of CBF that disrupts the nucleosomal structure in the topo IIα promoter is a major function of CBF by which it regulates the cell cycle-dependent transcription of the topo IIα promoter and possibly many other cell cycle-regulated promoters containing CBF binding sites.

Mammalian cells contain two topo II isoforms, 170-kDa topo IIα and 180-kDa topo IIβ. Although the two isoforms are structurally very similar, they differ with respect to several biochemical and pharmacological properties, including sensitivity to topo II-targeting drugs and regulation of synthesis during cell cycle. Whereas the level of topo IIβ is constant throughout the cell cycle, the expression of topo IIα varies during the cell cycle. The topo IIα level is very low at G0/G1 phase, begins to increase in late S phase, and is high at G2/M phase. Moreover, the expression of the topo IIα gene is almost undetectable in quiescent or differentiated cells but is present in proliferating cells of all normal tissues of mice and humans as well as in various human tumors. Thus, it is believed that the topo IIα isoform plays a major role during chromosome segregation in proliferating cells (1Isaacs R.J. Davies S.L. Sandri M.I. Redwood C. Wells N.J. Hickson I.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 121-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 2Withoff S., De Jong S., De Vries E.G.E. Mulder N.H. Anticancer Res. 1996; 16: 1867-1880PubMed Google Scholar). To understand transcriptional regulation of the topo IIα gene during cell proliferation, the promoter of the topo IIα gene was isolated from various mammalian species. The topo IIα promoter does not contain a consensus TATA motif. The most conserved feature of this promoter is that it contains multiple CCAAT motifs, which are located mostly in inverted orientation. The activity of the promoter is regulated by various external stimuli, such as heat shock, growth arrest, and stages of the cell cycle, and also by the p53tumor suppressor protein. Studies have shown that the CCAAT motifs play a critical role in the transcription regulation of this promoter by these various agents (3Furukawa M. Uchiumi T. Nomoto M. Takano H. Morimoto R.I.

Chem. 2000; 275: 4435-4444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we showed that the mammalian heterotrimeric CCAAT binding factor (CBF) regulates expression of the cellular topo IIα gene as well as transcription activity of the topo IIα promoter. We also showed that inactivation of CBF in mouse fibroblast cells by expression of a dominant-negative CBF subunit results in retardation of cell growth. Analysis of the mRNA profile showed that the inactivation of CBF in fibroblasts decreases the expression of only a small number of cellular genes, including topo IIα andE2F1, which are regulated during cell growth. The results implied that CBF might be primarily involved in transcription of growth-regulated genes in cultured mammalian cells. Because the promoters of various growth-regulated genes, such as topo IIα, cyclin B1, CDC25C, E2F1, and thymidine kinase, are activated at different stages of the cell cycle and contain multiple CBF binding sites (8Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B.

EMBO Report. 2001; 2: 1018-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that these promoters are highly dependent on CBF activity in vivo. One paradox of this hypothesis is that the DNA binding activity of CBF is unchanged during the cell cycle; thus, it remains unclear how constitutively expressed CBF is involved in regulating transcription of various promoters in specific cell-cycle stages. We recently analyzed the transcription activity of the topo IIα promoter using an in vitro reconstituted nucleosomal assembled DNA template (13Coustry F., Hu, Q. de Crombrugghe B. Maity S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40621-40630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The study showed that binding of CBF to the nucleosomal topo IIα promoter disrupts the regular nucleosomal structure over the CBF binding sites as well as over the downstream promoter region containing the transcription start site. Interestingly, binding of CBF to the nucleosomal topo IIα promoter strongly activated transcription. The study also revealed that although the topo IIα promoter contains three major transcription start sites, CBF activates transcription primarily through one of them. The CBF-mediated activation requires activation domains of CBF, which, however, do not play any role in the CBF-mediated nucleosomal disruption. When a mutant nucleosomal promoter containing mutations in all CBF binding sites was used in the in vitro transcription reaction, no transcription from any of the three start sites was observed. This observation suggested that binding of CBF to the topo IIα promoter disrupts the nucleosomal structure, which allows transcription from all three start sites, whereas the activation domains of CBF stimulate transcription through only one of the start sites. Altogether, the results of the study indicate that CBF controls topo IIα promoter activity by two mechanisms, nucleosomal disruption and direct transcription activation. However, the mechanism by which CBF controls activation of the topo IIα promoter during the cell cycle remains to be determined. In the present study, we show that mutations in all CBF binding sites located in inverted but not in direct orientation that are present in the topo IIα promoter completely abolish transcription activation of the promoter during cell-cycle progression. Analysis of the promoter in an in vitro reconstituted transcription system shows that CBF activates transcription of topo IIα regardless of the orientation of the CBF binding site and controls transcription of only one of the three start sites present in the promoter. Mutations of the transcription start site completely abolish transcription activation by recombinant CBF in vitro but do not affect activation of the promoter during the cell cycle. Two CBF-B mutants, one containing a truncated CBF-B lacking transcription activation domain and the other containing an allele-specific CBF-B mutant, were expressed in mouse fibroblast cells to determine the role of CBF in the cell cycle-dependent transcription activation. This study reveals that the cell cycle-dependent activation of the topo IIα promoter is exclusively dependent on CBF binding but not on CBF-dependent transcription activation mediated by the glutamine-rich domains of CBF. To construct the 7CCAAT reporter plasmid, the sequence between −250 and +110 of the mouse topo IIα gene promoter (6Adachi N. Kobayashi M. Koyama H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR and cloned between the SacI andXhoI sites of the pGL3-basic vector. The reporter plasmid constructs 4CCAAT, 3CCAAT, and 2CCAAT with deletions at the 5′ end of the topo promoter were generated by PCR using the 7CCAAT template. The constructs W12, W34, W1, W2, W3, W4, and M1–4 harboring point mutations (CCAAT to CCAAA) in the CBF binding sites were obtained by PCR using the 4CCAAT template as described previously (13Coustry F., Hu, Q. de Crombrugghe B.

The construct W3mt carrying point mutation (CCAAT to CCAAC) was generated by PCR using the W3 template. The constructs −170/+29, −170/+16, −170/+4, and −170/−18 with deletions at the 3′ end of the topo IIα promoter were generated by PCR using the 4CCAAT template. The constructs M−15/−13, M−11/−9, M−8/−6, M−5/−3, M−2/+1, and M+2/+4 carrying nucleotide substitutions in the start site II region were obtained by PCR using −170 + 4 as a template.

Mouse fibroblast NIH3T3 cells were transfected with plasmids using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen), and expression of the luciferase gene was measured as described previously (7Hu Q.

For the experiments illustrated in Figs. 8and 9, a mouse fibroblast cell line, 3T3TtA, expressing tetracycline-responsive transcription activator (TtA), which was generated in a previous study (7Hu Q. Maity S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4435-4444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), was used for DNA transfection. To make a stably integrated 7CCAAT reporter plasmid into NIH3T3 cells, both 7CCAAT and ptk-Hyg plasmids (9:1 ratio) were first transfected, and then cells were selected in the presence of 200 μg/ml hygromycin. Each of the topo IIα promoter-luciferase plasmid constructs were analyzed by a minimum of three independent DNA transfection experiments, and an average reporter activity with standard deviations was calculated from results of all the experiments, which are shown in Tables I and II and Figs. 8 and 9.Figure 9The activity of a mutant topo IIα promoter in the presence of an allele-specific CBF-B mutant.

The wild-type CBF-B (Bwt) and the mutant Bmt307 were first expressed after transfection in fibroblast cells, and then each of the polypeptides was purified from the fibroblast cell extracts using anti-FLAG antibody affinity resin. Each of the polypeptides was copurified with the cellular CBF-A/CBF-C complex and used in a DNA binding assay with a labeled promoter fragment of W3mt (lanes 2 and3). The DNA binding reaction in lane 4 contained anti-CBF-B antibody, which was first incubated with the Bmt307 complex and then assayed for DNA binding. D, activity of the W3mt promoter in the presence of Bmt307 in fibroblast cells. The promoter activity was measured with or without expression of the mutant CBF-B, Bmt307, both in the unsynchronized cells and at different time points of serum stimulation of the synchronized cells. Analysis of promoter activity during serum starvation and stimulation was done as described in Table I. The activity of the W3 promoter is shown for comparison. The fold activation of the W3 promoter during the cell cycle is different from that shown in Table I and is possibly due to a different fibroblast cell line.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IActivity of a collagen promoter and various deletion and nucleotide substitution mutants of the topo IIα promoter during the cell cyclePlasmid constructsRelative promoter activity at different time points after serum stimulationFold induction0 h12 h18 h24 h7CCAAT12.2 ± 0.614.4 ± 1.160.7 ± 4.392.0 ± 5.77.44CCAAT13.9 ± 1.011.0 ± 0.758.0 ± 4.2100.0 ± 7.27.23CCAAT5.5 ± 0.33.7 ± 0.16.6 ± 0.220.9 ± 0.93.82CCAAT3.2 ± 0.12.7 ± 0.13.5 ± 0.05.6 ± 0.31.7W125.4 ± 0.34.6 ± 0.321.9 ± 1.830.7 ± 2.95.7W3416.1 ± 1.113.3 ± 1.262.5 ± 3.799.3 ± 7.86.2W18.2 ± 0.57.0 ± 0.420.2 ± 1.230.0 ± 2.23.7W23.1 ± 0.13.1 ± 0.22.8 ± 0.13.4 ± 0.31.1W39.7 ± 0.48.0 ± 0.430.4 ± 1.646.0 ± 3.04.7W44.1 ± 0.22.4 ± 0.04.7 ± 0.29.1 ± 0.52.4M1–41.3 ± 0.01.0 ± 0.10.7 ± 0.10.6 ± 0.00.46FC118.3 ± 1.115.5 ± 0.911.4 ± 0.59.4 ± 0.50.5Each of the promoter constructs was analyzed after transient transfection in mouse fibroblast cells followed by starvation with a 0.5% serum concentration and subsequent stimulation with a 10% serum.

For cell-cycle analysis, fibroblast cells were starved by incubation in media containing a low concentration of serum (0.5%) for 48 h and then stimulated for growth in media containing 10% serum. To determine the cell cycle stage, cells were harvested at different times after serum stimulation and then analyzed by flow cytometry using propidium iodide staining as described previously (7Hu Q. Maity S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4435-4444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To analyze the activity of the reporter constructs during the cell cycle, fibroblast cells were first transfected with plasmids, and then 24 h after transfection, cells were starved with 0.5% serum for 48 h and subsequently activated with 10% serum. Full-length and truncated recombinant CBF subunits were generated as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase and purified as described previously (15Sinha S. Kim I.-S. Sohn K.-Y. de Crombrugghe B. Maity S.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The mutant CBF-B subunit (Bmut) was expressed as a fusion with His6 tag and was purified as described before (16Liang S.G. Maity S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31590-31598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For the experiment in Fig. 9 C, the wild-type and the mutant CBF-B (Bwt and Bmt307) were expressed in the 3T3TtA fibroblast cell line after transient transfection of either pTRE-FLAGB or pTRE-FLAGBmut307 plasmid construct. Each of the expressed CBF-B polypeptides was purified from fibroblast cellular extracts using anti-FLAG-agarose affinity resin (Sigma). Each CBF-B was copurified with the cellular CBF-A and CBF-C subunits present in the fibroblast cells. The in vitrotranscription reactions were performed using nuclear extracts prepared from HeLa cells. Preparation of nuclear extracts, condition of thein vitro transcription reactions, and subsequent analysis of RNAs using the primer extension method were done as described previously (17Coustry F. Maity S.N. Sinha S. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14485-14491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The binding of CBF with the topo IIα promoter was analyzed using both electrophoretic mobility shift assay and DNase I footprinting methods as previously described (18Maity S.N. Golumbek P.T. Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B. Science. 1988; 241: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). For DNase I footprinting analysis shown in Fig. 3, a topo IIα promoter fragment was isolated from either the 4CCAAT or the M1–4 construct bySacI and XhoI digestion, labeled at theXhoI end using Klenow, and then used in the DNA binding reactions. For the experiment in Fig. 4, 35-bp double-stranded oligonucleotides w1, w2, w3, and w4 corresponding to the CCAAT motifs located at −26, −46, −66, and −117 (respectively) in the topo IIα promoter were synthesized, labeled using Klenow, and then used in the DNA binding reactions. In the w1, w2, w3, and w4 oligonucleotides, the CCAAT motif is located in the middle and is flanked by 15-bp topo IIα promoter sequences on both sides. Nuclear extracts used for DNA binding were prepared according to a method described by Schreiber et al. (19Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar).Figure 4The activity of CBF during cell cycle progression of mouse fibroblast cells. Four oligonucleotides, w1, w2, w3, and w4, corresponding to the CCAAT motifs located at −26, −46, −66, and −117, respectively, in the topo IIα promoter, were labeled and used in the DNA binding reactions containing nuclear extracts prepared from fibroblast cells after 0, 12, 18, and 24 h of serum stimulation. The DNA binding was analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Each of the oligonucleotides binds specifically to CBF present in the nuclear extracts, which was confirmed by a supershift assay using anti-CBF-B antibodies. The figure shows only CBF-DNA complexes for each of the oligonucleotides.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previously, analysis of the mouse topo IIα promoter showed that it contains seven CCAAT motifs that are binding sites of transcription factor CBF/NF-Y (6Adachi N. Kobayashi M. Koyama H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 13Coustry F., Hu, Q. de Crombrugghe B. Maity S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40621-40630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To understand the role of the CCAAT motifs in transcription during the cell cycle, we compared the activity of the topo II promoter with that of a collagen promoter, which contains four CBF binding sites, during cell cycle progression in mouse fibroblasts. In previous studies, we showed that the collagen promoter is strongly activated by CBF in an in vitro reconstituted transcription system (14Coustry F. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 468-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar,17Coustry F. Maity S.N. Sinha S. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14485-14491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The transcription activity of the topo IIα promoter in fibroblast cells was determined after either the promoter was stably integrated in chromosome or the promoter construct was transiently transfected in fibroblast cells. The cells were first synchronized in a quiescent state (G0/G1) by serum starvation, and cell-cycle progression was initiated by the addition of serum. The state of synchronization and cell-cycle progression was analyzed by flow cytometry methods using both propidium iodide and bromodeoxyuridine labeling. The results showed that after serum starvation, about 85% of fibroblast cells enter into G0/G1 phase and that the induction of S phase starts at 12 h and reaches the maximum level at 16 h after serum stimulation, similar to what was seen in our earlier studies (7Hu Q. Maity S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4435-4444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The activity of stably integrated topo IIα promoter, which is very low in quiescent cells, increased 5-fold at 18 and 24 h after serum addition (Fig. 1 A). Similarly, the activity of transiently transfected topo IIα promoter was increased about 6-fold at 18 and 24 h after serum addition. This result shows that the activity of the topo IIα promoter is induced at late S phase to G2/M phase. This observation is in good agreement with earlier studies of both human and mouse topo IIα promoters (1Isaacs R.J. Davies S.L. Sandri M.I. Redwood C. Wells N.J. Hickson I.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 121-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 6Adachi N. Kobayashi M. Koyama H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In contrast, the transcription activity of the collagen promoter was not induced after serum stimulation (Fig. 1 B). Instead, the collagen promoter activity was lower at late S and G2/M phase compared with the activity of quiescent phase cells before serum stimulation. This indicates that although both the topo IIα and the collagen promoters contain multiple CCAAT motifs, the cell cycle-dependent stimulation of promoter activity is specific to the topo IIα promoter. To determine the role of multiple CCAAT motifs in the topo IIα promoter activity during cell-cycle progression, we generated several deletion promoter constructs containing decreasing numbers of CCAAT motifs (Fig.2 A). The activity of the deleted constructs was analyzed during the cell cycle after transient transfection. This shows that the promoter containing four CCAAT motifs (4CCAAT) is activated very similar to the promoter containing seven CCAAT motifs during the cell cycle (TableI). The promoter containing three CCAAT motifs (3CCAAT) is also activated during the cell cycle but to a lesser extent than the promoter containing either four or seven CCAAT motifs. In contrast, the promoter containing two CCAAT motifs (2CCAAT) is activated very little. This shows that the four proximal CCAAT motifs in the topo IIα promoter are required for a high level of promoter activation during the cell cycle. To determine the role of individual CCAAT motifs in the promoter activity, single nucleotide substitution mutation was introduced in each of the four CCAAT motifs in the 4CCAAT topo IIα promoter construct (Fig. 2 B). The interaction of recombinant CBF with both wild-type 4CCAAT promoter and a mutant M1–4 promoter containing mutations in all four CCAAT motifs was analyzed by the DNase I footprinting method. This shows that CBF interacts with all four CCAAT motif regions in the 4CCAAT promoter (Fig.3, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, no interaction of CBF with the M1–4 promoter was observed (lanes 3 and 4), indicating that single nucleotide substitution mutation in each of the four CCAAT motifs results in complete abolition of CBF binding. When a mutant promoter containing a single wild-type CCAAT motif at various locations (W1, W2, W3, or W4) was analyzed, CBF only interacted with the respective wild type but not with the mutant sites (data not shown). In this regard, it is important to mention that the CBF binding sites in the W1, W3, and W4 promoters are located in inverted orientation as ATTGG, whereas the site in W2 is located in direct orientation. Analysis of promoter activity for each of the mutants shows that each of the three promoters, W1, W3, and W4, containing a single CBF binding site in the inverted orientation is activated during the cell cycle in a manner very similar to the 4CCAAT promoter (Table I). In contrast, the M1–4 promoter containing mutations in all four CBF sites was not activated"

The AF-1 located at the N-terminal end (A/B region) is ligand-independent and contains conserved serine residues that are “constitutively” phosphorylated by the cdk7 subunit of the general transcription factor TFIIH (2Rochette-Egly C.

In contrast, the AF-2 domain, located in the C-terminal E region is ligand-dependent (4Laudet V. Gronemeyer H. Nuclear Receptor Factsbook. Academic Press, London2001Google Scholar). It contains the ligand-binding domain and requires the integrity of a highly conserved amphipathic α-helix, the AF-2 core that corresponds to helix 12. Retinoic acid (RA) binding induces a major structural change in the conformation of this helix (5Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Curr. Opin.

It has been established that the AF-2 of a given RAR isotype cooperates with the AF-1 of the same or different isotypes in a response element and promoter context manner (14Nagpal S. Saunders M.

This observation led to the hypothesis that the cooperativity between AF-1 and AF-2 might be mediated through coactivators interacting simultaneously with the two AFs, as previously shown for PPARγ (16Gelman L.

As the modulating functions present in the AF-1 of RARα and RARγ are different, we speculated that the AF-1 of each RAR isotype might interact with specific intermediary proteins participating to the bridge between the two AFs. The present study was undertaken to determine whether known AF-2 coregulators mediate the synergism between the two AFs of RARs. We found that TIF2 is indeed involved in this synergism and bridges the AF-1 and AF-2 domains of the RARα1 isotype. Moreover our data suggest that this bridging requires additional factor(s), which may account for the distinct isotype-specific activities of RARα and RARγ AF1s. The (17mer-ERE)-TATA-CAT and (17mer)x5-TATA-CAT reporter constructs as well as the RARα, RARγ, and ERα chimeric constructs have been described elsewhere (15Nagpal S. Friant S. Nakshatri H. Chambon P.

Gal4-RARα1(AB), Gal4-RARγ1(AB), Gal4-RARα1(ABS77A), Gal4-RARα1(A), and Gal4-RARα(B) were constructed with PCR-amplified AB, A, or B fragments that were inserted intoXhoI-BglII-digested pG4 M poly II. Deletions in the A region of RARα1 were introduced by double PCR amplification according to standard protocols. GST-RARα(DEF) was previously described (9Voegel J.J. Heine M.J. Tini M. Vivat V.

GST-RARα-AB was constructed with PCR-amplified AB fragments that were inserted intoBamH1-EcoR1-digested pGEX-2T. The different TIF2 constructs (Fig. 1) were described previously (9Voegel J.J.

TIF2.1 deleted for the AD1 domain (amino acids 1007–1147) was constructed by double PCR amplification to generate a HpaI-XbaI fragment containing the appropriate mutation. The other deletions (amino acids 1012–1034, 1031–1073, and 1107–1047 in TIF2.1Δ1, TIF2.1Δ2, and TIF2.1Δ3, respectively) were introduced into TIF2 according to the same protocol. The ADA-2 and SUG-1 expression vectors were previously described (23vom Baur E. Zechel C. Heery D. Heine M.J. Garnier J.M. Vivat V., Le Douarin B. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. Losson R.

Parker and that for CBP was from C. Glass. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected in six-well plates, using the DMRIE-C reagent (Invitrogen). All transfections contained the reporter plasmid, the different receptor chimeric constructs, the β-galactosidase expression vector pCH110, and BlueScript as a carrier. After a 16-h incubation with the DNA, the cells were washed and maintained for a further 24 h in the appropriate medium with or without RA (10−7m). CAT assays were performed using the ELISA method (CAT ELISA, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) after normalization to equal β-galactosidase activity. Expression levels of recombinant proteins in transfected COS-1 cells were determined by standard SDS-PAGE and subsequent electrotransfer to nitrocellulose membranes. Proteins were revealed by immunoblotting and chemiluminescence. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against TIF2 were raised against an epitope within residues 624 and 869. Monoclonal antibodies against the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (2GV3) were as described (26White J. Brou C., Wu, J. Lutz Y. Moncollin V. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2229-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were incubated with bacterial extracts containing the GST proteins and then with rabbit reticulocyte lysates containing 35S-labeled translated protein (TnT T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System, Promega) as described (23vom Baur E.

Bound proteins were recovered in SDS loading buffer, subjected to SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and analyzed by autoradiography of dried gels or by immunoblotting. The observation that both AF-1 and AF-2 of RARs can synergize (14Nagpal S. Saunders M. Kastner P. Durand B. Nakshatri H. Chambon P. Cell. 1992; 70: 1007-1019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 15Nagpal S. Friant S. Nakshatri H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2349-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), led us to evaluate whether this synergy might be mediated through members of the p160 transcriptional coactivators. As the coactivator TIF2 is able to interact independently with the two activation functions AF-1 and AF-2 of several steroid hormone receptors and can bridge their N- and C-terminal domains (17Benecke A. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 22He B. Kemppainen J.A. Voegel J.J. Gronemeyer H. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37219-37225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), we investigated whether TIF2 could mediate the synergy between both AFs of RARα1. COS-1 cells were cotransfected with a hybrid reporter gene comprising an artificial minimal promoter containing a Gal4 binding site juxtaposed to an estrogen responsive element, (17mer-ERE)-TATA-CAT, and the Gal4-RARα(DEF) and RARα1(AB)-ER(C) hybrid constructs (see Fig. 2). Under these conditions, the AF-1 of RARα1 displays very weak if any activity (see Fig. 2 B, lane 8), whereas AF-2 is significantly more active in the presence of RA (see Fig.2 B, lane 3). TIF2 WT enhanced the RA-stimulated transcriptional activity of the isolated AF-2 (Fig. 2 B,lane 4) but not of AF-1 (Fig.2 B, lane 9). A TIF2 mutant lacking the three LXXLL motifs of the nuclear receptor interacting domain (NID), which are necessary and sufficient for interaction with the AF-2 domain of nuclear receptors (TIF2m123 in Fig. 1 A) (9Voegel J.J. Heine M.J. Tini M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 507-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), did not exhibit any stimulatory activity (Fig.2 B, lane 5). When coexpressed together, AF-1 and AF-2 cooperated (Fig.2 B, compare lanes 3 and 10). Overexpression of TIF2 markedly enhanced this effect (Fig.2 B, lane 11), while TIF2m123 failed to do so (Fig. 2 B, lane 12). Interestingly, a mutant TIF2 protein encompassing only the NID (TIF2.5 in Fig. 1 A) acted as a dominant-negative mutant and abrogated the synergy between the two AFs (Fig. 2 B, lane 13). Similar results were obtained with full-length RARα1 in which region C was replaced by the core of the estrogen receptor DNA binding domain, termed ER.Cas (Fig. 2 C). Cotransfection of TIF2WT potentiated the RA-dependent activation of the reporter gene by RARα1-ER.Cas (Fig. 2 D, lane 4), whereas TIF2m123 had no effect (Fig. 2 D, lane 5). Altogether, these results indicate that TIF2 can mediate the synergy between both AFs of RARα1. Moreover, the observation that TIF2.5 acts as a dominant negative, shows that the endogenous factor(s) mediating AF-1/AF-2 synergy of RARα1 are functionally similar to TIF2 and correspond most likely to members of the p160 coactivators family. To further study the molecular basis of the synergy mediated by TIF2, mammalian-bridged two-hybrid experiments were performed in COS-1 cells. The basis of this assay (see Fig.3 A) is that in COS-1 cells neither the AF-1 function present in Gal4-RARα1(AB) (Fig.3 B, lane 5) nor the non-liganded RAR-DEF-VP16 construct (Fig. 3 B, lane 3), activate the (17mer)x5-TATA-CAT reporter gene because AF-1 alone is inactive (see above) and the VP16 activation domain is not recruited to this promoter. However, such a recruitment can occur if a factor binds concomitantly to AF-1 and AF-2. In the presence of RA, coactivators (e.g. p160 proteins) will bind to AF-2, and, provided the p160 proteins can also bind to AF-1, this will finally lead to recruitment of VP16 AD to the Gal4 reporter. Indeed, the activity of the CAT reporter was significantly enhanced (about 3-fold) when RAR(DEF)-VP16 was coexpressed with the A/B region of RARα1 in the presence of RA (Fig. 3 B, lane 7and Fig. 3 C, lane 4), indicating that endogenous factor(s) present in COS-1 cells can bridge the AF-1 and AF-2 domains of RARα1 and therefore recruit liganded RAR(DEF)-VP16 to the promoter. This increase was markedly enhanced (5-fold) upon coexpression of TIF2WT (Fig. 3 B, lane 8 and Fig.3 C, lane 5) but not of TIF2m123 (Fig.3 B, lane 9). When the A/B region of RARα1 was replaced by that of RARγ1 in the bridged two hybrid assay, overexpressed TIF2 did not significantly increase the activity of the CAT reporter (Fig. 3 C,lanes 11–13), confirming that the RAR AF-1 functions are different. This suggests that the effect of TIF2 would be specific for the RARα1 isotype. To assess the selectivity of the RARα1 AF-1/AF-2 mediator effect, we tested whether other coactivators could mediate the observed synergy. Most surprisingly, SRC-1, which is a member of the same p160 coactivator family, was completely inefficient in this bridging assay (Fig. 3 C, lane 6). In addition, neither RIP140, CBP, ADA2, nor SUG1 exhibited any effect (Fig. 3 C, lanes 7–10). Note that none of these coregulators had any significant effect either with the RARγ1 isotype (Fig. 3 C, lanes 14–18). While TIF2 interaction with the AF-2 of nuclear receptors requires the LXXL boxes located in the NID, binding to AF-1 was reported previously to involve residues in the glutamine-rich domain (17Benecke A. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 18Webb P. Nguyen P. Shinsako J. Anderson C. Feng W. Nguyen M.P. Chen D. Huang S.M. Subramanian S.

Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37219-37225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Indeed, in the present bridged two-hybrid experiments, TIF2 lacking this domain (TIF2ΔQ in Fig. 1 A) was unable to bridge the ERα AF-1 and AF-2 domains (Fig. 3 B, compare lanes 15–17). In striking contrast, the same mutant was still able to strongly potentiate the cooperation between the two RARα1 AFs (Fig.3 B, compare lanes 8 and 10), indicating that the glutamine-rich region is not required for mediating the effect of TIF2 on RARα1AF functions. To delineate the region responsible for the effect of TIF2, a series of deletion mutants (9Voegel J.J. Heine M.J. Tini M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 507-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) were tested (Fig. 1 A). The TIF2.10 construct encoding the NID and the N-terminal part of TIF2 (amino acids 1–869) was unable to increase the cooperation between the two AF domains of RARα1 (Fig. 3 D, lane 6). In contrast, a TIF2 fragment from amino acids 624–1287 (TIF2.1) that also contains the NID, has maintained this capacity (Fig. 3 D,lane 7). As expected from the above data, TIF2.1 lacking the Q region (TIF2.3) was still effective (Fig. 3 D, lane 9). However, removal of the subsequent 169 C-terminal amino acids (TIF2.4) made the protein inactive (Fig. 3 D, lane 10). As these amino acids encompass the AD1 (See Fig.1 A), TIF2.1 deleted for this domain (TIF2.1ΔAD1) was constructed. This mutant was also ineffective (Fig. 3 D,lane 12) indicating that TIF2 recruits RARα1 AF-1 through its AD1 domain. The AD1 activation domain harbors several exposed motifs that are candidates for protein-protein contacts. Among them, the conserved LLL motif (amino acids 1080, 1081, and 1084), which is involved in CBP binding (9Voegel J.J. Heine M.J. Tini M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 507-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), is not required for RARα1 AF-1 interaction since its mutation (in TIF2LLL) had no effect (Fig. 3 D, lane 5). Interestingly, sequence alignment studies indicated that among the other motifs, three are not conserved between the different coregulators. Deletion of two of these surfaces (amino acids 1011–1034 and amino acids 1031–1073 in TIF2.1Δ1 and TIF2.1Δ2, respectively, see Fig. 1 A) did not affect TIF2 efficiency (Fig.3 D, lanes 13 and 14). However, deletion of the third one (amino acid residues 1107–1147 in TIF2.1Δ3) decreased significantly TIF2.1 action (Fig. 3 D,lane 15). The TIF2.1Δ3 mutant was also unable to increase the synergy between the two AFs of RARα1 when the Gal4RARα(DEF) and RARα1(AB)-ER(C) hybrid proteins were cotransfected with the (17mer-ERE)-TAT-CAT reporter gene (see Fig. 2 B, lane 15). Note also that in that context, TIF2ΔQ was as effective as TIF2WT in mediating the synergy between the two AFs (Fig. 2 B, lane 14and Fig. 2 D, lane 6). Collectively, these results indicate that TIF2 mediates selectively the cooperation between the AF-1 and AF-2 domains of the RARα1 isotype through a surface located in its AD1 domain. It is interesting to note that this sequence contains a proline-rich motif (KPPXXP) that is not conserved between p160 coactivators and could be recognized by proteins with SH3 or WW domains (27Zarrinpar A. Lim W.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 611-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 28Bedford M.T. Sarbassova D., Xu, J. Leder P. Yaffe M.B. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). As the AF-1 domain of RARα1 is constitutively phosphorylated at serine 77 (See Fig.1 C) (2Rochette-Egly C. Adam S. Rossignol M. Egly J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1997; 90: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) in COS-1 cells, we tested whether phosphorylation of this residue plays a role in the cooperation between the two RARα1 AFs as for other nuclear receptors (20Tremblay A. Tremblay G.B. Labrie F. Giguere V. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 513-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 21Hammer G.D. Krylova I. Zhang Y. Darimont B.D. Simpson K. Weigel N.

Kobayashi Y. Yano T. Yoshikawa H. Masuhiro Y. Kato S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1341-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Mutation of serine 77 into alanine, in Gal4-RARα1(ABS77A) (Fig. 1 C), did not affect the synergy between both AFs of RARα1 (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 18 and 19 to lanes 10and 11). It did not affect either the activity of the CAT reporter nor TIF2 efficiency in the bridged two-hybrid assay (Fig.3 E, compare lanes 2–5), indicating that the ability of TIF2 to bridge the two AFs of RARα1 is AF-1 phosphorylation-independent. To delineate which motif(s) in the A/B region of RARα1 might be responsible for recruiting TIF2, a series of mutants were tested (Fig. 1 A). First, in agreement with the conservation of the B region between the different RAR isotypes (1Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar), we found that deletion of this region did not affect the ability of the AF-1 domain to recruit RARα(DEF)-VP16 to the promoter, nor TIF2 function (Fig. 3 E, lanes 8 and 9). In contrast, deletion of the A region abrogated the activation of the reporter gene either in the absence or presence of TIF2 (Fig.3 E, lanes 6 and 7). Thus the A region of RARα1 would be involved in the recruitment of TIF2. These results were corroborated by using a construct expressing TIF2 fused to the VP16 activation domain (TIF2.1-VP16) (Fig.4 A). Indeed, when coexpressed with Gal4-RARα1(AB), TIF2.1-VP16 activated the promoter (Fig.4 B, lane 4) confirming that it can be recruited by the AF-1 domain of RARα1. Moreover, it was still efficient when coexpressed with Gal4-RARα1(AB) deleted for the B region but not of the A region (Fig. 4 B, compare lanes 6 and8). According to sequence alignment studies, the A region of RARα1 depicts three exposed polar surfaces that are not conserved in the RARγ1 isotype. To delineate which part of the RARα1 A region is responsible for recruiting TIF2, the corresponding sequences were deleted from Gal4-RARα1(AB) (Fig. 1 C) and tested in the bridged two-hybrid assay. The central region encompassing amino acids 25–35 was not considered, due to its highly hydrophobicity and to the prediction that its deletion would impair the whole structure of the A region, thus leading to false results. Deletion of amino acids 36–44 or 45–59 did not affect significantly the activation of the reporter gene both in the absence and presence of TIF2 (Fig. 3 E,lanes 12–15). However, deletion of the N-terminal part (amino acid residues 5–24) caused complete loss of this activation (Fig. 3 E, lanes 10 and 11). The lack of any significant sequence homology between this region and any region in the other RAR isotypes is in agreement with the selectivity for RARα1 in the bridged two-hybrid assay. It is interesting to note that this region harbors a proline-rich motif (PXPPY). The above results suggest that TIF2 may be able to bind simultaneously the AF-1 and AF-2 domains of RARα1 as previously described for other nuclear receptors. However, it is also possible that TIF2 bound to liganded RARα AF-2 recruits the AF-1 domain through an intermediary factor. To assess whether TIF2 interacts directly with the AB domain of RARα1 we used in vitro GST-pulldown assays with recombinant TIF2 protein produced by in vitro translation in rabbit reticulocytes. Surprisingly, TIF2 did not interact with GST-RARα1(AB) (Fig. 4 C, lane 4 and Fig. 4 D,lane 3), while it was fully able to interact with GST-RARαDEF in the presence of RA (Fig. 4 C, lane 6). CBP did not interact either with GST-RARα1(AB) (Fig.4 D), while under our experimental conditions we could detect interaction with ADA-2 (Fig. 4 D), which was previously described to interact also with GR (31Almlof T. Wallberg A.E. Gustafsson J.A. Wright A.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9586-9594Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) thus confirming that GST-RARα1(AB) is functional in this pulldown assay. It is important to point out that the absence of TIF2 interaction with the AF-1 domain of RARα1 does not reflect a partially folded state of this domain. Indeed, no interaction could be detected even when the GST-pulldown assays were performed in buffers containing the natural osmolyte trimethylamine N-oxide, which has been shown to fold the AF-1 of the glucocorticoid receptor into a more compact structure (32Baskakov I. Bolen D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4831-4834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 33Kumar R. Lee J.C. Bolen D.W. Thompson E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18146-18152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) favoring interaction with certain coactivators (data not shown). In the present study, we show that the synergy between the AF-1 and AF-2 domains of the RARα1 isotype involves the coactivator TIF2. Because no direct interaction between TIF2 and the AF-1 domain of RARα1 could be detected, we propose that TIF2 recruits this domain through an adaptor molecule (see Fig. 4 E) as previously described for ERα (30Watanabe M. Yanagisawa J. Kitagawa H. Takeyama K. Ogawa S. Arao Y. Suzawa M. Kobayashi Y. Yano T. Yoshikawa H. Masuhiro Y. Kato S.

Biol. 1999; 19: 5363-5372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). According to our results, such an adaptor would specifically interact on the one hand with the RARα1 AF-1 domain through a motif located at the N-terminal end of the A region and on the other hand with TIF2 via a motif within its AD1 domain. As both these RARα1 and TIF2 motifs depict proline-rich motifs, proteins with at least two WW or SH3 domains (27Zarrinpar A. Lim W.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 611-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 28Bedford M.T. Sarbassova D., Xu, J. Leder P. Yaffe M.B. J. Biol.

Yeast two-hybrid screening experiments with the A/B domain of RARα1 as a bait are presently under way to identify the putative RARα1 AF-1 domain interacting proteins. The same strategy will be used to identify the proteins involved in the synergy between the AF-1 and AF-2 domains of the other RAR isotypes. The goal of these studies is to determine RAR isotype- and/or isoform-specific functions, which may provide at the same time clues to the cell type specificity of AF-1."

The mutations affected at least 3 important functions of the Na+,K+-ATPase: (i) the conformational transitions between E 1 andE 2 forms of dephospho- and phosphoenzyme, (ii) Na+ binding at the cytoplasmically facing sites ofE 1, and (iii) long-range interaction controlling dephosphorylation.

Regardless of the change of conformational equilibrium, all the mutants displayed a reduced apparent affinity for Na+, at least 3-fold for Glu282 → Lys and Glu282 → Asp, suggesting a direct effect on the Na+ binding properties ofE 1. Glu282 → Ala and Glu282 → Gly exhibited an extraordinary high rate of ATP hydrolysis in the mere presence of Na+ without K+ (“Na+-ATPase activity”), because of an increased rate of dephosphorylation of E 2P. These results are in accordance with the hypothesis that Glu282 is involved in the communication between the cation binding pocket and the catalytic site and in control of the cytoplasmic entry pathway for Na+. Glu282 located in the NH2-terminal part of transmembrane helix M3 of the Na+,K+-ATPase was replaced by alanine, glycine, leucine, lysine, aspartate, or glutamine, and the effects of the mutations on the overall and partial reactions of the enzyme were analyzed.

K+-ATPase, the Na+- and K+-transporting adenosine triphosphatase (EC 3.6.1.37) conformational states of the Na+,K+-ATPase phosphorylated conformational states ligand concentration giving half-maximum activation or inhibition putative transmembrane segments numbered from the NH2-terminal end of the peptide chain The Na+,K+-ATPase1present in the plasma membranes of all animal cells is an ion pump that uses the energy derived from hydrolysis of ATP to drive transport of Na+ out of the cell in exchange for K+ taken up (1Glynn I.M. Martonosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. 3. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1985: 35-114Google Scholar). It is a member of the family of P-type ATPases whose common functional characteristic is that they form a phosphorylated intermediate by reaction with ATP at a conserved aspartyl residue. Furthermore, the ion pumps belonging to this family seem to have similar overall structures, and recently the structure of one of the family members, the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, was determined at atomic resolution (2Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic portion comprises three main domains: A (“actuator”), N (“nucleotide,” binds ATP), and P (“phosphorylation,” contains the phosphorylated aspartate). The membrane domain, which binds and translocates the ions, consists of 10 transmembrane helices (denoted M1-M10), of which M4 and M6 are partly unwound to be able to contribute ligands to the ion binding pocket (2Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). During the transport cycle of the Na+,K+-ATPase, the cation binding pocket common to Na+ and K+ opens consecutively to either side of the membrane (1Glynn I.M. Martonosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. 3. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1985: 35-114Google Scholar, 3Albers R.W. Annu. Rev.

The mechanism involves phosphorylated and dephosphorylated enzyme forms, both of which undergo relatively large conformational changes coupled to ion translocation steps (6Jørgensen P.L. Andersen J.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1988; 103: 95-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The cycle begins with the binding of 3 Na+ ions per ATPase molecule to the cytoplasmically facing sites of theE 1 form, whereby the enzyme becomes activated and proceeds to utilization of ATP, which is bound with high affinity to E 1. A “high-energy” phosphoenzyme intermediate, E 1P, is formed, which is spontaneously converted into the “low energy”E 2P phosphoenzyme that releases bound Na+ at the extracellular side of the membrane. Two K+ ions bind with high affinity at the sites in the extracellularly facing configuration, thereby stimulating the hydrolysis of the E 2P phosphoenzyme intermediate, leading to formation of an E 2 form containing K+ trapped within the binding pocket in the protein in a so-called “occluded” state (indicated by K+ in parentheses as “E 2(K2)”). Binding of ATP with low affinity to E 2(K2) accelerates the transition to E 1 and facilitates release of K+ to the cytosol. Previous mutational studies of P-type ATPases have pinpointed highly conserved residues with oxygen-containing side chains in transmembrane segments M4, M5, and M6 as essential to cation binding and occlusion (7–20). The high-resolution crystal structure of the Ca2+-ATPase with bound Ca2+ revealed that indeed these residues donate Ca2+ ligands in the binding pocket (2Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). Although considerable information has been obtained concerning the cation binding residues, much remains to be learned about the conformational changes that couple the binding and release of the cations to the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions occurring in the catalytic site more than 40 Å away. Furthermore, the pathways for migration of the cations to and from the membrane-embedded ligands have not been identified, and these pathways most likely contribute to define the cation binding properties, including the ability to select particular ions. The NH2-terminal part of transmembrane helix M3 is located about midway between the catalytic site and the cation binding residues in M4, M5, and M6. In the Ca2+-ATPase crystal structure, the NH2-terminal part of M3 seems to occupy a strategic position that allows it to interact with M4 as well as the cytoplasmic loop (“L6–7”) connecting M6 and M7 (2Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). The specific Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin binds to this region, whereby it prevents Ca2+ binding and conformational changes (21Nørregaard A. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26598-26601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Zhong L. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12994-12998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A recent mutagenesis study analyzing chimeras with short sequences of the Ca2+-ATPase replaced by the corresponding Na+,K+-ATPase segments has implicated the region in control of Ca2+ binding (23Andersen J.P. Sørensen T.L.-M. Povlsen K. Vilsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23312-23321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). No analysis of the partial reactions of Na+,K+-ATPase mutants with alterations to residues in M3 has previously been reported. In addition to a few conserved residues, M3 contains several polar and charged residues that are not conserved between the Ca2+-ATPase and the Na+,K+-ATPase, and which, therefore, might contribute to define the cation selectivity or other cation specific aspects of these enzymes. In the present study, we have focused on the role of the glutamic acid residue Glu282 located at the NH2-terminal end of M3 (Fig.1). The amino acid residue at the equivalent position in the Ca2+-ATPase is a lysine (Lys252), which is one of 4 residues whose simultaneous replacement in a chimera gave rise to a change of the Ca2+binding properties (23Andersen J.P. Sørensen T.L.-M. Povlsen K. Vilsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23312-23321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the Ca2+-ATPase crystal structure, Lys252 is within hydrogen bonding/van der Waals interaction distance of L6–7 (2Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar), and disruption of this interaction would provide an interesting explanation of the functional change observed in the chimera (23Andersen J.P. Sørensen T.L.-M. Povlsen K. Vilsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23312-23321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It is interesting that the Na+,K+-ATPase has a side chain of opposite charge at this position. In the absence of a high-resolution structure of the Na+,K+-ATPase, there is presently no information available on the interactions of the Glu282side chain in the Na+,K+-ATPase. Glu282 is conserved in all known Na+,K+-ATPase sequences of various species and isoforms, but at the onset of the present study it was unknown whether the glutamate is functionally important. Here, we have tested the importance of Glu282 by studying a series of six Na+,K+-ATPase mutants replacing Glu282 with residues of diverse physicochemical properties: the positively charged lysine present in the Ca2+-ATPase, three hydrophobic residues of various sizes, alanine, glycine, and leucine, the small negatively charged aspartate, and the neutral but polar and isosteric glutamine. Our results demonstrate that the nature of the side chain at position 282 is quite important for the functional properties of the cation binding sites, both in their cytoplasmically and extracellularly facing configuration, and for the conformational changes of the Na+,K+-ATPase. Base substitutions of the codon for Glu282 corresponding to replacement of the glutamic acid residue with alanine, glycine, leucine, lysine, aspartate, and glutamine were introduced into the cDNA encoding the ouabain-resistant rat α1-isoform of the Na+,K+-ATPase by use of oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (24Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 85: 3314-3318Google Scholar, 25Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Clarke D.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

Following transfection of COS-1 cells with the wild-type or mutated rat α1cDNA constructs, ouabain-resistant colonies expressing the exogenous rat Na+,K+-ATPase were selected by growth in the presence of 5 μm ouabain, expanded into stable cell lines, and up-regulated to the highest possible expression level by growth at low extracellular K+-concentrations, as described before (11Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1455-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 26Vilsen B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 27Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13340-13349Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Crude NaI-treated plasma membranes were isolated from transfected COS-1 cells expressing wild-type or mutant exogenous rat Na+,K+-ATPase. The concentration of total protein was determined using the dye binding method of Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar). The plasma membranes were made leaky by use of either sodium deoxycholate or alamethicin, and the ATPase activity was measured as described previously (26Vilsen B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 27Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13340-13349Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The ouabain-resistant Na+,K+-ATPase activity associated with the expressed exogenous enzyme was calculated by subtracting the ATPase activity measured at a concentration of ouabain (10 mm) that inhibits all Na+,K+-ATPase activity from that measured at 10 μm ouabain. The turnover rate was calculated as the ratio between the Na+,K+-ATPase activity and the active site concentration (29Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13312-13324Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Studies of the Na+ dependence of steady-state phosphorylation from ATP, the time course of ATP- and ADP-dependent dephosphorylation, and the determination of the active site concentration by phosphorylation in the presence of 150 mmNaCl and oligomycin (20 μg/ml) to inhibit dephosphorylation were carried out at 0 °C as previously described (29Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13312-13324Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Deocclusion of K+ was studied in phosphorylation experiments at 10 °C as previously (15Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10961-10971Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 30Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1999; 35: 11389-11400Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 31Toustrup-Jensen M. Hauge M. Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5521-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The background phosphorylation was determined in the presence of 50 mm KCl without NaCl. To perform rapid kinetic phosphorylation and dephosphorylation experiments at 25 °C, a Bio-Logic quench-flow module QFM-5 (Bio-Logic Science Instruments, Claix, France) was used as previously described (31Toustrup-Jensen M. Hauge M. Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5521-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation rate of enzyme present in the Na+-saturated form was determined in single mixing experiments carried out according to “Protocol 1” (31Toustrup-Jensen M. Hauge M. Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5521-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) except for the use of trichloroacetic acid (7% final concentration) for acid quenching in some cases. Data obtained using trichloroacetic acid precipitation were indistinguishable from those obtained with phosphoric acid. To monitor the rate of the E 1P → E 2P transition or the dephosphorylation ofE 2P, a double-mixing procedure was used to study dephosphorylation of the phosphoenzyme formed either in the presence of 600 mm NaCl to accumulate E 1P (“Protocol 2a”) or in the presence of 20 mm NaCl and 130 mm choline chloride to accumulateE 2P (“Protocol 2b”). Plasma membranes (0.1 mg/ml) suspended in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 3 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 μmouabain with 600 mm NaCl (Protocol 2a) or 20 mm NaCl and 130 mm choline chloride (Protocol 2b), were mixed with an equal volume of the same buffer containing 4 μm [γ-32P]ATP, and the flow was stopped for 5 s to obtain maximal phosphorylation. Dephosphorylation was initiated by mixing with the double volume (Protocol 2a) or same volume (Protocol 2b) of buffer of the same composition except for its content of NaCl, KCl, unlabeled ATP, and choline chloride, producing final concentrations as indicated in the figure legends. Acid quenching was performed at various time intervals by further mixing with trichloroacetic acid as above. Background phosphorylation, obtained in similar but separate experiments in which 50 mm KCl replaced NaCl, was subtracted from each data point. Data normalization, averaging, and nonlinear regression analysis were carried out as previously described (31Toustrup-Jensen M. Hauge M. Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5521-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and the best fits are shown as lines in the figures with the standard errors indicated in the tables. The glutamic acid residue Glu282 of the rat kidney Na+,K+-ATPase 2All numbering of Na+,K+-ATPase residues in this article refers to the sequence of the rat α1 isoform. was replaced with alanine, glycine, leucine, lysine, aspartic acid, or glutamine, and the six mutant enzymes were expressed in COS-1 cells as previously (26Vilsen B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 27Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13340-13349Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The mutant Na+,K+-ATPases with alterations to Glu282 were all able to confer ouabain resistance to the COS cells, indicating the ability of the various mutant pumps to transport Na+ and K+ at rates compatible with cell growth. The expression levels reached for the wild-type and mutant enzymes ranged between 30 and 60 pmol/mg of total membrane protein. The maximum molecular turnover rate for ATP hydrolysis of the exogenous wild-type and mutant enzymes was calculated as the ratio between the maximum Na+,K+-ATPase activity and the active site concentration determined by phosphorylation with ATP in the presence of 10 μm ouabain to preferentially inhibit the ouabain-sensitive endogenous COS cell Na+,K+-ATPase. For all mutants except Glu282 → Gln, the maximum turnover rate was considerably reduced relative to wild type (TableI).Table INa+, K+-ATPase turnover rate and apparent affinities for Na+, K+, ATP, and vanadate in activation or inhibitionMutationTurnover rate1-aThe turnover rate calculated as the ratio between the maximal Na+, K+-ATPase activity (measured in the presence of 130 mm Na+, 3 mm ATP, the optimal K+ concentration, and 10 μm ouabain) and the corresponding active site concentration determined on the same membrane preparation by phosphorylation at 0 °C in the presence of 150 mm NaCl together with oligomycin (20 μg/ml) as described previously (29, 31).

Open table in a new tab Titration of the ouabain concentration dependence of Na+,K+-ATPase activity (data not shown) indicated that the K 0.5 of the exogenous enzyme for ouabain inhibition was 4–6-fold increased for Glu282→ Ala, Glu282 → Gly, Glu282 → Leu, Glu282 → Lys, and Glu282 → Asp and 2-fold increased for Glu282 → Gln, relative to the wild type (K 0.5 for ouabain inhibition of wild type 132 μm). The K 0.5 of the endogenous COS cell enzyme for ouabain inhibition was found to be 0.3–0.8 μm. Taking into account the turnover rate, the ouabain titration data allow calculation of the fraction of active Na+,K+-ATPase molecules in the preparation contributed by the exogenous enzyme in the absence of added ouabain (30Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1999; 35: 11389-11400Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This fraction was 92% for the wild type and varied between 84 and 94% for the mutants (data not shown). Fig. 2 and Table I present the results of experiments in which the Na+ concentration dependence of the Na+,K+-ATPase activity was determined for the expressed wild type and the mutants at saturating concentrations of ATP and K+ in the presence of 10 μm ouabain. The activation by Na+ reflects Na+ binding at the cytoplasmically facing sites of theE 1 form of the enzyme. Relative to the wild-type enzyme, all the mutants displayed a reduced apparent affinity for Na+ (increased K 0.5), corresponding to 1.7–2.5-fold for Glu282 → Ala, Glu282 → Gly, Glu282 → Leu, Glu282 → Lys, and Glu282 → Asp and 1.3-fold for Glu282 → Gln. It is, furthermore, noteworthy that for Glu282 → Lys and Glu282 → Asp the apparent cooperativity was significantly increased relative to wild type (Hill coefficients 1.95 and 1.75, respectively, versus 1.35 for the wild type). Fig. 3 shows K+ titrations of the Na+,K+-ATPase activity at a Na+ concentration of 40 mm. The activation phase reflects stimulation of dephosphorylation of the K+-sensitive phosphoenzyme, E 2P, by K+ binding at the extracellularly facing sites. TheK 0.5 for K+ activation is shown in Table I. All the mutants displayed increased apparent affinity for K+ (reduced K 0.5) relative to wild type, corresponding to as much as 5–10-fold for the mutants with the small hydrophobic substituents, Glu282 → Ala and Glu282 → Gly, 3–4-fold for Glu282 → Lys, Glu282 → Asp, and Glu282 → Leu, and only 1.6-fold for the Glu282 → Gln mutant carrying the most conservative substitution. The increased apparent affinity for K+ may explain the reduced apparent affinity for ouabain (see above), because of the well known K+-ouabain antagonism (32Hansen O. Pharmacol. Rev. 1984; 36: 143-163PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3, furthermore, demonstrates another characteristic feature of the K+ dependence of ATPase activity in these mutants, an unusual ordinate intercept well above the origin, corresponding to as much as 40–69% in Glu282 → Ala and Glu282→ Gly and 13–26% in Glu282 → Lys, Glu282→ Asp, and Glu282 → Leu. This ability to hydrolyze ATP in the mere presence of Na+ without K+(Na+-ATPase activity) is further described below. Fig. 4 shows the ATP concentration dependence of ATPase activity at saturating Na+ and K+ concentrations. The data are presented as percentage of the extrapolated values corresponding to infinite ATP concentration. Whereas Glu282 → Gly was very similar to the wild type, Glu282 → Lys, Glu282 → Asp, Glu282 → Gln, and Glu282 → Leu exhibited increased apparent affinities for ATP relative to the wild type, corresponding to as much as 6–8-fold for Glu282 → Lys and Glu282 → Asp and 1.5–2-fold for Glu282 → Gln and Glu282 → Leu (Table I), and for Glu282 → Ala the apparent affinity for ATP was reduced 2.5-fold relative to wild type. According to the Albers-Post mechanism (3Albers R.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1967; 36: 727-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 4Post R.L. Kume S. Tobin T. Orcutt B. Sen A.K. J. Gen.

Chem. 1972; 247: 6530-6540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where ATP binds with high affinity to E 1 and with low affinity to E 2(K2), the above described effects on the apparent ATP affinity could be secondary to changes in the E 1 ↔ E 2conformational equilibrium. As vanadate binds toE 2 but not to E 1, we used vanadate inhibition to probe the E 1 ↔E 2 equilibrium. The vanadate inhibition profiles for the ATPase activity in Fig. 5 show that relative to the wild type the mutants Glu282 → Lys and Glu282 → Asp displayed a 6–7-fold reduced apparent affinity for vanadate, indicating depletion of theE 2 form, whereas the mutants Glu282→ Ala and Glu282 → Gly displayed a 2–3-fold increased apparent affinity for vanadate, indicating accumulation of theE 2 form. Glu282 → Gln and Glu282 → Leu displayed apparent vanadate affinities very similar to that of the wild type (Table I). To examine the amount of the K+-occluded enzyme at equilibrium in the absence of ATP and Na+ and the rate of K+ deocclusion at low ATP concentration, the previously described phosphorylation assay (15Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10961-10971Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 30Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1999; 35: 11389-11400Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar,31Toustrup-Jensen M. Hauge M. Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5521-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) was applied. Following formation of the K+-occluded complex in the presence of either 100 μm K+(Fig. 6 A) or 1 mmK+ (Fig. 6 B), the phosphorylation was monitored upon 10-fold dilution of the enzyme in a solution containing 1 μm [γ-32P]ATP and 100 mmNa+. The time course of phosphorylation is generally biphasic in this type of experiment, consisting of a rapid phase reflecting phosphorylation of the enzyme pool present initially as the nonoccluded E 1 form, and a slow phase (indicated by the line in Fig. 6) corresponding to deocclusion of the K+-occluded E 2(K2) enzyme pool. The reaction sequence leading to phosphorylation ofE 2(K2) proceeds through the stepsE 2(K2) → E 1→ E 1Na3 →E 1P(Na3), where the release of occluded K+ is rate-limiting. The rate constant describing the slow phase reflecting K+ deocclusion, and its amplitude, corresponding to the relative amount of enzyme initially present as E 2(K2), are shown in Table II. For the wild-type Na+,K+-ATPase, 61% of the enzyme was present in the K+-occluded form following incubation at 100 μm K+. For Glu282 → Lys, Glu282 → Asp, and Glu282 → Gln, the corresponding values were 47, 58, and 61%, respectively, and for Glu282 → Ala, Glu282 → Gly, and Glu282 → Leu, it was 89% or higher (Fig. 6 A). Because as much as 1 mm K+ was required to reach 89% E 2(K2) in the wild type (Fig. 6 B), the apparent affinity for K+occlusion must be at least 10-fold higher in the Glu282 → Ala, Glu282 → Gly, and Glu282 → Leu mutants than in the wild type.Table IICharacteristics of partial reactions and Na+-ATPase activityMutationE 2(K2)Deocclusion rateK 0.5(Na+) phosphorylation2-aFrom Fig. 7.Phosphorylation rate2-bRapid kinetic measurements at 25 °C of the time course of phosphorylation were performed in the presence of 2 μm [γ-32P]ATP, 100 mm NaCl, 40 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 3 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μm ouabain, and oligomycin (20 μg/ml) using the QFM-5 module according to Protocol 1 of “Experimental Procedures.”Na+-ATPase maximum turnover rate2-cThe maximal values in Fig. 8.E 1P/E 2P%s−1μms−1min−1%/%Wild type61 ± 22-dFrom Fig. 6 A, K+ concentration 100 μm.0.025 ± 0.0022-dFrom Fig. 6 A, K+ concentration 100 μm.627 ± 71 (n H = 1.23)29 ± 1405 ± 1419 /812-fFrom Fig. 9.89 ± 32-eFrom Fig. 6 B, K+ concentration 1 mm.0.024 ± 0.0012-eFrom Fig. 6 B, K+ concentration 1 mm.Glu282 → Ala89 ± 32-dFrom Fig. 6 A, K+ concentration 100 μm.0.014 ± 0.0022-dFrom Fig. 6 A, K+ concentration 100 μm.904 ± 72 (n H = 1.23)36 ± 24534 ± 6425 /752-fFrom Fig. 9.Glu282→ Gly98 ± 22-dFrom Fig. 6 A, K+ concentration 100 μm.0.015 ± 0.0012-dFrom Fig. 6 A, K+ concentration 100 μm.1969 ± 204 (n H = 1.43)34 ± 22274 ± 9325 /752-gDetermined as for Fig. 9.Glu282→ Leu93 ± 42-dFrom Fig. 6 A, K+ concentration 100 μm.0.028 ± 0.0032-dFrom Fig. 6 A, K+ concentration 100 μm.1332 ± 135 (n H = 1.23)29 ± 1965 ± 2016 /842-fFrom Fig. 9.Glu282→ Lys47 ± 92-dFrom Fig. 6 A, K+ concentration 100 μm.0.133 ± 0.0272-dFrom Fig. 6 A, K+ concentration 100 μm.1874 ± 127 (n H = 1.38)28 ± 11240 ± 2556 /442-fFrom Fig. 9.71 ± 52-eFrom Fig. 6 B, K+ concentration 1 mm.0.067 ± 0.0062-eFrom Fig. 6 B, K+ concentration 1 mm.Glu282 → Asp58 ± 62-dFrom Fig. 6 A, K+ concentration 100 μm.0.058 ± 0.0082-dFrom Fig. 6 A, K+ concentration 100 μm.1967 ± 115 (n H = 1.35)28 ± 11309 ± 7853 /472-gDetermined as for Fig. 9.Glu282→ Gln61 ± 52-dFrom Fig. 6 A, K+ concentration 100 μm.0.059 ± 0.0082-dFrom Fig. 6 A, K+ concentration 100 μm.749 ± 81 (n H = 1.52)30 ± 1812 ± 3534 /662-gDetermined as for Fig. 9.2-a From Fig. 7.2-b Rapid kinetic measurements at 25 °C of the time course of phosphorylation were performed in the presence of 2 μm [γ-32P]ATP, 100 mm NaCl, 40 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 3 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μm ouabain, and oligomycin (20 μg/ml) using the QFM-5 module according to Protocol 1 of “Experimental Procedures.”2-c The maximal values in Fig. 8.2-d From Fig. 6 A, K+ concentration 100 μm.2-e From Fig. 6 B, K+ concentration 1 mm.2-f From Fig. 9.2-g Determined as for Fig. 9.

https://openalex.org/W2033189536,"The activity of plasmin, the major enzyme responsible for dissolving fibrin clots, is regulated by plasminogen activators, plasminogen activator inhibitors, alpha(2)-antiplasmin, and inflammatory mediators. Recent studies suggest that plasmin activity can be regulated also at the level of plasminogen gene expression. In this study, we characterized the murine plasminogen promoter and 5'-flanking region. The major transcription start site was identified at -83 bp relative to the ATG translational initiation codon. A series of 5'-flanking sequences up to 2400 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site were fused to the luciferase reporter gene and transfected into hepatocytic cells. A 106-bp 5'-flanking region of the murine plasminogen gene demonstrated sufficient functional promoter activity in plasminogen-expressing cells. IL-6 treatment stimulated luciferase activity driven by the 5'-flanking region and an intact consensus IL-6-responsive element at -791, was required for maximal stimulation by this cytokine. These results indicate the presence of regulatory elements in the 5'-flanking region of the murine plasminogen promoter that may regulate murine plasminogen gene expression and, hence, plasmin activity."
https://openalex.org/W2093126623,"Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is an important enzyme in adipocyte and lipid metabolism with complex cellular regulation. Previous studies demonstrated an inhibition of LPL activity and synthesis following depletion of protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms with long term treatment of 3T3-F442A adipocytes with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. To identify the specific PKC isoforms involved, we treated cells with antisense oligonucleotides that block expression of specific PKC isoforms. An antisense oligonucleotide to PKCα inhibited LPL activity by 78 ± 8%, whereas antisense oligonucleotides directed against PKCδ or PKCε had no effect on LPL activity. The change in LPL activity was maximal at 72 h and was accompanied by a decrease in LPL protein and LPL synthetic rate but no change in LPL mRNA, suggesting regulation at the level of translation. However, PKC depletion resulted in no change in the polysome profile, indicating that translation initiation was not affected. However, the addition of cytoplasmic extracts from adipocytes treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or PKCα antisense oligomers inhibited LPL translation in vitro. This inhibition of LPL translation in vitro was lost when the LPL mRNA transcript did not contain nucleotides 1599–3200, thus implicating the 3′-untranslated region of LPL in the regulation of translation by PKC depletion. Both LPL activity and Raf1 activity were decreased in parallel following depletion of either total PKC or specific inhibition of PKCα. An antisense oligonucleotide to RAF1, which inhibited RAF1 activity, also inhibited LPL activity by 48 ± 10%, and this decrease in LPL activity was not accompanied by a change in LPL mRNA. Cells were treated with U0126, a specific inhibitor of the ERK-activating kinases MEK1 and MEK2. Although U0126 inhibited ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation, U0126 had no effect on LPL activity, indicating that MEK/ERK pathways were not involved in this mechanism of LPL regulation. Together, these data indicate that PKCα and RAF1 are important in the translational regulation of LPL in adipocytes and that the mechanism of regulation is probably through an ERK-independent pathway. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is an important enzyme in adipocyte and lipid metabolism with complex cellular regulation.

This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins into free fatty acids and glycerol (1Enerbäck S. Gimble J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1169: 107-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 2Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1995; 6: 291-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The regulation of LPL is complex and may occur at the level of transcription, translation, or post-translational processing. We have previously described translational regulation of LPL in adipocytes in response to thyroid hormone and catacholamines (3Yukht A. Davis R.C. Ong J.M. Ranganathan G. Kern P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 4Kern P.A. Ranganathan G. Yukht A. Ong J.M. Davis R. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2332-2340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This translational regulation is likely due to the presence of an RNA-binding protein that interacts with the 3′-UTR of the LPL mRNA (5Ranganathan G., Vu, D. Kern P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2515-2519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition, the induction of insulin-deficient diabetes in rats results in a translational down-regulation of LPL, also mediated by interactions of transacting factors with the 3′-UTR (6Ranganathan G., Li, C. Kern P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40986-40991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Among the possible mechanisms for diabetes-related changes are alterations in cellular protein kinase C (PKC) (7Kellerer M. Haering H.U. Diabetes Res. Clin. Practice. 1995; 28: S173-S177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). High glucose levels stimulate the formation of cellular diacylglycerol (DAG), a natural activator of PKC (8Craven P.A. Davidson C.M. DeRubertis F.R.

Commun. 1988; 156: 570-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). PKC activity can be attributed to at least 12 enzyme isotypes that have been grouped into three classes by their structures and cofactor requirements: (i) conventional PKCs (PKCα, PKCβI, PKCβII, and PKCγ) are DAG and calcium-dependent, (ii) novel PKCs (PKCδ, PKCε, PKCη, PKCθ, and PKCμ) are DAG-dependent but calcium-independent, and (iii) atypical PKCs (PKCζ, PKCι, and PKCλ) are not responsive to phorbol esters but can bind DAG. We have previously examined the regulation of LPL in adipocytes through modulation of PKC. Depletion of cellular PKC activity, either through prolonged treatment of cells with phorbol ester (11Ballester R. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 260: 15194-15199Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 12Borner C. Eppenberger U. Wyss R. Fabbro D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2110-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) or with drugs that inhibit PKC, resulted in an inhibition of LPL activity through a decrease in translation (13Ranganathan G. Kaakaji R. Kern P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9122-9127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, PKC is important in the regulation of LPL expression, although the precise mechanism for this effect is not known. Antisense oligonucleotides inhibit the expression of the targeted proteins by binding to the sense mRNA or pre-mRNA, thus inhibiting the production of the protein product (14Maier J.A. Ragnotti G. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 205: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Antisense oligonucleotides directed against PKC isoforms and RAF1 have been used to inhibit the expression of the targeted mRNA inside the cell (15Dean N.M. Griffey R.H.

To identify the specific PKC isoforms involved in LPL regulation and to investigate the PKC-mediated pathways regulating LPL expression, we treated 3T3-F442A adipocytes with antisense oligonucleotides to PKC α, δ, or ε. Antisense oligonucleotides to PKCα inhibited both LPL activity and RAF1 activity. In addition, antisense oligonucleotides to RAF1 kinase inhibited LPL expression post-transcriptionally. These studies demonstrate the specific involvement of PKCα and Raf1 kinase in LPL translational regulation in adipocytes. 3T3-F442A cells were obtained from Dr. Howard Green (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented to 10% with calf serum and containing penicillin 10 units/ml and streptomycin 10 μg/ml (Invitrogen). For the experiments, the cells were grown to confluence and stimulated to differentiate in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum and 100 nm insulin for 5–7 days. U0126 (19Favata M.F. Horiuch K.Y.

The 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) was purchased from Sigma, and stock solutions were made in Me2SO. The control cells received the same amount of Me2SO (0.1% v/v). The oligonucleotides were synthesized as phosphorothioate-containing 2-methoxyethyl modifications at positions 1–5 and 15–20 (Isis Pharmaceuticals, Carlsbad, CA). The sequences were as follows: Isis 17251 antisense PKCα, CAGCCATGGTTCCCCCAAC; Isis 17250 scrambled PKCα,CCAGTCACTCGCACCATCGC; Isis 17256 antisense PKCδ, TCCAGGTCAACGCGGCATTC; Isis 17257 scrambled PKCδ, TCGGCCCTGCGGATCTCA; Isis 17260 antisense PKCε,GTCCATGCGATCTTGCGCCC; Isis 17261 scrambled PKCε, GCCAGCTCCGATCTTGCGCCC; Isis 15770 antisense Raf1,ATGCATTCTGCCCCCAAGGA; and Isis 103169 scrambled RAF1, AAGGATCCTCCCTCCATGGA.

The cultures were washed with serum-free DMEM three times to remove Lipofectin and incubated in differentiation medium for 72 h unless otherwise specified. The control cultures were treated with 15 μg/ml of Lipofectin in serum-free DMEM for 6 h. Heparin-releasable and extractable LPL activities were determined as described previously (21Ranganathan S. Kern P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26117-26122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To measure heparin-releasable LPL, the cells were incubated in 1 ml of DMEM containing 10 units/ml heparin for 45 min at 37 °C. After collecting the heparin-released fraction, the remaining LPL was extracted in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 0.2% Triton X-114. The extracts were diluted with three volumes of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 10 units/ml heparin. LPL catalytic activity was measured as described previously using a substrate containing [3H]triolein and fetal bovine serum as a source of apoC-II (22Nilsson-Ehle P. Schotz M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1976; 17: 536-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LPL activity was expressed as nmol of free fatty acid released/h/mg of protein. Northern blotting was performed as described previously (23Ranganathan G. Kern P.A. Doolittle M.H. Reue K. Lipase and Phospholipase Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 329-336Google Scholar). RNA was extracted from adipocytes (24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar), and equal amounts of total RNA (10 μg) from the various treatment groups were analyzed using 2.2 mformaldehyde, 1% agarose gels. Northern blots were probed using32P-labeled human LPL cDNA (25Holm C. Kirchgessner T.G. Svenson K.L. Fredrikson G. Nilsson S. Miller C.G. Shively J.E. Heinzmann C. Sparkes R.S. Mohandas T. Lusis A.J.

The synthetic rate of LPL was measured in adipocytes using a 40-min pulse with [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml), as described previously (26Ong J.M. Kirchgessner T.G. Schotz M.C. Kern P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12933-12938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The unincorporated label was aspirated, and the total cellular proteins were extracted in cell lysis buffer containing 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 2% deoxycholate, 1% SDS, 20 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm leupeptin, and 2 mm EDTA. The extracts were immunoprecipitated using specific polyclonal antibodies as described previously (27Goers J.F. Petersen M.E. Kern P.A. Ong J. Schotz M.C. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. The analysis of proteins LPL, PKCα, or ERK was performed essentially as described earlier (13Ranganathan G. Kaakaji R. Kern P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9122-9127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The cell monolayer was rinsed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the total protein was extracted using the cell lysis buffer described above. The proteins (15 μg) were fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes using 200 mA current for 2–3 h. The membranes were treated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20, and 5% nonfat dry milk overnight at 4 °C. To identify the LPL protein, anti LPL polyclonal antibody (a generous gift from Dr. Ira Goldberg, Columbia University, New York, NY) was applied at 1:2000, followed by anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugate at 1:5000 (Sigma). The reaction product was visualized with chemiluminiscence reagents (AmershamBiosciences). To detect PKC, isoform-specific primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The primary antibodies were applied at a dilution of 1:1000, and the secondary antibodies were applied at 1:5000. The membranes were washed, and the reaction product was visualized using chemiluminescence. To detect activated ERK1 and ERK2, antibodies that react with activation-specific phosphorylation sites on the ERK kinases were purchased from Promega Labs (Madison, WI). The primary antibody was applied at a dilution of 1:5000, and the alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody was applied at 1:500. The reaction product was visualized using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate-nitro blue tetrazolium reagent (Sigma). The cells were washed with serum-free medium and lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 1% Triton X-100 and 2 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm aprotinin, 2 mm leupeptin, and 5 mm sodium vanadate. The cell lysates from control and TPA-treated cells were immunoprecipitated with Raf1 antibody and prebound to protein G-agarose beads. Raf1 activity was measured in vitro using a coupled assay (19Favata M.F. Horiuch K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.W. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A.

In this approach, the immunoprecipitated Raf1 is used to activate recombinant MEK in the presence of ATP (150 μm) and MgCl2 (20 mm), which in turn activates recombinant ERK2. Activation of ERK2 is measured by detection of phosphorylation of myelin basic protein in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The products of the reaction are spotted on phosphocellulose paper, unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP is washed away with dilute phosphoric acid (0.85%), and the filters are counted by liquid scintillation. All of the substrates for the assay were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The polysome profiles were obtained as described previously (3Yukht A. Davis R.C. Ong J.M.

In brief, postmitochondrial supernatants were prepared from control and TPA-treated 3T3-F442A adipocytes and reconstituted with 0.25m sucrose and layered over a 10–50% sucrose gradient. The gradients were centrifuged for 3 h at 180,000 × gat 4 °C. A control extract treated with 5 mm EDTA was included to demonstrate the release of LPL mRNA from the polysomes into the free fraction. The gradients were fractionated into 750-μl fractions, and the UV absorption at A260 was recorded. The fractions were precipitated, and the RNA was extracted. Measurement of LPL mRNA in each fraction was done by reverse transcription-PCR, as described previously (3Yukht A. Davis R.C. Ong J.M. Ranganathan G. Kern P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 6Ranganathan G., Li, C. Kern P.A. J. Biol.

The primers derived from mouse LPL cDNA sequence encoded nucleotides 1158–1177 (upstream primer) and nucleotides 1369–1389 (downstream primer). Equal volumes of each fraction containing 0.1–1 ng of RNA was reverse-transcribed, followed by PCR for 20 cycles. The resulting ethidium bromide-stained gel was imaged and analyzed using the Eagle SightTM 3.0 quantitation and analysis software (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A S-100 fraction was isolated from 6 × 106 adipocytes. The cells were homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer in 5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 35 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the post-nuclear supernatants are centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The proteins are fractionated using 60% ammonium sulfate precipitation at 4 °C for 30 min. The precipitated proteins are dissolved in 200 μl of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm KCl, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol). Equal quantities of cytoplasmic extract proteins (0.5–1.0 μg) were used to analyze effects on in vitro translation of LPL transcripts using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitro translation system (Promega). RNA transcripts of LPL cDNA were prepared as described previously (6Ranganathan G., Li, C. Kern P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40986-40991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). RNA transcripts (0.1 μg) were translated for 60 min in the presence of [35S]methionine using a rabbit reticulocyte lysatein vitro translation system. Translation products were analyzed on SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. All of the assays are done in triplicate, and the data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Changes in LPL activity were analyzed using Student's t test, withp < 0.05 taken as the level of significance. In previous studies, we observed a decrease in LPL activity following depletion of PKC isoforms α, β, δ, and ε after overnight TPA treatment of adipocytes (13Ranganathan G. Kaakaji R. Kern P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9122-9127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To identify the individual isoforms of PKC involved in LPL regulation, we examined the effect of depleting specific PKC isoforms using antisense oligonucleotide technology. Differentiated adipocytes were treated with antisense oligonucleotide to PKCα, δ, or ε or with an equal concentration of an oligonucleotide of scrambled sequence. LPL activity was measured 72 h after addition of the oligonucleotides. Antisense oligonucleotide to PKCα inhibited heparin-releasable LPL activity by 78 ± 8% when compared with control cells treated with Lipofectin alone (Fig.1 A). The scrambled oligonucleotide had no significant effect. Specificity was further demonstrated by the lack of effect observed with antisense oligonucleotide to PKCδ or PKCε (Fig. 1 A). To confirm that the antisense oligonucleotides were effective in depleting specific PKC protein expression, we examined the levels of PKCα, δ, and ε proteins in cell lysates 72 h after oligonucleotide application. As detected by Western blot analysis, the antisense oligonucleotides effectively decreased the levels of the appropriate PKC isoforms when compared with control cells or to cells treated with scrambled oligonucleotides (Fig. 1 B). Thus, the antisense oligonucleotides to PKCδ and ε were effective at reducing expression of those isoforms, but this resulted in no change in LPL activity. The time course of the effect of PKCα antisense oligonucleotide on LPL activity was examined. Following differentiation, adipocytes were exposed to the PKCα antisense oligonucleotide, and heparin-releasable LPL activity was measured at 24, 48, and 72 h after treatment. A decrease in LPL activity was evident 24 h after treatment of cells with oligonucleotide, and LPL activity decreased further at 48 and 72 h after treatment (Fig. 2). There was no corresponding change in LPL activity in the cells treated with scrambled oligonucleotide. Extractable LPL activity was also measured in the cells after 72 h of oligonucleotide treatment when the decrease in heparin-releasable LPL activity was maximum. Extractable LPL activity was also inhibited by 30 ± 4% (p < 0.05) in the antisense PKCα-treated cells and not in the scrambled or control cells (data not shown). There was no change in extractable LPL activity in the cells treated with antisense PKCδ and ε. To study the cellular mechanism involved in the regulation of LPL activity by PKCα, the steady state of LPL mRNA and protein levels were measured, as well as the LPL synthetic rate. Northern blot analysis of LPL mRNA was performed on adipocytes treated with antisense or scrambled PKCα oligonucleotide, along with mock-treated control cells. There was no change in LPL mRNA between the control cultures or those treated with PKCα antisense or scrambled oligonucleotide (Fig.3), indicating that the decrease in activity in the antisense-treated cells did not result from a decrease in LPL mRNA. Western blot analysis of LPL protein indicated a decrease in LPL protein expression in antisense-treated cells as compared with control cells, indicating that the decrease in LPL activity resulted from a decrease in steady-state levels of LPL protein (Fig. 4 A). To study LPL synthesis, cells treated with PKCα antisense or scrambled oligonucleotide were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine followed by immunoprecipitation. The LPL synthetic rate was inhibited in cells exposed to PKCα antisense oligonucleotide but not in those exposed to scrambled oligonucleotide nor in control cells (Fig.4 B).Figure 4Effect of PKC α on LPL protein expression.

Harford J.B. Science. 1989; 246: 870-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). To determine whether translational initiation was inhibited by depletion of PKC using TPA, we studied the distribution of LPL mRNA on the polysomes in control and TPA-treated 3T3-F442A adipocytes. As shown in Fig.5 there was no change in the distribution of LPL mRNA associated with the polysomes between control and TPA-treated adipocytes, indicating that translation initiation was not inhibited. As a control, EDTA was added to the cell lysate to dissociate the mRNA from the polysomes. As shown in Fig. 5, EDTA released the mRNA from the polysomes and yielded a shift of the LPL mRNA to the less dense fractions of the gradient. The translational regulation of LPL both by catacholamines and diabetes (3Yukht A. Davis R.C. Ong J.M. Ranganathan G. Kern P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 6Ranganathan G., Li, C. Kern P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40986-40991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) is mediated by transacting factors and involves the 3′-UTR of LPL. To determine whether a similar mechanism was involved in the regulation by PKCα and to identify the region on LPL mRNA involved in LPL regulation, we studied the in vitrotranslation of LPL mRNA in the presence of cytoplasmic extracts from PKCα or scrambled oligomer treated cells. The cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as described in methods 72 h after transfection of PKCα or a scrambled oligomer when LPL inhibition was maximum. Equal quantities of cell protein from the cytoplasmic extracts were added to a rabbit reticulocyte in vitro translation system containing LPL transcripts or control transcript. If transacting factors interacting with regions of LPL mRNA were present in the PKCα antisense-treated cells, we would detect a decrease in LPL translation in the in vitro translation assay. In this assay, the full-length LPL transcript (3.2 kb) and the LPL transcript lacking the 5′- and 3′-UTR were studied along with a luciferase control transcript (3Yukht A. Davis R.C. Ong J.M. Ranganathan G. Kern P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6, the LPL transcript containing the full-length 3′-UTR was inhibited by 80 ± 5% in the presence of the S-100 extract by the PKCα antisense-treated cell but not by the scrambled oligomer treated extract. There was no significant decrease in translation with the addition of the PKCα antisense-treated extract to the truncated LPL transcript or the control luciferase transcript. PKCα can interact with and activate Raf1 (29Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D.R.U. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). To determine whether Raf1 kinase is involved in the PKC-mediated regulation of LPL, we measured Raf1 activity and LPL activity in adipocytes where PKC isoforms had been depleted by long term TPA treatment. As demonstrated previously (13Ranganathan G. Kaakaji R. Kern P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9122-9127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), TPA treatment inhibited LPL activity by 70 ± 6%. As shown in Fig. 7, there was a parallel decrease in Raf1 activity in the TPA-treated cells. Similar data were obtained when only PKCα was inhibited using the antisense oligonucleotide. As shown in Fig. 7, the depletion of PKCα after treating cells with PKCα antisense oligonucleotide inhibited Raf1 activity and LPL activity by 55 ± 8%, whereas scrambled oligonucleotide had no significant effect on either LPL or Raf1 activity. Thus, decreases in Raf1 activity were accompanied by a significant decrease in LPL activity (Fig. 7). Antisense oligonucleotides to RAF1 were effective and inhibited Raf1 activity by 90 ± 8%. This inhibition of Raf1 activity wa"

Clast3 expression is elevated in cycling cells and down-regulated in cells undergoing growth arrest, indicating that its expression is controlled in a cell cycle-dependent manner. The deduced amino acid sequence ofClast3 cDNA exhibits no significant homology to the known proteins in mammalian and other species. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that Clast3 localizes into discrete nuclear foci. Forced expression of Clast3 results in growth retardation, polyploidy, and generation of multinucleated cells. Treatment of Clast3 transfectants with nocodazole, a spindle-damaging agent, greatly enhances the incidence of the multinucleated cells, suggesting that Clast3 overexpression impairs the same checkpoint activated by nocodazole. Down-regulation of Clast3 expression by antisense oligonucleotides results in a decrease of cells at G2-M phase and a concomitant increase of apoptotic cells. These findings indicate that Clast3 is a novel cell cycle-regulated protein and that its constitutive overexpression induces polyploidy and multinucleation by interfering with the mitotic spindle checkpoint.

Cell. 1992; 71: 543-546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 2Lengauer C. Kinzler W.K. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1998; 396: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (3405) Google Scholar). There are several checkpoints that act to ensure the orderly progression of critical events in the cell cycle. The mitotic spindle checkpoint functions to delay the metaphase to anaphase transition until all pairs of sister chromatids are attached to spindle microtubes, thereby ensuring the correct segregation of duplicated chromosomes into the two daughter cells (3Jallepalli V.P. Lengauer C. Nature Milestones. 2001; : S36-S44Google Scholar, 4Nigg A.E. Nat. Rev. 2001; 2: 21-32Crossref Scopus (1260) Google Scholar). A number of proteins have been identified that sense the kinetochore microtube attachment and regulate the separation of sister chromatids. These include the kinetochore-associated CENPE, MAD, and BUB proteins, the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome and its associated cofactor CDC20, the separin-securin complex, and others (3Jallepalli V.P. Lengauer C. Nature Milestones. 2001; : S36-S44Google Scholar, 4Nigg A.E. Nat. Rev. 2001; 2: 21-32Crossref Scopus (1260) Google Scholar). Biochemical and genetic evidence suggests that kinetochores unattached to spindle microtubes generate a signal that leads to the activation of MAD2. The activated MAD2 inhibits the ubiquitylating activity of anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome and thus the degradation of the securin Pds1, thereby preventing the progression into anaphase. Accumulating evidence indicates that dysregulated expression as well as functional inactivation of these checkpoint proteins can cause abnormal mitosis, leading to chromosomal mis-segregation, apoptosis, polyploidy, or multinucleated cells. In addition to the proteins that directly monitor the microtube attachment and regulate chromosomal segregation, other proteins are also involved in the spindle checkpoint response. The tumor-suppressor P53 has been shown to prevent polyploidy by keeping cells with mitotic spindle damage from reinitiating DNA synthesis (5Cross M.S. Sanchez A.C. Morgan A.C. Schimke K.M. Ramel S.

Overexpression of the antiapoptotic molecule Bcl-xL can cooperate with the loss of P53 to dramatically induce polyploidy by inducing the survival of cells with spindle damage (9Minn J.A. Boise H.L. Thompson B.C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2621-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The cyclin-dependent protein kinase inhibitor p21WAF/CIP1 appears to be involved in the spindle checkpoint by preventing endoreduplication after aberrant mitotic exit of cells (10Chen J.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1631-1641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas overexpression of putative serine/threonine kinase Sak-a or nuclear matrix protein HET/SAF-B or Rad6 can lead to multinucleation (14Fode C.

Viral gene products can also cause abnormal mitosis. Human T-cell leukemia virus type I Tax protein was shown to induce multinucleated cells by directly binding to human MAD1 and thus abrogating the mitotic spindle checkpoint (17Jin D.-Y. Spencer F.

Although the precise mechanisms of polyploidy and multinucleation are still not fully understood, it appears that these cellular and viral gene products induce abnormal mitosis by abrogating the mitotic spindle checkpoint. During the course of searching for genes that are selectively expressed in activated B cells, we have identified a novel growth response gene,Clast3. We show that Clast3 expression is controlled in a cell cycle-dependent manner and that its overexpression interferes with mitotic spindle checkpoint, leading to polyploidy and multinucleation. Goat F(ab′)2 antibodies to mouse IgM were purchased from Southern Biotechnology Associates (Birmingham, AL) and extensively dialyzed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)1 before use. Culture supernatants of a myeloma cell line producing soluble CD40 ligand (CD40L) were used at a 3-fold dilution as described previously (21Wang J. Koizumi T. Watanabe T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Recombinant interleukin 4 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The anti-FLAG antibodies (M5 and M2) and lipopolysaccharides were obtained from Sigma. The horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibodies to mouse IgG1 were obtained from Southern Biotechnology Associates. Splenic B cells were isolated from 8–12-week-old C57BL/6 mice after T-cell depletion with anti-Thy-1 antibodies and complement treatment, followed by Ficoll-Hypaque density centrifugation as described previously (21Wang J. Koizumi T. Watanabe T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The splenic B cells and WEHI231 B lymphoma cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5 × 10−5m2-mercaptoethanol and 50 units of penicillin-streptomycin supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS and 50 units of penicillin-streptomycin. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) from fresh splenic B cells and B cells activated for 2 days with soluble CD40L. Polyadenylated mRNA was then purified with an oligo(dT) cellulose column (AmershamBiosciences). cDNA syntheses and subtraction procedures were performed using the PCR-Select cDNA subtraction kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Candidate gene fragments were resolved in a 1% agarose gel, transferred simultaneously to two nylon membranes, and subjected to a reverse Northern blot with 32P-labeled total cDNAs from either unstimulated or CD40L-activated B cells as probes. Gene fragments that selectively hybridized with cDNA probes of activated B cells were used to isolate the full-length cDNA. The 5′ end of Clast3 mRNA was determined with a RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) following the manufacturer's protocol. The outer and inner primers used to amplify the cDNAs derived from capped mRNA were 5′-CGAATGGCTGCTTGAGAGAA-3′ and 5′-CCACTAGCTTCTTTGACGGT-3′, respectively. For Northern blot analysis, 20 μg of total RNA was resolved in a formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred onto a Hybond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized with a 32P-labeled Clast3 probe. For Western blot analysis, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 1m 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Sigma). The lysate proteins were sonicated for 2 min, heated at 100 °C for 5 min, and resolved in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The resolved proteins were transferred to a cellulose nitrate membrane with a semidry blotter, blocked with 5% nonfat milk, and reacted with the anti-FLAG antibody (M5) and then with horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibodies. The membrane was developed with the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A full-length mouse Clast3 cDNA was first subcloned into pFLAG-CMV-2 (Sigma). After confirming the Clast3 protein expression in COS7 cells, the FLAG-tagged Clast3 cDNA was excised from pFLAG-CMV-2 and subcloned into the pCXN2 expression vector that harbors a neomycin-resistant gene. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with 5 μg of pCXN2-Clast3 construct using Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen) and selected 2 days later with 400 μg/ml Geneticin. Two weeks after the selection, the resulting colonies were picked up with cloning cylinders. NIH3T3 cells were washed once with serum-free DMEM and cultured for 48 h in the same medium containing 0.1% FCS to induce cell cycle arrest. The cells were then washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FCS to remove floating dead cells and cultured in the same medium to allow cell cycle progression. Cells were collected at the indicated time for RNA extraction and DNA content analysis. Exponentially growing cells were treated for 24 h with 50 ng/ml nocodazole or 5 μm Taxol to induce G2-M arrest. For cell cycle analysis, cells were incubated in PBS containing 0.1% RNase A and 0.1% Triton at room temperature for 10 min and then incubated in PBS containing 100 μg/ml propidium iodide on ice for 30 min. DNA content was analyzed with a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). NIH3T3 transfectants grown on coverslips were rinsed with PBS and fixed in PBS containing 1% paraformaldehyde for 1 h. The fixed cells were washed in PBS, blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, and then incubated for 1 h with the monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (M2) at a concentration of 6 μg/ml. The cells were then reacted with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated second antibody to mouse IgG1, washed, and mounted onto a slide glass in Vectashield Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) before examination by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Clast3 sense (5′-GCAGTCATGTTCGTTCCC-3′) and antisense (5′-GGCACCAGGCAATCAGTA-3′) phosphothioate oligonucleotides were dissolved in sterile water. Exponentially growing NIH3T3 cells (5 × 105cells/well in a 6-well plate) were incubated for 5 h in 500 μl of Opti-MEM containing 2 μl of Lipofectin reagent and 20 μm oligonucleotides, followed by the addition of 500 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% FCS. The cells were then cultured for 36 h before RNA extraction and cell cycle analysis. In searching for genes selectively expressed in activated mouse B cells, we identified a novel gene, which we termed Clast3 (for CD40ligand-activated specifictranscripts). Clast3 transcripts were essentially absent in freshly isolated resting B cells (Fig.1 A, Fresh) but increased rapidly upon treatments with CD40L, antibodies to IgM (αIgM), lipopolysaccharide, or interleukin 4 (Fig. 1 A), all of which are known to drive B cells into the cell cycle (21Wang J. Koizumi T. Watanabe T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This suggests that Clast3 gene expression is closely associated with cell growth. Treatment with CD40L plus αIgM resulted in sustained induction of Clast3 expression (Fig.1 A), consistent with the greater mitogenic activity elicited by the dual stimulation (21Wang J. Koizumi T. Watanabe T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To confirm the growth response property of Clast3, we then examined its expression in an immature B-cell lymphoma cell line, WEHI231, before and after the induction of growth arrest. In contrast to the mature splenic B cells that are activated by αIgM treatment (Fig. 1 A), the immature WEHI231 cells are known to undergo G1 arrest by αIgM, and this G1 arrest can be rescued by simultaneous stimulation with CD40L (22Tsubata T., Wu, J. Honjo T. Nature. 1993; 364: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Treatment of WEHI231 cells with αIgM for 18 h resulted in cell cycle arrest at G1 phase (Fig.1 B, αIgM) and a dramatic decrease of theClast3 transcript levels (Fig. 1 C,αIgM, 18h). Co-stimulation with CD40L prevented the cell cycle arrest (Fig. 1 B,CD40L+αIgM) and the Clast3 down-regulation (Fig. 1 C, CD40L+αIgM, 18h) in WEHI231 cells. These results demonstrate that Clast3mRNA levels are up-regulated in proliferating cells and dramatically down-regulated in cells undergoing growth arrest. The induction ofClast3 expression by various mitogenic stimuli and its down-regulation in growth-arrested cells suggested thatClast3 expression may be controlled in a cell cycle-dependent manner. We therefore examinedClast3 transcript levels in different phases of the cell cycle. We synchronized NIH3T3 cells at G1 phase by serum deprivation and then induced cell cycle progression by serum addition. Cell cycle analysis revealed that the majority of the cells were at G1 phase before serum addition (Fig.2 A, 0 h). Cells were at early and late S phases 12 and 16 h after serum addition, and by 20 h after serum addition, many cells entered into G2-M phase (Fig. 2 A). Similar to G1-arrested WEHI231 cells, Clast3 expression was low in G1-arrested NIH3T3 cells (Fig.2 B, 0 h), increased during S phase, and remained at G2-M phase (Fig. 2 B). These results suggest that Clast3 expression is cell cycle-regulated. The longestClast3 cDNA obtained was 1110 bp (Fig.3 A), which was close to its mRNA size. To determine the 5′ end of Clast3 mRNA, we generated cDNA from tobacco acid pyrophosphatase-treated,i.e. capped, mRNA. We obtained a specific PCR product of ∼400 bp only from tobacco acid pyrophosphatase-treated mRNA (Fig.3 B). Sequence analysis of this PCR product confirmed that the longest cDNA represents the full-length mRNA. TheClast3 cDNA predicts a single open reading frame, encoding a protein of 264 amino acids with a molecular mass of 30 kDa (Fig. 3 A). Extensive homology searches against databases of known genes revealed a partial human Clast3 cDNA sequence lacking the 5′ portion (GenBankTM accession numberAF068295). However, no other homologous genes were found in mammalian and other species. A search for the protein motifs identified two myristoylation sites, two protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, and one N-glycosylation site. A sequence with very weak homology to a motif found in the XPG protein and yeast RAD superfamily was also detected (data not shown). Whereas we could not find any apparent nuclear localization signal in the predicted Clast3 amino acid sequence, immunofluorescence staining of NIH3T3 fibroblasts transfected with a Clast3 expression vector indicated that Clast3 localized to the nuclei, forming discrete dot-like foci (Fig. 3 C). The elevated Clast3 expression during S phase and metaphase implicated a potential role for Clast3 in cell division. To elucidate the function of Clast3, we stably transfected NIH3T3 cells with aClast3 expression construct. We isolated eight Clast3 stable clones as well as three vector controls. Northern blot analysis of representative transfectants revealed high levels of the exogenous 1.2-kb Clast3 mRNA in all three Clast3 clones, whereas only endogenous 1.1-kb Clast3 mRNA was detected in the two vector controls (Fig. 4 A). Western blot analysis confirmed the protein expression of the introduced Clast3 gene (Fig. 4 B). BecauseClast3 transcript levels increased upon cell growth, we anticipated an increased growth rate in Clast3 transfectants. Unexpectedly, cells overexpressing Clast3 exhibited a reduced growth rate compared with vector controls (Fig. 4 C). We then examined the cell cycle distributions of these transfectants. In the Clast3 transfectants, we observed a small population with 8n DNA content, as well as an increase of the cells with a 4n DNA (Fig.5 A, untreated). Because cells with a 4n DNA content at G1 phase would be indistinguishable from cells with a 2n DNA content undergoing mitosis, we then treated cells with the microtube-depolymerizing agent nocodazole to induce cell cycle arrest at M phase. Cell cycle analyses of treated cells revealed an increased percentage of cells with an 8n DNA content in all three Clast3 stable clones as compared with the two vector controls (Fig. 5 A, Nocodazole). A similar result was obtained when these cells were treated with the microtube-stabilizing agent Taxol, which also arrests cells at M phase (Fig. 5 A, Taxol). We further analyzed the DNA content of five additional Clast3 clones and one vector control, which confirmed the significant increases in the polyploid cells in the Clast3 transfectants before and after the nocodazole or Taxol treatment (Table I).Table IPolyploid cells (DNA content >4N) in vector and Clast3 transfectantsTreatmentVector (n = 3)Clast3 (n = 8)Untreated0.7 ± 0.25.0 ± 1.6ap < 0.05 compared with vector controls.Nocodazole7.7 ± 1.017.3 ± 3.3ap < 0.05 compared with vector controls.Taxol5.1 ± 0.118.1 ± 3.1bp < 0.01 compared with vector controls.Three vector and eight Clast3 transfectants were treated with 50 ng/ml nocodazole or 5 μm Taxol for 24 h.

Open table in a new tab Three vector and eight Clast3 transfectants were treated with 50 ng/ml nocodazole or 5 μm Taxol for 24 h. DNA content was analyzed as described under “Materials and Methods.” Data represent means ± S.D. Clast3 stable clone 1 and vector control 1 were then treated with nocodazole or Taxol, and the DNA content was analyzed over the course of 48 h. A small population with an 8n DNA content could be recognized in Clast3 transfectants at 16 h and became more evident at 24 h (Fig. 5 B). At 48 h, there was a significantly higher percentage of 8n cells in Clast3#1 than in Vector#1 in both nocodazole- and Taxol-treated cells. Moreover, an apparent accumulation of 16n cells was observed in Clast3 transfectants, but not in the vector control. A similar increase of polyploid cells was observed in Clast3 stable clones 2 and 18. These results demonstrate that cells overexpressing Clast3 rapidly accumulated polyploid cells. We also examined the effect of Clast3 overexpression on polyploidy induction in 293T cells by co-transfecting an enhanced green fluorescent protein vector (pEGFP-C1) with either a Clast3or control construct. Using enhanced green fluorescent protein as an indicator for transfected cells, we found a higher incidence of 8n cells in Clast3-transfected cells (15.5%) than in vector-transfected cells (3.8%), indicating that Clast3 overexpression can also induce polyploidy in 293T cells. Immunofluorescence staining of Clast3 stable clones revealed elevated frequency of binucleated and multinucleated cells (Fig. 6 A). The average percentages (± S.D.) of multinucleated cells in Clast3 clones 1 and 18 were 6.1 ± 0.5% and 4.1 ± 0.35%, respectively, which were significantly higher than those found in the two vector controls (0.79 ± 0.27% and 0.74 ± 0.66%) or in parental NIH3T3 cells (0.38 ± 0.33%) (Fig. 6 B). Clast3 overexpression thus led to multinucleation as well as polyploidy. To explore the potential mechanism of multinuclei formation induced by Clast3, we treated Clast3 clones and vector controls with the microtube-depolymerizing agent nocodazole. We reasoned that if Clast3 overexpression interferes with the spindle damage checkpoint, then nocodazole treatment would be expected to greatly enhance Clast3-mediated multinucleation. On the other hand, if Clast3 is not related to the spindle checkpoint, then nocodazole treatment should not affect the multinuclei formation induced by Clast3 overexpression. Treatment of Clast3 transfectants with nocodazole resulted in a dramatically high incidence of multinucleated cells (72.5 ± 3.5% and 61.3 ± 2.9%) (Fig. 6 C). In contrast, treatment of the control transfectants or parental NIH3T3 cells with nocodazole only increased the multinucleated cells to ∼20–24%, perhaps reflecting an effect inherent to nocodazole. These results strongly suggest that Clast3 interferes with the same checkpoint activated by nocodazole. The elevated Clast3 expression in cycling cells implicated a potential role for Clast3 in cell division, therefore we examined whether Clast3 is normally essential for cell cycle progression. For this purpose, we sought to transiently reduce the expression of Clast3 by the use of antisense oligonucleotides. Transfection of NIH3T3 cells with Clast3 antisense oligonucleotides resulted in slightly decreased levels of endogenousClast3 transcripts as revealed by Northern blot analysis, which was in agreement with the approximately 20% transfection efficiency estimated by pEGFP-C1 vector (data not shown). DNA content analysis of cells transfected with Clast3 antisense oligonucleotides revealed a significant decrease of G2-M cells and a concomitant increase of the sub-G1 population in two independent experiments (Fig. 7,Antisense). These effects were not observed whenClast3 sense oligonucleotides were similarly transfected (Fig. 7, Sense). The sub-G1 population typically represents cells undergoing apoptosis. Clast3 thus appears to be essential for normal cell division, and its decreased expression may cause apoptosis of the dividing cells. In the present study, we have identified a novel protein, Clast3, whose expression is elevated in cycling cells and down-regulated in growth-arrested cells. Clast3 overexpression induces growth retardation, polyploidy, and multinucleation, whereas its down-regulation by antisense oligonucleotides appears to cause a decrease in G2-M cells and an increase in apoptotic cells. These results collectively implicate a critical role for Clast3 in cell division. Several lines of evidence presented here indicate thatClast3 transcript levels are controlled in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Clast3 expression is barely detectable in nonproliferating primary splenic B lymphocytes but is rapidly up-regulated by a variety of stimuli that induce B-cell proliferation. Conversely, Clast3 transcripts in WEHI231 B lymphoma cells diminish as they undergo G1 arrest. In addition, Clast3 expression is low in growth-arrested NIH3T3 cells and elevated upon cell cycle entry. Therefore, Clast3expression is associated with cell proliferation in normal B lymphocytes, B lymphoma cells, and fibroblasts, suggesting a potential role for Clast3 in cell cycle progression. Consistent with this possibility, treatment of NIH3T3 cells with Clast3 antisense oligonucleotides resulted in a decrease of cells at the G2-M phase and an increase of apoptotic sub-G1cells. It remains to be elucidated how decreased Clast3 expression might affect normal mitosis. Whereas Clast3 appears to play a role in cell division, its overexpression did not enhance cell growth but rather caused growth retardation. The vector we used to express Clast3 was pCXN2, which harbors the chicken β-actin promoter, the cytomegalovirus enhancer, and the SV40 origin. Our recent study revealed that pCXN2 drives high levels of gene expression in all phases of the cell cycle, even in cells deprived of serum for 48 h (23Seimiya M. Bahar R. Wang Y. Kawamura K. Tada Y. Okada S. Hatano M. Tokuhisa T. Saisho H. Watanabe T. Tagawa M. O-Wang J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The negative effects on cell growth by Clast3 overexpression suggest that Clast3transcript levels must be precisely regulated for its normal function and that its constitutive overexpression can lead to abnormal cell division. The growth retardation observed in Clast3 transfectants is likely caused by the abnormal mitosis that generates polyploidy and multinucleated cells, rather than a direct growth-inhibitory effect of Clast3. Although we could not detect any potential nuclear localization signal in the predicted Clast3 protein, immunofluorescence staining indicates that Clast3 is localized to the nuclear foci. In addition, preliminary analysis suggests that Clast3 is associated with condensed chromosomes during mitosis. Clast3 may be transported to and localized in the nuclei through interactions with other proteins. It is possible that Clast3 may bind to chromosomes including the centromere region and thus interfere with the functions of kinetochores that are known to play critical roles in spindle microtube binding and mitotic checkpoint response. The dramatic increase of the multinucleated cells in Clast3 transfectants treated with the spindle-damaging agent is consistent with a role for Clast3 in spindle checkpoint response. A detailed biochemical analysis is in progress to determine the precise intracellular localization of Clast3, including its potential co-localization with the kinetochore-associated proteins. A wide variety of gene products have been shown to interfere with the mitotic spindle checkpoint. Thus, overexpression of the serine/theronine kinase Sak-a, the nuclear matrix protein HET/SAF-B, the Csk homologous kinase Chk, SV40 large T antigen, or human immunodeficiency virus Vpr can lead to multinucleated cells. Whereas multinucleation induced by these gene products is frequently accompanied by growth retardation and polyploidy, T antigen-induced multinucleation is not associated with growth inhibition, and Sak-a overexpression does not seem to induce polyploidy. These observations suggest that growth retardation, multinucleation, and polyploidy can be caused by different mechanisms. The induction of all these phenotypes by Clast3 overexpression suggests that Clast3 may interfere with multiple events during cell division. Among the various cellular and viral gene products that are known to induce abnormal mitosis, Clast3 is most similar to Chk and Vpr in that they all induce multinucleation and polyploidy accompanied by growth retardation. Vpr, an accessory molecule of human immunodeficiency virus, is localized in the perinuclear region and appears to induce multinucleation by impairing the cytoskeletal proteins (20Shimura M. Tanaka Y. Nakamura S. Minemoto Y. Yamashita K. Hatake K. Takaku F. Ishizaka Y. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 621-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Chk is localized in both nuclei and cytoplasm and has been suggested to induce multinucleation through phosphorylation and thus inhibition of the tyrosine kinase activity of Lyn, which appears to be associated with chromosomes (13Yamaguchi N. Nakayama Y. Urakami T. Suzuki S. Nakamura T. Suda T. Oku N. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1631-1641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to Clast3, whose expression is up-regulated upon cell growth, Chk expression is not correlated with cell proliferation (24Grgurevich S. Linnekin D. Musso T. Zhang X. Modi W. Varesio L. Ruscetti F.W. Ortaldo J.R. McVicar D.W. Growth Factors. 1997; 14: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Moreover, Chk-deficient cells grow normally (25Samokhvalov I. Hendrikx J. Visser J. Belyavsky A. Sotiropolous D. Gu H. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1997; 43: 115-122PubMed Google Scholar), whereas Clast3 seems to be required for normal cell cycle progression. These observations suggest that although similar phenotypes are induced by the overexpression of these three divergent proteins, the underlying mechanisms are likely to be different. Clast3 may possess a unique function that is distinct from that of other proteins involved in mitosis and the mitotic spindle checkpoint. Except for a truncated human Clast3 sequence in the data bases, we were unable to find homologous genes in other eukaryotes, including yeast. This is in contrast to many checkpoint proteins, which are conserved among species as distant as human and yeast. Clast3 may have evolved relatively recently and have a more specialized role in mammalian cell division. Accumulating evidence suggests that defects in spindle checkpoint can cause chromosomal instability, which is a common feature of human cancers (1Hartwell L. Cell. 1992; 71: 543-546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 2Lengauer C. Kinzler W.K. Vogelstein B.

Chromosomal instability is implicated in tumorigenesis through the loss of tumor suppressor gene function or the gain of oncogene function. Recently, MAD2 haploinsufficiency has been shown to abrogate the spindle checkpoint and cause chromosomal instability in human colon carcinoma cells (26Michel S.L. Liberal V. Chatterjee A. Kirchwegger R. Pasche B. Gerald W. Dobles M. Sorger K.P. Murty S.V.V.V. Benezra R. Nature. 2001; 409: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Consistently,Mad2 +/− mice were found to develop papillary lung adenocarcinomas at high rates. In addition, mutations in the checkpoint gene BUB1 were identified in a fraction of colorectal cancers and have been shown to impair the spindle checkpoint response (27Cahill P.D. Lengauer C., Yu, J. Riggins J.G. Willson K.V.J. Markowitz D.S. Kinzler W.K. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1998; 392: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). Moreover, the gene encoding securin Pds1 was identified as the “pituitary tumor-transforming gene” and seems to be overexpressed in several tumor types (28Heaney A.P. Singson R. McCabe C.J. Nelson V. Nakashima M. Melmed S. Lancet. 2000; 355: 716-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 29Dominguez A. Ramos-Morales F. Romero F. Rios R.M. Dreyfus F. Tortolero M.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5473-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that defective spindle checkpoint is closely associated with tumorigenesis. It would be interesting to investigate whether Clast3 is overexpressed in human cancers. In conclusion, we have identified a novel cell cycle-regulated protein, Clast3, which appears to play a critical role in cell division. Our results suggest that the precise regulation of Clast3 expression is important for its normal function and that its constitutive overexpression results in polyploidy and multinucleation accompanied by growth inhibition. Elucidation of the exact role of Clast3 in cell division should provide important insights into the regulatory mechanisms of mitosis and the spindle checkpoint, the defects of which are linked to chromosomal instability and cancer development.

NtFHA1 functions as a transactivator and is targeted to the nucleus. The sequence of the FHA domain of NtFHA1 is significantly homologous to that of the Fhl1 forkhead transcription factor of yeast. FHL1 was previously identified as a suppressor of RNA polymerase III mutations, and thefhl1 deletion mutant exhibited severe growth defects and impaired rRNA processing. Ectopic expression of the FHA domain of NtFHA1 (but not its mutant form) resulted in severe growth retardation in yeast. Similarly, expression of Fhl1, its FHA domain, or chimeric Fhl1 containing the NtFHA1 FHA domain also inhibited yeast growth. Yeast cells overexpressing the FHA domains of NtFHA1 and Fhl1 contained lower levels of mature rRNAs and exhibited rRNA-processing defects, similar to the fhl1 null mutant. Chimeric Fhl1 (but not the mutant form with a small deletion in its FHA domain) fully complemented the growth and rRNA-processing defects of the fhl1 null mutant, demonstrating that the FHA domain of NtFHA1 can functionally substitute for the FHA domain of Fhl1. These results demonstrate that the FHA domains of NtFHA1 and Fhl1 are conserved in their structure and function and that the FHA domain of Fhl1 is critically involved in regulation of rRNA processing in yeast.

NtFHA1 function in plants may be analogous to Fhl1 function in yeast. forkhead-associated Arabidopsis kinase-associated protein phosphatase green fluorescent protein red fluorescent protein nuclear localization signal Eukaryotic transcription factors have been divided into many classes depending on their characteristic DNA-binding domains. The forkhead domain is a highly conserved 110- amino acid DNA-binding region found in a class of transcription factors (1Durocher D. Henckel J. Fersht A.R. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 387-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). This domain was named after the Drosophila forkhead protein that is required for the proper formation of the terminal structure of theDrosophila embryos (2Weigel D. Jurgens G. Kuttner F. Seifert E. Jackle H. Cell. 1989; 57: 645-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, several forkhead transcription factors (Fhl1, Hcm1, Fkh1, and Fkh2) have been identified (3Hermann-Le Denmat S. Werner M. Sentenac A. Thuriaux P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2905-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 4Zhu G. Muller E.G. Amacher S.L. Northrop J.L. Davis T.N. Mol. Cell.

Fhl1 has been implicated in RNA polymerase III function, the mutation of which leads to aberrant rRNA processing (3Hermann-Le Denmat S. Werner M. Sentenac A. Thuriaux P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2905-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), whereas the Fkh1 and Fkh2 proteins, which share homology with each other in their forkhead domain and N-terminal region, regulate the cell cycle and pseudohyphal growth (5Zhu G. Spellman P.T. Volpe T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Davis T.N. Futcher B. Nature. 2000; 406: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar, 6Hollenhorst P.C. Bose M.E. Mielke M.R. Muller U. Fox C.A. Genetics. 2000; 154: 1533-1548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the forkhead DNA-binding domain, some forkhead transcription factors also possess a forkhead-associated (FHA)1 domain. FHA domains are highly diverse protein-protein interaction modules characterized by a 55–75-residue motif with only 7 residues that are >65% conserved among 120 family members (7Hofmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 347-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Not being restricted to a group of forkhead transcription factors, the FHA domain has been found in a wide variety of proteins from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (8Li J. Lee G.-I. Van Doren S.R. Walker J.C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4143-4149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rad53, a protein kinase involved in DNA damage response and cell cycle arrest inSaccharomyces cerevisiae, contains two FHA domains separated by a central Ser/Thr kinase domain (9Zheng P. Fay D.S. Burton J. Xiao H. Pinkham J.L. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5829-5842Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Yeast Yhr5 and FraH ofAnabaena sp. contain zinc finger motifs beside the FHA domain (7Hofmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 347-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Another group of the FHA domain-containing proteins are protein kinases such as Dun1, Spk1, and Mek1 of yeast, all of which have been reported to act in the nucleus and to respond to signals related to DNA replication and repair (10Moras D. Nature. 1993; 364: 572-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In plants, the FHA domain was identified in Arabidopsis kinase-associated protein phosphatase (KAPP) through interaction cloning using anArabidopsis receptor-like kinase as bait (11Stone J.M. Collinge M.A Smith R.D. Horn M.A. Walker J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 793-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Further study of the interaction between the KAPP and receptor-like kinase (RLK) proteins provided the evidence for involvement of FHA domains in phosphorylation-dependent protein-protein interactions (12Li J. Smith G.P. Walker J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7821-7826Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). KAPP is involved in plant RLK signaling pathways on the inner face of the plasma membrane, unlike other FHA domain-containing proteins that are localized in the nucleus. The tertiary structure of the FHA domain has been solved in FHA2 (13Liao H. Yuan C., Su, M.-I. Yongkiettrakul S. Qin D., Li, H. Byeon I.-J. L Pei D. Tsai M.-D. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 941-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and FHA1 (14Durocher D. Taylor I.A. Sarbassova D. Haire L.F. Westcott S.L. Jackson S.P. Smerdon S.J. Yaffe M.B. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1169-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) of Rad53. Although the primary sequences of these two FHA domains are divergent, their tertiary structures are remarkably similar. The tertiary structure consists of a β-sandwich containing two twisted antiparallel β-sheets and a short α-helix at the C terminus. In this study, we report a novel FHA domain-containing transcription activator in plants, designated NtFHA1. The FHA domains of NtFHA1 and the yeast Fhl1 forkhead transcription factor have conserved functions in regulation of cell growth and rRNA processing in yeast. Furthermore, the NtFHA1 FHA domain is fully functional within Fhl1 to rescue the phenotypes of slow growth and defective rRNA processing in the yeast fhl1 null mutant. These results indicate that NtFHA1 in plant cells may perform a function analogous to that of Fhl1 in yeast, probably by associating with other transcription factors. This is the first functional analysis of the FHA domain-containing transcription factors in plants. FHA domain constructs and site-directed FHA mutants were generated by PCR and recombinant PCR (15Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, New York1990: 177-183Google Scholar) using synthetic oligonucleotides, and the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. cFhl1Δ33 was generated by digestion of the cFhl1 construct (Fhl1 with its FHA domain replaced with the NtFHA1 FHA domain) with SspBI and BssHII and subsequent self-ligation. This leads to internal deletion of 33 amino acids that include 4 conserved residues of the FHA domain without causing reading frame shift. Experiments were carried out in the EGY48 (MATα, his3, trp1,ura3, LexAop-LEU2) and W303-1A (MAT a, ade2-1, can1-100,his3-11,15, leu2-3, trp1-1,ura3-1) genetic backgrounds as indicated. For complementation assay, the FHL1 gene was deleted in a haploid with the W303 background (MAT a,ade2-1, ura3-52, trp1-1,lys2-801, his3-11,15). Start cultures for galactose-inducible experiments were grown on selective medium containing 2% glucose. For induction of protein expression, cells were grown in selective medium containing 2% glucose or 4% galactose and 2% sucrose. For growth rate studies, aliquots were removed from the growing cultures, and absorbances were measured at 600 nm. In synchronization experiments, cells were diluted to 0.2 Aunits and treated twice for 2 h with 20 μg/ml α-factor. Cells were released from α-factor arrest by three washes with selective medium containing 2% sucrose and 4% galactose and resuspended in fresh medium. Cultured cells were achieved by a 24-h subculture of stationary phase cells (7 days old) in medium containing aphidicolin (5 mg/liter; Sigma), followed by extensive washes as described (16Reichheld J.-P. Chaubet N. Shen W.H. Renaudin J.-P. Gigot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13819-13824Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Mitotic index was measured as described (16Reichheld J.-P. Chaubet N. Shen W.H. Renaudin J.-P. Gigot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13819-13824Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was carried out with 50 μg of total RNA for each lane as described under “DNA and RNA Gel Blot Analyses.” For cell cycle analyses, 1-ml aliquots were removed from yeast cultures and fixed in 70% ethanol. 300 μl of cells (2–3 × 106 cells) were washed with 50 mm sodium citrate (pH 7) and incubated for 3 h with 0.1 mg/ml RNase A in 50 mm sodium citrate at 37 °C. Cells were treated with 4 μg/ml propidium iodide, sonicated, and analyzed using a BD Biosciences FACScan and CellQuest software. For effector constructs, various NtFHA1 cDNA fragments were cloned into pLexA (CLONTECH) using EcoRI andXhoI sites, generating in-frame fusions of the LexA DNA-binding domain and the full-length or truncated open reading frames of NtFHA1. As a control, the DNA fragment containing the B42 activation domain was PCR-amplified from the pB42AD plasmid (CLONTECH) and cloned into pLexA usingEcoRI and XhoI sites. To measure the transcription activation, the effector constructs were transformed into the EGY48 (p8op-LacZ) strain, and the transformants were tested for growth in Leu−and for β-galactosidase activity. Three separate colonies were assayed for each construct, and β-galactosidase activity was determined as A 420 nm/h. TheNtFHA1 cDNA corresponding to amino acid residues 1–209 was PCR-amplified and cloned into the 326-GFP vector (17Lee Y.J. Kim D.H. Kim Y.-W. Hwang I. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2175-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) using a BamHI site to generate an NtFHA1-GFP in-frame fusion under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter. As a control for nuclear localization, the pNLS-RFP construct encoding a red fluorescent protein with a nuclear localization signal (17Lee Y.J. Kim D.H. Kim Y.-W. Hwang I. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2175-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) under the control of 35 S promoter was also prepared. The pNtFHA1-GFP and pNLS-RFP plasmids were introduced into Arabidopsisprotoplasts by polyethylene glycol treatment as described (17Lee Y.J. Kim D.H. Kim Y.-W. Hwang I. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2175-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Expression of the fusion constructs was monitored at various times after transformation by fluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope, and the image was captured with a cooled charge-coupled device camera. The filter sets (Omega Optical Inc., Brattleboro, VT) were XF116 (exciter, 474AF20; dichroic, 500DRLP; and emitter, 510AF23) for GFP and XF33/E (exciter, 535DF35; dichroic, 570DRLP; and emitter, 605DF50) for RFP. The data were processed using Adobe Photoshop software and presented in pseudocolor format. For DNA gel blot analysis, the genomic DNA isolated from tobacco leaves was digested withEcoRI and HindIII, electrophoresed on a 0.8% agarose gel, and blotted onto Hybond-N nylon membrane (AmershamBiosciences). The probe was the 0.4-kb PCR fragment corresponding to the C-terminal region of NtFHA1. Prehybridization and hybridization were carried out in 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, and 0.5% SDS at 60 °C overnight. The membranes were washed twice with 2× SSC and 1% SDS at room temperature and then washed with 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 60 °C for 30 min. For RNA gel blot analysis using plant tissues, total RNA was prepared using TRIzolTM reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. ∼50 μg of total RNA were electrophoresed on an agarose gel containing 5.1% (v/v) formaldehyde and blotted onto Hybond-N nylon membrane. Prehybridization, hybridization, and washing conditions were as described for DNA gel blot analysis. To extract total RNA from yeast, yeast cells were grown to 0.8 A units; pelleted; and resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm NaOAc (pH 5.3), 10 mm EDTA, and 0.1% diethyl pyrocarbonate. Then 0.1 volume of 10% SDS was added to the suspension and vortexed. After addition of an equal volume of phenol and vortexing, the whole mixture was kept at 65 °C for 4 min, rapidly chilled on ice, and centrifuged to collect the supernatant. The supernatant was extracted twice with phenol/chloroform and ethanol-precipitated to obtain total RNA. To detect pre-rRNAs in yeast, hybridization was performed using 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide probes ITS1-1 (5′-GAAACGGTTTTAATTGTCCTATAAC-3′), ITS1-2 (5′-TGTTACCTCTGGGCCC-3′), and ITS2 (5′-GGCCAGCAATTTCAAGTTA-3′), which correspond to internal transcribed spacers, at 41 °C for 2 h and washed with 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 41 °C for 1 h. Membranes were analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). 20 μg of total RNA isolated from plant tissues were treated with 1 unit of RNase-free DNase (Promega) and 1 unit of RNase inhibitor (Promega) for 15 min at 30 °C and then purified by phenol/chloroform extraction. The first-strand cDNA was synthesized using 5 μg of DNase-treated RNA primed by oligo(dT) (50 μm) using 200 units of Superscript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), 20 units of RNase inhibitor, 500 μm each dNTP, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. 0.1, 0.01, and 0.005 volume of 0.05 volume of the reaction mixture were used for PCR amplification with 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega), 100 μm each dNTP, and 100 pmol each of the forward and reverse primers. Protein extracts were prepared by resuspending yeast cells in 10% trichloroacetic acid and vigorous vortexing in the presence of glass beads. Crude extract was pelleted, washed with 1 ml of cold acetone, and pelleted again. After resuspending the pellet in SDS sample buffer, 0.1 volume of 10m NaOH was added. The supernatant was obtained by centrifugation and boiled for 10 min. Proteins were electrophoresed, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed with the monoclonal antibody against the LexA DNA-binding domain (1:10,000 dilution; CLONTECH). They were then reacted with secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and ECL reagent (Amersham Bioscience) for detection. A cDNA encoding a protein of 209 amino acids with structural features of a transcription factor was identified in Nicotiana tabacum (cv. xanthi). The cDNA is 819 bp in length, and its predicted molecular mass is 22,601 Da. Based on the predicted sequence, the protein contains ∼59 amino acids (residues 30–88) that show conserved structural features of the FHA domain in the N terminus and the acidic region (residues 153–185) as a putative transactivation domain in the C terminus, but lacks any known DNA-binding motifs (Fig.1 A). The cDNA clone was designated NtFHA1. We searched the Arabidopsis data base for homologs ofNtFHA1 and found two genomic sequences encoding highly homologous proteins (GenBankTM/EBI accession numbersAAF20220.1 and AAF20224.1). The corresponding cDNAs were isolated from the Arabidopsis cDNA library by PCR and designatedAtFHA1 and AtFHA2. AtFHA1 andAtFHA2 encode proteins of 253 and 320 amino acids, respectively. The expected molecular masses of AtFHA1 and AtFHA2 are 27,980 and 35,994 Da, respectively. Like NtFHA1, they contain the FHA domain in the N terminus and the acidic domain in the C terminus and lack any DNA-binding domain. The amino acid sequence of NtFHA1 and comparison of the sequence with those of AtFHA1 and AtFHA2 are shown in Fig. 1 B. The FHA domain of NtFHA1 exhibits 91–94% sequence identity to those of AtFHA1 and AtFHA2, but the sequences outside the FHA domain are not conserved. The FHA domain of NtFHA1 also shows significant sequence similarity to the FHA domain of Fhl1, a forkhead transcription factor in yeast. Schematic diagrams of yeast Fhl1 and NtFHA1 and alignment of the FHA domains of the two proteins are shown in Fig. 1 (C andD, respectively). Yeast Fhl1, consisting of 936 amino acids, contains two large acidic domains at the N and C termini and the FHA domain and a DNA-binding forkhead domain in the center. The amino acid sequence of the FHA domain of NtFHA1 shows 46% identity to that of Fhl1. We tested whether NtFHA1 has the ability for transcription activation using the yeast system. Various effector constructs were transformed into the yeast strain that contains two reporter genes (LEU2 andLacZ) under the control of multiple LexA operators (Fig.2 A). As effectors, fusion proteins between the LexA DNA-binding domain and full-length NtFHA1 or its deletion mutants were expressed under the control ofADH1 promoters. Transcription activation was monitored by β-galactosidase activity and yeast growth in medium lacking leucine. The LexA DNA-binding domain alone, used as a negative control, did not exhibit any transactivation activity, whereas the positive control LexA-B42, a fusion protein between the LexA DNA-binding domain and the B42 activation domain, showed strong β-galactosidase activity and growth in Leu−. Full-length NtFHA1 was able to transactivate expression of the reporter genes, whereas NtFHA1 deletion mutants such as LexA-Δ1, LexA-Δ2, and LexA-Δ3 did not show any detectable transactivation activity. These results demonstrate that NtFHA1 is functional as a transcription activator. Cellular localization of NtFHA1 was examined by constructing the NtFHA1-GFP fusion protein, the expression of which is controlled by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter. As a positive control for nuclear targeting, RFP fused with a nuclear localization signal (NLS) (17Lee Y.J. Kim D.H. Kim Y.-W. Hwang I. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2175-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) was expressed under the control of the same promoter. DNA constructs encoding NtFHA1-GFP and NLS-RFP were simultaneously introduced into protoplasts isolated from Arabidopsis seedlings. After incubation at 25 °C, expression of the introduced genes was examined under a fluorescent microscope with two different filters to capture the image of GFP and RFP. After a 24-h incubation, the green fluorescent signal completely overlapped with the red fluorescent signal in the nucleus, exhibiting colocalization of NtFHA1-GFP and NLS-RFP in the nucleus. This result demonstrates that NtFHA1 is targeted to the nucleus (Fig. 2 B). DNA gel blot analysis was performed with tobacco genomic DNA digested with restriction enzymes (Fig.3 A). The probe was the 0.4-kb PCR fragment corresponding to the C-terminal region of theNtFHA1 cDNA. EcoRI digestion resulted in three hybridizing bands, whereas HindIII digestion showed four hybridizing bands. Considering that N. tabacum is amphidiploid between Nicotiana tomentosiformis andNicotiana sylvestris, these results indicate that the tobacco genome contains two copies of the NtFHA1-related sequences (Fig. 3 A). We examined expression of theNtFHA1 mRNA in plant tissues at different developmental stages using RNA gel blot analysis and semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR. In tobacco, the 1.0-kb NtFHA1 transcript was detected in all of the tissues examined, with the highest level found in open flowers (Fig. 3 B). During seed germination, the NtFHA1 mRNA was detected at 2 days of incubation in MS (Murashige and Skoog) medium after 3 days of cold treatment, and the level decreased at 3–5 days of incubation and then increased at 7–9 days of incubation (Fig. 3 C). During pollination, the NtFHA1 mRNA was detected in unpollinated ovaries just before anthesis at the level that was maintained until 3 days after pollination, and the mRNA level decreased from 5 days after pollination to a barely detectable level at 7 days after pollination (Fig. 3 D). The NtFHA1mRNA level fluctuated during the cell cycle in tobacco BY2 cells (Fig. 3 E). Suspension-cultured tobacco BY2 cells were synchronized by a 24-h treatment with aphidicolin, an inhibitor of DNA polymerases. After release from the aphidicolin block, mitotic index and the NtFHA1 mRNA levels were monitored during the cell cycle. As controls, the histone H4 gene and the cyclin B1 gene were used as markers of S phase and M phase, respectively. The level ofNtFHA1 mRNA was maintained at a similar level through S phase and G2 phase until mid-M phase, and then the transcript level decreased to a very low level during G1phase. To obtain clues to the function of the FHA domain of NtFHA1, we overexpressed the domain using a galactose-inducible system in yeast. The DNA construct containing the NtFHA1 FHA domain fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain for nuclear targeting or the construct containing the LexA DNA-binding domain alone as a vector control was transformed into yeast (Fig.4 A). Additionally, the FHA domain constructs with alanine substitutions of the highly conserved residues of the FHA domain (Mut34 and Mut55) were also overexpressed (Fig. 4 A). The transformed yeast strains carrying the FHA domain or the vector showed normal growth in medium containing 2% glucose that repressed expression of the constructs. However, in medium containing 4% galactose, the strain overexpressing the FHA domain exhibited considerably slower growth kinetics than the vector control (Fig. 4 B). Overexpression of the FHA domain did not affect cell viability because colony formation per A unit was very similar for FHA domain and vector control cultures when plated on glucose medium (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4 B, this growth defect phenotype was dependent on the integrity of the FHA domain, as it was abrogated by alanine substitution of the highly conserved residues Arg-34 and Ser-55 (Fig. 4 B). The abrogation of the growth defect indicates that these residues may be directly involved in the binding of a target protein that is crucial for the growth defect phenotype in yeast. The corresponding proteins for the FHA domain, Mut34, and Mut55 constructs were expressed at similar levels, as shown by immunoblot analysis using the anti-LexA antibody (Fig. 4 C). To examine whether the NtFHA1 FHA domain reduces cell growth in a specific phase of the cell cycle, aliquots of liquid cultures were analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 5). Aliquots were removed from growing cultures expressing the vector control or the NtFHA1 FHA domain before and 6 and 12 h after addition of galactose. Before and 6 h after addition of galactose, when the growth defect was not apparent, both cultures showed essentially identical cell cycle profiles; the majority of cells had a 2n DNA content (corresponding to G2/M). However, induction of the NtFHA1 FHA domains for 12 h resulted in an increase in cells with a 1n DNA content. To determine whether the accumulation of cells in G1 phase was the result of cell cycle arrest or slower G1-S transition, FHA domain-overexpressing and vector control cultures were synchronized in G1 using α-factor and then released into fresh galactose medium. The majority of control cultures shifted to G2/M within 120 min after α-factor release. However, yeast cells overexpressing the NtFHA1 FHA domain exhibited slower transition from G1 to S phase after release from α-factor compared with the control cells. Thus, slow progression in the cell cycle is the reason for the growth retardation phenotype of the FHA domain-expressing yeast cultures. This result indicates that the FHA domain of NtFHA1 interacts with cellular components of yeast that influence progression of cell cycle. The high sequence similarity between FHA domains of NtFHA1 and yeast Fhl1 indicates a possibility that the FHA domain of NtFHA1 may be able to interact with components involved in Fhl1 function in yeast cells. Supporting this possibility, overexpression of the constructs encoding either full-length Fhl1 or the FHA domain of Fhl1, both fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain, resulted in severe growth inhibition in yeast in 4% galactose (Fig. 6 A). We tested whether simultaneous expression of Fhl1 with the FHA domain of NtFHA1 further amplifies the growth defect. In 1% galactose, growth of yeast strains expressing either Fhl1 or the NtFHA1 FHA domain was partially restored, but the growth of the strain expressing both constructs was restored to much lower levels (Fig. 6 A). Thus, the FHA domain of the yeast Fhl1 transcription factor also influences yeast cell growth when overexpressed. The polypeptides of Fhl1 and the NtFHA1 FHA domain were detected by Western blot analysis using the anti-LexA antibody, and the results show that the Fhl1 protein was expressed at similar levels in strains expressing either FHL1 and the vector or FHL1 and FHA, standardized by the levels of β-tubulin (Fig. 6 B). The FHL1mRNA levels were also similar in these strains, being expressed at a higher level compared with the strain that did not contain FHL (Fig. 6 C). To test whether the FHA domains of NtFHA1 can replace the corresponding domain of Fhl1, the construct for chimeric Fhl1 in which its FHA domain was replaced with the NtFHA1 FHA domain (cFhl1) was introduced into yeast (Fig. 6 D). Overexpression of cFhl1 resulted in growth retardation, similar to Fhl1 expression. Simultaneous expression of chimeric Fhl1 and the NtFHA1 FHA domain additively inhibited yeast growth (Fig. 6 D). We further tested the functional similarity between the FHA domains of NtFHA1 and Fhl1 using a complementation assay (Fig. 7).FHL1 is a nonessential gene in yeast, but its inactivation greatly impairs the growth of the mutant strains (3Hermann-Le Denmat S. Werner M. Sentenac A. Thuriaux P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2905-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thefhl1 deletion mutant was constructed in the haploid W303 by replacing the open reading frame of the FHL1 gene with aHIS3 cassette. The cDNA fragments encoding wild-type Fhl1 and chimeric Fhl1 in which its FHA domain was replaced with the FHA domain of NtFHA1 (cFhl1) were fused with either the GAL1promoter or the native FHL1 promoter on a multicopy plasmid. These recombinant plasmids were introduced into the yeastfhl1Δ mutant, and were examined whether expression of the chimeric Fhl1 protein could rescue the slow growth phenotype of thefhl1Δ mutant. Under the control of the GAL1promoter, neither Fhl1 nor cFhl1 could restore the growth defect of thefhl1Δ mutant when their expression was induced by 2% galactose. This is probably due to the galactose-induced overexpression of the Fhl1 protein, which has been shown to inhibit yeast growth (Fig.6 A). However, expression of cFhl1 by the FHL1promoter fully restored the growth of the mutant to a degree similar to expression of wild-type Fhl1 on a multicopy plasmid (Fig. 7). cFhl1Δ33 (cFhl1 with an internal deletion of 33 amino acids, residues 26–58 (Fig. 1 D), including 4 of 6 conserved residues of the NtFHA1 FHA domain (Fig. 1 D)) could not complement thefhl1Δ mutant phenotype when expressed under control of theFHL1 promoter, demonstrating that the NtFHA1 FHA domain is critical in cFhl1 function for complementing the fhl1Δmutant phenotype. Interestingly, both Fhl1 and cFhl1 could only partially complement the slow growth phenotypes of thefhl1Δ mutant to the same degree on a low copy plasmid, indicating that FHL1 gene expression is regulated by its position in the genome. Taken together, these results further demonstrate that the FH"

Passive transport of an ERK2 monomer through the nuclear pore is also reported to coexist. We attempted to characterize the cytoplasmic retention and nuclear translocation of fusion proteins between deletion and site-directed mutants of ERK2 and green fluorescent protein (GFP). The overexpressed ERK2-GFP fusion protein is usually localized to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus unless a cytoplasmic anchoring protein is coexpressed. Deletion of 45 residues, but not 43 residues, from the C terminus of ERK2 prevented the nuclear distribution of the ERK2-GFP fusion protein. Substitution of a part of residues 299–313 to alanine residues also prevented the nuclear distribution of the ERK2-GFP fusion protein without abrogation of its nuclear active transport. These observations may indicate that the passive diffusion of ERK2 into the nucleus is not simple diffusion but includes a specific interaction process between residues 299–313 and the nuclear pore complex and that this interaction is not required for the active transport. We also showed that substitution of Tyr314 to alanine residue abrogated the cytoplasmic retention of the ERK2-GFP fusion protein by PTP-SL but not by MEK1.

Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Shaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar). Extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), also known as p44/p42 MAPK, are well studied members of this family, and it is known that they preferentially regulate cell growth and differentiation. Upon stimulation, ERKs are activated via a cascade of phosphorylation and activation of the protein kinases Raf-1 and MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK). Activated MEK, which is specific to ERKs, activates ERKs by catalyzing the phosphorylation of ERKs on both a threonine and a tyrosine residue. The activated ERKs can phosphorylate a variety of substrates, including transcription factors that control cellular growth, such as Elk-1. In resting cells, ERKs are primarily localized to the cytoplasm. Upon extracellular stimulation, a fraction of cytoplasmic ERKs translocate into the nucleus (3Chen R.H. Sarnecki C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 915-927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The dissociation of ERK2 from its cytoplasmic anchor is induced by the phosphorylation of ERK2 at Tyr (and Thr) (4Lenormand P.

Because ERK2 does not have a clear nuclear localization signal, it is hypothesized that this dimerization provokes the nuclear localization signal. However, the nuclear translocation mechanism of ERK2 still remains to be clarified. Nuclear-transported ERK2 is dephosphorylated and exported to the cytosol by a Crm1-dependent mechanism that involves MEK1 (8Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Adachiet al. (6Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5347-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that there is another nuclear import system of ERK2 different from the abovementioned active transport and that this transport is driven by passive diffusion of a monomer. Recent studies have shown that several kinds of protein are sufficiently robust to anchor ERK2 protein in the cytoplasm when they are overexpressed. These proteins include MEK1 (9Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), dual specificity MKP3 (a MAPK phosphatase specific for ERK) (10Brunet A. Roux D. Lenormand P. Dowd S. Keyse S.

These interaction partners of ERK2 have been demonstrated to have docking domains recognized by other MAPKs in a similar way. These docking domains are conserved and characterized by the presence of a cluster of basic residues (12Sharrocks A.D. Yang S.-H. Galanis A. Trends Biochem.

For instance, the sequences225LXXRRXXXXXLXL of PTP-SL and 2KKKXXXIXL in the N-terminal region of MEK1 have been shown to be required for their bindings to ERK2. As the counterpart of these positively charged amino acid residues, a motif containing two acidic residues, Asp316and Asp319, for the binding was identified in ERK2, termed the common docking (CD) domain (residues 316–319) (13Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether this motif is requisite for binding to all of the different types of docking domains of ERK2-binding partner. Rubinfeldet al. (19Rubinfeld H. Hanoch T. Seger R. J.

Studies using chimera proteins from ERK2 and p38 MAPK have indicated that the major C-terminal structural lobe is the binding site of ERK2 for MKP3 (20Nichols A. Camps M. Gillieron C. Chabert C.

In the present study, we examined the role of the C-terminal region of ERK2, which contains the CD domain, for its subcellular localization and nuclear translocation. We found that Tyr314 near the CD domain is important for the binding between ERK2 and PTP-SL. Overexpressed ERK2 is usually distributed in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus unless a cytoplasmic anchoring protein is coexpressed. Interestingly, we found that some C-terminal deletion mutants of the ERK2 fusion protein were localized to the cytoplasm even in the absence of exogenously expressed anchoring proteins and identified the relevant sequence. Wild-type mouse ERK2 and its mutants were ligated into the pEGFP-N3 vector (CLONTECH) and into the site downstream of the GFP gene of the pEGFPC vector, which was constructed in our laboratory.

In cotransfection, two kinds of plasmids were introduced at a ratio of 1:1 (w/w) unless otherwise noted. Localization of GFP-fused proteins was visualized using conventional fluorescence microscopy (Nikon ECLIPSE TE300). The results were usually observed in more than 80% of the cells expressed. For detecting the phosphorylation state of ERK2, cells transfected with expression plasmids were stimulated with peroxyvanadate (VOOH; 100 μmNa3VO4, 200 μmH2O2) for 15 min and lysed, and the proteins were solubilized with hot SDS solution containing 1% SDS, 1 mm Na3VO4 (Calbiochem), and 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4. For ERK2-PTP-SL(147–549)C480S coimmunoprecipitation experiments, the cell cultures were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mmNa3VO4) and incubated on ice for 30 min. The lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 rpm, and the ERK2-GFP fusion proteins were immunoprecipitated from the supernatant with anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel beads (Sigma). The beads were washed three times in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Triton X-100, followed by SDS-PAGE. For immunoblotting, the proteins were separated by a 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, and probed with appropriate antibodies. The binding of antibodies was detected using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). To characterize the subcellular localization of ERK2, we constructed a plasmid that expresses mouse ERK2 protein in which the C terminus was fused to GFP, named ERK2-GFP, because the formation of GFP chromophore is directly related to the correct folding of the upstream protein (24Waldo G.S. Standish B.M. Berendzen J. Terwilliger T.C. Nat. Biotech. 1999; 17: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). The plasmid was transfected into CHO cells and was examined to determine whether the subcellular localization of ERK2-GFP is different from that of wild-type ERK2 itself under various conditions. As described before (19Rubinfeld H. Hanoch T. Seger R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30349-30352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), the expression of the ERK2-GFP showed an essentially similar subcellular localization and intracellular movement upon mitogenic stimulation as ERK2 itself (Fig.1 A). The intact ERK2-GFP fusion protein was distributed in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus in the absence of coexpressed MEK1. When MEK1 was coexpressed, ERK2-GFP was excluded from the nucleus. TPA and leptomycin B treatments induced the ERK2-GFP translocation into the nucleus. The same was true for ERK2-(GFP)3. Taken together, all of these characteristics were not apparently distinguishable from those of wild-type ERK2. In quiescent cells endogenous ERK2 predominantly localizes to the cytoplasm by binding to cytoplasmic anchors including MEK. However, overexpressed ERK2 usually localizes to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, because an excess amount of ERK2 over MEK diffuses into the nucleus (6Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5347-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). With this in mind, to investigate whether the C-terminal amino acid sequence of ERK2 is important for its cytoplasmic localization, we constructed C-terminal deletion mutants of the ERK2-GFP fusion protein. These mutants were expressed in CHO cells without coexpressed MEK1 (Fig. 1 B, left column). Up to (1–318)-GFP, which contains residues 1–318 of ERK2, the mutants showed subcellular localization similar to that of (1–358)-GFP (full-length ERK2-GFP). Interestingly, further deletion of 10 amino acid residues from (1–318)-GFP caused the cytoplasmic localization of the mutant, (1–308)-GFP. To eliminate the possibility that the position of GFP may influence the subcellular localization of these mutants, we also constructed plasmids in which GFP was fused to the N terminus of the ERK2 deletion mutants, GFP-(1–338), GFP-(1–328), GFP-(1–318), and GFP-(1–308). When expressed in CHO cells, these GFP-ERK2 deletion mutants displayed similar localization in the cells as a series of ERK2-GFP deletion mutants (Fig.1 B, right column). Thus, the cytoplasmic localization of (1–308)-GFP was independent of the position of GFP. Furthermore, to characterize the mechanism of this cytoplasmic localization, we constructed GFP fusion proteins containing residues 1–313 and residues 1–315 of ERK2. When expressed in CHO cells, whereas (1–313)-GFP was retained in the cytoplasm of ∼80% of the expressed cells, (1–315)-GFP, which contained two additional tyrosine residues, was distributed throughout the cell (Fig. 1 C). Thus, the deletion of two extra tyrosine residues, Tyr314and Tyr315, caused an obvious difference in the subcellular localization of the mutants. Fig. 1 D shows the phosphorylation state of the ERK2-GFP deletion mutants. Immunoblotting analysis indicated no incorporation of phosphates into the regulatory sites of the (1–315)-GFP, (1–313)-GFP, and (1–308)-GFP fusion proteins upon VOOH stimulation. Because the phosphorylation at these regulatory residues is requisite for the dissociation of ERK2 from MEK1 and the active nuclear translocation of ERK2, it was suggested that the nuclear distribution of (1–315)-GFP was not because of phosphorylation-dependent nuclear translocation. In addition, we determined whether the nuclear distribution of (1–315)-GFP was through size-dependent passive diffusion by examining the subcellular localization of (1–315)-(GFP)3, a plasmid expressing ERK2 (1–315) connected to three GFPs in series. The molecular mass of (1–315)-(GFP)3 is ∼115 kDa, which is considered above the diffusion limit of the nuclear pore. In more than half of the cells expressed, (1–315)-(GFP)3 was localized to the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 C). This result suggests that the nuclear distribution of (1–315)-GFP may be at least partly due to size-dependent simple diffusion through the nuclear pore. We next tested whether (1–313)-GFP aggregated as an insoluble form in the cytoplasm. The cells transfected with (1–313)-GFP were treated with 40 μm of phenylarsine oxide, which is known to induce nuclear translocation of ERK1 without its activation (25Meili R. Ballmer-Hofer K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 C, phenylarsine oxide treatment induced (1–313)-GFP to distribute in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, indicating that (1–313)-GFP is diffusible. Taken together, these results indicate that (1–315)-GFP translocates into the nucleus by passive diffusion, but (1–313)-GFP is unable to enter the nucleus by passive diffusion despite its smaller size, suggesting that translocation by diffusion through the nuclear pore requires interaction between the ERK2-GFP fusion protein and the nuclear pore complex. To investigate whether Tyr314and Tyr315 are important for the passive diffusion of the ERK2 fusion protein, we then constructed (1–318)5A-GFP, (1–328)5A-GFP, (1–338)5A-GFP, (1–348)5A-GFP, and (1–358)5A-GFP, in all of which residues 314–318 were mutated to alanine residues (TableI). When these mutants were expressed in CHO cells, there were minimal changes in the subcellular localization (data not shown), suggesting that Tyr314 and Tyr315 are not necessary for the passive diffusion process and that the cytoplasmic localization of (1–313)-GFP was not due to the lack of these two tyrosine residues. Because the mutation of the sequence including Tyr314 and Tyr315 caused no cytoplasmic localization of the fusion proteins, it was considered that deletion of residues 314–358 might influence the conformation of the other region of ERK2. Therefore, based on the ERK2 crystallographic data (26Zhang F. Strand A. Robbins D. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1994; 367: 704-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), we mutated the residues closely surrounding Tyr314 and Tyr315 and examined the cytoplasmic localization of these ERK2-GFP mutants (Fig.2 and Table I). When expressed in CHO cells in the absence of exogenous MEK1, mutants 119A3-GFP, 122A3-GFP, 125A6-GFP, and 296A3-GFP were distributed throughout the cell (Fig.3 A, left column). 119A3-GFP, 122A3-GFP, and 296A3-GFP were retained in the cytoplasm with exogenous MEK1, and phosphorylated at both Thr183 and Tyr185 upon VOOH stimulation, displaying similar characteristics to those of the wild-type ERK2-GFP fusion protein (Fig.3 B). 125A6-GFP lost its capability to be phosphorylated by MEK1. 299A3-GFP, 302A6-GFP, 308A3-GFP, and 311A3-GFP displayed the cytoplasmic localization even in the absence of exogenous MEK1, as in the case of (1–313)-GFP (Fig. 3 A, right column). Of these mutants, 302A6 and 311A3 were induced to translocate into the nucleus by TPA stimulation for 1 h (Fig. 3 A,right column). In accordance with these results, VOOH stimulation phosphorylated 302A6-GFP and 311A3-GFP at both of the regulatory sites (Fig. 3 B). On the other hand, 299A3-GFP and 308A3-GFP were not phosphorylated and also inactive with respect to nuclear translocation by TPA stimulation (Fig. 3 A,right column). The effect of leptomycin B, which has been shown to specifically inhibit nuclear export signal-mediated active nuclear export of proteins including MEK1 (9Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 27Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20024-20028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), was examined on subcellular localization of 299A3-GFP, 302A6-GFP, 308A3-GFP, and 311A3-GFP. After treatment with 8 ng/ml of leptomycin B for 1.5 h, there was minimum change in the distribution of both 299A3-GFP and 308A3-GFP, whereas 302A6-GFP was distributed throughout the cell, indicating a leakage of the mutant probably because of its active transport mechanism. The nuclear distribution of 311A3-GFP after treatment with leptomycin B was observed in a small portion of the cells. These results indicate that the cytoplasmic localization of 299A3-GFP and 308A3-GFP is not due to the enhancement of the nuclear export mechanism or the cytoplasmic retention by endogenous MEK and that 302A6-GFP and 311A3-GFP have the ability to translocate into the nucleus by phosphorylation-dependent active transport. Thus, suppression of the passive diffusion into the nucleus of these overexpressed mutants is not because of increased interaction between MEK and ERK and is independent of the active transport mechanism. It was also indicated that residues 299–313 are required for the passive diffusion of ERK2-GFP into the nucleus.Figure 3Cytoplasmic localization of ERK2-GFP mutants in CHO cells. A, CHO cells were transfected with each of 119A3-GFP, 122A3-GFP, 125A6-GFP, and 296A3-GFP together with or without plasmid expressing MEK1. CHO cells were also transfected with each of 299A3-GFP, 302A6-GFP, 308A3-GFP, and 311A3-GFP, and then the cells were treated with 250 nm TPA for 1 h and 8 ng/ml leptomycin B (LB) for 1.5 h. B, CHO cells were transfected with each of the following constructs: ERK2-GFP (WT), 119A3-GFP, 122A3-GFP, 125A6-GFP, 296A3-GFP, 299A3-GFP, 302A6-GFP, 308A3-GFP, and 311A3-GFP. The cells were serum-starved for 6 h and then were either left untreated (−) or stimulated with VOOH (+). The cell lysates were prepared, separated on an SDS-PAGE, and blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. The membrane was analyzed with anti-dual phosphorylated ERK antibody (Anti-P-ERK) or anti-GFP antibody (Anti-GFP). Each of these experiments was reproduced at least three times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the role of Tyr314 and Tyr315 for the binding capability of ERK2 to anchoring proteins, we also constructed plasmids expressing full-length ERK2-GFP fusion proteins with mutations at these tyrosine residues and their adjacent residues (Table II) and tested whether the exogenous intracellular region (residues 147–549) of PTP-SL and MEK1 would be able to retain these mutants in the cytoplasm. As reported previously (11Zúñiga Á. Torres J. Úbeda J. Pulido R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21900-21907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), coexpressed PTP-SL retained the full-length ERK2-GFP fusion protein as MEK1 does (Fig.4 A). When YYS3A-GFP was expressed in CHO cells without exogenous anchoring proteins, this mutant distributed in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Exogenous PTP-SL did not retain the mutant in the cytoplasm, whereas exogenous MEK1 excluded the mutant from the nucleus. The ERK2-GFP mutant in which residues 313–318 were all mutated to alanine residues showed the same distribution as YYS3A-GFP (data not shown). Furthermore, to clarify the role of the respective amino acid residues, we also examined whether Y314A-GFP, Y315A-GFP, D316A-GFP, S318A-GFP, and D319A-GFP were retained in the cytoplasm by PTP-SL and MEK1. Asp316 and Asp319 have been reported to be important for the interaction between ERK and MEK by binding to positively charged residues in the docking domain (13Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 19Rubinfeld H. Hanoch T. Seger R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30349-30352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The crystallographic data of ERK2 has shown that Ser318 is clustered with Asp316 and Asp319 on the surface of the protein (26Zhang F. Strand A. Robbins D. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1994; 367: 704-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Y315A-GFP, D316A-GFP, and S318A-GFP were retained in the cytoplasm by exogenous PTP-SL, although neither Y314A-GFP nor D319A-GFP was retained. These findings indicate that residues Tyr314and Asp319 were important for the association of ERK2 with PTP-SL and that acidic residue Asp316 is not required for the cytoplasmic retention of ERK2 by PTP-SL. Fig. 4 A also shows that MEK1 coexpression induces cytoplasmic localization of all of these mutants, and these results may indicate that a region in addition to the CD domain contributes to the cytoplasmic retention of ERK2 by MEK1. Immunoprecipitation analysis supported the above-mentioned results (Fig. 4 B). Here, we tested the ability of the ERK2-GFP mutants to coimmunoprecipitate with PTP-SL. FLAG-tagged PTP-SL was coexpressed with each of the ERK-GFP mutants in CHO cells, and the cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody conjugated with agarose beads. Immunoblotting with anti-GFP antibody demonstrated that the full-length ERK2-GFP fusion protein, Y315A-GFP, and S318A-GFP showed strong coimmunoprecipitation with PTP-SL and that D316A-GFP showed a slightly decreased ability to associate with PTP-SL. Almost no association of PTP-SL with YYS3A-GFP, Y314A-GFP, or D319A-GFP was detected by anti-GFP antibody under the present conditions. These results indicate that the mutation of Tyr314 and Asp319 abolished the ability of ERK2 to associate with PTP-SL, resulting in the loss of its cytoplasmic retention. In resting cells, ERK2 is retained in the cytoplasm by anchoring proteins, and phosphorylation of ERK2 upon stimulation induces its homodimerization and promotes its accumulation in the nucleus by active transport mechanism (5Khokhlatchev A.V. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J. Robinson M. Atkinson M. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 7Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 7-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been demonstrated thatXenopus MAPK diffuses into the nucleus as a monomer (6Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5347-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The present study showed that the deletion of 45 residues from the C terminus of ERK2 caused the cytoplasmic localization of the ERK2-GFP fusion protein. This mutant was considered to be unable to diffuse into the nucleus despite its small size, which makes it possible to penetrate the nuclear pore, indicating that passive diffusion into the nucleus may require a sequence recognizable by the nuclear pore complex. In this study, we also identified residues299RIEVEQALAHPYLEQ313 of ERK2 as the sequence necessary for its passive diffusion into the nucleus. This region forms α-helix i (26Zhang F. Strand A. Robbins D. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1994; 367: 704-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) and is located near the CD domain (Fig. 2). This may indicate that the binding of a protein containing a docking domain to ERK2 could restrict the passive diffusion of ERK2, even if the protein complex is small enough to pass through the nuclear pore. Recently, Matsubayashi et al. (28Matsubayashi Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41755-41760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) suggested that the GFP-MAPK fusion protein passes through the nuclear pore by interacting with FG repeat of nucleoporin CAN/Nup214 by an energy-independent mechanism. It has been indicated that FG repeats serve as docking sites for transport receptors and likely interact with hydrophobic pockets running along the outside of the karyopherin (29Radu A. Moore M.S. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 81: 215-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 30Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16593-16596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Although the sequence we identified in this study appears not to form an obvious hydrophobic patch, the sequence may be involved in this process. In the mutants of which the diffusion into the nucleus is restricted, there were two types of cytoplasmic localization. One is the type where the mutants cannot be phosphorylated or translocated into the nucleus upon mitogenic stimulation. These mutants are considered to be unable to properly associate with MEK1, and consequently the Crm1-dependent export system does not work as a nuclear exporter for these mutants. The other is the type where the mutants can interact with MEK1 and translocate into the nucleus upon stimulation, indicating that they can form a homodimer and interact with the nuclear pore complex directly or indirectly. Thus, passive diffusion and active transport of ERK2-GFP may use different binding sites of the nuclear pore complex to enter the nucleus. Although the physiological significance of the cytoplasmic localization of the mutants remains to be clarified, it is surmised that passive diffusion of ERK2 into the nucleus might be prevented under certain conditions and that this prevention might affect the MAPK signal transduction pathway. The present study showed that substitution of Tyr314 to alanine residue in ERK2-GFP abrogated its cytoplasmic retention by PTP-SL and its association with PTP-SL. In contrast, no significant changes between the mutant and the wild type were detected in the cytoplasmic retention by MEK1. It has been reported that a leucine residue and two hydrophobic residues upstream and downstream from the basic residues in the docking domain of PTP-SL, respectively, are important for the association of PTP-SL with ERK1/2 (11Zúñiga Á. Torres J. Úbeda J. Pulido R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21900-21907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). MEK1 lacks the corresponding upstream leucine residue. Recently, Xu et al. (31Xu B. Stippec S. Robinson F.L. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26509-26515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) reported that Tyr314 and Tyr315on ERK2 play roles in docking with MEK1 and that the two tyrosine residues may interact with the above-mentioned hydrophobic residues. Our results suggest that Tyr315 may be unnecessary for the interaction of ERK2 with other proteins and that the mutation at Tyr314 does not significantly influence the cytoplasmic retention of ERK2 by MEK1. Because the major difference in the docking domain of PTP-SL from that of MEK1 is the leucine residue upstream from the basic residues, Tyr314 may interact with this leucine residue, resulting in the contribution to stability of the kinase-phosphatase complexes observed. The CD domain is pivotal for recognizing the positively charged region found in the docking domains. However, the specificity of the interaction is unable to be explained by only these acidic residues. PTP-SL recognizes two different classes of MAPKs, ERK and p38 MAPK, but not c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (11Zúñiga Á. Torres J. Úbeda J. Pulido R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21900-21907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Because the two acidic residues are conserved through all of the MAPK families, the interaction partners of ERK2 appear to simultaneously recognize sites other than these acidic residues. The corresponding sequences in p38α MAPK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 to the 314YYDPSD319sequence of ERK2 are YHDPDD and WYDPSE, respectively. Thus, the difference between Tyr and Trp might contribute to the binding and functional specificity. To extend the understanding of the mechanism of substrate binding to MAPKs, detailed work on the specificity of determinants will be required. The present study also showed that whereas the D319A mutation abrogated both the cytoplasmic retention of ERK2-GFP by PTP-SL and the association between them, substitution of Asp316 to an alanine residue had no influence on the cytoplasmic retention by PTP-SL despite a measurable decrease of coprecipitation of (D316A)-GFP with PTP-SL, indicating that the role of Asp316 for the retention of ERK2 in the cytoplasm by PTP-SL may not be so essential under the conditions used in this study. In contrast, MEK1 retained all of the mutants examined in the cytoplasm. These cytoplasmic retentions might be rationalized by the postulation that MEK1 is able to associate with these mutants, although the interaction between them is weak, and has the ability to export the mutants from the nucleus. On the other hand, a MEK1 mutation study demonstrated that both the hydrophobic and basic residues are necessary for MEK1 to exclude overexpressed ERK2 from the nucleus in unstimulated cells (31Xu B. Stippec S. Robinson F.L. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26509-26515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Recently, Robinson et al. (32Robinson F.L. Whitehurts A.W. Raman M. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14844-14852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) identified ERK2 point mutants that failed to interact with MEK1 in a two-hybrid screen. These mutants retained the ability to interact with MAPK-interacting kinase 1, MKP3, and a docking site from ribosomal S6 protein kinase, which are bound to ERK2 through their docking domains. Thus, the presence of additional binding sites to the CD domain is suggested in the case of interaction with MEK1. Finally, we have shown that Tyr314 of ERK2 is essential for its interaction with PTP-SL and that the region close to this residue is important for the passive diffusion of ERK2 into the nucleus. These results raise the possibility of regulatory significance of Tyr314 for the passive diffusion into the nucleus."

Here we show that the low mobility bands formed during strand transfer by Rad51 (or Escherichia coli RecA) represent joint molecules (JM) between the two substrates.

Our assignment is based on pulse-chase and restriction enzyme digestion experiments and verified by electron microscopy. The slower moving group of bands, designated JM2, is formed by an unexpected reaction between JM1 and a second double-stranded linear substrate. Strand transfer of the second duplex initiates noncanonically from the end where the complementary strand is recessed. Thus JM2 is formed by two strand transfer reactions with the same single-stranded circular substrate but with opposite polarities. Finally, we show that the multiple sharp bands in JM1 and JM2 are the result of substrate sequences that pause strand transfer.

Dixon D.A. Eggleston A.K. Lauder S.D. Rehrauer W.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 401-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting nucleoprotein filament then searches the genome for sequences homologous to the tail that can serve as templates for the repair synthesis needed to restore the continuity of the chromosome (2Kowalczykowski S.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 156-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Rad51 is called a strand transfer protein because it catalyzes the invasion of the single-stranded tail into the intact template duplex and transfers base pairing interactions from the identical strand of the template duplex to the tail. The 3′ end of the transferred tail can then serve as a primer for repair synthesis (3Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms of the homology search and subsequent strand transfer are not well understood. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine a process that achieves both the speed and fidelity with which a sequence homolog is found in vivo. The homology search process and the broader mechanism of strand transfer proteins have been studied using an in vitro strand transfer reaction that recapitulates the first steps of homologous recombination (4Radding C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 847-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). Whereas early work focused on the Escherichia coli RecA protein (5Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), theSaccharomyces cerevisiae Rad51 protein has been favored for studies of recombination in eukaryotes (6Bianco P.R. Tracy R.B. Kowalczykowski S.C. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D570-D603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Sung P. Trujillo K.M. Van Komen S. Mutat. Res. 2000; 451: 257-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In the model strand transfer reaction, Rad51 coats a single-stranded circular (ssC)1 DNA to form a nucleoprotein filament that associates with a homologous double-stranded linear (dsL) DNA. Once the nucleoprotein filament has aligned the homologous partners in a paranemic joint, which involves no net intertwining of the substrate DNAs, strand transfer begins from one end of the dsL substrate (8Riddles P.W. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 165-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The strand of the dsL substrate that is complementary to the single-stranded circle, hereafter referred to as the complementary strand, unwinds from the duplex substrate and anneals to the ssC substrate. Unidirectional branch migration, requiring ATP, continues along the dsL substrate until nicked circular (NC) and single-stranded linear (ssL) products are released (9Jain S.K. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20653-20661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). The yeast single-strand binding protein, replication protein A (RPA), is required for strand transfer both to facilitate Rad51 coating of the ssC substrate and to sequester the single-stranded DNA products (11Sigurdsson S. Trujillo K. Song B. Stratton S. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8798-8806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar,12Sung P. Robberson D.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 453-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The two substrates and the two products are easily separated by agarose gel electrophoresis after deproteinization. Rad51 is unique among strand transfer proteins in that it can catalyze branch migration in either the 3′ to 5′ or 5′ to 3′ direction (13Namsaraev E.A. Berg P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3970-3976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 14Mazin A.V. Zaitseva E. Sung P. Kowalczykowski S.C.

A. 1998; 95: 10477-10481Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), however, reported that in vitrostrand transfer requires that the duplex substrate have a single-stranded overhang that is complementary to the DNA in the filament. The reaction initiates at the complementary overhang, which can be a 5′ or 3′ end, and proceeds across the duplex substrate (16Namsaraev E.A. Berg P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10477-10481Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, the polarity of the Rad51 strand transfer reaction is determined only by where initiation occurs. In addition to the two products, strand transfer reactions produce two groups of low electrophoretic mobility species, each comprising several sharp bands, as shown in Fig. 1 (B and C). Although these species have been frequently observed for both RecA and Rad51 reactions (10Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 15McIlwraith M.J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 5052-5057Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), their structure and precise role in strand transfer have been unclear. Kinetic analysis of the yeast Rad51 reaction has shown that low mobility species accumulate in an early fast phase and then dissipate during a second, slower phase as products accumulate (16Namsaraev E.A. Berg P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10477-10481Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this report we show that the low mobility bands formed by yeast Rad51 represent joint molecules (JM) between the two substrates. Based on experiments that determine the stoichiometry and orientation of the dsL substrates within both JM groups, we conclude that the more rapidly migrating group, designated JM1, is made up of obligatory reaction intermediates comprising one ssC and one dsL substrate. The multiple sharp bands seen in the JM1 and JM2 groups and the accumulation of branch points measured by electron microscopy (EM) reveal positions in the substrate that pause branch migration during strand transfer. The slower moving group, called JM2, contains complexes formed between one ssC substrate and two dsL molecules. We show that the second dsL substrate in JM2 reacts from the opposite end from the first and thus the two branch points migrate in opposite directions. Rad51 was purified as described by Sung (10Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar), except that the Sephacryl S200 column was omitted and the final MonoQ column was used twice, first to purify and then to concentrate the protein. Small aliquots of purified Rad51 were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Rad51 storage buffer contained 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 0.35m KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol. RPA was purified from yeast overexpressing all three subunits (23Brill S.J. Stillman B. Nature. 1989; 342: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 24Alani E. Thresher R. Griffith J.D. Kolodner R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 54-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). It was stored in small, single-use aliquots at −80 °C in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.35 m KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol. Strand transfer reactions were performed with ssC and dsL forms of the pBluescript(SK+) phagemid (pBS, Stratagene). Supercoiled DNA was purified from E. coli using two cesium chloride/ethidium bromide isopycnic bandings (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Double-stranded linear DNA substrates were obtained by digesting supercoiled DNA with the restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs) indicated in Fig. 3. The single-stranded circular phagemid DNA was rescued from XL1-Blue E. coli cells containing pBS as described (26Yamamoto K.R. Alberts B.M. Benzinger R. Lawhorne L. Treiber G. Virology. 1970; 40: 734-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). For reactions with a heterologous insertion in one substrate, the ssC was prepared from a deletion derivative of pBluescript constructed by restriction enzyme digestion of the multiple cloning sequence with XhoI and NotI to excise a fragment of 74 bp, treatment with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I to yield blunt ends, and ligation with T4 DNA ligase. Heterologous strand transfer reactions were performed using ssC DNA with a 74-base deletion and pBS dsL DNA without the deletion. Homologous reactions used ssC without the deletion. Throughout this paper we refer to the heterology as an insertion in the dsL, which is functionally equivalent to a deletion in the ssC. For the RecA strand transfer reactions (27West S.C. Howard-Flanders P. Cell. 1984; 37: 683-691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), 4 μg of RecA was mixed with 0.12 μg of single-stranded DNA in 18 μl of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm ATP, 10 mmphosphocreatine, and 10 units/ml creatine kinase. After 5 min at 37 °C, 2 μg of E. coli single-strand binding protein (SSB) was added. After 10 min, 0.24 μg of homologous double-stranded DNA was added and the 25-μl reaction continued for the times indicated. The reaction was stopped by addition of 0.1 volume of 5% SDS and 50 mm EDTA. The Rad51 strand transfer reaction was performed as described by Sung and Stratton (28Sung P. Stratton S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27983-27986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Seven μg of Rad51 was added to 0.12 μg of single-stranded circular DNA in 7.5 μl of 40 mm potassium MOPS (pH 7.2), 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 2.5 mm ATP. After 5 min at 37 °C, 1.5 μg of RPA was added and incubation continued for 10 min. Finally, 0.24 μg of double-stranded linear DNA and spermidine to a final concentration of 4 mm were added for a total reaction volume of 13 μl. Incubation was continued for 30 min unless otherwise noted in the text. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 volume of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 1% SDS, and 1 mg/ml proteinase K, and incubating another 30 min at 37 °C. The DNA was resolved by electrophoresis through a 0.9% agarose gel in TBE buffer (1.1–1.9 V/cm for 600–850 V·h) and then visualized by staining with ethidium bromide or by Southern blotting. Quantification of Southern blots was done with a Fuji phosphorimager. The standard strand transfer protocol was followed using BsaI-cut dsL DNA. Seven minutes after addition of dsL DNA that had been end-labeled with32P, the 13-μl reaction was mixed with 2 μl of 1.6 μg/μl unlabeled dsL DNA (14-fold excess). Samples of 2 μl were removed at times thereafter, diluted to 12 μl, stopped as usual, and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. A standard strand transfer reaction was run in a TBE-buffered gel as the first dimension. The lane was excised and rotated 90°. For the second dimension, a new gel was poured around the excised lane, soaked in 0.5 nNaOH and 1 mm EDTA to denature the DNA, and run in the same NaOH solution at 4 V/cm for 20 h at 4 °C. The gel was re-equilibrated with TBE buffer before Southern blotting. DNA bands in agarose gels were excised, extracted by electro-elution (29He M. Beechey R.B. Kaderbhai M.A. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 728-730PubMed Google Scholar) or by the freeze-squeeze technique (30Thuring R.W. Sanders J.P. Borst P. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 66: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), and resuspended in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0). The purified DNA was then incubated withE. coli SSB (Amersham Biosciences) for 15 min at 37 °C so that the coated single-stranded DNA could be distinguished from duplex DNA (31Chrysogelos S. Griffith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5803-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The DNA-protein complex was then fixed with 0.02% glutaraldehyde for 15 min at 37 °C. Unbound protein was removed by size exclusion chromatography on Sepharose CL-4B (AmershamBiosciences). Samples were then applied to a carbon grid using the poly-l-lysine technique (32Williams R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2311-2315Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), rotary-shadowed with tungsten, and visualized with a JEOL electron microscope. Photographs were taken at a magnification of 25,000, and molecules were measured with a Numonics image digitizer. To determine whether formation of the two groups of low mobility DNA species is a general property of strand transfer proteins, we performed parallel homologous strand transfer reactions with S. cerevisiae Rad51 and E. coli RecA (Fig.1 B). We find that the two distantly related strand transfer proteins generate similar groups of JM bands, suggesting that the bands indeed represent structures that are fundamentally important to the strand transfer reaction. All subsequent experiments used Rad51 and RPA. We next investigated the relationship between the two slow moving sets of bands with a pulse-chase experiment. A strand transfer reaction was initiated by addition of 32P-labeled dsL DNA to a Rad51-coated ssC DNA. After a brief incubation, a 14-fold excess of unlabeled dsL DNA was added. Samples of the reaction were then taken at various times and analyzed by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1 C). At the first time point, immediately after the chase DNA was added, the reacted labeled DNA had formed almost exclusively JM1 bands, suggesting that these bands correspond to the simple reaction intermediate. Over the next 15 min, the majority of the labeled DNA moved into the JM2 region, suggesting that these bands correspond to a more complex structure derived from JM1. The amount of JM2 species peaked at 30 min and declined thereafter. After 15 min, a portion of the labeled DNA had matured into NC product. Because both JM1 and JM2 turn over, it was not possible to distinguish whether the NC product came from one or both of the low mobility species. Three lines of evidence, described next, show that DNA in the JM1 region corresponds to a three-stranded intermediate where one dsL has initiated strand transfer with the ssC (Fig. 1 A,middle diagram). We also show that the sharp bands in the JM1 region are caused by the accumulation of branch points at sequences in the substrate that pause branch migration. We used a substrate plasmid with an inserted 74-base pair heterology to stop branch migration at a defined point (22Holmes V.F. Benjamin K.R. Crisona N.J. Cozzarelli N.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 5052-5057Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The heterology-containing plasmid was digested with one of six restriction enzymes to yield substrates with the heterology at the beginning, middle, or end of the molecule. Enzymes that yielded either 3′ or 5′ complementary overhangs were chosen to test strand transfer in both polarities (Fig. 2 A). Homologous reactions, where the ssC DNA also contained the inserted sequence, yielded NC product for all six dsL substrates, showing that the substrates were competent for strand transfer (as in Fig.2 B, Hom. lane). Unique and reproducible sets of JM1 bands appeared in both homologous and heterologous strand transfer reactions. The first result supporting our proposed structure of the JM1 species was a clear correlation between the position of the heterology within the dsL substrate and the electrophoretic mobility of the predominant JM1 band in each heterologous reaction (Fig. 2 C). The mobility of the JM1 molecules diminished as the heterology was placed farther from the initiating overhang. This JM1 mobility result is easily explained by our proposed structure for the three-stranded intermediate. Neither the total molecular weight nor the total length of duplex can change during branch migration, and thus neither can be responsible for the differences in electrophoretic mobility. The duplex region, however, shifts from a linear to a circular form as the reaction continues. Just as NC DNA migrates more slowly than dsL DNA of the same molecular weight, intermediates that have nearly completed strand transfer and have mostly circular duplex DNA should migrate more slowly than intermediates that have stopped strand transfer early and have mostly linear duplex DNA. The curve in Fig. 2 C was used to map two branch migration pause sites in pBluescript. The mobilities of the one or two minor bands in each JM1 region were measured, and, based on the standard curve, the locations of the pauses were interpolated. JM1 groups with zero or one minor band corresponded to dsL substrates where at least one pause site was beyond the heterology (i.e. NgoMIV or NspI). When the six substrates were aligned by the position of the heterology and the initiating end, as in Fig. 2 A, the interpolated pauses clearly clustered around two sites. The interpolated positions in each cluster were averaged, yielding pause sites at roughly 20 and 70% from the heterology 5′ along the complementary (plus) strand of pBluescript (Fig. 2 A, gray bars). The mobility of minor JM1 bands is plotted against the position of the averaged pause sites for each substrate in Fig. 2 C(gray squares). These points are horizontally offset from the curve because the pause site positions were averaged after interpolation. The inferred positions of the pause sites were confirmed by EM studies described below. The second line of evidence for the JM1 structure is the agreement between the predicted restriction digestion products of a three-stranded intermediate and bands seen after digestion of purified JM1 DNA (Fig.3). The complementary strand in the three-stranded intermediate is paired to two partners, the circular DNA at its proximal end and the linear DNA at its distal end. If branch migration proceeds beyond restriction sites close to the either end of the complementary strand, digestion with appropriate restriction enzymes will yield information about the structure by linearizing the circle or cutting only one of the strands of the duplex. After the joint molecules are deproteinized, the heterology prevents branch migration forward into products. Branch migration backward, however, can cause the joint molecules to fall apart if the branch point reaches the end of the complementary strand. Molecules that fall apart before digestion will yield substrates and not be informative. Molecules that fall apart after digestion, however, will yield the diagnostic fragments shown in Fig. 3 A. JM1 DNA from a heterologous strand transfer reaction with32P-end-labeled dsL DNA was purified from an agarose gel, digested with XmnI and AlwNI that cut ∼500 base pairs from the proximal and distal ends of the dsL, respectively, and analyzed again by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3 B). Besides the expected band produced by digestion of the free linear duplex (cut dsL), two new bands appeared with mobilities that were consistent with the predicted products of digestion of the three-stranded intermediate. The upper band migrated at the expected position of a dsL DNA with a 500-base single-stranded tail at the proximal end. The lower band matched the other structure predicted from the three-stranded intermediate, the 500-base proximal fragment of the complementary strand annealed to the end of the linearized ssC substrate. The third and most direct line of evidence linking bands in the JM1 region to the three-stranded intermediate is the direct visualization of purified JM1 bands by EM. Joint molecule DNA from preparative heterologous strand transfer reactions was isolated from agarose gels and coated with E. coli SSB. SSB thickens single-stranded DNA so that it is visually distinct from double-stranded DNA. Fig. 4 shows representative images of JM1 molecules from heterologous reactions along with schematic traces of the DNA paths. These images clearly show the expected three-stranded intermediate structure with the duplex region split between linear and circular paths. The displaced single-stranded tail and unreacted portion of the ssC, coated by SSB, are also clearly visible. Of several hundred molecules that we identified as being JM1, over 90% could be traced as a duplex linear tail and a partially duplex circle. The remainder was composed mostly of linear duplex reacting with linear single-stranded DNAs, which may correspond to complexes with broken circles or to reactions between the ssL product and a duplex substrate. The position of branch points observed with electron microscopy confirmed that branch points in JM1 accumulate at the heterology. TableI lists measurements from EM images from reactions of the six substrates in Fig. 2 A. Because SSB-coated single-stranded DNA variably appears 2–3-fold shorter than double-stranded DNA of the same length (31Chrysogelos S. Griffith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5803-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), we used only the more accurate length of the double-stranded DNA in our quantitative analysis. The extent of branch migration was calculated as the fraction of duplex DNA that was in the circle. For the predominant band in each heterologous reaction, there was excellent agreement between the fraction of strand transfer and the location of the heterology relative to the complementary overhang of the dsL substrate. In particular, we find no molecules where the branch point is beyond the heterology, confirming that it cannot be bypassed.Table IElectron microscopy analysis of JM1 from heterologous reactionsdsL substrate linearized with:Sample (n)Double-stranded DNA in circleObservedExpectedAfIIIJM1 lower band (19)14 ± 8JM1 upper bands (45)64 ± 8; 83 ± 486BsaIWhole reaction (54)44 ± 1054NgoMIVJM1 (24)10 ± 512DraIIIJM1 (26)70 ± 1285AlwNIWhole reaction (31)29 ± 1027NspIJM1 lower band (13)13 ± 314JM1 upper bandNDThe observed and expected extent of strand exchange seen for JM1 molecules.

We purified the lower JM1 band from a reaction withAflIII-cut dsL DNA separately from the upper two JM1 bands. We found the fraction of the circle that was duplex in molecules from the lower band indicated an average branch migration of 14 ± 8%, consistent with the position of the first predicted pause site at 16%. Molecules in the upper bands showed a bimodal distribution with averages of 64 ± 8%, consistent with the predicted position of the second pause site at 66%, and 83 ± 4%, consistent with the expected position of the heterology at 86% (Table I). Having established the structure of the JM1 species, we turned to determining the structure of the JM2 intermediate. The kinetic studies of the maturation of JM1 (Fig. 1 C) suggest that JM2 is derived from JM1, but many possible structures are consistent with that pathway. For example, JM2 species may comprise two circles reacting with a single dsL DNA, or to a structure where the displaced ssL tail has reacted with a second dsL or with a second JM1. We distinguished among the possibilities with two biochemical experiments and EM of purified JM2 structures. First, we examined the effect of dsL substrate concentration on the amount of JM2 formed. Strand transfer reactions were performed with the usual amount of ssC but between a 1:1 and 4:1 molar ratio of dsL to ssC (Fig. 5 A). Whereas the amount of JM1 increased less than 1.5-fold across the titration, the amount of JM2 increased 4.4-fold, suggesting that JM2 formation involves multiple dsL molecules per ssC DNA. Second, we determined the stoichiometries of the dsL to ssC substrates within the JM2 species. We examined a standard homologous strand transfer reaction by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in which the first dimension was run in standard TBE buffer and the second in denaturing conditions where all joint molecules separate into constituent ssC and ssL DNAs (Fig. 5 B). Averaging three experiments, which were each normalized to a 1:1 ratio of ssL to ssC for the NC product, we found that JM1 contained 2.1 ± 0.5 ssL strands for each ssC DNA and that JM2 contained 3.3 ± 0.7"
