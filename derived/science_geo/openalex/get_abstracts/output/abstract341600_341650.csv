https://openalex.org/W2060826481,"Oxygen isotopic and microfaunal analyses and shell size variations of Orbulina universa in two Indian Ocean cores indicate that the position of the Subtropical Convergence has fluctuated between a northern limit north of 31 degrees S during glacial stages and its present, maximum southern limit. The northward displacement of the Subtropical Convergence to a position off Durban, South Africa, reflects the general weakness of the Agulhas Current during glacial stages and parts of interglacial stages, representing about 65 percent of the past 540,000 years."

https://openalex.org/W2084164679,"Australian halictines belong to the primitive genus Lasioglossum or related subgenera. The underground nests have lined cells in series or clusters and sometimes at the end of laterals. Two full generations per year are produced in the communal nests. Overwintered and newly emerged females form unique ""pseudosocieties"" rather than matrifilial societies along Holarctic patterns. Several Chilalictus species produce a ""male caste"" of big-headed, flightless males, in addition to normal individuals. Oviposition of unfertilized eggs on large pollen balls causes such allometric bees."
https://openalex.org/W2051378610,"Multivariate cluster analysis of various morphologic indices of Orbulina universa populations from the Indian Ocean indicate the existence of two major groups whose geographic distribution corresponds to the equatorial and central water masses. An abrupt change in shell porosity between populations of this planktonic foraminiferal species in plankton as well as sediment samples occurs within or near the 10 degrees S Hydrochemical Front. Orbulina universa is an excellent indicator of oceanographic conditions in the Indian Ocean today, and may be used as an independent check on shifts in water masses during the last glaciation."

https://openalex.org/W2154394914,"The advantages of using electronics to control the engine combustion, are discussed, the electronic spark timing control is described, the efforts by Chrysler, General Motors and Ford and reviewed, and the closed loop feedback control system is described. An electronic spark timing control which is part of Chrysler's Lean Burn system, senses 8 variables before computing the time for spark firing. The variables sensed include amibent air temperature, engine coolant temperature, manifold vacuum, engine speed, throttle position, and rate of change of the throttle position. Speculation has, however, centered on the progressively increasing sophistication of the microprocessor which offers the flexibility of being able to rapidly alter the control system to respond to additional variables or to control additional functions simply by changing the program. A digital microcomputer (MISAR) which controls spark timing is described; it comprises a microprocessor and table of 350 data points. Test runs indicate that MISAR achieves a 9% improvement in fuel economy. Efforts to produce an electronically controlled carburator for closed loop fuel metering, and efforts to demonstrate that electronic engine controls can help meet fuel and emission standards in low-volume applications are briefly discussed."
