https://openalex.org/W4309218441,"Superspreading events are important drivers of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and long-range (LR) transmission is believed to play a major role. We investigated two choir outbreaks with different attack rates (AR) to analyze the contribution of LR transmission and highlight important measures for prevention.We conducted two retrospective cohort studies and obtained demographic, clinical, laboratory and contact data, performed SARS-CoV-2 serology, whole genome sequencing (WGS), calculated LR transmission probabilities, measured particle emissions of selected choir members, and calculated particle air concentrations and inhalation doses.We included 65 (84%) and 42 (100%) members of choirs 1 and 2, respectively, of whom 58 (89%) and 10 (24%) became cases. WGS confirmed strain identity in both choirs. Both primary cases transmitted presymptomatically. Particle emission rate when singing was 7 times higher compared to talking. In choir 1, the median concentration of primary cases' emitted particles in the room was estimated to be 8 times higher, exposure at least 30 minutes longer and room volume smaller than in choir 2, resulting in markedly different estimated probabilities for LR transmission (mode: 90% vs. 16%, 95% CI: 80-95% vs. 6-36%). According to a risk model, the first transmission in choir 1 occurred likely after 8 minutes of singing.The attack rate of the two choirs differed significantly reflecting the differences in LR transmission risks. The pooled proportion of cases due to LR transmission was substantial (81%; 55/68 cases) and was facilitated by likely highly infectious primary cases, high particle emission rates, and indoor rehearsing for an extended time. Even in large rooms, singing of an infectious person may lead to secondary infections through LR exposure within minutes. In the context of indoor gatherings without mask-wearing and waning or insufficient immunity, these results highlight the ongoing importance of non-pharmaceutical interventions wherever aerosols can accumulate."

https://openalex.org/W4309264203,"Septoturbinoplasty is a surgical procedure that can improve nasal congestion symptoms in patients with nasal septal deviation and inferior turbinate hypertrophy. However, it is unclear which physical domains of nasal airflow after septoturbinoplasty are related to symptomatic improvement. This work employs computational fluid dynamics modeling to identify the physical variables and domains associated with symptomatic improvement. Sixteen numerical models were generated using eight patients' pre- and postoperative computed tomography scans. Changes in unilateral nasal resistance, surface heat flux, relative humidity, and air temperature and their correlations with improvement in the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) score were analyzed. The NOSE score significantly improved after septoturbinoplasty, from 14.4 ± 3.6 to 4.0 ± 4.2 (p < 0.001). The surgery not only increased the airflow partition on the more obstructed side (MOS) from 31.6 ± 9.6 to 41.9 ± 4.7% (p = 0.043), but also reduced the unilateral nasal resistance in the MOS from 0.200 ± 0.095 to 0.066 ± 0.055 Pa/(mL·s) (p = 0.004). Improvement in the NOSE score correlated significantly with the reduction in unilateral nasal resistance in the preoperative MOS (r = 0.81). Also, improvement in the NOSE score correlated better with the increase in surface heat flux in the preoperative MOS region from the nasal valve to the choanae (r = 0.87) than in the vestibule area (r = 0.63). Therefore, unilateral nasal resistance and mucous cooling in the preoperative MOS can explain the perceived improvement in symptoms after septoturbinoplasty. Moreover, the physical domain between the nasal valve and the choanae might be more relevant to patient-reported patency than the vestibule area."

This study aimed to provide information on including bone protein meal (BPM) or feather meal (FM) in extruded dog diets with regard to digestibility and fecal characteristics in two trials. In the first trial, compared to the control (BPM0), 6, 12, and 24% of the basic diets were replaced by BPM (BPM6, BPM12, and BPM24, respectively). In the second trial, in comparison to the control (FM0), 5, 10, and 20% of the basic diets were replaced by FM (FM5, FM10, and FM20, respectively). In both trials, six Beagle dogs (BW 17.3±2.14 and 18.1±2.04 kg for trials 1 and 2, respectively) participated in a crossover experiment design. Five days were used as wash-out before each experimental period for each trial. The fecal consistency scores were based on a 5-point scale (1 = very hard, 2 = solid, well formed “optimum”, and 5 = watery diarrhea). In the first trial, results showed that the apparent digestibility of dry matter, crude protein, and crude fat was significantly lower for dogs fed BPM6 compared to those fed BPM24. There was a lower number of dogs with a fecal consistency score value &gt; 2 (16.7%) among those fed BPM6 (median = 2, Interquartile range (IQR) = 0) compared to those fed BPM24 (83.3%). The fecal dry matter content was significantly ( p &lt; 0.05) the highest (39.4%±2.15) for dogs fed BPM6. In the second trial, the data revealed that dogs fed FM0 had significantly ( p &lt; 0.05) the highest organic matter digestibility (87.2%±1.05), while dogs fed FM20 had significantly ( p &lt; 0.05) the lowest crude fat digestibility (95.0%±0.95). Inclusion of FM at 10% or 20% in the diet decreased fecal dry matter significantly (29.0%±2.10 and 27.9%±2.46, respectively) compared to those animals offered FM0 (31.1%±2.56). Among those dogs fed FM0 and FM5, there was a lower significant number of dogs with a fecal score value &gt; 2 (16.7% and 16.7%, respectively; p &lt; 0.05). While the fecal score was significantly a higher (median = 4, IQR = 0) for dogs fed FM20. Including FM at any level in the diet resulted in significantly higher levels of iso-butyric and iso-valeric acids compared to FM0. These findings in both trials suggest that apparent crude protein digestibility was not affected when diets containing BPM up to 24% and FM up to 20% were offered, but fecal quality was reduced."
https://openalex.org/W4309264001,"The global societal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is incalculable with profound social suffering, deep economic hardships and enforced closure of schools, businesses, and higher learning institutions through the imposition of lockdown and social distancing in mitigation of the spread of the SARS-Cov-2 infection. Institutions have had to hastily migrate teaching, learning and assessment to online domains, at times with ill-prepared academics, students and institutions and with unwelcome and disorienting consequences. Our study surveyed perspectives of faculty at the University of Zimbabwe Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences (UZFMHS) towards the hastily adopted online teaching, learning and assessment implemented in response to the mitigation of the COVID-19 pandemic. Twenty nine (29) faculty in all the major disciplines and career hierarchy. There were mixed responses regarding the use of this modality for teaching, learning and assessment: training before online teaching, learning and assessment, advantages and disadvantages, cost effectiveness, effectiveness for teaching, learning and assessment, effect on student feedback, disruptions from internet connectivity issues, interaction with students, suitability for practical training, and barriers to online teaching, learning and assessment. These results would enable the UZFMHS develop institutional and personalised approaches that would enable execution of online teaching, learning and assessment under the current and post COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4309264110,"Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a prevalent nosocomial illness in mechanically ventilated patients. Hence, the aim of this study was to investigate the pattern of antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation of bacterial profiles from Endotracheal Tubes of patients hospitalized in an intensive care unit in southwest Iran. According to the standard operating method, the microbiological laboratory conducts bacteria culture and susceptibility testing on endotracheal Tube samples suspected of carrying a bacterial infection. The Clinical and laboratory standards institute (CLSI) techniques are used to determine the Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) of bacterial isolates to antibiotics using the disk diffusion method. The crystal violet staining method was used to assess the biofilm-forming potential of isolates in a 96-well microtiter plate. In total, (51%) GPBs were included in this study. The isolated GPB were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (16%), S. aureus (14%). In total, (40%) of GNB were included in this study. The isolated GNB were Klebsiella spp. (36%), A. baumannii (22%), P. aeruginosa (35%). (32%) bacterial strains were MDR and (29%) strains were XDR. The results of biofilm formation showed (72%) were biofilm producers. VAP is a common and severe nosocomial infection in mechanically ventilated patients. Controlling biofilm formation, whether on the ET or in the oropharyngeal cavity, is thus an important technique for treating VAP. Colistin and linezolid are antibiotics that are effective against practically all resistant GNB and GPB isolates."
https://openalex.org/W4309264184,"Patients with versus without atopic dermatitis may have a greater risk of cardiovascular events, and the risk increases with severity of atopic dermatitis. The incidence of cardiovascular events in the population of patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis is largely unknown. This retrospective study evaluates incidence rates of cardiovascular events in patients aged ≥12 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in a cohort of Kaiser Permanente Northern California health care system members without recognized risk factors for adverse events. Patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, as defined by dermatologist-rendered code and prescription history between 2007 and 2018, were included. Major adverse cardiovascular events, venous thrombotic events, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolisms were identified via International Classification of Diseases codes. Stratification variables included age, sex, race, smoking history, and diabetes. Incidence rates per 1000 person-years were calculated by the number of patients with an incident event divided by the total person-years of observation. Among 8197 patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, incidence rates per 1000 person-years (95% confidence interval) for major adverse cardiovascular events, venous thrombotic events, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism were: 2.6 (2.1–3.2), 2.0 (1.5–2.5), 1.6 (1.2–2.1), and 0.7 (0.5–1.0), respectively. Incidence rates for all events were higher for older versus younger patients, patients with versus without diabetes, former smokers versus patients who had never smoked, and men versus women, except for pulmonary embolisms, which were higher in women. This study estimated the incidence of cardiovascular events in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and provides valuable information for clinicians."
https://openalex.org/W4309264192,"Despite men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) from Latin America (LA) are still a vulnerable population for known health-related conditions and social problems, availability of comparable data across LA countries for assessment and monitoring purposes is limited. The objective of this article is to present the study design and the questionnaire of LAMIS-2018 (Latin America MSM Internet Survey), its recruitment strategy, rates and sources by country, and the lessons learned from its implementation. LAMIS-2018 was a cross-sectional, internet-based survey targeting MSM living in 18 LA countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela) that gathered data about sexual behaviors, HIV/STI and viral hepatitis knowledge, prophylactic use of antiretrovirals, psychosocial health, and access to sexual health services. The survey went online for four months and was available in three languages (Spanish, Portuguese, and Dutch). Promotion was carried out using dating apps, websites, social networks, and by community-based and academic organizations of each participating country directly in gay venues and in their own premises. Overall, 64,655 MSM participated in LAMIS-2018. Dating apps and websites were the most important recruitment source in most countries, except for Honduras, Nicaragua, and Suriname, where community-based organizations recruited most of the participants. Beyond the LAMIS-2018 implementation description, we highlight the feasibility of such a study in this context, based on the collaboration between community-based and academic organizations to obtain a large sample of MSM in the region. LAMIS-2018 data will contribute to identify determinants of risk behaviors and prevention needs of vulnerable MSM populations in each country of the region."
https://openalex.org/W4309264216,"To improve the dietary habits of the population, the EU, within the Farm to Fork strategy (F2F), is strongly supporting the Nutri-Score (NS) Front Of Pack (FOP) label. Under the NS system, Geographical Indications (GIs) are generally scored as “unhealthy” food, given the predominance of products of animal origin among GIs which are, notoriously, high-fat products. This study aims to determine the impact of the NS label on consumers’ preferences for two Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) cheeses, in comparison with generic ones. A Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) was conducted on 600 Italian consumers through the estimation of a Random Parameter Logit model. Results highlighted that Italian consumers are generally not familiar with the NS and perceive it as a positive characteristic of the product, even if it is signalling an unhealthy choice (D score). However, consumers aware of the Nutri-Score meaning are willing to pay less to buy a product considered “unhealthy” according to this system. Furthermore, we found that consumers who already knew the NS system have homogeneous behaviours in rejecting the product, independently of the association with a PDO certification. This result has important implications on the agri-food sector. If the Nutri-Score becomes mandatory in the EU, consumers might refuse many GIs due to their negative Nutri-Score values. However, the quality of these products is recognized and protected worldwide. In this vein, the GI policy could be questioned by the F2F strategy: both of them aims to reduce information asymmetry producing, at the same time, contrasting results. Within the Geographical Indication policy, the PDO and PGI goods are protected for their quality attributes, which are strictly linked to their geographical origin of the products and traditional know-how. However, the EU adoption of the Nutri-Score could damage these products, reducing their perceived quality/value."
https://openalex.org/W4309264233,"The COVID-19 pandemic drove rapid adoption of telehealth across oncologic specialties. This revealed barriers to telehealth access and telehealth-related disparities. We explored disparities in telehealth access in patients with cancer accessing oncologic care.Data for all unique patient visits at a large academic medical center were acquired pre- and intra-pandemic (7/1/2019-12/31/2020), including visit type (in-person, video, audio only), age, race, ethnicity, rural/urban (per zip code by Federal Office of Rural Health Policy), distance from medical facility, insurance, and Digital Divide Index (DDI; incorporates technology/internet access, age, disability, and educational attainment metrics by geographic area). Pandemic phases were identified based on visit dynamics. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine associations of these variables with successful video visit completion.Data were available for 2,398,633 visits for 516,428 patients across all specialties. Among these, there were 253,880 visits from 62,172 patients seen in any oncology clinic. Dramatic increases in telehealth usage were seen during the pandemic (after 3/16/2020). In multivariable analyses, patient age [OR: 0.964, (95% CI 0.961, 0.966) P<0.0001], rural zip code [OR: 0.814 (95% CI 0.733, 0.904) P = 0.0001], Medicaid enrollment [OR: 0.464 (95% CI 0.410, 0.525) P<0.0001], Medicare enrollment [OR: 0.822 (95% CI 0.761, 0.888) P = 0.0053], higher DDI [OR: 0.903 (95% CI 0.877, 0.930) P<0.0001], distance from the facility [OR: 1.028 (95% CI 1.021, 1.035) P<0.0001], black race [OR: 0.663 (95% CI 0.584, 0.753) P<0.0001], and Asian race [OR: 1.229 (95% CI 1.022, 1.479) P<0.0001] were associated with video visit completion early in the pandemic. Factors related to video visit completion later in the pandemic and within sub-specialties of oncology were also explored.Patients from older age groups, those with minority backgrounds, and individuals from areas with less access to technology (high DDI) as well as those with Medicare or Medicaid insurance were less likely to use video visits. With greater experience through the pandemic, disparities were not mitigated. Further efforts are required to optimize telehealth to benefit all patients and avoid increasing disparities in care delivery."
https://openalex.org/W4309264254,"Financial inclusion is critical to inclusive growth, proffering policy solutions to eradicate the barriers that exclude individuals from financial markets. This study explores the effects of financial inclusion on economic growth in a global perspective with a large number of panels classified by income and regional levels from 2002–2020. The analysis begins with the development of a comprehensive composite financial inclusion index comprised of penetration, availability, and usage of financial services and the estimation of heterogeneous panel data models augmented with well-known variables. The results obtained from the panel cointegration test support a long-run relationship between economic growth, financial inclusion, and the control variables in the full panel, income-level, and regional-level economies. Furthermore, the study employs a GMM (generalized method of moment) approach using System-GMM estimators to examine the effects of financial inclusion and the control predictors on economic growth. The results of the GMM model clearly indicate that financial inclusion has a significantly positive impact on economic growth across all panels, implying that financial inclusion is an effective tool in fostering rapid economic growth in the world. Finally, the study delves into the causality relationship between the predictors and provides statistical evidence of bidirectional causality between economic growth and financial inclusion, whereas it only supports unidirectional causality relationships from credit to the private sector, foreign direct investment, inflation rate, the rule of law, school enrollment ratio, and trade openness with no feedback causality. Moreover, the study fails to provide causality evidence from the age dependency ratio and population to economic growth."
https://openalex.org/W4309264260,"We developed a quantitative Instrument for measuring Temporal and Social Disorientation (ITSD), aimed at major crises such as the Covid-19 pandemic. Disorientation has been identified as one of the central elements of the psychological impact of the Covid-19 era on the general public, but so far, the question has only been approached qualitatively. This paper offers an empirical, quantitative approach to the multi-faceted disorientation of the Covid-19 pandemic by operationalising the issue with the help of the ITSD. The ITSD was developed through multiple stages involving a preliminary open-ended questionnaire followed by a coder-based thematic analysis. This paper establishes the reliability and validity of the resulting ITSD using a 3-step validation process on a sample size of 3306."
https://openalex.org/W4309264262,"The knowledge of the structural and chemical properties of biochars is decisive for their application as technical products. For this reason, methods for the characterization of biochars that are generally applicable and allow quality control are highly desired. Several methods that have shown potential in other studies were used to investigate two activated carbons and seven biochars from different processes and feedstock. The chars were chosen to cover a wide range of chemical composition and structural properties as a hardness test for the analytical methods used in this study. Specific problems connected with the pretreatment of samples and drawbacks of some methods for some types of chars could be identified in an integrated consideration of the results from different methods. None of the spectroscopic methods was found to be suitable for the quality control of all types of chars. The most valuable results were obtained by chemical analysis that, however, required the complete determination of the main elements, including that of oxygen, and of inorganic components for adequate results. The combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and FT-IR spectroscopy allows a rough characterization of surface functional groups, but cannot discriminate aliphatic and aromatic OH groups. FT-IR might be a suitable method for the quality control of biochars made at lower temperature. The results of Raman spectroscopy did not well correlate with the amount of sp2 hybridized carbon determined by XPS. A better correlation of XPS data was found with the electrical polarization determined by the method of spectral induced polarization that was used for the first time in conjunction with extensive analytical characterization."
https://openalex.org/W4309508062,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) adopts several immune evasion mechanisms such as interfering with innate immunity or promoting T-cell exhaustion. However, the recent direct-antiviral agents (DAAs) rapidly eliminate the virus, and the repercussions in terms of immune system balance are unknown. Here we compared the PBMCs transcriptomic profile of patients with HCV chronic infection at baseline (T0) and 12 weeks after the end of the therapy (SVR12) with DAAs. 3862 genes were differently modulated, identifying oxidative phosphorylation as the top canonical pathway differentially activated. Therefore, we dissected PBMCs bioenergetic profile by analyzing mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis at 4 timepoints: T0, 4 weeks of therapy, end of therapy (EoT), and SVR12. Maximal and reserve respiratory capacity considerably increased at EoT, persisting until SVR12. Notably, over time a significant increase was observed in respiratory chain (RC) complexes protein levels and the enzymatic activity of complexes I, II, and IV. Mitochondrial-DNA integrity improved over time, and the expression of mitochondrial biogenesis key regulators such as TFAM, Nrf-1, and PPARGC1A significantly increased at SVR12; hence, RC complexes synthesis and mitochondrial respiration were supported after treatment. HCV clearance with DAAS profoundly changed PBMCs bioenergetic profile, suggesting the immunometabolism study as a new approach to the understanding of viral immune evasion mechanisms and host adaptations during infections and therapies."
https://openalex.org/W4309508179,"Cerebral ischemia activates neural progenitors that participate in brain remodeling following acute injury. Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) signaling governs cell proliferation and mobilization, yet its potential impact on neural progenitors and stroke recovery remains poorly understood. The goal of this study was to investigate the impact of S1PR modulation on post-stroke neurogenesis and functional recovery, using a S1PR modulator BAF312. Mice were subjected to 60 min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and received BAF312 starting from day 3 after MCAO until the end of experiment. BAF312 facilitated motor function recovery in MCAO mice until day 14 after surgery. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that BAF312 treatment led to an increase of type A cells in subventricular zone (SVZ), but not other progenitor cell subsets in MCAO mice. We found an increase of BrdU incorporation in SVZ DCX+ cells from MCAO mice receiving BAF312 and augmented proliferation of DCX+ cells in cultured neurospheres isolated from SVZ tissues. Notably, a S1PR1 antagonist W146 abolished BAF312-induced increase of SVZ type A cells from MCAO mice and proliferation of DCX+ cells in cultured neurospheres. Additionally, the benefit of BAF312 to improve neurogenesis and stroke recovery remains in Rag2-/- mice lacking of T and B cells. Our results demonstrate that S1PR modulation improves neurogenesis and functional recovery following brain ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W4309218364,"Background Information on the long-term pulmonary sequelae following SARS-CoV-2 infection is limited. Methods Prospective cohort study of hospitalized and non-hospitalized adult patients age &gt;18 with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR three months prior to enrolment between June and December 2020. Participants underwent full pulmonary function test (PFT), cardiopulmonary exercise testing at 3 months and 6 months. Primary outcome was mean differences of forced vital capacity (FVC), diffuse capacity of lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO), and oxygen consumption (VO2) at 6 vs. 3 months. Secondary outcomes were respiratory outcomes classified into 5 clinical groups–no lung disease, resolved lung disease, persistent lung disease, PFT abnormalities attributable to pre-existing lung disease or other factors, and mild PFT abnormalities of uncertain clinical significance. Results Fifty-one, 30 hospitalized and 21 non-hospitalized, participants were included. Median age was 51 years; 20 (39.2%) were female. Mean (±SD) percent predicted values of FVC, DLCO and VO2 at 3 vs 6-month-visits were 96.2 ± 15.6 vs. 97.6 ± 15.5, 73.74 ±18 vs. 78.5 ± 15.5, and 75.5 ± 18.9 vs. 76.1 ± 21.5, respectively. Nineteen (37%) patients had physiologic and/or radiographic evidence of lung disease at 3 months with eight (15.7%) continuing to have persistent disease at 6 months. History of diabetes, hypertension, ICU admission and elevated D-Dimer levels were associated with persistent lung disease at 6 months. Interpretation Persistent lung disease at 6 months post SARS-CoV-2 infection exists. Changes of lung function between 3- and 6-months are not significant. A longer follow-up is required to determine long-term prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W4309218591,"In 2013, Thailand was ranked second in the world in road accident fatalities (RAFs), with 36.2 per 100,000 people. During the Songkran festival, which takes place during the traditional Thai New Year in April, the number of road traffic accidents (RTAs) and RAFs are markedly higher than on regular days, but few studies have investigated this issue as an effect of festivity. This study investigated the factors that contribute to RAFs using various count regression models. Data on 20,229 accidents in 2015 were collected from the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation in Thailand. The Poisson and Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (CMP) distributions, and their zero-Inflated (ZI) versions were applied to fit the data. The results showed that RAFs in Thailand follow a count distribution with underdispersion and excessive zeros, which is rare. The ZICMP model marginally outperformed the CMP model, suggesting that having many zeros does not necessarily mean that the ZI model is required. The model choice depends on the question of interest, and a separate set of predictors highlights the distinct aspects of the data. Using ZICMP, road, weather, and environmental factors affected the differences in RAFs among all accidents, whereas month distinguished actual non-fatal accidents and crashes with or without deaths. As expected, actual non-fatal accidents were 2.37 times higher in April than in January. Using CMP, these variables were significant predictors of zeros and frequent deaths in each accident. The RAF average was surprisingly higher in other months than in January, except for April, which was unexpectedly lower. Thai authorities have invested considerable effort and resources to improve road safety during festival weeks to no avail. However, our study results indicate that people's risk perceptions and public awareness of RAFs are misleading. Therefore, nationwide road safety should instead be advocated by the authorities to raise society's awareness of everyday personal safety and the safety of others."
https://openalex.org/W4309263959,"Pelvic Floor Disorders (PFDs) affects many women and have a significant impact on their quality of life. Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ-7) and Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI-20) help to assess PFDs; however, both are not culturally translated into the Amharic-language. Hence, we aimed to translate the English versions of short forms of the PFDI-20 and PFIQ-7 into Amharic-language and evaluate their psychometric properties in Amharic-speaking Ethiopian women with symptomatic PFDs.The PFDI-20 and PFIQ-7 were translated into Amharic language using standard procedures. The Amharic versions were completed by 197 patients (response rate 92%) with PFDs from University of Gondar specialized and comprehensive Hospital. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability were examined through Cronbach's alpha and Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). A relative criterion standard, POP-SS-7 score, was correlated with total PFDI-20 and subscale POPDI-6 scores using spearman's rank order correlation (SCC). Construct validity was evaluated by known group validity using the Mann-Whitney U test.Both instruments were successfully translated and adapted with an excellent content validity (&gt; 0.90). The Amharic versions of the PFDI-20 and PFIQ-7 showed excellent internal consistency and test-retest reliability in both summary and subscales (Cronbach's alpha: 0.92 for PFDI-20 and 0.91 for PFIQ-7; and ICC: 0.97 for PFDI-20 and 0.86 for PFIQ-7). Criterion validity was good for POPDI-6 (SCC = 0.71; p &lt; 0.001). Moreover, construct validity was acceptable, showing significant differences among groups of PFDs in the PFDI-20 and PFIQ-7 scores (Mann-Whitney U Test; p &lt; 0.001).The Amharic versions of the PFDI-20 and PFIQ-7 are comprehensible, reliable, valid, and feasible in Ethiopian Amharic-speaking women with PFDs to evaluate symptoms and its impact during research and clinical practice. However, further studies are needed to evaluate the responsiveness."
https://openalex.org/W4309264205,"We imaged the carbohydrate-selective spatial binding of 8 lectins in the ampullary organs (AOs) of electroreceptors on the rostrum of freshwater paddlefish (Polyodon spathula), by fluorescence imaging and morphometry of frozen sections. A focus was candidate sites of secretion of the glycoprotein gel filling the lumen of AOs. The rostrum of Polyodon is an electrosensory appendage anterior of the head, covered with >50,000 AOs, each homologous with the ampulla of Lorenzini electroreceptors of marine rays and sharks. A large electrosensory neuroepithelium (EN) lines the basal pole of each AO's lumen in Polyodon; support cells occupy most (97%) of an EN's apical area, along with electrosensitive receptor cells. (1) Lectins WGA or SBA labeled the AO gel. High concentrations of the N-acetyl-aminocarbohydrate ligands of these lectins were reported in canal gel of ampullae of Lorenzini, supporting homology of Polyodon AOs. In cross sections of EN, WGA or SBA labeled cytoplasmic vesicles and organelles in support cells, especially apically, apparently secretory. Abundant phalloidin+ microvilli on the apical faces of support cells yielded the brightest label by lectins WGA or SBA. In parallel views of the apical EN surface, WGA labeled only support cells. We concluded that EN support cells massively secrete gel from their apical microvilli (and surface?), containing amino carbohydrate ligands of WGA or SBA, into the AO lumen. (2) Lectins RCA120 or ConA also labeled EN support cells, each differently. RCA120-fluorescein brightly labeled extensive Golgi tubules in the apical halves of EN cells. ConA did not label microvilli, but brightly labeled small vesicles throughout support cells, apparently non-secretory. (3) We demonstrated ""sockets"" surrounding the basolateral exteriors of EN receptor cells, as candidate glycocalyces. (4) We explored whether additional secretions may arise from non-EN epithelial cells of the interior ampulla wall. (5) Model: Gel is secreted mainly by support cells in the large EN covering each AO's basal pole. Secreted gel is pushed toward the pore, and out. We modeled gel velocity as increasing ~11x, going distally in AOs (toward the narrowed neck and pore), due to geometrical taper of the ampulla wall. Gel renewal and accelerated expulsion may defend against invasion of the AO lumen by microbes or small parasites. (6) We surveyed lectin labeling of accessory structures, including papilla cells in AO necks, striated ectoderm epidermis, and sheaths on afferent axons or on terminal glia."

In this work, Kappa (B.1.617.1), Delta (B.1.617.2), and Omicron (B.1.1.529) variants were obtained to evaluate whether naturally occurring mutations have strengthened viral infectivity. We apply reliable in silico structural dynamics and energetic frameworks of the mutated S-RBD protein for ACE2-binding to analyze and compare the structural information related to the wild-type. In particular, the hotspot residues at Q493, Q498, and N501 on the S-RBD protein were determined as contributing factors to the employment stability of the relevant binding interface. The L452R mutation induces an increment of the hydrogen bonds formed by changing the Q493 environment for ACE2 binding. Moreover, the Q493K exchange in Omicron enables the formation of two additional salt bridges, leading to a strong binding affinity by increased electrostatic interaction energy. These results could be used in proposing concrete informative data for a structure-based design engaged in finding better therapeutics against novel variants."
https://openalex.org/W4309264225,"Pain is an experience of a subjective nature, interpreted in a personal way and according to an extensive palette of factors unique to each individual. Orofacial pain can be acute or chronic and it is usually the main reason for the patient to seek dental care. Pain perception varies widely among individuals. This variability is considered a mosaic of factors, which include biopsychosocial factors and genetic factors. Understanding these differences can be extremely beneficial for pain management in a personalized and more efficient way. We performed association studies to investigate phenotypes associated with genetic markers in pain-related genes in two groups of patients who received more or less anesthesia during dental treatment. The study group was comprised of 1289 individuals participating in the Dental Registry and DNA Repository Project (DRDR) of the University of Pittsburgh, with 900 participants in the group that received the most anesthesia and 389 constituting the comparison group that received less anesthesia. We tested 58 phenotypes and genotypic data of seven SNPs in genes that are associated with pain perception, pain modulation and response to drugs used in pain treatment: COMT (rs4818 and rs6269), GCH1 (rs3783641), DRD2 (rs6276), OPRM1 (rs1799971), SCN9A (rs6746030) and SCN10A (rs6795970). The analysis revealed a protective effect of rs1799971 on asthma in the total sample. rs3783641 was associated with salivary secretion disorders in females who received more anesthesia. rs1799971 was also associated with periodontitis in Whites who received less anesthesia. rs4818 was associated with disease and other tongue conditions in the group composed of Blacks who received less anesthesia. In conclusion, our study implicated variants in pain-related genes in asthma and oral phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W4309264229,"Grounded in an ecodevelopment perspective, in the current study we examined unique and moderating effects of daily COVID-19 prevalence (social contexts) on effects of COVID-19 related risk and protective factors such as emotional distress (individual contexts) and employment (working from home and unemployment status; family contexts) on family functioning among 160 recent immigrant families in Israel. In general, results indicate several unique effects of COVID-19 related factors (such as COVID-19 emotional distress, unemployment, and remote work arrangements) on both parents' and adolescents' reports of family functioning. However, results indicated that there were more significant associations between COVID-19 factors (e.g., emotional distress and COVID-19 prevalence) and family functioning indicators with adolescents, than with parents. The effects of COVID-19 factors (e.g., emotional distress and remote work arrangements) were moderated by daily COVID-19 prevalence (new cases and deaths). We discuss ways in which interventionists can contribute to pandemic-related research to promote optimal family functioning among immigrant families."
https://openalex.org/W4309264239,"This paper investigates the online discourses on ""sustainability"" and explores how environmental sustainability has been constructed within the Saudi online discourse. In doing so, the study focuses on the potential of the Saudi Green Initiative (SGI), along with Green Riyadh and King Salman Park, to promote sustainability awareness in the kingdom. The corpus of the study comprises news articles and Twitter hashtags. In addition, the study uses corpus-based discourse analysis to examine the keyness and intertextuality. The results of the study convey a contextualized national identity while communicating internationally within discursive circles. It is also identified that interdiscursivity is central in the corpus, although the discourse of action especially dominated other smaller discourses, such as consequences/risks, economy, and tourism. The results also indicate the prominent construction of officials, which could be linked to the dynamics of change in the Saudi scene. Finally, the study emphasizes the action-oriented nature of such discourse while drawing attention to some of the challenging issues to long-term advocacy in the country."
https://openalex.org/W4309264257,"For the problem of coal dust pollution in the return air lane of the comprehensive mining working face of soft rock mines.Based on the principle of supersonic siphon pneumatic atomization dust control, mobile vehicle-mounted pneumatic spraying combined with full-section fog curtain dust control technology is proposed to address the coal dust pollution problem in the return air tunnel of the comprehensive mining working face of soft rock mines. This technology has a wider spraying range, stronger wind resistance and lower energy consumption.Using the k-ε turbulence module and the fluid flow particle tracking module of COMSOL simulation software, a three-dimensional numerical model of the return air tunnel was established. The effect of wind flow characteristics on the diffusion range of coal dust and fog droplets was analysed, and the dust transport pattern and dust control effect of the new technology were obtained for different cross-sectional return airways. The results show that the velocity of the wind flow is continuously decayed by the slope, and the dust of different particle sizes is distributed differently by the inertial force. Coal dust with particle sizes larger than 6.5 μm accumulates below the structure at a lower velocity, and coal dust with particle sizes smaller than 4.5 μm is mostly suspended above the structure at a higher velocity. The device effectively stops the transport of dust and covers the whole section of the roadway, and the dust removal efficiency reaches 96.53%~97.93%, which provides relevant theoretical support and treatment means for the control of dust pollution in the return airway of coal mines."
https://openalex.org/W4309264259,"Despite the growing availability of artificial intelligence models for predicting type 2 diabetes, there is still a lack of personalized approaches to quantify minimum viable changes in biomarkers that may help reduce the individual risk of developing disease. The aim of this article is to develop a new method, based on counterfactual explanations, to generate personalized recommendations to reduce the one-year risk of type 2 diabetes. Ten routinely collected biomarkers extracted from Electronic Medical Records of 2791 patients at low risk and 2791 patients at high risk of type 2 diabetes were analyzed. Two regions characterizing the two classes of patients were estimated using a Support Vector Data Description classifier. Counterfactual explanations (i.e., minimal changes in input features able to change the risk class) were generated for patients at high risk and evaluated using performance metrics (availability, validity, actionability, similarity, and discriminative power) and a qualitative survey administered to seven expert clinicians. Results showed that, on average, the requested minimum viable changes implied a significant reduction of fasting blood sugar, systolic blood pressure, and triglycerides and a significant increase of high-density lipoprotein in patients at risk of diabetes. A significant reduction in body mass index was also recommended in most of the patients at risk, except in females without hypertension. In general, greater changes were recommended in hypertensive patients compared to non-hypertensive ones. The experts were overall satisfied with the proposed approach although in some cases the proposed recommendations were deemed insufficient to reduce the risk in a clinically meaningful way. Future research will focus on a larger set of biomarkers and different comorbidities, also incorporating clinical guidelines whenever possible. Development of additional mathematical and clinical validation approaches will also be of paramount importance."
https://openalex.org/W4309264261,"Background While vaccination is the most important way to combat the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there may still be a need for early outpatient treatment that is safe, inexpensive, and currently widely available in parts of the world that do not have access to the vaccine. There are in-silico, in-vitro, and in-tissue data suggesting that metformin inhibits the viral life cycle, as well as observational data suggesting that metformin use before infection with SARS-CoV2 is associated with less severe COVID-19. Previous observational analyses from single-center cohorts have been limited by size. Methods Conducted a retrospective cohort analysis in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) for associations between metformin use and COVID-19 outcomes with an active comparator design of prevalent users of therapeutically equivalent diabetes monotherapy: metformin versus dipeptidyl-peptidase-4-inhibitors (DPP4i) and sulfonylureas (SU). This took place in the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) longitudinal U.S. cohort of adults with +SARS-CoV-2 result between January 1 2020 to June 1 2021. Findings included hospitalization or ventilation or mortality from COVID-19. Back pain was assessed as a negative control outcome. Results 6,626 adults with T2DM and +SARS-CoV-2 from 36 sites. Mean age was 60.7 +/- 12.0 years; 48.7% male; 56.7% White, 21.9% Black, 3.5% Asian, and 16.7% Latinx. Mean BMI was 34.1 +/- 7.8kg/m 2 . Overall 14.5% of the sample was hospitalized; 1.5% received mechanical ventilation; and 1.8% died. In adjusted outcomes, compared to DPP4i, metformin had non-significant associations with reduced need for ventilation (RR 0.68, 0.32–1.44), and mortality (RR 0.82, 0.41–1.64). Compared to SU, metformin was associated with a lower risk of ventilation (RR 0.5, 95% CI 0.28–0.98, p = 0.044) and mortality (RR 0.56, 95%CI 0.33–0.97, p = 0.037). There was no difference in unadjusted or adjusted results of the negative control. Conclusions There were clinically significant associations between metformin use and less severe COVID-19 compared to SU, but not compared to DPP4i. New-user studies and randomized trials are needed to assess early outpatient treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis with therapeutics that are safe in adults, children, pregnancy and available worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W4309264272,"Modern society grew rapidly over the last few decades and this led to an alarming increase in air pollutants and a worsening of the human health, especially in relation to the respiratory system. Indeed, chronic respiratory diseases were the third main cause of death in 2017, with over 3 million of deaths. Furthermore, the pollution has considerable consequences both for burden medical expenses and environmental. However, the mechanisms linking pollutants to the onset of these diseases remain unclear. Thus, in this study we addressed this problem through the United Kingdom BioBank database, analyzing 170 genome-wide association studies (103 related to respiratory diseases and 67 related to pollutants). We analyzed the genetic correlations and causal relationships of these traits, leveraging the summary statistics and bioinformatics packages such as Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression and Latent Causal Variable. We obtained 158 significant genetic correlations and subsequently we analyzed them through the Latent Causal Variable analysis, obtaining 20 significant causal relationships. The most significant were between ""Workplace full of chemicals or other fumes: Sometimes"" and “Condition that has ever been diagnosed by a doctor: Asthma” and between “Workplace very dusty: Sometimes” and “Condition that has ever been diagnosed by a doctor: Emphysema or chronic bronchitis”. Finally, we identified single nucleotide polymorphisms independently associated with sveral pollutants to analyze the genes and pathways that could be involved in the onset of the aforementioned respiratory system disorders and that could be useful clinical target. This study highlighted how crucial are the air condition of the working environments and the type of transport used in the onset of respiratory-related morbidity. Based on that, we also suggested some interventions, in order to improve quality life and develop new and eco-friendly society and life style, such as improving indoor air circulation, the use of public transport and urban reforestation."
https://openalex.org/W4309264274,"During major pandemics such as COVID-19, the fear of being infected, uncertain prognoses, and the imposition of restrictions may result in greater odds of emotional and psychological distress. Hence, the present study examines the predictors of psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, and how they differ by gender.Data of 2,756 adults aged 18 years and above from a cross-sectional online survey conducted between July and October 2020 was used for this study. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was carried out. The results were presented as adjusted odds ratio (aOR) with their respective confidence interval (CI).Lower odds of psychological distress were found among males compared to females and among individuals aged 45-64 or 65-84 years compared to those aged 18-44. The odds of psychological distress decreased with a rise in income, with individuals whose annual income was greater than or equal to $100,000 being less likely to experience psychological distress compared to those whose income was less than $20,000. The odds of psychological distress were higher among residents of Ontario compared to residents of Quebec. Similarly, the odds of psychological distress were higher among individuals who reported experiencing COVID-19 symptoms compared to those who did not report any COVID-19 symptoms. The disaggregated results by gender showed that age, province, and self-reported COVID-19 symptoms had significant associations with psychological distress in both males and females, but these effects were more pronounced among females compared to males. In addition, income was negatively associated with psychological distress for both males and females, with this effect being stronger among males.Five exposure variables (gender, age, province, experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, and total annual income in 2019) significantly predicted the likelihood of reporting psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. Clearly, there is an imminent need to provide mental health support services to vulnerable groups. Additionally, interventions and policies aimed at combating psychological distress during pandemics such as COVID-19 should be gender specific."

In Brazil, survival rates vary according to the region and few studies have been conducted on breast cancer survival in less developed areas, such as the Amazon region. The aim of this study was to analyze the five-year survival rate and prognostic factors in women treated for breast cancer in the city of Belém in northern Brazil. A retrospective hospital-based cohort study was conducted (2007-2013). Sociodemographic, clinical/tumor, and treatment variables were obtained from the records at the Ophir Loyola Hospital. Survival analysis involved the Kaplan-Meier statistical method and Cox regression analysis was performed. The significance level was 5% (p <0.05). A total of 1,430 cases were analyzed. Mean survival time was 51.71 (± 17.22) months, with an estimated overall survival of 79.4%. In the multivariate analysis, referral from the public health care system, advanced clinical stage, lymph node involvement and metastasis were associated with worse prognosis and lower survival rate. Radiotherapy and hormone therapy were associated with increased survival. These findings can contribute to the development of regional strategies for early detection of breast cancer, reducing the incidence and mortality rates and increasing survival time."
https://openalex.org/W4309516224,"The arsenical resistance-3 (ACR3) family constitutes the most common pathway that confers high-level resistance to toxic metalloids in various microorganisms and lower plants. Based on the structural model constructed by AlphaFold2, the Acr3 antiporter from Bacillus subtilis (Acr3Bs ) exhibits a typical NhaA structure fold, with two discontinuous helices of transmembrane (TM) segments, TM4 and TM9, interacting with each other and forming an X-shaped structure. As the structural information available for these important arsenite-efflux pumps is limited, we investigated the evolutionary conservation among 300 homolog sequences and identified three conserved motifs in both the discontinuous helices and TM5. Through site-directed mutagenesis, microscale thermophoresis (MST), and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analyses, the identified Motif C in TM9 was found to be a critical element for substrate binding, in which N292 and E295 are involved in substrate coordination, while R118 in TM4 and E322 in TM10 is responsible for structural stabilization. In addition, the highly conserved residues on Motif B of TM5 are potentially key factors in the protonation/deprotonation process. These consensus motifs and residues are essential for metalloid compound translocation of Acr3 antiporters, by framing the core domain and the typical X-shaped of NhaA fold."
https://openalex.org/W4309218645,"The ability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) to persist in its host may enable an evolutionary advantage for drug resistant variants to emerge. A potential strategy to prevent persistence and gain drug efficacy is to directly target the activity of enzymes that are crucial for persistence. We present a method for expedited discovery and structure-based design of lead compounds by targeting the hypoxia-associated enzyme L-alanine dehydrogenase (AlaDH). Biochemical and structural analyses of AlaDH confirmed binding of nucleoside derivatives and showed a site adjacent to the nucleoside binding pocket that can confer specificity to putative inhibitors. Using a combination of dye-ligand affinity chromatography, enzyme kinetics and protein crystallographic studies, we show the development and validation of drug prototypes. Crystal structures of AlaDH-inhibitor complexes with variations at the N6 position of the adenyl-moiety of the inhibitor provide insight into the molecular basis for the specificity of these compounds. We describe a drug-designing pipeline that aims to block Mtb to proliferate upon re-oxygenation by specifically blocking NAD accessibility to AlaDH. The collective approach to drug discovery was further evaluated through in silico analyses providing additional insight into an efficient drug development strategy that can be further assessed with the incorporation of in vivo studies."
https://openalex.org/W4309264025,"Substrate-induced biaxial compressive stress and threading dislocations (TDs) have been recognized to severely impair the performance, stability, and reliability of InGaN/GaN light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for quite some time. In this study, a defect-selective-etched (DSE) porous GaN layer is fabricated employing electro-chemical etching and applied as a buffer layer for the development of InGaN/GaN LEDs with high quantum efficiency. Based on the analysis of photoluminescence and micro-Raman spectra, it has been revealed that the overgrown GaN epilayer on the DSE porous GaN has a relatively low TDs and relaxation of compressive stress in comparison to the conventional GaN epilayer. The remarkable improvement in the internal quantum efficiency of the InGaN/GaN LEDs is directly attributable to the strong radiative recombination in InGaN/GaN multi-quantum-wells caused by stress relaxation and TDs annihilation. Our findings indicate that the use of DSE porous GaN as a buffer layer may be a viable approach for producing crystalline GaN epilayers and high-performance LEDs."
https://openalex.org/W4309264080,"Although phonological deficits are unanimously recognized as one of the key manifestations of developmental dyslexia, a growing body of research has reported impairments in morphological abilities. Our study aimed at casting further light on this domain by investigating the morphological awareness skills of 21 children with dyslexia (mean age 9.10 years old) and 24 children with typical development (mean age 10.3 years old). All children were monolingual speakers of Italian, which is a morphologically rich language characterized by complex inflectional and derivational paradigms. We developed an experimental protocol inspired by Berko’s Wug test and composed of 11 tasks addressing inflectional and derivational processes. Participants were asked to manipulate nonwords of various lexical categories, modeled after the phonotactic structure of Italian, and manipulation involved both word formation and base retrieval. Conditions of the experiments were based on verb conjugation classes differing in frequency, productivity, regularity, and formal transparency. Results confirmed that morphological skills are impaired in dyslexic children, who performed significantly more poorly than their age-matched peers in all tasks. Children with dyslexia were especially challenged by tasks and conditions requiring advanced morphological awareness skills, such as the retrieval of infinitives of infrequent and irregular conjugation classes. The educational and clinical implications of these findings are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4309264144,"Twistocaloric cooling technology is a novel solid elastocaloric refrigeration to be promising alternatives to conventional compression refrigeration. The transient thermal characteristics of the twistocaloric-effect material and its cooling capacity are critical for this technology. A test rig of the continuous torsional refrigeration system (CTRS) using nitinol wires twisted by a stepping motor was built. The experimental tests show that, the surface temperatures increased as the stepping motor twisted the nitinol wires clockwise, and decreased by untwisting them counterclockwise under the stepping motor speed of 40, 45 and 45rpm. The maximum temperature rise and drop relative to the ambient temperature for the two-twisted-nitinol-wire combinations were 7.1 and 2.6°C, higher than those of 1.4 and 0.6°C for the single nitinol wire, respectively. An optimization program based on a heat conduction model was constructed to attain the potential cooling and heating capacities (PHCCs) of the nitinol wires. Then, PHCCs were introduced into the coupled flow and convective heat transfer model to predict the actual cooling and heating capacities of the CTRS. They were discovered to increase as the number of nitinol wires, the stepping motor speed, and the air velocity. The results can be referred in developing a continuous torsional refrigeration prototype."

The correlation between diagnosis result and diagnosis result was examined for patients with mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) of the most abounding as a subject of spirometry, and the possibility of using this method as an alternative to spirometry was examined. Setting This study was conducted in Kanagawa, Japan. Participants Ten normal volunteers and 15 volunteers with mild COPD participated in this study. Outcome measures All images were taken by EXAVISTA (Hitachi, Japan) between October 2019 and February 2020. Continuous fluoroscopic images were taken in 12.5 frames per second for 10–20 s per subject. Images that do not adopt the automatic image processing of the equipment and only carry out the signal correction of each pixel were used for the analysis. Results The mean total dose for all volunteers was 0.2 mGy. There was no major discrepancy in the detection of lung field geometry, and no diagnostic problems were noted by the radiologist and physician. Conclusions Existing X-ray cine imaging was used to extract frequency-tunable imaging. It is possible to identify abnormal regions on the images compared to spirometry, and it does not require maximum effort respiration; therefore, it is possible to perform a stable examination because the patient’s physical condition and the ability of laboratory technicians on the day are less affected. This can also be used as a countermeasure in examining patients with infectious diseases. Trial registration UMIN UMIN000043868 ."
https://openalex.org/W4309264174,"Contusion injuries are common in sport, but our knowledge of the responses to injury primarily come from animal studies and research using eccentric exercise. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a model of contusion injury in human participants and, additionally, investigate and compare physiological responses to four impact loads.Thirty-two males were exposed to a single impact of either 4.2, 5.2, 6.2 or 7.2kg, dropped from 67 cm, on to the vastus lateralis of one leg. Maximum voluntary and electrically induced quadriceps force, and pressure pain threshold were measured, and blood sampling carried out, prior to and 30min, 24, 48 and 72h post-impact. Magnetic resonance imaging was carried out 24h post-impact to quantify oedema.Despite impact force with 7.2kg (1681.4 ± 235.6 N) not being different to 6.2kg (1690.7 ± 117.6 N), 7.2kg resulted in greater volume of oedema, voluntary force loss, pain and elevations in creatine kinase than the other loads. Although electrically induced force changed over time, post-hoc analysis failed to identify any changes. Interleukin-6 and prostaglandin-E2 did not change over time for any of the loads. Significant correlations were found between oedema volume, pressure pain threshold and maximum voluntary contraction force.This is the first experimental study to investigate traumatic loading of skeletal muscle and the subsequent physiological responses associated with contusion injuries in humans. The absence of immediate elevations in creatine kinase and changes in electrically induced force suggest impact, with forces similar to those experienced in contact sport, does not cause significant, direct damage to skeletal muscle. However, the relationship between oedema volume, changes in pressure pain threshold and maximum voluntary contraction force suggests central inhibition plays a role in contusion-related muscle dysfunction."

We recruited 154 native Chinese-speaking university students, with English as their second language, as participants. They were asked to make decisions while playing four simple behavioral games in either Chinese or English language version and to complete a Language History Questionnaire. The results showed that 1) the participants in each language group performed differently in the Prisoner's Dilemma Game and in one condition of the Volunteer's Dilemma Game which involved a relatively high level of uncertainty; and 2) foreign language proficiency, frequency of application and cultural identity triggered by the corresponding foreign language moderated the foreign language effects. This pattern of results is consistent with the Cultural Accommodation Hypothesis and the risk-aversion preference to use one's native language."

Fractional mathematical models offer to model the asset-holding data into a piece of scientific evidence in addition to forecasting their future value. This research focuses on the development of a new fractional mathematical model based on the wealth index quintile (WIQ) data. To accomplish the objective, we used the system of coupled fractional differential equations by defining the fractional term with the Caputo derivative and verified it with the stability tests considering the steady-state solution. A numerical solution of the model was obtained using the Adams-Bashforth-Moulton method. To validate the model, we used real-time data obtained from the household series of surveys in Punjab, Pakistan. Different case studies that elucidate the effect of quintiles on the population are also presented. The accuracy of results between real-world and simulated data was compared using absolute and relative errors. The synchronization between the simulated results and real-time data verifies the formulation of the fractional WIQ model. This fractional model can be utilized to predict the approximation of the asset-holding of the households. Due to its relative nature, the model also provides the opportunity for the researchers to use the WIQs of their respective regions to forecast the households’ socioeconomic conditions."

Transcranial ultrasonography revealed anechoic alteration of midbrain raphe in depression and anxiety disorders, suggesting affection of the central serotonergic system. Here, we assessed midbrain raphe echogenicity in FMS. Methods Sixty-six patients underwent transcranial sonography, of whom 53 were patients with FMS (27 women, 26 men), 13 patients with major depression and physical pain (all women), and 14 healthy controls (11 women, 3 men). Raphe echogenicity was graded visually as normal or hypoechogenic, and quantified by digitized image analysis, each by investigators blinded to the clinical diagnosis. Results Quantitative midbrain raphe echogenicity was lower in patients with FMS compared to healthy controls (p&lt;0.05), but not different from that of patients with depression and accompanying physical pain. Pain and FMS symptom burden did not correlate with midbrain raphe echogenicity as well as the presence and severity of depressive symptoms. Conclusion We found reduced echogenicity of the midbrain raphe area in patients with FMS and in patients with depression and physical pain, independent of the presence or severity of pain, FMS, and depressive symptoms. Further exploration of this sonographic finding is necessary before this objective technique may enter diagnostic algorithms in FMS and depression."
https://openalex.org/W4309264202,"Background and objective There has been growing emphasis on increasing impacts of academic health research by integrating research findings in healthcare. The concept of knowledge translation (KT) has been widely adopted in Canada to guide this work, although lack of recognition in tenure and promotion (T&amp;P) structures have been identified as barrier to researchers undertaking KT. Our objective was to explore how KT is considered in institutional T&amp;P documentation in Canadian academic health sciences. Methods We conducted content analysis of T&amp;P documents acquired from 19 purposively sampled research-intensive or largest regional Canadian institutions in 2020–2021. We coded text for four components of KT (synthesis, dissemination, exchange, application). We identified clusters of related groups of documents interpreted together within the same institution. We summarized manifest KT content with descriptive statistics and identified latent categories related to how KT is considered in T&amp;P documentation. Results We acquired 89 unique documents from 17 institutions that formed 48 document clusters. Most of the 1057 text segments were categorized as dissemination (n = 851, 81%), which was included in 47 document clusters (98%). 15 document clusters (31%) included all four KT categories, while one (2%) did not have any KT categories identified. We identified two latent categories: primarily implicit recognition of KT; and an overall lack of clarity on KT. Conclusions Our analysis of T&amp;P documents from primarily research-intensive Canadian universities showed a lack of formal recognition for a comprehensive approach to KT and emphasis on traditional dissemination. We recommend that institutions explicitly and comprehensively consider KT in T&amp;P and align documentation and procedures to reflect these values."
https://openalex.org/W4309264218,"The consequences of teenage childbearing on the health of mothers and children, and on girls' schooling have been documented in many studies. The objectives of this study are to: 1) examine trends and differentials in teenage motherhood in Cameroon, with a distinction between premarital and marital teenage pregnancy; and 2) investigate trends and differentials in the length of time to marriage following a premarital teenage pregnancy.We use data from five demographic and health surveys (DHS) conducted in Cameroon between 1991 and 2018. Teenage pregnancy, defined as first pregnancy occurring before the age of 20 years, is recode as a trichotomous variable (0 = No teenage pregnancy; 1 = marital teenage pregnancy; 2 = premarital teenage pregnancy). Time from first premarital teenage pregnancy to first marriage is analyzed as a continuous variable.The percentage of women who experienced a marital teenage pregnancy declined from 39.6% to 26.4% between 1991 and 2018. After an initial drop between 1991 and 2004, premarital teenage pregnancy stabilized at about 25%. Women with intermediate levels of schooling were more likely to experience a premarital pregnancy than those with no schooling or higher secondary/tertiary education. The median length of time to first marriage following a premarital teenage pregnancy rose from 16 months in 1991 to 45 months in 2018. Further analysis suggests that marriage may be a more severe barrier to continued schooling than motherhood and that the desire to continue schooling is an important reason for postponing marriage for women who have given birth.Besides strengthening interventions to curb adolescent pregnancy, efforts should be made to support families, communities and schools to help adolescent mothers return to school, prevent future unintended pregnancies, and delay further family formation. Accessibility to youth-friendly FP/RH services should be addressed."

We aimed to evaluate the SToP (See, Treat, Prevent skin infections) trial recruitment approach for Aboriginal families to identify barriers and facilitators and understand the utility of the visual resource used. Methods This qualitative participatory action research used purposive sampling to conduct six semi-structured interviews with staff and five yarning sessions with Aboriginal community members from the nine communities involved in the SToP trial that were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim before thematic analysis. Findings Community members valued the employment of local Aboriginal facilitators who used the flipchart to clearly explain the importance of healthy skin and the rationale for the SToP trial while conducting recruitment. A prolonged process, under-developed administrative systems and stigma of the research topic emerged as barriers. Conclusion Partnering with a local Aboriginal organisation, employing Aboriginal researchers, and utilising flip charts for recruitment was seen by some as successful. Strengthening governance with more planning and support for recordkeeping emerged as future success factors. Implications for public health Our findings validate the importance of partnership for this critical phase of a research project. Recruitment strategies should be co-designed with Aboriginal research partners. Further, recruitment rates for the SToP trial provide a firm foundation for building partnerships between organisations and ensuring Aboriginal perspectives determine recruitment methods."

In this study, the missing-response-incorporated log-signature method achieves roughly 74.8% correct diagnosis, with f1 scores for three diagnostic groups 66% (bipolar disorder), 83% (healthy control) and 75% (borderline personality disorder) respectively. This was superior to the naive model which excluded missing data and advanced models which implemented different imputation approaches, namely, k-nearest neighbours (KNN), probabilistic principal components analysis (PPCA) and random forest-based multiple imputation by chained equations (rfMICE). The log-signature method provided an effective approach to the analysis of prospectively collected mood data where missing data was common and should be considered as an approach in other similar datasets. Because of treating missing responses as a signal, its superiority also highlights that missing data conveys valuable clinical information."
https://openalex.org/W4309264250,"Background In Ethiopia, quality of maternal and newborn care is poor. This situation has persisted, despite the wide implementation of several capacity building-oriented interventions including clinical mentoring for skilled birth attendants that were anticipated to translate in to high–quality maternal and newborn care on each encounter. The effectiveness of mentoring programs is not yet well documented in the research literature. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of a catchment based clinical mentorship in improving the quality of maternal and newborn care in primary level facilities of Tigray, Northern Ethiopia. Methods We conducted a controlled quasi-experimental pre-post study among 19 primary health care facilities, with 10 facilities assigned to the group where the catchment based clinical mentorship program was implemented (intervention group), and 9 facilities to the control group. We assigned the group based on administrative criteria, number of deliveries in each facility, accessibility, and ease of implementation of the intervention. A sample of 1320 women(662 at baseline; 658 at post intervention) and 233 skilled birth attendants(121 at baseline and 112 at end line) were included. We collected data from mothers, skilled birth attendants and facilities. The first round of data collection (baseline) took place two weeks prior the inauguration of the intervention, 05 October to 04 November 2019. The end line data collection occurred from 22 May to 03 July 2020. The primary Outcome was “receipt quality of maternal/newborn care”. We analyzed the data using difference in differences (DiD) and logistic regression with Generalized Estimating Equation. The level of significance of predictors was declared at p-value less than 0.05in the multivariable analysis. Intervention We deployed a team of local clinical mentors working at primary hospitals to provide clinical mentorship, and direct feedback in routine and emergency obstetrical and newborn care to the mentees (all skilled birth attendants performing maternal and newborn health services) functioning in their catchment rural health centers for duration of six months. While visiting a facility, mentors remain at the facility each lasting at least five to seven days per month, over the course of intervention period. Results A significantly higher proportion of women at intervention facilities received quality of care services, compared with women at comparison facilities. (DiD = 18.4%, p&lt;0.001). Moreover, following the implementation of the intervention we detected a difference in the occurrences of maternal complication outcome during delivery and immediately after birth. This was decreased by 4.5%, with significant differences between intervention and comparison sites (DiD = 4.5%, p = 0.013). We also found a favorable difference in occurrences of neonatal obstetric complications, with a decrease of 4.8% in the intervention site and almost no change in the comparison site (DiD = 4.8%, p = 0.002). Among the determinants of quality of care, we found that providers’ job satisfaction (AoR = 2.95, 95%CI: 1.26 to 6.91), and making case presentation at regular basis(AoR = 1.89, 95%CI: 1.05 to 3.39) were significantly associated to improve the quality of care. However, delivery load(AoR = 0.95, 95%CI: 0.93 to 0.98) was negatively associated with quality of care. Conclusions We conclude that the catchment based clinical mentorship intervention is effective to improve quality of care and reduce childbirth complications in northern Ethiopia. This finding further elaborated that incorporating maternal and newborn health catchment based clinical mentorship activities into the existing health system strengthening strategies can catalyze improvement processes to quality practice and health systems. This is seen as a necessary step to achieve the effective quality universal health care required to meet the health-related Sustainable Development Goals. Besides, more attention needs to be given to develop interventions and strategies that directly enhance providers’ job satisfaction and reduce delivery work load."
https://openalex.org/W4309264253,"This study aimed to estimate, using an HIV Recent Infection Testing Algorithm (RITA), the HIV incidence and its associated factors among female sex workers (FSW) in Côte d'Ivoire.A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2016-2017 in Abidjan and San Pedro's region among FSW aged ≥ 18 years. In addition, a sociodemographic questionnaire, HIV screening was carried out by two rapid tests. In the event of a positive result, a dried blood spot sample was taken to determine, using a RITA adapted to the Ivorian context, if it was a recent HIV infection.A total of 1000 FSW were surveyed with a median age of 25 years (interquartile range: 21-29 years). 39 (3.9%) tested positive for HIV. The incidence of HIV was estimated to be 2.3 per 100 person-years, with higher incidence rates among those 24 years old or less (3.0% vs. 1.9%), non-Ivorian FSW (3.2% vs. 1.9%) and those with the lowest education level (4.6% in FSW who never went to school vs. 2.6%). The incidence seemed to be associated with the sex work practice conditions: higher incidence among FSW whose usual price was less than 3.50$ (4.3% vs.1.0%), FSW who had a larger number of clients on the last day of work (6.1% in those with 7 clients or more vs. 1.8%), FSW who reported not always using condoms with their clients (8.5% vs. 1.5%) and FSW who reported agreeing to sex without a condom in exchange for a large sum of money (10.1% vs. 1.2%).This study confirms that FSW remain highly exposed to HIV infection. Exposure to HIV is also clearly associated with certain sex-work factors and the material conditions of sex work. Efforts in the fight against HIV infection must be intensified to reduce new infections among FSW."
https://openalex.org/W4309264255,"Background In Taiwan, physical restraint is commonly used in institutions to protect residents from falling or injury. However, physical restraint should be used cautiously to avoid side effects, such as worse cognition, mobility, depression, and even death. Objectives To identify the rate of physical restraint and the associated risk factors in institutionalized residents in Taiwan. Methods A community-based epidemiological survey was conducted from July 2019 to February 2020 across 266 residential institutions. Among the estimated 6,549 residents being surveyed, a total of 5,752 finished the study. The questionnaires were completed by residents, his/her family or social workers. The cognition tests were conducted by specialists and a multilevel analysis approach was used to identify cognition/disability/medical history/special nursing care/BPSD risk factors for physical restraints. Results Of the 5,752 included institutionalized residents, 30.2% (1,737) had been previously restrained. Older age, lower education level, lower cognitive function, higher dependence, residents with cerebrovascular disease, pulmonary disease, dementia, and intractable epilepsy, all contributed to a higher physical restraint rate, while orthopedic disease and spinal cord injury were associated with a lower physical restraint rate. Furthermore, residents with special nursing care had a higher restraint rate. Residents with most of the behavior and psychological symptoms were also associated with an increased restraint rate. Conclusions We studied the rate of physical restraint and associated risk factors in institutionalized residents in Taiwan. The benefits and risks of physical restraint should be evaluated before application, and adjusted according to different clinical situations."
https://openalex.org/W4309264267,"Introduction Suicide is one of the serious health problems among Indian adolescents. Adolescence helps with the transition of an individual into an adult, so it is important to understand the suicidal behavior of adolescents. Several studies have been carried out in different states in India on the suicidal behavior of adolescents, but there is no review that studied the national patterns, trends, and major risk factors. Therefore, this review aims to study the patterns, trends, and major risk factors of suicidal behavior among Indian adolescents. Methods The study will be conducted as per the Arksey and O’Malley scoping review framework and the Joanna Briggs institute Reviewers’ manual. The Population, Concept and Context strategy (PCC) will ensure the review questions, eligibility criteria and search strategy. The Systematic Review and Meta-analysis: Extension for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR) will be used for the findings of the study of Scoping Review. The literature search will be done using electronic databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, SCOPUS, EMBASE, Psycinfo, Web of Science, Google, and Cochrane library by specific keywords such as “patterns”; “suicide”; “trends”; “risk factors”; “depression”; “anxiety”; “mental health”; “adolescent”; “teenager”; and “youth”;” India” etc. Additional studies will be considered using cross-references. Ethics and dissemination This study does not involve the collection of primary data; there is no requirement of any ethical approval. Strengths and limitations of the study The proposed scoping review is the first study on patterns, trends, and major risk factors of adolescent suicide in India as per the information available on the online platforms. This proposed scoping review will bring together all the previously available data into one place for better study. This evidence-based study will be highly helpful for healthcare professionals and policymakers. This study will be limited to English language and electronically available evidence."
https://openalex.org/W4309264270,"Objective There are few studies on the relationship between the frequency of acupuncture use and subjective health status. Therefore, we investigated this relationship using data of a previously performed cross-sectional survey of patients visiting Japanese acupuncture clinics. Methods This study used data from a cross-sectional survey conducted in 2011 on patients visiting 180 acupuncture clinics nationwide that were run by members of the alumni association of Meiji University of Integrative Medicine Faculty of Acupuncture and Moxibustion, and did not provide treatment other than acupuncture. We calculated the frequency of visits to acupuncture clinics (&lt; 24 times, 24–47 times, 48–95 times, or ≥ 96 times per year) and the Short Form-36 (SF-36) summary scores (physical, mental, role/social) based on the response of the questionnaire conducted at the time of the survey. Multiple linear regression analysis with multiple imputation was performed with three SF-36 summary scores as the dependent variables, and the frequency of visits to acupuncture clinics as the independent variable. Results The questionnaire was distributed to 2,379 outpatients of acupuncture clinics, 1,409 of whom met the criteria and were included in the analysis. More frequent visits to acupuncture clinics were associated with lower scores on all three SF-36 summary scores. Compared to those who visited &lt; 24 times a year, those who visited ≥ 96 times a year had unstandardized regression coefficients (95% confidence interval) of -5.6 (-7.8 to -3.3) for the physical, -2.0 (-3.9 to -0.1) for the mental, and -2.9 (-5.4 to -0.4) for the role/social SF-36. Conclusions Frequent visits to acupuncture clinics were associated with poor subjective health status, especially physical health."
https://openalex.org/W4309264290,"Adhesions formation after surgery for congenital heart defects can complicate follow-up procedures due to bleeding from detached adhesion bands, injury to cardiac structures or large vessels, all of which do prolong operation times. The problem is enhanced by the fact that detached adhesions are predilection sites for new adhesions setting off a downward spiral. 4DryField® PH gel barrier has demonstrated high efficacy in reducing postoperative adhesions in general surgical and gynecological studies. This retrospective controlled study of 22 patients evaluates whether these positive results can be confirmed in pediatric cardiac surgery. Adhesions were scored from photographs of follow-up interventions by an independent cardiac surgeon blinded to group assignment. The publication provides not only score numbers but also original photographs of all sites for better traceability and transparency. In addition, timesaving due to reduced adhesions was evaluated. Results show a significantly reduced adhesion score for the 4DryField® group. Importantly, this resulted in a significantly shorter period between skin incision and start of cardiopulmonary bypass. In addition, timesaving due reduced adhesion formation was evaluated. The use of 4DryField® was safe, although higher doses per kg were used than in adults."
https://openalex.org/W4309512773,"Placental dysfunction is the leading cause of both preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction. This study aimed to characterize endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) in preterm preeclampsia, term preeclampsia, and fetal growth restriction (defined by delivery of a small for gestational age [SGA] infant [<10% birthweight centile]) and examine its regulation in primary syncytiotrophoblast. Placental EPCR mRNA and protein were significantly increased in patients with preterm preeclampsia (<34 weeks gestation) compared to gestation-matched controls (p < .0001). In the plasma, EPCR was also significantly elevated (p = .01) in established preterm preeclampsia while its substrate, protein C (PC) was significantly reduced (p = .0083). Placentas from preterm small for gestational age (SGA) cases, had elevated EPCR mRNA expression (p < .0001) relative to controls. At 36 weeks, no significant changes in plasma EPCR were detected in samples from patients destined to develop preeclampsia or deliver an SGA infant at term. In terms of syncytiotrophoblast, hypoxia significantly increased EPCR mRNA expression (p = .008), but Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF-α) decreased EPCR mRNA. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) had no significant effect on EPCR mRNA expression. When isolated syncytiotrophoblast was treated with metformin under hypoxia (1% O2) or normoxia (8% O2), EPCR mRNA expression was significantly reduced (p = .008) relative to control. In conclusion, EPCR is markedly elevated in the placenta and the circulation of patients with established preterm preeclampsia and placental increases may be associated with hypoxia. Additionally, fetal growth-restricted pregnancies (as defined by the delivery of an SGA infant) also demonstrated elevated placental EPCR."
