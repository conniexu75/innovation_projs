https://openalex.org/W2035000040,"We characterized the mutational landscape of melanoma, the form of skin cancer with the highest mortality rate, by sequencing the exomes of 147 melanomas. Sun-exposed melanomas had markedly more ultraviolet (UV)-like C>T somatic mutations compared to sun-shielded acral, mucosal and uveal melanomas. Among the newly identified cancer genes was PPP6C, encoding a serine/threonine phosphatase, which harbored mutations that clustered in the active site in 12% of sun-exposed melanomas, exclusively in tumors with mutations in BRAF or NRAS. Notably, we identified a recurrent UV-signature, an activating mutation in RAC1 in 9.2% of sun-exposed melanomas. This activating mutation, the third most frequent in our cohort of sun-exposed melanoma after those of BRAF and NRAS, changes Pro29 to serine (RAC1(P29S)) in the highly conserved switch I domain. Crystal structures, and biochemical and functional studies of RAC1(P29S) showed that the alteration releases the conformational restraint conferred by the conserved proline, causes an increased binding of the protein to downstream effectors, and promotes melanocyte proliferation and migration. These findings raise the possibility that pharmacological inhibition of downstream effectors of RAC1 signaling could be of therapeutic benefit."
https://openalex.org/W2062927905,"A structure-guided small-molecule and chemoproteomics approach uncovers a catalytic site inhibitor selective for the jumonji subfamily of H3K27me3 demethylases; the inhibitor decreases lipopolysaccharide-induced proinflammatory cytokine production by human primary macrophages. Jumonji (JMJ) family histone demethylases have become recognized as key regulators of transcription, although the importance of their enzymatic activity - as opposed to their structural role - has been unclear. JMJD3 demethylases are specific for histone H3 trimethylated at Lys27 (H3K27me3) and are involved in the inflammatory response, as well as other physiological functions. Here, a structure-guided small-molecule and chemoproteomics approach is used to discover a catalytic-site inhibitor selective for the H3K27me3-specific JMJ subfamily. The inhibitor reduces lipopolysaccharide-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production in human primary macrophages. This study demonstrates the importance of JMJ demethylase activity and suggests that small-molecule inhibitors of JMJ enzymes could have therapeutic applications. The jumonji (JMJ) family of histone demethylases are Fe2+- and α-ketoglutarate-dependent oxygenases that are essential components of regulatory transcriptional chromatin complexes1,2,3,4. These enzymes demethylate lysine residues in histones in a methylation-state and sequence-specific context5. Considerable effort has been devoted to gaining a mechanistic understanding of the roles of histone lysine demethylases in eukaryotic transcription, genome integrity and epigenetic inheritance2,4,6, as well as in development, physiology and disease3,7. However, because of the absence of any selective inhibitors, the relevance of the demethylase activity of JMJ enzymes in regulating cellular responses remains poorly understood. Here we present a structure-guided small-molecule and chemoproteomics approach to elucidating the functional role of the H3K27me3-specific demethylase subfamily (KDM6 subfamily members JMJD3 and UTX)8. The liganded structures of human and mouse JMJD3 provide novel insight into the specificity determinants for cofactor, substrate and inhibitor recognition by the KDM6 subfamily of demethylases. We exploited these structural features to generate the first small-molecule catalytic site inhibitor that is selective for the H3K27me3-specific JMJ subfamily. We demonstrate that this inhibitor binds in a novel manner and reduces lipopolysaccharide-induced proinflammatory cytokine production by human primary macrophages, a process that depends on both JMJD3 and UTX. Our results resolve the ambiguity associated with the catalytic function of H3K27-specific JMJs in regulating disease-relevant inflammatory responses and provide encouragement for designing small-molecule inhibitors to allow selective pharmacological intervention across the JMJ family."

https://openalex.org/W2082830752,"In this issue, Walter et al. report the results of two clinical trials of a new therapeutic vaccine, IMA901, for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). IMA901 consists of ten tumor-associated peptides identified as naturally presented T cell epitopes in RCC, and the authors show longer overall survival in subjects with immune responses to multiple vaccine peptides and identify serum and cellular biomarkers that may help predict overall survival in future studies of the vaccine. IMA901 is the first therapeutic vaccine for renal cell cancer (RCC) consisting of multiple tumor-associated peptides (TUMAPs) confirmed to be naturally presented in human cancer tissue. We treated a total of 96 human leukocyte antigen A (HLA-A)*02+ subjects with advanced RCC with IMA901 in two consecutive studies. In the phase 1 study, the T cell responses of the patients to multiple TUMAPs were associated with better disease control and lower numbers of prevaccine forkhead box P3 (FOXP3)+ regulatory T (Treg) cells. The randomized phase 2 trial showed that a single dose of cyclophosphamide reduced the number of Treg cells and confirmed that immune responses to multiple TUMAPs were associated with longer overall survival. Furthermore, among six predefined populations of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, two were prognostic for overall survival, and among over 300 serum biomarkers, we identified apolipoprotein A-I (APOA1) and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 17 (CCL17) as being predictive for both immune response to IMA901 and overall survival. A randomized phase 3 study to determine the clinical benefit of treatment with IMA901 is ongoing."
https://openalex.org/W2069860218,"Adult neurogenesis arises from neural stem cells within specialized niches. Neuronal activity and experience, presumably acting on this local niche, regulate multiple stages of adult neurogenesis, from neural progenitor proliferation to new neuron maturation, synaptic integration and survival. It is unknown whether local neuronal circuitry has a direct impact on adult neural stem cells. Here we show that, in the adult mouse hippocampus, nestin-expressing radial glia-like quiescent neural stem cells (RGLs) respond tonically to the neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) by means of γ2-subunit-containing GABAA receptors. Clonal analysis of individual RGLs revealed a rapid exit from quiescence and enhanced symmetrical self-renewal after conditional deletion of γ2. RGLs are in close proximity to terminals expressing 67-kDa glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67) of parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons and respond tonically to GABA released from these neurons. Functionally, optogenetic control of the activity of dentate PV+ interneurons, but not that of somatostatin-expressing or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons, can dictate the RGL choice between quiescence and activation. Furthermore, PV+ interneuron activation restores RGL quiescence after social isolation, an experience that induces RGL activation and symmetrical division. Our study identifies a niche cell–signal–receptor trio and a local circuitry mechanism that control the activation and self-renewal mode of quiescent adult neural stem cells in response to neuronal activity and experience."
https://openalex.org/W2147542927,"Ubiquitin modification is mediated by a large family of specificity determining ubiquitin E3 ligases. To facilitate ubiquitin transfer, RING E3 ligases bind both substrate and a ubiquitin E2 conjugating enzyme linked to ubiquitin via a thioester bond, but the mechanism of transfer has remained elusive. Here we report the crystal structure of the dimeric RING domain of rat RNF4 in complex with E2 (UbcH5A) linked by an isopeptide bond to ubiquitin. While the E2 contacts a single protomer of the RING, ubiquitin is folded back onto the E2 by contacts from both RING protomers. The carboxy-terminal tail of ubiquitin is locked into an active site groove on the E2 by an intricate network of interactions, resulting in changes at the E2 active site. This arrangement is primed for catalysis as it can deprotonate the incoming substrate lysine residue and stabilize the consequent tetrahedral transition-state intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W2058274661,"Relocalization of proteins is a hallmark of the DNA damage response. We use high-throughput microscopic screening of the yeast GFP fusion collection to develop a systems-level view of protein reorganization following drug-induced DNA replication stress. Changes in protein localization and abundance reveal drug-specific patterns of functional enrichments. Classification of proteins by subcellular destination enables the identification of pathways that respond to replication stress. We analysed pairwise combinations of GFP fusions and gene deletion mutants to define and order two previously unknown DNA damage responses. In the first, Cmr1 forms subnuclear foci that are regulated by the histone deacetylase Hos2 and are distinct from the typical Rad52 repair foci. In a second example, we find that the checkpoint kinases Mec1/Tel1 and the translation regulator Asc1 regulate P-body formation. This method identifies response pathways that were not detected in genetic and protein interaction screens, and can be readily applied to any form of chemical or genetic stress to reveal cellular response pathways. Brown and colleagues take a systems-level approach to the DNA damage response by analysing the changes in localization and abundance of proteins in response to replication stress, using a budding yeast GFP fusion library and high-throughput microscopy."
https://openalex.org/W2168153190,"Dendritic arborizations of many neurons are patterned by a process called self-avoidance, in which branches arising from a single neuron repel each other. By minimizing gaps and overlaps within the arborization, self-avoidance facilitates complete coverage of a neuron’s territory by its neurites. Remarkably, some neurons that display self-avoidance interact freely with other neurons of the same subtype, implying that they discriminate self from non-self. Here we demonstrate roles for the clustered protocadherins (Pcdhs) in dendritic self-avoidance and self/non-self discrimination. The Pcdh locus encodes 58 related cadherin-like transmembrane proteins, at least some of which exhibit isoform-specific homophilic adhesion in heterologous cells and are expressed stochastically and combinatorially in single neurons. Deletion of all 22 Pcdh genes in the mouse γ-subcluster (Pcdhg genes) disrupts self-avoidance of dendrites in retinal starburst amacrine cells (SACs) and cerebellar Purkinje cells. Further genetic analysis of SACs showed that Pcdhg proteins act cell-autonomously during development, and that replacement of the 22 Pcdhg proteins with a single isoform restores self-avoidance. Moreover, expression of the same single isoform in all SACs decreases interactions among dendrites of neighbouring SACs (heteroneuronal interactions). These results suggest that homophilic Pcdhg interactions between sibling neurites (isoneuronal interactions) generate a repulsive signal that leads to self-avoidance. In this model, heteroneuronal interactions are normally permitted because dendrites seldom encounter a matched set of Pcdhg proteins unless they emanate from the same soma. In many respects, our results mirror those reported for Dscam1 (Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule) in Drosophila: this complex gene encodes thousands of recognition molecules that exhibit stochastic expression and isoform-specific interactions, and mediate both self-avoidance and self/non-self discrimination. Thus, although insect Dscam and vertebrate Pcdh proteins share no sequence homology, they seem to underlie similar strategies for endowing neurons with distinct molecular identities and patterning their arborizations."
https://openalex.org/W2086773479,"Profibrotic cells that develop upon injury generate permanent scar tissue and impair organ recovery, though their origin and fate are unclear. Here we show that transient expression of ADAM12 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease 12) identifies a distinct proinflammatory subset of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α-positive stromal cells that are activated upon acute injury in the muscle and dermis. By inducible genetic fate mapping, we demonstrate in vivo that injury-induced ADAM12(+) cells are specific progenitors of a major fraction of collagen-overproducing cells generated during scarring, which are progressively eliminated during healing. Genetic ablation of ADAM12(+) cells, or knockdown of ADAM12, is sufficient to limit generation of profibrotic cells and interstitial collagen accumulation. ADAM12(+) cells induced upon injury are developmentally distinct from muscle and skin lineage cells and are derived from fetal ADAM12(+) cells programmed during vascular wall development. Thus, our data identify injury-activated profibrotic progenitors residing in the perivascular space that can be targeted through ADAM12 to limit tissue scarring."
https://openalex.org/W2034060287,"Mice lacking the vesicular glutamate transporter-3 (VGLUT3) are congenitally deaf due to loss of glutamate release at the inner hair cell afferent synapse. Cochlear delivery of VGLUT3 using adeno-associated virus type 1 (AAV1) leads to transgene expression in only inner hair cells (IHCs), despite broader viral uptake. Within 2 weeks of AAV1-VGLUT3 delivery, auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds normalize, along with partial rescue of the startle response. Lastly, we demonstrate partial reversal of the morphologic changes seen within the afferent IHC ribbon synapse. These findings represent a successful restoration of hearing by gene replacement in mice, which is a significant advance toward gene therapy of human deafness."
https://openalex.org/W2051237359,"Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are voltage-independent, amiloride-sensitive channels involved in diverse physiological processes ranging from nociception to taste. Despite the importance of ASICs in physiology, we know little about the mechanism of channel activation. Here we show that psalmotoxin activates non-selective and Na+-selective currents in chicken ASIC1a at pH 7.25 and 5.5, respectively. Crystal structures of ASIC1a–psalmotoxin complexes map the toxin binding site to the extracellular domain and show how toxin binding triggers an expansion of the extracellular vestibule and stabilization of the open channel pore. At pH 7.25 the pore is approximately 10 Å in diameter, whereas at pH 5.5 the pore is largely hydrophobic and elliptical in cross-section with dimensions of approximately 5 by 7 Å, consistent with a barrier mechanism for ion selectivity. These studies define mechanisms for activation of ASICs, illuminate the basis for dynamic ion selectivity and provide the blueprints for new therapeutic agents. Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are voltage-independent ion channels that participate in a broad range of biological processes, including nociception and mechanosensation; here X-ray crystal structures of the complexes of chicken ASIC1a with psalmotoxin, a peptide toxin from tarantula, indicate that toxin binding triggers an expansion of the extracellular vestibule and stabilization of the open channel pore. Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are members of the epithelial sodium channel/degenerin (ENaC/DEG) superfamily of voltage-independent ion channels. ENaCs, including ASICs, participate in a broad range of biological processes, such as nociception, mechanosensation and regulation of sodium-ion homeostasis. Here, Isabelle Baconguis and Eric Gouaux show that psalmotoxin, a peptide toxin from the tarantula, activates nonselective and sodium-selective currents in chicken ASIC1a. X-ray crystal structures of the chicken ASIC1a–psalmotoxin complexes indicate that toxin binding triggers an expansion of the extracellular vestibule and stabilization of the open channel pore. This view of an important type of ion channel in an open conformation is of relevance to the design of open-channel blockers that might have therapeutic promise for the treatment of pain."
https://openalex.org/W2158094776,"Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are degenerative blinding diseases caused by the death of rods and cones, leaving the remainder of the visual system intact but largely unable to respond to light. Here, we show that AAQ, a synthetic small molecule photoswitch, can restore light sensitivity to the retina and behavioral responses in vivo in mouse models of RP, without exogenous gene delivery. Brief application of AAQ bestows prolonged light sensitivity on multiple types of retinal neurons, resulting in synaptically amplified responses and center-surround antagonism in arrays of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Intraocular injection of AAQ restores the pupillary light reflex and locomotory light avoidance behavior in mice lacking retinal photoreceptors, indicating reconstitution of light signaling to brain circuits. AAQ and related photoswitch molecules present a potential drug strategy for restoring retinal function in degenerative blinding diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1998928595,"Rhythmic neural activity is a hallmark of brain function, used ubiquitously to structure neural information. In mammalian olfaction, repetitive sniffing sets the principal rhythm but little is known about its role in sensory coding. Here, we show that mitral and tufted cells, the two main classes of olfactory bulb projection neurons, tightly lock to this rhythm, but to opposing phases of the sniff cycle. This phase shift is established by local inhibition that selectively delays mitral cell activity. Furthermore, while tufted cell phase is unperturbed in response to purely excitatory odorants, mitral cell phase is advanced in a graded, stimulus-dependent manner. Thus, phase separation by inhibition forms the basis for two distinct channels of olfactory processing."
https://openalex.org/W2020587316,"Synaptic inhibition plays a key role in shaping the dynamics of neuronal networks and selecting cell assemblies. Typically, an inhibitory axon contacts a particular dendritic subdomain of its target neuron, where it often makes 10–20 synapses, sometimes on very distal branches. The functional implications of such a connectivity pattern are not well understood. Our experimentally based theoretical study highlights several new and counterintuitive principles for dendritic inhibition. We show that distal “off-path” rather than proximal “on-path” inhibition effectively dampens proximal excitable dendritic “hotspots,” thus powerfully controlling the neuron's output. Additionally, with multiple synaptic contacts, inhibition operates globally, spreading centripetally hundreds of micrometers from the inhibitory synapses. Consequently, inhibition in regions lacking inhibitory synapses may exceed that at the synaptic sites themselves. These results offer new insights into the synergetic effect of dendritic inhibition in controlling dendritic excitability and plasticity and in dynamically molding functional dendritic subdomains and their output.

Noble D. Tsien R.W. Electric Current Flow in Excitable Cells. Clarendon Press, Oxford1975Google Scholar), and (3) inhibition is maximally effective in dampening the excitatory current reaching the soma when inhibition is located “on the path” between the excitatory synapse and the soma, rather than when it is located more distally to the excitation (“off-path” inhibition; Koch et al., 1983Koch C.

An arithmetic rule for spatial summation of excitatory and inhibitory inputs in pyramidal neurons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 21906-21911Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Here we suggest that the spatial pattern of dendritic innervation by inhibitory axons—the domain-specific, targeting distal branches and the multiple synapses per inhibitory axons—is optimized to control local and global dendritic excitability and plasticity processes in the dendritic tree, rather than to directly affect excitatory current flow to the soma and/or axon region. Toward this end, we defined a new measure for the impact of dendritic inhibition—the shunt level (SL)—and solved Rall's cable equation (Rall, 1959Rall W. Branching dendritic trees and motoneuron membrane resistivity.Exp. Neurol. 1959; 1: 491-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) for SL for both single and multiple inhibitory synapses. Using SL, we could systematically characterize functional (as opposed to anatomical) inhibitory dendritic subdomains and showed that an effective control of local dendritic excitability requires a counterintuitive pattern of inhibitory innervation over the dendrites. We verified our theoretical predictions in detailed, experimentally based numerical models of three-dimensional (3D) reconstructed excitable dendritic trees receiving inhibitory synapses. Our study enabled us (1) to propose a functional role for very distal dendritic inhibition; (2) to demonstrate the regional effect of multiple, rather than single, inhibitory synapses in terms of the spread of their collective shunting effect in the dendritic tree; and (3) to suggest an explanation as to why, in both cortex and hippocampus, the total number of inhibitory dendritic synapses per pyramidal cell is smaller (about 20%) than that of excitatory synapses. This study thus provides a new perspective on the biophysical design principles that govern the operation of inhibition in dendrites. When an inhibitory synapse is activated at a dendritic location, i, a local conductance perturbation gi (a shunt) is induced in the dendritic membrane. Depending on the reversal potential of that synapse, either an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) is also generated or no potential change is observed (a “shunting” or “silent” inhibition; Koch and Poggio, 1985Koch C. Poggio T. The synaptic veto mechanism: does it underlying direction and orientation selectivity in the visual cortex.in: Dobson V.G. Rose D. Wiley-Blackwell, Chichester, UK1985: 408-419Google Scholar). Although the membrane shunt due to the activation of the inhibitory synapses at i is highly local, its effect spreads to (i.e., is visible at) other dendritic locations (Rall, 1967Rall W. Distinguishing theoretical synaptic potentials computed for different soma-dendritic distributions of synaptic input.J. Neurophysiol. 1967; 30: 1138-1168PubMed Google Scholar; Koch et al., 1990Koch C. Douglas R. Wehmeier U. Visibility of synaptically induced conductance changes: theory and simulations of anatomically characterized cortical pyramidal cells.J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1728-1744PubMed Google Scholar; Williams, 2004Williams S.R. Spatial compartmentalization and functional impact of conductance in pyramidal neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Indeed, this spatial spread is reflected by a change in input resistance, ΔRd, at location d. We define the shunt level at location d, SLd, as,SLd=ΔRdRd(1) where Rd is the input resistance in location d prior to the activation of gi. SLd is thus the relative drop in Rd at location d due to the activation of single (or multiple) steady conductance changes at arbitrary dendritic locations (see Figures S8 and S9 and related text available online for generalization to the transient case). The value of SLd ranges from 0 (no shunt) to 1 (infinite shunt) and depends on the particular dendritic distribution of gis. For example, SLd = 0.2 implies that the inhibitory synapse reduced the input resistance at location d by 20%, which is also the relative drop in the steady voltage at d due to the inhibition after the injection of steady current at location d. Thus, in order to characterize the effect of the inhibitory shunt in the most general way, it is natural to ask how much increase in excitatory current is required in order to exactly counter effect the shunting inhibition. This is exactly what SL implies. Note that the SL measure is applicable also for assessing the change in input resistance due to excitatory synapses that, like inhibition, exert a local membrane conductance change. The spatial spread of SL can be solved using cable theory for arbitrary passive dendritic trees receiving multiple inhibitory synapses (see Experimental Procedures and Supplemental Information). This solution provides several new and counterintuitive results regarding the overall impact of multiple inhibitory dendritic synapses in dendrites and explains several experimental and modeling results that were not fully understood prior to the present study. We started with a geometrically simple case, whereby a single inhibitory synapse impinges on a dendritic cylinder that is sealed ended at one side and is coupled to an isopotential excitable soma at the other (Figure 1A). The dendritic cylinder is comprised of a hotspot (Magee et al., 1995Magee J.C. Christofi G. Miyakawa H. Christie B. Lasser-Ross N. Johnston D.

We then searched for the strategic placement of the inhibitory synapse that would effectively dampen this local dendritic hotspot. Using numerical simulations for the nonlinear cable model that includes the spiking soma and NMDA synapses depicted in Figure 1A, we found that when the inhibitory conductance change, gi, was placed distally (“off-path”) to the hotspot, the rate of the soma action potentials (black trace in Figure 1B) was reduced more effectively than when the same inhibitory synapse was placed proximally (“on-path”) at the same distance from the hotspot (orange trace in Figure 1B). Indeed, such asymmetry in the impact of proximal versus distal inhibition for dampening local dendritic hotspot was previously observed in vitro (Miles et al., 1996Miles R. Tóth K. Gulyás A.I.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6704-6715Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), but the basis for this counterintuitive result has remained unclear. In order to provide an explanation for this result, we analytically computed the value for SL at the hotspot (h) and thus assessed the impact of inhibition at this location (Figures 1C–1E). In the corresponding passive case, SLh at the hotspot that is due to the inhibitory conductance change gi at location i can be expressed as the product of SL amplitude at location i (SLi) and the attenuation of SL from i to h (SLi,h), i.e.,SLh=SLi×SLi,h.(2) It can be shown (see Equations 4, 5, and 6 in Experimental Procedures) thatSLi,h=Ah,i×Ai,h,(3) where Ah,i is the steady voltage attenuation from h to i (i.e., Vi / Vh for steady current injected at h) and vice versa for Ai,h. Biophysically, Equation 3 can be explained as follows: depolarization originating at h attenuates to i (Ah,i), where it changes the driving force for the inhibitory synapse. Consequently, the inhibitory synapse induces an outward current at i, resulting in a reduction in local depolarization at i that propagates back to site h (Ai,h). Consequently, the local conductance change at the inhibitory synapse is also visible at other locations. The asymmetry of the impact of distal versus proximal inhibition (Figures 1D and 1E) on location h (the hotspot) results from the difference in the model's boundary conditions, namely, sealed-end boundary at the distal end and an isopotential soma at the proximal end. This difference implies that the input resistance and SLi (in cases of a fixed gi) also increase monotonically with distance from the soma (Figure 1C and Equation 6 in Experimental Procedures). Thus, the distal SLi (e.g., black circle at X = +0.4, Figure 1C) is larger than that at the corresponding proximal site (SLi at X = –0.4, orange circle). Additionally, the overall voltage attenuation from the inhibitory synapses to the hotspot and back to the synapses, and thus SLi,h (Equation 3), is shallower for the distal synapses than for the proximal synapses, because the latter is more affected by the somatic current sink (Figure 1D, compare black arrowed dashed line to the orange dashed line). The product of these two effects—the initially larger SLi at the distal synapse and the shallower attenuation of SLi from the distal synapse to the hotspot—implies that SL at the hotspot (SLh) is larger for this synapse (Figure 1E). The later conclusion also holds for transient inhibitory synaptic conductance (Figures S8 and S9). The above analysis considered the impact of the inhibitory conductance change per se, namely, the case of a “silent inhibition,” whereby the reversal potential of the inhibitory synapse, Ei, equals the resting potential, Vrest. Do the results depicted in Figure 1 still hold when Ei is more negative than Vrest (hyperpolarizing inhibition)? Figure 2 shows that the advantage of the “off-path” inhibition over the corresponding “on-path” inhibition in dampening the hotspot is actually enhanced for hyperpolarizing inhibition (compare Figure 1B to Figure 2B). Due to the asymmetry in the boundary conditions, the distal synapse induces a larger hyperpolarization at the hotspot compared to the proximal synapse. Both the larger hyperpolarization and the larger SL at the hotspot generated by the distal synapse are combined to enhance its inhibitory impact on the hotspot (and thus on the soma firing) as compared to the proximal synapse (Figure 2C and see more detailed analysis in Figures S5–S7). These results are also valid for different loci with respect to the hotspot of the inhibitory synapses along the dendritic cable model (Figure S5). Note that the results in Figures 1 and 2 hold for any dendritic region producing inward current (e.g., via an α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid [AMPA] synapse). But the advantage of distal versus proximal inhibition at that region is amplified in the voltage-dependent (nonlinear) case (e.g., NMDA currents as in Figures 1B and 2B or active Ca+2 or Na+ inward currents) because inhibition at the hotspot increases the threshold for the activation of regenerative inward currents (Jadi et al., 2012Jadi M. Polsky J. Schiller J. Mel B.W. Location-dependent effects of inhibition on local spiking in pyramidal neuron dendrites.PLoS Comput Biol. 2012; 8: e1002550Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We also note that the advantage of the “off-path” inhibition over the corresponding “on-path” inhibition in dampening a local dendritic hotspot is augmented in distal thin dendrites because, in such branches, the asymmetry in (distal versus proximal) boundary conditions is even larger than the cylindrical case modeled in Figures 1 and 2 (Rall and Rinzel, 1973Rall W. Rinzel J. Branch input resistance and steady attenuation for input to one branch of a dendritic neuron model.Biophys. J. 1973; 13: 648-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Figure 3 depicts SL in the case of an idealized branched dendritic tree (Rall and Rinzel, 1973Rall W. Rinzel J. Branch input resistance and steady attenuation for input to one branch of a dendritic neuron model.Biophys. J. 1973; 13: 648-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) receiving a single conductance perturbation in a distal dendritic terminal. For comparison, the steady voltage (V, dotted line) attenuation is also shown. V attenuation is steep from the distal (input) branch toward the branch point (P) but is shallow in the direction of the sibling branch S (Figure 3, black arrow) because of the sealed-end boundary condition in this branch (Rall and Rinzel, 1973Rall W. Rinzel J. Branch input resistance and steady attenuation for input to one branch of a dendritic neuron model.Biophys. J. 1973; 13: 648-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar; Golding et al., 2005Golding N.L. Mickus T.J. Katz Y. Kath W.L. Spruston N. Factors mediating powerful voltage attenuation along CA1 pyramidal neuron dendrites.J. Physiol. 2005; 568: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Similarly to V, SL attenuates steeply toward the soma; however, in contrast to V, SL attenuates steeply toward terminal S (blue line). This follows directly from Equation 3, as SL attenuation from P to S depends on the (steep) voltage attenuation from S to P (AS,P). Consequently, the impact of conductance perturbation diminishes rapidly with distance in such thin dendritic branches. Hence, excitatory currents in distal dendrites are electrically “protected” from the inhibitory shunt, unless the inhibitory synapses directly"
https://openalex.org/W2081781085,"Collagen IV comprises the predominant protein network of basement membranes, a specialized extracellular matrix, which underlie epithelia and endothelia. These networks assemble through oligomerization and covalent crosslinking to endow mechanical strength and shape cell behavior through interactions with cell-surface receptors. A recently discovered sulfilimine (S=N) bond between a methionine sulfur and hydroxylysine nitrogen reinforces the collagen IV network. We demonstrate that peroxidasin, an enzyme found in basement membranes, catalyzes formation of the sulfilimine bond. Drosophila peroxidasin mutants have disorganized collagen IV networks and torn visceral muscle basement membranes, pointing to a critical role for the enzyme in tissue biogenesis. Peroxidasin generates hypohalous acids as reaction intermediates, suggesting a paradoxically anabolic role for these usually destructive oxidants. This work highlights sulfilimine bond formation as what is to our knowledge the first known physiologic function for peroxidasin, a role for hypohalous oxidants in tissue biogenesis, and a possible role for peroxidasin in inflammatory diseases."

Using exome sequencing, we identified mutations in the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) synthase gene NMNAT1 encoding nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 1 in eight families with LCA, including the family in which LCA was originally linked to the LCA9 locus. Notably, all individuals with NMNAT1 mutations also have macular colobomas, which are severe degenerative entities of the central retina (fovea) devoid of tissue and photoreceptors. Functional assays of the proteins encoded by the mutant alleles identified in our study showed that the mutations reduce the enzymatic activity of NMNAT1 in NAD biosynthesis and affect protein folding. Of note, recent characterization of the slow Wallerian degeneration (Wld(s)) mouse model, in which prolonged axonal survival after injury is observed, identified NMNAT1 as a neuroprotective protein when ectopically expressed. Our findings identify a new disease mechanism underlying LCA and provide the first link between endogenous NMNAT1 dysfunction and a human nervous system disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2076747046,"Subcellular localization of mRNA enables compartmentalized regulation within large cells. Neurons are the longest known cells; however, so far, evidence is lacking for an essential role of endogenous mRNA localization in axons. Localized upregulation of Importin β1 in lesioned axons coordinates a retrograde injury-signaling complex transported to the neuronal cell body. Here we show that a long 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) directs axonal localization of Importin β1. Conditional targeting of this 3' UTR region in mice causes subcellular loss of Importin β1 mRNA and protein in axons, without affecting cell body levels or nuclear functions in sensory neurons. Strikingly, axonal knockout of Importin β1 attenuates cell body transcriptional responses to nerve injury and delays functional recovery in vivo. Thus, localized translation of Importin β1 mRNA enables separation of cytoplasmic and nuclear transport functions of importins and is required for efficient retrograde signaling in injured axons."

Upon light stimulation, ChR conductance comprises an initial current, I0, which decays to a steady-state current, IS Relaxation from I0 to IS is commonly called inactivation of the conductance, although these kinetics are in fact the result of an early and a late conducting state (O1 and O2) within the ChR photocycle (11Berndt A.

Correspondingly, the off-kinetics comprise several exponentials in principle, but are frequently well described at physiological conditions by one exponential (2Nagel G. Szellas T. Huhn W.

Despite the wide application of ChR, the use of channelrhodopsin-2 (C2) bears several limitations that often prevent sufficient depolarization in optogenetic studies. These are, for example, low expression levels, small unitary conductance, inappropriate kinetics, partial inactivation, and inappropriate ion selectivity. Moreover, simultaneous application of the actuator C2 and fluorescent sensors or separate activation of two cell types with different ChRs is still a challenge. In several approaches ChRs have been tailored for modulated absorption, kinetics, and membrane targeting. Because of the fact that the retinal-binding pocket is conserved in all microbial rhodopsins, we first modified amino acids that are in close contact with the retinal. Replacement of the active site residue Glu-123 by Thr and Ala (ChETA variants) caused faster channel closing, eliminated the voltage sensitivity of the temporal kinetics, and induced a 20-nm bathochromic shift (12Gunaydin L.A.

When expressed in pyramidal neurons, V1 could evoke action potentials with 590-nm light, but widespread use was hampered by low expression in most neuronal cell types. Up until now, experiments in which distinct neuronal populations were separately controlled by dual-color activation are rare but have been demonstrated for the depolarizing C2 in combination with the hyperpolarizing red-absorbing chloride pump halorhodopsin from Natronomonas pharaonis (21Zhang F. Wang L.P. Brauner M. Liewald J.F. Kay K. Watzke N. Wood P.G. Bamberg E. Nagel G. Gottschalk A. Deisseroth K. Multimodal fast optical interrogation of neural circuitry.Nature. 2007; 446: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). Dual-color depolarization experiments require multiple sets of ChR variants with spectrally well separated absorption, large photocurrents, and perhaps even different operational light sensitivities. Operational light sensitivity is defined by the light power necessary to evoke action potentials in neurons and depends on ChR expression, kinetics, ion selectivity, and conductance, as well as on endogenous cellular characteristics. Operational light sensitivity also subsumes the intrinsic light sensitivity of the actuator in charge, which, however, is quite invariant for all microbial rhodopsins. Advanced optogenetics will not only depend on actuator probes, but also on the simultaneous use of reporter proteins as genetically encoded fluorescent calcium indicators or voltage sensors. To meet this challenge, we implemented a systematic molecular engineering approach, integrating helix swapping as global rearrangement of structural elements with subsequent mutagenesis resulting in local conformational changes or alteration of the hydrogen bond network. This allows us to present a broader color palette of ChRs to fill the gap effectively. The best candidates were tested in hippocampal neurons to validate usability in different cell types. The recently described three-dimensional structure of a distinct C1C2 chimera allows to interpret our results on a molecular level (22Kato H.E. Zhang F. Yizhar O. Ramakrishnan C. Nishizawa T.

Chimeric ChR variants were generated from synthetic human codon-adapted cDNAs of ChR-encoding genes named in the algal database Chlamydomonas opsins (COP): COP3, COP4 encoding ChR1 (C1) and CHR2 (C2) (GenBank EU714030.1), and the volvoxopsins VOP3 and VOP4 encoding VChR1 (V1) and VChR2 (V2). DNA fragments were combined by overlap extension PCR as described elsewhere (18Wang H. Sugiyama Y. Hikima T. Sugano E. Tomita H. Takahashi T. Ishizuka T. Yawo H.

Junction sites of chimeras are summarized in supplemental Table 2. Point mutations were generated with QuikChange (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). For oocyte measurements chimera were subcloned into the pGEMHE vector with BamHI/BsiWI. A full-length cRNA was synthesized in vitro from NheI-linearized pGEMHE plasmid using T7 RNA polymerase (mMessage mMachine; LifeTechnologies). HEK293 cells were cultured as described (24Prigge M. Rösler A. Hegemann P. Fast, repetitive light-activation of CaV3.2 using channelrhodopsin 2.Channels. 2010; 4: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and seeded onto coverslips at a concentration of 0.175 × 106 cells·ml−1 and supplemented with 1 μm all-trans-retinal. Transient transfection was performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) 20–28 h before measurements. For selectivity measurements a cell line stably expressing C2-mVenus was used (14Bamann C. Gueta R. Kleinlogel S. Nagel G. Bamberg E. Structural guidance of the photocycle of channelrhodopsin-2 by an interhelical hydrogen bond.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Signals were amplified and digitized using AxoPatch200B or Heka EPC7 and DigiData1440. For recording wavelength dependence a light guide from a Polychrome V unit (TILL Photonics, Planegg, Germany) was mounted at the epi-illumination port of an Olympus IX70 microscope resulting in a final light intensity between 0.05 and 0.23 mW·mm−2 for 380–650 nm on the coverslip. Action spectra as shown in Fig. 1C were recorded at 50% of the maximum light intensity with a bandwidth of 7 nm. The Polychrome V unit was controlled via the Tillvision software (TILL Photonics) synchronized with the pClamp software. For dual excitation a 75-W xenon lamp (Jena Instruments, Jena, Germany) was coupled into the epi-illumination port using a beam splitter (70%/30%). Illumination with the xenon lamp was controlled via a fast shutter (Uniblitz LS3T2, Rochester, NY) controlled by the pClamp software. To record inactivation spectra of slow mutants as shown in supplemental Fig. 1 the intensity of inactivation light was adjusted to an equal number of photons (7·1023 s−1 m−2) for all wavelengths using a software controlled, motorized neutral density filter wheel (Newport, Irvine, CA). For ion selectivity experiments, as shown in Fig. 3E, whole cell patch clamp measurements were performed on a HEK cell line stably expressing C2-mVenus or transiently transfected HEK293 cells. Light activation was achieved using a 75-W xenon arc lamp (Leistungselektronik Jena GmbH, Germany) coupled into the optical path of an Axiovert 35 inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) and regulated by a programmable shutter system. Wavelengths were selected via the following set of filters: BP546 ± 15 nm for C1V1 variants and BP470 ± 20 nm for C2 variants resulting in light intensities of 0.68 mW·mm−2 at 546 ± 15 nm and 1.71 at 470 ± 20 nm in the object plane, respectively. The standard external solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm KCl with 10 HEPES (pHo 7.2). The standard internal solution contained 110 mm NaCl, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, and 10 HEPES (pHi 7.2). Buffer composition for ion selectivity measurements is summarized in supplemental Table 3. All buffers were pH-adjusted with CsOH/N-methyl-d-glucamine as nonconducted base or HCl, and the final osmolarity was brought to 320 mosm (extracellular solutions) or 290 mosm (intracellular solutions) with glucose.FIGURE 3Dual light excitation and ion selectivity for blue and green light-absorbing ChRs.

For ChR activation a xenon lamp (Jena Instruments, Jena, Germany) was used. Light wavelength was selected by a bandpass filter centered at either 405, 470, or 560 nm with a half band width of 30 nm. Light was coupled into a 3-mm plastic light guide also mounted into the epi-illumination path of the microscope and combined with the beam from the polychrome unit via a 70% R/30% T beam splitter. Combined fura-2 and C2 excitation light was guided to the objective via a dualband dichroic mirror (FF493/574, AF-Analysetechnik, Tübingen, Germany). This allowed us to excite fura-2 at 380 nm and monitor fluorescence between 493 and 535 nm. Using the same filter, C2 could be excited at 405, 470, and 560 nm with 0.03, 0.8, and 0.17 mW·mm−2. Fura-2 excitation was reduced to 0.005 mW·mm−2. Fura-2 fluorescence was recorded with a CCD Imago camera (TILL Photonics). For measurements of light-induced opening of CaV3.2 (Fig. 3C) recordings were performed at the following ion composition: 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES. pH was adjusted to 7.2 with N-methyl-d-glucamine/HCl. Fura-2 fluorescence was recorded at an exposure time of 500 ms at 380 nm and a sampling rate of 0.3 Hz. ChRs were excited for 100 ms with the indicated wavelengths. For experiments testing calcium selectivity of different ChR variants (Fig. 3G), cells were measured in the following buffer: 5 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 70 mm CaCl2. Fura-2 fluorescence was recorded at 380 nm with an exposure time of 500 ms and a sampling rate of 0.3 Hz. ChRs were excited with their corresponding wavelength for 10 s. ΔF over F0 was calculated as given in Tian et al. (25Tian L. Hires S.A. Mao T. Huber D. Chiappe M.E. Chalasani S.H. Petreanu L. Akerboom J. McKinney S.A. Schreiter E.R. Bargmann C.I. Jayaraman V.

Xenopus oocytes (Ecocyte Bioscience, Castrop-Rauxel, Germany) were injected with 50 nl of ChR cRNA (0.5–1 μg·μl−1) and incubated in the dark at 18 °C in Ringer's solution for 3–5 days. Two-electrode voltage clamp measurements were performed on Xenopus oocytes using a Turbo Tec-05X (NPI Electronic) and a DigiData 1440A interface. For fast kinetic analysis, cells were stimulated with a tuneable 7-ns laser as described previously (19Zhang F. Prigge M. Beyrière F. Tsunoda S.P. Mattis J. Yizhar O. Hegemann P. Deisseroth K. Red-shifted optogenetic excitation: a tool for fast neural control derived from Volvox carteri.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 631-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Primary cultured hippocampal neurons were prepared from P0 Sprague-Dawley rat pups (Charles River). CA1 and CA3 were isolated, digested with 0.4 mg·ml−1 papain (Worthington), and plated onto glass coverslips precoated with 1:30 Matrigel (BD Biosciences Labware), and grown on coverslips in a 24-well plate at a density of 65,000 cells/well. DNA was expressed in hippocampal pyramidal neurons in vitro. DNA maps and clones are available from the Optogenetics. Transfections were carried out 6–10 days after culturing. For each well, a buffered DNA-CaPO4 mix was prepared and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The mix was added dropwise into each well (from which the growth medium had been removed and replaced with prewarmed minimal essential medium (MEM)), and transfection proceeded for 45–60 min at 37 °C, after which each well was washed, and the original growth medium was returned. Standard electrophysiology recordings were carried out on day 4–6 after transfection. Recordings from individual neurons identified by fluorescent protein expression were obtained in Tyrode medium (150 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm d-glucose, 10 mm HEPES, 0.001 mm tetrodotoxin, pH 7.35 with NaOH) using a standard internal solution (130 mm potassium gluconate, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.3 with KOH) in 3–5-megohm glass pipettes. Rhodopsins were activated by color-filtered light from a xenon lamp source (Sutter Instrument DG-4) that was attenuated by neutral density filters. A minimum of 30-s delay was imposed between stimulus sweeps to minimize confounding effects of inactivation. Cells were imaged 1 day after transfection. Pictures were taken on a confocal Olympus LSM IX81 equipped with a 60 × 1.2 Water UplanSApo objective. 440 and 561 nm LEDs were used for excitation. Fluorescence emission was detected using a spectral PMT detector. Data were analyzed using Tillvision software or pClamp10.1 and further processed by SigmaPlot and Adobe illustrator. Standard errors are given for all results. Initial currents I0 were determined by linear extrapolation to t = 0. IP represents peak current; IS reflects average current after 300 ms of light activation. Action spectra were normalized linearly on the light intensity at each wavelength. To engineer a highly expressing ChR with large photocurrents and absorption red-shifted relative to ChR2 (C2), we started with VChR1 (V1) because this protein exhibited the most red-shifted absorption spectrum of all known ChRs at the beginning of the project (Fig. 1C, dark gray). The spectral broadening is based on the simultaneous occurrence of the alkaline and acidic isoforms at neutral, external pHo (20Kianianmomeni A. Stehfest K. Nematollahi G. Hegemann P. Hallmann A. Channelrhodopsins of Volvox carteri are photochromic proteins that are specifically expressed in somatic cells under control of light, temperature, and the sex inducer.Plant Physiol. 2009; 151: 347-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Because V1 is only poorly targeted to the membrane in mammalian host cells (Fig. 1D), we followed the strategy of Yawo and colleagues by exchanging helices of V1 with homologous helices of related ChRs (18Wang H. Sugiyama Y. Hikima T. Sugano E. Tomita H. Takahashi T. Ishizuka T. Yawo H. Molecular determinants differentiating photocurrent properties of two channelrhodopsins from Chlamydomonas.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 5685-5696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In a first set of experiments we systematically replaced helices of V1 by helices of the highly expressing Volvox VChR2 (V2, Fig. 1A, second row). Exchange of helices H3 and H4, H2 to H4, or H5 and H6 resulted in hybrids with 1.5-fold increased photocurrents in HEK cells and V1-like pHo-dependent absorption spectra still overlapping at neutral pHo. Interestingly, chimeras with H6 and H7 of V2 (V1V2–52 5This annotation means that H1–H5 originate from V1, H6, and H7 from V2. and V1V2–25) expressed well and exhibited large photocurrents, but the spectra were blue-shifted to 470 nm (Fig. 1A). For further improvement, we tested constructs employing N-terminal helices of either V2 or C1 (Fig. 1A, third row). Chimeras V2V1-25, V2V1-43, and V2V1-52 were nonfunctional in HEK cells. V2V1-61 was functional, but without any improvement over V1. Because several C1C2 chimeras had shown good photocurrents in previous studies we constructed chimeras with N-terminal helices of C1 (18Wang H. Sugiyama Y. Hikima T. Sugano E. Tomita H. Takahashi T. Ishizuka T. Yawo H. Molecular determinants differentiating photocurrent properties of two channelrhodopsins from Chlamydomonas.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 5685-5696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). C1V1-52 integrated exceptionally well into the membrane, but photoconductance was still small and in the range of WT V1. Finally, we restricted the C1 part to the first two helices, which still resulted in a variant with excellent membrane integration (supplemental Fig. 1A). This, so called, C1V1-25 variant, was originally prepared as two variants, namely C1V1-25A with the first extracellular loop (ECL1) of C1 and C1V1-25B with ECL1 of V1 (supplemental Fig. 1A). For the sake of simplicity, C1V1-25A will be named C1V1 in the following text. Both constructs were again well targeted to the membrane but the B variant elicited larger photocurrents beyond 2000 pA (see Fig. 3D, dark gray). We have previously reported on aspects of these constructs in the context of neuronal application (15Yizhar O. Fenno L.E. Prigge M. Schneider F. Davidson T.J. O'Shea D.J. Sohal V.S. Goshen I. Finkelstein J. Paz J.T. Stehfest K. Fudim R. Ramakrishnan C. Huguenard J.R. Hegemann P. Deisseroth K. Neocortical excitation/inhibition balance in information processing and social dysfunction.Nature. 2011; 477: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1565) Google Scholar); most of the mutants reported here are based on the original C1V1-25A. For color tuning of C1V1 we replaced Glu-122 for Thr (Glu-83 in C2) in helix H2, a residue that is part of the inner gate and in indirect contact with the chromophore (22Kato H.E. Zhang F. Yizhar O. Ramakrishnan C. Nishizawa T. Hirata K. Ito J. Aita Y. Tsukazaki T. Hayashi S. Hegemann P. Maturana A.D. Ishitani R. Deisseroth K. Nureki O. Crystal structure of the channelrhodopsin light-gated cation channel.Nature. 2012; 482: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). This mutant C1V1-ET exhibited large photocurrents with only moderate inactivation and excellent membrane targeting (Fig. 1D and supplemental Table 1). The spectrum showed an additional red shift to λmax = 545 nm (Fig. 1C, orange). To fill the spectral gap between the current-improved C2 variant C2-ET-TC (E123T,T159C) with peak absorption near 495 nm (23Berndt A. Schoenenberger P. Mattis J. Tye K.M. Deisseroth K. Hegemann P. Oertner T.G. High-efficiency channelrhodopsins for fast neuronal stimulation at low light levels.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 7595-7600Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), and C1V1-ET (E122T) (Fig. 1C, dark blue and orange) we exchanged in C1V1 the polar Ser-220 near the β-ionone ring by an unpolar Gly (see Fig. 2A for position). The resulting C1V1-S220G (C1V1-SG) retained its large photocurrent (Fig. 1B, green), and the spectrum was 13-nm blue-shifted toward 526 nm (Fig. 1C). In Fig. 1, E and F, representative current traces for light pulses and laser flashes are shown for the well expressing color variants. The C1V1-SG and C1V1-ET off-kinetics in flash experiments (τ ≈ 117 and 73 ms) were close to the value for C1V1 (τ ≈ 77 ms). But, recovery of the peak current was fast in the case of C1V1-ET (τ ≈ 2.5 s) and slow in the case of C1V1-SG (τ ≈ 11 s) (Fig. 1G, yellow and green) compared with unmodified C1V1 (τ ≈ 4 s). Except for C2-ET-TC, the recovery of the initial current I0 in C2 and all C1V1 derivatives is slower at more positive voltage (supplemental Fig. 1, D and F). To change the open-state lifetime of the new color variants, we extended the mutational study with a focus on slow-cycling ChRs (Fig. 2A). Replacement of Asp-195 by Ala in C1V1 (D156A in C2) led to a reduction of the current size without any s"

https://openalex.org/W1976947622,"Non cell-autonomous processes are thought to play critical roles in the cellular maintenance of the healthy and diseased brain but mechanistic details remain unclear. We report that the interruption of a non cell-autonomous mode of sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling originating from dopaminergic neurons causes progressive, adult-onset degeneration of dopaminergic, cholinergic, and fast spiking GABAergic neurons of the mesostriatal circuit, imbalance of cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission, and motor deficits reminiscent of Parkinson’s disease. Variable Shh signaling results in graded inhibition of muscarinic autoreceptor- and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)-expression in the striatum. Reciprocally, graded signals that emanate from striatal cholinergic neurons and engage the canonical GDNF receptor Ret inhibit Shh expression in dopaminergic neurons. Thus, we discovered a mechanism for neuronal subtype specific and reciprocal communication that is essential for neurochemical and structural homeostasis in the nigrostriatal circuit. These results provide integrative insights into non cell-autonomous processes likely at play in neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson’s disease."
https://openalex.org/W2017094886,"Neuroimaging (for example, functional magnetic resonance imaging) signals are taken as a uniform proxy for local neural activity. By simultaneously recording electrode and neuroimaging (intrinsic optical imaging) signals in alert, task-engaged macaque visual cortex, we recently observed a large anticipatory trial-related neuroimaging signal that was poorly related to local spiking or field potentials. We used these same techniques to study the interactions of this trial-related signal with stimulus-evoked responses over the full range of stimulus intensities, including total darkness. We found that the two signals could be separated, and added linearly over this full range. The stimulus-evoked component was related linearly to local spiking and, consequently, could be used to obtain precise and reliable estimates of local neural activity. The trial-related signal likely has a distinct neural mechanism, however, and failure to account for it properly could lead to substantial errors when estimating local neural spiking from the neuroimaging signal."

Dysfunction of ion channel gene expression changes cell excitation and ion homeostasis and hence often causes channelopathies in which abnormal ion channel function results in the appearance of clinical signs and symptoms. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is a transcription factor implicated in regulating gene expression. Activation of NF-κB signaling by proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) and interleukin-1 (IL1) translocates the active NF-κB dimer to the nucleus to regulate expression of target genes like inflammatory signaling molecules, receptors, and ion channels. Therefore, TNFα and IL1 play important roles in the emergence of inflammation (13Schaible H.G. von Banchet G.S. Boettger M.K. Bräuer R. Gajda M. Richter F. Hensellek S. Brenn D. Natura G. The role of proinflammatory cytokines in the generation and maintenance of joint pain.Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2010; 1193: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Clinical studies have revealed that levels of TNFα and IL1 and of IL6 and IL8 induced by these cytokines are higher in inflammatory disorders that include rheumatoid arthritis (14Fernandes J.C. Martel-Pelletier J. Pelletier J.P. The role of cytokines in osteoarthritis pathophysiology.Biorheology. 2002; 39: 237-246PubMed Google Scholar). TNFα is known to cause changes in expression of several TRPs such as TRPC1 (15Paria B.C. Malik A.B. Kwiatek A.M. Rahman A. May M.J. Ghosh S. Tiruppathi C.

Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are transcription factors that mediate adaptive responses to hypoxia but are also activated by inflammation (21Hellwig-Bürgel T. Rutkowski K. Metzen E. Fandrey J.

NF-κB links innate immunity to the hypoxic response through transcriptional regulation of HIF-1α.Nature. 2008; 453: 807-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). HIFs bind to a consensus hypoxia response element (HRE) of target genes and regulate the gene transcription. In chronic hypoxia of rat pulmonary arterial cells, expression of TRPC1 and TRPC6 was increased by HIF1α, but the involvement of HRE was not determined (23Wang J. Weigand L. Lu W. Sylvester J.T. Semenza G.L. Shimoda L.A. Hypoxia inducible factor 1 mediates hypoxia-induced TRPC expression and elevated intracellular Ca2+ in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells.Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1528-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Because the human TRPA1 promoter has at least six putative NF-κB binding sites and 10 core HREs, we examined the role of proinflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL1α in the induction of TRPA1 in human fibroblast-like synoviocytes (synoviocytes) and the consequences due to involvement of NF-κB and HIF1α. Synoviocytes are a potential cellular participant in the development of joint arthritis and contribute to the local production of inflammatory signaling molecules and proteolytic enzymes that degrade extracellular matrix. We propose that transcriptional induction of TRPA1 by HIF1α might represent one of the mechanisms controlling cytokine release in inflammation. Human synoviocytes were purchased from Cell Applications and cultured in synoviocyte growth medium that contained 10% growth supplement, 100 units/ml penicillin G (Meiji Seika), and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Meiji Seika) as described previously (24Itoh Y. Hatano N. Hayashi H. Onozaki K. Miyazawa K. Muraki K. An environmental sensor, TRPV4 is a novel regulator of intracellular Ca2+ in human synoviocytes.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2009; 297: C1082-C1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The cultured cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. After synoviocytes had reached 70–80% confluence, cells were reseeded once after 10 days until nine passages had occurred. During this time, cells that had growth with a doubling time of 6–8 days were comprised of a homogenous population, and induction of TRPA1 by cytokines was not affected. For experimental use, reseeded cells were cultured for 16 days and then exposed to TNFα and IL1α. Human embryonic kidney cell lines (HEK cells) were obtained from the Health Science Research Resources Bank and maintained in Dulbecco's modified minimum essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS; JRS Biosciences), 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Partially confluent HEK cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1/neo(+)-human TRPA1 plasmid DNA, pcDNA3.1/hyg(+)-human HIF1α plasmid DNA, pcDNA3.1/hyg(+)-human HIF2α plasmid DNA, and pCMV-human p65 plasmid DNA with Lipofectamine 2000. Synoviocytes were transfected with pCMV-human p65 plasmid DNA and pcDNA3.1/hyg(+)-human HIF1α plasmid DNA with Lipofectamine 2000. All experiments were performed within 48 h of transfection. RT-PCR amplification for TRPA1 expression was performed as described previously (24Itoh Y. Hatano N. Hayashi H. Onozaki K. Miyazawa K. Muraki K. An environmental sensor, TRPV4 is a novel regulator of intracellular Ca2+ in human synoviocytes.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2009; 297: C1082-C1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The thermal cycler program used for PCR amplification included a 0.5-min denaturation step at 94 °C, a 0.5-min annealing step at 55 °C, and a 0.5-min primer extension step at 72 °C for 33 cycles using an ABI 2720 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems). The amplified products were separated on 1.5% agarose gels in Tris acetate/EDTA buffer, visualized with 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide, and assessed on an FAS III system (Toyobo). As a control signal, β-actin expression was analyzed. Oligonucleotide sequences of primers specific for human TRPA1 and β-actin (sense and antisense, 5′ to 3′) are shown in the supplemental Methods. Real time quantitative PCR was performed with the use of SYBR Green chemistry on a Thermal Cycler Dice Real Time System (Takara Bio, Inc.) as described previously (24Itoh Y. Hatano N. Hayashi H. Onozaki K. Miyazawa K. Muraki K. An environmental sensor, TRPV4 is a novel regulator of intracellular Ca2+ in human synoviocytes.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2009; 297: C1082-C1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Transcriptional quantification of gene products was normalized to that of β-actin. Each cDNA sample was tested in triplicate. The program used for quantitative PCR amplification included a 30-s activation of Ex TaqTM DNA polymerase at 95 °C, a 15-s denaturation step at 95 °C, a 60-s annealing and extension step at 60 °C (for 45 cycles), and a dissociation step (15 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 15 s at 95 °C). Oligonucleotide sequences of primers specific for human TRPA1, HIF1α, HIF2α, IL6, IL8, and β-actin (sense and antisense, 5′ to 3′) are shown in the supplemental Methods. To isolate TRPA1 protein, synoviocytes and HEK cells were lysed in 50 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors). The cell lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min with vortexing every 5 min and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. For isolation of HIF1α and HIF2α protein, cells were lysed with sonication (5 s, five times) in 50 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 250 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 40 mm Na3VO4, 0.4 mm NaF, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors). The lysates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Each lysate (40 μg of protein) was separated on an 8% polyacrylamide gel, and proteins were then transferred to a PVDF membrane and blocked for 2 h in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 5% skim milk and 0.1% Tween 20. The PVDF membrane was then exposed to the first antibody (TRPA1 (host, goat; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), 1:1,000 dilution; HIF1α (host, rabbit; Novus Biological), 1:2,000 dilution; or HIF2α (host, rabbit; Novus Biological), 1:2,000 dilution) overnight at 4 °C. The blot was washed three times with washing buffer (TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) and then secondary antibody (IgG-HRP; 1:10,000 dilution) was added to the PVDF membrane. Blots were washed again and detection reagents (Millipore) were added to generate a chemiluminescence product. To determine the relative quantities of TRPA1, HIF1α, and HIF2α protein against β-actin protein in each sample, the PVDF membrane was exposed to β-actin monoclonal antibody (host, mouse; 1:2,000 dilution). Gels were scanned on a densitometer, and signals specific for TRPA1, HIF1α, and HIF2α against the β-actin band in the same lane on the gel were analyzed. Synoviocytes treated with and without TNFα were fixed immediately with 0.37% formaldehyde for 10 min as described previously (25Cheong A. Bingham A.J. Li J. Kumar B. Sukumar P. Munsch C. Buckley N.J. Neylon C.B. Porter K.E. Beech D.J. Wood I.C. Downregulated REST transcription factor is a switch enabling critical potassium channel expression and cell proliferation.Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 45-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Chromatin was isolated and sheared by sonication to a median length of 600-bp DNA fragments, and then aliquots of chromatin were incubated with anti-HIF1α antibody (Novus Biologicals), anti-p65 antibody (Millipore), and normal rabbit IgG (Millipore). Immune complexes were precipitated using Dynabeads protein G (Invitrogen). After decross-linking, proteinase digestion, and purification, the precipitated DNA fragments were analyzed using quantitative PCR with a specific primer to detect binding of HIF1α or p65 to each fragment. PCR primers for detection of sites recognized by probe1–4 are shown in the supplemental Methods. TRPA1 reporter plasmids and pCMV-βgal plasmid (for normalization of transfection efficiency) were transiently transfected into HEK cells with HIF1α and p300 (a cofactor of HIF) and p65 expression plasmids using a calcium phosphate DNA co-precipitation method (26Itoh Y. Hayashi H. Miyazawa K. Kojima S. Akahoshi T. Onozaki K. 17β-Estradiol induces IL-1α gene expression in rheumatoid fibroblast-like synovial cells through estrogen receptor α (ERα) and augmentation of transcriptional activity of Sp1 by dissociating histone deacetylase 2 from ERα.J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 3059-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For assay of HIF1α-dependent promoter activity, cells were also exposed to desferroxamine (DFO) (300 μm). After 15 h of transfection, cells were incubated for 24 h and harvested. Luciferase assays were performed with the luciferase reporter gene assay kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HEK cells exposed to DFO had lower basal transcriptional activities (40–60% of the empty vector without DFO) in all reporter genes including empty vector only. ELISA for human IL6 and IL8 was performed as described previously (24Itoh Y. Hatano N. Hayashi H. Onozaki K. Miyazawa K. Muraki K. An environmental sensor, TRPV4 is a novel regulator of intracellular Ca2+ in human synoviocytes.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2009; 297: C1082-C1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Each cell in 24-well plates was treated with and without 100 units of IL1α, 10 μm mustard oil (MO), and 10 μm MO plus 30 μm HC030031 (HC) for 24 h. As control groups, the solvent (DMSO) without MO and HC was applied to cells with IL1α. IL6 or IL8 in all samples was monitored in triplicate according to the manufacturer's protocol (Human IL-6 ELISA kit and Human IL-8 ELISA kit, R&D Systems). The change in intracellular Ca2+ concentration was monitored with Fura2 as described previously (27Muraki K. Iwata Y. Katanosaka Y. Ito T. Ohya S. Shigekawa M. Imaizumi Y. TRPV2 is a component of osmotically sensitive cation channels in murine aortic myocytes.Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 829-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Cells were loaded with 10 μm Fura2 acetoxymethyl ester (Fura2, Dojindo) in standard HEPES solution for 30 min at room temperature. Fura2 fluorescence signals were measured at 0.2 Hz using an Argus/HisCa imaging system (Hamamatsu Photonics) driven by Imagework Bench v6.0 (INDEC BioSystems Inc.), and the fluorescence ratio (intracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+i)(F340/F380)) was calculated. Standard HEPES solution of the following composition was used: 137 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 14 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH). For constructing a concentration-response curve, summarized data were fitted to a standard Hill equation. All experiments were performed at 25 ± 1 °C. Patch clamp experiments were performed as described previously (27Muraki K. Iwata Y. Katanosaka Y. Ito T. Ohya S. Shigekawa M. Imaizumi Y. TRPV2 is a component of osmotically sensitive cation channels in murine aortic myocytes.Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 829-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The resistance of electrodes was 3–5 megaohms when filled with pipette solution (110 mm cesium aspartate, 30 mm CsCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA, and 2 mm ATP-Na2 (pH 7.2 by CsOH)). Data acquisition and analysis of whole-cell currents were carried out using WinWCP3.7 developed by Dr. Dempster (University of Strathclyde, UK). Statistical significance between two and among multiple groups was examined using paired or unpaired Student's t test and Dunnett's or Tukey's (see Fig. 7, A and B) multiple comparison test, respectively. We first evaluated expression of TRPA1 mRNA transcripts in synoviocytes that were treated with and without TNFα (Fig. 1A). The TRPA1 mRNA transcripts were detected only in synoviocytes with TNFα. TRPA1 protein (∼100 kDa) was expressed in synoviocytes with TNFα (Fig. 1B), whereas it was not expressed in those without TNFα (labeled CT for control). Because TRPA1 is permeable to cations including Ca2+, we next confirmed the functional induction of TRPA1 in synoviocytes with TNFα by measuring Ca2+i (Fig. 1C). The TRPA1 agonist MO elicited Ca2+i responses in synoviocytes with TNFα in a concentration-dependent manner that were comparable with those in HEK cells transfected with recombinant TRPA1 (HEK-TRPA1 cells). Next, characteristics of the MO-evoked response were pharmacologically and electrophysiologically profiled. When exposed to other TRPA1 agonists, 15-deoxy-Δ-prostaglandin and ZnCl2, synoviocytes with TNFα had substantial Ca2+i responses (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). Moreover, TRPA1 blockers HC and ruthenium red abolished the MO-induced Ca2+i responses of synoviocytes with TNFα (supplemental Fig. S1, C and D). Under whole-cell clamp conditions, application of MO to synoviocytes with TNFα elicited cation channel currents comparable with those in HEK-TRPA1 cells (Fig. 1, D and E). The concentration- and time-dependent change in expression of TRPA1 mRNA in synoviocytes with TNFα was further examined with real time quantitative PCR. TRPA1 expression was detected in synoviocytes with 1 unit of TNFα (85 ± 17-fold of the control) and increased in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1F); the expression was substantial after treatment with TNFα for 2 h (24 ± 5-fold) and maximal in those treated for 12 h (235 ± 75-fold; Fig. 1G). The protein expression of TRPA1 was not clear in synoviocytes with TNFα for 2 h but was evident at 6 h and substantial at 12 h (Fig. 1H). When exposed to TNFα for longer than 24 h, synoviocytes retained high expression of TRPA1 mRNA (supplemental Fig. S1E). TNFα activates an NF-κB signaling cascade that mainly regulates transcriptional gene expression. Because IL1 also activates the cascade, we examined the effects of IL1α, an agonist of IL1 receptor, on induction of TRPA1. Application of IL1α also increased the expression of TRPA1 mRNA in a concentration- (Fig. 2A) and a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). Moreover, MO elicited Ca2+i responses in synoviocytes with IL1α (Fig. 2C) that both HC and ruthenium red inhibited (supplemental Fig. S1, C and D). Experiments using NF-κB inhibitors (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate and BMS) pharmacologically showed the involvement of NF-κB in the induction of TRPA1 by TNFα and IL1α: pretreatment of synoviocytes with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate or BMS abolished the induction (Fig. 2, D and E). To further test the involvement of NF-κB signaling, we transfected synoviocytes with p65, which encodes RelA, an active component of NF-κB. These transfectants had an increase in expression of TRPA1 mRNA (Fig. 2F) and Ca2+i responses to MO (Fig. 2G) even without stimulation with TNFα and IL1α. Therefore, the data suggest that NF-κB signaling activated by TNFα and IL1α is predominantly involved in the induction of TRPA1. Treatment with inflammatory cytokines stimulates HIFs via NF-κB signaling in a transcriptional and/or a post-transcriptional manner (21Hellwig-Bürgel T. Rutkowski K. Metzen E. Fandrey J. Jelkmann W.

NF-κB links innate immunity to the hypoxic response through transcriptional regulation of HIF-1α.Nature. 2008; 453: 807-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). To test involvement of HIFs in inflammatory induction of TRPA1, we next examined activity of HIFs in inflammation and HIF-dependent induction of TRPA1. Treatment of synoviocytes with TNFα for 2–24 h did not stably increase the expression of HIF1α at the mRNA level (Fig. 3A), whereas the cells treated with IL1α for 12 and 24 h showed slightly increased expression (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the increase in protein expression of HIF1α was substantial in synoviocytes at 6 h after these treatments; however, the increase disappeared at 24 h (Fig. 3, C–E). On the other hand, neither TNFα nor IL1α consistently increased expression of HIF2α in synoviocytes at the mRNA and protein levels (supplemental Fig. S2, A–C). Next, activation of endogenous HIF by a hypoxia mimetic (DFO) increased the expression of TRPA1 mRNA in a concentration-dependent manner and induced Ca2+i responses to MO (Fig. 4, A and B). When synoviocytes were pretreated with HIF inhibitors (Echi and YC-1), the induction of TRPA1 mRNA by TNFα was inhibited (Fig. 4C). In addition, transfection of synoviocytes with recombinant human HIF1α induced the expression of TRPA1 mRNA (Fig. 4D) and Ca2+i responses to MO (Fig. 4E) without stimulation with TNFα and IL1α. Taken together, NF-κB signaling and downstream activation of HIF1α are critical for induction of TRPA1 by TNFα and IL1α, suggesting the hypothesis that HIF1α is a transcription factor of TRPA1 gene.FIGURE 4Involvement of HIF1α in inflammatory induction of TRPA1.

https://openalex.org/W2125568248,"This study describes how interactions between DOCK7 and TACC3 are key to the switch from proliferation to differentiation in developing radial glial progenitor cells (RGCs). DOCK7 exerts its effects via interactions with the centrosome-associated protein TACC3, and these interactions are likely to modulate the RGCs' apically directed interkinetic nuclear migration. Neurogenesis in the developing neocortex relies on the ability of radial glial progenitor cells (RGCs) to switch from proliferative to differentiative neuron-generating divisions, but the molecular mechanisms that control this switch in a correct temporal manner are not well understood. Here, we show that DOCK7, a member of the DOCK180 family of proteins, regulates RGC proliferation versus differentiation. Silencing of DOCK7 in RGCs of developing mouse embryos impedes neuronal differentiation and maintains cells as cycling progenitors. In contrast, DOCK7 overexpression promotes RGC differentiation to basal progenitors and neurons. We further present evidence that DOCK7 influences neurogenesis by controlling apically directed interkinetic nuclear migration of RGCs. DOCK7 exerts its effects by antagonizing the microtubule growth-promoting function of the centrosome-associated protein TACC3. Thus, DOCK7 interaction with TACC3 controls interkinetic nuclear migration and the genesis of neurons from RGCs during cortical development."
https://openalex.org/W2023874344,"Mycobacteria use the dedicated type VII protein secretion systems ESX-1 and ESX-5 to secrete virulence factors across their highly hydrophobic cell envelope. The substrates of these systems include the large mycobacterial PE and PPE protein families, which are named after their characteristic Pro-Glu and Pro-Pro-Glu motifs. Pathogenic mycobacteria secrete large numbers of PE/PPE proteins via the major export pathway, ESX-5. In addition, a few PE/PPE proteins have been shown to be exported by ESX-1. It is not known how ESX-1 and ESX-5 recognize their cognate PE/PPE substrates. In this work, we investigated the function of the cytosolic protein EspG5, which is essential for ESX-5-mediated secretion in Mycobacterium marinum, but for which the role in secretion is not known. By performing protein co-purifications, we show that EspG5 interacts with several PPE proteins and a PE/PPE complex that is secreted by ESX-5, but not with the unrelated ESX-5 substrate EsxN or with PE/PPE proteins secreted by ESX-1. Conversely, the ESX-1 paralogue EspG1 interacted with a PE/PPE couple secreted by ESX-1, but not with PE/PPE substrates of ESX-5. Furthermore, structural analysis of the complex formed by EspG5 and PE/PPE indicates that these proteins interact in a 1:1:1 ratio. In conclusion, our study shows that EspG5 and EspG1 interact specifically with PE/PPE proteins that are secreted via their own ESX systems and suggests that EspG proteins are specific chaperones for the type VII pathway. Mycobacteria use the dedicated type VII protein secretion systems ESX-1 and ESX-5 to secrete virulence factors across their highly hydrophobic cell envelope. The substrates of these systems include the large mycobacterial PE and PPE protein families, which are named after their characteristic Pro-Glu and Pro-Pro-Glu motifs. Pathogenic mycobacteria secrete large numbers of PE/PPE proteins via the major export pathway, ESX-5. In addition, a few PE/PPE proteins have been shown to be exported by ESX-1. It is not known how ESX-1 and ESX-5 recognize their cognate PE/PPE substrates. In this work, we investigated the function of the cytosolic protein EspG5, which is essential for ESX-5-mediated secretion in Mycobacterium marinum, but for which the role in secretion is not known. By performing protein co-purifications, we show that EspG5 interacts with several PPE proteins and a PE/PPE complex that is secreted by ESX-5, but not with the unrelated ESX-5 substrate EsxN or with PE/PPE proteins secreted by ESX-1. Conversely, the ESX-1 paralogue EspG1 interacted with a PE/PPE couple secreted by ESX-1, but not with PE/PPE substrates of ESX-5. Furthermore, structural analysis of the complex formed by EspG5 and PE/PPE indicates that these proteins interact in a 1:1:1 ratio. In conclusion, our study shows that EspG5 and EspG1 interact specifically with PE/PPE proteins that are secreted via their own ESX systems and suggests that EspG proteins are specific chaperones for the type VII pathway. Bacterial pathogens use dedicated protein secretion systems to export virulence factors that interfere with cellular processes of the host to ensure bacterial survival, multiplication, and spread (1Finlay B.B. Falkow S. Common themes in microbial pathogenicity revisited.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 136-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). Also, pathogenic mycobacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causal agent of tuberculosis, secrete proteinaceous virulence factors. These bacteria are surrounded by a unique diderm cell envelope that requires a specialized secretion pathway, known as the ESX or type VII secretion pathway, to facilitate protein export (2Abdallah A.M. Gey van Pittius N.C. Champion P.A. Cox J. Luirink J. Vandenbroucke-Grauls C.M. Appelmelk B.J. Bitter W. Type VII secretion: mycobacteria show the way.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 5: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). M. tuberculosis contains five ESX clusters, designated ESX-1 to ESX-5. The most well studied locus, ESX-1, is crucial for the virulence of M. tuberculosis and secretes two virulence factors of the WXG100 protein family, i.e. EsxA and EsxB. In addition, ESX-1 secretes a number of proteins referred to as ESX-1 secretion-associated proteins (Esp) 3The abbreviations used are: EspESX-1 secretion-associated protein(s)CBBCoomassie Brilliant BlueeccESX-conserved componentsMS/MStandem MSNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidRBSribosomal binding site.

Pe/ppe genes, which are named after conserved Pro-Glu and Pro-Pro-Glu motifs near the N termini of their gene products, are present in high numbers in the genomes of several mycobacterial pathogens and are thought to contribute to mycobacterial virulence (10Sampson S.L. Mycobacterial PE/PPE proteins at the host-pathogen interface.Clin. Dev. Immunol. 2011; 2011: 497203Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Based on the presence of specific motifs in their C termini, the PE and PPE proteins are further divided into subfamilies, of which the PE_PGRS subfamily is the largest (11Gey van Pittius N.C.

Importantly, all ESX substrates identified to date lack classical signal peptides, and the mechanism of substrate targeting is not yet fully understood (6DiGiuseppe Champion P.A. Champion M.M.

Recently, we demonstrated that the C termini of PE proteins and several other ESX-1 substrates share a conserved YXXXD/E motif that is required for secretion. Intriguingly, this signal does not discriminate among the various ESX pathways (9Daleke M.H. Ummels R. Bawono P. Heringa J. Vandenbroucke-Grauls C.M. Luirink J. Bitter W.

ESX-1 secretion-associated protein(s) Coomassie Brilliant Blue ESX-conserved components tandem MS nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid ribosomal binding site. The ESX clusters contain a number of conserved genes, termed ESX conserved components (ecc), which are required for secretion (8Bitter W. Houben E.N. Bottai D. Brodin P. Brown E.J. Cox J.S.

In addition, there are components that are only present in one or a few ESX systems, one of which is EspG. EspG was originally thought to be specific for ESX-1, -2, and ESX-3, but a homologue with low similarity is also present in the ESX-5 locus. Disruption of this homologue in Mycobacterium marinum (mmar_2676) blocked secretion via ESX-5 (13Abdallah A.M. Verboom T. Weerdenburg E.M. Gey van Pittius N.C. Mahasha P.W. Jiménez C. Parra M.

Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), BL21(DE3) pLysS, DH5α, TOP10F′, and XL10-Gold were grown at 37 °C in LB medium with shaking at 200 rpm, or on LB agar. When required, ampicillin was used at a concentration of 100 μg/ml, chloramphenicol at 30 μg/ml, kanamycin at 25 μg/ml, and hygromycin at 50 μg/ml for mycobacteria and 100 μg/ml for E. coli. PCRs were carried out with the Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (Finnzymes) using primers listed in supplemental Table S1. The mmar_2672-2676 operon was amplified by PCR from M. marinum E11 genomic DNA using 5′ primer AbMmMiddle-H5-F and 3′ primer 1794-His-SpeI-R, which contains a His6-encoding sequence and a SpeI restriction site. This fragment was cloned in the integrative pUC-Int-cat vector (13Abdallah A.M. Verboom T. Weerdenburg E.M. Gey van Pittius N.C. Mahasha P.W. Jiménez C. Parra M. Cadieux N. Brennan M.J.

Mmar_1460 (ppe33) was amplified from E11 DNA using primers PPE1460-XbaI-F and PPE1460-HindIII-HA-R, which contained a 3′ HA epitope. After digestion with XbaI, this fragment was ligated into the E. coli-mycobacterial shuttle vector pSMT3::LipYtub (14Daleke M.H. Cascioferro A. de Punder K. Ummels R. Abdallah A.M. van der Wel N.

For expression in E. coli, espG5 and espG1 were cloned both with and without C-terminal His tag under control of the tet promoter in the pASK-IBA3c vector (IBA Gmbh). The genes were amplified using a 5′ primer containing an E. coli ribosomal binding site (RBS) and XbaI digestion site (1794-RBS-XbaI-F or EspG1-RBS-XbaI-F) and a 3′ primer with HindIII digestion site (1794-R, 1794His-HindIII-R, or EspG1His-HindIII-R). After digestion, the fragments were ligated into XbaI and HindIII-digested pASK-IBA3c, resulting in pIBA::EspG5, pIBA::EspG5-His, pIBA::EspG1-His. For expression of PE25 and C-terminally His6-tagged PPE41 in E. coli a previously described construct was used in which the rv2431c and rv2430c genes were each placed behind a RBS, i.e. pET29b(+)::Rv2430-31c-His (19Strong M. Sawaya M.R. Wang S. Phillips M. Cascio D. Eisenberg D. Toward the structural genomics of complexes: crystal structure of a PE/PPE protein complex from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Proc. Natl. Acad.

To create an unlabeled version of PPE41, the rv2430c gene was amplified with primers pET41_F and pET41noHis_R containing NcoI and HindIII sites from pSMT3::PE25-HA-PPE41 (9Daleke M.H. Ummels R. Bawono P. Heringa J. Vandenbroucke-Grauls C.M. Luirink J. Bitter W. General secretion signal for the mycobacterial type VII secretion pathway.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

This fragment was subsequently used to replace the rv2430c-His sequence in pET29b(+)::Rv2430–31c-His, thereby generating pET29b(+)::Rv2430–31c. Similarly, a fragment coding for C-terminally His-tagged PPE41 without its last 20 amino acids was amplified from pSMT3::PE25-HA-PPE41 with primers pET41_F and pET41d20C_R. Subsequently, replacement of the rv2430c-His fragment in pET29b(+)::Rv2430–31c-His as described above resulted in pET29b(+)::Rv2430–31cΔ20C-His. Plasmids for E. coli expression of PE35 and PPE68_1, with and without a C-terminal His tag, were constructed by first amplifying mmar_0185 from pSMT3::MmPE35-HA-MmPPE68_1 (9Daleke M.H. Ummels R.

This fragment was ligated into pET29b(+)::Rv2430–31c-His after NdeI/KpnI digestion, thereby replacing the rv2431c gene. Subsequently, the rv2430c-His fragment of this vector was substituted for either WT or His-labeled PPE68_1-encoding fragments, amplified with the 5′ NcoI site-containing primer pET68_F and either pET68noHis_R or pET68_R, both with HindIII sites, from pSMT3::PE35-HA-PPE68_1. This resulted in plasmids pET29b(+)::PE35-PPE68_1 and pET29b(+)::PE35-PPE68_1-His. To generate the construct for expression of PE25 lacking the last 15 amino acids, together with C-terminally His-tagged PPE41, the pET29b(+)::Rv2430–31c-His vector was used as template in a nested PCR approach. A fragment containing the first RBS and the first 255 bp of rv2431c was amplified using primers pET-31cF, which contained a PstI restriction site, and pET-d15cR. This fragment was fused to a PCR amplicon containing the second E. coli-optimized RBS, the entire rv2430c, and the sequence coding for a His6 epitope, using primers pET-d15cF and pET-30cHisR, which had an EcoRV site. The resulting fragment was digested with PstI and EcoRV and ligated into the E. coli-mycobacterial shuttle vector pSMT3 (20Hayward C.M. O'Gaora P. Young D.B. Griffin G.E. Thole J. Hirst T.R.

After digestion by XbaI and XhoI, the resulting fragment was introduced in pET15b(+), which was cut with the same enzymes, resulting in pET15b(+)::esxMN. Preparation of whole cell lysates, extraction of surface proteins by treatment with Genapol X-080, and precipitation of proteins secreted into the medium of M. marinum were carried out as described (14Daleke M.H.

Mycobacterial cultures grown to an A600 of ∼1.0 were incubated for 1 h with 100 μg/ml ciprofloxacin (Sigma), washed twice with PBS, and subsequently resuspended in PBS supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm EDTA, and optionally 10 mm imidazole. Cells were broken by two-times passage through a One Shot cell disrupter (Constant Systems) at 0.83 kbar, adding 1 mm DTT after the first press. Unbroken cells were spun down by repeated centrifugation at 3000 × g, and subsequently the cell envelope and soluble fractions were separated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g. Overnight cultures of E. coli TOP10F′ harboring pASK-IBA3 plasmids were diluted to an OD660 of 0.05 and incubated until an OD660 of 0.3, at which expression of recombinant proteins was induced by the addition of 200 μg/ml anhydrotetracycline for 2 h. Proteins were expressed from pET29b(+) vectors in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS essentially as described in Ref. 19Strong M. Sawaya M.R. Wang S. Phillips M. Cascio D. Eisenberg D.

Briefly, overnight cultures were diluted to an OD660 of 0.05 in medium containing 0.2% dextrose to repress premature expression of recombinant proteins. At an OD660 of 0.6, expression of the recombinant proteins was induced for 3 h in the presence of 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. EsxM/EsxN were expressed from pET15b(+) using the same strain and conditions, but for induction 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was used. PE25Δ15C and C-terminally His-tagged PPE41 were expressed constitutively in E. coli XL10-Gold from the Plac promoter in the pSMT3::PE25Δ15C-PPE41-His vector. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended to a concentration of 50 OD units/ml in a buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4 and 300 mm NaCl (pH 8.0), and lysed in a One Shot cell disrupter at 1.72 kbar. Unbroken cells were removed by low speed centrifugation, and soluble proteins were obtained by ultracentrifugation. Subsequently, the E. coli lysates were diluted in 50 mm NaH2PO4 and 300 mm NaCl (pH 8.0) in such a way that the concentration of soluble recombinant protein was similar in all samples. Ni2+ purifications of His-labeled proteins expressed in M. marinum were performed by loading filtered soluble lysates on washed HisTrap HP columns (GE Healthcare) at 0.5 ml/min. Optionally, the filtered M. marinum lysates were precleared on HisTrap-Sepharose columns that had been stripped from Ni2+, prior to loading on a Ni2+-loaded column. After extensive washing of the column with phosphate buffer (20 mm phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) containing 50 mm imidazole, bound proteins were eluted with 5 ml phosphate buffer containing 150 mm imidazole, and collected in 500-μl fractions. Wash and elution fractions were precipitated with 10% TCA. Alternatively, lysates of M. marinum-expressing proteins of interest were incubated with Ni-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen) for 1 h at room temperature with head-over-head rotation. After washing the beads five times with phosphate buffer containing 20 mm imidazole, bound proteins were eluted by incubation with 100, 200, and 500 mm imidazole, respectively. Immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged proteins was performed using the HA Tag IP/Co-IP kit (Pierce). For the in vitro pulldowns, soluble lysates of E. coli containing similar amounts of recombinant proteins were mixed with Ni-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen) for 1 h at room temperature. Washing was performed as described above using a buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole (pH 8.0), and proteins were eluted using this buffer supplemented with 100 or 250 mm imidazole. espG5 was cloned with an N-terminal His tag under control of the T7 promoter in the pETM-11 vector (EMBL). The gene was amplified using a 5′ primer containing a NcoI digestion site (AP-303) and a 3′ primer with XhoI digestion site (AP-304). After digestion, the fragments were ligated into NcoI and XhoI-digested pETM-11, resulting in pAP200. For expression of PE25 and C-terminally His-tagged PPE41 in E. coli a previously described construct was used in which the rv2431c and rv2430c genes were each placed behind a RBS (19Strong M.

All proteins were produced in E. coli BL21(DE3) after induction with 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and overnight incubation at 20 °C. Cells were lysed by sonication in 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl supplemented with protease inhibitor mix (Serva). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and subjected to standard immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) using HisTrap HP columns. After washing with 20 mm imidazole, recombinant proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 20–250 mm imidazole in 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl. Relevant protein fractions were pooled and concentrated and subjected to protease treatment for tag removal. His tags were cleaved from EspG5 by overnight incubation with tobacco etch virus protease at 4 °C. Protease and uncleaved protein were removed by a second IMAC step. In case of PE25/PPE41-His, biotinylated thrombin (Novagen) was used which was subsequently removed by streptavidin beads (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. All proteins were further purified to homogeneity by preparative size exclusion chromatography (HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg; GE Healthcare) in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl. EspG5 as well as PE25/PPE41 were concentrated using Vivaspin centrifugal concentrators (Corning) to a final concentration of 8.6 and 5.3 mg/ml, respectively. Protein concentrations were estimated by measurements of absorbance at 280 nm using theoretical molar absorption coefficients calculated by ProtParam. Proteins were analyzed with a Viscotek 305 tridetector (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK) which monitors light scattering, refractive index, and UV absorbance. This setup was connected to an analytical size exclusion column (Superdex 200 10/300 GL; GE Healthcare) equilibrated at 20 °C in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl as running buffer. Flow rate was set to 0.5 ml/min, and the sample volume was 100 μl. Proteins were diluted to 1 mg/ml in running buffer prior to analysis. To detect heterotrimeric complex formation, EspG5 was mixed with PE25/PPE41 at a 3-fold molar excess and incubated 30 min at 20 °C before injection. The provided OmniSEC software was used to acquire and evaluate all data. Molecular masses were estimated using refractive index combined with light-scattering data using BSA as an internal control using a refractive index increment with protein concentration (dn/dc) of 0.185 ml/g. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (CBB; Bio-Rad), or transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by Western blotting. The membranes were incubated with mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against the conserved repeat of PE_PGRS proteins (mAb 7C4.1F7) (13Abdallah A.M. Verboom T. Weerdenburg E.M. Gey van Pittius N.C.

https://openalex.org/W2077192604,The elusive transduction channels for hearing are directly gated mechanically by the pull of gating springs. We found that the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel TRPN1 (NOMPC) is essential for this direct gating of Drosophila auditory transduction channels and that the channel-spring complex was disrupted if TRPN1 was lost. Our results identify TRPN1 as a mechanical constituent of the fly's auditory transduction complex that may act as the channel and/or gating spring.
https://openalex.org/W1975569588,"Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been recently investigated for use in noninvasive brain-computer interface (BCI) technologies. Previous studies have demonstrated the ability to classify patterns of neural activation associated with different mental tasks (e.g., mental arithmetic) using NIRS signals. Though these studies represent an important step towards the realization of an NIRS-BCI, there is a paucity of literature regarding the consistency of these responses, and the ability to classify them on a single-trial basis, over multiple sessions. This is important when moving out of an experimental context toward a practical system, where performance must be maintained over longer periods. When considering response consistency across sessions, two questions arise: 1) can the hemodynamic response to the activation task be distinguished from a baseline (or other task) condition, consistently across sessions, and if so, 2) are the spatiotemporal characteristics of the response which best distinguish it from the baseline (or other task) condition consistent across sessions. The answers will have implications for the viability of an NIRS-BCI system, and the design strategies (especially in terms of classifier training protocols) adopted. In this study, we investigated the consistency of classification of a mental arithmetic task and a no-control condition over five experimental sessions. Mixed model linear regression on intrasession classification accuracies indicate that the task and baseline states remain differentiable across multiple sessions, with no significant decrease in accuracy (p = 0.67). Intersession analysis, however, revealed inconsistencies in spatiotemporal response characteristics. Based on these results, we investigated several different practical classifier training protocols, including scenarios in which the training and test data come from 1) different sessions, 2) the same session, and 3) a combination of both. Results indicate that when selecting optimal classifier training protocols for NIRS-BCI, a compromise between accuracy and convenience (e.g., in terms of duration/frequency of training data collection) must be considered."
https://openalex.org/W1990241868,"Gram-negative bacteria harboring KPC-2, a class A β-lactamase, are resistant to all β-lactam antibiotics and pose a major public health threat. Arg-164 is a conserved residue in all class A β-lactamases and is located in the solvent-exposed Ω-loop of KPC-2. To probe the role of this amino acid in KPC-2, we performed site-saturation mutagenesis. When compared with wild type, 11 of 19 variants at position Arg-164 in KPC-2 conferred increased resistance to the oxyimino-cephalosporin, ceftazidime (minimum inhibitory concentration; 32→128 mg/liter) when expressed in Escherichia coli. Using the R164S variant of KPC-2 as a representative β-lactamase for more detailed analysis, we observed only a modest 25% increase in k(cat)/K(m) for ceftazidime (0.015→0.019 μm(-1) s(-1)). Employing pre-steady-state kinetics and mass spectrometry, we determined that acylation is rate-limiting for ceftazidime hydrolysis by KPC-2, whereas deacylation is rate-limiting in the R164S variant, leading to accumulation of acyl-enzyme at steady-state. CD spectroscopy revealed that a conformational change occurred in the turnover of ceftazidime by KPC-2, but not the R164S variant, providing evidence for a different form of the enzyme at steady state. Molecular models constructed to explain these findings suggest that ceftazidime adopts a unique conformation, despite preservation of Ω-loop structure. We propose that the R164S substitution in KPC-2 enhances ceftazidime resistance by proceeding through ""covalent trapping"" of the substrate by a deacylation impaired enzyme with a lower K(m). Future antibiotic design must consider the distinctive behavior of the Ω-loop of KPC-2."
https://openalex.org/W2013700732,"The interleukin (IL)-1β-processing inflammasome has recently been identified as a target for pathogenic evasion of the inflammatory response by a number of bacteria and viruses. We postulated that the periodontal pathogen, Porphyromonas gingivalis may suppress the inflammasome as a mechanism for its low immunogenicity and pathogenic synergy with other, more highly immunogenic periodontal bacteria. Our results show that P. gingivalis lacks signaling capability for the activation of the inflammasome in mouse macrophages. Furthermore, P. gingivalis can suppress inflammasome activation by another periodontal bacterium, Fusobacterium nucleatum. This repression affects IL-1β processing, as well as other inflammasome-mediated processes, including IL-18 processing and cell death, in both human and mouse macrophages. F. nucleatum activates IL-1β processing through the Nlrp3 inflammasome; however, P. gingivalis repression is not mediated through reduced levels of inflammasome components. P. gingivalis can repress Nlrp3 inflammasome activation by Escherichia coli, and by danger-associated molecular patterns and pattern-associated molecular patterns that mediate activation through endocytosis. However, P. gingivalis does not suppress Nlrp3 inflammasome activation by ATP or nigericin. This suggests that P. gingivalis may preferentially suppress endocytic pathways toward inflammasome activation. To directly test whether P. gingivalis infection affects endocytosis, we assessed the uptake of fluorescent particles in the presence or absence of P. gingivalis. Our results show that P. gingivalis limits both the number of cells taking up beads and the number of beads taken up for bead-positive cells. These results provide a novel mechanism of pathogen-mediated inflammasome inhibition through the suppression of endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2098196505,"The cytoprotective enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is often overexpressed in different types of cancers and promotes cancer progression. We have recently shown that the Ras-Raf-ERK pathway induces HO-1 to promote survival of renal cancer cells. Here, we examined the possible mechanisms underlying HO-1-mediated cell survival. Considering the growing evidence about the significance of apoptosis and autophagy in cancer, we tried to investigate how HO-1 controls these events to regulate survival of cancer cells. Rapamycin (RAPA) and sorafenib, two commonly used drugs for renal cancer treatment, were found to induce HO-1 expression in renal cancer cells Caki-1 and 786-O; and the apoptotic effect of these drugs was markedly enhanced upon HO-1 knockdown. Overexpression of HO-1 protected the cells from RAPA- and sorafenib-induced apoptosis and also averted drug-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation. HO-1 induced the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL and decreased the expression of autophagic proteins Beclin-1 and LC3B-II; while knockdown of HO-1 down-regulated Bcl-xL and markedly increased LC3B-II. Moreover, HO-1 promoted the association of Beclin-1 with Bcl-xL and Rubicon, a novel negative regulator of autophagy. Drug-induced dissociation of Beclin-1 from Rubicon and the induction of autophagy were also inhibited by HO-1. Together, our data signify that HO-1 is up-regulated in renal cancer cells as a survival strategy against chemotherapeutic drugs and promotes growth of tumor cells by inhibiting both apoptosis and autophagy. Thus, application of chemotherapeutic drugs along with HO-1 inhibitor may elevate therapeutic efficiency by reducing the cytoprotective effects of HO-1 and by simultaneous induction of both apoptosis and autophagy."
https://openalex.org/W2004207778,"Competing models of sensorimotor computation predict different topological constraints in the brain. Some models propose population coding of particular reference frames in anatomically distinct nodes, whereas others require no such dedicated subpopulations and instead predict that regions will simultaneously code in multiple, intermediate, reference frames. Current empirical evidence is conflicting, partly due to difficulties involved in identifying underlying reference frames. Here, we independently varied the locations of hand, gaze, and target over many positions while recording from the dorsal aspect of parietal area 5. We find that the target is represented in a predominantly hand-centered reference frame here, contrasting with the relative code seen in dorsal premotor cortex and the mostly gaze-centered reference frame in the parietal reach region. This supports the hypothesis that different nodes of the sensorimotor circuit contain distinct and systematic representations, and this constrains the types of computational model that are neurobiologically relevant."

The histone chaperone complex facilitates chromatin transcription (FACT) is responsible for forming H3K4me3 at AID target loci. Here we show that the histone chaperone suppressor of Ty6 (Spt6) also participates in regulating H3K4me3 for CSR and for somatic hypermutation in AID target loci. We found that H3K4me3 loss was correlated with defects in AID-induced DNA breakage and reduced mutation frequencies in IgH loci in both S and variable regions and in non-IgH loci such as metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) and small nucleolar RNA host gene 3 (SNHG3). Global gene expression analysis revealed that Spt6 can act as both a positive and negative transcriptional regulator in B cells, affecting ∼5% of the genes that includes suppressor of Ty4 (Spt4) and AID.

The RAG2 PHD domain recognizes H3K4me3, which explains how H3K4me3 can tether the RAG complex to transcriptionally active loci. H3K4me3 also has a stimulatory effect that suggests it is involved in both the recruiting and the enzymatic activity of V(D)J recombinase (9Shimazaki N. Tsai A.G. Lieber M.R.

In the case of meiotic recombination, the hotspot-specific H3K4me3 methylase Prdm9, found in mammalian germ cells, is critical for positioning the recombination sites (1Parvanov E.D. Petkov P.M.

However, meiotic recombination-specific and transcription-specific H3K4me3 are both mediated by the single histone methyltransferase Set1 in budding yeast, and disrupting Set1 leads to defective meiotic recombination (8Borde V.

The functional role of germline transcript (GLT) in CSR has long been debated ever since it became clear that transcripts per se do not encode protein. The transcripts may serve to form a heteroduplex with transcribed DNA, thus forming an R-loop (13Yu K. Roy D. Bayramyan M. Haworth I.S. Lieber M.R.

An obvious consequence of transcription is the introduction of aberrant supercoiling, positive to the front and negative to the rear of the transcription machinery. This accumulation of aberrant supercoiling can enhance non-B DNA structure formation, especially in highly repetitive and palindromic sequences such as S regions (14Dunnick W. Hertz G.Z. Scappino L.

Non-B structure formation coupled with transcription has been extensively discussed with respect to triplet repeats and other repetitive sequences that suffer from genome instability (17Zhao J.

Our recent studies on the FACT complex show that transcription has a function associated with the chromatin epigenetic regulation in CSR. In CH12F3–2A cells, which efficiently switch to IgA, knocking down FACT components, either structure-specific recognition protein 1 (Ssrp1) or suppressor of Ty16 homolog (Spt16), drastically reduces CSR by specifically reducing the histone posttranslational modification (PTM) H3K4me3 marks. This reduction in H3K4me3, which is not linked to S-region histone loss or transcriptional status, suppressed DNA cleavage of the target S regions (6Stanlie A. Aida M. Muramatsu M. Honjo T. Begum N.A. Histone3 lysine4 trimethylation regulated by the facilitates chromatin transcription complex is critical for DNA cleavage in class switch recombination.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 22190-22195Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The requirement of H3K4me3 as a DNA cleavage mark in CSR led us to speculate that the same molecular mechanism is shared between CSR and meiotic and V(D)J recombinations (6Stanlie A. Aida M. Muramatsu M. Honjo T. Begum N.A. Histone3 lysine4 trimethylation regulated by the facilitates chromatin transcription complex is critical for DNA cleavage in class switch recombination.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 22190-22195Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Clearly, the FACT complex is not the only chromatin regulator. We recently reported that AID interacts with Spt6, another histone chaperone associated with transcription elongation (19Okazaki I.M. Okawa K. Kobayashi M. Yoshikawa K. Kawamoto S. Nagaoka H. Shinkura R. Kitawaki Y. Taniguchi H. Natsume T. Iemura S. Honjo T. Histone chaperone Spt6 is required for class switch recombination but not somatic hypermutation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 7920-7925Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, knocking down Spt6 reduced CSR but not SHM in a GFP reporter construct. Moreover, an extensive protein-protein interaction analysis between Spt6 and various AID mutants revealed that interaction of Spt6 with AID is unlikely to contribute in CSR (19Okazaki I.M. Okawa K. Kobayashi M. Yoshikawa K. Kawamoto S. Nagaoka H. Shinkura R. Kitawaki Y. Taniguchi H. Natsume T. Iemura S. Honjo T. Histone chaperone Spt6 is required for class switch recombination but not somatic hypermutation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 7920-7925Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Besides chaperoning histones in transcription, Spt6 acts to transport and splice mRNA by forming a complex with Iws1 and Pol II phosphorylated at the C-terminal domain on serine 2 (Ser2P-CTD-Pol II) (20Yoh S.M. Lucas J.S. Jones K.A. The Iws1·Spt6·CTD complex controls cotranscriptional mRNA biosynthesis and HYPB/Setd2-mediated histone H3K36 methylation.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 3422-3434Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Iws1 interacts directly with the mRNA export factor REF1/Aly (21Yoh S.M. Cho H. Pickle L. Evans R.M. Jones K.A. The Spt6 SH2 domain binds Ser2-P RNAPII to direct Iws1-dependent mRNA splicing and export.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 160-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), which in turn recruits the nuclear exosome component Rrp6 in the elongation complex to form messenger ribonucleoprotein particle (mRNP) particles (22Jensen T.H. Dower K. Libri D. Rosbash M. Early formation of mRNP. License for export or quality control?.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1129-1138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, Spt6 involvement in processing mRNA is not direct but depends on the Iws1 and exosome complexes. Moreover, nine exosome subunits are copurified with Drosophila Spt6 (23Andrulis E.D. Werner J. Nazarian A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Lis J.T. The RNA processing exosome is linked to elongating RNA polymerase II in Drosophila.Nature. 2002; 420: 837-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar); if this is the case in higher eukaryotes as well, exosome-associated components may influence Spt6 function in CSR. In this study we screened for new chromatin modulators in CSR regulation and identified only FACT and Spt6. The role of Spt6 in CSR has never been studied from a histone chaperone point of view; therefore, we investigated the molecular mechanism by which Spt6 regulates CSR. Depleting Spt6 in CH12F3–2A cells effectively blocked AID-induced DNA breaks and concomitantly reduced H3K4me3 in the Sμ and Sα regions. We also found that Spt6 knockdown abolished SHM and H3K4me3 marks in the IgH variable (VH) region and in newly identified AID target genes but not in the GFP transgene. Spt6 knockdown in the human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line BL2 produced similar effects. Therefore, we conclude that Spt6 regulates both CSR and SHM through H3K4me3 marks on AID target loci. The mouse B-cell lymphoma line CH12F3–2A and a human Burkitt's lymphoma line BL2 used in this study have been described previously (6Stanlie A. Aida M. Muramatsu M. Honjo T. Begum N.A.

The BL2 cells used express Jp8BdelER, a hypermutating form of AID fused with the hormone binding domain of the estrogen receptor. Jp8BdelER was activated using 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Chemically modified RNAi oligonucleotides (Stealth RNAi siRNA) from Invitrogen were transfected into 1 × 106 BL2 or CH12F3–2A cells. Three kinds of stealth siRNA were examined per target gene, and the siRNA with the highest knockdown efficiency was selected. In CSR rescue experiments, FLAG-Spt6 constructs and siRNA against Spt6 were co-transfected into cells using a Nucleofector 96-well electroporation system (Amaxa). The CM150 and DS150 programs were used for CH12F3–2A and BL2 cells, respectively. After electroporation, the cells were cultured for a 24-h period, stimulated by CD40L, IL4, and TGFβ (CIT) or 4-hydroxytamoxifen, and cultured for another 24 h before harvesting and analysis. CH12F3–2A cells were cultured and stimulated to induce class switching, as previously described (25Nakamura M. Kondo S. Sugai M. Nazarea M. Imamura S. Honjo T. High frequency class switching of an IgM+ B lymphoma clone CH12F3 to IgA+ cells.Int. Immunol. 1996; 8: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The cells were analyzed by FACS after 24 h of CIT stimulation. Surface IgM and IgA were stained with FITC-conjugated anti-IgM and phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated anti-IgA antibodies, respectively. Dead cells were excluded by propidium iodide staining, and all the analyses were performed on a FACS Calibur (BD Biosciences). To analyze SHM in BL2 cells, cells expressing Jp8BdelER (24Nagaoka H. Ito S. Muramatsu M. Nakata M. Honjo T. DNA cleavage in immunoglobulin somatic hypermutation depends on de novo protein synthesis but not on uracil DNA glycosylase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

PCR was performed using Pyrobest polymerase (TaKaRa) with the following amplification conditions: 95 °C for 5 min, 30 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 1 min. After purification, the PCR fragments were cloned into Zero Blunt vectors (Invitrogen). The mutation frequency was calculated as the number of mutations per total bases from independent experiments. ChIP assays were performed using the ChIP-IT Express Kit (Active Motif) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 5 × 106 cells were fixed in the presence of 1% formaldehyde for 5–8 min at room temperature. Glycine was added to a final concentration of 0.125 m to stop the reaction. Cell lysis and sonication yielded a soluble chromatin fraction containing fragmented DNA of 500–2000 bp. The lysate was immunoprecipitated by incubation with 3 μg of antibody. Protein-G magnetic bead-bound ChIPed DNA was eluted, and locus-specific enrichment was detected by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) normalized to the input DNA. To show the relative occupancy, one of the data points was set as 100%, as described earlier (6Stanlie A. Aida M. Muramatsu M. Honjo T. Begum N.A. Histone3 lysine4 trimethylation regulated by the facilitates chromatin transcription complex is critical for DNA cleavage in class switch recombination.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

RNA polymerase II pauses and associates with pre-mRNA processing factors at both ends of genes.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). ChIP results were verified in independent experiments, and S.D. was calculated from three experiments. For all siRNA-related experiments, the total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Oligo d(T)-primed cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of RNA using SuperScript II. The SYBR Green Master Mix was used for RT-PCR with gene-specific primers. The Hprt and Gapdh genes were used as reference controls for CH12F3–2A and BL2 cells, respectively. The DNA break assay was conducted as described previously (27Doi T. Kato L. Ito S. Shinkura R. Wei M. Nagaoka H. Wang J. Honjo T. The C-terminal region of activation-induced cytidine deaminase is responsible for a recombination function other than DNA cleavage in class switch recombination.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 2758-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Full-length mouse Spt6 was amplified by RT-PCR of the RNA isolated from CH12F3–2A cells. The Spt6 cDNA was then cloned into the BamHI and SalI sites of the pCMVTag-2A vector (Sigma) to generate N-terminally FLAG-tagged wild type Spt6. The appropriate primers were designed to create serial deletions from either the N or C terminus; the resulting fragments were inserted in-frame with the N-terminal FLAG sequence in the vector. Internal deletions were generated separately by overlapping PCR amplification, and the resulting fragments were joined and fused in-frame with the FLAG epitope. Mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange Multi-site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to alter the siRNA (Spt6, MSS209821 Invitrogen) target sequence (gagaccttctacattggaaagctta/3475–3499 bp of Ref seq. BC072657) by preserving the coded amino acid sequence (gaAacGttTtaTatCggGaaActCa). Each construct's expression was examined by lysing 1 × 106 cells in RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor. Expression of FLAG tagged constructs was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using cell lysates or proteins pulled down by FLAG beads. RNA samples were prepared from CIT-stimulated CH12F3–2A cells pretreated with either control or Spt6 siRNA. For microarray analysis, we used a 3D-Gene Mouse Oligo chip 24k (Toray Industries Inc., Tokyo) with 23,522 distinct genes. Total RNA was labeled with Cy5 using the Amino Allyl MessageAMP II aRNA Amplification kit (Applied Biosystems, CA). The Cy5-labeled aRNA was hybridized for 16 h using the supplier's protocol (3d-gene website). Hybridization signals were scanned with a ScanArray Express Scanner (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and were processed by GenePixPro Version 5.0 (Molecular Devices). Subtracting the mean intensity of the background signal normalized the raw data of each spot (determined by the signal intensities of all blank spots with 95% confidence intervals). Intensities greater than 2 S.D. of the background signal intensity were considered valid. The signals detected for each gene were subjected to global normalization (the median of the detected signal intensity was adjusted to 30). Primers, antibodies, and siRNA oligonucleotides used are listed in the supplemental reagent list.” In this screen we focused on histone chaperones and chromatin remodelers that showed distinct histone selectivity or interaction during transcription, replication, or repair processes (28Das C.

Sci. 2010; 35: 476-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 29De Koning L. Corpet A. Haber J.E. Almouzni G. Histone chaperones. An escort network regulating histone traffic.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). We first tested the effect of knocking down Caf1 or Asf1, which are replication-associated histone chaperones, on CSR. Three siRNAs against Caf1 showed different degrees of knockdown efficiency that correlated well with reductions in CSR and cell viability. In fact, when the siRNA with the highest knockdown efficiency was introduced, no class-switched cells were detected (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, depleting Asf1 did not inhibit CSR or affect cell viability even though Asf1 acts as a histone donor (H3-H4 and H3.1-H4) for Caf1 during replication-coupled chromatin assembly. Asf1 also transfers H3.3-H4 to the Hira histone chaperone in replication-independent chromatin assembly (30Tagami H. Ray-Gallet D. Almouzni G. Nakatani Y. Histone H3.1 and H3.3 complexes mediate nucleosome assembly pathways dependent or independent of DNA synthesis.Cell. 2004; 116: 51-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar), but Hira knockdown did not cause any observable CSR defect. We thus concluded that the effect of Caf1 knockdown on CSR was primarily due to cell death. We also examined the effects of knocking down Daxx, Dek, and Atrx, as these histone chaperones were recently reported to have locus-specific involvement in H3.3-H4 assembly (31Lewis P.W. Elsaesser S.J. Noh K.M. Stadler S.C. Allis C.D. Daxx is an H3.3-specific histone chaperone and cooperates with ATRX in replication-independent chromatin assembly at telomeres.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 14075-14080Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), but there was no significant effect on CSR (supplemental Table 1 and Fig. 1). We next tested Nap1l1 and Nap1l3, nucleosome assembly protein family members that interact with H2A-H2B and with linker histones. Although Nap1l1 knockdown inhibited CSR to some degree, Nap1l3 knockdown did not change the CSR efficiency. Knocking down the Snf2-related CREBBP-activator protein Srcap, a component of the H2AZ-associated histone chaperone complex, inhibited CSR by about 50%. A similar reduction in CSR was seen when a dominant-negative form of H2AZ was overexpressed in CH12F3–2A cells, 4A. Stanlie, N. A. Begum, and T. Honjo, unpublished information. suggesting that specific histone variants may contribute to CSR. Depleting DNA repair-associated chromatin remodelers such as the ATP-dependent chromatin assembly factor Acf1, the SWI/SNF-related chromatin regulator Smarcal1, and Ino80 minimally affected CSR. In contrast, knocking down any of the elongation-associated histone chaperones, Spt6, or the FACT components structure-specific recognition protein 1 (Ssrp1) and suppressor of Ty16 homolog (Spt16) strongly inhibited CSR (Fig. 1C). These results along with characteristic features of the histone chaperones and chromatin remodelers examined are summarized in supplemental Table 1. We next investigated how the histone chaperone activity of Spt6 affects CSR. We first confirmed that depleting Spt6 in activated CH12F3–2A cells did not inhibit μGLT or αGLT production from the Iμ and Iα promoters, respectively (19Okazaki I.M. Okawa K. Kobayashi M. Yoshikawa K. Kawamoto S. Nagaoka H. Shinkura R. Kitawaki Y. Taniguchi H. Natsume T. Iemura S. Honjo T. Histone chaperone Spt6 is required for class switch recombination but not somatic hypermutation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 7920-7925Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Spt6 knockdown slightly enhanced μGLT transcription (Fig. 2, A and B, transcript b). On the other hand, knocking down Spt6 modestly decreased the αGLT and AID transcripts (Fig. 2A,B; transcripts d and f). Since aberrant transcription initiation was reported in yeast Spt6 mutants (32Kaplan C.D. Laprade L. Winston F. Transcription elongation factors repress transcription initiation from cryptic sites.Science. 2003; 301: 1096-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), we looked for possible cryptic transcription initiation from the Sμ, Sα, and AID loci after Spt6 depletion. As depicted in Fig. 2A, we designed primers within the S-region introns to detect type-c and type-e transcripts from Sμ and Sα, respectively. In the absence of Spt6 we found increased accumulations of type-c transcripts from Sμ (Fig. 2Bc, Sμ-internal) but no increase in type-e transcripts from Sα. A similar approach for the AID locus using primers located in intron1 and exon2 did not detect any such transcripts, suggesting that the aberrant intronic transcript initiation in the absence of Spt6 was specific for Sμ. Next we examined whether Spt6 knockdown inhibits DNA breakage in the S regions. To assess S-region DNA cleavage, we performed quantitative DNA-break assays using two methods, γH2AX ChIP and direct cleaved-end labeling (27Doi T. Kato L. Ito S. Shinkura R. Wei M. Nagaoka H.

We found here that CD151 plays a role in recruiting Ras, Rac1, and Cdc42, but not Rho, to the cell membrane region, leading to the formation of α(3)β(1)/α(6)β(1) integrin-CD151-GTPases complexes. Furthermore, cell adhesion to laminin enhanced CD151 association with β(1) integrin and, thereby, increased complex formation between the β(1) family of integrins and small GTPases, Ras, Rac1, and Cdc42. Adhesion receptor complex-associated small GTPases were activated by CD151-β(1) integrin complex-stimulating adhesion events, such as α(3)β(1)/α(6)β(1) integrin-activating cell-to-laminin adhesion and homophilic CD151 interaction-generating cell-to-cell adhesion. Additionally, FAK and Src appeared to participate in this adhesion-dependent activation of small GTPases. However, engagement of laminin-binding integrins in CD151-deficient cells or CD151-specific siRNA-transfected cells did not activate these GTPases to the level of cells expressing CD151. Small GTPases activated by engagement of CD151-β(1) integrin complexes contributed to CD151-induced cell motility and MMP-9 expression in human melanoma cells. Importantly, among the four tetraspanin proteins that associate with β(1) integrin, only CD151 exhibited the ability to facilitate complex formation between the β(1) family of integrins and small GTPases and stimulate β(1) integrin-dependent activation of small GTPases. These results suggest that CD151 links α(3)β(1)/α(6)β(1) integrins to Ras, Rac1, and Cdc42 by promoting the formation of multimolecular complexes in the membrane, which leads to the up-regulation of adhesion-dependent small GTPase activation."

The stress axis regulated exon (STREX) at splice site 2 inverts BK channel regulation by protein kinase A (PKA) from stimulatory to inhibitory. Here we show that palmitoylation of STREX controls BK channel regulation also by protein kinase C (PKC). In contrast to the 50% decrease of maximal channel activity by PKC in the insertless (ZERO) splice variant, STREX channels were completely resistant to PKC. STREX channel mutants in which Ser700, located between the two regulatory domains of K+ conductance (RCK) immediately downstream of the STREX insert, was replaced by the phosphomimetic amino acid glutamate (S700E) showed a ∼50% decrease in maximal channel activity, whereas the S700A mutant retained its normal activity. BK channel inhibition by PKC, however, was effectively established when the palmitoylation-mediated membrane-anchor of the STREX insert was removed by either pharmacological inhibition of palmitoyl transferases or site-directed mutagenesis. These findings suggest that STREX confers a conformation on BK channels where PKC fails to phosphorylate and to inhibit channel activity. Importantly, PKA which inhibits channel activity by disassembling the STREX insert from the plasma membrane, allows PKC to further suppress the channel gating independent from voltage and calcium.

In addition, they find that spontaneous GABA release involves coincident opening of multiple closely packed calcium channels. Voltage-activated Ca2+ channels (VACCs) mediate Ca2+ influx to trigger action potential–evoked neurotransmitter release, but the mechanism by which Ca2+ regulates spontaneous transmission is unclear. We found that VACCs are the major physiological triggers for spontaneous release at mouse neocortical inhibitory synapses. Moreover, despite the absence of a synchronizing action potential, we found that spontaneous fusion of a GABA-containing vesicle required the activation of multiple tightly coupled VACCs of variable type."

Here, we describe two sensitive, in-solution, time-resolved Förster's resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET)-based immunoassays for total and oligomeric α-synuclein quantification. CSF analysis showed strong concordance for total α-synuclein content between two TR-FRET assays and, in agreement with a previously characterized 36 h protocol-based ELISA, demonstrated lower α-synuclein levels in PD donors. Critically, the assay suitability for high-throughput screening of siRNA constructs and small molecules aimed at reducing endogenous α-synuclein levels was established and validated. In a small-scale proof of concept compound screen using 384 well plates, signals ranged from <30 to >120% of the mean of vehicle-treated cells for molecules known to lower and increase cellular α-synuclein, respectively. Furthermore, a reverse genetic screen of a kinase-directed siRNA library identified seven genes that modulated α-synuclein protein levels (five whose knockdown increased and two that decreased cellular α-synuclein protein). This provides critical new biological insight into cellular pathways regulating α-synuclein steady-state expression that may help guide further drug discovery efforts. Moreover, we describe an inherent limitation in current α-synuclein oligomer detection methodology, a finding that will direct improvement of future assay design.

https://openalex.org/W2153041644,"The vomeronasal organ (VNO) is essential for intraspecies communication in many terrestrial vertebrates. The ionic mechanisms of VNO activation remain unclear. We found that the calcium-activated potassium channel SK3 and the G protein-activated potassium channel GIRK are part of an independent pathway for VNO activation. In slice preparations, the potassium channels attenuated inward currents carried by TRPC2 and calcium-activated chloride channels (CACCs). In intact tissue preparations, paradoxically, the potassium channels enhanced urine-evoked inward currents. This discrepancy resulted from the loss of a high concentration of lumenal potassium, which enabled the influx of potassium ions to depolarize the VNO neurons in vivo. Both Sk3 (also known as Kcnn3) and Girk1 (also known as Kcnj3) homozygous null mice showed deficits in mating and aggressive behaviors, and the deficiencies in Sk3(-/-) mice were exacerbated by Trpc2 knockout. Our results suggest that VNO activation is mediated by TRPC2, CACCs and two potassium channels, all of which contributed to the in vivo depolarization of VNO neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2127169937,"Fibrillar α-synuclein (α-Syn) is the principal component of Lewy bodies, which are evident in individuals affected by Parkinson disease (PD). This neuropathologic form of α-Syn plays a central role in PD progression as it has been shown to propagate between neurons. Tools that interfere with α-Syn assembly or change the physicochemical properties of the fibrils have potential therapeutic properties as they may be sufficient to interfere with and/or halt cell-to-cell transmission and the systematic spread of α-Syn assemblies within the central nervous system. Vertebrate molecular chaperones from the constitutive/heat-inducible heat shock protein 70 (Hsc/p70) family have been shown to hinder the assembly of soluble α-Syn into fibrils and to bind to the fibrils and very significantly reduce their toxicity. To understand how Hsc70 family members sequester soluble α-Syn, we set up experiments to identify the molecular chaperone-α-Syn surface interfaces. We cross-linked human Hsc70 and its yeast homologue Ssa1p and α-Syn using a chemical cross-linker and mapped the Hsc70- and Ssa1p-α-Syn interface. We show that the client binding domain of Hsc70 and Ssa1p binds two regions within α-Syn similar to a tweezer, with the first spanning residues 10-45 and the second spanning residues 97-102. Our findings define what is necessary and sufficient for engineering Hsc70- and Ssa1p-derived polypeptide with minichaperone properties with a potential as therapeutic agents in Parkinson disease through their ability to affect α-Syn assembly and/or toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2017444114,"Inorganic arsenic is a well-documented human carcinogen associated with cancers of the skin, lung, liver, and bladder. However, the underlying mechanisms explaining the tumorigenic role of arsenic are not well understood. The present study explored a potential mechanism of cell transformation induced by arsenic exposure. Exposure to a low dose (0.5 μm) of arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) caused transformation of BALB/c 3T3 cells. In addition, in a xenograft mouse model, tumor growth of the arsenic-induced transformed cells was dramatically increased. In arsenic-induced transformed cells, polycomb group (PcG) proteins, including BMI1 and SUZ12, were activated resulting in enhanced histone H3K27 tri-methylation levels. On the other hand, tumor suppressor p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF) mRNA and protein expression were dramatically suppressed. Introduction of small hairpin (sh) RNA-BMI1 or -SUZ12 into BALB/c 3T3 cells resulted in suppression of arsenic-induced transformation. Histone H3K27 tri-methylation returned to normal in BMI1- or SUZ12-knockdown BALB/c 3T3 cells compared with BMI1- or SUZ12-wildtype cells after arsenic exposure. As a consequence, the expression of p16(INK4a) and p19(ARF) was recovered in arsenic-treated BMI1- or SUZ12-knockdown cells. Thus, arsenic-induced cell transformation was blocked by inhibition of PcG function. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the polycomb proteins, BMI1 and SUZ12 are required for cell transformation induced by organic arsenic exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2046931815,"Invasion of human red blood cells by Plasmodium falciparum involves interaction of the merozoite form through proteins on the surface coat. The erythrocyte binding-like protein family functions after initial merozoite interaction by binding via the Duffy binding-like (DBL) domain to receptors on the host red blood cell. The merozoite surface proteins DBL1 and -2 (PfMSPDBL1 and PfMSPDBL2) (PF10_0348 and PF10_0355) are extrinsically associated with the merozoite, and both have a DBL domain in each protein. We expressed and refolded recombinant DBL domains for PfMSPDBL1 and -2 and show they are functional. The red cell binding characteristics of these domains were shown to be similar to full-length forms of these proteins isolated from parasite cultures. Futhermore, metal cofactors were found to enhance the binding of both the DBL domains and the parasite-derived full-length proteins to erythrocytes, which has implications for receptor binding of other DBL-containing proteins in Plasmodium spp. We solved the structure of the erythrocyte-binding DBL domain of PfMSPDBL2 to 2.09 Å resolution and modeled that of PfMSPDBL1, revealing a canonical DBL fold consisting of a boomerang shaped α-helical core formed from three subdomains. PfMSPDBL2 is highly polymorphic, and mapping of these mutations shows they are on the surface, predominantly in the first two domains. For both PfMSPDBL proteins, polymorphic variation spares the cleft separating domains 1 and 2 from domain 3, and the groove between the two major helices of domain 3 extends beyond the cleft, indicating these regions are functionally important and are likely to be associated with the binding of a receptor on the red blood cell."

Additionally, analysis of mixed NDE1-NDEL1 complexes demonstrates that NDE1 and NDEL1 can interact directly. NDE1 (nuclear distribution factor E-homolog 1, or nuclear distribution element 1) and NDEL1 (NDE1-like 1) are highly similar proteins, originating from a common ancestral gene (1Shmueli A. Segal M.

Through their interactions with LIS1 (Lissencephaly 1, encoded by PAFAH1B1) and dynein they play crucial roles in microtubule organization and are required for cell cycle progression and neuronal development (reviewed in Ref. 3Chansard M.

NDE1 (335 amino acid residues) and NDEL1 (345 amino acid residues) both consist of distinct N- and C-terminal regions (Fig. 1, A and B). X-ray crystallography, backed by other biophysical techniques, revealed how the N-terminal region of NDEL1 dimerizes by forming extended, continuous parallel α-helical coiled-coils that account for approximately half the length of the protein (residues 8–167) (Fig. 1C) (5Derewenda U.

Current understanding of the structures of NDE1 and NDEL1 is insufficient to explain important observations made in the recent literature. Notably, each of NDEL1 and NDE1 possess two distinct regions at their N and C termini that interact with intermediate chains of dynein (18Zylkiewicz E. Kijanska M. Choi W.C. Derewenda U. Derewenda Z.S. Stukenberg P.T. The N-terminal coiled-coil of Ndel1 is a regulated scaffold that recruits LIS1 to dynein.J.

Thus, despite being separated by ∼150 amino acids residues in the primary structure, these two regions could be juxtaposed because of the overall architecture of the folded protein. Given that the disordered C-terminal regions are unlikely to make good targets for crystallization, we have combined negative stain EM with a strategy of chemical cross-linking, MS, and database searching (6Maiolica A.

This extends a previous application of the cross-linking/MS methodology to a truncated fragment of NDEL1 (6Maiolica A. Cittaro D. Borsotti D. Sennels L. Ciferri C. Tarricone C. Musacchio A.

We found that the C-terminal region of each protein bends back on to the main coiled-coil domain; this observation sheds light on the molecular architecture of the complex between NDE1, NDEL1, and dynein that is crucial for mitosis and neurodevelopment. Constructs encoding V5-tagged NDE1 and NDEL1 have been described previously (22Bradshaw N.J. Christie S. Soares D.C. Carlyle B.C. Porteous D.J. Millar J.K. NDE1 and NDEL1. Multimerisation, alternate splicing and DISC1 interaction.Neurosci. Lett. 2009; 449: 228-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Open reading frames from these were subcloned in a two-step PCR process that introduced an N-terminal His6 tag. The primers used were: CCGAAAACCTGTATTTTCAGGGCGAGGACTCCGGAAAGACTTTCAG (NDE1, first step 5′), GGGGCCGAAAACCTGTATTTTCAGGGCGATGGTGAAGATATACCAG (NDEL1, first step 5′), GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCCTAGCAGGAGCTGGACGACCTGGTTG (NDE1, both steps, 3′), GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCCTACACACTGAGAGGCAGCATACCCG (NDEL1, both steps 3′), and GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCGAAGGAGATATACATATGTCGTACTACCATCACCATCACCATCACGATTACGATATCCCAACGACCGAAAACCTGTATTTTCAGGGC (NDE1/NDEL1, second step 5′). The clones were sequentially transferred first into the pDONR-221 entry vector and then into pDEST-14 destination vector using BP clonase and LR clonase (Invitrogen). Correct cloning and insertion was confirmed by sequencing. To generate recombinant NDE1 or NDEL1 constructs were transformed into C41 (DE3) cells (Lucigen Corporation, Middleton, WI) and grown in either LB (NDE1) or 2×TY (NDEL1) medium containing 100 μg/ml carbenicillin to A600 of ∼0.6. Recombinant protein production was induced by adding 1 mm IPTG and incubating at 30 °C for 3 h with shaking at 250 rpm.

Bacterial pellets were extracted, resuspended in 30 ml of immobilized metal affinity chromatography buffer (25 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.4) plus Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) per liter of original culture and lysed using a TS Cell Disruptor (Constant Systems) at 172 MPa. The lysates were centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 1 h, and the resultant supernatants were passed through 0.2-μm Whatman cellulose nitrate membrane filters. The filtered supernatant was then loaded onto a 1-ml HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare), charged with 1 ml of 100 mm nickel chloride, using an ÄKTApurifier (GE Healthcare). Bound proteins were eluted using immobilized metal affinity chromatography buffer containing an imidazole gradient rising from 20 to 500 mm over 20 column volumes. Fractions containing recombinant NDE1 or NDEL1-sized bands (confirmed by SDS-PAGE) were further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a 320-ml HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 preparative grade column (GE Healthcare) and PBS, pH 7.4 (for cross-linking analysis), or 25 mm HEPES, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (for electron microscopy analysis). Where appropriate, protein fractions were concentrated using Vivaspin Concentrators (Sartorius Stedim Biotech). For each recombinant protein, identity was confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Applied Biosystems). The mean hydrodynamic radii of the purified proteins were determined by dynamic light scattering using a Zetasizer auto plate sampler (Malvern Instruments Ltd.) at 10 °C with a 830-nm laser. Each dynamic light scattering measurement was performed on protein solution that was initially centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 rpm. For determination of secondary structure, protein was buffer-exchanged into 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, using pre-equilibrated PD-10 columns (GE Healthcare). Protein concentration was determined using a V-550 UV-visible spectrophotometer (JASCO) based on absorbance at 280 nm and the theoretical extinction coefficient of the respective protein sequence. Circular dichroism (CD) analysis was performed on a J-810 Spectropolarimeter (JASCO) at 25 °C using a path length of 1 mm, over the far UV range 185–280 nm. Five scans were acquired and averaged for each CD spectrum using the following parameters: data pitch, 0.1 nm; bandwidth, 1 nm; scan speed, 10 nm/min; and response time, 2 s). Solvent correction was achieved by subtraction of a spectrum of the buffer solution acquired with identical parameters. Cross-linking experiments were carried out using bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as cross-linker in a 1:1000 protein:BS3 molar ratio by incubating for 2 h on ice. The reactions were quenched by the addition of 2.73 m ammonium bicarbonate in a 10:1 molar ratio with BS3 and incubation on ice for a further hour. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and bands corresponding to cross-linked complexes were excised, and the proteins therein were reduced using 100 mm DTT for 30 min at room temperature, alkylated with 55 mm iodoacetamide for 30 min in the dark at room temperature, and digested using 12.5 ng/μl trypsin (sequencing grade; Promega) overnight at 37 °C (6Maiolica A.

Two heterotetramer NDE1-NDEL1 models were built based on the (shorter) tetramer and the (longer) tetramer sequence generated by symmetry operations, as described previously (9Bradshaw N.J.

Two sequences each for NDE1 and NDEL1 were aligned appropriately (Fig. 1A) with the template NDEL1 sequences (2V66 and 2V71) to form an anti-parallel arrangement. Thirty models were generated corresponding to each of the alignments, and the ones with the lowest objective function score (29Sali A. Blundell T.L. Comparative protein modelling by satisfaction of spatial restraints.J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10512) Google Scholar) were selected as the representative NDE1-NDEL1 model in each case. The models were checked for valid stereochemistry using PROCHECK (30Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M.

Graphics. 1990; 8 (29): 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3363) Google Scholar). NDE1 and NDEL1 protein samples were diluted to between 3 and 18 μg/ml before being placed on thin continuous carbon film electron microscopy grids and stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate solution. To rule out DNA contamination for observation of high molecular weight species, NDE1 and NDEL1 protein (0.15 mg/ml) were independently incubated for 1 h at 37 ºC with 1.3 Kunitz units of DNAse1 (Sigma) in a buffer containing 20 mm MgCl2 and then diluted to 10 μg/ml protein immediately before being prepared for EM (as above). The grids were imaged in low dose mode using a F20 electron microscope (FEI, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) fitted with an 8192 × 8192 digital camera (F816; TVIPS GmbH, Germany). The images were collected at a nominal magnification of 29,000 at 200 kV (the calibrated scale is 0.269 nm/pixel). The data were collected only in thinly stained areas to maximize the contrast from the particles. The particles were manually selected (705 for NDE1 and 1299 for NDEL1), normalized, and band pass-filtered before being input into an iterative reference-free alignment and classification algorithm (EMAN (32Ludtke S.J.

Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar)). The class averages include ∼40 images/class. Recombinant full-length human NDE1 and NDEL1, incorporating an N-terminal His6 tag, were each purified from bacterial lysates using immobilized metal affinity chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography. The two purifications yielded similar size exclusion chromatograms that each featured three peaks (Fig. 2A, referred to as P1, P2, and P3) all containing full-length NDE1 or NDEL1, as determined by mass spectrometry. The elution positions of these peaks were approximately similar, but the relative abundance of each peak varied between preparations. Dynamic light scattering indicated that both P2 and P3 contained discrete oligomers of defined size (Fig. 2B), whereas P1 consisted of highly multimeric protein. We therefore focused on P2 and P3. In some preparations an even higher molecular weight (MWt) peak of aggregated protein was observed. CD revealed that, for both NDE1 and NDEL1, the components of P2 and P3 were predominantly α-helical in composition: both exhibit near identical pronounced double minima at ∼208 and ∼222 nm and one positive peak at ∼192 nm in the far-UV range, characteristic of folded proteins with high α-helical content (Fig. 2C). This agrees with previous work showing that α-helical coiled-coils predominate in the NDEL1 N-terminal domain (5Derewenda U. Tarricone C. Choi W.C. Cooper D.R. Lukasik S. Perrina F. Tripathy A.

https://openalex.org/W2035245937,"Migfilin is critical for cell shape and motile regulation. However, its pathological role in glioma is unknown. Using an immunohistochemical staining assay, we demonstrate that there is a significant correlation between expression of Migfilin and pathological tumor grade in 217 clinical glioma samples. High Migfilin expression is associated with poor prognosis for patients with glioma. Investigation of the molecular mechanism shows that Migfilin promotes migration and invasion in glioma cells. Moreover, Migfilin positively modulates the expression and activity of epidermal growth factor receptor, and Migfilin-mediated migration and invasion depend on epidermal growth factor receptor-induced PLC-γ and STAT3-signaling pathways. Our results may provide significant clinical application, including use of Migfilin as a molecular marker in glioma for early diagnosis and as an indicator of prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2088846316,"Recent high resolution x-ray structures of the β2-adrenergic receptor confirmed a close salt-bridge interaction between the suspected micro-switch residue ArgIII:26 (Arg3.50) and the neighboring AspIII:25 (Asp3.49). However, neither the expected ""ionic lock"" interactions between ArgIII:26 and GluVI:-06 (Glu6.30) in the inactive conformation nor the interaction with TyrV:24 (Tyr5.58) in the active conformation were observed in the x-ray structures. Here we find through molecular dynamics simulations, after removal of the stabilizing T4 lysozyme, that the expected salt bridge between ArgIII:26 and GluVI:-06 does form relatively easily in the inactive receptor conformation. Moreover, mutational analysis of GluVI:-06 in TM-VI and the neighboring AspIII:25 in TM-III demonstrated that these two residues do function as locks for the inactive receptor conformation as we observed increased G(s) signaling, arrestin mobilization, and internalization upon alanine substitutions. Conversely, TyrV:24 appears to play a role in stabilizing the active receptor conformation as loss of function of G(s) signaling, arrestin mobilization, and receptor internalization was observed upon alanine substitution of TyrV:24. The loss of function of the TyrV:24 mutant could partly be rescued by alanine substitution of either AspIII:25 or GluVI:-06 in the double mutants. Surprisingly, removal of the side chain of the ArgIII:26 micro-switch itself had no effect on G(s) signaling and internalization and only reduced arrestin mobilization slightly. It is suggested that ArgIII:26 is equally important for stabilizing the inactive and the active conformation through interaction with key residues in TM-III, -V, and -VI, but that the ArgIII:26 micro-switch residue itself apparently is not essential for the actual G protein activation."
https://openalex.org/W2045929345,"Calcyon, once known for interacting directly with the dopamine D(1) receptor (D(1)DR), is implicated in various neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Although its direct interaction with D(1)DR has been shown to be misinterpreted, it still plays important roles in D(1)DR signaling. Here, we found that calcyon interacts with the PSD-95 and subsequently forms a ternary complex with D(1)DR through PSD-95. Calcyon is phosphorylated on Ser-169 by the PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or by the D(1)DR agonist SKF-81297, and its phosphorylation increases its association with PSD-95 and recruitment to the cell surface. Interestingly, the internalization of D(1)DR at the cell surface was enhanced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and SKF-81297 in the presence of calcyon, but not in the presence of its S169A phospho-deficient mutant, suggesting that the phosphorylation of calcyon and the internalization of the surface D(1)DR are tightly correlated. Our results suggest that calcyon regulates D(1)DR trafficking by forming a ternary complex with D(1)DR through PSD-95 and thus possibly linking glutamatergic and dopamine receptor signalings. This also raises the possibility that a novel ternary complex could represent a potential therapeutic target for the modulation of related neuropsychiatric disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2090926282,"Multiple transmembrane (TM) segments line the pore of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator Cl(-) channel; however, the relative alignment of these TMs and their relative movements during channel gating are unknown. To gain three-dimensional structural information on the outer pore, we have used patch clamp recording to study the proximity of pairs of cysteine side chains introduced into TMs 6 and 11, using both disulfide cross-linking and Cd(2+) coordination. Following channel activation, disulfide bonds could apparently be formed between three cysteine pairs (of 15 studied): R334C/T1122C, R334C/G1127C, and T338C/S1118C. To examine the state dependence of cross-linking, we combined these cysteine mutations with a nucleotide-binding domain mutation (E1371Q) that stabilizes the channel open state. Investigation of the effects of the E1371Q mutation on disulfide bond formation and Cd(2+) coordination suggests that although R334C/T1122C and T338C/S1118C are closer together in the channel open state, R334C/G1127C are close together and can form disulfide bonds only when the channel is closed. These results provide important new information on the three-dimensional structure of the outer mouth of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator channel pore: TMs 6 and 11 are close enough together to form disulfide bonds in both open and closed channels. Moreover, the altered relative locations of residues in open and in closed channels that we infer allow us to propose that channel opening and closing may be associated with a relative translational movement of TMs 6 and 11, with TM6 moving ""down"" (toward the cytoplasm) during channel opening."
https://openalex.org/W1989862779,"CaiT is a homotrimeric antiporter that exchanges l-carnitine (CRN) with γ-butyrobetaine (GBB) across the bacterial membrane.

One of the reported binding sites is the counterpart of the primary site observed in structurally similar transporters. However, the mechanism and pathway(s) of CRN/GBB unbinding and translocation, or even the ability of the substrates to dislodge from the reported binding sites, are yet to be determined.

In all three resolved structures, CaiT has an inward-facing conformation, i.e. its central region is exposed to the cytoplasm. The substrate-bound structures were derived from Escherichia coli (EcCaiT), and the substrate-free structures were derived from Proteus mirabilis (PmCaiT) (8Schulze S. Köster S. Geldmacher U.

The backbone conformation is also similar to that of the crystallized sodium/betaine transporter BetP, another member of the family of betaine/choline/carnitine transporters (10Ziegler C. Bremer E. Krämer R. The BCCT family of carriers: from physiology to crystal structure.Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 78: 13-34PubMed Google Scholar), although the primary site for betaine binding is occluded in BetP (11Ressl S. Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Vonrhein C. Ott V. Ziegler C. Molecular basis of transport and regulation in the Na+/betaine symporter BetP.Nature. 2009; 458: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The crystal structures show that CaiT forms a homotrimer (Fig. 1, A and B), a finding supported by biochemical data (12Vinothkumar K.R. Raunser S. Jung H. Kühlbrandt W.

Each monomer is composed of 12 transmembrane (TM) helices, with the transport core formed by TM3–12. The CRN-bound structure contains four CRN molecules in each of the three subunits. The corresponding binding sites are labeled 1–4 in Fig. 1C, and we will refer to the carnitines originally bound to those sites as CRN1–CRN4. Site 1 is the so-called primary binding site, equivalent to that of leucine or galactose in the structurally homologous leucine transporter (LeuT) (13Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Crystal structure of a bacterial homologue of Na+/Cl−-dependent neurotransmitter transporters.Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar) and sodium-coupled galactose symporter (vSGLT) (14Faham S.

The crystal structure of a sodium galactose transporter reveals mechanistic insights into Na+/sugar symport.Science. 2008; 321: 810-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), respectively. As in the related BetP (11Ressl S. Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Vonrhein C. Ott V. Ziegler C. Molecular basis of transport and regulation in the Na+/betaine symporter BetP.Nature. 2009; 458: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), the primary site is a “tryptophan box,” lined by Trp142 and Trp147 at the unwound region of TM4 (green) and Trp323, Trp324, and Tyr327 on the highly strained central part of TM8 (pink) (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S1). Sites 2–4 are secondary binding sites: site 2 is at the base of the IC vestibule, ∼6 Å from the primary site; site 3 is in a shallow cavity on the EC surface ∼12 Å away from the primary site (9Tang L. Bai L. Wang W.H. Jiang T. Crystal structure of the carnitine transporter and insights into the antiport mechanism.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); and site 4 is at the entrance to the IC vestibule, ∼15 Å away from the primary site (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1). The GBB-bound structure contains two substrates only, at sites 1 and 3. The CRN and GBB binding poses at the equivalent sites overlap substantially in space and orientation (supplemental Fig. S1). The cytoplasmic sides of CaiT monomers show a funnel-like cavity ∼25 Å deep and 15 Å wide that narrows down to roughly 7 Å in the center. In BetP, a sodium ion located at the so-called Na1 site coordinates the substrate betaine (11Ressl S. Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Vonrhein C. Ott V. Ziegler C.

In contrast to LeuT, vSGLT, and other structural homologues where transport activity is sodium-dependent, CaiT is sodium-independent, and so neither CaiT structure shows a cation at the Na1 site. Instead, in the GBB-bound structure, the sulfur of a methionine (Met331) is seen in the close proximity of the substrate carboxyl group (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S1). This methionine is conserved in the bacterial CaiT and in the mammalian organic cation/CRN transporters. In the CRN-bound CaiT structure, Met331 sulfur is ∼5 Å away from the carboxyl group of substrates 1 and 2 (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1A). In addition to the Na1 site, a more general cation binding site, referred to as Na2, is shared by several members of LeuT fold family. In LeuT, the Na2 site lies between TM1 and TM8 (13Yamashita A.

Arg262 interacts with residues Cys99 and Thr100 on the unwound portion of TM3 in CRN-bound CaiT (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1) (9Tang L. Bai L. Wang W.H. Jiang T. Crystal structure of the carnitine transporter and insights into the antiport mechanism.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the GBB-bound structure, it interacts with Ala97, Cys99, and Thr100 on TM3, as well as Thr421 on TM10 (8Schulze S. Köster S. Geldmacher U. Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Kühlbrandt W.

As important as these crystal structures are, they represent a few out of many conformations visited by the transporter during the substrate transport/antiport cycle. They are not informative with regard to the mobility of the substrates, the mechanism and pathway(s) of substrate translocation, or the role of specific interactions with neighboring residues in mediating the movement of the substrates into or out of the antiporter. To shed light on such questions, we have used these crystallographic data to construct and simulate the dynamics of the two substrate-bound structures over relatively extensive time periods (up to 400 ns per run) under different conditions. To our knowledge, these are the most extensive simulations reported to date for such a trimeric membrane protein of ∼170 kDa, with explicit water molecules and lipid bilayer (a system of ∼1.7 × 105 atoms). These simulations were made possible upon using the high performance (Terascale) computing resources provided by the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE). Our study provides insights into the mechanism of substrate release to the EC or IC regions by CaiT and highlights the key role of Arg262 near the unwound region of TM3 in facilitating substrate dislocation from the primary binding site. The study thus improves our understanding of the mechanism of action of a structural homologue to the important mammalian neuronal transporters belonging to the neurotransmitter:sodium symporter family, the targets of many natural and synthetic psychoactive drugs. Crystal structures of EcCait in the presence of CRN or GBB (Protein Data Bank (PDB) codes 3HFX and 2WSX, respectively) were placed in a 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine bilayer and solvated in water with 150 mm NaCl. To ensure optimal comparison between the two structures, we opted to construct very similar initial systems and used identical protocols and parameters for equilibration and productive runs. A total of six runs have been performed, the properties of which are listed in supplemental Table S1. The equilibration and simulation protocols are described in detail in the supplemental material. In summary, two sets of three runs were performed, labeled 1a–c and 2a–c, where the respective PDB structures 3HFX and 2WSX were used for the initial coordinates of CaiT atoms, hereafter referred to as conformations (conf) I and II, respectively. Runs a and b were performed with the crystal structure substrates, and run c was performed after swapping the substrates to assess the dependence of the trajectories on the specific protein conformer and substrate. All runs, equilibration and productive, were performed using NAMD (version 2.8) (20Phillips J.C. Braun R. Wang W. Gumbart J. Tajkhorshid E. Villa E. Chipot C. Skeel R.D. Kalé L. Schulten K. Scalable molecular dynamics with NAMD.J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1781-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (13140) Google Scholar) under NPT conditions at 1 atm and 310 K in a flexible cell, with periodic boundary conditions, 2-fs time steps, and rigid bonds for all hydrogen atoms. Particle mesh Ewald summations were adopted for full electrostatic interactions (spacing of 1 Å), along with a 10 Å cutoff distance (switching at 8 Å) for van der Waals and short-range electrostatic interactions. CHARMM36 force-field parameters were used for lipids, and CHARMM27 parameters were used for the protein and water molecules. VMD (version 1.9) (21Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. VMD: visual molecular dynamics.J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (38371) Google Scholar) was used for visualization and construction of the systems and for trajectory analysis. The productive runs 1a, 1c, 2a, and 2c (supplemental Table S1) were unbiased molecular dynamics simulations, whereas in 1b and 2b, the backbone atoms of the residues that make close interatomic contacts (within 5 Å distance, based on conf I) with the substrates (a total of 34 residues) were constrained using spring forces of 10 kcal/(mol Å). The two antiporter systems were highly stable over the entire 400-ns runs in the presence of CRN and GBB (runs 1a and 2a, respectively, supplemental Table S1). The backbone root mean square deviation of the α-helical domains remained smaller than 3 Å for CRN-bound CaiT and smaller than 2 Å for the GBB-bound structure. The most prominent feature was the spontaneous dissociation of the substrates located at the secondary binding sites (CRN2–CRN4) once the constraints imposed during equilibration were released. The rapid displacements of the substrates away from their original (secondary) binding sites are depicted in Fig. 2 by the colored curves. In particular, the diffusion of CRN3 to the EC environment was almost instantaneous (within the first few nanoseconds) for all subunits as was that of GBB3 (Fig. 2, A–C and D–F, for the respective confs I and II; green curves). CRN2 and CRN4 also exhibited fast (within tens of nanoseconds) unbinding and release to the cytoplasm (red and blue curves, respectively). On the other hand, the substrates bound to the primary site 1 displayed a different behavior in both CRN-bound and GBB-bound structures and will be the focus of the present study. As a further validation of the rapid unbinding and release properties of CRN2–CRN4, we generated two additional trajectories of 100 ns each (runs 1b and 2b, supplemental Table S1). The goal in this new set of simulations was to assess whether the unbinding and release within 1–10 nanoseconds from the secondary sites required accommodating motions from the part of the protein. To this aim, the backbone atoms of substrate-coordinating residues were spatially constrained, whereas their side chains were allowed to move. In parallel with previous observations, all substrates at sites 2–4 left the antiporter completely (supplemental Fig. S2). The main difference was a time delay in the release of CRN2 and CRN3 (whereas CRN4 remained unaffected). In particular, the CRN2 bound to subunit B (supplemental Fig. S2B, red curve) took more than 80 ns to be released, presumably due to the spatial constraints imposed on on-pathway residues. However, the eventual release of all substrates in sites 2–4 within 100 ns, even in the absence of accommodating rearrangements by the CaiT backbone, suggests that the present conformers are predisposed to substrate release, and the unbinding from the secondary sites involves only low energy barriers, if any. We next examined the behavior of the substrates bound to the primary sites. The corresponding trajectories (Fig. 2, A–C for CRN1 and D–F for GBB1; black curves) show that four out of six substrates (those on subunits A–C in both structures) find their way out to the cytoplasm, but this process takes at least an order of magnitude longer time when compared with that of substrates bound to secondary sites. The subunit B substrates in both confs I and II remained bound for 400 ns. Notably, GBB1 in subunit A was released at 380 ns only, suggesting that the timescale reached by current terascale computations is just on the verge of possibly detecting translocation events from the primary sites. We further observed whether backbone motions played a role in enabling the dissociation of the substrates from the primary binding site and in facilitating their translocation across the protein. In the presence of constraints, only one (CRN1 in subunit C) out of six substrates was observed to unbind and reached the cytoplasm (supplemental Fig. S2C, black curve). All others remained tightly bound at/near their primary site, revealing the functional significance of protein backbone accommodating motions. Based on our simulations, it is difficult to assess whether CaiT has different affinities for the two substrates. This is due to the small number of unbinding events and the fact that dissociation from only two out of three subunits was observed for each substrate in the unbiased simulations. However, it is worth noting that all substrates (except for CRN3) move toward the cytoplasm, not to the EC region, suggesting an intrinsic property of the inward-facing conformation of CaiT. In contrast to other transporters where water influx plays a role in dislocating the substrate, the solvation of the primary binding site does not appear to precipitate substrate unbinding in CaiT. The present simulations suggest that there was practically no energetic barrier to water influx into the primary site. Water molecules could reach the site even before the constraints adopted for energy minimization were lifted, and the substrates interacted with ∼8–9 water molecules most of the time. This is true for all subunits regardless of whether the substrate was able to leave or not and regardless of the constraints on the backbone atoms. In supplemental Fig. S2, A and D, the inset panels illustrate the hydration of the primary binding site early on during the simulations, which, contrary to expectation, does not trigger the dislocation of the substrate. In harmony with this is the observation that at the primary site/pocket, there is enough space for the substrate to move 4–5 Å away from its original pose, an observation made for all substrates in the confines of site 1. To determine whether a preferred pathway of substrate translocation from the primary binding site to the IC region exists, we evaluated the closest distances of approach and pairwise interaction energies between the substrates and select on-pathway residues observed during the course of simulations. We will focus on the substrates that are released to the cytoplasm, i.e. CRN1, CRN2, CRN4, and GBB1. The first two residues that are encountered by CRN1 and GBB1 upon direct downward translation into the IC region are Gln330 and Met331 on TM8, directly below Tyr327 that lines the binding pocket (Fig. 1). Both residues are close to CRN2 in conf I, suggesting that they might act as attractors for substrate channeling. To examine whether they play a role in dislodging the substrate from site 1 to site 2, we calculated the interaction energy between each substrate and either of these two residues during each unbinding event from site 1. Only weak interactions were observed, in accord with the relatively fast unbinding of CRN2 in the original structure (supplemental Fig. S3). These observations suggest that these residues may promote the movement of the substrates toward the IC region, but do not hold back their translocation toward the IC cavity. In the absence of any constraints (run 1a), CRN1 spend ∼30–50 ns in the confines of site 1. During this period, CRN2 and CRN4 are dislocated from their binding sites and released to the cell interior. Strikingly, the translocation of CRN1 does not occur by a smooth diffusion, but by almost hopping from one site to another. For example, CRN1 in subunit A is dislodged around t = 28 ns from site 1, to settle shortly in the IC cavity in the vicinity of site 4, where it resides for ∼30 ns, prior to its complete release to the cytoplasm (Fig. 3 and supplemental Movie S1). Likewise, CRN1 in subunit C follows approximately the same trajectory, with residence times in the respective sites being about 50 and 10 ns, respectively. In both cases, the sites 4 (and 2) are vacated by CRN4 (and CRN2) prior to the translocation of CRN1 from site 1. In the newly “settled” region, CRN1 is mainly coordinated by Arg170 on the loop connecting TM4 and TM5 and by Arg337 at the IC end of TM8. This behavior is consistently reproduced in both constraint-free (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. S4A) and constrained (Fig. 4B) runs.FIGURE 4Time evolution of the interactions with basic residues during the unbinding and release of CRN1 and GBB1. Plots indicate the interaction energy (kcal/mol) of the leaving CRN1 (A and B) or GBB1 (C) with each of six arginines located in the cytoplasmic cavity of CaiT.

D shows the position of these residues in the CRN-bound structure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Despite the close similarity in the binding poses of CRN1 and GBB1, GBB1 consistently chose a path different from CRN1 in exiting the primary site. This path is characterized by major involvement of Arg262. Arg262 is located on TM7 just across the unwound part of TM3 and in the vicinity of TM10 (similar to the position of Na2 between the equivalent helices TM1 and TM8 of LeuT). Its side chain is positioned ∼9 Å away from the carboxyl group of CRN2 and ∼13 and 11 Å away from CRN1 and GBB1, respectively. Notably, a strong attraction (salt bridge) between GBB1 carboxylate and Arg262 guanidinium group, mediated by 3 serines (Ser101 and Ser98 on TM3 unwound region, and Ser259 on TM7), essentially determines GBB1 translocation path (Fig. 5 and supplemental Movie S2). This behavior was consistently repeated in both events of unbinding in the absence of constraints (Fig. 4C and supplemental Fig. S4B). The key role of Arg262 in driving substrate permeation was specific to GBB in conf II as little or no such interaction was observed with five other basic residues located within the IC cavity (arginines 170, 256, 337, 340, and 449) (Fig. 4 and supplemental Fig. S4) or with CRN1 in conf I as shown previously. We also examined the potential role of acidic residues Glu85, Glu167, Asp260, Glu437, and Asp440 at the IC cavity (supplemental Fig. S5). Although Glu437 and Glu85 temporarily interacted with the CRNs near site 4, the total interaction energy of the substrate with these amino acids was significantly weaker than those with basic residues (supplemental Fig. S5), further supporting the distinctive function of Arg262 in conf II. Different unbinding pathways for different substrates from the same site can arise from differences in the substrates or in the protein at/close to the binding site, or in both. CRN differs from GBB by the presence of a hydroxyl group on the central carbon atom (Fig. 2). However, the presence/absence of a polar group seems unlikely to contribute to the differential unbinding pathway considering that the observed substrate-protein interactions are determined mainly by charged groups in each. In addition, the Arg262 side chain is located at the same distance from the binding sites in the two conformations and has a similar orientation toward the primary binding site. A closer look at the vicinity of the binding site between the two crystallized structures reveals, however, an interesting difference at the unwound helical part of TM3, which lies between the substrate at site 1 and Arg262. In conf I, this loop shields Arg262 from the substrate, whereas in conf II, it is shifted away from the space in between. This unwound part includes the segment Ser98-Cys99-Thr100-Ser101, with the most pronounced difference at the position of Thr100, which we will refer to as pose I or II (Fig. 6A). In addition to this structural difference, this portion of TM3 exhibits distinctive intrins"

GPSM3 acts through its two GoLoco motifs to exert GDP dissociation inhibitor activity over Gα(i) subunits; recently revealed is the existence of an additional regulatory site within GPSM3 directed toward monomeric Gβ subunits during their biosynthesis. Here, using in silico and proteomic approaches, we have found that GPSM3 also interacts directly with numerous members of the 14-3-3 protein family. This interaction is dependent on GPSM3 phosphorylation, creating a mode II consensus 14-3-3 binding site. 14-3-3 binding to the N-terminal disordered region of GPSM3 confers stabilization from protein degradation. The complex of GPSM3 and 14-3-3 is exclusively cytoplasmic, and both moieties mutually control their exclusion from the nucleus. Phosphorylation of GPSM3 by a proline-directed serine/threonine kinase and the resultant association of 14-3-3 is the first description of post-translational regulation of GPSM3 subcellular localization, a process that likely regulates important spatio-temporal aspects of G-protein-coupled receptor signaling modulation by GPSM3."
https://openalex.org/W2076710144,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains three NADH/NAD+ kinases, one of which is localized in mitochondria and phosphorylates NADH in preference to NAD+. Strand et al. reported that a yeast mutation in POS5, which encodes the mitochondrial NADH kinase, is a mutator, specific for mitochondrial genes (Strand, M. K., Stuart, G. R., Longley, M. J., Graziewicz, M. A., Dominick, O. C., and Copeland, W. C. (2003) Eukaryot. Cell 2, 809–820). Because of the involvement of NADPH in deoxyribonucleotide biosynthesis, we asked whether mitochondria in a pos5 deletion mutant contain abnormal deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pools. We found the pools of the four dNTPs to be more than doubled in mutant mitochondrial extracts relative to wild-type mitochondrial extracts. This might partly explain the mitochondrial mutator phenotype. However, the loss of antioxidant protection is also likely to be significant. To this end, we measured pyridine nucleotide pools in mutant and wild-type mitochondrial extracts and found NADPH levels to be diminished by ∼4-fold in Δpos5 mitochondrial extracts, with NADP+ diminished to a lesser degree. Our data suggest that both dNTP abnormalities and lack of antioxidant protection contribute to elevated mitochondrial gene mutagenesis in cells lacking the mitochondrial NADH kinase. The data also confirm previous reports of the specific function of Pos5p in mitochondrial NADP+ and NADPH biosynthesis.

The data also confirm previous reports of the specific function of Pos5p in mitochondrial NADP+ and NADPH biosynthesis.

NADPH, the product of the NADH kinase reaction, is involved in dNTP biosynthesis in at least two ways: 1) as the ultimate electron donor supporting the ribonucleotide reductase reaction and 2) as the reductant to convert a methylene to a methyl group in the thymidylate synthase reaction. An informative way to determine whether the POS5 mutation affects mutagenesis through dNTP metabolic abnormalities is to measure dNTP pools directly in extracts of isolated yeast mitochondria. We report these measurements here. In addition, Strand et al. (5Strand M.K. Stuart G.R. Longley M.J. Graziewicz M.A. Dominick O.C. Copeland W.C.

Because this evident lack of antioxidant protection would most likely result from insufficient NADPH synthesis in pos5 mutant mitochondria, we have tested this premise directly through analysis of pyridine nucleotide pools in isolated yeast mitochondria.

When grown to saturation, the culture was diluted 100-fold into lactate medium (3 g/liter yeast extract, 0.5 g/liter glucose, 0.5 g/liter CaCl2·2H2O, 0.5 g/liter NaCl, 0.9 g/liter MgCl2·6H2O, 1.0 g/liter KH2PO4, 4 g/liter NH4Cl, 24 ml of 85% dl-lactic acid, and 8 g/liter NaOH, with pH adjusted to 5.5 with NaOH). Growth with aeration was carried out overnight (∼15 h) at 30 °C, by which time the culture was in late logarithmic phase. The culture was chilled by immersion in crushed ice, following which cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C. Cells were lysed, and mitochondria were prepared by differential centrifugation in sorbitol buffer as described by Glick and Pon (9Glick B.S. Pon L. Isolation of highly purified mitochondria from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). A small amount of the initial mitochondrial supernatant was saved for analysis of nucleotides in the cytosolic fraction. Immediately after isolation, the mitochondrial pellet was mixed with 1 ml of ice-cold sterile water, and 1.5 ml of ice-cold methanol was added. For analysis of cytosolic dNTPs 1.0 ml of cytosolic extract was mixed with 1.5 ml of ice-cold methanol. Samples were vortexed and placed at −20 °C, with occasional mixing, for ∼1 h. The extracts were next heated for 3 min in a boiling water bath and then centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes and dried under vacuum. Each residue was dissolved in a minimal volume of water and diluted to an appropriate level for analysis. The dNTPs were analyzed by the DNA polymerase-based assay as described (10Mathews C.K.

The mitochondrial pellet was suspended in 250 μl of 0.05 m NaOH and 1 mm EDTA and then split into two 100-μl aliquots. To one aliquot was added 100 μl of 0.1 m HCl (acidic extract for measuring NADP+ and NAD+). The remainder was the alkaline extract (for measuring NADPH and NADH). Both extracts were incubated for 30 min at 60 °C to destroy the other components (NADPH and NADH in the acid extract and NADP+ and NAD+ in the alkaline extract). The samples were neutralized either with 25 μl of 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.1) and 25 μl of 0.05 m HCl for the alkaline extract or with 50 μl of 0.4 m Tris base for the acidic extract. The cytosolic fraction (250 μl) was mixed with 250 μl of 0.1 m NaOH and 2 mm EDTA and split into two 200-μl aliquots.

These were incubated for 30 min at 60 °C as described above. Extracts were neutralized either with 50 μl of 0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.1) and 50 μl of 0.1 m HCl for the alkaline extract or with 100 μl of 0.4 m Tris base for the acidic extract. Enzymes used in the cycling and indicator reactions were obtained from Sigma, with the exception of glutamate-oxaloacetate aminotransferase, which was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Alcohol dehydrogenase was Sigma grade A-3263, offered especially for this purpose. For the cycling reaction, 5 μl of sample or standard (0–5 pmol of NADP+) was mixed with 100 μl of cycling reagent (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 25 mm ammonium acetate, 0.01% (w/v) BSA, 7.4 mm α-ketoglutarate, 5 mm glucose 6-phosphate, 0.1 mm ADP, 1 unit/reaction glutamate dehydrogenase, and 0.6 unit/reaction glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase).

Incubation was carried out for 10 min at room temperature, and the NADH formed was measured at 340 nm. We expected the perturbation of mitochondrial pyridine nucleotide metabolism to affect the pool sizes of dNTPs within the mitochondrion because NADPH is involved directly in the dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase cycle and more indirectly in ribonucleotide reduction through reduction of oxidized glutaredoxin or thioredoxin. The extent to which these reactions occur within yeast mitochondria is not clear. In mammalian mitochondria, thymidylate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase have recently been shown to exist and to function (14Anderson D.D. Quintero C.M. Stover P.J. Identification of a de novo thymidylate biosynthesis pathway in mammalian mitochondria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 15163-15168Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and preliminary data from our laboratory support the existence of a mitochondrial ribonucleotide reductase (15Mathews C.K. Song S. Maintaining precursor pools for mitochondrial DNA replication.FASEB J. 2007; 21: 2294-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Comparable experiments have not been done with yeast. When we analyzed yeast mitochondrial extracts, we did see an effect of the pos5 mutation on dNTP pools. As shown in Fig. 1, the dNTP pools were more than twice as high in Δpos5 mitochondrial extracts as in WT mitochondrial extracts (with all four p values <0.02). No such effect was seen upon measurement of the cytosolic dNTP pools (Fig. 2), where the dNTP levels in the post-mitochondrial supernatant were roughly equal when WT and pos5 mutant extracts were compared. The variability of the cytosolic dNTP measurements was considerably higher than that of the mitochondrial measurements recorded in Fig. 1. We do not know the reason for this difference, but the critical mitochondrial measurements do support an approximate doubling of dNTP pools in mutant relative to WT mitochondria, and the data of Fig. 2 are consistent with the conclusion that cytosolic pools do not differ significantly between mutant and WT cells.FIGURE 2Yeast cytosolic dNTP pools. Data represent means ± S.D. from six independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In considering the dNTP measurements recorded in this study, we must take into account a source of error in the DNA polymerase-based dNTP assay. Ferraro et al. (16Ferraro P. Franzolin E. Pontarin G. Reichard P. Bianchi V. Quantitation of cellular deoxynucleoside triphosphates.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: e85Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) reported that the Klenow fragment, which we used as our polymerase source, has relaxed specificity and can incorporate CTP and GTP at high concentrations, leading to possible overestimation of dCTP and dGTP, respectively. We confirmed this finding (3Wheeler L.J. Mathews C.K. Nucleoside triphosphate pool asymmetry in mammalian mitochondria.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 16992-16996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) but found the artifact to be a significant source of error only at rNTP/dNTP ratios >100. However, to determine whether our dGTP or dCTP levels were overestimated, we measured rNTP pools in extracts of both mutant and WT mitochondria (Table 1). From these values and from the dNTP pools recorded in Fig. 1, we estimated the [GTP]/[dGTP] ratios to be 143 and 105 for WT and mutant mitochondria, respectively, and the [CTP]/[dCTP] ratios to be 126 and 89 for WT and mutant mitochondria, respectively. In our hands (3Wheeler L.J. Mathews C.K. Nucleoside triphosphate pool asymmetry in mammalian mitochondria.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 16992-16996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the dCTP assay is more sensitive than the dGTP assay to this source of error. With all four rNTP/dNTP ratios lying near 100, we conclude that the dGTP levels we have determined are not significantly affected by GTP in the extracts, whereas dCTP may be overestimated by ∼30% in both mitochondrial extracts. Because dATP and dTTP measurements are not affected by this artifact and dGTP only minimally, the general conclusion that dNTP levels in pos5 mutant mitochondria are about twice those in WT mitochondria appears justified.TABLE 1Mitochondrial rNTP poolsYeast strainMitochondrial rNTP poolATPCTPGTPUTPnmol/mg proteinWT1.520.440.700.77pos5 mutant2.330.661.091.40 Open table in a new tab An interesting feature of the mitochondrial dNTP pools is that we did not observe a pronounced asymmetry, with dGTP in great excess, as we have observed for mitochondrial pools in rat tissues (3Wheeler L.J. Mathews C.K. Nucleoside triphosphate pool asymmetry in mammalian mitochondria.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 16992-16996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The data of Fig. 1 show that, in WT yeast mitochondria, dTTP is the most abundant dNTP, with a pool size about double that of dGTP, the second most abundant nucleotide. At present, we cannot explain why the pos5 mutation causes uniform expansion of mitochondrial dNTP pools; with an expected defect in NADPH biosynthesis, we might have expected the opposite result. However, we note that Strand et al. (5Strand M.K. Stuart G.R. Longley M.J. Graziewicz M.A. Dominick O.C. Copeland W.C. POS5 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a mitochondrial NADH kinase required for stability of mitochondrial DNA.Eukaryot.

It would be of interest to know whether the dNTP accumulation reported here plays any role in the DNA accumulation in mutant mitochondria. Again, this observation seems somewhat counterintuitive. To what extent might a doubling of the four dNTP pools explain the mutator phenotype resulting from the pos5 mutation? Previously, we showed that small uniform increases in dNTP concentrations have a disproportionate effect in stimulating mutagenesis (17Wheeler L.J. Rajagopal I. Mathews C.K.

In Escherichia coli, a 2-fold expansion of dNTP pools caused by ribonucleotide reductase overexpression was correlated with a 30-fold increase in frequency of mutation to rifampicin resistance (see Table 3 of Ref. 17Wheeler L.J. Rajagopal I. Mathews C.K. Stimulation of mutagenesis by proportional deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate accumulation in Escherichia coli.DNA Repair. 2005; 4: 1450-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We ascribed this phenomenon to a next-nucleotide effect, with increased dNTP levels globally favoring chain extension over proofreading of replication errors. Similar findings were reported by Gon et al. (18Gon S. Napolitano R. Rocha W. Coulon S. Fuchs R.P. Increase in dNTP pool size during the DNA damage response plays a key role in spontaneous and induced mutagenesis in Escherichia coli.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 19311-19316Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), who found that proportional dNTP accumulation during the DNA damage response in E. coli promoted both spontaneous and induced mutagenesis. Consistent with the idea that proportional dNTP accumulations inhibit proofreading, several investigators have reported that Km values for chain extension from a mismatched 3′ terminus by eukaryotic DNA polymerases are orders of magnitude higher than those for extension from a matched 3′ terminus. For example, Perrino and Loeb (19Perrino F.W. Loeb L.A. Differential extension of 3′ mispairs is a major contributor to the high fidelity of calf thymus DNA polymerase α.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2898-2905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported the Km for extension from a matched terminus for calf thymus DNA polymerase α to be 0.6 μm and Km values for various mismatches to range from 250 to 5700 μm. For Drosophila polymerase α, Km values for extension from matched termini ranged from 0.2 to 2.2 μm, whereas Km values for extension from mismatched termini ranged from 22 to 4760 μm (20Mendelman L.V. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. Base mispair extension kinetics: comparison of DNA polymerase α and reverse transcriptase.J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2338-2346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More such data are reviewed in Ref. 17Wheeler L.J. Rajagopal I. Mathews C.K. Stimulation of mutagenesis by proportional deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate accumulation in Escherichia coli.DNA Repair. 2005; 4: 1450-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar. In rat liver, our measurements of mitochondrial dNTP pools ranged from 1.5 to 18 pmol/mg of protein, corresponding to concentrations of ∼2–20 μm (3Wheeler L.J. Mathews C.K. Nucleoside triphosphate pool asymmetry in mammalian mitochondria.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 16992-16996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). If the corresponding values for yeast mitochondrial dNTPs are comparable, we can estimate that the mitochondrial replisome in vivo is operating in the zero-order range for correct chain extension and in the first-order range for extension from a mismatch. If so, doubling the concentration of one dNTP would double the ratio of mismatched to matched extension rates. If the activity of the proofreading exonuclease is not directly affected by dNTP concentration, then the effect of doubling the mismatched extension rate is to approximately double the replication error rate, with a corresponding increase in mutagenesis. This is illustrated schematically in Fig. 3 for a hypothetical replisome with average Km values of 1 μm for chain extension from a matched terminus and 1 mm for extension from a mismatched terminus, values close to those cited above. Under these conditions, doubling the dNTP concentration will double the rate of extension from a mismatch, with no effect on correct chain extension, which is already operating at Vmax. Each of the four dNTP pools is doubled (or somewhat more) as a result of the pos5 mutation, and the effects on replication error frequency should be additive because error-prone extension from the mismatches results from independent events. Hence, as a rough approximation, doubling each of the four dNTP pools could account for an 8-fold increase in mutation rate. The data of Strand et al. (5Strand M.K. Stuart G.R. Longley M.J. Graziewicz M.A. Dominick O.C. Copeland W.C. POS5 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a mitochondrial NADH kinase required for stability of mitochondrial DNA.Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 809-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) indicate that the pos5 mutation stimulated mutagenesis by 50-fold, suggesting that the dNTP pool size changes shown here can account for some (but not all) of the mutagenesis observed. However, the above scenario accounts for substitution mutations, whereas the ARG8 reversion assay used by Strand et al. (5Strand M.K. Stuart G.R. Longley M.J. Graziewicz M.A. Dominick O.C. Copeland W.C. POS5 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a mitochondrial NADH kinase required for stability of mitochondrial DNA.Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 809-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) scored for −1 frameshifts. On the other hand, Bebenek et al. (21Bebenek K. Roberts J.D. Kunkel T.A. The effects of dNTP pool imbalance on frameshift fidelity during DNA replication.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3589-3596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that a misincorporated nucleotide can stimulate −1 frameshift mutations when a mismatched nucleotide recognizes a correct complementary nucleotide to the 5′ side in the template DNA, for example, as shown in Scheme 1, where G represents an initially mismatched dGMP residue. Such a process could be favored by dNTP imbalances, and Bebenek et al. showed that in vitro dNTP pool imbalances promoted −1 frameshifts. For example, in the scenario shown in Scheme 1, dCTP excess would promote chain extension from the initially mismatched G. Whether such events are forced by proportional dNTP accumulations is not known, and to this end, it would be valuable to know whether the pos5 deletion promotes base substitution mutagenesis as well as frameshifting. In a semiquantitative sense, the data on dNTP pools suggest that the uniform pool doubling that we see can account for some (but not all) of the mutagenesis stimulated by the pos5 mutation. This is hardly surprising because the data of Strand et al. (5Strand M.K. Stuart G.R. Longley M.J. Graziewicz M.A. Dominick O.C. Copeland W.C. POS5 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a mitochondrial NADH kinase required for stability of mitochondrial DNA.Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 809-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) indicated a pronounced lack of oxidant protection in the pos5 deletion mutant, and oxidative damage to DNA is mutagenic. Because the Pos5 protein is an NADH/NAD+ kinase with a preference for NADH, we might expect pos5 mutant mitochondria to contain low pools of NADPH and possibly of NADP+ as well. We tested this directly by analysis of mitochondrial extracts for pyridine nucleotides. As shown in Fig. 4, that is what we observed. WT mitochondria contained about four times as much NADPH as pos5 mutant mitochondria and ∼2.5 times as much NADP+. The S.D. for the NADPH data in WT mitochondria was much higher than that for the data in mutant mitochondria. The p value obtained by comparing the two measurements was 0.12, which does not provide strong assurance that the two average values are statistically different. However, in five separate experiments, the WT NADPH value exceeded the pos5 mutant value by factors of 9.1, 1.9, 5.4, 1.3, and 2.2, respectively, with an average of 4.0. Hence, we conclude that NADPH levels in pos5 mutant mitochondria are considerably lower than those in WT mitochondria. The data for NADP+ measurements were more robust, with p < 0.01, indicating that the difference between the POS5 and WT values is significant. The S.D. values were higher in the NADH and NAD+ assays than those in the NADPH and NADP+ assays. NADH might well be expected to accumulate when NADH kinase activity is missing, and the NADH measurements in Fig. 4 are consistent with this expectation. However, this conclusion is not as strong as our conclusion that NADPH and NADP+ pools are significantly depleted in mutant mitochondria. We also analyzed pyridine nucleotides in cytosolic extracts. The S.D. values for the NADH and NAD+ assays were unacceptable, and those values are not shown here, but the data of Fig. 5 suggest that the pos5 mutation does not affect pyridine nucleotide levels in the cytosol. These findings are consistent with the mitochondrial localization of the POS5 NADH/NAD+ kinase. However, our findings leave open the question of the source of the mitochondrial pools of NADP+ and NADPH in pos5 mutant mitochondria. The data of Bieganowski et al. (8Bieganowski P. Seidle H.F. Wojcik M. Brenner C. Synthetic lethal and biochemical analyses of NAD and NADH kinases in Saccharomyces cerevisiae establish separation of cellular functions.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22439-22445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) indicate that cytosolic pools of NADP+ and NADPH do not exchange with mitochondrial pools and that cytosolic NADH/NAD+ kinases are not transported into mitochondria. Hence, the origins of the NADPH and NADP+ pools in mutant mitochondria are not known. In summary, our data confirm the role of Pos5p as a kinase capable of phosphorylating both NADH and NADP+, with action confined to mitochondria. These data are fully in accord with the conclusion that the mitochondrial mutator phenotype results from oxidative damage to DNA, caused by loss of oxidant protection resulting from the NADPH depletion. However, our data on mitochondrial dNTP pools support the hypothesis that at least some of the enhanced mutagenesis in the pos5 mutant is caused by a small but significant uniform accumulation of dNTPs.

Transcription initiation is controlled by multi-protein transcription factor complexes assembled at regulatory elements and at the site of transcription initiation. Cooperative DNA binding by transcription factors that bind to closely juxtaposed sequences (composite regulatory elements) are generally thought to require a specific arrangement of the transcription factors on DNA. Conversely, many mechanisms of transcription activation, including changes in chromatin structure and covalent protein modifications are not thought to require a specific arrangement of transcription factors on DNA. Some heterodimeric transcription factors can bind their recognition sequences in two opposite orientations (1Glover J.N. Harrison S.C.

The interferon-β enhancer contains closely juxtaposed recognition sequences for ATF2-Jun heterodimers, IRF3 and HMGI (supplemental Fig. S1).

The effects of HMGI on the configuration and cooperativity of ATF2-Jun and IRF3 binding at the interferon-β enhancer have not been established. The mechanisms of transcription activation by the complex assembled at the interferon-β enhancer are incompletely understood. Some of these mechanisms have been proposed to involve covalent protein modifications, whereas others invoke interactions between the complex assembled at the enhancer and the transcription initiation complex at the promoter (12Agalioti T.

Studies of endogenous gene regulation are necessary to establish the mechanisms that regulate genes in their normal context. We investigated the effects of interactions with IRF3 and HMGI on the orientation of ATF2-Jun heterodimer binding at the interferon-β enhancer and the effects of heterodimer orientation on the cooperativity of complex formation in vitro and on endogenous interferon-β gene transcription in cells. Our results demonstrated that the ATF2-Jun-IRF3-HMGI complex assembled at the interferon-β enhancer in two different configurations that had distinct transcriptional activities. bATF2 (residues 321–397 of human ATF-2, T321C, C351S), ATF2 (full-length human ATF2 (residues 1–505)), bJun (residues 239–315 of human c-Jun, T239C, C269S), Jun (full-length human Jun (residues 1–331)), iIRF3 (residues 1–111 of human IRF-3), and HMGI (full-length human HMGI (residues 1–107)) were expressed in Escherichia coli using pET-SUMO (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). ATF2, Jun, and full-length IRF3 were also expressed in Hela cells using pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). bATF2, ATF2, bJun, Jun, iIRF3, and HMGI were purified under the conditions described previously (16Kerppola T.K. Curran T. Selective DNA bending by a variety of bZIP proteins.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5479-5489Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The SUMO tag was cleaved using ULP1 protease, which were removed by nickel-chelate chromatography. bATF2 and bJun were labeled on N-terminal cysteine residues using Texas red C5 bromoacetamide (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Protein labeling efficiency was determined by measuring the fluorescence intensity and Coomassie staining of proteins separated by SDS-PAGE. IFNb oligonucleotides (encompassing −109 to −75 of the human interferon-β gene) labeled at their 5′-ends by 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). Duplexes were annealed and purified by PAGE. Complexes were formed by incubation of 400–800 nm heterodimers containing one Texas red-labeled subunit with 500 nm IFNb oligonucleotides labeled at one end with FAM. 1.5 μm iIRF3 and 3 μm HMGI were included where indicated. The complexes were separated by native PAGE, and their fluorescence intensities were imaged using a 488-nm laser in a Typhoon scanner (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). Cross-talk between the donor and acceptor fluorescence signals was corrected by using standards. The end preference values were calculated by dividing the acceptor-to-donor emissions ratio for left end-labeled complexes (TRL/FAML) by the sum of the acceptor-to-donor emissions ratios for left end-labeled complexes and right end-labeled complexes (TRL/FAML)+(TRR/FAMR) (17Ramirez-Carrozzi V. Kerppola T. Gel-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer (gelFRET) analysis of nucleoprotein complex architecture.Methods. 2001; 25: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected with the indicated combinations of plasmids using FuGENE6 (Roche, Nutley, NJ). Cells were infected with 200 hemagglutinin units/ml of Sendai virus (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA). Six hours, or the indicated time, after infection, the cells were harvested and total mRNA was isolated, reverse transcribed, and quantified by RT-qPCR using the primers listed in supplemental Table S1. To establish whether ATF2-Jun heterodimers encompassing the bZIP dimerization and DNA binding domains (bATF2-bJun, supplemental Fig. S1A) bind the interferon-β enhancer (IFNb, supplemental Fig. S1B) in one or both orientations, we used gel-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer (gelFRET) analysis (2Leonard D.A. Kerppola T.K. DNA bending determines Fos-Jun heterodimer orientation.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this approach, the efficiencies of energy transfer are compared among heterodimer-DNA complexes that are separated using gel electrophoresis. The complexes were labeled with a donor fluorophore at either end of the DNA and an acceptor fluorophore on either subunit of the heterodimer. The difference in energy transfer from opposite ends of the oligonucleotide to the labeled subunit was used to determine the end preference (Fig. 1A). The end preferences of complexes labeled on bATF2 (red bars) versus bJun (cyan bars) were compared to determine the preferred orientation of heterodimer binding at IFNb (Fig. 1C). bATF2 and bJun homodimers were used to estimate the end preference values of complexes with no orientation preference. Heterodimers labeled on bATF2 had a higher end preference than bATF2 or bJun homodimers, whereas heterodimers labeled on bJun had a lower end preference than those of the homodimers (Fig. 1C). This indicates that bATF2-bJun bound IFNb in a preferred orientation and that bATF2 favored the left half-site and bJun favored the right half-site. We examined the effects of amino acid substitutions that were predicted to shift the orientation of bATF2-bJun heterodimer binding (18Leonard D.A. Rajaram N. Kerppola T.K. Structural basis of DNA bending and oriented heterodimer binding by the basic leucine zipper domains of Fos and Jun.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 4913-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Substitution of R352 in bATF2, which can contact the asymmetric guanine in the central dinucleotide, by an alanine (bATF2XG) reversed the relative end preference values of heterodimers labeled on bATF2 versus bJun (Fig. 1C). Conversely, substitution of the homologous arginine (R270) in bJun by an alanine (bJunXG) caused the opposite shift in the end preference values of heterodimers labeled on bATF2 versus bJun. Thus, heterodimers in which these arginine residues that can contact the central guanidine were substituted by alanines in different subunits (bATF2XG-bJun versus bATF2-bJunXG) bound IFNb in different orientations (Fig. 1C, p < 0.01). These amino acid substitutions had the converse effects on the orientation of heterodimer binding at sites in which the central base pair was inverted (supplemental Fig. S2). The large differences between the end preference values for bATF2- versus bJun-labeled heterodimers that contained these amino acid substitutions than for wild type bATF2-bJun heterodimers indicate that wild type bATF2-bJun heterodimers did not bind IFNb in only one orientation. We examined the effect of truncated IRF3 encompassing the minimal DNA binding domain (iIRF3: residues 1 to 111) on the orientation preference of bATF2-bJun binding at IFNb. iIRF3 binding increased the absolute end preference values for all complexes, but did not change the relative end preference values of heterodimers labeled on bATF2 versus bJun, or those of bATF2 or bJun homodimers (compare Fig. 1, C and D). The effects of iIRF3 binding on the absolute end preference values were likely caused by changes in the structures of these complexes that did not alter heterodimer orientation. Thus, bATF2-bJun heterodimers in which the arginine residues that can contact the central guanidine were substituted by alanines in different subunits (bATF2XG-bJun versus bATF2-bJunXG) bound IFNb in different orientations in association with iIRF3 (Fig. 1D, p < 0.05). The absence of a change in bATF2-bJun orientation preference upon iIRF3 binding and the ability of iIRF3 to bind in association with bATF2 homodimers, bJun homodimers, as well as bATF2-bJun heterodimers bound in either orientation suggest that iIRF3 can interact equally with bATF2 and with bJun. We investigated if concerted interactions with HMGI and iIRF3 affected the orientation of bATF2-bJun binding at IFNb. HMGI and iIRF3 binding to IFNb in association with bATF2-bJun reduced the difference in end preference values of heterodimers labeled on bATF2 versus bJun compared with their end preference values alone or in association with iIRF3 (compare Fig. 1E with Fig. 1, C and D). HMGI and iIRF3 could also bind IFNb in association with bATF2 and bJun homodimers, as well as with bATF2-bJun heterodimers bound in either orientation. Thus, heterodimers in which the arginine residues that can contact the central guanidine were substituted by alanines in different subunits (bATF2XG-bJun versus bATF2-bJunXG) bound IFNb in different orientations also in association with iIRF3 and HMGI (Fig. 1E, p < 0.05). Thus, HMGI and iIRF3 could interact with both orientations of bATF2-bJun heterodimers, and HMGI binding reduced the intrinsic orientation preference of bATF2-bJun at IFNb. We investigated whether iIRF3 and HMGI affected the orientations of heterodimers formed by full-length ATF2 and Jun with labeled bJun and labeled bATF2, respectively, at IFNb. We compared the end preferences of these heterodimers alone, in association with iIRF3, and in association with iIRF3 and HMGI. iIRF3 binding had little effect on the relative end preferences of heterodimers containing full length ATF2 or Jun at IFNb (supplemental Fig. S3). HMGI binding reduced the difference in the end preference values of heterodimers containing full-length ATF2 or Jun at IFNb. Thus, heterodimers formed by full-length and truncated ATF2 and Jun bound to IFNb in both orientations in association with iIRF3 and HMGI. iIRF3 and HMGI also had similar effects on the orientation of bATF2-bJun heterodimer binding when IFNb oligonucleotides of different lengths and bATF2 and bJun labeled with different acceptor fluorophores were used (supplemental Fig. S4). Taken together, these results suggest that the labeled bATF2 and bJun proteins and the IFNb oligonucleotide were valid models for studies of the interactions of ATF2 and Jun with iIRF3 and HMGI at the interferon-β enhancer. The simplest interpretation of the observation that both orientations of bATF2-bJun heterodimers facilitated iIRF3 binding to IFNb is that iIRF3 can make equivalent contacts with bATF2 and bJun when the heterodimer binds in opposite orientations. D45 of IRF3 contacts R345 of ATF2 in the ATF2-Jun-IRF3-IFNb crystal in which ATF2 binds to the left half-site (Fig. 2A, upper left quadrant) (10Panne D. Maniatis T. Harrison S.C. Crystal structure of ATF-2/c-Jun and IRF-3 bound to the interferon-β enhancer.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4384-4393Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). R345 of ATF2 and R263 of Jun are symmetry-related by a 180° rotation about the dimer axis. We predicted that D45 of iIRF3 contacted R263 of bJun when the heterodimer bound IFNb in the opposite orientation (Fig. 2A, lower left quadrant). We tested the effects of substitutions at these symmetry-related arginine residues in bATF2 and bJun on the orientation of heterodimer binding at IFNb. In the absence of iIRF3, the R345A substitution in bATF2 (bATF2XD-bJun) and the R263A substitution in bJun (bATF2-bJunXD) had small effects on heterodimer orientation (Fig. 2B). In contrast to the absence of an effect of iIRF3 binding on the orientation of wild type bATF2-bJun heterodimers, iIRF3 binding had dramatic and opposite effects on the orientations of heterodimers containing these substitutions at IFNb (compare Fig. 2B and Fig. 2C). Thus, heterodimers in which the symmetry-related arginine residues that can contact D45 were substituted by alanines in different subunits (bATF2XD-bJun versus bATF2-bJunXD) bound IFNb with different orientation preferences in association with iIRF3 (Fig. 2C, p < 0.05). In both complexes, the shift in heterodimer orientation caused by iIRF3 binding reflected a decrease in binding by the mutated (XD) subunit to the left IFNb half-site proximal to D45 of iIRF3 and a corresponding increase in binding by the wild type subunit to the left IFNb half-site (Fig. 2E). Simultaneous substitution of both amino acid residues in bATF2 and bJun (bATF2XD-bJunXD) eliminated the effect of iIRF3 on the orientation of heterodimer binding. These results indicate that the absence of an effect of iIRF3 binding on wild type bATF2-bJun orientation was due to counterbalancing effects of interactions with symmetry-related residues in bATF2 versus bJun. We examined the effects of other symmetry-related amino acid residues in ATF2 and Jun that could influence the orientation of heterodimer binding through interactions with IRF3. Both ATF2 and Jun contain a cluster of negatively charged residues adjacent to their basic regions (E331, D332, D334, E335 in bATF2 and D246, E248, E251 in bJun). These residues are predicted to be in the vicinity of K70 of IRF3 in the heterodimer subunit bound to the right half-site (Fig. 2A, upper and lower right quadrants). In the absence of iIRF3, substitution of these residues in bATF2 (bATF2XK-Jun) or in bJun (bATF2-bJunXK) caused a moderate decrease and increase in heterodimer orientation preference, respectively (Fig. 2B). As in the case above, iIRF3 binding had dramatic and opposite effects on the orientations of these heterodimers at IFNb (compare Fig. 2B and Fig. 2C). Thus, heterodimers in which these clusters of charged residues in the vicinity of K70 were substituted by alanines in different subunits (bATF2XK-Jun versus bATF2-bJunXK) bound IFNb with different orientation preferences in association with iIRF3 (p < 0.05). In both complexes, the shift in heterodimer orientation reflected a decrease in binding by the mutated (XK) subunit to the right IFNb half-site proximal to K70 of iIRF3, and a corresponding increase in binding by the wild type subunit to the right IFNb half-site (Fig. 2E). Simultaneous substitution of both clusters of negatively charged residues in bATF2 and bJun (bATF2XK-bJunXK) eliminated the effect of iIRF3 binding on heterodimer orientation, indicating that interactions with the clusters of negatively charged residues counterbalanced the effects of each other on the orientation of heterodimer binding. We tested the effects of the K70E substitution in iIRF3 on the orientation preferences of heterodimers containing amino acid substitutions that affected interactions with iIRF3. iIRF3K70E binding caused equivalent shifts in the orientation preferences of wild type bATF2-bJun as well as of bATF2XD-bJun and bATF2-bJunXD heterodimers as were caused by wild type iIRF3 binding at IFNb (compare Fig. 2D and Fig. 2C). In contrast, iIRF3K70E binding did not shift the orientation preferences of bATF2XK-bJun or bATF2-bJunXK heterodimers compared with their orientation preferences in the absence of iIRF3 (compare Fig. 2D and Fig. 2B). These results indicate that the negatively charged residues adjacent to the basic regions of bATF2 and bJun affected heterodimer orientation through mutually exclusive interactions with K70 of iIRF3 at the right half-site of IFNb. The amino acid substitutions in bATF2-bJun and in iIRF3 had qualitatively similar effects on heterodimer orientation in complexes containing HMGI, indicating that HMGI did not displace iIRF3 from bATF2-bJun-IFNb complexes and that interactions between ATF2-Jun and iIRF3 are likely to be similar in the absence versus the presence of HMGI (supplemental Fig. S5). Simultaneous substitution of the arginine in the basic region of one subunit (XD) and the negatively charged residues adjacent to the basic region in the other subunit (XK) was predicted to eliminate interactions with both K70 and D45 in iIRF3 when the heterodimer bound in one orientation but not to affect these interactions when the heterodimer bound in the opposite orientation. In the absence of iIRF3, bATF2XD-bJunXK heterodimers bound IFNb with a higher orientation preference than wild type bATF2-bJun (Fig. 3, left panel). iIRF3 binding reversed the orientation of bATF2XD-bJunXK binding at IFNb (Fig. 3, middle panel). Conversely, iIRF3 binding caused the opposite shift in the orientation of bATF2XK-bJunXD binding at IFNb. Similar shifts in heterodimer orientation preferences were observed in complexes formed with iIRF3 and HMGI (Fig. 3, right panel). Thus, heterodimers in which the reciprocal combinations of amino acid residues were substituted (bATF2XD-bJunXK versus bATF2XK-bJunXD) bound IFNb in different orientations in association with iIRF3 as well as in association with iIRF3 and HMGI (p < 0.05). The amino acid substitutions in bATF2 and bJun that affected heterodimer interactions with IRF3 at the left and the right IFNb half-sites had cumulative effects on heterodimer orientation preference. We investigated if the amino acid residues in bATF2, bJun, and iIRF3 that affected heterodimer orientation also affected cooperative DNA binding at IFNb. We compared the effects of substitution of both symmetry-related residues in bATF2 and bJun on the concentration dependence of wild type iIRF3, iIRF3K70A, and iIRF3D45A binding at IFNb. Similar concentrations of wild type iIRF3 and iIRF3K70A were required for half-maximal binding of IFNb in association with wild type bATF2-bJun (Fig. 4Ai). In contrast, a much higher concentration of iIRF3K70A than of wild type iIRF3 was required for half-maximal binding of IFNb in association with bATF2XD-bJunXD (Fig. 4Aii). Conversely, a slightly lower concentration of iIRF3K70A than of wild type iIRF3 was required for half-maximal binding of IFNb in association with bATF2XK-bJunXK (Fig. 4Aiii). Higher concentrations of iIRF3D45A than of wild type iIRF3 were required for half-maximal binding of IFNb in association with all the bATF2-bJun variants tested (Fig. 4). The difference between wild type iIRF3 and iIRF3D45A binding at IFNb was slightly smaller in association with bATF2XD-bJunXD, but larger in association with bATF2XK-bJunXK than it was in association with wild-type bATF2-bJun (Fig. 4A). The effects of the K70A and D45A substitutions in iIRF3 were therefore reversed or reduced by substitutions in bATF2-bJun that were predicted to disrupt interactions with the substituted residues, but their effects were accentuated by substitutions in bATF2-bJun that were predicted to disrupt interactions involving other residues. iIRF3, iIRF3D45A, and iIRF3K70A bound to IFNb that was occupied by bATF2-bJun much more efficiently than to free IFNb, indicating that their binding was enhanced by their interaction with bATF2-bJun (supplemental Fig. S6B). Combinations of substitutions that were predicted to disrupt both sets of interactions between iIRF3 and bATF2-bJun (iIRF3D45AK70A and bATF2XDXK-bJunXDXK) had more severe effects than the individual substitutions (supplemental Fig. S6). In aggregate, the results indicate that the amino acid residues in bATF2, bJun and iIRF3 that affected the orientation of heterodimer binding at IFNb also affected the cooperativity of iIRF3 binding in association with bATF2-bJun at IFNb. We measured the cooperativity of iIRF3 and HMGI binding at IFNb in association with bATF2 and bJun variants that favored opposite orientations of heterodimer binding (bJun-bATF2XG versus bJunXG-bATF2 and bATF2XD-bJunXK versus bATF2XK-bJunXD). There was no detectable difference in the concentrations of iIRF3 and HMGI required for half-maximal binding of IFNb in association with bATF2-bJun heterodimers bound in opposite orientations (Fig. 4B). Thus, iIRF3 and HMGI bound with indistinguishable cooperativity in association with both orientations of bATF2-bJun heterodimers at IFNb. To investigate the role of the orientation of ATF2-Jun heterodimer binding in transcription regulation, we examined endogenous interferon-β gene transcription in cells that expressed ATF2 and Jun containing the amino acid substitutions that altered the orientation of bATF2-bJun binding at IFNb in vitro. In the absence of exogenous IRF3, these amino acid substitutions in ATF2 and Jun had small effects on the level of interferon-β transcripts (Fig. 5). In contrast, in cells that expressed exogenous IRF3, the co-expression of ATF2XK-JunXD or ATF2-JunXG heterodimers in which Jun was predicted to favor binding to the right half-site produced higher levels of interferon-β transcripts than the co-expression of ATF2XD-JunXK or ATF2XG-Jun heterodimers in which Jun was predicted to favor binding to the left half-site (Fig. 5, p < 0.05). The ectopic ATF2 and Jun transcripts were expressed at levels that were 20–300-fold higher than the levels of the corresponding endogenous transcripts, and the encoded proteins were likewise expressed at much higher levels than endogenous ATF2 and Jun (supplemental Fig. S7 and S8). The co-expression of wild type ATF2 and Jun with IRF3 did not stimulate interferon-β transcription compared with the expression of IRF3 alone. The effects of the amino acid substitutions in ATF2 and Jun on the level of interferon-β transcription were therefore likely caused by the displacement of endogenous ATF2 and Jun from the interferon-β enhancer rather than the assembly of additional complexes at enhancers that were not occupied in the absence of ectopic ATF2 and Jun. We investigated if the amino acid substitutions that affected bATF2-bJun heterodimer orientation at IFNb and the level of interferon-β transcription also affected transcription of other genes. The LEPREL1-T1 transcript (ENST00000437063) is transcribed downstream of an element in which the ATF2, Jun and IRF3 recognition sequences are identical to those found in the IFNb enhancer (supplemental Fig. S9). Co-expression of ATF2-JunXG with IRF3 resulted reproducibly in a higher level of LEPREL1-T1 transcripts than co-expression of ATF2XG-Jun with IRF3 (Fig. 5). Likewise, co-expression of ATF2XK-JunXD with IRF3 resulted reproducibly in a higher level of LEPREL1-T1 transcripts than co-expression of ATF2XD-JunXK with IRF3. Thus, heterodimers that were predicted to favor Jun binding to the right half-site resulted in higher levels of LEPREL1-T1 transcripts than heterodimers predicted to favor Jun binding to the left half-site. The RANTES chemokine gene contains ATF2-Jun and IRF3 recognition sequences that are separated by a longer distance than those of the interferon-β enhancer (supplemental Fig. S9). Co-expression of the ATF2 and Jun variants containing amino acid substitutions that affected the orientation of heterodimer binding at IFNb with IRF3 had similar effects on the level of RANTES transcripts as they had on the levels of interferon-β and LEPREL1-T1 transcripts (Fig. 5). The UPA and TPA genes contain ATF2-Jun recognition sequences, but no known IRF3 binding sites (supplemental Fig. S9). ATF2 and Jun variants containing substitutions that altered the intrinsic orientation preference of heterodimer binding at IFNb (ATF2-JunXG versus ATF2XG-Jun) had opposite effects on the levels of UPA and TPA transcripts compared with their effects on the levels of interferon-β, LEPREL1-T1 and RANTES transcripts in the presence of IRF3 (Fig. 5). The amino acid substitutions in ATF2 and Jun that altered the orientation of heterodimer binding at IFNb in complexes with IRF3 (ATF2XD-JunXK and ATF2XK-JunXD) had smaller and more variable effects on the levels of UPA and TPA transcripts in the absence and presence of IRF3. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the amino acid substitutions in ATF2 and Jun that affected the orientation of heterodimer binding at IFNb in vitro had distinct effects on transcription of different endogenous genes. We investigated if differences in the levels of expression of the ATF2 and Jun variants contributed to their distinct effects on the transcription of endogenous genes. When different relative amounts of plasmids that encoded ATF2 and Jun variants were transfected, the relative levels of ATF2 and Jun variant expression varied over a 25-fold range (supplemental Fig. S8). Under all of these conditions, expression ATF2 and Jun variants that were predicted to favor Jun binding to the right half-site in combination with IRF3 (ATF2-JunXG and ATF2XK-JunXD) produced higher levels of interferon-β transcripts that the expression of variants that were predicted to favor Jun binding to the left half-site (ATF2XG-Jun and ATF2XD-JunXK) (Fig. 6, supplemental Fig. S10; ANOVA p < 10−8 for both combinations). Moreover, consistent differences in the levels of LEPREL1-T1, RANTES, UPA, and TPA transcripts were observed when ATF2 and Jun variants that favored opposite orientations of heterodimer binding were expressed (Fig. 6, supplemental Fig. S10; ANOVA p < 10−3 for both combinations at each gene). These results indicate that the differences in the transcriptional activities of ATF2-Jun heterodimers that favored opposite orientations of binding at IFNb were not due to differences in their relative levels of expression. We investigated the effects of the ATF2 and Jun variants that favored opposite orientations of heterodimer binding on interferon-β transcription at different stages of viral infection. Whereas the absolute level of interferon-β transcripts varied more than 40-fold at different times after infection and between different experiments, there was a consistent difference between the levels of interferon-β transcripts in cells that expressed ATF2 and Jun variants that favored opposite orientations of heterodimer binding (Fig. 7, supplemental Fig. S11; ANOVA p < 0.05). We investigated if the amino acid substitutions in ATF2 and Jun that altered the orientation of heterodimer binding at IFNb affected transcription of different genes through similar or distinct mechanisms. We compared the effects of the amino acid substitutions on the transcriptional activities of the intact proteins described above with their effects on the transcriptional activities of chimeric proteins in which the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of ATF2 and Jun were exchanged. At the interferon-β and LEPREL1-T1 genes, these amino acid substitutions had similar effects on the transcriptional activities of the intact and chimeric proteins that contained the same bZIP and C-terminal regions (Fig. 8). In contrast, at the RANTES, TPA, and UPA genes, these amino acid substitutions had similar effects on the transcriptional activities of the intact and chimeric proteins that contained the same N-terminal regions (Fig. 8). Comparison of the levels of transcripts produced in cells that expressed different relative amounts of the chimeric proteins using two-way ANOVA were consistent with the hypothesis that different levels of these transcripts were produced in cells that expressed chimeric proteins that were predicted to favor opposite orientations of heterodimer binding (supplemental Fig. S13; ANOVA p < 10−3 for both combinations at each gene). These results indicate that different regions of ATF2 and Jun determined the effects of the orientation of heterodimer binding on transcription at different genes. The gelFRET analysis of the configurations of bATF2-bJun-iIRF3 and bATF2-bJun-iIRF3-HMGI complexes challenges the conventional view that multi-protein complexes bind composite regulatory elements in a unique and fixed configuration. It is generally recognized that the conformations of nucleoprotein complexes undergo thermal fluctuations. However, these conformations are often assumed to be distributed around a single configuration, and this “average” configuration is thought to be representative of the entire population. The discovery that the bATF2-bJun-iIRF3 and bATF2-bJun-iIRF3-HMGI complexes bind the interferon-β enhancer in two stable configurations extends previous observations that heterodimeric transcription factors can bind pseudo-symmetrical recognition sequences in two opposite orientations (1Glover J.N. Harrison S.C. Crystal structure of the heterodimeric bZIP transcription factor c-Fos-c-Jun bound to DNA.Nature. 1995; 373: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 2Leonard D.A. Kerppola T.K. DNA bending determines Fos-Jun heterodimer orientation.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The alternative configurations of these nucleoprotein complexes involve large-scale rearrangements of the protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interfaces in the complex. The large differences between the structures of complexes in which heterodimers bind in opposite orientations predict that they have distinct functions. Two independent lines of investigation corroborate the interpretation that bATF2-bJun-iIRF3-HMGI complexes assemble in two distinct configurations at the interferon-β enhancer. First, bATF2-bJun heterodimers bound the interferon-β enhancer in two opposite orientations in association with iIRF3 alone or with iIRF3 and HMGI in the gelFRET assay. Second, iIRF3 and HMGI bound the interferon-β enhancer with same cooperativity in association with bATF2-bJun variants that favor opposite orientations of binding. The two configurations of bATF2-bJun-iIRF3-HMGI complexes that can bind cooperatively to the interferon-β enhancer represent a new mode of cooperative DNA binding at a composite regulatory element that does not require a fixed configuration of protein interactions. The phenomenon of dual contact interfaces on opposite faces of heterodimers may be widespread since the residues that mediate protein interactions are often conserved among different members of a protein family (supplemental Fig. S14). We propose to designate interfaces that enable alternative configurations of protein interactions “Janus” interfaces as they provide multiple faces for engagement with interaction partners. Different configurations of the same transcription factors can have distinct transcriptional activities at different composite regulatory elements (19Schräder M. Müller K.M. Nayeri S. Kahlen J.P.

Our results extend this principle by demonstrating that transcription factor variants that bind in different configurations can have distinct transcriptional activities at the same composite regulatory element. The mechanisms whereby the orientation of ATF2-Jun heterodimer binding affected interferon-β transcription are likely to reflect orientation-dependent interactions with other factors at the interferon-β gene. The amino acid substitutions in ATF2 and Jun that affected the orientation of heterodimer binding at IFNb had opposite effects on the transcription of different endogenous genes. These differences could be due to opposite effects of the substitutions on the orientations of heterodimer binding at different genes, or they could indicate that the mechanisms whereby heterodimer orientation affects transcription vary among different genes. The observation that different regions of ATF2 and Jun determined the effect of the orientation of heterodimer binding on transcription at different genes is consistent with the latter interpretation. The consequences of the multiple configurations of transcription factor binding at the interferon-β enhancer and their distinct transcriptional activities for cellular and organismal phenotypes remain unknown. Different cellular processes require either unidirectional or bidirectional action. Some functions long thought to be unidirectional, such as promoter-directed gene transcription, have been recently found to be bidirectional (22Core L.J. Waterfall J.J. Lis J.T.

The structural basis for this bidirectional transcription remains to be established, but could be rooted in the bidirectional binding of transcription regulatory proteins as well as the TATA box-binding protein at their recognition sites (24Cox J.M.
