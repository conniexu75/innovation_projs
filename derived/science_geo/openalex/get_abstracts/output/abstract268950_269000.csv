https://openalex.org/W2011962928,"Iguana iguana is herbivorous throughout life and utilizes a microbial fermentation system in the elaborated hindgut to break down plant cell walls. Iguanas reared in captivity grew more slowly than wild hatchlings and failed to develop the same complex populations of fermentative microbes. Captive hatchlings fed fresh fecal material from an adult iguana acquired the complex microflora and grew as rapidly as wild hatchlings. In the field, hatchlings actively associated with adults during the first weeks of life and obtained the complex microflora during this time. Acquisition of the fermentative microflora by neonatal iguanas apparently requires direct contact with older conspecifics."

https://openalex.org/W1974403970,Patterns of body size and net construction suggest that current speed and food-particle concentration (not size) influence the distribution of suspension-feeding caddisflies on a downstream gradient. Large ancestral taxa with high filtration rates occur in resource-poor upstream habitats; more derived members of the phylogeny enter successively in downstream reaches with slower current and greater concentrations of particulate food.

https://openalex.org/W3027655989,"On 24 March Peter J. W. Debye, emeritus professor at Cornell University, began his 7th decade of active research in chemical physics and celebrated his 80th birthday. In anticipation of this occasion, three members of the Cornell staff—Dale R. Corson, provost, former dean of the school of engineering, and, before that, professor of physics and chairman of the department; Edwin E. Salpeter, professor of theoretical physics; and S. H. Bauer, professor of chemistry—interviewed Professor Debye on 5 March. This article consists of questions and answers selected from the tape recording of the interview."

https://openalex.org/W1999023342,"I propose to-day to compare very briefly the problems of the college graduate of my own time thirty-two years ago and those of the present, and then to point out what seems to me to be the most vital elements which must enter into the solution of the problems which to-day's graduating class will be called upon to face."

https://openalex.org/W2079576583,"Among the various expeditions sent out to observe the total solar eclipse of May 9, 1929, that of the Potsdam Observatory (Einstein Stiftung) seems to be the only one which obtained photographs suitable for determining the light deflection in the Sun's gravitational field. Two instruments were used, but so far only the results of the larger one, a 28foot horizontal camera combined with a coelostat, have been published. The three observers, Freundlich, von Kliiber, and von Brunn,2 claim that these observations (four plates containing from seventeen to eighteen star images each) lead to a value of 2'.'24 for the deflection of a light ray grazing the Sun's edge; a figure that deviates considerably from the results of the 1922 eclipse, and which is in contradiction to Einstein's generalized theory of relativity. In view of the importance and general interest attached to this problem, a few critical remarks on the Potsdam observations and their reduction should not be out of place here :3"
