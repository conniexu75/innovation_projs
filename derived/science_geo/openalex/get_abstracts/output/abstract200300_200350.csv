https://openalex.org/W2075073305,"Evidence is presented which indicates that the principal pathway of metabolism of epinephrine in man is O-methylation to metanephrine. The extent of the conLversion to metanephrine, a physiologically inactive compound, indicates that the enzyme responsible for this reaction, catechol-O-methyl transferase, is the enzyme mainly involved in the termination of action of epinephrine in man."

https://openalex.org/W2091805635,Evidence obtained by paper chromatography indicates that corn root curvatures caused by culture filtrates of Aspergillus niger are caused by the same compound which causes curvatures and malformations on the stems and petioles of bean plants. The R(f) values obtained for this compound were substantially different from those of indoleacetic acid.

This indicates that the tubular fluid is first concentrated, then diluted, before its final concentration."

https://openalex.org/W1987074445,"THE ease with which crane fly eggs lose water is of some ecological importance since the eggs are laid near the surface of the soil, among the bases of the grass stems. In this position they are likely to experience fairly wide fluctuations in humidity, at least during drought periods."

https://openalex.org/W1979139842,S>Determinations were made on the I¹³¹ content of the thyroid gland removed irom pregnant cows and on laryngothyroid areas from their fetuses. Findings are correlated to fall-out activity during the period. Data on iodine- 131 content are compared with data on 400 thyroids from cattle from the same area. Eighty-five 131 concentration in their thyroids than did their dams. Only 68 percent of the 6- to 7-month fetuses had more iodine-131 in their thyroids than did their dams. Implications of the findings are discussed. (C.H.)
