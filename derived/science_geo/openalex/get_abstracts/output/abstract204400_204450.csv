https://openalex.org/W2038615160,"Electrodes were implanted in the middle hypothalamus of rats to determine the neural organization of the ""feeding"" centers. Stimulations of the farand midlateral hypothalamic area produced feeding responses in sated animals, but only the former caused sated animals to cross an electrified grill to press a lever for food. After lesions had been made in the medial forebrain bundle, however, stimulations in the far-lateral hypothalamic area resulted in feeding in sated animals but failure to cross the electrical barrier to press a lever for food. Simultaneous far-lateral and ""satiety"" center stimulations produced feeding in sated animals but failed to ""motivate"" grill-crossing behavior."

https://openalex.org/W1965365113,"THE first isolation of multiple resistant Shigella was reported by Kitamoto1. This was resistant to four drugs (r
4): streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and sulphanilamide. E. coli r
4 was isolated in the epidemic of Sh. flexneri 3a r
4 (refs. 2 and 3). Sh. flexneri 2a r
3 and E. coli r
3 were also isolated in another epidemic, which were resistant to streptomycin, chloramphenicol and sulphanilamide4. Citrobacter r
4 and E. coli r
4 were isolated from a dysenteric patient after treatment with chloramphenicol5."

However, there is no publication dealing with them in terms of electrical activities except the brief note of Potter and Loewenstein2, in which the presence of synapses between neurosecretory cells and other nerve cells was only indirectly indicated."

This is a condition similar to that found in pink and red grapefruits, while the red pigments of blood oranges are anthocyanins."

https://openalex.org/W2026702070,"ALTHOUGH tracer studies in a number of carotenogenic systems1,2 have conclusively proved that mevalonic acid is an effective precursor of carotenes, the presence of mevalonic acid has not been demonstrated in any of such systems. In this laboratory an attempt has been made to isolate mevalonic acid from carrots. Previous work3,4 has shown that eell-free extracts of carrots can synthesize carotenes from acetate and mevalonic acid."

https://openalex.org/W2068580530,"A RADIOCHEMICAL method1 has been developed for the determination of cæsium-137 in urine. Acidified urine containing cæsium carrier is passed through a column of ammonium phosphomolybdate mixed with an equal weight of asbestos to give adequate porosity. The ammonium phosphomolybdate acts as a highly selective cation-exchanger and retains the cæsium quantitatively, even at comparatively high flow-rates. Other cations, including sodium, potassium and the alkaline earths, are not retained to any significant extent. After all the sample has passed through the column, the ammonium phosphomolybdate is dissolved in sodium hydroxide solution and the cæsium precipitated as the cobaltinitrite. The removal of final traces of potassium and rubidium from the cæsium is ensured by its subsequent precipitation as the bismuth iodide complex and finally as the chloroplatinate, which is filtered, dried and beta-rays counted. The recovery of carrier normally exceeds 80 per cent. The sensitivity of this method makes it particularly useful for the determination of fall-out cæsium-137 in urine, as current concentrations are low and are likely to decline still further."

https://openalex.org/W2051706189,"IT was known that Vibrio cholerae and Vibrio E1 Tor excrete a lecithin-splitting enzyme in their culture medium1–3, but the nature of this enzyme was not properly ascertained. The present communication is concerned with the characterization of the enzyme excreted by Vibrio E1 Tor with special reference to some of its important properties. The enzyme was isolated from the culture filtrate of the organism, which was grown aerobically in surface cultures using peptone–water medium for 48 hr. The culture filtrate was fractionated by ammonium sulphate and the precipitate obtained between 50–75 per cent saturation contained all the enzyme activity. This was dissolved in 0.01 M phosphate buffer and after dialysis against the same buffer was kept frozen at − 15° C. for about four weeks, up to which time no loss of enzyme activity has been noticed. Addition of glycerol is not necessary for its storage."

https://openalex.org/W2067694658,"INVESTIGATIONS on the minor fatty acid constituents of the liver oil of the New Zealand school shark have resulted in the isolation of the saturated n-odd-numbered acids as well as the iso- and (+)anteiso acids of the C15 and C17 series1,2. These acids had not previously been found in fish oils, but had been earlier isolated from the depot3 and milk fats4 of ruminants. In addition, the occurrence of n-hepta-decanoic acid and of (+)-14-methylhexadecanoic acid in tall oil has been established5. The occurrence of n-odd-numbered unsaturated acids in animal depot fats was first recorded in lamb caul fat, from which Δ9−–heptadecenoic acid was isolated6 and the presence of pentadecenoic acid indicated: Δ9−–heptadecenoic acid has also been obtained from musk-ox fat7 and from butterfat8. Following the feeding of n-odd-numbered saturated fatty acids, Appel, Böhm, Keil and Schiller9 found that the corresponding Δ9–monounsaturated acids were deposited in the depot and milk fats of goats and sheep. Apart from the above-mentioned instances, however, n-odd-numbered unsaturated acids have not been isolated from depot fats."

https://openalex.org/W2028733791,IT has been suggested by Broadbent1 that his general theory of selective processes in the human nervous system could give an account of the phenomenon of perceptual defence. His theory assumes that information entering the central nervous system can be thought of as arriving along certain ‘channels’ and that a ‘filter’ can select one (or occasionally more) channels and suppress the input along others. He has said: “It is economical for a series of stimuli to be analysed first for simple physical properties conveying little information … (if) classes of words may behave in the same way as sensory channels do … the filter might detect that a word belongs to the general class of sexual words without distinguishing which of those words it is and pass the word to the later perceptual mechanisms for more detailed analysis if the filter is set to pass sexual words. … The main factual point at which evidence seems to be needed is the question whether a class of words can act in the same way as a sensory channel”.
