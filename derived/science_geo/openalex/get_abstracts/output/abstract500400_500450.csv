https://openalex.org/W2001561488,"Most current approaches for analyzing metagenomic data rely on comparisons to reference genomes, but the microbial diversity of many environments extends far beyond what is covered by reference databases. De novo segregation of complex metagenomic data into specific biological entities, such as particular bacterial strains or viruses, remains a largely unsolved problem. Here we present a method, based on binning co-abundant genes across a series of metagenomic samples, that enables comprehensive discovery of new microbial organisms, viruses and co-inherited genetic entities and aids assembly of microbial genomes without the need for reference sequences. We demonstrate the method on data from 396 human gut microbiome samples and identify 7,381 co-abundance gene groups (CAGs), including 741 metagenomic species (MGS). We use these to assemble 238 high-quality microbial genomes and identify affiliations between MGS and hundreds of viruses or genetic entities. Our method provides the means for comprehensive profiling of the diversity within complex metagenomic samples."

Brown et al. present a potentially scalable route for making high-quality gas separation membranes in a high-surface-area configuration. Using two different solvents flowing in opposite directions, a metal-organic framework material was selectively deposited within hollow polymer fibers. The membranes showed high-performance separation capabilities when tested with mixtures of hydrocarbon gases. Science , this issue p. 72"

Lu et al. describe a clever strategy cells use to stay alive as long as they are not stressed for too long. The cells' quality-control machinery will activate a so-called death receptor when defective proteins accumulate within the cell, a sign of stress—but they will wait until the proteins have built up for a good long time. If stress is relieved soon enough, levels of the death receptor decay back to normal, and the cells stay alive; otherwise, R.I.P. Science , this issue p. 98"
https://openalex.org/W1974343902,"Genome editing has attracted wide interest for the generation of cellular models of disease using human pluripotent stem cells and other cell types. CRISPR-Cas systems and TALENs can target desired genomic sites with high efficiency in human cells, but recent publications have led to concern about the extent to which these tools may cause off-target mutagenic effects that could potentially confound disease-modeling studies. Using CRISPR-Cas9 and TALEN targeted human pluripotent stem cell clones, we performed whole-genome sequencing at high coverage in order to assess the degree of mutagenesis across the entire genome. In both types of clones, we found that off-target mutations attributable to the nucleases were very rare. From this analysis, we suggest that, although some cell types may be at risk for off-target mutations, the incidence of such effects in human pluripotent stem cells may be sufficiently low and thus not a significant concern for disease modeling and other applications."
https://openalex.org/W2161780951,"Optogenetic inhibition of the electrical activity of neurons enables the causal assessment of their contributions to brain functions. Red light penetrates deeper into tissue than other visible wavelengths. We present a red-shifted cruxhalorhodopsin, Jaws, derived from Haloarcula (Halobacterium) salinarum (strain Shark) and engineered to result in red light-induced photocurrents three times those of earlier silencers. Jaws exhibits robust inhibition of sensory-evoked neural activity in the cortex and results in strong light responses when used in retinas of retinitis pigmentosa model mice. We also demonstrate that Jaws can noninvasively mediate transcranial optical inhibition of neurons deep in the brains of awake mice. The noninvasive optogenetic inhibition opened up by Jaws enables a variety of important neuroscience experiments and offers a powerful general-use chloride pump for basic and applied neuroscience."
https://openalex.org/W1995338702,"DNA transcription, replication, and repair are regulated by histone acetylation, a process that requires the generation of acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA). Here, we show that all the subunits of the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) are also present and functional in the nucleus of mammalian cells. We found that knockdown of nuclear PDC in isolated functional nuclei decreased the de novo synthesis of acetyl-CoA and acetylation of core histones. Nuclear PDC levels increased in a cell-cycle-dependent manner and in response to serum, epidermal growth factor, or mitochondrial stress; this was accompanied by a corresponding decrease in mitochondrial PDC levels, suggesting a translocation from the mitochondria to the nucleus. Inhibition of nuclear PDC decreased acetylation of specific lysine residues on histones important for G1-S phase progression and expression of S phase markers. Dynamic translocation of mitochondrial PDC to the nucleus provides a pathway for nuclear acetyl-CoA synthesis required for histone acetylation and epigenetic regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1964416005,"High-throughput screening platform for the testing of small bioactive molecules that promote oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination: a new path to the discovery of potential drugs for multiple sclerosis. Functional screening for compounds that promote remyelination represents a major hurdle in the development of rational therapeutics for multiple sclerosis. Screening for remyelination is problematic, as myelination requires the presence of axons. Standard methods do not resolve cell-autonomous effects and are not suited for high-throughput formats. Here we describe a binary indicant for myelination using micropillar arrays (BIMA). Engineered with conical dimensions, micropillars permit resolution of the extent and length of membrane wrapping from a single two-dimensional image. Confocal imaging acquired from the base to the tip of the pillars allows for detection of concentric wrapping observed as 'rings' of myelin. The platform is formatted in 96-well plates, amenable to semiautomated random acquisition and automated detection and quantification. Upon screening 1,000 bioactive molecules, we identified a cluster of antimuscarinic compounds that enhance oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination. Our findings demonstrate a new high-throughput screening platform for potential regenerative therapeutics in multiple sclerosis."

These winds cause cold nutrient-rich seawater to rise to the surface, affecting climate and fueling marine productivity. Sydeman et al. examined data from the five major world regions where upwelling is occurring. Particularly in the California, Humboldt, and Benguela upwelling systems, winds have become stronger over the past 60 years. These regions represent up to a fifth of wild marine fish catches and are hot spots of biodiversity. Science , this issue p. 77"
https://openalex.org/W2057250808,"In humans, neuroligin-3 mutations are associated with autism, whereas in mice, the corresponding mutations produce robust synaptic and behavioral changes. However, different neuroligin-3 mutations cause largely distinct phenotypes in mice, and no causal relationship links a specific synaptic dysfunction to a behavioral change. Using rotarod motor learning as a proxy for acquired repetitive behaviors in mice, we found that different neuroligin-3 mutations uniformly enhanced formation of repetitive motor routines. Surprisingly, neuroligin-3 mutations caused this phenotype not via changes in the cerebellum or dorsal striatum but via a selective synaptic impairment in the nucleus accumbens/ventral striatum. Here, neuroligin-3 mutations increased rotarod learning by specifically impeding synaptic inhibition onto D1-dopamine receptor-expressing but not D2-dopamine receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons. Our data thus suggest that different autism-associated neuroligin-3 mutations cause a common increase in acquired repetitive behaviors by impairing a specific striatal synapse and thereby provide a plausible circuit substrate for autism pathophysiology."
https://openalex.org/W2063913905,"An orally available, highly selective agonist of Gpr120 is developed and tested. It is well known that the ω–3 fatty acids (ω–3-FAs; also known as n–3 fatty acids) can exert potent anti-inflammatory effects1,2,3,4. Commonly consumed as fish products, dietary supplements and pharmaceuticals, ω–3-FAs have a number of health benefits ascribed to them, including reduced plasma triglyceride levels, amelioration of atherosclerosis and increased insulin sensitivity5,6,7. We reported that Gpr120 is the functional receptor for these fatty acids and that ω–3-FAs produce robust anti-inflammatory, insulin-sensitizing effects, both in vivo and in vitro, in a Gpr120-dependent manner8. Indeed, genetic variants that predispose to obesity and diabetes have been described in the gene encoding GPR120 in humans (FFAR4)9. However, the amount of fish oils that would have to be consumed to sustain chronic agonism of Gpr120 is too high to be practical, and, thus, a high-affinity small-molecule Gpr120 agonist would be of potential clinical benefit. Accordingly, Gpr120 is a widely studied drug discovery target within the pharmaceutical industry. Gpr40 is another lipid-sensing G protein–coupled receptor10, and it has been difficult to identify compounds with a high degree of selectivity for Gpr120 over Gpr40 (ref. 11). Here we report that a selective high-affinity, orally available, small-molecule Gpr120 agonist (cpdA) exerts potent anti-inflammatory effects on macrophages in vitro and in obese mice in vivo. Gpr120 agonist treatment of high-fat diet–fed obese mice causes improved glucose tolerance, decreased hyperinsulinemia, increased insulin sensitivity and decreased hepatic steatosis. This suggests that Gpr120 agonists could become new insulin-sensitizing drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and other human insulin-resistant states in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2118531620,"In 11 studies, we found that participants typically did not enjoy spending 6 to 15 minutes in a room by themselves with nothing to do but think, that they enjoyed doing mundane external activities much more, and that many preferred to administer electric shocks to themselves instead of being left alone with their thoughts. Most people seem to prefer to be doing something rather than nothing, even if that something is negative."
https://openalex.org/W2019621646,"Mechanical forces have been proposed to modulate organ growth, but a molecular mechanism that links them to growth regulation in vivo has been lacking. We report that increasing tension within the cytoskeleton increases Drosophila wing growth, whereas decreasing cytoskeletal tension decreases wing growth. These changes in growth can be accounted for by changes in the activity of Yorkie, a transcription factor regulated by the Hippo pathway. The influence of myosin activity on Yorkie depends genetically on the Ajuba LIM protein Jub, a negative regulator of Warts within the Hippo pathway. We further show that Jub associates with α-catenin and that its localization to adherens junctions and association with α-catenin are promoted by cytoskeletal tension. Jub recruits Warts to junctions in a tension-dependent manner. Our observations delineate a mechanism that links cytoskeletal tension to regulation of Hippo pathway activity, providing a molecular understanding of how mechanical forces can modulate organ growth."
https://openalex.org/W2013710242,"A hallmark of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the development of pancreatic β cell failure, which results in insulinopenia and hyperglycemia. We show that the adipokine adipsin has a beneficial role in maintaining β cell function. Animals genetically lacking adipsin have glucose intolerance due to insulinopenia; isolated islets from these mice have reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Replenishment of adipsin to diabetic mice treated hyperglycemia by boosting insulin secretion. We identify C3a, a peptide generated by adipsin, as a potent insulin secretagogue and show that the C3a receptor is required for these beneficial effects of adipsin. C3a acts on islets by augmenting ATP levels, respiration, and cytosolic free Ca(2+). Finally, we demonstrate that T2DM patients with β cell failure are deficient in adipsin. These findings indicate that the adipsin/C3a pathway connects adipocyte function to β cell physiology, and manipulation of this molecular switch may serve as a therapy in T2DM."
https://openalex.org/W2007288149,"Carbon-carbon bonds without byproducts Environmental and cost concerns are spurring development of chemical methods that minimize byproduct formation. In this vein, Mo and Dong present a catalyst that inserts olefins such as ethylene directly into the C-H bonds of ketones. Traditional methods to form such products rely on the preliminary reaction of the ketone with a base, followed by subsequent reaction with an alkyl halide. The authors used a ligand that simultaneously activates the ketone and guides the catalytic rhodium to the right location. This approach removes the need for the other reagents and eliminates the associated halide salt byproducts. Science , this issue p. 68"
https://openalex.org/W2009521826,"Obesity and diabetes affect more than half a billion individuals worldwide. Interestingly, the two conditions do not always coincide and the molecular determinants of ""healthy"" versus ""unhealthy"" obesity remain ill-defined. Chronic metabolic inflammation (metaflammation) is believed to be pivotal. Here, we tested a hypothesized anti-inflammatory role for heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in the development of metabolic disease. Surprisingly, in matched biopsies from ""healthy"" versus insulin-resistant obese subjects we find HO-1 to be among the strongest positive predictors of metabolic disease in humans. We find that hepatocyte and macrophage conditional HO-1 deletion in mice evokes resistance to diet-induced insulin resistance and inflammation, dramatically reducing secondary disease such as steatosis and liver toxicity. Intriguingly, cellular assays show that HO-1 defines prestimulation thresholds for inflammatory skewing and NF-κB amplification in macrophages and for insulin signaling in hepatocytes. These findings identify HO-1 inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy for metabolic disease."
https://openalex.org/W1983671446,"Histone variants play crucial roles in gene expression, genome integrity, and chromosome segregation. We report that the four H2A variants in Arabidopsis define different genomic features, contributing to overall genomic organization. The histone variant H2A.W marks heterochromatin specifically and acts in synergy with heterochromatic marks H3K9me2 and DNA methylation to maintain transposon silencing. In vitro, H2A.W enhances chromatin condensation by promoting fiber-to-fiber interactions via its conserved C-terminal motif. In vivo, H2A.W is required for heterochromatin condensation, demonstrating that H2A.W plays critical roles in heterochromatin organization. Similarities in conserved motifs between H2A.W and another H2A variant in metazoans suggest that plants and animals share common mechanisms for heterochromatin condensation."
https://openalex.org/W2136929119,"Defects in brain development are believed to contribute toward the onset of neuropsychiatric disorders, but identifying specific underlying mechanisms has proven difficult. Here, we took a multifaceted approach to investigate why 15q11.2 copy number variants are prominent risk factors for schizophrenia and autism. First, we show that human iPSC-derived neural progenitors carrying 15q11.2 microdeletion exhibit deficits in adherens junctions and apical polarity. This results from haploinsufficiency of CYFIP1, a gene within 15q11.2 that encodes a subunit of the WAVE complex, which regulates cytoskeletal dynamics. In developing mouse cortex, deficiency in CYFIP1 and WAVE signaling similarly affects radial glial cells, leading to their ectopic localization outside of the ventricular zone. Finally, targeted human genetic association analyses revealed an epistatic interaction between CYFIP1 and WAVE signaling mediator ACTR2 and risk for schizophrenia. Our findings provide insight into how CYFIP1 regulates neural stem cell function and may contribute to the susceptibility of neuropsychiatric disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2061237420,"Cells allocate substantial resources toward monitoring levels of nutrients that can be used for ATP generation by mitochondria. Among the many specialized cell types, neurons are particularly dependent on mitochondria due to their complex morphology and regional energy needs. Here, we report a molecular mechanism by which nutrient availability in the form of extracellular glucose and the enzyme O-GlcNAc Transferase (OGT), whose activity depends on glucose availability, regulates mitochondrial motility in neurons. Activation of OGT diminishes mitochondrial motility. We establish the mitochondrial motor-adaptor protein Milton as a required substrate for OGT to arrest mitochondrial motility by mapping and mutating the key O-GlcNAcylated serine residues. We find that the GlcNAcylation state of Milton is altered by extracellular glucose and that OGT alters mitochondrial motility in vivo. Our findings suggest that, by dynamically regulating Milton GlcNAcylation, OGT tailors mitochondrial dynamics in neurons based on nutrient availability."
https://openalex.org/W2012460974,"Brown fat can reduce obesity through the dissipation of calories as heat. Control of thermogenic gene expression occurs via the induction of various coactivators, most notably PGC-1α. In contrast, the transcription factor partner(s) of these cofactors are poorly described. Here, we identify interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) as a dominant transcriptional effector of thermogenesis. IRF4 is induced by cold and cAMP in adipocytes and is sufficient to promote increased thermogenic gene expression, energy expenditure, and cold tolerance. Conversely, knockout of IRF4 in UCP1(+) cells causes reduced thermogenic gene expression and energy expenditure, obesity, and cold intolerance. IRF4 also induces the expression of PGC-1α and PRDM16 and interacts with PGC-1α, driving Ucp1 expression. Finally, cold, β-agonists, or forced expression of PGC-1α are unable to cause thermogenic gene expression in the absence of IRF4. These studies establish IRF4 as a transcriptional driver of a program of thermogenic gene expression and energy expenditure."

Brenguier et al. observed reductions in seismic velocity below volcanic regions of Japan from before, to the weeks and months after the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake (see the Perspective by Prejean and Haney).

https://openalex.org/W1972615891,"Gas jets block extragalactic x-rays Supermassive black holes at the heart of active galaxies produce powerful gas outflows. NGC 5548 is one such source known to sustain a persistent outflow of ionized gas. However, its associated x-ray and ultraviolet (UV) emission seem to have been suppressed in recent years. Kaastra et al. conducted a multiwavelength monitoring campaign throughout 2013 to characterize the system's behavior. They suggest that an additional faster jet component has been launching clumps of gas that obscure both the x-ray and UV radiation. The timing of this phenomenon indicates a source only a few light-days away from the nucleus. This proximity suggests that the outflow could be associated with a wind from the supermassive black hole's accretion disk. Even more powerful outflows could also influence their host galaxies, and this finding demonstrates how that feedback might work. Science , this issue p. 64"
https://openalex.org/W1969151506,"Mutualistic symbioses shape the evolution of species and ecosystems and catalyze the emergence of biological complexity, yet how such symbioses first form is unclear. We show that an obligate mutualism between the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii--two model eukaryotes with very different life histories--can arise spontaneously in an environment requiring reciprocal carbon and nitrogen exchange. This capacity for mutualism is phylogenetically broad, extending to other Chlamydomonas and fungal species. Furthermore, we witnessed the spontaneous association of Chlamydomonas algal cells physically interacting with filamentous fungi. These observations demonstrate that under specific conditions, environmental change induces free-living species to become obligate mutualists and establishes a set of experimentally tractable, phylogenetically related, synthetic systems for studying the evolution of symbiosis."

Researchers have assumed that preexisting fetal coronary vessels expand to cause this postnatal coronary vascular growth. Instead, Tian et al. now show that, for the most part, brandnew blood vessels form within the neonatal heart (see the Perspective by Burns and Burns). This ability to produce new coronary blood vessels after birth may one day help researchers work out how to promote cardiovascular regeneration after injury or disease.

https://openalex.org/W2041057250,"The authors recorded spontaneous and odor-evoked activity in the olfactory bulb of anesthetized and awake mice and found that distinct populations of interneurons independently orchestrated theta and gamma activity in this system. In particular, they found that silencing granule cells did not affect slow, odor-evoked inhibition. Circuits in the brain possess the ability to orchestrate activities on different timescales, but the manner in which distinct circuits interact to sculpt diverse rhythms remains unresolved. The olfactory bulb is a classic example of a place in which slow theta and fast gamma rhythms coexist. Furthermore, inhibitory interneurons that are generally implicated in rhythm generation are segregated into distinct layers, neatly separating local and global motifs. We combined intracellular recordings in vivo with circuit-specific optogenetic interference to examine the contribution of inhibition to rhythmic activity in the mouse olfactory bulb. We found that the two inhibitory circuits controlled rhythms on distinct timescales: local, glomerular networks coordinated theta activity, regulating baseline and odor-evoked inhibition, whereas granule cells orchestrated gamma synchrony and spike timing. Notably, granule cells did not contribute to baseline rhythms or sniff-coupled odor-evoked inhibition. Thus, activities on theta and gamma timescales are controlled by separate, dissociable inhibitory networks in the olfactory bulb."
https://openalex.org/W2002889467,"The microRNA miR-155 has been implicated in regulating inflammatory responses and tumorigenesis, but its precise role in linking inflammation and cancer has remained elusive. Here, we identify a connection between miR-155 and Notch signaling in this context. Loss of Notch signaling in the bone marrow (BM) niche alters hematopoietic homeostasis and leads to lethal myeloproliferative-like disease. Mechanistically, Notch signaling represses miR-155 expression by promoting binding of RBPJ to the miR-155 promoter. Loss of Notch/RBPJ signaling upregulates miR-155 in BM endothelial cells, leading to miR-155-mediated targeting of the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) inhibitor κB-Ras1, NF-κB activation, and increased proinflammatory cytokine production. Deletion of miR-155 in the stroma of RBPJ(-/-) mice prevented the development of myeloproliferative-like disease and cytokine induction. Analysis of BM from patients carrying myeloproliferative neoplasia also revealed elevated expression of miR-155. Thus, the Notch/miR-155/κB-Ras1/NF-κB axis regulates the inflammatory state of the BM niche and affects the development of myeloproliferative disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1974421923,"The utility of genome editing technologies for disease modeling and developing cellular therapies has been extensively documented, but the impact of these technologies on mutational load at the whole-genome level remains unclear. We performed whole-genome sequencing to evaluate the mutational load at single-base resolution in individual gene-corrected human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) clones in three different disease models. In single-cell clones, gene correction by helper-dependent adenoviral vector (HDAdV) or Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nuclease (TALEN) exhibited few off-target effects and a low level of sequence variation, comparable to that accumulated in routine hiPSC culture. The sequence variants were randomly distributed and unique to individual clones. We also combined both technologies and developed a TALEN-HDAdV hybrid vector, which significantly increased gene-correction efficiency in hiPSCs. Therefore, with careful monitoring via whole-genome sequencing it is possible to apply genome editing to human pluripotent cells with minimal impact on genomic mutational load."
https://openalex.org/W2086291911,"Symmetry breaking in a quantum system often leads to complex emergent behavior. In bilayer graphene (BLG), an electric field applied perpendicular to the basal plane breaks the inversion symmetry of the lattice, opening a band gap at the charge neutrality point. In a quantizing magnetic field electron interactions can cause spontaneous symmetry breaking within the spin and valley degrees of freedom, resulting in quantum Hall states (QHS) with complex order. Here we report fractional quantum Hall states (FQHS) in bilayer graphene which show phase transitions that can be tuned by a transverse electric field. This result provides a model platform to study the role of symmetry breaking in emergent states with distinct topological order."

We probe its chemical potential using double bilayer graphene heterostructures, separated by a hexagonal boron nitride dielectric. The chemical potential has a non-linear carrier density dependence, and bears signatures of electron-electron interactions. The data allow a direct measurement of the electric field-induced bandgap at zero magnetic field, the orbital Landau level (LLs) energies, and the broken symmetry quantum Hall state gaps at high magnetic fields. We observe spin-to-valley polarized transitions for all half-filled LLs, as well as emerging phases at filling factors \nu = 0 and \nu = +-2. Furthermore, the data reveal interaction-driven negative compressibility and electron-hole asymmetry in N = 0, 1 LLs."
https://openalex.org/W2128029143,"The transcription of genomic information in eukaryotes is regulated in large part by chromatin. How a diverse array of chromatin regulator (CR) proteins with different functions and genomic localization patterns coordinates chromatin activity to control transcription remains unclear. Here, we take a synthetic biology approach to decipher the complexity of chromatin regulation by studying emergent transcriptional behaviors from engineered combinatorial, spatial, and temporal patterns of individual CRs. We fuse 223 yeast CRs to programmable zinc finger proteins. Site-specific and combinatorial recruitment of CRs to distinct intralocus locations reveals a range of transcriptional logic and behaviors, including synergistic activation, long-range and spatial regulation, and gene expression memory. Comparing these transcriptional behaviors with annotated CR complex and function terms provides design principles for the engineering of transcriptional regulation. This work presents a bottom-up approach to investigating chromatin-mediated transcriptional regulation and introduces chromatin-based components and systems for synthetic biology and cellular engineering."
https://openalex.org/W1998281571,"The extent to which bacterial ribosomes and the significantly larger eukaryotic ribosomes share the same mechanisms of ribosomal elongation is unknown. Here, we present subnanometer resolution cryoelectron microscopy maps of the mammalian 80S ribosome in the posttranslocational state and in complex with the eukaryotic eEF1A⋅Val-tRNA⋅GMPPNP ternary complex, revealing significant differences in the elongation mechanism between bacteria and mammals. Surprisingly, and in contrast to bacterial ribosomes, a rotation of the small subunit around its long axis and orthogonal to the well-known intersubunit rotation distinguishes the posttranslocational state from the classical pretranslocational state ribosome. We term this motion “subunit rolling.” Correspondingly, a mammalian decoding complex visualized in substates before and after codon recognition reveals structural distinctions from the bacterial system. These findings suggest how codon recognition leads to GTPase activation in the mammalian system and demonstrate that in mammalia subunit rolling occurs during tRNA selection."

Regulation appeared to occur by altering the time spent in active states. The overall activity of SOS was determined by just a few molecules that achieved the highest catalytic activity.

https://openalex.org/W2046609126,"Fezf2 (Fezl) is a transcription factor that specifies corticospinal motor neurons (CSMN) originating from cortical layer 5b. Lodato et al. use cortical progenitor isolation from developing mouse brain and gene expression profiling to identify genes downstream of Fezf2 and demonstrate co-regulation of CSMN gene ensembles by Fezf2 in establishing CSMN cell identity. The neocortex contains an unparalleled diversity of neuronal subtypes, each defined by distinct traits that are developmentally acquired under the control of subtype-specific and pan-neuronal genes. The regulatory logic that orchestrates the expression of these unique combinations of genes is unknown for any class of cortical neuron. Here, we report that Fezf2 is a selector gene able to regulate the expression of gene sets that collectively define mouse corticospinal motor neurons (CSMN). We find that Fezf2 directly induces the glutamatergic identity of CSMN via activation of Vglut1 (Slc17a7) and inhibits a GABAergic fate by repressing transcription of Gad1. In addition, we identify the axon guidance receptor EphB1 as a target of Fezf2 necessary to execute the ipsilateral extension of the corticospinal tract. Our data indicate that co-regulated expression of neuron subtype–specific and pan-neuronal gene batteries by a single transcription factor is one component of the regulatory logic responsible for the establishment of CSMN identity."
https://openalex.org/W2047349530,"Using a rodent neuroprosthetic model, the authors found that, after successful learning, task-related units specifically experienced increased locking and coherency to SWA during sleep, and spike-spike coherence among these units was significantly enhanced. These changes were not present with poor skill acquisition or after control awake periods, demonstrating specificity to learning. Brain-machine interfaces can allow neural control over assistive devices. They also provide an important platform for studying neural plasticity. Recent studies have suggested that optimal engagement of learning is essential for robust neuroprosthetic control. However, little is known about the neural processes that may consolidate a neuroprosthetic skill. On the basis of the growing body of evidence linking slow-wave activity (SWA) during sleep to consolidation, we examined whether there is 'offline' processing after neuroprosthetic learning. Using a rodent model, we found that, after successful learning, task-related units specifically experienced increased locking and coherency to SWA during sleep. Moreover, spike-spike coherence among these units was substantially enhanced. These changes were not present with poor skill acquisition or after control awake periods, demonstrating the specificity of our observations to learning. Notably, the time spent in SWA predicted the performance gains. Thus, SWA appears to be involved in offline processing after neuroprosthetic learning."
https://openalex.org/W1978122642,"The availability of diverse genomes makes it possible to predict gene function based on shared evolutionary history. This approach can be challenging, however, for pathways whose components do not exhibit a shared history but rather consist of distinct ""evolutionary modules."" We introduce a computational algorithm, clustering by inferred models of evolution (CLIME), which inputs a eukaryotic species tree, homology matrix, and pathway (gene set) of interest. CLIME partitions the gene set into disjoint evolutionary modules, simultaneously learning the number of modules and a tree-based evolutionary history that defines each module. CLIME then expands each module by scanning the genome for new components that likely arose under the inferred evolutionary model. Application of CLIME to ∼1,000 annotated human pathways and to the proteomes of yeast, red algae, and malaria reveals unanticipated evolutionary modularity and coevolving components. CLIME is freely available and should become increasingly powerful with the growing wealth of eukaryotic genomes."

Individuals carrying the MHCII allele, HLA-DP2, are at risk for chronic beryllium disease (CBD), a debilitating inflammatory lung condition caused by the reaction of CD4 T cells to inhaled beryllium. Here, we show that the T cell ligand is created when a Be(2+) cation becomes buried in an HLA-DP2/peptide complex, where it is coordinated by both MHC and peptide acidic amino acids. Surprisingly, the TCR does not interact with the Be(2+) itself, but rather with surface changes induced by the firmly bound Be(2+) and an accompanying Na(+) cation.

https://openalex.org/W2094441238,"The development of a new screening method called EnPlex allows rapid profiling of small molecules against an extensive selection of the serine hydrolase enzyme family, resulting in the identification of both off-targets and potential lead compounds. The selectivity of an enzyme inhibitor is a key determinant of its usefulness as a tool compound or its safety as a drug. Yet selectivity is never assessed comprehensively in the early stages of the drug discovery process, and only rarely in the later stages, because technical limitations prohibit doing otherwise. Here, we report EnPlex, an efficient, high-throughput method for simultaneously assessing inhibitor potency and specificity, and pilot its application to 96 serine hydrolases. EnPlex analysis of widely used serine hydrolase inhibitors revealed numerous previously unrecognized off-target interactions, some of which may help to explain previously confounding adverse effects. In addition, EnPlex screening of a hydrolase-directed library of boronic acid– and nitrile-containing compounds provided structure-activity relationships in both potency and selectivity dimensions from which lead candidates could be more effectively prioritized. Follow-up of a series of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors showed that EnPlex indeed predicted efficacy and safety in animal models. These results demonstrate the feasibility and value of high-throughput, superfamily-wide selectivity profiling and suggest that such profiling can be incorporated into the earliest stages of drug discovery."

Here, Bonin and De Koninck find that hyperalgesia can be reversed by combining reactivation of peripheral afferents with spinal administration of a protein synthesis inhibitor, thereby identifying a spinal analogue of memory re-consolidation that enables erasing pain hypersensitivity. Hyperalgesia arising from sensitization of pain relays in the spinal dorsal horn shares many mechanistic and phenotypic parallels with memory formation. We discovered that mechanical hyperalgesia could be rendered labile and reversible in mice after reactivation of spinal pain pathways in a process analogous to memory reconsolidation. These findings reveal a previously unknown regulatory mechanism underlying hyperalgesia and demonstrate the existence of reconsolidation-like processes in a sensory system."
https://openalex.org/W1990369836,"Individuals with neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1) can manifest focal skeletal dysplasias that remain extremely difficult to treat. NF1 is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene, which encodes the RAS GTPase-activating protein neurofibromin. We report here that ablation of Nf1 in bone-forming cells leads to supraphysiologic accumulation of pyrophosphate (PPi), a strong inhibitor of hydroxyapatite formation, and that a chronic extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent increase in expression of genes promoting PPi synthesis and extracellular transport, namely Enpp1 and Ank, causes this phenotype. Nf1 ablation also prevents bone morphogenic protein-2-induced osteoprogenitor differentiation and, consequently, expression of alkaline phosphatase and PPi breakdown, further contributing to PPi accumulation. The short stature and impaired bone mineralization and strength in mice lacking Nf1 in osteochondroprogenitors or osteoblasts can be corrected by asfotase-α enzyme therapy aimed at reducing PPi concentration. These results establish neurofibromin as an essential regulator of bone mineralization. They also suggest that altered PPi homeostasis contributes to the skeletal dysplasias associated with NF1 and that some of the NF1 skeletal conditions could be prevented pharmacologically."
https://openalex.org/W2015394397,"Discussion around the SPM approval process has been ill-framed, raising questions of scientific credibility. Although changes were made during the government approval process, author involvement preserved consistency with the science in the underlying report. Even if scientists desired more far-reaching consensus in some areas, the government-approved SPM remains scientifically credible. The underlying report and Technical Summary were unaffected by changes made during SPM approval. The report provides a “living map,” drawn in a social learning process between scientists (mapmakers) and policy-makers (navigators), to be used to traverse the largely unknown territory of climate policy.

The SPM successfully provides a comprehensive, policy-relevant assessment of mitigation pathways to alternative climate goals in terms of underlying technological, economic, and institutional requirements. This was the key expectation for the WGIII report. But the approval process also revealed limitations of the IPCC in processing scientific knowledge with immediate relevance for negotiations, in particular, ex post assessment of progress made to date in climate change mitigation efforts.

Government concerns over the grouping of countries arose despite major efforts to provide a balanced assessment: The SPM section on emission trends and drivers that entered the approval plenary offered more analytical perspectives than any prior WGIII assessment. As is common scientific practice, countries were grouped in different ways depending on the question assessed. The SPM focused on why emissions have been growing as countries develop and how these patterns have shifted over time. The income-based classification was selected for its scientific merits to provide statistically robust insights and was subsequently used to analyze historic emission trajectories from multiple perspectives.

The fear of some governments, presumably, was that approval of any country classification other than that currently used under the UNFCCC could be disadvantageous in upcoming negotiations for a new international climate regime. But traditional UNFCCC classifications (Annex I versus non–Annex I) are not useful for scientific questions of the type considered in the SPM, because they show too much variation for insightful analysis. In the end, neither income-based nor any other alternative classification used in the underlying report was acceptable to all governments. Thus, figures and associated text had to be removed from the SPM.

Emissions “embodied” in traded products have increased dramatically since 1990, with high-income countries net importing, all others net exporting. Groups based on World Bank 2013 country income classification. [Modified from figures TS.5 and 1.5 ([ 1 ][2])].



Discussions on historic emission trends and drivers were part of a broader conflict over material that could be related to past performance of countries or regions in mitigating climate change. Such ex post analyses of international climate policies received new importance in the AR5, as the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol came to a close during the report cycle. Yet what remains in the SPM on the topic of international cooperation is limited to factual statements describing the status quo without any critical ex post evaluation of these policies. In our view, a reasonable summary of ex post policy analysis that considers different evaluation criteria is advantageous for negotiations.

Scientific concepts required for ex post policy evaluation as such do not have legal implications, nor should they predetermine future negotiations. Legal consequences require explicit reference to ethical norms like responsibility, capacity, or burden-sharing. During the Berlin approval session, government parties to the IPCC failed to agree on a reasonable way to analytically distinguish scientific analysis from potential political and legal interpretations. The SPM thus lost a valuable evaluation of policy performance that could have allowed for an informed, reasonable debate on mitigation. One notable exception was the characterization of climate change as a global commons problem.

The question of how the IPCC can provide ex post evaluation of climate policies in a SPM, which is approved line by line, will not dissolve after the AR5. As new mitigation policies are implemented over time, ex post evaluation of policies will become an increasingly important component of future IPCC reports.

The main challenge for the future of the IPCC is not one of organization and procedures. The real challenge is how the IPCC conducts assessments and deals with entanglement of facts and values at the science-policy interface. Nevertheless, factual and normative statements can usually be analytically distinguished. The SPM sections on framing and ethics and the underlying framing chapters, novel in the IPCC, offer a first blueprint for rationally discussing value judgments that often accompany scientific concepts and different perspectives. Presenting alternative pathways in ex ante analyses and multiple perspectives in ex post analyses is key if the IPCC wants to present meaningful assessments of human response options to climate change in the future.

Acknowledgment that a rational debate of facts and values is possible lies at the heart of any relevant assessment. This enlightened approach came under attack in Berlin. The IPCC has a choice: Either run the risk of becoming less and less policy-relevant or find a way for ex post assessment of climate policies to be clearly presented in government-approved summary documents. This should be done on the basis of clear understanding of legitimate roles of scientists as mapmakers and policy-makers as navigators. From such common understanding, the IPCC can further inform international climate policy without prescribing and predetermining future negotiations. How to further develop the art of assessment making should be at the heart of the ongoing discussions on the future of the IPCC.

https://openalex.org/W1996213026,"C-terminal extended ubiquitin species, which have been associated with neurodegenerative disorders, were thought to inhibit proteasomes resulting in reduced protein clearance. Biochemical studies now provide evidence that these ubiquitin variants primarily block the activity of the deubiqutinating enzymes. A frameshift mutation in the transcript of the ubiquitin-B gene leads to a C-terminally extended ubiquitin (Ub), UBB+1. UBB+1 has been considered to inhibit proteasomes and as such to be the underlying cause for toxic protein buildup correlated with certain neuropathological conditions. We demonstrate that expression of extended Ub variants leads to accumulation of heterogeneously linked polyubiquitin conjugates, indicating a pervasive effect on Ub-dependent turnover. 20S proteasomes selectively proteolyzed Ub extensions, yet no evidence for inhibition of 26S holoenzymes was found. However, among susceptible targets for inhibition was Ubp6, the primary enzyme responsible for disassembly of Lys48 linkages at 26S proteasomes. Processing of Lys48 and Lys63 linkages by other deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) was also inhibited. Disruption of Ub-dependent degradation by extended Ub variants may therefore be attributed to their inhibitory effect on select DUBs, thus shifting research efforts related to protein accumulation in neurodegenerative processes from proteasomes to DUBs."
https://openalex.org/W2464935767,"A central finding of WGIII is that growth of income has been the largest single driver of emissions. Governments accepted that finding at the global level, where it is safe to discuss generalities because no country is in the spotlight. But WGIII also showed how different categories of countries contribute to global emissions (charts 1 to 3). We explain what was lost when these figures were cut from the SPM.

Since the industrial revolution, today's highly industrialized countries have been the main contributors to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (chart 1). But over the past decade, their emissions have been roughly flat, whereas emissions from upper-middle-income countries (UMCs) have risen rapidly (chart 2A). The central implication is that inter-national climate policy needs to update how it categorizes countries. In the early 1990s when the UNFCCC was created, countries were divided into two categories—industrialized nations (Annex I), and the rest (non–Annex I). As non–Annex I countries' emissions have soared, their participation in future climate agreements is essential.

Getting serious about categorizing countries will reopen old, but unavoidable, political fissures. Industrialized countries—which, on average, still have the highest per capita emissions—must do more to cut emissions. Emerging economies must accept that they account for most of the recent and expected emissions growth. Unless both groups take concerted action, stabilizing the climate will be impossible.

There are many schemes for grouping countries. The best choice depends on the purpose of the analysis. The full WGIII report uses several schemes, but in the SPM a central purpose was to minimize variation in emissions within each category, and thus, it grouped countries according to underlying economic drivers of emissions. The writing team selected the latest version of a World Bank scheme widely used by experts in economic growth and better suited to explaining variations in emissions than the Annex I scheme. Nonetheless, there remains huge variation within these categories (chart 2B), particularly for the least-developed countries, where the greatest emissions are related to agriculture and land use. In richer countries it is energy consumption that drives most emissions. That key finding was also cut from the SPM. And any scheme is sensitive to the classification of China's big economy, which was upgraded to UMC status in 2010. Although income is an important driver (chart 2C), within income categories, many other factors, including policy, lead to highly variable emissions. Some UMCs have per capita emissions about equal to the most frugal industrialized countries whose income levels are a multiple.

These figures also reveal the changing structure of the economy, measured in energy intensity (emissions per dollars of output, chart 2D). As economies mature, they become more efficient. But this improvement in energy intensity has not been fast enough to offset the overall effect of growing economies. That's why policies are needed and help explain the wide variation in emission intensity. Some countries have adopted aggressive policies, whereas others have done almost nothing.

High variability in the factors that determine emissions has implications for the design of climate agreements. If a wider array of countries is to be engaged in the global effort to control emissions, a single schedule of binding targets and timetables is unlikely to work. International agreements must be flexible to accommodate different national circumstances, including uncertainty in economic development—a subject of much scientific research also cut from the SPM.

Studies on effects of trade and globalization have tracked emissions “embodied” in products that are traded across borders. For the first time, IPCC presented adjusted emission statistics showing how territorial and consumption-based accounting systems lead to very different pictures. But because governments couldn't agree on how to group countries, all WGIII findings about embodied emissions were cut from the SPM. What was lost is shown in chart 3.

Embodied carbon has increased dramatically since 1990. Current international policy approaches, which ignore trade, create strong incentives for countries to sit outside climate agreements and to take a free ride on benefits, not only in terms of climate change mitigation but also because of industry relocation. Better accounting would allow better incentives, such as border taxes and other adjustments for trade. Sophisticated rules within the World Trade Organization can keep countries from abusing such measures for protectionist purposes. Some countries are already experimenting with such approaches—the European Union (EU), for example, is extending its emission rules to cover foreign aircraft that use EU airports.

Most talk of IPCC reform is focused on how it must change. For example, the IPCC should shift from infrequent big reports to more timely shorter and focused studies; the review process could be streamlined. But IPCC is a government-controlled process. Its line-by-line approval of the SPM yields the lowest common denominator of what is scientifically accurate and not too toxic for governments. A small number of countries can block findings that a large number of scientists working over many years with extensive review have agreed are robust.

Disentangling IPCC from politics is impossible, especially where IPCC engages social science research that has policy-relevant conclusions. Yet IPCC as a scientific body can sharpen its messages by focusing more attention on the author-approved technical and policy summary documents.

The most important rethinking is needed outside the IPCC process. When the IPCC began in the late 1980s, it eclipsed many different national climate science assessments. We predict and encourage a return to that multiplicity of assessments. This allows greater tailoring of assessments to local circumstances, values, and priorities. It will also encourage fuller diversity of scientific views. The IPCC will continue to have an important role to help stitch together many diverse assessments into a global perspective, while focusing on questions of special diplomatic importance such as impacts on the least-developed countries.

Claiming government overreach and calling for greater insulation of the process come from a misleadingly simple interpretation. Such insulation would likely diminish the policy relevance of the SPM. The SPM is “approved” by governments, not merely “accepted” as is the main report, which invests it with an important measure of governmental ownership. An approval process is worth preserving, as it is precisely what makes the IPCC distinct from any number of technical reports. We explore an alternative vision for articulating science and politics at the IPCC.

As the parties work toward a next phase in the global climate treaty to be agreed on in late 2015, perhaps the single most contentious issue is that of country groupings, as they are directly linked to national commitments under the UNFCCC. IPCC findings perceived to influence revision of groupings were thus liable to trigger a confrontation in Berlin.

As income growth has been identified as a key driver of emissions growth, income groups appear a natural analytical tool, although the full WGIII report most frequently uses traditional regional groups, as well as sectoral disaggregation. At least two challenges confront any grouping approach in the context of an SPM.

First, in the negotiation context, analytical groupings are inevitably interpreted as to implications for political groupings. Imposing political perceptions in the context of a scientific assessment might be seen as intrusive. However, in producing an SPM with explicit government buy-in, engagement on such issues is inevitable. The question is how to make it productive.

Second, grouping heterogeneous and rapidly changing countries into a few categories necessarily elides relevant information. Country groups contain large variances (chart 2B), aggregate statistics can be dominated by a few countries, and many alternative groupings are possible. Small changes in number of groups, thresholds between groups, types of characteristics, and reference period can lead to large changes in findings with substantial political implications.

For example, chart 2 categorizes countries according to their current (2013) income, showing that UMCs accounted for three-quarters of global emissions rise from 2000 to 2010. A political interpretation of this may be that the UNFCCC must update its country groupings to reflect the role of UMCs and to impose commensurate emission limits. However, the same representation based on countries' income in a year during the 2000–2010 decade (e.g., 2005) would show that three-quarters of the 2000–2010 global emissions rise arose in lower-middle-income countries, rather than UMCs, and a further 20% in low-income countries. A corresponding political interpretation might stress the need for financial and technological support to enable countries to develop along a lower-carbon pathway through low- and lower-middle income stages. The two representations would be equally faithful to underlying data, but also equally synthetic and incomplete, and differ markedly in the political extrapolations to which they ostensibly lend credence.

What happened with two other sections of the SPM suggests that the outcome of political debate on scientific findings is contingent. The framing section of the SPM deals with very contentious issues about the need for cooperation in mitigation and technology, as well as the centrality of equity in burden-sharing and in the evaluation of costs and benefits, among others. Yet, agreement was reached on this section—indeed, it was expanded rather than truncated. This was due, in part, to serendipity; the framing section was taken up for discussion early in the approval process, which allowed 4 days for discussion and iterations of text, and that enabled convergence on what authors sought to convey and the political-legal sensibilities brought by country delegates.

In contrast, discussion of another section, on international cooperation, produced much shorter text and simplified content, stripped of controversial elements. This was due both to the short time available for this discussion and to a general spirit of contention after the removal of several figures.

What does this suggest about the IPCC process? The main IPCC report should be focused on establishing and presenting scientific facts. But seemingly technical choices can crystallize into value-laden political conclusions, particularly given tight word and time limits. It is more productive for authors to be aware of alternative political interpretations of their concepts and findings and to factor these into representations of data, than to strive, unrealistically, to ignore political concerns. This requires rethinking the SPM as a coproduction process in which salient political discussions are connected to relevant scientific material. Changes in the SPM writing process can help: creating more channels and space for dialogue before the pressure cooker of a time-limited approval session, ensuring strict continuity and transparency between drafts, and treating author diversity of perspectives as an asset.

The process of coproducing a portion of the IPCC with governments is what lends the IPCC its credibility as a voice that is of scientists, but with more weight for policy. Calls for insulation from politics risk undermining the relevance of the SPM.
