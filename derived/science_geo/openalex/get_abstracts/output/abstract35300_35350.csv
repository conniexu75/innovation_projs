https://openalex.org/W2001720727,"We have cloned a previously undescribed adhesion molecule, VCAM-1, which is induced by cytokines on human endothelial cells and binds lymphocytes. Using a novel method requiring neither monoclonal antibodies nor purified protein, VCAM-1-expressing clones were selected by adhesion to human lymphoid cell lines. VCAM-1 mRNA is present in endothelial cells at 2 hr after treatment with IL-1 or TNF-alpha and is maintained for at least 72 hr; leukocyte binding activity parallels mRNA induction. Cells transfected with VCAM-1 bind the human leukemia lines Jurkat, Ramos, Raji, HL60, and THP1, but not peripheral blood neutrophils. VCAM-1, which belongs to the immunoglobulin gene super-family, may be central to recruitment of mononuclear leukocytes into inflammatory sites in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2128078747,"Despite the obvious importance of epithelial stem cells in tissue homeostasis and tumorigenesis, little is known about their specific location or biological characteristics. Using 3H-thymidine labeling, we have identified a subpopulation of corneal epithelial basal cells, located in the peripheral cornea in a region called limbus, that are normally slow cycling, but can be stimulated to proliferate in response to wounding and to a tumor promotor, TPA. No such cells can be detected in the central corneal epithelium, suggesting that corneal epithelial stem cells are located in the limbus. A comparison of various types of epithelial stem cells revealed a common set of features, including their preferred location, pigment protection, and growth properties, which presumably play a crucial role in epithelial stem cell function."
https://openalex.org/W2057120350,"The dorsoventral axis of the Drosophila embryo is determined by a morphogen gradient established by the action of 12 maternal-effect genes: the dorsal group genes and cactus. One of the dorsal group genes, dorsal (dl), encodes the putative morphogen. Although no overall asymmetry in the distribution of dorsal protein is observed, a gradient of nuclear concentration of dl protein is established during cleavage stages, with a maximum at the ventral side of the egg. At the dorsal side of the egg, the protein remains in the cytoplasm. Nuclear localization of the dl protein, and hence gradient formation, is blocked in dorsalizing alleles of all of the other dorsal group genes, while in ventralizing mutants nuclear localization extends to the dorsal side of the egg. A correlation between dl protein distribution and embryonic pattern in mutant embryos indicates that the nuclear concentration of the dl protein determines pattern along the dorsoventral axis."
https://openalex.org/W1984046181,"In Drosophila embryogenesis, mitotic control undergoes a significant transition during the 14th interphase. Mitoses before interphase 14 run on maternal products, and occur in metasynchronous waves. Mitoses after interphase 14 require zygotic transcription, and occur asyncronously in an intricate, highly ordered spatioâ€”temporal pattern. Mutations at the string (stg) locus cause cell-cycle arrest during this transition, in G2 of interphase 14, yet do not arrest other aspects of development. This phenotype suggests that stg is required specifically for initiating mitosis. We describe the cloning of stg, and show that its predicted amino acid sequence is homologous to that of cdc25, a regulator of mitotic initiation in the yeast S. pombe. In addition, we show that zygotic expression of stg mRNA occurs in a dynamic series of spatial patterns which anticipate the patterns of the zygotically driven cell divisions. Therefore we suggest that regulated expression of stg mRNA controls the timing and location of these embryonic cell divisions."
https://openalex.org/W2170136346,"The v-myb oncogene induces myeloid leukemias in chickens, transforms myeloid cells in vitro, and encodes a sequence-specific DNA binding protein. We used differential hybridization to screen for v-myb-regulated genes in cells transformed by a temperature-sensitive mutant of the oncogene and identified a new gene, mim-1, which encodes a specifically expressed, secretable protein contained in the granules of both normal and v-myb-transformed promyelocytes. The promoter of the mim-1 gene contains three closely spaced binding sites for v-myb protein and is strongly activated by v-myb in a cotransfection assay. Synthetic copies of the binding sites are both necessary and sufficient to confer v-myb protein-dependent activation to a heterologous promoter. We conclude that mim-1 is a cellular gene that is directly regulated by the product of the v-myb oncogene."
https://openalex.org/W2079289760,"Certain inflammatory stimuli render cultured human vascular endothelial cells hyperadhesive for neutrophils. This state is transient and reversible, in part because activated endothelial cells secrete a leukocyte adhesion inhibitor (LAI). LAI was identified as endothelial interleukin-8 (IL-8), the predominant species of which is an extended amino-terminal IL-8 variant. At nanomolar concentrations, purified endothelial IL-8 and recombinant human IL-8 inhibit neutrophil adhesion to cytokine-activated endothelial monolayers and protect these monolayers from neutrophil-mediated damage. These findings suggest that endothelial-derived IL-8 may function to attenuate inflammatory events at the interface between vessel wall and blood."
https://openalex.org/W2018566513,"Electrophysiological responses to the glutamate analog N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) measured in three different central neuronal preparations are subject to a novel modulatory mechanism: they are substantially potentiated after exposure to the disulfide reducing agent dithiothreitol, while oxidation with 5-5-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid decreases the magnitude of the response. Modification of the NMDA response by either oxidation or reduction does not appear to affect the pharmacological properties of the receptor-channel complex. Since we observe that the redox state of the native receptor-channel complex varies widely among neurons, an in vivo mechanism that can strongly regulate NMDA-activated functions by either reduction or oxidation may exist. In addition, these results suggest that it may be possible to design specific redox agents for characterizing the NMDA receptor-channel complex."
https://openalex.org/W2156491803,"The heterochronic genes lin-4, lin-14, lin-28, and lin-29 control the timing of specific postembryonic developmental events in C. elegans. The experiments described here examine how these four genes interact to control a particular stage-specific event of the lateral hypodermal cell lineages. This event, termed the ""larva-to-adult switch"" (L/A switch), involves several coordinate changes in the behavior of hypodermal cells at the fourth molt: cessation of cell division, formation of adult (instead of larval) cuticle, cell fusion, and cessation of the molting cycle. The phenotypes of multiply mutant strains suggest a model wherein the L/A switch is controlled by the stage-specific activity of a regulatory hierarchy: At early stages of wild-type development, lin-14 and lin-28 inhibit lin-29 and thus prevent switching. Later, lin-4 inhibits lin-14 and lin-28, allowing activation of lin-29, which in turn triggers the switch in the L4 stage. lin-29 may activate the L/A switch by regulating genes that control cell division, differentiation, and stage-specific gene expression in hypodermal cells."
https://openalex.org/W1572077460,"To gain insight into the relationship between acyl coenzyme A (CoA) esters and glucose-induced insulin release, acyl-CoA profiles were determined in clonal pancreatic beta-cells (HIT). A high sensitivity high performance liquid chromatography method was used to measure malonyl, succinyl, beta-hydroxy beta-methylglutaryl and acetyl-CoA esters and free CoASH. Malonyl-CoA content increased more than 3-fold following exposure of HIT cells to 10 mM glucose. The rise in malonyl-CoA, which preceded insulin secretion, was evident 2 min after exposure to glucose and was sustained for at least 30 min. The increase in malonyl-CoA was associated with inhibition of fatty acid oxidation, increased de novo lipid synthesis and a rise in diacylglycerol content. Succinyl-CoA levels, which may reflect anaplerotic influx into the citric acid cycle, were elevated in the presence of glucose. The concentration of acetyl-CoA and the ratio of free CoASH to acetyl-CoA was unchanged. The data are consistent with a metabolic model in which malonyl-CoA mediates the switch from fatty acid catabolism to lipid synthesis during glucose stimulation of beta-cells. We suggest that these changes in lipid metabolism, by leading to increased diacylglycerol synthesis or protein acylation could play a pivotal role in the regulation of the sustained phase of insulin secretion."

https://openalex.org/W2139228036,"Although evidence obtained with the PC12 cell line has suggested a role for the ras oncogene proteins in the signal transduction of nerve growth factor-mediated fiber outgrowth, little is known about the signal transduction mechanisms involved in the neuronal response to neurotrophic factors in nontransformed cells. We report here that the oncogene protein T24-ras, when introduced into the cytoplasm of freshly dissociated chick embryonic neurons, promotes the in vitro survival and neurite outgrowth of nerve growth factor-responsive dorsal root ganglion neurons, brain-derived neurotrophic factor-responsive nodose ganglion neurons, and ciliary neuronotrophic factor-responsive ciliary ganglion neurons. The proto-oncogene product c-Ha-ras also promotes neuronal survival, albeit less strongly. No effect could be observed with truncated counterparts of T24-ras and c-Ha-ras lacking the 23 C-terminal amino acids including the membrane-anchoring, palmityl-accepting cysteine. These results suggest a generalized involvement of ras or ras-like proteins in the intracellular signal transduction pathway for neurotrophic factors."

https://openalex.org/W1981578463,"Expression of high levels of the structural proteins of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) requires the presence of the protein encoded by the rev open reading frame (Rev) and its associated target sequence CAR (cis anti-repression sequence) which is present in the env region of viral RNA. Extensive mutagenesis demonstrated that CAR has a complex secondary structure consisting of a central stem and five stem/loops. Disruption of any of these structures severely impaired the Rev response, but many of the stem/loops contain material that was unnecessary for Rev regulation and must be retained in these structures to avoid disturbing adjacent structures critical for CAR function. Probably no more than two of the described structural components are involved in sequence-specific recognition by regulatory proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1976989696,"We have identified a DNA binding protein, named BETA, that interacts with the same (B) transcriptional regulatory sequence as the known transcription factor NF-kappa B. BETA is found only in gray matter throughout the brain, and not in a variety of other rat tissues. Two binding sites for BETA are present adjacent to the promoter of the rat proenkephalin gene. Transfection of primary brain cultures that express BETA, with a reporter gene driven by the SV40 promoter linked to BETA DNA binding sites, results in transcriptional activation. We infer that BETA is a brain-specific transcription activator."
https://openalex.org/W2032165553,"To investigate the mechanism of sex determination in the germ line, we analyzed the fate of XY germ cells in ovaries, and the fate of XX germ cells in testes. In ovaries, germ cells developed according to their X:A ratio, i.e., XX cells underwent oogenesis, XY cells formed spermatocytes. In testes, however, XY and XX germ cells entered the spermatogenic pathway. Thus, to determine their sex, the germ cells of Drosophila have cell-autonomous genetic information, and XX cells respond to inductive signals of the soma. Results obtained with amorphic and constitutive mutations of Sxl show that both the genetic and the somatic signals act through Sxl to achieve sex determination in germ cells."
https://openalex.org/W1977675485,"Microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) binds, and is a substrate for, type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The structural domain in MAP2 that binds the regulatory subunit (RII) of protein kinase II was identified by expressing fragments of a human MAP2 cDNA in E. coli using the pATH11 vector. Fusion proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The filters were probed with purified bovine heart or brain RII, anti-RII monoclonal antibodies, and 125I-labeled protein A. Binding of RII was localized to a 31 amino acid sequence near the N-terminus of the MAP2 molecule. Fusion proteins containing this fragment bound both heart and brain RIIs in a concentration-dependent manner, but bound heart RII with a higher apparent affinity than brain RII. The amino acid sequence of this fragment (DRETAEEVSARIVQVVTAEAVAVLKGEQEKE) is totally conserved between human and mouse MAP2, suggesting an important role for the RII binding site of MAP2 in neuronal function."
https://openalex.org/W1545204276,"The cDNAs encoding full-length chicken oviduct progesterone receptor B (PRB) and a truncated receptor (C1C2) lacking the amino-terminal domain were expressed in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) using a ubiquitin fusion system. The expression of the fusion protein is under the control of a copper-responsive yeast metallothionein promoter, and the fusion protein is subsequently cleaved by the yeast host enzyme to produce receptor protein. Western immunoblot analyses of yeast extracts containing full-length PRB revealed a polypeptide co-migrating with authentic chicken oviduct PRB. Using a polyclonal antibody (907) directed against the hinge region of the authentic chicken progesterone receptor, a 42-kDa polypeptide was detected by Western analysis in yeast extracts containing C1C2 receptors. Standard hormone binding assays indicated that these receptors produced in yeast cells exhibited steroid binding affinity and specificity characteristic of the authentic chicken progesterone receptor. To test for progesterone receptor-mediated activation of transcription in yeast, reporter plasmids were constructed to transform yeast cells expressing PRB or C1C2 receptors. The reporter gene contained two copies of a progesterone response element upstream of the yeast proximal CYC1 promoter fused to the beta-galactosidase gene of Escherichia coli. The induction of beta-galactosidase activity by PRB and C1C2 was strictly dependent on specific ligand and the presence of a progesterone response element. However, overproduced C1C2 receptors had an adverse effect on the transcription of the lacZ gene. It was found that when overproduced C1C2 was activated by progesterone, an inhibitory effect on normal yeast cell growth was evident. These observations suggest that C1C2 is a potent trans-acting factor in yeast and that the amino-terminal domain of the chicken progesterone receptor may play a role in selective modulation of target gene activation."
https://openalex.org/W2001129845,The contribution of the anticodon to the discrimination between cognate and noncognate tRNAs by Escherichia coli Arg-tRNA synthetase has been investigated by in vitro synthesis and aminoacylation of elongator methionine tRNA (tRNA(mMet) mutants. Substitution of the Arg anticodon CCG for the Met anticodon CAU leads to a dramatic increase in Arg acceptance by tRNA(mMet). A nucleotide (A20) previously identified by others in the dihydrouridine loop of tRNA(Arg)s makes a smaller contribution to the conversion of tRNA(mMet) identity from Met to Arg. The combined anticodon and dihydrouridine loop mutations yield a tRNA(mMet) derivative that is aminoacylated with near-normal kinetics by the Arg-tRNA synthetase.
https://openalex.org/W1552371515,"Abstract Mammalian S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase was expressed at a high level in an Escherichia coli mutant deficient in this enzyme. The proenzyme form of this enzyme was cleaved and processed to the mature decarboxylase which contains two pairs of nonidentical subunits, the larger of which contains a pyruvate prosthetic group. In order to determine the site of formation of the pyruvate, two approaches were used. First, the mammalian S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase produced in E. coli was purified to homogeneity and the pyruvate converted to alanine by a reductive amination. The large subunit was then isolated by reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography and the amino-terminal sequence determined and compared with the sequence of the proenzyme derived from its cDNA. These results indicated that the bond between glutamic acid 67 and serine 68 was the site of cleavage. Second, each of the serine residues in portion of the proenzyme likely to contain the cleavage site were altered by site-directed mutagenesis and the RNA produced from plasmids containing these mutations was translated in a reticulocyte lysate. The translation products were tested for processing and for S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase activity. Altering the serine residues at positions 50, 66, and 69 to alanines had little effect but changing serine at position 68 to alanine completely prevented both processing and activity. These results indicate that the serine residue at position 68 of the proenzyme which is in the underlined position in the sequence -Leu-Ser-Glu-Ser-Ser-Met- is the residue which is converted to the pyruvate prosthetic group in human S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase."

https://openalex.org/W1511378341,"Abstract The mechanism(s) of force development in vascular smooth muscle following pharmacological activation of protein kinase C by phorbol esters are not known. In this study, we examined the myosin light chain phosphorylation response following stimulation by phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDB) or phenylephrine in rabbit aorta which had been incubated with 32PO4 in order to label ATP pools. Through tryptic phosphopeptide mapping of myosin light chain from intact tissue and comparison to controls using purified components, we inferred that Ca2+-dependent force stimulated by PDB was associated with small increases in serine-19 phosphorylation, consistent with a contractile mechanism involving indirect activation of myosin light chain kinase. Additional residues, consistent with the in vitro substrate specificity of protein kinase C, were also observed to be phosphorylated in response to PDB and represented proportionately a larger fraction of the total phosphorylated myosin light chain in Ca2+-depleted tissues. Stimulation by an alpha 1-adrenergic agonist (phenylephrine) resulted in phosphorylation of residues which were consistent with an activation mechanism involving myosin light chain kinase only. These results indicate that in rabbit aorta the contractile effects of PDB may be partially mediated by Ca2+-dependent activation of myosin light chain kinase. However, the data do not rule out a component of the PDB-stimulated contractile response which is independent of myosin light chain phosphorylation on the serine-19 residue. In addition, activation by a more physiological stimulus, phenylephrine, does not result in protein kinase C-mediated myosin light chain phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1581059682,"As part of an analysis of the function and assembly of the mitochondrial outer membrane, we have cloned and characterized the yeast gene encoding a 45-kDa polypeptide (OM45) which is a major constituent of this membrane. The nuclear gene was isolated by immunological screening of plaques of recombinant phage lambda gt11 containing fragments of yeast genomic DNA using an antibody against OM45. Determination of the nucleotide sequence of the DNA fragment isolated by this approach revealed a single open reading frame of 1179 base pairs which encodes a protein having a predicted molecular mass of 44.6-kDa. Disruption of the OM45 gene in haploid yeast cells eliminated the expression of OM45. The mutant strain showed no apparent defect in cell viability, growth, mitochondrial function, or mitochondrial protein import."
https://openalex.org/W2085126456,"Previously, we described a 62 kd protein that is a component of the isolated sea urchin mitotic apparatus. This protein is a substrate for an endogenous, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase also associated with the mitotic apparatus. Phosphorylation of the 62 kd protein directly correlates with the depolymerization of microtubules in isolated mitotic apparatuses. Here we report a test of the function of the 62 kd protein in vivo. Double labeling studies using a monoclonal antibody to tubulin and an affinity purified antibody specific for the 62 kd protein reveal that the 62 kd protein co-localizes with mitotic apparatus microtubules. When affinity purified antibodies to the 62 kd protein were microinjected into dividing sea urchin embryos, mitosis was blocked in a stage-specific manner. The results are discussed with respect to the role of the 62 kd protein in the metaphase-anaphase transition."
https://openalex.org/W1541563378,"We report that degradation of proteins microinjected into human fibroblasts is accompanied by release into the culture medium of peptide fragments and intact proteins as well as single amino acids. For the nine proteins and polypeptides microinjected, acid-precipitable radioactivity, i.e. peptide fragments and/or intact proteins, ranged from 10 to 67% of the total released radioactivity. Peptide fragments and/or intact protein accounted for 60% of the radioactivity released into the medium by cells microinjected with ribonuclease A. Two major radiolabeled peptide fragments were found, and one was of an appropriate size to function as an antigen in antigen-presenting cells. The peptides released from microinjected ribonuclease A were derived from lysosomal pathways of proteolysis based on several lines of evidence. Previous studies have shown that microinjected ribonuclease A is degraded to single amino acids entirely within lysosomes (McElligott, M. A., Miao, P., and Dice, J. F. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 11986-11993). We show that release of free amino acids and peptide fragments and/or intact protein was equivalently stimulated by serum deprivation and equivalently inhibited by NH4Cl. We also show that lysosomal degradation of endocytosed [3H]ribonuclease A was accompanied by the release of two peptide fragments similar in size and charge to those from microinjected [3H]ribonuclease A. These findings demonstrate that degradation within lysosomes occurs in a manner that spares specific peptides; they also suggest a previously unsuspected pathway by which cells can secrete cytosol-derived polypeptides."

https://openalex.org/W1569113215,"In Escherichia coli cells, there is a protein that specifically binds to DNA replication terminus (ter) sites on the host and plasmid genome and then blocks progress of the DNA replication fork. We reported that extract of the cells carrying the plasmid with the tau gene, which was identified to be an essential gene for the termination reaction at the ter site, contained about an 8-fold increase in ter-binding activity of the plasmid-free cells. With improvement of the promoter region of the tau gene on the plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis, the host cells produced the ter-binding protein (Ter protein) over 2,000-fold. Using these over-producing cells as the enzyme source, the Ter protein was purified to apparent homogeneity. Molecular mass 36,000, amino-terminal amino acid sequence (45 residues) and composition of the protein were in good agreement with those deduced from DNA sequence of the tau gene. Footprinting using the purified Ter protein revealed a specific binding to the ter sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2155368893,"The molecular mechanisms of the pacemakers underlying circadian rhythms are not well understood. One molecule that presumably functions in the circadian clock of Drosophila is the product of the period (per) gene, which dramatically affects biological rhythms when mutated. An antibody specific for the per protein labels putative circadian pacemaker neurons and fibers in eyes of two marine gastropods, Aplysia and Bulla. As was found for the Drosophila per protein, there is a daily rhythm in the levels of the per-like antigen in Aplysia eyes. Thus, certain molecular features of the per protein, as well as aspects of the temporal regulation of its expression, may be conserved in circadian pacemakers of widely divergent species."
https://openalex.org/W1561551012,"Eukaryotes have been proposed to depend on AMP deaminase as a primary step in the regulation of intracellular adenine nucleotide pools. This report describes 1) the role of AMP deaminase in adenylate metabolism in yeast cell extracts, 2) a method for large scale purification of the enzyme, 3) the kinetic properties of native and proteolyzed enzymes, 4) the kinetic reaction mechanism, and 5) regulatory interactions with ATP, GTP, MgATP, ADP, and PO4. Allosteric regulation of yeast AMP deaminase is of physiological significance, since expression of the gene is constitutive (Meyer, S. L., Kvalnes-Krick, K. L., and Schramm, V. L. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 8734-8743). The metabolism of ATP in cell-free extracts of yeast demonstrates that AMP deaminase is the sole pathway of AMP catabolism in these extracts. Purification of the enzyme from bakers' yeast yields a proteolytically cleaved enzyme, Mr 86,000, which is missing 192 amino acids from the N-terminal region. Extracts of Escherichia coli containing a plasmid with the gene for yeast AMP deaminase contained only the unproteolyzed enzyme, Mr 100,000. The unproteolyzed enzyme is highly unstable during purification. Substrate saturation plots for proteolyzed AMP deaminase are sigmoidal. In the presence of ATP, the allosteric activator, the enzyme exhibits normal saturation kinetics. ATP activates the proteolyzed AMP deaminase by increasing the affinity for AMP from 1.3 to 0.2 mM without affecting VM. Activation by ATP is more efficient than MgATP, with half-maximum activation constants of 6 and 80 microM, respectively. The kinetic properties of the proteolyzed and unproteolyzed AMP deaminase are similar. Thus, the N-terminal region is not required for catalysis or allosteric activation. AMP deaminase is competitively inhibited by GTP and PO4 with respect to AMP. The inhibition constants for these inhibitors decrease in the presence of ATP. ATP, therefore, tightens the binding of GTP, PO4, and AMP. The products of the reaction, NH3 and IMP, are competitive inhibitors against substrate, consistent with a rapid equilibrium random kinetic mechanism. Kinetic dissociation constants are reported for the binary and ternary substrate and product complexes and the allosteric modulators."
https://openalex.org/W2042316763,"When explants or reaggregates of small neurons from early postnatal mouse cerebella are plated on a mixture of laminin and poly-d-lysine, one observes small cells with an orientation of processes largely perpendicular to the direction of granule cell neurites after several days. These cells first have a bipolar morphology and then elaborate a rich dendritic arbor-like structure opposite a long, thin axon-like process. Several lines of evidence suggest that these cells are the small inhibitory interneurons of the cerebellar cortex: They take up GABA, express high levels of the embryonic form of N-CAM, do not express L1, the oligodendrocyte marker O4, or the glial marker vimentin, and display ultrastructural features reminiscent of stellate and/or basket cells in vivo. These observations suggest that the elaboration of directional positioning of small inhibitory interneurons can be studied in culture, thus offering the possibility to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the orientation of particular neural cells with regard to others."

The coding segment for mature LA was subcloned into the T7 expression system of Studier and co-workers (Studier, F.W., and Moffatt, B.A. (1986) J. Mol. Biol. 189, 113-130; Rosenberg, A.H., Lade, B.N., Chui, D.S., Lin, S.W., Dunn, J.J., and Studier, F.W. (1987) Gene (Amst.) 56, 125-135) and expressed as a 21-kDa fusion protein that consisted of the mature bovine LA sequence connected to the NH2-terminal 50 residues of human cathepsin D by a linker sequence containing protease cleavage sites. This fusion protein was expressed in an insoluble form and accumulated to about 50% of the total bacterial protein within 3 h after induction of T7 RNA polymerase synthesis. The protein was solubilized, purified by gel filtration, and converted to an active form by treatment with mixtures of reduced and oxidized glutathione in the presence of Ca2+. The maximum specific activity of the fusion protein was about 25% of that of native LA, suggesting that the attachment of an NH2-terminal extension sterically hinders but does not prevent the interaction with galactosyltransferase. The extension also does not block the binding of the regulatory Ca2+ ion that is required for folding from the reduced denatured state. Trypsin cleaved the folded fusion protein specifically at a Lys-Glu bond at the junction with the mature LA sequence to give a product indistinguishable in structure and activity from native LA."
https://openalex.org/W1492655269,"Abstract recA protein binding to duplex DNA is enhanced when a B form DNA substrate is replaced with a left-handed Z form helix. This represents a kinetic rather than an equilibrium effect. Binding to Z DNA is much faster than binding to B DNA. In other respects, binding to the two DNA forms is quite similar. recA protein binds to B or Z DNA with a stoichiometry of 1 monomer/4 base pairs. The final protein filament exhibits a right-handed helical structure when either B or Z form DNAs are bound. There are only two evident differences: the kcat for ATP hydrolysis is reduced 3-4-fold when Z DNA is bound, and recA binding at equilibrium is less stable on Z DNA than on B DNA. At steady state, the binding favors B DNA in competition experiments. The results indicate that Z DNA binding by recA protein follows the same pathway as for recA binding to B DNA, but that the nucleation step is faster on the Z form helix."
https://openalex.org/W1499335874,"Abstract Crystals of the vitamin B1-dependent enzyme transketolase from baker's yeast have been grown from the apo- and the holoform of the enzyme, using PEG as precipitant.

The crystals are stable in the x-ray beam and diffract to at least 2.2 A on a conventional x-ray source. The enzyme is a dimer of identical subunits, and a Vm value of 2.2 A/dalton indicates that the asymmetric unit contains a dimer. Rotation function calculations using native data (10-5 A) revealed a local 2-fold rotation axis with phi = 0 degree and omega = 20 degrees."

https://openalex.org/W1555597157,"The EnvZ protein is a bacterial protein kinase, which specifically phosphorylates the activator protein, OmpR, involved in expression of the ompF and ompC genes in Escherichia coli. The phosphotransfer between the EnvZ and OmpR proteins was postulated to be involved in the signal transduction in response to an environmental osmotic stimulus. In this study, we isolated a novel type of envZ mutant, in which a base substitution resulted in a Tyr-to-Ser conversion at amino acid residue 351 of the EnvZ protein. This single amino acid conversion was found to dramatically affect the functions of the EnvZ protein. The mutant EnvZ protein was defective in its ability not only as to OmpR-phosphorylation but also as to OmpR-dephosphorylation. The envZ mutant, termed envZ30, was isolated as a pseudorevertant, which phenotypically suppresses an ompR3-type mutant exhibiting an OmpF- OmpC-constitutive phenotype. These results will be discussed in relation to the structure and function of the protein kinase, EnvZ."
https://openalex.org/W1595719238,"Abstract Colicin E3 is a ribonuclease that inactivates Escherichia coli ribosomes by cleaving the RNA of the small ribosomal subunit after nucleotide 1493. A series of oligodeoxynucleotides that complement 16 S RNA in the region of the colicin cleavage site has been synthesized, and their ability to form complexes with 30 S ribosomal subunits has been measured using a nitrocellulose filter-binding assay. The most efficiently bound probe, complementary to residues 1485-1496, was modified with antibody-recognizable derivatives at the 5'-end, the 3'-end, or both. Antibody-oligonucleotide-subunit complexes were then generated and examined by electron microscopy. Antibody binding was seen at the tip of the platform of the 30 S subunit. The complementary oligonucleotide and thus the site at which colcin E3 cleavage occurs is therefore in the same physical region as the 3'-end of the 16 S ribosomal RNA and its message-positioning Shine-Dal-garno sequence."
https://openalex.org/W35955044,"Abstract The mechanism of sorting, to the outer membrane, of the 325-residue Escherichia coli protein OmpA has been investigated. It is thought to traverse the membrane eight times in antiparallel beta-strands, forming an amphiphilic beta-barrel which encompasses residues 1 to about 170; the COOH-terminal moiety is periplasmic. A mutant, carrying the substitutions Leu164----Pro and Val166----Asp within the last beta-strand (residues 160-170), has been described which was unable to assemble in the membrane (Klose, M., MacIntyre, S., Schwarz, H., and Henning, U. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 13297-13302). Linkers were inserted between the codons for residues 164 and 165 of the mutant protein. Of 13 different genes recovered, five encoded proteins which had regained the ability to assemble in the membrane. The properties of the mutant proteins, together with a structure prediction method, indicate the following rules for the final beta-strand to be compatible with, or possibly initiate, membrane insertion: (i) it must be amphiphilic or hydrophobic while its primary structure as such is fairly unimportant, (ii) it must extend over at least 9 residues, and (iii) it must not contain a proline residue around its center. One of the genes recovered coded for OmpA up to residue 164 and then followed by 10 linker-encoded residues. This 174-residue polypeptide was assembled in the membrane but did not, in contrast to all other proteins, expose sites sensitive to trypsin at the inner face of the membrane. This behavior agrees perfectly well with the OmpA model."
https://openalex.org/W1505693567,"Limited proteolysis of a recombinant, soluble form of the Tac protein, a human interleukin-2 receptor (rIL-2R), was performed using trypsin, Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease and proteinase K to study the structural requirements of interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) for interleukin-2 (IL-2) binding. Sensitive proteolytic sites were found to be clustered in the regions of the polypeptide encoded by exons 3, 5, and 6, with a few semi-sensitive sites located within the two homologous domains encoded by exons 2 and 4. A number of nicked and truncated rIL-2R species generated by proteolysis were assayed for IL-2 binding using recombinant IL-2 (rIL-2) affinity gel and then structurally characterized. The results demonstrated that only the species that consist of the regions encoded by exons 2 and 4, joined by five disulfide bonds, are capable of binding IL-2 and that the presence of semi-sensitive cleavage sites within the two homologous domains had no apparent effect on IL-2 binding. These results suggest that the pattern of the sensitive cleavage sites in rIL-2R is closely related to the structural requirements for IL-2 binding. Based on the experimental results, a highly symmetrical core structure of IL-2R with a total of 135 amino acid residues was identified. This is the smallest protein moiety so far known to be capable of binding IL-2."
https://openalex.org/W70348054,"Abstract We have examined the mechanism of the carbohydrate induction of rat hepatic mRNA-S14 to the intragastric administration of sucrose and its constituent hexoses, fructose and glucose. A maximal sucrose response (26-fold) was obtained with 2 ml of 60% sucrose/100 g of body weight, yet equimolar concentrations of fructose and glucose were not able to reproduce the response. Fructose yielded less than one-third the response observed with sucrose, whereas glucose administration was ineffective. On the other hand, the simultaneous administration of both hexoses restored the full response observed with sucrose. The synergism between fructose and glucose was not due to the administration of extra calories or enhanced insulin release but was correlated with altered carbohydrate metabolism as reflected by the hepatic pyruvate content (0.058 +/- 0.003 mumol/g fasting, 0.067 +/- 0.009 glucose treated, 0.218 +/- 0.030 fructose treated, 0.292 +/- 0.015 sucrose treated). The time course of induction of mRNA-S14 nuclear precursor in response to fructose, glucose, or sucrose correlated with the mature mRNA-S14 values. In addition, enhanced transcriptional activity of the S14 gene was observed after sucrose feeding (from 25 +/- 8 ppm baseline to 108 +/- 40 ppm at 4 h) and fructose feeding (40 +/- 21 ppm at 4 h). These studies demonstrate that the carbohydrate regulation of mRNA-S14 is due to a synergistic interaction between fructose and glucose reflected in the hepatic pyruvate content and leading to the induction of the nuclear precursor with an associated increase in transcriptional activity of the S14 gene."
https://openalex.org/W1563765887,"Both receptor subunits were functionally labeled in order to provide methods allowing, in live cells and in broken cell systems, concomitant evaluation of the insulin receptor dual function, hormone binding, and kinase activity. In cell-free systems, insulin receptors were labeled on their alpha-subunit with 125I-photoreactive insulin, and on their beta-subunit by autophosphorylation. Thereafter, phosphorylated receptors were separated from the complete set of receptors by means of anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Using this approach, a subpopulation of receptors was found which had bound insulin, but which were not phosphorylated. Under nonreducing conditions, receptors appeared in three oligomeric species identified as alpha 2 beta 2, alpha 2 beta, and alpha 2. Mainly the alpha 2 beta 2 receptor species was found to be phosphorylated while insulin was bound to alpha 2 beta 2, alpha 2 beta, and alpha 2 forms. In live cells, biosynthetic labeling of insulin receptors was used. Receptors were first labeled with [35S]methionine. Subsequently, the addition of insulin led to receptor autophosphorylation by virtue of the endogenous ATP pool. The total amount of [35S]methionine-labeled receptors was precipitated with antireceptor antibodies, whereas with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, only the phosphorylated receptors were isolated. Using this approach we made the two following key findings: (1) Both receptor species, alpha 2 beta 2 and alpha 2 beta, are present in live cells and in comparable amounts. This indicates that the alpha 2 beta form is not a degradation product of the alpha 2 beta 2 form artificially generated during receptor preparation. (2) The alpha 2 beta 2 species is the prevalently autophosphorylated form."

https://openalex.org/W1604842333,"A new experimental approach, site-directed chemical modification, was used to explore relationships between RNA polymerase-promoter interactions and function. For this study, the lacUV5 promoter with an exposed -10 thymine on the non-template strand was constructed. Osmium tetroxide was selected as the thymine modifying reagent. Modification occurred predominantly at the exposed -10 T with 5-fold less reactivity at the -12 T residue. The isolated modified strand was used to reconstitute a lacUV5 promoter with -10 (-12) adducts. OsO4 modification at both the -10 and -12 positions of the lacUV5 promoter significantly enhances Escherichia coli RNA polymerase-promoter open complex formation relative to the unmodified promoter. DNase I cleavage sites at -7, -8, and -10 of the unmodified promoter were rendered insusceptible to scission in the modified promoter. However, no difference can be detected in the RNA polymerase footprints for unmodified versus modified open complexes. The latter are fully capable of productive transcription with comparable amounts of identical run-off transcripts to unmodified open complexes. A 16 degrees C reduction in Tm was found for a 14-base pair oligonucleotide duplex containing a single OsO4-bispyridine adduct. The latter result suggests that open complex formation appears to be enhanced due to promoter unpairing at the -10 (-12) adduct sites."
https://openalex.org/W1911402315,"We have shown by genetic mapping, molecular cloning, and DNA sequencing that four Escherichia coli mutants, which express the adaptive response to alkylation damage constitutively, are mutated in the ada gene. All four mutant ada genes have two GC to AT transition mutations in the coding region and encode altered Ada proteins with two amino acid substitutions in the N-terminal domain. E. coli carrying the mutated ada genes on recombinant plasmids overexpressed both the mutated ada gene and the chromosomal alkA gene. This observation indicates that the mutant Ada proteins act as strong positive regulators of the ada and alkA genes in the absence of DNA alkylation. One mutant protein, Ada-11, was shown to be a strong activator of ada gene expression in a cell-free system. An altered pattern of tryptic digestion of the Ada-11 protein compared with the wild-type Ada protein suggested that it has a different conformation. One amino acid substitution, namely methionine residue 126 replaced by isoleucine, occurred in all four mutant Ada proteins, and this mutation alone was sufficient to convert the Ada protein into a strong activator of ada and alkA gene expression in vivo."
