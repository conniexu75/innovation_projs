https://openalex.org/W3048641542,"Conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1)1 are thought to perform antigen cross-presentation, which is required to prime CD8+ T cells2,3, whereas cDC2 are specialized for priming CD4+ T cells4,5. CD4+ T cells are also considered to help CD8+ T cell responses through a variety of mechanisms6-11, including a process whereby CD4+ T cells 'license' cDC1 for CD8+ T cell priming12. However, this model has not been directly tested in vivo or in the setting of help-dependent tumour rejection. Here we generated an Xcr1Cre mouse strain to evaluate the cellular interactions that mediate tumour rejection in a model requiring CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. As expected, tumour rejection required cDC1 and CD8+ T cell priming required the expression of major histocompatibility class I molecules by cDC1. Unexpectedly, early priming of CD4+ T cells against tumour-derived antigens also required cDC1, and this was not simply because they transport antigens to lymph nodes for processing by cDC2, as selective deletion of major histocompatibility class II molecules in cDC1 also prevented early CD4+ T cell priming. Furthermore, deletion of either major histocompatibility class II or CD40 in cDC1 impaired tumour rejection, consistent with a role for cognate CD4+ T cell interactions and CD40 signalling in cDC1 licensing. Finally, CD40 signalling in cDC1 was critical not only for CD8+ T cell priming, but also for initial CD4+ T cell activation. Thus, in the setting of tumour-derived antigens, cDC1 function as an autonomous platform capable of antigen processing and priming for both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and of the direct orchestration of their cross-talk that is required for optimal anti-tumour immunity."

https://openalex.org/W3048569636,"Serine, glycine and other nonessential amino acids are critical for tumour progression, and strategies to limit their availability are emerging as potential therapies for cancer1-3. However, the molecular mechanisms driving this response remain unclear and the effects on lipid metabolism are relatively unexplored. Serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) catalyses the de novo biosynthesis of sphingolipids but also produces noncanonical 1-deoxysphingolipids when using alanine as a substrate4,5. Deoxysphingolipids accumulate in the context of mutations in SPTLC1 or SPTLC26,7-or in conditions of low serine availability8,9-to drive neuropathy, and deoxysphinganine has previously been investigated as an anti-cancer agent10. Here we exploit amino acid metabolism and the promiscuity of SPT to modulate the endogenous synthesis of toxic deoxysphingolipids and slow tumour progression. Anchorage-independent growth reprogrammes a metabolic network involving serine, alanine and pyruvate that drives the endogenous synthesis and accumulation of deoxysphingolipids. Targeting the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier promotes alanine oxidation to mitigate deoxysphingolipid synthesis and improve spheroid growth, similar to phenotypes observed with the direct inhibition of SPT or ceramide synthesis. Restriction of dietary serine and glycine potently induces the accumulation of deoxysphingolipids while decreasing tumour growth in xenograft models in mice. Pharmacological inhibition of SPT rescues xenograft growth in mice fed diets restricted in serine and glycine, and the reduction of circulating serine by inhibition of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) leads to the accumulation of deoxysphingolipids and mitigates tumour growth. The promiscuity of SPT therefore links serine and mitochondrial alanine metabolism to membrane lipid diversity, which further sensitizes tumours to metabolic stress."
https://openalex.org/W3048598023,"Natural mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations enable the inference of clonal relationships among cells. mtDNA can be profiled along with measures of cell state, but has not yet been combined with the massively parallel approaches needed to tackle the complexity of human tissue. Here, we introduce a high-throughput, droplet-based mitochondrial single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (scATAC-seq), a method that combines high-confidence mtDNA mutation calling in thousands of single cells with their concomitant high-quality accessible chromatin profile. This enables the inference of mtDNA heteroplasmy, clonal relationships, cell state and accessible chromatin variation in individual cells. We reveal single-cell variation in heteroplasmy of a pathologic mtDNA variant, which we associate with intra-individual chromatin variability and clonal evolution. We clonally trace thousands of cells from cancers, linking epigenomic variability to subclonal evolution, and infer cellular dynamics of differentiating hematopoietic cells in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our approach enables the study of cellular population dynamics and clonal properties in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3048696433,"Tropical soils contain one-third of the carbon stored in soils globally1, so destabilization of soil organic matter caused by the warming predicted for tropical regions this century2 could accelerate climate change by releasing additional carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere3–6. Theory predicts that warming should cause only modest carbon loss from tropical soils relative to those at higher latitudes5,7, but there have been no warming experiments in tropical forests to test this8. Here we show that in situ experimental warming of a lowland tropical forest soil on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, caused an unexpectedly large increase in soil CO2 emissions. Two years of warming of the whole soil profile by four degrees Celsius increased CO2 emissions by 55 per cent compared to soils at ambient temperature. The additional CO2 originated from heterotrophic rather than autotrophic sources, and equated to a loss of 8.2 ± 4.2 (one standard error) tonnes of carbon per hectare per year from the breakdown of soil organic matter. During this time, we detected no acclimation of respiration rates, no thermal compensation or change in the temperature sensitivity of enzyme activities, and no change in microbial carbon-use efficiency. These results demonstrate that soil carbon in tropical forests is highly sensitive to warming, creating a potentially substantial positive feedback to climate change. When tropical forest soils are warmed in situ, they release more CO2 than predicted by theory, creating a potentially substantial positive feedback to climate change."
https://openalex.org/W3103237439,"Two-dimensional atomic crystals can radically change their properties in response to external influences such as substrate orientation or strain, resulting in essentially new materials in terms of the electronic structure. A striking example is the creation of flat-bands in bilayer-graphene for certain 'magic' twist-angles between the orientations of the two layers. The quenched kinetic-energy in these flat-bands promotes electron-electron interactions and facilitates the emergence of strongly-correlated phases such as superconductivity and correlated-insulators. However, the exquisite fine-tuning required for finding the magic-angle where flat-bands appear in twisted-bilayer graphene, poses challenges to fabrication and scalability. Here we present an alternative route to creating flat-bands that does not involve fine tuning. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, together with numerical simulations, we demonstrate that graphene monolayers placed on an atomically-flat substrate can be forced to undergo a buckling-transition, resulting in a periodically modulated pseudo-magnetic field, which in turn creates a post-graphene material with flat electronic bands. Bringing the Fermi-level into these flat-bands by electrostatic doping, we observe a pseudogap-like depletion in the density-of-states, which signals the emergence of a correlated-state. The described approach of 2D crystal buckling offers a strategy for creating other superlattice systems and, in particular, for exploring interaction phenomena characteristic of flat-bands."

https://openalex.org/W3048433228,"Salicylic acid (SA) is a plant hormone that is critical for resistance to pathogens1-3. The NPR proteins have previously been identified as SA receptors4-10, although how they perceive SA and coordinate hormonal signalling remain unknown. Here we report the mapping of the SA-binding core of Arabidopsis thaliana NPR4 and its ligand-bound crystal structure. The SA-binding core domain of NPR4 refolded with SA adopts an α-helical fold that completely buries SA in its hydrophobic core. The lack of a ligand-entry pathway suggests that SA binding involves a major conformational remodelling of the SA-binding core of NPR4, which we validated using hydrogen-deuterium-exchange mass spectrometry analysis of the full-length protein and through SA-induced disruption of interactions between NPR1 and NPR4. We show that, despite the two proteins sharing nearly identical hormone-binding residues, NPR1 displays minimal SA-binding activity compared to NPR4. We further identify two surface residues of the SA-binding core, the mutation of which can alter the SA-binding ability of NPR4 and its interaction with NPR1. We also demonstrate that expressing a variant of NPR4 that is hypersensitive to SA could enhance SA-mediated basal immunity without compromising effector-triggered immunity, because the ability of this variant to re-associate with NPR1 at high levels of SA remains intact. By revealing the structural mechanisms of SA perception by NPR proteins, our work paves the way for future investigation of the specific roles of these proteins in SA signalling and their potential for engineering plant immunity."
https://openalex.org/W3048630403,"The activation of abundant molecules such as hydrocarbons and atmospheric nitrogen (N2) remains a challenge because these molecules are often inert. The formation of carbon–nitrogen bonds from N2 typically has required reactive organic precursors that are incompatible with the reducing conditions that promote N2 reactivity1, which has prevented catalysis. Here we report a diketiminate-supported iron system that sequentially activates benzene and N2 to form aniline derivatives. The key to this coupling reaction is the partial silylation of a reduced iron–dinitrogen complex, followed by migration of a benzene-derived aryl group to the nitrogen. Further reduction releases N2-derived aniline, and the resulting iron species can re-enter the cyclic pathway. Specifically, we show that an easily prepared diketiminate iron bromide complex2 mediates the one-pot conversion of several petroleum-derived arenes into the corresponding silylated aniline derivatives, by using a mixture of sodium powder, crown ether, trimethylsilyl bromide and N2 as the nitrogen source. Numerous compounds along the cyclic pathway are isolated and crystallographically characterized, and their reactivity supports a mechanism for sequential hydrocarbon activation and N2 functionalization. This strategy couples nitrogen atoms from N2 with abundant hydrocarbons, and maps a route towards future catalytic systems. An iron complex sequentially activates N2 and C–H bonds in benzene to form aniline, with coupling achieved through partial silylation of a reduced iron–nitrogen complex and phenyl migration."
https://openalex.org/W3048854834,"Of the two stable forms of graphite, hexagonal (HG) and rhombohedral (RG), the former is more common and has been studied extensively. RG is less stable, which so far precluded its detailed investigation, despite many theoretical predictions about the abundance of exotic interaction-induced physics. Advances in van der Waals heterostructure technology have now allowed us to make high-quality RG films up to 50 graphene layers thick and study their transport properties. We find that the bulk electronic states in such RG are gapped and, at low temperatures, electron transport is dominated by surface states. Because of topological protection, the surface states are robust and of high quality, allowing the observation of the quantum Hall effect, where RG exhibits phase transitions between gapless semimetallic phase and gapped quantum spin Hall phase with giant Berry curvature. An energy gap can also be opened in the surface states by breaking their inversion symmetry via applying a perpendicular electric field. Moreover, in RG films thinner than 4 nm, a gap is present even without an external electric field. This spontaneous gap opening shows pronounced hysteresis and other signatures characteristic of electronic phase separation, which we attribute to emergence of strongly-correlated electronic surface states."

https://openalex.org/W3048448785,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) resides in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria where it is responsible for barrier function1,2. LPS can cause death as a result of septic shock, and its lipid A core is the target of polymyxin antibiotics3,4. Despite the clinical importance of polymyxins and the emergence of multidrug resistant strains5, our understanding of the bacterial factors that regulate LPS biogenesis is incomplete. Here we characterize the inner membrane protein PbgA and report that its depletion attenuates the virulence of Escherichia coli by reducing levels of LPS and outer membrane integrity. In contrast to previous claims that PbgA functions as a cardiolipin transporter6–9, our structural analyses and physiological studies identify a lipid A-binding motif along the periplasmic leaflet of the inner membrane. Synthetic PbgA-derived peptides selectively bind to LPS in vitro and inhibit the growth of diverse Gram-negative bacteria, including polymyxin-resistant strains. Proteomic, genetic and pharmacological experiments uncover a model in which direct periplasmic sensing of LPS by PbgA coordinates the biosynthesis of lipid A by regulating the stability of LpxC, a key cytoplasmic biosynthetic enzyme10–12. In summary, we find that PbgA has an unexpected but essential role in the regulation of LPS biogenesis, presents a new structural basis for the selective recognition of lipids, and provides opportunities for future antibiotic discovery. Structural and physiological studies show that the inner membrane protein PbgA is a crucial sensor of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and regulates the activity of the LPS biosynthesis enzyme LpxC."

https://openalex.org/W3048367007,"Traditionally, machine learning algorithms relied on reliable labels from experts to build predictions. More recently however, algorithms have been receiving data from the general population in the form of labeling, annotations, etc. The result is that algorithms are subject to bias that is born from ingesting unchecked information, such as biased samples and biased labels. Furthermore, people and algorithms are increasingly engaged in interactive processes wherein neither the human nor the algorithms receive unbiased data. Algorithms can also make biased predictions, leading to what is now known as algorithmic bias. On the other hand, human’s reaction to the output of machine learning methods with algorithmic bias worsen the situations by making decision based on biased information, which will probably be consumed by algorithms later. Some recent research has focused on the ethical and moral implication of machine learning algorithmic bias on society. However, most research has so far treated algorithmic bias as a static factor, which fails to capture the dynamic and iterative properties of bias. We argue that algorithmic bias interacts with humans in an iterative manner, which has a long-term effect on algorithms’ performance. For this purpose, we present an iterated-learning framework that is inspired from human language evolution to study the interaction between machine learning algorithms and humans. Our goal is to study two sources of bias that interact: the process by which people select information to label (human action); and the process by which an algorithm selects the subset of information to present to people (iterated algorithmic bias mode). We investigate three forms of iterated algorithmic bias (personalization filter, active learning, and random) and how they affect the performance of machine learning algorithms by formulating research questions about the impact of each type of bias. Based on statistical analyses of the results of several controlled experiments, we found that the three different iterated bias modes, as well as initial training data class imbalance and human action, do affect the models learned by machine learning algorithms. We also found that iterated filter bias, which is prominent in personalized user interfaces, can lead to more inequality in estimated relevance and to a limited human ability to discover relevant data. Our findings indicate that the relevance blind spot (items from the testing set whose predicted relevance probability is less than 0.5 and who thus risk being hidden from humans) amounted to 4% of all relevant items when using a content-based filter that predicts relevant items. A similar simulation using a real-life rating data set found that the same filter resulted in a blind spot size of 75% of the relevant testing set."
https://openalex.org/W3049389801,"Natural history collections are yielding more information as digitization brings specimen data to researchers, connects specimens across museums, and as new technologies allow for more large-scale data collection. Therefore, a key goal in specimen digitization is developing methods that both increase access and allow for the highest yield of phenomic data. 3D digitization is increasingly popular because it has the potential to meet both aspects of that key goal. However, current methods overlook or do not prioritize some of the most sought-after phenotypic traits, those involving the external appearance of specimens, especially color. Here, we introduce an efficient and cost-effective pipeline for 3D photogrammetry to capture the external appearance of natural history specimens and other museum objects. 3D photogrammetry aligns and compares sets of dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of photos to create 3D models. The hardware set-up requires little physical space and around $3,000 in initial investment, while the software pipeline requires $1,400/year for proprietary software subscriptions (with open-source alternatives). The creation of each 3D model takes 1–2 hours/specimen and much of the software pipeline is automated with minimal supervision required, including the onerous step of mesh processing. We showcase the method by creating 3D models for most of the type specimens in the Moore Laboratory of Zoology bird collection and show that digital bill measurements are comparable to hand-taken measurements. Color data, while not included as part of this pipeline, is easily extractable from the models and one of the most promising areas of data collection. Future advances can adapt the method for ultraviolet reflectance capture and increased efficiency and model quality. Combined with genomic data, phenomic data from 3D models including photogrammetry will open new doors to understanding organismal evolution."

A total of 119 undergraduates completed a memory task and the Smartphone Addiction Scale (SAS). As predicted, those without smartphones had higher recall accuracy compared to those with smartphones. Results showed a significant negative relationship between phone conscious thought, “how often did you think about your phone”, and memory recall but not for SAS and memory recall. Phone conscious thought significantly predicted memory accuracy. We found that the presence of a smartphone and high phone conscious thought affects one’s memory learning and recall, indicating the negative effect of a smartphone proximity to our learning and memory."
https://openalex.org/W3049335804,"Objective To predict spontaneous preterm birth among pregnant women in an African American population using first trimester peripheral blood maternal immune cell microRNA. Study design This was a retrospective nested case-control study in pregnant patients enrolled between March 2006 and October 2016. For initial study inclusion, samples were selected that met the following criteria: 1) singleton pregnancy; 2) maternal body mass index (BMI) <30 kg/m2; 3) blood sample drawn between 6 weeks to 12 weeks 6 days gestation; 4) live born neonate with no detectable birth defects. Using these entry criteria, 486 samples were selected for study inclusion. After sample quality was confirmed, 139 term deliveries (38–42 weeks) and 18 spontaneous preterm deliveries (<35 weeks) were selected for analysis. Samples were divided into training and validation sets. Real time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (rt-qPCR) was performed on each sample for 45 microRNAs. MicroRNA Risk Scores were calculated on the training set and area-under-the-curve receiver-operating-characteristic (AUC-ROC) curves were derived from the validation set. Results The AUC-ROC for the validation set delivering preterm was 0.80 (95% CI: 0.69 to 0.88; p = 0.0001), sensitivity 0.89, specificity of 0.71 and a mean gestational age of 10.0 ±1.8 weeks (range: 6.6–12.9 weeks). When the validation population was divided by gestational age at the time of venipuncture into early first trimester (mean 8.4 ±1.0 weeks; range 6.6–9.7 weeks) and late first trimester (mean 11.5±0.8 weeks; range 10.0–12.9 weeks), the AUC-ROC scores for early and late first trimester were 0.79 (95% CI: 0.63 to 0.91) and 0.81 (95% CI: 0.66 to 0.92), respectively. Conclusion Quantification of first trimester peripheral blood MicroRNA identifies risk of spontaneous preterm birth in samples obtained early and late first trimester of pregnancy in an African American population."
https://openalex.org/W3049510199,"The aim of this study was to establish maturation-, age-, and sex-specific anthropometric and physical fitness percentile reference values of young elite athletes from various sports. Anthropometric (i.e., standing and sitting body height, body mass, body mass index) and physical fitness (i.e., countermovement jump, drop jump, change-of-direction speed [i.e., T-test], trunk muscle endurance [i.e., ventral Bourban test], dynamic lower limbs balance [i.e., Y-balance test], hand grip strength) of 703 male and female elite young athletes aged 8–18 years were collected to aggregate reference values according to maturation, age, and sex. Findings indicate that body height and mass were significantly higher (p<0.001; 0.95≤d≤1.74) in more compared to less mature young athletes as well as with increasing chronological age (p<0.05; 0.66≤d≤3.13). Furthermore, male young athletes were significantly taller and heavier compared to their female counterparts (p<0.001; 0.34≤d≤0.50). In terms of physical fitness, post-pubertal athletes showed better countermovement jump, drop jump, change-of-direction, and handgrip strength performances (p<0.001; 1.57≤d≤8.72) compared to pubertal athletes. Further, countermovement jump, drop jump, change-of-direction, and handgrip strength performances increased with increasing chronological age (p<0.05; 0.29≤d≤4.13). In addition, male athletes outperformed their female counterpart in the countermovement jump, drop jump, change-of-direction, and handgrip strength (p<0.05; 0.17≤d≤0.76). Significant age by sex interactions indicate that sex-specific differences were even more pronounced with increasing age. Conclusively, body height, body mass, and physical fitness increased with increasing maturational status and chronological age. Sex-specific differences appear to be larger as youth grow older. Practitioners can use the percentile values as approximate benchmarks for talent identification and development."
https://openalex.org/W3014391211,"Background Spinal anesthesia is a type of regional anesthesia that has been practicing for obstetric anesthesia since the beginning of the 20th century. Despite the simplicity and lower maternal mortality risk, compared to general anesthesia, spinal anesthesia is linked to different adverse effects, of which hypotension is the most common complication. The main aim of this study was to determine the incidence and associated factors of hypotension after spinal anesthesia during cesarean section. Method Institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted with 410 clients. The study was conducted on cesarean section under spinal anesthesia from 5th January to 30th April 2019, at the Gandhi Memorial Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Both bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis were done on the associated factors. The level of statistical significance was represented at p<0.05. Results The incidence of hypotension among mothers who underwent a cesarean section after spinal anesthesia was 64%. Newborn weight ≥4kg (AOR = 5.373; 95%CI: (1.627–17.740)) showed an increase risk of association with hypotension. A baseline systolic blood pressure < 120mmHg (AOR = 6.293; (95%CI: 2.999–13.204)) was found to be associated with increased risk of hypotension. Sensory block height >T6 AOR = 2.230; 95%CI: (1.329–3.741), the time interval between spinal induction and skin incision > 6minutes AOR = 1.803; 95%CI: (1.044–3.114) and anesthetist experience AOR = 5.033(95%CI: 2.144–11.818) were also associated with hypotension. Conclusion The identified risk factors for hypotension, after spinal anesthesia are sensory height block, weight of the baby, the time interval between spinal induction and skin incision, baseline systolic blood pressure, and anesthetist experience."
https://openalex.org/W3049107518,"Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are associated with morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although national systems for reporting ADRs exist there is a low reporting rate. The aim of the current study was to evaluate an intervention plan for improving ADRs reporting among medical professionals (physicians and nurses). A multicentre intervention study was conducted, in which one medical centre was randomly assigned to the intervention group and two medical centres to the control group. The study consisted of 3 phases: baseline data collection, intervention and follow-up of the reporting rate. The questionnaire that was filled in at base line and at the end of study, contained questions about personal/professional demographic variables, and statements regarding knowledge of and behaviour toward ADRs reporting. The intervention program consisted of posters, lectures, distant electronic learning and reminders. An increase in the number of ADRs reports was noted in the intervention group (74 times higher than in the control group) during the intervention period, which was gradually decreased with as the study progressed (adjusted O.R = 74.1, 95% CI = 21.11–260.1, p<0.001). The changes in the ""knowledge related to behaviour” (p = 0.01) and in the ""behaviour related to reporting"" (p<0.001) score was significantly higher in the intervention group. Specialist physicians and nurses (p<0.001), fulfilling additional positions (p<0.001) and those working in other places (p = 0.05) demonstrated a high rate of report. Lectures were preferable as a method to encourage ADRs reporting. The most convenient reporting tools were telephone and online reporting. Thus, implementation and maintenance of a continuous intervention program, by a pharmacovigilance specialist staff member, will improve ADRs reporting rates."
https://openalex.org/W3049213029,"Background The pathophysiology of arterial stiffness is not completely understood. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is an established marker for arterial stiffness. We compare genetics of three PWV modes, namely carotid-femoral PWV (cfPWV), brachial-ankle (baPWV) and brachial-femoral (bfPWV), reflecting different vascular segments to analyse association with genetic variants, heritability and genetic correlation with other biological traits. Furthermore we searched for shared genetic architecture concerning PWV, blood pressure (BP) and coronary artery disease (CAD) and examined the causal relationship between PWV and BP. Methods and results We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for cfPWV, baPWV and bfPWV in LIFE-Adult (N = 3,643–6,734). We analysed the overlap of detected genetic loci with those of BP and CAD and performed genetic correlation analyses. By bidirectional Mendelian Randomization, we assessed the causal relationships between PWV and BP. For cfPWV we identified a new locus with genome-wide significance near SLC4A7 on cytoband 3p24.1 (lead SNP rs939834: p = 2.05x10-8). We replicated a known PWV locus on cytoband 14q32.2 near RP11-61O1.1 (lead SNPs: rs17773233, p = 1.38x10-4; rs1381289, p = 1.91x10-4) For baPWV we estimated a heritability of 28% and significant genetic correlation with hypertension (rg = 0.27, p = 6.65x10-8). We showed a positive causal effect of systolic blood pressure on PWV modes (cfPWV: p = 1.51x10-4; bfPWV: p = 1.45x10-3; baPWV: p = 6.82x10-15). Conclusions We identified a new locus for arterial stiffness and successfully replicated an earlier proposed locus. PWV shares common genetic architecture with BP and CAD. BP causally affects PWV. Larger studies are required to further unravel the genetic determinants and effects of PWV."
https://openalex.org/W3049268496,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and it is one of the main causes of death for women worldwide. To attain an optimum medical treatment for breast cancer, an early breast cancer detection is crucial. This paper proposes a multi- stage feature selection method that extracts statistically significant features for breast cancer size detection using proposed data normalization techniques. Ultra-wideband (UWB) signals, controlled using microcontroller are transmitted via an antenna from one end of the breast phantom and are received on the other end. These ultra-wideband analogue signals are represented in both time and frequency domain. The preprocessed digital data is passed to the proposed multi- stage feature selection algorithm. This algorithm has four selection stages. It comprises of data normalization methods, feature extraction, data dimensional reduction and feature fusion. The output data is fused together to form the proposed datasets, namely, 8-HybridFeature, 9-HybridFeature and 10-HybridFeature datasets. The classification performance of these datasets is tested using the Support Vector Machine, Probabilistic Neural Network and Naïve Bayes classifiers for breast cancer size classification. The research findings indicate that the 8-HybridFeature dataset performs better in comparison to the other two datasets. For the 8-HybridFeature dataset, the Naïve Bayes classifier (91.98%) outperformed the Support Vector Machine (90.44%) and Probabilistic Neural Network (80.05%) classifiers in terms of classification accuracy.

https://openalex.org/W3049377042,"Background Low levels of physical activity (PA) and high levels of physical inactivity (PI) are associated with higher mortality and cardiovascular diseases. Higher age is associated with a decrease of PA, only 2.4–29% of ≥60 year-olds achieve the PA times recommended by WHO. The aim of this study was to identify levels of and determinants for moderate PA, overall PA and PI in a sample of individuals aged ≥65 years. Methods We analyzed baseline data from an intervention-study aiming to increase PA and decrease PI by automatically generated feedback letters to objectively measured PA and PI. Recruitment was multimodal including re-contacting participants of previous studies and advertisements in regional public buses and newspapers. At baseline, participants wore an accelerometer over a period of 7 consecutive days. PA was categorized using cut-points suggested by Freedsoon 1998 in light, moderate and vigorous physical intensity as well as physical inactivity. Potential determinants (self-efficacy, education) were measured by questionnaires or in a physical examination (BMI). Multiple linear regression models were fitted to identify determinants for PA and PI. Results N = 199 persons (mean age 71.0 years (SD 4.9), 59.3% female) participated in the study. The weekly amount of overall PA for men was on average 1,821 minutes (SD 479.1), for women on average 1,929 minutes (SD 448.8). 79.7% of the women and 72.8% of the men achieved the WHO recommendation of 30 minutes moderate PA/day at baseline. The time of PI during the observation time period of 7 days was on average 4,057 minutes in men and 3,973 minutes in women. In males, age was found to be a significant negative determinant for overall PA (p = 0.002) and for moderate PA (p<0.001). Higher education was positively associated with higher levels of overall PA (p = 0.013) and moderate PA (p = 0.06) in men. BMI was a significant negative determinant for overall PA both in men (p = 0.039) and women (p = 0.032) as well as for moderate PA for women (p = 0.009). Only in women, not in men, self-efficacy was to be a significant positive determinant for overall PA (p = 0.020) as well as negatively associated with PI (p = 0.006). Discussion The participants of our study showed high levels of PA. This is likely due to selection bias in this convenience sample. However, also levels of PI are very high and those correspond with average levels in the German population. The determinants for higher PA and lower PI differed between males and females. Thus, strategies for improving PA and decrease PI are likely different with respect to sex and should take individual factors (e.g. age, BMI) into account.

https://openalex.org/W3048987292,"A relationship between chronic pain and frailty has been reported. The early detection and prevention of frailty are recommended, in part because community-dwelling older adults in a pre-frailty state may return to a healthy state. The relationship between chronic pain and pre-frailty is not known. Toward the goal of promoting a reversible return to health from pre-frailty, we investigated the relationship between chronic pain and pre-frailty among community-dwelling older adults. We assessed the frailty and chronic pain of 107 older adults who were participating in community health checks. The status of physical frailty was based on the five components described by Fried (2001): muscle weakness shown by handgrip strength, slowness of gait speed, weight loss, low physical activity, and exhaustion. Chronic pain was assessed based on pain intensity, the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), the Japanese version of the Geriatric Depression Scale-15 (GDS-15), and the Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI). The prevalence of chronic pain with pre-frailty was 40.2%. A hierarchical analysis revealed that PCS-measured helplessness (odds ratio [OR]: 0.88) and the CSI (OR: 0.87) were significant factors associated with the presence of chronic pain with pre-frailty. The prevalence of chronic pain with pre-frailty was high, and chronic pain and pre-frailty were strongly related. New intervention or prevention programs that take into account both chronic pain and pre-frailty must be created as soon as possible."
https://openalex.org/W3049759332,"Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a progressive pathological condition associated with proliferation of prostatic tissues, prostate enlargement, and lower-urinary tract symptoms. However, the mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of BPH is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of a combination of Stauntonia hexaphylla and Cornus officinalis (SC extract) on a testosterone propionate (TP)-induced BPH model. The effect of SC extract was examined in a TP-induced human prostate adenocarcinoma cell line. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 5 groups (n = 6) for in vivo experiments. To induce BPH, all rats, except those in the control group, were administered daily with subcutaneous injections of TP (5 mg/kg) and orally treated with appropriate phosphate buffered saline/drugs (finasteride/saw palmetto/SC extract) for 4 consecutive weeks. SC extract significantly downregulated the androgen receptor (AR), prostate specific antigen (PSA), and 5α-reductase type 2 in TP-induced BPH in vitro. In in vivo experiments, SC extract significantly reduced prostate weight, size, serum testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels. Histologically, SC extract markedly recovered TP-induced abnormalities and reduced prostatic hyperplasia, thereby improving the histo-architecture of TP-induced BPH rats. SC extract also significantly downregulated AR and PSA expression, as assayed using immunoblotting. Immunostaining revealed that SC extract markedly reduced the 5α-reductase type 2 and significantly downregulated the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen. In addition, immunoblotting of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family proteins indicated that SC extract significantly downregulated anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and markedly upregulated pro-apoptotic B cell lymphoma-associated X (Bax) expression. Furthermore, SC treatment significantly decreased the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, indicating induced prostate cell apoptosis in TP-induced BPH rats. Thus, our findings demonstrated that SC extract protects against BPH by inhibiting 5α-reductase type 2 and inducing prostate cell apoptosis. Therefore, SC extract might be useful in the clinical treatment of BPH."
https://openalex.org/W3049368513,"Background Risk communication, situated in the model of shared decision making (SDM), is an essential element in daily clinical practice. The scientific literature makes a number of generic recommendations. Yet the application of risk communication remains a challenge in patient-clinician encounters. How clinicians actually communicate risk during consultations is not well understood. We aimed to explore the risk communication strategies used by clinicians and extract narratives and visualizations of those strategies to help inform medical education. Methods In this qualitative descriptive study, we interviewed fifteen purposely sampled clinicians from several medical disciplines, who were familiar with the concept of SDM. Deductive and inductive content analysis was used during an iterative data collection and analyses process. Results Our study identified various strategies reported to be used by clinicians to address the complexities of risk communication such as dealing with uncertainty. These included verbal, numerical and visual risk communication and framing. Clinicians were familiar with recommended risk formats such as natural frequencies and population pictograms. However, it became clear that clinicians’ expertise and communication goals also play an important role in the risk talk. Clinicians try to lay a foundation for balanced decision-making and to incorporate patient preferences while faced with several challenges such as the dilemma of raising awareness but triggering anxiety or fan fear in patients. Consequently, they also use communication goals such as influencing mindset and reassuring patients. Additionally, clinicians frequently have to account for the illusion of certainty in the risk talk. Conclusion Risk communication is a multi-faceted construct that cannot be dealt with in isolation from the clinical context. For future research we recommend considering a more practical framework within the clinical setting and to take a goal-directed approach into account when investigating and teaching the topic. The patient perspective should also be addressed in further research."
https://openalex.org/W3049046280,"Objective To clarify the relationship between amide proton transfer-weighted (APTW) signal, which reflects intracellular pH, and clinico-radiological findings in patients with hyperacute to subacute cerebral infarction. Materials and methods Twenty-nine patients (median age, 70 years [IQR, 54 to 74]; 15 men) were retrospectively examined. The 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles of APTW signal (APT10, APT25, APT50, APT75 and APT90, respectively) were measured within the infarction region-of-interest (ROI), and compared between poor prognosis and good prognosis groups (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score ≥2 and mRS score <2, respectively). Correlations between APTW signal and time after onset, lesion size, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, mRS score, and mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were evaluated. Results The poor prognosis group had lower APT50, APT75, and APT90 than the good prognosis group (–0.66 [–1.19 to –0.27] vs. –0.09 [–0.62 to –0.21]; –0.27 [–0.63 to –0.01] vs. 0.31 [–0.15 to 1.06]; 0.06 [–0.21 to 0.34] vs. 0.93 [0.36 to 1.50] %; p <0.05, respectively). APT50 was positively correlated with time after onset (r = 0.37, p = 0.0471) and negatively with lesion size (r = –0.39, p = 0.0388). APT75 and APT90 were negatively correlated with NIHSS (r = –0.41 and –0.43; p <0.05, respectively). APT50, APT75 and APT90 were negatively correlated with mRS (r = –0.37, –0.52 and –0.57; p <0.05, respectively). APT10 and APT25 were positively correlated with mean ADC (r = 0.37 and 0.38; p <0.05, respectively). Conclusion We demonstrated correlations between APTW signals of infarctions and clinico-radiological findings in patients with hyperacute to subacute infarctions. The poor prognosis group had a lower APTW signal than the good prognosis group. APTW signal was reduced in large infarctions, infarctions with low ADC, and in patients with high NIHSS and mRS scores."
https://openalex.org/W3049700077,"Tomato is the most widespread vegetable crop in the world. In Italy, tomatoes are mainly cultivated in the South and in the Campania region, precisely in the area called Agro Nocerino-Sarnese. This flatland is affected by an extreme level of environmental degradation, especially related to the Sarno River, where concentrations of Potential Toxic Elements (PTEs) have been found to be higher than the maximum permitted level. The aim of this study was to determine the PTEs uptake by roots and their translocation to the aerial parts of the plants of two cultivars of tomatoes (Pomodoro Giallo and San Marzano Cirio 3). To the purpose, samples of the two cultivars were grown both in pots with experimentally contaminated soil containing: Cr or Cd or Pb at extremely high concentrations and in pots with uncontaminated soils (control). Additionally, the antioxidant properties of the cultivars selected grown on uncontaminated/contaminated soils were assessed. The results showed that Cd was the contaminant that most significantly interfered with the growth of both cultivars of tomato plants, whereas Pb caused lower phenotypical damage. Cd translocation from root to the organs of tomato plants was observed in both cultivars. Specifically, the total amount of Cd found in stems and leaves was higher in the Pomodoro Giallo (254.4 mg/kg dry weight) than in the San Marzano Cirio 3 (165.8 mg/kg dry weight). Cd was the only PTE found in the fruits of both cultivars, with values of 6.1 and 3.9 mg/kg dry weight of Pomodoro Giallo and San Marzano Cirio 3, respectively. The fruits of tomato plants grown in PTEs-contaminated soil showed inhibition or stimulations of the radical scavenging activity compared to the fruits grown in uncontaminated soil. This study highlighted that, despite the relatively high experimental concentrations of PTEs, their translocation to the edible part was comparatively low or absent."
https://openalex.org/W3048997100,"As carbon dioxide (CO2) levels increase, coral reefs and other marine systems will be affected by the joint stressors of ocean acidification (OA) and warming. The effects of these two stressors on coral physiology are relatively well studied, but their impact on biotic interactions between corals are poorly understood. While coral-coral interactions are less common on modern reefs, it is important to document the nature of these interactions to better inform restoration strategies in the face of climate change. Using a mesocosm study, we evaluated whether the combined effects of ocean acidification and warming alter the competitive interactions between the common coral Porites astreoides and two other mounding corals (Montastraea cavernosa or Orbicella faveolata) common in the Caribbean. After 7 days of direct contact, P. astreoides suppressed the photosynthetic potential of M. cavernosa by 100% in areas of contact under both present (~28.5°C and ~400 μatm pCO2) and predicted future (~30.0°C and ~1000 μatm pCO2) conditions. In contrast, under present conditions M. cavernosa reduced the photosynthetic potential of P. astreoides by only 38% in areas of contact, while under future conditions reduction was 100%. A similar pattern occurred between P. astreoides and O. faveolata at day 7 post contact, but by day 14, each coral had reduced the photosynthetic potential of the other by 100% at the point of contact, and O. faveolata was generating larger lesions on P. astreoides than the reverse. In the absence of competition, OA and warming did not affect the photosynthetic potential of any coral. These results suggest that OA and warming can alter the severity of initial coral-coral interactions, with potential cascading effects due to corals serving as foundation species on coral reefs."
https://openalex.org/W3049410966,"The similarities, differences, and contradictions regarding climate change adaptation and resilience by academics and practitioners have already been documented. It is the need of time to set new precedence by observing the adaptations and resilience as tools to respond to the climate variations. This study analyzed the influence of climate change adaptations and synergy between resilience from livelihood vulnerability and adaptations. A field survey of 489 farming households is conducted with the help of a well-structured questionnaire from four districts of the south part of Punjab province of Pakistan. This study uses the Endogenous Switching Regression model for the sake of analysis. The outcomes of the study reveal that age, education, family size, total land, and seed price have significant linkage with the adoption of adaptations. The synergistic effects of adaptation and resilience are also visible here as the adaptations factors are significantly contributing towards yield, per capita income, poverty, and poverty gap of the respondents. This study suggests the provision of proper education and smart technology to help in enhancing the adaptive capacity of farmers. More imperatively, adaptations to climate variations can be concluded as a remedial tool for resilient livelihood. It is believed that the present study can be considered as a guide for future research on other regions of Pakistan and neighboring countries."
https://openalex.org/W3049450021,"Serine/threonine phosphatases are responsible for modulating the activities of the protein kinases implicated in the development of several pathologies. Here we identified by a PEP-scan approach a peptide of LRRK2, a Parkinson's disease associated protein, interacting with the phosphatase PP1. In order to study its biological activity, the peptide was fused via its N-terminal to an optimized cell penetrating peptide. We synthesized from the original peptide five interfering peptides and identified two (Mut3DPT-LRRK2-Short and Mut3DPT-LRRK2-Long) able to disrupt the LRRK2/PP1 interaction by competition in anti-LRRK2 immunoprecipitates. Using FITC-labelled peptides, we confirmed their internalization into cell lines as well as into primary cells obtained from healthy or ill human donors. We confirmed by ELISA test the association of Mut3DPT-LRRK2-Long peptide to purified PP1 protein. The peptides Mut3DPT-LRRK2-5 to 8 with either N or C-terminal deletions were not able to disrupt the association LRRK2/PP1 nor to associate with purified PP1 protein. The interfering sequences blocking the PP1/LRRK2 interaction were also fused to a shuttle peptide able to cross the blood brain barrier and showed that the newly generated peptides BBB-LRRK2-Short and BBB-LRRK2-Long were highly resistant to protease degradation. Furthermore, they blocked PP1/LRRK2 interaction and they penetrated into cells. Hence, these newly generated peptides can be employed as new tools in the investigation of the role of the LRRK2/PP1 interaction in normal and pathological conditions."

This study aimed to determine and compare circulating ADTRP levels between CAD patients and controls, and to test the performance of plasma ADTRP as a biomarker for CAD. We measured plasma ADTRP, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and high sensitivity-C reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels in 362 CAD patients, 150 angiographically negative CAD controls, and 83 healthy adults with no known clinical or medical conditions using commercial ELISA. Statistical analyses were performed using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves, quantile regression and logistic regression, with adjustments for age, gender, ethnicity and BMI. CAD patients had significantly lower plasma ADTRP levels 1,545 (1,087–2,408) pg/ml as compared to CAD controls 2,259 (1,533–3,778) pg/ml and healthy adults 3,904 (2,732–5,463) pg/ml. Plasma ADTRP outperformed the other three inflammatory biomarkers (TNF-α, IL-6 and hs-CRP) for CAD (Area under ROC curve: 0.67, Odds ratio (OR): 0.907). Our study has shown for the first time that ADTRP is present in circulation, and that plasma ADTRP may be a novel independent biomarker for CAD."

https://openalex.org/W3049486296,"The behavioral activation system (BAS) and the behavioral inhibition system (BIS) have been proposed to relate to stable traits that predict inter-individual differences in motivation. Prior reports point dopamine (DA) pathways, mainly including ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SN), implicate in subserving reward-related functions associated with BAS and inhibitory functions related with BIS. However, as an important factor that affects DA releasing, it remains an open question whether the ovarian hormones may also be related to BIS/BAS. Here, to investigate effects of the estradiol (E2) and progesterone (PROG) on BIS/BAS and related DA pathways, we employed a BIS/BAS scale and the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during the late follicular phase (FP) and the mid-luteal phase (LP). On the behavioral level, when women had high PROG levels, their E2 levels were found positively correlated with BIS scores, but those women whose PROG levels were low, their E2 levels were negative correlation with BIS scores. On the neural level, we demonstrated BAS was related with the VTA pathway, included brain reward regions of nucleus accumbens (NAc) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Meanwhile, the BIS was correlated with the SN-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) pathway. ROI-based resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) analyses further revealed that, RSFC between the SN and dlPFC was modulated by ovarian hormones. With higher PROG levels, increased E2 levels among women were accompanied by stronger RSFC of the SN-dlPFC, but when PROG levels were low, E2 levels were negatively correlated with the SN-dlPFC RSFC. These findings revealed a combined enhancement effect of E2 and PROG on BIS, and the SN-dlPFC pathway was mainly involved in this process."
https://openalex.org/W3049708307,"Although scientists agree that replications are critical to the debate on the validity of religious priming research, religious priming replications are scarce. This paper attempts to replicate and extend previously observed effects of religious priming on ethical behavior. We test the effect of religious instrumental music on individuals’ ethical behavior with university participants (N = 408) in the Czech Republic, Japan, and the US. Participants were randomly assigned to listen to one of three musical tracks (religious, secular, or white noise) or to no music (control) for the duration of a decision-making game. Participants were asked to indicate which side of a vertically-bisected computer screen contained more dots and, in every trial, indicating that the right side of the screen had more dots earned participants the most money (irrespective of the number of dots). Therefore, participants were able to report dishonestly to earn more money. In agreement with previous research, we did not observe any main effects of condition. However, we were unable to replicate a moderating effect of self-reported religiosity on the effects of religious music on ethical behavior. Nevertheless, further analyses revealed moderating effects for ritual participation and declared religious affiliation congruent with the musical prime. That is, participants affiliated with a religious organization and taking part in rituals cheated significantly less than their peers when listening to religious music. We also observed significant differences in cheating behavior across samples. On average, US participants cheated the most and Czech participants cheated the least. We conclude that normative conduct is, in part, learned through active membership in religious communities and our findings provide further support for religious music as a subtle, moral cue."

The two major chemokine subfamilies, CC and CXC, bind distinct receptor subsets. A sequence motif defining these families, the X position in the CXC motif, is not predicted to make significant contacts with the receptor, but instead links structural elements associated with binding and activation. Here, we use comparative analysis of chemokine NMR structures, structural modeling, and molecular dynamic simulations that suggested the X position reorients the chemokine N terminus. Using CXCL12 as a model CXC chemokine, deletion of the X residue (Pro-10) had little to no impact on the folded chemokine structure but diminished CXCR4 agonist activity as measured by ERK phosphorylation, chemotaxis, and Gi/o-mediated cAMP inhibition. Functional impairment was attributed to over 100-fold loss of CXCR4 binding affinity. Binding to the other CXCL12 receptor, ACKR3, was diminished nearly 500-fold. Deletion of Pro-10 had little effect on CXCL12 binding to the CXCR4 N terminus, a major component of the chemokine-GPCR interface. Replacement of the X residue with the most frequent amino acid at this position (P10Q) had an intermediate effect between WT and P10del in each assay, with ACKR3 having a higher tolerance for this mutation. This work shows that the X residue helps to position the CXCL12 N terminus for optimal docking into the orthosteric pocket of CXCR4 and suggests that the CC/CXC motif contributes directly to receptor selectivity by orienting the chemokine N terminus in a subfamily-specific direction.

An improved description of the chemokine interaction network is as selectively promiscuous, neither fully specific nor fully promiscuous, where overlapping high affinity chemokine-receptor pairs exist as a subset of all possible combinations (e.g. CCR3 binds many but not all chemokines, and these ligands bind several but not all receptors).

These structural studies have revealed a common tertiary fold for chemokines and validated that CKRs adopt the GPCR seven-transmembrane architecture. The highly conserved structures of chemokines and CKRs yield a conserved interface, with the chemokine N terminus binding the orthosteric pocket of the receptor. This binding pose was predicted by an initial model of the interaction that separates the chemokine interface into two distinct sites (12Rajagopalan L. Rajarathnam K.

In this two-site model, the CKR N terminus binds the globular chemokine core but does not lead to receptor activation (site-1). Activation is achieved through interactions between the chemokine N terminus and the receptor extracellular loop and transmembrane residues (site-2).

Disulfide bridges in interleukin-8 probed using non-natural disulfide analogues: dissociation of roles in structure from function.Biochemistry. 1999; 38 (10387004): 7653-765810.1021/bi990033vCrossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The first two cysteine residues separate the N terminus from the N-loop and classify chemokines into two major families where the cysteines are adjacent (CC-family) or separated by a single residue (CXC-family) (18Graves D.T. Jiang Y. Chemokines, a family of chemotactic cytokines.Crit. Rev. Oral. Biol. Med. 1995; 6 (7548618): 109-11810.1177/10454411950060020101Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). CKRs lack a CC/CXC motif and thus adopt the family of its chemokine ligand. In a truly promiscuous system, this nomenclature would break down. However, receptors rarely bind chemokines from multiple families. Thus, CXC receptors are activated by CXC chemokines, and CC receptors are activated by CC chemokines. There has been little evidence to support a family-wide explanation for this familial selectivity. As the deterministic residue for family classification is the X residue in the CXC motif, this X-factor likely plays a functional role in chemokine discrimination. Remarkably, many chemokine genes segregate into two major clusters corresponding to their family (19Zlotnik A. Yoshie O. Chemokines: a new classification system and their role in immunity.Immunity. 2000; 12 (10714678): 121-12710.1016/S1074-7613(00)80165-XAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3280) Google Scholar). In humans, chromosome 4 houses a majority of CXC chemokines, and chromosome 17 contains most CC chemokines. This implies that selectivity has been maintained through the successive gene duplications that rapidly expanded the chemokine family and that this selectivity may be as old as the molecules themselves. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that CXCL12 was a founding member of the CXC family. Duplication of a primordial chemokine gene followed by a permissive mutation that removed the X residue yielded the CC family progenitor (20Nomiyama H. Osada N. Yoshie O. The evolution of mammalian chemokine genes.Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2010; 21 (20434943): 253-26210.1016/j.cytogfr.2010.03.004Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 21DeVries M.E. Kelvin A.A.

Subsequent duplication events and transmutation occurred throughout chemokine evolution, thus driving recognition complexity and allowing the expansion of the chemokine system to orchestrate the inducible migration and constitutive homing of many cell types. The CC/CXC motif is not contained in the binding (site-1) or activation (site-2) regions of the chemokine; however, it is poised directly between these regions, allowing for structural modulation that could alter receptor binding or activation. In co-crystal structures of chemokine-bound GPCRs, the CC motif is above the pocket near the top of TM1 and the receptor N terminus. In the absence of a structure of a CXC chemokine bound to its receptor, it is unknown how the X residue interacts with the GPCR. Thus, the chemokine X-factor could determine selectivity between CC and CXC chemokines, and this effect could be achieved through structural perturbation of the chemokine N-loop (site-1), the N terminus (site-2), or a more subtle allosteric effect. To shed light on selectivity determinants between CC and CXC chemokines, we interrogated the structural impact and functional consequences of mutation and deletion of the X residue in the prototypical homeostatic chemokine CXCL12. Using NMR, cell-based functional assays, and radioligand binding, we observed structural perturbation as well as reduced receptor binding and activation upon mutation or deletion of the X residue. Interactions with the CKR N terminus (site-1) were largely unchanged, localizing the binding defect to the chemokine interface with the CKR extracellular loops or transmembrane regions (site-2). Analysis of every chemokine with an NMR solution-state structure suggested preferred N-terminal states between CC and CXC chemokines. Homology modeling and subsequent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of CXCL12-P10del support the hypothesis that the CC/CXC motif directly impacts chemokine N-terminal orientation important for receptor recognition. Analysis of the chemokine interaction network revealed that each chemokine subfamily activates a distinct subset of receptors (Fig. 1A). In other words, aside from the atypical (e.g. ACKR1) or viral (e.g. US28) receptors, chemokine receptors exhibit subfamily (e.g. CC versus CXC) selectivity. The presence or absence of the X position is the only absolutely conserved sequence difference that distinguishes CC and CXC chemokines. Although there is no consensus X residue among the 17 CXC chemokines (Fig. 1B), this amino acid may contribute to receptor preference within the CXC family. Of the 11 different amino acids found at the X position, polar and aliphatic side chains are found in the ligands for the more promiscuous CXCR1, CXCR2, and CXCR3 receptors, whereas charged (Arg and Glu), aromatic (Tyr), or constrained (Pro) amino acids correspond to selective or monogamous chemokine-receptor interactions. We hypothesized that deletion of the intervening X residue would alter chemokine structure in a way that significantly impairs recognition by CXC family receptors, opening the door to interactions with other GPCRs. To investigate the structural role of the X position, we tabulated all contacts between that side chain and other amino acids in the NMR structures of 11 different CXC chemokines (Fig. 1C). Most X interactions involved residues in the β1- or β2-strands, with fewer contacts with the end of the 30s loop or the beginning of the β3-strand. Although there were contacts with the N terminus, this region is unstructured and flexible in solution, and they likely represent transient interactions (23Baryshnikova O.K. Sykes B.D. Backbone dynamics of SDF-1α determined by NMR: interpretation in the presence of monomer-dimer equilibrium.Protein Sci. 2006; 15 (17075134): 2568-257810.1110/ps.062255806Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Inspection of the NMR structures of 16 different CC chemokines revealed that the β1-β2 hairpin is longer in CXC chemokines, with an average of two additional residues that participate in β-strand hydrogen bonding (Fig. 1D). This is most apparent in CXCL12, where the proline at the X position packs tightly with residues flanking the 30s loop (Leu-29, Thr-31, and Gln-37), resulting in both β1- and β2-strands extending an additional two residues into the 30s loop. In chemokines with bulkier X residues, such as glutamine in CXCL8, this region protrudes away from the N terminus into solution. In addition to secondary structure characteristics, several N-terminal preferences became apparent after alignment of CC and CXC chemokines by the conserved core. To quantify this, each conformer in the NMR structure was separated (520 total models), and an average vector was calculated for each N terminus (Fig. 1E). These vectors were averaged by family to calculate the difference in the mean orientations for CC and CXC ligands of 45°. This preference in solution is influenced by the CC/CXC motif that bridges the N terminus to the chemokine body. Upon overlaying the CXCR4 co-crystal structure (4RWS) with the aligned coordinate system, the mean axis for CXC chemokine N termini was oriented in an appropriate direction for receptor docking and activation (Fig. 1F). In contrast, the mean axis of the CC ligand family extended past TM1 in a direction incompatible with binding the orthosteric pocket. This analysis extended our hypothesis that deletion of the X residue would impair binding to CXC receptors by altering the preferred orientation of the receptor-activating N terminus. Although the CC/CXC motif is used to separate chemokines into easily classified families, it is not necessarily the sole factor contributing to familial differences. Chemokine N-terminal sequences were analyzed in an attempt to identify consistent differences in the activation domain of CC and CXC chemokines (Fig. 2A, left). Sequences are displayed in a structural format due to the high sequence variance with the conserved N-terminal cysteines aligned. This format best represents the N-terminal length and depth of contact in the orthosteric pocket. The ELR motif is found directly preceding the first cysteine in 7 of 17 CXC chemokines. This region has the highest conservation yet is found in less than half of the family. However, the arginine in this motif is the most conserved position, with a basic residue found in 13 of 17 CXC chemokines. Among the other four CXC chemokines, CXCL4 and CXCL14 have not been shown to bind or activate one of the CXC receptors, and CXCL17 is a newly discovered ligand with an unconventional sequence that may adopt a different structure. Only one of the 26 CC chemokines has a basic residue directly preceding the cysteine. The CC family N termini have low conservation and no apparent family-spanning trends. Familial selectivity could also be encoded at the level of binding rather than activation. CKR N-terminal sequences were analyzed to search for conserved binding epitopes between CC and CXC receptors (Fig. 2A, right). Like the chemokine, the unbound CKR N terminus is unstructured with high sequence variability and is displayed continuously with the conserved N-terminal cysteine aligned. The most conserved position directly precedes the aligned cysteine and is a proline in half of the receptors with no preference between families. The presence of the X position unequivocally divides CC and CXC chemokines, implying a direct functional role. In the absence of compelling sequence differences in binding or activation domains, the CC/CXC motif that bridges these two sites was the most likely factor to determine familial selectivity. To interrogate the role of the X residue in structure and function, a CC version of CXCL12 was engineered by deletion of the X residue (Fig. 2B, CXCL12-P10del). We selected CXCL12 for this study due to its high conservation across species and its specific binding to CXCR4 (one known chemokine ligand) and ACKR3 (two known chemokine ligands). As a candidate for the primordial chemokine, it is plausible that a CXC-to-CC transition occurred near the beginning of chemokine evolution (20Nomiyama H. Osada N. Yoshie O. The evolution of mammalian chemokine genes.Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2010; 21 (20434943): 253-26210.1016/j.cytogfr.2010.03.004Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 21DeVries M.E. Kelvin A.A.

Another construct was designed to probe the role of the X residue identity by mutating the X in CXCL12 to glutamine, the most common X residue (Fig. 2B, CXCL12-P10Q). To determine whether the X deletion of CXCL12 would be tolerated or if additional mutations would be needed to stabilize the CC disulfide arrangement, models of CXCL12-P10del were constructed and were similar to CXCL12-WT with a core Cα root mean square deviation of 0.6 Å (Fig. 2C). Deviations were noted at the 30s loop and N terminus, but the cysteines adopted normal disulfide stereochemistry, suggesting that tertiary structure would be maintained. This modeling did not sample alternative conformations. To assess the impact of the X-factor on conformational dynamics, five 100-ns MD simulations were performed with CXCL12-WT or CXCL12-P10del in explicit solvent. Over the course of each run, the N terminus fluctuated through many states; however, residues proximal to the CC/CXC motif, particularly Arg-8, consistently differed between CXCL12-WT and CXCL12-P10del. With the CXCR4 co-crystal structure overlaid, Arg-8 in CXCL12-WT was near its expected binding partner, CXCR4:Asp-262 (13Qin L. Kufareva I. Holden L.G. Wang C. Zheng Y. Zhao C. Fenalti G. Wu H.

Recent modeling and mutations support this contact as important for receptor activation (24Ziarek J.J. Kleist A.B. London N. Raveh B. Montpas N. Bonneterre J. St-Onge G. DiCosmo-Ponticello C.J.

In CXCL12-P10del, Arg-8 is facing the opposing side of the pocket and unlikely to establish this interaction. This reorientation of the proximal N terminus mimicked the differences between the mean N-terminal states found in NMR solution structures and may be a defining characteristic between CC and CXC chemokines. We expressed and purified [U-15N]CXCL12-WT, -P10Q, and -P10del proteins for experimental comparisons of folding, stability, and receptor binding. Protein identity and folding were confirmed by MS and reverse-phase HPLC. NMR heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra verified that each protein formed a stable, folded tertiary structure similar to CXCL12-WT (Fig. 2E). Larger peak shifts in the CXCL12-P10del spectrum relative to CXCL12-P10Q and variable peak intensities suggest that the deletion of the X residue caused greater structural perturbation and altered the internal dynamics of the protein. This increase in dynamics did not destabilize the protein as assessed by thermal denaturation, with Tm > 85 °C for each of the three constructs (Fig. 2F). We attempted to acquire three-dimensional NMR data to determine the structure of CXCL12-P10del but were prevented by extensive line broadening that reduced the quality of the spectra. To further examine the structural effects of X residue deletion suggested by NMR HSQC spectra and MD simulations, receptor binding was assessed by radioligand displacement of [125I]CXCL12 from CXCR4 (Fig. 3A and Table 1). After incubation with HEK-293T membranes overexpressing CXCR4, CXCL12-WT displaced the radioligand (Table 2) (Ki = 0.14 nm). CXCL12-P10del showed displacement, but with a 100-fold decrease in affinity (Ki = 14.8 nm). Intermediate between WT and X deletion, CXCL12-P10Q had a loss of affinity of ∼10-fold (Ki = 1.5 nm). Although these data suggested that X residue deletion disrupts chemokine-GPCR binding, it was unclear whether this disruption prevented chemokine contacts with the receptor N terminus (site-1) or the receptor body (site-2) and whether biological function was maintained.Table 1[125I]CXCL12 saturation binding parameter estimates[125I]CXCL12BmaxKd (pKd ± S.E.)fmol/mg proteinnmCXCR42240.05 (10.27 ± 0.17)ACKR32640.01 (10.95 ± 0.05) Open table in a new tab Table 2[125I]CXCL12 competition binding estimates[125I]CXCL12 KiCXCL12-WT, Ki (pKi ± S.E.)CXCL12-P10QCXCL12-P10delKi (pKi ± S.E.)ΔpKi (mutant − WT)Ki (pKi ± S.E.)ΔpKi (mutant − WT)nmnmnmCXCR40.14 (9.85 ± 0.28)1.51 (8.82 ± 0.16)−1.0314.8 (7.83 ± 0.36)−2.02ACKR30.09 (10.04 ± 0.37)0.69 (9.16 ± 0.14)−0.8842.7 (7.37 ± 0.48)−2.67 Open table in a new tab In preliminary studies on receptor activation, CXCL12-P10del failed to activate CXCR4 as assessed by ERK phosphorylation at 10 nm (Fig. 3C). Conversely, CXCL12-P10Q maintained robust ERK phosphorylation, demonstrating an X identity change being less impactful than familial exchange through X deletion. A result of balanced chemokine signaling is cell migration; thus, transwell chemotaxis assays were used to characterize the X mutants' ability to accomplish this main role. The biphasic response to increasing chemokine concentration was noted (Fig. 3D, left). Analyzing the increasing slope of this curve results in similar trends to ERK phosphorylation with CXCL12-P10Q having an intermediate impact compared with CXCL12-P10del (Fig. 3D, right). As signaling through endogenous receptors was consistently perturbed, direct Gi/o function was monitored via cAMP inhibition to gain detailed signaling insight (Table 3). Chemokine receptors are primarily coupled to Gαi/o proteins, which act directly to inhibit cAMP production. After stimulation of CXCR4-expressing HEK-293T cells with forskolin, CXCR4 exhibited robust cAMP inhibition (Fig. 3B) with CXCL12-WT, demonstrating nanomolar potency (EC50 = 0.26 nm, Emax = 100%). Compared with CXCL12-WT, CXCL12-P10del was the most deficient, with a 100-fold decrease in potency (EC50 = 25 nm, Emax = 103%), and again CXCL12-P10Q was intermediate, with a 20-fold decrease in potency (EC50 = 4.90 nm, Emax = 90%).Table 3Gi/o-mediated cAMP inhibition and β-arrestin-2 recruitmentFunctional activityCXCL12-WTCXCL12-P10QCXCL12-P10delEC50 (pEC50 ± S.E.)EmaxEC50 (pEC50 ± S.E.)EmaxEC50 (pEC50 ± S.E.)Emaxnm% CXCL12nm% CXCL12nm% CXCL12CXCR40.03 (9.59 ± 0.20)1004.90 (8.31 ± 0.18)90 ± 925.1 (7.60 ± 0.26)103 ± 16ACKR33.00 (8.52 ± 0.07)1005.40 (8.27 ± 0.04)89 ± 238.1 (7.42 ± 0.09)80 ± 5 Open table in a new tab As CXC receptors appeared to be sensitive to mutation or deletion of the X position, we sought to test binding and function at another family of chemokine receptors.

https://openalex.org/W3049257988,"The TCIRG1 gene encodes the a3 isoform of vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), which forms a proton transport channel in osteoclasts. Defects in this gene lead to functional impairment of osteoclasts and increased bone mass; however, the molecular mechanisms of TCIRG1 loss have not been fully elucidated. In the current study, we transfected mouse bone marrow-derived monocytes with control or Tcirg1-knockdown lentiviruses to further investigate the mechanisms of TCIRG1. Our results demonstrate that knockdown of Tcirg1 inhibits large-osteoclast (>100 μm) generation by decreasing the expression of nuclear factor of activated T-cells 1 (NFATc1) and inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor 2 (IP3R2). The decreased IP3R2 reduces intracellular calcium levels, which limits the nuclear translocation of NFATc1 in RANKL-induced mouse bone marrow-derived monocytes. These findings provide a mechanism to explain the effects of TCIRG1 impairment, with potential implications for the development of therapies for osteopetrosis."

Methods In a prospective cohort study in Bangwe primary care clinic, Blantyre, Malawi, all adults (18 years or older) presenting with an acute illness were screened for TB symptoms (cough, fever, night sweats, weight loss). Demographic characteristics were linked to exit interview by fingerprint bioidentification. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to estimate the proportion completing same-visit HIV testing, comparing between those with and without TB symptoms. Results There were 5427 adult attendees between 21/5/2018 and 6/9/2018. Exit interviews were performed for 2402 (44%). 276 patients were excluded from the analysis, being already on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Presentation with any TB symptom was common for men (54.6%) and women (57.4%). Overall 27.6% (585/ 2121) attenders reported being offered testing and 21.5% (455/2121) completed provider-initiated HIV testing and counselling (PITC) and received results. The proportions offered testing were similar among participants with and without TB symptoms (any TB symptom: 29.0% vs. 25.7%). This was consistent for each individual symptom; cough, weight loss, fever and night sweats. Multivariable regression models indicated men, younger adults and participants who had previously tested were more likely to complete PITC than women, older adults and those who had never previously tested. Conclusions Same-visit completion of HIV testing was suboptimal, especially among groups known to have high prevalence of undiagnosed HIV. As countries approach universal coverage of ART, identifying and prioritising currently underserved groups for HIV testing will be essential."

To investigate potential pathways to misdiagnosis, we interviewed 28 HIV testers in Zimbabwe and conducted weeklong observations at four testing facilities. Approaching adherence to national HIV testing algorithms as a social and scripted practice, dependent on the integration of certain competences, materials and meanings, our thematic analysis revealed three underlying causes of misdiagnosis: One, a lack of confidence in using certain test-kits, coupled with changes in testing algorithms and inadequate training, fed uncertainties with some testing practices. Two, difficult work conditions, including high workloads and resource-depleted facilities, compounded these uncertainties, and meant testers got distracted or resorted to testing short-cuts. Three, power struggles between HIV testers, and specific client-tester encounters created social interactions that challenged the testing process. We conclude that these contexts contribute to deviances from official and recommended testing procedures, as well as testing and interpretation biases, which may explain cases of misdiagnoses. We caution against user-error explanations to misdiagnosis in the absence of a broader recognition of how broader structural determinants affect HIV testing practices."

Periparturient ewes represent the major source of gastro-intestinal parasites for growing lambs and are therefore a priority for parasite control. This study examines the impact on ewe faecal egg counts (FECs), lamb FECs, lamb daily live weight gains (DLWGs) and pasture larval counts of treating groups of ewes two weeks prior to lambing with either, a long-acting moxidectin treatment, short-acting doramectin or control. Six groups of twenty ewes were allocated to individual paddocks, two groups allocated to each treatment, and weekly faecal sampling was performed throughout from the ewes and from six weeks after the start of lambing in the lambs. Treatment group was found to have a significant effect on both ewe FEC (p<0.001) and lamb FEC (p = 0.001) with the group receiving the long-acting anthelmintic having the lowest ewe and lamb FECs. There was no significant effect on the DLWGs of the lambs. Pasture larval counts at the end of the study period were lowest in the long-acting wormer treatment group. The use of long-acting moxidectin may be helpful as part of a parasite control programme by reducing the worm burdens of ewes and their lambs, decreasing the number of anthelmintic treatments required in that year and by reducing pasture contamination for those sheep which will graze the pasture in the next year. However, like all anthelmintics, its use should be judicious to avoid selection for resistance."

https://openalex.org/W3049328191,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent type of RNA modification. METTL3 in the methyltransferase complex is the core enzyme responsible for methylation. METTL3 selectively catalyzes the adenosines centered in the RRAC motif. Functional studies established that m6A could enhance the translation efficiency (TE) of modified genes by recruiting reader protein YTHDF1 and other initiation factors. We downloaded the m6A peaks in HeLa cells from a previous study and defined the m6A modified genes and sites. Ancestral mutations in the genic region fixed in the HeLa cell samples were defined using their mRNA-Seq data and the alignment between human and mouse genomes. Furthermore, in the small interfering (si)-METTL3 sample, the calculated TE foldchange of all genes was compared to that in the negative control. The TE of m6A genes was globally down-regulated in si-METTL3 versus control compared to the non-m6A genes. In m6A modified genes, RRAC motif mutations were suppressed compared to mutations in non-motif regions or non-m6A genes. Among the m6A genes, a fraction RRAC motif mutations negatively correlated with the TE foldchange (si-METTL3 versus control). The TE of m6A modified genes was enhanced in HeLa cells. RRAC motif mutations could potentially prevent methylation of adenosines and consequently abolish the enhanced translation. Such mutations in the RRAC motif might be deleterious. Accordingly, we observed lower fractions of mutations in RRAC motifs than in other regions. This prevention of mutations in the RRAC motif could be a strategy adopted by cancer cells to maintain the elevated translation of particular genes."

The binding of αSyn fibrils originating from affected cells to the plasma membrane of naïve cells is key in their prion-like propagation propensity. To interfere with this process, we designed polypeptides derived from proteins we previously showed to interact with αSyn fibrils, namely the molecular chaperone Hsc70 and the sodium/potassium pump NaK-ATPase and assessed their capacity to bind αSyn fibrils and/or interfere with their take-up by cells of neuronal origin. We demonstrate here that polypeptides that coat αSyn fibrils surfaces in such a way that they are changed affect αSyn fibrils binding to the plasma membrane components and/or their take-up by cells. Altogether our observations suggest that the rationale design of αSyn fibrils polypeptide binders that interfere with their propagation between neuronal cells holds therapeutic potential."
https://openalex.org/W3049606891,"The IEEE 802.11ah standard relies on the conventional distributed coordination function (DCF) as a backoff selection method. The DCF is utilized in the contention-based period of the newly introduced medium access control (MAC) mechanism, namely restricted access window (RAW). Despite various advantages of RAW, DCF still utilizes the legacy binary exponential backoff (BEB) algorithm, which suffers from a crucial disadvantage of being prone to high probability of collisions with high number of contending stations. To mitigate this issue, this paper investigates the possibility of replacing the existing exponential sequence (i.e., as in BEB) with a better pseudorandom sequence of integers. In particular, a new backoff algorithm, namely Pseudorandom Sequence Contention Algorithm (PRSCA) is proposed to update the CW size and minimize the collision probability. In addition, the proposed PRSCA incorporates a different approach of CW freezing mechanism and backoff stage reset process. An analytical model is derived for the proposed PRSCA and presented through a discrete 2-D Markov chain model. Performance evaluation demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed PRSCA in reducing collision probability and improving saturation throughput, network throughput, and access delay performance."
https://openalex.org/W3049717819,"Programming is one of the most crucial abilities for students in science and technology courses. Few studies on programming ability have considered the effect of students' construal levels on their learning performance. Therefore, the effects of students' construal level were explored in this study to fill this research gap and open a new avenue for the improvements in programming ability. The research participants were 110 seventh- and eighth-grade students with basic programming abilities taking an Arduino course. Data were collected from online questionnaires and analyzed using two-way analysis of variance and structural equation modeling to investigate the relationships among construal levels, programming ability, and learning satisfaction. The results revealed that students' construal levels affect their learning satisfaction and programming ability. These findings indicate that teaching strategies could effectively improve the learning satisfaction and programming ability of junior high school students."

This aim of this study was to compare the differences between disease-associated healthcare expenditures estimated using these 2 methods. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, a matched comparison was first conducted by matching cases with controls using sex, age, and comorbidities to estimate disease-associated expenditures. The cases were then used in a fixed-effects analysis that compared expenditures before and after disease occurrence. The subjects were adults (≥20 years) with primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who underwent treatment (including surgical resection, locoregional therapy, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization, and transarterial embolization) at a Japanese hospital between April 2010 and March 2018. We calculated the total healthcare expenditures per patient per month according to treatment and disease phase (initial, continuing, and terminal). Results There were 14,923 cases in the initial/continuing phases and 15,968 cases in the terminal phase. In the initial/continuing phases, 3,552 patients underwent surgical resection only, with HCC-associated expenditures of $5,555 according to the matched comparison and $5,889 according to the fixed-effects analysis (proportional difference: 94.3%). The initial phase expenditures were approximately 9% higher in the fixed-effects analysis, whereas the continuing phase expenditures were approximately 7% higher in the matched comparison. The expenditures in the terminal phase were 93.1% higher in the fixed-effects analysis. Conclusions The 2 methods produced similar estimates of HCC-associated healthcare expenditures in the initial/continuing phases. However, terminal phase expenditures were substantially different between the methods."
https://openalex.org/W3049485049,"The life cycle of European eel (Anguilla anguilla), a catadromous species, is complex and enigmatic. In nature, during the silvering process prior to their long spawning migration, reproductive development is arrested, and they cease feeding. In studies of reproduction using hormonal induction, eels are equivalently not feed. Therefore, in female eels that undergo vitellogenesis, the liver plays different, essential roles being involved both in vitellogenins synthesis and in reallocating resources for the maintenance of vital functions, performing the transoceanic reproductive migration and completing reproductive development. The present work aimed at unravelling the major transcriptomic changes that occur in the liver during induced vitellogenesis in female eels. mRNA-Seq data from 16 animals (eight before induced vitellogenesis and eight after nine weeks of hormonal treatment) were generated and differential expression analysis was performed comparing the two groups. This analysis detected 1,328 upregulated and 1,490 downregulated transcripts. Overrepresentation analysis of the upregulated genes included biological processes related to biosynthesis, response to estrogens, mitochondrial activity and localization, while downregulated genes were enriched in processes related to morphogenesis and development of several organs and tissues, including liver and immune system. Among key genes, the upregulated ones included vitellogenin genes (VTG1 and VTG2) that are central in vitellogenesis, together with ESR1 and two novel genes not previously investigated in European eel (LMAN1 and NUPR1), which have been linked with reproduction in other species. Moreover, several upregulated genes, such as CYC1, ELOVL5, KARS and ACSS1, are involved in the management of the effect of fasting and NOTCH, VEGFA and NCOR are linked with development, autophagy and liver maintenance in other species. These results increase the understanding of the molecular changes that occur in the liver during vitellogenesis in this complex and distinctive fish species, bringing new insights on European eel reproduction and broodstock management."
