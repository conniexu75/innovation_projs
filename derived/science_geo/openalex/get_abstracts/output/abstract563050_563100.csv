However, because they migrate into the brain during development, the changes that they undergo, including those that affect gene expression, have been difficult to document. Matcovitch-Natan et al. transcriptionally profiled gene expression and analyzed epigenetic signatures of microglia at the single-cell level in the early postnatal life of mice. They identified three stages of microglia development, which are characterized by gene expression and linked with chromatin changes, occurring in sync with the developing brain. Furthermore, they showed that the proper development of microglia is affected by the microbiome. Science , this issue p. 789"
https://openalex.org/W2462805925,"The merger of two massive 30 Msun black holes has been detected in gravitational waves (1,GW150914). This discovery validates recent predictions (2-4) that massive binary black holes would constitute the first detection. However, previous calculations have not sampled the relevant binary black hole progenitors---massive, low-metallicity binary stars---with sufficient accuracy and input physics to enable robust predictions to better than several orders of magnitude (5-10). Here we report a suite of high-precision numerical simulations of binary black hole formation via the evolution of isolated binary stars, providing a framework to interpret GW150914 and predict the properties of subsequent binary black hole gravitational-wave events. Our models imply that these events form in an environment where the metallicity is less than 10 percent of solar; have initial masses of 40-100 Msun; and interact through mass transfer and a common envelope phase. Their progenitors likely form either at 2 Gyr, or somewhat less likely, at 11 Gyr after the Big Bang. Most binary black holes form without supernova explosions, and their spins are nearly unchanged since birth, but do not have to be parallel. The classical field formation of binary black holes proposed in this study, with low natal kicks and restricted common envelope evolution, produces 40 times more binary black holes than dynamical formation channels involving globular clusters (11) and is comparable to the rate from homogeneous evolution channels (12-15). Our calculations predict detections of about 1,000 black hole mergers per year with total mass of 20-80 Msun once second generation ground-based gravitational wave observatories reach full sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2394549188,"A digital quantum simulation of a lattice gauge theory is performed on a quantum computer that consists of a few trapped-ion qubits; the model simulated is the Schwinger mechanism, which describes the creation of electron–positron pairs from vacuum. Quantum simulations promise to provide solutions to problems where classical computational methods fail. An example of a challenging computational problem is the real-time dynamics in gauge theories — field theories paramount to modern particle physics. This paper presents a digital quantum simulation of a lattice gauge theory on a quantum computer consisting of a few qubits comprising trapped calcium controlled by electromagnetic fields. The specific model that the authors simulate is the Schwinger mechanism, which describes the creation of electron–positron pairs from vacuum. As an early example of a particle-physics theory simulated with an atomic physics experiment, this could potentially open the door to simulating more complicated and otherwise computationally intractable models. Gauge theories are fundamental to our understanding of interactions between the elementary constituents of matter as mediated by gauge bosons1,2. However, computing the real-time dynamics in gauge theories is a notorious challenge for classical computational methods. This has recently stimulated theoretical effort, using Feynman’s idea of a quantum simulator3,4, to devise schemes for simulating such theories on engineered quantum-mechanical devices, with the difficulty that gauge invariance and the associated local conservation laws (Gauss laws) need to be implemented5,6,7. Here we report the experimental demonstration of a digital quantum simulation of a lattice gauge theory, by realizing (1 + 1)-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (the Schwinger model8,9) on a few-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer. We are interested in the real-time evolution of the Schwinger mechanism10,11, describing the instability of the bare vacuum due to quantum fluctuations, which manifests itself in the spontaneous creation of electron–positron pairs. To make efficient use of our quantum resources, we map the original problem to a spin model by eliminating the gauge fields12 in favour of exotic long-range interactions, which can be directly and efficiently implemented on an ion trap architecture13. We explore the Schwinger mechanism of particle–antiparticle generation by monitoring the mass production and the vacuum persistence amplitude. Moreover, we track the real-time evolution of entanglement in the system, which illustrates how particle creation and entanglement generation are directly related. Our work represents a first step towards quantum simulation of high-energy theories using atomic physics experiments—the long-term intention is to extend this approach to real-time quantum simulations of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories."
https://openalex.org/W2471701648,"Over 50% of patients who survive neuroinvasive infection with West Nile virus (WNV) exhibit chronic cognitive sequelae. Although thousands of cases of WNV-mediated memory dysfunction accrue annually, the mechanisms responsible for these impairments are unknown. The classical complement cascade, a key component of innate immune pathogen defence, mediates synaptic pruning by microglia during early postnatal development. Here we show that viral infection of adult hippocampal neurons induces complement-mediated elimination of presynaptic terminals in a murine WNV neuroinvasive disease model. Inoculation of WNV-NS5-E218A, a WNV with a mutant NS5(E218A) protein leads to survival rates and cognitive dysfunction that mirror human WNV neuroinvasive disease. WNV-NS5-E218A-recovered mice (recovery defined as survival after acute infection) display impaired spatial learning and persistence of phagocytic microglia without loss of hippocampal neurons or volume. Hippocampi from WNV-NS5-E218A-recovered mice with poor spatial learning show increased expression of genes that drive synaptic remodelling by microglia via complement. C1QA was upregulated and localized to microglia, infected neurons and presynaptic terminals during WNV neuroinvasive disease. Murine and human WNV neuroinvasive disease post-mortem samples exhibit loss of hippocampal CA3 presynaptic terminals, and murine studies revealed microglial engulfment of presynaptic terminals during acute infection and after recovery. Mice with fewer microglia (Il34(-/-) mice with a deficiency in IL-34 production) or deficiency in complement C3 or C3a receptor were protected from WNV-induced synaptic terminal loss. Our study provides a new murine model of WNV-induced spatial memory impairment, and identifies a potential mechanism underlying neurocognitive impairment in patients recovering from WNV neuroinvasive disease."

Here we report the results of a phase IIa open label clinical trial evaluating 3BNC117,a broad and potent neutralizing antibody against the CD4 binding site of the HIV-1 Env protein, during analytical treatment interruption in 13 HIV-1-infected individuals. Participants with 3BNC117-sensitive virus outgrowth cultures were enrolled. Results show that two or four 30 mg kg(-1) 3BNC117 infusions,separated by 3 or 2 weeks, respectively, are generally well tolerated.Infusions are associated with a delay in viral rebound of 5-9 weeks after two infusions, and up to 19 weeks after four infusions, or an average of 6.7 and 9.9 weeks, respectively, compared with 2.6 weeks for historical controls (P < 0.00001). Rebound viruses arise predominantly from a single provirus. In most individuals,emerging viruses show increased resistance, indicating escape.However, 30% of participants remained suppressed until antibody concentrations waned below 20 μg ml(-1), and the viruses emerging in all but one of these individuals showed no apparent resistance to 3BCN117, suggesting failure to escape over a period of 9-19 weeks.We conclude that the administration of 3BNC117 exerts strong selective pressure on HIV-1 emerging from latent reservoirs during analytical treatment interruption in humans."

https://openalex.org/W2474854223,"Therapeutic targeting of KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma represents a major goal of clinical oncology. KRAS itself has proved difficult to inhibit, and the effectiveness of agents that target key KRAS effectors has been thwarted by activation of compensatory or parallel pathways that limit their efficacy as single agents. Here we take a systematic approach towards identifying combination targets for trametinib, a MEK inhibitor approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, which acts downstream of KRAS to suppress signalling through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. Informed by a short-hairpin RNA screen, we show that trametinib provokes a compensatory response involving the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) that leads to signalling rebound and adaptive drug resistance. As a consequence, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of FGFR1 in combination with trametinib enhances tumour cell death in vitro and in vivo. This compensatory response shows distinct specificities: it is dominated by FGFR1 in KRAS-mutant lung and pancreatic cancer cells, but is not activated or involves other mechanisms in KRAS wild-type lung and KRAS-mutant colon cancer cells. Importantly, KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells and patients’ tumours treated with trametinib show an increase in FRS2 phosphorylation, a biomarker of FGFR activation; this increase is abolished by FGFR1 inhibition and correlates with sensitivity to trametinib and FGFR inhibitor combinations. These results demonstrate that FGFR1 can mediate adaptive resistance to trametinib and validate a combinatorial approach for treating KRAS-mutant lung cancer. A systematic screen identifies FGFR1 signalling reactivation as an adaptive resistance mechanism after MEK inhibition specific for KRAS tumours, which can be targeted by combined inhibition with the clinically approved drugs trametinib and ponatinib. The authors explore potential vulnerabilities of KRAS-driven tumours that could increase the efficacy of MEK inhibition. A systematic screen identifies fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) signalling reactivation as an adaptive resistance mechanism after MEK inhibition specific for KRAS tumours, which can be targeted by combined inhibition with the clinically approved drugs trametinib and ponatinib."

Disrupting this core alters the sensitivity of Env to broadly neutralizing antibodies, suggesting the potential importance of this region to vaccine design. Science , this issue p. 172"
https://openalex.org/W2473363865,"We have a limited understanding of how cells mark and identify newly replicated genomic loci that have a sister chromatid; here, unmethylated K20 in the tail of new histone H4 is shown to serve as a signature of post-replicative chromatin, which is specifically recognized by the homologous recombination complex TONSL–MMS22L. We have a limited understanding of how cells mark and identify newly replicated genomic loci that have a sister chromatid. Here, Anja Groth and colleagues show that histone H4 tails unmethylated at lysine 20 (H4K20me0) serve as a signature of post-replicative chromatin and are specific to new histones incorporated during DNA replication. H4K20me0 is specifically recognized by a 'reader' domain of the TONSL–MMS22L homologous recombination complex, enabling differentiation of pre- and post-replicative chromatin, and allowing TONSL to function as a histone chaperone or guide repair of damaged replication forks. After DNA replication, chromosomal processes including DNA repair and transcription take place in the context of sister chromatids. While cell cycle regulation can guide these processes globally, mechanisms to distinguish pre- and post-replicative states locally remain unknown. Here we reveal that new histones incorporated during DNA replication provide a signature of post-replicative chromatin, read by the human TONSL–MMS22L1,2,3,4 homologous recombination complex. We identify the TONSL ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) as a reader of histone H4 tails unmethylated at K20 (H4K20me0), which are specific to new histones incorporated during DNA replication and mark post-replicative chromatin until the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Accordingly, TONSL–MMS22L binds new histones H3–H4 both before and after incorporation into nucleosomes, remaining on replicated chromatin until late G2/M. H4K20me0 recognition is required for TONSL–MMS22L binding to chromatin and accumulation at challenged replication forks and DNA lesions. Consequently, TONSL ARD mutants are toxic, compromising genome stability, cell viability and resistance to replication stress. Together, these data reveal a histone-reader-based mechanism for recognizing the post-replicative state, offering a new angle to understand DNA repair with the potential for targeted cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2469746193,"Most cancers arise from oncogenic changes in the genomes of somatic cells, and while the cells may migrate by metastasis, they remain within that single individual. Natural transmission of cancer cells from one individual to another has been observed in two distinct cases in mammals (Tasmanian devils and dogs), but these are generally considered to be rare exceptions in nature. The discovery of transmissible cancer in soft-shell clams (Mya arenaria) suggested that this phenomenon might be more widespread. Here we analyse disseminated neoplasia in mussels (Mytilus trossulus), cockles (Cerastoderma edule), and golden carpet shell clams (Polititapes aureus) and find that neoplasias in all three species are attributable to independent transmissible cancer lineages. In mussels and cockles, the cancer lineages are derived from their respective host species; however, unexpectedly, cancer cells in P. aureus are all derived from Venerupis corrugata, a different species living in the same geographical area. No cases of disseminated neoplasia have thus far been found in V. corrugata from the same region. These findings show that transmission of cancer cells in the marine environment is common in multiple species, that it has originated many times, and that while most transmissible cancers are found spreading within the species of origin, cross-species transmission of cancer cells can occur."

https://openalex.org/W2466194468,"In 1943, Luria and Delbrück used a phage-resistance assay to establish spontaneous mutation as a driving force of microbial diversity. Mutation rates are still studied using such assays, but these can only be used to examine the small minority of mutations conferring survival in a particular condition. Newer approaches, such as long-term evolution followed by whole-genome sequencing, may be skewed by mutational ‘hot’ or ‘cold’ spots. Both approaches are affected by numerous caveats. Here we devise a method, maximum-depth sequencing (MDS), to detect extremely rare variants in a population of cells through error-corrected, high-throughput sequencing. We directly measure locus-specific mutation rates in Escherichia coli and show that they vary across the genome by at least an order of magnitude. Our data suggest that certain types of nucleotide misincorporation occur 10(4)-fold more frequently than the basal rate of mutations, but are repaired in vivo. Our data also suggest specific mechanisms of antibiotic-induced mutagenesis, including downregulation of mismatch repair via oxidative stress, transcription–replication conflicts, and, in the case of fluoroquinolones, direct damage to DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2467260205,"An important focus for meaningful use criteria is to engage patients in their care by allowing them online access to their health information, including test results. There has been little evaluation of such initiatives. Using a mixed methods analysis of electronic health record data, surveys, and qualitative interviews, we examined the impact of allowing patients to view their test results via patient portal in one large health system. Quantitative data were collected for new users and all users of the patient portal. Qualitative interviews occurred with patients who had received an HbA1c or abnormal Pap result. Survey participants were active patient portal users. Our main measures were patient portal usage, factors associated with viewing test results and utilizing care, and patient and provider experiences with patient portal and direct release. Usage data show 80% of all patient portal users viewed test results during the year. Of survey respondents, 82.7% noted test results to be a very useful feature and 70% agreed that patient portal has made their provider more accessible to them. Interviewed patients reported feeling they should have direct access to test results and identified the ability to monitor results over time and prepare prior to communicating with a provider as benefits. In interviews, both patients and physicians reported instances of test results leading to unnecessary patient anxiety. Both groups noted the benefits of results released with provider interpretation. Quantitative data showed patient utilization to increase with viewing test results online, but this effect is mitigated when results are manually released by physicians. Our findings demonstrate that patient portal access to test results was highly valued by patients and appeared to increase patient engagement. However, it may lead to patient anxiety and increase rates of patient visits. We discuss how such unintended consequences can be addressed and larger implications for meaningful use criteria."
https://openalex.org/W2469427057,"Hypophosphatemia can lead to muscle weakness and respiratory and heart failure, but the mechanism is unknown. To address this question, we noninvasively assessed rates of muscle ATP synthesis in hypophosphatemic mice by using in vivo saturation transfer [31P]-magnetic resonance spectroscopy. By using this approach, we found that basal and insulin-stimulated rates of muscle ATP synthetic flux (VATP) and plasma inorganic phosphate (Pi) were reduced by 50% in mice with diet-induced hypophosphatemia as well as in sodium-dependent Pi transporter solute carrier family 34, member 1 (NaPi2a)-knockout (NaPi2a-/-) mice compared with their wild-type littermate controls. Rates of VATP normalized in both hypophosphatemic groups after restoring plasma Pi concentrations. Furthermore, VATP was directly related to cellular and mitochondrial Pi uptake in L6 and RC13 rodent myocytes and isolated muscle mitochondria. Similar findings were observed in a patient with chronic hypophosphatemia as a result of a mutation in SLC34A3 who had a 50% reduction in both serum Pi content and muscle VATP After oral Pi repletion and normalization of serum Pi levels, muscle VATP completely normalized in the patient. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that decreased muscle ATP synthesis, in part, may be caused by low blood Pi concentrations, which may explain some aspects of muscle weakness observed in patients with hypophosphatemia.-Pesta, D.

https://openalex.org/W2472234313,"Observations of reverberation arising from gravitationally redshifted iron Kα photons reflected off the inner accretion flow in a tidal disruption event demonstrate that X-rays originate from a region very close to the central black hole and not from a relativistic jet, as previously thought. The tidal disruption event Swift J1644+57, first detected on 28 March 2011, is thought to be a consequence of a star being consumed by a once-dormant black hole. Here Erin Kara et al. report observations of relativistic X-ray echoes, or reverberation, arising from gravitationally redshifted iron Kα photons reflected off the inner accretion flow in Swift J1644+57. The authors estimate the mass of the black hole to be a few million solar masses, suggesting an accretion rate of at least 100 times the Eddington limit. These observations do not support the previous interpretation that the X-rays arise from the relativistically moving regions of a jet. Our current understanding of the curved space-time around supermassive black holes is based on actively accreting black holes, which make up only ten per cent or less of the overall population. X-ray observations of that small fraction reveal strong gravitational redshifts that indicate that many of these black holes are rapidly rotating1; however, selection biases suggest that these results are not necessarily reflective of the majority of black holes in the Universe2. Tidal disruption events, where a star orbiting an otherwise dormant black hole gets tidally shredded and accreted onto the black hole3, can provide a short, unbiased glimpse at the space-time around the other ninety per cent of black holes. Observations of tidal disruptions have hitherto revealed the formation of an accretion disk and the onset of an accretion-powered jet4,5,6,7,8, but have failed to reveal emission from the inner accretion flow, which enables the measurement of black hole spin. Here we report observations of reverberation9,10,11,12 arising from gravitationally redshifted iron Kα photons reflected off the inner accretion flow in the tidal disruption event Swift J1644+57. From the reverberation timescale, we estimate the mass of the black hole to be a few million solar masses, suggesting an accretion rate of 100 times the Eddington limit or more13.

https://openalex.org/W2468706945,"Mast cells (MCs) are a versatile cell type playing key roles in tissue morphogenesis and host defence against bacteria and parasites. Furthermore, they can enhance immunological danger signals and are implicated in inflammatory disorders like fibrosis. This granulated cell type originates from the myeloid lineage and has similarities to basophilic granulocytes, both containing large quantities of histamine and heparin. Immature murine mast cells mature in their destination tissue and adopt either the connective tissue (CTMC) or mucosal (MMC) type. Some effector functions are executed by activation/degranulation of MCs which lead to secretion of a typical set of MC proteases (MCPT) and of the preformed or newly synthesized mediators from its granules into the local microenvironment. Due to the potential accumulation of mutations in key signalling pathway components of corresponding MC cell-lines, primary cultured MCs are an attractive mean to study general features of MC biology and aspects of MC functions relevant to human disease. Here, we describe a simple protocol for the simultaneous isolation of mature CTMC-like murine MCs from the peritoneum (PMCs) and immature MC precursors from the bone marrow (BM). The latter are differentiated in vitro to yield BM-derived MCs (BMMC). These cells display the typical morphological and phenotypic features of MCs, express the typical MC surface markers, and can be propagated and kept in culture for several weeks.

In this study, the potential function of ROS during hematopoiesis in the crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus was examined. The antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was used to decrease ROS in both in vivo and in vitro experiments. An increase in ROS was observed in the anterior proliferation center (APC) after LPS injection. In the absence of NAC, the LPS-induced increase in ROS levels resulted in the rapid restoration of the circulating hemocyte number. In the presence of NAC, a delay in the recovery rate of the hemocyte number was observed. NAC treatment also blocked the spread of APC and other hematopoietic tissue (HPT) cells, maintaining these cells at an undifferentiated stage. Extracellular transglutaminase (TGase) has been shown previously to play a role in maintaining HPT cells in an undifferentiated form. In this study, we show that extracellular TGase activity increased when the ROS level in HPT or APC cells was reduced after NAC treatment. In addition, collagen, a major component of the extracellular matrix and a TGase substrate were co-localized on the HPT cell surface. Taken together, the results of this study show that ROS are involved in crayfish hematopoiesis, in which a low ROS level is required to maintain hematopoietic progenitor cells in the tissue and to reduce hemocyte release. The potential roles of TGase in this process are investigated and discussed."

For instance, previous reports demonstrate that the p85 regulatory subunit can be polyubiquitinated and negatively regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl-b in T cells without affecting its protein level (10Fang D. Wang H.Y. Fang N. Altman Y. Elly C. Liu Y.C. Cbl-b, a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, targets phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase for ubiquitination in T cells.J. Biol.

In addition, recent work shows that dephosphorylation of the p110-free p85β regulatory subunit leads to its degradation through F-box protein FBXL2 (12Kuchay S. Duan S. Schenkein E. Peschiaroli A. Saraf A. Florens L. Washburn M.P. Pagano M. FBXL2- and PTPL1-mediated degradation of p110-free p85beta regulatory subunit controls the PI(3)K signalling cascade.Nat. Cell Biol. 2013; 15: 472-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Importantly, the catalytic subunit PIK3CA may also be subject to a similar regulation: that is, a dynamic cycle of proteasome-dependent degradation and resynthesis of PIK3CA was observed in response to the stimulation of epidermal growth factor (13Yuan T.L. Wulf G. Burga L. Cantley L.C. Cell-to-cell variability in PI3K protein level regulates PI3K-AKT pathway activity in cell populations.Curr. Biol. 2011; 21: 173-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To further understand the regulation of PIK3CA, we developed an in vitro ubiquitination assay for PIK3CA. Using this assay and biochemical fractionation, we identified NEDD4L (neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated 4-like), 3The abbreviations used are: NEDD4Lneural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated 4-likeMEFmouse embryonic fibroblastDoxdoxycyclineCVcolumn volumeP1progeny 1Bis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. the E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for PIK3CA polyubiquitination. NEDD4L polyubiquitinates PIK3CA to promote its proteasomal degradation at both its regulatory subunit free and bound states. Knockdown of NEDD4L increases the protein level of PIK3CA but, paradoxically, impairs the activation of AKT. We propose that NEDD4L is a PIK3CA E3 ubiquitin ligase that controls the stability of PIK3CA and is required for the maintenance of PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated 4-like mouse embryonic fibroblast doxycycline column volume progeny 1 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. To examine whether PIK3CA is regulated by ubiquitination in vivo, we transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293T cells with FLAG-tagged PIK3CA alone or in combination with HA-tagged ubiquitin followed by treatment with DMSO or proteasome inhibitor MG132. PIK3CA was then immunoprecipitated and detected with ubiquitin antibody. Proteasome inhibition resulted in an accumulation of ubiquitinated PIK3CA, which were robustly increased by co-expression with an exogenous ubiquitin (Fig. 1A, upper panel). To verify that PIK3CA is indeed directly polyubiquitinated, we immunoblotted PIK3CA in whole cell lysates using an antibody against the FLAG epitope (Fig. 1A, middle panel). The results suggest that PIK3CA is itself polyubiquitinated in vivo; PIK3CA formed high molecular weight shifts in the presence of MG132, and expression of an exogenous ubiquitin resulted in an increase of the polyubiquitinated PIK3CA (Fig. 1A, middle and lower panels). Proteasome-dependent protein degradation is classically mediated by covalent modification of the Lys-48-linked polyubiquitin chain (14Hershko A. Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin system.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6897) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin chains linked through other alternative lysine residues are generally thought to function in signaling transduction even though they may also serve as a proteasome-targeting signal (15Saeki Y. Kudo T. Sone T. Kikuchi Y. Yokosawa H. Toh-e A. Tanaka K. Lysine 63-linked polyubiquitin chain may serve as a targeting signal for the 26S proteasome.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). To determine the chain type involved in PIK3CA polyubiquitination and degradation, we co-expressed PIK3CA with a series of ubiquitin mutants possessing only one lysine residue (Fig. 1B). By immunopurification of PIK3CA and detection of polyubiquitin, we found that PIK3CA was mainly modified by Lys-27-, Lys-29-, and Lys-33-linked chain, among which Lys-29 linkage was the most favored (Fig. 1B). To confirm this, we did similar experiments by substituting the afore-used ubiquitins with single lysine to arginine mutants (Fig. 1C). Consistent with the above results, K29R mutation resulted in the greatest reduction in the mount of the polyubiquitinated PIK3CA (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these data suggest Lys-29-linked chain is the major form for PIK3CA polyubiquitination and degradation. The above findings suggest there should be at least an E3 ubiquitin ligase in cells that catalyze the conjugation of ubiquitin to PIK3CA. To test this hypothesis, we first developed an in vitro ubiquitination assay. As shown in Fig. 1D, after incubation of purified recombinant human ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), ubiquitin and FLAG-tagged PIK3CA together with mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell extracts (S-100) and ATP, PIK3CA showed at least two clear upshifted ladders and a decreased level of native protein (Fig. 1D, lane 8). Dropping off one of the any components in the reactions resulted in only one upshifted ladder or even none at all. Heating of the cell extract decreased the ubiquitination activity to basal level (Fig. 1D, lane 9), suggesting the PIK3CA E3 ligase is likely to be a temperature-sensitive protein. Moreover, the E2 preference was tested using the same assay except equal moles of different E2 enzymes (including Ubch2, -3, -4, -5C, -6, -7) were used in each reaction (Fig. 1E). We observed that Ubch4 and Ubch5C conferred the strongest ubiquitination activity for PIK3CA. We used the mutagenesis strategy to map the ubiquitination sites on PIK3CA. Taking into account the fact that there are total of 72 lysine residues on PIK3CA, we first analyzed the structures of PIK3CA-PIK3R1 heterodimeric complex (16Huang C.H. Mandelker D. Schmidt-Kittler O. Samuels Y. Velculescu V.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Gabelli S.B. Amzel L.M. The structure of a human p110α/p85α complex elucidates the effects of oncogenic PI3Kα mutations.Science. 2007; 318: 1744-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 17Mandelker D. Gabelli S.B. Schmidt-Kittler O. Zhu J. Cheong I. Huang C.H. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Amzel L.M. A frequent kinase domain mutation that changes the interaction between PI3Kα and the membrane.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 16996-17001Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and selected 50 lysine residues that are exposed to the solvent as our mutational targets. We generated 20 PIK3CA mutants, each covering 2–5 lysine to arginine mutations (Fig. 2, A and B). These mutants were co-transfected with ubiquitin in HEK293T cells, treated with MG132, and then immunoprecipitated for detection of ubiquitination (Fig. 2A). We found five PIK3CA mutants (mut4, 5, 8, 9, 10) showed a dramatic decrease in ubiquitination (Fig. 2A). Based on the membrane binding model of PI3K (17Mandelker D. Gabelli S.B. Schmidt-Kittler O. Zhu J. Cheong I. Huang C.H. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Amzel L.M. A frequent kinase domain mutation that changes the interaction between PI3Kα and the membrane.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 16996-17001Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), with the exception of mut4 that locates in the Ras binding domain, all of the ubiquitination-deficient lysine mutations are located in the membrane-contact or membrane-adjacent region (Fig. 2C). Lysine residues in mut5 are on the top of the C2 domain, which mediates the interaction of PI3K with membrane, whereas those in mut8 locate in the N-lobe of kinase domain, which also interacts with membrane. Lysine residues in mut9 and mut10 locate in the C-lobe of kinase domain and, if they do not directly interact, are very close to the membrane. These results indicate lysine residues that either interact with or are close to the cell membrane in PIK3CA are hot spots for ubiquitination. To identify the E3 ligase for PIK3CA ubiquitination, we fractionated the MEF cell extract S-100 by an ion exchange (Q) column and analyzed the E3 ligase activity by using the aforementioned in vitro ubiquitination assay. The activity was eluted out as a wide peak with a salt concentration between 200 and 350 mm NaCl. The active fractions were collected and subjected to a serious of sequential purification steps (Fig. 3A). At the final purification step, PIK3CA E3 ligase activity from the Mono Q column mainly existed in two fractions, which efficiently promoted the polyubiquitination of PIK3CA (Fig. 3B). The fractions were applied to silver staining, and inspection of the gel revealed one band, indicated by an arrow in Fig. 3B, correlated perfectly with the activity. The observed molecular weight of this band was in agreement with the corresponding elution volumes on gel filtration (Fig. 3C). Mass spectrum analysis revealed this protein to be NEDD4L (neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated 4-like), an E3 ubiquitin ligase known to associate with the plasma membrane and previously shown to ubiquitinate multiple membrane proteins (18Goel P. Manning J.A. Kumar S. NEDD4–2 (NEDD4L): the ubiquitin ligase for multiple membrane proteins.Gene. 2015; 557: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To confirm that NEDD4L is involved in ubiquitination of PIK3CA, we expressed and purified recombinant NEDD4L protein from insect cells (Fig. 4A, upper and lower panel). The addition of recombinant NEDD4L greatly enhanced in vitro ubiquitination of PIK3CA (Fig. 4B, lanes 7 and 8). At low concentrations, NEDD4L protein levels were positively correlated with the amount of ubiquitin molecules attached to PIK3CA (Fig. 4C); at high concentrations, NEDD4L promoted polyubiquitination of PIK3CA, which showed a dramatically delayed shift on gel and even partially stacked at the bottom of the loading wells (Fig. 4C). Heat treatment (50 °C for 10 min) of recombinant NEDD4L protein largely abrogated its E3 ligase activity (Fig. 4C). Because PIK3CA forms obligate heterodimers with p85 regulatory subunits (3Geering B. Cutillas P.R. Nock G. Gharbi S.I. Vanhaesebroeck B. Class IA phosphoinositide 3-kinases are obligate p85-p110 heterodimers.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7809-7814Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), we asked whether NEDD4L can also ubiquitinate p85 subunits and whether heterodimerization affects the ubiquitination of PIK3CA. To address this question, we co-transfected plasmids encoding PIK3R1 (one of the p85 subunits) and PIK3CA, either alone or in combination with NEDD4L in HEK293T cells. We pulled down the target proteins and analyzed their ubiquitination level. As shown in Fig. 5A, NEDD4L co-transfection with the addition of MG132 greatly promoted the accumulation of polyubiquitinated PIK3CA (Fig. 5A, lane 8) compared with NEDD4L absent control (Fig. 5A, lane 6), whereas we did not observe an ubiquitination signal on immunoprecipitated PIK3R1 in the presence of MG132 (Fig. 5A, lane 2). Co-transfection of PIK3R1 with NEDD4L in the presence of MG132 caused a detection of a rather low level of ubiquitination on immunoprecipitated PIK3R1 (Fig. 5A, lane 4), which cannot be distinguished with the endogenous ubiquitinated PIK3CA that co-pulled-down with FLAG-tagged PIK3R1. In addition, the PIK3CA E3 ligase activity was not affected by the co-transfection of PIK3R1 (Fig. 5A, compare lane 8 with lane 12), suggesting NEDD4L can ubiquitinate heterodimeric PI3K. In summary, these results suggest that NEDD4L mainly targets PIK3CA but not PIK3R1 for ubiquitination. Dimerization of PIK3CA with PIK3R1 does not show obvious impact on the efficiency of NEDD4L-mediated ubiquitination. To confirm the hypothesis that polyubiquitination of PIK3CA by NEDD4L leads to protein degradation, we performed a cycloheximide (CHX) chase assay (Fig. 5B). HeLa cells stably overexpressing GFP or NEDD4L were treated with cycloheximide and collected at interval time points. The endogenous PIK3CA protein levels in the normalized cell lysates were visualized by Western blot. We observed that NEDD4L overexpression caused a higher turnover rate of PIK3CA in contrast to the GFP control (Fig. 5B). Consistent with this observation, the decrement of PIK3CA protein levels were positively correlated with the amount of transfected NEDD4L plasmid in HEK293T cells (Fig. 5C). PI3K recruitment to the cell membrane in response to activation of receptor-tyrosine kinases leads to the phosphorylation of downstream kinase AKT (1Cantley L.C. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway.Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4653) Google Scholar, 2Downward J. PI 3-kinase, Akt and cell survival.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Because NEDD4L targets PIK3CA for proteasomal degradation, we tested whether overexpression NEDD4L down-regulates the PI3K-AKT pathway. We examined the phosphorylation levels of AKT in HeLa cells overexpressing GFP or NEDD4L. As expected, NEDD4L overexpression resulted in decreased level of AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 5D, compare lane 6 with lane 1). Because the phosphorylation signal of AKT in HeLa cells was relatively low, we treated the cells with Torin1, an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) that at low concentrations up-regulates PI3K-AKT signaling by relieving the feedback inhibition of this pathway from mTOR complex 1 (19Peterson T.R. Laplante M. Thoreen C.C. Sancak Y. Kang S.A. Kuehl W.M. Gray N.S. Sabatini D.M. DEPTOR is an mTOR inhibitor frequently overexpressed in multiple myeloma cells and required for their survival.Cell. 2009; 137: 873-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar, 20Thoreen C.C. Kang S.A. Chang J.W. Liu Q. Zhang J. Gao Y. Reichling L.J. Sim T. Sabatini D.M. Gray N.S. An ATP-competitive mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor reveals rapamycin-resistant functions of mTORC1.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 8023-8032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). In accordance with the above results, treatment of Torin1 caused a dramatic increase in AKT phosphorylation in HeLa cells overexpressing GFP (Fig. 5D, lane 2–5), whereas the increase of AKT phosphorylation in NEDD4L-overexpressing cells was very limited (Fig. 5D, lanes 6–10). As overexpression of NEDD4L down-regulates PI3K-AKT signaling, we expected suppression of NEDD4L expression might have opposite effects. To test this, we stably expressed short hairpin RNA (shRNA), which targets NEDD4L mRNA in a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible manner in both H157 and Beas2B cells. The two cell lines were treated with Dox for 5 days and deprived of fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 24 h followed by treatment with FBS for different duration times (Fig. 6, A and B). In both cells, NEDD4L knockdown resulted in an overall increased levels of PIK3CA whose differences were especially large at time points 0–10 min. We noticed there was a down-regulation of PIK3CA protein level in the absence of FBS, which was less apparent in NEDD4L-knockdown cells, suggesting a dysregulation of the PIK3CA dynamics. Unexpectedly, although PIK3CA protein levels were elevated in NEDD4L-knockdown cells, phosphorylation of AKT at both Thr-308 and Ser-473 in response to FBS stimulation was impaired (Fig. 6, A and B). In Dox absent controls, phosphorylation of AKT reached a peak within 5 min after FBS treatment, whereas in NEDD4L-knockdown cells, the overall AKT phosphorylation level was much lower, and the time point for peak phosphorylation was delayed for 30 min and 120 min in H157 and Beas2B cells, respectively. These results suggest NEDD4L is involved in the regulation of PIK3CA dynamics, which is required for efficient signaling transduction. To further confirm the functional role of NEDD4L in PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, we engineered A549 cells to stably express two different sets of shRNAs against NEDD4L. Because the phosphorylation signal of AKT in A549 cells was relatively low in our preliminary examination (as previously reported; Ref. 21Brognard J. Clark A.S. Ni Y. Dennis P.A. Akt/protein kinase B is constitutively active in non-small cell lung cancer cells and promotes cellular survival and resistance to chemotherapy and radiation.Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3986-3997PubMed Google Scholar), we treated the cells with Torin1 to up-regulate PI3K-AKT signaling and then compared the phosphorylation levels of AKT between control and NEDD4L-knockdown cells. Similar to the previously described effects of NEDD4L knockdown (Fig. 6, A and B), NEDD4L suppression in A549 cells resulted in a very limited increase in the AKT phosphorylation level in the presence of Torin1 (Fig. 6C). To exclude the possibility that these observations were off-target effects of shRNA, we rescued the knockdown cells with a codon-modified NEDD4L (Fig. 6D). Stable expression of an exogenous NEDD4L, which is resistant to the shRNA, greatly increased the phosphorylation level of AKT, underscoring the importance of NEDD4L in maintenance of the robustness of PI3K-AKT signaling. To examine the ubiquitination states of PIK3CA in vivo and to verify the importance of NEDD4L in PIK3CA ubiquitination, we treated Beas2B-inducible knockdown cells as illustrated in Fig. 7A. The endogenous PIK3CA protein was then immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and detected with ubiquitin antibody. We observed that in NEDD4L-expressing cells, PIK3CA was polyubiquitinated under both serum-absent and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-present conditions (Fig. 7B, lane 1 and 2). In NEDD4L-deficient cells, PIK3CA ubiquitination showed a dramatic decrease in the absence of serum compared with control cells, suggesting a major role of NEDD4L in catalyzing PIK3CA ubiquitination under serum deprivation (Fig. 7B, lane 3). This result is consistent with the previous observation that in the absence of serum PIK3CA protein was down-regulated in control but not NEDD4L-deficient cells (Fig. 6, A and B). In contrast, NEDD4L knockdown did not affect the ubiquitination level of PIK3CA under IGF stimulation (Fig. 7B, lane 4), suggesting that in addition to NEDD4L, there is another E3 ligase in cells that polyubiquitinates PIK3CA when PI3K-AKT pathway is activated. To examine whether the effects of NEDD4L loss on PI3K-AKT pathway are physiologically relevant, we measured the cell growth, a major output of PI3K-AKT pathway, in control and NEDD4L-knockdown Beas2B cells. Equal numbers of cells were seeded in the dish and grew for 5 days in the presence or absence of Dox. We observed that cells with reduced NEDD4L expression had an obvious decrease in cell confluency, and this phenomenon was not caused by the addition of Dox as the confluency of wild type Beas2B cells was not affected (Fig. 8A). We further found that the decrease in cell confluency was due to a dramatic decrease in cell size of NEDD4L-deficient Beas2B cells but not a decrease in cell number (Fig. 8, B and C). Because PI3K promotes glycolysis and thus promotes lactate production (22Vander Heiden M.G. Cantley L.C. Thompson C.B. Understanding the Warburg effect: the metabolic requirements of cell proliferation.Science. 2009; 324: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (10213) Google Scholar), we compared the lactate concentration in the medium of control and NEDD4L-knockdown Beas2B cells under equal culture conditions. As expected, NEDD4L-knockdown resulted in relatively low lactate production (Fig. 8D), suggesting a decrease in PI3K-AKT signaling. To further verify the negative effect of NEDD4L knockdown on PI3K-AKT pathway, we did a soft agar colony formation assay. Equal numbers of H157-inducible knockdown cells were seeded in soft agar and cultured in the presence or absence of Dox. We found the colony number was dramatically decreased when NEDD4L was suppressed (Fig. 8, E and F), suggesting an important role of NEDD4L in maintaining PI3K-AKT signaling. NEDD4L is a HECT family E3 ubiquitin ligase containing four WW domains for substrate interaction (23Yang B. Kumar S. Nedd4 and Nedd4–2: closely related ubiquitin-protein ligases with distinct physiological functions.Cell Death Differ. 2010; 17: 68-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We did not, however, observe an interaction between NEDD4L and PIK3CA by co-immunoprecipitation analysis. Nonetheless, our results support the notion that NEDD4L ubiquitinates PIK3CA and targets it for proteasome degradation in vivo. First, co-transfection of NEDD4L increased the amount of the polyubiquitinated PIK3CA in the presence of proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 5A). Second, overexpression of NEDD4L accelerated the turnover rate of PIK3CA, whereas knockdown of it led to the increased level of endogenous PIK3CA (Figs. 5B and 6). Third, NEDD4L knockdown greatly impaired the ubiquitination of endogenous PIK3CA under serum deprivation conditions (Fig. 7B). Moreover, NEDD4L contains a C2 domain that is involved in plasma membrane association (24Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. The C2 domain calcium-binding motif: structural and functional diversity.Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar, 25Plant P.J. Yeger H. Staub O. Howard P. Rotin D.

Chem. 1997; 272: 32329-32336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). A recent structural study suggests NEDD4L likely exhibits maximal activity when localized to membrane (26Escobedo A. Gomes T. Aragón E. Martín-Malpartida P. Ruiz L. Macias M.J. Structural basis of the activation and degradation mechanisms of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4L.Structure. 2014; 22: 1446-1457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). By interaction with membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), NEDD4L undergoes a conformational change, thus relieved from a self-inhibiting state (26Escobedo A. Gomes T. Aragón E. Martín-Malpartida P. Ruiz L. Macias M.J. Structural basis of the activation and degradation mechanisms of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4L.Structure. 2014; 22: 1446-1457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These results provide a rationale for NEDD4L to catalyze the ubiquitination of membrane or membrane-associated proteins such as PIK3CA. Dysregulation of NEDD4L occurs in the progression of various cancers. Decreased levels of NEDD4L has been seen in gastric cancer (27Gao C. Pang L. Ren C. Ma T.

https://openalex.org/W2460994459,"Just as quantum electrodynamics describes how electrons are bound in atoms by the electromagnetic force, mediated by the exchange of photons, quantum chromodynamics (QCD) describes how quarks are bound inside hadrons by the strong force, mediated by the exchange of gluons. QCD seems to allow hadrons constructed from increasingly many quarks to exist, just as atoms with increasing numbers of electrons exist, yet such complex constructions seemed, until recently, not to be present in nature. Here we describe advances in the spectroscopy of mesons that are refining our understanding of the rules for predicting hadron structure from QCD. Advances in meson spectroscopy can enhance our understanding of how composite objects emerge from the fundamental underlying theory of interacting quarks and gluons, quantum chromodynamics. Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) describes how quarks get together to form hadrons. The most common hadrons are baryons, such as protons and neutrons, which consist of three quarks, and mesons, which consist of a quark–antiquark pair. But, in principle, QCD allows much more exotic constructions: particles consisting of many more quarks, or particles consisting of gluons, the carriers of the strong force, as well as quarks. Although examples of such exotic states have been found recently, experimental results and high-accuracy theoretical predictions from lattice QCD do not yield a clear pattern that would allow for deriving a rulebook for hadron construction from QCD. This Review discusses recent experimental and theoretical results obtained in the search for the rules that govern hadron construction, and the authors give their perspective on current and future research efforts in this area."

The plant cell is highly compartmentalized, containing at least seven different types of organelles that are involved in metabolism and cellular maintenance. In many cases, metabolic pathways and other cellular processes are not confined to one organelle but require the cooperation of several of them, e.g. in protein secretion or photorespiration. Metabolic networking between compartments thus requires directed and coordinated exchange of biochemical pathway intermediates across organellar membranes (1Philippar K. Soll J. Plant Solute Transport.in: Yeo A.R. Flowers T.J. Blackwell Publishing, Ltd., Oxford, UK2007: 133-192Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Chloroplasts and mitochondria are unique endosymbiotic cellular organelles, which like their prokaryotic ancestors are surrounded by two membranes. The inner membrane of both organelles is derived from the bacterial plasma membrane. Surprisingly, also the outer membrane largely originated from and still resembles the outer membrane of the Gram-negative-like bacterial endosymbiont (2Block M.A. Douce R. Joyard J. Rolland N.

Linka N. Connecting the plastid: transporters of the plastid envelope and their role in linking plastidial with cytosolic metabolism.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2011; 62: 53-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These transporters are hydrophobic, polytopic, and mainly α-helical membrane proteins facilitating the exchange of metabolic precursors, intermediates, and final products between plastids and the cytoplasm. In contrast, the characteristic channels of the outer membranes in bacteria, chloroplasts as well as mitochondria, span the membrane in the form of β-strands that are organized to form a barrel-like pore structure (4Zeth K. Thein M. Porins in prokaryotes and eukaryotes: common themes and variations.Biochem. J. 2010; 431: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Proteins sharing this three-dimensional arrangement were implied in a variety of functions, including protein import (5Bredemeier R. Schlegel T. Ertel F. Vojta A. Borissenko L. Bohnsack M.T.

The plastid outer envelope–a highly dynamic interface between plastid and cytoplasm.Front. Plant Sci. 2011; 2: 97Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the outer mitochondrial membrane, so far only VDAC has been identified as the main solute pore. However, it has been shown that ΔVDAC mouse models, in which all three VDAC isoforms VDAC-1, VDAC-2, VDAC-3 have been deleted, were not severely impaired in metabolite exchange between mitochondria and cytosol nor in Ca2+ homeostasis and apoptosis signaling (12Baines C.P. Kaiser R.A. Sheiko T. Craigen W.J. Molkentin J.D. Voltage-dependent anion channels are dispensable for mitochondrial-dependent cell death 1.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Similarly, yeast VDAC deletion strains were viable and only slightly impaired under harsh growth conditions (13Blachly-Dyson E. Song J. Wolfgang W.J. Colombini M. Forte M. Multicopy suppressors of phenotypes resulting from the absence of yeast VDAC encode a VDAC-like protein.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5727-5738Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Thus, other not yet identified metabolite pores are likely present in the outer mitochondrial membrane. In contrast, in the chloroplast outer envelope membrane (OE) four different solute channels have been identified. They can in principle process and transport numerous metabolites (10Duy D. Soll J. Philippar K. Solute channels of the outer membrane: from bacteria to chloroplasts.Biol. Chem. 2007; 388: 879-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 11Breuers F.K. Bräutigam A. Weber A.P. The plastid outer envelope–a highly dynamic interface between plastid and cytoplasm.Front. Plant Sci. 2011; 2: 97Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although specific and regulated solute channels are present in the OE, it remained a matter of debate to what extent transport is regulated in vivo (14Bölter B. Soll J. Ion channels in the outer membranes of chloroplasts and mitochondria: open doors or regulated gates?.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 935-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although the analysis of Arabidopsis knock-out lines for the β-barrel channels OEP21, OEP24, and OEP37 did not reveal any visible plant defects under standard growth conditions, the loss of the α-helical OE amino acid channel OEP16.2 showed germination defects and metabolic imbalances in the presence of the seed dormancy hormone abscisic acid (15Pudelski B.

Here, we report the identification and functional characterization of a new member of the β-barrel chloroplast OEP family, namely OEP40, that is selectively permeable to glucose and its phosphorylated derivatives. Remarkably, the OEP40 channel is regulated in its channel properties by trehalose 6-phosphate. Furthermore, loss of OEP40 function in Arabidopsis plants results in an early flowering phenotype at cold temperature. In summary, our results indicate that OEP40 is the “glucose-gate” of the chloroplast OE showing that metabolite transport is regulated at the outer plastid envelope membrane. In an attempt to identify porin-type solute channels in the OE membrane of chloroplasts, we separated a highly purified OE membrane fraction from Pisum sativum (pea) chloroplasts by SDS-PAGE in the presence or absence of urea. One of the protein bands, which showed a clear difference in electrophoretic mobility, was further analyzed by mass spectroscopy. The four identified peptides (supplemental Fig. S1) matched pea-expressed sequence tags (16Franssen S.U. Shrestha R.P. Bräutigam A. Bornberg-Bauer E. Weber A.P. Comprehensive transcriptome analysis of the highly complex Pisum sativum genome using next generation sequencing.BMC Genomics. 2011; 12: 227Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) that are annotated as the Arabidopsis gene At3g57990. At3g57990 represents a single-copy gene, encoding for a protein of 39.8 kDa with an isoelectric point of 10.0, which was named At-OEP40 (supplemental Fig. S1). To analyze protein function, we isolated the cDNA of OEP40 genes from Arabidopsis and pea. Ps-OEP40 (GenBankTM accession number KT361648) corresponds to a polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 42.4 kDa and an isoelectric point of 9.3 (supplemental Fig. S1). We confirmed the OE localization by immunoblot on purified pea chloroplast subfractions (Fig. 1A, for antiserum specificity see supplemental Fig. S2). To analyze whether Ps-OEP40 represents an integral membrane protein, pea chloroplast OE membranes were treated with high salt, alkaline pH, urea or detergent and subsequently separated into membrane and soluble fractions. In this assay, Ps-OEP40 behaved like a known β-barrel channel in the chloroplast OE, OEP37 (9Goetze T.A. Philippar K. Ilkavets I. Soll J. Wagner R.

To verify a potential β-barrel structure of OEP40, recombinant At-OEP40 and as control At-OEP37 proteins were refolded in the presence of SDS and 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol and subsequently subjected to circular dichroism (CD) analysis. CD measurements revealed 35.6% of β-sheet structures in OEP40 (supplemental Fig. S3 B), indicating that OEP40 is likely to form a β-barrel in the OE. These findings were qualitatively confirmed by a bioinformatic analysis (18Buchan D.W. Minneci F. Nugent T.C. Bryson K. Jones D.T. Scalable web services for the PSIPRED protein analysis workbench.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: W349-W357Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar), predicting a relative content of ∼28% of β-sheets and only ∼11% of α-helices for OEP40. Because OEP40 appears to be a plant-specific protein with no templates in public databases, straightforward homology modeling of its probable structure is not readily possible. However, reliable secondary structure predictions (18Buchan D.W. Minneci F. Nugent T.C. Bryson K. Jones D.T.

Restricted structure modeling (20Randall A. Cheng J. Sweredoski M. Baldi P. TMBpro: secondary structure, β-contact and tertiary structure prediction of transmembrane β-barrel proteins.Bioinformatics. 2008; 24: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) suggests a 10 transmembrane β-barrel pore structure within the N-terminal section of the protein as a working model (Fig. 1B). Next, we tested whether OEP40 might also be able to constitute a pore using the planar bilayer technique. Therefore, recombinant Ps-OEP40 from three different expression systems was purified to homogeneity (see supplemental Fig. S2) and reconstituted into liposomes. OEP40-proteoliposomes obtained from the different preparations were then assayed for channel activity using the planar bilayer system (21Harsman A. Bartsch P. Hemmis B. Kruger V. Wagner R. Exploring protein import pores of cellular organelles at the single molecule level using the planar lipid bilayer technique.Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2011; 90: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). After fusion of the OEP40 proteoliposomes with the planar bilayers, channel activity could be detected in all cases. In contrast, mock-control samples did not show any channel activity. Because the basic electrophysiological properties obtained from the individual channel recordings were identical for the three different Ps-OEP40 preparations, we will representatively describe the results obtained with the Ps-OEP40(His6) protein derived from the Escherichia coli expression system. During the application of a voltage gate, the OEP40 channel was mainly open but displayed short flickering gating events at lower membrane potentials (Vm = ±60 mV). At higher membrane potentials (Vm > ±60 mV), the channel closed (Fig. 2A). Mean variance analysis (Fig. 2, B and C) (22Patlak J.B. Measuring kinetics of complex single ion channel data using mean-variance histograms.Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 29-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) discloses that the OEP40 channel has subconductance states (Ḡmax = ≅692 ± 6 pS, Ḡsub1 ≅550 ± 4 pS, Ḡsub2 ≅325 ± 6 pS at Vm = −100 mV). From the conductance Ḡmax ≅325 pS, a first approximation of the diameter of the restriction zone within the OEP40 channel of dpore ≅1.4 nm may be calculated using the Ohmic model of Hille (23Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar) (for details see supplemental Methods). In voltage ramps the channel also displayed a slightly rectifying current voltage relation with a rectification ratio rrec = i⃗/i⃖ ≈ 1.5 − 2.5 (Fig. 2D). In asymmetric buffers, the channel showed a reversal potential of Vrev = 29.0 ± 2.3 mV (n > 6) (Fig. 2E). Using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) approach (23Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar), this corresponds to a minor cation selectivity of the OEP40 channel (PK+/PCl− ≈4:1). Additionally we observed a slightly asymmetric open probability with the OEP40 channel more frequently residing in a closed state at negative Vm (Fig. 2F). To elucidate transport specificity, we tested the effect of different photosynthetic metabolites, namely glucose, glucose 1-phosphate (Glc-1-P), glucose 6-phosphate (Glc-6-P), maltose, as well as the signaling metabolite trehalose 6-phosphate (Tre-6-P) (24Lunn J.E. Delorge I. Figueroa C.M. Van Dijck P. Stitt M. Trehalose metabolism in plants.Plant J. 2014; 79: 544-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) on the OEP40 channel activity. Because the effects of symmetric addition of glucose, Glc-1-P, and Glc-6-P on the channel gating were identical, representative data are shown in the presence of glucose in Fig. 3. When glucose or the phosphorylated derivatives were added symmetrically to both sides of the bilayer (cis/trans), strong flickering of the channel currents between the fully open and the closed state was observed (Fig. 3, A–C). To acquire information on the details of glucose transport by OEP40, we performed an in-depth mean variance analysis of the glucose-induced gating transitions of OEP40 (22Patlak J.B. Measuring kinetics of complex single ion channel data using mean-variance histograms.Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 29-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The concentration- and voltage-dependent flickering presumably represents electrostatic or steric modulation of the current through the pore, caused by partitioning of glucose molecules into, or their transport through the OEP40 channel. The mean variance analysis revealed two classes of gating transitions, “fast” transitions characterized by short dwell times and voltage-independent frequency and “slow” transitions, displaying longer and slightly voltage-dependent dwell times as well as frequency (Fig. 3, D and E). In addition, at a given voltage the reciprocal interevent time between the slow closing events was linearly dependent on the glucose concentration with kon ≅8.58 ± 1.15·10−3 m−1 s−1 at Vm = −80 mV (supplemental Fig. S4). This as well as the pronounced biphasic voltage dependence of the slow dwell times at negative Vm argue in favor of the translocation of glucose through the OEP40 channel (25Movileanu L. Schmittschmitt J.P. Scholtz J.M. Bayley H. Interactions of peptides with a protein pore.Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 1030-1045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Because a complete analysis of the interactions between the OEP40 channel and glucose cannot be performed within the scope of this report, we may in a first approximation interpret the voltage-independent, mean blocking time of τ̄block ≅ 37 ms at positive Vm (see Fig. 3D) as the average transit time for glucose across the channel (25Movileanu L. Schmittschmitt J.P. Scholtz J.M. Bayley H. Interactions of peptides with a protein pore.Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 1030-1045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). This would mean that glucose could pass the OEP40 channel at a minimum rate of rtransport ≅27 molecules/s. Translocation of the charged glucose derivatives, Glc-1-P and Glc-6-P, can be more easily tested by measuring the effect of asymmetric addition of the respective molecule on the current-voltage relationship of OEP40. Although addition of uncharged glucose to one side of the bilayer does not affect OEP40 (Fig. 3F), we reproducibly observed a shift in the zero current potential of the current-voltage curve upon addition of its charged derivatives, which demonstrates electrogenic transport of Glc-1-P (Fig. 4, A–C) and Glc-6-P (data not shown) through the OEP40 channel. In particular, we investigated the effect of Glc-1-P in the cis compartment on the reversal potential of the OEP40 channel at different symmetrical (cis/trans) concentrations of KCl. According to the GHK expression (see Equations 1–3 in supplemental Methods), it is expected that at low KCl concentrations the shift in the reversal potential (Vrev) at a constant Glc-1-P concentration will be more pronounced than at higher KCl concentrations. Fig. 4, A–C, shows the current-voltage relation of the OEP40 channel in different symmetrical (cis/trans) KCl buffer (20, 100, and 250 mm) with additional 6 mm Glc-1-P in the cis compartment and the respective controls. Using the GHK approximation and assuming that (i) the relative permeability PK+/PCl− = 4:1 does not change in the presence of Glc-1-P and that (ii) K+ and Na+ ions, the latter supplied with the Glc-1-P disodium salt, are equally permeant, we can calculate the relative permeability as PGlc-1-P/PK+/PCl− ≅ 48:4:1, respectively (for details see supplemental Methods). The results of these calculations are summarized in Table 1. From these it is obvious that the conductance values of the OEP40 channel determined from the slope conductance of current-voltage ramps at the low conductance site increase linearly up to an ion concentration of 250 mm K+, revealing that the conductance under these conditions is not saturating. The Glc-1-P-induced change in the reversal potential dropped significantly with increasing KCl concentrations as expected for Glc-1-P being permeant. In line with this, the apparent relative permeability for Glc-1-P, PGlc-1-P (app), as calculated by Equations 1–3 in supplemental Methods, was nearly constant at the different KCl concentrations (see Table 1). In summary, we can conclude that OEP40 is permeable for Glc-1-P and Glc-6-P as well as for uncharged glucose (compare Fig. 3). The disaccharide maltose in contrast did not show any marked effect on the activity of the OEP40 channel (supplemental Fig. S5), indicating that the interaction of the OEP40 channel with glucose is specific.TABLE 1Conductance and Glc-1-P induced zero current potential shift of the OEP40 channel at different ionic strengthcKCl (cis)cKCl(trans)cGlc-1-P(cis)ḡVrevPGlc-1-P(app)mmmmmmpSmV2502500325 ± 380̶250+2506380 ± 23−6.74812 Na+1001000127 ± 1.80−100+1006123 ± 3.0−11.94712 Na+2020030 ± 4.60−20+20626.7 ± 0.6−26.94912 Na+ Open table in a new tab We then tested whether Tre-6-P, a known signal of a plant's sucrose status (24Lunn J.E. Delorge I. Figueroa C.M. Van Dijck P. Stitt M. Trehalose metabolism in plants.Plant J. 2014; 79: 544-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), can also permeate the OEP40 channel. Tre-6-P added to both sides of the channel in contrast to glucose and its derivatives barely induced flickering of the OEP40 channel (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, in the presence of Tre-6-P the OEP40 channel more often resided in an open conformation, thus increasing the open probability, especially at negative Vm values (Fig. 5B). However, the channel mainly flickered between channel sub-states (supplemental Fig. S6), thereby reducing the observed maximum conductance Gmax of the OEP40 channel (Fig. 5C). In contrast to our observations with the charged glucose derivative Glc-1-P (see above), addition of 1 mm charged Tre-6-P under symmetrical low KCl concentration (20 mm) to the low conductance cis compartment did not induce a change in the reversal potential (Fig. 5D). Thus, even though the channel would still be large enough to accommodate mono- and disaccharide metabolites, these results argue against a permeability of OEP40 for Tre-6-P. However, in a tri-ionic experiment, where 1 mm Tre-6-P was added under asymmetric buffer conditions to the low conductance cis compartment, the zero current potential shifted slightly toward higher values (Fig. 5, E and F). In these experiments with two different KCl ion gradients across the bilayer, i.e. 250/20 mm cis/trans (Fig. 5E) and 20/100 mm cis/trans (Fig. 5F), we observed in both cases a Tre-6-P-induced shift of the reversal potential from Vrev = 29 ± 1.6 mV to Vrev = 35 ± 2.1 mV (250/20 mm KCl cis/trans) and Vrev = −19 ±1.9 mV to −21 ± 1.3 mV (20/100 mm KCl cis/trans). Using the GHK approach, both results are compatible with a Tre-6-P-induced increase of the selectivity from PK+/PCl− = 4:1 to PK+/PCl− = 6:1 (see analogous calculations in supplemental Methods). The slight increase of the reversal potential, at the given experimental setup, shows that Tre-6-P cannot permeate the OEP40 channel, but rather binds to it and thereby exerts modulating effects on the ion flux through the OEP40 pore. Thus, Tre-6-P appears to be a specific effector of the OEP40 channel. To assess the function of OEP40 in planta, we analyzed phenotypes of OEP40 T-DNA insertion lines in Arabidopsis (supplemental Fig. S7A). Although the line oep40-1 represents a knockdown with about 30% residual transcripts and proteins, oep40-3 is a true loss-of-function mutant because neither mRNA nor protein was detectable (supplemental Fig. S7, B and C). No obvious phenotypic differences for both mutant lines were observed when compared with wild type under various growth conditions and different length of day, except when plants were grown at 10 °C, a temperature in which plant growth in general is greatly reduced. Here, oep40-1 and oep40-3 both showed an early flowering phenotype (Fig. 6, A and B). We next recorded days to bolting and total leaf numbers, both of which are established parameters to measure differences in flowering time. When grown at 10 °C, both oep40 mutant lines bolted about 5–6 days earlier than wild-type plants (Fig. 6C). This was also reflected by the total leaf numbers recorded for oep40-1 and oep40-3. However, flowering time did not significantly change when plants were grown at a normal temperature (21 °C day/16 °C night, Fig. 6D). Transition to flowering in plants is a highly coordinated process influenced by many external factors, like day length or temperature, but also by internal factors such as the plants' age and its sucrose status (26Blümel M. Dally N. Jung C. Flowering time regulation in crops–what did we learn from Arabidopsis?.Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2015; 32: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). To determine the transition to flowering also on a morphological and molecular basis, we followed the morphological changes at the shoot apical meristem (SAM) from oep40-1, oep40-3, and wild-type lines over a 3-week time period. We used LEAFY (LFY), a plant-specific transcription factor (27Siriwardana N.S. Lamb R.S. The poetry of reproduction: the role of LEAFY in Arabidopsis thaliana flower formation.Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2012; 56: 207-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), as an RNA probe to identify emerging floral primordia. About 4 days earlier than in wild type, we detected strong LFY transcript-specific signals in apices of oep40-1 and oep40-3 lines (Fig. 7). In general, effects were slightly more prominent in the knock-out line oep40-3 than in oep40-1 (knockdown). These results correlated well with the morphological changes described above. We have demonstrated that the reconstituted recombinant OEP40 forms a high conductance channel in planar lipid bilayers. CD spectroscopy results of the refolded recombinant protein agree with bioinformatic analysis in classifying OEP40 as a mainly β-sheet protein. Thus, we propose that OEP40 forms a water-filled β-barrel channel pore in the chloroplast OE. The electrophysiological properties of OEP40 show that the channel is permeable for glucose and its phosphorylated derivatives but not for maltose and Tre-6-P. In vivo, glucose, Glc-1-P, and Glc-6-P are major metabolites to be exchanged between the chloroplast and the cytosol (28Schäfer G. Heber U.

https://openalex.org/W2469062516,"The complement system is an important part of the innate immune response to infection but may also cause severe complications during inflammation. Small molecule antagonists to complement receptor 3 (CR3) have been widely sought, but a structural basis for their mode of action is not available. We report here on the structure of the human CR3 ligand-binding I domain in complex with simvastatin. Simvastatin targets the metal ion-dependent adhesion site of the open, ligand-binding conformation of the CR3 I domain by direct contact with the chelated Mg(2+) ion. Simvastatin antagonizes I domain binding to the complement fragments iC3b and C3d but not to intercellular adhesion molecule-1. By virtue of the I domain's wide distribution in binding kinetics to ligands, it was possible to identify ligand binding kinetics as discriminator for simvastatin antagonism. In static cellular experiments, 15-25 μm simvastatin reduced adhesion by K562 cells expressing recombinant CR3 and by primary human monocytes, with an endogenous expression of this receptor. Application of force to adhering monocytes potentiated the effects of simvastatin where only a 50-100 nm concentration of the drug reduced the adhesion by 20-40% compared with untreated cells. The ability of simvastatin to target CR3 in its ligand binding-activated conformation is a novel mechanism to explain the known anti-inflammatory effects of this compound, in particular because this CR3 conformation is found in pro-inflammatory environments. Our report points to new designs of CR3 antagonists and opens new perspectives and identifies druggable receptors from characterization of the ligand binding kinetics in the presence of antagonists."
https://openalex.org/W2461680172,"Whether tumor suppressor WWOX (WW domain-containing oxidoreductase) stimulates immune cell maturation is largely unknown. Here, we determined that Tyr-33-phosphorylated WWOX physically binds non-phosphorylated ERK and IκBα in immature acute lymphoblastic leukemia MOLT-4 T cells and in the naïve mouse spleen. The IκBα·ERK·WWOX complex was shown to localize, in part, in the mitochondria. WWOX prevents IκBα from proteasomal degradation. Upon stimulating MOLT-4 with ionophore A23187/phorbol myristate acetate, endogenous IκBα and ERK undergo rapid phosphorylation in <5 min, and subsequently WWOX is Tyr-33 and Tyr-287 de-phosphorylated and Ser-14 phosphorylated. Three hours later, IκBα starts to degrade, and ERK returns to basal or non-phosphorylation, and this lasts for the next 12 h. Finally, expression of CD3 and CD8 occurs in MOLT-4 along with reappearance of the IκBα·ERK·WWOX complex near 24 h. Inhibition of ERK phosphorylation by U0126 or IκBα degradation by MG132 prevents MOLT-4 maturation. By time-lapse FRET microscopy, IκBα·ERK·WWOX complex exhibits an increased binding strength by 1–2-fold after exposure to ionophore A23187/phorbol myristate acetate for 15–24 h.

Meanwhile, a portion of ERK and WWOX relocates to the nucleus, suggesting their role in the induction of CD3 and CD8 expression in MOLT-4. The pathway by which T cells differentiate via various stages of selection has been well documented (1Starr T.K. Jameson S.C. Hogquist K.A. Positive and negative selection of T cells.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). Briefly, bone marrow pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell differentiates into precursor T cell and then migrates to the thymus. In mouse thymus, precursor T cell (CD44low) differentiates into CD4-CD8 double-negative cell and then goes through four stages, namely stage I CD44+CD25-, stage II CD44+ CD25+, stage III CD44-CD25+ with pre-TCR 2The abbreviations used are: TCRT cell receptordndominant negativeNF-κBnuclear factor κBPMA12-myristate 13-acetateDsRedDiscosoma sp. red fluorescent proteinECFPenhanced cyan fluorescent proteinEGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinEYFPenhanced yellow fluorescent proteinIκBαinhibitor of NF-κBIoPionophore A23187/phorbol myristate acetateWWOXWW domain-containing oxidoreductase.

Immunol. 2003; 21: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). After stage IV, double-negative cells differentiate into CD4/CD8 double-positive cells with TCR (T cell receptor) expression. The CD4 and CD8 single-positive cells, regulatory T cells (Treg), and natural killer-like T cells (NKT) are generated after further positive and negative selection (2Koch U. Radtke F. Mechanisms of T cell development and transformation.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2011; 27: 539-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 3Bottero V. Withoff S. Verma I.M. NF-κB and the regulation of hematopoiesis.Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 785-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In comparison, human hematopoietic progenitor cells, possessing CD34, CD7, and CD5 markers, undergo similar developmental stages to become mature T cells (4Zhu M.X. Wan W.L. Li H.S. Wang J. Chen G.A.

T cell receptor-β and -α (TCR-β/α) subunits form a complex on the cell membrane in the double-negative stage. The surface CD3 complex expression level is elevated during double-positive to single-positive transition (1Starr T.K. Jameson S.C. Hogquist K.A. Positive and negative selection of T cells.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). TCR-β/α and CD3 complexes on the cell surface receive stimulatory signals from major histocompatibility complex (MHC) for triggering the downstream activation cascade for cell maturation and activation (6Zúñiga-Pflücker J.C. Lenardo M.J. Regulation of thymocyte development from immature progenitors.Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). MAPK pathway is implicated in the positive/negative selection involving TCRα, CD3γ, CD3δ, and PLCγ1. Positive selection results from a low, sustained level of ERK activation, whereas negative selection occurs in response to a large burst of ERK activation concomitant with JNK and p38 activation (1Starr T.K. Jameson S.C. Hogquist K.A. Positive and negative selection of T cells.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). Substantial evidence shows that nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and its inhibitors (IκB) are involved in the T cell maturation (7Jacobs M.D. Harrison S.C. Structure of an IκBα/NF-κB complex.Cell. 1998; 95: 749-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). IκBα induces a limited number of double-positive CD4+ CD8+ cells (8Bakker T.R. Renno T. Jongeneel C.V. Impaired fetal thymocyte development after efficient adenovirus-mediated inhibition of NF-κB activation.J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3456-3462PubMed Google Scholar). Transgenic mice expressing a superinhibitory form of IκBα (IκBαΔ32/36) have an increased number of CD4+ CD8+ double-positive cells but decreased number of CD4+ or CD8+ single-positive cells (9Hettmann T. Leiden J.M. NF-κB is required for the positive selection of CD8+ thymocytes.J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5004-5010Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A low level of calcium ionophore A23187 and 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), designated IoP hereafter, is known to induce the differentiation of mononuclear cells, human T-lymphoblastic cell lines HPB-ALL and MOLT-3, and normal lymphocytes (10Iwata M. Kuwata T. Mukai M. Tozawa Y. Yokoyama M. Differential induction of helper and killer T cells from isolated CD4+CD8+ thymocytes in suspension culture.Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2081-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Indeed, IoP replaces TCR signals to induce positive selection of CD4+ T cells (11Takahama Y. Nakauchi H. Phorbol ester and calcium ionophore can replace TCR signals that induce positive selection of CD4 T cells.J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1508-1513PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, PMA induces apoptosis of T cells at micromolar concentrations (12Lin H.P. Chang J.Y. Lin S.R. Lee M.H. Huang S.S. Hsu L.J. Chang N.S.

The upstream signal preceding the aforementioned MAPK/NF-κB pathway is largely unknown during T cell differentiation. Here, we investigated whether tumor suppressor WW domain-containing oxidoreductase, known as WWOX, FOR, or WOX1, participates in the early signaling of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) maturation. WWOX plays a crucial role in tumor suppression, metabolism, ataxia, epilepsy, neural disorders, neuronal damages and degeneration, and anti-viral immune responses (13Chang N.S. Hsu L.J. Lin Y.S.

Here, we showed that WWOX binds IκBα and ERK and the complex localizes, in part, in the mitochondria of immature T lymphoid cells. IoP rapidly induces IκBα and ERK phosphorylation to cause dissociation of the IκBα·ERK·WWOX complex that ultimately leads to nuclear localization of WWOX and ERK.

MOLT-4 cells were transiently overexpressed with ECFP-IκBα (or other indicated constructs) and EYFP-WWOX expression constructs and cultured for 24–36 h. FRET analysis was performed using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE-2000U). Cells were stimulated with an excitation wavelength 440 nm. FRET signals were detected at an emission wavelength 535 nm. ECFP and EYFP were used as donor and acceptor fluorescent molecules, respectively. The FRET images were corrected for background fluorescence from an area without cells and spectral bleed-through. The spectrally corrected FRET concentration (FRETc) was calculated by Youvan's equation (using a software program Image Pro 6.1, Media Cybernetics): FRETc = (fret − bk[fret] − cf[don] × (don − bk[don] − cf[acc] × (acc-bk[acc]), where fret = fret image, bk = background, cf = correction factor, don = donor image, and acc = acceptor image.

MOLT-4 is considered less differentiated than Jurkat. We have shown that Jurkat expresses CD3, but MOLT-4 does not (12Lin H.P. Chang J.Y. Lin S.R. Lee M.H. Huang S.S. Hsu L.J. Chang N.S.

When MOLT-4 and Jurkat cells were exposed to IoP for 15 h, expression of CD3 was significantly increased in whole cell lysates in MOLT-4, but not in Jurkat, 15–24 h post stimulation (Fig. 1, A and B). CD3 is a differentiation marker of T cell whose subunits accumulate in the intracellular compartments of immature thymocytes (2Koch U. Radtke F.

However, CD3 is on the cell surface of mature cells. IoP significantly increased membrane localization of CD3 in both non-permeabilized MOLT-4 and Jurkat cells after stimulation for 15–24 h as determined by flow cytometry (Fig. 1, C and D), suggesting that cells have reached maturation. 15 h post stimulation, IoP promoted MOLT-4 to enter the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle, as determined by flow cytometry (Fig. 1E). Also, this is supported by up-regulation and nuclear accumulation of G2/M-specific cyclin B in the IoP-treated MOLT-4 (Fig. 1F).

IoP increased ERK phosphorylation at Thr-202 and Tyr-204 in MOLT-4 in 5 min or less, and the phosphorylation lasted for 5 h and was then reduced to a basal level of phosphorylation or non-phosphorylated in 15–24 h (Fig. 2, A and B). To block MEK/ERK signaling, MOLT-4 cells were pretreated with U0126, a MEK inhibitor, and then exposed to IoP for 24 h. Again, IoP induced CD3 and CD8 expression and ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 2, C and D). U0126 significantly suppressed ERK and WWOX phosphorylation and abolished CD3 and CD8 expression (Fig. 2, C and D). In comparison, human monocytic U937 and THP-1 cells were exposed to IoP. ERK was rapidly phosphorylated in <5 min in both cells (Fig. 2, E and F).

https://openalex.org/W2462184723,"This study investigates adaptation of ST406, a prevalent P. aeruginosa clone, present in 15% of chronically infected cystic fibrosis (CF) patients in the Netherlands, in a newly infected CF patient during three years using whole genome sequencing (WGS), transcriptomics, and phenotypic assays, including biofilm formation. WGS-based phylogeny demonstrates that ST406 is genetically distinct from other reported CF related strains or epidemic clones. Comparative genomic analysis of the early (S1) and late (S2) isolate yielded 42 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 10 indels and a single 7 kb genomic fragment only found in S2. Most SNPs and differentially expressed genes encoded proteins involved in metabolism, secretion and signal transduction or transcription. SNPs were identified in regulator genes mexT and exsA and coincided with differential gene expression of mexE and mexF, encoding the MexE/F efflux pump, genes encoding the type six secretion system (T6SS) and type three secretion system (T3SS), which have also been previously implicated in adaptation of other P. aeruginosa strains during chronic infection of CF lungs. The observation that genetically different strains from different patients have accumulated similar genetic adaptations supports the concept of adaptive parallel evolution of P. aeruginosa in chronically infected CF patients. Phenotypically, there was loss of biofilm maturation coinciding with a significant lower level of transcription of both bfmR and bfmS during chronic colonization. These data suggest that the high-prevalent Dutch CF clone ST406 displays adaptation to the CF lung niche, which involves a limited number of mutations affecting regulators controlling biofilm formation and secretion and genes involved in metabolism. These genes could provide good targets for anti-pseudomonal therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2469447787,"Myotendinous junctions (MTJs) are anatomical regions specialized in transmission of contractile strength from muscle to tendon and, for this reason, a common site where acute injuries occur during sport activities. In this work we investigated the influence of exercise intensity on MTJ plasticity, as well as on the expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) and their receptors in muscle and tendon. Three groups of rats were analyzed: control (CTRL), slow-runner (RUN-S) and fast-runner (RUN-F) trained using a treadmill. Ultrastructural and morphometric analyses of distal MTJs from extensor digitorum longus muscles have been performed. Contractile strength and hypertrophy were investigated by using in vivo tension recordings and muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) analysis, respectively. mRNA levels of PGC-1α, vinculin, IGF-1Ea and TGF-β have been quantified in muscle belly, while IGF-1Ea, TGF-β and their receptors in tendon. Morphometry revealed an increased MTJ complexity and interaction surface between tissues in trained rats according to training intensity. CSA analysis excluded hypertrophy among groups, while muscle strength was found significantly enhanced in exercised rats in comparison to controls. In muscle tissue, we highlighted an increased mRNA expression of PGC-1α and vinculin in both trained conditions and of TGF-β in RUN-F. In tendon, we mainly noted an enhancement of TGF-β mRNA expression only in RUN-F group and a raise of Betaglycan tendon receptor mRNA levels proportional to exercise intensity. In conclusion, MTJ plasticity appears to be related to exercise intensity and molecular analysis suggests a major role played by TGF-β."
https://openalex.org/W2468913168,"Small molecule effectors regulate gene transcription in bacteria by altering the DNA-binding affinities of specific repressor proteins. Although the GntR proteins represent a large family of bacterial repressors, only little is known about the allosteric mechanism that enables their function. DasR from Streptomyces coelicolor belongs to the GntR/HutC subfamily and specifically recognises operators termed DasR-responsive elements (dre-sites). Its DNA-binding properties are modulated by phosphorylated sugars. Here, we present several crystal structures of DasR, namely of dimeric full-length DasR in the absence of any effector and of only the effector-binding domain (EBD) of DasR without effector or in complex with glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN-6-P) and N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcNAc-6-P). Together with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and a comparison with other GntR/HutC family members these data allowed for a structural characterisation of the different functional states of DasR. Allostery in DasR and possibly in many other GntR/HutC family members is best described by a conformational selection model. In ligand-free DasR, an increased flexibility in the EBDs enables the attached DNA-binding domains (DBD) to sample a variety of different orientations and among these also a DNA-binding competent conformation. Effector binding to the EBDs of DasR significantly reorganises the atomic structure of the latter. However, rather than locking the orientation of the DBDs, the effector-induced formation of β-strand β* in the DBD-EBD-linker segment merely appears to take the DBDs ‘on a shorter leash’ thereby impeding the ‘downwards’ positioning of the DBDs that is necessary for a concerted binding of two DBDs of DasR to operator DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2464420150,"Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an important neurotransmitter hydrolase in both invertebrates and vertebrates, is targeted by organophosphorus and carbamate insecticides. In this study, two new AChEs were identified in the pond wolf spider Pardosa pseudoannulata, an important predatory natural enemy of several insect pests. In total, four AChEs were found in P. pseudoannulata (including two AChEs previously identified in our laboratory). The new putative AChEs PpAChE3 and PpAChE4 contain most of the common features of the AChE family, including cysteine residues, choline binding sites, the conserved sequence ‘FGESAG’ and conserved aromatic residues but with a catalytic triad of ‘SDH’ rather than ‘SEH’. Recombinant enzymes expressed in Sf9 cells showed significant differences in biochemical properties compared to other AChEs, such as the optimal pH, substrate specificity, and catalytic efficiency. Among three test substrates, PpAChE1, PpAChE3 and PpAChE4 showed the highest catalytic efficiency (Vmax/KM) for ATC (acetylthiocholine iodide), with PpAChE3 exhibiting a clear preference for ATC based on the VmaxATC/VmaxBTC ratio. In addition, the four PpAChEs were more sensitive to the AChE-specific inhibitor BW284C51, which acts against ATC hydrolysis, than to the BChE-specific inhibitor ISO-OMPA, which acts against BTC hydrolysis, with at least a 8.5-fold difference in IC50 values for each PpAChE. PpAChE3, PpAChE4, and PpAChE1 were more sensitive than PpAChE2 to the tested Carb insecticides, and PpAChE3 was more sensitive than the other three AChEs to the tested OP insecticides. Based on all the results, two new functional AChEs were identified from P. pseudoannulata. The differences in AChE sequence between this spider and insects enrich our knowledge of invertebrate AChE diversity, and our findings will be helpful for understanding the selectivity of insecticides between insects and natural enemy spiders."
https://openalex.org/W2466711688,"The potential clinical applications of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are limited by genetic and epigenetic variations among hiPSC lines and the question of their equivalency with human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We used MethylScreen technology to determine the DNA methylation profile of pluripotency and differentiation markers in hiPSC lines from different source cell types compared to hESCs and hiPSC source cells. After derivation, hiPSC lines compromised a heterogeneous population characterized by variable levels of aberrant DNA methylation. These aberrations were induced during somatic cell reprogramming and their levels were associated with the type of hiPSC source cells. hiPSC population heterogeneity was reduced during prolonged culture and hiPSCs acquired an hESC-like methylation profile. In contrast, the expression of differentiation marker genes in hiPSC lines remained distinguishable from that in hESCs. Taken together, in vitro culture facilitates hiPSC acquisition of hESC epigenetic characteristics. However, differences remain between both pluripotent stem cell types, which must be considered before their use in downstream applications."
https://openalex.org/W2408964212,"Amino acids are important sources of soil organic nitrogen (N), which is essential for plant nutrition, but detailed information about which amino acids predominant and whether amino acid composition varies with elevation is lacking. In this study, we hypothesized that the concentrations of amino acids in soil would increase and their composition would vary along the elevational gradient of Taibai Mountain, as plant-derived organic matter accumulated and N mineralization and microbial immobilization of amino acids slowed with reduced soil temperature. Results showed that the concentrations of soil extractable total N, extractable organic N and amino acids significantly increased with elevation due to the accumulation of soil organic matter and the greater N content. Soil extractable organic N concentration was significantly greater than that of the extractable inorganic N (NO3--N + NH4+-N). On average, soil adsorbed amino acid concentration was approximately 5-fold greater than that of the free amino acids, which indicates that adsorbed amino acids extracted with the strong salt solution likely represent a potential source for the replenishment of free amino acids. We found no appreciable evidence to suggest that amino acids with simple molecular structure were dominant at low elevations, whereas amino acids with high molecular weight and complex aromatic structure dominated the high elevations. Across the elevational gradient, the amino acid pool was dominated by alanine, aspartic acid, glycine, glutamic acid, histidine, serine and threonine. These seven amino acids accounted for approximately 68.9% of the total hydrolyzable amino acid pool. The proportions of isoleucine, tyrosine and methionine varied with elevation, while soil major amino acid composition (including alanine, arginine, aspartic acid, glycine, histidine, leucine, phenylalanine, serine, threonine and valine) did not vary appreciably with elevation (p>0.10). The compositional similarity of many amino acids across the elevational gradient suggests that soil amino acids likely originate from a common source or through similar biochemical processes."
https://openalex.org/W2472985225,"Introduction Emphysema and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) present either per se or coexist in combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (CPFE). Serum surfactant proteins (SPs) A, B, C and D levels may reflect lung damage. We evaluated serum SP levels in healthy controls, emphysema, IPF, and CPFE patients and their associations to disease severity and survival. Methods 122 consecutive patients (31 emphysema, 62 IPF, and 29 CPFE) and 25 healthy controls underwent PFTs, ABG-measurements, 6MWT and chest HRCT. Serum levels of SPs were measured. Patients were followed-up for 1-year. Results SP-A and SP-D levels differed between groups (p = 0.006 and p<0.001 respectively). In post-hoc analysis, SP-A levels differed only between controls and CPFE (p<0.05) and CPFE and emphysema (p<0.05). SP-D differed between controls and IPF or CPFE (p<0.001 for both comparisons). In IPF SP-B correlated to pulmonary function while SP-A, correlated to the Composite Physiological Index (CPI). Controls current smokers had higher SP-A and SP-D levels compared to non-smokers (p = 0.026 and p = 0.023 respectively). SP-D levels were higher in CPFE patients with extended emphysema (p = 0.042). In patients with IPF, SP-B levels at the upper quartile of its range (≥26 ng/mL) presented a weak association with reduced survival (p = 0.05). Conclusion In conclusion, serum SP-A and SP-D levels were higher where fibrosis exists or coexists and related to disease severity, suggesting that serum SPs relate to alveolar damage in fibrotic lungs and may reflect either local overproduction or overleakage. The weak association between high levels of SP-B and survival needs further validation in clinical trials."

Alcohols inactivate norovirus by destruction of the viral capsid, resulting in the leakage of viral RNA (virolysis). Since conflicting results have been reported on the susceptibility of human noroviruses against alcohols, we exposed a panel of 30 human norovirus strains (14 GI and 16 GII strains) to different concentrations (50%, 70%, 90%) of ethanol and isopropanol and tested the viral RNA titer by RT-qPCR. Viral RNA titers of 10 (71.4%), 14 (100%), 3 (21.4%) and 7 (50%) of the 14 GI strains were reduced by > 1 log10 RNA copies/ml after exposure to 70% and 90% ethanol, and 70% and 90% isopropanol, respectively. RNA titers of 6 of the 7 non-GII 4 strains remained unaffected after alcohol exposure. Compared to GII strains, GI strains were more susceptible to ethanol than to isopropanol. At 90%, both alcohols reduced RNA titers of 8 of the 9 GII.4 strains by ≥ 1 log10 RNA copies/ml. After exposure to 70% ethanol, RNA titers of GII.4 Den Haag and Sydney strains decreased by ≥ 1.9 log10, whereas RNA reductions for GII.4 New Orleans strains were < 0.5 log10. To explain these differences, we sequenced the complete capsid gene of the 9 GII.4 strains and identified 17 amino acid substitutions in the P2 region among the 3 GII.4 variant viruses. When comparing with an additional set of 200 GII.4 VP1 sequences, only S310 and P396 were present in all GII.4 New Orleans viruses but not in the ethanol-sensitive GII.4 Sydney and GII.4 Den Haag viruses Our data demonstrate that alcohol susceptibility patterns between different norovirus genotypes vary widely and that virolysis data for a single strain or genotype are not representative for all noroviruses."

Sugar-coated sperm: Unraveling the functions of the mammalian sperm glycocalyx.Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2015; 82: 635-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Recent data revealed that, during capacitation, a biochemical process in the female reproductive tract in which spermatozoa accomplish full fertilizing “capacity,” two sialidases (the neuraminidases NEU1 and NEU3) are shed from the surface of spermatozoa, likely by the activity of proteases, which could be efficiently counteracted by protease inhibitors (10Ma F.

The acrosome appears to contain a further reservoir of sialidases, which are released physiologically during the acrosome reaction prior to fertilization (8Srivastava P.N. Zaneveld L.J. Williams W.L.

Because NEU1 and NEU3 together are able to desialylate several different glycoconjugates (α2,3-, α2,6-, and α2,8-sialylated), a significant restructuring of the glycocalyx can be expected (13Sajo M.

Sialic acids are acidic nine-carbon backbone α-keto sugars and represent one of the most important molecules of life (16Angata T. Varki A.

N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) as well as N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) are the most abundant species in mammals. These sugar residues are commonly linked to the outermost position of the largest share of glycoproteins, which places them in an ideal position for their indispensable role in a diverse range of cellular processes such as intercellular adhesion and communication. However, sialic acids also play an important role during infection of many viruses, fungi, as well as bacteria (18Schauer R. Sialic acids: fascinating sugars in higher animals and man.Zoology. 2004; 107: 49-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 19Schauer R.

Multifarious roles of sialic acids in immunity.Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2012; 1253: 16-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). For instance, during invasion, pathogenic bacteria use sialic acid residues on the surface of epithelial cells for the initiation of infection by mediating bacterial adherence. On the other hand, detachment of sialic acid residues from host cells represents a further powerful means of bacteria to manipulate the immune response, e.g. by influencing the recognition of specific sugar moieties by sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-type lectins (siglecs) on immune cells (21Lewis A.L.

Siglec-mediated regulation of immune cell function in disease.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14: 653-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). For example, several pathogenic bacteria secrete sialidases as a virulence factor, leading to sepsis as a consequence of an uncontrolled stimulation of the immune system. In this regard, bacterial sialidase inhibitors can efficiently counteract the dramatic progression of the disease in a mouse model, demonstrating their clinical potential during infection (23Paulson J.C.

Biotechnol. 2011; 29: 428-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In consideration that UPEC infection of the epididymis results in a premature release of acrosomal content (5Lang T. Dechant M. Sanchez V. Wistuba J. Boiani M. Pilatz A. Stammler A. Middendorff R. Schuler G. Bhushan S. Tchatalbachev S. Wübbeling F. Burger M. Chakraborty T. Mallidis C. Meinhardt A. Structural and functional integrity of spermatozoa is compromised as a consequence of acute uropathogenic E. coli-associated epididymitis.Biol. Reprod. 2013; 89: 59Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we aimed to investigate whether this affects the sialome of spermatozoa and surrounding epididymal epithelial cells using a mouse epididymitis model and ejaculates of men with a recent history of the disease. To elucidate whether the UPEC-induced acrosome reaction leads to an activation of endogenous sialidases, initiating a subsequent desialylation of spermatozoa, an established epididymitis mouse model was utilized (25Lang T. Hudemann C. Tchatalbachev S. Stammler A. Michel V. Aslani F. Bhushan S. Chakraborty T. Renz H. Meinhardt A. Uropathogenic Escherichia coli modulates innate immunity to suppress Th1-mediated inflammatory responses during infectious epididymitis.Infect. Immun. 2014; 82: 1104-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Histopathology in Masson-Goldner-stained epididymis demonstrated fibrotic remodeling and interstitial leukocytic infiltration as the most obvious consequences 3 days post-UPEC infection, as shown previously (Fig. 1A) (4Stammler A. Hau T. Bhushan S. Meinhardt A. Jonigk D. Lippmann T. Pilatz A. Schneider-Hüther I. Middendorff R. Epididymitis: ascending infection restricted by segmental boundaries.Hum.

Acrosomal staining with FITC-labeled peanut agglutinin lectin indicated a premature acrosome reaction in the majority of spermatozoa in the lumen of the epididymis following UPEC infection (Fig. 1B), similar to previous findings (5Lang T. Dechant M. Sanchez V. Wistuba J. Boiani M. Pilatz A. Stammler A. Middendorff R. Schuler G. Bhushan S. Tchatalbachev S. Wübbeling F. Burger M. Chakraborty T. Mallidis C. Meinhardt A. Structural and functional integrity of spermatozoa is compromised as a consequence of acute uropathogenic E. coli-associated epididymitis.Biol. Reprod. 2013; 89: 59Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In contrast, the acrosome was visible in most spermatozoa in untreated and sham controls. To gain a first insight into the sialylation status, sialic acid residues were visualized on epididymal sections using FITC-conjugated SNA lectin (Fig. 2). SNA prevalently binds α2,6-linked sialic acid residues; however, α2,3-linked sialic acid residues will also be bound by this lectin but to a lesser degree. Fluorescence microscopy revealed diffusely distributed and weaker SNA labeling in spermatozoa of UPEC-infected mice, whereas in controls, prominent staining of sialic acid residues was evident in the acrosome and sperm tail (Fig. 2). The reduced SNA staining in UPEC-treated mice suggested that Neu5Ac residues were cleaved during infection. Because qualitative as well as quantitative lectin analyses of sialic acids are often misleading, and SNA lectin visualize only a proportion of all sialic acid residues on glycoconjugates (27Galuska S.P. Sialobiology: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function.in: Tiralongo J. Martinez-Duncker I. Betham eBooks, 2013: 448-475Google Scholar), a recently developed combination of LCMD and DMB-HPLC-ESI-MS analyses was applied (Fig. 3) (28Bartel J. Feuerstacke C. Galuska C.E. Weinhold B. Gerardy-Schahn R. Geyer R. Münster-Kühnel A. Middendorff R. Galuska S.P. Laser microdissection of paraffin embedded tissue as a tool to estimate the sialylation status of selected cell populations.Anal. Chem. 2014; 86: 2326-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Starting from murine paraffin-embedded tissue samples, epididymal spermatozoa were isolated via LCMD after nuclear staining using Mayer's hematoxylin (Fig. 3, A and B). Thereafter, sialic acids were released under acidic conditions, fluorescently labeled, and subjected to a HPLC-ESI-MS system. The obtained chromatograms showed smaller peaks of DMB-labeled Neu5Ac in infected material (Fig. 3C). The respective DMB-Neu5Ac mass at m/z 448 [M + Na]+ in the ESI-MS spectrum verified the presence of DMB-Neu5Ac during the corresponding retention time of an DMB-Neu5Ac standard (Fig. 3C). Calculation of corresponding peak areas demonstrated a significant reduction of Neu5Ac (∼19%) in spermatozoa in UPEC epididymitis (Fig. 3D). Although, in UPEC-treated samples, a peak for DMB-Neu5Gc was apparent in the HPLC chromatogram, in the sham control, hardly any signal was detectable. However, no mass corresponding to DMB-Neu5Gc was obtained by ESI-MS in untreated as well as infected mice (data not shown). Because of the fact that DMB reacts with all α-keto acids, possible contamination in infected mice by α-keto acids originating from the pathogen was examined by separate analysis of bacteria only. In UPEC, the presence of DMB-labeled KDO, a well known bacterial α-keto acid (16Angata T. Varki A. Chemical diversity in the sialic acids and related α-keto acids: an evolutionary perspective.Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 439-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar), was measurable as a prominent peak at the retention time of DMB-Neu5Gc (Fig. 4A). In addition, KDO-related monoisotopic pseudomolecular masses of DMB-KDO at m/z 337 ([M + H]+ − H2O), 355 ([M + H]+), and 377 ([M + Na]+) were monitored in the ESI-MS spectrum at this particular time (Fig. 4B). To verify this finding, KDO was applied to the DMB-HPLC analysis, demonstrating that Neu5Gc and KDO show overlapping peak areas (Fig. 4C). Thus, in UPEC-treated mice, bacterial KDO was obviously recorded at the retention time of DMB-Neu5Gc. Release of sialic acids from the spermatozoa to the luminal fluid following UPEC infection could be enzymatically mediated by soluble sialidases, a hypothesis supported by an observation of Gagneux and co-workers (10Ma F. Wu D. Deng L. Secrest P. Zhao J. Varki N. Lindheim S. Gagneux P. Sialidases on mammalian sperm mediate deciduous sialylation during capacitation.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 38073-38079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), who described that the sialidases NEU1 and NEU3 are released from the cell surface of spermatozoa after proteolytic activation. Consequently, soluble neuraminidases would be also able to reach the cell surface of surrounding cells. To test this hypothesis, the sialylation status of epididymal epithelial cells (whose apical surface borders on the luminal fluid) was analyzed using the abovementioned combined LCMD/DMB-HPLC-ESI-MS strategy (Fig. 5). In support, epididymal epithelial cells showed a reduction of sialic acid residues (∼49%) 3 days post-infection with UPEC (Fig. 5, C and D). Reduction of Neu5Ac from epithelial cells is substantially stronger in comparison with spermatozoa (Fig. 3). Thus, the obtained results demonstrate that the sialylation status of epididymal spermatozoa in the lumen as well as that of the lumen lining epithelial cells decreases in the epididymis after bacterial infection. To investigate whether UPEC can also induce hyposialylation in human spermatozoa, motile spermatozoa of healthy donors collected after swim-up were subsequently infected with UPEC (Fig. 6). DMB-HPLC analysis pointed to a reduction of Neu5Ac to approximately half the amount measured in an untreated control (Fig. 6A). Correspondingly, PSA-FITC lectin staining detected a substantially higher number of acrosomally reacted spermatozoa compared with controls (Fig. 6B). To examine whether the investigated hyposialylation of spermatozoa is mostly the consequence of a general loss of glycoconjugates, e.g. because of the degradation of the glycoprotein backbone or the activation of neuraminidases during the acrosome reaction, motile human spermatozoa were treated with UPEC in the presence of the sialidase inhibitor DANA (Fig. 6A). Here, co-incubation of DANA with UPEC completely prevented hyposialylation of human spermatozoa (Fig. 6A). Bacterial sialidase activity could be excluded by in silico analysis of the UPEC genome. Consequently, the decreased sialylation status in infected spermatozoa is likely based on the enzymatic activity of released sialidases. In addition, semen samples of patients suffering from E. coli epididymitis were included in our study. For this purpose, spermatozoa were obtained by swim-up from ejaculates of men 14 days after diagnosis and treatment of E. coli-based unilateral epididymitis. The analyzed samples showed malformation (sperm head, acrosome visualized by PSA-FITC staining, Fig. 7A) and much lower levels of Neu5Ac (∼75% reduction) compared with healthy control spermatozoa (Fig. 7B). Thus, in agreement with the determined loss of sialic acid residues in the epididymitis mouse model as well as in the in vitro experiments, spermatozoa of epididymitis patients are hyposialylated. Glycans play an essential role in fertilization, particularly in mediating the species-specific interaction between spermatozoa and the zona pellucida of the egg (9Pang P.C. Chiu P.C. Lee C.L. Chang L.Y. Panico M. Morris H.R. Haslam S.M. Khoo K.H. Clark G.F. Yeung W.S. Dell A.

Binding of spermatozoa to the zona pellucida is thereby strongly induced by terminal Neu5Ac residues of sialyl-LewisX oligosaccharides on the surface of the zona pellucida. In addition, successful interaction of both gametes requires previous desialylation of the spermatozoal surface (10Ma F. Wu D. Deng L. Secrest P. Zhao J. Varki N. Lindheim S. Gagneux P.

For this purpose, spermatozoa are equipped with sialidases (8Srivastava P.N. Zaneveld L.J. Williams W.L. Mammalian sperm acrosomal neuraminidases.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Premature release of neuraminidases prior ejaculation is usually avoided, as untimely desialylation could result in elimination of spermatozoa by phagocytic cells (30Toshimori K. Araki S. Oura C. Eddy E.M. Loss of sperm surface sialic acid induces phagocytosis: an assay with a monoclonal antibody T21, which recognizes a 54K sialoglycoprotein.Arch. Androl. 1991; 27: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Under pathophysiological conditions such as bacterial epididymitis, considerable premature exocytosis of the acrosome has been observed in vivo and in vitro, which contributes substantially to the loss of fertilizing capacity, as shown by subsequent in vitro fertilization experiments in mice (5Lang T. Dechant M. Sanchez V. Wistuba J. Boiani M. Pilatz A. Stammler A. Middendorff R. Schuler G. Bhushan S. Tchatalbachev S. Wübbeling F. Burger M. Chakraborty T. Mallidis C. Meinhardt A. Structural and functional integrity of spermatozoa is compromised as a consequence of acute uropathogenic E. coli-associated epididymitis.Biol. Reprod. 2013; 89: 59Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This prompted us to examine whether an undue acrosome reaction could affect the sialome of epididymal spermatozoa and surrounding epithelial cells by applying an established acute mouse bacterial infectious epididymitis model and ejaculates of men with a recent history of the disease. Both in murine epididymitis as well as in in vitro-treated human spermatozoa, UPEC stimulates a premature acrosome reaction, leading to a significant desialylation of spermatozoa as well as adjacent cells (illustrated in Fig. 8). Surprisingly, the investigated desialylation was much more pronounced in epididymitis patients. The desialylation could be efficiently blocked with a neuraminidase inhibitor in vitro, indicating that the loss of sialic acid residues is particularly a consequence of endogenous neuraminidases (Fig. 8). A limitation in the analysis of human samples in this study is the relatively small number of semen samples from patients/controls suitable for glycoanalysis because of the need to clean ejaculates by the swim-up method. Because semen samples of patients with acute epididymitis are usually characterized by a largely reduced semen quality and leukocytospermia, the swim-up technique was employed to select the viable and motile sperm, thereby removing contaminating non-sperm cells (e.g. leukocytes) to avoid bias between patient and control samples. Because sialic acids have multifactorial roles in the host response to infection, the massive release of sialic acid residues from the cell surface of epithelial cells and spermatozoa may contribute to the observed tissue damage in epididymitis (Fig. 8). This view is supported by the fact that bacterial lipopolysaccharide triggers complement activation and that hyposialylation promotes the perforation of host cell membranes by the membrane attack complex by counteracting a protective mechanism conveyed by complement factor H (31Pangburn M.K. Müller-Eberhard H.J. Complement C3 convertase: cell surface restriction of β1H control and generation of restriction on neuraminidase-treated cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1978; 75: 2416-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Complement factor H exhibits sialic acid-specific binding domains that are necessary for efficient cell surface binding (32Blaum B.S. Hannan J.P. Herbert A.P. Kavanagh D. Uhrín D. Stehle T. Structural basis for sialic acid-mediated self-recognition by complement factor H.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2015; 11: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Factor H on cell membranes is essential to remove activated complement factor 3b from cellular surfaces to prevent perforation of host cell membranes and limit tissue damage. As shown recently, complement factor H is an important component of seminal plasma, as it protects spermatozoa against such a complement attack in the female reproductive tract (33Sakaue T. Takeuchi K. Maeda T. Yamamoto Y. Nishi K. Ohkubo I. Factor H in porcine seminal plasma protects sperm against complement attack in genital tracts.J. Biol."

The HbPR-1 cDNA was 647 bp long and contained an open reading frame of 492 nucleotides encoding 163 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 17,681 Da and an isoelectric point (pI) of 8.56, demonstrating that HbPR-1 protein belongs to the basic PR-1 type. The predicted 3D structure of HbPR-1 was composed of four α-helices, three β-sheets, seven strands, and one junction loop. Expression and purification of recombinant HbPR-1 protein were successful using Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression and one-step of affinity chromatography. Heterologous expression of HbPR-1 in N. benthamiana reduced necrosis areas which were inoculated with P. palmivora zoospores, indicating that the expressed HbPR-1 protein played an important role in plant resistance to pathogens. The purified recombinant HbPR-1 protein was found to inhibit 64% of P. palmivora zoospore germination on a water agar plate compared with control, suggesting that it was an antimicrobial protein against P. palmivora."
https://openalex.org/W2464479141,"Understanding cellular and molecular mechanisms induced by hypoxic stress is crucial to reduce blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption in some neurological diseases. Since the brain is a complex organ, it makes the interpretation of in vivo data difficult, so BBB studies are often investigated using in vitro models. However, the investigation of hypoxia in cellular pathways is complex with physical hypoxia because HIF-1α (factor induced by hypoxia) has a short half-life. We had set up an innovative and original method of induction of hypoxic stress by hydralazine that was more reproducible, which allowed us to study its impact on an in vitro BBB model. Our results showed that hydralazine, a mimetic agent of the hypoxia pathway, had the same effect as physical hypoxia, with few cytotoxicity effects on our cells. Hypoxic stress led to an increase of BBB permeability which corresponded to an opening of our BBB model. Study of tight junction proteins revealed that this hypoxic stress decreased ZO-1 but not occludin expression. In contrast, cells established a defence mechanism by increasing expression and activity of their efflux transporters (Pgp and MRP-1). This induction method of hypoxic stress by hydralazine is simple, reproducible, controllable and suitable to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved by hypoxia on the BBB."
https://openalex.org/W2460578852,"Rapid development of information and communications technologies (ICT) has triggered profound changes in how people manage their social contacts in both informal and professional contexts. ICT mediated communication may seem limited in possibilities compared to face-to-face encounters, but research shows that puzzlingly often it can be just as effective and satisfactory. We posit that ICT users employ specific communication strategies adapted to particular communication channels, which results in a comparable effectiveness of communication. In order to maintain a satisfactory level of conversational intelligibility they calibrate the content of their messages to a given medium’s richness and adjust the whole conversation trajectory so that every stage of the communication process runs fluently. In the current study, we compared complex task solving trajectories in chat, mobile phone and face-to-face dyadic conversations. Media conditions did not influence the quality of decision outcomes or users’ perceptions of the interaction, but they had impact on the amount of time devoted to each of the identified phases of decision development. In face-to-face contacts the evaluation stage of the discussion dominated the conversation; in the texting condition the orientation-evaluation-control phases were evenly distributed; and the phone condition provided a midpoint between these two extremes. The results show that contemporary ICT users adjust their communication behavior to the limitations and opportunities of various media through the regulation of attention directed to each stage of the discussion so that as a whole the communication process remains effective."
https://openalex.org/W2469932272,"Complex diseases seriously threaten human health. Drug discovery approaches based on ""single genes, single drugs, and single targets"" are limited in targeting complex diseases. The development of new multicomponent drugs for complex diseases is imperative, and the establishment of a suitable solution for drug group-target protein network analysis is a key scientific problem that must be addressed. Herbal medicines have formed the basis of sophisticated systems of traditional medicine and have given rise to some key drugs that remain in use today. The search for new molecules is currently taking a different route, whereby scientific principles of ethnobotany and ethnopharmacognosy are being used by chemists in the discovery of different sources and classes of compounds.In this study, we developed TarNet, a manually curated database and platform of traditional medicinal plants with natural compounds that includes potential bio-target information. We gathered information on proteins that are related to or affected by medicinal plant ingredients and data on protein-protein interactions (PPIs). TarNet includes in-depth information on both plant-compound-protein relationships and PPIs. Additionally, TarNet can provide researchers with network construction analyses of biological pathways and protein-protein interactions (PPIs) associated with specific diseases. Researchers can upload a gene or protein list mapped to our PPI database that has been manually curated to generate relevant networks. Multiple functions are accessible for network topological calculations, subnetwork analyses, pathway analyses, and compound-protein relationships.TarNet will serve as a useful analytical tool that will provide information on medicinal plant compound-affected proteins (potential targets) and system-level analyses for systems biology and network pharmacology researchers. TarNet is freely available at http://www.herbbol.org:8001/tarnet, and detailed tutorials on the program are also available."
https://openalex.org/W2462726515,"Background The neurotransmitter pathways in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and urinary stone attacks are both related to serotonin, and each disease may be influenced by viscero-visceral hyperalgesia. However, the relationship between urinary tract stone disease and IBS has never been addressed. We aimed to investigate the risk of suffering new-onset IBS after an initial urinary stone attack using a nationwide database. Methods A study group enrolled a total of 13,254 patients who were diagnosed with an initial urinary stone attack; a comparison group recruited 39,762 matched non-urinary stone participants during 2003 and 2007. We followed each patient for 3 years to determine new-onset IBS. We also used Cox proportional hazards models to analyze the risk of IBS between the study and comparison groups after modified by demographics, residence, patient characteristics and personal histories. Results The occurrence rates of IBS were 3.3% (n = 440) and 2.6% (n = 1,034) respectively in the study and comparison groups. A covariate-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of IBS in the study group that was 1.28 times greater (HR = 1.29, 95% CI, 1.15–1.44) than that in the comparison group was showed in the stratified Cox proportional analysis. The adjusted HRs of IBS did not decrease after considering demographics and past histories. The majority of IBS (30.5%) occurred within the first 6 months after the stone attack. Conclusion Patients with an initial urinary stone attack are at increased risk of developing new-onset IBS. The HRs of IBS did not decrease even after adjusting for patient demographics and past histories. Most importantly, 30.5% of IBS occurred within the first 6 months after the urinary stone attack."
https://openalex.org/W2470715616,"The intraneuronal chloride concentration ([Cl-]i) is paramount for determining the polarity of signaling at GABAA synapses in the central nervous system. Sectioning hippocampal brain slices increases [Cl-]i in the superficial layers. It is not known whether cutting trauma also increases [Cl-]i in the neocortex and thalamus, and whether the effects of trauma change during development. We used Cl- imaging to study the [Cl-]i vs. the distance from the cut surface in acute thalamocortical slices from mice at developmental ages ranging from post-natal day 5 (P5) to P20. We demonstrate: 1) [Cl-]i is higher in the most superficial areas in both neocortical and thalamic brain slices at all ages tested and, 2) there is a developmental decrease in [Cl-]i that is independent of acute trauma caused by brain slicing. We conclude that [Cl-]i has a developmental progression during P5-20 in both the neocortex and thalamus. However, in both brain regions and during development the neurons closest to the slicing trauma have an elevated [Cl-]i."

https://openalex.org/W2467421472,"Translational investigations in cystic fibrosis (CF) have a need for improved quantitative and longitudinal measures of disease status. To establish a non-invasive quantitative MRI technique to monitor lung health in patients with CF and correlate MR metrics with airway physiology as measured by multiple breath washout (MBW). Data were collected in 12 CF patients and 12 healthy controls. Regional (central and peripheral lung) measures of fractional lung water density (FLD: air to 100% fluid) were acquired both at FRC and TLC on a 1.5T MRI. The median FLD (mFLD) and the FRC-to-TLC mFLD ratio were calculated for each region at both lung volumes. Spirometry and MBW data were also acquired for each subject. Ventilation inhomogeneities were quantified by the lung clearance index (LCI) and by indices Scond* and Sacin* that assess inhomogeneities in the conducting (central) and acinar (peripheral) lung regions, respectively. MBW indices and mFLD at TLC (both regions) were significantly elevated in CF (p<0.01) compared to controls. The mFLD at TLC (central: R = 0.82) and the FRC-to-TLC mFLD ratio (peripheral: R = -0.77) were strongly correlated with Scond* and LCI. CF patients had high lung water content at TLC when compared to controls. This is likely due to the presence of retained airway secretions and airway wall edema (more water) and to limited expansions of air trapping areas (less air) in CF subjects. FRC-to-TLC ratios of mFLD strongly correlated with central ventilation inhomogeneities. These combined measures may provide a useful marker of both retained mucus and air trapping in CF lungs."
https://openalex.org/W2466749770,"Privacy-preserving profile matching, a challenging task in mobile social networks, is getting more attention in recent years. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme that is based on ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption to tackle this problem. In our scheme, a user can submit a preference-profile and search for users with matching-profile in decentralized mobile social networks. In this process, no participant’s profile and the submitted preference-profile is exposed. Meanwhile, a secure communication channel can be established between the pair of successfully matched users. In contrast to existing related schemes which are mainly based on the secure multi-party computation, our scheme can provide verifiability (both the initiator and any unmatched user cannot cheat each other to pretend to be matched), and requires few interactions among users. We provide thorough security analysis and performance evaluation on our scheme, and show its advantages in terms of security, efficiency and usability over state-of-the-art schemes."
