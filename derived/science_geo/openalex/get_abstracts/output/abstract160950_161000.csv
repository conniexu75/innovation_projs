To investigate whether or not 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase catalyzes a limiting step in the MEP pathway in plants, we produced transgenic Arabidopsis plants that over- or underexpress this enzyme. Compared with non-transgenic wild-type plants, the transgenic plants accumulate different levels of various isoprenoids such as chlorophylls, tocopherols, carotenoids, abscisic acid, and gibberellins. Phenotypically, the transgenic plants had slight alterations in growth and germination rates. Because the levels of several plastidic isoprenoids correlate with changes in 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase levels, we conclude that this enzyme catalyzes one of the rate-limiting steps of the MEP biosynthetic pathway. Furthermore, since the product of the MEP pathway is isopentenyl diphosphate, our results suggest that in plastids the pool of isopentenyl diphosphate is limiting to isprenoid production.

Members of this diverse group of natural products are found in all organisms. In higher plants, isoprenoids participate in a wide variety of biological functions such as photosynthesis, respiration, growth, cell cycle control, plant defense, and adaptation to environmental conditions. Specific examples include photosynthetic pigments (chlorophylls and carotenoids), hormones (abscisic acid (ABA),1 gibberellins (GA), cytokinins, and brassinosteroids), a side chain of the electron transporter (plastiquinone), structural components of membranes (phytosterols), and antimicrobial agents (phytoalexins). Beyond these plant-specific functions, many plant isoprenoids have been shown to have industrial and medical importance. The plant-produced isoprenoids β-carotene (provitamin A) and α-tocopherol (vitamin E) are both basic nutrients required for the maintenance of human health (1Hirschberg J. Curr. Opin.

Another plant-produced isoprenoid, Taxol, is used as a chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of cancer (5Blagosklonny M.V. Fojo T. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 83: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Moreover, drugs that block isoprenoid production in Plasmodium falciparum are being evaluated as anti-malarial agents (6Jomaa H. Wiesner J. Sanderbrand S. Altincicek B. Weidemeyer C. Hintz M. Türbachova I. Eberl M. Zeidler J. Lichtenthaler H.K. Soldati D. Beck E. Science. 1999; 285: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). Industrial uses of isoprenoids include products such as colorants, fragrances, and flavorings (7Lange B.M. Croteau R. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1999; 2: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A detailed understanding of isoprenoid biosynthetic pathways and their regulation is essential to fully exploit these and future uses of isoprenoids.Isoprenoids are derived by consecutive condensations of five-carbon precursors, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). From these common precursors, the biosynthetic pathways of the various isoprenoids diverge. The work of several groups has demonstrated that in plants two distinct pathways synthesize IPP (Fig. 1). The acetate/mevalonate (MVA) pathway (8Newman J.D. Chappell J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 34: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 9Bach T.J. Boronat A. Campos N. Ferrer A.

Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4500) Google Scholar), occurs in the cytoplasm where sesquiterpenes (C15) and triterpenes (C30) such as sterols are produced (Fig. 1). The more recently identified MEP pathway (named for the first committed molecule in the pathway, 2C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate) occurs in plastids and is also found in protozoa, most bacteria, and algae (6Jomaa H.

This plastidic pathway produces IPP that is used for the biosynthesis of isoprene, monoterpenes (C10), diterpenes (C20), carotenoids, plastiquinones, and phytol conjugates such as chlorophylls and tocopherols (16Schwender J.

Although there is evidence that some limited exchange occurs in plants between the cytoplasmic and plastidic pools of IPP, each pathway appears to produce unique isoprenoids (15Lichtenthaler H.K.

Plant. 1997; 101: 643-652Crossref Google Scholar).Whereas all of the genes involved in the MVA pathway have been identified, only the first genes of the plant MEP pathway have been published (Fig. 1). The first step in the MEP pathway involves a transketolase-type condensation reaction of pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to yield 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP). This reaction is catalyzed by DXP synthase (DXS). Genes encoding DXS have been cloned and characterized in Escherichia coli (20Sprenger G.A. Schörken U. Wiegert T. Grolle S. De Graaf A.A.

In plants, the DXP produced by this reaction is utilized in plastidic IPP biosynthesis as well as in the production of thiamin and pyridoxol (29Julliard J.H. C. R. Acad. Sci. ( Paris ). 1992; 314: 285-290Google Scholar, 30Julliard J.H. Douce R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The subsequent steps of the MEP pathway have been shown to be specific for IPP production, and the genes coding for the next four steps have been identified in both bacteria and plants (Fig. 1). The first step specific for IPP production is the transformation of DXP to MEP by the enzyme DXP reductoisomerase (DXR) (6Jomaa H. Wiesner J. Sanderbrand S. Altincicek B. Weidemeyer C. Hintz M.

MEP is subsequently converted into 2C-methyl-d- erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate by the consecutive activities of three independent enzymes as shown in Fig. 1 (35Rohdich F. Wungsintaweekul J.

The final steps leading to IPP remain unknown.Identifying the different enzymes involved in the synthesis of IPP is only part of the work necessary to characterize such a complex biosynthetic pathway. Another fundamental aspect is the identification of the limiting steps in the pathway. Large changes in the level of a non-limiting enzyme can be made with little or no effect on the quantity of the final product; therefore, one of the most fruitful strategies for altering isoprenoid content will be those that focus on the rate-limiting enzymes (40Kinney A.J. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the case of the MEP pathway, recent studies in bacteria (24Miller B. Heuser T. Zimmer W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 26Kuzuyama T. Takagi M. Takahashi S. Seto H. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 891-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 34Miller B. Heuser T. Zimmer W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 481: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and tomato (25Lois L.M. Rodrı́guez-Concepción M. Gallego F. Campos N. Boronat A. Plant J. 2000; 22: 503-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that DXS is a rate-limiting enzyme.In this article we report on the effects of altering DXS levels, the first gene in plastidic isoprenoid synthesis in plants. Our previous work demonstrated that, in A. thaliana, DXS is encoded by the CLA1 gene (28Estévez J.M. Cantero A. Romero C. Kawaide H. Jiménez L.F. Kuzuyama T. Seto H. Kamiya Y. León P. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In order to explore the participation of DXS in plastidic isoprenoid synthesis in plants, the enzyme levels were increased or decreased in Arabidopsis plants. Analysis of several transgenic lines showed that plants overexpressing DXS had increased levels of isoprenoids such as chlorophylls, tocopherols, carotenoids, ABA, and GA. Moreover, plants with suppressed levels of DXS had decreased amounts of all of these products. The fact that alterations in DXS levels lead to changes of various isoprenoid end products demonstrates that DXS is one of the limiting steps in the production of plastidic IPP and, therefore, of isoprenoids in higher plants. Each group of plastidic isoprenoids has a distinct biosynthetic pathway that could be manipulated; however, our findings indicate that the output of these pathways could be restricted by the amount of IPP that is produced in the plastids.DISCUSSIONBecause isoprenoids are such ubiquitous and essential compounds, there have been intensive efforts to understand the pathways that lead to their production. All isoprenoids are derived from the precursor molecules IPP and DMAPP, which are produced in plants by either the cytoplasmic MVA or plastidic MEP pathways (19Lichtenthaler H.K. Rohmer M. Schwender J. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 101: 643-652Crossref Google Scholar, 59Lange B.M. Rujan T. Martin W. Croteau R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13172-13177Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). There has been substantial progress in the identification of the biosynthetic steps of the MEP pathway in the past few years. However, knowing the reaction steps involved in the MEP pathway is only the first step to fully understanding it. Fundamental aspects that need to be addressed are the regulatory and control points of the pathway. If DXS is a limiting enzyme of the MEP pathway, then altering its level will affect the quantity of IPP. Analogously, if the amount of plastidic IPP is limiting in the production of isoprenoids, alterations in the IPP level will have an effect on overall isoprenoid levels. One way to define experimentally the rate-limiting steps of a biosynthetic pathway is by using reverse genetics to make changes in specific sites of the pathway and then monitoring the corresponding changes in the end products (60Furbank R.T. Taylor W.C. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 797-807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The experiments described in this article were designed to determine whether the first enzyme in the MEP pathway, DXS, is a limiting part of the production of plastidic IPP. Additionally, if DXS is limiting, we wanted to evaluate the effects of altering its level on seed germination, plant growth, and isoprenoid abundance.The general finding for three divergent isoprenoid pathways is that by raising the level of DXS, the levels of isoprenoids are raised, and when the level of DXS is lowered, so are the levels of isoprenoids. Because the changes in DXS levels lead to changes in isoprenoid abundance, we propose that DXS is one of the limiting enzymes in the MEP pathway. It is likely that other co-limiting enzymes for each specific isoprenoid are present in the plant MEP pathway or further downstream, as we did not observe a linear relationship between changes in DXS and its end products. Additional limiting enzymes would also explain the differences observed in the relative increases among the isoprenoids monitored in this work. This is the case for chlorophyll and carotenoid content where increases in their levels are more restricted than others. To identify other limiting enzymes of the MEP pathway will require further analyses when the complete enzymatic steps are known and the relative effects of changing the levels of other MEP pathway enzymes have been evaluated. Recently, the MEP pathway has been intensively studied in bacteria where it was found that DXS also is as a limiting enzyme, and DXR is not (26Kuzuyama T. Takagi M. Takahashi S. Seto H. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 891-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 34Miller B. Heuser T. Zimmer W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 481: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 52Harker M. Bramley P.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This conclusion is also supported by recent work on tomato fruit ripening. Lois et al. (25Lois L.M. Rodrı́guez-Concepción M. Gallego F. Campos N. Boronat A. Plant J. 2000; 22: 503-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found that DXS was limiting for carotenoid production over the previously identified limiting step of carotenoid biosynthesis (PSY1). They reasoned that DXS was limiting the amount of IPP available for carotenoid synthesis because even when there were increases inPSY1 transcript levels, there were no increases in carotenoids without increases in DXS. The accumulated evidence indicates that DXS is one of the limiting steps in the MEP pathway of plants as well as in bacteria.In this work we analyzed isoprenoids that are synthesized at very low levels such as hormones, and isoprenoids that are required in large quantities such as chlorophylls and carotenoids. In both cases a moderate change in the DXS level produced differences in the levels of the final isoprenoid products. Despite the fact that the biosynthetic pathway of GA has been intensively studied, there is no direct evidence that these hormones are actually synthesized via the MEP pathway. Our data suggest that GA biosynthesis depends, at least in part, on the IPP that comes from the MEP pathway. However, based on the expression of the GA4 gene, the cla1-1 mutant seems to contain active GA, which suggests that an additional source of IPP exists. Whether this IPP is the result of the import of cytosolic IPP (15Lichtenthaler H.K. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 47-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar) or if it comes from other sources remains to be established. Other groups have also looked at increasing or decreasing the levels of the hormones ABA (58Thompson A.J. Jackson A.C. Symonds R.C. Mulholland B.J. Dadswell A.R. Blake P.S. Burbidge A. Taylor I.B.

Plant J. 1999; 17: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) by modulating the levels of enzymes in their individual post-IPP biosynthetic pathways. These studies have obtained relatively large changes in hormone levels with phenotypes complementing the proposed functions of these hormones, which demonstrate additional key regulatory steps in these biosynthetic pathways.Much research has been devoted to increasing the levels of the isoprenoids α-carotene, β-carotene (3Römer S.

Plant J. 1995; 8: 693-701Crossref Scopus (296) Google Scholar), and α-tocopherol (2Shintani D. DellaPenna D. Science. 1998; 282: 2098-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) due, in part, to the importance of these molecules as precursors to vitamins needed by mammals. When total carotenoid content was increased (65Shewmaker C.K. Sheehy J.A. Daley M. Colburn S. Ke D.Y. Plant J. 1999; 20: 401-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 66Fray R.G. Wallace A. Fraser P.D. Valero D. Hedden P. Bramley P.M. Grierson D. Plant J. 1995; 8: 693-701Crossref Scopus (296) Google Scholar), there were concomitant decreases in other isoprenoids. The results of these studies also support that the amount of IPP is limiting for isoprenoid production. In contrast, when only the relative quantity of isoprenoid end products was changed such as α-carotene to β-carotene (3Römer S. Fraser P.D. Kiano J.W. Shipton C.A. Misawa N. Schuch W. Bramley P.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 666-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) or γ-tocopherol to α-tocopherol (2Shintani D. DellaPenna D. Science. 1998; 282: 2098-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), there were no other effects noted. By changing the amount of DXS and thus IPP levels, we are reporting the first instance in plants where a general increase or decrease in multiple plastidic isoprenoids was observed. Because moderate alterations in DXS levels (38–172x0025;) lead to changes in all of the isoprenoids tested, it is apparent that the IPP from the MEP pathway is also limiting for the production of plastidic isoprenoids. The limiting role of IPP availability in isoprenoid production implies that to increase an individual isoprenoid without decreasing other isoprenoids requires a concurrent increase in IPP production.Even though the levels of the different isoprenoids increase or decrease according to the level of DXS, the various isoprenoids do not change equally showing the complexity of the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathways that diverge from plastidic IPP. These results, together with the studies mentioned above wherein amounts of individual isoprenoids could be modulated through manipulation of genes in their post-IPP biosynthetic pathways, demonstrate that each of these post-IPP biosynthetic pathways has its own set of limiting and regulatory steps.Aside from the measured changes in isoprenoid content, the DXS-overexpressing and -suppressed transgenic plants had close to normal phenotypes when grown in germination medium or in soil under optimal conditions. Significant differences were observed in the growth rates of the 8- and 26-day-old transgenic plants but not in the final plant size. These differences are not likely to be due solely to the observed changes in GA levels because changes of this hormone result in either dwarf or giant phenotypes (67Ross J.J. Murfet I.C. Reid J.B. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 550-560Crossref Google Scholar). A possible explanation for the growth rate effects in the transgenic lines is that the plastidic IPP pathway receives its substrates directly from the Calvin cycle; therefore, changing the amount of IPP produced in these plants might have a direct effect on photosynthetic carbon availability to other pathways in the cell. Therefore, we hypothesized that the differences in growth rates are likely due to a pleiotropic effect of changes in carbon metabolism and hormone levels. On the other hand, the differences in germination rates can likely be directly correlated to the effects of either raised or lowered ABA levels. ABA plays a major role in setting and maintaining dormancy in seeds (56Koornneef M. Karssen C.M. Meyerowitz E.M. Somerville C.R. Seed Dormancy and Germination. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 313-334Google Scholar). The DXS-suppressed plants with less ABA content germinated rapidly, whereas the DXS-overexpressing plants had poor germination rates. These results are very similar to those obtained for ABA mutants of the post-IPP biosynthetic pathway (58Thompson A.J. Jackson A.C. Symonds R.C. Mulholland B.J. Dadswell A.R. Blake P.S. Burbidge A.

In addition to the germination rates, transgenic plants containing 4-fold more ABA do not display any other phenotypes when grown under normal conditions. In contrast to what was reported in tomato, we could not observe overguttation or chlorosis in the leaves of these plants, when grown under normal conditions (58Thompson A.J. Jackson A.C. Symonds R.C. Mulholland B.J. Dadswell A.R. Blake P.S. Burbidge A. Taylor I.B. Plant J. 2000; 23: 363-374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that the levels of ABA in the transgenic lines are not sufficient to generate these phenotypes in Arabidopsis or that a specific growth condition could be required to display these phenotypes. We believe that a more detailed analysis of these plants could provide additional information about ABA regulation and function in plants. For example, the proposed regulation between biosynthesis and catabolism of ABA seems insufficient to prevent the ABA increments observed in the overexpressing plants. These results are similar to what was found with the ectopic expression of the tomato 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase enzyme, involved in the ABA biosynthetic pathway (58Thompson A.J. Jackson A.C. Symonds R.C. Mulholland B.J. Dadswell A.R. Blake P.S. Burbidge A. Taylor I.B. Plant J. 2000; 23: 363-374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Altering DXS levels, and hence IPP, manifested itself phenotypically in changes in growth rates, but not the final plant size, as well as having an effect on germination rates.Varying the quantity of DXS may also lead to differences in the amounts of thiamin and pyridoxol because the product of DXS, DXP, is a precursor to these molecules as well as IPP. However, it is unlikely that either thiamin or pyridoxol deficiency gives rise to the observed phenotypes of these transgenic plants because the measurements of isoprenoid content and seedling size were performed in the presence of media containing vitamin supplements. As suggested in the initial studies of the cla1-1 mutant (27Mandel M.A. Feldmann K.A. Herrera-Estrella L. Rocha-Sosa M. León P.

Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), alterations in the quantity of vitamins cannot account for the phenotypes that were observed in the transgenic plants.Finally, since many isoprenoids are useful in medical, nutritional, or industrial applications and our ability to manipulate successfully metabolic pathways in plants continues to improve, isoprenoids are becoming a prime target for the production of commercially viable transgenic plants. By having isolated and characterized DXS (27Mandel M.A. Feldmann K.A. Herrera-Estrella L. Rocha-Sosa M. León P. Plant J. 1996; 9: 649-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 28Estévez J.M.

We observed changes in the levels of a wide variety of isoprenoids, and these increases or decreases in isoprenoid levels followed the levels of DXS.

The first, t(1;14), results in the transfer of the entireBcl10 gene to chromosome 14 wherein Bcl10 expression is inappropriately stimulated by the neighboring Ig enhancer. The second, t(11;18), results in the synthesis of a novel fusion protein, API2-MALT1. Until now, no common mechanism of action has been proposed to explain how the products of these seemingly unrelated translocations may contribute to the same malignant process. We show here that Bcl10 and MALT1 form a strong and specific complex within the cell, and that these proteins synergize in the activation of NF-κB. The data support a mechanism of action whereby Bcl10 mediates the oligomerization and activation of the MALT1 caspase-like domain. This subsequently activates the IKK complex through an unknown mechanism, setting in motion a cascade of events leading to NF-κB induction. Furthermore, the API2-MALT1 fusion protein also strongly activates NF-κB and shows dependence upon the same downstream signaling factors. We propose a model whereby both the Bcl10·MALT1 complex and the API2-MALT1 fusion protein activate a common downstream signaling pathway that originates with the oligomerization-dependent activation of the MALT1 caspase-like domain.

Wright D.H. Cancer. 1983; 52: 1410-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar). It is now recognized that these are the most common form of lymphoma arising in extranodal sites; most cases originate in the gastric mucosa where they are strongly associated with chronic Helicobacter pylori infection (2Isaacson P.G. Spencer J. J. Clin. Pathol. 1995; 48: 395-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, MALT lymphomas may also occur in other sites such as the lung, salivary glands, and thyroid. Again, when the lymphoma arises in these sites, it is frequently associated with a prior chronic inflammatory process such as lymphoid interstitial pneumonia in the lung, Sjögren's disease in the salivary glands, and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. These findings have lead to the notion that, at least in early stages of tumor development, growth of the neoplastic cells is facilitated by antigen-driven T cells. Based on histopathologic criteria, MALT lymphomas are classified as either low- or high-grade. Nevertheless, it is likely that for most cases there is a gradual progression in the pathogenesis of the disease, such that untreated borderline cases progress to low-grade lymphomas which ultimately develop into high-grade, aggressive lymphomas. Consistent with this notion is the finding that many early cases of gastric MALT lymphoma can be effectively treated solely by eradication of H. pylori with antibiotics (3Wotherspoon A.C. Pan L. Diss T.C. Isaacson P.G. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 1992; 58: 35-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). More established, higher-grade lymphomas may require more aggressive treatment, as the progression of such tumors appears to no longer depend on a coexisting chronic inflammatory process.The molecular events responsible for the development and progression of MALT lymphomas are still poorly understood. Several recurrent chromosomal abnormalities have been observed in these lymphomas, but no unifying molecular model has been proposed to explain how these distinct abnormalities may promote tumorigenesis. Perhaps the best characterized chromosomal abnormality is the recurrent t(1;14) (p22;q32) which was recently shown to result in the translocation of the entire coding region of the Bcl10 gene to chromosome 14, wherein its expression is inappropriately placed under the control of the strong Ig transcriptional enhancers (4Willis T.G.

In this study, we further characterized this pathway, and in so doing, discovered that MALT1 participates with Bcl10 in a novel mechanism for NF-κB activation. The data indicate that Bcl10 and MALT1 form a tight complex which serves to oligomerize and activate the caspase-like domain of MALT1. Through an unknown mechanism, this appears to subsequently activate the downstream IκB kinase (IKK) complex, leading to the induction of NF-κB.

https://openalex.org/W2080239627,"A prominent pathway of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling involves receptor-dependent phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3, which then translocate to the nucleus to activate transcription of target genes. To investigate the relative importance of these two Smad proteins in TGF-β1 signal transduction, we have utilized a loss of function approach, based on analysis of the effects of TGF-β1 on fibroblasts derived from mouse embryos deficient in Smad2 (S2KO) or Smad3 (S3KO). TGF-β1 caused 50% inhibition of cellular proliferation in wild-type fibroblasts as assessed by [3H]thymidine incorporation, whereas the growth of S2KO or S3KO cells was only weakly inhibited by TGF-β1. Lack of Smad2 or Smad3 expression did not affect TGF-β1-induced fibronectin synthesis but resulted in markedly suppressed induction of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 by TGF-β1. Moreover, TGF-β1-mediated induction of matrix metalloproteinase-2 was selectively dependent on Smad2, whereas induction of c-fos, Smad7, and TGF-β1 autoinduction relied on expression of Smad3. Investigation of transcriptional activation of TGF-β-sensitive reporter genes in the different fibroblasts showed that activation of the (Smad binding element)4-Lux reporter by TGF-β1 was dependent on expression of Smad3, but not Smad2, whereas activation of the activin response element-Lux reporter was strongly suppressed in S2KO fibroblasts but, on the contrary, enhanced in S3KO cells.

TGF-β regulates cellular proliferation, induces synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), modulates the immune response, and plays an important role in embryonic development and cellular differentiation (1Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology, Peptide Growth Factors and Their Receptors. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990: 419-472Google Scholar).TGF-β evokes its biological effects by signaling through two different receptor serine/threonine kinases, TGF-β receptor type (TβR)-I and TβR-II, that form a tetrameric complex after binding of TGF-β to TβR-II. TβR-II activates TβR-I by phosphorylation of serine residues in the GS box. The anchor protein SARA (Smad anchor for receptor activation) recruits the cytoplasmic signal transducers Smad2 and Smad3, classified as so-called receptor-activated Smads (R-Smads), to the Tβ R-I kinase domain, resulting in their phosphorylation on serine residues in the C-terminal SSXS motif. Activated R-Smads heteroligomerize with the common partner (CO)-Smad4, and these complexes are transported into the nucleus, where they regulate gene expression. R-Smads and CO- Smads contain two highly conserved domains, the Mad homology (MH) 1 domain and the MH2 domain, which are connected by a linker region. Whereas their MH1 domains can interact with the DNA, the MH2 domains are endowed with transcriptional activation properties.Down-regulation of TGF-β signaling is effected, in part, by a feedback mechanism involving induction of expression of the inhibitory Smads, Smad6 and Smad7, which then prevent R-Smad activation (2Heldin C.H.

Homozygous loss of function mutations of the Smad2 gene by targeted deletion of the MH1 or MH2 domain resulted in embryonic lethality due to failure to establish an anterior-posterior axis, gastrulation, and mesoderm formation (4Nomura M.

However, Smad3 knockout mice are smaller than wild-type littermates and show forelimb malformations (8Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Pan L. Borton A.J. Zhuang Y. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell.

Mice lacking expression of Smad3 die from chronic inflammation of several organs as a consequence of impaired immune function including defects in mucosal immunity, as revealed by abscesses in tissues adjacent to mucosal membranes, and expansion of activated T-cell populations. This can be attributed in part to the lack of responsiveness of Smad3-deficient T cells to the growth-inhibitory effects of TGF-β as well as to a defective chemotactic response of Smad3-deficient neutrophils to TGF-β (8Datto M.B.

Escalante-Alcalde D. Lia M. Boettinger E. Edelmann W. Stewart C.L. Kucherlapati R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12595-12600Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 9Yang X. Letterio J.J. Lechleider R.J. Chen L. Hayman R. Gu H. Roberts A.B. Deng C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1280-1291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to analysis of the function of Smad2 and Smad3 by overexpression studies, these loss of function cell systems provide a more appropriate model to investigate the physiological roles and relative importance of these R-Smads in TGF-β signaling and provide insight into the consequence of impaired TGF-β R-Smad function in relation to pathophysiology. Our data show that expression of Smad2 or Smad3 in fibroblasts is important for TGF-β1-mediated growth inhibition as well as for synthesis of PAI-1, whereas Smad2 and Smad3 contribute uniquely to TGF-β1-induced activation of several luciferase reporter constructs. We further show that certain genes are selectively dependent on only one of these two TGF-β receptor-activated Smads, such as, for example, the matrix metalloproteinase MMP-2, which is critically dependent on Smad2 but not Smad3 expression. Collectively, our results indicate nonredundant roles for Smad2 and Smad3 in TGF-β1-mediated signaling and provide insight into the targets of these specific signaling pathways in vivo.DISCUSSIONWe have investigated TGF-β signaling in established mouse embryo-derived fibroblasts deficient in expression of Smad2or Smad3 to assess the effect of loss of each of these key signaling intermediates on induction of target gene expression by TGF-β1. We have identified target genes with Smad2- or Smad3-independent patterns of induction, those that are affected by the loss of either R-Smad, and genes that are selectively dependent on one or the other of these two R-Smad proteins. As examples, we have shown that TGF-β1-induced fibronectin synthesis occurs in the absence of Smad2 or Smad3 expression, whereas both Smads have roles in the induction of PAI-1 protein and in the more complex end point of TGF-β1-induced growth inhibition with associated regulation of cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitorsp15 INK4B and p21 CIP1/WAF1. We also show for the first time that TGF-β1-mediated induction of c-fos expression requires Smad3 and that induction of MMP-2 is selectively dependent on Smad2. Moreover, similar to that shown for Smad3 null macrophages and keratinocytes (10Ashcroft G.S. Yang X. Glick A.B. Weinstein M. Letterio J.L. Mizel D.E. Anzano M. Greenwell-Wild T. Wahl S.M. Deng C. Roberts A.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar), we show that autoinduction of TGF-β1 in fibroblasts is strongly suppressed in the absence of Smad3. To test that results shown previously in overexpression systems are truly dependent on Smad2 and Smad3, we have also assessed the activation of several TGF-β-sensitive reporter genes in these Smad-deficient fibroblasts. Together, these experiments demonstrate that Smad2 and Smad3 have both overlapping and distinct roles in TGF-β1 signaling, depending on the target gene and cellular context.Because of the early embryonic lethal phenotype of the Smad2 knockout mice (4Nomura M. Li E. Nature. 1998; 393: 786-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 5Weinstein M. Yang X. Li C. Xu X. Gotay J. Deng C.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9378-9383Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and the technical difficulties involved in derivation of S2KO embryonic fibroblasts, we were forced to do most of our comparisons between the role of Smad2 and Smad3 in TGF-β1 signaling using spontaneously immortalized fibroblasts that were cultured over multiple passages. To underscore the validity of our studies, we show that expression of Smad3 is also important for TGF-β1-mediated induction of Smad7, TGF-β1, and PAI-1 in primary MEFs and primary DFs. We also show that induction of expression of these genes by TGF-β1 can be restored after stable reintroduction of Smad3 in these primary Smad3-deficient fibroblasts. In contrast, whereas adenoviral- or retroviral-mediated restoration of Smad2 or Smad3 expression in fibroblasts could restore TGF-β1-responsive reporter gene induction dependent directly on Smads, this strategy was not sufficient to restore induction by TGF-β1 of endogenous gene responses shown to be dependent on Smad2 or Smad3 (data not shown). Similar observations of the inability to rescue responses by stable introduction of Smads or other signaling molecules into established cell systems have been reported (35Shen X. Li J. Hu P.P-c. Waddell D. Zhang J. Wang X.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15362-15368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 36Blain S.W. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32066-32070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that restoration of Smad expression is not sufficient to fully revert the established Smad knockout fibroblasts to their WT counterparts, possibly because loss of Smad expression in combination with multiple genetic alterations, inherently associated with immortalization, irreversibly alters expression of additional genes important in mediating signaling to more complex endogenous targets of TGF-β.In contrast to previous reports that address the role of different Smads by overexpression in in vitro systems, we show that fibroblasts derived from mouse embryos lacking expression of Smad2 or Smad3 provide a suitable loss of function model system to investigate the different effects of these two R-Smads in TGF-β signaling, as is important for the understanding of their distinct roles in vivo. For example, the different roles of Smad2 and Smad3 are evident in studies of embryogenesis, where targeted deletion of Smad2 or Smad3 results in either early embryonic lethality or viable offspring, respectively (4Nomura M. Li E. Nature. 1998; 393: 786-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 5Weinstein M. Yang X. Li C. Xu X. Gotay J. Deng C.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In wound healing, decreased levels of Smad2 or Smad3 have dramatically different effects (10Ashcroft G.S. Yang X. Glick A.B. Weinstein M. Letterio J.L. Mizel D.E. Anzano M. Greenwell-Wild T. Wahl S.M. Deng C. Roberts A.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Differences are also apparent in carcinogenesis, where Smad2 has been classified as a tumor suppressor based on its mutation frequency in several types of cancer (37Hata A. Shi Y. Massague J. Mol. Med. Today. 1998; 4: 257-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 38Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar), but where evidence for a similar role of Smad3 is lacking (39Arai T. Akiyama Y. Okabe S. Ando M. Endo M. Yuasa Y. Cancer Lett. 1998; 122: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 40Riggins G.J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Thiagalingam S. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2578-2580PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, because autoinduction of TGF-β1, previously shown to involve Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase/AP-1 signaling (26Kim S.J. Angel P. Lafyatis R. Hattori K. Kim K.Y. Sporn M.B. Karin M. Roberts A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1492-1497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Yue J. Mulder K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30765-30773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), is also dependent on Smad3 (Fig. 4, Dand E) (10Ashcroft G.S. Yang X. Glick A.B. Weinstein M. Letterio J.L. Mizel D.E. Anzano M. Greenwell-Wild T. Wahl S.M. Deng C. Roberts A.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar), retention of Smad3 might be selected for in tumor cells because TGF-β1 secreted by tumor cells can promote tumorigenesis by inducing metastasis, invasion, and angiogenesis (reviewed in Ref. 41Piek, E., and Roberts, A. B. (2001) Adv. Cancer Res., in press.Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that R-Smad activity can be blocked by certain oncogenes including Evi-1, which, in certain cells, could have effects similar to its loss by genetic defects (42de Caestecker M.P. Piek E. Roberts A.B. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1388-1402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).A number of physical differences between Smad2 and Smad3 have been described that might underlie or contribute to their observed functional differences or, in other cases, to their interchangeability. Whereas the MH1 domain of Smad3 can interact directly with SBE sequences (CAGAGTCT) in the DNA, Smad2 contains an extra exon that encodes 30 amino acids absent in the MH1 domain of Smad3 and prevents its binding to DNA (31Dennler S. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 32Yagi K. Goto D. Hamamoto T. Takenoshita S. Kato M. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 703-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, we observed that TGF-β1-induced activation of the (SBE)4-luciferase reporter, which consists of four concatemerized SBEs derived from the mouse JunB promoter (34Jonk L.J. Itoh S. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Kruijer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21145-21152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), occurred as efficiently in S2KO as in WT fibroblasts, whereas in S3KO cells, TGF-β1-induced (SBE)4-luciferase reporter activation was impaired. This is in agreement with previous observations that Smad2, in contrast to Smad3, could not be detected in Smad-complexes bound to aJunB probe and that overexpression of Smad2 contributed only weakly to TGF-β1-induced activation of the (SBE)4-luciferase reporter, whereas overexpression of Smad3 potently enhanced reporter induction, even in the absence of TGF-β (34Jonk L.J. Itoh S. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Kruijer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21145-21152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). In a similar manner, Smad3 is involved in activation of theSmad7 gene promoter, whereas Smad2 does not have a functional role in its induction by TGF-β (19von Gersdorff G. Susztak K. Rezvani F. Bitzer M. Liang D. Bottinger E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11320-11326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 43Nagarajan R.P. Zhang J. Li W. Chen Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33412-33418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mechanisms exist to alter the DNA binding patterns of Smad2 and Smad3. An alternative splice variant of Smad2 that lacks exon 3 does bind to DNA (32Yagi K. Goto D. Hamamoto T. Takenoshita S. Kato M. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 703-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 44Takenoshita S. Mogi A. Nagashima M. Yang K. Yagi K. Hanyu A. Nagamachi Y. Miyazono K. Hagiwara K. Genomics. 1998; 48: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and might possibly compensate for loss of Smad3 in mediating activation of certain TGF-β-induced responses.Differential in vivo activities of Smad2 and Smad3 on the same target element are also supported by our studies, suggesting that Smad2 and Smad3 might have distinct affinities for different transcription factors and thereby contribute differently to TGF-β signaling. Thus, overexpression of Smad3 inhibits activation of the goosecoid or Mix2 (ARE) TGF-β target gene promoters that are dependent on FAST, Smad2, and Smad4 (20Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 21Chen X. Weisberg E. Fridmacher V. Watanabe M. Naco G. Whitman M. Nature. 1997; 389: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). This inhibition has been proposed to result from either competition between Smad3 and Smad4 for binding to FAST (23Nagarajan R.P. Liu J. Chen Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31229-31235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or competitive affinities of Smad3 and Smad4 for SBE elements in the gene promoters (22Labbe E. Silvestri C. Hoodless P.A. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Our loss of function studies further support the dependence of this promoter on Smad2 as well as its negative regulation by endogenous Smad3. Thus, we show compromised activation of the ARE-luciferase reporter in Smad2-deficient fibroblasts, in contrast with enhanced activation of this reporter in Smad3-deficient cells as well as in NMuMG cells in which a truncated dominant-negative form of Smad3 is overexpressed, likely interfering with the function of the endogenous protein (9Yang X. Letterio J.J. Lechleider R.J. Chen L. Hayman R. Gu H. Roberts A.B. Deng C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1280-1291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In contrast to direct activation of immediate early genes and TGF-β-sensitive luciferase reporter genes that are likely controlled by low signaling thresholds, regulation of cell growth requires continuous signaling to modulate the tightly balanced cell cycle apparatus that integrates multiple signals at several complex end points. It is therefore more difficult to identify the genes that are directly involved in abrogation of TGF-β-induced inhibition of cellular proliferation. Similar to our findings in Smad2- or Smad3-deficient fibroblasts, it has been reported that the growth-inhibitory effects of TGF-β are lost in Smad3-deficient MEFs and astrocytes (8Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Pan L. Borton A.J. Zhuang Y. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2495-2504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Rich J.N. Zhang M. Datto M.B. Bigner D.D. Wang X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35053-35058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Whereas Datto et al. (8Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Pan L. Borton A.J. Zhuang Y. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2495-2504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) did not observe changes in the induction of p15 INK4B orp21 CIP1/WAF1 in Smad3-deficient MEFs, basal expression levels of p15 and p21 were dramatically decreased and increased, respectively, in our S2KO and S3KO fibroblasts compared with WT controls. In agreement with this, suppressed p15 levels and reduced activation of p15 by TGF-β have been observed in Smad3-deficient astrocytes (45Rich J.N. Zhang M. Datto M.B. Bigner D.D. Wang X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35053-35058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, the correlation between dysregulated p15 and p21 levels and the observed growth behavior of our KO fibroblasts is unclear at present.The results presented here demonstrating that activation of genes by TGF-β1 is often dependent on one of the two TGF-β R-Smads, Smad2 or Smad3, suggest that the observed differences in KO phenotypes of Smad2-versus Smad3-deficient mice are not merely a consequence of differential spatially and temporally controlled patterns of gene expression of these two R-Smads during development but rather reflect unique, nonoverlapping roles for Smad2 and Smad3 in control of target gene expression, which allows for more versatility in cross-talk with other signal transduction pathways. Detailed analysis of TGF-β target gene expression in Smad2 versus Smad3 KO cell systems now has the potential to provide insights into their respective roles in regulation of genes that are of critical importance for both normal physiology and development as well as in disease pathogenesis, including carcinogenesis. Transforming growth factor (TGF)1-β is the prototypic member of the TGF-β superfamily and mediates a multiplicity of biological effects on different cell types. TGF-β regulates cellular proliferation, induces synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), modulates the immune response, and plays an important role in embryonic development and cellular differentiation (1Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology, Peptide Growth Factors and Their Receptors. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990: 419-472Google Scholar). TGF-β evokes its biological effects by signaling through two different receptor serine/threonine kinases, TGF-β receptor type (TβR)-I and TβR-II, that form a tetrameric complex after binding of TGF-β to TβR-II. TβR-II activates TβR-I by phosphorylation of serine residues in the GS box. The anchor protein SARA (Smad anchor for receptor activation) recruits the cytoplasmic signal transducers Smad2 and Smad3, classified as so-called receptor-activated Smads (R-Smads), to the Tβ R-I kinase domain, resulting in their phosphorylation on serine residues in the C-terminal SSXS motif. Activated R-Smads heteroligomerize with the common partner (CO)-Smad4, and these complexes are transported into the nucleus, where they regulate gene expression. R-Smads and CO- Smads contain two highly conserved domains, the Mad homology (MH) 1 domain and the MH2 domain, which are connected by a linker region. Whereas their MH1 domains can interact with the DNA, the MH2 domains are endowed with transcriptional activation properties. Down-regulation of TGF-β signaling is effected, in part, by a feedback mechanism involving induction of expression of the inhibitory Smads, Smad6 and Smad7, which then prevent R-Smad activation (2Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3316) Google Scholar,3Piek E. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2105-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Absence of Smad2 or Smad3 expression resulting from targeted deletion of the respective Smad genes in mice has revealed different developmental roles for Smad2 and Smad3. Homozygous loss of function mutations of the Smad2 gene by targeted deletion of the MH1 or MH2 domain resulted in embryonic lethality due to failure to establish an anterior-posterior axis, gastrulation, and mesoderm formation (4Nomura M. Li E. Nature. 1998; 393: 786-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 5Weinstein M. Yang X. Li C. Xu X. Gotay J. Deng C.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9378-9383Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). These events are controlled by Smad2-dependent signals from the visceral endoderm (6Waldrip W.R. Bikoff E.K. Hoodless P.A.

Postgastrulation-rescued Smad2 mutant embryos survived up to embryonic day 10.5 but showed several malformations such as cyclopia, cranial abnormalities, and impaired left-right patterning as observed by abnormal heart looping and embryo turning (7Heyer J. Escalante-Alcalde D. Lia M. Boettinger E. Edelmann W. Stewart C.L. Kucherlapati R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12595-12600Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In contrast, mice harboring homozygous deletions of theSmad3 gene are viable and survive for several months, indicating that Smad3 is dispensable for embryonic development. However, Smad3 knockout mice are smaller than wild-type littermates and show forelimb malformations (8Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Pan L. Borton A.J. Zhuang Y. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W2038691967,"Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (AAV) are promising gene therapy vectors. Whereas AAV serotype 2-mediated gene transfer to muscle has partially replaced factor IX deficiency in hemophilia patients, its ability to mediate gene transfer to the lungs for cystic fibrosis is hindered by lack of apical receptors. However, AAV serotype 5 infects human airway epithelia from the lumenal surface. We found that in contrast to AAV2, the apical membrane of airway epithelia contains abundant high affinity receptors for AAV5. Binding and gene transfer with AAV5 was abolished by genetic or enzymatic removal of sialic acid from the cell surface. Furthermore, binding and gene transfer to airway epithelia was competed by lectins that specifically bind 2,3-linked sialic acid. These observations suggest that 2,3-linked sialic acid is either a receptor for AAV5 or it is a necessary component of a receptor complex. Further elucidation of the receptor for this virus should enhance understanding of parvovirus biology and expand the therapeutic targets for AAV vectors."
https://openalex.org/W1534052611,"Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling regulates embryonic dorsal–ventral cell fate decisions in flies, frogs and fish1. BMP activity is controlled by several secreted factors including the antagonists chordin and short gastrulation (SOG)2,3. Here we show that a second secreted protein, Twisted gastrulation (Tsg)4, enhances the antagonistic activity of Sog/chordin. In Drosophila, visualization of BMP signalling using anti-phospho-Smad staining5 shows that the tsg and sog loss-of-function phenotypes are very similar. In S2 cells and imaginal discs, TSG and SOG together make a more effective inhibitor of BMP signalling than either of them alone. Blocking Tsg function in zebrafish with morpholino oligonucleotides causes ventralization similar to that produced by chordin mutants. Co-injection of sub-inhibitory levels of morpholines directed against both Tsg and chordin synergistically enhances the penetrance of the ventralized phenotype. We show that Tsgs from different species are functionally equivalent, and conclude that Tsg is a conserved protein that functions with SOG/chordin to antagonize BMP signalling."

These results establish an efficient screening procedure to identify CFTR activators and inhibitors and have identified 7,8-benzoflavones and pyrazolo derivatives as novel classes of CFTR activators. cystic fibrosis CF transmembrane conductance regulator yellow fluorescent protein Fischer rat thyroid The most common lethal genetic disease, cystic fibrosis (CF),1 is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein CFTR (1Pilewski J.M. Frizzell R.A. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S215-S255Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). CFTR is a cAMP-regulated epithelial cell membrane Cl−channel that seems also to regulate the activities of other membrane proteins (2Schwiebert E.M. Benos D.J. Egan M.E. Stutts M.J. Guggino W.B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S145-S166Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Normally Cl−-permeable epithelial cells in airways, pancreas, and other tissues become Cl−-impermeable in CF, resulting in defective salt, water, and protein transport. Although the exact mechanism by which decreased CFTR Cl− permeability produces lung and pancreatic disease in CF remains unclear, it is generally believed that restoration of CFTR Cl− permeability will be clinically beneficial. An important goal in CF research is thus the identification of small molecule activators of CFTR. Activators of CFTR chloride permeability can function by a number of direct and indirect mechanisms including increased cAMP production, inhibition of phosphodiesterase or phosphatase activities, or direct interactions with CFTR. Several chemical classes of activators have been identified including flavones/isoflavones (e.g. genistein, Refs. 3Illek B. Fischer H. Santos G.F. Widdicombe J.H. Machen T.E. Reenstra W.W. Am. J.

Flavones/isoflavones such as genistein and apigenin are thought to interact directly with the nucleotide binding fold regions of CFTR and not by the inhibition of tyrosine kinases (10French P.J.

There has been considerable interest in developing improved flavone-type CFTR activators because of their consistent and strong activation of wild-type and mutant CFTR in different cell types (13Illek B.

The benzo[c]quinolizinium MBP-07 also seems to activate CFTR without elevating intracellular cAMP or ATP concentrations or affecting the activities of several known protein phosphatases (5Becq F. Mettey Y. Gray M.A. Galietta L.J.V. Dormer R.L. Merten M. Metaye T. Chappe V. Marvingt-Mounir C. Zegarra-Moran O. Tarran R. Bulteau L. Derand R. Pereira M.M. McPherson M.A. Rogier C. Joffre M.

The purpose of this study was to apply a high throughput screening assay for the discovery of novel CFTR activators. Preliminary combinatorial libraries were synthesized based on the flavone and benzo[c]quinolizinium structures. We chose these lead compounds because they are the most likely of the known activators to interact directly with CFTR, and they share a common structural motif amenable to the design of hybrid structures. In addition, as reported separately (4Illek B. Lizarzaburu M.E. Lee V. Nantz M.H. Kurth M.J. Fischer H. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1838-C1846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Eda M. Kurth M.J.

We report here the screening of purified test compounds for CFTR-activating potency by a cell-based halide transport assay that utilized fluorescent epithelial cells stably expressing wild-type or G551D CFTR together with the green fluorescent protein halide indicator YFP-H148Q. YFP-H148Q fluorescence is decreased by halides by a rapid shift in pKa upon halide binding to a site near its tri-amino acid chromophore (22Jayaraman S. Haggie P. Wachter R.M. Remington S.J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6047-6050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The screen revealed new classes of CFTR activators and a CFTR inhibitor, which were characterized further in terms of potency, CFTR specificity, activation mechanism, and the ability to induce transepithelial chloride currents in polarized epithelial cells. (See Supplemental Material for a complete list of compounds and their structures.) Unless otherwise indicated, the flavonoids screened in the present study were prepared using the recently reported modification (23Ares J.J. Outt P.E. Randall J.L. Murray P.D. Weisshaar P.S. O'Brien L.M. Ems B.L. Kakodkar S.V. Kelm G.R. Kershaw W.C. Werchowski K.M. Parkinson A. J. Med.

The flavones UCcf-016–UCcf-21 were synthesized using a different modification of the Baker-Venkataraman flavone synthesis (26Banerji A. Goomer N.C. Synthesis. 1980; 11: 874-875Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). All 2-aryl-4-quinolones and 2-aryl-quinoline-4-thiones were prepared using our previously described protocol (19Niedzinski, E. J., Lashley, M. R., and Nantz, M. H. (2001) Heterocycles 55, in press.Google Scholar). The flavone UCcf-045 was prepared as described (4Illek B. Lizarzaburu M.E. Lee V. Nantz M.H. Kurth M.J. Fischer H. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1838-C1846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the flavones UCcf-027, UCcf-028, and UCcf-034–UCcf-038 were prepared from 5-hydroxy-4′-iodoflavone via Suzuki coupling (27Halvelkova M. Hocek M. Cesnek M. Dvorak D. Synlett. 1999; 7: 1145-1147Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar) using the following representative experimental procedure: 3-thiopheneboronic acid (1.5 eq, 15 mg), Pd(PPh3)4 (2.5 mol %, 1.7 mg, 0.00157 mmol), and K2CO3 (2.7 eq, 23.1 mg, 0.254 mmol) were added to a stirred solution of the 5-hydroxy-4′-iodoflavone (1.0 eq, 25 mg, 0.0628 mmol) in a mixture of dimethoxyethane (0.75 ml) and water (0.1 ml). The mixture was refluxed at 85 °C for 9 h. After cooling, the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation. The solid residue was dissolved in dichloromethane and extracted twice with 30 ml of water. The combined organic layers were washed with brine and dried using anhydrous sodium sulfate. After concentration, the solid residue was redissolved with a minimum quantity of hot ethyl acetate followed by the slow addition of hexane to allow crystallization. The solids were then filtered and washed with excess 10:1 hexane/ethyl acetate to obtain 10.5 mg of UCcf-037 (52% yield) as a light cream-colored solid. Compound identity and purity were confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR and thin layer chromatography. Quinolizinium salts were synthesized using the procedure described by Becq et al. (5Becq F. Mettey Y. Gray M.A. Galietta L.J.V. Dormer R.L. Merten M. Metaye T. Chappe V. Marvingt-Mounir C. Zegarra-Moran O. Tarran R. Bulteau L. Derand R. Pereira M.M. McPherson M.A. Rogier C. Joffre M. Argent B.E.

The (ω-hydroxy)alkylpyridinium and azacyanine analogs were prepared using our previously published procedures (16Eda M. Kurth M.J. Nantz M.H. J. Org.

The fused pyrazolo heterocycles were synthesized as reported (18Kizer D.E. Miller B.R. Kurth M.J. Tetrahedron Lett. 1999; 40: 3535-3538Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Tetrazines and isoxazole heterocyles were prepared as described (20Sammelson R.E. Miller R.B. Kurth M.J. J. Org. Chem. 2000; 65: 2225-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21Sammelson R.E. Olmstead M.M. Haddadin M.J. Kurth M.J. J. Org. Chem. 2000; 65: 9265-9267Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Compound homogeneity was verified by thin layer chromatography. A subset of compounds was examined by 1H and 13C NMR and found to be >90% pure. Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) cells expressing the human wild-type CFTR or CFTR-G551D were transfected with the plasmid pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) containing the cDNA encoding YFP-H148Q and selected in G418 (0.75 mg/ml). Clonal populations were obtained by repeated limiting dilution and cloning rings. Cells were cultured in Coon's modified F-12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were plated in 96-well black microplates (Corning Costar) at a density of 20,000 cells/well using a Labsystems multidrop apparatus. After 24–48 h, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline using a Labsystems cell-wash apparatus and were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The residual volume of phosphate-buffered saline was 40 μl/well. The assay was performed in a FLUOstar Galaxy microplate reader (BMG LabTechnologies, Inc.) equipped with HQ500/20X (500 ± 10 nm) excitation and HQ535/30M (535 ± 15 nm) emission filters (Chroma Technology Corp.) and syringe pumps. YFP fluorescence in each well was monitored continuously for 100 s, and data were binned in 0.5-s intervals. At 5 s after the start of fluorescence recording, a syringe pump delivered 110 μl of a modified phosphate-buffered saline in which 137 mm NaI replaced NaCl to give an extracellular [I−] of 100 mm. After an additional 15 s, a second syringe pump delivered 50 μl of a 100 mmI−-containing solution including specified concentrations of forskolin. The assays were performed at 37 °C. The cell toxicity of all synthesized compounds was assessed using the sulforhodamine incorporation method (28Rubinstein L.V. Shoemaker R.H. Paull K.D. Simon R.M. Tosini S. Skehan P. Scudiero D.A. Monks A. Boyd M.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown in 96-well plates were exposed for 24 h to a 50 μm concentration of each compound in the culture medium. Cells were then fixed for 1 h at 4 °C by adding 10 μl of 50% trichloroacetic acid/100 μl of culture medium and subsequently washed five times with water. The cells were stained with 100 μl of 0.4% sulforhodamine B in 1% acetic acid for 30 min at room temperature. Excess dye was removed by washing with 1% acetic acid. After the removal of residual solution and drying, the bound dye was solubilized in 100 μl of 10 mm unbuffered Tris for measurement of solution absorbance at 564 nm. cAMP activity was measured using the BIOTRAK enzymatic immunoassay (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). FRT cells expressing CFTR were cultured in 96-well plates. After washing and incubation in phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated for 10 min with specified concentrations of forskolin, UCcf-029, or UCcf-180 and then lysed with the reagent provided by the kit. The lysates were assayed for cAMP content in triplicate according to manufacturer's instructions. Phosphatase activity was determined with a nonradioactive assay kit (Promega). Briefly, 17 Petri dishes containing CFTR-expressing FRT cells were washed and scraped using ice-cold phosphate-free buffer. After centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in 3 ml of a buffer containing 250 mm imidazole (pH 7.2), 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche). Cells were lysed with 30 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer, and the supernatant was recovered after centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min and frozen. Phosphatase activity was determined by incubating the homogenate (5 μg of protein) with the phosphorylated peptide substrate (provided in the kit) for 30 min at 30 °C, which was shown to be in the linear region. The reaction was terminated by the addition of the dye/additive mixture, and absorbance was measured at 620 nm. FRT cells stably expressing human wild-type or G551D CFTR were cultured on Snapwell inserts (Costar) at a density of 500,000 cells/insert. After 8–15 days, when the transepithelial electrical resistance was 3–4 kilo-ohm/cm2, the inserts were mounted in an Ussing chamber system (Vertical diffusion chamber, Costar). Apical and basolateral hemichambers were filled with 5 ml of a solution containing 75 mm NaCl and 75 mm sodium gluconate (apical solution) and 150 mm NaCl (basolateral solution) (both pH 7.3). The chambers were connected to a DVC-1000 voltage clamp (World Precision Instruments) via silver/AgCl electrodes and 1 mKCl agar bridges. The electrode offset potential and the fluid resistance were corrected using an insert not containing cells. During the experiments, the transepithelial potential was clamped at 0 mV, and the short-circuit current was recorded by a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter (PC-516 DAQ board, National Instruments) using a collection/display program written using LabView 6I software (National Instruments). At the beginning of the experiment, the basolateral membrane was permeabilized by adding 250 μg/ml amphotericin B. Permeabilization (developing over ∼30 min) was monitored by changes in transepithelial resistance. Forskolin was added at indicated concentrations in both hemichambers, and test compounds were added on the apical side only. In these measurements the basolateral membrane was permeabilized with amphotericin B, and a Cl− gradient was established to measure CFTR-mediated Cl− transport directly as reported (29Sheppard D.N. Carson M.R. Ostedgaard L.S. Denning G.M. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L405-L413PubMed Google Scholar, 30Baldursson O. Berger H.A. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L835-L841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This maneuver eliminates possible contributions of basolateral membrane channels. A Cl−gradient was established to generate a driving force for basolateral to apical Cl− transport at zero transepithelial potential difference. Fig. 1 shows core structures of the classes of compounds that were synthesized. The compounds are referred to as UCcf-01 (University of California-cystic fibrosis) through UCcf-223 and have been grouped in the following structural classes: flavonoids, quinoliziniums, pyridiniums, azacyanines, isoxazoles, and fused pyrazole heterocycles. Fig. 1 (bottom row) shows the structures of the reference compound genistein and two CFTR activators that were investigated in detail. Each compound was screened individually for its potency as a CFTR activator/inhibitor. Fig. 2 Ashows the fluorescence assay. FRT cells coexpressing human wild-type CFTR or G551D CFTR (which causes CF) and YFP-H148Q were cultured on 96-well plates for the monitoring of YFP fluorescence in a plate reader. The FRT cells and assay conditions were chosen to minimize CFTR-independent halide transport and basal (prior to cAMP simulation) CFTR halide transport. After recording baseline fluorescence, an osmotically matched I−-containing solution was added to the Cl−-containing solution bathing the cells to establish a 100 mm inwardly directed I− gradient (Fig.2 A, left). There was little I−influx (decrease in fluorescence) prior to the activation of wild-type CFTR under the experimental conditions used here. Subsequent activation by forskolin resulted in dose-dependent I−influx and decreased cell fluorescence. Neither activation of G551D CFTR nor of null cells that do not express CFTR was observed under these conditions (data not shown). As depicted schematically (Fig.2 A, middle and right panels), a test compound could (a) have no effect, (b) activate CFTR directly (prior to forskolin addition), (c) activate CFTR in synergy with forskolin (after forskolin addition), or (d) inhibit CFTR. In the initial screen, test compounds were added to the cell bathing solution at 50 μm concentration just prior to the assay. For screening of the cells expressing wild-type CFTR, a submaximal concentration of forskolin (250 nm) was added during the assay to probe for synergy with the test compounds with cAMP activation. Fig. 2 B summarizes the data from duplicate screening of the compound library. The ordinate is the maximum normalized slope of the fluorescence time course, representing I− influx (in mm/s) measured after I− addition. Although most of the compounds were inactive, several compounds activated CFTR strongly in the absence of forskolin, as seen by the prompt fluorescence decrease upon I−addition. Fig. 2 B (inset) provides representative original curves from the screen showing activation of wild-type CFTR by the compounds UCcf-027, UCcf-029, UCcf-031, and UCcf-180. The novel activators included compounds of the novel 7,8-benzoflavone and fused pyrazole heterocycle classes. Interestingly, compound UCcf-019, which contains a t-butyl substituent, inhibited forskolin-stimulated CFTR activity. None of the compounds synergized forskolin-stimulated CFTR activity without increasing CFTR activity in the absence of forskolin. Several of the novel activating compounds were characterized further (see below). A full screen was also carried out in FRT cells expressing G551D CFTR. Halide transport by G551D CFTR is not increased by cAMP elevation alone. For screening, cells were treated with 50 μm of each test compound, and then a high forskolin concentration (5 μm) was added during the assay to identify compounds that potentiated the effect of cAMP elevation. With the exception of UCcf-029, none of the 222 remaining compounds activated CFTR prior to forskolin addition. Fig. 2 C summarizes the maximum normalized fluorescence slope, representing I−influx after forskolin addition. Many of the same compounds that activated wild-type CFTR also activated G551D CFTR, although relative activating potencies differed, and a few compounds activated preferentially wild-type CFTR (e.g. UCcf-180) or G551D CFTR (e.g. UCcf-023 and UCcf-030). Representative original fluorescence curves are shown in Fig. 2 C (inset). Further analysis was done on compounds with apparent CFTR-activating potency. Except for compound UCcf-152, repeat assays of the putative CFTR activators confirmed the results of the original screens. Additional screening using a different cell line (Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing CFTR and YFP-H148Q) confirmed the results in FRT cells (data not shown). None of the putative CFTR activators induced halide flux in cells not expressing CFTR. Preliminary dose-response data (concentration range 1–50 μm) were generated to identify those compounds warranting further investigation. Fig.3 A depicts a dose-dependence for the activation of wild-type CFTR by UCcf-029 and UCcf-180, showing substantially better potency than the reference compound genistein. Fig.3 B shows a similar comparison for the activation of G551D CFTR. Genistein was active at >50 μm, whereas UCcf-023, UCcf-027, UCcf-028, and UCcf-030 induced significant iodide influx at 6.25–12.5 μm. Electrophysiological measurements of Cl− current were done to confirm CFTR activation and to compare activation potencies. Short-circuit current was measured in polarized monolayers of FRT cells expressing wild-type or G551D CFTR. Fig.4 A shows short-circuit current in response to the activation of wild-type CFTR by genisteinversus UCcf-029 and UCcf-180. The induced Cl− current was inhibited by the CFTR blocker diphenylamine-2-carboxylate. The effect of forskolin is shown for comparison. UCcf-029, the most potent activator of wild-type CFTR in the initial screening, induced a strong Cl− current at 5–10 μm with a significant effect at 1–2 μm, whereas genistein was not effective at the same concentrations. At 5 and 10 μm concentrations, UCcf-029 was 10 and 16 times more effective than genistein in increasing short-circuit current (in μA/cm2,n = 5; S.E. = 61 ± 16 versus 5.7 ± 3 [5 μm]; 115 ± 28 versus 7 ± 2 [10 μm]). As found in the plate-reader assay, UCcf-180 induced significant short-circuit current at concentrations lower than those required for genistein. Similar experiments showed no increase in short-circuit current in nontransfected FRT cells, supporting the conclusion that these compounds activate CFTR. The CFTR inhibitor UCcf-019 identified in the screening was confirmed by short-circuit current analysis (data not shown). We found that compounds of the benzoquinolizinium class including the lead compound MPB-07 (freshly synthesized and dissolved) were not effective in activating CFTR in the plate-reader assay or by short-circuit current analysis. It is unclear whether cell-type differences or other factors account for the absence of MPB-07 activation of CFTR in our experiments. Fig. 4 B shows short-circuit current analysis of G551D CFTR activation by genistein versus UCcf-030. UCcf-030 was remarkably more potent than genistein, which is in agreement with the fluorescence plate-reader data. Interestingly, the activator of wild-type CFTR, UCcf-180, was ineffective in activating G551D CFTR. The compounds UCcf-023, UCcf-027, and UCcf-028 were also effective in inducing short-circuit current in cells expressing G551D CFTR (data not shown). All compounds were screened for cell toxicity using a dihydrorhodamine accumulation assay. At 50 μm concentrations for 24 h, the reference compound genistein caused ∼20% growth inhibition. All compounds with activating potency on wild-type and/or G551D CFTR were nontoxic (cell growth >90% of control) except for UCcf-027, which was similar to genistein. To investigate the CFTR-activating mechanism, the CFTR activators were tested for their ability to elevate intracellular cAMP concentration and inhibit cell phosphatase activity. Using an enzymatic immunoassay, no significant elevation in cAMP concentration was found for 10-min incubations with the activators UCcf-029 at 5 μm and UCcf-180 at 25 μm (Fig.5 A), concentrations that induced short-circuit currents of 61 ± 16 and 53 ± 12 μA/cm2, respectively. These values were significantly higher than that induced by 1 μm forskolin (19 ± 4 μA/cm2), which produced a substantial elevation in intracellular cAMP concentration. Fig. 5 B summarizes the results of an assay of cell phosphatase activity, showing strong inhibition by okadaic acid and NaF. Total cell phosphatase activity was not significantly inhibited at concentrations of UCcf-029 and UCcf-180 that markedly stimulated CFTR. Together the data suggest that the CFTR-activation mechanism may involve direct compound-CFTR interactions. This study was designed to identify new CFTR activators that interact directly with CFTR. Structure-based drug design is not yet possible for CFTR because of the very limited knowledge about CFTR tertiary structure. We chose to generate a combinatorial compound library based on two lead compounds, flavones and benzo[c]quinoliziniums, which are believed to activate CFTR Cl− conductance by direct interaction with the CFTR molecule. A secondary purpose of this study was to establish the utility of a new cell-based screening assay to efficiently quantify the activity of putative CFTR activators and inhibitors. A number of technical challenges were encountered including the synthetic organic chemistry, cell line development, and transport assay optimization. Several novel CFTR activators were identified as well as a CFTR inhibitor. Interestingly, the structures of a potent class of compounds, the 7,8-benzoflavones (e.g. UCcf-027 and UCcf-029), contained features of both flavones and benzo[c]quinoliziniums. Activators of the novel class of fused pyrazole heterocycles were also identified. Although these compounds (such as UCcf-180) were less potent than the most potent benzoflavones, they represent a new class of CFTR activators. The CFTR activators did not induce Cl− currents in null cells, and short-circuit current analysis showed that they had activating potencies for wild-type and G551D CFTR that were substantially better than the existing lead compounds. The CFTR activators were nontoxic in the cell culture model and activated CFTR without measurable elevation in intracellular cAMP concentration or inhibition of total cell phosphatase activity. Single channel measurements will be required to establish whether these compounds interact directly with CFTR. Interestingly, the order of activating potencies of the CFTR activators on wild-type versus G551D CFTR was different. For example, UCcf-029 was the most potent compound in activating wild-type CFTR but had less effect on G551D CFTR. In contrast, UCcf-023, UCcf-028, and UCcf-030, which were substantially less potent than UCcf-029 in activating wild-type CFTR, were very potent in activating G551D CFTR in synergy with forskolin. As additional structural information on CFTR becomes available, the compounds with differential potencies discovered here may be useful in identifying critical structural motifs important for CFTR activation. For the most common CFTR mutant causing cystic fibrosis in humans, ΔF508 CFTR, the activators identified here may be useful in synergy with compounds that correct the intracellular processing defect of this mutant. Although our main aim was to identify CFTR activators, the assay permits the identification of CFTR inhibitors. It was found that the flavone UCcf-019 significantly reduced CFTR-mediated halide transport. Further studies are needed to determine whether the reduced halide transport involves direct CFTR binding or inhibition of the CFTR-activating pathway. CFTR inhibitors are important in basic cystic fibrosis research in terms of CFTR functional studies and may be useful clinically in the treatment of secretory diarrheas such as cholera. The fluorescence assay reported here should be useful in high throughput screening of other lead-based compound libraries as well as random combinatorial libraries. The assay permits the rapid quantitative measurement of cAMP-independent and -dependent halide permeability using a commercial automated fluorescence plate reader. The goal in identifying CFTR activators is to discover clinically useful drugs that will activate mutant CFTR molecules in cystic fibrosis. The underlying assumption in CF drug discovery is that activation of CFTR in cell culture models is a good surrogate marker for in vivo efficacy in improving clinical outcome in cystic fibrosis patients. Although this assumption is supported by a considerable body of data on the biology and function of CFTR, rigorous validation will require animal and human testing of potent nontoxic CFTR activators.

In the present study, using isolated liver mitochondria, we demonstrate that cytochrome c release occurs via distinct mechanisms that are either Ca2+-dependent or Ca2+-independent. An increase in mitochondrial matrix Ca2+ promotes the opening of the permeability transition (PT) pore and the release of cytochrome c, an effect that is significantly enhanced when these organelles are incubated in a reaction buffer that is based on a physiologically relevant concentration of K+ (150 mm KCl)versus a buffer composed of mannitol/sucrose/Hepes. Moreover, low concentrations of Ca2+ are sufficient to induce mitochondrial cytochrome c release without measurable manifestations of PT, though inhibitors of PT effectively prevent this release, indicating that the critical threshold for PT varies among mitochondria within a single population of these organelles. In contrast, Ca2+-independent cytochromec release is induced by oligomeric Bax protein and occurs without mitochondrial swelling or the release of matrix proteins, although our data also indicate that Bax enhances permeability transition-induced cytochrome c release. Taken together, our results suggest that the intramitochondrial Ca2+concentration, as well as the reaction buffer composition, are key factors in determining the mode and amount of cytochrome crelease.

The biochemical machinery required for apoptotic cell death is constitutively present in virtually all mammalian cells and can be activated by a variety of extra- and intracellular signals. Attempts to identify a common, unifying step in the apoptotic program, in response to various cytotoxic stimuli, have focused on the role of mitochondrial participation in this form of cell death (3Petit P.X.

Specifically, the release of several proteins, normally located in the intermembrane space of mitochondria, has been observed during the early stages of apoptotic cell death (8Cai J. Yang J. Jones D.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 9Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Daugas E.

Among these proteins is cytochrome c, a component of the electron transport chain that shuttles electrons between complexes III (bc1) and IV (cytochrome oxidase). Only holocytochrome c, and not apocytochromec, is able to stimulate procaspase-9 activation, which occurs when cytochrome c is released into the cytosol and interacts with Apaf-1 and procaspase-9 in the presence of dATP to form the apoptosome complex (11Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4422) Google Scholar). Moreover, some observations indicate that both reduced and oxidized cytochrome c are able to activate procaspase-9 with similar efficiencies, an effect that may be related to the speed with which oxidized cytochrome c is reducedin vitro (12Hampton M.B. Zhivotovsky B. Slater A.F. Burgess D.H. Orrenius S. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The mechanisms regulating cytochrome c release remain obscure. However, with the exception of disturbances in osmotic balance accounting for a non-selective release of intramitochondrial proteins (13Lemeshko V.V. Shekh V.E. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1993; 68: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 14Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar), two distinct models for cytochrome c release have emerged that can be distinguished on the basis of whether Ca2+ is required for the event. In one instance, mitochondrial Ca2+ overload results in swelling and rupture of the outer membrane followed by the release of cytochromec and other intermembrane space proteins (15Halestrap A.P. Kerr P.M. Javadov S. Woodfield K.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 16Crompton M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 233-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (2119) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-independent model asserts that a more selective protein release occurs without changes in mitochondrial volume. This mechanism involves specific channels/pores in the outer mitochondrial membrane that may be opened and regulated by certain proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, including Bax (17Doran E. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 18Tsujimoto Y. Shimizu S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). The precise way Bax modulates cytochrome c release is controversial. In particular, there are reports asserting that this protein functions directly on mitochondria to stimulate the release of cytochrome c by forming a selective pore in the outer membrane, whereas others argue that Bax interacts with the voltage-dependent anion channel and/or the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT)1 to facilitate opening of the permeability transition (PT) pore (19Eskes R. Antonsson B. Osen-Sand A. Montessuit S. Richter C. Sadoul R. Mazzei G. Nichols A. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 20Jurgensmeier J.M. Xie Z.

Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). More recent evidence indicates that truncated Bid induces a conformational change in Bax that allows this protein to insert in the outer membrane and stimulate cytochrome c release (22Eskes R. Desagher S. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). A different study demonstrated the ability of Bax to induce a complete loss of cytochrome cfrom mitochondria isolated from Xenopus eggs without otherwise affecting the functional integrity of these organelles (23von Ahsen O. Renken C. Perkins G. Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1027-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to provide a more definitive understanding of the mechanisms regulating cytochrome crelease in response to Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent effects on isolated liver mitochondria. The results indicate that cytochrome c release triggered by Ca2+ is significantly enhanced when mitochondria are incubated in KCl- versus MSH-based reaction buffers. Moreover, this release of cytochrome c can be observed prior to any measurable manifestations of MPT, such as swelling or the release of accumulated Ca2+. In comparison, oligomeric, but not monomeric, Bax triggers a Ca2+-independent release of cytochrome c that is not mitigated by inhibitors of MPT. Importantly, oligomeric Bax was also able to enhance Ca2+-induced cytochrome c release, pointing to a possible dual function for this protein. These data clearly demonstrate that cytochrome c release occurs by distinct Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent mechanisms that are each modulated by oligomeric Bax. Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (6 to 8 weeks old) were killed by CO2inhalation in accordance with the European directive of protection of vertebrate animals for scientific research. The liver was minced on ice, resuspended in 50 ml of MSH buffer (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) supplemented with 1 mm EDTA and homogenized with a glass Dounce homogenizer and Teflon pestle. Homogenates were centrifuged at 600 × g for 8 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was decanted and recentrifuged at 5,500 × g for 15 min to form a mitochondrial pellet that was resuspended in MSH buffer without EDTA and centrifuged again at 5,500 × g for 15 min. The final mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in MSH buffer at a protein concentration of 80–100 mg/ml. The purity of the mitochondrial fraction was verified by the absence of both cytosolic (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and nuclear (poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase) proteins as determined by Western blot analysis. Mitochondria (1 mg/ml) were incubated in MSH buffer or a buffer containing 150 mm KCl, 1 mmKH2PO4, 5 mm succinate, and 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at 25 °C. Rotenone (2 μm) was added to maintain pyridine nucleotides in a reduced form. Estimation of Δψ was performed using an electrode sensitive to the lipophilic cation tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP+). Energized mitochondria rapidly accumulate TPP+ from the incubation buffer and release this cation as Δψ decays. Ca2+ fluxes across the inner mitochondrial membrane were monitored using a Ca2+-sensitive electrode (model 97–20; Orion Research, Inc., Beverly, MA). Mitochondrial swelling was monitored continuously as changes inA 540. Oxygen consumption by isolated rat liver mitochondria was measured using a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Yellow Spring Instrument Co., Yellow Springs, OH) at 25 °C. Mitochondria with a respiratory control ratio (defined as the rate of respiration in the presence of ADP divided by the rate obtained following the expenditure of ADP) above 4 were used for all experiments. In some instances, mitochondrial respiration was uncoupled by the addition of 1 μm carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). Fresh mitochondria were prepared for each experiment and used within 4 h. At the end of the incubation period, mitochondrial suspensions were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and the resulting supernatants and/or pellets were used for Western blot analysis. Samples were mixed with Laemmli's loading buffer, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to 15% SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at 130 V followed by electroblotting to nitrocellulose membranes for 2 h at 100 V. Membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature and subsequently probed overnight with an anti-cytochrome c (1:2,500), anti-adenylate kinase-2 (1:2,000), anti-adenylate kinase-3 (1:2,000), anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (1:5,000), or anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (1:1,000) antibody. The membranes were rinsed and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000). Following the secondary antibody incubation, the membranes were rinsed, and bound antibodies were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression and purification of full-length Bax protein was performed as described previously (24Montessuit S. Mazzei G. Magnenat E. Antonsson B. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 15: 202-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, the full-length human Bax cDNA sequence was amplified by standard polymerase chain reaction techniques. The polymerase chain reaction DNA fragment was isolated using the QIAquick kit (Qiagen) and subcloned into the NcoI andHindIII sites of the plasmid pBAD. The plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli, and transformants were isolated by selection for ampicillin resistance. Cultures of the resistant colony were grown to an A 650 of ∼7. After induction, the culture was further incubated for several hours, and cells were harvested by centrifugation. The cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (100 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, a mixture of protease inhibitors, 30 μg/ml DNase I, and 50 μg/ml lysozyme) and broken by sonication. After centrifugation, Bax was recovered in the supernatant. Because the protein was expressed with a His tag at the N terminus, the purification by affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) followed by ion-exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The protein was at least 95.8% pure as determined by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Multimerization of recombinant Bax to a stable complex, which did not dissociate into smaller species, was performed in the presence of 1% octyl glucoside (24Montessuit S. Mazzei G. Magnenat E. Antonsson B. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 15: 202-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Data are presented as means ± S.D., and significance was determined using a Student's ttest. A value of p < 0.05 was considered to be significant. MPT is a consequence of Ca2+ overload (15Halestrap A.P. Kerr P.M. Javadov S. Woodfield K.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar,16Crompton M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 233-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (2119) Google Scholar), and the sensitivity of mitochondria to permeability transition (PT) can be enhanced by different factors. Among these factors are an elevated level of Pi, oxidative stress, the depletion of adenine nucleotides, and the oxidation of pyridine nucleotides. Fig. 1 is representative of a typical response of mitochondria to PT-inducing agents. In particular, when Pi or organic hydroperoxide is added to Ca2+-loaded isolated mitochondria (Fig. 1), these organelles swell (panel A), Δψ decays (panel B), and accumulated Ca2+ is released (panel C). MPT-induced drops in Δψ result in an acceleration of respiration (panel D), and all of these manifestations of MPT can be prevented by cyclosporin A (CsA) (panels A-D). Although the rate of Ca2+ release during MPT is similar in KCl versus MSH incubation buffers (Fig.2 A), the amount of cytochromec released is significantly more pronounced when mitochondria are incubated in the more physiologically relevant KCl buffer as compared with MSH buffer (Fig. 2 B). Further evidence of this is reflected in the assorted effects that cytochromec release has on mitochondrial respiration in the two buffers (Fig. 2 C). Specifically, the induction of MPT in MSH buffer resulted in a time-dependent acceleration of oxygen consumption that persisted until all oxygen was consumed. In contrast, incubation of mitochondria in KCl buffer resulted in an initial acceleration of respiration that was followed by its suppression, and no additional stimulation of oxygen consumption was observed upon the addition of the uncoupler CCCP. Moreover, Western blot analysis revealed that most cytochrome c was present in the supernatant fraction following MPT induction in KCl buffer, whereas only partial release of cytochrome c was observed in MSH buffer (Fig. 2 D). Taken together, these data indicate that although PT-induced uncoupling of mitochondria occurs in both buffers, respiration is suppressed only in KCl buffer, an effect most likely because of a greater loss of cytochrome c. In the aforementioned experiments, cytochrome c release was a consequence of PT induction, accompanied by swelling of mitochondria and rupture of the outer membrane. The next step was to determine whether cytochromec release could occur when Ca2+ loading was insufficient to induce observable manifestations of MPT. As seen in Fig. 3 A, Ca2+loading of mitochondria alone did not induce changes characteristic of MPT (cf. Fig. 1 C), and this cation was retained by mitochondria unless CCCP, an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation, was added. In addition, Ca2+-loaded mitochondria exhibited controlled respiration (Fig. 3 B), although increasing the Ca2+ retention time from 1 to 5 min prominently diminished the rate of CCCP-directed uncoupled respiration (Panel B,trace a versus trace b). Taking into consideration that the observed decrease in the rate of uncoupled respiration might be because of damage of the respiratory chain and/or the release of cytochrome c, the presence of this protein in the incubation buffer was analyzed. As seen in Fig. 3 C, the accumulation of Ca2+ by mitochondria in the absence of observable PT was sufficient to stimulate a release of cytochromec, an effect that was considerably more pronounced the longer mitochondria retained accumulated Ca2+. Inhibitors of MPT, such as ADP and Mg2+, suppressed this release (Fig.3 C) and restored the rate of uncoupled respiration (Fig.3 D). Additional evidence of cytochrome c release in the absence of observable MPT is presented in Fig.4 where the sequential addition of Ca2+ pulses to isolated mitochondria led to a stepwise decrease in the overall optical density (Fig. 4 A,traces 1–5) without inducing large amplitude swelling characteristic of PT. Meanwhile, the amount of cytochrome creleased from mitochondria was enhanced as Ca2+ loading increased (Fig. 4 B). This release reflected PT induction in a subpopulation of mitochondria, which was further supported by the fact that co-treatment of isolated mitochondria with 1 μmCsA eliminated cytochrome c release induced by Ca2+ additions ranging between 20 and 80 nmol/mg protein (data not shown). Cytochrome c release ultimately reached a pinnacle at 80 nmol Ca2+/mg protein (Fig. 4 B,lanes 6 and 7) as all mitochondria underwent PT (Fig. 4 A).Figure 4The effect of Ca2+ loading on mitochondrial swelling and the release of cytochromec. Mitochondria (0.5 mg/ml) were incubated as described under “Experimental Procedures”; in 2 ml of KCl buffer.A, mitochondria were loaded sequentially with varied amounts of Ca2+ until MPT was induced. B, samples were taken after 5 (lanes 1–6) or 8 min (lane 7) of incubation, and the supernatants were evaluated for cytochromec (Cyt c) content. Results are typical of five or more independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, we tested the effect of recombinant Bax protein on cytochrome c release. Bax has been reported to facilitate cytochrome c release in response to different stimuli, although the precise mechanism responsible for this event remains unclear. Both monomeric and oligomeric forms of Bax (Fig.5 A) were generated for our study because of reports indicating that oligomerization of Bax is a critical event for integration of this protein into membranes (22Eskes R. Desagher S. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). It should be noted that our monomeric form of Bax also contained the oligomeric form (Fig. 5 A, lane 2), although it is clear from the data that these different pools of recombinant Bax had strikingly dissimilar effects on cytochrome c release. The addition of oligomeric Bax to isolated mitochondria prominently induced the release of cytochrome c (Fig. 5 B). This release did not depend on MPT, because the incubation buffer used for these experiments contained 1 mm EGTA, a concentration sufficient to chelate available Ca2+ and hence prevent MPT. In contrast to the results obtained with oligomeric Bax, cytochromec release was marginal in the presence of the monomeric form of Bax (Fig. 5 B), which is in agreement with other data indicating that only oligomeric Bax is able to induce cytochromec release (25Gross A. Jockel J. Wei M.C. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3878-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). The slight release observed in the presence of monomeric Bax was most likely because of the presence of some of the oligomeric form in this preparation (Fig. 5 A, lane 2). In addition to stimulating an MPT-independent release of cytochromec, recombinant oligomeric Bax also facilitated Ca2+-induced MPT as assessed by both the release of accumulated Ca2+ (Fig. 5 C) and a drop in mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 5 D). In contrast, the monomeric form of this protein had no effect on either parameter as compared with control mitochondria (Fig. 5, C andD). Western blot analysis of cytochrome c release in samples taken 6 min after the addition of Ca2+ revealed that oligomeric Bax enhanced MPT-dependent cytochromec release (Fig. 5 E). Finally, an attempt to compare the ability of oligomeric Bax to enhance MPT-independent and MPT-dependent release of cytochrome c revealed, as we expected, that cytochrome c release was significantly more pronounced in samples taken from Bax-treated mitochondria that were stimulated to undergo PT (Fig. 5 F). To determine whether the combined or individual effects of Bax and Ca2+ on cytochrome c release were unique for this apoptogenic protein, we also evaluated the release of other mitochondrial proteins. Results indicated that the intermembrane space protein adenylate kinase-2 was released into the cytosol during MPT-independent and MPT-dependent modes of protein release, an effect that was consistent with our cytochrome c release data (Fig. 6, A andB). In contrast, the mitochondrial matrix protein adenylate kinase-3 was released only via PT, although oligomeric Bax significantly enhanced this result by potentiating the onset of PT (Fig. 6 C). Taken together, our data indicate that the effect of Bax alone is not specific for cytochrome c release insofar as adenylate kinase-2, a different intermembrane space protein, is also released. However, treatment of isolated mitochondria with Bax alone does not appear to compromise matrix integrity, because this protein did not initiate or enhance the release of adenylate kinase-3 unless PT was induced. Although it was originally believed that MPT induction was the root mechanism responsible for cytochrome c release in response to different cytotoxic stimuli, more recently this notion has been challenged, and the precise mechanisms regulating the release of this protein are unclear. In fact, many of the early results on mechanisms of cytochrome c release were generated using cell-free systems wherein isolated mitochondria and nuclei were treated with different PT pore activators, which, in turn, led to mitochondrial swelling, the release of cytochrome c (and other proteins), and subsequent changes in nuclear morphology that were characteristic of apoptosis. However, ample evidence from more recent studies suggests that although MPT is likely to be a mechanism responsible for cytochrome c release, it is no longer regarded as the mechanism (26Marzo I. Brenner C. Zamzami N. Jurgensmeier J.M. Susin S.A. Vieira H.L. Prevost M.C. Xie Z. Matsuyama S. Reed J.C. Kroemer G. Science. 1998; 281: 2027-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). In particular, Martinou et al.(27Martinou I. Desagher S. Eskes R. Antonsson B. Andre E. Fakan S. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) demonstrated that mitochondria of neurons undergoing apoptosis, induced by neuronal growth factor depletion, actually reduced in size and resumed their normal function when reincubated with neuronal growth factor. A more recent study from our laboratory demonstrated that etoposide stimulated cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria, despite the presence of 1 mm EGTA (a known inhibitor of MPT) in the reaction buffer (28Robertson J.D. Gogvadze V. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32438-32443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Thus, the current study was undertaken to examine more comprehensively the mechanisms regulating the release of this important apoptogenic protein and the potential effect recombinant Bax protein has on this event. We clearly demonstrate here, using isolated liver mitochondria, that cytochromec release occurs via distinct mechanisms that can be divided into two groups, Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent. As mentioned previously, it is well known that Ca2+ is the basic PT pore activator (16Crompton M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 233-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (2119) Google Scholar). Coincidentally, Ca2+-dependent cytochrome c release occurs when mitochondria experience Ca2+ overload, resulting in the induction of PT. Yet a number of reports in the literature make claims of MPT-dependent cytochromec release in the absence of Ca2+; in fact, many of these studies base this claim on the fact that CsA, a pharmacological inhibitor of MPT, effectively blocks the release of this apoptogenic protein (29Zamzami N. El Hamel C. Maisse C. Brenner C. Muñoz-Pinedo C. Belzacq A.-S. Costantini P. Vieira H. Loeffler M. Molle G. Kroemer G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6342-6350Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 30Hirsch T. Decaudin D. Susin S.A. Marchetti P. Larochette N. Resche-Rigon M. Kroemer G. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 241: 426-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). For example, Kroemer and co-workers (29Zamzami N. El Hamel C. Maisse C. Brenner C. Muñoz-Pinedo C. Belzacq A.-S. Costantini P. Vieira H. Loeffler M. Molle G. Kroemer G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6342-6350Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) recently reported the ability of Bid (also a proapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein) to induce cytochrome c release by opening the permeability transition pore, an effect they base solely on the fact that it was preventable by CsA and other inhibitors of PT. Although this may be the case, a far more accurate and convincing determination of MPT would have included the presence of Ca2+-mediated large amplitude swelling. In short, claims of cytochrome c release via MPT in the absence of Ca2+ are at best improbable. This was our rationale for employing a multiparameter mitochondrial functional analysis, including measurements of swelling, decreases in Δψ, changes in respiration, and the release of accumulated Ca2+, to more accurately link changes in mitochondrial integrity and the release of cytochromec. Consistent with data reported by other investigators, we demonstrate the ability of mitochondria undergoing PT to release cytochromec (31Kantrow S.P. Piantadosi C.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The fact that this effect was more pronounced in KCl versus MSH buffers is likely to be related to the understanding that cytochrome c binding to the inner mitochondrial membrane is weaker in buffers with higher ionic strength (33Cortese J.D. Voglino A.L. Hackenbrock C.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6402-6409Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In addition to cytochrome c release occurring during full-blown MPT, our results indicate that this protein is released even when Ca2+ loading is below the threshold needed to elicit observable manifestations of PT, though different inhibitors of MPT, including ADP and Mg2+, were able to suppress cytochromec release. Thus, it appears that low Ca2+loading is sufficient to induce PT in a subpopulation of mitochondria, and as recently described by Rizzuto et al. (34Rizzuto R. Bernardi P. Pozzan T. J. Physiol. 2000; 529: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) the released Ca2+ is subsequently taken up by neighboring polarized mitochondria. This effect can likely be explained by the inherent heterogeneity of mitochondria (35Beatrice M.C. Stiers D.L. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7161-7171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that make up any particular population of these organelles in terms of their sensitivity to PT. In other words, all mitochondria are not created equally. The mechanisms responsible for Ca2+-independent cytochromec release are less clear, although increasing evidence indicates that certain proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, notably Bax, are able to participate in this process. One possible, and increasingly popular, mechanism is that in the absence of MPT, or any changes in mitochondrial volume, oligomeric Bax inserts and forms a channel in the outer membrane large enough to allow the release of cytochrome c (20Jurgensmeier J.M. Xie Z. Deveraux Q. Ellerby L. Bredesen D. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4997-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar, 36Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Eskes R. Martinou J.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). As our data suggest, monomeric Bax is incapable of stimulating cytochrome c release, which is consistent with reports indicating that oligomerization of Bax is required prior to its insertion in the membrane. It should be noted that in addition to the ability of Bax to stimulate cytochromec release in the absence of any changes in mitochondrial volume, this protein also possesses the ability to enhance MPT-mediated release of cytochrome c. In this case, Bax may interact with the permeability transition pore proteins ANT or voltage-dependent anion channel and hasten the opening of the pore. In fact, it was previously reported that Bax interacts directly with ANT and facilitates ANT opening induced by atractyloside (an ANT inhibitor) and that ANT-deficient yeast are resistant to Bax-induced cell death, suggesting that ANT may also be a functional target of Bax (26Marzo I. Brenner C. Zamzami N. Jurgensmeier J.M. Susin S.A. Vieira H.L. Prevost M.C. Xie Z. Matsuyama S. Reed J.C. Kroemer G.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). At the same time, it was demonstrated that Bax and Bak directly target and open voltage-dependent anion channel in liposomes and induce changes in Δψ (21Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it should be noted that more recent results from our laboratory indicate that Ca2+-independent cytochrome crelease can also occur via mitochondrial swelling stimulated by alterations in osmotic balance. 2V. Gogvadze, J. D. Robertson, B. Zhivotovsky, and S. Orrenius, unpublished data. Recently, evidence was provided that cardiolipin, which is present exclusively in mitochondrial membranes, mediates the targeting of truncated Bid to mitochondria through a previously unknown three-helix domain in truncated Bid and that this interaction is critical for cytochrome c release (38Lutter M. Fang M. Luo X. Nishijima M. Xie X.S. Wang X. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). The involvement of cardiolipin in the release of cytochrome c was also documented by data showing that elevated levels of mitochondrial phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase in cells triggered to undergo apoptosis completely suppressed the release of cytochrome c(39Nomura K. Imai H. Koumura T. Kobayashi T. Nakagawa Y. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that cytochromec release may occur by a two-step process, wherein this protein is first liberated from cardiolipin and then released via specific or nonspecific pores/channels in the outer mitochondrial membrane. In summary, we have demonstrated that mitochondria release cytochromec via distinct Ca2+-dependent or Ca2+-independent mechanisms. In the first case, mitochondrial Ca2+ overload causes swelling, rupture of the outer mitochondrial membrane, and the nonspecific release of cytochromec. In contrast, Ca2+-independent protein release is regulated by the oligomeric form of the proapoptotic protein Bax, is specific for intermembrane space proteins, and occurs without MPT. Importantly, oligomeric Bax also enhances MPT-induced protein release. Which, if any, of these mechanisms predominates under physiological conditions remains unclear. However, it is tempting to speculate that under pathological conditions when the level of intracellular Ca2+ increases, such as during ischemia-reperfusion injury, swelling, rupture, and the release of mitochondrial proteins occurs by PT, whereas during “authorized”; cell death or receptor-mediated killing this release occurs without swelling and proceeds via a Bax- and/or truncated Bid-regulated pathway.

In this study, epidermal growth factor (EGF) induced a coat of hyaluronan and a 3–5-fold increase in its rate of synthesis in a rat epidermal keratinocyte cell line that has retained its ability for differentiation. EGF also increased hyaluronan in perinuclear vesicles, suggesting concurrent enhancement in its endocytosis. Cell-associated hyaluronan was most abundant in elongated cells that were stimulated to migrate by EGF, as determined in vitroin a wound healing assay. Large fluctuations in the pool size of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, the metabolic precursor of hyaluronan, correlated with medium glucose concentrations but not with EGF. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed no increase in hyaluronan synthases 1 and 3 (Has1 and Has3), whereas Has2 mRNA increased 2–3-fold in less than 2 h following the introduction of EGF, as estimated by quantitative RT-PCR with a truncated Has2 mRNA internal standard. The average level of Has2 mRNA increased from ∼6 copies/cell in cultures before change of fresh medium, up to ∼54 copies/cell after 6 h in EGF-containing medium. A control medium with 10% serum caused a maximum level of ∼21 copies/cell at 6 h. The change in the Has2 mRNA levels and the stimulation of hyaluronan synthesis followed a similar temporal pattern, reaching a maximum level at 6 h and declining toward 24 h, a finding in line with a predominantly Has2-dependent hyaluronan synthesis and its transcriptional regulation.

It forms a loose, highly hydrated, gel-like matrix that contributes to the maintenance of the extracellular space and facilitates nutrient diffusion. Furthermore, hyaluronan is involved in cell proliferation and differentiation, produces an environment favorable for migration (1Toole B.P. J. Intern.

The half-life of labeled epidermal hyaluronan in human skin organ culture is ∼1 day (15Tammi R. Säämänen A.M. Maibach H.I. Tammi M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 126-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating fast local turnover by keratinocytes. The importance of the strikingly high concentration and turnover of hyaluronan in the multilayered squamous epithelia is not completely understood, but we have hypothesized that the former is necessary to maintain an extracellular space for the nutritional needs of the more superficial cell layers, whereas the latter allows the dramatic modulation of cell shape that occurs during differentiation and for the high migratory potential of keratinocytes that is activated, e.g. in wound healing (16Tammi R. Ågren U. Tuhkanen A.-L. Tammi M. Progr. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 29: 1-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Unlike other glycosaminoglycans, hyaluronan is synthesized at the inner surface of the plasma membrane by hyaluronan synthase (Has)1 and is extruded through the plasma membrane into the extracellular space simultaneously with the ongoing synthesis (for review, see Ref. 17Weigel P.H.

Chem. 1997; 272: 4787-4794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is one of the most powerful agents that influences the behavior of keratinocytes. EGF transmits its information through the EGF receptor (EGF-R), which belongs to the erbB receptor tyrosine kinase family (39Tzahar E. Yarden Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1377: M25-37PubMed Google Scholar, 40Carraway K.L. r. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Signaling through EGF-R regulates many cellular processes, including cell adhesion, expression of matrix-degrading proteinases, and cell locomotion; these phenomena are all important in skin wound healing. Keratinocyte EGF-R expression is transiently elevated 5–7-fold within 2 days after wounding and returns nearly to baseline within 4 days (41Stoscheck C.M. Nanney L.B. King Jr., L.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 645-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It is also important for keratinocyte proliferation and migration during reepithelization (for review, see Ref. 42Hudson L.G. McCawley L.J. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1998; 43: 444-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Exogenously added EGF and overexpression of EGF-R result in enhanced ligand-mediated migration of keratinocytes and faster reepithelialization (43McCawley L.J. O'Brien P. Hudson L.G. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Aberrant expression or activation of the EGF-R is common and has been proposed to have a role in epithelial tumor progression (44Kolettas E. Lymboura M. Khazaie K. Luqmani Y. Anticancer Res. 1998; 18 (. 392): 385PubMed Google Scholar, 45Lichtner R.B. Kaufmann A.M. Kittmann A. Rohde-Schulz B. Walter J. Williams L. Ullrich A. Schirrmacher V. Khazaie K. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1823-1832PubMed Google Scholar). As in wound healing, the EGF-R may provide an important contribution to the migratory and invasive potential of carcinomas. The migration induced by EGF requires the actin binding domain of EGF-R (46van der Heyden M.A. Van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. de Ruiter N. Verdaasdonk M.A. van den Tweel J.G. Rijksen G. Boonstra J. Joling P. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 234: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and recent studies have shown an important role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in keratinocyte migration as well as in their ability to invade other tissues (47Martin P. Science. 1997; 276: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (3791) Google Scholar, 48McCawley L.J. O'Brien P. Hudson L.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Whereas both increased hyaluronan and EGF signaling have been observed in migrating cells and in wound healing, neither activation ofHas nor production of hyaluronan in response to EGF has been investigated in keratinocytes. In this study, we establish that EGF specifically increases the mRNA level of Has2, resulting in enhanced synthesis of hyaluronan that correlates with enhanced keratinocyte migration in a wounding assay. Interestingly, a large proportion of the newly synthesized hyaluronan of EGF-treated cells resides in intracellular vesicle-like structures, suggesting that a significant proportion of Has2-directed hyaluronan is endocytosed immediately and recycled back into the cell. A newborn rat epidermal keratinocyte (REK) cell line was developed by MacCallum and Lillie (49MacCallum D.K. Lillie J.H. Skin Pharmacol. 1990; 3: 86-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) from neonatal rat epidermal cells originally isolated by Baden and Kubilus (50Baden H.P. Kubilus J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1983; 80: 124-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). REKs were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY) with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), penicillin (50 units/ml) and 1–2 mml-glutamine (all from PAA Laboratories, Linz, Austria) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were trypsinized when they reached confluency using 0.02% EDTA (w/v), 0.025% trypsin (w/v) (Sigma). For biochemical assays and radiolabeling, the cells were grown close to confluency in 6-well plates and incubated in the presence of 20 μCi/ml of [3H]glucosamine, and 100–200 μCi/ml [35S]sulfate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The depletion of glucose in the culture medium by the metabolic acitivity of the cells was estimated from 10-μl aliquots, derivatized with the fluorophore 2-aminoacridone (AMAC) and separated and quantitated by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide slab gels essentially as described (51Calabro A. Benavides M. Tammi M. Hascall V.C. Midura R.J. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) using mannose as an internal standard. Cells were grown in 6-well plates (9.6 cm2/well) in 1 ml of medium and subsequently washed with 400 μl of Hank's solution (HyClone). For each culture, the medium and wash were combined and designated as “medium.” Each cell layer was trypsinized, the resulting suspension removed, and the well was washed with 250 μl of minimum essential medium. Each cell suspension, combined with the washes was centrifuged. The resulting supernatant and two subsequent 250-μl washes of the cell pellet with serum-free medium were combined and designated as “trypsinate.” The resulting cell pellet was designated as the “intracellular” fraction. Carrier (6 μg of hyaluronan, Healon®, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to each sample to improve the recovery of radiolabeled hyaluronan during the purification procedures and gel filtration. Each cell fraction was suspended in 500 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate containing 5 mm EDTA and 5 mm cysteine, pH 6. Cysteine and EDTA were added into each of the medium and trypsinate fractions (5 mm final concentrations). Each sample was treated with papain (Sigma) (200 μg/ml final concentration) at 60 °C for 1.5 h. Papain was inactivated in a boiling water bath (10 min). After cooling, cetylpyridinium chloride (1% in water, 1.2 ml) was added to each sample followed by incubation at room temperature for 10 min. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min, each supernatant was carefully removed by aspiration and discarded. Samples were washed with 1 ml of water, centrifuged, and the supernatants were discarded as above. Each cetylpyridinium chloride precipitate was dissolved in 50 μl of 4 m guanidine HCl, and 900 μl of absolute ethanol was added. Samples were kept at −20 °C for 30 min and then centrifuged. Supernatants were discarded as above, and pellets were dissolved in 30 μl of water. Each purified 30-μl sample was mixed with 4.5 μl of 0.5 m ammonium acetate, pH 7.0, 5 μl of 25 milliunits chondroitinase ABC, and 5 μl of 1 milliunit ofStreptococcus hyaluronidase followed by incubation for 3 h at 37 °C (both enzymes from Seikagaku Kogyo Co., Tokyo, Japan). Each digest was analyzed on a 1 × 30-cm Superdex Peptide column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted at 0.5 ml/min with 0.1m NH4HCO3. The eluent was monitored at 232 nm, and aliquots of the 250-μl fractions were counted for3H and 35S. Undigested glycosaminoglycans, consisting mainly of heparan sulfate, eluted near the void volume, whereas disulfated, monosulfated, and non-sulfated disaccharides were eluted in this order as separate peaks before the total volume of the column. The non-sulfated 3H-labeled disaccharide peak of samples from these keratinocytes indicated the content of hyaluronan (52Tammi R. MacCallum D. Hascall V.C. Pienimäki J.P. Hyttinen M. Tammi M. J.

The carrier hyaluronan produced a disaccharide peak at 232 nm that was used to monitor the recovery and to calculate corrections for any losses in purification. Incorporation of 35SO4 provides a measure of the amount of the chondroitin/dermatan sulfate synthesized during the labeling period. The [3H]galactosamine, derived from [3H]glucosamine, incorporated into the same chondroitin/dermatan sulfate disaccharides provides an estimate of the effective specific activity of the UDP-N-acetylhexosamine precursor pool and hence can be used to determine the chemical content of newly synthesized 3H-labeled hyaluronan, as described in detail previously (53Tammi R.H.

Keratinocytes were cultured in ∼28 cm2 dishes until confluency and scraped into TRIzol®-reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) for total RNA isolation according to the instructions of the manufacturer. RNA was dissolved in a small amount of distilled H2O and quantitated with a spectrophotometer at 260 nm. RNA was analyzed by electrophoresis on 1% formaldehyde/agarose gels and transferred onto Hybond-N™ nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A Has2-specific probe (1200 base pairs) was obtained from human mRNA by RT-PCR using the primers 5′-GAAACAGCCCCAGCCAAAGAC-3′ and 5′-CTCCCCCAACACCTCCAACC-3′ and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by PCR. Hybridization was done by following the ULTRAhyb™ hybridization protocol for DNA probes to RNA blots (Ambion, Austin, TX). For RT-PCR, keratinocyte RNA was isolated with the TRIzol®-reagent. Equal amounts were measured with spectrophotometer and were DNase-treated. The RT-PCR reactions were done with the RNA PCR Core Kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Branchburg, NJ). To obtain rat Has1- and Has3-specific primers, cDNA sequences were amplified from rat keratinocyte RNA with mouse Has1 and Has3 specific primers using RT-PCR. The PCR products were cloned into a pSport1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) plasmid and sequenced. Primers for Has1 and Has3 were 5′-GCTCTATGGGGCGTTCCTC-3′ and 5′-CACACATAAGTGGCAGGGTCC-3′, 5′-ACTCTGCATCGCTGCCTACC-3′ and 5′-ACATGACTTCACGCTTGCCC-3′, respectively. Rat Has2- and GAPDH-specific primers (5′-TCGGAACCACACTGTTTGGAGTG-3′and 5′-CCAGATGTAAGTGACTGATTTGTCCC-3′; and 5′-TGATGCTGGTGCTGAGTATG-3′ and 5′-GGTGGAAGAATGGGAGTT GC-3′) were designed from GenBankTM/EBI sequences AF008201 and M17701, respectively. For quantitation of Has2 mRNA, a shortened (internal standard) Has2 cDNA containing the primer binding sites identical to those in the wild-type Has2 cDNA was prepared by PCR. A poly(T)8sequence was tagged into this cDNA at its 3′-end through an appropriately designed Has2-specific downstream primer. Thus afterin vitro transcription treatment, the shortened Has2 RNA strand contained a poly(A)8 tail. The shortened Has2 cRNA was purified with FastTrack™ mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen BV, Leek, The Netherlands), dissolved in a small amount of H2O and quantitated with a spectrophotometer at 260 nm. RT-PCR was done with constant amounts of the wild type and different concentrations of the shortened Has2 RNAs. The resulting products were run on an agarose gel, digitized by a BioDocII™ Video Documentation System (Biometra, Göttingen, Germany), and quantitated by EtBr fluorescence by using Image software (Wayne Rashband, NIH, Bethesda). Keratinocytes were cultured until they just reached confluency. Two lines (∼1-mm wide) crossing each other at right angles were drawn with a 250-μl disposable pipette tip. The migration of keratinocytes to the cleared area was inspected under a microscope. The areas covered with cells were measured before and 18 h after the treatment. The change in the area was counted in pixels using the NIH Image software and converted to mean migration distance (μm) of the cell front. To determine the proliferation rate, about 20,000 REKs were seeded in 400 μl of medium into the wells of a 24-well plate, and grown for 3 days. Then medium was changed and supplemented with 0–200 ng/ml EGF. For each EGF concentration, 2 wells were harvested by trypsin digestion after 24 and 48 h. The cells were then collected by centrifugation, resuspended, and counted in a hemocytometer. Each cell layer to be analyzed was washed with Hank's balanced salt solution (HyClone) and fixed at room temperature for 20 min in phosphate-buffered saline with 2% paraformaldehyde (v/v) for fluorescence microscopy. For electron microscopy and light microscopy with peroxidase detection, a fixative with 2% paraformaldehyde (v/v) and 0.5% glutaraldehyde (v/v) were used. After fixation, the cells were washed three times for 2 min each with 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and then blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin (w/v) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (v/v) in the same buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Hyaluronan staining was done with a specific probe, biotinylated hyaluronan binding complex (bHABC), purified from a 4 mguanidine-HCl extract of bovine articular cartilage after dialysis and trypsin digestion, as described previously (52Tammi R. MacCallum D. Hascall V.C. Pienimäki J.P. Hyttinen M. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28878-28888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The probe is a purified mixture of biotinylated G1 domain of aggrecan and link protein. For regular transmitted light microscopy, the bHABC probe, diluted to 5 μg/ml in 3% bovine serum albumin (w/v), was added to the fixed cells and was incubated overnight at 4 °C. After washing, avidin-biotin peroxidase (ABC-standard kit, Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) was added for 1 h. The color was developed using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) (0.05%) and H2O2(0.03%). Counterstaining was done with hematoxylin for 2 min before mounting in Aquamount (BDH Laboratory Supplies, Poole, England). For confocal analysis Texas Red-labeled streptavidin (dilution 1:1000) was used instead of ABC. The cells were mounted with Vectashield (Vector), and viewed with a PerkinElmer UltraVIEW confocal microscope (Wallac-LSR, Oxford, UK). For a side view of the cells, fixation, incubation with bHABC, and the DAB reaction were done as above. The cells were then dehydrated in graded ethanol and embedded in Spurr's resin. Semi-thin sections were cut perpendicular to the cell layer and stained with toluidine blue. Ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and viewed with a Jeol EX1200 electron microscope. The specificity of the staining was controlled by predigesting the fixed cultures with Streptomyces hyaluronidase (100 turbidity-reducing units/ml, 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, 3 h at 37 °C) in the presence of protease inhibitors (12Tammi R. Ripellino J.A. Margolis R.U. Maibach H.I. Tammi M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1989; 92: 326-332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) or by preincubating the bHABC probe with hyaluronan oligosaccharides (length ∼20 monosaccharides, 3 μg/1 μg bHABC) to reveal possible nonspecific binding of the probe. The optical densities of the DAB-stained cultures were measured as described previously (52Tammi R. MacCallum D. Hascall V.C. Pienimäki J.P. Hyttinen M. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28878-28888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) using a Leitz BK II microscope with a × 16 /0.45 N.A. objective (Leitz, Wetzlar, Germany) and connected with a 12-bit digital camera (Photometrics CH 200, Tucson, AZ). Area-integrated mean O.D. values, including both DAB-positive and background intensities, were calculated for each whole digitized area. In addition, DAB-positive staining areas were estimated from binary images with a cutoff at an O.D. value of 0.13. Based on the DAB-positive area data and the sum of the pixels that fulfilled the positivity criteria, the mean area-integrated O.D. values for the DAB-positive material were calculated. The eukaryotic expression vector pCl-neo (5474 base pairs, Promega, Madison, WI) was linearized withSalI (MBI Fermentas, Vilnus, Lithuania), and a ratHas2 full-length cDNA (4172 base pairs, GenBankTM/EBI AF008201) was ligated into the multiple cloning site of pCl-neo. After transformation, the plasmid sequences were confirmed, and the REK cells were transfected with Has2 antisense plasmids according to the manufacturer's instructions with FuGENE™ 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Transfected cells were cultured in the presence of 500 μg/ml of G418 (Calbiochem-Nevabiochem Corp., La Jolla, CA) until separate colonies about 0.5 cm in diameter were found. The colonies were reseeded and grown in the presence of 250 μg/ml G418 except during the experiments. The presence of the Has2 antisense construct was verified with Southern blotting. Confluent monolayer rat keratinocyte cultures were labeled with [3H]glucosamine and [35S]sulfate for 6 h. The amounts of newly synthesized [3H]hyaluronan, [3H,35S]chondroitin sulfate, and chondroitinase-resistant glycosaminoglycans (mainly heparan sulfate) in medium were determined using the double label method described under “Experimental Procedures.” Hyaluronan synthesis rate was highest when keratinocytes were cultured in medium containing 20 ng/ml EGF (Fig. 1). When the concentration of EGF was further increased, the stimulation of hyaluronan synthesis decreased somewhat but remained ∼2-fold higher than the basal level. The synthesis of other glycosaminoglycans (heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate) was not altered appreciably by EGF treatment. Subsequent experiments used the optimal concentration of 20 ng/ml EGF. Because serum also stimulates hyaluronan synthesis, we examined the interactive effects of EGF and serum. In the control cultures, 6 h after the medium change, 10% serum increased the rate of hyaluronan synthesis by ∼70% when compared with cells cultured with 0.5% serum (Fig. 2). In EGF-treated cultures, the presence of 10% serum showed an approximately additive increase in hyaluronan synthesis (compare the Δ increases). This suggested that factors in serum, such as IGF-1 and PDGF that might contribute to increased synthesis, are additive with EGF and that stimulation by EGF is obvious in all serum concentrations. Because the vitality of cells may suffer in extended cultures with low serum concentration, we decided to use 10% serum in later experiments. Previous studies have shown that it is important to correct for precursor dilution by endogenous substrates, as indicated by the marked changes in specific activity of [3H]glucosamine in newly synthesized glycosaminoglycans (Fig. 3 a), to correctly interpret 3H incorporation with this precursor (53Tammi R.H.

The major lipid components of these domains were glycerophospholipids and cholesterol. Glycerophospholipids were 45–75‥ and cholesterol 15–45‥ of total lipids of the domains. This corresponded to 5–17‥ of total cell glycerophospholipids and 15–45‥ of total cell cholesterol. Phosphatidylcholine, mainly dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, was 66–85‥ of all the glycerophospholipids associated with these domains. Consequently, the palmitoyl residue was significantly enriched in the domains. The surface occupied by these structures increased during development. 40–70‥ of cell sphingolipids segregated in sphingolipid-enriched membrane domains, with the maximum ganglioside density in fully differentiated neurons. A high content of ceramide was found in the domains of aging neurons. Then, the sphingolipid/glycerophospholipid molar ratio was more than doubled during the initial stage of development, whereas the cholesterol/glycerophospholipid molar ratio gradually decreased during in vitro differentiation. Phosphorylated phosphoinositides, which were scant in the domains of undifferentiated cells, dramatically increased during differentiation and aging in culture. Proteins were minor components of the domains (0.1–2.8‥ of all domain components). Phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were selectively recovered in the sphingolipid-enriched domain. Among these, Src family protein-tyrosine kinases, known to participate to the process of neuronal differentiation, were associated with the sphingolipid-enriched domains in a way specific for the type of kinase and for the developmental stage of the cell.

In all these developmental events, cell surface properties, determined by membrane components, are of primary importance. Lipids are responsible for the physico-chemical properties of the membrane itself, largely determining its asymmetry, fluidity and plasticity features, and its organization in domains. Moreover, many membrane lipids play more specific functional roles, and are in many different ways directly involved in the machinery devoted to the control of information in the neuronal cell. Inositol phospholipids (5Meldrum E. Parker P.J. Carozzi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1092: 49-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), sphingolipids (6Riboni L. Viani P. Bassi R. Prinetti A. Tettamanti G. Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 153-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 7Huwiler A. Kolter T. Pfeilschifter J. Sandhoff K. Biochim. Biophys.

Rev. 1995; 21: 152-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) are precursors of bioactive molecules. Glycosphingolipids, asymmetrically located in the outer leaflet of the membrane bilayer, are of primary importance as receptors and cell surface antigens (9Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. J. Biochem. 1995; 118: 1091-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). A particular function of lipids at the cell surface is linked to their ability to interact with membrane proteins, such as receptors or ion channels (6Riboni L. Viani P. Bassi R. Prinetti A. Tettamanti G. Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 153-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 10Yates A.J. Rampersaud A. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Glycotechnol. 1992; 4: 174-187Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and to modulate the functional activity of the protein itself. Some membrane lipids undergo segregation, creating a lipid phase distinct from the bulk phase of the membrane. Recent findings indicate that a particular set of lipids and proteins are segregated together within the plasma membrane, forming functional units that are involved in signal transduction processes (12Hakomori S. Handa K. Iwabuchi K. Yamamura S. Prinetti A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: xi-xixCrossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 13Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar). Spontaneous segregation of membrane sphingolipids seems to be the driving force of these structures, hence termed sphingolipid-enriched membrane domains. A functional role for these domains is particularly well documented in neural cells (reviewed in Ref. 14Masserini M. Palestini P. Pitto M. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), where the specific interaction of sphingolipids with protein kinases of the Src family is particularly relevant. The nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases belonging to this family seem to be involved in signaling pathways that regulate the function of postmitotic, terminally differentiated cells. They regulate multiple cell functions, including cytoskeletal organization, cell-substrate, and cell-cell adhesion, and cell-cell communication (15Kefalas P. Brown T.R.P. Brickell P.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 27: 551-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 16Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). In the nervous system, many lines of evidence indicate that they are involved in the process of neuronal differentiation, suggesting a tight link between Src family kinases and neurite extension and guidance. In the developing cerebellum, the expression of c-Src coincides with the onset of neuronal differentiation (17Fults D.W. Towle A.C. Lauder J.M. Maness P.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The expression and activation of c-Src and Lyn are increased during differentiation (18Lynch S.A. Brugge J.S. Levine J.M.

Neuron. 1994; 12: 873-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), participating in the control of neurite extension. c-Src, Fyn, and Yes are enriched in growth cones of neurons and neuroblastoma cells as a complex with other proteins (26Meyerson G. Påhlman S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 332: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). c-Src and Fyn also have a role in the mature synapse, related to the induction of long-term potentiation (27Grant S.G.

A close association between these proteins and sphingolipid-enriched domains has been demonstrated in many cell types, including neurons (29Prinetti A. Iwabuchi K. Hakomori S. J. Biol.

Moreover, several GPI1-anchored proteins, which are usually associated with the sphingolipid-enriched domains, have been implicated in signal transduction mediated by Src family tyrosine kinases. In the present paper, we analyze the changes in lipid composition, turnover, and membrane organization in cerebellar neurons at different stages of development in vitro. The data we obtained clearly indicate a strict correlation between the functional status of the neuronal cell and the level of lipid and protein organization within sphingolipid-enriched membrane domains. Commercial chemicals were the purest available, common solvents were distilled before use, and water was doubly distilled in a glass apparatus. Trypsin, crystalline bovine serum albumin, and all the reagents for cell culture and the cholesterol assay kit were from Sigma Chemical Co., except for basal modified Eagle's medium and fetal calf serum, which were purchased from Flow Laboratories. Anti-phosphotyrosine mouse monoclonal IgG2bantibody, anti-c-Src goat polyclonal IgG (N-16), anti-c-Src (SRC 2), anti-Lyn, anti-Fyn, anti-Akt1/2, anti-PI3K (p110) rabbit polyclonal IgG antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and Protein A/G PLUS-agarose were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Sphingosine was prepared from cerebroside (33Carter H.E. Rothfus J.A. Gigg R. J. Lipid Res. 1961; 2: 228-234Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Standard sphingolipids and glycerophospholipids were extracted from rat brain, purified, and characterized (34Tettamanti G. Bonali F. Marchesini S. Zambotti V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 296: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). [1-3H]Sphingosine was prepared by specific chemical oxidation of the primary hydroxyl group of sphingosine followed by reduction with sodium boro[3H]hydride (35Toyokuni T. Nisar M. Dean B. Hakomori S. J. Label. Compd. Radiopharm. 1991; 29: 567-574Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (radiochemical purity over 98‥; specific radioactivity 2 Ci/mmol). [32P]Orthophosphate (carrier-free) and [35S]methionine (specific radioactivity 1175 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and PerkinElmer Life Sciences, respectively.3H-Labeled lipids were extracted from [1-3H]sphingosine-fed cells, purified, characterized, and used as chromatographic standards. Granule cells, obtained from the cerebella of 8-day-old Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats, were prepared and cultured as described previously (36Gallo V. Ciotti M. Coletti A. Aloisi F. levi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7919-7923Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 37Thangnipon W. Kingsbury A. Webb M. Balazs R. Dev.

The cells were plated in 100-mm dishes at a density of 9 × 106 cells/dish and cultured with 10 ml of basal modified Eagle's medium containing 10‥ fetal calf serum for up to 17 days. After the 8th day in culture, the medium was supplemented with 1 mg/ml glucose. Cell viability was assessed by the Trypan blue exclusion method. Primary cultures from 8-day-old rat cerebellum are greatly enriched in neurons. Contamination by non-neuronal cells (mainly astrocytes), as determined by immunological and morphological criteria, is below 5‥ (37Thangnipon W. Kingsbury A. Webb M. Balazs R. Dev. Brain Res. 1983; 11: 177-189Crossref Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 38Kingsbury A.E. Gallo V. Woodhams P.L. Balazs R. Dev. Brain Res. 1985; 17: 17-25Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The replication of non-neuronal cells was prevented by adding 10 μm cytosine arabinoside to the culture medium. In these cultures, about 90‥ of the cells are immature excitatory granule cells. The cultures also contain about 5‥ γ-aminobutyric acid-ergic, inhibitory interneurons. Rat cerebellar granule cells in culture immediately start to differentiate and spontaneously undergo a developmental pattern that resembles that of cerebellar neurons in vivo, but in a condensed time scale, reaching a mature state after 8 days. The experiments were performed at three different stages of neuronal development in culture. The 2nd day in culture corresponded to the initial stage of neuronal differentiation and neuritogenesis. At this stage, the cells already emit short neurite-like processes (38Kingsbury A.E. Gallo V. Woodhams P.L. Balazs R. Dev. Brain Res. 1985; 17: 17-25Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The 8th day in culture corresponded to morphologically and biochemically fully differentiated neurons; the cells are mostly grouped in large aggregates, connected by a complex net of fasciculated fibers. The progressive formation of axo-axonic synapses was observed. From the biochemical point of view, granule cells at this stage of in vitro development are characterized by the expression of voltage-dependent sodium channels, neurotransmitter receptors, neuronal surface sialoglycoproteins. Moreover, they acquire the ability to synthesize and release glutamate under depolarizing conditions (36Gallo V. Ciotti M. Coletti A. Aloisi F. levi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7919-7923Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 39Balasz R. Gallo V. Kingsbury A. Brain Res. 1988; 468: 269-276PubMed Google Scholar). The 17th day in culture corresponded to a late stage of neuronal development, characterized by the onset of age-induced apoptotic death of cerebellar granule cells (40Ishitani R. Sunaga K. Hirano A. Saunders P. Katsube N. Chuang D.-M. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 928-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Thus, the primary cultures are a valuable model for the study of neuronal development in vitro. Typical protein content at these times was 240, 700, and 770 μg of protein/dish. Cells (4–7 × 107) at the 2nd, 8th, and 17th day in culture were harvested and lyophilized. Lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol 2:1 (v/v), and the total lipid extract was subjected to a two-phase partitioning as previously described (41Riboni L. Bassi R. Sonnino S. Tettamanti G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 188-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), resulting in the separation of an aqueous phase containing gangliosides and in an organic phase containing all other lipids. The ganglioside content was determined in the aqueous phase as lipid-bound sialic acid by the method of Svennerholm (42Svennerholm L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 24: 604-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar). The phospholipid content was determined in the organic phases as phosphate after perchloric acid digestion by the method of Bartlett (43Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gangliosides from the aqueous phases and phospholipids, cholesterol, and ceramide from the organic phases were separated by HPTLC as described below. Identification of lipids after separation was assessed by comigration with standard lipids and confirmed by their susceptibility to enzymatic and chemical treatments as previously described (44Prinetti A. Chigorno V. Tettamanti G. Sonnino S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11658-11665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). After chromatographic separation, compounds were chemically detected and their amounts were determined by densitometry as described below. The mass lipid composition of the sphingolipid-enriched membrane fractions was calculated on the basis of the endogenous lipid content in the cell homogenate and the percent distribution of the radioactivity associated with each lipid species in the fraction, as described below. Cells at the day of preparation (0 day in culture), at the 6th and at the 15th day in culture, were incubated in the presence of 3 × 10−8m[1-3H]sphingosine (5 ml/dish) in cell-conditioned medium for a 2-h pulse followed by a 48-h chase. Under these conditions, free radioactive sphingosine was hardly detectable in the cells, and all sphingolipids and phosphatidylethanolamine (obtained by recycling of radioactive ethanolamine formed in the catabolism of [1-3H]sphingosine) were metabolically radiolabeled (30Prinetti A.

Cells at the 1st, 7th, and 16th day in culture were preincubated in methionine-free medium for 2 h and subsequently incubated in the presence of 25 μCi/ml l-[35S]methionine (5 ml/dish) for 20 h, to achieve steady-state radiolabeling of proteins (44Prinetti A.

Cells at the 2nd, 8th, and 17th day in culture were incubated in the presence of 50 μCi/ml carrier-free [32P]orthophosphate (5 ml/dish) in phosphate-free culture medium for 4 h (44Prinetti A.

Neurochem. 1990; 55: 913-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These experimental conditions allowed introduction of radioactivity into phosphoproteins and glycerophospholipids, these latter including the very minor ones, such as the phosphorylated phosphoinositides (47Sarafian T. Verity A.M. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 913-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). After metabolic radiolabeling with [1-3H]sphingosine, or [35S]methionine, or [32P]orthophosphate, at the 2nd, 8th, and 17th days in culture cells were subjected to ultracentrifugation on discontinuous sucrose gradients as previously described (44Prinetti A. Chigorno V. Tettamanti G. Sonnino S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11658-11665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested, lysed in lysis buffer (1‥ Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 75 milliunits/ml aprotinin, 5–8 × 107cells/ml) and Dounce homogenized (10 strokes, tight). Cell lysate was centrifuged (5 min, 1300 × g) to remove nuclei and cellular debris. The postnuclear fraction was mixed with an equal volume of 85‥ sucrose (w/v) in 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, placed at the bottom of a discontinuous sucrose concentration gradient (30–5‥) in the same buffer, and centrifuged (17 h, 200,000 × g) at 4 °C. After ultracentrifugation, eleven fractions were collected starting from the top of the tube. The light-scattering band located at the interface between 5 and 30‥ sucrose and corresponding to fraction 5 was regarded as the sphingolipid-enriched membrane fraction (SEMF) (44Prinetti A. Chigorno V. Tettamanti G. Sonnino S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11658-11665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The entire procedure was performed at 0–4 °C in ice immersion. The cell lysate, postnuclear supernatant, and sucrose gradient fractions obtained after cell metabolic radiolabeling were analyzed to determine the content of radiolabeled lipids. Samples were dialyzed and lyophilized, and lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol 2:1 (v/v) (41Riboni L. Bassi R. Sonnino S. Tettamanti G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 188-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The total lipid extract was analyzed by HPTLC as described below, followed by radioactivity imaging for quantification of radioactivity. Identification of lipids separated by HPTLC was accomplished by comigration with standard lipids and confirmed by susceptibility of compounds to following enzymatic and chemical treatments (44Prinetti A. Chigorno V. Tettamanti G. Sonnino S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11658-11665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). A sample of the lipid extract was treated at 37 °C for 2 h, in 50 μl of water, in the presence of 1 milliunit of Vibrio choleraesialidase, to yield GM1. Sphingomyelin, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylcholine were purified according to the HPTLC-blotting technique previously reported (48Taki T. Handa S. Ishiwaka D. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 223: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar): they were separated by HPTLC, identified by spraying with primulin, blotted to PVDF membrane where the corresponding bands were cut and subjected to elution. Sphingomyelin was treated at 37 °C overnight in 30 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.05‥ sodium deoxycholate, in the presence of 11 milliunits ofBacillus cereus sphingomyelinase, to yield ceramide; phosphatidylethanolamine was characterized following its degradation under alkaline conditions. The enzymatic or chemical reaction mixtures were separated by HPTLC, and the reaction products were identified by chromatographic comparison with standard lipids. 3H-Lipids were separated by monodimensional HPTLC carried out with the solvent systems chloroform/methanol/0.2‥ aqueous CaCl2, 50:42:11 or 55:45:10 (v/v). Endogenous gangliosides were separated by bidimensional HPTLC using the solvent system chloroform/methanol/0.2‥ aqueous CaCl2, 50:42:11 for the 1st and 2nd run, with intermediate exposure to ammonia vapors as previously described (49Sonnino S. Ghidoni R. Chigorno V. Masserini M. Tettamanti G. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 128: 104-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), to allow the detection of alkali-labile species. Endogenous phospholipids or [32P]lipids were separated by mono- or bidimensional HPTLC using the following solvent systems and conditions (44Prinetti A. Chigorno V. Tettamanti G. Sonnino S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11658-11665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Monodimensional HPTLC: (a) chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water, 30:20:2:1 (v/v), for the separation of PE, phosphatidylinositol, PS, PC, and sphingomyelin; (b) chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water, 40:15:13:12:8 (v/v), to specifically analyze the content of phosphatidylinositol phosphates; the separation was carried out on potassium oxalate-impregnated HPTLC plates. Bidimensional HPTLC: (a) first run, chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water, 30:20:2:1 (v/v); second run, chloroform/methanol/acetone/acetic acid/water, 10:2:4:2:1 (v/v), with intermediate exposure to HCl vapors for 15 min; this bidimensional HPTLC system allowed the analysis of plasmalogens in the glycerophospholipid mixture. Ganglioside and glycerophospholipid species were quantified after separation on HPTLC followed by specific detection with ap-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde reagent (50Partridge S.M. Biochem. J. 1948; 42: 238-248Crossref Scopus (456) Google Scholar), or a molybdate reagent (51Vaskovsky V.E. Kostetsky E.Y. J. Lipid Res. 1968; 9: 396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. The relative amounts of each ganglioside or of each phospholipid were determined by densitometry, and their mass content was calculated on the basis of the percent distribution and total ganglioside and phospholipid content, determined as described above. Cholesterol and ceramide were separated by monodimensional HPTLC using the solvent systems hexane/diethylether/acetic acid, 80:20:1, and hexane/chloroform/acetone/acetic acid, 10:35:10:1, respectively. Cholesterol and ceramide were quantified after separation on HPTLC followed by visualization with 15‥ concentrated sulfuric acid in 1-butanol. The quantities of cholesterol and ceramide were determined by densitometry and comparison with 0.1–2 μg of standard compounds using the Molecular Analyst program (Bio-Rad Laboratories). In the case of cholesterol, the S.D. of the procedure was ±20‥ in the range of 0.1–0.5 μg, and ±10‥ in the range of 1–2 μg. These values were similar to those already reported for analytical methods based on HPTLC separation and charring of cholesterol (52Klein T.R. Kirsch D. Kaufmann R. Riesner D. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 655-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments, we obtained similar results on the cell cholesterol content using the TLC-sulfuric acid procedure and the cholesterol oxidase assay. The data on the cellular ceramide content obtained by the TLC-sulfuric acid procedure were within 5‥ of those in the literature, obtained by the diacylglycerol kinase method (53Tettamanti G. Prinetti A. Bassi R. Viani P. Giussani P. Riboni L. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1996; 14: 263-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The fatty acid composition of the total lipids extracted from cell lysates and from the sphingolipid-enriched sucrose gradient fractions prepared from cerebellar granule cells at the 8th day in culture was determined by GC and GC-MS. Samples of the lipid extracts were dissolved in 0.5 ml of methanol/5 m HCl, 9:1 (v/v), and maintained at 75° for 16 h. Fatty acid methyl esters were extracted three times with 1.5 ml of n-hexane. The hexane solution was dried, and the residue was dissolved in 50 μl of dichloromethane. Fatty acid methyl esters were separated on a 25-m SPB-5 capillary column using a Dani-3865 gas chromatograph, equipped with a program temperature vap"

Disruption of pacSreduced copper tolerance but enhanced silver tolerance, andpacS-mediated restoration of copper tolerance was used to select transformants. Disruption of ctaA caused no change in copper tolerance but reduced the amount of copper cell−1. In cultures supplemented with 0.2 μmcopper, photooxidation of cytochrome c6 (PetJ) was depressed in wild-type cells but remained elevated in bothSynechocystis PCC 6803(ctaA) andSynechocystis PCC 6803(pacS). Conversely, plastocyanin transcripts (petE) were less abundant in both mutants at this [copper]. Synechocystis PCC 6803(ctaA) and Synechocystis PCC 6803(pacS) showed increased iron dependence with impaired growth in deferoxamine mesylate (iron chelator)-containing media. Double mutants also deficient in cytochromec6, Synechocystis PCC 6803(petJ,ctaA) and Synechocystis PCC 6803(petJ,pacS), were viable, but the former had increased copper dependence with severely impaired growth in the presence of bathocuproinedisulfonic acid (copper chelator). Analogous transporters are likely to supply copper to plastocyanin in chloroplasts.

Analogous transporters are likely to supply copper to plastocyanin in chloroplasts. open reading frame(s) kilobase Cyanobacteria contain internal thylakoid membranes where oxygen-evolving photosynthetic electron transport occurs. Respiratory electron transport occurs in both thylakoid and plasma membranes (1Peschek G.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 635: 470-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thylakoid membranes contain two protein complexes that include photosystems II and I. Within photosynthetically active cells, mobile soluble carriers shuttle electrons between these two complexes. Some cyanobacteria and green algae (see Refs. 2Kerfeld C.A. Krogmann D.W. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 397-425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 3Moseley J. Quinn J. Eriksson M. Merchant S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2139-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar and references therein) adapt to copper deficiency by exploiting alternative carriers. In copper-sufficient Synechocystis PCC 6803, electrons transfer between the complexes via copper in plastocyanin (PetE) whereas under copper deficiency heme iron in cytochromec6 (PetJ) is used (4Zhang L. McSpadden B. Pakrasi H.B. Whitmarsh J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19054-19059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both PetE and PetJ are located “inside” the thylakoid lumen. One subset of proteins is imported into cyanobacterial (and plant chloroplast) thylakoids via the Sec system, whereas others are imported via a ΔpH-dependent pathway (28Bogsch E. Brink S. Robinson C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3851-3859Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The latter transports folded proteins, and its substrates tend to be proteins that require complex cofactors, thereby avoiding separate thylakoid import of the cofactors. Plastocyanin is imported using Sec indicating that a copper delivery system into this compartment is required whenSynechocystis PCC 6803 switches from PetJ to PetE. Higher plant chloroplasts rely exclusively on plastocyanin for electron transport between the two photosystems (2Kerfeld C.A. Krogmann D.W. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 397-425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore thylakoid copper import is predicted to be especially important in higher plants. Copper can impair cell function by associating with adventitious sites or engaging in “elicit” redox chemistry. In recent years, it has become apparent that there are efficient systems to deliver intracellular copper while avoiding adverse interactions en route (5O'Halloran T.V. Cizewski-Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25057-25060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). These include transporters and copper chaperones that target specific intracellular compartments and/or apoproteins (5O'Halloran T.V. Cizewski-Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25057-25060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). How is copper supplied to plastocyanin? The human copper transporters MNK and WND, aberrant in Menkes and Wilson diseases, respectively, are two (prominent) members of a subgroup of P-type ATPases (6Pedersen P.L. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 146-150Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (822) Google Scholar) often termed P1- (7Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) or CPx-type (8Solioz M. Vulpe C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 237-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). CPx-type ATPases transport larger metal ions, with the founder, CadA from Staphylococcus aureus, exporting Cd2+ (9Nucifora G. Chu L. Misra T.K. Silver S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3354-3544Crossref Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Known representatives include the bacterial copper transporters CopA and CopB; CCC2 that transports copper in yeast; ZntA from Escherichia coli that exports zinc but also lead and cadmium; ZiaA, zinc; and CoaT, cobalt (reviewed in Refs. 10Silver S. Phung L.T. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 753-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar and 11Gatti D. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34009-34012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). At present, the metal ion transported and the direction of transport cannot be predicted from the sequence of a CPx-type ATPase. We have previously characterized two of the four ORFs1 encoding deduced CPx-type ATPases in the genome of Synechocystis PCC 6803 (12Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N. Hirosawa M. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S. Kimura T. Hosouchi T. Matsuno A. Muraki A. Nakazaki N. Naruo K. Okumura S. Shimpo S. Takeuchi C. Wada T. Watanabe A. Yamada M. Yasuda M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2122) Google Scholar), ZiaA (slr0798) (13Thelwell C. Robinson N.J. Turner-Cavet J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10728-10733Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and CoaT (slr0797) (14Rutherford J.C. Cavet J.S. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25827-25832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), but ORFs sll1920 and slr1950 remained uncharacterized. Similarity of the deduced products of sll1920 and slr1950 with PacS (15Kanamaru K. Kashiwagi S. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and CtaA (16Phung L.T. Ajlani G. Haselkorn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9651-9654Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), respectively, from SynechococcusPCC 7942, encouraged a prediction that these polypeptides contribute to copper homeostasis. We report that this is correct and designate theSynechocystis genes pacS and ctaA. However, disruption of pacS or ctaA inSynechocystis PCC 6803 confers different phenotypes (in part) to those observed in Synechococcus PCC 7942. PacS is located in thylakoid membranes in Synechococcus PCC 7942 (15Kanamaru K. Kashiwagi S. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), but the direction of copper transport by PacS is unknown.Synechococcus PCC 7942, unlike Synechocystis PCC 6803, does not show copper-dependent switching between cytochrome c6 and plastocyanin (see Ref. 2Kerfeld C.A. Krogmann D.W. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 397-425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we describe experiments showing that the action of bothpacS and ctaA in Synechocystis PCC 6803 is negative with respect to the photooxidation of cytochromec6 and positive toward the accumulation of plastocyanin, petE, transcripts in copper-containing medium. Both of these transporters contribute toward the substitution of copper (in place of iron) for photosynthetic electron transport in the thylakoid, consistent with inward copper transport by both. Deletion ofctaA impairs cellular copper accumulation. Deletion ofpacS confers copper sensitivity but silver resistance, which is interpreted in the context of metal ion sequestration within thylakoids. Structural features that confer metal specificity are considered. Synechocystis PCC 6803 was grown either in liquid BG-11 medium or on medium C plates (17Kratz W.A. Myers J. Am. J. Bot. 1995; 42: 282-287Crossref Google Scholar) using previously described conditions (14Rutherford J.C. Cavet J.S. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25827-25832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). BG-11 contains 0.3 μm copper. A variant BG-11 (BG-11-C), lacked copper as a microelement but was supplemented with defined [copper]. Growth under iron limitation was analyzed using medium lacking normal [iron] and containing 0.2 μm copper (BG-11-FC). Cells were transformed to antibiotic resistance as described by Hagemann and Zuther (18Hagemann M. Zuther E. Arch. Microbiol. 1992; 158: 429-434Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar).E. coli strains JM101 or SURE (Stratagene) were grown in Luria-Bertani medium (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA manipulations were performed as described by Sambrook et al. (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was isolated from Synechocystis PCC 6803 using a protocol described previously for the isolation of DNA from plant cell cultures but excluding CsCl gradients (20Turner J.S. Morby A.P. Whitton B.A. Gupta A. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4494-4498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots (10 μg) of DNA were digested with restriction endonucleases, resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to nylon filters, and washed (after probing) to a stringency of 0.5× SSC, 0.1% w/v SDS at 65 °C (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). SynechocystisPCC 6803 genomic DNA was used as template for polymerase chain reaction with primers 5′-GAAGAATTCAGTAAACCGAAGAGGGGATAG-3′ and 5′-GAAGGATCCTTGGCCGGGGAATACCCATGCAG-3′. The pacS amplification product (2.36 kb) was ligated to pGEM-T (Promega) to create pSTNR-2. A 1.26-kbBamHI fragment of pUK4K (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) containing a kanamycin resistance gene was incubated with the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I and the “blunt-ended” fragment ligated to a unique MscI site (within sll1920) of pSTNR-2, creating pIN-PACS.Synechocystis PCC 6803 was transformed to kanamycin resistance following incubation with pIN-PACS, transformants selected on solid medium containing 25 μg ml−1 kanamycin prior to growth in liquid medium containing 50 μg ml−1 kanamycin. Interruption of pacS by insertion of the kanamycin resistance gene in all copies of the Synechocystis PCC 6803 chromosome was confirmed by Southern analysis and probing with a32P-labeled fragment of pacS and the strain designatedSynechocystis PCC 6803(pacS). Subsequently, plasmid pSTNR-2 was used to reintroduce pacS into the chromosome ofSynechocystis PCC 6803(pacS), and these transformants were selected on solid medium supplemented with 3 μm copper (no kanamycin). An analogous procedure (to that described for pacS) was used with primers 5′-GAAGAATTCCGGTTAACAGCAAGGGAGC-3′ and 5′-GAAGGATCCGTATGAAACCCGTCTCCAAG-3′, generating a 2.21-kb ctaA product and subsequently plasmid pSTNR-1. The kanamycin resistance gene was ligated to a unique SmaI site in the pSTNR1 insert to generate plasmid pIN-CTAA. Interruption of ctaA was confirmed by Southern analysis and the strain designated SynechocystisPCC 6803(ctaA). An analogous procedure (to that described for pacS and ctaA) was used but with petJ-specific primers 5′-GAAGGATCCGCTGTTAGCTTGCCAAATACTGGG-3′ and 5′-GAAGAATTTCGAAATGGAGCCCTAGGTATGGTGA-3′, generating plasmid pSTNR-3. The chloramphenicol resistance gene was ligated to a uniqueNheI site (in petJ) to generate plasmid pIN-PETJ. The transporter mutants, Synechocystis PCC 6803(pacS) andSynechocystis PCC 6803(ctaA), were transformed to chloramphenicol resistance following incubation with pIN-PETJ, transformants selected on solid medium containing 7.5 μg ml−1 chloramphenicol (and 50 μg ml−1kanamycin) prior to growth in liquid medium containing the same concentration of antibiotic. Interruption of petJ was confirmed by Southern analysis and the strains designated SynechocystisPCC 6803(petJ,pacS) and Synechocystis PCC 6803(petJ,ctaA). Logarithmically growing cultures were subcultured on alternate days (to ∼1 × 106 cells ml−1) for a minimum of 7 days (to standardize growth rates). Growth of cultures in metal-supplemented media was examined as previously described (14Rutherford J.C. Cavet J.S. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25827-25832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Growth under copper limitation was analyzed by adding 300 μm bathocuproinedisulfonic acid, 48 h after inoculation with cells derived from cultures of standardized growth rates that had been maintained (at least 7 days) in BG-11-C. To examine effects of iron deprivation, cells were passaged twice through BG-11-FC supplemented with 3 mg ml−1 ferric ammonium citrate and once in BG-11-FC before inoculation into either BG-11-FC or BG-11-FC supplemented with 10 μm deferoxamine mesylate. To examine metal accumulation, aliquots (30 ml) of logarithmically growing cultures in BG-11-C of standardized optical density (A540) were exposed (2 h) to 0.2, 1, and 2 μm copper, and cells were harvested, washed in BG-11-C, and finally resuspended in 1.25 ml of 70% v/v HNO3. Metal contents were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Analyses of cobalt and zinc accumulation used BG-11. Measurements of cytochromes (f plus c6) and of plastocyanin were made by analyses of flash-induced absorbance changes in the visible region using a protocol developed for use with higher plant thylakoid membranes (21Rich P.R. Madgwick S.A. Moss D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1058: 312-328Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 22Rich P.R. Heathcote P. Moss D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 892: 138-151Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in BG-11-C supplemented with specified [copper]. Cell densities were determined by A540, and chlorophyll content was measured as the A665 of chloroform extracts. Similar chlorophyll contents and cell densities were determined for all genotypes and copper treatments. Cells were diluted in BG-11-C medium to a chlorophyll concentration of 25 μg ml−1; required sample volume was 1.5 ml, and pathlength was 1 cm. Saturating actinic flashes were generated using a xenon flashlamp (15-microfarad capacitor at 1000 V; 6-μs halfpeak width) filtered with RG625 glass filters. Two lightpipes (1-cm diameter) were used to deliver a train of four flashes at 5 Hz to both sides of the sample cuvette, and the photomultiplier was protected with BG39, OG530, and 580-nm cut-off filters. Transients were recorded sequentially at 542, 554, 563, and 575 nm after dark adaptation for 2 s before each train of flashes. The cycle of four flashes was repeated 20 times, and the transients at each wavelength were averaged. Changes (ΔA) due to cytochrome b563 at 563 nm, cytochromesf plus c6 (which have sufficiently similar spectra that are deconvoluted together) at 554 nm, P700 at 542 nm, and plastocyanin at 575 nm were obtained by matrix deconvolution using the matrix of extinction coefficient values obtained for higher plants (21Rich P.R. Madgwick S.A. Moss D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1058: 312-328Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This deconvolution can be applied toSynechocystis PCC 6803 without the need to dissipate any generated electric field, because there is no equivalent of the carotenoid bandshift, which would otherwise strongly overlap in this region. Each resultant trace represented the absorbance change at one wavelength of a single component. In all experiments, the measuring beam was switched on 50 ms before recording commenced, and during dark periods the photomultiplier was provided with light from a light-emitting diode of intensity equal to that of the measuring beam. In all samples, the size of the transients did not increase on successive flashes, indicating that there was sufficient P700 to cause a full photooxidation off/c6/plastocyanin with a single flash. Hence, only the 20-replicate average of the first flash transient is shown in the figures. Total RNA was isolated from logarithmically growing cultures in BG-11-C medium containing 0.2 μm copper using an established method (23Reddy K.J. Webb R. Sherman L.A. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 250-251PubMed Google Scholar) and treated with DNase I. Equivalent amounts of total RNA (10 μg) were incubated (65 °C for 5 min) in 60% v/v formamide, 3.6 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 3 mm NaH2PO4, 0.2 mm EDTA resolved on 1.2% w/v formamide-agarose gels (in the same buffer) and transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond-N; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were hybridized to a 32P-labeled fragment of petE, generated using primers 5′-TTAACAATCCTCGCTGGCCTTCTGCTGG-3′ and 5′-TTACTCAACGACAACTTTGCCTACCAT-3′ and of petJ generated using primers 5′-TATTCAACCAAGCTAGCCGAA-3′ and 5′-CCGCTTGATCAAGCACGTAGGCCG-3′ washed with 0.5 × SSC, 0.1% w/v SDS at 65 °C. Total membranes were prepared according to Norlinget al. (24Norling B. Zak E. Andersson B. Pakrasi H.B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) using cells recovered from 50-ml cultures ofA540 0.3 to 0.6, resuspended in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Total membrane pellets were resuspended and homogenized in 200 μl of potassium phosphate buffer supplemented with 20% v/v glycerol prior to storage at −80 °C. Cytochrome oxidase activities were determined using reduced (1Peschek G.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 635: 470-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) 3 to 9 μm horse heart cytochrome c(type VI) in potassium phosphate buffer and reactions initiated by addition of 10 μl of isolated total membranes containing 2 to 10 μg of protein. Oxidation of cytochrome c was determined using ε550 of 29.5 mm−1cm−1 (25Sottocasa G.J. Kuylenstierna B. Ernst I. Bergstrand A. J. Cell Biol. 1967; 32: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar). Mutants, Synechocystis PCC 6803(pacS), were generated by integration of sequences derived from plasmid pIN-PACS, which contains ORF sll1920 interrupted by a kanamycin resistance gene. Growth of Synechocystis PCC 6803(pacS) and wild type was tested in multiple liquid cultures supplemented with a range of levels of cadmium, zinc, cobalt, copper, and silver ions to determine maximum permissive concentrations (data not shown). Only resistance to copper appeared to be reduced inSynechocystis PCC 6803(pacS). Subsequently, growth was examined as a function of time in response to selected concentrations of copper (Fig.1 A). Unlike wild type,Synechocystis PCC 6803(pacS) is unable to grow in BG-11-C medium containing 1 μm copper and shows some inhibition of growth in medium containing 0.3 μm copper. In BG-11-C medium containing 0.2 μm copper,Synechocystis PCC 6803(pacS) has similar growth to wild type (data not shown). Restoration of tolerance to 3 μm copper was used as a selectable marker to identify mutants of Synechocystis PCC 6803(pacS) in whichpacS had reintegrated into the chromosome by homologous recombination following incubation of cells with the corresponding DNA. The genotypes of Synechocystis PCC 6803(pacS), and cells with reintegrated pacS, were confirmed by Southern analysis; the band of 2.8 kb represents hybridization topacS on a larger fragment because of the presence of the kanamycin resistance gene within pacS (Fig. 1 B). Fig. 1 C shows the phenotypes of Synechocystis PCC 6803(pacS), wild type, and cells with pacSreintroduced into the chromosome. There was no significant difference in the copper content of Synechocystis PCC 6803(pacS), compared with wild type, when cells were grown in media containing copper concentrations that allowed equivalent growth (data not shown). An estimation of the maximum permissive concentration of silver for growth of Synechocystis PCC 6803(pacS) suggested enhanced tolerance (data not shown). Growth of SynechocystisPCC 6803(pacS) was examined as a function of time in response to selected [silver] (Fig. 1 A, right panel). Wild type cells were unable to grow in medium containing 0.5 μm silver, whereas Synechocystis PCC 6803(pacS) showed only slightly impaired growth. Growth of wild type cells was significantly impaired in 0.3 and 0.4 μm silver, concentrations that were not inhibitory to thepacS mutants. Mutants with disrupted ctaA were generated by integration of sequences derived from plasmid pIN-CTAA, which contains ORF slr1950 interrupted by a kanamycin resistance gene. Southern analysis confirmed integration of the antibiotic resistance gene intoctaA on all copies of the chromosome (Fig.2 A). Growth ofSynechocystis PCC 6803(ctaA) and wild type was tested in multiple liquid cultures supplemented with a range of concentrations of cadmium, zinc, cobalt, copper, and silver ions to determine maximum permissive concentrations. Tolerance to all metals appeared unaltered (data not shown). Subsequently, growth was examined as a function of time in response to selected concentrations of copper (Fig. 2 B). Neither cell line grew in BG-11 medium supplemented with 2 μm copper, whereas growth of both cell types was inhibited by 1 μm copper to a similar extent. In contrast, disruption of ctaA fromSynechococcus PCC 7942 resulted in increased tolerance to copper ions compared with wild type (16Phung L.T. Ajlani G. Haselkorn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9651-9654Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Cultures of Synechocystis PCC 6803(ctaA) and wild type cells were exposed for 2 h to BG-11-C medium containing 0.2, 1, or 2 μm copper, and significantly less copper was detected in the mutant at the two higher metal concentrations (Fig.3). The total copper content of the mutants after this “short exposure” to 0.2 μm copper was not significantly different from wild type. The cobalt and zinc contents of Synechocystis PCC 6803(ctaA) did not differ from wild type cells following 2 h of exposure to either 8 or 16 μm zinc or 5 or 10 μm cobalt (data not shown). The observation that in some media SynechocystisPCC 6803(ctaA) contains less copper than wild type (Fig. 3) suggests a role for CtaA in copper import. Does CtaA supply copper for PetE, and what influence, if any, does PacS have on the substitution of PetE for PetJ (Fig. 4 A)? Previous workers detected no cytochrome c6 inSynechocystis PCC 6803 containing ∼4 × 106 copper atoms cell−1 grown in 0.3 μm copper (4Zhang L. McSpadden B. Pakrasi H.B. Whitmarsh J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19054-19059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the decrease in ΔA (absorbance deconvoluted at a defined wavelength for a defined component) at 554 nm upon exposure to a pulse of actinic light is attributable to cytochrome f alone, whereas in the absence of added copper this change becomes greater because of an additional contribution at 554 nm because of transient oxidation of cytochrome c6 (4Zhang L. McSpadden B. Pakrasi H.B. Whitmarsh J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19054-19059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (at rest the carrier is reduced). Growth of Synechocystis PCC 6803(pacS) is inhibited by 0.3 μm copper (Fig. 1 A) precluding the use of this [copper] in subsequent experiments. Growth is not inhibited at 0.2 μm copper. Photooxidation of cytochrome c6 (plus cytochrome f) has been compared in BG-11-C containing 0, 0.2, 0.3, and 1 μmcopper (Fig. 4 B). The transient decrease in ΔAat 554 nm is less in 0.2 μm compared with no added copper and similar to that observed in 0.3 μm copper. This implies that plastocyanin replaces cytochrome c6in 0.2 μm copper (Fig. 4 C). Deconvolution at 575 nm (for plastocyanin) revealed a small (consistent with the lesser ε575 for plastocyanin compared with ε554for cytochrome c6) change upon exposure to a pulse of actinic light in cells grown in 0.2 μm copper that was not evident in cells grown without added copper (data not shown). The kinetics of light-induced change in ΔA deconvoluted at 554 nm was compared in Synechocystis PCC 6803(pacS), Synechocystis PCC 6803(ctaA), and wild type cells grown in 0.2 μm copper (Fig. 5). Both of the mutants show a greater change in ΔA at 554 nm than wild type cells exposed to equivalent exogenous [copper] (Fig. 5) and indeed a larger change in ΔA at 554 nm than observed in wild type cells grown in the absence of added copper (Fig.4 C). No light-induced change in ΔA deconvoluted at 575 nm (for plastocyanin) was detected in the mutants (data not shown). Hence these data overall show that usage of cytochromec6 replaces that of plastocyanin in the mutants. Photooxidation of cytochromec6 was unaltered in Synechocystis PCC 6803(ziaA) or Synechocystis PCC 6803(coaT) grown in BG-11-C containing 0.2 μmcopper (Fig. 5 B). Fig. 6 shows that copper super-supplementation partly complements the SynechocystisPCC 6803(ctaA) phenotype with respect to photooxidation of cytochrome c6. In copper-enriched (above 0.2 μm) medium it is presumed that some copper is acquired via other (perhaps nonspecific) metal importers, partly restoring the use of plastocyanin. It has previously been shown (4Zhang L. McSpadden B. Pakrasi H.B. Whitmarsh J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19054-19059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that a decline in photooxidation of cytochrome c6 in copper-containing medium corresponds with a decline in abundance of the PetJ polypeptide and petJ transcript. The abundance of plastocyanin transcripts and polypeptides shows a reciprocal response, increasing in copper (2Kerfeld C.A. Krogmann D.W. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 397-425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Zhang L. McSpadden B. Pakrasi H.B. Whitmarsh J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19054-19059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 5 B imply more electron flow through cytochrome c6 inSynechocystis PCC 6803(pacS) andSynechocystis PCC 6803(ctaA) and hence predict less plastocyanin and less petE transcripts. In cells grown in BG-11-C plus 0.2 μm copper, petEtranscripts were less abundant in Synechocystis PCC 6803(pacS) and Synechocystis PCC 6803(ctaA) than wild type (Fig. 5 C). Cytochromec6 and petJ transcripts were more abundant in Synechocystis PCC 6803(pacS) andSynechocystis PCC 6803(ctaA) than wild type at this [copper] (Fig. 5 C). It was speculated that a greater dependence upon PetJ rather than PetE for photosynthetic electron transport inSynechocystis PCC 6803(pacS) andSynechocystis PCC 6803(ctaA) may confer a greater dependence on iron. Iron deficiency, generated by subculture either in BG-11-FC media with no added iron or by addition of the iron chelator deferoxamine mesylate, slowed the growth of all cell lines (comparey axis on Fig. 7 Awith Fig. 1 A and Fig. 2 B). Fig. 7 Ashows that Synechocystis PCC 6803(pacS) andSynechocystis PCC 6803(ctaA) are more sensitive to low iron than wild type cells; this was observed using both types of low iron media and in two further replicates (not shown) of each of these experiments. Despite the observed enhanced dependence upon iron, it was possible to obtain, on copper-replete medium, double mutants (petJ,ctaA andpetJ,pacS) in which petJ was insertionally inactivated on all copies of the Synechocystis PCC 6803 chromosome (Fig. 7 B). However, Synechocystis PCC 6803(petJ,ctaA) was sensitive to copper depletion, with (slightly) reduced growth on BG-11-C (data not shown) and severely impaired growth in the presence of the copper chelator bathocuproinedisulfonic acid (Fig. 7 C). Copper is implicated in respiratory electron transport, as well as photosynthetic electron transport. In Synechocystis PCC 6803, cytochrome c oxidase resides at both the plasma and thylakoid membranes, can accept electrons from plastocyanin, as well as from cytochrome c6, and requires copper (1Peschek G.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 635: 470-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, cytochrome oxidase activities were not significantly different from wild type in membranes isolated from eitherSynechocystis PCC 6803(pacS) orSynechocystis PCC 6803(ctaA) grown in 0.2 μm copper (data not shown). When cells were grown in BG-11-C medium, cytochrome oxidase activities were lower (mean 58%) in membranes from Synechocystis PCC 6803(ctaA) compared with wild type in each of eight independent experiments. It is noted that a related copper transporter has recently been implicated in the biogenesis of cytochrome c oxidase in Rhodobacter capsulatus (26Koch H.-G. Winterstein C. Saribas A.S. Alben J.O. Daldal F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 49-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence support roles for PacS and CtaA in the delivery of copper for photosynthetic electron transport inSynechocystis PCC 6803. Plastocyanin is the electron carrier in the thylakoid lumen of higher plant chloroplasts (2Kerfeld C.A. Krogmann D.W. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 397-425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), organelles that share close common ancestors with cyanobacteria (27Palenik B. Haselkorn R. Nature. 1992; 355: 265-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). It is speculated that equivalent copper transporters act in chloroplasts. Evidence that CtaA is involved in (i) copper import and (ii) copper supply for plastocyanin includes a reduction in the copper content ofSynechocystis PCC 6803(ctaA) compared with wild type (Fig. 3), an increase relative to wild type in photooxidation of cytochrome c6 in Synechocystis PCC 6803(ctaA) at 0.2 μm copper (Fig. 5,A and B), a decrease relative to wild type in the abundance of petE transcripts, and an increase inpetJ transcripts in Synechocystis PCC 6803(ctaA) at 0.2 μm copper (Fig.5 C). Impaired copper acquisition in SynechocystisPCC 6803(ctaA), and impaired ability to switch (at 0.2 μm copper) from use of iron in cytochromec6 to copper in plastocyanin, predicts increased iron dependence of Synechocystis PCC 6803(ctaA). This is consistent with an observed reduction in growth of this genotype in low iron (at 0.2 μm copper) (Fig.7 A). More specifically, this predicts enhanced dependence upon cytochrome c6 (PetJ), and Fig.7 C shows that growth of Synechocystis PCC 6803(petJ,ctaA) is severely inhibited by the copper chelator bathocuproinedisulfonic acid under conditions in whichSynechocystis PCC 6803(ctaA) continues to grow. Copper sensitivity of Synechocystis PCC 6803(pacS) (Fig. 1) indicates that PacS is also involved in copper transport. Two CPx-type ATPases, CopA and CopB, have been described in Enterococcus hirae, with CopA involved in copper import and CopB conferring resistance via export (8Solioz M. Vulpe C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 237-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). If PacS were analogous to CopB it would either act negatively or have no effect upon switching to plastocyanin in the presence of copper. However, in common with Synechocystis PCC 6803(ctaA),Synechocystis PCC 6803(pacS) also shows an increase in photooxidation of cytochrome c6 at 0.2 μm copper (Fig. 5, A and B), a decrease in the abundance of petE transcripts coincident with a (less marked) increase in petJ transcripts at 0.2 μm copper (Fig. 5 C), and a reduction in growth in low iron relative to wild type at 0.2 μm copper (Fig.7 A). The requirement for two transporters for efficient switching to plastocyanin is consistent with (i) copper traversing two membranes before holoplastocyanin is made in the thylakoid lumen, (ii) inward transport by both PacS and CtaA, and (iii) location of PacS within thylakoid membranes (Fig. 8). Why does PacS confer resistance to copper? Copper may promote fewer adverse interactions within the thylakoid than elsewhere in the cell because of sequestration by plastocyanin and/or an abundance of anti-oxidant systems in this photosynthetic compartment. Silver resistance ofSynechocystis PCC 6803(pacS) may be caused by less silver binding to, and inhibiting of, thylakoid proteins. Deletion of pacS in Synechococcus PCC 7942 conferred the opposite phenotype, silver sensitivity (15Kanamaru K. Kashiwagi S. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This could relate to differences in the expression of plastocyanin, or differences in the direction of transport by PacS, in the two cyanobacteria. The decline in petE transcript levels in Synechocystis PCC 6803(pacS) suggests that transcriptional switching also requires copper to reach the thylakoid. The presence of multiple CPx-type ATPases in a single organism but differing in metal specificity provides an opportunity to identify structural elements that discriminate between metals. The E. coli zinc exporter (ZntA) is known to also transport lead (11Gatti D. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34009-34012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and deletion of ZiaA confers lead (in addition to zinc) sensitivity, a phenotype not detected in any of the other CPx-type ATPase mutants ofSynechocystis PCC 6803 (data not shown). As illustrated in Fig. 8, the known metal preferences are CoaT, cobalt; ZiaA, zinc and lead; PacS, copper and silver; and CtaA, copper. Both PacS and CtaA contain an extended motif CPCALGLATP surrounding the sequence (CPC) thought to associate with metals during transport. This sequence is conserved in the majority of the CPx-type ATPases that have been assigned a role in the transport of copper. In ZiaA, it is replaced with the motif CPCALVISTP, and a similar extended motif is present in other zinc and cadmium transporters. The amino-terminal cytoplasmic domains of most CPx-type ATPases contain the sequence GMXCXXC (where X is any residue), sometimes repeated (11Gatti D. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34009-34012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Both PacS and CtaA contain a single copy of this motif, but this is absent from CoaT, whereas in ZiaA it is associated with a second putative metal binding region containing repeated HXH motifs (Fig. 8). To what extent (and how) do differences in these regions influence metal discrimination? By analogy to the interaction between CCC2 and ATX1 in yeast (5O'Halloran T.V. Cizewski-Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25057-25060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar), it is speculated that metal donors, metallochaperones, deliver (or acquire) metals to (from) these amino-terminal domains, at least of PacS and CtaA. There is now a quest for ORFs encoding metallochaperones. We thank C. Mullineaux and J. Cavet for advice."
https://openalex.org/W1984780873,"One challenge facing eukaryotic cells is the post-translational import of proteins into organelles. This problem is exacerbated when the proteins assemble into large complexes. Aminopeptidase I (API) is a resident hydrolase of the vacuole/lysosome in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The precursor form of API assembles into a dodecamer in the cytosol and maintains this oligomeric form during the import process. Vacuolar delivery of the precursor form of API requires a vesicular mechanism termed the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway. Many components of the Cvt pathway are also used in the degradative autophagy pathway. α-Mannosidase (Ams1) is another resident hydrolase that enters the vacuole independent of the secretory pathway; however, its mechanism of vacuolar delivery has not been established. We show vacuolar localization of Ams1 is blocked in mutants that are defective in the Cvt and autophagy pathways. We have found that Ams1 forms an oligomer in the cytoplasm. The oligomeric form of Ams1 is also detected in subvacuolar vesicles in strains that are blocked in vesicle breakdown, indicating that it retains its oligomeric form during the import process. These results identify Ams1 as a second biosynthetic cargo protein of the Cvt and autophagy pathways.

These compartments are critical to the proper physiology of the cell. In order to ensure correct function, cells must maintain faithful sorting of resident proteins to each organelle. A substantial amount of information is known about the delivery of proteins to compartments of the endomembrane system including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),1 Golgi complex, and vacuole/lysosome. In brief, proteins can enter the ER post-translationally through proteinaceous channels and transit to other compartments through transient carrier vesicles. However, other compartments are not able to receive proteins through this route. For example, peroxisomes, mitochondria, and chloroplasts maintain a separate mechanism(s) for translocating proteins across their membranes (1Keegstra K. Froehlich J.E. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1999; 2: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 2Rassow J. Pfanner N. Traffic. 2000; 1: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 3Subramani S. Koller A. Snyder W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 399-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). One challenge facing eukaryotic cells is the import of large assembled protein complexes into organelles. Although several organelles have the capacity to translocate folded proteins (4Teter S.A. Klionsky D.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 428-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), in most cases complexes assemble subsequent to import of the individual protein monomers. In contrast, the peroxisome has the capacity for importing oligomeric proteins directly from the cytosol (5McNew J.A. Goodman J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1245-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Several components in peroxisome protein import are currently being characterized, but the actual mechanics of import are not defined (3Subramani S. Koller A. Snyder W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 399-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Both a transient pore/shuttle or a vesicular invagination of the peroxisome membrane could act in conjunction with the known receptor proteins. Although most vacuolar proteins enter the vacuole through a portion of the secretory pathway, the resident hydrolase aminopeptidase I (API) uses an alternative process (6Klionsky D.J. Cueva R. Yaver D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Precursor API (prAPI) is synthesized in the cytosol on ribosomes that are not attached to the ER. Following synthesis, prAPI rapidly assembles into a dodecamer and subsequently into a higher order complex (7Kim J. Scott S.V. Oda M.N. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This complex of dodecamers becomes sequestered by membrane, resulting in the formation of a double-membrane cytosolic vesicle (8Scott S.V. Baba M. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 9Baba M. Osumi M. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Upon completion, this vesicle fuses with the vacuole to release a single-membrane vesicle into the lumen. Following breakdown of the vesicle, prAPI is matured by removal of its propeptide. This import process is termed the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway. The Cvt pathway has been shown to overlap with autophagy (10Harding T.M. Hefner-Gravink A. Thumm M. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17621-17624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 11Scott S.V. Hefner-Gravink A. Morano K.A. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12304-12308Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Autophagy is a degradative process that employs similar changes in membrane topology to sequester cytosol for breakdown and recycling under starvation conditions. During starvation, the level of prAPI increases and the protein is imported to the vacuole via autophagosomes (9Baba M. Osumi M. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). An intriguing question has been why yeast cells have utilized such a complex process as the Cvt pathway for the import of a resident vacuolar hydrolase. One possibility is that the dodecameric structure of prAPI is critical for its stability and/or function. The size of the dodecamer prevents translocation through the ER translocon, necessitating a vesicle-mediated import process. In addition, it has not been known whether other resident hydrolases utilize the Cvt pathway for vacuolar localization. α-Mannosidase (Ams1) is a resident vacuolar hydrolase that has been shown to enter the vacuole independent of the secretory pathway (12Yoshihisa T. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22418-22425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a resident vacuolar hydrolase, one role of Ams1 is to aid in recycling macromolecular components of the cell through hydrolysis of terminal, non-reducing α-d-mannose residues (EC3.2.1.24). In growing wild type cells, a relatively low basal level of Ams1 is synthesized. Under conditions of greater recycling need (i.e. nutrient deprivation), Ams1 levels are induced, and this coincides with induction of the nonspecific delivery mechanism of autophagy. We show in this report that Ams1 forms an oligomer in the cytoplasm. Under nutrient-rich conditions, oligomeric Ams1 is delivered to the vacuole by the Cvt pathway. Under starvation conditions, the up-regulated oligomeric protein is localized through autophagy. Mutants in either pathway are defective in Ams1 import. These results define Ams1 as a second cargo protein that utilizes both the Cvt and autophagic pathways for biosynthetic delivery to the vacuole. Prestained molecular weight markers were from Bio-Rad. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by Operon Technologies (Alameda, CA). The pAM1 plasmid (13Kuranda M.J. Robbins P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4079-4087Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). THY411 (SEY6210ams1Δ::LEU2) was generated by transforming yeast with PvuII-linearized pDelLAMS (described below), which replaces the first third of the chromosomalAMS1 gene with LEU2. The 3×HA-tagged Ams1 strain MHY11 was generated by the integration of a DNA fragment encoding the 3×HA epitope at the 3′ end of the chromosomal AMS1 locus in strain SEY6210 using the ME3 plasmid (provided by Dr. Neta Dean, State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY) as a template (primers: AMSPREHA (5′-AATTGAGACCTTTTGAGATTGCCTCATTCAGGTTGTATTTCTACCCATACGATGTTCCT-3′) and AMSpastHA (5′-TTTACTTATATGTATTTTGTTAAGACTATTTTTGGTTATCAGTCGACGGTATCGATAAG-3′)). Confirmation of the integratedAMS1::AMS1-HA was shown by induction of a ∼132-kDa fusion protein. Integration of the HA epitope at the chromosomal AMS1 locus had no detectable effect on Ams1 activity or its vacuolar localization (data not shown). Strains were typically grown on SMD (0.67% YNB, 2% glucose). Strains were also grown to a density of 0.5 A600 in SMD and were resuspended and grown in SGd (0.67% YNB, 3% glycerol, 0.1% glucose) for induction of Ams1 where indicated. Strains that were induced with 10 or 50 μm copper sulfate were first subcultured three times in SMD lacking copper ions. All media were brought to pH 5.5 with 50 mm each MES and MOPS and supplemented with required amino acids and vitamins. The copper-inducible AMS1 plasmids pCuAMS1(414) and pCuAMS1(424) (pMUH25 and pMUH26, respectively) were generated as follows. Oligonucleotide primers (AM1LOWSPE, 5′-CAAAAACTAGTAATTATGTCATC-3′; and AM1UP2, 5′-CGCTTGCTCGAGCTCCTCTATGTGGATAG-3′) were used to amplify a truncatedAMS1 sequence from pAM1 (13Kuranda M.J. Robbins P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2585-2589Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The 2.9-kb product was ligated into pCR-Blunt (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), resulting in a 6.4-kb construct with flanking SpeI sites (pMUH18). pMUH18 was digested with SpeI, and the resulting 2.9-kb fragment was ligated in the correct orientation at the SpeI site of plasmid pCu414 (provided by Dr. Dennis J. Thiele, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI; Ref. 18Labbé S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), resulting in a 7.8-kb plasmid (pMUH21). To restore the full-length sequence of AMS1, theAMS1 gene was amplified from the pAM1 plasmid (primers: AM1LOWER, 5′-CCTAACTCGTTTAAGGGAGAC-3′; and AM1UPPER, 5′-CAGTGAGGGAGACAAACTCAG-3′). A 3.4-kb product was ligated into pCR-Blunt to generate a 6.9-kb plasmid (pMUH10). The 3.5-kbXhoI/SpeI fragment from pMUH10 was ligated into the same sites of pRS423 (19Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) generating pMUH12. The carboxyl terminus of AMS1 was restored with the 525-base pairSphI/XhoI fragment from pMUH12 ligated into pMUH21 resulting in the centromeric (CEN) plasmid pCuAMS1(414) (pMUH25). The multicopy (2μ) plasmid pCuAMS1(424) (pMUH26) was generated by ligating the 2.9-kb SpeI fragment from pMUH18 into the SpeI site of pCu424 (18Labbé S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), resulting in an 8.5-kb plasmid (pMUH22). The carboxyl terminus of AMS1 was restored as described for pMUH25. pCuAMS1YFP (pMUH29) was generated from pMUH21 and the 780-base pair fragment from pEYFP (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), each digested with SphI/EcoRI. The resulting fusion protein contained the amino-terminal 929 amino acid residues from Ams1 followed by a 14-amino acid linker and YFP sequence. The ams1Δ::LEU2 deletion plasmid, pDelLAMS1, was generated from a 1-kb upstream portion and a 1.5-kb interior portion of the AMS1 gene isolated separately from pAM1 by a XhoI/HindIII digest and aBglII/EcoRI/HindIII digest, respectively. These fragments were ligated in the vector pRS306 (19Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) resulting in a unique HindIII site between the two segments of AMS1. This plasmid was digested with HindIII, and a HindIII fragment containing the LEU2 gene was cloned into this site to generate plasmid pDelLAMS1. The plasmid pCYI-50 (20Johnson L.M. Bankaitis V.A. Emr S.D. Cell. 1987; 48: 875-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) encodes the first 50 amino acids of carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) including the vacuolar targeting signal, fused to the periplasmic protein invertase, lacking its amino-terminal signal sequence in the vector pSEYC306. The plasmid pLJL2 is similar to pCYI-50 but carries the LEU2 gene instead ofURA3. Vacuoles were isolated on a Ficoll step gradient essentially as described previously (21Haas A. Methods Cell Sci. 1995; 17: 283-294Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar) with minor adaptations. Cells were grown in SMD to early log phase, and then ∼500 A600 units were harvested and spheroplasted with 6–10 mg of yeast lytic enzyme. Ninety percent or greater spheroplasting efficiency was determined by comparing theA600 of cells diluted 1:10 in water before and after addition of lytic enzyme. The plasma membrane was lysed using 400 μl of a 0.4 mg/ml solution of DEAE-dextran by being chilled on ice for 2 min, shaken at 30 °C for 2.5 min, and placed on ice again. 3 ml of lysed cell solution containing 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were loaded at the bottom of an ultraclear SW41 tube (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) and overlaid with 8%, 4%, and 0% Ficoll solutions. Vacuoles were collected from the 0%/4% float interface with a Pasteur pipette after a 1.5-h spin at 30,000 × g. Enzyme assays for marker proteins were performed on material loaded onto the gradient and the recovered vacuole float fraction. Cell lysates and harvested vacuoles were assayed for marker enzymes invertase, α-glucosidase, and NADPH-cytochrome c reductase as described (20Johnson L.M. Bankaitis V.A. Emr S.D. Cell. 1987; 48: 875-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Ams1 activity was determined based on established protocol (22Opheim D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 524: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Samples were treated with Triton X-100 (2.5% final concentration), and then the volume was brought up to 400 μl with distilled H2O. 100 μl of 5× substrate mix (200 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.5, 2 mm p-nitrophenyl-α-d-mannopyranoside) was added to start the reaction and was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped with 200 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid, and any particulates were spun down in a microcentrifuge for 5 min. An equal volume of 1 m glycine, pH 10.4, was added to neutralize the reaction before the absorbance at 400 nm was read. Results from assays for each strain were tabulated from a minimum of four independent vacuole preparations. Antisera was generated to Ams1 using two synthetic peptides (Multiple Peptide Systems, San Diego, CA) corresponding to amino acid residues 79–96 and residues 991–1011. These peptides were conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and injected into a New Zealand White male rabbit using standard procedures. Immunoblots were prepared from 8% SDS-PAGE gels as described (16Harding T.M. Morano K.A. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) with 15% methanol in the transfer buffer. Ams1 antiserum was blocked by incubating with ams1Δ cell extract in TTBS (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.8% NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20) for 2–3 h at 4 °C prior to use at a 1:12,500 dilution for 4 h at room temperature. Polyclonal antiserum to the HA epitope was used at a 1:1,000 dilution. API antiserum was described previously (6Klionsky D.J. Cueva R. Yaver D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Quantitation by Vistra kit or use of secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was as described (16Harding T.M. Morano K.A. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar,17Hutchins M.U. Veenhuis M. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4079-4087Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblots were quantified on a STORM PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Strains harboring the pCuAMS1(414) plasmid encoding AMS1 under a copper regulable promoter were grown in SMD in the absence of copper. The presence of this plasmid facilitated the visualization of Ams1 under the indicated growth conditions. Cells were induced with 50 μmCuSO4 for 1 h. Twenty A600units were harvested in log phase and washed in Tris salts buffer (TSB; 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 50 mm KOAc, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2). Cells were transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and resuspended in 250 μl of TSB containing 1 μg/ml pepstatin A and Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitors. Cells were lysed with glass beads for 1 min, and then βOG was added to 2% final concentration and mixed gently with a pipette tip. 200 μl of sample was loaded on a 1.8-ml prepoured 20–50% glycerol gradient made up in TSB and containing protease inhibitors. Oligomeric complexes were resolved at 55,000 rpm for 4 h in a Beckman TLS-55 rotor at 15 °C. Ten supernatant fractions of 200 μl were collected from the top of the gradient and precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid on ice. Fraction 10 may contain some amount of contaminating pellet material. Samples were washed twice in acetone and sonicated in MES/urea resuspension buffer (6Klionsky D.J. Cueva R. Yaver D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) before resolving by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblot and detection of Ams1 or API. A higher molecular mass cross-reactive protein detected by Ams1 antiserum (see Fig.1 B, lane 5) migrated to fractions 3–4 in wild type and cvt2 cells (Fig. 3, A andB). Quantification of these fractions was arbitrarily set to zero for clarity. Protein standards were run on an identical gradient and the peak fraction for each was determined by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of a SDS-PAGE gel. Bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), and catalase (240 kDa), peaked in fractions 3, 4, and 5, respectively, whereas apoferritin (450 kDa), urease (545 kDa) and thyroglobulin (669 kDa) all peaked in fraction 6 of the gradient.Figure 3Ams1 transits to the vacuole as an oligomer. A, wild type (WT) cells harboring the CEN Ams1 plasmid pCuAMS1(414) were grown to early log phase and induced with 50 μm copper sulfate for 1 h. Strain MHY11 (AMS1::AMS1-HA) was grown to early log phase and harvested directly. 20 A600units of cells were lysed with glass beads, mixed with βOG detergent (2% final concentration), and loaded on a 20–50% glycerol gradient. Ten fractions of 200 μl were collected from the top and examined by immunoblot. Immunoblots were probed with anti-Ams1, anti-HA, or anti-API antisera and then quantitated using the Vistra detection reagents as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Ams1 peaked as an oligomeric complex in fraction 6, whereas mAPI peaked at fraction 7 (7Kim J. Scott S.V. Oda M.N. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Protein standards run on an identical gradient included: bovine serum albumin (66 kDa, fraction 3), aldolase (158 kDa, fraction 4), catalase (240 kDa, fraction 5), apoferritin (450 kDa, fraction 6), urease (545 kDa, fraction 6), and thyroglobulin (669 kDa, fraction 6). Note that the diffuse band in fractions 3 and 4 of the gradient detected with peptide antiserum is a cross-reacting contaminant and was not included in the quantification. B and C, oligomerization of Ams1 occurs in the cytosol and is maintained during vacuolar delivery. Native protein extracts from the apg7 andcvt17 mutant strains harboring pCuAMS1(414) were analyzed by glycerol gradients as in A. Ams1 is an oligomer inapg7, a mutant that is defective in vacuolar delivery of Ams1, and in cvt17 that is defective in the breakdown of Cvt bodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For separation of the MHY11 vacuole fraction on a glycerol gradient, purified vacuoles were collected as described above and 10× TSB was added to 1× prior to a 5-min, 4 °C centrifugation step at 13,000 rpm. The pellet containing the concentrated vacuoles was resuspended in 250 μl of TSB plus inhibitors and detergent and mixed, and 200 μl was loaded onto the gradient and collected as above. Confocal microscopy (Leica IRM confocal microscope) images were taken as an average of 4–8 scans of a single focal plane. Cells harboring the pCuAMS1YFP plasmid (pMUH29) were grown to early log phase and induced with 10 μmcopper sulfate for 12 h. 1 ml of cells were then harvested and resuspended with 100 μl of fresh medium containing 4–8 μm FM 4–64 (23Vida T.A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar) for 30 min to label the vacuoles. FM 4–64 was chased to the vacuole for 1 h by the addition of 1 ml of fresh medium. Cells were then washed once in SD−N (containing 10 μm copper sulfate) and incubated in fresh SD−N for 12 h. Most of the characterized vacuolar hydrolases are proteolytically processed upon delivery to the vacuole. The resulting shift in molecular mass provides a convenient means for monitoring delivery to the organelle. We were interested in determining the mechanism of vacuolar delivery used by the resident hydrolase α-mannosidase (Ams1). However, previous analyses of Ams1 have been equivocal with regard to whether this protein is rapidly processed following delivery to the vacuole (12Yoshihisa T. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22418-22425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Yoshihisa T. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5158-5163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine processing of Ams1, we generated antiserum to synthetic peptides corresponding to the deduced amino acid sequence as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We were unable to detect Ams1 synthesized from the chromosomal locus when cells were grown in minimal medium (SMD). This result was not surprising because Ams1 is made at very low levels in the presence of glucose unless cells are subjected to heat shock (12Yoshihisa T. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22418-22425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Opheim D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 524: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 24Yoshihisa T. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5158-5163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, when Ams1 was synthesized from a CEN or 2μ plasmid, we were able to detect a specific band in a dosage-dependent manner (Fig.1 A). Ams1 has a predicted molecular mass of 124 kDa. Previous studies indicated that the initial protein product was 107 kDa and that this was processed to 73 and 31 kDa forms that co-purified (24Yoshihisa T. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5158-5163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we detected a band corresponding to Ams1 that migrated at 122 kDa (Fig.1 B) that is closer in agreement with the expected molecular mass and probably corresponds with the full-length protein. To increase the level of Ams1, we expressed the protein from a CEN plasmid under control of the CUP1 promoter. A 73-kDa cleavage product was not detected in wild type cells grown in SMD (Fig. 1 B,lane 1). After cells were grown to early log phase and shifted to glycerol medium (SGd), a 73-kDa protein was apparent that first appeared ∼12 h after the shift. This band increased in abundance from 12 to 24 h (Fig. 1 B,lanes 2 and 3). Appearance of the 73-kDa species was not seen in a pep4Δ strain (Fig.1 B, lane 4), indicating that it was due to a vacuole-dependent cleavage event in agreement with previous studies (12Yoshihisa T. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22418-22425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the slow kinetics of cleavage and the observation that processing was incomplete, coupled with the fact that this processing event is not required for Ams1 enzymatic activity (12Yoshihisa T. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22418-22425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggest that the cleavage event may be a byproduct of vacuolar localization. Accordingly, processing of Ams1 is not a good indicator for a kinetic analysis of vacuolar delivery. Because Ams1 is not processed concomitant with its delivery to the vacuole, we could not rely on a mobility shift to follow localization. As an alternative approach, we analyzed its localization through subcellular fractionation. Yeast cells were grown to early log phase in minimal medium, and vacuoles were isolated on a Ficoll step gradient as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The efficiency of vacuolar recovery was determined by assessing the invertase activity of a vacuolar targeted fusion protein consisting of a portion of the resident vacuolar protease CPY fused to the marker protein invertase (20Johnson L.M. Bankaitis V.A. Emr S.D. Cell. 1987; 48: 875-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This chimeric construct utilizes the vacuolar targeting signal in CPY to divert the periplasmic enzyme invertase from the secretory pathway to the vacuole. The percentage of invertase activity in the purified vacuole fraction relative to the activity in a total spheroplast lysate provides a measure for the efficiency of organelle purification. Vacuole recovery of the CPY-invertase hybrid protein typically was 20% or higher as compared with the activity in the total fraction. In wild type cells, Ams1 activity in the purified vacuolar fraction was essentially equivalent to the vacuolar recovery based on invertase activity from the CPY-invertase marker (Fig.2 A). This result indicates that vacuole purification is an effective method for monitoring vacuolar delivery of Ams1. We next examined whether Ams1 was delivered to the vacuole in strains defective specifically in the Cvt pathway. The cvt3 andcvt9 mutants accumulate the precursor form of API but are relatively normal for autophagy (11Scott S.V. Hefner-Gravink A. Morano K.A. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

AF151534 macrochromatin body Expressed Sequence Tags data base glutathioneS-transferase The MACROH2A core histones were first observed as two 42-kDa proteins that remained associated with rat liver mononucleosomes in 0.5m NaCl (1Pehrson J.R. Fried V.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1398-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The sequences of cDNAs that encode these proteins revealed that they have a unique hybrid structure consisting of an amino-terminal domain that closely resembles a full-length histone H2A followed by a large nonhistone domain. MACROH2As are released from the nucleosome core at the same salt concentration as conventional H2As and appear to be released as a heterodimer with H2B (1Pehrson J.R. Fried V.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1398-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). This indicates that the H2A region of MACROH2A replaces conventional H2A in the nucleosome core. It was estimated that 1 in 30 nucleosomes in rat liver would contain MACROH2A, assuming one MACROH2A per nucleosome (1Pehrson J.R. Fried V.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1398-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The H2A region (amino acids 1–122) is followed by a short linker region (10 amino acids) and then a region that is rich in basic amino acids (28 amino acids) (see Fig. 1). This basic region resembles basic tails present in other histones and most likely binds DNA. The nonhistone region of MACROH2As is a feature not found in other known core histones. It constitutes 57% of the protein and contains a putative leucine zipper motif consisting of four heptad repeats (1Pehrson J.R. Fried V.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1398-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The majority of the nonhistone region appears to have evolved from a gene of unknown function that originated prior to the appearance of eukaryotes (2Pehrson J.R. Fuji R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 16: 2837-2842Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Among the sequences that are similar to the nonhistone region is a conserved domain present in proteins involved in the replication of RNA viruses (2Pehrson J.R. Fuji R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 16: 2837-2842Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We identified two distinct MACROH2A cDNA sequences (1Pehrson J.R. Fried V.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1398-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and used specific antibodies to assign these sequences to the two MACROH2A proteins that were resolved by electrophoresis (3Pehrson J.R. Costanzi C. Dharia C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 65: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We named these subtypes MACROH2A1.1 and MACROH2A1.2. The nucleotide sequences of cDNAs that encode MACROH2A1.1 and MACROH2A1.2 differed only in a single internal segment that encodes part of the nonhistone region (1Pehrson J.R. Fried V.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1398-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar,3Pehrson J.R. Costanzi C. Dharia C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 65: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and these subtypes are formed by alternate splicing of a single gene, macroH2A1, on mouse chromosome 13 (4). Western blots of nuclear extracts from adult and fetal tissues revealed distinct tissue expression patterns that change during development (3Pehrson J.R. Costanzi C. Dharia C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 65: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Both subtypes are highly conserved in mammals and birds (2Pehrson J.R. Fuji R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 16: 2837-2842Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). These results suggest that MACROH2A1.1 and MACROH2A1.2 differ in some aspect of their function (3Pehrson J.R. Costanzi C. Dharia C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 65: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that the inactive X chromosome of female mammals can be distinguished in interphase nuclei as a large MACROH2A-dense domain called a macrochromatin body (MCB)1 (5Costanzi C. Pehrson J.R. Nature. 1998; 393: 599-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The preferential association of MACROH2A1.2 with the inactive X chromosomes of differentiating female mouse embryonic stem cells is a relatively late event, occurring several days after gene silencing (6Mermoud J.E. Costanzi C. Pehrson J.R. Brockdorff N. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1399-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In female embryos, however, association of MACROH2A1.2 with one of the X chromosomes begins as early as the 12-cell stage (7Costanzi C. Stein P. Worrad D.M. Schultz R.M. Pehrson J.R. Development. 2000; 127: 2283-2289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a time when the trophectoderm cells begin to differentiate. This indicates that MACROH2A1.2 associates with the inactive X chromosome at or near the time of initiation of inactivation in these cells. The only other known feature of X inactivation in preimplantation embryos that occurs before MACROH2A accumulation is the accumulation of Xist RNA (8Sheardown S.A. Duthie S.M. Johnston C.M.

Cell. 1992; 71: 527-542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). The Xist gene is required for the initiation of X inactivation (14Herzing L.B.K. Romer J.T. Horn J.M. Ashworth A.

Dausman J. Strauss W. Jaenisch R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar), but it is not known howXist RNA functions in the inactivation process. The homology of the nonhistone region of MACROH2A to a viral protein involved in RNA replication, together with these results, lead us to hypothesize a possible functional role for Xist RNA in localizing MACROH2A1.2 to the inactive X chromosome (2Pehrson J.R. Fuji R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 16: 2837-2842Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 5Costanzi C. Pehrson J.R. Nature. 1998; 393: 599-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). A connection betweenXist and MACROH2A1 was established in a mouse fibroblast model in which deletion of part of the Xist locus from the inactive X chromosome leads to the loss of MACROH2A1 association (18Csankovszki G. Panning B. Bates B. Pehrson J.R. Jaenisch R. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 323-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Although MACROH2A1.2 is not solely localized to the inactive X chromosome, even in female cells (5Costanzi C. Pehrson J.R. Nature. 1998; 393: 599-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), that association provides a framework for understanding the function of MACROH2A proteins. In our current working model, one aspect of their function is to establish and/or maintain transcriptionally silent chromatin domains. Here we present the discovery of a new MACROH2A subtype, MACROH2A2, encoded by a second MACROH2A gene, MACROH2A2. Analysis of the sequence, tissue distribution, and nuclear distribution of MACROH2A2 suggests a developmental role for MACROH2A subtypes. A Blast search of expressed tagged sequences (dbEST) (19Boguski M.S. Lowe T.M. Tolstoshev C.M. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 332-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar) with MACROH2A1 nonhistone domain sequences was performed, and a unique but clearly related sequence was found. Three representative clones were obtained, and one (clone identification number 50058 from Soares infant brain 1NIB library made from the whole brain of a 73-day-old human female) was sequenced using an ABI 373A sequencer with Taq FS dye terminator chemistry and found to contain the entire open reading frame (GenBankTM accession number AF151534). The amino acid sequence was aligned to the available published MACROH2A1 sequences (1Pehrson J.R. Fried V.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1398-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 2Pehrson J.R.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54908) Google Scholar). The rat macroH2A1 gene was cloned from a rat λ phage library from which five overlapping clones were isolated and mapped by polymerase chain reaction, and intron-exon junctions were sequenced using primers derived from the cDNA sequence (3Pehrson J.R. Costanzi C. Dharia C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 65: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The mouse macroH2A1 gene was previously mapped (4Rasmussen T.P. Huang T. Mastrangelo M.A. Loring J. Panning B. Jaenisch R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3685-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The human MACROH2A genes were discovered in the data base from the Human Genome Sequencing Project using the human cDNA sequences (20Lee Y. Hong M. Kim J.W. Hong Y.M. Choe Y.-K. Chang S.Y. Lee K.S.

MACROH2A1 is in gi 12731492 from human chromosome 5, and MACROH2A2 is in gi 12735407 from human chromosome 10. The nonhistone region of theMACROH2A2 cDNA was amplified with the forward tailed primer GGAAGGATCCCAAAGGACAGCGATAAA and the reverse tailed primer CGAAGAATTCCCCTGCTGGAAAGTGCGG, digested with BamHI andEcoRI, and cloned into pGEX-2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The GST-MACROH2A2 nonhistone region fusion protein was expressed in bacteria, and the thrombin-cleaved protein was isolated as described (5Costanzi C. Pehrson J.R. Nature. 1998; 393: 599-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Antisera were raised in rabbits (Cocalico Biologicals), bound to a fusion protein affinity column, eluted, and passed through a GST-MACROH2A1.2 nonhistone region affinity column to remove cross-reacting antibodies (5Costanzi C. Pehrson J.R. Nature. 1998; 393: 599-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The rabbit antibody against the nonhistone region of MACROH2A1.2 has been described (5Costanzi C. Pehrson J.R. Nature. 1998; 393: 599-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Direct antibody labeling was accomplished using the FluorReporter Texas Red-X, Fluorescein-EX, Alexa Fluor 488, and Alexa Fluor 594 protein labeling kits from Molecular Probes as suggested by the manufacturer. Antibodies against connexin 26 (N-19) and connexin 32 (C-20) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. To compare the relative levels of the MACROH2A subtypes in mouse tissue, nuclei were isolated from adult mouse liver and kidney following the procedure of Blobel and Potter (23Blobel G. Potter V.R. Science. 1966; 154: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar), except that the nuclear isolation buffer was 0.4 m mannitol, 60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 0.15 mmspermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 15 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.4, containing 0.3 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and 6 μg/ml aprotinin, and the nuclei were centrifuged through a lower layer that contained 2 m, rather than 2.3 m, sucrose. Nuclear extracts were prepared (2Pehrson J.R. Fuji R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 16: 2837-2842Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and equivalent amounts of the extracts (in terms of DNA content, as determined by absorbance at 260 nm) were loaded, except for the MACROH2A2 blot, where 2.5 times more liver extract was loaded to detect a band. Proteins were separated by SDS gel electrophoresis and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (3Pehrson J.R. Costanzi C. Dharia C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 65: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The blocked membranes were incubated overnight with the primary antibody followed by a secondary peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG, and the signal was detected using SuperSignal West Femto maximum sensitive substrate (Pierce). To compare the specificity of labeled versus unlabeled MACROH2A antibodies, nuclei were isolated from adult mouse kidneys, and proteins were separated and transferred as described above. One strip was stained directly with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, the others were incubated overnight with the primary antibody followed by a secondary alkaline phosphatase-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit IgG, and the signal was detected using the 1-Step NBT/BCIP detection system (Pierce). Immunofluorescence on adult mouse frozen tissue sections was performed as described (5Costanzi C. Pehrson J.R. Nature. 1998; 393: 599-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence/fluorescence in situhybridization on adult mouse frozen tissue sections was performed as described (5Costanzi C. Pehrson J.R. Nature. 1998; 393: 599-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). We identified cDNAs in dbEST (19Boguski M.S. Lowe T.M. Tolstoshev C.M. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 332-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar) that encode a new MACROH2A subtype that we named MACROH2A2. A full-length human cDNA clone was sequenced, and the encoded amino acid sequence was aligned with the published MACROH2A1 sequences (Fig. 1 a). Although MACROH2A2 has the same basic architecture as the MACROH2A1 subtypes, it is not encoded by the MACROH2A1 gene, because its cDNA and amino acid sequences differ from the MACROH2A1 subtypes along its entire length. Overall, the amino acid sequence of MACROH2A2 is 68% identical to that of MACROH2A1.2. The H2A region of MACROH2A2 is significantly more similar to the H2A region of the MACROH2A1 subtypes, 84% identical, than it is to conventional H2A, 66% identical to a human H2A (Fig. 1 b). The amino acid sequence of the basic region of MACROH2A2 is only 25% identical to that of the MACROH2A1 subtypes, although its size and basic character are very similar. The nonhistone region of MACROH2A2 is 64% identical to MACROH2A1.2. The region corresponding to the alternately spliced exons in MACROH2A1.1 and MACROH2A1.2 (underlined in Fig.1 a) is more similar to MACROH2A1.2 both in length (33 amino acids) and sequence (48% identical). We have no evidence that the transcript from the MACROH2A2 gene is alternately spliced. The essential elements of the putative leucine zipper region are conserved except in the third repeat, where there is a threonine in the “d” position (Fig. 1 a). On the basis of studies of other leucine zipper proteins, the presence of a threonine in this position would not necessarily preclude a coiled-coil interaction (24Hu J.C. O'Shea E.K. Kim P.S. Sauer R.T. Science. 1990; 250: 1400-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The bacterial and viral proteins that are similar to the nonhistone region of MACROH2A1 subtypes (2Pehrson J.R. Fuji R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 16: 2837-2842Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar) show a similar degree of homology to the nonhistone region of MACROH2A2 (data not shown). The gene for mouse MACROH2A1 contains 10 exons and is located on chromosome 13 (4). Here we report a description of the rat and human MACROH2A1 genes as well as the human gene for MACROH2A2 (Fig. 2). The rat gene was identified from five overlapping clones from a rat λ phage library. The human genes were identified from the sequence data base from the human genome sequencing project. The complete MACROH2A1 locus is available. The ratmacroH2A1 gene consists of nine exons spread over more than 60 kilobases. The human MACROH2A1 gene consists of 11 exons spread over almost 65 kilobases. The first exon of themacroH2A1 gene of rat and mouse is noncoding. In the human gene the first two exons are noncoding and alternately spliced. In fact there is only one example of the first of the two being used (21Mao M. Fu G. Wu J.-S. Zhang Q.-H. Zhou J. Kan L.-X. Huang Q.-H. He K.-L. Gu B.-W. Han Z.-G. Shen Y. Gu J., Yu, Y.-P. Xu S.-H. Wang Y.-X. Chen S.-J. Chen Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8175-8180Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and it has yet to show up in dbEST. The same situation may apply to rat and mouse; however, there is no evidence for this in the data base yet. The last exon of all known MACROH2A1s have long 3′ untranslated regions. The mouse MACROH2A1 message was reported with a short 3′ untranslated region (4Rasmussen T.P. Huang T. Mastrangelo M.A. Loring J. Panning B. Jaenisch R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3685-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar); however, a survey of mouse expressed sequence tags indicates that the 3′ untranslated region of mousemacroH2A1 cDNAs is about 600 nucleotides (the discrepancy is most likely due to an internal stretch of As being mistaken for a poly(A) tail). One difference between the MACROH2A1 genes of rats, mice, and humans is in the exons encoding the histone region. Exon 2 of the rat macroH2A1 gene is split into two exons in the mouse and human genes, which we therefore here refer to as E2 and E2a. One peculiarity of the MACROH2A1 gene is the 5′ splice site selection of exon 4, which encodes the very end of the basic region and the beginning of the nonhistone region. We noticed that the two reported cDNA sequences for human MACROH2A1 (20Lee Y. Hong M. Kim J.W. Hong Y.M. Choe Y.-K. Chang S.Y. Lee K.S. Choe I.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1399: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 21Mao M. Fu G. Wu J.-S. Zhang Q.-H. Zhou J. Kan L.-X. Huang Q.-H. He K.-L. Gu B.-W. Han Z.-G. Shen Y. Gu J., Yu, Y.-P. Xu S.-H. Wang Y.-X. Chen S.-J. Chen Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8175-8180Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) differ here, with the basic region of one ending with three lysines and the other with just two. Examination of the human gene sequence revealed that the first lysine comes from the 3′ end of E3 and that the next two come from an alternate splice site selection of a tandem pair of lysine codons at the 5′ end of E4 as shown in SchemeFSI. A survey of dbEST suggests that in the human the second site is twice as likely to be selected as the first (33 of 47 informative sequences). For the mouse the splice site selections are equally represented (6 of 12 informative sequences). The 5′ end of E4 in the rat also shows this potential; however, rat sequences from this region are not represented in dbEST. The only rat sequences available from this part of the cDNA use the second site (1Pehrson J.R. Fried V.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1398-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 3Pehrson J.R. Costanzi C. Dharia C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 65: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The significance of this phenomenon is unknown. Whereas MACROH2A1 has been mapped to human chromosome 5 (21Mao M. Fu G. Wu J.-S. Zhang Q.-H. Zhou J. Kan L.-X. Huang Q.-H. He K.-L. Gu B.-W. Han Z.-G. Shen Y. Gu J., Yu, Y.-P. Xu S.-H. Wang Y.-X. Chen S.-J. Chen Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8175-8180Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), we found the MACROH2A2 gene in sequences from chromosome 10. Most of the MACROH2A2 locus is available, including all the known exons and more than half of the known introns.MACROH2A2 is organized identically to MACROH2A1(Fig. 2). It also starts with a noncoding exon and ends with a long 3′ untranslated region. The only difference is in exon 5. WhereasMACROH2A1 has two alternately spliced exon 5s, which we refer to here as E5.2 and E5.1, MACROH2A2 has only one, which happens to be slightly more similar to E5.2 ofMACROH2A1. No other spliced variants of MACROH2A2 have been found in dbEST, and a BLAST search of dbEST with the complete intron sequences between E4 and E6 of MACROH2A2 did not reveal any other exon candidates. We raised antibodies against the nonhistone region of MACROH2A2 to examine the pattern of MACROH2A2 expression and its distribution within the nucleus. Antibodies were affinity-purified and absorbed against a GST-MACROH2A1.2 nonhistone region fusion protein to eliminate cross-reaction with MACROH2A1 subtypes (5Costanzi C. Pehrson J.R. Nature. 1998; 393: 599-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The specificity of these purified antibodies and the MACROH2A1.2 antibodies was tested on a Western blot of mouse liver and kidney nuclear extracts. The MACROH2A2 antibodies detected a single band that runs slightly slower than MACROH2A1.2 (Fig.3). The MACROH2A1.2 content of mouse liver and kidney is similar. However, the MACROH2A2 content of the kidney extract was higher than that of the liver, even when we loaded 2.5 times more liver extract (Fig. 3). We examined the distributions of MACROH2A1.2 and MACROH2A2 in different cell types and their distributions within the nucleus by immunofluorescence on frozen tissue sections of mouse liver and kidney. In the liver, MACROH2A1.2 antibodies stained hepatocytes brightly and, to a lesser extent, cells of the bile ducts (Fig.4, a and b), as reported (5Costanzi C. Pehrson J.R. Nature. 1998; 393: 599-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) (hepatocytes are labeled H, and bile ducts are labeled D). In contrast, hepatocytes were only faintly stained with the MACROH2A2 antibodies, whereas the bile ducts, certain cells around the central vein, and a small number of parenchymal cells were brightly stained (Fig. 4, c and d). The parenchymal cells that stain brightly for MACROH2A2 do not appear to be hepatocytes, on the basis of their nuclear morphology. To see which individual cells stained for MACROH2A1.2 or MACROH2A2, we used direct immunofluorescence with a fluorescein-labeled MACROH2A1.2 antibody and a Texas Red-labeled MACROH2A2 antibody. We used female mouse liver, because inactive X chromosome-associated MCBs are readily apparent in hepatocytes and ductal cells stained for MACROH2A1.2 (Figs.4 a and 5 a). In several hepatocytes, two inactive X chromosome-associated MCBs were seen (Fig. 5 a), and we have shown that such nuclei are polyploid (5Costanzi C. Pehrson J.R. Nature. 1998; 393: 599-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). In the bile ducts both subtypes stained the ductal epithelial cells (Fig. 5, DE), but only MACROH2A2 antibodies stained the periductal cells significantly (Fig. 5, PD). MacroH2A2 containing MCBs were apparent in the ductal epithelium. These MCBs were only present in females (data not shown) and colocalized with MACROH2A1.2 MCBs (Fig. 5, a–c). This indicates that these MCBs involve the inactive X chromosome. Those cells around the central vein (Fig. 5, V) and the non-hepatocyte parenchymal cells (Fig. 5, NHP) that stain with the MACROH2A2 antibody do not stain with the MACROH2A1.2 antibody. MCBs were not evident in many of these nuclei, although they may have been obscured by the relatively high level of MACROH2A2 seen throughout these nuclei. These subtypes also showed distinct expression patterns in the kidney (Fig. 6). The cortex of the kidney contains several prominent structures including the proximal and distal convoluted tubules and the glomeruli (the site of blood filtration). Proximal convoluted tubules (Fig. 6, P) were identified by their staining with an antibody to the gap junction protein connexin 32 (25) (shown in green in b andd). MACROH2A1.2 and MACROH2A2 were both found in the proximal convoluted tubules (Fig. 6, a and b for MACROH2A1.2; c and d for MACROH2A2). We identified distal tubules (Fig. 6, D) by their appearance and lack of connexin 32 staining. They stained more brightly for MACROH2A1.2 than for MACROH2A2. Glomeruli (Fig. 6, G) showed very little staining for MACROH2A1.2 (a and b) but were stained for MACROH2A2 (c and d). The strongest MACROH2A2 signal was in the parietal layer of Bowman's capsule (Fig. 6 d, B), a structure that forms the outer layer of the glomerulus. In the medulla of the kidney there was less overlap in the staining patterns. In this part of the kidney MACROH2A1.2 was detected at a high level in the straight proximal tubules that we identified by costaining with antibodies to connexin 26 (25) (Fig. 6, e and f). Very little MACROH2A1.2 staining was seen in the cells between these tubules. In contrast, MACROH2A2 staining was very low in the connexin 26 positive tubules but was present at high levels in the cells between them (Fig. 6,g and h). A distinct expression pattern was also seen in the adrenal gland. MACROH2A2 staining predominated in the outer cells of the capsule, and MACROH2A1.2 staining predominated in the inner cells of the cortex and medulla (Fig. 7). The staining patterns of different cell types presented here are summarized in Table I. We also stained frozen sections of dog liver and kidney for MACROH2A1.2 and MACROH2A2, and the staining patterns were virtually identical to those in the mouse (data not shown).Table ICell type-specific expression of MACROH2A subtypesTissueCell typeImmunofluorescenceMACROH2A1.2MACROH2A2LiverHepatocyte+++±Nonhepatocyte parenchymal−1-aAlthough many nonhepatocyte parenchymal cells are not stained with MACROH2A1.2 antibody, some may be stained.++++Ductal epithelium+++++Periductal−++++KidneyProximal convoluted tubule++++++Distal convoluted tubule+++Glomerulus±++Parietal layer of Bowman's capsule−++++Straight proximal tubule+++±AdrenalCapsule++++Cortex/medulla++++1-a Although many nonhepatocyte parenchymal cells are not stained with MACROH2A1.2 antibody, some may be stained. Open table in a new tab To confirm that the female-specific MCBs observed with MACROH2A2 antibodies involve the inactive X chromosome, we performed immunofluorescence with MACROH2A2 antibodies followed by fluorescence in situ hybridization with an X chromosome paint probe. This analysis was done on a section of female mouse kidney, because female-specific MACROH2A2 MCBs are easily detected in the nuclei of the cells of the proximal convoluted tubule. The MACROH2A2 MCBs in these cells colocalized to one of the X chromosomes (Fig. 8). To determine whether there is overlap in the distribution of MACROH2A2 and MACROH2A1.2, we again used direct immunofluorescence using MACROH2A2 antibody labeled with Alexa 488 and a MACROH2A1.2 antibody labeled with Alexa 594. In this case we first wanted to establish that the labeling did not appreciably alter the specificity of the antibodies. We tested them on a Western blot of kidney nuclear extract and saw little or no change in specificity (Fig.9). Immunofluorescence analysis of a cell type that has relatively high levels of both MACROH2A subtypes, the epithelial cells of the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney, showed a similar pattern of nuclear staining (Fig.10). A distinct colocalizing inactive X chromosome-associated MCB, plus relatively diffuse nuclear staining not restricted to Hoechst bright domains, could be seen with both antibodies (Fig. 10, a–c). Small regions where one subtype predominated over the other were also present (Fig.10 d).Figure 10Internuclear distribution of MACROH2A subtypes.

So far the DNA data bases have revealed MACROH2As only in bony vertebrates including mammals, birds, and fish (data not shown). Here we have described a new member of the MACROH2A family, MACROH2A2. MACROH2A2 is virtually identical in size and architecture to the MACROH2A1 subtypes and has significant amino acid sequence homology with those subtypes throughout its length. This suggests that the fundamental functions of the H2A domain, the basic region, and the nonhistone domain of MACROH2A2 are similar to their functions in the MACROH2A1 subtypes. This idea is supported by our observation that, like MACROH2A1.2, MACROH2A2 is concentrated in the inactive X chromosome in certain cell types. The simplest interpretation of this result is that both of these MACROH2A subtypes perform a similar function in the inactive X. On the other hand, MACROH2A2 differs from the MACROH2A1 subtypes in several interesting ways. In primary structure it is only 68% identical to MACROH2A1.2. This contrasts with the exceptional evolutionary conservation of both MACROH2A1 subtypes, which are ∼95% identical between mammals and birds (2Pehrson J.R. Fuji R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 16: 2837-2842Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We do not have any other complete MACROH2A2 sequences, but a comparison of the human MACROH2A2 sequence to partial mouse sequences from dbEST shows that mouse MACROH2A2 is nearly identical to human MACROH2A2 (98% identical covering 97% of the amino acid sequence (data not shown)). Thus, the sequence differences between MACROH2A2 and the MACROH2A1 subtypes are conserved. MACROH2A2 also has a very different pattern of expression from that of MACROH2A1.2 (Table I), and our studies with dog tissues (data not shown) indicate that these cell type differences are conserved in evolution. When MACROH2A1 subtypes and MACROH2A2 are present in the same nucleus, they have similar although nonidentical distributions (Fig. 10). Our results suggest that the MACROH2A that is not associated with the inactive X is also localized to specific regions of chromatin and that the mechanism(s) involved in localizing MACROH2A may have subtype specificity. Our observation that MACROH2As have a preference for the inactive X has been questioned in a recent report that examined the distribution of MACROH2A1.2 and other core histones in primary human fibroblasts (26Perche P. Vourc'h C. Konecny L. Souchier C. Robert-Nicoud M. Dimitrov S. Khochbin S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1531-1534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These authors suggested that the labeling of the inactive X chromosome by MACROH2A antibodies or green fluorescent protein-tagged MACROH2A may only reflect a higher density of chromatin in the inactive X. This conclusion was based on their observations that the inactive X was also labeled by antibodies against conventional core histones or green fluorescent protein-H2A. Indeed the inactive X in many cells, including human fibroblasts, is often readily identifiable by DNA staining as the most prominent chromatin domain in the nucleus,i.e. the Barr body. Our conclusion that MACROH2A preferentially associates with the inactive X is based on the relative staining of the inactive X compared with other chromatin. Our studies have focused on cells of mouse tissues where the inactive X cannot be identified by DNA or chromatin stains due to the presence of other large domains of similar or greater density (Fig. 10 and Refs. 5Costanzi C. Pehrson J.R. Nature. 1998; 393: 599-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 7Costanzi C. Stein P. Worrad D.M. Schultz R.M. Pehrson J.R. Development. 2000; 127: 2283-2289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, and 27Moore K.L. Barr M.L. J. Comp. Neurol. 1953; 98: 213-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, in these cells the inactive X is readily identified by MACROH2A staining (Fig. 10 and Refs. 5Costanzi C. Pehrson J.R. Nature. 1998; 393: 599-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar and 7Costanzi C. Stein P. Worrad D.M. Schultz R.M. Pehrson J.R. Development. 2000; 127: 2283-2289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with our conclusions, Chadwick and Willard (28Chadwick B.P. Willard H.F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) found that myc epitope-tagged MACROH2A was preferentially localized to the Barr body of primary human fibroblasts, whereas myc epitope-tagged H2B showed no such preference in comparison to other chromatin. On the basis of the association of MACROH2A1.2 with the inactive X chromosome, we suggested that MACROH2As are involved in establishing and/or maintaining transcriptionally silent chromatin domains (5Costanzi C. Pehrson J.R. Nature. 1998; 393: 599-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Our present results demonstrate a new level of complexity and specificity to MACROH2A protein utilization. One interesting possibility is that each cell type has a specific complement of the genome associated with MACROH2A-containing nucleosomes. This would require a mechanism to localize MACROH2A to numerous specific chromosomal domains. MACROH2As could be localized to specific chromatin domains bycis-acting RNAs like Xist (5Costanzi C. Pehrson J.R. Nature. 1998; 393: 599-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), and that targeting could involve a direct interaction of the nonhistone region of MACROH2A with RNA (2Pehrson J.R. Fuji R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 16: 2837-2842Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This model predicts that cis-acting RNA genes likeXist are strategically located throughout the genome. The expression of such genes could be developmentally regulated and cell type-specific. The cell type-specific expression of MACROH2A subtypes demonstrated in the present work and in previous studies of the MACROH2A1 subtypes (3Pehrson J.R. Costanzi C. Dharia C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 65: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) could provide another level of specificity and control for such a system of transcriptional regulation. We thank E. Holzbaur, O.

We find that Pax3 is necessary and sufficient to induce myogenesis in pluripotent stem cells. Pax3 induced the expression of the transcription factor Six1, its cofactor Eya2, and the transcription factor Mox1 prior to inducing the expression of MyoD and myogenin. Overexpression of a dominant negative Pax3, engineered by fusing the active transcriptional repression domain of mouse EN-2 in place of the Pax3 transcriptional activation domain, completely abolished skeletal myogenesis without inhibiting cardiogenesis. Expression of the dominant negative Pax3 resulted in a loss of expression of Six1, Eya2, and endogenous Pax3 as well as a down-regulation in the expression of Mox1. No effect was found on the expression of Gli2. These results indicate that Pax3 activity is essential for skeletal muscle development, the expression of Six1 and Eya2, and is involved in regulating its own expression. In summary, the combined approach of expressing both a wild type and dominant negative transcription factor in stem cells has identified a cascade of transcriptional events controlled by Pax3 that are necessary and sufficient for skeletal myogenesis.

Extensive tissue interactions and signaling events result in the patterning of the somite to form the sclerotome, dermomyotome, and myotome (9Cossu G. Borello U.

Signals from the surface ectoderm, axial structures (dorsal neural tube and the notochord), and the lateral mesoderm are involved in regulating the differentiation of the myotome (13Cossu G. Kelly R.

Several transcription factors are candidate factors for mediating the response to signals from surrounding tissues and inducing MRF expression. These include Pax3 (17Goulding M.D. Chalepakis G.

Biol. 1994; 162: 402-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Pax3, a member of the paired box family of transcription factors, is first expressed in the paraxial mesoderm and the entire early somite. Subsequently, Pax3 expression is restricted to the developing dermomyotome and maturing cells of the dorso-medial lip, marking the early stages of myogenic cell specification (22Goulding M. Lumsden A. Paquette A.J. Development. 1994; 120: 957-971PubMed Google Scholar, 23Williams B.A. Ordahl C.P. Development. 1994; 120: 785-796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies in mice lacking functional Pax3 indicated that Pax3 was required for migrating hypaxial muscle formation (22Goulding M. Lumsden A. Paquette A.J. Development. 1994; 120: 957-971PubMed Google Scholar, 24Tremblay P. Dietrich S. Mericskay M. Schubert F.R. Li Z. Paulin D. Dev.

Lamar E. Olivier M. Goulding M. Development. 1996; 122: 1017-1027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of Pax3 in the formation of epaxial muscle was complicated by the presence of Pax7, a closely related member of the Pax transcription factor family (27Jostes B. Walther C. Gruss P. Mech. Dev. 1991; 33: 27-37Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Pax7 is able to bind the same DNA motifs as Pax3 (28Schafer B.W. Czerny T. Bernasconi M. Genini M. Busslinger M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4574-4582Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 29Mansouri A. Stoykova A. Gruss P. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 18 (suppl.): 35-42Crossref Google Scholar), and therefore, Pax7 is thought to play a redundant role to Pax3 in the epaxial region of the developing dermomyotome. However, crossing the Myf-5(−/−) mice with the Pax3(−/−) splotch mice (30Tajbakhsh S. Rocancourt D. Cossu G. Buckingham M. Cell. 1997; 89: 127-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar) identified a requirement for Pax3 in the regulation of MyoD expression, indicating that Pax3 functions upstream of MyoD. The overexpression of Pax3 in paraxial mesoderm leads to activation of muscle-specific gene expression (31Maroto M. Reshef R. Munsterberg A.E. Koester S. Goulding M. Lassar A.B.

Mardon G. Development. 1997; 124: 45-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to regulate compound eye formation. A parallel pathway has been hypothesized to be present during myogenesis involving Pax3 as the initiating factor, and the mammalian homologues of the Drosophila genes as follows: six1, eya2, and dach2 (32Heanue T.A. Reshef R. Davis R.J. Mardon G. Oliver G. Tomarev S. Lassar A.B. Tabin C.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3231-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 41Relaix F. Buckingham M.

Six1 binds to an essential MEF3 DNA-binding motif in the promoter of the myogenin gene (43Spitz F. Demignon J. Porteu A. Kahn A. Concordet J.P. Daegelen D. Maire P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14220-14225Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Eya and Dach family members synergize with each other and interact with Six1 to regulate transcription (44Chen R. Amoui M. Zhang Z. Mardon G. Cell. 1997; 91: 893-903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 45Ohto H. Kamada S. Tago K. Tominaga S.I. Ozaki H. Sato S. Kawakami K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6815-6824Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Recently, these molecules were shown to regulate each other's expression and to induce muscle-specific gene expression in mesoderm explants (32Heanue T.A. Reshef R. Davis R.J. Mardon G. Oliver G. Tomarev S. Lassar A.B. Tabin C.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3231-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a Pax3-FKHR fusion protein, which has transforming properties and is present in 60% of all alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas, activates the expression of Six1, MyoD, and myogenin when overexpressed in NIH 3T3 cells (46Khan J. Bittner M.L. Saal L.H. Teichmann U. Azorsa D.O. Gooden G.C. Pavan W.J. Trent J.M. Meltzer P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13264-13269Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). However, the relationship of each factor in a regulatory hierarchy, during commitment to the myogenic lineage, is still unclear. Mox1and Mox2 are homeobox containing genes that are expressed in overlapping patterns in the paraxial mesoderm (20Candia A.F. Hu J. Crosby J. Lalley P.A. Noden D. Nadeau J.H. Wright C.V. Development. 1992; 116: 1123-1136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,47Candia A.F. Wright C.V. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1996; 40: 1179-1184PubMed Google Scholar). During somitogenesis, Mox1 is expressed within the dermomyotome, and Mox2 is expressed in the migrating myoblasts of the limb musculature. Mice lacking Mox2 are defective in limb muscle formation, and the expression of Pax3 and Myf-5 is disturbed in the limb (48Mankoo B.S. Collins N.S. Ashby P. Grigorieva E. Pevny L.H. Candia A. Wright C.V. Rigby P.W. Pachnis V. Nature. 1999; 400: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The role of Mox1 during myotomal muscle formation remains to be determined. The gli family of zinc finger transcription factors,gli, gli2, and gli3 (21Hui C.C. Slusarski D. Platt K.A. Holmgren R. Joyner A.L. Dev. Biol. 1994; 162: 402-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), are the mammalian homologues of the Drosophila cubitus interruptus(Ci), involved in transducing Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signals in responding cells (49Alexandre C. Jacinto A. Ingham P.W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2003-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Shh is involved in epaxial muscle determination and activation of Myf-5 expression (50Borycki A.G. Brunk B. Tajbakhsh S. Buckingham M. Chiang C. Emerson Jr., C.P. Development. 1999; 126: 4053-4063PubMed Google Scholar). The role of Gli molecules in Shh signaling and the expression profiles of Gli2 and Gli3 in the developing somite suggest that they are candidates for regulating MRF expression and commitment to the myogenic lineage (51Borycki A.G. Mendham L. Emerson C.P. Development. 1998; 125: 777-790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,52Borycki A. Brown A.M. Emerson C.P. Development. 2000; 127: 2075-2087Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A tissue culture system capable of linking somite-patterning events with myogenesis would be valuable for further analysis of the transcription factors involved during myogenic commitment. The P19 cell culture system is such a system because the differentiation of these pluripotent stem cells simulates the biochemical and morphological processes that occur during early embryonic development (53McBurney M.W. Jones-Villeneuve E.M. Edwards M.K. Anderson P.J. Nature. 1982; 299: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 54McBurney M.W. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1993; 37: 135-140PubMed Google Scholar, 55Rudnicki M.A. McBurney M.W. Robertson E.J. Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1987: 19-49Google Scholar). Aggregation of P19 cells in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) initiates differentiation into cardiac and/or skeletal muscle depending on the specific serum conditions (56Edwards M.K. Harris J.F. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 2280-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 57Wilton S. Skerjanc I.S. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1999; 35: 175-177Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). As P19 cells differentiate into skeletal muscle, they first express markers of the early mesoderm, such as Brachyury T, Wnt3a, and Wnt5b, followed by markers of somitogenesis, such as Pax3, and finally myogenesis markers, such as MyoD and myogenin (58Ridgeway A.G. Petropoulos H. Wilton S. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32398-32405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thus, differentiating stem cells express the same complement of genes that a mesodermal cell would express as it is induced, forms a somite, and differentiates into myotomal muscle in the embryo. In this study we utilized the P19 cell culture system in order to examine the events involved in commitment of multipotential muscle precursor cells to the myogenic lineage. We show that during myogenesis in P19 cells, the somite patterning transcription factors, Pax3, Mox1, Gli2, Six1, and Eya2, are expressed prior to MRF expression. Overexpression of Pax3 is sufficient to initiate the proper cascade of events required to induce myogenesis in stem cells. Mox1, Six1, and Eya2, but not Gli2, expression is initiated prior to MRF expression during Pax3-directed myogenesis, indicating that Pax3 expression is sufficient to regulate the expression of these genes. We have also utilized a dominant negative Pax3, created by fusing the mouse EN-2 repression domain to Pax3. We show that Pax3-directed transcriptional activation is essential for proper expression of Six1, Eya2, and Mox1 as well as for myogenesis to occur. However, the presence of the dominant negative Pax3 does not inhibit cardiogenesis, indicating that the requirement of Pax3 during myogenesis is specific for cells committed to skeletal muscle and not all mesoderm cell types. All expression vectors utilized the phosphoglycerate kinase (pgk-1) promoter (59Adra C.N. Boer P.H. McBurney M.W. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 60: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) to drive the expression of various cDNAs. The DNA constructs PGK-Pax3, PGK-Puro, and PGK-LacZ were previously described (58Ridgeway A.G. Petropoulos H. Wilton S. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32398-32405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The DNA construct PGK-Pax3-EN contains the 1.45-kb Pax3-EN-2 fusion cDNA. The 198-amino acid N-terminal repression domain of the mouse EN-2 protein was fused at the C terminus of the first 286 amino acids of Pax3, containing the DNA binding domains. PCR amplification of Pax3 cDNA (17Goulding M.D. Chalepakis G. Deutsch U. Erselius J.R. Gruss P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1135-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar) (GenBankTM accession number NM 008781) used the oligonucleotides 5′-AAGGATCCAGGATGACCACGCTGGCC and 3′-AACTCGAGCTAACTAACTAGAATTCGATATCGAAAGCCATCAGTTGATTGGCTCC. PCR amplification of EN-2 cDNA (GenBankTMaccession number NM 010134) used the oligonucleotides 5′-AAGATATCGAGGAGAAGGATTCCAAGCCC and 3′-AAGATATCCTACCCAGAGTGGCGCTGGCT. The 594-bp EcoRV product of the EN-2 PCR product was cloned into the engineered EcoRV site (underlined in the oligonucleotide above) at the 3′ end of the Pax3 PCR product. PGK vector DNA is a plasmid containing the pgk-1 promoter alone. P19 embryonal carcinoma cells were cultured as described (55Rudnicki M.A. McBurney M.W. Robertson E.J.

Stable cell lines expressing Pax3 were generated as described previously (58Ridgeway A.G. Petropoulos H. Wilton S. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol.

Duplicate transfections using the calcium phosphate method (65Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar) were performed with 8 μg of PGK-Pax3, 0.5 μg of PGK-Puro, 1 μg of PGK-LacZ, and 2.5 μg of B17 (66McBurney M.W. Fournier S. Schmidt-Kastner P.K. Jardine K. Craig J. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1994; 20: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). P19 control cells were isolated as described (58Ridgeway A.G. Petropoulos H. Wilton S. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32398-32405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Stable cell lines expressing the Pax3-Engr fusion were created using the FuGene transfection system according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 7 μg of PGK-Pax3-Engr, 0.5 μg of PGK-LacZ, 0.25 μg of PGK-Puro, and 2.5 μg of B17 were mixed with 17 μl of FuGene reagent and incubated overnight with P19 cells. After 24 h of transfection, efficiency was tested as described (58Ridgeway A.G. Petropoulos H. Wilton S. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32398-32405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). 7.5 × 105 cells were plated in a 150-mm dish and selected for puromycin resistance (2 μg/ml). After 10 days clones were isolated and high expressers identified by RNA slot blots. Differentiation was induced by aggregating 5 × 105P19{control}, P19{Pax}, or P19{Pax3-Engr} cells in bacterial dishes with or without 0.8% Me2SO. The presence of Me2SO induces the differentiation of endogenous skeletal and cardiac muscle as described previously in control cells (55Rudnicki M.A. McBurney M.W. Robertson E.J. Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1987: 19-49Google Scholar, 57Wilton S. Skerjanc I.S. In Vitro Cell. Dev.

Chem. 2000; 275: 32398-32405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Control cell lines differentiated in the absence of Me2SO do not differentiate into cardiac or skeletal muscle. Cells were aggregated for 4 days and then plated into tissue culture dishes and harvested for RNA or fixed for immunofluorescence at the time indicated. Me2SO is only added to the media during the aggregation stage of the differentiation. In the time course experiments, 3 × 106 cells were differentiated for day 1 RNA, 2 × 106 cells were differentiated for day 2 RNA, and 5 × 105 cells were differentiated for days 3–9. Cells were fixed in methanol at −20 °C for 5 min and rehydrated in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. MyHC staining was carried out as described (58Ridgeway A.G. Petropoulos H. Wilton S. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32398-32405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μl of a mouse anti-MyHC monoclonal antibody supernatant, MF20 (67Bader D. Masaki T. Fischman D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar), was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After three 5-min washes in PBS, cells were incubated for 1 h in 50 μl of PBS with 1 μl of goat anti-mouse IgG(H + L) Cy3-linked antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Coverslips were mounted in a solution of 50% glycerol, 40% PBS, 9.9% para-phenylenediamine and 0.1% Hoechst stain. Immunofluorescence was visualized with a Zeiss Axioskop microscope; images were captured with a Sony 3CCD color video camera and processed using Northern Eclipse, Adobe photoshop, and Canvas6 software. Total RNA was isolated from differentiated P19{control}, P19{Pax3}, and P19{Pax3-Engr} at the times indicated. Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (58Ridgeway A.G. Petropoulos H. Wilton S. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32398-32405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Total RNA (6 μg) was separated on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel. Transfer to Hybond-N (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) occurred by capillary blotting, and RNA was cross-linked by UV irradiation. The membrane was hybridized to DNA probes labeled to over 109 cpm/μg with [α-32P]dCTP using a multiprime labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The probes were purified on a spin column of Sephadex G-50 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and hybridized for 16 h at 42 °C. Washing was performed 5 times for 5 min at room temperature in 2× SSC, 0.2% SDS and for 15 min at 65 °C in 0.1× SSC, 0.2% SDS. Hybridization was visualized by autoradiography and with a PhosphorImager SI from Molecular Dynamics. Densitometry was carried out using ImageQuant version 1.11 software from Molecular Dynamics. Changes in expression levels in P19{Pax3-Engr} cell lines were determined by taking the average expression in three separate P19{Pax3-Engr} cell lines and comparing them to the expression level in two separate P19{Control} cell lines at day 9 during differentiation. The probes used are as follows: a 600-bp PstI fragment from the human cardiac α-actin last exon (68Rudnicki M.A. Jackowski G. Saggin L. McBurney M.W. Dev. Biol. 1990; 138: 348-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar); a 1.8-kb EcoRI fragment from the mouse MyoD cDNA (2Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B.

Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2319-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar); and a 2.4-kb XbaI fragment of the rat Gata-4 cDNA (72Grepin C. Dagnino L. Robitaille L. Haberstroh L. Antakly T. Nemer M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3115-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). All blots were standardized using a 750-bp EcoRI fragment of rabbit 18 S cDNA. We have identified previously the expression patterns of signaling molecules involved in somite patterning during endogenous myogenesis in P19 cells (58Ridgeway A.G. Petropoulos H. Wilton S. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32398-32405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Here we examine the expression pattern, in P19 cells, of transcription factors found in the early somite and the maturing dermomyotome during somitogenesis. The expression of myogenin on days 7–9 of the time course indicated the formation of skeletal muscle (Fig. 1 A, lanes 8–10). Mox1, a homeobox containing transcription factor expressed in the early somite and developing dermomyotome, is expressed from day 3 to day 9, peaking on days 4–6 (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4–10). Pax3, Gli2, and Six1 are also expressed during development in the early somite and maturing dermomyotome and were all expressed from day 4 to day 9 (Fig.1, C–E, respectively, lanes 5–10). Eya2, a cofactor for Six1, found in the embryo only in the developing dermomyotome and not the early somite, was expressed later than Pax3, Gli2, and Six1, from day 5 to day 9 (Fig. 1 F, lanes 6–10). All five of these factors are expressed prior to the expression of MyoD (58Ridgeway A.G. Petropoulos H. Wilton S. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32398-32405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and myogenin on day 7 (Fig. 1 A). The ordered pattern of expression of these transcription factors during P19 cell myogenesis is similar to the order they would be expressed in a mesoderm cell as it matures from paraxial mesoderm to an early somite and then into the dermomyotome and finally into the myotome. Knock-out studies have identified a role for Pax3 in skeletal muscle development (30Tajbakhsh S. Rocancourt D. Cossu G. Buckingham M. Cell. 1997; 89: 127-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). The ability of Pax3 to induce the expression of muscle-specific genes has been shown in mesoderm explant studies (31Maroto M. Reshef R. Munsterberg A.E. Koester S. Goulding M. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1997; 89: 139-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 32Heanue T.A. Reshef R. Davis R.J. Mardon G. Oliver G. Tomarev S. Lassar A.B. Tabin C.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3231-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), although the order of expression of the genes involved was not determined. We investigated the ability of Pax3 to induce myogenesis in EC stem cells. Pax3 was stably expressed in P19 cells under control of thepgk-1 promoter. Three stable cell lines expressing Pax3, termed P19{Pax3} cells, were isolated. All three clones differentiated into skeletal muscle following aggregation in the absence of Me2SO.

P2X3 receptor channels are highly expressed in sensory neurons and probably contribute to the sensation of pain. Kinetics of P2X3 currents are characterized by rapid desensitization (<100 ms) and slow recovery (>20 s). Thus, any mechanism modulating rate of desensitization and/or recovery may have profound effect on susceptibility of nociceptive neurons expressing P2X3 to ATP. Here we show that currents mediated by P2X3 receptor channels and the heteromeric channel P2X2/3 composed of P2X2 and P2X3 subunits are potentiated by the neuropeptides substance P and bradykinin, which are known to modulate pain perception. The effect is mediated by the respective neuropeptide receptors, can be mimicked by phorbol ester and blocked by inhibitors of protein kinases. Together with data from site-directed mutagenesis our results suggest that inflammatory mediators sensitize nociceptors through phosphorylation of P2X3 and P2X2/3 ion channels or associated proteins.

So far, seven different P2X subunits have been cloned (P2X1–7), which form a gene family (1Buell G. Collo G. Rassendren F. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 2221-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). They have two transmembrane domains with intracellular termini and a rather large extracellular loop (2Newbolt A. Stoop R.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and form non-selective cation channels with a high permeability to Ca2+. Various P2X receptors show differences both in the affinity to ATP and in the kinetics of activation and inactivation. P2X1 and P2X3 show high agonist affinity (EC50 ≈ 1 μm) and rapid activation and desensitization with full activation in less than 10 ms and almost complete desensitization in less than 1 s (4Valera S. Hussy N. Evans R.J. Adami N. North R.A. Surprenant A. Buell G. Nature. 1994; 371: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar, 5Lewis C. Neidhart S. Holy C. North R.A. Buell G. Surprenant A. Nature. 1995; 377: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Moreover, repeated application of the agonist leads to the disappearance of the ATP-gated currents (4Valera S. Hussy N. Evans R.J. Adami N. North R.A. Surprenant A. Buell G. Nature. 1994; 371: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar, 5Lewis C. Neidhart S. Holy C. North R.A. Buell G. Surprenant A. Nature. 1995; 377: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). In contrast, P2X2 and P2X4 through P2X7 have a low agonist affinity (EC50 ≈ 10 μm), are slowly activating with time constants in the order of 100 ms, and show only partial desensitization (1Buell G. Collo G. Rassendren F. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 2221-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 6Brake A.J. Wagenbach M.J. Julius D. Nature. 1994; 371: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Heterooligomeric P2X2/3 channels show a mixed phenotype with high affinity to the agonist α,β-methylene ATP (α,β-meATP)1 like P2X3 receptors and incomplete desensitization like P2X2 receptors (5Lewis C. Neidhart S. Holy C. North R.A. Buell G. Surprenant A. Nature. 1995; 377: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). The desensitization properties of the rapidly activating and inactivating P2X1 and P2X3 are likely to be of physiological importance as synaptic transmission takes place in a few milliseconds. Modulation of the rate of desensitization and/or recovery of these receptors may contribute to synaptic efficacy. P2X3 is almost exclusively expressed in sensory neurons (7Chen C.C. Akopian A.N. Sivilotti L. Colquhoun D. Burnstock G. Wood J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 428-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar,8Collo G. North R.A. Kawashima E. Merlo-Pich E. Neidhart S. Surprenant A. Buell G. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2495-2507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), mostly in capsaicin-sensitive nociceptors (9Vulchanova L. Riedl M.S. Shuster S.J. Stone L.S. Hargreaves K.M. Buell G.

P2X3-mediated currents in sensory neurons are large (12Cook S.P. Vulchanova L. Hargreaves K.M. Elde R. McCleskey E.W. Nature. 1997; 387: 505-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), and P2X3 shows the strongest expression level in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons compared with other P2X receptors (10Xiang Z. Bo X. Burnstock G. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 256: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The P2X3 protein is found on the sensory endings as well as on the presynaptic membrane in inner lamina II of the spinal horn (9Vulchanova L. Riedl M.S. Shuster S.J. Stone L.S. Hargreaves K.M. Buell G. Surprenant A. North R.A. Elde R. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 3470-3478Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), and its activation by ATP might contribute to the sensation of pain. In the dorsal horn a presynaptic mechanism is involved, which leads to a potentiation of the excitatory postsynaptic potential (13Gu J.G. MacDermott A.B. Nature. 1997; 389: 749-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Nociceptive neurons express homomeric P2X3 as well as heteromeric P2X2/3 receptors (5Lewis C. Neidhart S. Holy C. North R.A. Buell G. Surprenant A. Nature. 1995; 377: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Both types of channels can be expressed separately or together in individual neurons (14Burgard E.C. Niforatos W. van Biesen T. Lynch K.J. Touma E. Metzger R.E. Kowaluk E.A. Jarvis M.F. J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 82: 1590-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar); recent data suggest that homomeric P2X3 is predominantly expressed on small diameter sensory neurons and heteromeric P2X2/3 on medium diameter sensory neurons (15Ueno S. Tsuda M. Iwanaga T. Inoue K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 126: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 16Li C. Peoples R.W. Lanthorn T.H. Li Z.W. Weight F.F.

Application of α,β-meATP leads to nociceptive behavior in vivo (18Bland-Ward P.A. Humphrey P.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), confirming a role for P2X3 and P2X2/3 receptors in nociception. Here we show that the inflammatory mediators substance P (SP) and bradykinin (Bk) can potentiate currents through P2X3 and P2X2/3 expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Both induce an increase in peak current as well as in steady-state current with repeated application of ATP. Phorbol ester had a similar, non-additive effect, suggesting a pathway involving protein kinase C. Mutagenesis experiments suggest that a conserved threonine at the intracellular N terminus, which had been shown to be phosphorylated in P2X2(19Boué-Grabot E. Archambault V. Séguéla P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10190-10195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), is crucial for this effect. Together, our results suggest that inflammatory mediators potentiate ATP-gated currents in nociceptors through a mechanism involving either direct phosphorylation of P2X3 receptors or phosphorylation of a so far unidentified protein. cDNAs coding for P2X2 and P2X3 are contained in theBamHI/NotI (P2X2) or theEcoRI/XhoI (P2X3) site of vector pCDNA3 (Invitrogen, Groningen, Netherlands). Splice variant P2X2–2 has been described previously (20Brändle U. Spielmanns P. Osteroth R. Sim J. Surprenant A. Buell G. Ruppersberg J.P. Plinkert P.K. Zenner H.P. Glowatzki E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). cDNAs for SP and Bk receptors are contained in the HincII (SP receptor) or the EcoRI (B2 receptor) site of vector pBluescript. Chimeric molecules between P2X2 and P2X3 and point mutations were constructed by recombinant polymerase chain reaction using standard protocols. All polymerase chain reaction-derived fragments were entirely sequenced. Capped cRNA was synthesized using mMessage mMachine (Ambion, Austin, TX) by T7 RNA polymerase from cDNAs, which had been linearized by XhoI (P2X receptors) or XbaI (SP and B2 receptors). Xenopus laevis oocytes were surgically removed from adult animals and manually dissected. For the investigation of a possible effect of inflammatory mediators on currents through P2X receptors, we coexpressed the rat SP receptor (NK-1 receptor) or the human Bk (B2) receptor with the P2X receptors in oocytes. We injected either 5 ng of P2X3 or 20 pg of P2X2, together with 5 ng of SP or Bk receptor; for expression of the P2X2/3heteromer, we co-expressed a mix of 0.5 ng of P2X2 and 5 ng of P2X3 with the neuropeptide receptors. cRNA was injected into stage V or VI Xenopus oocytes and oocytes kept in OR-2 medium (concentrations (in mm): 82.5 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.0 Na2HPO4, 5.0 HEPES, 1.0 MgCl2, 1.0 CaCl2, and 0.5 g/liter polyvinylpyrrolidon, pH 7.3) at 19 °C. One day after injection, oocytes were treated with collagenase type II (0.33 mg/ml; Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) for 40 min, and on the 2nd day the follicular layer was removed, as folliculated oocytes are known to have intrinsic P2 receptors (21King B.F. Wang S. Burnstock G. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1996; 494: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Defolliculated oocytes from every donor animal, which had been injected only with the cRNA encoding the SP receptor, were tested for endogenous ATP-activated currents. Experiments were done at room temperature 3–7 days after injection using 2-microelectrode voltage clamp. Currents were recorded with a TurboTec 01C amplifier (npi, Tamm, Germany), digitized at 30 Hz (ITC16, HEKA, Lamprecht, Germany) and stored on hard disk. The bath solution had the following composition (in mm): 115 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.8 MgCl2, 10 Hepes, pH 7.3. Bath solution contained no Ca2+ in order to avoid activation of endogenous Ca2+-activated Cl−-channels. ATP, α,β-methylene ATP (α,β-meATP), SP, Bk, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and staurosporine were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Deisenhofen, Germany). P2X receptors showed the pharmacological and kinetic characteristics reported in previous studies using heterologous expression systems and as known from native tissue (Fig. 1). We used 100 nm ATP for activation of P2X3, 300 μm for activation of P2X2 and 10 μm α,β-meATP or 300 μm ATP for activation of P2X2/3, in order to get sufficient current amplitude at low desensitization rate for all subunit combinations injected. To investigate intracellular regulation of ATP-gated currents, we repeatedly applied the agonist for 50 s with 50-s intervals. During the first four to eight ATP pulses, current peak amplitudes decreased; thereafter, they remained constant (Fig.1). We took three equal current peak amplitudes as the base line for judging regulatory effects on current amplitude. Data on graphs indicate the median of the maximal increase of ATP-elicited peak current after stimulation by SP or Bk. Values were normalized to the ATP stimulation just before application of SP or Bk. Error bars indicate the range of the results as these were not symmetrically distributed. Moreover, we compared the amplitude at the end of the 50-s ATP application (quasi-steady state) and report this as the I 50 s. Desensitization time constants were fitted to a single exponential function. They are reported as mean ± standard deviation. Statistical analysis was done with the unpaired Student's ttest. We used Xenopus oocytes as an expression system to investigate differential regulation of P2X receptor subtypes. SP or Bk application to oocytes expressing the SP or the Bk receptor, respectively, yields an immediate transient (≈20 s) inward current (arrows in Figs.Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4) resulting from activation of endogenous Ca2+-activated chloride channels. This represents a typical response of the oocyte membrane in response to Ca2+ release from internal stores, providing evidence for the functional expression of the receptors and their potency to rise intracellular Ca2+ levels.Figure 3Pharmacology of current potentiation through P2X receptors. Protocols were as described in legend to Fig. 2.Arrowheads indicate Cl− currents due to the activation of endogenous Ca2+-activated Cl−channels. A, staurosporine blocked current increase through P2X3 receptors. Oocytes had been incubated in extracellular solution containing 10 μm staurosporine for 10–30 min before the measurements were done. SP induced no longer any current increase. B, phorbol ester mimicked the effect of inflammatory mediators. Application of 4β-PMA (10 nm) for 50 s yielded current potentiation through P2X3receptors very similar to that evoked by SP or Bk. C, if SP was applied during 4β-PMA application, SP elicited no further stimulation. The strong rundown of ATP-gated currents was only observed with long application of PMA.

As shown in Fig. 2 A, the application of SP (100 nm for 50 s) to oocytes expressing P2X3together with the SP receptor caused an immediate and transient (≈150-s duration) increase in peak amplitude (median increase: 61‥, range: 33–165‥, n = 10; Fig. 2 E) and steady state current (I 50 s, current amplitude at the end of the 50-s ATP pulse, median increase: 50‥, range: 4–129‥, n = 10) of ATP induced currents through P2X3 receptors. After the potentiation phase, current amplitudes occasionally became smaller than before SP stimulation (not quantified). Short (2–5 s) applications of SP, repeated after about 10 min, induced each time current increase, suggesting that the underlying alteration of P2X receptors by SP was reversible (data not shown). The current increase following SP application could also be elicited using saturating ATP concentrations (300 μm), demonstrating that SP does not potentiate ATP currents by changing P2X receptors' affinity to ATP. The desensitization rate of the whole cell current can be well fitted with a single exponential function. The time constant of desensitization was not significantly different before and after treatment with SP (3.9 ± 1.7 s compared to 4.6 ± 2.3 s; p = 0.44, n = 10). A similar potentiation of currents through P2X3 receptors could be elicited by application of 100 nm Bk to oocytes coexpressing the P2X3 receptor and the Bk B2 receptor (median increase: 74‥, range: 38–175‥, n = 12; Fig.2 (A and E); median increase ofI 50 s: 89‥, range: 33–140‥,n = 9), showing that multiple neurotransmitters can modulate P2X3 receptors. Using oocytes expressing the P2X2/3 heteromer (obtained by coexpression of the P2X2 and P2X3 subunits) together with the SP receptor, application of SP yielded a similar transient and reversible increase of current (median increase of peak amplitude: 38‥, range: 21–64‥, n = 6, Fig. 2(B and E); median increase ofI 50 s: 56‥, range: 29–68‥, n= 6). The effect was independent of the P2X receptor agonist; it could be elicited by 300 μm ATP as well as by 10 μm αβ-meATP. A similar effect was again seen with application of Bk when the Bk receptor was coexpressed (median increase of peak amplitude: 112‥, range: 22–140‥, n = 9; Fig.2 (B and E); median increase ofI 50 s: 136‥, range: 17–199‥,n = 9). The desensitization rate could not be well fitted but showed an apparent decrease after application of inflammatory mediators (see Fig. 2 B). In contrast, the slowly desensitizing currents through P2X2 receptors were not significantly increased by SP receptor activation (median increase of peak current amplitude: 3‥, range: −9‥ to 15‥, n = 13, p > 0.01, Fig. 2 (C and E); median increase ofI 50 s: 2‥, range: −7‥ to 8‥,n = 13, p > 0.05) nor by Bk receptor activation (median increase of peak current amplitude: 6‥, range: −11‥ to 17‥, n = 12, p > 0.05; Fig.2 (C and E); median increase ofI 50 s: 1‥, range: −25‥ to 17‥,n = 12, p > 0.05). Thus, it seems that modulation by the neuropeptides is subunit-specific and that the P2X3 subunit is responsible for modulation of the P2X2/3 heteromer. It is known that the desensitization of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors is directly accelerated by SP without the need of the SP receptor (22Clapham D.E. Neher E. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1984; 347: 255-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In oocytes expressing only P2X2/3receptors but no SP receptor, the neuropeptide was not able to sensitize currents through P2X2/3 (median increase of peak amplitude: −2‥, range: −5‥ to 10‥, n = 6, Fig. 2(D and E); median increase ofI 50 s: 6‥, range: −3‥ to 17‥,n = 6). This shows that the effect is mediated by the SP receptor and suggests pathways downstream of the receptor to be responsible for sensitization of P2X receptors. Since SP and Bk are supposed to act via the phospholipase C/protein kinase C pathway, we tested different pharmacological agents interacting with kinases for their effect on sensitization of P2X receptors. Oocytes expressing P2X3 and the SP receptor were incubated with the serine/threonine-kinase inhibitor staurosporine (10 μm) for 10 to 30 min. After this incubation, application of SP no longer increased ATP-activated peak or steady state currents (median increase in peak amplitude: −6‥, range: −16‥ to 9‥,n = 10, Fig. 3 (A and D); median increase in I 50 s: 3‥, range: −12‥ to 16‥,n = 7), suggesting the involvement of protein kinase in the potentiating process. In addition, the effect of SP could be mimicked using the phorbol ester 4β-PMA (10 nm for 50 s; median increase of peak current: 66‥, range: 7–337‥,n = 22; Fig. 3 (B and D); median increase of I 50 s: 94‥, range: 17–265‥,n = 22) but not using the biologically inactive stereoisomer 4α-PMA (data not shown). Moreover, as shown in Fig.3 C, during PMA application SP was unable to further sensitize the current (median increase of peak current: 4‥, range: −6‥ to 10‥, n = 4; Fig. 3 (C andD); median increase of I 50 s: 8‥, range: −9‥ to 42‥, n = 4), suggesting that the same mechanism underlies both effects. Together, these experiments suggest that protein kinase C mediates the stimulation of ATP-gated currents through P2X3 and P2X2/3. Intracellular signaling cascades most likely act on intracellular parts of the P2X receptors. To identify these regions, we made use of the differential effect of SP on P2X2 and P2X3 designing chimeras between P2X2 and P2X3. Exchanging the intracellular C termini yielded active channels. The P2X2 receptor with P2X3 C terminus (P2X2-C-X3) formed rather slowly desensitizing ion channels, which were, however, faster than P2X2 wild type channels (mean of desensitization rates ± S.D. 16.7 ± 0.7 s, n = 6, in comparison to 95.6 ± 32.4 s with P2X2 wild type,n = 8). As shown in Fig. 4 A, the P2X2-C-X3 receptor gained potentiation by SP. It showed an increase in the steady state current that lasted longer than the effect on P2X3 but was still transient (median increase of peak current: 62‥, range: 48–92‥, n = 10, Fig. 4 (A and E); median increase ofI 50 s: 71‥, range: 48–101‥,n = 10). P2X3 receptors with P2X2 C terminus (P2X3-C-X2) showed faster desensitization than the P2X3 receptor and high agonist affinity as the P2X3 receptor. Because of the fast desensitization of the P2X3-C-X2 chimera, we investigated this chimera as heteromer with P2X2. The P2X3-C-X2/P2X2 receptor activated either with αβ-meATP or with ATP lost SP regulation (median increase of peak current: −7‥, range: −21‥ to −3‥,n = 4; Fig. 4 (B and E)), implicating the cytoplasmic C terminus as an important region for regulation by SP. To further investigate the role of the P2X2 C terminus we tested the P2X2–2 receptor, a P2X2 splice variant in which 69 amino acids of the cytoplasmic C terminus are missing (20Brändle U. Spielmanns P. Osteroth R. Sim J. Surprenant A. Buell G. Ruppersberg J.P. Plinkert P.K. Zenner H.P. Glowatzki E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 C shows that this splice variant was also sensitized by SP (median increase of peak current: 36‥, range: 18–49‥, n = 4, Fig. 4 E; median increase ofI 50 s: 33‥, range: 23–50‥, n= 4). Thus, the P2X3 C terminus is not necessary for SP modulation. Rather, it seems that the wild type P2X2 C terminus inhibits the modulation by SP and that this inhibition is relieved in the splice variant. This hypothesis is further supported by a gain-of-regulation with a P2X2 receptor truncated at position 401 (P2X2Δ401) deleting 72 of the about 116 cytoplasmic amino acids at the C terminus. This mutant showed kinetics similar to that of the P2X2 wild type but gained SP regulation (median increase of peak current: 21‥, range: 16–23‥,n = 3, Fig. 4 (D and E); median increase of I 50 s: 21‥, range: 16–24‥,n = 3). N-terminal chimeras were also functional. A P2X2 receptor with P2X3 N terminus (P2X2-N-X3) was not regulated by SP, whereas a P2X3 receptor with P2X2 N terminus (P2X3-N-X2) was regulated by SP (data not shown), confirming that the C terminus controls regulation of P2X receptors by SP. Regulation by SP might be due to direct phosphorylation of the channel protein. We, therefore, constructed a series of point mutations, either single or in combination, of cytoplasmic serine or threonine residues in the P2X3receptor. These mutations include all intracellular serines or threonines that are in a consensus sequence for phosphorylation by protein kinase A or C (R/K(X 0–3)S/ T(X 0–3)R/K). The effect of these mutations is summarized in Fig.5. Combined mutation of all serines or threonines that are in a consensus sequence for phosphorylation at the cytoplasmic C terminus (P2X3T364A/T365A/T369A/S371A/T382A/S387A/T388A) leads to a functional, SP-regulated channel, rendering it rather unlikely that direct phosphorylation of the C terminus mediates the regulation. Moreover, there is no C-terminal consensus site conserved between P2X3 and P2X2–2. Single or combined amino acid substitutions of the serines or threonines at the N terminus lead in all cases to functional, regulated channels with the exception of P2X3T12A, which was not measurable. This threonine residue is conserved in all known P2X receptors, contained in a conserved consensus sequence for phosphorylation (TXK/R) and has recently been shown to be phosphorylated in the P2X2 receptor (19Boué-Grabot E. Archambault V. Séguéla P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10190-10195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Mutation of lysine 14 in P2X3 contained in the consensus sequence (P2X3K14Q) similarly leads to not measurable channels, whereas mutation of threonine 13 leads to functional, regulated channels (Fig. 5), identifying the consensus motif TXK as crucial for normal channel function. A T12E mutant mimicking constitutive phosphorylation was also not measurable, demonstrating that it is not just the presence of a negative charge at this position, which is important. Mutation of the corresponding threonine in either the P2X2-C-X3 or the P2X3-N-X2 chimera, or the P2X2–2splice variant leads always to not measurable channels, rendering it impossible to directly assess functional consequences of this mutation. P2X2–2 possesses, apart from this completely conserved threonine, only one other serine/threonine at its cytoplasmic N terminus. Mutation of this second serine (serine 11) leads to functional, regulated channels. Together, these results suggest that the completely conserved threonine at the cytoplasmic N terminus of P2X receptors is the best candidate for an amino acid directly phosphorylated after stimulation by SP. Alternatively, protein kinases might phosphorylate an unrelated protein, which controls activity of P2X receptors. Both P2X3 and P2X2/3 receptors are expressed in sensory neurons, and there is accumulating evidence that they have a specific role in nociception (17Cockayne D.A. Hamilton S.G. Zhu Q.M. Dunn P.M.

Moreover, activation of P2X3 leads to a much stronger nociceptive effect in inflamed compared with normal tissue (27Hamilton S.G. Wade A. McMahon S.B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 126: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 28Stanfa L.C. Kontinen V.K. Dickenson A.H. Br. J.

Neurosci. 2000; 20 (, 1–5): RC90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it seems that sensitization of nociceptors leads to a bigger response to ATP. Our study addressed the underlying mechanism by reconstituting the relevant signaling cascades in Xenopusoocytes. Sensitization of nociceptors is due to the release of inflammatory mediators such as the neuropeptides SP (29Woolf C.J. Mannion R.J. Neumann S. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1063-1066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and Bk (30Cesare P. McNaughton P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). SP is expressed in small diameter afferent neurons (31Hokfelt T. Kellerth J.O. Nilsson G. Pernow B. Science. 1975; 190: 889-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 32McCarthy P.W. Lawson S.N. Neuroscience. 1989; 28: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and is released upon peripheral nociceptive stimulation in the periphery as well as in the superficial dorsal horn (33Duggan A.W. Hendry I.A. Morton C.R. Hutchison W.D. Zhao Z.Q. Brain Res. 1988; 451: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). It binds with high affinity to the tachykinin receptor (NK-1), which is expressed in neurons of the spinal cord (34Brown J.L. Liu H. Maggio J.E. Vigna S.R. Mantyh P.W. Basbaum A.I. J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 356: 327-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 35Littlewood N.K. Todd A.J. Spike R.C. Watt C. Shehab S.A. Neuroscience. 1995; 66: 597-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). There are conflicting data, however, on expression of the SP (NK-1) receptor in primary afferent neurons from the DRG (34Brown J.L. Liu H. Maggio J.E. Vigna S.R. Mantyh P.W. Basbaum A.I. J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 356: 327-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar,36Dray A. Pinnock R.D. Neurosci. Lett. 1982; 33: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 37Hu H.Z. Li Z.W. Si J.Q.

Although the receptor has not been identified by immunocytochemistry (34Brown J.L. Liu H. Maggio J.E. Vigna S.R. Mantyh P.W. Basbaum A.I. J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 356: 327-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) SP can elicit an inward current in DRG neurons, which is mediated by a non-selective cation channel (37Hu H.Z. Li Z.W. Si J.Q. Neuroscience. 1997; 77: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Moreover, it had been shown that application of SP to sensory neurons can potentiate currents, which are gated by ATP (39Hu H.Z. Li Z.W. Brain Res. 1996; 739: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This suggests a modulation of P2X receptors by SP also in sensory cells. So far, neither the P2X subunit involved nor the intracellular signaling cascade was known. The main receptor for Bk in primary afferent neurons is the B2 receptor, which couples similar to the SP receptor to a signaling pathway using Gq and phospholipase C and leading to a rise in intracellular Ca2+. Our study demonstrates that the inflammatory mediators SP and Bk can potentiate currents through P2X3 and P2X2/3receptors in Xenopus oocytes. Heteromeric P2X2/3 receptor channels showed a decrease of the desensitization rate after treatment with inflammatory mediators, which could explain the potentiation. As the potentiation was only transient, we were not able to measure the time constant for recovery. Rate of desensitization of P2X3 was not significantly changed, but the fast desensitization rate of this channel may not be reliably determined in whole oocytes. We, therefore, propose that an effect on desensitization rate is the underlying mechanism of current potentiation. Evidence that protein kinase C mediates potentiation of P2X receptors in oocytes is severalfold. (i) Both the SP and the Bk receptor are coupled to phospholipase C activation; (ii) phorbol ester can mimic the effect; (iii) stimulation by inflammatory mediators and phorbol ester is not additive; and, finally, (iv) the serine/threonine kinase inhibitor staurosporine blocks potentiation of P2X receptors. We could not unequivocally identify a phosphorylation site on P2X3 receptors responsible for the modulation. Our chimeras between P2X2 and P2X3 implicated the cytoplasmic C terminus as crucial. The results from site-directed-mutagenesis suggest, however, that there is no phosphorylation site on the cytoplasmic C terminus of P2X3implicated in the effect. (i) Mutation of all the serine/threonine residues in any consensus site at the same time (7 out of a total of 12 serine/threonine) yielded functional, regulated channels; (ii) there is no serine or threonine in any consensus site conserved between P2X2–2 and P2X3; and (iii) there is only one serine/threonine that is contained in both P2X2–2 and P2X2Δ401. Still, it might be that phosphorylation sites are not contained in a classic consensus site and are not conserved between P2X2 and P2X3. Mutants at the N terminus were either functional and regulated or not measurable. The non-measurable mutants all concerned a highly conserved consensus site for phosphorylation by PKC (TXR/K). Interestingly, Séguéla and colleagues (19Boué-Grabot E. Archambault V. Séguéla P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10190-10195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated phosphorylation of P2X2 on this threonine. Their results suggested that the receptor is constitutively phosphorylated and that this phosphorylation leads to the slow desensitization rate of P2X2. Accelerated desensitization of the already rapidly desensitizing P2X3 receptor would explain that we were not able to measure the corresponding P2X3T12A mutant. These findings strongly support phosphorylation of this site also in P2X3 and speak in favor of a decreased desensitization rate as the underlying mechanism of current potentiation. This would imply that the C terminus interacts with the N terminus to control phosphorylation. In this model the C terminus of P2X2 would stabilize phosphorylation at the N-terminal TXK site leading to constitutive phosphorylation, whereas the C terminus of P2X3 and the splice variant P2X2–2 would destabilize phosphorylation, allowing phosphorylation to be regulated. This would also imply that splicing at the C terminus of P2X2 would be a means to control modulation of receptor activity by phosphorylation at the N terminus. Interaction of cytoplasmic termini has already been shown for other structurally related channels (40Schulte U. Hahn H. Konrad M. Jeck N. Derst C. Wild K. Weidemann S. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. Ludwig J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15298-15303Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). As we cannot directly prove the implication of the N-terminal phosphorylation site in the regulation of P2X receptor activity, we still must consider, however, the possibility that a different, so far unidentified protein may be phosphorylated and control activity of P2X receptors. Hu et al. (39Hu H.Z. Li Z.W. Brain Res. 1996; 739: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) reported that application of 100 nm SP leads to a transient potentiation by 127.2 ± 6.7‥ of ATP-gated currents in sensory neurons. This potentiation was blocked by the protein kinase inhibitor H7 and the SP (NK1) receptor antagonist spantide, resembling our own results and suggesting that the underlying mechanism is active in sensory neurons. For Bk it is well established that it acts directly on primary sensory neurons, and several studies have suggested that PKC mediates this effect (41Burgess G.M. Mullaney I. McNeill M. Dunn P.M. Rang H.P. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 3314-3325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42McGuirk S.M. Dolphin A.C. Neuroscience. 1992; 49: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 43Cesare P. Dekker L.V. Sardini A. Parker P.J. McNaughton P.A. Neuron. 1999; 23: 617-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Moreover, Bk sensitizes heat-activated currents in isolated nociceptors, and this sensitization can be mimicked by phorbol ester and blocked by staurosporine (44Cesare P. McNaughton P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9-15435Crossref Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Our results now suggest that another target for PKC in nociceptors may be P2X3 and that Bk may sensitize different pain-related ion channels using similar mechanisms. At the same time, we show that different inflammatory mediators may converge on the same ion channel. Together, we show that modulation of P2X3 and P2X2/3 activity by the inflammatory mediators SP and Bk may account for sensitization of nociceptors to the action of ATP. We are grateful to Drs. J. Krause and W. Müller-Esterl for the gift of the SP and Bk receptors, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2083945745,"Activated protein C (APC) is a natural anticoagulant in plasma that down-regulates the coagulation cascade by degrading factors Va and VIIIa. In addition to its anticoagulant function, APC is also known to possess a profibrinolytic property. This property of APC has been attributed to its ability to neutralize PAI-1, thereby increasing the concentration of tissue plasminogen activator in plasma leading to up-regulation of the fibrinolytic cascade. This hypothesis, however, has not been well established, since the concentration of PAI-1 in plasma is low, and its reactivity with APC is very slow in a purified system. Here we demonstrate that vitronectin enhances the reactivity of PAI-1 with APC ∼300-fold making PAI-1 the most efficient inhibitor of APC thus far reported (k2 = 1.8 × 105m−1 s−1). We further show that PAI-1 inhibition of the Glu192 → Gln mutant of APC is enhanced ∼40-fold, independent of vitronectin, suggesting that vitronectin partially overcomes the inhibitory interaction of PAI-1 with Glu192. Additionally, we show that PAI-1 inhibition of the Lys37-Lys38-Lys39 → Pro-Gln-Glu mutant of APC is severely impaired, suggesting that, similar to tissue plasminogen activator, the basic 39-loop of APC plays a critical role in the reaction.

It is established that APC inhibits thrombin generation by limited proteolytic degradation of two essential procoagulant cofactors, Va and VIIIa (2Esmon C.T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 1-5Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 3Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31869-31880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Walker F.J. Fay P.J. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2561-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of APC as an antithrombotic factor is documented by the observation that inherited and acquired deficiency of protein C is associated with venous thromboembolic disease (10Griffin J.H. Evatt B. Zimmerman T.S. Kleiss A.J. Wideman C. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 68: 1370-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar, 11Broekmans A.W. Veltkamp J.J. Bertina R.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1983; 309: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In contrast to its anticoagulant function, the mechanism by which APC exerts its profibrinolytic function is not well established. Several types of whole blood clot lysis assays in vitro have indicated that APC functions as a profibrinolytic factor in a plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1)-dependent manner (6Sakata Y. Loskutoff D.J. Gladson C.L. Hekman C.M. Griffin J.H. Blood. 1986; 68: 1218-1223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7de Fouw N.J. Van Hinsberg V.W.M. de Jong Y.F. Haverkate F. Bertina R.M. Thromb.

Haemostasis. 1988; 60: 328-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Based on these results, it has been hypothesized that neutralization of this inhibitor by APC increases the concentration of plasminogen activators in plasma leading to up-regulation of the fibrinolytic cascade (6Sakata Y. Loskutoff D.J. Gladson C.L. Hekman C.M. Griffin J.H. Blood. 1986; 68: 1218-1223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In support of this mechanism, incubation of active APC, but not diisopropyl fluorophosphate-inactivated APC, with the endothelial cell culture conditioned media or with PAI-1 partially purified from platelets resulted in SDS-stable APC-PAI-1 complexes (7de Fouw N.J. Van Hinsberg V.W.M. de Jong Y.F. Haverkate F. Bertina R.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1987; 57: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This has suggested that APC interacts with PAI-1 as other serine proteinases interact with their target serine proteinase inhibitors of the serpin superfamily (12Gettins P.G.W. Patston P.A. Olson S.T. Serpins: Structure, Function and Biology. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1996Google Scholar). Despite the evidence that APC interacts with PAI-1 by a typical serine proteinase-serpin reaction mechanism, no kinetic studies exist in the literature to indicate that human APC can react with PAI-1 in a homologous system. This is probably due to the fact that prolonged incubation of human APC with high concentrations of PAI-1 results in a minimal decline in the activity of the proteinase. In support of this, results of an in vitro clot lysis assay using purified components of the APC anticoagulant pathway have disputed whether this mechanism can contribute to the profibrinolytic property of human APCin vivo (8de Fouw N.J. de Jong Y.F. Haverkate F. Bertina R.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1988; 60: 328-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Such results have raised the possibility that other factor(s) in blood may be involved in APC up-regulation of the fibrinolytic cascade (8de Fouw N.J. de Jong Y.F. Haverkate F. Bertina R.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1988; 60: 328-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the current study, vitronectin, an abundant plasma and platelet glycoprotein (13Preissner K.T. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 275-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 14Erickson L.A. Ginsberg M.H. Loskutoff D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 1465-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 15Kruithof E.K.O. Tran-Thang C. Bachmann F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1986; 55: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), has been identified as the cofactor that dramatically improves the ability of APC to react with PAI-1. It is shown that vitronectin enhances the reactivity of APC with PAI-1 ∼300-fold, revealing PAI-1 to be the most efficient inhibitor of APC reported. The possible mechanism of the APC-vitronectin-PAI-1 interaction was studied by analyzing the kinetics of PAI-1 inactivation of two mutants of APC, in one of which the three basic Lys37-Lys38-Lys39 residues of APC were replaced with Pro-Gln-Glu (KKK/PQE) and in the other Glu192 was substituted with Gln (E192Q). The reactivity of KKK/PQE with PAI-1 was dramatically impaired, although the extent of the cofactor effect of vitronectin was not affected. On the other hand, the E192Q mutant of APC reacted efficiently with PAI-1 independent of vitronectin. These results suggest that similar to plasminogen activators, the basic 39-loop of APC is critical for a productive interaction with PAI-1. In contrast, Glu192 restricts the reactivity of APC with PAI-1 and vitronectin appears to overcome this inhibitory interaction. The possible physiological significance of these findings to APC regulation of coagulation and fibrinolytic cascades is discussed. Methodologies for expression, purification, and activation of the wild type and Glu192→ Gln (E192Q) mutant of human protein C were described previously (16Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19943-19948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein C mutant in which three basic residues, Lys37-Lys38-Lys39, of 39-loop were replaced with Pro-Gln-Glu (KKK/PQE, residues found at the identical region of thrombin) was prepared by the same procedures. All derivatives were expressed in HEK 293 cells and purified to homogeneity on an immunoaffinity column using the Ca2+-dependent monoclonal antibody, HPC4, as described previously (17Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26104-26109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein C (100 μg) was incubated with thrombin (10 μg) in 0.1 m NaCl, 0.02 mTris-HCl, pH 7.4 (TBS buffer) containing 5 mm EDTA for 2 h at 37 °C. Activated protein C was separated from thrombin by a fast protein liquid chromatography Mono Q column developed with 40-ml linear gradient from 0.1 to 1.0 m NaCl, 0.02m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Partially and fully carboxylated APC were eluted at ∼0.3 and ∼0.4 m NaCl, respectively. Human plasma proteins APC and protein S were purchased from Hematologic Technologies Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). Recombinant human active PAI-1 (product number PAI-A, 95 ± 5% active as titrated by urokinase-type plasminogen activator), and plasma-derived human native vitronectin (product number HVN) were purchased from Molecular Innovations, Inc. (Royal Oak, MI). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis confirmed the homogeneity of all proteins used in this study. Phospholipid vesicles containing 80% phosphatidylcholine and 20% phosphatidylserine (PC/PS) or 40% phosphatidylcholine, 20% phosphatidylserine, and 40% phosphatidylethanolamine (PC/PS/PE) were prepared as described previously (18Smirnov M.D. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 816-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chromogenic substrate Spectrozyme PCa (SpPCa) was purchased from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT). The PAI-1 inactivation rates of APC derivatives were measured under pseudo-first-order rate conditions by a discontinuous assay method as described previously (19Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13138-13142Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 nm APC was incubated at room temperature with 50–2000 nm PAI-1 in 50-μl reactions in TBS buffer containing 2.5 mm Ca2+, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000. At the end of the incubation time (5–60 min) 50 μl of SpPCa was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. The remaining activity of APC was measured from the rate of chromogenic substrate hydrolysis at 405 nm using aVmax Kinetics Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). The pseudo-first-order inactivation rate constants (k′) were calculated by fitting the time-dependent change of the APC activity to a first-order rate equation using the Enzfitter computer program (R. J. Leatherbarrow, Elsevier, Biosoft). The second-order inactivation rate constants (k2) were calculated from the slope of the linear plot of the k′ values versusPAI-1 concentrations as described previously (19Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13138-13142Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In all assays, less than 10% chromogenic substrate was utilized. For the inactivation studies in the presence of vitronectin, first, the cofactor concentration dependence of PAI-1 inactivation of APC was studied by incubating 2 nm APC with 50 nm PAI-1 and 0–2.5 μm vitronectin at room temperature in 50-μl reactions in the same buffer system described above. At the end of the incubation time (5 min), 50 μl of 1 mm SpPCa in TBS buffer was added, and the k′ values at different vitronectin concentrations were determined as described above. Detailed kinetic studies in the presence of an optimal concentration of vitronectin (600 nm) were then carried out by incubating APC (2 nm) with varying concentrations of PAI-1 (6.25–100 nm) for 2.5–20 min in the same TBS buffer system. The k′ values were calculated as described above and plotted versus PAI-1 concentrations. The maximal inhibition rate constant (k) and Kd values were determined by fitting the saturable dependence of k′ values on PAI-1 concentrations to a hyperbolic equation as described previously (20Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14592-14599Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The inhibition stoichiometry for PAI-1 inactivation of APC in the presence of vitronectin and APC E192Q in both the absence and presence of vitronectin were determined by titration of 20 nm APC with increasing concentrations of PAI-1 corresponding to PAI-1/APC molar ratios of 0–2, in the absence or presence of 600 nmvitronectin in the same TBS buffer system as described previously (20Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14592-14599Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The residual amidolytic activities of the wild type and mutant enzymes were monitored for up to 12 h at room temperature by the hydrolysis of SpPCa as described above. After completion of the inhibition reactions, the PAI-1/APC ratios were plottedversus the residual activities of enzymes, and the inhibition stoichiometry were determined from thex-intercept of the linear regression fit of the inhibition data. APC is an important anticoagulant plasma proteinase that shuts down thrombin generation by limited proteolysis of factors Va and VIIIa, essential cofactors of the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of the clotting cascade, respectively (2Esmon C.T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 1-5Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 21Mann K.G. Jenny R.J. Krishnaswamy S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 915-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). In addition to down-regulation of coagulation, in vivo (4Comp P.C. Esmon C.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 68: 1221-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and in vitro (5Sakata Y. Curriden S.

Blood. 1986; 68: 1218-1223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), studies have indicated that APC promotes fibrinolysis by neutralizing PAI-1. This property of APC has been hypothesized to increase the concentration of plasminogen activators in plasma leading to up-regulation of the fibrinolytic cascade (5Sakata Y. Curriden S. Lawrence D. Griffin J.H. Loskutoff D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1121-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 6Sakata Y. Loskutoff D.J. Gladson C.L. Hekman C.M. Griffin J.H. Blood. 1986; 68: 1218-1223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the profibrinolytic property of APC has been relatively well documented by several types of in vitro whole blood clot lysis assays (6Sakata Y. Loskutoff D.J. Gladson C.L. Hekman C.M. Griffin J.H. Blood. 1986; 68: 1218-1223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7de Fouw N.J. Van Hinsberg V.W.M. de Jong Y.F. Haverkate F. Bertina R.M. Thromb.

Haemostasis. 1988; 60: 328-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), there has been no study in a purified system of the kinetics of the APC-PAI-1 interaction with human proteins. This is due to the fact that human APC reacts with PAI-1 very slowly. As shown in Table I, a second-order inhibition rate constant of ∼6 × 102m−1 s−1for PAI-1 inhibition of APC was determined. This same value was obtained if PAI-1 inhibition of APC was monitored in the presence of 220 nm protein S and 0–50 μm PC/PS or PC/PS/PE vesicles (data not shown). These results are consistent with other data in the literature (8de Fouw N.J. de Jong Y.F. Haverkate F. Bertina R.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1988; 60: 328-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, unlike the potent profibrinolytic effect observed for APC in vivo (4Comp P.C. Esmon C.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 68: 1221-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), in whole blood clot lysis assays (6Sakata Y. Loskutoff D.J. Gladson C.L. Hekman C.M. Griffin J.H. Blood. 1986; 68: 1218-1223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in endothelial cell culture supernatants (5Sakata Y. Curriden S. Lawrence D. Griffin J.H. Loskutoff D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1121-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), kinetic data in the purified system suggest that human APC neutralization of PAI-1 by itself may not significantly contribute to up-regulation of the fibrinolytic cascade. Alternatively, there may be other factor(s) in plasma or in endothelial cell culture supernatants that enhances the ability of APC to interact with PAI-1.Table IKinetic constants for PAI-1 inhibition of the APC derivatives in the absence and presence of vitronectin−Cofactor+Vitronectin-Fold accelerationAPC(5.7 ± 0.5) × 102(1.8 ± 0.4) × 105∼300APC E192Q(2.2 ± 0.4) × 104(2.9 ± 0.8) × 105∼10APC KKK/PQE(3.8 ± 0.4) × 101(9.5 ± 1.0) × 103∼250The second-order inhibition rate constants (k2 inm−1 s−1) in the absence of vitronectin were determined from the linear slope of the plot of the k′ values versus PAI-1 concentrations (50–2000 nm) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In the presence of vitronectin (600 nm), the maximal inhibition rate constant (k) and Kd values were determined by fitting the saturable dependence of k′ values on PAI-1 concentrations (6–100 nm) to a hyperbolic equation as shown in Fig. 2 A and Scheme 1.

PAI-1 is a serpin, which similar to other inhibitory serpins, inactivates its target proteinases by binding to their active sites through an exposed reactive center loop and undergoes a conformational change that traps the enzymes in inactive, stable complexes (22Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. Day D.E. Berkenpas M.B. Verhamme I.M. Kvassman J.-O. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25309-25312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Previously, it has been demonstrated that incubation of active APC, but not diisopropyl fluorophosphate-inactivated APC, with endothelial cell culture conditioned media (6Sakata Y. Loskutoff D.J. Gladson C.L. Hekman C.M. Griffin J.H. Blood. 1986; 68: 1218-1223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7de Fouw N.J. Van Hinsberg V.W.M. de Jong Y.F. Haverkate F. Bertina R.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1987; 57: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) results in SDS-stable APC-PAI-1 complexes, suggesting that PAI-1 interacts with APC by a similar mechanism. Unlike other inhibitory serpins, however, PAI-1 in plasma exists in both active and latent forms (23van Mourik J.A. Lawrence D.A. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14914-14921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Lawrence D.A. Berkenpas M.B. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15223-15228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The active form of PAI-1 has a short half-life, unless it binds to vitronectin (24Lawrence D.A. Berkenpas M.B. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15223-15228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vitronectin is a glycoprotein that is known to bind PAI-1 with a high affinity to stabilize the active conformation of the serpin (24Lawrence D.A. Berkenpas M.B. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15223-15228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Ehrlich H.J. Gebbink R.K. Keijer J. Linders M. Preissner K.T. Pannekoek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13029-13035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Noting the abundance of vitronectin in plasma or platelets (13Preissner K.T. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 275-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) and in endothelial cell culture supernatants (26van Meijer M. Smilde A. Tans G. Nesheim M. Pannekoek H. Horrevoets A.J.G. Blood. 1997; 90: 1874-1882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it was hypothesized that vitronectin may function as a cofactor to enhance the reactivity of APC with PAI-1, potentially accounting for its profibrinolytic activity observed in previous in vivo andin vitro blood clot lysis assays. In agreement with this hypothesis, it was found that vitronectin dramatically accelerates the reactivity PAI-1 with APC in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.1). The pseudo-first-order rate constant (k′) for PAI-1 inactivation of APC at an optimal concentration of vitronectin in large molar excess over PAI-1 was determined at several concentrations of PAI-1 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Based on reported Kdvalues for the PAI-1-vitronectin binary complex interaction, PAI-1 was largely saturated with the cofactor protein under these conditions (27Lawrence D.L. Palaniappan S. Stefansson S. Olson S.T. Francis-Chmura A.M. Shore J.D. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7676-7680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A saturable dependence of k′ on PAI-1 concentration was observed for APC inhibition in the presence of vitronectin (Fig.2 A). Nonlinear regression analysis of k′ values according to a hyperbolic equation yielded values for the ternary complex dissociation constant,Kd, and the rate constant, k, for stable complex formation as shown in Scheme 1.APC+PAI­1·VN↔Kd=(22.5±4.5)nMAPC·PAI­1·VN→k=(4.1±0.2)×10−3s−1APC­PAI­1+VNSCHEME1The second-order inactivation rate constant (k2), determined from the ratio of the limiting rate constant, k, to the Kd value in Scheme 1 was 1.8 ± 0.4 × 105m−1 s−1, suggesting that vitronectin enhances the rate of the APC-PAI-1 reaction at least 300-fold (Table I). The observation that in the absence of vitronectin, k′ increases linearly with PAI-1 concentration over the same range (Fig. 2 B), indicates that the rate-enhancing effect of vitronectin is due to the promotion of PAI-1-APC encounter complex formation. Similar results were obtained whether the source of APC was from human plasma or from the mammalian cell expression system. Inactivation studies in the presence of excess hirudin further suggested that possible trace contamination of APC with thrombin does not influence the results. Unfractionated heparin maximally accelerated PAI-1 inactivation of APC only 4-fold (k2 = 2.4 × 103m−1 s−1) when tested in the presence of 1 μm heparin. Inhibition kinetic studies with activated Gla-domainless protein C suggested that the rate-accelerating effect of vitronectin requires the Gla-domain of protein C. No effect for vitronectin was detected in PAI-1 inhibition of activated Gla-domainless protein C (data not shown), possibly suggesting that binding of the APC Gla domain to vitronectin was important for the cofactor effect.Figure 2Dependence of pseudo-first-order rate constants (k′) for inactivation of APC by PAI-1 in the absence and presence of vitronectin.

The reactivity of the KKK/PQE mutant of APC with PAI-1 was markedly impaired in both the absence and presence of vitronectin, although the extent of the cofactor function of vitronectin did not appear to be affected with this mutant (Table I). This suggested that the 39-loop of APC is involved in a productive interaction with the reactive site loop of PAI-1 independent of vitronectin. The concentration dependence of PAI-1 inactivation of the mutant in the presence of vitronectin suggested that the Kd for ternary complex formation was not changed, but the rate constant,k, was impaired with this mutant (data not shown). PAI-1 has two acidic residues at the P4′ and P5′ positions (28Madison E.L. Goldsmith E.J. Gerard R.D. Gething M.-J.H. Sambrook J.F. Bassel-Duby R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3530-3533Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Previously, it has been demonstrated that the interactions of the basic residues of the 39-loop of plasminogen activators with these acidic residues is required for an efficient reaction with PAI-1 (29Madison E.L. Goldsmith E.J. Gething M.-J.H. Sambrook J. Gerard R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21423-21426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The same appears to be true for the reaction of the serpin with APC. Another residue, which is known to restrict the specificity of APC with plasma inhibitors, is Glu192 (16Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19943-19948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have indicated that substitution of Glu192 with Gln, a residue found at the identical site of trypsin and plasminogen activators, results in a mutant (E192Q) that, unlike wild type APC, rapidly reacts with both the serpin and Kunitz-type family of plasma protein inhibitors, including α1-antitrypsin and tissue factor pathway inhibitor, TFPI (30Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Inhibition kinetic studies with the E192Q mutant of APC revealed that this residue also plays a critical role in restricting the reactivity of APC with PAI-1. As shown in Table I, relative to wild type APC, the reactivity of PAI-1 with APC E192Q was markedly improved by ∼40-fold. Thus, similar to plasminogen activators, vitronectin was no longer required for efficient reaction of APC E192Q with PAI-1, although it still enhanced the rate of inhibition ∼10-fold (Table I). These results suggest that the cofactor function of vitronectin may in large part involve overcoming potentially inhibitory interactions occurring between the acidic residues in the reactive site loop of PAI-1 and the extended catalytic pocket of APC. Vitronectin is also known to markedly accelerate the reactivity of thrombin with PAI-1 (25Ehrlich H.J. Gebbink R.K. Keijer J. Linders M. Preissner K.T. Pannekoek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13029-13035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Naski M.C. Lawrence D.A. Mosher D.F. Podor T.J. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12367-12372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The exact mechanism by which vitronectin accelerates the reactivity of PAI-1 with thrombin is not known. Similar to the reaction with APC (Fig. 1), previous studies of the vitronectin concentration dependence of thrombin inactivation by PAI-1 has indicated that the rate of reaction slightly decreases at higher concentrations of vitronectin, possibly suggesting that vitronectin may function by a template mechanism (31Naski M.C. Lawrence D.A. Mosher D.F. Podor T.J. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12367-12372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, other kinetic studies, employing several mutant thrombin derivatives, have not confirmed such a cofactor mechanism for vitronectin function (20Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14592-14599Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thrombin also contains a Glu at position 192. Interestingly, the reactivity of thrombin E192Q with PAI-1 was also markedly improved independent of vitronectin, suggesting that vitronectin may accelerate PAI-1 inhibition of both proteinases by a similar mechanism (data not shown). In the case of thrombin, thrombomodulin occupancy of exosite 1 protects the proteinase from rapid inhibition by PAI-1 in the presence of vitronectin (20Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14592-14599Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To determine whether complex formation of APC with its cofactor protein S on membrane surfaces protects it from inhibition by the vitronectin-PAI-1 complex, kinetic studies were also carried out in the presence of human protein S (220 nm) on either PC/PS or PC/PS/PE vesicles in the range of 0–50 μg/ml. However, protein S did not influence the reactivity of APC with PAI-1 under either condition (data not shown). Thrombin is also known to cleave PAI-1 in the presence vitronectin (26van Meijer M. Smilde A. Tans G. Nesheim M. Pannekoek H. Horrevoets A.J.G. Blood. 1997; 90: 1874-1882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of the APC-PAI-1 reaction, however, a 1:1 stoichiometry was observed for both wild type and E192Q APC in the presence of vitronectin (data not shown). APC is known to circulate in plasma with a long half-life of 27 min (32Gruber A. Griffin J.H. Blood. 1992; 79: 2340-2348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is thought to be due to a poor reactivity of APC with plasma inhibitors. Protein C inhibitor and α1-antitrypsin were believed to be the best inhibitors of APC in circulation, based on reported second-order rate constants of ∼0.6–7 × 103m−1s−1 (33Shen L. Villoutreix B.O. Dahlbäck B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 1078-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 34Aznar J. Espana F. Estelles A. Royo M. Thromb.

Chem. 1990; 265: 2365-2369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively, and the known plasma concentrations of these inhibitors. A poor reactivity of APC with plasma inhibitors may allow basal levels of APC (∼2 ng/ml) to circulate as an endogenous anticoagulant under normal physiological conditions (32Gruber A. Griffin J.H. Blood. 1992; 79: 2340-2348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). APC has been demonstrated to function as a potent anticoagulant at such low concentrations (37Nicolaes G.A.F. Tans G. Thomassen M.C.L.G.D. Hemker H.C. Pabinger I. Varadi K. Schwarz H.P. Rosing J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21158-21166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). However, APC has been reported to exhibit a poor anticoagulant activity on activated platelets (38Jane S.M. Mitchell C.A. Hau L. Salem H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 39Camire R.M. Kalafatis M. Simioni P. Girolami A. Tracy P.B. Blood. 1998; 91: 2818-2829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon activation, platelets release very high concentrations of both PAI-1 and vitronectin (13Preissner K.T. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 275-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 14Erickson L.A. Ginsberg M.H. Loskutoff D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 1465-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 15Kruithof E.K.O. Tran-Thang C. Bachmann F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1986; 55: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Furthermore, specific binding sites for vitronectin on platelets following stimulation have been reported (40Thiagarajan P. Kelly K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3035-3038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The possible physiological significance of these observations is that the vitronectin-PAI-1 complexes on the platelet surface may inactivate the circulating basal APC to allow factor Va to assemble into the prothrombinase complex to generate thrombin in the initial phase of the blood clotting cascade. This can potentially account for the poor anticoagulant activity of APC on activated platelets. In addition, it has been noted previously that APC resistance assays using frozen, but not fresh plasma, containing platelets are associated with frequent false-positive APC sensitivity ratios (41Sidelmann J. Gram J. Pedersen O.D. Jespersen J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 993-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 42Shizuka R. Kanda T. Amagai H. Kobayashi I. Thromb. Res. 1995; 78: 189-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that components released from platelets during freezing and thawing may serve as substrates and/or inhibitors of APC interfering with this assay (41Sidelmann J. Gram J. Pedersen O.D. Jespersen J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 993-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Results of the current study suggest that this component is most likely vitronectin-PAI-1 complexes that are released and remain attached to the platelet surface, leading to inhibition of the proteinase in APC resistance assays. It appears, therefore, that vitronectin can modulate the activity of APC in both the clotting and fibrinolytic cascades.

In mammalian cells, Bcl-rambo was localized to mitochondria, and its overexpression induces apoptosis that is specifically blocked by the caspase inhibitors, IAPs, whereas inhibitors controlling upstream events of either the ‘death receptor’ (FLIP, FADD-DN) or the ‘mitochondrial’ pro-apoptotic pathway (Bcl-xL) had no effect. Surprisingly, the Bcl-rambo cell death activity was induced by its membrane-anchored C-terminal domain and not by the Bcl-2 homology region.

Kerr J.F. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251Crossref PubMed Scopus (6697) Google Scholar). Members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins are regulators of apoptosis that can be grouped into three sub-families (2Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4780) Google Scholar, 3Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3238) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 and several of its close relatives including Bcl-x, Bcl-w, andCaenorhabditis elegans CED-9 inhibit apoptosis, whereas structurally similar relatives such as Bax, Bak, Bok, and distant cousins such as Bik and Bim instead foster death. The Bcl-2 and Bax subfamilies share three of the four conserved Bcl-2 homology (BH)1 sequence motifs. In contrast, mammalian Bad, Bik/Nbk, Blk, Hrk, Bid, Bim/Bod, Noxa, andC. elegans EGL-1 share homology only within the short BH3 motif and are therefore called BH3-only proteins (2Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4780) Google Scholar, 3Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3238) Google Scholar). Most members of the wider family possess a hydrophobic C-terminal segment, which facilitates their interaction with the endoplasmic reticulum/nuclear envelope and/or the outer mitochondrial membrane, where the prosurvival members normally reside, and where most others assemble during apoptosis.The ability of the prosurvival and antisurvival family members to form heterodimers raises the possibility that each type might titrate the other, potentially accounting for their opposing actions. The relative concentrations of the opposing sub-family members would then determine whether the cell lives or dies (4Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5838) Google Scholar, 5Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 189-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of Bcl-2 initially suggested that its ability to inhibit cell death required binding to a pro-apoptotic family member (6Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar), but Bcl-xL mutants have been identified that do not bind Bax or Bak yet still block apoptosis (7Cheng E.H.Y. Levine B. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Hardwick J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Thus, it remains unclear whether the ability to associate with other family members is central to regulating apoptosis.To search for additional regulators of apoptosis, we have screened public data bases with a profile defining Bcl-2 family members. This search has yielded a novel BH4/BH3/BH1/BH2-containing protein, which we have denoted Bcl-rambo. Here we report its initial characterization.DISCUSSIONIn this report we describe the cloning and the initial characterization of a novel Bcl-2 family member, Bcl-rambo. Bcl-rambo contains all four conserved BH motifs and a C-terminal membrane anchor and is therefore predicted to be a member of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 subfamily. Unlike other members of this subfamily, such as Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, the BH-containing domain is separated from the membrane anchor by a unique 250-aa-long region. This C-terminal BHNo domain, which shares no significant sequence homology with other proteins in the data base, reveals very little information about a possible domain structure and function. The only notable feature is the presence of two short tandem repeats that both are rich in serines. One is located at a position where Bcl-2 members usually contain the membrane anchor domain, whereas the longer second repeat unit is found further downstream immediately preceding the transmembrane domain of Bcl-rambo (see Fig. 1).Surprisingly, it is this BHNo domain and not the Bcl-2 homology region that more efficiently induces cell death upon overexpression. It is currently unclear how this segment causes apoptosis. Bcl-rambo is localized to mitochondria, and because removal of the C-terminal membrane anchor results not only in the loss of mitochondrial localization but also of its cell death activity, it is likely that Bcl-rambo initiates the cell death pathway by inflicting damage to mitochondria. Indeed, cytochrome c release was detected upon Bcl-rambo overexpression. For the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 members such as Bax, it was proposed that they cause mitochondrial outer membrane damage by forming channels in agreement with their structural homology with bacterial toxins (19Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S.L. Ng S.L. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). Bcl-rambo appears to induce apoptosis, at least in part, independently of known mitochondrial signaling pathways. Overexpression of Bcl-xL (Fig. 6) and Bcl-2 (data not shown), which are known to efficiently block apoptosis induced by pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 members by inhibiting cytochrome crelease, had little effect on Bcl-rambo-mediated cell death. Moreover, a dominant-negative form of caspase-9, which blocks apoptosis induced by Apaf-1, showed only a moderate inhibitory effect suggesting that Bcl-rambo death activity is not dependent on the classical mitochondrial pathway. This conclusion is supported by the absence of interaction with more than 10 different Bcl-2 pro- and anti-apoptotic family members tested. Similarly, FLIP and a dominant-negative form of FADD, both potent inhibitors of the death receptor signaling pathway, do not block the Bcl-rambo-induced caspase-3 activation. Only inhibitors that interfere with the activity of the downstream caspase-3, such as members of the IAP family, are effective at blocking Bcl-rambo death activity. The p53-induced protein p53AIP1 is another example of a protein that is localized within mitochondria and that triggers apoptosis with an unknown mechanism (10Oda K. Arakawa H. Tanaka T. Matsuda K. Tanikawa C. Mori T. Nishimori H. Tamai K. Tokino T. Nakamura Y. Taya Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 849-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar).Taken together, Bcl-2-rambo, via its BHNo and MA domain, is likely to trigger death via an as yet to be discovered signaling pathway that joins other pro-apoptotic pathways at the level of caspase-3. It will be interesting to determine whether the Bcl-2 homology region of Bcl-rambo, carrying all four BH domains, also has an anti-apoptotic effect for example by inhibiting the pro-apoptotic activity of the BHNo domain. Identification of Bcl-rambo may therefore provide further insight into the complex mechanism of cell death regulation by the Bcl-2 family members.

This conclusion is supported by the absence of interaction with more than 10 different Bcl-2 pro- and anti-apoptotic family members tested. Similarly, FLIP and a dominant-negative form of FADD, both potent inhibitors of the death receptor signaling pathway, do not block the Bcl-rambo-induced caspase-3 activation. Only inhibitors that interfere with the activity of the downstream caspase-3, such as members of the IAP family, are effective at blocking Bcl-rambo death activity. The p53-induced protein p53AIP1 is another example of a protein that is localized within mitochondria and that triggers apoptosis with an unknown mechanism (10Oda K. Arakawa H. Tanaka T. Matsuda K.

Taken together, Bcl-2-rambo, via its BHNo and MA domain, is likely to trigger death via an as yet to be discovered signaling pathway that joins other pro-apoptotic pathways at the level of caspase-3. It will be interesting to determine whether the Bcl-2 homology region of Bcl-rambo, carrying all four BH domains, also has an anti-apoptotic effect for example by inhibiting the pro-apoptotic activity of the BHNo domain. Identification of Bcl-rambo may therefore provide further insight into the complex mechanism of cell death regulation by the Bcl-2 family members. We are grateful to Drs. David Huang and Andreas Strasser for providing us with many of the cDNA clones employed in this study. We thank Drs. Chris Benedict, Margot Thome, and Kim Burns for helpful comments."
https://openalex.org/W1973212066,"Cellular iron uptake and storage are coordinately controlled by binding of iron-regulatory proteins (IRP), IRP1 and IRP2, to iron-responsive elements (IREs) within the mRNAs encoding transferrin receptor (TfR) and ferritin. Under conditions of iron starvation, both IRP1 and IRP2 bind with high affinity to cognate IREs, thus stabilizing TfR and inhibiting translation of ferritin mRNAs. The IRE/IRP regulatory system receives additional input by oxidative stress in the form of H2O2 that leads to rapid activation of IRP1. Here we show that treating murine B6 fibroblasts with a pulse of 100 μmH2O2 for 1 h is sufficient to alter critical parameters of iron homeostasis in a time-dependent manner. First, this stimulus inhibits ferritin synthesis for at least 8 h, leading to a significant (50%) reduction of cellular ferritin content. Second, treatment with H2O2induces a ∼4-fold increase in TfR mRNA levels within 2–6 h, and subsequent accumulation of newly synthesized protein after 4 h. This is associated with a profound increase in the cell surface expression of TfR, enhanced binding to fluorescein-tagged transferrin, and stimulation of transferrin-mediated iron uptake into cells. Under these conditions, no significant alterations are observed in the levels of mitochondrial aconitase and the DivalentMetal Transporter DMT1, although both are encoded by two as yet lesser characterized IRE-containing mRNAs. Finally, H2O2-treated cells display an increased capacity to sequester 59Fe in ferritin, despite a reduction in the ferritin pool, which results in a rearrangement of59Fe intracellular distribution. Our data suggest that H2O2 regulates cellular iron acquisition and intracellular iron distribution by both IRP1-dependent and -independent mechanisms.

Cellular iron uptake involves binding of Tf to the cell-surface Tf receptor (TfR), followed by endocytosis. Within the acidified endosome, iron is released from the Tf-TfR complex and transported, most likely by the Divalent MetalTransporter DMT1, across the endosomal membrane to the cytosol, where it becomes bioavailable for the synthesis of iron proteins. Excess iron is stored in ferritin, a multisubunit protein consisting of H- and L-chains, that serves as the major intracellular iron storage device (reviewed in Refs. 1Ponka P. Beaumont C.

Sequestration of iron in ferritin is viewed as a detoxification step to reduce the risk of iron-mediated cell damage, which is based on the capacity of iron to catalyze the generation of toxic oxygen radicals (4Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (4450) Google Scholar). Balanced iron homeostasis is critical for health, and both iron deficiency as well as iron overload are associated with severe disorders (5Andrews N.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 1986-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar). At the cellular level, iron homeostasis is accomplished by the coordinate regulation of iron uptake and storage. The expression of TfR and ferritin is mainly controlled post-transcriptionally by iron regulatory proteins, IRP1 and IRP2. Under conditions of iron starvation, IRP1 and IRP2 are activated for high affinity binding to multiple “iron-responsive elements” (IREs) in the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of TfR mRNA and to a single IRE in the 5′-UTR of the mRNAs encoding both H- and L-ferritin chains. This stabilizes TfR mRNA (6Binder R. Horowitz J.A. Basilion J.P. Koeller D.M. Klausner R.D. Harford J.B.

Cell. 1998; 2: 383-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Conversely, failure of IRPs to bind to cognate IREs in iron-replete cells leads to degradation of TfR mRNA and synthesis of ferritin (reviewed in Refs. 8Hentze M.W. Kühn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The identification of additional IRE-containing mRNAs suggests that the functional significance of the IRE/IRP system stretches out beyond the control of cellular iron uptake and storage. The mRNAs encoding the enzymes 5-aminolevulinate synthase-2 (involved in erythroid heme synthesis), mammalian mitochondrial aconitase (m-aconitase), and the insect Ip subunit of succinate dehydrogenase (both catalyzing reactions in citric acid cycle) contain a “translation-type” IRE in their 5′-UTRs (11Melefors Ö.

IRP1 and IRP2 share extensive homology and belong to the family of iron-sulfur cluster isomerases that also includes m-aconitase. However, their activities are controlled by distinct mechanisms. In iron-loaded cells, IRP1 assembles a cubane 4Fe-4S cluster that converts it to a cytosolic aconitase (c-aconitase) and prevents IRE-binding, whereas IRP2 is oxidized and degraded by the proteasome. Iron starvation increases IRE- binding activity by disassembly of the 4Fe-4S cluster in IRP1 and stabilization/de novo synthesis of IRP2 (reviewed in Refs. 8Hentze M.W. Kühn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Iron regulatory proteins are subjected to regulation by additional iron-independent signals, including nitric oxide, hypoxia, and oxidative stress (reviewed in Refs.23Hanson E.S. Leibold E.A. Gene Expr. 1999; 7: 367-376PubMed Google Scholar, 24Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. Ignarro L. Nitric Oxide. Academic Press, San Diego2000: 293-313Crossref Google Scholar, 25Theil E.C. Eisenstein R.S. J.

Of particular interest is the rapid induction of IRE binding activity of IRP1 in response to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (26Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2917-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 27Martins E.A.L. Robalinho R.L. Meneghini R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), because this “reactive oxygen intermediate” is implicated in iron toxicity. In the presence of catalytic amounts of ferrous iron, H2O2 yields highly aggressive hydroxyl radicals (Fenton reaction) that readily attack membranes, proteins, and nucleic acids (4Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (4450) Google Scholar). Exposure of different cell types to micromolar concentrations of H2O2 is sufficient to induce a rapid conversion of IRP1 from c-aconitase to the IRE-binding protein within 30–60 min (26Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2917-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 27Martins E.A.L. Robalinho R.L. Meneghini R. Arch. Biochem.

Chem. 1999; 274: 21625-21630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In contrast to this, H2O2 does not affect the activity of IRP2 (30Pantopoulos K. Weiss G. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3781-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). It should be noted that reactive oxygen species, including H2O2, are widely viewed as participants in a multitude of signaling pathways. These involve calcium signaling, mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades, tyrosine phosphorylation, regulation of phosphatases and phospholipases, or activation of transcription factors (reviewed in Refs. 31Finkel T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar and 32Torres M. Forman H.J. Ignarro L. Nitric Oxide. Academic Press, San Diego2000: 329-342Google Scholar). The effects of H2O2 on cellular iron metabolism have been as yet only partially studied. We have previously utilized mouse B6 fibroblasts, a cell line predominantly expressing IRP1 and negligible levels of IRP2, to characterize the mechanism of IRP1 induction by H2O2 (26Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2917-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 28Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9802-9808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We also showed that a treatment of these cells with 100 μmH2O2 for 1 h inhibits ferritin synthesis, whereas longer treatments (4–6 h) increase TfR mRNA levels, as a result of IRP1 activation (26Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2917-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). However, these responses have not been correlated with the biological activity of TfR and ferritin, in terms of iron uptake and sequestration. Here we extend the previous studies and investigate the effects of H2O2 in the expression and function of several IRE-containing mRNAs, as reflected in the uptake of 59Fe-transferrin and intracellular management of 59Fe. Desferrioxamine (DFO) was purchased from Novartis (Dorval, Canada), and H2O2 was from Merck. Hemin, human apo- and holo-Tf, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated holo-Tf, and lactoferrin were from Sigma. B6 fibroblasts were grown and treated with H2O2 as described (26Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2917-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Cells were metabolically labeled for 2 h with (50 μCi/ml) Trans35S-label (ICN, a mixture of 70:30 [35S]methionine/cysteine) and solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 300 mmNaCl, and 1% Triton X-100). Cytoplasmic lysates (1 mg) were subjected to quantitative co-immunoprecipitation with 5 μl of rabbit polyclonal ferritin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 2 μl of mouse monoclonal TfR (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) antibodies. Sam68 was then immunoprecipitated from supernatants by addition of 0.5 μl of Sam68 antiserum (kindly provided by Dr. Stephane Richard). Immunoprecipitated material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE/autoradiography (11Melefors Ö. Goossen B. Johansson H.E. Stripecke R. Gray N.K. Hentze M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5974-5978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were solubilized in RIPA lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholate, and 0.1% (w/v) SDS). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and ferritin content was analyzed by an immunoturbidimetric assay with the Tine-quant® kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), according to the manufacturer's recommendations, in a Hitachi 917 turbidimeter. RNA prepared with the Trizol® reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) was analyzed by Northern blotting (26Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2917-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) with32P-radiolabeled mouse TfR, human ferritin H-chain, mouse β-actin, or mouse DMT1 cDNA probes. Total cell extracts (in RIPA lysis buffer) were analyzed by Western blotting (34Pantopoulos K. Gray N. Hentze M.W. RNA ( NY ). 1995; 1: 155-163PubMed Google Scholar) with antibodies against TfR (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), m-aconitase (a generous gift of Dr. Rick Eisenstein), actin (Sigma), or DMT1 (raised in rabbits against the peptide VFAEAFFGKTNEQVVE, which corresponds to amino acids 260–275 in human DMT1). Dilutions for antibodies are indicated in the respective figure legends. To determine cell surface expression or the Tf-binding capacity of TfR, cells were scraped, suspended in medium, and tumbled with either 5 μl/ml FITC-conjugated mouse TfR antibody (PharMingen) or with 50 μg/ml FITC-conjugated human Tf (Sigma), respectively. Where indicated, a 50-fold molar excess human holo-Tf or lactoferrin was added prior to FITC-Tf. Excess FITC label was removed by washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and analyzed for fluorescence on a cell sorter (Beckman Coulter). 59FeCl3 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was mixed with sodium citrate (1:50 molar ratio in a total volume of 1 ml) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The resulting 59Fe-citrate was mixed with apo-Tf (2:1 molar ratio); the volume was brought up to 4 ml in 0.6 mNaHCO3, and incubation was continued overnight.59Fe-Tf was separated from 59Fe-citrate on a Centricon Plus-20 filter (Amicon), and its concentration was calculated spectrophotometrically at 465 nm (ε = 4620m−1dm−1). Cells were labeled with59Fe-Tf in minimal essential medium containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaHCO3, and 1% bovine serum albumin. Labeling was terminated by washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cells were monitored for radioactivity on a γ-counter. For immunoprecipitation of59Fe-ferritin, cytoplasmic lysates were prepared in the same way as lysates of 35S-labeled cells (see above), and 1 mg was tumbled at 4 °C with 5 μl of rabbit polyclonal ferritin antibodies (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Following addition of protein A-coupled Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), immunoprecipitated material was washed twice in lysis buffer, and radioactivity was monitored on a γ-counter. We have shown previously that treatment of cells with micromolar concentrations of H2O2 results in rapid induction of IRP1 to bind to IREs and that IRE binding activity remains elevated for at least 4 h following removal of the inducer (30Pantopoulos K. Weiss G. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3781-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 33Pantopoulos K. Mueller S. Atzberger A. Ansorge W. Stremmel W. Hentze M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9802-9808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This observation prompted us to study the effects of H2O2 on the expression of TfR and ferritin, two crucial proteins of iron metabolism under the control of the IRE/IRP system. Our analysis covers intervals of up to 8 h following exposure of cells to a bolus of 100 μmH2O2, allowing IRP1 activity to peak and decrease to basal levels (30Pantopoulos K. Weiss G. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3781-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). No apparent toxicity was observed by the trypan blue exclusion assay, under all experimental conditions employed in this study, in line with earlier observations that exogenous H2O2 is very rapidly degraded by these cells (33Pantopoulos K. Mueller S. Atzberger A. Ansorge W. Stremmel W. Hentze M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9802-9808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a single bolus of 100 μmH2O2 is sufficient to sustain a threshold of ∼10 μm H2O2 for about 15 min, which is the minimum concentration required to elicit IRP1 activation (33Pantopoulos K. Mueller S. Atzberger A. Ansorge W. Stremmel W. Hentze M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9802-9808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Thus, we established experimental conditions to activate IRP1 and study the effects of H2O2 on cellular iron metabolism in the absence of potential toxic side effects of H2O2. B6 fibroblasts were first treated with 100 μm H2O2 for 1 h and metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 2 h either immediately or at different time points after treatment, and TfR and ferritin synthesis were assessed by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1, top panel). In cells previously treated with the iron chelator DFO (100 μm), TfR synthesis is stimulated 3.3-fold compared with untreated control cells, whereas synthesis of ferritin H- and L-chains is strongly inhibited (11 and 12% of control, respectively,lanes 1 and 2). Treatment with H2O2 initially does not affect TfR expression (lanes 2 and 3) but clearly stimulates TfR synthesis by 2- and 2.1-fold, within 4 and 6 h after its withdrawal, respectively (lanes 4-7). Soon afterward, TfR synthesis declines to almost control (1.1-fold) levels (lanes 8 and 9). In contrast to TfR, ferritin expression is affected immediately after H2O2treatment; synthesis of ferritin H- and L-chains is reduced to 29 and 22% of control (lanes 2 and 3), in agreement with earlier observations (26Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2917-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Ferritin synthesis remains at low levels even after 4 (28% for H- and 26% for L-chain) and 6 h (35% for H- and 31% for L-chain) following H2O2 withdrawal (lanes 4–7). After 8 h, ferritin synthesis only partially (60%) recovers, even though TfR synthesis has essentially returned to basal levels (lanes 8 and 9). As a control, the non-iron-regulated protein Sam68 (68-kDa Src substrateassociated during mitosis) was immunoprecipitated from TfR/ferritin-immunodepleted supernatants. Synthesis of Sam68 essentially remains unchanged during the course of the treatment (Fig. 1, bottom panel). Analysis by Northern blotting (Fig.2 A) reveals that exposure of cells to 100 μm H2O2 for 1 h leads to a 3.4-, 4.0-, and 4.5-fold increase in steady-state levels of TfR mRNA 2, 4, and 6 h after the treatment, respectively (top panel, lanes 2–5). TfR mRNA levels drop after 8 h but are still 1.7 times higher than control (lane 6). As expected, iron chelation with DFO leads to a profound (5.7-fold) induction of TfR mRNA (lane 1). In contrast to TfR, ferritin (at least H-chain) mRNA levels are not affected by iron chelation or H2O2 (middle panel). The same holds true for non-iron-regulated β-actin mRNA (bottom panel). Thus, the time-dependent stimulation of TfR synthesis by H2O2 (Fig. 1) correlates with an increase in TfR mRNA levels, whereas H2O2-mediated inhibition of ferritin synthesis appears to be translational. We employed an immunoturbidimetric assay to measure ferritin levels in cell extracts and to assess the effects of H2O2 on total cellular ferritin content (Fig. 2 B). As expected, iron perturbations are strongly reflected in the ferritin pool; exposure of cells to hemin increases ferritin levels 3-fold, whereas iron chelation dramatically reduces ferritin to 6% of control levels (lanes 1–3). Treatment with 100 μm H2O2 for 1 h initially decreases the ferritin content to 69% (lanes 3and 4). Further reductions to 55 and 42% are evident 2 and 4 h after H2O2 withdrawal, respectively (lanes 5 and 6). Ferritin concentration tends to increase very slightly to 49 and 47% after 6 and 8 h (lanes 7 and 8), in line with the partial recovery in de novo ferritin synthesis at these time points (Fig. 1). We conclude that H2O2 leads to a marked reduction in the ferritin pool for at least 8 h after the treatment. To examine whether stimulation of TfR synthesis by H2O2 is associated with an increase in TfR concentration, we analyzed steady-state levels of TfR by Western blotting (Fig. 2 C). Treatment of cells with 100 μm H2O2 for 1 h leads to gradual accumulation of TfR after 2–8 h (lanes 3–8). H2O2-mediated induction of TfR reaches a maximum 6 and 8 h after the treatment (1.9- and 1.8-fold, respectively). As expected, treatments with DFO or hemin result in 2.2-fold increase and 0.6-fold decrease of TfR, respectively (lanes 1–3). In this experiment, cells were solubilized in RIPA lysis buffer, to extract membrane-bound TfR efficiently, but similar results were obtained with cytoplasmic extracts (not shown). The data shown in Fig.2 C suggest that H2O2 stimulates TfR expression. We next designed experiments to address whether this is accompanied by increased Tf binding activity. The fraction of TfR expressed on the cell surface is crucial for Tf binding. In a previous report it was shown that H2O2 negatively affects the size of this fraction, at least in human hematopoietic K562 and HL-60 cells (35Malorni W. Testa U. Rainaldi G. Tritarelli E. Peschle C. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 241: 102-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In light of these findings, we analyzed relative changes in cell surface expression of TfR in mouse B6 fibroblasts by means of FACS, using FITC-conjugated TfR antibodies (Fig.3 A). The levels of TfR on the cell surface essentially remain unaltered within 2 h after exposure of cells to H2O2 (100 μmH2O2 for 1 h) (lanes 3–5), but increase by 1.4-, 1.5- and 1.9-fold within 4, 6, and 8 h, respectively (lanes 6–8). A profound cell surface expression of TfR is achieved by treatment with DFO, whereas administration of hemin does not appear to cause any notable alterations (lanes 1–3). By having established that exposure of cells to H2O2 is associated with increased expression of TfR, including its cell surface fraction, we then employed a functional assay to evaluate the effects of H2O2 on Tf binding activity. Cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated Tf under conditions allowing its binding to TfR. Changes in relative fluorescence were then monitored by FACS (Fig. 3 B). Following treatment with H2O2 (100 μm H2O2 for 1 h), cells were mixed with 50 μg/ml FITC-Tf, either at 4 °C for 2 h or at 37 °C for 40 min. Incubation at 4 °C inhibits recycling of TfR and thus serves to evaluate binding of FITC-Tf on the cell surface. Conversely, incubation at 37 °C is preferable to examine both cell surface-bound and internalized (endosomal) FITC-Tf levels. To facilitate displacement of serum-derived Tf from TfR, incubation at 4 °C was prolonged to 2 h. Under both experimental settings, FITC-Tf binding to TfR gradually increased 4–8 h following exposure of cells to H2O2 (Fig. 3 B, bars 3–8). The increase was slightly elevated when incubations were performed at 37 °C (compare 1.2-, 1.4-, and 1.7-fold at 4 °C with 1.4-, 1.7-, and 1.8-fold increase at 37 °C, 4, 6, and 8 h after treatment, respectively). Consistent with the data described above, iron chelation with DFO elicits stronger effects on FITC-Tf binding to TfR than H2O2 (up to 3.8-fold induction, Fig. 3 B, bar 2). As expected, the effects of hemin are inhibitory (bar 1). The specificity of the FITC-Tf binding assay is illustrated in Fig.3 C. Co-incubation of FITC-Tf with 50-fold excess non-labeled Tf competitor strongly reduces fluorescence intensity to 24.4% in untreated and to 10% in DFO pretreated cells. In contrast, addition of 50-fold excess lactoferrin as a nonspecific competitor only slightly interferes with FITC-Tf binding (∼15% reduction). Incubations with these competitors were performed at 37 °C, and similar results were obtained at 4 °C (not shown). Taken together, our findings suggest that exposure of B6 cells to H2O2 leads not only to an increase in TfR steady-state levels but also stimulates its cell surface expression and the Tf-binding capacity. These conditions are predicted to favor enhanced cellular iron uptake from Tf. To determine directly the effects of H2O2 on iron uptake, we incubated B6 cells with 5 μm59Fe-Tf for 2 h and measured cell-associated radioactivity on a γ-counter. Preliminary experiments indicated that this concentration of 59Fe-Tf is saturating (not shown). The results of the iron uptake experiment are depicted in Fig. 4 A. Untreated control fibroblasts internalize ∼10.5 pmol of59Fe/106 cells during the time of labeling (2 h). Exposure of B6 cells to 100 μmH2O2 for 1 h results in a modest (∼11.5%) but significant (p < 0.05 as estimated by Student's t test) increase in 59Fe uptake, 6–8 h after the H2O2 treatment. Iron starvation by overnight treatment with 100 μm DFO leads to a more pronounced (∼24.9%) increase in 59Fe uptake. Considering the profound effects of H2O2 and iron starvation on the expression of TfR and its Tf binding activity (Fig.3), the differences in 59Fe uptake in response to these stimuli are not particularly strong, suggesting that the Tf-TfR cycle may be subjected to additional controls. Nevertheless, these data show that H2O2-treated cells have an increased capacity to take up iron. Under the conditions of the iron uptake experiment (e.g.6–8 h following H2O2 treatment), ferritin synthesis is still partially repressed (Fig. 1), whereas cellular ferritin content has dropped to <50% of control levels (Fig.2 B). Since ferritin plays a major role in iron detoxification as an iron-storage sink, we wondered how cells respond to increased iron uptake when ferritin levels are reduced. To address this question, B6 fibroblasts were labeled with 5 μm59Fe-Tf (as in Fig. 4 A) for 15 and 30 min and 1 and 2 h. Cytoplasmic extracts were analyzed by qua"

The biological actions of GLP-2 in the central nervous system (CNS) remain poorly understood. We studied the sites of endogenous GLP-2 receptor (GLP-2R) expression, the localization of transgenic LacZ expression under the control of the mouse GLP-2R promoter, and the actions of GLP-2 in the murine CNS. GLP-2R expression was detected in multiple extrahypothalamic regions of the mouse and rat CNS, including cell groups in the cerebellum, medulla, amygdala, hippocampus, dentate gyrus, pons, cerebral cortex, and pituitary. A 1.5-kilobase fragment of the mouse GLP-2R promoter directed LacZ expression to the gastrointestinal tract and CNS regions in the mouse that exhibited endogenous GLP-2R expression, including the cerebellum, amygdala, hippocampus, and dentate gyrus. Intracerebroventricular injection of GLP-2 significantly inhibited food intake during dark-phase feeding in wild-type mice. Disruption of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) signaling with the antagonist exendin-(9–39) in wild-type mice or genetically in GLP-1R−/− mice significantly potentiated the anorectic actions of GLP-2.

Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1936-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), suggesting that gut-derived GLP-1 provides signals that influence feeding behavior either directly to the brain or indirectly, likely via vagal afferents. In contrast to the increasing number of studies describing CNS actions of GLP-1, much less is known about the potential function(s) of GLP-2 in the brain. Experiments using rat hypothalamic and pituitary membranes demonstrated GLP-2-mediated activation of adenylate cyclase (32Hoosein N.M. Gurd R.S. FEBS Lett. 1984; 178: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, the actions of GLP-2 were subsequently shown to be transduced in a cAMP-dependent manner via a recently cloned GLP-2 receptor (GLP-2R) isolated from hypothalamic and intestinal cDNA libraries (33Munroe D.G. Gupta A.K. Kooshesh P. Rizkalla G. Wang H. Demchyshyn L. Yang Z.-J. Kamboj R.K. Chen H. McCallum K. Sumner-Smith M. Drucker D.J. Crivici A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In comparison with GLP-1, little is known about either the expression or function of the GLP-2R in different regions of the CNS. Both GLP-1- and GLP-2-immunoreactive fiber tracts project from the brainstem to multiple CNS regions, including the hypothalamus, thalamus, cortex, and pituitary (21Larsen P.J. Tang-Christensen M. Holst J.J. Orskov C. Neuroscience. 1997; 77: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 35Tang-Christensen M. Larsen P.J. Thulesen J. Romer J. Vrang N. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 802-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Intracerebroventricular infusion of GLP-2 in rats inhibits food intake (35Tang-Christensen M. Larsen P.J. Thulesen J. Romer J. Vrang N. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 802-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), similar to results obtained following intracerebroventricular infusion of GLP-1 (24Turton M.D. O'Shea D. Gunn I. Beak S.A. Edwards C.M.B. Meeran K. Choi S.J. Taylor G.M. Heath M.M. Lambert P.D. Wilding J.P.H. Smith D.M. Ghatei M.A. Herbert J. Bloom S.R.

Physiol. 1996; 271: R848-R856PubMed Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, the anorectic effects of GLP-2 in rats are completely inhibited by the GLP-1R antagonist exendin-(9–39) (35Tang-Christensen M. Larsen P.J. Thulesen J. Romer J. Vrang N. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 802-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). These findings imply that CNS GLP-2 may exert its effects via the GLP-1R to inhibit food intake, or alternatively, exendin-(9–39) may also function as a CNS GLP-2R antagonist. Furthermore, although expression of the rat GLP-2R was reported to be restricted to the dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus by in situhybridization (35Tang-Christensen M. Larsen P.J. Thulesen J. Romer J. Vrang N. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 802-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), other studies have reported a more widespread distribution of GLP-2R mRNA transcripts in various regions of the rat CNS (37White, R. B., Broqua, P., Meyer, J., Junien, J.-L., and Aubert, M. L.

To understand the biological function and mechanisms regulating control of GLP-2R expression in the brain, we have now studied GLP-2R expression and GLP-2 action in the rodent CNS using a combination of immunohistochemical, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), transgenic, and cell-based analyses. All animal experiments were approved and carried out strictly in accordance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines and the Animal Care Committee at the Toronto General Hospital, University Health Network (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Animals were allowed to acclimatize to the animal care facilities for at least 1 week prior to any experimental procedure. A genomic clone containing the 5′-flanking, 5′-untranslated, and coding regions of the murine GLP-2R gene was isolated from a 129SVJ mouse genomic library. To identify additional GLP-2R nucleotide sequences 5′ to the translation start site (33Munroe D.G. Gupta A.K. Kooshesh P. Rizkalla G. Wang H. Demchyshyn L. Yang Z.-J. Kamboj R.K. Chen H. McCallum K. Sumner-Smith M. Drucker D.J. Crivici A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1569-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), the 5′-end of the rat GLP-2R cDNA was generated and characterized using adaptor-modified complementary DNA from rat brain (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) in 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) experiments. Separately, a 1516-base pair (bp) fragment of the mouse GLP-2R gene was subcloned from the mouse genomic library (Incyte Genomics, St. Louis, MO), sequenced, and ligated immediately 5′ to a cDNA encoding LacZ with a nuclear localization signal (a gift from A. Nagy). The GLP-2R promoter-lacZ transgene was gel-purified and used for generation of transgenic mice. In total, eight founder animals were identified by Southern blotting and PCR analysis and mated with non-transgenic mice to determine germ-line transmission of the transgene. Three transgenic founder mice (designated lines 2–4) exhibited germ-line transmission and were used to generate lines for further analysis of transgene expression. Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (300–500 g) or GLP-2R promoter-lacZ transgenic mice were killed by CO2 inhalation and quickly decapitated. The brains were rapidly removed and placed ventral side up on a chilled glass plate. The pituitary glands were also removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The amygdala, cerebral cortex, cerebellum, pons/midbrain, and medulla were dissected and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The amygdala was dissected by first producing a 3-mm thick coronal section by making a coronal cut at the optic chiasm and at the posterior edge of the mamillary bodies. A cut connecting the rhinal fissures formed the dorsal boundary of the amygdaloid block, and cuts made continuous with the lateral ventricles to the lateral hypothalamic sulci formed the medial boundaries of the amygdaloid blocks. The cerebral cortex was also taken from this coronal section and consisted primarily of parietal and frontal cortices. The cerebellum was removed, and a coronal cut was made at the posterior edge of the pons. The neural tissue posterior to this cut comprised the medulla, which also contained the anterior-most portion of the spinal cord. The midbrain block, which also included the pons, extended from the posterior edge of the mamillary bodies to the posterior edge of the pons, with the cerebellar and cerebral cortices, hippocampus, and amygdala removed. Total RNA was isolated from CNS tissues using TrizolTM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc., Toronto) and from peripheral tissues using a modified guanidinium thiocyanate procedure (38Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63184) Google Scholar) and dissolved in ribonuclease-free water. RNA integrity was assessed on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel containing formaldehyde and visualized on a UV transilluminator (Fisher, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) using ethidium bromide staining. For RT-PCR experiments, RNA samples were treated with DNase I (Life Technologies, Inc.), primed with random hexamers (Life Technologies, Inc.), and reverse-transcribed with SuperscriptTM II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). To control for contamination, reactions were also carried out in the absence of SuperscriptTM. Following first-strand cDNA synthesis, samples were treated with ribonuclease H (MBI Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania) to remove RNA. For subsequent PCR amplification, first-strand cDNA was used as template. Oligonucleotide primer pairs, annealing temperature, and cycle number for PCR amplification were as follows. For the rat GLP-2R, 5′-TTGTGAACGGGCGCCAGGAGA-3′ and 5′-GATCTCACTCTCTTCCAGAATCTC-3′ were annealed at 65 °C for 40 cycles; for the mouse GLP-2R, 5′-CTGCTGGTTTCCATCAAGCAA-3′ and 5′-TAGATCTCACTCTCTTCCAGA-3′ were annealed at 65 °C for 30 cycles; for rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTAG-3′ and 5′-GACCACAGTCCATGACATCACT-3′ were annealed at 60 °C for 30 cycles; and for the GLP-2R-lacZ transgene, 5′-CGCTGATTTGTGTAGTCGGTT-3′ and 5′-CTTATTCGCCTTGCAGCACAT-3′ were annealed at 63 °C for 40 cycles. The expected PCR product for the mouse and rat GLP-2R cDNAs is ∼1.6 kilobases (kb), corresponding to the full-length GLP-2R (33Munroe D.G. Gupta A.K. Kooshesh P. Rizkalla G. Wang H. Demchyshyn L.

Following transcardial perfusion with 0.9% sodium chloride, animals were perfused with 4% neutral buffered Formalin for ∼15 min. Brains were removed and post-fixed at room temperature for 4 h or overnight at 4 °C. Brains were then cryopreserved overnight in a 20% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) gradient at 4 °C, frozen slowly in dry ice vapor, and either stored at −80 °C or sectioned immediately at 10 μm on a cryostat. All sections were collected and thaw-mounted onto Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher). For detection of β-galactosidase-immunopositive cells, slides were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in a 1:8000 dilution of polyclonal anti-β-galactosidase antiserum (ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc., Costa Mesa, CA). Polyclonal anti-GLP-2R antiserum (1:800) that recognizes the GLP-2R, but not the glucagon, glucose-dependent inhibitory polypeptide, and GLP-1 receptors (34Yusta B. Huang L. Munroe D. Wolff G.

(Mississauga, Canada). To control for nonspecific immunopositivity, anti-GLP-2R antiserum was also preabsorbed overnight at 4 °C in the presence of recombinant GLP-2R immunogen (34Yusta B. Huang L.

Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 744-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), and immunocytochemistry studies were carried out with 1) anti-GLP-2R antiserum, 2) preimmune serum, 3) antibody diluent alone, or 4) preabsorbed anti-GLP-2R antiserum. All slides were counterstained in hematoxylin. Brains were isolated from mice and placed in 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS fixative for 1 h at room temperature. Sixty minutes later, brains were rinsed in PBS and transferred to 4 °C in 15% sucrose in PBS solution for 4 h to overnight and subsequently to 30% sucrose in PBS solution for 4 h to overnight for cryopreservation. Brains were then frozen in dry ice vapor and stored at −80 °C. Tissues were sectioned at 10 μm in a −25–30 °C cryostat and subsequently thaw-mounted and stored at −80 °C. Prior to staining with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal; Bioshop Canada, Burlington, Ontario), slides were slowly warmed to room temperature and rinsed in PBS. Slides were treated with X-gal solution overnight at 37 °C. Following treatment with X-gal solution, slides were rinsed in PBS, counterstained with eosin, and dehydrated in an ethanol series. All slides were visualized and captured using a JVC video camera with a ½-inch chip device adapted (0.63 × c-mount) to a light microscope (Leica Ltd., Cambridge, United Kingdom). Magnification is reported as the objective magnification multiplied by the c-mount magnification multiplied by the electronic magnification (electronic magnification was corrected for by dividing the diagonal of the image captured by the camera chip size). Recombinant h[Gly2]GLP-2, a dipeptidyl peptidase IV-resistant GLP-2 analog (40Drucker D.J. Shi Q. Crivici A. Sumner-Smith M. Tavares W. Hill M. Deforest L. Cooper S. Brubaker P.L. Nat.

Human GLP-1-(7–36)-NH2, exendin-4, and exendin-(9–39) were purchased from California Peptide Research Inc. (Napa, CA). Forskolin and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine were obtained from Sigma. BHK fibroblast cells stably transfected with either the rat GLP-1R or GLP-2R were propagated as previously described (42Yusta B. Somwar R. Wang F. Munroe D. Grinstein S. Klip A. Drucker D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30459-30467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and the levels of intracellular cAMP were assayed following exposure to individual peptides in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine as reported (41DaCambra M.P.

Cells were incubated for 5 min with exendin-(9–39) or medium alone before addition of an agonist (GLP-1, h[Gly2]GLP-2, or exendin-4). The treated cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Absolute ethanol (−20 °C) was added to terminate the reaction, and the plates were stored at −80 °C until the cell extracts were collected (2–4 h later). Forskolin was used as a positive control. cAMP radioimmunoassays (Biomedical Technologies, Inc., Stoughton, MA) were performed on dried aliquots of extract, and data were normalized to cAMP/well. All treatments were performed in triplicate or quadruplicate, and the data are expressed as means ± SD. EC50 values were calculated using Prism Version 3.00 (GraphPAD Software Inc., San Diego, CA). For intracerebroventricular injections, adult male CD1 mice randomized into multiple experimental groups were anesthetized by inhalation of methoxyflurane (Metophane, Janssen, Toronto) (43Scrocchi L.A. Brown T.J. MacLusky N. Brubaker P.L. Auerbach A.B. Joyner A.L. Drucker D.J. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1254-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Following intracerebroventricular injections of equal volumes of saline or peptide dissolved in saline, animals were allowed to recover for ∼15 min until the observation of a righting response. Mice were then weighed and given a pre-measured quantity of rodent chow, and food intake was quantified at 1, 2, 4, and 22 h. The accuracy of intracerebroventricular injection was verified at autopsy analysis by detection of bromphenol dye in the lateral ventricles of selected animals. Animals were injected with peptide either at 7 p.m. (for dark-phase feeding studies) or at 10 a.m. following an overnight fast of 15 h (for fasting studies). The observation that GLP-2R RNA transcripts were restricted to the dorsomedial nucleus of the rat hypothalamus as demonstrated by in situ hybridization (35Tang-Christensen M. Larsen P.J. Thulesen J. Romer J. Vrang N. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 802-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) differed from recent reports of more widespread expression of the GLP-2R in multiple regions of the CNS (37White, R. B., Broqua, P., Meyer, J., Junien, J.-L., and Aubert, M. L. (2000) 82nd Annual Meeting of the Endocrine Society, June 21–24, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, p. 271, Abstr. 1115, The Endocrine Society Press, Bethesda, MDGoogle Scholar). We detected GLP-2R mRNA transcripts not only in the rat hypothalamus, but also in the brainstem by RT-PCR (34Yusta B. Huang L. Munroe D. Wolff G. Fantaske R. Sharma S. Demchyshyn L. Asa S.L. Drucker D.J. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 744-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we reexamined the localization of rodent CNS GLP-2R expression using a combination of RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry analyses. Furthermore, we compared the localization of endogenous GLP-2R mRNA transcripts and GLP-2R immunopositivity with the regions of LacZ expression in tissues isolated from GLP-2R promoter-lacZ transgenic mice. To identify DNA regulatory sequences important for control of CNS GLP-2R expression, we focused initially on characterization of the 5′-end of the GLP-2R mRNA transcript. As GLP-2R cDNA sequences upstream of the translation start site had not been previously reported (33Munroe D.G. Gupta A.K. Kooshesh P. Rizkalla G. Wang H. Demchyshyn L. Yang Z.-J. Kamboj R.K. Chen H.

Multiple RACE reaction products were consistently obtained that were ∼500 bp in size. These products were cloned, and sequence analysis demonstrated the presence of previously identified rat GLP-2R cDNA sequences (33Munroe D.G. Gupta A.K. Kooshesh P. Rizkalla G. Wang H. Demchyshyn L. Yang Z.-J. Kamboj R.K. Chen H. McCallum K. Sumner-Smith M. Drucker D.J. Crivici A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Using a 213-bp ApaI/SmaI rat cDNA fragment containing 5′-coding sequences as a probe, we isolated an ∼2-kb subclone from a bacterial artificial chromosome clone derived from a mouse genomic library. The DNA sequences of the mouse GLP-2R genomic subclone were aligned with the known rat GLP-2R cDNA sequence (33Munroe D.G. Gupta A.K. Kooshesh P. Rizkalla G. Wang H. Demchyshyn L. Yang Z.-J.

Whether this process also involves specific classes of proteins that influence growth processes is unknown. We investigated chaperone-mediated autophagy, a lysosomal import pathway that depends on the 73-kDa heat shock cognate protein and allows the degradation of proteins containing a specific lysosomal import consensus sequence (KFERQ motif). Epidermal growth factor (EGF) or ammonia, but not transforming growth factor β1, suppresses total protein breakdown in cultured NRK-52E renal epithelial cells. EGF or ammonia prolonged the half-life of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a classic substrate for chaperone-mediated autophagy, by more than 90%, whereas transforming growth factor β1 did not. EGF caused a similar increase in the half-life of the KFERQ-containing paired box-related transcription factor, Pax2. The increase in half-life was accompanied by an increased accumulation of proteins with a KFERQ motif including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and Pax2. Ammonia also increased the level of the Pax2 protein. Lysosomal import of KFERQ proteins depends on the abundance of the 96-kDa lysosomal glycoprotein protein (lgp96), and we found that EGF caused a significant decrease in lgp96 in cellular homogenates and associated with lysosomes. We conclude that EGF in cultured renal cells regulates the breakdown of proteins targeted for destruction by chaperone-mediated autophagy. Because suppression of this pathway results in an increase in Pax2, these results suggest a novel mechanism for the regulation of cell growth.

Nature. 1995; 371: 747-748Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition to controlling synthesis, growth factors can suppress the bulk degradation of proteins (2Ballard F.J. Knowles S.E. Wong S.S.C. Bodner J.B. Wood C.M. Gunn J.M. FEBS Lett. 1980; 114: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For example, in renal tubular epithelial cells we found that EGF1 suppresses the breakdown of the mass of intracellular proteins (3Franch H.A. Curtis P.V. Mitch W.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C843-C851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The suppression of proteolysis in response to growth factors involved decreased lysosomal degradation rather than decreased proteasomal or calcium-sensitive proteases (3Franch H.A. Curtis P.V. Mitch W.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C843-C851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite reports that proteolysis is regulated, no one has determined if specific classes of proteins are being regulated by growth factors. Lysosomes degrade extracellular proteins (via endocytosis), membrane proteins, and organelles (via autophagy) and can degrade cytosolic proteins via direct import through the lysosomal membrane (4Lee H.K. Marzella L. Int. Rev. Exp. Pathol. 1994; 35: 39-147PubMed Google Scholar,5Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Dice and Terlecky (6Dice J.F. Terlecky S.R. Ciechanover A.J. Schwartz A.L. Cellular Proteolytic Systems. Wiley-Liss, New York1994: 134-159Google Scholar) showed that there is a specific import pathway involving the 73-kDa heat shock cognate protein (hsc73) called chaperone-mediated autophagy. Hsc73 binds to a penta-peptide motif (consensus sequence, KFERQ) on the target protein and, acting as a chaperone, unfolds the target protein (7Terlecky S.R. Dice J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23490-23495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hsc73 bound to the substrate protein then interacts with an intrinsic lysosomal membrane protein, the 96-kDa lysosomal glycoprotein (lgp96, also called lysosomal membrane protein 2a) (8Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. Science. 1996; 273: 501-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). After recruiting other accessory proteins, the target protein is transported through the lysosomal membrane and degraded (9Agarraberes F.A. Terlecky S.R. Dice J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Dice and co-workers (10Wing S.S. Chiang H.L. Goldberg A.L. Dice J.F. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) also showed that chaperone-mediated autophagy can be regulated by calorie deprivation, which accelerates the proteolysis of proteins with KFERQ motifs in the lysosomes from liver. In kidney and liver, up to 30% of proteins contains the KFERQ motif, including many of the proteins involved in glycolysis. Because most glycolytic proteins have long half-lives, an increase in degradation could function to down-regulate their abundance. Because we found that growth factors suppress lysosomal proteolysis in renal cells, we wanted to determine whether growth factors regulate the half-life of proteins that are substrates for chaperone-mediated autophagy. In pursuing this question, we uncovered a novel mechanism that leads to the accumulation of specific proteins involved in the regulation of cellular growth.

Physiol. 1978; 94: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), passage 15) were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA), subcultured, and grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, 25 mm glutamine, and 5% calf serum. Studies were performed on cells from passages 19–29. Cells in 6-well plates were grown to confluence and rendered quiescent by serum removal 48 h prior to experimental treatment. The cell culture medium was refreshed every 24 h to maintain a constant pH; it did not differ between control and treatment groups. Recombinant human TGF-β1 was reconstituted in 4 mm HCl containing 0.1% heat-treated bovine serum albumin. Recombinant human EGF was reconstituted in PBS containing 0.1% heat-treated bovine serum albumin. In all studies, concentrations of 10−10m (TGF-β1), 10−8m (EGF), and 10 mm (NH4Cl) were used (12Franch H.A. Shay J.W. Alpern R.J. Preisig P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar); the appropriate vehicle was added to control cells. After exposure to an experimental variable, cells were washed with PBS, incubated with 0.05% trypsin/0.5 mm EDTA for 5 min, centrifuged at 1500 × g for 5 min, and washed with PBS. The final pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of 50 mmNa2PO4 (pH 7.4) and lysed on ice by repeated passage though a 27-gauge needle. The lysate was divided and stored at −70 °C for protein and DNA determination as described (12Franch H.A. Shay J.W. Alpern R.J. Preisig P.A. J.

Kidney Int. 1992; 42: 595-601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 mm unlabeled phenylalanine was added to the medium to minimize reuse of the phenylalanine released by protein breakdown, and an initial 4-h washout period was used to eliminate short lived proteins and unincorporatedl-[14C]phenylalanine. Aliquots of the medium were removed at intervals and treated with trichloroacetic acid to remove protein, and the radioactivity was determined. At the end of the experiment, cell protein was solubilized in 1 ml/well of 1% SDS, and the remaining radioactivity was measured. The protein degradation rate was calculated as the slope of the logarithm of the [14C]phenylalanine remaining in cell proteinversus time. Confluent cells in 100-mm dishes were incubated with 100 μCi ofl-[35S]cystine/methionine (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA). For GAPDH, the labeling was performed in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with cold cystine/methionine present for 72 h. For Pax2, cells were treated with EGF in cystine/methionine-free medium for 20 h to increase the labeling of Pax2 because its abundance is very low in quiescent cells. After two washes in serum-free medium, a 4-h washout in serum- and growth factor-free cystine/methionine-containing medium was performed prior to the addition of growth factors. Subsequently, cells were washed twice with serum-free medium before adding the experimental variable in the medium containing an excess of cold cystine and methionine. The culture medium was always changed daily with an additional wash. At time 0 and at various times up to 72 h for GAPDH and up to 24 h for Pax2, cells were lysed in a 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mmsodium EDTA, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin. One μg/ml anti-GAPDH or Pax2 anti-serum was added to equal amounts of cellular protein that was precipitated with protein G-Sepharose beads. After three washes with lysis buffer, the immunoprecipitate was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, underwent autoradiography, and was quantitated by use of the Signmagel program. The protein half-life was calculated from the slope of the logarithmic transformation of the densitometry data plotted against time. We documented the completeness of recovery by performing Western blots on the supernatants after immunoprecipitation (data not shown). Cells in 60-mm tissue culture dishes were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and lysed in a buffer containing 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mmsodium EDTA, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin. After centrifugation, the proteins in the supernatant were determined and boiled in buffer containing 1% SDS and 0.5% β-mercaptoethanol, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and 5% fat-free milk protein or 3% bovine serum albumin was used as a blocking reagent. Antibodies were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and Kodak BCL film. Lysosomes were isolated as described by Cuervo et al. (14Cuervo A.M. Hildebrand H. Bomhard E.M. Dice J.F. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 529-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells in two 25-cm2plates/group were washed in ice-cold PBS and then homogenized after scraping in ice-cold buffer (2.5 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 0.25m sucrose) by 20 strokes of a Teflon Polytron homogenizer at 4 °C. Then 1 g of protein/7 ml of 0.25 m sucrose was centrifuged at 2500 × g for 10 min and the post-nuclear supernatant was placed on a discontinuous gradient of 35 and 17% metrizamide (pH 7.0) and 6% Percoll and centrifuged at 6800 × g for 25 min. The lysosome/mitochondrial fraction at the metrizamide/Percoll interface was resuspended to a final concentration of 57% metrizamide. On top of this fraction, there was a discontinuous metrizamide gradient of equal volumes of 35, 17, and 5%, metrizamide with a final 0.25% sucrose layer. This gradient was centrifuged for 1 h at 95,000 × g. The lysosomes sediment to the interface of 5–17% metrizamide and mitochondria at the 35–57% interface. Purity of the lysosomal or mitochondrial fractions was determined by the activity of β-N-hexosaminidase (lysosome) and mitochondrial succinic dehydrogenase and by the presence of lgp96 (15Aniento F. Roche E. Cuervo A.M. Knecht E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10463-10470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Because there was experiment-to-experiment variation in the magnitude of responses, results are presented as a percentage of the control value determined simultaneously. The differences between two groups were analyzed by the Student's t test, but multiple comparisons were analyzed by analysis of variance. Comparisons of slopes of lines representing the release ofl-[U-14C]phenylalanine were done by analysis of co-variance. We treated NRK-52E cells with growth factors and found different growth properties (Fig. 1): EGF causes hyperplasia (increased DNA content) and increases (∼30%) the half-life of long lived proteins. TGF-β1 increases in the protein/DNA ratio (hypertrophy) but does not significantly suppress proteolysis. The combination of EGF plus TGF-β1 causes hypertrophy with the suppression of proteolysis, whereas ammonia causes less hypertrophy even though there is an even greater suppression of proteolysis. We have shown previously that EGF, TGF-β1, and EGF plus TGF-β1 increase protein synthesis, whereas ammonia does not affect synthesis (12Franch H.A. Shay J.W. Alpern R.J. Preisig P.A. J.

GAPDH has a KFERQ consensus sequence (17Dice J.F. Chiang H.L. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1989; 55: 45-55PubMed Google Scholar) and is a classic substrate for chaperone-mediated autophagy (15Aniento F.

As shown in Fig. 2 and Table I, the half-life of GAPDH measured in a pulse-chase experiment increased by ∼ 90% in cells treated with either EGF or ammonia but did not significantly change in cells treated with TGF-β1 alone.Table IGrowth factors change GAPDH protein half-lifeHalf-lifePercentage of Control Half-lifeh%Control38.1 ± 5.3100EGF (10−8 M)74.9 ± 3.1 1-ap < 0.05versus control, n = 4–7.196TGF (10−10 M)48.6 ± 3.8128Ammonia 10 mM73.7 ± 10.81-ap < 0.05versus control, n = 4–7.193NRK-52E cells were radiolabeled when quiescent growth factors were added during a cold-chase period, and then GAPDH was immunoprecipitated at different times.

Protein half-life was calculated from the slope of the logarithmic transformation of the densitometry of autoradiograms plotted against time. We also tested whether these agents change the abundance of specific proteins with the KFERQ lysosomal import sequence. GAPDH abundance increased with treatments that suppress proteolysis, but TGF-β1, which does not affect proteolysis, did not increase GAPDH. We also examined the M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase because it is a glycolytic enzyme with KFERQ consensus sequences (19Noguchi T. Inoue H. Tanaka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13807-13812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it binds hsc73, and it is imported into lysosomes (6Dice J.F. Terlecky S.R. Ciechanover A.J. Schwartz A.L. Cellular Proteolytic Systems. Wiley-Liss, New York1994: 134-159Google Scholar). In contrast, hexokinase is a glycolytic enzyme that lacks a KFERQ sequence (15Aniento F. Roche E. Cuervo A.M. Knecht E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10463-10470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conditions that stimulate cell growth also increase the abundance of the M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase as well as other proteins recognized by anti-KFERQ affinity-purified sera (Fig. 3). Hexokinase abundance did not increase with any of the growth factors. Although the pattern of changes was similar between proteins recognized by anti-KFERQ serum and the M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase, the magnitude of increase in the M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase was much greater, suggesting that its synthesis is also stimulated (Fig. 3, B andC). Glycolytic enzymes are not the only proteins containing KFERQ sequences, which may be important intermediates influencing renal cell growth. For example, the renal paired box-related transcription factor, Pax2, contains a conserved KFERQ sequence at amino acids 38–42 (20Eccles M.R. Wallis J.L. Fidler A.E. Spurr N.K. Goodfellow P.J. Reeve A.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 279-289PubMed Google Scholar). We found that the half-life of Pax2 (Fig.4) also increased with EGF treatment and that the abundance of Pax2 was increased by growth factors; the smallest rise occurred with TGF-β1. Interestingly, the Pax2 abundance also increased when lysosomal proteolysis was inhibited with NH4Cl (Fig. 3 D). Thus different stimuli causing growth also increase Pax2 abundance. To determine the mechanisms that control suppression of proteolysis, we examined if the regulatory proteins of chaperone-mediated autophagy change in response to growth factors. Hsc73 did not change in abundance (Fig. 3 A). We also examined the lysosomal membrane receptor for protein translocation, lgp96, in lysates and in association with isolated lysosomes using sera directed against the 12-amino acid cytoplasmic portion of lgp96 that binds to hsc73 (8Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. Science. 1996; 273: 501-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). The quality of lysosomes isolated did not vary between the control and EGF-treated cells as assayed by hexosaminidase activity (TableII). Isolated lysosomes exhibited immunostaining for lgp96 (Fig.5 A); the level was 7-fold higher than in whole cell lysates (Fig. 5 B). Lgp96 was not detected in the mitochondrial fractions. In whole cell lysates, lgp96 abundance decreased by 30–40% after 24 or 96 h of treatment with stimuli that suppress proteolysis (Fig. 5, C andE). In contrast, TGF-β1, which did not affect proteolysis, did not affect lgp96 levels. Because the lysosomal-associated lgp96 correlates more closely with the activity of chaperone-mediated autophagy than total cellular lgp96 (21Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4441-4450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined lysosomal-associated lgp96 with EGF treatment and found a 48 ± 10% decrease (p < 0.05, n = 3) compared with lysosomes isolated from control cells (Fig. 5,D and E).Table IIHexosaminidase activity in isolated lysosomesHexosaminidase activityProteinSpecific activity%%Control (n = 3)Homogenate1001001Post-nuclear supernatant28.0 ± 8.614.4 ± 1.11.95 ± 0.61Mitochondria0.40 ± 0.150.49 ± 0.260.92 ± 0.19Lysosomes2.55 ± 0.380.80 ± 0.013.19 ± 0.48 2-ap < 0.05versus homogenate.EGF (n = 3)Homogenate1001001Post-nuclear supernatant16.4 ± 4.012.3 ± 0.71.36 ± 0.41Mitochondria0.87 ± 0.420.54 ± 0.161.52 ± 0.34Lysosomes1.60 ± 0.250.58 ± 0.182.93 ± 0.502-ap < 0.05versus homogenate.NRK-52E cells were grown as in Fig. 1, and lysosomes and mitochondria were isolated by metrizamide density gradient centrifugation.

Open table in a new tab NRK-52E cells were grown as in Fig. 1, and lysosomes and mitochondria were isolated by metrizamide density gradient centrifugation. There are no significant differences between the control and EGF. In the early 1980s, it was recognized that specific growth factors and activated oncogenes could suppress protein degradation in certain cell types including epithelial cells (22Ballard F.J. Wong S.S.C. Knowles S.E. Partridge N.C. Martin T.J. Wood C.M. Gunn J.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1980; 105: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It was not known, however, which classes of proteins develop longer half-lives during growth or how this response was regulated. We found that EGF suppresses the breakdown of the bulk of proteins in NRK-52E cells by a mechanism that involved the suppression of lysosomal function but not proteolysis by proteasomal or calcium-activated proteases (3Franch H.A. Curtis P.V. Mitch W.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C843-C851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Physiologic conditions can regulate specific pathways of lysosomal proteolysis. For example, calorie deprivation increases the degradation of proteins with a KFERQ motif in liver and kidney lysosomes (10Wing S.S. Chiang H.L. Goldberg A.L. Dice J.F. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). How does this finding bear on growth factor-induced renal cell growth? Conditions stimulating renal cell growth increase glycolysis, and many glycolytic enzymes contain KFERQ motifs (17Dice J.F. Chiang H.L. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1989; 55: 45-55PubMed Google Scholar, 23Tang M.J. Suresh K.E. Tannen R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C532-C539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Fukuhara Y. Yamamoto S. Yano F. Orita Y.

Eigenbrodt E. Oehmke M. Mazurek S. Fischer G. Virchows Arch. 1994; 424: 177-185PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, by acting in the opposite fashion as calorie deprivation, growth factors could suppress the degradation of glycolytic enzymes and contribute to the increase in glycolysis that accompanies renal growth. Our results confirm that EGF acts to prolong the half-life of the classic substrate for chaperone-mediated autophagy, GAPDH, and increase the abundance of KFERQ-containing proteins. Our results provide additional insights into the relationship among growth factors, cell growth, and lysosomal protein degradation. First, only specific growth factors influence lysosomal function. For example, EGF clearly stimulates cell growth and suppresses total proteolysis and the proteolysis of substrates of chaperone-mediated autophagy. In contrast, TGF-β1 caused the smallest increase in growth and has almost no effect on proteolysis. We do not conclude that suppression of proteolysis is the sole mechanism causing KFERQ-containing protein accumulation, because the accumulation of KFERQ proteins that occurred with TGF-β treatment almost certainly reflects increased synthesis (Figs. 3, B and C). Second, our results show that regulation of this lysosomal pathway by growth factors leads to prolongation of the half-life of Pax2, which has been implicated in renal cell growth in development, cyst formation, and renal cell carcinoma (20Eccles M.R. Wallis J.L. Fidler A.E. Spurr N.K. Goodfellow P.J. Reeve A.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 279-289PubMed Google Scholar, 26Winyard P.J. Risdon R.A. Sams V.R. Dressler G.R. Woolf A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 451-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Because there is also an increase in the abundance of Pax2 in cells treated with EGF and because EGF causes only trivial increases in Pax2 mRNA in renal tubular cells (27Liu S. Cieslinski D.A. Funke A.J. Humes H.D. Exp. Nephrol. 1997; 5: 295-300PubMed Google Scholar), the increase in half-life we found could be physiologically relevant. Because Pax2 acts as a transcription factor, these responses suggest a new mechanism by which growth factors regulate cell growth; not only do they suppress the degradation of the bulk of cytoplasmic proteins (3Franch H.A. Curtis P.V. Mitch W.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C843-C851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but they increase the availability of at least one critical transcription factor. Finally, our results provide unexpected information about a potential mechanism by which ammonia could increase cell growth. The growth of renal cells characteristically found in response to metabolic acidosis is attributed to ammonia, which can reach concentrations as high as 5 mm in the cortex of the kidney (28Halperin M.L. Kamel K.S. Ethier J.H. Stinebaugh B.J. Jungas R.L. Seldin D.W. Giebisch G. The Kidney: Physiology and Pathophysiology. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1992: 2645-2680Google Scholar). Ammonia had been thought to act only by changing lysosomal pH and nonspecifically suppressing lysosomal proteolysis leading to the accumulation of cytosolic proteins (16Franch H.A. Preisig P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C932-C938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Golchini K. Norman J. Bohman R. Kurtz I. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1767-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, our results suggest that ammonia also acts by suppressing the degradation of specific signaling proteins such as Pax2. The up-regulation of transcription factors could allow the expression of particular proteins important for growth without an increase in global protein synthesis. Regarding the mechanism involved in changing lysosomal degradation, we and others find that the abundance of hsc73 does not change even when activity of this pathway changes (9Agarraberes F.A. Terlecky S.R. Dice J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 14Cuervo A.M. Hildebrand H. Bomhard E.M. Dice J.F. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 529-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Curiously, hsc73 contains KFERQ sequences but is resistant to degradation within hepatic lysosomes responding to starvation (9Agarraberes F.A. Terlecky S.R. Dice J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we did observe a decrease in the abundance of lgp96 including a sharp decrease in the amount of lgp96 specifically associated with lysosomes (Fig. 5). This finding is consistent with the close correlation between the lgp96 associated with lysosomes and the activity of chaperone-mediated autophagy (14Cuervo A.M. Hildebrand H. Bomhard E.M. Dice J.F. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 529-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 21Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4441-4450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Cuervo A.M. Hu W. Lim B. Dice J.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1995-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Although there are similarities between the effects of EGF and ammonia on the proteolysis of KFERQ-containing proteins and lgp96 levels, there are differences in their actions on lysosomes. We found that pharmacologic agents that specifically inhibit lysosomal proteolysis (ammonia, methylamine, bafilomycin A1, or leupeptin plus the protease inhibitor, E64) convert the cellular proliferation in response to EGF into hypertrophy (31Franch H.A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 1631-1638PubMed Google Scholar). The change in lgp96 abundance may be a common pathway increasing growth-promoting proteins such as glycolytic enzymes and Pax2, and an additional influence of lysosomal inhibitors may account for the conversion of hyperplasia to hypertrophy. Besides the regulation of chaperone-mediated autophagy, EGF could affect the function of other pathways of lysosomal proteolysis. Autophagy may also be regulated by growth factors (32Blommaart E.F.C. Luiken J.J.F.P. Meijer A.J. Histochem. J. 1997; 29: 365-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), leading to slower degradation of organelles and membranes. EGF acts through phosphoinositide 3-kinase as it suppresses proteolysis in renal cells, 2H. A. Franch and J. Du, unpublished observation. and phosphoinositide 3-kinase has been reported to regulate autophagy in cultured liver cells (33Petiot A. Ogier-Denis E. Blommaart E.F.C. Meijer A.J. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 992-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). One practical prediction of these results is that a KFERQ sequence may be used to identify proteins that are up-regulated during renal cell growth. Besides glycolytic enzymes, there are a large number of proteins in the National Center for Biotechnology Information data base that contain conserved KFERQ sequences and are important for renal tubule cell growth. These proteins include enzymes involved in phospholipid metabolism (choline kinase (GenBankTMaccession number 139962) and phosphorylcholine transferase (34Kalamar G.B. Kay R.J. Lachance A. Aebersold R. Cornell R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6029-6033Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar)), ion transporters (β subunit of the sodium/potassium ATPase (35Mercer R.W. Schneider J.W. Savitz A. Emmanuel J. Benz E.J. Levenson R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3884-3890Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar)), and signaling molecules such as Pax2 (20Eccles M.R. Wallis J.L. Fidler A.E. Spurr N.K. Goodfellow P.J. Reeve A.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 279-289PubMed Google Scholar). The KFERQ sequence is present in the Pax isoforms expressed in the urinary tract (Pax2, -5, and -8) but not in other Pax isoforms, suggesting that the link between Pax proteins and this proteolytic pathway may be specific to the urinary tract (36Poleev A.

Finally, the signaling proteins MARKS and IκB have been shown to have their abundance regulated by this pathway (30Cuervo A.M. Hu W. Lim B. Dice J.F. Mol. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2108700166,"Regulation of antioxidant enzymes is critical to control the levels of reactive oxygen species in cell compartments highly susceptible to oxidative stress. In this work, we studied the regulation of a chloroplastic iron superoxide dismutase (Fe-SOD) from<i>Lingulodinium polyedrum</i> (formerly <i>Gonyaulax polyedra</i>) under different physiological conditions. A cDNA-encoding Fe-SOD was isolated from this dinoflagellate, showing high sequence similarity to cyanobacterial, algal, and plant Fe-SODs. Under standard growth conditions, on a 12:12-h light-dark cycle,<i>Lingulodinium polyedrum</i> Fe-SOD exhibited a daily rhythm of activity and cellular abundance with the maximum occurring during the middle of the light phase. Northern analyses showed that this rhythmicity is not related to changes in Fe-SOD mRNA levels, indicative of translational regulation. By contrast, conditions of metal-induced oxidative stress resulted in higher levels of Fe-SOD transcripts, suggesting that transcriptional control is responsible for increased protein and activity levels. Daily (circadian) and metal-induced up-regulation of Fe-SOD expression in <i>L. polyedrum</i> are thus mediated by different regulatory pathways, allowing biochemically distinct changes appropriate to oxidative challenges."

Life Sci. 1998; 54: 205-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). GATases catalyze two separate reactions at two active sites that are either located on a single polypeptide chain or on different subunits. In the glutaminase reaction, glutamine is hydrolyzed to glutamate and ammonia, which in the synthase reaction is added to an acceptor substrate that is specific for each GATase. There are two classes of GATases that can be discriminated by catalytically essential residues in their glutaminase domains (1Zalkin H. Smith J.L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol.

Class II GATases belong to the large family of Ntn hydrolases (9Brannigan J.A. Dodson G. Duggleby H.J. Moody P.C. Smith J.L. Tomchick D.R. Murzin A.G. Nature. 1995; 378: 416-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar), and their only catalytically essential amino acid is the conserved N-terminal cysteine. The corresponding synthase domains within each class are structurally, evolutionary, and functionally unrelated (2Massière F. Badet-Denisot M.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 205-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), supporting the hypothesis that glutamine-hydrolyzing enzymes were recruited independently by previously ammonium-dependent enzymes (3Zalkin H. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1993; 66: 203-309PubMed Google Scholar). Along these lines, most GATases can use ammonium salts as an alternative source of ammonia (1Zalkin H. Smith J.L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 87-144PubMed Google Scholar, 2Massière F. Badet-Denisot M.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 205-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The imidazole glycerol phosphate (ImGP) synthase is a class I GATase, which in bacteria constitutes a bienzyme complex consisting of the glutaminase subunit HisH and the synthase subunit HisF (10Alifano P. Fani R. Liò P. Lazcano A. Bazzicalupo M. Carlomagno M.S. Bruni C.B. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 44-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Klem T.J. Davisson V.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5177-5186Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The ammonia produced by HisH reacts with the substrate of HisF, which isN′-((5′-phosphoribulosyl) formimino)-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-ribonucleotide (PRFAR). The products of this reaction, ImGP and 5- aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribotide (AICAR), are further used in histidine and de novo purine biosynthesis, respectively. In yeast, the glutaminase and synthase activities are located on a single polypeptide chain, which is termed HIS7 (12Kuenzler M. Balmelli T. Egli C.M. Paravicini G. Braus G.H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5548-5558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Chittur S.V. Chen Y. Davisson V.J. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 18: 366-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The mechanism of glutamine hydrolysis by HisH can be deduced from the class I GATase carbamoyl phosphate synthase (5Thoden J.B. Miran S.G. Phillips J.C. Howard A.J. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8825-8831Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, due to the lack of a high resolution structure for the bienzyme complex, the ammonia transfer from HisH to HisF and the mechanism of the HisF reaction are only poorly understood. In order to address these questions, the thermostable variants tHisF and tHisH from Thermotoga maritima were produced in E. coli, purified and characterized by hydrodynamic and spectroscopic measurements, limited proteolysis, and steady-state enzyme kinetics. Moreover, the high resolution x-ray structure of isolated tHisF (14Lang D. Thoma R. Henn-Sax M. Sterner R. Wilmanns M. Science. 2000; 289: 1546-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) was used to identify and probe amino acid residues that are potentially involved in catalysis of the synthase reaction. It was shown that tHisH is activated by complex formation with tHisF containing ImGP or a substrate analogue bound to its active site. A flexible loop region in tHisF appears to be important for these functional interactions with tHisH. Furthermore, two aspartate residues at the active site of tHisF were demonstrated to be essential for catalysis. One of them was partially replaceable by glutamate, as shown by saturation random mutagenesis and complementation in vivo of an E. coli hisF deletion strain. Based on these findings, a chemically plausible mechanism for the HisF synthase reaction was derived, which involves general acid/base catalysis. Preparation of DNA, digestion with restriction endonucleases, and DNA ligation were performed as described (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were purchased from Metabion. DNA was amplified by PCR using cloned Pfupolymerase (Stratagene). For PCR with mutagenic oligonucleotides,Taq polymerase (Roche Diagnostics) was used. DNA was extracted from agarose gels using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). DNA sequencing was performed by the “Göttingen Genomics Laboratory” and by the “Zentrum für Molekulare Medizin der Universität Köln,” using standard methods. N-terminal protein sequencing was performed by Dr. Paul Jenö(Biozentrum, University of Basel) and the “Zentrum für Molekulare Medizin der Universität Köln,” again using standard methods. ThehisF gene variants from Thermotoga maritima(thisF; Ref. 16Thoma R. Schwander M. Liebl W. Kirschner K. Sterner R. Extremophiles. 1998; 2: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) encoding the synthase subunit of imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase were cloned into the expression vector pET11c (Novagen) using the restriction enzymes NdeI andBamHI. The hisH gene of T. maritima(thisH; Ref. 16Thoma R. Schwander M. Liebl W. Kirschner K. Sterner R. Extremophiles. 1998; 2: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR, using purified chromosomal DNA (Qbiogen) as a template. The oligonucleotides 5′-GGT GTG ATA GCA TGC GTA TCG-3′ with aSphI-site (in boldface type) and 5′-CTA CCA AGC TTC TGA AGA GAT CTA TCG-3′ with aHindIII-site (in boldface type) were used as 5′- and 3′-primers, respectively. Using the two newly introduced restriction sites, the amplified DNA fragment was cloned into the vector pDS56/RBSII/SphI (17Stüber D. Matile H. Garotta G. Lefkovits I. Pernis B. Immunological Methods. 4. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1990: 121-152Crossref Google Scholar) to yield the plasmid pDS56/RBSIISphI-thisH. All inserts were entirely sequenced to exclude inadvertent PCR mutations. Point mutations were introduced into thisF by PCR-based methods using either mutagenic 5′-primer for construction of thisF_C9A, D11N, K19S, or the megaprimer method (18Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar) for construction of thisF_D51N, N103A, D130N, D176N, and D183N. In both approaches, the plasmid pET11c-thisF (19Thoma R. Obmolova G. Lang D.A. Schwander M. Jeno P. Sterner R. Wilmanns M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) was used as the template. The following mutagenic 5′-primers were used (NdeI restriction sites are in boldface type, and base substitutions to introduce an amino acid exchange are underlined): 5′-TGA TGA AGACAT ATG CTC GCT AAA AGA ATA ATC GCG GCT CTC GAT-3′ for construction of C9A, 5′-TGA TGA AGA CAT ATG CTC GCT AAA AGA ATA ATC GCG TGC CTC AAT GTG AAA GAC-3′ for construction of D11N, and 5′-TGA TGA AGA CAT ATG CTC GCT AAA AGA ATA ATC GCG TGT CTC GAT GTG AAA GAC GGT CGT GTG GTG AGCGGA ACG AAC TTC-3′ for construction of K19S. In all PCRs, the oligonucleotide 5′-CCG GAT CCA GCG TCA TCA CAA-3′ containing a BamHI restriction site (in boldface type) was used as the 3′-primer. For the production of megaprimers, the following mutagenic oligonucleotides were used (base substitutions to introduce restriction sites for the control of the reaction are in boldface type, and base substitutions to introduce an amino acid exchange are underlined): 5′-CGC GGT A AT AT T CAG AAA AAC GAG-3′ with a new SspI restriction site for construction of D51N, 5′-CAC AGC CGC AGT GGC TAT GCT CAC CTT GTC-3′ with a new TspRI site for construction of N103A, 5′-CAC TCT TTT TGC ATTAAT CGC CAC GAC-3′ with a newVspI restriction site for construction of D130N, 5′-GAC AGAAAC GGC ACC AAA TCG G-3′ with a newBshNI restriction site for construction of D176N, and 5′-GGC ACA AAA TCG GGT TAC AACACT GAG ATG ATA AGG-3′ with a new TspRI restriction site for construction of D183N. For production of the megaprimers for thisF_D51N, N103A, and D130N, the corresponding mutagenic oligonucleotides listed above were used as 3′-primers, and the oligonucleotide 5′-TGA TGA AGACAT ATG CTC GCT AAA AG-3′ (NdeI restriction site in boldface type) was used as 5′-primer. The megaprimers were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and used in the second PCR as 5′-primers, whereas the oligonucleotide 5′-CCG GAT CCA GCG TCA TCA CAA-3′ (BamHI restriction site in boldface type) was used as 3′-primer. The construction of the variants thisF_D176N and D183N followed the same protocol except that in the first PCR the mutagenic oligonucleotides were used as 5′-primers and the oligonucleotide 5′-CCG GAT CCA GCG TCA TCA CAA-3′ (BamHI restriction site in boldface type) was used as 3′-primer. The purified megaprimers were used as 3′-primers, and the oligonucleotide 5′-TGA TGA AGA CAT ATG CTC GCT AAA AG-3′ (NdeI restriction site in boldface type) was used as 5′-primer. The resulting full-length products were digested withNdeI and BamHI and ligated into pET11c. In order to confirm the base substitutions and to exclude inadvertent additional ones, all thisF gene variants were entirely sequenced. The thisF codons representing amino acids 11 and 130 were randomized in PCR-based approaches using degenerated primers and pET11c-thisF as template. For randomization of position 11, the oligonucleotide 5′-TAT ACG CAT GCT CGC TAA AAG AAT AAT CGC GTG CCT CNNSGT GAA GAC-3′ with a SphI restriction site (in boldface type) was used, where N represents equal molar mixtures of all four bases, and S represents an equal molar mixture of G and C. In a PCR, the degenerate oligonucleotide was used as 5′-primer, and the oligonucleotide 5′-GTC GAC GGA TCC ACA ACC CCT CCA G-3′ with a BamHI restriction site (in boldface type) was used as 3′-primer to yield an ensemble of thisF_D11NNS gene variants. For randomization of position 130, a megaprimer was produced using the degenerate oligonucleotide 5′-GTC GTG GCG ATT NNS GCA AAA AGA-3′ as 3′-primer and the oligonucleotide 5′-TAT ACG CAT GCT CGC TAA AAG AAT AAT CGC-3′ with a SphI restriction site (in boldface type) as 5′-primer. In a second PCR, the purified megaprimer was used as 5′-primer, and the oligonucleotide 5′-GTC GAC GGA TCC ACA ACC CCT CCA G-3′ with a BamHI restriction site (in boldface type) was used as 3′-primer to yield an ensemble of thisF_D130NNS gene variants. The PCR-amplified ensembles of thisF genes containing randomized codons at amino acid position 11 or 130 were ligated into a modified pDS56/RBSII vector (termed pTNA), which contains a truncated derivative of the tryptophanase operon promotor (20Merz A. Yee M.C. Szadkowski H. Pappenberger G. Crameri A. Stemmer W.P. Yanofsky C. Kirschner K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 880-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) that permits constitutive gene expression in E. coli. The auxotrophic E. colistrain UTH860 (ΔhisF), which carries a mutant ehisF gene that encodes an inactive HisF protein (21Goldschmidt E.P. Cater M.S. Matney T.S. Butler M.A. Greene A. Genetics. 1970; 66: 219-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was transformed separately with the two plasmid libraries and plated onto LB medium containing 150 μg ml−1 ampicillin (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The resulting lawns of at least 105 clones were rinsed off the plates, and plasmid DNA was prepared from the mixture of colonies. The ΔhisF strain was retransformed with these plasmid libraries, and aliquots were streaked on LB medium plates (nonselective plates) or on minimal medium plates (22Vogel H.J. Bonner D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 218: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) without histidine (selective plates) and incubated at 37 °C. From the nonselective plates, 16 colonies with randomized thisF codon 11 and 18 colonies with randomized thisF codon 130 were picked, and the corresponding thisF genes were entirely sequenced. The mutational saturation is given by the following,p≤1−1−∑i=1mfinEquation 1 where p is the probability that, form randomized codons appearing with the relative frequencyfi, practically all possible amino acid combinations are present in a library containing n independent clones (23Darimont B. Stehlin C. Szadkowski H. Kirschner K. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1221-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Under the assumption that all 32 permitted codons appear with equal frequency (fi =132), mutational saturation (p ≥ 0.99) of one codon (m= 1) is attained with a library of more than 145 independent clones. Although the bases within codons 11 and 130 were not randomly distributed, every allowed base was found at all three codon positions. None of the thisF genes contained additional mutations. Considering the size of the two libraries, each of which contained at least 105 independent clones, it can be concluded that all 20 amino acids were represented at both randomized positions. To select for functional amino acids at position 11 or 130 of tHisF, for each library one selective plate was incubated for various time periods. A number of clones appeared on both plates overnight and, after 48 h, additional colonies appeared on the selective plate with thisF genes that were randomized at position 130. Incubation was continued for 1 week, but no additional colonies appeared. A number of colonies that grew on selective medium after different periods of time were picked, and the thisF_D11NNS or thisF_D130NNS genes that encoded functional tHisF proteins were sequenced. Wild-type tHisF and its variants containing individual amino acid exchanges were purified as described (19Thoma R. Obmolova G. Lang D.A. Schwander M. Jeno P. Sterner R. Wilmanns M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The yield was between 7 and 17 mg of purified enzyme per g of wet cell mass. Heterologous expression of thisH was conducted in E. coli W3110 ΔtrpEA2 cells containing pDS56/ RBSIISphI-thisH and the repressor plasmid pDMI, 1, as described for hisA fromT. maritima (19Thoma R. Obmolova G. Lang D.A. Schwander M. Jeno P. Sterner R. Wilmanns M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in 1 liter of LB medium supplemented with 0.15 mg/ml ampicillin and 0.075 mg/ml kanamycin. Overexpression of thisH was induced by adding 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at an optical density at 600 nm of about 0.6, and incubation was continued overnight. The cell suspension was washed with 100 mmpotassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm dithiothreitol, resuspended (5 ml of buffer per g wet cell mass), and lysed by sonification (Branson Sonifier W-250, 2 × 2 min, 50% pulse, 0 °C). According to SDS-PAGE, about 60% of tHisH were found in the soluble fraction of the cell extract. Benzonase (Merck) (50 units) was added to this fraction, which was then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and subsequently for 20 min at 75 °C. The resulting suspension was centrifuged (Sorvall SS34, 12,000 rpm, 30 min, 4 °C), and the pellet, which contained heat-labile host proteins, was discarded. The supernatant was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer at pH 8.0, containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm dithiothreitol, and loaded on an anion exchange column (POROS HQ20; 1 × 10 cm, PE Biosystems) that was equilibrated with the same buffer at room temperature. The column was washed with four volumes of equilibration buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with 1.5 liters of a linear gradient of 0–1m sodium chloride at pH 8.0. tHisH eluted between 130 and 150 mm sodium chloride, as judged from SDS-PAGE and conductivity measurements. Fractions containing tHisH were pooled, dialyzed against 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.5, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, loaded on a hydroxylapatite column (3.6 × 20 cm; Novartis) that was equilibrated with the same buffer, and eluted with 2 liters of a linear gradient of 10–500 mm potassium phosphate. tHisH eluted between 100 and 150 mm potassium phosphate with a purity above 95%, as judged from SDS-PAGE. The purification yielded ∼5 mg of tHisH per g of wet cells. Fractions containing pure tHisH were pooled, dialyzed against 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mmdithiothreitol, concentrated to 1.8 mg/ml using Centricon-10 concentration devices (Millipore), and shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Purification of proteins was followed by electrophoresis on 12.5 or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels using the system of Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and staining with Coomassie Blue. During purification, the protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The concentration of purified proteins was determined with molar extinction coefficients at 280 nm that were calculated from the amino acid sequence (26Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar). Analytical gel filtration was performed at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min on a Superdex 75 column (1 × 30 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that was equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate at pH 7.5, containing 300 mm sodium chloride. Apparent molecular masses were determined from the corresponding elution volumes, using a calibration curve that was obtained with standard proteins. Sedimentation equilibrium runs were performed in a Beckman analytical ultracentrifuge (model Optima XLA), following the absorption at 278 nm. Runs with tHisF were performed as described (27Höcker B. Beismann-Driemeyer S. Hettwer S. Lustig A. Sterner R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Runs with tHisH were performed at 24,000 rpm and protein concentrations of 12 and 23 μm in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, at 20 °C, containing 25 mm potassium chloride. Runs with tHisH-tHisF were performed at 18,000 and 24,000 rpm with 20 μm protein in 50 mm potassium phosphate at pH 7.5 at 20 °C, containing 300 mm sodium chloride. To determine apparent molecular masses, the runs were analyzed as described (27Höcker B. Beismann-Driemeyer S. Hettwer S. Lustig A. Sterner R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Fluorescence spectra were recorded with a F-4500 spectrofluorimeter (Hitachi) or a Cary Eclipse spectrofluorimeter (Varian). Proteolytic stability was tested at room temperature by incubating 10 nmol of substrate protein with 64 pmol of trypsin in 1 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5. The reaction was stopped after different time intervals by adding one volume of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heating for 5 min at 95 °C. The time course of proteolysis was followed on Tris-Tricine gels containing 20% acrylamide (28Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). The ammonia-dependent activity of isolated tHisF was measured by recording entire progress curves in 50 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.5, at 25 °C. In order to determineKmPRFAR, the enzyme was saturated with ammonia by adding 100 mm ammonium acetate corresponding to 14.4 mm NH3 at pH 8.5. PRFAR, 20 μm, were synthesized in situ from ProFAR, using a molar excess of HisA from T. maritima (19Thoma R. Obmolova G. Lang D.A. Schwander M. Jeno P. Sterner R. Wilmanns M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and completely converted by tHisF to ImGP and AICAR. The reaction was quantified by the decrease in absorption at 300 nm, using Δε300(PRFAR-AICAR) = 5.64 mm−1 cm−1(11Klem T.J. Davisson V.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5177-5186Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In order to determine KmNH3, the reaction was performed in the presence of 50 μm PRFAR at various concentrations of ammonium acetate between 0 and 200 mm, corresponding to 0 and 35 mmNH3 at pH 8.5. The glutamine-dependent activity of the tHisH-tHisF complex was measured in an analogous way as the ammonia-dependent reaction of tHisF, but the pH value was set to 8.0. In order to determineKmPRFAR, the reaction was performed with 20 μm ProFAR and 5 mml-glutamine. To determineKmGln, the reaction was performed in the presence of 50 μm PRFAR at various concentrations of glutamine between 0 and 7 mm. The progress curves were analyzed with the integrated form of the Michaelis-Menten equation (29Hommel U. Eberhard M. Kirschner K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5429-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), yielding values for Km andVmax. The glutaminase activity of tHisH in complex with liganded tHisF was measured in a coupled enzymatic assay with bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase (Sigma). Glutamate that was produced by tHisH was oxidized by a molar excess of glutamate dehydrogenase in the presence of NAD+, yielding 2-oxoglutarate and NADH + H+ + NH4+. The reaction was quantified by the increase in absorption at 340 nm, using Δε340(NADH-NAD+) = 6300m−1 cm−1. The values for KmGln andVmax were deduced from initial velocity measurement at various glutamine concentrations. tHisF was produced and purified as described previously (19Thoma R. Obmolova G. Lang D.A. Schwander M. Jeno P. Sterner R. Wilmanns M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The thisH gene (16Thoma R. Schwander M. Liebl W. Kirschner K. Sterner R. Extremophiles. 1998; 2: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was cloned into the expression vector pDS56/RBSII/SphI. Proteins were expressed in E. coli from this plasmid under the control of a lacoperator system (17Stüber D. Matile H. Garotta G. Lefkovits I. Pernis B. Immunological Methods. 4. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1990: 121-152Crossref Google Scholar). tHisH was purified from the soluble fraction of the cell homogenate by first heat-precipitating E. coli host proteins, followed by anion exchange and hydroxylapatite chromatography. The final preparation was more than 98% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE and gel filtration chromatography on Superdex 75 (data not shown). The presence of the N-terminal methionine residues of both purified tHisF and tHisH were confirmed by N-terminal protein sequencing. The complex of tHisF and tHisH (tHisH-tHisF) was prepared by mixing equal molar amounts of both proteins, followed by gel filtration chromatography in order to remove any unintentional surplus of either of the components. The concentration of the purified proteins was determined by absorption spectroscopy, using calculated molar extinction coefficients at 280 nm (26Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar) of 11,500m−1 cm−1for tHisF, 17,400 m−1cm−1 for tHisH, and 28,900m−1 cm−1for the tHisH-tHisF complex. The molecular masses and the association states of recombinant tHisF, tHisH, and tHisH-tHisF were determined by analytical gel filtration chromatography and equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation. tHisF eluted from a calibrated Superdex 75 column with an apparent molecular mass of 26.4 kDa (27Höcker B. Beismann-Driemeyer S. Hettwer S. Lustig A. Sterner R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), which is similar to the molecular mass for the monomer as calculated from the amino acid sequence (27.7 kDa). tHisH eluted with a significantly lower apparent molecular mass (17.4 kDa) than the calculated molecular mass for the monomer (23.1 kDa). A similarly retarded elution has been observed previously for eHisH (11Klem T.J. Davisson V.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5177-5186Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), for unknown reasons. Mixed equal molar amounts of tHisH and tHisF eluted as a single peak with an apparent molecular mass of 41.8 kDa, which is smaller than the calculated molecular mass for the 1:1 complex (50.8 kDa). In order to further clarify their association states, the molecular masses of tHisH, tHisF, and tHisH-tHisF were determined by analytical ultracentrif"

However, the precise intracellular signaling pathways responsible for this inducible expression are poorly understood. MnSODexpression in pulmonary epithelial and endothelial cells, treated with inflammatory mediators and various inhibitors, was studied by Northern analysis. The mitochondrial electron transport chain inhibitors, antimycin A and myxothiazol, selectively blocked TNF-α-inducible expression of MnSOD but not that of IL-1β or LPS, indicating different signaling pathways. N-Acetylcysteine could reliably decrease inducible MnSOD expression by TNF-α, but not IL-1, linking reactive oxygen species (ROS) to the TNF-α signaling pathway. Elevated levels of arachidonic acid have been demonstrated previously to generate mitochondrial ROS. A specific cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 inhibitor reduced stimulatedMnSOD expression by TNF-α, but not by IL-1β, further supporting the role of ROS. Other investigators have shown thatMnSOD expression may be regulated by NF-κB. Our results with a specific inhibitory κ-kinase inhibitor indicate that NF-κB modulates IL-1β signaling but not the TNF-α pathway.

In aerobic cells, the mitochondrial electron transport chain is probably the most abundant source of O⨪2. At atmospheric oxygen concentrations, it is estimated that between 1 and 3% of the O2 reduced in the mitochondrial electron transport chain during ATP production may form O⨪2(1Chance B. Sies H.

Elaborate intercommunications take place between the nucleus and mitochondria coordinating not only mitochondrial gene expression and genome maintenance but also nuclear gene expression (17Poyton R.O.

The classic view has been that mitochondria simply function as organelles responding to changes in energy demand. However, recent data would suggest a more complex picture where mitochondria also function as active signaling organelles in a number of important intracellular pathways (18Surpin M. Chory J.

The crucial toxic role of ROS was demonstrated by the inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport at specific sites, which differentially interferes with TNF-α-mediated cytotoxicity (25Schulze-Osthoff K.

Pharmacological experiments revealed that the mitochondrial respiratory chain is the major source of TNF-α-induced ROS (25Schulze-Osthoff K. Bakker A.C. Vanhaesebroeck B. Beyaert R. Jacob W.A.

Antioxidants inhibit various actions of TNF-α (transcription factor activation, gene expression, and cytotoxicity), and exogenously added ROS mimic its biological action (28Kinnula V.L. Aito H. Klefstrom J. Alitalo K. Raivio K.O. Cancer Lett. 1998; 125: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 29Arai T. Kelly S.A. Brengman M.L. Takano M. Smith E.H. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J.

Biol. 2000; 20: 5680-5689Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Our data would agree with the literature regarding ROS and TNF-α. In this paper, we show that inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport results in the loss of TNF-α-stimulated MnSODexpression, most likely due to the loss of mitochondria-to-nucleus signaling with ROS acting as the second messenger in the signal transduction pathway. In addition, we demonstrate that although inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, IL-1β, and LPS) may elicit similar inducible mRNA levels of MnSOD, the signaling pathways leading to this expression are very different. Recombinant human TNF-α (a gift from Genentech), IL-1β (a gift from NCI, National Institutes of Health), antimycin A, N-acetylcysteine, AACOCF3, SB 203580, PD 98059 (Calbiochem), Iκ kinase inhibitor, Bay 11-7082 (BioMol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), amobarbital (Amytal), 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide, oligomycin, and myxothiazol (Sigma) were used. L2 cells, a rat pulmonary epithelial-like line (ATCC CCL 149), were grown in Ham's F12K media (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Flow Laboratories, McLean, VA), 10 mml-glutamine, and antibiotic/antimycotic solution (ABAM, Sigma) at 37 °C in room air, 5% CO2. VA cells, a rat pulmonary artery endothelial cell line, isolated from segments of pulmonary artery by mechanical methods (11Visner G.A. Chesrown S.E. Monnier J. Ryan U.S. Nick H.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 453-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), were grown in Medium 199 with Earle's salts (Sigma) with sodium bicarbonate to pH 7.4, 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mml-glutamine, and antibiotic/antimycotic solution at 37 °C in room air, 5% CO2. LA9 cells, a mouse fibroblast antimycin-resistant mutant cell line (generously provided by Dr. Neil Howell, see Ref. 31Howell N. Huang P. Kelliher K. Ryan M.L. Somatic Cell Genet. 1983; 9: 143-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), were grown in Ham's F12K media (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Flow Laboratories, McLean, VA), 10 mml-glutamine, and antibiotic/antimycotic solution (ABAM, Sigma) at 37 °C in room air, 5% CO2. When the cells were 70–90% confluent they were exposed to inflammatory mediators (10 ng/ml TNF-α, 2 ng/ml IL-1, or 0.5 μg/ml LPS) and/or inhibitors. At 8 h after exposure, total RNA was isolated and evaluated by Northern analysis as described below. Total RNA was isolated by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction method described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (32Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62899) Google Scholar) with modifications (7Visner G.A. Dougall W.C. Wilson J.M. Burr I.A. Nick H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2856-2864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty micrograms of total RNA was size-fractionated on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.43-7.45Google Scholar) and electrotransferred to a charged nylon membrane (Zetabind, Cuno Laboratory Products, Cuno Inc., Meriden, CT) and UV covalently cross-linked. The membrane was hybridized with32P-labeled rat manganese superoxide dismutase or rat cathepsin B (as an RNA loading control) cDNAs and subjected to autoradiography. All autoradiographs depicted in the figures throughout this paper are representative of at least three independent experiments. Flow cytometric analysis of intracellular generation of ROS was performed using dihydrorhodamine 123 as a probe (34Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar, 35Shoji Y. Uedono Y. Ishikura H. Takeyama N. Tanaka T. Immunology. 1995; 84: 543-548PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in 6-well plates, and at confluence (1 × 106 cells/well) they were treated with TNF-α (10 ng/ml), antimycin A (4 μm), or a combination of TNF-α/antimycin A. After 8 h of incubation, dihydrorhodamine 123 (5 mm) was added, and the incubation was prolonged for an additional 30 min. The cells were harvested, washed, centrifuged for 5 min at 800 rpm, resuspended in phenol red-free M199 medium, and analyzed by flow cytometry (excitation, 488 nm; emission 530 nm). All results are expressed as means ± S.D. unless stated otherwise. The unpaired Student'st test was used to evaluate the significance of differences between groups, accepting p < 0.05 as the level of significance. Previous analysis of the effects of mitochondrial electron transport chain inhibitors showed that, depending on the site of action of the inhibitor, the cytotoxicity of TNF-α was either increased or decreased (25Schulze-Osthoff K. Bakker A.C. Vanhaesebroeck B. Beyaert R. Jacob W.A. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5317-5323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A schematic of the mitochondrial respiratory chain is shown in Fig. 1 A. Based on earlier experiments demonstrating stimulated expression ofMnSOD mRNA following treatment of a rat pulmonary epithelial-like cell line (L2 cells) with inflammatory mediators (7Visner G.A. Dougall W.C. Wilson J.M. Burr I.A. Nick H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2856-2864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,9Visner G.A. Block E.R. Burr I.M. Nick H.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: L444-L449PubMed Google Scholar), we initiated studies to evaluate the effect of TNF-α onMnSOD expression in cells also treated with mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitors. Fig. 1, B—D, illustrates the effects of treatment of L2 cells with antimycin A or amobarbital and/or TNF-α. The control samples exhibit a low constitutive level of expression of MnSOD mRNA. Addition of antimycin A or amobarbital at increasing concentrations (25Schulze-Osthoff K. Bakker A.C. Vanhaesebroeck B. Beyaert R. Jacob W.A. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5317-5323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) did not affect this constitutive MnSOD mRNA expression. Maximal induction ofMnSOD mRNA levels with TNF-α occurs after 8 h, and thus this time point was selected for isolation of RNA for Northern analysis. Cotreatment with TNF-α and antimycin A simultaneously caused a marked decrease in MnSOD mRNA expression at both concentrations of antimycin A (Fig. 1, B andC) (25Schulze-Osthoff K. Bakker A.C. Vanhaesebroeck B. Beyaert R. Jacob W.A. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5317-5323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amobarbital, which blocks electron transfer through complex I (Fig. 1 A), had minimal effect on TNF-α-induced expression of MnSOD mRNA compared with antimycin A (Fig.1, B and D). Microscopic examination at 8 h showed no apparent difference in the cellular viability between control and treated cells. With the results shown in Fig.1 B, we proceeded to evaluate the cellular specificity of the mitochondrial inhibitor, antimycin A, studying its effects on another cell type, the rat pulmonary artery endothelial cell line (VA cells, see Ref. 11Visner G.A. Chesrown S.E. Monnier J. Ryan U.S. Nick H.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 453-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). By observing that the two concentrations of antimycin A used in the pulmonary epithelial cell experiments (Fig. 1 B) gave similar results in the inhibition of TNF-α-stimulatedMnSOD mRNA levels and based on that fact that much lower concentrations of antimycin A are effective at inhibiting mitochondrial electron transport, we tested concentrations from 0.5 to 20 μm to find the optimum inhibitory concentration in the VA cells. Fig. 2, A andC, illustrates the effects of increasing concentrations of antimycin A on MnSOD mRNA levels. The maximal inhibition was achieved at a relatively low concentration of 4 μm. By using this concentration of antimycin A, we tested the effect on TNF-α-stimulated expression over 24 h. The maximal inhibition appears to occur between 8 and 12 h when both TNF-α and antimycin A were added simultaneously (data not shown). Furthermore, the sequence of addition of TNF-α or antimycin A to the cells was important for the TNF-α-stimulated expression of MnSODmRNA. If TNF-α was added as little as 15 min prior to antimycin A, the diminution of the inducible expression was dramatically reduced (data not shown). Other investigators (34Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar) have found that pretreatment of L929 cells with mitochondrial inhibitors resulted in a significant decrease in binding of TNF to cell surface receptors. Thus, all the cell treatments in our experiments were done simultaneously. Treatment of both pulmonary epithelial and endothelial cells with the complex III inhibitor, antimycin A, showed dramatic inhibition of TNF-α induction of MnSOD mRNA. With this in mind, we decided to test whether another complex III inhibitor would give similar results. The inhibitors, antimycin A and myxothiazol, both block electron transport at the cytochrome b-c1 segment of the mitochondrial respiratory chain but at different binding sites (37Thierbach G. Reichenbach H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 638: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar,38Iwata S. Lee J.W. Okada K. Lee J.K. Iwata M. Rasmussen B. Link T.A. Ramaswamy S. Jap B.K. Science. 1998; 281: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). Fig. 2, B and D, shows the effects of increasing concentrations of myxothiazol on TNF-α-stimulated expression of MnSOD mRNA. The extent of inhibition by myxothiazol is very similar to the pattern observed for antimycin A, which might be expected considering the proximity of the binding of antimycin and myxothiazol in the cytochrome b1-ccrystal structure (38Iwata S. Lee J.W. Okada K. Lee J.K. Iwata M. Rasmussen B. Link T.A. Ramaswamy S. Jap B.K. Science. 1998; 281: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the inhibition of gene expression by these electron transport inhibitors is exquisitely specific in that 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide, which also inhibits complex III but at a different site, does not alter TNF induction of MnSOD (data not shown). These results would suggest that inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport at complex III alters production of ROS that can act in retrograde communication with the nucleus. We have shown previously that both lipopolysaccaride (LPS) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) also induce expression of MnSOD in both pulmonary epithelial and endothelial cells (7Visner G.A. Dougall W.C. Wilson J.M. Burr I.A. Nick H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2856-2864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Visner G.A. Block E.R. Burr I.M. Nick H.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: L444-L449PubMed Google Scholar). Maximal induction occurs at 8–12 h similar to TNF-α. To evaluate whether signaling pathways for all three inflammatory mediators were similar when mitochondrial respiration is inhibited with antimycin A, we examined the effect that increasing concentrations of antimycin A had on the LPS- and IL-1-stimulated expression of MnSOD in VA cells (Fig. 3, A, C andD). Only at the highest concentration of antimycin A did the level of stimulated expression of MnSOD vary even slightly from LPS or IL-1 alone. This would suggest that the intracellular signaling pathway of TNF-α is different from that of LPS or IL-1. To demonstrate that the effects of antimycin A are directly associated with mitochondrial inhibition and not due to other possible side effects, we obtained an antimycin-resistant mouse fibroblast mutant cell line, LA9 (31Howell N. Huang P. Kelliher K. Ryan M.L. Somatic Cell Genet. 1983; 9: 143-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In this mutant, the rate of respiration is normal, but electron transport through the succinate-cytochrome c oxidoreductase segment of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which includes cytochromeb, shows resistance to inhibition by antimycin A. Fig. 3,B and E, illustrates the effect of TNF-α on the expression of MnSOD in the mutant LA9 cells. We should point out that we previously demonstrated that the five separateMnSOD mRNA transcripts in the rat result from alternative polyadenylation (39Hurt J. Hsu J.L. Dougall W.C. Visner G.A. Burr I.M. Nick H.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 20: 2985-2990Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar); however, there are only two murineMnSOD transcripts at 1 and 4 kilobase pairs. At concentrations of antimycin A varying from 0.5 to 20 μm, TNF-α continued to induce MnSOD mRNA levels demonstrating the specificity of the antimycin action in VA cells. Oligomycin, which inhibits F1FO-ATPase, causes uncoupling of mitochondrial respiratory electron transport and ATPase activity. Previous work by other investigators (40Sanchez-Alcazar J.A. Ruiz-Cabello J. Hernandez-Munoz I. Pombre P.S. del la Torre P. Siles-Rivas E. Garcia I. Kaplan O. Munoz-Yague M.T. Solis-Herruzo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30167-30177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that cells treated with TNF-α results in an increase in oligomycin-sensitive mitochondrial respiration, with the resultant increase in ROS. However, cells treated with both TNF-α and oligomycin resulted in decreased levels of cellular ATP as well as blockade of the increase in ROS generation (40Sanchez-Alcazar J.A. Ruiz-Cabello J. Hernandez-Munoz I. Pombre P.S. del la Torre P. Siles-Rivas E. Garcia I. Kaplan O. Munoz-Yague M.T. Solis-Herruzo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30167-30177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether oligomycin treatment of VA cells would inhibit TNF-α induction of MnSOD, we treated VA cells with increasing concentrations of oligomycin in the presence and absence of TNF-α. The results shown in Fig. 4,A and B, would indicate that oligomycin inhibits TNF-α-inducible MnSOD expression and that this inhibition may be due to the decreased mitochondrial ATP and/or ROS levels. Since levels of ROS have been shown previously to be increased in cells undergoing oxidative stress (41Boveris A. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1973; 134: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar,42Tan S. Yutaka S. Yuanbin L. Maher P. Schubert D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1423-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), we made use of the antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), to evaluate whether ROS scavenging can modulate TNF-α-inducible expression of MnSOD. NAC caused a dose-dependent decrease in the TNF-α-stimulated expression of MnSOD to base-line levels with no detectable effect on cell viability (Fig.5, A and C). However, NAC did not cause any change in the IL-1-inducible expression of MnSOD (Fig. 5, B and D), further evidence that the signaling pathways are different for TNF and IL-1. Of note, the concentrations of NAC capable of decreasing MnSODexpression are far below the millimolar levels used in much of the literature, demonstrating the potential importance of ROS in TNF-α-mediated signal transduction and the sensitivity of ROS in retrograde mitochondria-to-nucleus communication. Several studies (43Bondy S.C. Marwah S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 53-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 44Li Q. Cathcart M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2404-2411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 45Cocco T. Di Paola M. Papa S. Lorusso M. Free Radic. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 32357-32362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) have demonstrated the connection between arachidonic acid and mitochondrial ROS production. To explore whether inhibition of cPLA2 and thus mitochondrial ROS affect MnSOD expression, we utilized the potent and selective cPLA2 inhibitor, arachidonyltrifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF3) (44Li Q. Cathcart M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2404-2411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This inhibitor caused a dose-dependent repression of MnSOD expression in TNF-α-stimulated endothelial cells (Fig.6, A and C), whereas AACOCF3 had no effect on IL-1β-stimulated cells (Fig. 6, B and D). Other investigators (45Cocco T. Di Paola M. Papa S. Lorusso M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) have shown that ROS activation by diverse conditions is important for gene activation by NF-κB. To investigate whether NF-κB is important in TNF-α signaling ofMnSOD, we utilized the IκK inhibitor, BAY 11-7082 (47Pierce J.W. Schoenleber G.J. Jesmok G. Best J. Moore S.A. Collins T. Gerritsen M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21096-21103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). At increasing concentrations of the IκK inhibitor, MnSODexpression in IL-1-stimulated endothelial cells could be reduced to base line (Fig. 7, B andE), with no effect on TNF-α-stimulated cells (Fig. 7,A and D). These data suggest that NF-κB is activated in the IL-1β signaling pathway but not in the TNF-α signaling pathway of MnSOD. Other kinase signaling pathways were also investigated by using specific inhibitors. The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are a group of protein serine/threonine kinases that are activated in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli and mediate signal transduction from the cell surface to the nucleus. Two of the MAP kinase pathways that have been implicated in TNF-α and IL-1 signal transduction are JNK/SAPK and p38. The c-Jun kinase/stress-activated protein kinase cascade is activated following exposure to UV radiation, heat shock, or inflammatory cytokines. The p38 kinase (reactivating kinase) is the newest member of the MAP kinase family. It is activated in response to inflammatory cytokines, endotoxins, and osmotic stress. Selective inhibitors of the MKK1/2 (PD 98059) (48Kultz D. Madhany S. Burg M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13645-13651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and p38 (SB 203580) (49Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Um S.L. Borsch-Haubold A.G. Watson S.P. Fisher M.J. Jakubowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27723-27729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) were utilized at increasing concentrations to treat endothelial cells with or without TNF-α. No differences were seen between inducible expression of MnSOD with either of the inhibitors (representative example, Fig. 7, C and F) suggesting that TNF-α signal transduction for MnSOD likely does not occur through these MAP kinase pathways. Intracellular generation of ROS by cultured VA cells in response to TNF-α treatment was measured by flow cytometry using the fluorescent probe, dihydrorhodamine 123. As shown in Fig.8, treatment of cells with 10 ng/ml TNF-α for 8 h resulted in significantly higher rhodamine 123 fluorescence, indicating increased ROS generation. Of note, cells treated with 4 μm antimycin A did demonstrate increased fluorescence compared with control cells. However, cells treated simultaneously with TNF and antimycin A showed no higher fluorescence than cells treated with antimycin A alone. Cells treated with IL-1β did not have any more fluorescence than control cells. Manganese superoxide dismutase plays an important role in the cellular defense against superoxide produced by the mitochondrial electron transport chain during normal cellular metabolism (13Wong G.H.

However, the molecular intracellular signaling pathways and the nature of the induction of MnSOD by various inflammatory mediators are still being unraveled. Retrograde communication from the mitochondria to the nucleus likely consists of metabolic signals and transduction pathways that function across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Since ROS are very short lived molecules closely regulated by a coordinated enzyme system, they could be potential signal transducers of putative mitochondria-to-nucleus signaling pathways. Production of ROS in the mitochondria is related to changes in electron flux through the respiratory chain, brought about by various physiological conditions such as heat shock (55Lambowitz A.M. Kobayashi G.S. Painter A. Medoff G. Nature. 1983; 303: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), variations in oxygen tension (56Kramer R.S. Pearlstein R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1983; 80: 5807-5811Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and exposure to nitric oxide (57Henry Y. Guissani A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1003-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). ROS have been found to act as second messengers in cellular functions such as cell growth and differentiation (58Hansberg W. de Groot H. Sies H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 14: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 59Remacle J. Raes M. Toussaint O. Renard P. Rao G. Mutat. Res. 1995; 316: 103-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial respiration has been linked to the expression of the mammalian gene,GLUT1 (60Ebert B.L. Firth J.D. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29083-29089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Expression of the GLUT1 gene, one of the isoforms of the glucose transporter, is enhanced by hypoxia and by exposing cells to inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration (60Ebert B.L. Firth J.D. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29083-29089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Therefore, we postulated that inhibition of mitochondrial respiration might also regulate MnSOD expression possibly through a mechanism involving intracellular levels of ROS. Our data show that mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitors, antimycin A (Fig. 1, B and C, and Fig. 2,A and C) and myxothiazol (Fig. 2, Band D), as well as the F1FO-ATPase inhibitor, oligomycin (Fig. 4, A and B), can repress TNF-α-inducible expression of nuclear-encodedMnSOD. We have also addressed the specificity of the antimycin effects with studies in antimycin A-resistant LA9 mutant cells stimulated with TNF-α (Fig. 3, B and D). Northern analysis utilizing the antioxidant, NAC, would suggest that TNF-α-mediated pathways required intracellular ROS to function (Fig.5, A and C), whereas the IL-1β pathway did not (Fig. 5, B and D). In addition, the rhodamine 123 fluorescence data (Fig. 8) further implicate ROS, ROS by-products, and/or lipid peroxides as likely candidates for signal transduction from the mitochondria to the nucleus in the TNF-α signal pathway. In addition, other investigators (45Cocco T. Di Paola M. Papa S. Lorusso M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 46Woo C.H. Eom Y.W. Yoo M.H. You H.J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 32357-32362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) have shown that submicromolar concentrations of arachidonic acid cause a substantial increase in ROS production in mitochondria. The data in Fig. 6, A andC, would suggest that decreased levels of arachidonic acid, occurring as a result of selective blockade of cPLA2enzyme, are sufficient to inhibit the TNF-α-inducible expression ofMnSOD. Thus oxidative events generated in the mitochondrion, not simply inhibition of energy-coupled processes, are crucial in TNF-α-induced MnSOD gene expression. ROS or other mitochondrial intermediates may control both the cytotoxic and gene-regulatory effects of TNF-α, thus providing a basis for a mitochondria-to-nucleus signaling pathway, which requires bidirectional communication between the nucleus and the mitochondria. Although the cytotoxic activity of TNF-α seems to be rather restricted to tumor cells, nearly every cell type responds to TNF-α by the activation of a wide range of different genes (61Beutler B. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 62Lee T.H. Lee G.W. Ziff E.B. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1982-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation of genes involves interaction of cis-acting elements of DNA with their cognate DNA-binding proteins. TNF-α induces activation of nuclear factors that act as “third” messenger molecules specifically binding to cis-acting sequences. Perhaps the best understood example of the second messenger function of ROS is the activation of the mammalian transcription factor, NF-κB (63Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar). When activated, NF-κB induces the expression of various genes involved in inflammatory responses, immune cell regulation, and differentiation (64Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4563) Google Scholar). A diverse set of conditions can cause NF-κB activation (64Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4563) Google Scholar,65Schmidt K.N. Amstad P. Cerutti P. Baeuerle P.A. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 387: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Intracellular ROS are involved in the TNF-α signaling ofMnSOD expression (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3); however, our experiments with the Iκ kinase inhibitor (Fig. 7, A and B, andD and E) would indicate that although NF-κB may be involved in the IL-1β signaling pathway, it is not involved in TNF-α-inducible expression of MnSOD. In addition, our data would also suggest that the MAP kinase pathways involving c-Jun kinase/stress-activated protein kinase and p38 probably do not regulate expression of MnSOD (Fig. 7, C andF). Thus, our data would suggest that multiple signaling pathways result in stimulated expression of MnSOD. Clearly, inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport alters inducible expression ofMnSOD by TNF-α but not IL-1 or LPS. Thus, it would appear that the TNF-α signaling pathway requires retrograde communication from the mitochondria to the nucleus, probably involving intracellular ROS. However, due to the high reactivity of ROS and their production within the mitochondrial membrane, it is much more likely that the cytoplasmic signaling molecule of the TNF-α signaling pathway may be a protein acted upon by a lipid peroxide or other ROS or even the lipid peroxide itself. Our data with the cPLA2 inhibitor would seem to bolster this argument in the TNF-α pathway. Other investigators (46Woo C.H. Eom Y.W. Yoo M.H. You H.J. Han H.J. Song W.K. Yoo Y.J. Chun J.S. Kim J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32357-32362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) have shown that TNF-α-induced ROS production requires cPLA2 and 5-lipoxygenase activity but not cyclooxygenase activity in the Rac signal transduction cascade. This would suggest that ROS generation is dependent on synthesis of arachidonic acid and its subsequent metabolism to leukotrienes. In fact, exogenously applied leukotriene B4 could increase mitochondrial ROS (46Woo C.H. Eom Y.W. Yoo M.H. You H.J. Han H.J. Song W.K. Yoo Y.J. Chun J.S. Kim J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32357-32362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). A model of our proposed MnSODsignaling pathways is shown in Fig. 9, detailing the differences between the TNF-α and IL-1β pathways. It may be that a yet unidentified signal pathway is activated by intracellular reactive oxygen species, ultimately leading to DNA-protein interactions within the intronic enhancer ofMnSOD to produce the dramatic inductions seen with TNF-α (Fig. 9)."
https://openalex.org/W2033473463,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is tightly regulated by the cellular AMP:ATP ratio and plays a central role in the regulation of energy homeostasis. Previously, AMPK was reported to phosphorylate serine 621 of Raf-1 in vitro. In the present study, we investigated a possible role of AMPK in extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) cascades, using 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR), a cell-permeable activator of AMPK and antisense RNA experiments. Activation of AMPK by AICAR in NIH-3T3 cells resulted in drastic inhibitions of Ras, Raf-1, and Erk activation induced by insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Expression of an antisense RNA for the AMPK catalytic subunit decreased the AMPK activity and significantly diminished the AICAR effect on IGF-1-induced Ras activation and the subsequent Erk activation, indicating that its effect is indeed mediated by AMPK. Phosphorylation of Raf-1 serine 621, however, was not involved in AMPK-mediated inhibition of Erk cascades. In contrast to IGF-1, AICAR did not block epidermal growth factor (EGF)-dependent Raf-1 and Erk activation, but our results demonstrated that multiple Raf-1 upstream pathways induced by EGF were differentially affected by AICAR: inhibition of Ras activation and simultaneous induction of Ras-independent Raf activation. The activities of IGF-1 and EGF receptor were not affected by AICAR. Taken together, our results suggest that AMPK differentially regulate Erk cascades by inhibiting Ras activation or stimulating the Ras-independent pathway in response to the varying energy status of the cell.

Mammalian AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)1 plays a key role in the regulation of energy homeostasis and is highly conserved among animals, plants, and fungi (reviewed in Refs. 1Hardie D.G.

AMPK is a heterotrimeric enzyme consisting of a catalytic subunit (α) and two regulatory subunits (β and γ), and it is activated by the cellular stress causing ATP depletion, which in turn leads to elevation of the AMP:ATP ratio (reviewed in Refs. 1Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar, 2Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J.

Sci. 1999; 24: 22-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). These stresses include heat shock, ischemia/hypoxia in cardiac muscle, and exercise in skeletal muscle. In addition to allosteric activation by AMP, AMPK is activated by phosphorylation by an upstream kinase termed AMPK kinase (4Hawley S.A. Davison M. Woods A. Davies S.P. Beri R.K. Carling D. Hardie D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27879-27887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Once activated, AMPK suppresses the key enzymes involved in ATP-consuming anabolic pathways such as fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis (5Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar, 6Henin N. Vincent M.F. Gruber H.E. Van den Berghe G. FASEB. J. 1995; 9: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Besides, AMPK initiates a series of compensatory changes that increase cellular ATP supply by activating the rate of fatty acid oxidation (7Velasco G. Geelen M.J.H. Guzman M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar,8Merrill G.F. Kurth E.J. Hardie D.G. Winder W.W. Am. J.

Thus, AMPK has been speculated to play a role as a “fuel gauge”; that recognizes ATP depletion and maintains ATP level (reviewed in Refs.1Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar, 2Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar, 3Kemp B.E.

Most of the currently identified substrates of AMPK are metabolic enzymes. However, the recent implications of AMPK in transcriptional control (11Foretz M. Carling D. Guichard C. Ferre P. Foufelle F.

Power D.A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Kemp B.E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar) and Raf-1 kinase (15Sprenkle A.B. Davies S.P. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Sturgill T.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 254-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) suggest that it might be involved in the regulation of many cellular processes other than those that have been identified. Thus, it appears that numerous novel targets remain to be discovered. Recently, Sprenkle et al. (15Sprenkle A.B. Davies S.P. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Sturgill T.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 254-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) identified the principal Raf-1 Ser621 kinase activity present in cytosolic extracts of NIH-3T3 cells as AMPK by analyzing cytosolic fractions for Ser621 peptide kinase activity. They also demonstrated that AMPK phosphorylated Ser621 of Raf-1, which was expressed inEscherichia coli or Sf9 insect cell (15Sprenkle A.B. Davies S.P. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Sturgill T.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 254-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The Ser/Thr Raf-1 kinase is a key intermediate in the transduction of growth factor signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus (16Moelling K. Heimann B. Beimling P. Rapp U.R. Sander T. Nature. 1984; 312: 558-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 17Morrison D.K. Cutler R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Activation of receptor tyrosine kinases stimulates the small GTP-binding protein Ras, which interacts with cytoplasmic inactive Raf and recruits it to the plasma membrane where further activation steps occur (18Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar, 19Stokoe D. MacDonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Activated Raf in turn phosphorylates and activates MAPK/Erk kinase 1 (MEK1), which phosphorylates and stimulates mitogen-activated protein kinases/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (MAPKs/Erks). This pathway (Ras → Raf → MEK → Erk) has been known to play a significant role in the transmission of cellular proliferation and developmental signals (20Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar). Although the exact regulatory mechanisms for Raf-1 activity are not fully understood despite extensive investigations, they include phosphorylation of the enzyme (17Morrison D.K. Cutler R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). The role of Raf-1 Ser621 phosphorylation has been controversial. Ser621 was reported to be a constitutive phosphorylation site, and the mutation of this site to alanine resulted in a total loss of the kinase activity (21Morrison D.K. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Copeland T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17309-17316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, it was also claimed that phosphorylation of Ser621 by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) confers negative regulation (22Mischak H. Seitz T. Janosch P. Eulitz M. Steen H. Schellerer M. Philipp A. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5409-5418Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have taken a pharmacological and molecular approach to determine whether AMPK plays a role in Raf-1-involved signaling pathways. Our results suggest that AMPK can attenuate Ras activation induced by IGF-1 or EGF and that AMPK can also further stimulate Ras-independent Raf activation induced by EGF. Phosphorylation of Raf-1 Ser621, however, was not involved in the AMPK-mediated regulation of Erk cascades. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that AMPK is involved in the regulation of growth factor-induced multiple signaling pathways. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium, and the other cell culture products were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Forskolin and PD098059 were obtained from Calbiochem. EGF and IGF-1 were from Calbiochem and Sigma, respectively. 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR) and other chemicals were from Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) and [methyl-3H]thymidine (6.7 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. NIH-3T3, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, and COS-7 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% calf serum. H9c2 cardiomyoblasts were proliferated in DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. When confluent, cells were induced to differentiate for 6 days with medium containing 1% horse serum. About 80–90% confluent cells or H9c2 cardiomyotube were serum-starved for 16 h, and then the indicated pretreatment (1 mm AICAR, 50 μmPD098059, or 50 μm forskolin) was performed for 1 h in Krebs-Ringer buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 118 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.3 mmCaCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.3 mm MgSO4, 5 mmNaHCO3, 0.07% bovine serum albumin, and 5.5 mmglucose). Then cells were stimulated with 50 nm IGF-1 or 100 ng/ml EGF for the indicated time period. The anti-dual phospho-specific antibody that recognizes the active Erk1/2 was from New England Biolabs, Inc. Erk1/2 antibody that recognizes the total Erk1/2 regardless of their phosphorylation was from Transduction Laboratories. Antibodies for Raf-1 (C-12), EGF receptor (EGFR, 1005), IGF-1 receptor β subunit (IGF-1R, C-20), Grb2 (C-23), phosphotyrosine (PY20), and c-Myc (9E10) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Phosphospecific Raf Ser621 antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Andrey S. Shaw (Center for Immunology and Department of Pathology, Washington University, St. Louis, MO). The AMPK α1-specific antibody and the AMPK pan-α antibody were kindly provided by Dr. Ian Salt and Dr. D. Grahame Hardie (Biochemistry Department, The University, Dundee, UK). Raf-1 mutant constructs (Raf-wt, RafS621A, and RafR89L in pEFm vector fused with Myc epitope at its N terminus) were generous gifts from Dr. Richard Marais and Christopher J. Marshall (Cancer Research Campaign Center for Cell and Molecular Biology, Institute of Cancer Research, UK). GST-MEK(−) plasmid was provided by Dr. Kun-Liang Guan (Department of Biochemistry, University of Michigan, town, MI). A dominant negative Ras (RasS17N) was subcloned into pCMV-tag2B vector. cDNA corresponding to a portion of the coding region of AMPK α1 (amino acids 1–392) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction. It was subcloned into pcDNA 3 in such an orientation as to express an antisense RNA. The plasmid was transfected into NIH-3T3 cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), and stable transfectants were obtained in the presence of G418. Individual clones were further isolated and examined for the effect of an antisense RNA expression. Cells were lysed with digitonin buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 50 mm NaF, 30 mm glycerol phosphate, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm sodium metavanadate, and 0.4 mg/ml digitonin) on ice for 2 min. AMPK was partially purified from cell lysates by adding saturated ammonium sulfate to final 35% (v/v) concentration on ice for 15 min. AMPK activity was determined as previously described (23Davies S.P. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) with these fractionated proteins in kinase assay buffer (62.5 mmHEPES, pH 7.0, 62.5 mm NaCl, 62.5 mm NaF, 6.25 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1.25 mm EDTA, 1.25 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 200 μm AMP, ATP mixture (200 μm ATP and 1.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP), with or without 250 μm SAMS peptide (HMRSAMSGLHLVKRR) at 30 °C for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by spotting the reaction mixture on phosphocellulose paper (P81), and the paper was extensively washed with 150 mm phosphoric acid. The radioactivity was measured with a scintillation counter. Raf-1 kinase assay was performed essentially as described by Ziogas et al. (24Ziogas A. Lorenz I.C. Moelling K. Radziwill G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24108-24114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. After cell lysis, 500 μg of protein extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with a Raf-1 antibody (C-12) or c-Myc antibody (9E10) coupled to protein G-agarose. After extensive washing of the immunoprecipitates, the kinase assay was performed at 30 °C for 30 min in a kinase assay buffer containing the Raf-1 immune complex, 10 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 1 μg of kinase defective GST-MEK(−) as a specific substrate of Raf-1. After reaction, samples were centrifuged, and the supernatants were separated on 10% SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were blotted on nitrocellulose membranes, and the radioactivity incorporated into the substrates was measured by PhosphorImager. The resultant pellets were also resolved on the 10% SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for immunoblotting with a Raf-1 antibody to compare the amount of Raf-1 present in the immune complex. Raf Ras-binding domain (RBD) fragment (Raf-1 amino acid residues 1–149) fused to GST was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. The fusion protein was immobilized on glutathione-agarose. The activated Ras affinity precipitation assay was performed as described according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 500 μg of cell extracts were incubated with 5 μg of GST-RBD complexes for 30 min at 4 °C. After extensive washing of the agarose beads five times with immunoprecipitation washing buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 2% glycerol), the active Ras (Ras-GTP) bound to GST-RBD complexes was released by addition of 2× SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer. The amount of active Ras was determined by immunoblotting with an anti-pan Ras monoclonal antibody. To investigate a possible involvement of AMPK in the Ras/Raf/MEK/Erk signaling pathway, dose- and time-dependent effects of AICAR on IGF-1-induced Erk1 and Erk2 activation were first examined (Fig. 1, A andB). AICAR becomes a potent activator of AMPK after its intracellular phosphorylation to AMP-mimetic AICA-ribotide (ZMP) (5Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). NIH-3T3 cells were serum-starved for 16 h, pretreated with AICAR, and then challenged with 50 nm IGF-1 for 10 min. In the absence of AICAR, IGF-1 rapidly stimulated phosphorylation of Erk1 (p44 MAPK) and Erk2 (p42 MAPK) when examined by immunoblotting with an antibody specific for the active biphosphorylated form of Erk1 and Erk2. The pretreatment with AICAR inhibited IGF-1-dependent Erk activation in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and a maximum effect was observed at 1 mm of AICAR for 1 h of preincubation (Fig. 1, A and B). The total amount of Erk proteins was essentially the same at each condition. The kinetics of Erk phosphorylation correlated well with the enzyme activity, which was directly measured by an immune complex using mylein basic protein as a substrate (data not shown). As expected, AMPK was activated by AICAR in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and the maximum 3-fold activation was observed in 1 h at 1 mm AICAR (Fig. 1, C and D). These results suggest that AMPK is probably involved in the negative regulation of Erk cascades. The AMPK activation conditions found in this study are consistent with other reports showing that the maximum effect of AICAR on AMPK activity or cellular processes regulated by AMPK was observed in the range of 0.5–1 mm (5Corton J.M.

Because of the lack of molecular approaches for manipulating AMPK activity or a specific inhibitor, AICAR has been widely used to demonstrate a role of AMPK in various cell lines and tissues (5Corton J.M.

Thus, to substantially demonstrate the role of AMPK in Erk cascades, we established NIH-3T3 cells stably expressing an antisense RNA for the catalytic core region of AMPK catalytic α1 subunit, a predominantly expressed isoform in these cells, as described under “Experimental Procedures.”; Two isoforms of the AMPK catalytic subunit (α1 and α2) were identified, and α1 is ubiquitously expressed, whereas α2 is highly expressed in skeletal muscle, heart, and liver (27Carling D. Aguan K. Woods A. Verhoeven A.J.M. Beri R.K. Brennan C.H. Sidebottom C. Davison M.D. Scott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11442-11448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Stapleton D.

Both isoforms show an identical molecular mass (63 kDa) and have 90% amino acid sequence identity within the catalytic core (28Stapleton D. Mitchelhill K.I. Gao G. Widmer J. Michell B.J. Teh T.

For simplicity, we use anti-α1 to refer to NIH-3T3 cells expressing an antisense RNA. The immunoblot analysis using either an AMPK α1-specific antibody or an AMPK pan-α antibody that recognizes both α1 and α2 revealed that the expression level of AMPK α was substantially reduced in anti-α1 cells compared with the vector-transfected control cells (Fig.2 A). The reduced expression level of the α subunit resulted in a ∼30–40% decrease in the basal and the AICAR-stimulated AMPK activity (Fig. 2 B). When anti-α1 cells were pretreated with AICAR and then challenged with IGF-1, the inhibitory effect of AICAR on Erk activation was significantly diminished (Fig. 2 C). These results indicate that the effect of AICAR is indeed mediated by AMPK. In contrast to IGF-1, AICAR did not block EGF (100 ng/ml)-induced Erk activation, whereas PD098059, a specific inhibitor of MEK, almost completely inhibited Erk activation by two growth factors (Fig.3 A). One explanation for the selective effects of AICAR is that EGF could suppress the AICAR-stimulated AMPK activity. To this end, the effects of IGF-1 and EGF on AMPK activity were examined (Fig. 3 B). However, the results revealed that these two growth factors practically had no effect on the basal and the AICAR-stimulated AMPK activities (Fig.3 B), supporting the general perspective that AMPK system is stress-sensitive but not hormone-sensitive (1Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar, 2Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J.

Sci. 1999; 24: 22-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Therefore, these results suggest that the differential effects of AICAR are due to the intrinsic differences between signal pathways leading to Erk activation by IGF-1 and EGF. Next, to determine whether AMPK is involved in the regulation of Erk pathways in other cell types, we examined the AICAR effects in the COS-7, H9c2 cardiomyotube, and 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell lines (Fig.4). Although these cells showed slight differences, IGF-1-induced Erk activation was inhibited, whereas EGF-induced Erk activation was not affected by AICAR treatment in all cell lines tested (Fig. 4). Therefore, the effect of AMPK on Erk cascades is likely to be quite a widespread phenomena rather than certain cell type-specific. Erk cascades are among the most intensively studied signal transduction systems, and they have shown to participate in a diverse array of cellular activities such as cell proliferation, development, cell survival, and death (20Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar). To investigate a physiological significance of the AMPK-mediated Erk regulation, the effect of AICAR on the growth factor-induced DNA synthesis was examined. IGF-1 and EGF induced DNA synthesis ∼2-fold after 9 h of incubation and 4-fold after 19 h of incubation (Fig.5 A). In close correlation with the Erk phosphorylation level, AICAR treatment led to ∼70% inhibition of IGF-induced DNA synthesis after 9 h and 50% inhibition after 19 h, whereas EGF-induced DNA synthesis was relatively less affected, resulting in about 25% reduction (Fig.5 A). Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of AICAR on IGF-1-dependent DNA synthesis was distinctively diminished in the anti-α1 cell (Fig. 5 B), in which IGF-1-induced Erk activation is quite resistant to the AICAR-dependent down-regulation (Fig. 2 C). Under these conditions, no cytotoxic effects were observed (data not shown). A MEK inhibitor, 50 μm PD098059, almost completely blocked DNA synthesis induced by both growth factors, indicating that Erk activation is critical for cell proliferation. As shown in Fig. 3 A, AICAR exerted practically no effect on the basal Erk activity (first and fourth lanes) or EGF-induced Erk activation (third and sixth lanes). Nevertheless, this treatment resulted in statistically significant inhibition of the basal as well as EGF-induced DNA synthesis (Fig. 5). Thus, besides Erk cascades, some other mechanism(s) required for DNA synthesis seems to be affected by AICAR. This possibility is considered later under “Discussion.”; The previous report demonstrated that AMPK can phosphorylate Ser621 of Raf-1 in vitro(15Sprenkle A.B. Davies S.P. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Sturgill T.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 254-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The sequence around Raf-1 Ser621 exactly matches the recognition motif of AMPK (29Dale S. Wilson W.A. Edelman A.M. Hardie D.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Because it was also demonstrated that phosphorylation of this residue by PKA leads to inhibition of Raf-1 kinase (22Mischak H. Seitz T. Janosch P. Eulitz M. Steen H. Schellerer M. Philipp A. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5409-5418Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), we next examined the possibility that phosphorylation of Raf-1 Ser621 is a mechanism responsible for AMPK-mediated inhibition of Erk activation induced by IGF-1. To this end, we first analyzed the effect of AICAR on the phosphorylation level of Ser621 of Raf-1 (Fig.6). The Myc-tagged Raf-wild type (mycRaf-wt) plasmid was transiently transfected in NIH-3T3 cells, and in 48 h post-transfection, cells were treated for 1 h with 1 mm AICAR or 50 μm forskolin, which enhances cAMP accumulation and in turn activates PKA. The expressed mycRaf-wt protein was immunoprecipitated with a c-Myc epitope-specific monoclonal antibody 9E10 and then immunoblotted with a phosphospecific Raf Ser621 antibody. The basal phosphorylation level of Ser621 of mycRaf-wt was hardly detectable under our experimental conditions, and AICAR did not exert any effect on this residue, whereas forskolin markedly increased the phosphorylation level of Ser621 (Fig. 6, upper panel). Under the identical condition, forskolin did not exert any effect on mycRafS621A, in which Ser621 is replaced with alanine. There was essentially no difference in the amount of the immunoprecipitated mycRaf-wt and mycRafS621A (Fig. 6, lower panel). This result supports the previous finding that Ser621 of Raf-1 can be phosphorylated by PKA (22Mischak H. Seitz T. Janosch P. Eulitz M. Steen H. Schellerer M. Philipp A. Kolch W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5409-5418Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the report describing that AMPK in vitro phosphorylated Ser621 of the overexpressed Raf-1 from bacteria and insect cell (15Sprenkle A.B. Davies S.P. Carling D. Hardie D.G.

In the present study, we examined the role of gp130 in pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy using transgenic (TG) mice, which express a dominant negative mutant of gp130 in the heart under the control of α myosin heavy chain promoter. TG mice were apparently healthy and fertile. There were no differences in body weight and heart weight between TG mice and littermate wild type (WT) mice. Pressure overload-induced increases in the heart weight/body weight ratio, ventricular wall thickness, and cross-sectional areas of cardiac myocytes were significantly smaller in TG mice than in WT mice. Northern blot analysis revealed that pressure overload-induced up-regulation of brain natriuretic factor gene and down-regulation of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase 2 gene were attenuated in TG mice. Pressure overload activated ERKs and STAT3 in the heart of WT mice, whereas pressure overload-induced activation of STAT3, but not of ERKs, was suppressed in TG mice. These results suggest that gp130 plays a critical role in pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy possibly through the STAT3 pathway. gp130, a common receptor for the interleukin 6 family, plays pivotal roles in growth and survival of cardiac myocytes.

The IL-6 family of cytokines promotes cell type-specific pleiotropic effects by engaging multimeric receptor complexes that share the common affinity converter/signal-transducing subunit gp130 (11Hilton D.J.

It has been reported that transgenic mice expressing both IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor, in which the gp130 is continuously activated, showed marked hypertrophy of the ventricular myocardium (15Hirota H. Yoshida K. Kishimoto T. Taga T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4862-4866Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) and that targeted disruption of gp130 leads to severe anemia and a hypoplastic ventricular myocardium in the embryo (16Yoshida K.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). These results suggest that activation of gp130 induces cardiac hypertrophy, and it is still unknown whether gp130 mediates load-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Cardiotrophin-1 has been reported to promote survival of cardiac myocytes (17Sheng Z. Knowlton K. Chen J. Hoshijima M. Brown J.H. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5783-5791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Ventricular-restricted gp130 knockout mice showed marked ventricular wall dilatation with marked cardiomyocyte apoptosis and died in a week by pressure overload (18Hirota H. Chen J. Betz U.A. Rajewsky K. Gu Y. Ross J.J. Muller W. Chien K.R. Cell. 1999; 97: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). These results suggest that gp130 signalings prevent cardiomyocytes from apoptotic cell death during the pressure overload.In the present study, to determine the physiological significance of gp130 in load-induced cardiac hypertrophy, we generated transgenic (TG) mice, which express a dominant negative form of gp130 specifically in the heart and examined hypertrophic responses by pressure overload produced by constriction of the abdominal aorta.DISCUSSIONIt has been reported that gp130 is implicated in regulating cell growth, differentiation, and cell death in response to external stimuli in various tissues. In the present study, the TG mice were apparently healthy with no cardiac abnormalities at basal condition, suggesting that gp130 is not necessary for the development and the physiological function of the heart after birth. In contrast, gp130 plays a critical role in pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy. By constriction of the abdominal aorta, TG mice showed less increase in the heart weight/body weight ratio and less changes in expression of BNP and SERCA2 genes compared with WT mice. We used number 3 line of transgenic mice, which expressed D.N.gp130 most abundantly. Mice of number 1 and number 2 lines also showed similar results with mild degree (data not shown). These results suggest that D.N.gp130 dose-dependently suppresses cardiac hypertrophy.The intracellular signaling pathways evoked by gp130 activation include the Janus kinase-induced STAT pathway and the Ras-ERKs pathway (28Ernst M. Oates A. Dunn A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30136-30143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Activated STAT3 has been reported to form a homodimer that subsequently forms cis-inducing factor complexes and induces hypertrophy of cardiac myocytes (29Kodama H. Fukuda K. Pan J. Makino S. Baba A. Hori S. Ogawa S. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 656-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It has been reported that STAT3 plays a critical role in generating the hypertrophic signal (30Kunisada K. Tone E. Fujio Y. Matsui H. Yamauchi T.K. Kishimoto T. Circulation. 1998; 98: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and that mice overexpressing STAT3 showed marked cardiac hypertrophy (31Kunisada K. Negoro S. Tone E. Funamoto M. Osugi T. Yamada S. Okabe M. Kishimoto T. Yamauchi T.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In the present study, pressure overload activated ERKs and STAT3 in the heart of WT mice, whereas pressure overload-induced activation of STAT3, but not of ERKs, was suppressed in TG mice. These results suggest that pressure overload-induced activation of STAT3, but not of ERKs, is dependent on gp130 and that STAT3 may play a critical role in pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy.Hirota et al. (18Hirota H. Chen J. Betz U.A. Rajewsky K. Gu Y. Ross J.J. Muller W. Chien K.R. Cell. 1999; 97: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) have reported that ventricular-restricted knockout mice of gp130 showed dilatation of left ventricular wall and died within a week by constriction of transverse aorta without progression of adaptive hypertrophy of left ventricle (18Hirota H. Chen J. Betz U.A. Rajewsky K. Gu Y. Ross J.J. Muller W. Chien K.R. Cell. 1999; 97: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Although cardiac hypertrophy was attenuated, there was no sign of heart failure such as dilatation of left ventricular wall and reduced cardiac function nor death by constriction of the abdominal aorta in the D.N.gp130 TG mice. There are several possibilities for this discrepancy. First, the methods applied to produce the pressure overload were different. Transverse aortic constriction, applied in their experiment, induces stronger pressure overload than constriction of the abdominal aorta. It is possible that if the pressure overload is too strong, heart failure, but not adaptive cardiac hypertrophy, would be induced. To determine the role of gp130 in pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy, we used a mild pressure overload model of abdominal aortic constriction. Second, they used gp130 null mice, whereas we used D.N.gp130-overexpressing mice. Because pressure overload-induced activation of STAT3 was abolished in the heart of D.N.gp130 TG mice, endogenous gp130 activity is thought to be strongly suppressed by overexpression of D.N.gp130. However, there is a possibility that the two mice have different gp130 activity. The transgene lacks box3 but has box1 and box2 regions of the cytoplasmic domain of gp130. Although box3 is indispensable for the Janus kinase-induced activation of STAT3 (26Ernst M. Novak U. Nicholson S.E. Layton J.E. Dunn A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9729-9737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), there is a possibility that box1 and box2 have some biological functions. There is a possibility that the two mice have different ERK activities, which they did not examine (18Hirota H. Chen J. Betz U.A. Rajewsky K. Gu Y. Ross J.J. Muller W. Chien K.R. Cell. 1999; 97: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the ERK signaling pathway is important for the gp130-dependent cell survival of cardiac myocytes (17Sheng Z. Knowlton K. Chen J. Hoshijima M. Brown J.H. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5783-5791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) and that the tyrosine-containing motif, Tyr116-Xaa-Xaa-Val, of the cytoplasmic domain of gp130 is indispensable for the activation of SHP-2, a key molecule for the gp130-mediated signaling pathway leading to ERKs (26Ernst M.

Although the transgene lacks this motif, pressure overload induced activation of ERKs also in TG mice. These results suggest that some other factors such as angiotensin II and endothelin-1, which exert their effects through G protein-coupled receptors, play a predominant role in the activation of ERKs and cardiomyocyte survival in the TG mice. Although it remains to be determined how pressure overload induces production of the IL-6 family of cytokines in the heart, the present study suggests that gp130 plays a critical role in pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy possibly through the STAT3 pathway. Because recent clinical studies have suggested that cardiac hypertrophy is an independent risk factor of cardiac morbidity and mortality (1Levy D. Garrison R.J. Savage D.D. Kannel W.B. Castelli W.P.

The IL-6 family of cytokines promotes cell type-specific pleiotropic effects by engaging multimeric receptor complexes that share the common affinity converter/signal-transducing subunit gp130 (11Hilton D.J.

Cardiotrophin-1 has been reported to induce hypertrophy of cardiac myocytes in vitro (14Wollert K.C. Taga T. Saito M. Narazaki M. Kishimoto T. Glembotski C.C. Vernallis A.B. Heath J.K. Pennica D.

It has been reported that transgenic mice expressing both IL-6 and soluble IL-6 receptor, in which the gp130 is continuously activated, showed marked hypertrophy of the ventricular myocardium (15Hirota H. Yoshida K. Kishimoto T. Taga T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4862-4866Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) and that targeted disruption of gp130 leads to severe anemia and a hypoplastic ventricular myocardium in the embryo (16Yoshida K. Taga T. Saito M. Suematsu S. Kumanogoh A. Tanaka T. Fujiwara H. Hirata M. Yamagami T. Nakahata T. Hirabayashi T. Yoneda Y. Tanaka K. Wang W.Z. Mori C. Shiota K. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). These results suggest that activation of gp130 induces cardiac hypertrophy, and it is still unknown whether gp130 mediates load-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Cardiotrophin-1 has been reported to promote survival of cardiac myocytes (17Sheng Z. Knowlton K. Chen J. Hoshijima M. Brown J.H. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5783-5791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Ventricular-restricted gp130 knockout mice showed marked ventricular wall dilatation with marked cardiomyocyte apoptosis and died in a week by pressure overload (18Hirota H. Chen J. Betz U.A. Rajewsky K. Gu Y. Ross J.J. Muller W. Chien K.R. Cell. 1999; 97: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). These results suggest that gp130 signalings prevent cardiomyocytes from apoptotic cell death during the pressure overload. In the present study, to determine the physiological significance of gp130 in load-induced cardiac hypertrophy, we generated transgenic (TG) mice, which express a dominant negative form of gp130 specifically in the heart and examined hypertrophic responses by pressure overload produced by constriction of the abdominal aorta. DISCUSSIONIt has been reported that gp130 is implicated in regulating cell growth, differentiation, and cell death in response to external stimuli in various tissues. In the present study, the TG mice were apparently healthy with no cardiac abnormalities at basal condition, suggesting that gp130 is not necessary for the development and the physiological function of the heart after birth. In contrast, gp130 plays a critical role in pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy. By constriction of the abdominal aorta, TG mice showed less increase in the heart weight/body weight ratio and less changes in expression of BNP and SERCA2 genes compared with WT mice. We used number 3 line of transgenic mice, which expressed D.N.gp130 most abundantly. Mice of number 1 and number 2 lines also showed similar results with mild degree (data not shown). These results suggest that D.N.gp130 dose-dependently suppresses cardiac hypertrophy.The intracellular signaling pathways evoked by gp130 activation include the Janus kinase-induced STAT pathway and the Ras-ERKs pathway (28Ernst M. Oates A. Dunn A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30136-30143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Activated STAT3 has been reported to form a homodimer that subsequently forms cis-inducing factor complexes and induces hypertrophy of cardiac myocytes (29Kodama H. Fukuda K. Pan J. Makino S. Baba A. Hori S. Ogawa S. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 656-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It has been reported that STAT3 plays a critical role in generating the hypertrophic signal (30Kunisada K. Tone E. Fujio Y. Matsui H. Yamauchi T.K. Kishimoto T. Circulation. 1998; 98: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and that mice overexpressing STAT3 showed marked cardiac hypertrophy (31Kunisada K. Negoro S. Tone E. Funamoto M. Osugi T. Yamada S. Okabe M. Kishimoto T. Yamauchi T.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In the present study, pressure overload activated ERKs and STAT3 in the heart of WT mice, whereas pressure overload-induced activation of STAT3, but not of ERKs, was suppressed in TG mice. These results suggest that pressure overload-induced activation of STAT3, but not of ERKs, is dependent on gp130 and that STAT3 may play a critical role in pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy.Hirota et al. (18Hirota H. Chen J. Betz U.A. Rajewsky K. Gu Y. Ross J.J. Muller W. Chien K.R. Cell. 1999; 97: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) have reported that ventricular-restricted knockout mice of gp130 showed dilatation of left ventricular wall and died within a week by constriction of transverse aorta without progression of adaptive hypertrophy of left ventricle (18Hirota H. Chen J. Betz U.A. Rajewsky K. Gu Y. Ross J.J. Muller W. Chien K.R. Cell. 1999; 97: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Although cardiac hypertrophy was attenuated, there was no sign of heart failure such as dilatation of left ventricular wall and reduced cardiac function nor death by constriction of the abdominal aorta in the D.N.gp130 TG mice. There are several possibilities for this discrepancy. First, the methods applied to produce the pressure overload were different. Transverse aortic constriction, applied in their experiment, induces stronger pressure overload than constriction of the abdominal aorta. It is possible that if the pressure overload is too strong, heart failure, but not adaptive cardiac hypertrophy, would be induced. To determine the role of gp130 in pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy, we used a mild pressure overload model of abdominal aortic constriction. Second, they used gp130 null mice, whereas we used D.N.gp130-overexpressing mice. Because pressure overload-induced activation of STAT3 was abolished in the heart of D.N.gp130 TG mice, endogenous gp130 activity is thought to be strongly suppressed by overexpression of D.N.gp130. However, there is a possibility that the two mice have different gp130 activity. The transgene lacks box3 but has box1 and box2 regions of the cytoplasmic domain of gp130. Although box3 is indispensable for the Janus kinase-induced activation of STAT3 (26Ernst M. Novak U. Nicholson S.E. Layton J.E. Dunn A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9729-9737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), there is a possibility that box1 and box2 have some biological functions. There is a possibility that the two mice have different ERK activities, which they did not examine (18Hirota H. Chen J. Betz U.A. Rajewsky K. Gu Y. Ross J.J. Muller W. Chien K.R. Cell. 1999; 97: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the ERK signaling pathway is important for the gp130-dependent cell survival of cardiac myocytes (17Sheng Z. Knowlton K. Chen J. Hoshijima M. Brown J.H. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5783-5791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) and that the tyrosine-containing motif, Tyr116-Xaa-Xaa-Val, of the cytoplasmic domain of gp130 is indispensable for the activation of SHP-2, a key molecule for the gp130-mediated signaling pathway leading to ERKs (26Ernst M.

Although the transgene lacks this motif, pressure overload induced activation of ERKs also in TG mice. These results suggest that some other factors such as angiotensin II and endothelin-1, which exert their effects through G protein-coupled receptors, play a predominant role in the activation of ERKs and cardiomyocyte survival in the TG mice. Although it remains to be determined how pressure overload induces production of the IL-6 family of cytokines in the heart, the present study suggests that gp130 plays a critical role in pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy possibly through the STAT3 pathway.

This enzymatic complex is activated by association of its cytosolic factors p67phox , p47phox , and the small G protein Rac with a membrane-associated flavocytochrome b558. Here we report the crystal structure of the active N-terminal fragment of p67phox at 1.8 Å resolution, as well as functional studies of p67phox mutants. This N-terminal region (residues 1–213) consists mainly of four TPR (tetratricopeptide repeat) motifs in which the C terminus folds back into a hydrophobic groove formed by the TPR domain. The structure is very similar to that of the inactive truncated form of p67phox bound to the small G protein Rac previously reported, but differs by the presence of a short C-terminal helix (residues 187–193) that might be part of the activation domain. All p67phox mutants responsible for Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD), a severe defect of NADPH oxidase function, are localized in the N-terminal region. We investigated two CGD mutations, G78E and A128V. Surprisingly, the A128V CGD mutant is able to fully activate the NADPH oxidase in vitro at 25 °C. However, this point mutation represents a temperature-sensitive defect in p67phox that explains its phenotype at physiological temperature.1hh8 Upon activation, the NADPH oxidase from neutrophils produces superoxide anions in response to microbial infection.

This enzymatic complex is activated at the onset of phagocytosis by association of its cytosolic factors p67phox , p47phox , and the small G protein Rac with a membrane-associated flavocytochrome b558 (1Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in any of these components except Rac can lead to a severe immune defect known as Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD).1 The cytosolic factors p47phox , p40phox , and p67phox are modular proteins comprising a set of structural domains such as SH3 domains, proline-rich regions, and TPR motifs (2Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), all of which are prone to protein-protein interactions. Through these various domains, the cytosolic factors are able, upon stimulation, to associate, translocate to the membrane, and finally activate the electron transfer from NADPH to O2through the flavocytochrome b558. Over the past few years, serious efforts have been made to delineate the nature and the succession of intra- and intermolecular interactions between the cytosolic factors leading to the activated complex (3Fuchs A. Dagher M.-C. Vignais P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5695-5697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 4DeLeo F.R. Quinn M.T. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1996; 60: 677-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Most, if not all, pairwise interacting protein domains have been identified, but the sequence of the molecular rearrangements as well as the structural modifications governing this cascade are still a matter of debate. It is known that Rac can interact in a GTP-dependent manner with the N-terminal region of p67phox comprising amino acids 1–199 (5Diekmann D. Abo A. Johnston C. Segal A.W. Hall A. Science. 1994; 265: 531-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Moreover, all known missense mutations in p67phox responsible for CGD are localized in this N-terminal region (6Noack D. Rae J. Cross A.R. Munoz J. Salmen S. Mendoza J.A. Rossi N. Curnutte J.T. Heyworth P.G. Hum. Genet. 1999; 105: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This region of p67phox has been shown to contain four TPR motifs (2Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) that were first identified as degenerate 34 amino acid sequences present in a variety of proteins from bacteria to eukaryotes (7Goebl M. Yanagida M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 173-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 8Lamb J.R. Tugendreich S. Hieter P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 257-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). One TPR motif consisting of two antiparallel α helices termed A and B and a TPR domain (a succession of TPR motifs) adopts an overall superhelical fold (9Das A.K. Cohen P.T.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Using various binding assays, a first study suggested that p67phox interacts with Rac only through 30 residues downstream of the TPR domain (10Ahmed S. Prigmore E. Govind S. Veryard C. Kozma R. Wientjes F.B. Segal A.W. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15701-15963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A second study showed that Rac-p67phox interaction involves the TPR domain itself (11Koga H. Terasawa H. Nunoi H. Takeshige K. Inagaki F. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25051-25060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To unravel the properties and Rac binding sites on p67phox , structures of the non-complexed p67phox and of the Rac-p67phox complex had to be deciphered. Recently, a first piece of the puzzle was achieved with the structure at 2.4 Å of the complex between the N-terminal region of p67phox (residues 1–203) and Rac-GTP, showing an unusual interaction of a TPR domain with a partner protein (12Lapouge K. Smith S.J Walker P.A. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Rittinger K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 899-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In this study, we report the structure at 1.8 Å resolution of the catalytically active N-terminal region (residues 1–213) of p67phox that contains four TPR motifs. We compared it to the Rac-p67phox structure as well as to other TPR domain structures. We have also investigated the molecular and structural basis of the defects due to some of the CGD mutations. In particular, we report biochemical and biophysical evidence for the instability of the A128V mutant at physiological temperature, in agreement with our structural analyses. The cDNA for the N-terminal part of p67phox corresponding to amino acids 1–213 was obtained by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into pET-15b (Novagen). The protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and purified by affinity chromatography in two steps: first on a Ni2+-column equilibrated in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 250 mmNaCl and eluted with a linear gradient of imidazole and second on an SP-Sepharose column equilibrated in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5 and eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl. The protein was then concentrated to 5–6 mg/ml with Centricon10 (Amicon). Seleno-l-methionine (Se-Met)-labeled protein was produced in a similar way. The protein was expressed in E. coli B834 (DE3). A 50-ml preculture in Luria-Bertani medium was used to inoculate 2 liters of a defined medium prepared as reported before (13LeMaster D.M. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7263-7268Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) supplemented with 20 mg/liter of Se-Met. The last purification step was done in the presence of 10 mm dithiothreitol and 1 mm EDTA to avoid oxidation of selenomethionines. High resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was consistent with 100% selenium incorporation. Mutants G78E and A128V of p67phox -(1–213) were constructed using site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene kit) on the native cDNA cloned in the pET-15b vector. The mutant A128V was expressed inE. coli BL21 (DE3) at 15 °C for 16 h instead of the 3 h at 37 °C employed for the native protein. The first steps of the purification were the same as for the native protein, but an additional purification step was carried out by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 Hiload 16/60 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equlibrated in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5 and 200 mmNaCl. The protein was concentrated to 5 mg/ml with Centricon10. Native p67phox -(1–213) and the A128V mutant at a concentration of 0.6 mg/ml were submitted to limited proteolysis for one hour at 25 °C by trypsin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at a protease/protein ratio of 1:200 (w/w). CD spectra were recorded on a Jobin Yvon CD6 dichrograph from 190 to 260 nm with a 1-mm path length cell and a thermostated cell holder. The protein concentrations were 0.5 mg/ml. The spectra were recorded on one sample per protein from 15 to 35 °C by increments of 5 °C. At each temperature, the sample was incubated for 15 min. The NADPH oxidase activating potency was assessed in a semi-recombinant cell-free system (14Fuchs A. Dagher M.-C. Jouan A. Vignais P.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) containing 3.5 μg of membrane protein, 20 pmol of recombinant p47phox , 20–400 pmol of an N-terminal fragment of p67phox , 2 mmMgCl2 and 10 pmol of Rac in a final volume of 200 μl. Rac was loaded with GTP-γ-S in the presence of 4 mm EDTA, followed by addition of MgCl2 to 20 mm. An optimal amount of arachidonic acid (5–20 nmol) was added with strong agitation. After a 10-min activation, the elicited oxidase activity was assessed using the superoxide dismutase inhibitable cytochromec reduction in the presence of 250 μm NADPH and 100 μm cytochrome c, followed at 550 nm using a Labsystem IEMS microplate reader. Rac fused to GST or GST alone were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Rac was loaded with GTP-γ-S on the beads. The beads were washed and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with a stoichiometric amount of p67phox -(1–213) or the A128V mutant. After washing, proteins bound to the beads were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Crystals of the native protein or the Se-Met protein were grown at 20 °C by vapor diffusion in hanging drops by mixing equal volumes of protein (5–6 mg/ml) and reservoir solutions (17% polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 2000, 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.5, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm dithiothreitol in the case of the Se-Met protein). The crystals grew as thin needles (20 × 20 × 200 μm3) and belong to the trigonal space groupP31 (a = b = 67.7 Å, c = 50.2 Å) with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Crystals exhibit various amounts of merohedral twinning; however, non-twinned crystals could be selected after analyzing the diffraction data. 2A. Royant, S. Grizot, F. Fieschi, E. M. Landau, R.

A SAD data set was collected on a selenomethionyl-substituted crystal at the K absorption edge of selenium (beamline ID29, ESRF-Grenoble).

Final phases from MLPHARE resulted in a figure of merit of 0.37–2.8 Å resolution. Phases were extended to 1.8 Å on the native data set using the program DM (16CCP N°4, Acta Crystallogr. Sec.

Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1997; 53: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Loop residues 151–158, residues 2–3 at the N terminus and 191–193 at the C terminus were added manually using the program O (19Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The model consists of residues 2–193 of p67phox , 160 water molecules, and one citrate anion, the citrate being essential for crystallization. All non-glycine residues are in the most favored or additionally allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot according to PROCHECK (21Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl.

Open table in a new tab The N-terminal region of p67phox used in this study was shown to be fully competent in NADPH oxidase activation bothin vitro and in vivo (24Han C.-H. Freeman J.L. Lee T.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1211-1220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The electron density map obtained from SAD phasing was clearly interpretable (Fig.1). p67phox -(1–213) consists of four TPR motifs followed by an extended loop, which inserts into the hydrophobic groove formed by the helical organization of the TPRs (Fig.2). The first three TPRs are contiguous and 16 residues (105 to 120) forming two antiparallel β-strands are inserted between TPR3 and TPR4. A comparison with other recently reported TPR domain structures (9Das A.K. Cohen P.T.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 26Scheufler C. Brinker A.

Cell. 2000; 101: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar) highlights a remarkable conservation of the overall structure. For example, the TPR1 domain of Hop (PDB accession code 1ELW), composed of three TPR motifs, could be superimposed on three consecutive TPR motifs of p67phox with rmsd values of 0.95 Å and 1.40 Å with the first three and the last three p67phox TPRs, respectively. This indicates that the fold of TPR domains is highly conserved despite a rather small sequence identity; in addition, the insertion of amino acids 105–120 in p67phox does not disrupt the superhelical structure of the TPR domain. Following TPR4, a helix (residues 156–166) terminates the TPR domain and an extended structure (residues 168–186) folds back into the internal hydrophobic groove of the super-helix. The structure ends with a short helix (residues 187–193), mainly composed of polar residues. Residues 170–185 interact extensively with residues belonging to the A helices of TPR motifs or to the inserted β-strands (Fig. 2 b), probably stabilizing the overall structure. In particular, Arg-181 interacts with Gln-115. In the Rac-p67phox complex, Arg-181 is replaced by Lys-181 and the same type of interaction is observed, consistent with the existence of a polymorphism (6Noack D. Rae J. Cross A.R. Munoz J. Salmen S. Mendoza J.A. Rossi N. Curnutte J.T. Heyworth P.G. Hum. Genet. 1999; 105: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The sequence of p67phox (1) is extremely rich in basic amino acids with 22 lysine and 6 arginine residues located mainly on the external surface of the super-helix. These residues are uniformly distributed at the surface without forming a highly basic patch. Residues downstream from Leu-193 are not visible in the electron density map.Figure 2Overall structure. A ribbonrepresentation of the structure shows the four TPR motifs labeled ina, the A and B type helices are shown in b. The TPRs adopt an overall super-helix fold (colored from blue to green). The C terminus in red is in an extended conformation locked in the hydrophobic groove formed by the TPRs and ends with a short helix. The inserted β-strands between TPR 3 and 4 are shown in yellow. a and b are two perpendicular views of the molecule.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The recent structure of Rac-p67phox -(1–203) (12Lapouge K. Smith S.J Walker P.A. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Rittinger K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 899-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) showed that all the residues of p67phox involved in the complex formation belong to the inserted β-strands (Arg-102, Asn-104, Leu-106, Asp-108) or to the loops connecting TPR1 to TPR2 (S37) and TPR2 to TPR3 (D67, H69). The structures of both the non-complexed and complexed forms of p67phox can be remarkably well superimposed with a rmsd of 0.57 Å on main chain atoms, showing that the interaction of p67phox (1) with Rac does not require structural rearrangements of this N-terminal region. In particular, the residues involved in the interaction with Rac are totally accessible in the non-complexed structure, their side chains pointing toward the solvent. Although the two constructs of p67phox (1–203 in the complex and 1–213 in this study) differ only by ten amino acids in length, the first was reported to be inactive whereas the second fully activates NADPH oxidase in vitro (24Han C.-H. Freeman J.L. Lee T. Motalebi S.A. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16663-16668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This drastic difference could be related to the presence of the C-terminal α-helix (residues 187–193) present in our model that is not seen in the Rac-p67phox complex structure, although amino acids 1–203 of p67phox are present in the crystal. The folding of this helix is probably facilitated by the presence of amino acids up to 213. From functional studies of various truncated forms of p67phox , amino acids 199–210 of p67phox were defined as an NADPH oxidase activation domain (24Han C.-H. Freeman J.L. Lee T. Motalebi S.A. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16663-16668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and this region was reported to be involved in the regulation of electron transfer (27Nisimoto Y. Motalebi S. Han C.-H. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22999-23005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The comparison of the structure of p67phox -(1–213) to that of p67phox -(1–203) in the Rac-p67phox complex (12Lapouge K. Smith S.J Walker P.A. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Rittinger K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 899-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) suggests that the activation domain includes helix 187–193. CGD is an inherited disorder of neutrophil function characterized by an increased susceptibility to infection because of a defect in the NADPH oxidase components. Mutations involving p67phox are single cases and are located in the N-terminal region of the protein. An in-frame deletion of K58 was found to prevent Rac binding to p67phox (28Leusen J.H. de Klein A. Hilarius P.M. Ahlin A. Palmblad J. Smith C.I. Diekmann D. Hall A. Verhoeven A.J. Roos D. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1243-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Deletion of amino acids 19–21 renders the protein inefficient for oxidase activation (29Patino P.J. Rae J. Noack D. Erickson R. Ding J. de Olarte D.G. Curnutte J.T. Blood. 1999; 94: 2505-2514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These amino acids are located between helices A and B of TPR1 and are exposed to solvent. Various point mutations encountered in p67phox of CGD patients (R77Q, G78E, A128V, D160V/K161E) were studied and shown to be associated with the absence of the protein in vivo (6Noack D. Rae J. Cross A.R. Munoz J. Salmen S. Mendoza J.A. Rossi N. Curnutte J.T. Heyworth P.G. Hum. Genet. 1999; 105: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 30de Boer M. Hilarius-Stokman P.M. Hossle J.-P. Verhoeven A.J. Graf N. Kenney R.T. Seger R. Roos D. Blood. 1994; 83: 531-536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This observation accounts either for mRNA or protein instability or for an increased sensitivity to proteases. Amino acids Gly-78 and Ala-128 are located in similar positions in the α-helices of the TPR motifs (position 8 of helix A). Their mutations are likely to destabilize TPR packing. A sequence alignment of multiple TPRs shows that position 8 in helix A is restricted to glycine, alanine, or serine residues. We produced G78E and A128V CGD mutants of p67phox -(1–213). The G78E mutant was insoluble in bacteria. Because the A128V mutant showed lower solubility than the native protein, it was expressed at 15 °C instead of 37 °C. Surprisingly, this mutant was still able to bind Rac and to activate the NADPH oxidase in a cell-free system at 25 °C (Fig.3), suggesting correct folding. Moreover, the CD spectra at 25 °C of the mutant and of the native proteins were identical and characteristic of α-helices, indicating no modification in the secondary structure (Fig.4, inset). Altogether, these experiments do not explain the CGD phenotype of this mutant. To assess slight differences in the tertiary structure, the native protein and the A128V mutant were subjected to limited proteolysis by trypsin at 25 °C. As shown in Fig. 5, the native protein is poorly degraded up to 60 min, whereas the A128V mutant shows notable degradation starting at 15 min. Additionally, the CD spectrum as a function of the temperature shows that the native protein is still stable at 40 °C whereas the A128V mutant begins to loose its helical folding at 30 °C (Fig. 4) and precipitates at 40 °C.Figure 4CD Spectra. CD spectra at 15 °C (solid line) and 35 °C (dashed line) of the A128V mutant.

The mutation G78E leads to a misfolding of the protein by steric hindrance within the TPR2 motif. In the less drastic mutant A128V, Val-128 would be located at 2.2 Å of the carbonyl of Ala-140 or of the hydroxyl of Tyr-172 (Fig. 6). This hydroxyl in the native structure is stabilized by two hydrogen bonds. Although the environment should be able to accommodate this moderate steric change, the hydrogen-bond network is perturbed and the structure of the A128V mutant is weakened. Within the cellular environment at 37 °C, the decrease in stability because of this mutation probably leads to misfolded p67phox protein. This mutation is akin to other point mutations introduced at position 8 of the A helix of a TPR motif in p62cdc23 (Ala→Thr or Gly→Asp), which also confer thermolability to the protein (31Sikorski R.S. Michaud W.A. Hieter P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 121-1221Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, the structure of the active N-terminal domain of p67phox -(1–213) highlights a short α-helix that participates to the NADPH oxidase activation domain. Interestingly, most of the CGD mutants of p67phox are located in the N-terminal region of p67phox . The structural and functional studies reported here permit an elucidation of the instability of the G78E and A128V mutants and may be extended to mutations that affect TPR folding.

https://openalex.org/W2009312050,"A novel protein factor, named PcF, has been isolated from the culture filtrate of Phytophthora cactorum strain P381 using a highly sensitive leaf necrosis bioassay with tomato seedlings. Isolated PcF protein alone induced leaf necrosis on its host strawberry plant. The primary structure and cDNA sequence of this novel phytotoxic protein was determined, and BLAST searches of Swiss-Prot, EMBL, and GenBank(TM)/EBI data banks showed that PcF shared no significant homology with other known sequences. The 52-residue PcF protein, which contains a 4-hydroxyproline residue along with three S-S bridges, exhibits a high content of acidic sidechains, accounting for its isoelectric point of 4.4. The molecular mass of isolated PcF is 5,622 +/- 0.5 Da as determined by mass spectrometry and matches that calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence with cDNA sequencing. The cDNA sequence indicates that PcF is first produced as a larger precursor, comprising an additional N-terminal, 21-residue secretory signal peptide. Maturation of this protein involves the hydroxylation of proline 49, a feature that is unique among other known secreted fungal phytopathogenic proteins."

Here we show that the Brk protein functions as a repressor by binding to Dpp response elements. The Brk DNA binding activity was localized to an amino-terminal region containing a putative homeodomain. Brk bound to a Dpp response element of the Ultrabithorax(Ubx) midgut enhancer at a sequence that overlaps a binding site for the Smad protein, Mothers Against Dpp (Mad). Furthermore, Brk was able to compete with Mad for occupancy of this binding site. This recognition of overlapping binding sites provides a potential explanation for why the G/C-rich Mad binding site consensus differs the Smad3/Smad4 binding site consensus. We also found that the Dpp response element from Ubx was more sensitive than the vgquadrant enhancer to repression by Brk. This difference correlates with short-range activation of Ubx by Dpp in the visceral mesoderm, whereas vg exhibits a long-range response to Dpp in the wing imaginal disc, indicating that Brk binding sites may play a critical role in limiting thresholds for activation by Dpp. Finally, we provide evidence that Brk is capable of functioning as an active repressor.

The Mad consensus bears a limited resemblance to an inverted pair of Smad boxes, but it is not clear why the two sequences differ. The Mad consensus may extend to the vertebrate BMP-responsive Smads because Smad1 acts through a Mad-like site to activate the Smad6 gene (37Ishida W. Hamamoto T. Kusanagi K. Yagi K. Kawabata M.

One possibility is that the Mad consensus reflects involvement of a cofactor, consistent with the general dependence of Smads on cofactors (39Massague J. Chen Y.G.

An unexpected twist to the Dpp regulatory cascade came to light with the discovery of brinker (brk), a gene that is negatively regulated by Dpp and, in turn, functions as a negative regulator of Dpp targets (41Minami M. Kinoshita N. Kamoshida Y. Tanimoto H. Tabata T. Nature. 1999; 398: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 42Jazwinska A. Kirov N. Wieschaus E. Roth S. Rushlow C.

In the wing imaginal disc, Dpp targets such as sal, omb, and vg are expressed ectopically in brk −/− clones. Ectopic expression of these genes occurs even in cells where abrk − clone overlaps a clone mutant for Mad or the Dpp receptor thickveins (tkv). These results revealed that Dpp activates targets indirectly through repression ofbrk, which has recently been shown to occur in conjunction with the Mad cofactor, Schnurri (45Marty T. Muller B. Basler K. Affolter M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 745-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 46Torres-Vazquez J. Warrior R. Arora K. Dev. Biol. 2000; 227: 388-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, the Dpp response elements of vg, Ubx, and tin have been shown to be dependent on Mad binding sites for the ability to direct Dpp-dependent reporter expression (32Kim J. Johnson K. Chen H.J. Carroll S. Laughon A. Nature. 1997; 388: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 33Szuts D. Eresh S. Bienz M.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2354-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Together, these observations suggest that Dpp activates targets by two distinct mechanisms: 1) direct activation by Smads and 2) indirect activation by repression of brk. The Brk protein contains a potential homeodomain and is localized to the nucleus (43Campbell G. Tomlinson A. Cell. 1999; 96: 553-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), consistent with its functioning as a repressor. Brk antagonized BMP2 signaling when expressed ectopically in Xenopus embryos, suggesting that it may be a conserved feature of Dpp/BMP pathways (41Minami M. Kinoshita N. Kamoshida Y. Tanimoto H. Tabata T. Nature. 1999; 398: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Here, we report that Brk protein binds and represses the Dpp response elements of vg and Ubx. We show that a previously identified Mad site is actually a composite Mad·Brk site and show that Mad and Brk are capable of competing for binding to this site. These observations suggest an explanation for why the Mad binding site consensus differs from that of Smad3 and Smad4. In addition, we found that a Dpp response element from Ubx is more sensitive to Brk repression than an element from the vg quadrant enhancer. These results correlate with the respective short and long range thresholds of Ubx and vg and indicate that Brk binding sites may play an important role in setting thresholds for activation by Dpp. Our results concur with other recent reports that Brk functions as a DNA-binding repressor (47Sivasankaran R. Vigano M.A. Muller B. Affolter M. Basler K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6162-6172Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 48Zhang H.L. Levine M. Ashe H.L.

The base substitutions contained in the UbxM11 and UbxM13 probes are shown above images of band shift assays comparing these probes to the wild-type Ubx probe for binding of MBP·Brk (upper gel) or MBP·MadNL (lower gel). The indicated amounts of protein are per 50-μl binding reaction, and probe concentration is 10−11m. Both mutants reduced MBP·Brk binding affinity, whereas M13 had no effect on MBP·MadNL binding. Compared with wild-type and M13, binding of MBP·MadNL to M11 yielded a similar bound/free ratio at 300 ng of protein but greatly reduced ratios between 10 and 100 ng. The mechanism responsible for this apparently cooperative effect remains to be determined.

Effector plasmids for Mad and Med were a gift from R. Padgett (27Maduzia L.L. Padgett R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 595-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and were based on the metallothionine promoter vector pMK33. pPac-Brk was generated by cloning a 3.4-kb Brk cDNA (gift from C. Rushlow) between the BamHI and NotI sites of pPacPL. In addition to the Brk coding region, the resulting plasmid contains ∼500 bp of the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) and ∼800 bp of 3′-UTR. The pPacSu(H) and pPacNact plasmids were a gift from T. Wittkopp and S. Carroll. To create an MBP·Brk fusion protein, polymerase chain reaction was used to position an EcoRI site 3-bp upstream of the Brk initiator ATG. The resulting clone was used to create MBP·Brk by insertion between the EcoRI and HindII sites of pMAL2C. MBP·BrkHD was generated by deleting sequences between aPstI site 517-bp downstream from the Brk ATG and aHindII site at the 3′-end of the cDNA. Transfections ofDrosophila S2 cells were carried out as described previously (36Johnson K. Kirkpatrick H. Comer A. Hoffmann F.M. Laughon A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20709-20716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A chemiluminescent β-galactosidase assay was performed on cell extracts using the GalactoStar assay system (Tropix, Inc.) according to the supplier's instructions. For sets of transfections involving the use of cDNAs cloned into the pMK33 metallothionine promoter vector, CuSO4 was added to cultures 24 h after transfection to a final concentration of 0.3 mm. S.D. was calculated from the results of triplicate assays. MBP·Brk fusion proteins were expressed, affinity-purified using amylose-agarose, and used in band shift assays as previously described (36Johnson K. Kirkpatrick H. Comer A. Hoffmann F.M. Laughon A.

Purification of the MBP·BrkHD used for the band shift assay shown in Fig. 1 Cincluded an additional step of incubating affinity-immobilized protein with 5 μg/ml RNase A, 125 units/ml exonuclease III, and 12.5 units/ml DNase I for 1 h at room temperature as a means of reducing contaminating nucleic acid. Dpp activates expression of vg in cells of the Drosophila wing imaginal disc through the quadrant enhancer, which is located within the vg fourth intron (22Kim J. Sebring A. Esch J.J. Kraus M.E. Vorwerk K. Magee J. Carroll S.B. Nature. 1996; 382: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The quadrant enhancer contains two Mad binding sites, both of which contribute to Dpp-responsive expression (32Kim J. Johnson K. Chen H.J. Carroll S. Laughon A. Nature. 1997; 388: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 51Certel K. Hudson A. Carroll S.B. Johnson W.A. Development. 2000; 127: 3173-3183PubMed Google Scholar). Two copies of a 60-bp fragment containing these adjacent sites (referred to as 2×MD2) are sufficient to activate alacZ reporter in an essentially normal quadrant pattern. 2A. Hudson and S. Carroll, personal communication. It was previously shown that clones of homozygous mutantbrk −/brk − cells in wing imaginal discs of brk −/+ heterozygous larvae express vg ectopically when they occur outside the wing primordia (43Campbell G. Tomlinson A. Cell. 1999; 96: 553-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), demonstrating that brk normally preventsvg expression from extending to hinge and notum regions that surround the wing proper. Limitation of 2×MD2-lacZexpression to the wing primordia suggests that brk might repress through the MD2 element, although it is also possible that control is indirect by means of an intermediate wing-specific transcription factor such as Scalloped or Drifter (51Certel K. Hudson A. Carroll S.B. Johnson W.A. Development. 2000; 127: 3173-3183PubMed Google Scholar, 52Halder G. Polaczyk P. Kraus M.E. Hudson A. Kim J. Laughon A. Carroll S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3815-3820Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). To determine whether Brk represses the MD2 element, we cotransfectedDrosophila S2 cells with the 2×MD2-lacZ reporter and varying amounts of effector plasmids that express brk, Mad , Med, and an activated version of the type I Dpp receptor,thickveins (tkvQD) (Fig.1 A, left panel). Reporter expression was induced ∼4-fold by expression ofMad, Med, and tkVQD, and this was blocked by cotransfecting 10 ng of pPac-brk plasmid. Levels of pPac-brk up to 0.4 ng had no effect. This result shows that Brk is capable of repressing vg through a small Smad-responsive target element. Expression of vg throughout the wing primordia at a distance from the source of Dpp may reflect a relatively low sensitivity tobrk. In contrast, Ubx responds to Dpp in the visceral mesoderm only in those cells that actually expressDpp. We tested whether Brk contributes to this short range Dpp responsiveness of Ubx by determining whether Brk could repress the Ubx midgut enhancer element (53Thuringer F. Cohen S.M. Bienz M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2419-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) in S2 cells. AlacZ reporter driven by two copies of a 30-bp fragment from the Dpp response element of Ubx was co-transfected with combinations of effector plasmids expressing Mad + Med + tkvQD, or Brk (Fig. 1 A, right panel). The 2×Ubx-lacZ reporter behaved much like 2×MD2-lacZ in response to Mad + Med + tkvQD, but required only 0.08 ng of pPac-brk to be repressed. Thus, in this transient transfection system, theUbx element was about 100-fold more sensitive thanvg MD2 to repression by Brk. This result fits with the expectation that Brk affects target gene sensitivity to Dpp. Two bacterially produced Brk fusion proteins were generated and tested by means of the band shift assay for the ability to bind to DNA of the UbxDpp response element. MBP·Brk was a fusion of full-length Brk to the C terminus of maltose-binding protein, whereas MBP·BrkHD contained an amino-terminal fragment harboring a putative homeodomain (Fig.1 B). Both were prepared from bacterial lysates by affinity purification with amylose beads. Despite the inclusion of a protease inhibitor mixture during purification, fractionation on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel showed that the major protein in both preparations was a ∼52-kDa degradation product, with only minor amounts of the larger apparent primary products (data not shown). This 52-kDa size suggests that both fusion proteins were susceptible to cleavage just C-terminal to the putative homeodomain. Consistent with this interpretation, both preparations bound to the Ubx DNA probe (Fig.1 C; probe sequence given in Fig.2 A), whereas non-fused MBP lacked detectable binding activity (not shown). Approximately 4 ng of either preparation was sufficient to shift half of the Ubx probe. This corresponds to a dissociation constant of 10−9m, a value that is in the range commonly observed for homeodomain-DNA interactions (54Gehring W.J. Qian Y.Q. Billeter M. Furukubo-Tokunaga K. Schier A.F. Resendez-Perez D. Affolter M. Otting G. Wuthrich K. Cell. 1994; 78: 211-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Both Brk fusion protein preparations yielded multiple shifted bands, indicating that binding occurred at more than one site. In parallel, the MBP·BrkHD preparation was tested for binding to a vg probe comprising most of the MD2 element (Fig. 1 C, right panel; probe sequence given in Fig. 2 A). Forty ng of MBP·BrkHD was required to shift half of the vg probe, about ten times the amount needed to shift half the Ubx probe. As a second means of measuring the relative affinities of MBP·Brk for the Ubx and vgsequences, unlabeled preparations of the same Ubx andvg double-stranded oligos were used to compete for binding of labeled Ubx probe by a low concentration of MBP·Brk (Fig. 1 D). A 50% reduction in binding of probe was observed with a ∼10-fold excess of Ubx competitor or a ∼300-fold excess of vg competitor. Thus, as determined by either method, the low affinity of Brk for the vg probe relative to the Ubx probe correlates with the lower relative sensitivity of the vg MD2 element to repression by Brk in the transfected cell reporter assay. In contrast, a Mad fusion protein, MBP·MadNL (MH1 domain + linker), bound the Ubx andvg probes with approximately equal affinities (Fig.1 C, right panel). Together, these results suggest that differences in the Dpp response thresholds of Ubx andvg may be primarily a function of differential affinity for Brk rather than for Mad. Binding of MBP·Brk to the Ubx andvg probes generated multiple bands, possibly indicating that Brk bound to more than one site. The Ubx element contains an inverted repeat of GGCGCT (Fig. 2 A, solid arrows) that overlaps a previously identified Mad binding site (boxed). Whereas the Mad site embedded in this repeat resembles the vg Mad site, the repeat as a whole is only matched at 7 of 12 positions in vg. We tested MBP·Brk for the ability to bind one copy of this sequence in a DNA probe that was otherwise divergent in sequence from the Ubx element (Fig.2 A, left panel). MBP·Brk bound to the GGCGCT probe with affinity that was similar to its affinity for theUbx probe (Fig. 2 A, right panel) and yielded a single major shifted band at about the same position as the lower most band observed with the Ubx probe. Although two weak upper bands were also observed with the GGCGCT probe, overall, these results are consistent with high affinity interaction of MBP·Brk with just one site in the GGCGCT probe. To investigate the specificity of Brk for the GGCGCT sequence, the effects of single base pair substitutions were determined. This was done measuring the ability of unlabeled “wildtype” (GGCGCT) and mutant DNAs to compete with the labeled GGCGCT probe. Fig.2 B shows a gel comparing the ability of GGCGCT andAGCGCT (mutant M1) probes to compete away binding of MBP·Brk to labeled GGCGCT probe. Note that the M1 competitor was tested over a 10-fold higher concentration range than the GGCGCT competitor. Measurements of bound and free probe DNA from this gel and from parallel band shift assays using eight other mutant competitors were used to generate the binding curves shown in Fig. 2 C. The concentration of competitor resulting in an ordinate value of 0.5 provides a relative measure of affinity for the competitor DNA. The results are tabulated below the graph in Fig. 2 C. In all, five mutants exhibited an ∼20-fold reduction in the binding affinity, whereas the least critical position contributed as much as 3-fold to binding affinity. These results indicate that Brk makes base-specific contacts across the entire GGCGCT sequence. The GGCGCT repeat in the Ubx element overlaps a Mad binding site that can be modeled as consisting of two degenerate Smad boxes (Fig. 2 A), suggesting that Brk may compete with Mad for binding. This could not be determined unequivocally using theUbx probe because MBP·Mad and MBP·Brk complexes had nearly identical mobilities in the band shift assay. However, the GGCGCT probe formed a complex with MBP·Mad that was easily resolved from the main complex formed with MBP·Brk; with this probe, it was clear that formation of MBP·Brk complexes correlated with reduced binding of MBP·Mad (Fig. 3). In contrast, the same amount of MBP·Brk did not reduce binding of MBP·Mad to the M7 probe (Fig. 3), evidence that MBP·Brk reduced the level of MBP·Mad binding by competition rather than by sequence-independent inhibition. To determine whether the Brk binding sites identified using the band shift assay are actually required for repression, theUbx element was mutated to disrupt Brk binding. Each of three GGCG(C/T) sequences was changed to GTCG or to GGCGA (Fig.4 A, top), both of which dramatically reduce Brk binding but still allow Mad to bind (Fig.4 A, bottom panels). Introduction of the same triple-substitutions into the 2×Ubx-lacZ reporter resulted in an ∼100-fold decrease in sensitivity to repression by cotransfected pPac-Brk (Fig. 4 B, compare 0.08 ng of pPac-Brk in top panel with 10 ng in lower two panels). These results demonstrate that Brk binding sites are required for repression and confirm that the sequence specificity characterized in band shift experiments is also observed in cells. The overlap of Mad and Brk binding sites in the Ubx midgut element suggests that Brk might repress Dpp targets by simply competing with Mad for occupancy of an enhancer element. However, repressors generally function by quenching the activating potential of transcription factors bound nearby or by means of long range interfering effects on the general transcription machinery (55Mannervik M. Nibu Y. Zhang H. Levine M. Science. 1999; 284: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). To determine whether Brk is capable of functioning as an active repressor, we positioned Brk binding sites adjacent to sites for the unrelated Notch-responsive activator, Suppressor of Hairless [Su(H)] and monitored reporter expression in response to cotransfected Brk, Su(H), and activated Notch effector plasmids (Fig. 5). Brk completely prevented activation by Su(H), whereas a control reporter containing only Su(H) sites was repressed only 2–4-fold, an effect that may have been caused by the presence of a single Brk binding site adjacent to the hsp70 TATA box. Given this ability of Brk to function as a generic active repressor, it is reasonable to speculate that Brk might control a subset of Dpp targets without direct involvement of Mad. We have shown that Brk acts on two Dpp targets by binding to functional Mad sites. Mutational analysis indicates that Brk and Mad compete for binding to overlapping sites, but that the sequence specificity of Brk is distinct from that of Smads. Thus we were able to identify mutations that disrupt Brk repression of Ubx with little effect on activation by Mad. This is consistent with the results of previous experiments that demonstrated that Mad sites were required for activation of several Dpp targets (32Kim J. Johnson K. Chen H.J. Carroll S. Laughon A. Nature. 1997; 388: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 33Szuts D. Eresh S. Bienz M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2022-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 34Xu X. Yin Z. Hudson J.B. Ferguson E.L. Frasch M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2354-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The overlap of Brk sites may explain why the Mad binding site consensus differs from the consensus identified for Smad3 and Smad4 (Fig.6). The Mad consensus aligns perfectly with an inverted pair of GGCGCT Brk binding sites, as they occur in theUbx element (Fig. 6). It is also apparent that the Mad consensus can be modeled as a pair of degenerate Smad boxes that align with a pair of Smad boxes arranged as AGAC GTCT, an orientation that is inverted in comparison to the Smad3-Smad4 consensus, GTCT AGAC. These alignments suggest that the Mad consensus reflects dual utilization by Brk and Mad-Med complexes. Whereas Mad-Med complexes also recognize the Smad3/Smad4 consensus, Brk does not. 3A. Laughon, unpublished results. In contrast, competition of Mad and Brk for binding to GCCGNCGC-type sites places targets under the control of both positive and negative branches of the Dpp pathway. Such dual control may be important in generating target response thresholds that span a wide range of Dpp levels. Smad1 activation of the human Smad6 promoter through a Mad-like binding site (37Ishida W. Hamamoto T. Kusanagi K. Yagi K. Kawabata M. Takehara K. Sampath T.K. Kato M. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6075-6079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) suggests that a vertebrate Brk homolog might compete with Smad1, Smad5, or Smad8 for regulation of certain BMP targets. How can the requirement for Mad binding sites in certain Dpp targets be reconciled with experiments showing that Dpp targets, includingvg, become independent of Dpp signaling in cells lacking functional brk? If Brk alone acts on such sites, mutations that disrupt Brk binding should result in elevated or ectopic expression rather than reduction. The conclusion that Mad acts on such Dpp targets only indirectly through Brk is based on the assumption that Dpp signaling is blocked completely in brk −/−cells that are also mutant for tkv 7 orMad 1.2 (41Minami M. Kinoshita N. Kamoshida Y. Tanimoto H. Tabata T. Nature. 1999; 398: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 42Jazwinska A. Kirov N. Wieschaus E. Roth S. Rushlow C.

Cell. 1999; 96: 553-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). However, the type I Dpp receptor encoded by saxophone, while normally insufficient in the absence of tkv, provides a low level of signaling in response to Dpp (56Haerry T. Ongkar K. O'Connor M. Wharton K. Development. 1998; 125: 397-3987Google Scholar) that may become adequate when target response thresholds are reduced by the absence of Brk. Similarly, whereas the hypomorphic activity of the Mad 1.2 allele is normally inadequate, it may suffice in the absence of Brk. Thus, a low level of Dpp signaling could still be required even without Brk. Whereas convergent target specificity intertwines Brk and Mad function, as an active repressor, Brk is also capable of functioning independently of Mad. Thus whereas Dpp targets are subject to competition between Mad and Brk, others may respond to Mad and Med only indirectly through their cascading affects on the expression ofbrk. The Dpp response elements of such genes may contain Brk binding sites arranged in a way that precludes binding by Mad/Med complexes, or such elements may simply lack nearby binding sites for Mad/Med cofactors.

https://openalex.org/W1978874183,"The type 37 capsule of Streptococcus pneumoniae is a homopolysaccharide built up from repeating units of [β-d-Glcp-(1→2)]-β-d-Glcp-(1→3). The elements governing the expression of the tts gene, coding for the glucosyltransferase involved in the synthesis of the type 37 pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide, have been studied. Primer extension analysis and functional tests demonstrated the presence of four new transcriptional start points upstream of the previously reported tts promoter (ttsp). Most interesting, three of these transcriptional start points are located in a RUP element thought to be involved in recombinational events (Oggioni, M. R., and Claverys, J. P. (1999) Microbiology145, 2647–2653). Transformation experiments using either a recombinant plasmid containing the whole transcriptional unit of tts or chromosomal DNA from a type 37 pneumococcus showed that ttsis the only gene required to drive the biosynthesis of a type 37 capsule in S. pneumoniae and other Gram-positive bacteria, namely Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus gordonii, andBacillus subtilis. The Tts synthase was overproduced inS. pneumoniae and purified as a membrane-associated enzyme. These membrane preparations used UDP-Glc as substrate to catalyze the synthesis of a high molecular weight polysaccharide immunologically identical to the type 37 capsule. In addition, UDP-Gal was also a substrate to produce type 37 polysaccharide since a strong UDP-Glc-4′-epimerase activity is associated to the membrane fraction ofS. pneumoniae. These results indicated that Tts has a dual biochemical activity that leads to the synthesis of the branched type 37 polysaccharide. The type 37 capsule of Streptococcus pneumoniae is a homopolysaccharide built up from repeating units of [β-d-Glcp-(1→2)]-β-d-Glcp-(1→3). The elements governing the expression of the tts gene, coding for the glucosyltransferase involved in the synthesis of the type 37 pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide, have been studied. Primer extension analysis and functional tests demonstrated the presence of four new transcriptional start points upstream of the previously reported tts promoter (ttsp). Most interesting, three of these transcriptional start points are located in a RUP element thought to be involved in recombinational events (Oggioni, M. R., and Claverys, J. P. (1999) Microbiology145, 2647–2653). Transformation experiments using either a recombinant plasmid containing the whole transcriptional unit of tts or chromosomal DNA from a type 37 pneumococcus showed that ttsis the only gene required to drive the biosynthesis of a type 37 capsule in S. pneumoniae and other Gram-positive bacteria, namely Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus gordonii, andBacillus subtilis. The Tts synthase was overproduced inS. pneumoniae and purified as a membrane-associated enzyme. These membrane preparations used UDP-Glc as substrate to catalyze the synthesis of a high molecular weight polysaccharide immunologically identical to the type 37 capsule. In addition, UDP-Gal was also a substrate to produce type 37 polysaccharide since a strong UDP-Glc-4′-epimerase activity is associated to the membrane fraction ofS. pneumoniae. These results indicated that Tts has a dual biochemical activity that leads to the synthesis of the branched type 37 polysaccharide.

The capsular polysaccharide has been identified as the main virulence factor of S. pneumoniae (1Griffith F. J. Hyg. 1928; 27: 113-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). The capsule confers to pneumococcus the advantage to resist phagocytosis and survive in the host. Pneumococcus has evolved by diversifying its capsule, and up to 90 different capsular types synthesizing polysaccharides with different immunological properties and chemical structures have been described (2Henrichsen J. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1995; 33: 2759-2762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis in S. pneumoniaeis usually driven by genes located in the cap/cpslocus, and the capsular cluster of 13 pneumococcal types has been sequenced recently (3Garcı́a E. Llull D. Muñoz R. Mollerach M. López R. Res. Microbiol. 2000; 151: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In remarkable contrast, only a single gene (tts) located far apart from the cap cluster, directs the synthesis of the type 37 capsule (4Llull D. Muñoz R. López R. Garcı́a E. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Type 37 capsular polysaccharide is the only homopolysaccharide reported in pneumococcus. Clinical isolates belonging to this serotype synthesize a conspicuous capsular envelope that is a branched polysaccharide that has a linear backbone of →3)-β-d-Glcp-(1→ repeating units with monosaccharide side chains of a β-d-Glc-(1→ linked to C2 of each Glc residue (sophorosyl subunits) (5Adeyeye A. Jansson P.-E. Lindberg B. Henrichsen J. Carbohydr. Res. 1988; 180: 295-299Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Several experimental approaches demonstrated that tts is the only gene required for the synthesis of the type 37-specific capsular polysaccharide in S. pneumoniae. The tts gene encodes a putative glycosyltransferase (Tts) that exhibits significant sequence similarities with cellulose synthases of bacteria and higher plants and other β-glycosyltransferases (4Llull D. Muñoz R. López R. Garcı́a E. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Only few gene products involved in pneumococcal capsular formation have been biochemically characterized, and almost nothing is known about mechanisms as important as regulation, transport, and assembly of the polysaccharide chain subunits (3Garcı́a E. Llull D. Muñoz R. Mollerach M. López R. Res. Microbiol. 2000; 151: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It is generally thought that these polysaccharides are synthesized via lipid-linked repeat unit intermediates because of the biochemical complexity of the repeating oligosaccharide subunit. In types 14 and 19F, the first step of this process involves the activity of the protein coded bycps14(cps19f)E gene (6Guidolin A. Morona J.K. Morona R. Hansman D. Paton J.C. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5385-5396Crossref Google Scholar, 7Kolkman M.A. Morrison D.A. Van Der Zeijst B.A. Nuijten P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3736-3741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This protein catalyzes the selective incorporation of Glc from UDP-Glc to a membrane lipid-linked acceptor leading to the formation of a complex where other glycosyltransferases would transfer the sugars present in the polysaccharide repeating subunit (7Kolkman M.A. Morrison D.A. Van Der Zeijst B.A. Nuijten P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3736-3741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in type 3 pneumococci, sugars are transferred directly to the growing polysaccharide chain without intervention of an anchoring lipid molecule. We have demonstrated that Cap3B, the type 3 polysaccharide synthase, is the only protein required to synthesize high molecular weight type 3 capsular polysaccharide in S. pneumoniae orEscherichia coli strains provided that UDP-Glc and UDP-GlcUA, the precursors of type 3 capsular monosaccharides, were available (8Arrecubieta C. López R. Garcı́a E. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that Cap3B (also designated as Cps3S) is a processive enzyme able to transfer alternated residues of Glc and GlcUA from their respective UDP-sugars to the nonreducing end of the nascent polysaccharide chain (9Cartee R.T. Forsee W.T. Schutzbach J.S. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3907-3914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Cap3B possesses a double β-1,3- and β-1,4-glycosyltransferase activity in contrast to the other glycosyltransferases characterized so far among the enzymes implicated in synthesis of the pneumococcal capsule that only catalyze the transfer of a single glycosyl residue (8Arrecubieta C. López R. Garcı́a E. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence showing that this property is not so unusual as envisaged previously. Thus, the family of bacterial hyaluronan synthases (HAS)1 like those ofStreptococcus pyogenes (10DeAngelis P.L. Weigel P.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9033-9039Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), Streptococcus equisimilis (11Kumari K. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32539-32546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), or Pasteurella multocida (12Jing W. DeAngelis P.L. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and the KfiC enzyme of E. coli responsible for the synthesis of the E. coli K5 capsule (13Griffiths G. Cook N.J. Gottfridson E. Lind T. Lidholt K. Roberts I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11752-11757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), also provide examples of a dual enzymatic activity. It should be noted, however, that this enzymatic activity has only been demonstrated for enzymes that catalyze the formation of linear polysaccharides, whereas type 37 polysaccharide is a branched polymer. We report here the subcellular localization and biochemical characterization of the type 37 synthase in S. pneumoniaestrains expressing the tts gene. We also show the ability of Tts to produce a type 37-specific capsule even when expressed in Gram-positive bacteria other than pneumococcus. The unencapsulated laboratory S. pneumoniae strains used are as follows: M24 (S3−) (14Garcı́a E. Garcı́a P. López R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 239: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and M31 (ΔlytA) (S2−) (15Sánchez-Puelles J.M. Ronda C. Garcı́a J.L. Garcı́a P. López R. Garcı́a E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 158: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The type 37 clinical isolate 1235/89, kindly provided by A. Fenoll (Spanish Pneumococcal Reference Laboratory, Majadahonda, Spain), and the type 37 laboratory transformants DN2 and DN5 have been described previously (4Llull D. Muñoz R. López R. Garcı́a E. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Strain C2 is a type 37 lincomycin-resistant (LnR) transformant of the pneumococcal strain M24 in which the tts gene is genetically linked to the ermC gene (4Llull D. Muñoz R. López R. Garcı́a E. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Growth and transformation of laboratory strains of S. pneumoniae have been described previously (16Mollerach M. López R. Garcı́a E. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2047-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Methods for transformation of Streptococcus oralisNCTC 11427 (type strain) (17Ronda C. Garcı́a J.L. López R.

Bacteriol. 1975; 121: 296-304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have also been described elsewhere. Clones obtained by transformation with derivatives of pLSE1 (tet ermC) (17Ronda C. Garcı́a J.L. López R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1988; 215: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) were scored on blood agar plates containing 0.7 μg of Ln/ml (for S. pneumoniaeand S. oralis), on brain-heart infusion agar plates (Difco) supplemented with 10 μg of erythromycin (Ery)/ml (for S. gordonii), or on LB agar plates containing 5 μg of Ery/ml (forB. subtilis). Plasmid pLSE4 is a promoter-probe vector that contains a promoterless lytA gene (21Dı́az E. Garcı́a J.L. Gene ( Amst. ). 1990; 90: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Plasmid pDLP36 (4Llull D. Muñoz R. López R. Garcı́a E. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) is a pLSE4 derivative expressing the S. pneumoniae LytA autolytic amidase under the control of the ttsp promoter of the tts gene. DNA manipulations and other standard methods were as described in Sambrooket al. (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Primer extension mapping of the transcription initiation site (4Llull D. Muñoz R. López R. Garcı́a E. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and polymerase chain reaction amplifications (23Llull D. López R. Garcı́a E. Muñoz R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1443: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) were carried out as described previously. Conditions for amplification were chosen according to the G + C content of the corresponding oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotide primers mentioned in the text are as follows: (D101) 5′-TTTGACCAAGCTTACACTTCAG-3′; (D112) 5′-TCTCATATTCTAgaCTTCTTTTCAGTTTACAC-3′; (D116) 5′-TCCTTACCATACaTCgATACTAAC-3′; and (D138) 5′-TCAATCTAACATCGTTGCTTCCAC-3′. Lowercase letters indicate nucleotides introduced to construct appropriate restriction sites; these are shown underlined (see Fig. 1 A). To construct pDLP50, chromosomal DNA prepared from the 1235/89 strain was polymerase chain reaction-amplified with oligonucleotide primers D101 and D112 and made blunt-ended with the Klenow fragment of theE. coli DNA polymerase I (PolIk). Subsequently, the DNA fragment was digested with XbaI and ligated to pLSE4 that had previously been digested with SphI, filled in with PolIk, and then treated with XbaI. The ligation mixture was used to transform S. pneumoniae M31, and a clone harboring pDLP50 was isolated by scoring the LnR transformants for expression of the lytA gene by using a filter technique described previously (24Garcı́a E. Ronda C. Garcı́a J.L. López R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1985; 29: 77-81Crossref Google Scholar). Plasmids pDLP48 and pDLP49 were constructed as follows: 1235/89 DNA was polymerase chain reaction-amplified with oligonucleotide primers D101 and D116, and the product was digested with either SphI (for pDLP48) or SacI (for pDLP49) and filled in with PolIk. After digestion with ClaI (restriction enzyme target included in the primer D116), the appropriate fragments were ligated to pLSE1 (previously digested withEcoRV and MspI) and used to transform competent M24 cells. Type 37-encapsulated transformants were scored among the LnR clones, and one clone of each class, i.e., harboring either pDLP48 or pDLP49, was selected. Exponentially growing cultures (1 liter) of S. pneumoniae M24 harboring pLSE1 or pDLP49 were chilled on ice and centrifuged (12,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), and the pellet was suspended in 10 ml of TMCa buffer (70 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.0, 9 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2) containing 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and centrifuged again (10,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). The bacteria, resuspended in the same buffer, were disrupted by two passages of the suspension through a French pressure cell (Aminco). The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 ×g at 4 °C for 15 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged again at 120,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. The pelleted membranes were homogenized in 2 ml of TMCa buffer containing 0.2 mm PMSF, distributed in 100-μl aliquots, and stored at −80 °C. Under these conditions, enzyme activity remained virtually unaltered for up to 1 month. Determination of protein concentration was carried out as described previously (25Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217487) Google Scholar). Analysis of the membrane fraction for detection of Tts was carried out by 10‥ SDS-PAGE (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207516) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, standard reaction mixtures contained 0.5 mg/ml membrane proteins, 30 μm (0.1 μCi) UDP-[14C]Glc (specific activity 319 mCi/mmol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a 70 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, buffer containing 9 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, and 50 mm NaCl in a total volume of 100 μl. The reactions, carried out at 30 °C for 15 min, were terminated by the addition of SDS (0.5‥ final concentration) and were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Afterwards, bovine serum albumin (Sigma) at a final concentration of 0.4‥ and 1 ml of 10‥ trichloroacetic acid were added. After incubation for 30 min at 0 °C, the mixtures were passed through Whatman GF/A filters and extensively washed with 10‥ trichloroacetic acid. The filters were dried (65 °C, 20 min) and counted in a 1219 Rackbeta scintillation counter (LKB Wallack). One unit of Tts activity is expressed as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the incorporation into a macromolecular product of 1 pmol of Glc/mg of protein/min. The total volume of a standard reaction mixture carried out as described above was treated with SDS and filtered through a Sepharose CL-4B column (20 × 1.5 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The products of the reaction were eluted with 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl; 0.5-ml fractions were collected, and alternate fractions were counted. The high molecular weight fractions that eluted atV 0 were pooled, dialyzed into water, lyophilized, dissolved in 2.5 m trifluoroacetic acid, and subjected to hydrolysis for 2.5 h at 120 °C. Then the samples were analyzed by HPLC as indicated below or subjected to thin layer chromatography (TLC) after being repeatedly dissolved and lyophilized. The dried pellet was dissolved in 40‥ 2-propanol containing 5 mg/ml unlabeled carrier Glc and Gal. TLC was carried out on HPTLC silica gel 60 plates (Merck), impregnated with phosphate, and activated as described by Hansen (27Hansen S.A. J. Chromatogr. 1975; 107: 224-226Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar) but using the solvent system 2-propanol, acetone, 0.1 m formic acid (2:2:1) (28Roy A.B. Harwood J.L. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 185-187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To visualize unlabeled sugar standards, the TLC plate was sprayed with 5‥ H2SO4 in ethanol and heated to 100 °C for 10–30 min. The regions that contain the unlabeled sugar standards were scraped, added to water, and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. The radioactive fractions containing the unincorporated sugar nucleotide precursors that eluted at V T were treated with 10 mm HCl at 100 °C for 10 min and neutralized with NaOH. Both excluded and retained fractions were then analyzed by HPLC by using an Aminex HPX-87H column (300 × 7.8 mm; Bio-Rad) and eluted at 30 °C with 125 μmH2SO4 at 0.25 or 0.4 ml/min (see below). The elution of authentic samples of Glc and Gal was monitored with an in-line 132 refractive index detector (Gilson). Type antisera purchased from the Statens Seruminstitut (Denmark) were used for immunological analyses. As a potential competitor in immunoprecipitation assays, we used curdlan, a linear (1→3)-β-d-glucan fromAlcaligenes faecalis (Sigma). This polysaccharide was suspended in water (10 mg/ml) with a glass homogenizer and centrifuged (12,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), and the insoluble pellet was discarded. The sugar content of the solution was determined by using the anthrone reagent (29Herbert D. Phipps P.J. Strange R.E. Methods Microbiol. 1971; 5: 209-344Crossref Scopus (1478) Google Scholar). Typing by the capsular reaction (Quellung) was kindly carried out by L. Vicioso (Spanish Pneumococcal Reference Laboratory, Majadahonda, Spain). The standard assay conditions for the pneumococcal LytA amidase and the preparation of [3H]choline-labeled pneumococcal cell walls have been described elsewhere (21Dı́az E. Garcı́a J.L. Gene ( Amst. ). 1990; 90: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). One unit of LytA amidase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the hydrolysis (solubilization) of 1 μg of pneumococcal cell wall material in 10 min. We have reported previously the identification of the tts promoter and its transcription start point (4Llull D. Muñoz R. López R. Garcı́a E. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The ttsp promoter contains a −10 consensus sequence with an extended TtTG motif characteristic of the −16 region of S. pneumoniae (30Sabelnikov A.G. Greenberg B. Lacks S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 144-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and transcription initiates 9 nucleotides after the −10 consensus sequence (4Llull D. Muñoz R. López R. Garcı́a E. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, we have now observed that unencapsulated pneumococcal cells transformed with a recombinant plasmid (pDLP49) containing the region upstream ofttsp formed colonies noticeably more mucous than those from cells transformed with pDLP48, an equivalent plasmid that only containsttsp and the structural tts gene. To determine the promoter strength of both constructs, we compared the cell wall lytic activity (see “Experimental Procedures”) expressed in a pneumococcal ΔlytA strain (M31) transformed either with pDLP36 (4Llull D. Muñoz R. López R. Garcı́a E. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A), which contains the reporter lytA gene under the control of ttsp, or with pDLP50, a construct that also includes the upstream region ofttsp (Fig. 1 A). Sonicated cell extracts prepared from M31 [pDLP50] showed 6 times more LytA activity than those from M31 [pDLP36] (Fig. 1 B). In addition, M31 [pDLP50] exhibited a faster autolysis at the end of exponential phase of growth than M31 [pDLP36] (Fig. 1 C). Furthermore, primer extension analysis using total RNA extracted from M31 [pDLP50] revealed the presence of at least four additional transcription start points upstream of ttsp (Fig. 2). Interestingly, three of them lie in a RUP element present in this position in the clinical type 37 strains (4Llull D. Muñoz R. López R. Garcı́a E. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (Fig.3). RUP elements are thought to be insertion sequence derivatives that facilitate recombinational events (31Oggioni M.R. Claverys J.P. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 2647-2653Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), but a promoter activity had never been described in these elements.Figure 3Localization of transcription start points of the tts gene. The sequence corresponds to a fragment of the upstream region of the tts gene (4Llull D. Muñoz R. López R. Garcı́a E. J. Exp.

LnR (or EryR) transformants were isolated, and selected colonies were grown in broth to test for the production of type 37 capsule. In every case, expression of tts led to agglutination of the bacterial cells when incubated in the presence of type 37-specific antiserum (Fig. 4). Immunoagglutination never occurred either when the same strains were incubated with non-type 37 antiserum or when the recipient strains harbored the vector plasmid pLSE1 and received anti-type 37 serum. These results demonstrated that only tts is required for the synthesis of a type 37 capsular polysaccharide in several Gram-positive species. Furthermore, the above immunoagglutination test using whole cells indicated that the capsular material is, at least in part, linked to the outer bacterial surface. To determine whether a single copy of the tts gene was also sufficient to direct capsule formation in a heterologous host, we transformed competent cells of S. oralis with chromosomal DNA from the pneumococcal strain C2, a type 37 transformant carrying a single tts copy linked to the ermC resistance marker. S. oralis LnR transformants agglutinated in the presence of type 37-specific antiserum (Fig. 4 I) demonstrated that it was possible to transfer tts to this related species and that its presence in a single copy also leads to the production of detectable amounts of a capsular polysaccharide immunologically indistinguishable from the pneumococcal type 37 strains. To prepare a homologous system for biochemical assays, we used the type 37 pneumococcal strain M24 [pDLP49] described above. Subcellular fractions of M24 [pDLP49] were tested for incorporation of radioactivity into a macromolecular product by using UDP-[14C]Glc, assuming that UDP-Glc was the natural substrate for Tts. The membrane fraction turned out to incorporate the label, whereas the soluble fraction did not (data not shown). SDS-PAGE analysis of a membrane preparation from M24 [pDLP49] revealed the presence of an overproduced protein with a molecular mass of ∼50 kDa (Fig. 5). This protein was absent in membranes prepared from M24 [pLSE1], a strain harboring only the vector plasmid. Another protein band migrating faster than that of Tts could also be occasionally observed, and it might have been originated by proteolysis of Tts, although PMSF was used during the preparation of the membrane fraction. Membranes of the pneumococcal M24 [pDLP49] strain were used to evaluate the incorporation of [14C]Glc from its precursor UDP-[14C]Glc into a macromolecular product using different experimental conditions. Membranes prepared from S. pneumoniae M24 [pLSE1] cells were employed as a negative control. Tts activity was stimulated in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2 or MnCl2. Moreover, 10 mm EDTA completely inhibited the reaction (TableI). However, Ca2+ ions stimulated only slightly Tts activity when added at low concentration (1 mm) in the absence of Mg2+ (data not shown). Furthermore, EGTA only produced a small inhibition of the reaction (Table I). Globally, this behavior is similar to that already described for several glycosyltransferases like cellulose synthases, HAS, or the pneumococcal type 3-specific synthase. In addition, 50 mmNaCl increased 2-fold the incorporation of [14C]Glc into a macromolecular product (data not shown). Other important properties of Tts are reported in the composite Fig.6. The Tts synthase exhibited a noticeable pH dependence, and the optimal activity was achieved between 6.8 and 7.5 (Fig. 6 A).

It is not known whether the direct activation of Glu-Pg by Pg activators is promoted on the cell surface or whether plasminolytic conversion of Glu-Pg to the more readily activated Lys-Pg is necessary for enhanced Pm formation on the cell surface. To distinguish between these potential mechanisms, we tested whether Pm formation on the cell surface could be stimulated in the absence of conversion of Glu-Pg to Lys-Pg. Rates of activation of Glu-Pg, Lys-Pg, and a mutant Glu-Pg, [D646E]Glu-Pg, by either tissue Pg activator (t-PA) or urokinase (u-PA) were compared when these Pg forms were either bound to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) or in solution.

Although the extent of activation of Lys-Pg on cells was similar to that of Glu-Pg, the cells afforded minimal enhancement of Lys-Pg activation compared with the solution phase (1.3-fold). Similar results were obtained when u-PA was used as activator. When Glu-Pg was bound to the cell in the presence of either t-PA or u-PA, conversion to Lys-Pg was observed, but conversion of ([D646E]Glu-Pg to ([D646E]Lys-Pg was not detected, consistent with the conversion of Glu-Pg to Lys-Pg being necessary for optimal enhancement of Pg activation on cell surfaces. Furthermore, we found that conversion of [D646E]Glu-Pg to [D646E]Lys-Pg by exogenous Pm was markedly enhanced (∼20-fold) on the HUVEC surface, suggesting that the stimulation of the conversion of Glu-Pg to Lys-Pg is a key mechanism by which cells enhance Pg activation.

This results in arming cell surfaces with the proteolytic activity of Pm. In the case of endothelial cells, Pm becomes localized to sites of thrombus formation and, in the case of leukocytes, the cells become armed with proteolytic activity required for processes in which cells degrade extracellular matrices to migrate. However, a key component of the mechanism of stimulation of Pg activation on the cell surface is not understood. It is not known whether: 1) direct activation of Glu-Pg by Pg activators is promoted on the cell surface or 2) plasminolytic conversion of Glu-Pg to Lys-Pg is necessary to observe enhanced Pm formation on the cell surface.

In the first mechanism, Glu-Pg remains uncleaved, yet its direct activation is promoted on the cell surface relative to the solution phase, perhaps through conformational changes induced in the molecule upon its interaction with the cell surface. In the second mechanism, conversion of Glu-Pg by Pm to yield the more readily activated Lys-Pg is necessary, leading to increased Pm production on the cell surface. Furthermore, it is not known whether localization of Glu-Pg on the cell surface enhances its conversion to Lys-Pg by Pm. This question has been addressed also in the current study.

In these earlier studies, cell-associated Glu-Pg was converted to Lys-Pg (∼50–60% conversion) on the surfaces of both U937 monocytoid cells (5Ellis V. Behrendt N. Dano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12752-12758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and HUVEC (18Hajjar K.A. Nachman R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 1769-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) in the absence of added Pg activators or Pm. Thus, it was not possible to distinguish whether the direct activation of Glu-Pg was enhanced on the cell surface compared with the reaction in solution. In contrast, in our studies, Glu-Pg remained in its native form, without conversion to Lys-Pg when bound to HUVEC. This enabled us to address the role of conversion of Glu-Pg to Lys-Pg in enhancement of activation on the cell surface. In the current investigation, we employed a Pg recombinant variant, [D646E]Glu-Pg, to assess the requirement for conversion of Glu-Pg to Lys-Pg on the cell surface for stimulation of Pg activation. This recombinant Pg/Pm variant can be converted to the molecular form of Pm, but does not possess Pm activity because of the absence of the necessary Asp residue in the serine proteolytic catalytic triad (19Grella D.K. Castellino F.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 1585-1589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, [D646E]Glu-Pg is not converted to [D646E]Lys-Pg following its cleavage by Pg activators. [D646E]Glu-Pg was used as the inactive mutant to be as conservative as possible in introducing an amino acid substitution into the active site triad. The rates of activation of Glu-Pg, Lys-Pg, and [D646E]Glu-Pg by either t-PA or u-PA were compared when these forms were either bound to HUVEC or in solution. These experiments were designed to distinguish between two potential mechanisms by which Pm formation is enhanced on the cell surface compared with the soluble phase: 1) direct activation of Glu-Pg forms by Pg activators is promoted on the cell surface compared with the reaction in solution, or 2) plasminolytic cleavage is necessary for stimulation of Glu-Pg activation on the cell surface. Furthermore, we examined whether conversion of [D646E]Glu-Pg to [D646E]Lys-Pg by exogenous Pm was enhanced on the HUVEC surface. Glu-Pg was purified from fresh human blood collected into 3 mm benzamidine, 3 mm EDTA, 100 units/ml Trasylol (Pentex Miles, Inc., Kankakee, IL), and 100 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). The plasma was subjected to affinity chromatography on lysine-Sepharose (20Deutsch D.G. Mertz E.T. Science. 1970; 170: 1995-1996Crossref Scopus (1670) Google Scholar) in phosphate-buffered saline (0.01 m sodium phosphate pH 7.3, 0.15 m NaCl) with 1 mm benzamidine, 0.02% NaN3, and 3 mm EDTA, followed by molecular exclusion chromatography on Biogel A 1.5 m (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The Pg concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 16.8. Lys-Pg was from the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (Holly Hill, Hampstead, London). The Lys-Pm control was prepared by incubating Lys-Pg with 10 nm high molecular weight (hmw) u-PA. (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) for 30 min at 37 °C. Pm was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech/Chromogenix (Uppsala, Sweden). [D646E]Glu-Pg was generated by primer-directed mutagenesis of single-stranded p119/HPg (21Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar) as previously described (22Menhart N. Hoover G.J. McCance S.G. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1482-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and expressed in baculovirus-infected lepidopteran cells, followed by purification on lysine-Sepharose as described (20Deutsch D.G. Mertz E.T. Science. 1970; 170: 1995-1996Crossref Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). The characteristics of this mutant have been described (19Grella D.K. Castellino F.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 1585-1589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pg forms were radiolabeled using a modified chloramine T procedure as described (1Miles L.A. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4303-4311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). t-PA was from Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). Low molecular weight (lmw) u-PA was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). HUVEC were purchased from Clonetics/BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD) and cells of passage four and below were used in these experiments. HUVEC were grown to confluence in MCDB 131 medium containing 2% fetal calf serum, 12 μg/ml bovine brain extract, 50 ng/ml amphotericin B, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 1 ng/ml human epidermal growth factor. The binding of radiolabeled Pg forms to HUVEC was performed as previously described from our laboratory (23Miles L.A. Levin E.G. Plescia J. Collen D. Plow E.F. Blood. 1988; 72: 628-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, HUVEC, grown to confluence in 24-well culture dishes (6–8 × 104cells/cm2), were washed three times with HBSS. The radiolabeled Pg forms were incubated with the cells in a final total volume of 200 μl at a final concentration of 25 nm. Reactions were terminated by aspirating the fluid from the wells and rapidly washing the cultures twice with HBSS-BSA. The cell-bound radioactivity was extracted with 100 μl of reduced sample buffer (31.2 mm TrisHCl, pH 7.2, 2% SDS, 10% sucrose, 0.002% bromphenol blue, 15 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmEDTA, 10 mm benzamidine, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma), 0.02% Na azide, 5 units/ml Trasylol (Miles, Inc., Kankakee, IL)). Greater than 90% of the cell-associated ligand was eluted by this procedure as assessed by comparing counts bound to the cells prior to elution, with counts eluted. Samples were subjected to 7% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions that distinguish two-chain Pm from the single chain Pg and were exposed to Biomax MR film. The autoradiograms were scanned on an Alpha ImagerTM 2000. To monitor the activation of125I-Glu-Pg, 125I-[D 646E]Glu-Pg and125I-Lys-Pg by t-PA, SDS-PAGE was employed because kinetic assays could not be performed on [D646E]Glu-Pg because its Pm form is proteolytically inactive. We found that in the absence of added t-PA, >95% of the added 125I-Glu-Pg and125I-[D646E]Glu-Pg remained in their Glu-Pg forms, and Pg activation was not detected on these cells (Fig.1). Activation of the three ligands by 20 nm t-PA was compared on HUVEC with the reaction in the solution phase, in the absence of cells. The cell-bound ligand was recovered and subjected to 7% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, which distinguish native Glu-Pg from Lys-Pg and distinguish the heavy chains of Glu- and Lys-Pm (Fig. 1). Greater than 90% of the cell-bound ligand was recovered by the elution procedure. The percent Pm formation was calculated by dividing the sum of the densities of the Glu-Pm heavy chain and Lys-Pm heavy chain bands by the sum of the densities of the Glu-Pg and Lys-Pg bands and the Glu-Pm and Lys-Pm heavy chain bands. (The light chain of Pm does not incorporate 125I in proportion to the heavy chain and was not used in the calculation of 100% cell-associated ligand). The activation of125I-Glu-Pg was enhanced ∼13-fold at 10 min compared with the reaction in the solution phase (Fig. 1, panel A and Fig.2). (Enhancement was observed at later time points, also, but the extent of enhancement was limited because the percent Pm formation that could be attained was finite.) The predominant form of the Pm heavy chain corresponded to the Lys-Pm heavy chain consistent with production of Pm activity (Fig. 1, panel A). Both Glu-Pg and Lys-Pg were present on the cell surface following t-PA activation, although Lys-Pg formation was not detected when the reaction was carried out in solution. Lys-Pg accounted for 27% of the total counts in cell-bound Pg at 10 min and 40% of the total counts in cell-bound Pg at 20 min. A similar distribution of Glu-Pg and Lys-Pg was observed also at 60 min and at 120 min.Figure 2Comparison of cleavage of Pg forms by t-PA on HUVEC and in solution. The autoradiograms in Fig. 1 were scanned. The percent Pm formation was calculated by dividing the sum of the densities of the Glu-Pm heavy chain and Lys-Pm heavy chain bands by the sum of the densities of the Glu-Pg and Lys-Pg bands and the Glu-Pm and Lys-Pm heavy chain bands. The percent Pm in the starting material was subtracted.

Behrendt N. Dano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12752-12758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was not possible to determine whether Glu-Pg or Lys-Pg was the predominant substrate for t-PA. To address this issue, cleavage of 125I-[D646E]Glu-Pg by t-PA was analyzed. Cleavage of cell-associated125I-[D646E]Glu-Pg by t-PA was only 2-fold greater than the reaction in the absence of cells at 10 min (Fig. 1, panel B and Fig. 2). The predominant form of the Pm heavy chain was the125I-[D646E]Glu-Pm form, and no conversion of125I-[D646E]Glu-Pg to 125I-[D646E]Lys-Pg was observed on the cell surface, consistent with the absence of Pm activity. Notably, the extent of Pm formation when125I-[D646E]Glu-Pg was bound to the cells was less than that observed when 125I-Glu-Pg was bound to the cells (Figs. 1 and 2). The extent of cleavage of cell-associated125I-Lys-Pg by t-PA was similar to that of125I-Glu-Pg (Fig. 1, panels A and Cand Fig. 2). However, at 10 min, the HUVEC-stimulated activation of Lys-Pg was only 1.3-fold greater than the reaction in solution. The cells afforded only this minimal enhancement of Lys-Pg activation by t-PA, compared with the solution phase, because Lys-Pg was activated more rapidly in solution than was Glu-Pg. (At 10 min, 51% of the Lys-Pg in solution was cleaved to Pm whereas only 3% of the Glu-Pg in solution was cleaved to Pm). To ensure that the increase in Pm associated with the cells was not because of a higher affinity or capacity of the cells for Pmversus Pg, we compared the number of molecules of125I-plasmin(ogen) forms bound to the cells in either the presence or absence of t-PA (Table I). The molecules of 125I-Glu-Pg bound to the cells did not increase in the presence compared with the absence of t-PA. Furthermore, in the presence of t-PA, the molecules of ligand bound to the cell were not greater when cell-bound 125I-Glu-Pg was activated by t-PA compared with treatment of cell-bound125I-[D646E]Glu-Pg with t-PA. These data suggest that the enhanced formation of Pm versus Pg on the cell surface could not be accounted for by enhanced binding of Pm to the cells.Table IEffect of t-PA on plasminogen binding to HUVECAdded radiolabeled ligandPlasminogen boundBuffert-PAmolecules/cell × 105Glu-plasminogen1.01 ± 0.031.04 ± 0.16[D646E]Glu-Pg1.02 ± 0.101.20 ± 0.06Lys-plasminogen1.93 ± 0.702.09 ± 0.60Confluent HUVEC in wells of 24-well culture dishes were incubated with 25 nm each of either 125I-Glu-plasminogen,125I-[D646E]Glu-Pg or 125I-Lys-plasminogen in either the presence or absence of 20 nm t-PA for 120 minutes at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by aspirating the unbound radiolabeled ligands, rapidly washing the cultures twice with HBSS-BSA, and extracting the cell-bound ligands as described under “Experimental Procedures.”; Values are mean ± S.E. of two experiments. Open table in a new tab Confluent HUVEC in wells of 24-well culture dishes were incubated with 25 nm each of either 125I-Glu-plasminogen,125I-[D646E]Glu-Pg or 125I-Lys-plasminogen in either the presence or absence of 20 nm t-PA for 120 minutes at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by aspirating the unbound radiolabeled ligands, rapidly washing the cultures twice with HBSS-BSA, and extracting the cell-bound ligands as described under “Experimental Procedures.”; Values are mean ± S.E. of two experiments. We also examined cleavage of the Pg forms by another Pg activator, hmw u-PA. Cleavage of Glu-Pg to Pm by hmw u-PA (10 nm) was stimulated 4-fold at 10 min, when Glu-Pg was bound to the HUVEC surface compared with the reaction in solution (Fig.3, panels A and B). The predominant form of the Pm heavy chain was Lys-Pm (Fig. 3,panel A). In addition, Lys-Pg accounted for 43% of the uncleaved Pg on the cell surface. In contrast, cleavage of cell-associated [D646E]Pg was still markedly less than cleavage of cell-associated 125I-Glu-Pg and cleavage of cell-associated [D646E]Pg was not enhanced compared with the reaction in solution (Fig. 3). The formation of [D646E]Lys-Pg was not detected on the cell surface. The percentage cleavage of Lys-Pg on the cell surface was similar to that of Glu-Pg, but cleavage of Lys-Pg in solution was markedly greater than that of Glu-Pg. (At 10 min, 71% of the Lys-Pg in solution was cleaved to Pm whereas only 17% of the Glu-Pg in solution was cleaved to Pm). Hence, cleavage of Lys-Pg was enhanced only 1.1-fold. The foregoing data showed that cell-associated125I-[D646E]Glu-Pg was less readily cleaved than either cell-associated 125I-Glu-Pg or 125I-Lys-Pg, which is consistent with less direct cleavage of Glu-Pg forms compared with Lys-Pg. However, the case of 125I-[D646E]Glu-Pg was also distinct from that of the other ligands because Pm was not produced following cleavage by the Pg activators. Pm cleaves single-chain t-PA to two-chain t-PA (24Rijken D.C. Hoylaerts M. Collen D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1982; 257: 2920-2925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pm also cleaves hmw u-PA to lmw u-PA, which also retains catalytic activity (25Saksela O. Rifkin D.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 93-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). To exclude other potential effects of cleavage of the Pg activator by Pm as an explanation for our results, we compared cleavage of125I-Glu-Pg and 125I-[D646E]Glu-Pg by lmw u-PA (which is not cleaved by Pm). The cleavage of these Pg forms by lmw u-PA was compared when the ligands were either bound to the HUVEC or in solution (Fig. 4, panels A and B). The extent of Pm formation when cell-associated Glu-Pg was activated with lmw u-PA was similar to that when cell-associated Glu-Pg was activated with hmw u-PA (compare Figs.3 and 4). When cell-associated Glu-Pg was activated with lmw u-PA, the predominant form of the Pm heavy chain was Lys-Pm and Lys-Pg accounted for 41% of the uncleaved Pg on the cell surface. Under these conditions, activation of Glu-Pg in solution was not detected. Cleavage of 125I-[D646E]Pg bound to HUVEC was not detected under these conditions. These results suggest that the differences in extent of cleavage of 125I-[D646E]Pg compared with125I-Glu-Pg could not be ascribed to an effect of Pm (produced in the latter reaction) on the Pg activator. We examined whether localization of Glu-Pg on the cell surface could enhance its conversion to Lys-Pg by exogenous Pm, compared with the solution phase. 125I-[D646E]Glu-Pg was used in this analysis to avoid any contribution of the added ligand to the conversion. 125I-[D646E]Glu-Pg was incubated with either buffer or adherent HUVEC in the presence of increasing concentrations of Pm for 20 min at 37 °C. The conversion of the cell-bound and solution phase 125I-[D646E]Glu-Pg to [D646E]Lys-Pg was monitored by SDS-PAGE. A marked enhancement in conversion to the Lys-form was observed when the ligand was bound to the HUVEC, compared with the solution phase (Fig.5). For example, under conditions where 59% of the cell-bound ligand was in the Lys-form, only 3% of the ligand in the solution phase was in the Lys-form. In this study we provide the first demonstration that activation of cell-bound Glu-Pg is markedly enhanced only when its conversion to Lys-Pg on the cell surface is permitted. This result allowed us to distinguish between two potential mechanisms for stimulation of Pm formation when Glu-Pg is bound to the cell surface (1Miles L.A. Plow E.F. J. Biol.

Felez J. Longstaff C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12414-12422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the first mechanism, the direct activation of Glu-Pg is promoted on the cell surface. In the second mechanism, initial conversion of Glu-Pg to Lys-Pg is necessary, so that formation of Pm is enhanced because the more readily activated Lys-Pg becomes the predominant substrate for Pg activators. These two potential mechanisms for this key step in cell surface Pg activation have not been distinguished in previous studies. With both native Glu-Pg and [D646E]Glu-Pg, we detected <5% conversion to either Lys-Pg or [D646E]Lys-Pg following binding to HUVEC in the absence of a Pg activator. This finding allowed us to carry out our study to address the role of the Glu-Pg to Lys-Pg conversion in stimulation of Pg activation on the HUVEC surface. In contrast, in an earlier study ∼50–60% of Glu-Pg was converted to Lys-Pg on the HUVEC surface, in the absence of the addition of exogenous Pm (18Hajjar K.A. Nachman R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 1769-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). (These studies also suggested that Pm was not the source of proteolytic activity for conversion of Glu-Pg to Lys-Pg (5Ellis V. Behrendt N. Dano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12752-12758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,18Hajjar K.A. Nachman R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 1769-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar)). This difference from the previously published data may be ascribed to differences in the culture conditions of the HUVEC in different laboratories or to differences in the added ligand. Thus, the ability to convert Glu-Pg to Lys-Pg, in the absence of exogenous Pm or Pg activator is not a consistent property of the HUVEC surface. We found that when Glu-Pg was bound to the cells and activated with either t-PA or hmw u-PA (conditions where Lys-Pg and Lys-Pm formation occurred), the rate of Pm formation was similar to that of cell-bound Lys-Pg. This resulted in stimulation of Glu-Pg activation 4–13-fold compared with the reaction in solution. This first observation would be compatible with either of the two activation mechanisms proposed above. To distinguish between these mechanisms we studied cleavage by t-PA of a mutant Glu-Pg, [D646E]Glu-Pg, that does not produce Pm activity following cleavage by Pg activators, so that a [D646E]Lys-Pg is not produced. Cleavage of [D646E]Glu-Pg on the HUVEC surface was not markedly enhanced compared with the reaction in solution. Furthermore, the rates of cleavage of cell-bound and soluble Lys-Pg were also similar, suggesting that the interaction of Lys-Pg with the cells also did not markedly stimulate its activation. Thus, in the absence of the reaction step in which Glu-Pg is converted to Lys-Pg, Pm formation was not markedly enhanced on the cell surface, i.e. the direct cleavage of [D646E]Glu-Pg was not markedly stimulated upon binding to the cell surface, and the cleavage of Lys-Pg was not markedly stimulated on the cell surface compared with the reaction in solution. In contrast, we observed a marked stimulation of activation of cell-bound Glu-Pg, a reaction in which the Glu-Pg to Lys-Pg conversion did occur. In addition to the transition to the Lys-Pg form, the activation of both Glu-Pg and of Lys-Pg differs from that of [D646E]Glu-Pg because active Pm is formed in the former cases, but not in the latter case. Therefore, we considered whether other activities of Pm might account for the greater activation of Glu-Pg and Lys-Pg compared with the cleavage of [D646E]Glu-Pg on the cell surface. Firstly, treatment of U937 cells with Pm has been reported to increase the binding of Pg to this cell type (26Gonzalez-Gronow M. Stack S. Pizzo S.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 286: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the present study we found that the molecules of 125I-Glu-Pg bound to the cells did not increase in the presence when compared with the absence of t-PA. Furthermore, in the presence of t-PA, the molecules of ligand bound to the cell were not greater when cell-bound 125I-Glu-Pg was activated by t-PA compared with treatment of cell-bound 125I-[D646E]Glu-Pg with t-PA. These data suggest that the enhanced formation of Pmversus Pg on the cell surface could not be accounted for by enhanced binding of Glu-Pg versus [D646E]Glu-Pg to the cells because of the generation of new binding sites by Pm generated in the reaction. The differences between our data and the previous report (26Gonzalez-Gronow M. Stack S. Pizzo S.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 286: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) may be ascribed to differences in responsiveness of HUVEC to Pm and/or to lower levels of Pm generated in our experiments. Pm also cleaves single-chain t-PA to two-chain t-PA and hmw u-PA to lmw u-PA. Although, the catalytic efficiencies of both forms are similar (24Rijken D.C. Hoylaerts M. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2920-2925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Saksela O. Rifkin D.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 93-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar) we excluded other potential effects of cleavage of the Pg activator by Pm by examining cleavage of cell-bound Pg forms by lmw u-PA (a Pg activator that is not cleaved by Pm). Glu-Pg activation was also markedly stimulated on the HUVEC surface by lmw u-PA under conditions where cleavage of [D646E]Glu-Pg was not detected. Because similar differences in activation were seen using both lmw and hmw u-PA, these results suggest that cleavage of the Pg activator by Pm did not account for the observed differences in Pg activation on the HUVEC surface with the different Pg forms. The number of molecules of Lys-Pg bound to the cells compared with both Glu-Pg and [D646E]Glu-Pg, was higher as reflected by the data in Table I and consistent with previous reports of a higher affinity of Lys-Pg versus Glu-Pg for cells (27Hajjar K.A. Hamel N.M. Harpel P.C. Nachman R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 1712-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 28Miles L.A. Dahlberg C.M. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11928-11934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this increased binding did not appear to increase stimulation of Pg activation on the cell surface because the rates of activation of Glu-Pg and Lys-Pg (when bound to the cell surface) were similar. Although Lys-Pg and Lys-Pm were formed on the cell surface when cell-bound Glu-Pg was activated with t-PA, the number of molecules of ligand bound/cell was not increased. This suggests that the affinity of Glu-Pg for the cells remained the same even in the presence of t-PA when Lys-Pg was formed on the cell surface, most likely because >94% of the ligand in solution remained as Glu-Pg (data not shown). Cleavage of the variant Pg, [D646E]Glu-Pg, was not markedly stimulated when bound to the HUVEC, although [D646E]Glu-Pg was still susceptible to cleavage by both t-PA and by u-PA when bound to the cell surface. Thus, cleavage of [D646E]Glu-Pg by Pg activators can occur (as it does in the solution phase) but direct cleavage of [D646E]Glu-Pg does not appear to be stimulated upon binding of the ligand to the cell. Analogously, a small amount of direct activation of native Glu-Pg on the cell surface, should provide a source of Pm for conversion of cell-bound Glu-Pg to Lys-Pg, leading to amplification of Pg activation on these cells. The rate of cleavage of cell-bound Lys-Pg by t-PA was similar to the rate of cleavage of cell-bound Glu-Pg. However, binding to the cells only minimally increased Lys-Pg activation by the Pg activators compared with the reaction in the solution phase. The small amount of stimulation of activation of [D646E]Glu-Pg and Lys-Pg when bound to the cell surface could be because of the effect of concentration of reactants as previously suggested (10Sinniger V.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12414-12422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), particularly because the HUVEC express binding sites for both t-PA (29Hajjar K.A. Harpel P.C.

Alternatively, or in addition, some common conformational change induced in both Glu-Pg and Lys-Pg upon binding to cells may contribute to the enhancement in activation. Furthermore, although these experiments were performed under conditions where only a small proportion of t-PA receptors would be saturated and at an excess of hmw u-PA that would allow cleavage by soluble as well as by cell-bound u-PA, we cannot exclude that the effect of concentration of Pg on the cell surface, as well as the presence of receptors for the Pg activators is also absolutely required for stimulation of activation on the cell surface. Our results also suggest an additional new profibrinolytic function of localization of plasmin(ogen) on the cell surface: Conversion of Glu-Pg to Lys-Pg by Pm was enhanced when the ligand was cell-associated compared with being in the solution phase. This may be because of colocalization and concentration of Pm and Pg on the cell surface, enhanced enzymatic activity of cell-bound Pm as described for U937 cells (26Gonzalez-Gronow M. Stack S. Pizzo S.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 286: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and/or a more accessible conformation of cell-associated Glu-Pg compared with the solution phase. Taken together, our results suggest that the conversion of Glu-Pg to Lys-Pg by Pm is necessary for maximal enhancement in Glu-Pg activation on cell surfaces relative to the reaction in solution and that the conversion of Glu-Pg to Lys-Pg is enhanced when Glu-Pg is bound to cells. Thus, the enhancement of formation of the more readily activated Lys-Pg allows cells to promote Pg activation on their surfaces, a key step in both thrombolysis and in physiologic and pathophysiologic processes involving cell migration.

However, the precise mechanism of downstream signaling and trafficking of the receptors is largely unknown. Here we report that the histone acetyltransferase Tip60 and the histone deacetylase HDAC7 interact with one of the ET receptors, ETA, as determined by yeast two-hybrid analysis, glutathioneS-transferase pull-down assays, and co-immunoprecipitation from transfected COS-7 cells. In the absence of ET-1, Tip60 and HDAC7 were localized mainly in the cell nucleus while ETA was predominantly confined to the plasma membrane. Stimulation with ET-1 resulted in the internalization of ETA to the perinuclear compartment and simultaneously in the efflux of Tip60 and HDAC7 from the nucleus to the same perinuclear compartment where each protein co-localized with the receptor. Upon co-transfection with ETA into COS-7 cells, Tip60 strongly increased ET-1-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, whereas HDAC7 had no significant effect. We thus suggest that protein acetylase and deacetylase interact with ETA in a ligand-dependent fashion and may participate in ET signal transduction.

The diversity of endothelin action may be explained not only by the multiplicity of ligands and receptor heterogeneity but also by the ability of the receptor to activate different signaling pathways.

For example, Src and/or other upstream signal-transducing proteins may interact with these receptors directly or through arrestin (30Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lansing T.J.

Binding of ET-1 to ETA causes rapid receptor internalization via clathrin-coated pits and/or caveolae (40Chun M. Lin H.Y. Henis Y.I. Lodish H.F. J. Biol.

Internalized ETA then traffics through the endosomal pathway to the pericentriolar recycling compartment that can also be marked by fluorescent-labeled transferrin (42Bremnes T. Paasche J.D. Mehlum A. Sandberg C. Bremnes B. Attramadal H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17596-17604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Eventually, a significant fraction of ETA recycles back to the plasma membrane (42Bremnes T. Paasche J.D. Mehlum A. Sandberg C. Bremnes B. Attramadal H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17596-17604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 43Marsault R. Feolde E. Frelin C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C687-C693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To identify novel proteins that interact with ETA and may affect its biological functions, we have utilized the yeast two-hybrid system using the ETA C-terminal region as bait. Two ETA-interacting proteins were identified: a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) Tip60 (44Kamine J. Elangovan B. Subramanian T. Coleman D. Chinnadurai G. Virology. 1996; 216: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and a human homolog of mouse HDAC7 (45Kao H.Y. Downes M. Ordentlich P. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 55-66PubMed Google Scholar) that represents a new member of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) family. We have further shown that HAT and HDAC proteins undergo ET-1-dependent translocation from nucleus to cytoplasm, where they co-localize and interact with ETA. Moreover, co-expression of Tip60 with ETA significantly potentiated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in response to ET-1 stimulation. We propose that Tip60 and HDAC7 act as novel components of ETA-mediated signal transduction. The following antibodies were used for this work: monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (InVitrogen), monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), monoclonal anti-p44/42 MAP kinase (Erk1/2) antibody (New England Biolabs), monoclonal anti-phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase antibody (New England Biolabs), polyclonal anti-ETA antibody (46Chun M.

A. 1994; 91: 11728-11732Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), polyclonal anti-Tip60 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology), Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit and FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoreserach Laboratory), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) and affinity-purified nonspecific mouse IgG (Sigma). Other reagent grade chemicals were from Sigma. Transformed African monkey kidney cell line COS-7 and rat smooth muscle cell line A10 were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (dMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. The rat ETA cDNA (40Chun M. Lin H.Y. Henis Y.I. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10855-10860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) was subcloned into theHindIII site of pRC-CMV (Promega). The bait DNA, ETAC/pAS2–1, was constructed as described below. The ETA C-terminal region, which consists of amino acids 365–420 of rat ETA, was amplified from full-length ETA in pRC-CMV vector by PCR and cloned into the PstI site of pAS2–1 vector (CLONTECH). The C-terminal region of ETA (amino acids 365–420) was amplified by PCR, conjugated in frame with glutathione S-transferase (GST) in pGEX-4T1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and was named ETACGST. To add Myc and polyhistidine epitopes to the C-terminal end of ETA, the latter was subcloned into pcDNA3.1Myc-His(+) vector. The stop codon at the end of ETA in pRCCMV vector was deleted, a XbaI site was introduced by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and this product was introduced into the pcDNA3.1Myc-His(+) vector A by both HindIII andXbaI digestion. This construct was named ETAmychis. The cloned bait DNA, ETAC/pAS2–1, and human brain library DNA, in pACT10 vector, were co-transformed into yeast strain CG1945, and positive clones were selected. Positive clones were further selected for those that specifically interact with the ETA C-terminal region but not with other proteins (p53, lamin, and GAL4 DNA-binding domain alone) and the cDNAs were isolated from these clones and sequenced. The Tip60 cDNA obtained by two-hybrid screening was subcloned into pFLAG-CMV2 vector (Kodak/Sigma) using the SalI andXbaI-digested vector. HDAC7 cDNA corresponding to the C-terminal fragment of the protein (amino acids 545–824) was cut withEcoRI and BglII and ligated into the pFLAG-CMV2 vector that was cut with EcoRI and XbaI. This vector is referred to as ctHDAC7/pFLAG-CMV2. The full-length cDNA for Tip60 was obtained from the human brain library by PCR. The PCR product was then digested with KpnI and DrdI. The partial Tip60 cDNA in the pFLAG-CMV2 vector was cut with DrdI and XbaI. The pFLAGCMV2 vector was cut with KpnI and XbaI, and all three fragments were ligated together. This vector was named Tip60/pFLAGCMV2. The full-length cDNA of HDAC7, DKFZp586J0917 (GenBankTM/EBI accession no. AL117455), was obtained from the human genome center (RZPD) in Heidelberg, Germany. The cDNA was cloned into the pFLAGCMV2 vector and this vector was named HDAC7/pFLAGCMV2. Plasmids (4 μg each) were transfected into COS-7 cells using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and cells were harvested or stained after 72 h of transfection. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and harvested in the extraction buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm PMSF). For the analysis of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, 5 μm Trichostatin A (Takara Inc.), 1 mmNa3VO4, and 20 mm NaF were added to the extraction buffer. After incubation on ice for 15 min, the extract was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min to remove cell debris. The protein concentration in supernatant was determined by Pierce BCA protein assay. ETACGST (which comprises the entire sequence of the ETA C terminus) and GST alone were purified as described (47Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Beads were blocked with 10 mg/ml BSA (Sigma) at RT for 30 min. The extracts from the Tip60- or HDAC7-transfected cells were added and incubated with the beads at RT for 1 h. Beads were washed twice (5 min each) with the binding buffer and then twice with the binding buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl. Equal volumes of 2× sample buffer were added to washed beads for 10 min at 95 °C, and the supernatant was analyzed by Western blot. Transfected cells were harvested and anti-Myc antibody or nonspecific mouse IgG (1 μl each) were added to the cell extracts (0.5–1 mg) and were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation. Protein G-Sepharose beads (30–50 μl; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), blocked with 2% BSA in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C, were added to the mixture and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed once with the binding buffer (see the previous paragraph) at 4 °C for 10 min and four times with the binding buffer containing 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. The beads were then rinsed once with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4 and eluted with equal volumes of 2× sample buffer at 65 °C for 10 min. The eluates were analyzed by Western blot. Cells on coverslips were washed with cold PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 30 min at RT. Cells were solubilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at RT and then rinsed with PBS three times. Primary antibody in PBS with 5% BSA and 3% donkey serum was added for 30 min at RT. The cells were washed with PBS for 30–60 min and Cy3- or FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (2–4 μg/ml in the same solution as primary antibody) was added to the cells for another 30 min. The cells on coverslips were washed overnight in PBS at 4 °C and mounted on slides. The fluorescent images were analyzed with the help of the LSM510 Zeiss confocal microscope. Rat vascular smooth muscle cells A10 were incubated in the absence or presence of ET-1 (10−8m) for 30 min and separated into nuclei and cytoplasmic fractions as described (48Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar). To identify proteins interacting with ETA, the human brain cDNA library (∼8 × 105 clones) was screened with the C-terminal region of ETA (amino acids 365–420) as a bait using the yeast two-hybrid system. The final selection process yielded two strong positive clones. A BLAST search revealed that the first clone was identical to Tat-interactive protein 60 or Tip60 (44Kamine J. Elangovan B. Subramanian T. Coleman D. Chinnadurai G. Virology. 1996; 216: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), which belongs to the subfamily of histone acetyltransferases called MYST (49Yamamoto T. Horikoshi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30595-30598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The second clone encoded a novel protein with a region of strong homology to the conserved catalytic domain of the class II histone deacetylases, which includes HDAC4, HDAC5, and HDAC6 (50Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). According to a recent report (45Kao H.Y. Downes M. Ordentlich P. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 55-66PubMed Google Scholar), this protein represents a human homolog of mouse HDAC7. To confirm interaction of Tip60 and HDAC7 with ETA, GST-conjugated peptide corresponding to the C terminus of ETA was used in GST pull-down experiments. Fig. 1 ademonstrates that Tip60 and ctHDAC7 bind to ETACGST but not to GST alone. These results confirm the direct interaction between the ETA C terminus and Tip60 or HDAC7 in vitro. The interactions were further verified by co-immunoprecipitation experiments using transfected COS-7 cells. ETA with Myc epitope and poly(His) tag at the C terminus (ETAmychis) was expressed in COS-7 cells alone or co-expressed with either Tip60 or ctHDAC7 (both in the pFLAG-CMV2 vector) and immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody. Western blot with anti-FLAG antibody demonstrates that both Tip60 and ctHDAC7 can interact with ETA in vivo (Fig. 1 b). In control experiments, when cells were transfected with Tip60 or ctHDAC7 alone, no specific signal was detected in the immunoprecipitated material. To study the intracellular localization of Tip60, HDAC7, and ETA, transfected COS-7 cells were incubated in the presence or in the absence of ET-1. These cells were immunostained with rabbit polyclonal anti-ETA antibody, which specifically recognizes the N terminus of ETA (46Chun M. Liyanage U.K. Lisanti M.P. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11728-11732Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) and with monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody for the detection of Tip60 and HDAC7. Confocal images showed that in the absence of ET-1 ETA was expressed mainly on the cell surface (Fig.2). Tip60 (Fig. 2 a) and HDAC7 (Fig. 2 b) were detected mainly in the cell nucleus similar to all other known histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases (50Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar,51Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with ET-1 changed the intracellular localization of all three proteins. As expected, ETA was internalized from the cell surface into the perinuclear region (Fig. 2, a andb). ET-1 stimulation also caused a dramatic redistribution of both Tip60 and HDAC7 from the nucleus into the same perinuclear region where these proteins co-localized with ETA. Note, that Fig.2 b shows two cells (bottom middle panel). One cell (transfected with both HDAC7 and ETA) demonstrates the redistribution of HDAC7 (green) from the nucleus to the ETA-containing perinuclear region upon ET-1 administration. Another cell (transfected with HDAC7 only) does not show this effect. Thus, expression of ETA is required for the ET-1-dependent nuclear efflux of HDAC7. ET-1-induced efflux of Tip60 from the nucleus was confirmed in biochemical experiments with non-transfected smooth muscle cells. A10 cells treated and not treated with ET-1 were separated into the nuclear and the cytosolic fractions, and the presence of endogenous Tip60 in these samples was analyzed by Western blot. It is evident in Fig.3 that Tip60 is localized in the nucleus of basal cells and is partially relocated to the cytosol upon ET-1 stimulation. To determine whether or not Tip60 and/or HDAC7 are involved in the downstream signaling of ETA, we analyzed the activation of p44/42 MAP kinase (Erk1/2) in response to ET-1 stimulation. As described previously (52Wang Y. Simonson M.S. Pouyssegur J. Dunn M.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 589-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 53Wang Y. Pouyssegur J. Dunn M.J. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1993; 22: S164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and is also shown in Fig.4, stimulation with ET-1 causes transient activation of this pathway in COS-7 cells transfected with ETAmychis. However, in cells transfected with ETAmychis together with Tip60, the level of ET-1-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation is dramatically increased, which suggests that Tip60 may be directly involved in the acute downstream signaling of ETA. Deletion of the C-terminal region of ETA abolishes the effect of Tip60, indicating that direct interaction is required for the elevation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation (data not shown). The effect of exogenously expressed HDAC7 on the ERK1/2 pathway was inconsistent. In some cases, ERK1/2 phosphorylation was attenuated, whereas other experiments showed no effect (data not shown). However, we were never able to detect an increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation in ETAmychis- and HDAC7-transfected cells. Acetylation/deacetylation of histones is crucial for the regulation of transcription of many genes. Known substrates for HATs, however, are not limited to histones and include several transcription factors, importin, and α-tubulin (54Takemura R. Okabe S. Umeyama T. Kanai Y. Cowan N.J. Hirokawa N.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 662-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Acetylation affects DNA-binding activity, protein stability, and protein-protein interaction (51Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). Therefore, acetylation and deacetylation may represent general post-translational modifications that take place in both nuclear and cytosolic compartments of the cell (reviewed in Ref. 51Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). In fact, we have shown that Tip60, a HAT family protein, can potentiate the effect of ET-1 on ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which suggests that the acetylation event may also regulate receptor-mediated signaling pathways. Our studies on the localization of Tip60 and HDAC7 revealed that under basal conditions the major pools of Tip60 and HDAC7, like other HATs and HDACs, reside in the cell nucleus. ET-1 stimulation led to the redistribution of Tip60 and HDAC7 from the nucleus into the perinuclear region where each protein co-localized with the internalized ETA. Efflux of Tip60 and HDAC7 from the nucleus may have dual effects. First, it may result in changes in the transcription of several ET-1 responsive genes, such as c-myc, c-jun,c-fos, etc. Second, interaction of Tip60 and HDAC7 with ETA or ETA-associated proteins may affect cytoplasmic signaling pathways, such as phosphorylation of ERK. It was recently shown that other class II histone deacetylases, HDAC4 and 5, shuttle between the nucleus and the cytosol (60Miska E.A. Karlsson C. Langley E. Nielsen S.J. Pines J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5099-5107Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 61Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7835-7840Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). The physiological importance of the nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution of HDAC4 and 5 was emphasized in a recent report demonstrating that muscle differentiation can be controlled by nuclear export of HDAC4 and 5 in response to calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase signaling (62McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Lu J. Olson E.N. Nature. 2000; 408: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). On the other hand, constitutive activation of the MAP kinase pathway in Ras- or MEK1-transfected cells results in the increased nuclear localization of HDAC4 (63Zhou X. Richon V.M. Wang A.H. Yang X.J. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14329-14333Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). ERK1/2 was shown to interact with and phosphorylate HDAC4, although it is not clear to what extent phosphorylation of HDAC4 may regulate its intracellular localization (63Zhou X. Richon V.M. Wang A.H. Yang X.J. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14329-14333Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Our findings provide the first specific example of ligand-induced translocation of HAT and HDAC. However, the molecular mechanism(s) triggering the nuclear export of Tip60 and HDAC7 in response to ET-1 is not known. It is possible that interaction with internalized ETA may anchor Tip60 and HDAC7 in the cytosolic compartment and induce their efflux from the nucleus. There is evidence that protein 14-3-3 may play an important role in cytoplasmic retention of HDAC4 and 5 (61Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7835-7840Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 64McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14400-14405Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). With the experimental system established in our study, future work should be able to ascertain the role of 14-3-3 or other candidate proteins in ET-1-induced nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of Tip60 and HDAC7. In addition to the MAP kinase pathway, Tip60 and HDAC7 may be involved in other regulatory events. For example, we have noticed that transfection of cells with Tip60 increases (or with HDAC7 decreases) the level of ETA (data not shown). This suggests that Tip60 may protect ETA from degradation by re-routing the receptor from lysosomes to the recycling pathway. We are now trying to follow up on these experiments to uncover the potential role of acetylation/deacetylation in the regulation of receptor trafficking and stability.

Horn C. Brown M. Loudovitch A. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar).

However, almost all of the nuclear-encoded protein factors that are anticipated to interact with such divergent tRNAs remain to be identified.In the elongation cycle of prokaryotic translation, one of the most crucial steps is the formation of an active ternary complex among elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA), and GTP followed by transfer of the aa-tRNA to the ribosomal A site (6Kaziro Y.

Nevertheless, it has been demonstrated that such nematode mt tRNAs are capable of accepting the cognate amino acids and are probably functional in the mt translation systems (3Watanabe Y. Tsurui H.

To elucidate how nematode mt EF-Tu binds to T stem-lacking tRNA, we determined the full-length cDNA sequence of a nematode (C. elegans) EF-Tu homologue and detected the corresponding protein inC. elegans mt extracts immunologically. Based on the binding activity of the nematode EF-Tu homologue toward nematode and bacterial aa-tRNAs revealed by our experimental results, we propose a structural model for the ternary complex formed among EF-Tu, aa-tRNA, and GTP in the nematode mt system and postulate that the RNA co-evolved in the system with its cognate RNA-binding protein.DISCUSSIONWhether or not a unique EF-Tu exists in nematode mitochondria has long been an intriguing question, because conventional EF-Tus so far elucidated recognize the tRNA T-stem,− which is absent in most nematode mt tRNAs (2Wolstenholme D.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 141: 173-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). The findings of this study could have given the answer to this question by demonstrating that a nematode mt translation system actually possesses a unique EF-Tu with a long C-terminal extension (domain 3′) (Figs. 1 and 2), which is considered to be a prerequisite to compensate for the lack of a T stem in nematode mt tRNAs (Fig. 3).Two cases in which unique EF-Tus with C-terminal extensions are used for translation are already known: SelB in some bacteria and its equivalents in mammalian systems (43Kromayer M.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4796-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and EF-Tu in mammalian mitochondria (27Woriax V.L. Burkhart W. Spremulli L.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The former is specific for selenocysteinyl-tRNA, which is involved in decoding a particular UGA stop codon by recognizing both the tRNA and the stem-loop structure of mRNA occurring just behind the UGA codon in bacterial systems. The long C-terminal extension (domain 4) with about 250 amino acid residues is considered to be involved in the recognition of the stem-loop structure (43Kromayer M. Wilting R. Tormay P. Böck A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We attempted to align the C. elegans mt EF-Tu domain 3′ sequence with the SelB domain 4 sequence in some bacteria, but no appreciable homology was observed, suggesting that the function of domain 3′ in nematode mt EF-Tu is different from domain 4 in SelB. C-terminal extensions comprising 11 amino acid residues observed in mammalian mt EF-Tus (Fig. 1) (27Woriax V.L. Burkhart W. Spremulli L.L. Biochim. Biophys.

Biol. 2000; 297: 421-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) may possess a role in compensating for some incomplete tertiary structures of mammalian mt tRNAs, such as a lack of tertiary interaction between the T and D arms at the elbow region or the presence of a slightly shorter T stem (1Sprinzl M. Horn C. Brown M. Loudovitch A. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar,47Wakita K. Watanabe Y. Yokogawa T. Kumazawa Y. Nakamura S. Ueda T. Watanabe K. Nishikawa K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), a possibility supported by the fact that bacterial EF-Tu possessing no such extension binds to mammalian mt tRNAs less efficiently than mammalian mt EF-Tu (48Kumazawa Y. Schwartzbach C.J. Liao H.X. Mizumoto K. Kaziro Y. Miura K. Watanabe K. Spremulli L.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). 3T. Ohtsuki and K. Watanabe, unpublished results. Domains 1 and 2 of mammalian mt EF-Tu may also contribute to such compensation (discussed below). However, because no homology is observed between this extension and domain 3′ of the C. elegans mt EF-Tu, the nematode domain 3′ function also seems to differ from that of the C-terminal extension of mammalian mt EF-Tu.With regard to the other domains, there is considerable homology among amino acid residues in both domains 1 and 2 between the nematode and the other mt EF-Tus, whereas the residues in domain 3 are quite different.

Science. 1995; 270: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar), all of which are dispersed through domains 1 and 2, are highly conserved among these EF-Tus. The residues characteristic for mt EF-Tus (purple) (41Kuhlman P. Palmer J.D. Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 1057-1070Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) are also well conserved. Only the residues in contact with the T stem, which are located in domain 3 (red) (9Nissen P. Thirup S. Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. Structure. 1999; 7: 143-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), are quite different in the nematode mt EF-Tu compared with the other mt EF-Tus, which is quite reasonable considering that nematode mt EF-Tu has no target T stem in the mt tRNA (see below) and lost binding ability to conventional tRNA having a T stem (Fig. 3 B).The results presented here strongly suggest that the immunodetectable protein (Fig. 2) is actually the nematode mt EF-Tu, which, as shown in Fig. 3, specifically recognizes T stem-lacking tRNA. To substantiate the contention that the protein is an EF-Tu, we also attempted poly(U)-dependent poly(Phe) synthesis in vitrousing the protein. Although the nematode mt EF-Tu was found not to work in an E. coli system, it only slightly stimulated poly(U)-dependent poly(Phe) synthesis using E. coli Phe-tRNAPhe in a bovine in vitrotranslation system (data not shown), despite very low affinities of the nematode mt EF-Tu toward E. coli Phe-tRNAPhe. Nematode mt Phe-tRNAPhe functioned neither on bovine mt ribosomes nor on E. coli ribosomes. A homologous nematode mt translation system, which is as yet unavailable, is necessary to detect efficient translation activity with nematode mt EF-Tu.The experimental results with the chimeric proteins (Fig. 4) indicate that, in addition to domain 3′, domain 3 in the nematode protein also plays a crucial role in its binding to T arm-lacking tRNA (Fig.5 A), because the binding activity of bovine mt EF-Tu with domain 3′ of nematode mt EF-Tu attached (BmCe3′) toward nematode mt aa-tRNA was significantly enhanced by switching domain 3 between the two animal mt EF-Tus. Domain 3 may fix the location of domain 3′ through interactions between the C-terminal domains so that domain 3′ can bind to the T arm-lacking tRNA at the proper position. Domain 3′ might be a part of the domain 3, which is larger than those of conventional EF-Tus. In addition to the C-terminal domains, the N-terminal domain 1 or both domains 1 and 2 in animal mt EF-Tus also seem to assist in binding to the nematode mt T stem-lacking tRNA (Fig.5 A) or even to bovine mt tRNA with divergent T arms.3Although domain 1 is highly conserved among organisms, a key difference between the peptide sequences in bacterial and mt EF-Tus lies in a region noted previously as the “proteobacterial/mitochondrial factor signature region” (41Kuhlman P. Palmer J.D. Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 1057-1070Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which in mt EF-Tus is located near the junction with domain 2 (colored purple in Fig. 1) but which is absent in bacterial counterparts. In the case of animal mt factors, this region might make a contribution in binding to the nematode mt tRNAs, because, as shown in Fig. 5 A, nematode Met-tRNAMet can be recognized not only by nematode mt EF-Tu but also by bovine mt EF-Tu, although only slightly, whereas it is not recognized at all by T. thermophilus EF-Tu.The above results taken together with crystallographic data on the bacterial ternary complex (8Nissen P. Kjeldgaard M. Thirup S. Polekhina G. Reshetnikova L. Clark B.F. Nyborg J. Science. 1995; 270: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar, 9Nissen P. Thirup S. Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. Structure. 1999; 7: 143-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and bovine mt EF-Tu/GDP (46Andersen G.R. Thirup S. Spremulli L.L. Nyborg J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 421-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) prompt us to propose the outline ternary complex model for nematode mitochondria shown in Fig. 6 (right panel). Because the C terminus of the eubacterial EF-Tu in the ternary complex is located near the connector region of tRNA (Fig. 6, left panel) and it has been suggested that the short C-terminal extension of bovine mt EF-Tu touches the connector region (46Andersen G.R. Thirup S. Spremulli L.L. Nyborg J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 421-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), domain 3′ of the nematode mt EF-Tu may play a role in compensating for the loss of interaction between the tRNA T stem and domain 3 of the bacterial EF-Tu, either by binding domain 3′ to a specific region(s) around the connector region of the tRNA or by providing a new binding site for the tRNA with the help of another EF-Tu domain(s). Although the location of domain 3′ in the complex is unknown, taking account of the macromolecular mimicry hypothesis concerning translation machinery (8Nissen P. Kjeldgaard M. Thirup S. Polekhina G. Reshetnikova L. Clark B.F. Nyborg J. Science. 1995; 270: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar, 53Ito K. Ebihara K. Uno M. Nakamura Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5443-5448Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), we postulate that domain 3′ in the nematode mt complex might be located at or near the position corresponding to that occupied by the T arm in the bacterial ternary complex (Fig. 6).Finally, our results may represent a novel example of the co-evolution of a structurally simplified RNA and the cognate RNA-binding protein, with the latter having apparently acquired an additional domain to compensate for the lack of a protein-binding site(s) in the RNA molecule. One of the unusual features of the animal mitochondrial (mt)1 translation system is the use of tRNA with highly divergent structures (1Sprinzl M. Horn C. Brown M. Loudovitch A. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Such nonstandard structural forms have been predicted from gene sequences encoded in mt DNA (2Wolstenholme D.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 141: 173-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar), and some have been confirmed at the RNA level (3Watanabe Y. Tsurui H. Ueda T. Furushima R. Takamiya S. Kita K.

Watanabe K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial tRNA structural divergence is thought to reflect relaxed constraints operating on translation systems that produce very few proteins encoded in mt DNA (5Palmer J.D. Nature. 1997; 387: 454-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, almost all of the nuclear-encoded protein factors that are anticipated to interact with such divergent tRNAs remain to be identified. In the elongation cycle of prokaryotic translation, one of the most crucial steps is the formation of an active ternary complex among elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA), and GTP followed by transfer of the aa-tRNA to the ribosomal A site (6Kaziro Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 505: 95-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 7Sprinzl M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 245-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).

Söll D. RajBahndary U.L. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis and Function. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C.1995: 423-442Google Scholar) show that bacterial EF-Tu binds mainly to two regions within tRNA: the terminal region of the acceptor stem and one side of the T stem helix, the length of which strongly influences ternary complex formation (11Rudinger J. Blechschmidt B. Ribeiro S. Sprinzl M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5682-5688Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).

On the other hand, most tRNA species encoded in the mt DNA of at least three nematodes, Ascaris suum, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Onchocerca volvulus, lack the T stem necessary for binding with bacterial EF-Tu (3Watanabe Y.

A homologous nematode mt translation system, which is as yet unavailable, is necessary to detect efficient translation activity with nematode mt EF-Tu.The experimental results with the chimeric proteins (Fig. 4) indicate that, in addition to domain 3′, domain 3 in the nematode protein also plays a crucial role in its binding to T arm-lacking tRNA (Fig.5 A), because the binding activity of bovine mt EF-Tu with domain 3′ of nematode mt EF-Tu attached (BmCe3′) toward nematode mt aa-tRNA was significantly enhanced by switching domain 3 between the two animal mt EF-Tus. Domain 3 may fix the location of domain 3′ through interactions between the C-terminal domains so that domain 3′ can bind to the T arm-lacking tRNA at the proper position. Domain 3′ might be a part of the domain 3, which is larger than those of conventional EF-Tus. In addition to the C-terminal domains, the N-terminal domain 1 or both domains 1 and 2 in animal mt EF-Tus also seem to assist in binding to the nematode mt T stem-lacking tRNA (Fig.5 A) or even to bovine mt tRNA with divergent T arms.3Although domain 1 is highly conserved among organisms, a key difference between the peptide sequences in bacterial and mt EF-Tus lies in a region noted previously as the “proteobacterial/mitochondrial factor signature region” (41Kuhlman P. Palmer J.D. Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 1057-1070Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which in mt EF-Tus is located near the junction with domain 2 (colored purple in Fig. 1) but which is absent in bacterial counterparts. In the case of animal mt factors, this region might make a contribution in binding to the nematode mt tRNAs, because, as shown in Fig. 5 A, nematode Met-tRNAMet can be recognized not only by nematode mt EF-Tu but also by bovine mt EF-Tu, although only slightly, whereas it is not recognized at all by T. thermophilus EF-Tu.The above results taken together with crystallographic data on the bacterial ternary complex (8Nissen P.

Biol. 2000; 297: 421-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) prompt us to propose the outline ternary complex model for nematode mitochondria shown in Fig. 6 (right panel). Because the C terminus of the eubacterial EF-Tu in the ternary complex is located near the connector region of tRNA (Fig. 6, left panel) and it has been suggested that the short C-terminal extension of bovine mt EF-Tu touches the connector region (46Andersen G.R. Thirup S. Spremulli L.L. Nyborg J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 421-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), domain 3′ of the nematode mt EF-Tu may play a role in compensating for the loss of interaction between the tRNA T stem and domain 3 of the bacterial EF-Tu, either by binding domain 3′ to a specific region(s) around the connector region of the tRNA or by providing a new binding site for the tRNA with the help of another EF-Tu domain(s). Although the location of domain 3′ in the complex is unknown, taking account of the macromolecular mimicry hypothesis concerning translation machinery (8Nissen P. Kjeldgaard M. Thirup S. Polekhina G. Reshetnikova L. Clark B.F. Nyborg J. Science. 1995; 270: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar, 53Ito K. Ebihara K. Uno M. Nakamura Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5443-5448Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), we postulate that domain 3′ in the nematode mt complex might be located at or near the position corresponding to that occupied by the T arm in the bacterial ternary complex (Fig. 6).Finally, our results may represent a novel example of the co-evolution of a structurally simplified RNA and the cognate RNA-binding protein, with the latter having apparently acquired an additional domain to compensate for the lack of a protein-binding site(s) in the RNA molecule. Whether or not a unique EF-Tu exists in nematode mitochondria has long been an intriguing question, because conventional EF-Tus so far elucidated recognize the tRNA T-stem,− which is absent in most nematode mt tRNAs (2Wolstenholme D.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 141: 173-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). The findings of this study could have given the answer to this question by demonstrating that a nematode mt translation system actually possesses a unique EF-Tu with a long C-terminal extension (domain 3′) (Figs. 1 and 2), which is considered to be a prerequisite to compensate for the lack of a T stem in nematode mt tRNAs (Fig. 3). Two cases in which unique EF-Tus with C-terminal extensions are used for translation are already known: SelB in some bacteria and its equivalents in mammalian systems (43Kromayer M. Wilting R. Tormay P. Böck A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 44Fagegaltier D. Hubert N. Yamada K. Mizutani T. Carbon P. Krol A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4796-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and EF-Tu in mammalian mitochondria (27Woriax V.L. Burkhart W. Spremulli L.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The former is specific for selenocysteinyl-tRNA, which is involved in decoding a particular UGA stop codon by recognizing both the tRNA and the stem-loop structure of mRNA occurring just behind the UGA codon in bacterial systems. The long C-terminal extension (domain 4) with about 250 amino acid residues is considered to be involved in the recognition of the stem-loop structure (43Kromayer M. Wilting R. Tormay P. Böck A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We attempted to align the C. elegans mt EF-Tu domain 3′ sequence with the SelB domain 4 sequence in some bacteria, but no appreciable homology was observed, suggesting that the function of domain 3′ in nematode mt EF-Tu is different from domain 4 in SelB. C-terminal extensions comprising 11 amino acid residues observed in mammalian mt EF-Tus (Fig. 1) (27Woriax V.L. Burkhart W. Spremulli L.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 45Ling M. Merante F. Chen H.S. Duff C. Duncan A.M. Robinson B.H.

Biol. 2000; 297: 421-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) may possess a role in compensating for some incomplete tertiary structures of mammalian mt tRNAs, such as a lack of tertiary interaction between the T and D arms at the elbow region or the presence of a slightly shorter T stem (1Sprinzl M. Horn C. Brown M. Loudovitch A. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar,47Wakita K. Watanabe Y. Yokogawa T. Kumazawa Y. Nakamura S. Ueda T. Watanabe K. Nishikawa K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), a possibility supported by the fact that bacterial EF-Tu possessing no such extension binds to mammalian mt tRNAs less efficiently than mammalian mt EF-Tu (48Kumazawa Y. Schwartzbach C.J. Liao H.X. Mizumoto K. Kaziro Y. Miura K. Watanabe K. Spremulli L.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). 3T. Ohtsuki and K. Watanabe, unpublished results. Domains 1 and 2 of mammalian mt EF-Tu may also contribute to such compensation (discussed below). However, because no homology is observed between this extension and domain 3′ of the C. elegans mt EF-Tu, the nematode domain 3′ function also seems to differ from that of the C-terminal extension of mammalian mt EF-Tu. With regard to the other domains, there is considerable homology among amino acid residues in both domains 1 and 2 between the nematode and the other mt EF-Tus, whereas the residues in domain 3 are quite different. The residues in contact with GTP (colored orangein Fig. 1) (49Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 721-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 50Berchtold H. Reshetnikova L.

Kjeldgaard M. Thirup S. Polekhina G. Reshetnikova L. Clark B.F. Nyborg J. Science. 1995; 270: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar), all of which are dispersed through domains 1 and 2, are highly conserved among these EF-Tus. The residues characteristic for mt EF-Tus (purple) (41Kuhlman P. Palmer J.D. Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 1057-1070Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) are also well conserved. Only the residues in contact with the T stem, which are located in domain 3 (red) (9Nissen P. Thirup S. Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. Structure. 1999; 7: 143-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), are quite different in the nematode mt EF-Tu compared with the other mt EF-Tus, which is quite reasonable considering that nematode mt EF-Tu has no target T stem in the mt tRNA (see below) and lost binding ability to conventional tRNA having a T stem (Fig. 3 B). The results presented here strongly suggest that the immunodetectable protein (Fig. 2) is actually the nematode mt EF-Tu, which, as shown in Fig. 3, specifically recognizes T stem-lacking tRNA. To substantiate the contention that the protein is an EF-Tu, we also attempted poly(U)-dependent poly(Phe) synthesis in vitrousing the protein. Although the nematode mt EF-Tu was found not to work in an E. coli system, it only slightly stimulated poly(U)-dependent poly(Phe) synthesis using E. coli Phe-tRNAPhe in a bovine in vitrotranslation system (data not shown), despite very low affinities of the nematode mt EF-Tu toward E. coli Phe-tRNAPhe. Nematode mt Phe-tRNAPhe functioned neither on bovine mt ribosomes nor on E. coli ribosomes.

The listericidal mechanism of action involves activation of NADPH oxidase and inducible nitric-oxide synthase to produce reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediate radicals, respectively.

These findings reveal the importance of Rab5a as the responsible factor mediating the listericidal action of interferon-γ. Active Rab5a causes remodeling of the phagosomal environment, facilitates the translocation of Rac2 to LM phagosomes, and regulates the activity of this GTPase.

Clin. Infect. Dis. 1997; 24: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). L. monocytogenes entry into the host cell is an active process involving several protein components. After a short phagosomal period (∼30 min), L. monocytogenes escapes to the cytosol, avoids intracellular killing, and replicates (reviewed in Ref. 2Portnoy D.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1992; 4: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The L. monocytogenes survival mechanism involves two steps: (i) live bacteria avoid phagosome maturation by inactivation of the endosomal trafficking regulator Rab5a, which blocks the recruitment of lysosomal proteins to the phagosomes (Lamp-1 and cathepsin-D) (3Alvarez-Dominguez C. Roberts R. Stahl P.D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 731-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and (ii) secretion by L. monocytogenes of listeriolysin and PI-PLC lyses the phagosomal membrane, translocates L. monocytogenes to the cytoplasm, and consequently, allows forL. monocytogenes intracellular survival (4Portnoy D.A. Chakraborty T. Goebel W. Cossart P. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 1263-1267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Control of L. monocytogenes infection and clearance is an interferon-γ (IFN-γ)1-dependent process. IFN-γ priming of macrophages (MØs) recruited at the inflammatory site triggers their listericidal abilities (5Unanue E.R. Immunol. Rev. 1997; 158: 11-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). IFN-γ signaling modulates the expression and activation of more than 200 proteins (6Der S.D. Zhou A. Williams BRG Silverman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15623-15628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar). However, to date, only a few of these molecules have been shown to exert a direct role in pathogen elimination (7Bach E. Auguet M. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 563-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Among these are (i) IGTP, a GTP-binding protein relevant for Toxoplasmaclearance (8Taylor G.A. Collazo C.M. Yap G. Nguyen K. Gregorio T.A. Taylor L.S. Eagleson B. Secrest L. Southeon E.A. Reid S.N. Tessarrollo L. Bray M. McVicor D.N. Komshlies K.L. Young H.A. Biron C.A. Sher A. Vande Wonde G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, IFN-γ induces the production of reactive oxygen (ROI) and nitrogen (RNI) intermediates with microbicidal activity (10Shiloh M.U. MacMicking J.D. Nicholson S. Brause J.E. Potter S. Marino M. Fang F. Dinauer M. Nathan C. Immunity. 1999; 10: 29-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). From this set of molecules, only ROI and RNI have been shown to restrict L. monocytogenes growth (10Shiloh M.U. MacMicking J.D. Nicholson S. Brause J.E. Potter S. Marino M. Fang F. Dinauer M.

Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2855-2866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that in resting MØs the inhibition of Rab5a synthesis allows for intracellular survival of a listeriolysin-defective L. monocytogenes mutant, that under normal Rab5a levels is unable to grow and fails to escape from the phagosome (12Alvarez-Dominguez C. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11459-11462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have also described that IFN-γ signaling up-regulates Rab5a function (13Alvarez-Dominguez C. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33901-33904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, at this stage, no correlation between the induction of ROI and RNI by IFN-γ and the Rab5a function has been established. Here, we show that Rab5a is a key molecule for the IFN-γ promoted clearance of a pathogenic L. monocytogenes strain at the phagosomal stage. We show that Rab5a, in the GTP form, controls the recruitment of active Rac2 to the transformed L. monocytogenes phagolysosome and the assembly of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase with the production of toxic radicals. These Rab5a-mediated actions compromise Listeria viability within the phagolysosomes and further L. monocytogenesintracellular survival.

After 15 min of uptake, cells were incubated for 45 min in medium containing 5 μg/ml gentamicin to kill extracellular bacteria. This time period was considered 0 h. Infected cells were then incubated at 37 °C in complete medium containing 5 μg/ml gentamicin for 16 h in the presence or absence of 100 units/ml IFN-γ, washed, lysed, and plated onto brain heart infusion agar plates (37 °C, 36 h). The number of live bacteria was estimated by counting CFU. To estimate the percentage of growth, the ratio of CFU recovered at 16 h divided by the CFU recovered at 0 h was expressed as the replication index. Phagosomes were purified from 30-min (Western experiments) or 1-h (viability experiments) infection protocols. L. monocytogenes-infected cells were pretreated or not with IFN-γ (16 h). For phagosome-lysosome fusion assays, cells were offered HRP (100 μg/ml, 5 min, washed and chased for 2 h). Cells were infected with L. monocytogenes for 30 min. Postnuclear supernatants from these cells were applied to a 8.8–20-40% discontinuous sucrose gradient and L. monocytogenes phagosomes recovered from the 20–40% interface and lower 20% sucrose fraction as previously reported (13Alvarez-Dominguez C. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33901-33904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Phagosomes were solubilized with PBS-0.05% Triton X-100 and plated onto brain heart infusion-agar plates to count CFU or added to 4× Laemmli sample buffer for Western blots. For phagosome-lysosome fusion assays, HRP reaction was evaluated with o-dianisidine as a substrate. HRP was measured in postnuclear supernatants and considered the total HRP. Results were expressed as the percentage of total absorbance values of HRP activity per mg of protein. 30 μg of phagosomal proteins per lane were loaded for Western blots. Phagosomes were normalized using anti-Rab5c marker as a standard, since this marker does not vary upon IFN-γ or antisense treatment. Normalization was also performed after analysis with a rabbit anti-Listeria protein antiserum, to check the same level of Listeria proteins onto phagosomes. Antibody dilutions were as follows: mouse anti-Rab5a and rabbit anti-Rab5c, anti-Rac2, and anti-Listeria antibodies (1:1000); rabbit anti-cathepsin-D and anti-Limp-II and rat anti-mouse Lamp-1 and anti-mouse TfR (1:500); and rabbit anti-Rab7 (1:300). Cells (5 × 106/ml) were labeled with 50 μCi of [35S]Met/Cys promix for 2 h. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described (13Alvarez-Dominguez C. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33901-33904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Beads were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation buffer (1% PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5% SDS), radioimmune precipitation buffer plus 500 mm NaCl, and PBS. Elution was performed with 1× Laemmli sample buffer for 1 h at room temperature. J774 cells treated with antisense/sense oligonucleotides, incubated with (+) or without (−) IFN-γ for 16 h and labeled with 50 μCi of [35S]Met/Cys promix as above, were homogenized in HBE buffer (250 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EGTA, 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2) with a ball bearing homogenizer. Homogenates were spun down at 2000 × g to remove nuclei and large organelles, and supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to obtain total membranes (M) and cytosols (C) (supernatants) (see Fig. 2). Pellets were resuspended in HBE buffer, and supernatants were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and resuspended in the same volume as pellets. All samples were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and immunoprecipitations were performed as above. These assays were performed as previously reported for Rac2 (15Bernard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). In brief, cells (2 × 107 cells/assay) were treated with Rab5a antisense/sense oligonucleotides for 6 h and incubated with 100 units/ml IFN-γ 16 h. Accordingly, similar assays were performed in transient overexpressed cells with Rab5a:Q79L, Rab5a:S34N, Rab5c:Q80L, or pcDNA3 cDNAs. L. monocytogenes phagosomes or whole cells were then washed in HBSS-g and lysed in a 2× lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, 2% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate). Lysates placed on ice were clarified by 20,000 × g centrifugation at 4 °C, and 8 μg of GST-PBD was added. Binding buffer (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mmMgCl2, 40 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40), and glutathione-Sepharose were added for 90 min at 4 °C with shaking (a total of 300 μl). Washings were performed with binding buffer. The bead pellets were resuspended in 1× Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE, transferred to membranes, and blotted for the appropriate GTPase using antibody R786/9 (Rac2). ECL detected immunoblots. Total putative activated protein from each sample was obtained by treatment with 100 μm GTPγS for 15 min at 30 °C before GST-PBD incubation. This assay was performed essentially as previously described (16Leyva-Cobian F. Carrasco-Marin E. Immunol. Lett. 1994; 43: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In brief, proteose peptone-elicited peritoneal MØs (or J774 cells) treated with Rab5a antisense/sense oligonucleotides were plated onto 96-well plates at 3 × 105 cells/well in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phenol red plus 50 μg/ml gentamicin. A solution of 80 μm ferricytochrome c in HBSS-g containing the corresponding stimulus was added (10 or 100 units/ml IFN-γ). Cells were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. The change in absorbance (A 550 nm) obtained in well samples was subtracted from those wells incubated with the same stimulus in the presence of superoxide dismutase (10 μg/ml). Results were expressed as nmol of O⨪2 produced/106 cells in quadruplicate wells. Results were representative of at least seven independent experiments. L. monocytogenes is a facultative intracellular parasite able to infect and replicate inside nonactivated MØs. Once in the phagosome, the bacterium secretes listeriolysin and PI-PLC to lyse the phagosome and escape to the cytoplasm, where it replicates (4Portnoy D.A. Chakraborty T. Goebel W. Cossart P. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 1263-1267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activation of MØs by IFN-γ provokes an increase in the phagocytic rate, partially prevents the escape of L. monocytogenes to the cytosol (17Portnoy D.A. Schreiber R.D. Connelly P. Tilney L.G. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 2141-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and triggers the production of toxic radicals (i.e. ROI and RNI), which lead to the elimination of the microorganism (10Shiloh M.U. MacMicking J.D. Nicholson S. Brause J.E. Potter S. Marino M. Fang F. Dinauer M. Nathan C. Immunity. 1999; 10: 29-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Analysis of phagosomes from infected MØs pulsed with IFN-γ has established that this lymphokine promotes phagosome maturation (18Schaible U.E. Sturgill-Koszycki S. Schlesinger P.H. Russell D.G. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1290-1296PubMed Google Scholar,19Via L.E. Fratti R.A. McFalone M. Pagan-Ramos E. Deretic D. Deretic V. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 897-905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations show that phagosome maturation is an active process that involves the interaction of phagosomes with several organelles (reviewed in Ref. 20Meresse S. Steele-Mortimer O. Moreno E. Desjardins M. Finlay B. Gorvel J.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E183-E188Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). At the molecular level, IFN-γ signaling up-regulates the levels of endosomal/lysosomal proteins, such as cathepsin-D (21Rossman M.D. Maida B.T. Douglas S.D. Cell. Immunol. 1990; 126: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and Rab5a (13Alvarez-Dominguez C. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33901-33904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and down-regulates endosomal markers, such as the mannose and the transferrin receptors, TfR (22Montaner L.J. da Silva R.P. Sun J. Sutlerwala S. Holliushead M. Vaux D. Gordon S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4606-4613PubMed Google Scholar, 23Byrd T.F. Horwitz M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 969-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), while other Rabs remain unaffected (i.e. Rab5b, Rab5c, Rab7, or Rab11) (13Alvarez-Dominguez C. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33901-33904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, until now, the link between the IFN-γ-induced microbicidal effects and the up-regulation of Rab5a has remained elusive. Since IFN-γ triggers the listericidal activity of MØs, we first investigated its action in infected MØs at the phagosomal stage. As shown in Fig. 1, among the typical endosomal markers analyzed in L. monocytogenes isolated phagosomes, Rab5a was clearly increased after IFN-γ treatment (+), whereas Rab5c or Rab7 was unmodified and TfR was down-regulated. Similar data have been reported in studies of whole cell extracts (13Alvarez-Dominguez C. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33901-33904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 23Byrd T.F. Horwitz M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 969-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Isolated phagosomes from MØs not treated with IFN-γ (−) lacked lysosomal markers such as cathepsin-D, Lamp-1 and Limp-II. In contrast, all of these markers were increased in phagosomes from MØs previously pulsed with IFN-γ (+). These results suggested that IFN-γ up-regulated the interactions of phagosomes with late endosomes and lysosomes rather than with early endosomes. IFN-γ promotion of phagosome maturation was accompanied by a significant reduction of the pathogen viability inside the phagosomes (1-h phagosomes in Fig. 1, bar graphs). These results argue that a more rapid entry of this lysosomal environment into the phagosomal space contributes to the killing of the pathogen. Our earlier data showed that within the phagosome, Listeria avoided phagosome maturation by blocking the Rab5a activity (3Alvarez-Dominguez C. Roberts R. Stahl P.D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 731-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Alvarez-Dominguez C. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11459-11462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Since IFN-γ signaling increases the synthesis and enhances the activity of this small GTPase (13Alvarez-Dominguez C. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33901-33904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we next studied whether promotion of phagosome maturation by IFN-γ was mediated by Rab5a and designed the following experimental strategy. Rab5a synthesis was first blocked using phosphothioate antisense oligonucleotides targeted to the Rab5a translation initiation codon, and then an IFN-γ pulse was given (12Alvarez-Dominguez C. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11459-11462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Analysis of phagosomes from MØs treated with Rab5a antisense oligonucleotide (A) showed that this treatment effectively blocked Rab5a expression on phagosomes (A− versus S− cells in Fig. 2 A). Moreover, Rab5a antisense treatment also blocked Rab5a expression even in phagosomes of MØs pulsed with IFN-γ (+) (compare A+ with S+ cells and S− cells with S+ cells, respectively; Fig. 2 A). The inhibition was thus effective at the level of protein synthesis; as shown in Fig. 2 B, this reduction mainly affected membrane-bound Rab5a. Parallel studies of Rab5c and Rab7 levels showed that their expression in phagosomes was not affected by the Rab5a antisense treatment, either alone or in combination with a pulse of IFN-γ (Fig.2 A). On the other hand, the increase in the levels of Lamp-1, Limp-II, and cathepsin-D in phagosomes induced by IFN-γ in control cells (S+), were almost completely abolished in cells treated with Rab5a antisense oligonucleotides (A+). Experiments performed with lysosensor green as a pH indicator showed that IFN-γ treatment decreased MØ vesicle pH, but independently of Rab5a antisense or sense treatment (data not shown). These observations highlighted two important conclusions: (i) Rab5a acquires a novel function upon IFN-γ stimulation that affects the transport of lysosomal proteins to phagosomes, and (ii) the normalL. monocytogenes strategy of blocking transport of newly synthesized lysosomal proteins to phagosomes (3Alvarez-Dominguez C. Roberts R. Stahl P.D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 731-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) can be overcome by the increase in Rab5a function promoted by IFN-γ. IFN-γ induction of Rab5a synthesis has been shown to promote the binding of the GTP form of Rab5a to membranes (13Alvarez-Dominguez C. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33901-33904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This argues that the Rab5a form that controls the transport of lysosomal proteins to the phagosomes should be the GTP form. Our data are also in agreement with a recent report showing a role for rabenosyn-5, a Rab5-GTP-interacting effector protein, in the transport of cathepsin-D from the Golgi complex to lysosomes (24Jahraus A. Tjelle T.E. Berg T. Habermann A. Storrie B. Ullrich O. Griffiths G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30379-30390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). When intracellular growth of L. monocytogenes was studied, there was an inverse correlation between viability, expressed as the replication index, and Rab5a levels. The highest replication index corresponded to Rab5a antisense-treated cells (A−) (Fig. 2 C) that showed no detectable Rab5a levels (Fig. 2 B, Rab5a-IP lanes). A lower replication index was found in Rab5a antisense-treated cells also pulsed with IFN-γ (A+) relative to the controls (S−); the replication index values were 22.5 in A− cells, 9 in A+ cells, and 6.2 in S− cells (Fig. 2 C, white bars). Interestingly, these Rab5a antisense-treated cells pulsed with IFN-γ (A+) expressed detectable Rab5a protein levels (Fig. 2 B, Rab5a-IP lanes). The Rab5a protein expressed in these A+ cells efficiently bound to intracellular membranes, with no detectable pool in the cytosolic fraction (seeM/C distributions on IP-Rab5a lanes; Fig. 2 B). Rab5a antisense treatment blocks the listericidal effect of IFN-γ as shown by the replication index values of 9 in A+ cells compared with a replication index value of 0.18 in S+ cells (Fig.2 C, white bars). This Rab5a antisense treatment also prevented the expression and induction of Rab5a observed in control cells (Fig. 2 B, Rab5a-IP lanes). These results cannot be explained by different L. monocytogenesingestion rates on Rab5a antisense- or Rab5a sense-treated cells (12Alvarez-Dominguez C. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11459-11462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Similarly, intraphagosomal L. monocytogenes viability, expressed as CFU from isolated phagosomes after 1 h of infection, inversely correlated with Rab5a expression on L. monocytogenes phagosomes. The highest viability corresponded to A− phagosomes with the lowest Rab5a levels. The lowest viability corresponded to S+ phagosomes with the highest Rab5a levels, as shown by the viability values ranging from 29 × 104 CFU in A− cells to 16 × 104 CFU in A+ cells, 9 × 104 CFU in S− cells, and 2.7 × 104 CFU in S+ cells (Fig. 2 C, filled bars). We also estimated lysosomal protein synthesis after antisense or sense treatment in the presence or absence of IFN-γ. As shown in Fig.3, synthesis of Lamp-1 or Limp-II was not affected by any of the treatments. IFN-γ increased the synthesis of cathepsin-D, as previously reported (21Rossman M.D. Maida B.T. Douglas S.D. Cell. Immunol. 1990; 126: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), independently of Rab5a antisense or sense treatments. These results confirmed that Rab5a regulated the transport of lysosomal proteins to phagosomes induced by IFN-γ but not the synthesis of lysosomal proteins. Taken together, these results show that IFN-γ-promoted phagosomal maturation depends on Rab5a that more importantly mediated the listericidal effect of IFN-γ on phagosomes, leading to a significant decrease in L. monocytogenes viability. Until now, transport from late endosomes/lysosomes to phagosomes has been suggested to be Rab5a-mediated in resting phagosomes (25Nielsen E. Christoforidis S. Uttenweiler-Joseph S. Miaczynska M. Dewitte F. Wilson M. Hoflack B. Zerial Z. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). However, no report has implicated Rab5a in these transport events from activated MØs; nor has the effect of IFN-γ in stimulating this process been shown. To analyze the role of Rab5a and IFN-γ in this event, we studied the transfer of HRP from preloaded early endosomes (100 μg/ml, HRP uptake for 5 min) or lysosomes (100 μg/ml, HRP uptake for 5 min and 2 h chase) into L. monocytogenesphagosomes. L. monocytogenes phagosomes were isolated from cells treated with antisense/sense oligonucleotides and pulsed with IFN-γ as above. The results shown in Fig.4 indicated that the Rab5a antisense treatment significantly blocked the transfer of HRP from early endosomes to phagosomes. However, under these conditions, IFN-γ treatment did not promote the fusion between early endosomes andL. monocytogenes phagosomes (Fig. 4, white bars). In contrast, IFN-γ clearly promoted the transfer of lysosomal HRP to phagosomes as shown by the increase in HRP values that ranged from 1.8 in S− cells to 4.9 in S+ cells. The most striking finding was that Rab5a antisense treatment strongly blocked the ability of IFN-γ to enhance the transfer of lysosomal HRP to L. monocytogenes phagosomes, as shown by the decrease in HRP values from 4.9 in S+ cells to 2.5 in A+ cells (Fig. 4, filled bars). In summary, the experiments shown in Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 indicated that IFN-γ promoted the delivery of lysosomal proteins to L. monocytogenes phagosomes via a process that was clearly dependent on Rab5a. These results link Rab5a action to the clearance of L. monocytogenes by phagocytes. Moreover, the simplest model to explain the IFN-γ effect on L. monocytogenes phagosome maturation is that it promotes the Rab5a-mediated fusion of phagosomes with late endosomes/lysosomes. These data were in accordance with those reported with the yeast homologue, Ypt51p, or the allelic form, Vps21p, on late transport events (26Singer-Kruger B. Stenmark H. Dusterhoft A. Philippsen P. Yoo J.S. Gallwitz D. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 282-298Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 27Horazdovsky B.F. Busch G.R. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1297-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 28Gerrard S.R. Bryant N.J. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 613-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) as well as in fusion events of latex bead phagosomes with lysosomes from resting MØs (25Nielsen E. Christoforidis S. Uttenweiler-Joseph S. Miaczynska M. Dewitte F. Wilson M. Hoflack B. Zerial Z. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The results presented above clearly indicate that Rab5a regulated the IFN-γ-induced listericidal abilities of MØs at the phagosomal stage. To date, the listericidal mechanisms induced by different signals including IFN-γ rely on the production of ROI and RNI toxic molecules (5Unanue E.R. Immunol. Rev. 1997; 158: 11-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 11Alvarez-Dominguez C. Carrasco-Marin E. Paz-Miguel J.E. Lopez-Mato P. Leyva-Cobian F.

Production of ROI radicals requires translocation of Rac2 to the membranes to assemble an active phagocyte NADPH oxidase complex (31Bastian N.R. Hibbs J.B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), a process triggered by IFN-γ. Only active Rac2 (GTP form) is known to be required to activate the phagocyte NADPH oxidase to produce ROI (32Bokoch G.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 109-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We next analyzed whether Rab5a was involved in the activation of Rac2 and production of ROI radicals regulated by IFN-γ. First, we observed that IFN-γ promoted the translocation of Rac2 to the phagosomes, and this was almost completely abolished by treatment of MØs with Rab5a antisense (Fig.5 A). These results strongly suggested that in the pathway of IFN-γ signaling, Rab5a action acted upstream of rac2. For ROI production, the NADPH oxidase enzyme needs to bind and activate onto the phagosomal membranes (31Bastian N.R. Hibbs J.B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). NADPH oxidase activation correlates with the recruitment of the active form of Rac2 to the membranes (32Bokoch G.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 109-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Recently, a protocol has been described to quantify activated Rac2 in whole cells using the binding domain of the p21-activated kinase 1 that exclusively binds Rac2-GTP (Fig.5 B, GST-PBD lanes) (15Bernard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Using this protocol, we observed that the amount of activated Rac2 in Rab5a antisense-treated cells was significantly lower than in sense-treated cells, both in the absence and presence of IFN-γ (Fig. 5 B, GST-PBD-IP lanes), while the total Rac2 levels remained constant (Fig.5 B, +GTPγs lanes andRac2 lanes). The same results were observed when the study was repeated in isolated L. monocytogenesphagosomes after Rab5a antisense/sense and IFN-γ treatment (data not shown). This observation suggests that measurement of Rac2 activation on whole cell extracts was a valid indicator of the translocation of GTP-active Rac2 to the phagosomes. More interestingly, these findings indicate that Rab5a mediates the IFN-γ-induced Rac2 activation and translocation to the phagosomes. With respect to this, it is not inconceivable that Rab5a-Rac2 may act in conjunction. In fact, Rab5a and the Rac family have been reported to act together in coordinating the process of (re)assembly of stress fibers and focal adhesions (33Imamura H. Takaishi K. Nakano K. Kodama A. Oishi H. Shiozaki H. Monden M. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2561-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) as well as in coordinating EGF receptor signaling and trafficking (34Lanzetti L. Rybin V. Malabarba M.G. Christoforidis S. Scita G. Zerial M. Di Fiore P.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 374-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Activation of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase leads to a functional enzyme able to produce ROI toxic molecules (31Bastian N.R. Hibbs J.B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Next, we studied the role of Rab5a on the IFN-γ-induced production of ROI radicals by a functional phagocyte NADPH oxidase. For this purpose, we used the same Rab5a antisense/sense strategy in the presence and absence of an IFN-γ pulse as above. For ROI production, we used peritoneally elicited MØs due to their higher ROI production levels. Nonetheless, experiments performed in the J774 mØ cell line showed similar results (an average of five different assays were performed (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 5 C, which shows one representative experiment (out of seven), production of ROI correlated perfectly with Rac2 activation and was inhibited by Rab5a antisense treatment. A 1.4-fold inhibition was observed in A− cells compared with S− cells. As expected, IFN-γ treatment induced ROI production in control cells, but interestingly, this ROI induction was 1.6-fold inhibited by the Rab5a antisense treatment. The effect of Rab5a antisense treatment on ROI production correlated well with the effect shown on Rac2 activation (Fig. 5 B) and translocation to the phagosomes (Fig. 5 A). The data show that Rab5a regulates the IFN-γ-mediated Rac2 activation, both by enhancing its translocation from the cytosol to the phagosomes and by locking Rac2 in its active GTP conformation. To address whether Rab5a synthesis alone was sufficient to trigger the effects observed on phagosome-lysosome fusion (Fig. 4) and Rac2-GTP recruitment (Fig. 5), we transiently overexpressed both the active and inactive forms of Rab5a into J774 cells; we also included the active form of another Rab5 isoform expressed onto L. monocytogenesphagosomes, Rab5c, as a control (5a:Q79L, 5a:S34N, and 5c:Q80L, respectively). Overexpression protocols after 24 h of transfection gave 5–7-fold increased levels above controls (cells transfected with vector alone) (Fig. 6 A). Phagosomes (after 30 min of infection) from these cells showed that transfer of HRP from lysosomes was particularly enhanced in Rab5a:Q79L-transfected cells (Fig. 6 B). These results were in accordance with those previously reported for Rab5a:WT-transfected cells (13Alvarez-Dominguez C. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33901-33904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Overexpression with Rab5a-inactive form (5a:S34N) inhibited the phagosome-lysosome fusion enhancement, even below control levels. However, overexpression with the active form of Rab5c, Q80L, showed a very low levels of phagosome-lysosome fusion, similar to control cells and to results reported previously (13Alvarez-Dominguez C. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33901-33904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These data argue that Rab5a synthesis and its activation in the GTP form were sufficient to promote phagosome-lysosome fusion. We also checked whether Rab5a synthesis was able to control the observed rac2-GTP recruitment to phagosomes (Fig. 5 B). To do this, we isolated phagosomes from cells overexpressed with Rab5a or Rab5c cDNAs, as in Fig. 6 A, and analyzed the induction of Rac2 activation and translocation to the phagosomes, using the same protocol as used in Fig. 5 B. As shown in Fig.6 C, Rac2 recruitment was promoted in Rab5a:Q79L-overexpressed cells and was diminished below control levels in Rab5a:S34N-overexpressing cells. It should be noted that cells overexpressing the active Rab5c:Q80L form showed levels similar to the controls. These results clearly indicate that Rab5a-GTP, exclusively, controls the recruitment of Rac2-GTP and that Rab5a action is upstream of Rac2. It is also interesting that another cytokine, the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, could control the growth of the pathogenBrucella abortus also by regulating the interactions with the endosomal compartment (35Pizarro-Cerda J. Desjardins M. Moreno E. Akira S. Gorvel J.P. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3519-3526PubMed Google Scholar). This interaction may transfer bacteria from a relative nonhostile environment to one that contains reducing agents, acid hydrolases, and oxygen radicals (35Pizarro-Cerda J. Desjardins M. Moreno E. Akira S. Gorvel J.P. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3519-3526PubMed Google Scholar). It can be speculated that these ROI, elements of the respiratory burst, also present in the endocytic compartments, can then reach both the Listeria- and Brucella-containing phagosomes under each cytokine situation and compromise the bacterial growth inside the cells. In summary, our results are the first to implicate a small GTPase, Rab5a, in pathogen clearance by phagocytes and to show that this function is induced by IFN-γ action. The novelty of this Rab5a-IFN-γ-mediated function resides in the regulation by this GTPase of two sequential processes in the phagosomes. First, Rab5a-GTP promotes phagosomal maturation by regulating the transport of lysosomal proteins to the phagosomes. Second, it regulates Rac2 activation and the assembly of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase to produce toxic free radicals. The combined effects of these Rab5a actions are a more effective destruction of pathogens. Finally, these Rab5a novel functions acquired by the IFN-γ treatment acted together with another IFN-γ-mediated feature on L. monocytogenes phagosome (i.e. the blockage of the action of the two membrane lyticL. monocytogenes proteins, listeriolysin and PI-PLC).

The ability of rotavirus particles lacking genomic RNA to activate NF-κB suggested that rotavirus proteins direct cell signaling responses. We identified conserved TNFR-associated factor (TRAF) binding motifs within the rotavirus capsid protein VP4 and its N-terminal VP8* cleavage product. TRAFs (-1, -2, and -3) are bound by the rhesus rotavirus VP8* protein through three discrete TRAF binding domains. Expression of VP4 or VP8* from rhesus or human rotaviruses induced a 5–7-fold increase in NF-κB activity and synergistically enhanced TRAF2-mediated NF-κB activation. Mutagenesis of VP8* TRAF binding motifs abolished VP8* binding to TRAFs and the ability of the protein to activate NF-κB. Expression of pathway-specific dominant negative (DN) inhibitors DN-TRAF2 or DN-NF-κB-inducing kinase also abolished VP8*-, VP4-, or rotavirus-mediated NF-κB activation. These findings demonstrate that rotavirus primarily activates NF-κB through a TRAF2-NF-κB-inducing kinase signaling pathway and that VP4 and VP8* proteins direct pathway activation through interactions with cellular TRAFs. In contrast, transcriptional responses from AP-1 reporters were inhibited 5-fold by VP8* and were not activated by rotavirus infection, suggesting the differential regulation of TRAF2 signaling responses by VP8*. VP8* blocked JNK activation directed by TRAF2 or TRAF5 but had no effect on JNK activation directed by TRAF6 or MEKK1. This establishes that fully cytoplasmic rotaviruses selectively engage signaling pathways, which regulate cellular transcriptional responses. These findings also demonstrate that TRAF2 interactions can disengage JNK signaling from NF-κB activation and thereby provide a new means for TRAF2 interactions to determine pathway-specific responses.

Although both TNFα and dsRNA can activate NF-κB, these elements do not appear to play a role in rotavirus-induced NF-κB activation, and the means by which rotavirus particles activate NF-κB but fail to induce TNFα has not been explained. Here we report that the rotavirus capsid protein, VP4, and its VP8* cleavage product contain conserved PXQXT sequences, which are required for binding to cellular TRAFs and for NF-κB activation. Both rotavirus and VP8* selectively direct transcription from κB but not other (activator protein-1 [AP-1], cyclic AMP response element [CRE], serum response element [SRE]) DNA enhancer elements via a TRAF2-NIK-signaling pathway. Consistent with the ability of VP8* to block AP-1 transcription, VP8* inhibited JNK activation directed by TRAF2 and TRAF5 but not other JNK activators, suggesting that VP8* selectively regulates PXQXT-directed TRAF-signaling responses to activate NF-κB and inhibit JNK activation. These findings indicate that rotavirus proteins engage a central cytoplasmic-signaling pathway to selectively direct cellular transcriptional responses and suggest a means for the selective regulation of TRAF2-directed signaling.

Luciferase reporter plasmids containing the indicated number of repeated enhancer sequences upstream of a luciferase gene and positive control MEKK1 and AP1 expression plasmids were obtained from Stratagene: pNF-κB-Luc (TGGGGACTTTCCGC)5, pAP1-Luc (TGACTAA)7, pCRE-Luc (AGCCTGACGTCAGAG)4, pSRE-Luc (AGGATGTCCATATTAGGACCTCT)5, pFC-MEKK, and pFC-AP1. pSV-βgal expression plasmid was from Promega. pBIND, pACT, pBIND-Id, and pACT-MyoD mammalian 2-hybrid plasmids were fromCLONTECH. Expression vectors for RRV VP8* and VP4 were constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification using oligonucleotide pairs below and inserted directionally into pBIND or pEGFP-N (CLONTECH) at the BglII andEcoRI or BamHI and XbaI sites to generate Gal4- or FLAG-tagged proteins. Individual TRAF binding motif sequences within VP8* were amplified using oligos below and inserted into pGEX-KG (BamHI-EcoRI) to generate GST fusion proteins. Specific primers for amplifying coding sequences of VP8* and VP4 were synthesized with 5′-BamHI, EcoRI, orXhoI sites and directionally cloned and sequenced. Mutations were made in VP8* by site-directed mutagenesis as previously described using complimentary primers to each PXQXT site (29Dowling W. Denisova E. LaMonica R. Mackow E.R. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6368-6376Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide pairs are denoted by their nucleotide position in the RRV gene 4 sequence (30Mackow E.R. Shaw R.D. Matsui S.M.

VP8 contained amino acids 1–231 and was amplified by oligos containing bases 10–31 (5“) and 682–702 (3′). RRV VP4 contained amino acids 1–776 and was amplified by oligos containing bases 10–31 (5′) and 2315–2340 (3′). VP8*-TRAF binding domain 1 contained amino acids 1–83 and was amplified by oligos containing bases 10–31 (5′) and 241–258 (3′). VP8*-TRAF binding domain 2 contained amino acids 146–184 and was amplified by oligos containing ATG and bases 458–477 (5′) and 541–570 (3′). VP8*-TRAF binding domain 3 contained amino acids 203–231 and was amplified by oligos containing ATG and bases 619–639 (5′) and 682–702 (3′). Plasmid DNA was extracted by alkaline lysis and purified by CsCl density gradient centrifugation before transfection. The HEK 293 cell line was used for transfection experiments since intestinal cells are poorly transfected. Transient transfections for co-immunoprecipitation experiments, luciferase reporter assays, and Western blotting were performed using FuGene6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or an enhanced Ca3(PO4)2 method as previously described (51O'Mahoney J.V. Adams T.E. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 1227-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). 293 cells (5 × 105) were plated in 6-well plates and at 80% confluence transfected for 4 h with a constant amount of total plasmid DNA in control and experimental wells. Media was replaced, and 24–36 h post-transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed or infected as described above. Cells were lysed on ice for 30 min in luciferase reporter lysis buffer (Promega) or 0.1% Nonidet P-40 immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (52Rothe M. Xiong J. Shu H.B. Williamson K. Goddard A. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8241-8246Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed as above, clarified by centrifugation, precleared with protein A-, protein G-, or glutathione-agarose and incubated with appropriate antibodies for 2 h or overnight at 4 °C. Protein A- or protein G-agarose was added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Alternatively, lysates were incubated with GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-agarose. Beads were washed 5 times with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and bound proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10%) and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blotting. Western blot analysis was performed as previously described (52Rothe M. Xiong J. Shu H.B. Williamson K. Goddard A. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Reactive proteins were detected by chemiluminescence using the ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST or GST fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria (BL21) from pGEX plasmids. Bacteria were grown to an A600 of 0.6 in LB and induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h at 30 °C. GST fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-agarose resin (Sigma) as previously described (31Denisova E. Dowling W. LaMonica R. Shaw R. Scarlata S. Ruggeri F. Mackow E.R. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3147-3153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bound GST proteins were washed extensively in phosphate-buffered saline and eluted with 10 mm glutathione, and protein was quantitated by Bio-Rad protein assay. GST or GST fusion proteins (25 μg) bound to glutathione-agarose were used to precipitate proteins from cell lysates. Cells were transfected in duplicate or triplicate as above with constant amounts of plasmid DNAs including luciferase reporter plasmids, a β−galactosidase expression plasmid (pSV-βgal), and experimental and reporter plasmids. After lysis, luciferase reporter assays were performed in duplicate and read in a Turner Designs luminometer (TD-20/20). 10 μl of lysate was added to 50 μl of assay buffer (Promega) and quantitated for 15 s. Luciferase activity was normalized to relative amounts of β-galactosidase activity present within each lysate as previously described (53Devergne O. Hatzivassiliou E. Izumi K.M. Kaye K.M. Kleijnen M.F. Kieff E. Mosialos G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7098-7108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All experiments were repeated multiple times. Error bars represent the range of normalized luciferase responses among replicate samples, and representative experiments are presented. VP8* was cloned into pBIND, and TRAF2 was cloned into pACT mammalian 2-hybrid vectors fused to GAL4 or VP16 proteins, respectively. These plasmids as well as control pBIND and pACT or known interactive positive controls pBIND-Id and pACT-MyoD were transfected into 293 cells along with the GAL4-luciferase reporter plasmid, pG5luc, as indicated. pBIND-Id contains the inhibitor of DNA-binding protein (Id), and pACT-MyoD contains the muscle determination factor MyoD fused to binding and activation domain elements, respectively (54Finkel T. Duc J. Fearon E.R. Dang C.V. Tomaselli G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Identical amounts of DNA were transfected into each well. Lysates were harvested 36 h post-transfection and quantitated as above. Two assays were used to monitor JNK activation. A phospho-JNK antibody Western blot assay was used to detect phosphorylated JNK from cells transfected with TRAF and VP8* plasmids. Briefly, an identical amount of plasmid DNA was transfected into 293 cells using a pNGFP plasmid control. Cell lysates were prepared, standardized by β-galactosidase activity within lysates, and immunoprecipitated with anti-JNK1 antibody and subsequently assayed for JNK1 activation by Western blotting with an antibody specific for phosphorylated JNK1 protein. A radiolabeled c-Jun phosphorylation assay was used to assay the ability of VP8* to inhibit TRAF5-, TRAF6-, and MEKK1- directed JNK activation. 293 cells were transfected, and 36 h post-transfection lysates were standardized by β-galactosidase activity and assayed for their ability to phosphorylate GST-c-Jun-(1–79) as previously described (Stratagene) (55Yan M.

In HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with BKCa channels, we observed that the NO donor sodium nitroprusside and the membrane-permeable analog of cGMP, dibutyryl cGMP, were both able to enhance BKCa channel activity 4–5-fold in cell-attached membrane patches. This enhancement correlated with an endogenous cGMP-dependent protein kinase activity and the presence of the α isoform of type I cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGKI). We observed that co-transfection of cells with BKCa channels and a catalytically inactive (“dead”) mutant of human cGKIα prevented enhancement of BKCa channel in response to either sodium nitroprusside or dibutyryl cGMP in a dominant negative fashion. In contrast, expression of wild-type cGKIα supported enhancement of channel activity by these two agents. Importantly, both endogenous and expressed forms of cGKIα were found to associate with BKCa channel protein, as demonstrated by a reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation strategy. In vitro, cGKIα was able to directly phosphorylate immunoprecipitated BKCa channels, suggesting that cGKIα-dependent phosphorylation of BKCa channels in situ may be responsible for the observed enhancement of channel activity. In summary, our data demonstrate that cGKIα alone is sufficient to promote the enhancement of BKCa channels in situ after activation of the NO/cGMP signaling pathway.

Similarly, elevation of cGMP by the phosphodiesterase inhibitor sildenafil (Viagra) (3Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. J. Biol.

Although the exact mechanism(s) by which elevated cGMP causes smooth muscle relaxation has not been clearly defined, cGMP is known to influence a number of cellular processes (4Pfeifer A. Ruth P. Dostmann W. Sausbier M. Klatt P. Hofmann F. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 135: 105-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), such as the levels of cytosolic free calcium, myosin light chain dephosphorylation (5Surks H.K. Mochizuki N. Kasai H. Georgescu S.P.

Physiologically, BKCa channels appear to be important cellular effectors for the vasodilatory actions of the NO/cGMP signaling pathway because blockade of BKCachannels can interfere with the relaxation-promoting effects of NO (16Bialecki R.A.

A major intracellular target for cGMP in smooth muscle is the type I cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGKI), a serine/threonine protein kinase that is widely expressed in mammalian tissues (19Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 26: 115-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 20Smolenski A. Burkhardt A.M. Eigenthaler M. Butt E. Gambaryan S. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Pflüegers Archiv. 1998; 358: 134-139Google Scholar). This kinase is encoded by a single gene, which gives rise to two alternatively spliced isoforms, α and β, differing only in their N-terminal domains (36% of the first 103 amino acids of the β isoform are identical to those of the α isoform) (19Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 26: 115-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 21Lohmann S.M. Vaandrager A.B. Smolenski A. Walter U. De Jonge H.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 307-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Both the α and β isoforms of the type I cGMP-dependent protein kinase functionally exist as homodimers (i.e.α/α and β/β), in which each subunit contains a catalytic domain, 2 cGMP-binding sites, and an N-terminal dimerization region (4Pfeifer A. Ruth P. Dostmann W. Sausbier M. Klatt P. Hofmann F. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 135: 105-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,19Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Adv.

Biochem. 1992; 208: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), although the biological roles of each are not well understood. To examine the role played by cGKIα in the activation of cellular BKCa channels by the NO/cGMP signaling cascade, we created a catalytically inactive or “dead” mutant of cGKIα that could be co-expressed with murine BKCa channels. Utilizing a dominant negative suppression strategy (23Herskowitz I. Nature. 1987; 329: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar, 24Sheppard D.N. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1994; 11: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we observed that dead cGKIα prevented activation of BKCa channels in cell-attached patches of HEK 293 cells in response to the nitrovasodilator sodium nitroprusside (SNP) or dibutyryl cGMP, a membrane-permeable analog of cGMP. Using a reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation strategy, we found that the endogenous and expressed forms of cGKIα were able to associate with BKCachannel protein. We also observed that cGKIα is able to directly phosphorylate BKCa channels in vitro, supporting the hypothesis that a similar event may be responsible for the enhancement of channel activity by cGMP in situ. Taken together with previous observations, our results strongly suggest that the α isoform of type I cGMP-dependent protein kinase represents a major downstream effector in the activation of BKCa channels by the NO/cGMP signaling pathway in situ. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the mouse BKCachannel α subunit and the human type I cGMP-dependent protein kinase were obtained from Chemicon International and Calbiochem, respectively. A horseradish peroxidase-linked, mouse anti-rabbit IgG monoclonal antibody (clone RG-96) was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. The purified, recombinant cGMP-dependent protein kinase Iα enzyme was purchased from Calbiochem. The cGMP-dependent protein kinase-selective peptide substrate RKRSRAE was obtained from Peninsula Laboratories. The Lowry protein assay kit (detergent compatible) was purchased from Bio-Rad Laboratories. The cDNAs encoding the mouse BKCa channel (mSlo) α subunit (25Pallanck L. Ganetzky B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1239-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), the wild-type green fluorescent protein (26Chalfie M. Tu Y. Euskirchen G. Ward W.W. Prasher D.C. Science. 1994; 263: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (5403) Google Scholar), and the human cGKIα (27Orstavik S. Natarajan V. Tasken K. Jahnsen T. Sandberg M. Genomics. 1997; 42: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) were subcloned into the polylinker region of the SV40 promoter-based mammalian expression plasmid SRα using standard techniques. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the Transformer mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH), which is based upon the unique restriction site elimination strategy (28Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). The enzymatically dead form of cGKIα was prepared by a Lys to Met substitution at amino acid position 393 within the kinase's catalytic domain. Transient transfection of HEK 293 cells (50–80% confluence) was carried out in 35-mm tissue culture dishes using the lipofection technique. Briefly, 6–8 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) was mixed together with ∼1.5 μg of plasmid cDNA in 1 ml of serum-free culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with l-glutamine and 4.5 g/literd-glucose) and placed on cells for 4–6 h in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. DNA-containing medium was then aspirated and replaced with serum-containing medium. The following day, cells were detached from the dish by treatment with 0.05% (w/v) trypsin/0.5 mm EDTA and replated onto sterile glass coverslips. Electrophysiological recordings were performed on days 3–5 after transfection (day 1). For biochemical studies, cells detached from 35-mm dishes were replated onto 100-mm dishes to prevent overgrowth. These cells were then harvested on days 3–4 after transfection. Macroscopic currents were recorded at 35 ± 0.5 °C from cell-attached membrane patches of HEK 293 cells using an Axopatch 200B patch clamp amplifier and pClamp 6.03 software. BKCa channel currents were activated by voltage clamp pulses delivered from a holding potential of 0 mV to membrane potentials ranging from −90 to +150 mV; tail currents were recorded at −80 mV. Current traces were filtered at 2–5 kHz (4-pole Bessel filter) and acquired on a Dell Pentium II-based computer at a sampling frequency of 8–10 kHz using a Digidata 1200 analog/digital interface. Recording micropipettes were pulled from thin-walled borosilicate glass capillaries (1.2 mm inner diameter; 1.5 mm outer diameter; WPI, Sarasota, FL) using a Sutter P-89 horizontal electrode puller. Micropipettes were filled with a solution containing 5 mmKCl, 140 mm KOH, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.3 with methanesulfonic acid) and had tip resistances of 2–3.5 megaohms. The bath solution contained 5 mm KCl, 140 mm KOH, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and10 mm HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.3 with methanesulfonic acid). The recording chamber (∼0.3 ml volume) was perfused by gravity flow at a constant rate of 1–1.5 ml/min, using a set of manually controlled solenoid valves to switch between solutions. Reagents were added directly to the solution reservoir tubes at the concentrations indicated. Transfected HEK 293 cells seeded on coverslips were placed in a temperature-controlled recording chamber on the stage of a Nikon Eclipse TE300 inverted microscope. Individual cells expressing BKCa channels were then identified visually by co-expression of the marker protein green fluorescent protein under epifluorescence using 480 nm excitation and 510 nm emission filters. Transfected cells were detached on day 3 by a brief incubation with sterile phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% trypsin/0.5 mm EDTA, centrifuged in 15-ml culture tubes at ∼100 × g for 5 min, and stored at −80 °C as intact cell pellets. These pellets were resuspended in 0.5–1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, and 5 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin A, and aprotinin and then sonicated for 5–10 s to shear the genomic DNA. After measurements of protein concentration were carried out using a modified Lowry procedure (29Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), lysates were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer containing 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol and incubated for 20–30 min at 70 °C, and the proteins were then separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205463) Google Scholar). The resolved proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane at 4 °C in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and 20% (v/v) methanol for either ∼2 h at 80–90 V or overnight at 35 V (31Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44639) Google Scholar). Membranes were first dried in a fume hood to fix proteins and then rinsed briefly in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (TTBS). Membranes were incubated at room temperature for 20–30 min in TTBS containing 10% (w/v) skim milk powder to block nonspecific binding of antibodies and then rinsed three times for 5 min each time in TTBS. Incubation of membranes with primary antibodies was carried out in TTBS containing 1% (w/v) skim milk powder for 1–2 h at room temperature, followed by three to five 10-min washes with TTBS alone. Membranes were then incubated for ∼1 h at room temperature with a horseradish peroxidase-linked, mouse anti-rabbit secondary antibody also diluted in TTBS/1% (w/v) skim milk powder, followed by three to five 5-min washes with TTBS. After the final wash, blots were developed immediately by applying the SuperSignal chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce Chemical Co.) for ∼2 min and then exposing the blots to x-ray film (Hyperfilm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). This assay was performed as described previously by Wolfeet al. (32Wolfe L. Francis S.H. Landiss L.R. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16906-16913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Transiently transfected HEK 293 cells growing on a 100-mm culture dish (50–80% confluence) were harvested in 1 ml of lysis buffer, sonicated for 5–10 s on ice, and then centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C at 15,000 rpm using a microcentrifuge. The supernatants were removed and kept on ice. The assay of cGMP-dependent protein kinase activity was performed at 30 °C in a final reaction volume of 60 μl containing (final concentrations) 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm DTT, 20 μm cGMP, 0.1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 160 μm synthetic peptide substrate (RKRSRAE) (33Glass D.B. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1196-1200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 200 μm Na2-ATP (radiospecific activity, 150–300 cpm/pmol). After the addition of 20–50 μg of soluble cell lysate to start the reaction, incubation was carried out for 10 min and stopped by spotting a 30-μl aliquot of the reaction mixture onto a P-81 phosphocellulose disc (Whatman). Discs were then placed immediately in 0.5% (v/v) phosphoric acid, washed for 3 × 5 min in 500 ml of 0.5% phosphoric acid, rinsed briefly with acetone, and dried. Radioactivity bound to the paper discs was quantified by Cerenkov counting using a Beckman LS6000 liquid scintillation counter. The BKCa α subunit was immunoprecipitated from transiently transfected HEK 293 cells as follows: on day 3–4 after transfection, cells growing on a 100-mm dish were harvested in 1 ml of lysis buffer, sonicated briefly, and then centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C at 15,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant was diluted to 0.4–0.5 mg protein/ml, and a 1.4-ml aliquot of the diluted lysate was transferred to a clean microcentrifuge tube. Bovine serum albumin was then added to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. This sample was pre-cleared by the addition of 30 μl of a 50% slurry (v/v) of rehydrated protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), followed by rotation at 4 °C for 1 h. Samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 rpm to pellet the beads, and the soluble material was transferred to a clean microcentrifuge tube. Pre-cleared supernatants were then incubated for 4–16 h at 4 °C with ∼1.5 μg of anti-BKCa channel antibody, followed by further incubation for 2 h with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (50% slurry). The beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C for 5 min at 3,000 rpm and then washed twice by resuspension in 1 ml of wash buffer containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 5 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A, followed by a final wash in the same buffer minus Triton X-100. The beads were then resuspended in 20–30 μl of a buffer containing 20 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, and 2 mm DTT; 15-μl aliquots were used directly in the assay. The phosphorylation reaction was carried out for 20 min at 30 °C in a final volume of 40 μl containing (final concentrations) 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 20 μm cGMP, 5,000 units of recombinant bovine type Iα cGMP-dependent protein kinase, and 15 μl of resuspended protein A-Sepharose beads containing immunoprecipitated BKCa α subunit. The reaction was started by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP (20 μm; final concentration, 20,000–30,000 cpm/pmol) and stopped by addition of concentrated (4×) Laemmli sample buffer directly to the assay tubes. Reaction mixtures were then resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were stained and destained and then directly exposed to x-ray film in a Kodak BioMax cassette at room temperature for 12–24 h. After transient expression of cGKIa and BKCachannel cDNAs, either alone or together, the immunoprecipitation protocol was carried out as described above, with minor modifications. Upon addition of 0.5–1.0 ml of lysis buffer, cells were kept on ice for 20–30 min and then disrupted by 10–12 up and down strokes of a disposable plastic pestle designed to fit 1.5-ml Eppendorf centrifuge tubes. For immunoprecipitation of cGKIα, ∼4 μg of rabbit polyclonal anti-cGKI antibody (Calbiochem) was added to each pre-cleared cellular lysate. Subsequent steps in the protocol were unchanged. A one-way analysis of variance was used to determine statistical significance among groups of values; mean values were considered to be significantly different at a level ofp < 0.05. To examine the functional importance of cGKIα in the regulation of BKCa channels by cGMP and the nitrovasodilator compound SNP, we hypothesized that a catalytically inactive mutant of cGKIα could be used in a dominant negative strategy (23Herskowitz I. Nature. 1987; 329: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar, 24Sheppard D.N. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1994; 11: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) to suppress or interfere with the actions of endogenous cGKIα in an intact cell. Earlier reports have shown that native HEK 293 cells contain an endogenous cGMP-dependent protein kinase activity (15Fukao M. Mason H.S. Britton F.C. Kenyon J.L. Horowitz B. Keef K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10927-10935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 34Dinerman J.L. Steiner J.P. Dawson T.M. Dawson V. Snyder S.H.

Chem. 1998; 273: 2458-2466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar); our new data, described below, strongly suggest that this activity can be accounted for by the presence of the α isoform of type I cGMP-dependent protein kinase in these cells. To prepare a catalytically inactive mutant of human cGKIα (27Orstavik S. Natarajan V. Tasken K. Jahnsen T. Sandberg M. Genomics. 1997; 42: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we replaced a critical lysine residue (Lys393) in the ATP-binding motif of the enzyme's catalytic domain with methionine (36Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar, 37Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2250) Google Scholar). The effectiveness of this substitution was verified using two complementary biochemical approaches. First, an in vitrokinase assay was performed using soluble cell lysates from HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with cDNA constructs encoding a BKCa channel α subunit together with either the wild-type or mutant form of cGKIα. Fig. 1 shows that the detergent-solubilized lysate from cells transfected with the BKCa channel cDNA alone displayed modest cGMP-dependent protein kinase activity, as quantified by measuring phosphorylation of a cGKI-selective peptide substrate (33Glass D.B. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1196-1200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of cGMP, substrate phosphorylation was increased ∼2-fold above background levels observed in the absence of cGMP, and this activity was comparable to that present in mock-transfected cells. However, cGMP-dependent substrate phosphorylation was strongly enhanced (∼8-fold) in the lysate from cells co-transfected with BKCa channels and wild-type cGKIα, demonstrating expression of intact, biochemically active protein kinase. In contrast to this situation, cells transiently transfected with BKCachannels and the catalytically inactive or dead form of cGKIα displayed a level of cGMP-dependent kinase activity that was very similar to that of cells transfected with BKCachannels alone. This finding is thus consistent with results using other protein kinases (36Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar, 38Hanson P.I. Meyer T. Stryer L. Schulman H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 943-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), in which mutation of this invariant lysine residue within the catalytic domain is sufficient to block expression of enzymatic activity. It is interesting that co-expression of dead cGKIα did not lower the total observable cGMP-dependent protein kinase activity measured in vitro. This observation may be due to: (a) transfection efficiency of HEK 293 cells with the LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) ranges from 20–30% in our hands; therefore, endogenous cGMP-dependent activity in the majority of cells remains unaffected, and (b) the assay mixture for cGMP-dependent protein kinase activity contains saturating concentrations of Mg-ATP, cGMP, and peptide substrate, therefore the presence of inactive kinase molecules would not be expected to interfere with the activity of native kinase by depletion of essential reagents in vitro. Fig.2 A shows a Western blot of the detergent-soluble cellular lysates used for the in vitro kinase assays shown in Fig. 1. Using an anti-cGKI antibody, we observed modest expression of an endogenous immunoreactive protein with a molecular mass of ∼75 kDa, corresponding to the α isoform of cGKI (22Keilbach A. Ruth P. Hofmann F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). No expression of a 78–80-kDa β isoform was detected in our HEK 293 cells, although both α and β isoforms were readily observed under the same Western blotting conditions in isolated smooth muscle myocytes from rabbit aorta (data not shown). In contrast, HEK 293 cells co-transfected with cDNAs encoding either the wild-type or mutant form of cGKIα showed very strong expression of a similar 75-kDa band, consistent with the presence of exogenous cGKIα protein. The lower immunoreactive bands with a molecular mass of ∼60 kDa most likely represent proteolytic fragments of the full-length wild-type and mutant cGKIα (19Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 26: 115-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Taken together, the results shown in Figs. 1 and2 A demonstrate that both the wild-type and mutant forms of recombinant human cGKIα can be strongly expressed in HEK 293 cells, with only the wild-type enzyme displaying significant cGMP-dependent kinase activity. We then examined whether co-transfection of cGKIα influenced the expression pattern of BKCa channels themselves. Fig. 2 B shows a Western blot of the same cellular extracts used in Fig. 2 A,which was probed with an antibody against the BKCa channel α subunit. A single immunoreactive band of ∼125 kDa was observed, the level of which was comparable under all three transfection conditions. Similar results were obtained in two additional experiments. Taken together, these observations demonstrate that co-transfection of HEK 293 cells with either wild-type or mutant cGKIα cDNA leads to the expected expression of both protein and kinase activity, without altering the expression pattern of BKCa channel protein. The functional importance of cGKIα in the regulation of BKCa channels was examined by using patch clamp techniques to record BKCa channel activity in cell-attached membrane patches of transfected HEK 293 cells in the absence and presence of 100 μm SNP. Fig.3 A shows BKCachannel activity before and during bath application of 100 μm SNP. In the absence of SNP, a modest level of BKCa channel activity was observed, the magnitude of which varied from cell to cell. However, after ∼4 min of exposure to SNP, we observed a large increase in the amplitude of BKCa channel macroscopic current; this increase typically peaked during 2–6 min of exposure and was reversible over several minutes upon washout of SNP from the bath (Fig. 3 C). SNP produced an average increase of ∼4-fold in current magnitude compared with control, as quantified in Fig.3 C. This observation is thus consistent with recent findings reported by Fukao et al. (15Fukao M. Mason H.S. Britton F.C. Kenyon J.L. Horowitz B. Keef K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10927-10935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) using whole cell voltage clamp methodologies that SNP could augment the activity of canine colonic BKCa channels expressed in HEK 293 cells. Using our dominant negative strategy, we observed that in cells co-transfected with cDNAs encoding the BKCa channel and the catalytically dead form of cGKIα, the effect of bath-applied SNP on BKCa channel activity was significantly blunted compared with cells expressing BKCa channels alone (Fig. 3,B and C). Interestingly, in cells co-transfected with BKCa channels and wild-type cGKIα, bath application of SNP also produced a large enhancement of BKCa channel activity, although the effect was not signif"

Furthermore, insert deletion enhanced CaM-free electron transfer within nNOS and chimeras with the nNOS reductase, emphasizing the involvement of the insert in modulating electron transfer. Swapping the nNOS and eNOS inserts gave proteins with normal NOS activities, and the nNOS insert acted normally in raising the Ca2+ dependence when placed in eNOS. Insertion of the eNOS insert into iNOS and chimeras with the iNOS reductase domain significantly lowered NOS activity, consistent with inhibition of electron transfer by the insert. Mutation of the eNOS RRKRK to an AAAAA sequence did not alter the eNOS Ca2+ dependence but marginally inhibited electron transfer. The salt dependence suggests that the insert modulates electron transfer within the reductase domain prior to the heme/reductase interface.

One of these differences, a dependence of activity on reversible calmodulin (CaM)1 binding, distinguishes the constitutive neuronal (nNOS) (10Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3130) Google Scholar) and endothelial (eNOS) (11Busse R. Mülsch A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 265: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) isoforms from the inducible (iNOS) isoform (12Cho H.J. Xie Q.W. Calaycay J. Mumford R.A. Swiderek K.M. Lee T.D. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). A second significant difference is provided by the level of catalytic activity, in that eNOS has a relatively low activity of ∼30 nmol of NO/min/nmol of NOS, whereas nNOS and iNOS have higher activities of ∼100 and 150 nmol of NO/min/nmol, respectively. The differences in catalytic activity derive from the relative abilities of the reductase domains to transfer electrons to the heme, a process strictly controlled by CaM activation in the wild-type enzymes (13Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10769-10772Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). A peptide insert of about 50 amino acids in nNOS and eNOS but not iNOS is evident upon alignment and comparison of the sequences of the three isoforms (14Salerno J.C. Harris D.E. Irizarry K. Patel B. Morales A.J. Smith S.M. Martasek P. Roman L.J. Masters B.S. Jones C.L. Weissman B.A. Lane P. Liu Q. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29769-29777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). We have shown in earlier work that this insert helps to lower the rates of electron transfer in eNOS in both the CaM-bound and -unbound states (15Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14692-14698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, removal of the insert from wild-type eNOS or from NOS chimeras in which the native flavin domain of nNOS has been replaced by the eNOS flavin domain leads to proteins that are hyperactive in both overall NO synthesizing activity and in electron transfer from the CaM-bound or -unbound protein to electron acceptors such as cytochrome c and ferricyanide. Conflicting results have been obtained concerning the effect of the autoinhibitory domain on the CaM dependence of activity. In accord with our earlier results on eNOS, Guillemette and co-workers (16Montgomery H.J. Romanov V. Guillemette J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5052-5058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) found that nNOS mutants in which the peptide insert was deleted still required CaM for NOS activity. In contrast, Shimizu and co-workers (17Daff S. Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30589-30595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) reported that removal of the nNOS insert yielded a protein that retained 25% of its activity in the absence of CaM, although this activity was <10% that of wild-type nNOS. We sought to clarify the role of the nNOS insert by excising it from both wild-type nNOS and NOS chimeras in which the reductase domain of other NOS isoforms was replaced by the nNOS reductase domain. The chimera mutants provide a larger sampling of data points and make it possible to determine the effects of the nNOS insert in various protein contexts. This diversity of NOS mutants was further increased by creating NOS proteins that varied solely in the nature of the insert in the reductase domain. In these latter variants, the eNOS and nNOS inserts in the parent proteins were exchanged, and the eNOS insert was added to insertless NOS proteins bearing the iNOS reductase domain, including both wild-type iNOS and a chimera in which the reductase domain of eNOS had been replaced by that from iNOS. Finally, we sought to determine whether a highly basic region in the insert was the primary molecular determinant of the autoinhibitory properties of the eNOS insert, as proposed by Masters and co-workers (14Salerno J.C. Harris D.E. Irizarry K. Patel B. Morales A.J. Smith S.M. Martasek P. Roman L.J. Masters B.S. Jones C.L. Weissman B.A. Lane P. Liu Q. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29769-29777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) based on peptide inhibition studies. We have found that the nNOS insert acts similarly to the eNOS insert in raising the Ca2+ requirement for activity. When placed in the context of eNOS, the nNOS insert can substitute for the native one in this role as well as in maintaining the lower eNOS activity. The eNOS insert, however, does not exert the same full effects in nNOS as it does in its native context. Thus, autoinhibition of Ca2+activation is decreased, thereby lowering the Ca2+requirement; and activity levels are only partially lowered by the presence of the eNOS insert in nNOS. Finally, our results show that the five consecutive basic residues RRKRK implicated by the peptide studies as key features of the eNOS autoinhibitory insert are not actually required, as an insert with all these residues replaced by alanines is still able to fully autoinhibit CaM activation and to fully depress the activity level. The results are discussed in the context of possible structural requirements for the insert. HEPES and agarose were from Fisher. DNA manipulations were done using enzymes, buffers, and reagents from New England Biolabs and purification kits from Qiagen, which also supplied the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized, and the DNA sequenced, by the Biomolecular Resource Center (University of California, San Francisco). All other materials were from Sigma. A Progene thermocycler from Techne (Cambridge, UK) was employed. Mutagenesis was accomplished via standard overlap extension PCR techniques, utilizing as the template previously constructed NOS chimeras (18Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5566-5571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) that possessed engineered NheI splice sites at amino acids 760–761, 538–539, and 527–528 in nNOS, iNOS, and eNOS, respectively. 5′ end primers annealed before or at the NheI splice site, whereas 3′ end primers annealed after preexisting unique sites (AatII in nNOS, BsrGI in iNOS, andKpnI in eNOS). Unless otherwise noted, the standard PCR cycling parameters were 25 cycles of 1 min at each temperature (94 °C melting, 60 °C annealing, and 72 °C extension) followed by a 10-min extension, using ∼0.2 ng/μl template, 0.5 μm primers, 400 μm dNTPs, and 0.02 units/μl Vent® polymerase that possesses 3′ to 5′ proofreading activity. For extension of two overlapping PCR products, 5 cycles were performed without the appropriate end primers, followed by addition of primers and 20 cycles of amplification, and the final 10-min 72 °C extension. For syntheses of overlapping PCR products from megaprimers, a pair of primers (megaprimer and corresponding paired primer) were usually sufficient to give the desired amplification, except in the case of E/I(Einsert), in which three primers were necessary (the megaprimer, its paired primer, and the same-strand primer which produced the megaprimer). The cycling parameters in this case were the same as for overlap extension reactions. The NheI site and another unique site (AatII) downstream of the insert were used to subclone the insert-deleted gene fragment. Specifically, primers 1 and 2 (5′-TAATACTAGT TCCATTCTAC TACTACCAGA and GGGGTCCAGT ACTCTCCATTA AAGCACAGCC GAATTTCTCCC CG) and template pCWori//I/N were used to produce fragment A (25 standard cycles, except the first 5 cycles were at 55 °C annealing). Primers 3 and 4 (AGTACTGGAC CCCTGGCCAA TGTGAGG and TAATTCTAGA TTAGGAGCTG AAAACCTCA) were used to produce fragment B using identical cycling parameters. Equimolar amounts (1 nm) of fragments A and B, plus 500-fold excess primers 1 and 4 and the same cycling parameters produced product AB, which was subcloned via NheI and AatII into chimera pCWori//I/N, yielding deletion chimera pCWori//I/NΔ. Subcloned from pCWori//N/E into pCWori//I/NΔ, the NdeI/NheI nNOS gene fragment corresponding to the heme- and CaM-binding domain of nNOS replaced that of iNOS, yielding pCWori/N/NΔ, hereafter referred to as “nNOSΔ ,” which differs from the true wild-type insert deletion mutant by a T761S mutation resulting from introduction of the NheI chimeric splice site. As serine, the native amino acid in eNOS, is highly homologous and represents a conservative mutation, we believe that this mutant is indistinguishable from the exact nNOSΔ insert deletion mutant. This mutant was produced by subcloning of the NdeI-NheI eNOS heme domain gene fragment from pCWori//E/N (18Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5566-5571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) into pCWori//N/NΔ. These mutants were constructed in the same way as the insert deletion mutants, except that the primers analogous to primers 2 and 3 above were “megaprimers” made via PCR amplification and were composed of the entire insert sequence plus small flanking regions corresponding to 6 and 3 amino acids at the 5′ and 3′ termini, respectively. The megaprimers, which were synthesized using primers 5 and 6 (GGTGGTGACC AGCACCTTTG G and CAGAAGTGGG GGTACGCC) plus template cDNA nNOS or eNOS, anneal to sequences adjacent to the insert sequence that are virtually identical in nucleotide sequence (identical in protein sequence) between eNOS and nNOS isoforms. Amplification of template pCWori//I/N using megaprimer(Einsert) and primer 7 (TAATACTAGT TCCATTCTAC TACTACCAGA) produced fragment C, whereas megaprimer and primer 8 (TAATTCTAGA TTAGGAGCTG AAAACCTCA) produced fragment D. Overlap extension produced product CD, which was subcloned into pCWori//nNOSΔ via the NheI andAatII unique sites. Amplification of template pCWori//I/E using megaprimer(Ninsert) and primer 7 produced fragment E, whereas megaprimer and primer 9 (CCCGGAGGTC GACGAC) produced fragment F. Overlap extension gave product EF, which was subcloned into pCWori//E/EΔ (15Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14692-14698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) via the NheI and KpnI unique sites. The sequence designated the eNOS insert sequence (55 amino acids593MEMSG … ALGTL) was inserted into iNOS, replacing the analogous 10-amino acid sequence,604FMLRELNHTF. Megaprimer(eNOS) was synthesized from template pBluescript/eNOS cDNA and primers 10 (GGCAGACTCT GAAGAAATCT CTGATGGAGA TGTCGGGGCC) and 11 (CAAGGCCAAA CACAGCATAC CTGAGGGTCC CCAGGG). The “outer” ends of the resulting megaprimer were identical to the iNOS sequences “outside” the insert, whereas the interior of the megaprimer was identical to the eNOS insert (Fig. 1). Amplification of template pCWori//E/I using megaprimer(Einsert) and primers 11 and 12 (CCAGACCCCT GGAAAACTAG TGCGACCAAG GGCGC) produced fragment G, while megaprimer and primers 10 and 13 (CCCATGTTGC ATTGGAAGTG AAG) produced fragment H. Overlap extension gave product GH, which was subcloned into pCWori//E/I via the NheI and BsrGI unique sites. Replacement of theNdeI/NheI eNOS heme domain gene fragment with that of iNOS resulted in pCWori//I/I(Einsert), hereafter referred to as “iNOS(Einsert),” which has a conservative T539S mutation due to the NheI splice site. RRKRK located in the bovine eNOS insert was mutated to five consecutive alanine residues. Mutagenesis was accomplished by standard overlap extension PCR mutagenesis using mutagenesis primers 13 (GGGCCGCAGC GGCCGCAGAG TCCAGCAACA CAGACAGC, forward) and 14 (CTGCGGCCGC TGCGGCCCAG GAGGACACCA GCGG, reverse), end primers 12 and 9, and template pHis//E/E. Conditions were as reported previously (19Hühmer A.F. Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Schoneich C. Chem. Res.

Proteins were purified to >95% purity (as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) via affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose and 2′,5′-ADP agarose. To address the goals of this study, we constructed a series of mutant proteins by deleting or swapping the insert in the wild-type NOS isoforms as well as in chimeras derived from them. The constructs are shown schematically in Fig. 2. All the expressed and purified proteins exhibited similar stabilities and yields (∼2–4 mg/liter). I/N, like native iNOS, required coexpression with CaM to prevent significant proteolysis (19Hühmer A.F. Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Schoneich C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 618-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21Fossetta J.D. Niu X.D. Lunn C.A. Zavodny P.J. Narula S.K. Lundell D.

Commun. 1996; 222: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), presumably due to a folding or protection requirement for CaM. Therefore, I/NΔ and iNOS(Einsert) also were expressed in the presence of CaM. None of the other proteins required CaM for expression and purification. Deletion of the eNOS autoinhibitory sequence was shown to affect the Ca2+ dependence of eNOS, decreasing the free Ca2+ concentration required for the expression of NOS activity in the presence of CaM (15Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14692-14698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 23Chen P.F. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13155-13163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The same eNOS deletion also resulted in enhanced NO production as well as enhanced electron transfer from both CaM-free and CaM-bound eNOS to external oxidants such as ferric cytochrome c and ferricyanide (15Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14692-14698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The rate enhancements were seen not only upon deletion of the insert from wild-type eNOS, but also upon its deletion from the chimeric NOS proteins N/E and I/E, which were constructed by replacing the reductase domains of nNOS and iNOS, respectively, with that of eNOS. We likewise examined the effect of nNOS deletions on the Ca2+ requirement for NOS activity. In the presence of a 4-fold excess of CaM, the nNOS mutant lacking the insert, nNOSΔ, exhibited a lower Ca2+requirement compared with parent nNOS (Fig.3 A, compare ○ to ●), as was seen for the eNOSΔ analog (Fig. 3 A, compare ■ to ▪), and an approximate 15-fold lowering of the apparent EC50 for Ca2+ from 300 to 20 nm. Unexpectedly, E/N, a chimeric protein with eNOS oxygenase and CaM-binding domains but an nNOS reductase domain, similarly required less Ca2+ for NOS activity (EC50 ∼70 nm) despite the fact that it possesses the autoinhibitory insert. The corresponding deletion E/NΔ did not exhibit a lower EC50 for Ca2+ (Fig. 3 B, compare ▵ to ▴). The alternative approach is to prepare the I/N chimeras in which the insertless iNOS reductase is replaced by the insert-bearing nNOS reductase domain. We reported previously (18Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5566-5571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) that this replacement led to an altered Ca2+ dependence that was intermediate between that of the wild-type constitutive isoforms and iNOS, for which coexpression with CaM was required to obtain full-length, active protein. Approximately 50% activity was retained in 2.5 mmEGTA, compared with full activity for iNOS (Fig. 3 B, compare ♦ to ×). We were interested in whether this disruption in the Ca2+ independence of iNOS could be explained by the introduction of the eNOS or nNOS insert which accompanied swapping of the reductase domains. Deletion of this insert produced I/NΔ whose Ca2+ dependence was nearly identical to that of I/N (Fig.3 B). Thus, the deletion did not produce the defining iNOS property of retaining NOS activity even at very low (<0.1 nm) free Ca2+ concentrations. Deletion of the eNOS insert yielded an enzyme with enhanced NOS and reductase activities (15Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14692-14698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, the insert appears to be at least partially responsible for attenuating the reductase, and hence overall, activity of eNOS, both of which are intrinsically lower than those of nNOS and iNOS.

To confirm this, we compared the activities of proteins bearing the insert-deleted nNOS reductase, i.e. we compared the nNOSΔ, E/NΔ, and I/NΔ deletion mutants with wild-type nNOS and the E/N and I/N chimeras. As reported by us and by others (15Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14692-14698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 43Schrammel A.

Masters B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5399-5406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the activity of both NOS and NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase is significantly influenced by the ionic strength of the assay solution. For an increase in ionic strength from 25 to 125 mm, nNOS and eNOS show increases in overall activity of 10 and 30%, respectively, whereas iNOS shows a decrease of 20% (see Fig. 4). Because activities vary with the NOS isoform, and for other reasons soon to become apparent, assays were done both as typically reported in the literature but also in the presence of 100 mm KCl. The salt enhancement is nearly maximal with this KCl content (43Schrammel A. Gorren A.C.F. Stuehr D.J. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1387: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Removing the insert from eNOS resulted in eNOSΔ, an enzyme that exhibited a roughly 2-fold increase in overall NO synthesis (15Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14692-14698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The N/E and I/E chimeras also exhibited higher activities upon deletion of the insert to give the N/EΔ and I/EΔ insert-deleted chimeras. Similar removal of the insert from nNOS gave nNOSΔ, which in the KCl-free assay had an activity approximately half that of wild-type nNOS (Fig. 4, 36 ± 2 versus 75 ± 2 min−1), a decrease not unlike that reported by Shimizu and co-workers (17Daff S. Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30589-30595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) (30%) and Guillemette and co-workers (16Montgomery H.J. Romanov V. Guillemette J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5052-5058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) (20%)). However, we found virtually no difference in nNOS and nNOSΔ activities in the presence of 100 mm KCl. In fact, if anything, nNOSΔ exhibited a slightly higher activity (94 ± 2versus 85 ± 5 min−1). The same behavior was seen when the E/N and I/N chimeras bearing the nNOS reductase were compared with the corresponding insert-deleted proteins, although the “rescue” by KCl was incomplete in these cases. Nevertheless, 81 and 85% of the activity was retained with the E/NΔ and I/NΔ chimeras, respectively, in KCl. For the previously constructed NOS chimeras, the overall activity reflected the activity of the reductase (18Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5566-5571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the reductase activity to see if this characteristic was preserved in the deletion mutants of proteins with an nNOS reductase domain. Whereas deletion of the insert did not significantly affect overall NOS activity in any of the three proteins with an nNOS reductase domain (Fig. 4), the CaM-bound cytochrome c reductase activity (Fig. 5) gave varied results. In the absence of KCl (Fig. 5 A), nNOSΔ (72%) and E/NΔ (76%) were slightly lower than the corresponding nNOS and E/N parent proteins, whereas I/NΔ (139%) was slightly higher than I/N. When the assays were performed in the presence of KCl (Fig. 5 B), the effect of insert deletion was abolished for nNOSΔ (91%) but was slightly enhanced for E/NΔ (54%) and I/NΔ (162%). The cytochrome c reduction activity of CaM-free nNOSΔ was 4-fold greater than that of CaM-free nNOS (2300 ± 200versus 590 ± 20 min−1) in the absence of salt but was only 2.5-fold greater in 100 mm KCl (4400 ± 1600 versus 1620 ± 40 min−1). When CaM was added to the assay, nNOSΔ and nNOS had similar activities, both of which were higher at higher ionic strength (Fig. 5; nNOS, 9800 ± 500 and 13,000 ± 360 min−1 versus nNOSΔ, 7100 ± 1100 and 11,800 ± 600 min−1). E/N and E/NΔ showed a similar trend in the CaM-free state; the deletion increased reductase activity relative to the parent (1030 ± 80 versus 360 ± 11 min−1), and this difference was magnified in the presence of KCl (1800 ± 100 versus 500 ± 20 min−1) due to a greater increase in the CaM-free rate observed with the deletion mutant at higher ionic strength. True CaM-free rates (exogenous CaM-free assay results are shown in Fig.5) for I/N and I/NΔ could not be measured because CaM coexpression is required to express active I/N and I/NΔ. Nevertheless, whereas removal of the insert from nNOS and the E/N chimera produced deletion mutants with lower activity than the parents proteins,"

However, nucleotide exchange in a G protein constituting αoβ4γ2 was stimulated significantly more by the M2 muscarinic receptor compared with αoβ1γ2.

Downes G.B. Yan K. Kisselev O. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The divergence between β5 and the other β subunits is consistent with the functional differences between β5 and β1observed in effector regulation in a variety of systems (4Zhang S. Coso O.A. Lee C.

Although some experiments indicated little difference in effector modulating capability among these β subunit types, other experiments suggest otherwise. The G protein-coupled receptor kinase GRK3 binds βγ complexes consisting of β1, β2, and β3, but only β1 and β2 bind to the related kinase GRK2 (15Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Richardson M. Stoffel R.H. Robishaw J.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2180-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Other results indicate the selective mediation of cross-talk between G proteins and protein kinase C modulation of N-type channels by the β1 subunit type (16Cooper C.B. Arnot M.I. Feng Z.P.

Schoneberg T. Schultz G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 399-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Evidence for similar selectivity of interaction between γ subunit types and receptors also exists (18Kisselev O. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24519-24522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Figler R.A. Lindorfer M.A. Graber S.G. Garrison J.C. Linden J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 35305-35308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast there is limited evidence for β subunit type selectivity in receptor interaction. Whole-cell experiments using antisense oligonucleotides directed against specific β subunit cDNAs selectively disrupted signaling from particular receptors (21Kleuss C. Scherubl H. Hescheler J. Schultz G. Wittig B. Nature. 1992; 358: 424-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Although the selective interaction of β subunit types with receptors could give rise to this result, such selectivity has not been shown so far.Among the five β subunits, β4 is the least studied. Its role in effector regulation and receptor interaction remains unclear. To examine its effect on the βγ regulation of effectors and G protein interaction with a receptor, we expressed purified recombinant β4γ2 and β1γ2 complexes and compared their abilities to regulate the activity of three different G protein effectors: PLC-β2,1 PLC-β3, and adenylyl cyclase type II (AC-II). Next, we examined the abilities of heterotrimers made up of αoβ1γ2 and αoβ4γ2 to couple to the M2 muscarinic receptor in a reconstituted system containing purified M2 and G protein subunits. The results indicate that in comparison to β1, the β4 subunit does not differentially modulate effector function but does differentially affect the receptor activation of a G protein. These results indicate that the particular β subunit type present in a heterotrimer influences the effectiveness of the receptor activation of that G protein. Because these experiments were performed with purified receptor and G protein subunits, these results also indicate that the β subunit plays a direct role in the receptor activation of a G protein.DISCUSSIONBecause the G protein βγ complex is known to interact directly with and modulate various effectors and the β subunit is known to contact effectors, we first compared the relative abilities of the β4γ2 and β1γ2complexes to stimulate three common effectors regulated by the βγ complex: PLC-β2, PLC-β3, and AC-II. Both βγ complexes activated each of the effectors with similar potency. This observation is consistent with the conservation between β1 and β4 of 93% of similar amino acids (Fig.6 A). It is unclear whether this result indicates that residues not conserved between β1 and β4 play no significant role in the regulation of effectors examined here. Comparing these results with previous mutational studies of β1, which implicate particular residues in PLC-β regulation, does not resolve this question. β subunit mutants analyzed in three different studies (40Ford C.E.

Chem. 1998; 273: 28298-28304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), several residues were mutated simultaneously. It is therefore difficult to interpret these results in terms of the divergence in the β1/β4 primary structures. Among the few single residues that were mutated in this study, Asp-303 is the only one that is not conserved between β1 and β4(Fig. 6 A). This mutant β1γ complex stimulated PLC-β2 normally. Although very limited, this result is consistent with results presented here.It has been known for many years that the βγ complex is essential for heterotrimeric G protein interaction with a receptor (44Fung B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10495-10502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reasons for this requirement have been less clear. There is increasing evidence to support the interaction of the C-terminal domain of the γ subunit with a receptor. This evidence comes from studies of rhodopsin-Gt coupling using peptides and mutant γ1 subunits (45Kisselev O.G. Ermolaeva M.V. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21399-21402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Kisselev O. Pronin A. Ermolaeva M. Gautam N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9102-9106Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It is also supported by the ability of a peptide specific to the γ5 subunit type but not the γ7 or γ12 subunit type to inhibit muscarinic receptor-mediated signaling in superior cervical ganglion neurons (20Azpiazu I. Cruzblanca H. Li P. Linder M. Zhuo M. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35305-35308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). More recently, the γ subunit type in a heterotrimer has been shown to influence the M2 receptor-stimulated nucleotide exchange (34Hou Y. Azpiazu I. Smrcka A. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38961-38964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Here we used the same assay to detect a consistent 2–3-fold difference in M2-stimulated GTP hydrolysis between αoβ4γ2 and αoβ1γ2. Because these experiments were performed in the presence of an RGS protein, the difference in activity reflects a difference in receptor-stimulated nucleotide exchange. The measurement of heterotrimer formation between αo and β1γ2 or β4γ2 showed that both heterotrimers form with equal effectiveness and ruled out the possibility that the difference in receptor-stimulated nucleotide exchange arose from differences in heterotrimer formation. Receptor-stimulated GTPase assays performed in the absence of the RGS protein showed that the differences arose at the site of receptor interaction and not from differential interaction with the RGS protein.The differences in receptor-stimulated activity between αoβ4γ2 and αoβ1γ2 therefore indicate that the distinct primary structures of β1 and β4 influence the interaction of the heterotrimer with the receptor. Evidence that the γ subunit interacts with receptors and previous evidence that the α subunit C and N termini interact with receptors (47Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar) help identify the surface of the G protein that contacts the receptor (Fig. 6 B). Inspection of the amino acid sequences of the β1 and β4 subunits indicates differences that are distributed over the sequence (Fig.6 A). For these differences to play a role in receptor interaction, they most likely need to be accessible to the receptor and therefore located on the outer surface of the molecule. The location of the different amino acids between the β1 and β4 subunits on the three-dimensional structure of the β subunit indicates that two clusters of residues (31–39 and 302–305) are located on parallel strands of the β subunit, as shown in Fig.6 B, although the two clusters are far apart in the primary structure, located toward the N and C termini of the β subunit (Fig.6 A). These residues are on the outer surface of the molecule. Most strikingly, these residues are on the surface that has been inferred to contact the receptor; note the location of the C termini of the α subunit and the γ subunit (Fig. 6 B). Finally, several of these residues show divergence between the various β subunit types (Fig. 6 A).Antisense oligonucleotides specific to β1 and β3 have previously been shown to selectively inhibit somatostatin and muscarinic M4 receptor-mediated Ca2+channel activity (21Kleuss C. Scherubl H. Hescheler J. Schultz G. Wittig B. Nature. 1992; 358: 424-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The precise point in the signaling pathway that was perturbed by the introduction of the oligonucleotides has not been elucidated so far. Inferences about the relationship between those results and the differential stimulation of αo in the presence of β1/β4 cannot be drawn both for this reason and because the physiological effect of the differential M2 stimulation of αoβ4γ2 versus αoβ1γ2 is not known.The recent crystal structure determination of the inactive form of rhodopsin indicates that the intracellular portion of the receptor spans a little over 40 Å. It is unclear whether the activated forms of other receptors will expose intracellular surfaces that are considerably larger in surface area than 40 Å in surface area. The distances between the C terminus of the γ subunit and several of the residues in the β subunit clusters are much less than 40 Å, so the β subunit domains and the C terminus of the γ subunit can interact with a receptor simultaneously. In contrast, the distances between these domains in the β subunit and the C terminus of the α subunit are over 50 Å, and it seems less likely that these regions can interact with a receptor at the same time. However, even domains that are far apart in the G protein can interact with the receptor in a temporally sequential fashion. Direct contact between the β subunit region containing residues 302–305 and the receptor is consistent with a previous study that showed the cross-linking of a β subunit peptide covering residues 281–340 with an α2-adrenergic receptor-derived peptide (48Taylor J.M. Jacob-Mosier G.G. Lawton R.G. VanDort M. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3336-3339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Divergences in the amino acid sequence between β1 and β4 may thus contribute directly to differences in interaction through differential contact with corresponding residues in the receptor. This would result in the G proteins containing these subunit types being activated selectively, as seen here. Alternatively, the residues in the two clusters, 31–39 and 302–305, may influence the three-dimensional structure of the receptor-interacting surface without contacting the receptor directly. The elucidation of the crystal structure of a βγ complex that retains the prenyl modification bound to phosducin indicates that this is a possibility. It has been inferred from the elucidation of this structure that the prenyl moiety is buried in a cavity between β sheets 6 and 7 of the folded β subunit structure (49Loew A. Ho Y.K. Blundell T. Bax B. Structure. 1998; 6: 1007-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6 B). This region of the β subunit is susceptible to conformational changes; the conformation of this region has been inferred to be different in the free βγ complex compared with βγ bound to phosducin (49Loew A. Ho Y.K. Blundell T. Bax B. Structure. 1998; 6: 1007-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It is thus possible that the differences between β1 and β4 in the two clusters of residues highlightedin Fig. 6 B can have an effect on the conformational state of this prenyl binding cavity between β sheets 6 and 7. Because there is evidence that the prenyl moiety and the last several C-terminal residues of the γ subunit contact the receptors, such a rearrangement would indirectly affect the receptor interaction of the heterotrimer by altering the accessibility of the γ subunit tail. Recent results seem to indicate that this is the less likely mechanism. In a study by Myung and Garrison (42Myung C.S. Garrison J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9311-9316Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), mutations were introduced in the prenyl binding cavity and in the region of the β subunit that undergoes conformational changes on binding to phosducin. These mutant forms of the β subunit did not affect the G protein interaction with the A1 adenosine receptor as measured by the ability of the G proteins to stabilize the high affinity binding state of A1 receptors. It is unclear whether the GTPase assays used here will detect differences between the β subunit mutants and wild type used in that study.Overall, the importance of these results is that the differential receptor interaction of β subunit types indicates a direct role for the β subunit in receptor activation of a G protein. The G protein βγ complex regulates the activity of a diverse set of effectors, including phospholipases, adenylyl cyclases, and ion channels (1Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). There is evidence that the β subunit in the complex interacts directly with effectors (2Yan K. Gautam N. J. Biol.

There are five β subtypes (β1–β5) as well as an alternatively spliced version of β5 (known as β5-long) (6Fong H.K. Hurley J.B. Hopkins R.S. Miake-Lye R. Johnson M.S. Doolittle R.F. Simon M.I. Proc.

Downes G.B. Yan K. Kisselev O. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The divergence between β5 and the other β subunits is consistent with the functional differences between β5 and β1observed in effector regulation in a variety of systems (4Zhang S. Coso O.A. Lee C.

J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24872-24880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The high sequence similarity of β1–β4suggests that their functions are conserved. Although some experiments indicated little difference in effector modulating capability among these β subunit types, other experiments suggest otherwise. The G protein-coupled receptor kinase GRK3 binds βγ complexes consisting of β1, β2, and β3, but only β1 and β2 bind to the related kinase GRK2 (15Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Richardson M. Stoffel R.H. Robishaw J.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2180-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Other results indicate the selective mediation of cross-talk between G proteins and protein kinase C modulation of N-type channels by the β1 subunit type (16Cooper C.B. Arnot M.I. Feng Z.P. Jarvis S.E. Hamid J. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40777-40781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Experiments focusing on the specific role of individual G protein subunit types have provided evidence for a certain level of selectivity in the interaction of α subunit types with receptors (17Gudermann T. Schoneberg T. Schultz G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 399-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Evidence for similar selectivity of interaction between γ subunit types and receptors also exists (18Kisselev O. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24519-24522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Figler R.A. Lindorfer M.A. Graber S.G. Garrison J.C. Linden J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 35305-35308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast there is limited evidence for β subunit type selectivity in receptor interaction. Whole-cell experiments using antisense oligonucleotides directed against specific β subunit cDNAs selectively disrupted signaling from particular receptors (21Kleuss C. Scherubl H. Hescheler J. Schultz G. Wittig B. Nature. 1992; 358: 424-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Although the selective interaction of β subunit types with receptors could give rise to this result, such selectivity has not been shown so far. Among the five β subunits, β4 is the least studied. Its role in effector regulation and receptor interaction remains unclear. To examine its effect on the βγ regulation of effectors and G protein interaction with a receptor, we expressed purified recombinant β4γ2 and β1γ2 complexes and compared their abilities to regulate the activity of three different G protein effectors: PLC-β2,1 PLC-β3, and adenylyl cyclase type II (AC-II). Next, we examined the abilities of heterotrimers made up of αoβ1γ2 and αoβ4γ2 to couple to the M2 muscarinic receptor in a reconstituted system containing purified M2 and G protein subunits. The results indicate that in comparison to β1, the β4 subunit does not differentially modulate effector function but does differentially affect the receptor activation of a G protein. These results indicate that the particular β subunit type present in a heterotrimer influences the effectiveness of the receptor activation of that G protein. Because these experiments were performed with purified receptor and G protein subunits, these results also indicate that the β subunit plays a direct role in the receptor activation of a G protein. DISCUSSIONBecause the G protein βγ complex is known to interact directly with and modulate various effectors and the β subunit is known to contact effectors, we first compared the relative abilities of the β4γ2 and β1γ2complexes to stimulate three common effectors regulated by the βγ complex: PLC-β2, PLC-β3, and AC-II. Both βγ complexes activated each of the effectors with similar potency. This observation is consistent with the conservation between β1 and β4 of 93% of similar amino acids (Fig.6 A). It is unclear whether this result indicates that residues not conserved between β1 and β4 play no significant role in the regulation of effectors examined here. Comparing these results with previous mutational studies of β1, which implicate particular residues in PLC-β regulation, does not resolve this question. β subunit mutants analyzed in three different studies (40Ford C.E.

Chem. 1998; 273: 28298-28304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), several residues were mutated simultaneously. It is therefore difficult to interpret these results in terms of the divergence in the β1/β4 primary structures. Among the few single residues that were mutated in this study, Asp-303 is the only one that is not conserved between β1 and β4(Fig. 6 A). This mutant β1γ complex stimulated PLC-β2 normally. Although very limited, this result is consistent with results presented here.It has been known for many years that the βγ complex is essential for heterotrimeric G protein interaction with a receptor (44Fung B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10495-10502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reasons for this requirement have been less clear. There is increasing evidence to support the interaction of the C-terminal domain of the γ subunit with a receptor. This evidence comes from studies of rhodopsin-Gt coupling using peptides and mutant γ1 subunits (45Kisselev O.G. Ermolaeva M.V. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21399-21402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Kisselev O. Pronin A. Ermolaeva M. Gautam N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9102-9106Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It is also supported by the ability of a peptide specific to the γ5 subunit type but not the γ7 or γ12 subunit type to inhibit muscarinic receptor-mediated signaling in superior cervical ganglion neurons (20Azpiazu I. Cruzblanca H. Li P. Linder M. Zhuo M. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35305-35308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). More recently, the γ subunit type in a heterotrimer has been shown to influence the M2 receptor-stimulated nucleotide exchange (34Hou Y. Azpiazu I. Smrcka A. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38961-38964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Here we used the same assay to detect a consistent 2–3-fold difference in M2-stimulated GTP hydrolysis between αoβ4γ2 and αoβ1γ2. Because these experiments were performed in the presence of an RGS protein, the difference in activity reflects a difference in receptor-stimulated nucleotide exchange. The measurement of heterotrimer formation between αo and β1γ2 or β4γ2 showed that both heterotrimers form with equal effectiveness and ruled out the possibility that the difference in receptor-stimulated nucleotide exchange arose from differences in heterotrimer formation. Receptor-stimulated GTPase assays performed in the absence of the RGS protein showed that the differences arose at the site of receptor interaction and not from differential interaction with the RGS protein.The differences in receptor-stimulated activity between αoβ4γ2 and αoβ1γ2 therefore indicate that the distinct primary structures of β1 and β4 influence the interaction of the heterotrimer with the receptor. Evidence that the γ subunit interacts with receptors and previous evidence that the α subunit C and N termini interact with receptors (47Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar) help identify the surface of the G protein that contacts the receptor (Fig. 6 B). Inspection of the amino acid sequences of the β1 and β4 subunits indicates differences that are distributed over the sequence (Fig.6 A). For these differences to play a role in receptor interaction, they most likely need to be accessible to the receptor and therefore located on the outer surface of the molecule. The location of the different amino acids between the β1 and β4 subunits on the three-dimensional structure of the β subunit indicates that two clusters of residues (31–39 and 302–305) are located on parallel strands of the β subunit, as shown in Fig.6 B, although the two clusters are far apart in the primary structure, located toward the N and C termini of the β subunit (Fig.6 A). These residues are on the outer surface of the molecule. Most strikingly, these residues are on the surface that has been inferred to contact the receptor; note the location of the C termini of the α subunit and the γ subunit (Fig. 6 B). Finally, several of these residues show divergence between the various β subunit types (Fig. 6 A).Antisense oligonucleotides specific to β1 and β3 have previously been shown to selectively inhibit somatostatin and muscarinic M4 receptor-mediated Ca2+channel activity (21Kleuss C. Scherubl H. Hescheler J. Schultz G. Wittig B. Nature. 1992; 358: 424-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The precise point in the signaling pathway that was perturbed by the introduction of the oligonucleotides has not been elucidated so far. Inferences about the relationship between those results and the differential stimulation of αo in the presence of β1/β4 cannot be drawn both for this reason and because the physiological effect of the differential M2 stimulation of αoβ4γ2 versus αoβ1γ2 is not known.The recent crystal structure determination of the inactive form of rhodopsin indicates that the intracellular portion of the receptor spans a little over 40 Å. It is unclear whether the activated forms of other receptors will expose intracellular surfaces that are considerably larger in surface area than 40 Å in surface area. The distances between the C terminus of the γ subunit and several of the residues in the β subunit clusters are much less than 40 Å, so the β subunit domains and the C terminus of the γ subunit can interact with a receptor simultaneously. In contrast, the distances between these domains in the β subunit and the C terminus of the α subunit are over 50 Å, and it seems less likely that these regions can interact with a receptor at the same time. However, even domains that are far apart in the G protein can interact with the receptor in a temporally sequential fashion. Direct contact between the β subunit region containing residues 302–305 and the receptor is consistent with a previous study that showed the cross-linking of a β subunit peptide covering residues 281–340 with an α2-adrenergic receptor-derived peptide (48Taylor J.M. Jacob-Mosier G.G. Lawton R.G. VanDort M. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3336-3339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Divergences in the amino acid sequence between β1 and β4 may thus contribute directly to differences in interaction through differential contact with corresponding residues in the receptor. This would result in the G proteins containing these subunit types being activated selectively, as seen here. Alternatively, the residues in the two clusters, 31–39 and 302–305, may influence the three-dimensional structure of the receptor-interacting surface without contacting the receptor directly. The elucidation of the crystal structure of a βγ complex that retains the prenyl modification bound to phosducin indicates that this is a possibility. It has been inferred from the elucidation of this structure that the prenyl moiety is buried in a cavity between β sheets 6 and 7 of the folded β subunit structure (49Loew A. Ho Y.K. Blundell T. Bax B. Structure. 1998; 6: 1007-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6 B). This region of the β subunit is susceptible to conformational changes; the conformation of this region has been inferred to be different in the free βγ complex compared with βγ bound to phosducin (49Loew A. Ho Y.K. Blundell T. Bax B. Structure. 1998; 6: 1007-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It is thus possible that the differences between β1 and β4 in the two clusters of residues highlightedin Fig. 6 B can have an effect on the conformational state of this prenyl binding cavity between β sheets 6 and 7. Because there is evidence that the prenyl moiety and the last several C-terminal residues of the γ subunit contact the receptors, such a rearrangement would indirectly affect the receptor interaction of the heterotrimer by altering the accessibility of the γ subunit tail. Recent results seem to indicate that this is the less likely mechanism. In a study by Myung and Garrison (42Myung C.S. Garrison J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9311-9316Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), mutations were introduced in the prenyl binding cavity and in the region of the β subunit that undergoes conformational changes on binding to phosducin. These mutant forms of the β subunit did not affect the G protein interaction with the A1 adenosine receptor as measured by the ability of the G proteins to stabilize the high affinity binding state of A1 receptors. It is unclear whether the GTPase assays used here will detect differences between the β subunit mutants and wild type used in that study.Overall, the importance of these results is that the differential receptor interaction of β subunit types indicates a direct role for the β subunit in receptor activation of a G protein. Because the G protein βγ complex is known to interact directly with and modulate various effectors and the β subunit is known to contact effectors, we first compared the relative abilities of the β4γ2 and β1γ2complexes to stimulate three common effectors regulated by the βγ complex: PLC-β2, PLC-β3, and AC-II.

This evidence comes from studies of rhodopsin-Gt coupling using peptides and mutant γ1 subunits (45Kisselev O.G. Ermolaeva M.V. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21399-21402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Kisselev O. Pronin A. Ermolaeva M. Gautam N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9102-9106Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It is also supported by the ability of a peptide specific to the γ5 subunit type but not the γ7 or γ12 subunit type to inhibit muscarinic receptor-mediated signaling in superior cervical ganglion neurons (20Azpiazu I. Cruzblanca H. Li P. Linder M. Zhuo M. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35305-35308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). More recently, the γ subunit type in a heterotrimer has been shown to influence the M2 receptor-stimulated nucleotide exchange (34Hou Y. Azpiazu I. Smrcka A. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38961-38964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Here we used the same assay to detect a consistent 2–3-fold difference in M2-stimulated GTP hydrolysis between αoβ4γ2 and αoβ1γ2. Because these experiments were performed in the presence of an RGS protein, the difference in activity reflects a difference in receptor-stimulated nucleotide exchange. The measurement of heterotrimer formation between αo and β1γ2 or β4γ2 showed that both heterotrimers form with equal effectiveness and ruled out the possibility that the difference in receptor-stimulated nucleotide exchange arose from differences in heterotrimer formation. Receptor-stimulated GTPase assays performed in the absence of the RGS protein showed that the differences arose at the site of receptor interaction and not from differential interaction with the RGS protein. The differences in receptor-stimulated activity between αoβ4γ2 and αoβ1γ2 therefore indicate that the distinct primary structures of β1 and β4 influence the interaction of the heterotrimer with the receptor. Evidence that the γ subunit interacts with receptors and previous evidence that the α subunit C and N termini interact with receptors (47Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar) help identify the surface of the G protein that contacts the receptor (Fig. 6 B). Inspection of the amino acid sequences of the β1 and β4 subunits indicates differences that are distributed over the sequence (Fig.6 A). For these differences to play a role in receptor interaction, they most likely need to be accessible to the receptor and therefore located on the outer surface of the molecule. The location of the different amino acids between the β1 and β4 subunits on the three-dimensional structure of the β subunit indicates that two clusters of residues (31–39 and 302–305) are located on parallel strands of the β subunit, as shown in Fig.6 B, although the two clusters are far apart in the primary structure, located toward the N and C termini of the β subunit (Fig.6 A). These residues are on the outer surface of the molecule. Most strikingly, these residues are on the surface that has been inferred to contact the receptor; note the location of the C termini of the α subunit and the γ subunit (Fig. 6 B). Finally, several of these residues show divergence between the various β subunit types (Fig. 6 A). Antisense oligonucleotides specific to β1 and β3 have previously been shown to selectively inhibit somatostatin and muscarinic M4 receptor-mediated Ca2+channel activity (21Kleuss C. Scherubl H. Hescheler J. Schultz G. Wittig B. Nature. 1992; 358: 424-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The precise point in the signaling pathway that was perturbed by the introduction of the oligonucleotides has not been elucidated so far. Inferences about the relationship between those results and the differential stimulation of αo in the presence of β1/β4 cannot be drawn both for this reason and because the physiological effect of the differential M2 stimulation of αoβ4γ2 versus αoβ1γ2 is not known. The recent crystal structure determination of the inactive form of rhodopsin indicates that the intracellular portion of the receptor spans a little over 40 Å. It is unclear whether the activated forms of other receptors will expose intracellular surfaces that are considerably larger in surface area than 40 Å in surface area. The distances between the C terminus of the γ subunit and several of the residues in the β subunit clusters are much less than 40 Å, so the β subunit domains and the C terminus of the γ subunit can interact with a receptor simultaneously. In contrast, the distances between these domains in the β subunit and the C terminus of the α subunit are over 50 Å, and it seems less likely that these regions can interact with a receptor at the same time. However, even domains that are far apart in the G protein can interact with the receptor in a temporally sequential fashion. Direct contact between the β subunit region containing residues 302–305 and the receptor is consistent with a previous study that showed the cross-linking of a β subunit peptide covering residues 281–340 with an α2-adrenergic receptor-derived peptide (48Taylor J.M. Jacob-Mosier G.G. Lawton R.G. VanDort M. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3336-3339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Divergences in the amino acid sequence between β1 and β4 may thus contribute directly to differences in interaction through differential contact with corresponding residues in the receptor. This would result in the G proteins containing these subunit types being activated selectively, as seen here. Alternatively, the residues in the two clusters, 31–39 and 302–305, may influence the three-dimensional structure of the receptor-interacting surface without contacting the receptor directly. The elucidation of the crystal structure of a βγ complex that retains the prenyl modification bound to phosducin indicates that this is a possibility. It has been inferred from the elucidation of this structure that the prenyl moiety is buried in a cavity between β sheets 6 and 7 of the folded β subunit structure (49Loew A. Ho Y.K. Blundell T. Bax B. Structure. 1998; 6: 1007-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6 B). This region of the β subunit is susceptible to conformational changes; the conformation of this region has been inferred to be different in the free βγ complex compared with βγ bound to phosducin (49Loew A. Ho Y.K. Blundell T. Bax B. Structure. 1998; 6: 1007-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It is thus possible that the differences between β1 and β4 in the two clusters of residues highlightedin Fig. 6 B can have an effect on the conformational state of this prenyl binding cavity between β sheets 6 and 7. Because there is evidence that the prenyl moiety and the last several C-terminal residues of the γ subunit contact the receptors, such a rearrangement would indirectly affect the receptor interaction of the heterotrimer by altering the accessibility of the γ subunit tail. Recent results seem to indicate that this is the less likely mechanism. In a study by Myung and Garrison (42Myung C.S. Garrison J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9311-9316Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), mutations were introduced in the prenyl binding cavity and in the region of the β subunit that undergoes conformational changes on binding to phosducin. These mutant forms of the β subunit did not affect the G protein interaction with the A1 adenosine receptor as measured by the ability of the G proteins to stabilize the high affinity binding state of A1 receptors. It is unclear whether the GTPase assays used here will detect differences between the β subunit mutants and wild type used in that study. Overall, the importance of these results is that the differential receptor interaction of β subunit types indicates a direct role for the β subunit in receptor activation of a G protein.

Angiotensin II (Ang II) elicits a hypertrophic growth response characterized by an increase in protein synthesis in the absence of DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. Intracellular signaling mechanisms linking angiotensin type I receptor activation to protein synthesis in VSMC have not been fully characterized. The present study investigates the role of the nonreceptor proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2) in Ang II-induced VSMC protein synthesis and in the regulation of two signaling pathways that have been implicated in the control of protein synthesis, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathways. PYK2 antisense oligonucleotides were used to down-regulate PYK2 expression in cultured VSMC.

The mechanisms by which ERK1/2 mediate Ang II-induced protein synthesis have not been fully identified but are thought to occur at the level of gene expression and the initiation of protein translation. The activation of PI3-kinase and its downstream targets, Akt and the ribosomal p70S6 kinase, is critical for protein synthesis in many cell types, including VSMC (11Saward L. Zahradka P. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 249-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, p70S6 kinase is thought to be the major in vivo mediator of ribosomal S6 protein phosphorylation, a necessary step in Ang II-mediated protein synthesis in VSMC (13Giasson E. Meloche S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5225-5231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In other cell types, both ERK1/2 and PI3-kinase have been shown to regulate the association of phosphorylated heat and acid-stable protein 1 (PHAS-1) with the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), a key regulator of translation initiation (14Lawrence J.C.J. Abraham R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 345-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that pharmacological inhibition of ERK1/2 and PI3-kinase reduce Ang II-induced protein synthesis (7Govindarajan G. Eble D.M. Lucchesi P.A. Samarel A.M. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 710-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The precise molecular mechanisms that couple AT1 receptor activation to these distinct signaling pathways have not been fully established. We and others have shown that both PYK2 and the closely related FAK can form signaling complexes with the upstream regulators of the ERK1/2 pathway, Src, Shc, and Grb2, and with p130Cas, an adapter protein implicated in PI3-kinase activation (6Sabri A.

Little is known about the interrelationship between PYK2 and FAK signaling in response to Ang II in VSMC. In the present study, we examined the role of PYK2 in Ang II-induced VSMC protein synthesis. We show that down-regulation of PYK2 expression by antisense oligonucleotides resulted in a significant inhibition of Ang II-induced protein synthesis that was correlated with inhibition of ERK1/2, Akt, and p70S6 kinase activation. Moreover, PYK2 antisense treatment caused a remarkable reduction in Ang II-induced FAK phosphorylation without any effect on FAK expression. A preliminary report has appeared (16Rocic P. Lucchesi P.A. FASEB J. 2001; 15 (abstr.): 488Google Scholar). PYK2 antisense oligonucleotides and scrambled control oligonucleotides were custom-made by BIOGNOSTIK (Göttingen, Germany). Anti-total PYK2 and anti-total FAK antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-total ERK1/2 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-phospho ERK1/2 antibodies were from Promega. Anti-phospho Akt (pSer-473), anti-phospho p70S6 kinase (pThr-389, pSer-424), anti-total Akt, and anti-total p70S6 kinase antibodies were from New England Biolabs. Anti-phospho FAK (pTyr-397 and pTyr-861) was from BIOSOURCE. [3H]phenylalanine was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Ang II was from Sigma. VSMC were prepared and cultured as previously described (6Sabri A. Govindarajan G. Griffin T. Byron K. Samarel A. Lucchesi P. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 841-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). VSMC were grown in 10% CS-DMEM to ∼60% confluence. Cells were washed three times in Opti-MEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) 1 h before antisense treatment. VSMC were treated with PYK2 antisense oligonucleotides (0.75 μm) for 8 h. LipofectAMINE Plus (10 μg/ml, Life Technologies, Inc.) was used as a transfection reagent. After 8 h, the medium was replaced with 0.2% CS-DMEM and left overnight. The next day, 0.2% CS-DMEM was replaced with serum free-DMEM for at least 1 h prior to treatment with Ang II. VSMC were treated with PYK2 oligonucleotides (antisense and scrambled controls) as described above. The next day, 0.2% CS-DMEM was replaced with serum free-DMEM for at least 8 h prior to stimulation with 100 nm Ang II for 24 h. During the last 6 h of Ang II incubation, 1 μCi/ml [3H]phenylalanine (30 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to each dish. Total protein measurements were assessed over the 24-h incubation period. VSMC were rinsed with 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and protein was precipitated by 10% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min on ice. The trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material was solubilized with 0.2 mm NaOH for 20 min at 60 °C. A portion of the sample was used to determine total protein using a bicinchonic acid (Pierce) protein assay, and [3H]phenylalanine was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Triplicate dishes were used for each measurement. Western blot analysis was performed as described (10Rocic P. Govindarajan G. Sabri A. Lucchesi P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C90-C99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. for at least n = 3 experiments. One-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni's test was used for comparisons among multiple groups. Differences among means were considered significant at p < 0.05. Data were analyzed using InStat statistical software (Graphpad). We first determined the effects of PYK2 antisense oligonucleotides on PYK2 expression. PYK2 antisense oligonucleotides decreased PYK2 total protein levels by 80% (0.20 ± 0.06 for antisense oligonucleotides versus control) as measured by Western blot analysis. PYK2 antisense treatment had no effect on the expression of the closely related kinase FAK (1.04 ± 0.04 for antisense oligonucleotides versus control) as measured by Western blot analysis with anti-total FAK antibodies (Fig.1). Transfection efficiency, as assessed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled antisense oligonucleotides, was >85% (data not shown). We have previously shown that PYK2 interacts with Shc and Grb2, upstream activators of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway (10Rocic P. Govindarajan G. Sabri A. Lucchesi P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C90-C99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To demonstrate that PYK2 is necessary for Ang II-induced ERK1/2 activation, we examined the effects of PYK2 antisense oligonucleotides on ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Down-regulation of PYK2 resulted in a significant 77% (3.8 ± 1.3-fold increaseversus control for antisense oligonucleotides compared with 16.6 ± 1.8-fold increase versus control for Ang II) decrease in Ang II-induced ERK1/2 activation as detected by Western blot analysis with anti-phospho ERK1/2 antibodies. PYK2 antisense oligonucleotides did not affect ERK1/2 expression as determined by anti-total ERK1/2 antibodies (Fig.2) We have previously demonstrated that PYK2 associates with the adaptor molecule p130Cas and with PI3-kinase in response to Ang II (10Rocic P. Govindarajan G. Sabri A. Lucchesi P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C90-C99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we sought to determine whether PYK2 down-regulation by PYK2 antisense oligonucleotides would prevent Ang II-induced activation of Akt and p70S6 kinase, the major downstream effectors of the PI3-kinase signaling pathway. Here we show that Akt and p70S6 kinase are activated in response to Ang II. PYK2 down-regulation resulted in an ∼80% inhibition (3.00 ± 0.82-fold increase versus control for antisense oligonucleotides compared with 16.0 ± 1.0-fold increaseversus control for Ang II) in Ang II-induced Akt and a 76% inhibition of p70S6 kinase activation (1.03 ± 0.03-fold increaseversus control for antisense oligonucleotides compared with a 3.8 ± 0.5-fold increase versus control for Ang II), as measured by Western blot analysis with anti-phospho Akt and anti-phospho p70S6 kinase antibodies, respectively. PYK2 antisense oligonucleotides did not affect Akt or p70S6 kinase expression as measured with anti-total Akt and anti-total p70S6 kinase antibodies (Figs. 3 and4).Figure 4PYK2 antisense oligonucleotides down-regulate p70S6 kinase activation by Ang II.

Protein synthesis was measured using [3H]phenylalanine incorporation during the last 6 h of a 24-h Ang II treatment. Ang II induced a significant increase in VSMC protein synthesis (2.1-fold increase versus control). Treatment with PYK2 antisense oligonucleotides resulted in a complete inhibition of Ang II-induced protein synthesis (Fig. 5). Neither LipofectAMINE alone nor scrambled oligonucleotides had any significant affect on Ang-II induced protein synthesis. Govindarajan et al. (7Govindarajan G. Eble D.M. Lucchesi P.A. Samarel A.M. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 710-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) have previously demonstrated a role for FAK in Ang II-induced protein synthesis. FAK activation results in its phosphorylation on multiple tyrosine residues including Tyr-397, the autophosphorylation site, and Tyr-861, a proposed docking site for the adapter molecules Grb2 and p130Cas. We sought to determine whether FAK phosphorylation on Tyr-397 and Tyr-861 in response to Ang II is dependent on PYK2. A decrease in PYK2 protein levels by PYK2 antisense oligonucleotide treatment resulted in a corresponding decrease in Tyr-397 and Tyr-861 phosphorylation of FAK, without any effect on FAK expression (Fig. 6). Angiotensin II is a potent mediator of VSMC hypertrophy. The intracellular signaling components that link AT1 receptors to VSMC growth involve a complex network of protein-protein interactions and kinase cascades, but little is known about the intracellular signaling intermediates that link the AT1receptor to these pathways. There is increasing evidence that non-receptor tyrosine kinases are the upstream regulators of signaling pathways important in the regulation of cellular growth. Here, using antisense oligonucleotide strategies, we established PYK2 as a proximal signaling intermediate that links the AT1 receptor activation to the activation of ERK1/2 and the activation of Akt and p70S6 kinase, downstream effectors of PI3-kinase signaling. Inhibition of these pathways by PYK2 down-regulation resulted in a complete inhibition of Ang II-induced VSMC protein synthesis. We chose an antisense strategy to down-regulate PYK2 expression rather than overexpression of a dominant negative PYK2 mutant because we were concerned that protein overexpression could alter protein-protein interactions that are largely governed by protein concentration and localization (17Koller E. Gaarde W.A. Monia B.P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 142-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Treatment with PYK2 antisense oligonucleotides, but not scrambled oligonucleotides, lead to a significant down-regulation of PYK2 in VSMC. This effect was specific, because the expression of FAK and downstream signaling molecules was unaltered. PYK2 has been shown to be an upstream regulator of a variety of cellular signaling pathways, including Src and multiple members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family (18Avraham H. Park S.Y. Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell. Signalling. 2000; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). We and others have previously shown that Ang II induced complex formation between PYK2 and the upstream regulators of the ERK1/2 pathway, Src, Shc, and Grb2, in VSMC (6Sabri A. Govindarajan G.

Physiol. 2001; 280: C90-C99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a role for PYK2 in the regulation of ERK1/2 activation in response to Ang II. Using PYK2 antisense oligonucleotides in this study, we conclusively showed that PYK2 is required for Ang II-induced ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 2). Ang II has been shown to activate PI3-kinase (11Saward L. Zahradka P. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 249-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), p70S6 kinase (19Eguchi S. Iwasaki H. Ueno H. Frank G.D. Motley E.D.

Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C90-C99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data are suggestive of PYK2-dependent activation of the PI3-kinase signaling pathway. We here demonstrated that PYK2 is required for activation of the PI3-kinase signaling pathway by Ang II, because PYK2 down-regulation significantly blocked Ang II-induced phosphorylation of both Akt and p70S6 kinase (Figs. 3 and 4). On the other hand, Eguchi et al.(19Eguchi S. Iwasaki H. Ueno H. Frank G.D. Motley E.D. Eguchi K. Marumo F. Hirata Y. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36843-36851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) reported that Ca2+-dependent transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor was involved in Ang II-induced Akt and p70S6 kinase. Therefore it is possible that the Ca2+-sensitive PYK2 may play a role in Ang II-induced epidermal growth factor receptor transactivation to mediate PI3-kinase signaling. Recent evidence suggests that ERK1/2 and PI3-kinase play a crucial role in Ang II-induced VSMC hypertrophy (7Govindarajan G. Eble D.M. Lucchesi P.A. Samarel A.M. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 710-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Giasson E. Meloche S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 16018-16022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These pathways appear to be independent in smooth muscle, because inhibitors of PI3-kinase do not block Ang II-induced ERK1/2 activation (10Rocic P. Govindarajan G. Sabri A. Lucchesi P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C90-C99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and inhibitors of ERK1/2 signaling have no effect on Ang II-induced activation of Akt (19Eguchi S. Iwasaki H. Ueno H. Frank G.D. Motley E.D. Eguchi K. Marumo F. Hirata Y. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36843-36851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Because PYK2 is necessary for the activation of these pathways, we reasoned that PYK2 down-regulation would prevent Ang II-induced protein synthesis. As shown in Fig. 5, pretreatment with PYK2 antisense oligonucleotides completely blocked protein synthesis in response to Ang II. These results suggest that PYK2 links the AT1 receptor to divergent signaling pathways that control VSMC protein synthesis. The regulation of translation initiation is the rate-limiting step for protein synthesis. Both Akt and ERK1/2 are thought to regulate this step via phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4E/PHAS-1 complex. eIF4E mediates the initiation phase of mRNA translation, the rate-limiting step for protein synthesis (23Sonenberg N. Gingras A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). The availability of eIF4E is regulated by PHAS-1; when phosphorylated, PHAS-1 disassociates from eIF4E, allowing the factor to participate in translation initiation (14Lawrence J.C.J. Abraham R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 345-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Both proteins are regulated via phosphorylation by ERK1/2 and PI3-kinase pathways (14Lawrence J.C.J. Abraham R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 345-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 23Sonenberg N. Gingras A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Thus, the ability of PYK2 antisense oligonucleotides to prevent Ang II-induced protein synthesis may be due, in part, to decreased phosphorylation of the eIF4E/PHAS-1 complex by ERK1/2 and PI3-kinase pathways. Future studies will elucidate the exact mechanisms involved in the regulation of translation initiation by PYK2. In the present study, we show that PYK2 is involved in Ang II-induced FAK activation. A recent report, using overexpression of the C-terminal domain of FAK (FRNK), demonstrated that FAK is necessary for ERK1/2 activation and the induction of protein synthesis by Ang II (7Govindarajan G. Eble D.M. Lucchesi P.A. Samarel A.M. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 710-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). FRNK, however, inhibited Ang II-induced protein synthesis only partially, which may be related to its inability to inhibit Ang II-induced activation of p70S6 kinase (7Govindarajan G. Eble D.M. Lucchesi P.A. Samarel A.M. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 710-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Graves et al. (24Graves L.M. He Y. Lambert J. Hunter D. Li X. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1920-1928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) also reported that p70S6 kinase is activated independently of FAK by an upstream, Ca2+-sensitive tyrosine kinase. To link the inhibition of ERK1/2, Akt, and p70S6 kinase phosphorylation observed in this study to specific down-regulation of PYK2, we examined the effects of PYK2 antisense oligonucleotides on FAK expression. Under conditions where PYK2 was significantly down-regulated, PYK2 antisense oligonucleotides had no effect on FAK expression (Fig. 1). We then determined whether PYK2 was involved in Ang II-induced FAK phosphorylation. Using phospho-specific antibodies, we showed that PYK2 down-regulation led to a significant decrease in Ang II-induced FAK phosphorylation at Tyr-397 and Tyr-861 (Fig. 6). Tyr-397 is an autophosphorylation site that can also be phosphorylated by Src in response to integrin engagement (25Salazar, E. P., and Rozengurt, E. (February 15, 2001)J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc.M100984200.Google Scholar, 26Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). Tyr-861 has recently been shown to be a major site that is phosphorylated by Src (27Calalb M.B. Zhang X. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 662-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). These data suggest that PYK2 may be at least one of the upstream regulators of FAK activation by Ang II. The mechanisms by which PYK2 links AT1 receptor activation to FAK phosphorylation remain to be elucidated. One possible mechanism is that the adapter protein p130Cas assembles both PYK2 and FAK in response to Ang II. The proline-rich motifs of both PYK2 and FAK are thought to bind to the SH3 domains of the large adapter protein p130Cas. We have previously shown that PYK2, p130Cas, and PI3-kinase form a signaling complex in VSMC in response to Ang II (10Rocic P. Govindarajan G. Sabri A. Lucchesi P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C90-C99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and others have shown an interaction between FAK and p130Cas in other cell types (28Harte M.T. Hildebrand J.D. Burnham M.R. Bouton A.H. Parsons J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13649-13655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that this adaptor protein is a necessary link between PYK2 and FAK activation. On the other hand, the PYK2-Src complex that forms in response to Ang II activation (6Sabri A. Govindarajan G. Griffin T. Byron K. Samarel A. Lucchesi P. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 841-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) may directly activate FAK. Furthermore, PYK2 can localize into focal adhesions in response to G-protein-coupled receptor and protein kinase C activation, resulting in PYK2 binding to the focal adhesion proteins paxillin and p130Cas (29Litvak V. Tian D. Shaul Y.D. Lev S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32736-32746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In summary, our data establish a requirement for PYK2 in the activation of two signaling pathways implicated in the regulation of VSMC growth, the ERK1/2 and the PI3-kinase/Akt pathways, in response to Ang II. Furthermore, we establish a requirement for PYK2 in the initiation of Ang II-induced VSMC protein synthesis, the major hallmark of VSMC hypertrophy. Thus, PYK2 may represent an important molecular target for molecular and pharmacological strategies to minimize VSMC growthin vivo."

A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar). We investigated the regulation of gene expression in rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMC) exposed to TG by utilizing the fluorescent differential display technique (3Ito T. Kito K. Adati N. Mitsui Y. Hagiwara H. Sakaki Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We compared the complementary DNA fragments from differentially expressed RASMC mRNAs following 3 h treatment with either vehicle or 100 nm TG. This analysis resulted in the identification of the rat homologue of NFIL3/E4BP4 as a TG-inducible gene. NFIL3/E4BP4 was originally isolated as a novel member of the bZIP family of DNA-binding proteins that displays an unusual DNA binding specificity which overlaps that of the activating transcription factor family and cAMP response element-binding protein (4Cowell I.G. Skinner A. Hurst H.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3070-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). NFIL3/E4BP4 repressed promoter activity and this repression was mediated through the cAMP response element/activating transcription factor-like site (5Chen W.J. Lewis K.S. Chandra G. Cogswell J.P. Stinnett S.W. Kadwell S.H. Gray J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). NFIL3/E4BP4 might play a role in the glucocorticoid repression of several genes, because NFIL3/E4BP4 was induced by the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (6Wallace A.D. Wheeler T.T. Young D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Moreover, NFIL3/E4BP4 repressed the stimulating activity of box α, which is an essential element that positively regulates the transcription of humanhepatitis B virus genes (7Lai C.K. Ting L.P. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3197-3209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The potent suppression of box α activity by NFIL3/E4BP4 may contribute to the silencing ofhepatitis B virus gene expression (7Lai C.K. Ting L.P. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3197-3209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NFIL3/E4BP4 also plays an important role in the expression of IL-3 in T cells (8Zhang W. Zhang J. Kornuc M. Kwan K. Frank R. Nimer S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6055-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In mouse pro-B cell lines, NFIL3/E4BP4 was also regulated as a delayed-early IL-3 responsive gene, requiring de novoprotein synthesis (9Ikushima S. Inukai T. Inaba T. Nimer S.D. Cleveland J.L. Look A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2609-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the absence of IL-3, enforced expression of human NFIL3/E4BP4 promoted the survival but not the growth of IL-3-dependent pro-B cells, indicating that induction of NFIL3/E4BP4 is one of the mechanisms through which IL-3 suppresses apoptosis (9Ikushima S. Inukai T. Inaba T. Nimer S.D. Cleveland J.L. Look A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2609-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been found that the expression of NFIL3/E4BP4 was regulated by oncogenic Ras mutant proteins through both the Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways in murine Pro-B lymphocytes (10Kuribara R. Kinoshita T. Miyajima A. Shinjyo T. Yoshihara T. Inukai T. Ozawa K. Look A.T. Inaba T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2754-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Ras-NFIL3/E4BP4 pathways may be common targets for a variety of oncogenes (10Kuribara R. Kinoshita T. Miyajima A. Shinjyo T. Yoshihara T. Inukai T. Ozawa K. Look A.T. Inaba T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2754-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe the cloning and calcium regulation of expression of rat NFIL3/E4BP4 in RASMC. We show that TG induced ratNFIL3/E4BP4 gene expression by activating the calcineurin/NFAT and by CaM kinase signaling. Thus, calcium signaling may be critical for the regulation of NFIL3/E4BP4 through calcineurin/NFAT and CaM kinase signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells. Thapsigargin, calcium ionophore A23187, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), actinomycin D, and cycloheximide were purchased from Sigma. Cyclosporin A, FK506, KN-93, and PD98059 were purchased from CalBiochem. KN-92 was purchased from SeikagakuKogyo Co. Tokyo, Japan. For cloning the 3′-half of the rat NFIL3/E4BP4 cDNA, we performed a rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) (11Frohman M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 340-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The 3′-half of the full-length cDNA was obtained using the primers 5′-TTACCGCACAAGCTCCGGATTAAAG-3′ and 5′-CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′ for the first RACE and 5′-GCAGATGCGCTAGCCAAAAGACATT-3′ and 5′-ACTCACTATAGGGCTCGAGCGGC-3′ for the second RACE. A rat heart Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH) was used for the template. Unfortunately, we could not obtain the 5′-half of the full-length cDNA by RACE, and so we performed polymerase chain reactions (PCR) using a degenerate primer. The 5′-half of the full-length cDNA was obtained by using the primers 5′-AAGGMKYCTGACRGATTTAYCC-3′ and 5′-ATGTTCGTCACCTGCACCGAGAAAG-3′. The PCR products were sequenced using an automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Northern blotting analysis was carried out using Rat Multiple Tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH). 32P-Random prime-labeled fragment of the rat NFIL3/E4BP4 cDNA (nucleotides 1093–1701) probe was synthesized with Strip-EZ DNA (Ambion). The heat-denatured cDNA probe was added at 2 × 106 cpm/ml to ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH). The probe was hybridized to the RNA blots for 1 h at 65 °C. The membrane was washed according to the manufacturer's protocol and exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C. The filter was re-probed with32P-random prime-labeled fragment of the rat β-actin cDNA to ensure approximately equally loading of RNA samples. The dominant negative human calcineurin (12Shibasaki F. Price E.R. Milan D. McKeon F. Nature. 1996; 382: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) and NFAT (13Chow C.W. Rincon M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2300-2307Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) were constructed as described previously. Briefly, the human calcineurin A2 coding region (aa 1–407) and human NFAT3 coding region (aa 1–160) were obtained by PCR using a human heart Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH) as template. The PCR products of calcineurin A2 and NFAT3 were subcloned into theEcoRI and NotI sites of the plasmid vector pcDNA.3.1/His (Invitrogen). The pcDNA-Luc expression vector was prepared by subcloning the luciferase coding region into theEcoRI and NotI sites of pcDNA.3.1/His expression vector. The sequence of all PCR-derived constructs was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. In vitrodirected mutagenesis was performed by using the commonly used overlap-extension method (14Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst .). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). Synthetic oligonucleotide primers containing the desired mutations and complementary to opposite strands of the corresponding plasmid constructs were extended by using KOD-plus DNA polymerase (TOYOBO), generating mutated plasmids. Primers used were pcD-CNA2 (H101Q) mutated primer: 5′-TGTGTGGTGACATCCAgGGCCAATTTTTTG-3′, pcD-CNA2 (H290Q) mutated primer: 5′-TTATTAGAGCTCAgGAAGCTCAAGATGCAG-3′, pcD-NFAT3 (AxIxIA) mutated primer: 5′- GAGTGTgCCAGCATCCGCATCgCCTCCATC-3′, and pcD-NFAT3 (AxAxIA) mutated primer: 5′- GAGTGTgCCAGCgcCCGCATCgCCTCCATC-3′. Lowercase letters in the sequence of primers indicated mutated positions. Mutagenesis of more than one site was done by subsequent mutation of the corresponding previously mutated construct. The nucleotide sequence of the constructs was confirmed by automatic DNA sequencing. Rat aortic smooth muscle cells (A7r5 cells, CRL-1444) were obtained from the American Type and Culture Collection. A7r5 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Life Technologies), 25 μg/ml streptomycin, and 25 units/ml penicillin (Life Technologies). Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. All experiments were conducted on cells at passages 2–5. Quiescent A7r5 cells were obtained by incubation of preconfluent cell cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.5% fetal calf serum for 48 h after which drugs were added to the culture medium. For transient transfection experiments, A7r5 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in a 25-cm2 flask. Cells in the logarithmic growth phase were transfected in 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 0.5% fetal calf serum using 1 μg of the indicated plasmid, 1 μg of pcDNA-Luc, and 8 μl of Tfx-50 (Promega). Transfected A7r5 cells were incubated for 48 h and exposed to vehicle or 30 nm TG for 3 h. Total RNAs were isolated and purified by using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene) reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNAs (0.5–1 μg) were converted to cDNA using oligo(dT)11–18 primer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After synthesis of cDNA, the reaction mixtures were diluted 5-fold by addition of TE (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) for real time RT-PCR. To monitor mRNA expression, we used real time RT-PCR analysis. This novel approach has been described previously (15Heid C.A. Stevens J. Livak K.J. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 986-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (5040) Google Scholar, 16Gibson U.E. Heid C.A. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar). For rat NFIL3 real time RT-PCR analysis, the following primers were used; rNFIL3U, 5′-AAGGGCCCCATCCATTCT-3′; and rNFIL3L, 5′-TGAGGGACCAATCTTGAA-3′. The fluorescent probe for the real time RT-PCR was rNFIL3P, 5′-AAAGCCAAGGCCATGCAGGTCAA-3′. The GAPDH primers and probe (TaqMan GAPDH detection reagents) were purchased from Applied Biosystems. For luciferase real time RT-PCR analysis, the following primers were used: LucU, 5′- TGTCGCTCTGCCTCATAGAACTG-3′; and LucL, 5′- CAGCAGCGCACTTTGAATCTTG-3′. The fluorescent probe for the real time PCR was LucP: 5′- CATTCCGGATACTGCGATTTTAAGTGT-3′. The RT-PCR reaction and the resulting relative increase in reporter fluorescent dye emission were monitored in real time by the 7700 sequence detection program (Applied Biosystems). Conditions were as follows: 1 cycle at 50 °C for 10 min, 1 cycle at 94 °C for 15 min, 40 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 1 min. To study the effect of elevated intracellular Ca2+ concentration on gene expression, RASMC were treated with 100 nm TG for 3 h. RNA was isolated from non-stimulated or TG-stimulated RASMC and subjected to a fluorescent differential display (3Ito T. Kito K. Adati N. Mitsui Y. Hagiwara H. Sakaki Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). A highly induced band was reproducibly displayed when the primer pair G(T)15A and 5′-GAAACGGGTG-3′ was used. This band was cut from the gel, re-amplified, and subjected to DNA sequence analysis. Comparison the nucleotide sequence with GenBankTM/EMBL/DDBJ DNA data bases revealed 74% identity with human NFIL3/E4BP4 (4Cowell I.G. Skinner A. Hurst H.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3070-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 8Zhang W. Zhang J. Kornuc M. Kwan K. Frank R. Nimer S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6055-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and 94% identity with mouse NFIL3/E4BP4 (9Ikushima S. Inukai T. Inaba T. Nimer S.D. Cleveland J.L. Look A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2609-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the clone might be a rat homologue of NFIL3/E4BP4. To obtain the full-length cDNA of rat NFIL3/E4BP4, we used polymerase chain reaction. The 3′-half of the full-length cDNA was obtained by the 3′-RACE technique. Because we could not obtain any of the 5′-half of the cDNA using RACE, we designed a degenerate primer from the mouse NFIL3/E4BP4 sequence (clone IMAGE: 1331717) to clone the 5′-half. DNA sequencing of several subcloned PCR-generated cDNAs revealed a long open reading frame commencing with an ATG codon 127 base pairs from the 5′ end of the cDNA sequence (Fig. 1). This ATG presumably represents the initiation codon, since a TGA stop codon is positioned 69 base pairs upstream of this triplet in the cDNA sequence. The open reading frame terminated at a TAA stop codon and was followed by 315 base pairs of 3′-untranslated region, including a canonical AATAAA polyadenylation signal. The molecular mass of the rat NFIL3/E4BP4 was calculated to be 50.8 kDa from an open reading frame containing 462 amino acids. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of rat, mouse (9Ikushima S. Inukai T. Inaba T. Nimer S.D. Cleveland J.L. Look A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The characteristic features of this family are a region of basic amino acids that could bind DNA (aa 79–93) (17Vinson C.R. Sigler P.B. McKnight S.L. Science. 1989; 246: 911-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar), a region containing leucine residues repeated every seven amino acids (aa 101–122) (18Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2547) Google Scholar), and a novel transcriptional repressor domain (aa 299–363) (19Cowell I.G. Hurst H.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). All these characteristic regions are well conserved across rat, mouse, and human NFIL3/E4BP4. Northern hybridization was performed to analyze the tissue distribution of rat NFIL3/E4BP4 (Fig. 3). A 2.5-kilobase transcript could be detected in all tissues except the pancreas. Modest expression was seen in heart, lung, and skeletal muscle. Strongest expression was seen in liver, although human E4BP4 is expressed very little in the liver (7Lai C.K. Ting L.P. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3197-3209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The blot was subsequently reprobed with a radiolabeled rat β-actin cDNA to ensure equal loading. Real-time RT-PCR analysis was then performed to confirm the differential display results indicating that rat NFIL3/E4BP4 was a TG-inducible gene. As shown in Fig. 4 A, treatment with TG resulted in a marked increase in rat NFIL3/E4BP4 mRNA levels. An elevation in NFIL3/E4BP4 mRNA levels was apparent within 3 h, peaked at 6 h of treatment (20-fold) and expression returned to almost basal levels by 12 h. Dose dependence of NFIL3/E4BP4 mRNA induction by TG was also examined. The induction was increased from 1 to 30 nm with almost no further increases at higher concentrations (Fig.4 B). TG induces both elevations of intracellular Ca2+ concentration (2Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar) and an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response (20Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether a range of different stress-inducing conditions induced NFIL3/E4BP4. RASMC were exposed to one or the other of the following for a period of 3 h: 300 nm TG, 100 nmcalcium ionophore A23187, or 5 μg/ml tunicamycin, an inhibitor ofN-linked glycosylation. After treatment, RNA was isolated from drug-treated cells and real time RT-PCR analysis was performed to measure rat NFIL3/E4BP4 mRNA levels. NFIL3/E4BP4 mRNA was induced by TG (12-fold) and A23187 (10-fold). Tunicamycin also induced the expression of NFIL3/E4BP4 mRNA (2.8-fold), but the induction was much less than by TG and A23187 (Fig.5 A). Both TG and A23187deplete the ER of stored Ca2+ and cause an influx of Ca2+ into the cells leading to a sustained rise in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration (1Rosen L.B. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1995; 30: 225-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The depletion of stored Ca2+ in ER by TG and A23187 also induced the ER stress response (20Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar, 21Kokame K. Agarwala K.L. Kato H. Miyata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32846-32853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). On the other hand, tunicamycin inhibits correct folding and assembly of glycoproteins within the ER and thus also activates the ER stress responses (20Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). These results suggest that induction of NFIL3/E4BP4 may occur predominantly as a result of elevation of the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. To further support a role for elevation of cytosolic Ca2+concentration mediating gene induction by TG, we next examined whether blocking the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration could prevent expression of the NFIL3/E4BP4 mRNA. As shown in Fig.5 B, pretreatment of A7r5 cells with the extracellular Ca2+ chelating agent EGTA resulted in significant inhibition of TG-induced expression of NFIL3/E4BP4. Almost complete inhibition was observed when A7r5 cells were treated with 10 μm BAPTA-AM, a cell permeable Ca2+ chelating agent (Fig. 5 B). These results suggest that increased cytosolic Ca2+ concentration is necessary to induceNFIL3/E4BP4 gene expression by TG. Because increased cytosolic Ca2+ concentration is necessary to induce NFIL3/E4BP4 gene expression by TG, we investigated the effects of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase and protein kinases on NFIL3/E4BP4 expression. Cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506, in complex with their immunophilin receptors, specifically inhibit the Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein phosphatase, PP2B, also known as calcineurin (22Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3634) Google Scholar). These two inhibitors were investigated along with KN-93, an inhibitor of CaM kinase II (23Sumi M. Kiuchi K. Ishikawa T. Ishii A. Hagiwara M. Nagatsu T. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 968-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). In the absence of TG, CsA, FK506, or KN-93 did not significantly influence NFIL3/E4BP4 mRNA levels. In the presence of TG, both CsA and FK506 significantly inhibited the increase in NFIL3/E4BP4. Moreover, KN-93 markedly reduced the increase in NFIL3/E4BP4 mRNA by TG. In contrast, KN-92, an inactive analog of KN-93, displayed much less inhibition than KN-93. These results suggest that the calcium dependent activation ofNFIL3/E4BP4 gene expression might be mediated by calcineurin and CaM kinase. Next, we explored the effect of the RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D on the induction of NFIL3/E4BP4 mRNA levels by TG. A7r5 cells were treated with TG for 3 h, with or without pretreatment with actinomycin D. RNA was isolated, and NFIL3/E4BP4 mRNA levels were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. Pretreatment with actinomycin D completely prevented the induction of NFIL3/E4BP4 mRNA by TG (Fig.7). Thus, the increase in NFIL3/E4BP4 mRNA expression after TG addition is due, at least in part, to transcriptional activation of the NFIL3/E4BP4 gene. We next used the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide to determine whether TG-induced expression of NFIL3/E4BP4 mRNA was dependent onde novo protein synthesis. As shown in Fig. 7, A7r5 cells were either left untreated or treated with TG for 3 h with or without pretreatment of cycloheximide. The pretreatment of cycloheximide to TG-stimulated cells did not significantly preventNFIL3/E4BP4 gene induction (Fig. 7). These results indicate that the induction of NFIL3/E4BP4 mRNA by TG does not requirede novo protein synthesis for transcriptional activation. The immunosuppressive drugs CsA and FK506 target the phosphatase activity of calcineurin. But it has also been reported that CsA and FK506 could target other proteins (e.g. JNK (24Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar) and p38(25)). To further verify that calcineurin is involved in TG-induced expression of NFIL3/E4BP4 mRNA, we transfected dominant negative calcineurin (12Shibasaki F. Price E.R. Milan D. McKeon F. Nature. 1996; 382: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) into A7r5 cells. Calcineurin dephosphorylates NFAT proteins and induces their translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. The dominant negative calcineurin is exclusively cytoplasmic and interferes with NFAT translocation (12Shibasaki F. Price E.R. Milan D. McKeon F. Nature. 1996; 382: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.8, the dominant negative calcineurin (H101Q/H290Q) caused inhibition of TG-induced expression of NFIL3/E4BP4 mRNA compared with the control. These data indicate that calcineurin activity is required for the induction of NFIL3/E4BP4 mRNA expression by TG. Next, the involvement of NFAT in the regulation of NFIL3/E4BP4 expression by TG was analyzed by using dominant negative NFAT (dnNFAT) (13Chow C.W. Rincon M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2300-2307Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The dnNFAT selectively inhibited NFAT transcription activity by interfering with the activation-induced nuclear import of NFAT through the consensus sequence PxIxIT (13Chow C.W. Rincon M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2300-2307Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 26Garcia-Cozar F.J. Okamura H. Aramburu J.F. Shaw K.T.Y. Pelletier L. Showalter R. Villafranca E. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23877-23883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Interfering with the docking of calcineurin at the PxIxIT sequence impairs NFAT activation and NFAT-dependent reporter gene expression (13Chow C.W. Rincon M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2300-2307Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar,27Aramburu J. Yaffe M.B. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Cantley L.C. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Science. 1999; 285: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 9, the induction of NFIL3/E4BP4 mRNA by TG was markedly reduced in cells transfected dnNFAT (PxIxIT) although significantly less so with the mutated construct (AxIxIA). This inhibitory effect was similar to the case of the inhibition of IL-2 production by the dnNFAT (13Chow C.W. Rincon M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2300-2307Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). These data indicate that NFAT transcription activity is required forNFIL3/E4BP4 gene expression induced by TG. This study has demonstrated that the expression of NFIL3/E4BP4 mRNA is induced by calcium signaling pathways. The endoplasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase inhibitor TG depletes Ca2+ from internal stores, leading to Ca2+influx and thus, to a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i (1Rosen L.B. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1995; 30: 225-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). TG also induces an ER stress response (20Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that chelation of extracellular and intracellular Ca2+ by EGTA and BAPTA-AM, respectively, suppressed the induction of NFIL3/E4BP4 mRNA by TG. We also demonstrated that the induction of NFIL3/E4BP4 mRNA by tunicamycin, which induces an ER stress response (20Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar) without disturbing Ca2+ homeostasis, was less than with TG or A23187. These results suggest that an increase in [Ca2+]i is critically involved in NFIL3/E4BP4 mRNA induction by TG. Fluxes in the amount of intracellular Ca2+ are important determinants of gene expression (1Rosen L.B. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1995; 30: 225-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Of the many types of Ca2+-binding proteins, calmodulin (CaM) is of major importance in vascular smooth muscle cell function. Ca2+/CaM regulates functional proteins such as calcineurin (28Crabtree G.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 611-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar) and CaM kinase (29Means A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 4-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) that play important roles in gene expression in vascular smooth muscle cells. To evaluate the relative regulatory roles of calcineurin and CaM kinase, we tested the effect of inhibitors of calcineurin and CaM kinase on TG-induced NFIL3/E4BP4 mRNA expression. We have demonstrated that both CsA and FK506 inhibited the induction of NFIL3/E4BP4 mRNA. The induction of NFIL3/E4BP4 mRNA by TG was also inhibited by KN-93. These results indicate that TG induces the NFIL3/E4BP4 gene expression by calcineurin and CaM kinase-dependent mechanisms. To further verify that TG involves calcineurin in the induction of NFIL3/E4BP4 mRNA, we transfected dominant negative calcineurin into A7r5 cells. Expression of dominant negative calcineurin strongly suppressed the induction of NFIL3/E4BP4 mRNA by TG. All of these results strongly suggest that calcineurin plays a critical role in the selective induction of NFIL3/E4BP4 mRNA by TG. Calcineurin regulates immune response genes through dephosphorylation of NFAT (28Crabtree G.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 611-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar).

Replacement of the native, skeletal calcium-binding subunit of troponin, troponin C, with mixtures of functional cardiac and mutant cardiac troponin C insensitive to calcium and permanently inactive provides a novel method to alter the number of myosin cross-bridges capable of binding to the actin filament. Extraction of skeletal troponin C and replacement with functional and mutant cardiac troponin C were used to evaluate the relationship between the extent of thin filament activation (fractional calcium binding), isometric force, and the rate of force generation in muscle fibers independent of the calcium concentration. The experiments showed a direct, linear relationship between force and the number of cross-bridges attaching to the thin filament. Further, above 35% maximal isometric activation, following partial replacement with mixtures of cardiac and mutant troponin C, the rate of force generation was independent of the number of actin sites available for cross-bridge interaction at saturating calcium concentrations. This contrasts with the marked decrease in the rate of force generation when force was reduced by decreasing the calcium concentration. The results are consistent with hypotheses proposing that calcium controls the transition between weakly and strongly bound cross-bridge states.

In muscle fibers, actin and myosin interaction is regulated by the intracellular calcium concentration acting through the thin filament regulatory proteins, the troponin complex, and tropomyosin. Until calcium binds to the troponin complex, the muscle fiber remains relaxed with >95% of the myosin cross-bridges detached (1Bagshaw C.R. Trentham D.R. Biochem. J. 1974; 141: 331-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 2Ma Y. Taylor E.W. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1542-1553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The influx of calcium into the filament lattice of muscle fibers stimulates the association of actin and myosin enabling the production of force or shortening and accelerating the actomyosin ATPase rate by >100-fold during isometric contraction. Several models have been postulated to account for this control. The steric-blocking model of cross-bridge regulation asserts that tropomyosin/troponin (Tm/Tn)1prevents cross-bridge attachment in the absence of calcium by “blocking” cross-bridge access to binding sites on the thin filament (3Huxley H.E. Cold S pring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1972; 37: 361-376Crossref Google Scholar, 4Parry D.A.D. Squire J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 75: 33-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the kinetic regulation model assumes that the cross-bridges can, under all conditions, bind weakly to the thin filament, and calcium controls the kinetics of cross-bridge turnover via changes in the weakly bound to strongly bound cross-bridge transition (5Chalovich J.M. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2432-2437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Brenner B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3265-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). More recently, three-dimensional reconstructions of electron micrographs have identified three distinct structural states of the thin filament (7Lehman W. Vibert P. Uman P. Craig R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 251: 191-196Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 8Vibert P. Craig R. Lehman W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 9Xu C. Craig R. Tobacman L.S. Horowitz R. Lehman W. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 985-992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In the absence of calcium, tropomyosin blocks strong myosin binding sites on actin. Following Ca2+binding to the troponin complex, the tropomyosin shifts away from the myosin binding sites but does not completely expose all the putative strong binding sites on actin. Further movement of the tropomyosin requires strong cross-bridge binding to fully expose the myosin binding sites. Full activation of the thin filament requires Ca2+binding to the troponin complex and subsequent strong cross-bridge binding to the thin filament. Brenner and Eisenberg (10Brenner B. Eisenberg E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3542-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) developed a method to measure the kinetics of cross-bridge transitions from weakly bound to force-producing states in activated muscle fibers and found the rate of tension development (ktr) to be calcium-sensitive (6Brenner B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3265-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). This result is inconsistent with the steric-blocking mechanism, and Brenner (6Brenner B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3265-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) suggested that Tm/Tn controlled the rate of Pirelease. However, subsequent work showed that the kinetics of Pi release are independent of [Ca2+] (11Millar N.C. Homsher E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20234-20240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Walker J.W. Lu Z. Moss R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 276: 2459-2466Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 13Fortune N.S.

J. 2000; 78: 3081-3092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Further, others have found the kinetics of cross-bridge cycling to be unaffected by compounds that affect thin filament dynamics (15Wahr P.A. Metzger J.M. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2166-2176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies indicate that calcium is regulating muscle activation by control of cross-bridge access. To reconcile these observations with Brenner's data and hypothesis it was proposed that [Ca2+] controls the transition from weak to strong cross-bridge binding preceding the generation of force (11Millar N.C. Homsher E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20234-20240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Regnier M. Morris C. Homsher E. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1532-C1539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To this point, studies have investigated calcium regulation of muscle contraction by adding various compounds, removing proteins, or adjusting the free calcium concentration. These investigations have left several issues unresolved. In particular, when the free calcium concentration rises, it is unclear how this increases the rate of force generation. Does the effect require a relatively high density of myosin binding to actin, which tends to activate the thin filament, or does calcium binding to troponin have a more direct effect onktr? In the present study we describe a method to control the fraction of troponin complexes to which calcium is bound, thereby also controlling the fraction of the thin filament available for myosin binding while maintaining the free calcium concentration constant at a high level. The native skeletal TnC was extracted from thin filaments of skinned muscle fibers and replaced with variable combinations of cardiac TnC and an inactive cardiac mutant TnC, CBMIITnC (17Putkey J.A. Sweeney H.L. Campbell S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12370-12378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Huynh Q. Butters C.A. Leiden J.M. Tobacman L.S. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1447-1455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Cardiac TnC has a single regulatory calcium binding site (site II) as site I does not contain the necessary charged residues to bind calcium (19Grabarek Z. Grabarek J. Leavis P. Gergely J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14098-14102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Leavis P. Gergely J. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 16: 235-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Mutation of two negatively charged residues (Asp-65 and Glu-66) to neutral alanine residues prevents calcium binding to site II (18Huynh Q. Butters C.A. Leiden J.M. Tobacman L.S. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1447-1455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and blocks activation of thin filament-myosin S1 MgATPase activity by Ca2+ (21Butters C.A. Tobacman J.B. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13196-13202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The CBMII TnC can be exchanged onto skinned muscle fiber thin filaments following extraction of the native skeletal TnC, effectively removing any calcium-dependent activation of the muscle fiber. Complete replacement of endogenous TnC with a similar CBMII TnC completely relaxed skeletal muscle fibers and rendered them insensitive to [Ca2+] (17Putkey J.A. Sweeney H.L. Campbell S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12370-12378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this way, we have been able to investigate isometric force and the rate of force generation as functions of the fraction of the thin filament that is able to bind myosin under conditions where calcium binding to troponin is fixed at a level determined by the CBMII TnC content. Isometric tension and the rate of force redevelopment were measured in muscle fibers following TnC replacement with ratios of cTnC and CBMII TnC. The data show that isometric force is directly proportional to the number of active thin filament units (A7TmTn) at saturating calcium, and the rate of force redevelopment is unaffected by a reduction in cross-bridge number. The results suggest thatktr is primarily controlled by calcium binding to troponin rather than the density of cross-bridges binding to the actin filament. Together, the results suggest that calcium controls cross-bridge access to the thin filament by regulating an equilibrium between weakly (non-productively) and strongly (productively) bound, but non-force-bearing cross-bridges. The present work accounts for the discrepancies between the opposing kinetic and steric-blocking models of thin filament regulation. A preliminary report of this work was published previously (22Morris C. Tobacman L.S. Homsher E. Biophys. J. 1998; 74 (. (abstr.)): A347Google Scholar). All fiber solutions contained 100 mm N,N-bis[2hydroxyehtyl]-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (BES), pH 7.1, at 15 °C, 5 mm MgATP, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 20 mm potassium acetate, 15 mm creatine phosphate, 200 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 1 mm dithiothreitol with an ionic strength of 200 mm. Relaxing (REL) and activating solutions also contained 20 mm EGTA. Calcium was added as Ca2+-K+-EGTA, and the pCa was varied by adjusting the proportions of K+-EGTA and Ca2+-K+-EGTA. The preactivating solution contained 2 mm K+-EGTA and 18 mm1,6-diaminohexane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (HDTA). The composition of the solutions was calculated using the QuickBasic program, SOLUTION (11Millar N.C. Homsher E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20234-20240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Psoas muscle fibers were dissected from female New Zealand white rabbits, glycerinated, and stored as described by Millar and Homsher (11Millar N.C. Homsher E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20234-20240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Single fibers were dissected, and the ends were fixed by flowing 1% glutaraldehyde in 50% glycerol over each end of the fiber. Aluminum T-clips were then attached to the ends, and the fibers were mounted between a force transducer (SensoNor AE801 strain gauge) and a shaker motor (Ling 100A). The sarcomere length was set to 2.6 μm/sarcomere (measured by He:Ne laser diffraction), and the fiber width and total length were measured. The rate of tension redevelopment (ktr) was measured by activating the fiber, and after reaching steady-state isometric tension, abruptly shortening the fiber by ∼20%, reducing force to zero. The fiber was held at this length for 25 ms while the fiber shortened at maximal velocity, and then the fiber was rapidly restretched to its original length (6Brenner B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3265-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). All mechanical measurements were performed at 15 °C. Tension and displacement signals were recorded and the digitized records were analyzed using KFIT (11Millar N.C. Homsher E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20234-20240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and SigmaPlot 4.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Thektr records were fit by a single exponential equation of the form P = Po + ΔP (1 − e −kt), whereP is the tension, Po is the initial force, ΔP is the amplitude of the redeveloped tension, andk is the ktr. Force-pCa curves were fit to the Hill Equation in the formP = Po/(1 + 10nH( pK−p Ca) wherePo is maximal force produced (pCa 4.5),pK (pCa50) is the calcium concentration yielding 0.5 Po andnH is the Hill coefficient. Significance was determined using Student's t test and the confidence level was set at p < 0.05. The data were reported as mean ± S.E. with (n) the number of fibers analyzed. The steady-state solutions for the fraction of the cross-bridges in the weakly bound (Wo), strongly bound (So), and force-exerting (Fo) states shown in Scheme 1 are given by the equation, Wo=(k+2*k3+k−1*k3+k−1*k−2)/DSo=(k+1*k3+k+1*k−2)/DFo=(k+1*k+2)/DEquation 1 whereD=k+2*k3+k−1*k3+k−1*k−2+k+1*k3+k+1*k+2+k+1*k−2Equation 2 The solution for the fraction of cross-bridges in the force-exerting state F(t) at anytime, t, after changing any of the rate constants from a steady-state value is given by the equation,F(t)=C+A*expλ1*t+B*expλ2*tEquation 3 whereA=λ1*Z+λ12*Fo+k+1+k+2/λ1*λ1−λ2B=−λ2*Z+λ22*Fo−k+1+k+2/λ2*λ1−λ2C=k+1+k+2/λ1*λ2Z=k+2*So+k+1+k−1+k+2*Foλ1=−b+b2−4c1/2/2λ2=−b−b2−4c1/2/2b=k+1+k−1+k+2+k−2+k3c=k+1*k+2+k−2+k3*k+1+k−1+k+2+k−1*k−2nEquation 4 To extract the endogenous skeletal TnC from the fibers, the sarcomere length was increased to >3.0 μm in REL (23Yates L.D. Coby R.L. Luo Z. Gordon A.M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1993; 14: 392-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and the fibers were transferred to a solution containing 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.2), and 0.5 mm trifluoperazine dihydrochloride at 15–17 °C (24Metzger J.M. Greaser M.L. Moss R.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 93: 855-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The fibers were incubated until the Ca2+-activated isometric tension fell below 10%Po, generally within 10 min. The fibers were reconstituted by incubation in REL containing 0.5 mg/ml TnC for 1 min followed by a wash in REL for 30 s. This was repeated until Ca2+-dependent tension reached a maximal, constant value. Skeletal TnC was kindly provided by Marion Greaser (University of Wisconsin) and purified as described by Greaser and Gergely (25Greaser M.L. Gergely J. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2125-2133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cardiac TnC (cTnC and CBMIITnC) were isolated as described (18Huynh Q. Butters C.A. Leiden J.M. Tobacman L.S. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1447-1455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The extraction and reconstitution of the troponin C was quantified using SDS-PAGE. Muscle fibers containing sTnC, cTnC, or ratios of CBMII TnC:cTnC were placed in sample buffer, heated to 95 °C for 3 min, and sonicated to denature and solubilize the muscle fiber. The samples were loaded onto a 12% Tris·HCl separating gel. Following electrophoresis, the gels were stained using the silver stain technique of Guilian et al. (26Giulian G.G. Moss R.L. Greaser M.L. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 129: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. After staining, the gels were dried and scanned. Theapparent molecular mass of CBMIITnC is 1 kDa < purified cTnC, allowing quantitative separation of the two proteins by their mobilities. Gels were analyzed using a GS-700 scanning densitometer (Bio-Rad) normalizing bands to the area under the myosin light chain 1 peak. The relative content of cTnC and CBMII TnC was determined from the ratio of cTnC:(cTnC + CBMII TnC) after accounting for differences in staining intensity and a background peak at the same position as CBMII TnC. To investigate the effects of cardiac and CBMII TnC replacement on muscle function, it was necessary to effectively remove the native sTnC from the muscle fibers. Extraction reduced the Ca2+-dependent force to 8.1% (±1.1) of the maximal force obtained at pCa 4.5 (Po = 146.7 (±3.8) kN/m2,n = 45). Extraction of the sTnC and subsequent reconstitution with purified sTnC returned maximal Ca2+-dependent force to 125.5 ± 10.3 kN/m2 or 86 ± 3% Po(n = 5). Reconstitution with cTnC returned maximal isometric force to 96.9 (±4.7) kN/m2 (n = 17) or 65.4% (± 5.0) of that observed prior to extraction. It was important to determine whether the cardiac TnC or CBMII TnC preferentially bound to the fiber thin filaments under the extraction/replacement procedure. The difference in the apparent molecular weights of cTnC and CBMII TnC made quantification possible. Fig. 1 shows two lanes (A) and the associated profiles (B) of a gel containing fiber segments reconstituted with 100% cTnC and 50% cTnC:50% CBMII TnC. Determination of the relative proportion of cTnC in fibers reconstituted with various ratios of cTnC and CBMII TnC as a function of the relative amount of cTnC added to the reconstitution solution is shown in Fig. 2. The results demonstrate that the binding of cTnC and CBMII TnC to the thin filaments of fibers is similar under the reconstitution conditions used (pCa 9.0), which is consistent with the binding studies performed using cTn and CBMII Tn complexes (18Huynh Q. Butters C.A. Leiden J.M. Tobacman L.S. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1447-1455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).Figure 2Relative cTnC content of fibers reconstituted with various ratios of cTnC : CBMII TnC.

The difference in calcium sensitivity between the control fibers containing native sTnC and those after cTnC replacement is shown in Fig.3. Following replacement of sTnC with cTnC the Hill coefficient was reduced from 2.83 (±0.11) to 1.95 (±0.13) and the pCa50 shifted from 6.72 (±0.01) to 6.64 (±0.02); both changes are significant (p < 0.05). The reduction in the Hill coefficient and shift in pCa50 after replacement with cTnC have been reported previously (27Moss R.L. Lauer M.R. Giulian G.G. Greaser M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6096-6099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Metzger J.M. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1996; 492: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Extraction of endogenous sTnC and replacement with purified sTnC produced no significant differences (p < 0.01) in the Ca2+ sensitivity (nH = 2.87 (±0.43);pCa50 = 6.74 (±0.03); n = 5). Isometric force is believed to be dependent on the number of cross-bridges attached to the thin filament (29Huxley A.F. Prog. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1957; 7: 255-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Gordon A.M. Huxley A.F. Julian F.J. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1966; 184: 170-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (1970) Google Scholar, 31Edman K.A.P. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1979; 291: 143-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). To determine whether reduction in the level of thin filament activation directly correlates with a decrease in the number of thin filament sites, fibers were reconstituted with various ratios of CBMII:cTnC, and the isometric tension was measured. Fig. 4 demonstrates that tension fell in direct proportion to the reduction in cTnC content of the fiber. Because the cTnC content added correlated well with the amount of cTnC bound to the thin filaments (Fig. 2), the cTnC content is given as the ratio of cTnC added. The tension measured after replacement with CBMII:cTnC was normalized against the average maximal force produced after replacement with 100% cTnC (65.4% of sTnC;n = 17). Regression analysis indicated that the slope was not different from 1 (p > 0.3) and they intercept was not different from 0 (p > 0.2). The direct proportionality of the force reduction to the fractional content of cTnC suggests that there is little cooperativity between the steady-state isometric force and the number of attached cross-bridges at saturating [Ca2+]. The rate of tension redevelopment (6Brenner B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3265-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) is controlled by [Ca2+], which implies regulation of a cross-bridge transition involving force generation (11Millar N.C. Homsher E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20234-20240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Walker J.W. Lu Z. Moss R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 276: 2459-2466Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 32Metzger J.M. Moss R.L. Science. 1990; 247: 1088-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Representative traces ofktr as a function of pCa are shown in Fig. 5 A. It is evident that the Ca2+ sensitivity of force redevelopment is affected by the troponin C isoform. These differences are seen more clearly in Fig.5 B, which shows ktr as a function of the relative tension. Skeletal TnC produced a greater rate of force redevelopment at high calcium concentrations (18.1 ± 0.46 s−1, n = 45 at pCa 4.5) but was reduced almost 10-fold at low [Ca2+]. At pCa 6.0, the force was still ∼98% of that at pCa 4.5 butktr fell to only 14.8 (±1.2) s−1(n = 10). The ktr fell to near minimal values (2.89 ± 0.4 s−1; n = 10) at pCa 6.7 even though isometric force was still ∼50%Po. Replacement with cTnC reduced the maximal ktr atpCa 4.5 to 10.8 (±0.5) s−1 (n= 17). However, reducing the calcium concentration from pCa 4.5 to pCa 7.0 caused the rate of tension redevelopment to fall to 3.32 (±0.36) s−1 (n = 7), only a 3-fold reduction. These results indicate that the rate of tension redevelopment is markedly affected by [Ca2+] regardless of TnC isoform. The TnC isoform bound to the thin filament, however, modulates the rate of tension redevelopment in active muscle fibers (33Chase P.B. Martyn D.A. Hannon J.D. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1994-2001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although ktr is highly sensitive to variations in the [Ca2+], it is unclear whether the effect is caused by [Ca2+]-dependent limits on cross-bridge cycling, cross-bridge number, or both. To evaluate the effects of reducing the cross-bridge number independent of [Ca2+],ktr was measured after extraction and replacement with different ratios of CBMII:cTnC at constant, saturating [Ca2+]. Representative traces ofktr with different ratios of cTnC and CBMII TnC are shown in Fig. 6 A. It is apparent that ktr was largely unaffected by the reduction in the number of actin monomers available for myosin cross-bridge interaction. Isometric tension fell in direct proportion to the addition of CBMII TnC (Fig. 4) whereasktr remained unchanged and near maximal for all conditions except for 75% CBMII TnC (7.24 ± 0.21 s−1; n = 7). Fig. 6 B plotsktr as a function of relative tension in fibers containing 100% cTnC with tension varied by altering thepCa of the activating solution and fibers containing various ratios of CBMII:cTnC. The results indicate thatktr is greatly affected by changes in [Ca2+] but is not sensitive to reductions in the fraction of the thin filament that can be activated and bind cross-bridges until tension is reduced to <35% Po. Huxley's (29Huxley A.F. Prog. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1957; 7: 255-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) two-state model of muscle contraction assumes that isometric force is produced by S1 interactions with the thin filament and therefore is dependent on the number of attached cross-bridges. Gordon et al. (30Gordon A.M. Huxley A.F. Julian F.J. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1966; 184: 170-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (1970) Google Scholar) and Edman (31Edman K.A.P. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1979; 291: 143-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar) found that isometric force is proportional to the degree of thick-thin filament overlap and hence the number of cross-bridges. In this study, we have shown that isometric tension under saturating calcium conditions declines in proportion to calcium binding to troponin. Prior studies have reduced the fraction of the thin filament that can be activated by partial extraction of the endogenous TnC (23Yates L.D. Coby R.L. Luo Z. Gordon A.M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1993; 14: 392-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 27Moss R.L. Lauer M.R. Giulian G.G. Greaser M.L. J. Biol.

The removal of TnC from the troponin complex prevents calcium binding and inactivates the thin filament in the regions containing the partial troponin complexes (TnI-TnT-Tm units). Because TnC and TnI interact with each other in undefined ways (36Farah C.S. Miyamoto C.A. Ramos C.H.I. Da Silva A.C.R. Quaggio R.B. Fujimori K. Smillie L.B. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5230-5240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), TnC extraction may alter several of these interactions and affect other aspects of the thin filament regulatory mechanism (37Mehegan J.P. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 966-972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Replacement of sTnC by either cTnC or CBMII TnC avoids this complication by maintaining a full complement of TnC on the thin filament while reducing the number of potentially active regulatory units. The force-pCa plot of fibers containing sTnC and cTnC (Fig.3) is similar to those obtained previously (11Millar N.C. Homsher E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20234-20240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Moss R.L. Lauer M.R. Giulian G.G. Greaser M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6096-6099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The force is reduced cooperatively as the calcium concentration is lowered in fibers containing either sTnC or cTnC. The reduction in cooperativity (nH) upon reconstitution with cTnC is qualitatively consistent with the presence of only one Ca2+binding site in cTnC. However, the force-pCa relationship in skinned fibers is more cooperative than can be explained by Ca2+ binding to individual troponin subunits. If this were the only cooperative mechanism involved, the maximalnH would be 1.0 for cardiac and 2.0 for skeletal TnC (19Grabarek Z. Grabarek J. Leavis P. Gergely J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14098-14102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Adjacent troponin subunits are connected by tropomyosin, and enhancement of Ca2+ binding via cooperative strong cross-bridge binding may influence the degree of thin filament activation and therefore the mechanism of regulation (21Butters C.A. Tobacman J.B. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13196-13202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 38Chalovich J.M. Pharmacol.

The results obtained here present a clearer picture of what occurs during force generation in isometrically contracting skinned muscle fibers. The most straightforward, although not the only, interpretation of Fig. 4 is that under conditions of saturating calcium (pCa 4.5),"

NGF signals through binding to its receptors, a high affinity tyrosine kinase receptor, TrkA, and a low affinity receptor, p75 (3Friedman W.J. Greene L.A. Exp.

Binding of NGF to its receptors initiates several signal transduction cascades, including, among others, ras-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K), and the cAMP-dependent protein kinase pathways (3Friedman W.J. Greene L.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Some of the downstream targets of the activated protein kinase pathways are transcription factors such as AP-1, cAMP responsive element-binding protein, and NF-κB. Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells have been extensively used to study the molecular mechanisms involved in NGF signaling. PC12 cells are chromaffin-like cells that in response to NGF treatment withdraw from the cell cycle and differentiate into sympathetic-like neurons, a process accompanied by neurite outgrowth, increased electrical excitability, and changes in neurotransmitter synthesis (4Dichter M.A. Tischler A.S.

Ras then cooperates in activation of a serine/threonine kinase, Raf-1, which phosphorylates the dual specificity MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK), which in turn phosphorylates and activates the ERKs, ERK1 and ERK2. Recently, it was demonstrated that activation of ERK in response to NGF in both primary sensory neurons and in PC12 cells also requires activation of the PI3-K pathway (11York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T.

PI3-K is required for internalization of TrkA and for its signaling to ERK via a Ras family member, Rap 1 (11York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J.

Rapid activation of ERK in response to NGF is mediated through Ras, whereas the sustained activation is Rap 1-dependent (11York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J.

Previously, we demonstrated that the NGF-mediated increase in nAChR gene expression is independent of cAMP-dependent protein kinase signaling (21Henderson L.P. Gdovin M.J. Liu C. Gardner P.D. Maue R.A. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1153-1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that NGF treatment of PC12 cells increases the transcriptional activity of the β4 gene promoter (25Hu M. Whiting-Theobald N.L. Gardner P.D. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In this study we investigated the involvement of the other NGF-signaling pathways, namely MAPK, PI3-K, protein kinase C, and phospholipase C, in the regulation of nAChR gene expression. We show that in PC12 cells, activation of PI3-K and one of the components of the MAPK pathway, MEK, is important for up-regulation of β4 subunit gene promoter activity in response to NGF. We also show that NGF-inducible c-Jun can transactivate the promoter of the β4 gene through cooperation with Sp1 protein bound to the β4 promoter at a previously identified Sp1-binding site, a CA box. We further demonstrate that this Sp1-binding site is necessary for the responsiveness of the β4 promoter to NGF. SN17 cells (26Hammond D.N. Lee H.J. Tonsgard J.H. Wainer B.H.

Twenty-four h prior to transfections, SN17 cells were plated at a density of 250,000 cells per 35-mm dish. Transfections were performed by a calcium phosphate method using a commercially available kit (Eppendorf-5 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO). The wild type rat β4-luciferase expression plasmid, pX1B4FH, containing a 226-bpFokI/HindIII fragment spanning nucleotides −89 to +137, relative to the β4 transcription initiation site, and the construct pX1B4FHmut4, containing a mutation in the CA box of the β4 promoter, were described previously (25Hu M.

Cells were transfected with 2.5 μg of test DNA (pX1B4FH or pX1B4FHmut4), 2.5 μg of effector DNA (the empty pCMV5 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) or pCMV-jun constructs), and 2.5 μg of a β-galactosidase expression vector, RSV-βgal. In some cases, no effector DNA was included in the transfections. To ensure that the calcium phosphate/DNA precipitates had equal amounts of DNA, appropriate quantities of pBluescript II SK DNA (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were added to each sample. PC12 cells were transfected in 60-mm dishes at a density of 106cells/ml using 30 μl of LipofectAMINE (2 mg/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.) and 2.5 μg of each DNA. After a 5-h incubation in the lipid/DNA mix, cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fed with growth medium. For experiments involving the pharmacological kinase inhibitors, growth media were supplemented with or without 100 ng/ml NGF and with or without inhibitors, as indicated. All inhibitors were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA) and were used at the following concentrations: MEK inhibitor PD98059 at 100 μm (31Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 19877-19883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), except that 100 ng of the effector DNAs (pActSp1 or pPacJun) were used. The pPacJun plasmid was a kind gift of Dr. J. Noti and is described elsewhere (35Noti J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24038-24045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Forty-eight h following transfection, cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity using a commercially available kit (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) and an Autolumat LB953 luminometer (EG&G Berthold, Gaithersburg, MD). All transfections were done a minimum of two times with two different preparations of plasmid DNAs. To correct for differences in transfection efficiencies between dishes, the luciferase activity in each sample was normalized to the β-galactosidase activity in the same sample, which was measured using a commercially available kit (Galacto-Light; Tropix, Inc., Bedford, MA). Immunoprecipitations and Western blotting were performed as previously described (36Bigger C.B. Melnikova I.N. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25976-25982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) using 250 μg of nuclear extracts prepared from NGF-treated PC12 cells. Anti-c-Jun rabbit polyclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Dignam et al. (37Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) as previously described (38Melnikova I.N. Christy B.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1067-1079PubMed Google Scholar), except that nuclear extracts were dialyzed against RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1%@ sodium dodecyl sulfate). NGF-dependent up-regulation of neuronal nAChR gene expression in PC12 cells is thought to occur partly at the level of transcription (25Hu M. Whiting-Theobald N.L. Gardner P.D. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To investigate which of the NGF-activated pathways is involved in the transcriptional regulation of neuronal nAChR gene expression in PC12 cells, we examined the effects of blocking several of these pathways on the transcriptional activity of the β4 gene promoter. We previously identified a 226-bp promoter fragment of the β4 gene that can confer neuron-specific expression to a reporter gene in transient transfection assays (27Liu Q. Melnikova I.N. Hu M. Gardner P.D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9747-9755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that treatment of PC12 cells with NGF results in a significant increase in β4 promoter activity and that the 226-bp region is sufficient to mediate this response (25Hu M. Whiting-Theobald N.L. Gardner P.D. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar,27Liu Q. Melnikova I.N. Hu M. Gardner P.D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9747-9755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether MEK, PI3-K, protein kinase C, or phospholipase C is involved in the regulation of transcription of the β4 gene through elements in the 5′ regulatory region of the gene. The 226-bp β4 fragment fused upstream of the luciferase gene (pX1B4FH) was transiently transfected into PC12 cells. Following transfection cells were treated with NGF for 36 h. A parallel set of transfected cells was left untreated and served as a control. Consistent with our previous results, 36 h of NGF treatment stimulated β4 promoter activity and resulted in induction of reporter gene activity (Fig. 1). When NGF treatment of the transfected cells was carried out in the presence of PD98059, a selective pharmacological agent that blocks activation of MEK, or LY294002, a specific pharmacological inhibitor of PI3-K, stimulation of the β4 promoter was significantly reduced, as judged by reporter gene activity (Fig. 1). In contrast, inhibitors of phospholipase C, U-73122, and protein kinase C, calphostin C, and bisinodylmalemide, had little effect on the activity of the β4 promoter in transfected cells in response to NGF (Fig. 1). These results suggest that activation of the β4 promoter in response to NGF is mediated in part via the MAPK- and PI3-K-dependent pathways in PC12 cells. This is consistent with a model suggesting that these two pathways share overlapping functions in neuronal cells (12York R.D. Molliver D.C. Grewal S.S. Stenberg P.E. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8069-8083Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In addition, these data indicate that the 226-bp fragment of the β4 promoter contains the necessary elements to mediate the response to ERK activation, a common downstream target of MEK and PI3-K (12York R.D. Molliver D.C. Grewal S.S. Stenberg P.E. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8069-8083Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). It is well established that in PC12 cells, activation of the ERK cascade by NGF induces c-Jun expression and phosphorylation of its gene product (20Leppa S. Saffrich R. Ansorge W. Bohmann D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4404-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). c-Jun is a transcription factor that has been implicated in regulation of gene expression in response to multiple extracellular stimuli (39Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2324) Google Scholar). To address the question whether c-Jun is capable of regulating the activity of the β4 promoter, PC12 cells were transiently transfected with the 226-bp β4 promoter-luciferase construct, pX1B4FH, alone or in combination with an expression construct for c-Jun, pCMV-jun, in which the c-Jun gene is under the control of the CMV promoter, or with an empty parental vector, pCMV5. As shown in Fig.2 A (left side), transfections of the empty expression vector pCMV5 had no effect on reporter gene activity. However, when the β4-luciferase construct was cotransfected with c-Jun, a dramatic increase in reporter gene activity was observed (Fig. 2 A). Similar results were observed in the cholinergic cell line SN17 (Fig. 2 B). Together, these data indicate that, indeed, c-Jun is capable of transactivating the β4 promoter and suggest that c-Jun-responsive elements are present within this 226-bp fragment of the β4 promoter. Jun proteins bind to the DNA sequence 5′-TGACTCA-3′, referred to as an AP-1 site, as homodimers or as heterodimers with Fos proteins (39Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2324) Google Scholar). Interestingly, sequence analysis of the β4 promoter fragment used in these experiments indicates that there are no AP-1-binding sites within this region. It is therefore possible that c-Jun transactivates the β4 promoter through protein-protein interactions with a factor that can bind to β4 regulatory elements. c-Jun has been shown to functionally interact with a number of transcription factors, including members of the Sp family, Sp1 and Sp3 (35Noti J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24038-24045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 40McDonough P.M. Hanford D.S. Sprenkle A.B. Mellon N.R. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol.

Peralta E.G. Maniatis T. Thanos D. Goldfeld A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2239-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Moreover, c-Jun can directly interact with Sp1 in vitro(41Kardassis D. Papakosta P. Pardali K. Moustakas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29572-29581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). This is particularly relevant to the β4 promoter, because we previously reported that both Sp1 and Sp3 can efficiently transactivate this promoter (28Du Q. Melnikova I.N. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19877-19883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 30Bigger C.B. Casanova E.A. Gardner P.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 25976-25982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that c-Jun activates the β4 promoter through protein-protein interactions with Sp1 and/or Sp3. To test this hypothesis, we first wanted to address the question of whether c-Jun and Sp1 are physically associated in PC12 cells. To that end, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments followed by Western blot analysis. Anti-Sp1 or anti-c-Jun antiserum was used to immunoprecipitate proteins from nuclear extracts prepared from NGF-treated PC12 cells. The precipitated proteins were separated via SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane that was subsequently incubated with anti-Sp1 or anti-c-Jun antiserum. As shown in Fig.3, preimmune serum did not precipitate either Sp1 or c-Jun in this experiment. However, complexes containing Sp1 and c-Jun were detected by immunoprecipitations using antibodies directed toward one or the other protein (Fig. 3). It should be noted that the levels of Sp1 found in c-Jun immunoprecipitates were somewhat lower when compared with those precipitated with anti-Sp1 antibody (Fig. 3), suggesting that not all cellular Sp1 is engaged in a complex with c-Jun. The same was true with c-Jun as well (Fig. 3). These data provide compelling evidence for direct physical interactions between Sp1 and c-Jun in PC12 cells and support the idea that c-Jun may regulate the β4 promoter through its association with Sp1. Previously, we showed that Sp1 can specifically bind to a CA box in the 226-bp region of the β4 promoter (30Bigger C.B. Casanova E.A. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32842-32848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 36Bigger C.B. Melnikova I.N. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25976-25982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and that this interaction is critical for Sp-mediated transactivation of the β4 promoter (36Bigger C.B. Melnikova I.N. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25976-25982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). If c-Jun activates the β4 promoter through its association with Sp1, then the Sp1-binding site within this promoter, the CA box, should be important for the ability of c-Jun to regulate the β4 promoter. To test this hypothesis, PC12 cells were cotransfected with a wild type β4 promoter-luciferase expression construct, pX1B4FH, or with a construct in which the CA box is mutated at three nucleotide positions, pX1B4FHmut4, and with an expression construct for c-Jun, pCMV-jun. As mentioned earlier, c-Jun was able to strongly transactivate the wild type β4 promoter, pX1B4FH (Fig.2 A). However, when the β4 promoter-luciferase reporter containing mutations in the CA box, pX1B4FHmut4, was used in this experiment, c-Jun activation of the promoter was marginal (Fig.2 A). Similar results were obtained from transfections performed in SN17 cells (Fig. 2 B). Thus, the CA box appears to be critical for c-Jun-mediated transactivation of the β4 promoter. To further investigate the importance of c-Jun-Sp1 interactions for the transactivation of the β4 promoter, we performed transfection experiments using theDrosophila SL2 cell line. These cells lack endogenous Sp1 activity (43Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 44Courey A.J. Holtzman D.A. Jackson S.P. Tjian R.

Chem. 1997; 272: 24038-24045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), making them a useful system to study the functional consequences of the protein-protein interactions mentioned above. We previously reported that Sp1 can strongly transactivate the β4 promoter when transfected into SL2 cells (28Du Q. Melnikova I.N. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19877-19883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 30Bigger C.B. Casanova E.A. Gardner P.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 25976-25982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To determine whether c-Jun activates the β4 promoter through its interactions with Sp1, SL2 cells were cotransfected with a wild type β4 promoter-luciferase expression construct (pX1B4FH) and pActSp1 or pPacJun or both. To confirm that Sp1 and c-Jun expression was involved in transactivation, the reporter DNA was also transfected with the parental vectors devoid of Sp1 and c-Jun coding sequences, pAct and pPacO, alone. As expected, Sp1 was capable of transactivating the wild type β4 promoter-luciferase construct ∼20-fold (Fig. 4). Consistent with the observation that the β4 promoter fragment used in these experiments does not contain an AP-1-binding site, c-Jun by itself did not have any effect on reporter gene activity (Fig. 4). However, when Sp1 and c-Jun were cotransfected with the β4 promoter-luciferase construct, an ∼120-fold increase in reporter gene activity was observed, indicating a synergistic effect of the two regulatory factors (Fig. 4). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that c-Jun activates the β4 promoter through direct interactions with Sp1. To investigate the importance of the Sp1-binding site for the ability of Sp1 and c-Jun to synergistically activate the β4 promoter, similar transfection experiments were performed using a β4 promoter-luciferase construct in which the CA box is mutated at three nucleotide positions (pX1B4FHmut4). Mutation in this site reduces the ability of Sp1 to transactivate the β4 promoter in SL2 cells (Fig. 4) (36Bigger C.B. Melnikova I.N. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25976-25982Abstr"

Although the role of Vav1 during lymphocyte development and activation is well characterized, the function of Vav2 is still unclear. In this study, we compared the signaling pathways regulated by Vav1 and Vav2 following engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR). We show that Vav2 is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon TCR stimulation and by co-expressed Src and Syk family kinases. Using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins, we observed that the Src homology 2 domain of Vav2 binds tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins from TCR-stimulated Jurkat T cell lysates, including c-Cbl and SLP-76. Like Vav1, Vav2 cooperated with TCR stimulation to increase extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation and to promote c-fos serum response element transcriptional activity. Moreover, both proteins displayed a similar action in increasing the expression of the early activation marker CD69 in Jurkat T cells. However, in contrast to Vav1, Vav2 dramatically suppressed TCR signals leading to nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT)-dependent transcription and induction of the interleukin-2 promoter. Vav2 appears to act upstream of the phosphatase calcineurin because a constitutively active form of calcineurin rescued the effect of Vav2 by restoring TCR-induced NF-AT activation. Interestingly, the Dbl homology and Src homology 2 domains of Vav2 were necessary for its inhibitory effect on NF-AT activation and for induction of serum response element transcriptional activity. Taken together, our results indicate that Vav1 and Vav2 exert overlapping but nonidentical functions in T cells.

Upon stimulation by extracellular signals, these proteins cycle from an inactive, GDP-bound form to an active, GTP-bound enzyme that translocates to the membrane and interacts with downstream effector proteins. These proteins, in turn, regulate adhesion, motility, and gene transcription in lymphocytes and other cell types (6Nobes C.D. Hall A.

In lymphocytes, the activation-dependent exchange of GDP for GTP is regulated by the guanosine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Vav1. Vav1 contains several functional domains, including a Dbl homology (DH) domain, a Pleckstrin homology domain, a cysteine-rich domain, one Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, and two Src homology 3 (SH3) domains (8Collins T.

Vav1 expression is mostly restricted to hematopoietic cells, and different studies have shown that it is a critical link between TCR-coupled PTKs of the Src and Syk families and the signaling pathways regulated by Rho/Rac proteins (7Altman A.

Recent studies have identified other members of the Vav family, Vav2 and Vav3, which display a much broader tissue expression (9Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Vav2 transcripts are nearly ubiquitously expressed in mouse, from embryonic to adult stage (22Schuebel K.E. Bustelo X.R. Nielsen D.A. Song B.J. Barbacid M. Goldman D. Lee I.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 363-371PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymatic activities of all three isoforms are subjected to a phosphorylation-dependent regulation (9Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav proteins can be induced through the stimulation of different receptors, including immune recognition receptors, cytokine receptors, integrins, and PTK receptors such as the epidermal growth factor and the platelet-derived growth factor receptors (23Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7870-7885Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 24Pandey A. Podtelejnikov A.V. Blagoev B. Bustelo X.R. Mann M. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Fredericks J. Breit T. Fujikawa K. Alt F.W. Brugge J.S. Swat W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6364-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that each member of the Vav family can induce cytoskeletal reorganization and transform rodent fibroblasts, their catalytic specificity toward Rho/Rac proteins appears to differ. Whereas Vav1 displays GEF activity for Rac1, Cdc42, RhoA, and RhoG, Vav2 was shown to exhibit GEF activity for RhoA, RhoB, and RhoG but not for Rac1 or Cdc42 (27Schuebel K.E. Movilla N. Rosa J.L. Bustelo X.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6608-6621Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In this regard, the morphological phenotypes induced by Vav1 and Vav2 expression in fibroblasts are distinct (27Schuebel K.E. Movilla N. Rosa J.L. Bustelo X.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6608-6621Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). However, these findings were not confirmed in another study (28Abe K. Rossman K.L. Liu B. Ritola K.D. Chiang D. Campbell S.L. Burridge K. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10141-10149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Together these studies suggest that the Vav family might use overlapping but nonidentical signal transduction pathways. Although the physiological role of Vav1 during lymphocyte development and activation is well established, the function of Vav2 is poorly documented. In particular, it is not known whether Vav1 and Vav2 elicit similar responses in lymphocytes. Here, we compared the involvement of Vav1 and Vav2 in TCR signaling. We show that Vav2 shares with Vav1 several biological features, including tyrosine phosphorylation by TCR-associated PTKs of the Src and Syk families, binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated c-Cbl and SLP-76, and a positive effect on activation of ERKs, c-fos serum response element (SRE), and CD69 expression. However, in contrast to Vav1, Vav2 negatively regulates TCR-induced NF-AT and IL-2 gene activation. We also demonstrate that Vav2 functions upstream of calcineurin (Cn) and that the intact DH and SH2 domains of Vav2 are required for activation of c-fos SRE and inhibition of NF-AT induction. Therefore, Vav1 and Vav2, two closely related members of the Vav family, are functionally distinct in promoting gene activation in T cells. The anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) OKT3 was purified from the corresponding hybridoma supernatant by protein A-Sepharose chromatography. The anti-phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) and the anti-Myc mAbs were derived from the 4G10 and 9E10 hybridomas, respectively. The anti-hemagglutinin mAb (12CA5) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The anti-SLP-76 mAb was provided by P. Findell (Palo Alto, CA). The anti-human Vav2 mAb was a kind gift from J. Downward (London, UK).

Immunity. 1996; 5: 591-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) was cloned into the pCDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). The cDNA encoding Vav2 (amino acids 1–868) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from a cDNA library of mouse liver and cloned into pCDNA3-Myc vector (Invitrogen) or pACT2 vector (CLONTECH) yielding Vav2-Myc and GAD-Vav2, respectively. PCRs were performed using the thermostable Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Myc-ERK2 has been described elsewhere (19Villalba M. Hernandez J. Deckert M. Tanaka Y. Altman A. Eur. J.

Janknecht (Rochester, MN) and has been described (30Janknecht R. Ernst W.H. Pingoud V. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5097-5104Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Mammalian expression vectors encoding Syk, Lck, Fyn, and ZAP-70 have been previously described (31Williams S. Couture C. Gilman J. Jascur T. Deckert M. Altman A. Mustelin T. Eur. J.

A bacterial expression plasmid of a GST fusion protein containing the SH3-SH2-SH3 domains of Vav2 was generated by PCR amplification of nucleotides 1797–2604 (encoding amino acid residues 599–868) from the pCDNA3-Vav2-Myc vector, followed by in-frame insertion into the pGEX-3X plasmid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Mutants were created with the Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and mutations were verified by DNA sequence analysis. Sets of primers were designed for specific PCR amplification of human Vav1 or Vav2 fragments. These primers were used to screen a panel of cDNAs generated using poly(A)+ RNA from different human tissues (CLONTECH). PCRs were performed with Superscript DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.), and GAPDH amplification was used as an internal control. Products were analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed using UV light. Cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mmsodium pyruvate, 10 mm HEPES, 1× minimum Eagle's medium nonessential amino acids solution (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 100 units/ml each of penicillin G and streptomycin. Simian virus 40 T antigen-transfected human leukemic Jurkat T cells (Jurkat-TAg) were kindly provided by G. Crabtree (Stanford, CA). Jurkat (clone JE6.1) and Jurkat-TAg cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids by electroporation as described previously (16Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Couture C. Mustelin T. Altman A. Immunity. 1996; 5: 591-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Growth and transformation of the yeast strain L40 and the β-galactosidase filter assay were performed as previously described (16Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Couture C. Mustelin T. Altman A. Immunity. 1996; 5: 591-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Cells were stimulated for 5 min with 5 μg/ml of anti-CD3 mAb, washed twice, and lysed at 1 × 108 cells/ml in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40 in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 15 min. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C, and protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce). Cleared lysates were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with the indicated antibodies and protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma). Pellets were then washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40 and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Eluted immunoprecipitates or whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by immunoblotting. Reactive proteins were visualized by ECL. GST fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 bacterial cells and produced as described (33Sawka-Verhelle D. Baron V. Mothe I. Filloux C. White M.F. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16414-16420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Jurkat cells (1 × 108 cells) were lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer for 20 min. After centrifugation, lysates were incubated with 5 μg of the indicated fusion proteins for 3 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h. Bound proteins were washed four times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by immunoblotting. For luciferase assays, transfected Jurkat cells were left unstimulated or stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb for the indicated times, as described in the legend to each figure. Cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, and lysed in 100 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was assayed by luminometry (Lumat, EG&G Berthold) using the Promegaluciferase assay system. Normalization of transfection efficiency was done using a co-transfected β-galactosidase expression vector. Luciferase activity was determined in triplicate and expressed as fold increase relative to the basal activity seen in unstimulated mock-transfected cells. For ERK2 phosphorylation assays, cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 in place of Nonidet P-40. After centrifugation, the supernatants were incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies to Myc and protein G-Sepharose beads. Immunoprecipitates were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose, and the membranes were probed with antibodies to phospho-ERK according to the manufacturer's instructions. After stripping, the membranes were reprobed with antibodies to Myc to confirm equal levels of ERK2 in the immunoprecipitates. Jurkat-TAg cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids together with the pEGFP-N1 reporter plasmid (CLONTECH) and cultured for 24 h at 37 °C. Cells were incubated with medium alone or with PMA (50 ng/ml) for the final 18 h of culture and stained with a phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-human CD69 mAb as described (19Villalba M. Hernandez J. Deckert M. Tanaka Y. Altman A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 1587-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). CD69 expression was analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan, Becton Dickinson) after gating on GFP-positive cells. To address the role of Vav2 in the immune system, we first examined its expression pattern by reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis on various immune tissues. As shown in Fig.1 A, the Vav2 message was predominantly expressed in spleen, fetal liver, tonsil, and peripheral blood leukocytes and to a lesser extend in thymus and bone marrow. As previously reported, Vav1 message was detected in all the immune tissues tested. We also examined the expression of Vav2 at the protein level in different hematopoietic cell lines. Vav2 was well expressed in several human T (Jurkat, CEM, HPBall) or B (88.66, Raji, SKW6.4) cell lines but poorly expressed in the monocytic cell line U937 (Fig.1 B). The distinct expression pattern of Vav1 and Vav2 might account for distinct functions of the two proteins in different cell types. Jurkat T cells are a widely used model for studying TCR signaling. Therefore, we examined whether Vav2 undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation following TCR stimulation. Jurkat E6.1 T cells were stimulated with an anti-CD3 mAb, and after immunoprecipitation with Vav2-specific antibodies, the level of tyrosine phosphorylation was assayed by immunoblotting with antibodies to Tyr(P). Increased Vav2 tyrosine phosphorylation was detectable after 30 s of stimulation, with peak levels detected 2–5 min following TCR ligation (Fig.2 A, lanes 1–5). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav2 was also observed in pervanadate-treated Jurkat E6.1 T cells (Fig. 2 A, lane 6). We then compared the abilities of Vav1 and Vav2 to become tyrosine-phosphorylated upon TCR stimulation. To do this, Jurkat-TAg cells were transfected with the Myc-tagged forms of Vav1 or Vav2 and stimulated with an anti-CD3 mAb. The level of tyrosine phosphorylation was assayed by immunoblotting cell lysates and anti-Myc immunoprecipitates with an anti-Tyr(P) mAb. Similar expression levels of the transfected proteins were determined by immunoblotting with an anti-Myc mAb (Fig. 2 B). Both Vav1 and Vav2 were found tyrosine-phosphorylated upon TCR stimulation (Fig. 2 B,upper panel, lanes 4 and 6). Of note, basal tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav1 and Vav2 could be detected in resting cells after prolonged exposure of the membrane (Fig.2 B, upper panel, lanes 3 and5, and data not shown). To identify candidate PTKs involved in the TCR-mediated phosphorylation of Vav2, we co-transfected Jurkat-TAg cells with Vav2 and Lck, Fyn, Syk, or Zap-70. As shown in Fig. 2 C, Vav2 was prominently phosphorylated in intact T cells by Lck, Fyn, and Syk and to a lesser extent by Zap-70. These results indicate that, like Vav1, Vav2 is tyrosine-phosphorylated by T cell nonreceptor PTKs. Next, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to further examine the physical interaction of Vav2 with Syk and Fyn. The interactions in co-transformed L40 yeast cells were monitored by a β-galactosidase filter assay (16Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Couture C. Mustelin T. Altman A. Immunity. 1996; 5: 591-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). GAD-Vav2 and GAD-Vav1 similarly interacted with LexA-Syk and LexA-Fyn (Fig. 2 D). As expected, a construct containing the C-terminal SH3-SH2-SH3 domain of Vav2 (Vav2 599–868) still interacted with Syk. The SH2 domain of Vav2 was required because an SH2-inactivating point mutation (R688Q) abolished the interaction between Vav2 and Syk (Fig. 2 D). As a negative control, no interactions between GAD-Vav2 constructs and a LexA DNA-binding domain fused to lamin were detected. Finally, we assessed the nature of proteins interacting with the SH2 domain of Vav2 in lymphocytes. Two GST-Vav2 fusion proteins were generated (Fig. 3 A) and used in GST pull-down assays. When GST-Vav2 599–868 was incubated with lysates of resting Jurkat cells, it associated with two major tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of 120 and 62 kDa, respectively (Fig.3 B, lane 2). TCR stimulation did not significantly increase the association of these two proteins with Vav2, but it induced an additional interaction with a 75-kDa Tyr(P)-containing protein (Fig. 3 B, lane 2 versus lane 5). In contrast, none of these proteins bound the SH2-mutated GST-Vav2 protein or the GST alone (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1, 3, 4, and 6). Probing the membranes with a panel of antibodies to different candidate proteins allowed us to identified pp120 and pp75 as c-Cbl and SLP-76, respectively (Fig. 3 B, two lower panels,lane 5). Together, these results suggest that Vav2 may play an important role as a component of the signaling complex assembled during TCR-mediated cell activation. Vav1 plays an important role in the immune system as an inducer of gene transcription (8Collins T. Deckert M. Altman A. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 221-225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 9Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), and a recent report indicated that Vav2 might play a similar role (26Moores S.L. Selfors L.M. Fredericks J. Breit T. Fujikawa K. Alt F.W. Brugge J.S. Swat W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6364-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wished to compare the impact of Vav1 and Vav2 overexpression on several TCR-mediated downstream activation events, beginning with ERK activation. First, we examined the activation of endogenous ERK proteins by Vav2 in Jurkat E6.1 cells. Cells were transfected with the Myc-tagged form of Vav2 or empty vector and stimulated with an anti-CD3 mAb for different times. Activation of endogenous ERK1 and 2 was monitored by immunoblotting with a phospho-ERK-specific antibody. As shown in Fig. 4 A, expression of Vav2 resulted in a significant increase of the activation of ERK1/2 following TCR stimulation (compare lanes 2–4 withlanes 6–8). Next, we compared the ability of Vav1 and Vav2 to promote ERK2 activation. Jurkat-TAg cells were co-transfected with a Myc-tagged ERK2 reporter, plus Vav1-Myc or Vav2-Myc. The transfected cells were left unstimulated or stimulated with an anti-CD3 antibody. Expression of MEK1 was used as a positive control for ERK2 activation. Activation of ERK2 was monitored by immunoblotting with a phospho-ERK-specific antibody. As shown in Fig. 4 B, expression of Vav1 and Vav2 induced no significant activation of ERK2 in unstimulated T cells (lanes 3 and 5). However, either Vav1 or Vav2 further increased ERK2 activation following TCR stimulation (lanes 4 and 6). Next, we examined whether Vav2 overexpression results in stimulation of c-fos SRE transcriptional activity. We transfected Jurkat-TAg cells with Myc-tagged Vav1 or Vav2 along with a luciferase reporter driven by SRE-binding sequences. Similarly both Vav1 and Vav2 induced a marked increase of either the basal or TCR-stimulated activities of SRE reporter plasmid (4- and 8-fold increase over basal activity, respectively) (Fig.5 A). As a control, PMA plus ionomycin stimulation caused maximal SRE activation, which was not affected by Vav1 or Vav2 expression (Fig. 5 A). Proper expression of the transfected Vav proteins was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 5 A, inset). Recently, we reported that Vav1 plays a role in the induction of the early activation marker CD69 (19Villalba M. Hernandez J. Deckert M. Tanaka Y. Altman A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 1587-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 20Villalba M. Coudronniere N. Deckert M. Teixeiro E. Mas P. Altman A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 151-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the possibility that Vav2 could mediate a similar function in T cells. Jurkat-TAg cells were transfected with Myc-tagged Vav1 or Vav2 together with a pEF-GFP reporter plasmid and stimulated or not with PMA. CD69 expression of GFP-gated cells was then determined by FACScan analysis. Interestingly, Vav2 overexpression led to a 4-fold increase of CD69 expression in the absence of stimulation (Fig. 5 B). This effect was similar to the one induced by Vav1. Moreover, Vav2, like Vav1, further increased PMA stimulation to induce the surface expression of CD69 (Fig. 5 B). Taken together, our results indicate that Vav2 shares with Vav1 the ability to activate pathways that stimulate ERK"

One DNA repair gene that is frequently hypermethylated in tumors is methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT)1 (4Yarosh D.B. Foote R.S. Mitra S. Day R.S. Carcinogenesis. 1983; 4: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 5Chen J.M. Zhang Y.P. Wang C. Sun Y. Fujimoto J. Ikenaga M. Carcinogenesis. 1992; 13: 1503-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). MGMT removes alkyl adducts from O 6-guanine residues by transferring the alkyl group to an active cysteine residue within its sequence in a reaction that inactivates further enzymatic activity (6Pegg A.E. Dolan M.E. Moschel R.C. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 51: 167-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Since O 6-alkylated guanine can mispair with thymine during replication to cause transversions as well as cross-link with cytosines on the opposite DNA strand (6Pegg A.E. Dolan M.E. Moschel R.C. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 51: 167-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), cells that are deficient in MGMT activity may be more susceptible to mutation and, hence, cancer development or progression. Supporting this role in cancer development, transgenic animals overexpressing MGMT are resistant to tumor formation induced by alkylating agents (7Becker K. Dosch J. Gregel C.M. Martin B.A. Kaina B. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3244-3249PubMed Google Scholar), whereas MGMT null animals exhibit an increased frequency of methylnitrosourea-induced tumors (8Sakumi K. Shiraishi A. Shimizu S. Tsuzuki T. Ishikawa T. Sekiguchi M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2415-2418PubMed Google Scholar). TGFβ1 is a member of a large family of multifunctional secreted polypeptides that are potent growth inhibitors of epithelial cells (9Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M.

In the mouse epidermal carcinogenesis model, TGFβ1 acts as a tumor suppressor since progression of chemically induced benign tumors is associated with loss of TGFβ1 (17Glick A.B. Kulkarni A.B. Tennenbaum T. Hennings H. Flanders K.C. O'Reilly M. Sporn M.B. Karlsson S. Yuspa S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6076-6080Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 18Cui W. Kemp C.J. Duffie E. Balmain A. Akhurst R.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5831-5836PubMed Google Scholar), and genetic inactivation of the signaling pathway in keratinocytes leads to rapid progression to squamous cell carcinoma (19Glick A.B. Lee M.M.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism by which loss of autocrine TGFβ signaling leads to accelerated tumor progression, we established a series of nonneoplastic, spontaneously immortal cell lines derived from newborn mouse TGFβ1+/− and −/− keratinocytes. The TGFβ1−/− cell lines had a significantly higher level of gene amplification than controls (21Glick A.B. Weinberg W.C. Wu I.H. Quan W. Yuspa S.H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3645-3650PubMed Google Scholar). To explore further the role of TGFβ1 in genomic stability, we have examined the response of TGFβ1+/− and TGFβ1−/− cell lines to different DNA-damaging agents. Our results show that the TGFβ1−/− cell lines are specifically more sensitive to cell killing by alkylating agents, and this is due to a lack of expression of MGMT mRNA and enzyme. Southern blot, MSP, and bisulfite sequencing of the MGMT promoter indicates that the lack of expression is due to hypermethylation of CpG islands in the MGMT promoter. This is the first demonstration of a link between TGFβ1 expression and aberrant promoter methylation, and it could have important implications for mechanisms of tumor progression caused by inactivation of TGFβ signaling. The TGFβ1+/− and TGFβ1−/− cell lines are spontaneously immortal, clonally derived non-tumorigenic keratinocyte cell lines isolated from primary epidermal cultures of newborn mice from the TGFβ1−/− strain (19Glick A.B.

Cells were routinely cultured in Earle's minimum essential medium, 8% chelexed fetal calf serum, 0.05 mm CaCl2, and antibiotics. Unless indicated, all cell lines were used between passage 20–35. Balb/c keratinocytes were isolated from newborn Balb/c mice using standard techniques (23Dlugosz A.A. Glick A.B. Tennenbaum T. Weinberg W.C. Yuspa S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and cultured for 3–5 days before isolation of DNA. For 5-azacytidine treatment, cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/175-cm2 tissue culture flask, and exponentially growing cells were treated with 1 μm 5-azacytidine (Sigma) for 48 h. After a 3-day recovery period, the treatment protocol was repeated, after which DNA and RNA were isolated. To isolate subclones of the KO3 passage 8 line, cells were seeded at low density in 150-cm2 tissue culture dishes, and colonies that grew out were ring-cloned, expanded to a T-75 flask, and DNA-isolated. To generate continuous lines, primary TGFβ1−/− keratinocytes were cultured in medium containing 10 ng/ml keratinocyte growth factor for several weeks until immortal colonies grew out. These colonies were pooled and passaged twice before seeding at low density and ring-cloning. The TGFβ1 wild type keratinocyte cell line, NHK4, was clonally derived from newborn keratinocyte cultures isolated from p53 −/− mice (24Azzoli C.G. Sagar M. Wu A. Lowry D. Hennings H. Morgan D.L. Weinberg W.C. Mol. Carcinog. 1998; 21: 50-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The B8 and M3 TGFβ1 wild type cell lines were derived from newborn epidermis from control mice of the c-fos −/− line (25Saez E. Rutberg S.E. Mueller E. Oppenheim H. Smoluk J. Yuspa S.H. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1995; 82: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Approximately 500 cells of each cell line were seeded into 60-cm2 culture dishes and allowed to attach for 24 h. Cells were treated with serial dilutions of the different drugs for 1 h in complete medium, then placed in fresh medium without drug and allowed to proliferate for 7–14 days. For γ and UV irradiation, the medium was removed, and irradiation done in a small volume of phosphate-buffered saline. Gamma irradiation was done with a MarkIV cesium source, and UV irradiation was done with a Stratalinker (Stratagene) set to deliver a preset joule/mm2. After irradiation, the medium was replaced. Colonies were stained with 0.5% crystal violet, 10% formaldehyde and counted with a dissecting microscope. Only colonies greater than 50 cells were counted. Each treatment was performed in triplicate, and the percent of colonies relative to the untreated cells was determined. For each cell line and treatment, the concentration producing 50% inhibition of colony formation was determined from the dose-response curve. MGMT activity in crude cellular extracts was determined by measuring the transfer of3H from [3H]methylated Micrococcus luteus DNA to an acid-insoluble protein fraction (26Margison G.P. Butler J. Hoey B. Carcinogenesis. 1985; 6: 1699-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, cellular extracts were prepared by sonication of cell pellets in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 100 mmKCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol. 50–200 μg of protein was incubated with the 3H substrate prepared from purified M. luteus DNA as described (27Demple B. Karran P. Lindahl T. Jacobsson A. Olsson M. Friedberg E.C. Hanawalt P.C. DNA Repair: A Laboratory Manual of Research Procedures. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1983: 41-52Google Scholar) at 37 °C for 30 min and then precipitated with 1 mperchloric acid. Precipitated protein and DNA was then heated to 70 °C for 1 h to hydrolyze precipitated DNA, and after washing, the amount of 3H remaining in the insoluble fraction was determined by liquid scintillation counting (26Margison G.P. Butler J. Hoey B. Carcinogenesis. 1985; 6: 1699-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The reaction was linear between 25 and 500 μg of cellular extract. mRNA was prepared from cell lines using the FastTrack mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen). 2 μg of poly(A) RNA was electrophoresed through a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to Nytran filters (Schleicher & Schuel). Northern filters were hybridized to [32P]dCTP-labeled DNA probes in 50% formamide at 42 °C. The methylpurine glycosylase cDNA was obtained from ATCC. The human MGMT cDNA was isolated from pKT100 (28Tano K. Shiota S. Collier J. Foote R.S. Mitra S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 686-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was isolated from cultured cells according to standard methods (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 280Google Scholar), and 40 μg was restricted with either MspI or HpaII, electrophoresed through a 2% agarose gel, and transferred to Nytran filters. The filters were hybridized to a 1.9-kilobase pair PCR fragment of the mouse MGMT promoter. Primers used for amplification were obtained from the published sequence (30Iwakuma T. Shiraishi N. Fukuhara M. Kawate H. Sekiguchi M. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 863-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), 5′-GGATCCCAGTTCTAATTGGGCCTT, downstream 5′-CACCAAGATCTGGCACTGAGAAAT. CpG methylation patterns in the mouse MGMT promoter were identified using sodium bisulfite modification, which converts unmethylated cytosines to uracil, and subsequent PCR amplification using primers specific for either the unmethylated or methylated modified DNA (31Herman J.G. Graff J.R. Myohanen S. Nelkin B.D. Baylin S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9821-9826Crossref PubMed Scopus (5212) Google Scholar). 1 μg of genomic DNA was modified with sodium bisulfite and purified (31Herman J.G. Graff J.R. Myohanen S. Nelkin B.D. Baylin S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9821-9826Crossref PubMed Scopus (5212) Google Scholar). For the mouse MGMT promoter, the following primer pairs were identified using the CpGware program (Intergen) and used to specifically amplify unmodified DNA, 5′-CTCCCAGAGCCACGCCCCGCGT, downstream 5′-GTGCACGGGGTGGGGGCGGGG; modified unmethylated DNA, TTTGGTAGTTTTTAGAGTTATGTTTTGTGT, downstream 5′-CCACAAACACATACACAAAATAAAAACAAAA; modified methylated DNA, 5′-GGTAGTTTTTAGAGTTACGTTTCGCGT, downstream 5′-CAAACGCGTACACGAAATAAAAACGAAA. PCR reactions were carried out in a 20-μl volume using 100 ng of modified DNA, 1× PCR buffer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) 0.2 units of Amplitaq Gold (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) under the following amplification conditions: 94 °C for 90 s, 60 °C for 90 s; 72 °C for 2 min for 35 cycles. With these conditions, no amplification was observed with the wild type primers on modified DNA or with unmethylated/methylated primers on unmodified DNA. Controls without DNA were performed with each set of PCR. PCR products were electrophoresed through a 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide fluorescence. Genomic DNA was treated with bisulfite as above, and a 560-base pair fragment between 1401 and 1960 of the published mouse MGMT promoter sequence (30Iwakuma T. Shiraishi N. Fukuhara M. Kawate H. Sekiguchi M. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 863-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) was amplified using primers that are independent of methylation state and recognize bisulfite-modified DNA. The PCR primers were 5′-TTTAGTTGGGTAGTGATTGGATTTTTAGTG and 5′-CCCCAAAACTCACCAACTTACAAACTACAA. The PCR fragment was cloned into pCR2.1 using the TA-cloning method (Invitrogen), and selected clones were sequenced with M13 primers using the dye terminator DNA-sequencing kit (PE Applied Biosystems) with a PerkinElmer ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer. TGFβ1+/− and −/− keratinocyte cell lines were treated with different DNA-damaging agents, and the ability of the treated cells to form viable colonies was used as a measure of relative DNA repair capacity. Fig. 1 shows that for UV and γ irradiation or cisplatin there was no consistent difference in the IC50 for inhibition of colony formation between the TGFβ1−/− and TGFβ1+/− genotypes. Similar dose-response curves were obtained with the topoisomerase inhibitors camptothecin or etoposide (data not shown). However, the TGFβ1−/− cell lines were 5-fold more sensitive to cell killing by the alkylating agent MNNG than the TGFβ1+/− lines. Similar results were obtained with methylnitrosourea (data not shown). TGFβ1+/+ cell lines derived independently from other transgenic lines (B8, M3, NHK4) had sensitivities to MNNG that were similar to the TGFβ1+/− cell lines. Since the NHK4 cell line is p53−/− (24Azzoli C.G. Sagar M. Wu A. Lowry D. Hennings H. Morgan D.L. Weinberg W.C. Mol. Carcinog. 1998; 21: 50-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the increased sensitivity to alkylating damage is specific to the TGFβ1−/− genotype. MNNG and methylnitrosourea produce a high proportion ofO 6-methylguanine adducts that are specifically repaired by the enzyme O 6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) (6Pegg A.E. Dolan M.E. Moschel R.C. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 51: 167-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Cells that lack this enzyme exhibit increased sensitivity to cell killing by alkylating agents (4Yarosh D.B. Foote R.S. Mitra S. Day R.S. Carcinogenesis. 1983; 4: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The level of MGMT enzyme activity in the TGFβ1+/− and TGFβ1−/− keratinocyte cell lines was determined using a well characterized assay that measures the ability of crude cellular extracts to transfer a [3H]methyl group from M. luteus DNA to protein (26Margison G.P. Butler J. Hoey B. Carcinogenesis. 1985; 6: 1699-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Table I shows that all TGFβ1+/cell lines had levels of MGMT activity ranging from 0.102–0.255 pmol/mg of protein. Treatment of these cells withO 6-benzylguanine, a specific inhibitor of MGMT, eliminated enzyme activity. In contrast, 4/5 TGFβ1−/− keratinocyte cell lines had no detectable MGMT activity, whereas in KO6 the levels were 0.005 pmol/mg of protein, barely above the background. Northern blot analysis showed that the lack of MGMT enzyme in the TGFβ1−/− cell lines was due to the absence of the MGMT transcript (Fig. 2). There was no difference between the two genotypes in expression of another repair enzyme, methylpurine glycosylase, which removes N-methylpurines and other damaged purines in DNA (33Saffhill R. Margison G.P. O'Connor P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 823: 111-145PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.2). No difference in hybridization pattern was seen when restriction-digested genomic DNA from the TGFβ1+/− and TGFβ1−/− cell lines was hybridized to a MGMT cDNA probe (data not shown). These results indicate that the lack of MGMT expression in the TGFβ1−/− cell lines was not due to deletion or rearrangement of the MGMT gene.Table IAbsence of MGMT enzyme activity in TGFβ1 −/− keratinocyte cell linesGenotypeCell lineMGMT activityTGFβ1 −/−KO1Not detectableKO3Not detectableKO4Not detectableKO5Not detectableKO60.005 ± 0.001TGFβ1 +/−H10.255 ± 0.012H40.217 ± 0.014H50.102 ± 0.011H1 + BZG0.012H4 + BZG0.007MGMT enzyme activity (pmol of 3H removed/mg of protein) was measured in crude cellular extracts of the TGFβ1 −/− and +/− keratinocyte cell lines as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values represent the average of 2–3 independent determinations.

Open table in a new tab MGMT enzyme activity (pmol of 3H removed/mg of protein) was measured in crude cellular extracts of the TGFβ1 −/− and +/− keratinocyte cell lines as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values represent the average of 2–3 independent determinations. MGMT activity was inhibited byO 6-benzylguanine (BZG), indicating specificity of the enzyme activity measured for MGMT. A frequent mechanism for inactivation of MGMT expression in human tumors and tumor cell lines is hypermethylation of CpG islands in the gene promoter (3Esteller M. Hamilton S.R. Burger P.C. Baylin S.B. Herman J.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 793-797PubMed Google Scholar, 34Qian X.C. Brent T.P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3672-3677PubMed Google Scholar). Initial Southern blot analysis of methylation in the MGMT promoter using the methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme pair MspI andHpaII revealed specific methylation of the −328HpaII site in two TGFβ1−/− cell lines (not shown). To assay the methylation status of the MGMT promoter in all cell lines, we developed a methylation-specific PCR assay for the mouse MGMT promoter (31Herman J.G. Graff J.R. Myohanen S. Nelkin B.D. Baylin S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9821-9826Crossref PubMed Scopus (5212) Google Scholar). Treatment of DNA with bisulfate converts unmethylated cytosines to uracil, whereas methylated cytosines are resistant to this chemical modification (31Herman J.G. Graff J.R. Myohanen S. Nelkin B.D. Baylin S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9821-9826Crossref PubMed Scopus (5212) Google Scholar). Specific primers were generated to distinguish methylated (M) from unmethylated (U) DNA in the mouse MGMT promoter based on sequence alterations following bisulfite modification. Fig. 3 shows that in all of the TGFβ1+/− lines as well as Balb/c keratinocytes, a PCR product was obtained after bisulfite modification only with the unmethylated PCR primers and not with the methylated primers. Thus some or all of the CpG sites within these primer sequences are unmethylated in the control cells. In contrast, the methylated primer pair yielded a strong PCR product with bisulfite-modified DNA from all of the TGFβ1−/− lines, whereas variable levels of PCR product was generated with the unmethylated primer pair. To examine the extent of methylation in the MGMT promoter, DNA from the KO3 and H1 cell lines at passage 35 was subjected to bisulfite modification followed by sequencing of PCR products amplified with non-methylation-specific primers. Of 28 CpG dinucleotides between −475 and the start of transcription, virtually all were unmethylated in different PCR clones from the H1 cell line. In contrast, between 57 and 82% of the CpG dinucleotides were methylated in different PCR products sequenced from the KO3 cell line (Fig. 4). Apart from a region just upstream from −25, which was free of methylation in all clones, virtually the entire promoter was methylated.Figure 4Bisulfite sequencing reveals extensive methylation of the MGMT promoter in KO3 cells but not H1 cells.Bisulfite-modified genomic DNA was sequenced as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lollipops represent individual CpG sites within the MGMT promoter. The methylation status of each site for individual PCR clones sequenced is indicated by an open box(unmethylated) or closed box (methylated). Four subcloned PCR products were sequenced for the H1 line, and seven were sequenced for the KO3 line. The arrow indicates the start site of transcription.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further strengthen the link between methylation of the MGMT promoter and lack of mRNA expression in the TGFβ1−/− lines, these cells were treated with 5-azacytidine to block methylation. Fig. 5 A shows that after treatment of the TGFβ1−/− cell lines with 5-azacytidine MGMT mRNA was reexpressed (Fig. 5 A). This correlated with demethylation of the MGMT promoter as measured by an increase in the unmethylated- relative to the methylated-specific PCR product after bisulfite modification and MSP in KO1 KO3 and KO6 DNA (Fig.5 B). To examine the correlation between the lack of autocrine TGFβ1 expression and aberrant methylation of the MGMT promoter, we analyzed the MGMT methylation status in the unstable TGFβ1+/− cell line H7. Previous studies show that the TGFβ1 wild type allele in this cell line is lost with increasing passage (21Glick A.B. Weinberg W.C. Wu I.H. Quan W. Yuspa S.H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3645-3650PubMed Google Scholar). Methylation-specific PCR analysis of the MGMT promoter in H7 showed that at passage 9 a PCR product was generated only with the unmethylated primer pair, but by passage 12, a methylated band is evident, and this increases relative to the unmethylated band by passage 24 (Fig. 6). These results suggest that there is a close association between autocrine TGFβ1 expression and hypermethylation of the MGMT promoter. However, short or long term treatment of cells with TGFβ1 did not alter MGMT expression. Table II shows that treatment of Balb/c primary keratinocytes with 0.5 ng/ml TGFβ1 for 48 h did not alter MGMT enzyme activity, nor did a similar treatment induce expression of MGMT in the KO1 and KO3 cell lines. Additionally, treatment of the KO3 cells with exogenous TGFβ1 at 50 pg/ml for up to 1 month did not reduce methylation of the MGMT promoter. These results suggest that the effect of a TGFβ1 null genotype on methylation of the MGMT promoter is indirect or that once established, the methylation pattern cannot be reversed by addition of TGFβ1. To test whether hypermethylation is an inherent property of the TGFβ1 null cells, we examined MGMT promoter methylation by MSP in primary keratinocytes of all genotypes as well as TGFβ1−/− cells at different times of culture. Table II and Fig. 7 Ashow that regardless of TGFβ1 genotype, all primary keratinocytes express similar levels of MGMT enzyme and have an unmethylated MGMT promoter. However, with continued passage of the null cells in culture, a faint band was reproducibly detected with the methylated PCR primers in passage 8 TGFβ1−/− cells, and this increased in proportion such that by passage 35 the predominant band was with the methylated-specific primers. These results suggest that the methylation state of the MGMT promoter is unstable in the KO keratinocytes. To test this more directly, we subcloned the null keratinocytes at passage 2 and 8 and examined methylation status of these clones by MSP. Fig. 7,B and C, shows that in subclones from both, there is considerable variability in the methylation state of the MGMT promoter. DNA from some clones was completely methylated (clones 1, 3, 4, 6, 8), whereas in others it was unmethylated (clones 2, 9, 10), and the remainder had amplification with both unmethylated- and methylated-specific PCR primers. Thus the methylation state of the MGMT promoter in the TGFβ1−/− cells exhibits clonal- and time-dependent variability.Table IITGFβ1 does not directly regulate MGMT enzyme levelsCell typeTreatmentMGMT activityPrimary keratinocytesBalb/cNone0.218 ± 0.009TGFβ1 0.5 ng/ml0.208 ± 0.014TGFβ1 +/+None0.162 ± 0.003TGFβ1 +/−None0.223 ± 0.002TGFβ1 −/−None0.213 ± 0.002Cell lineKO1NoneNot detectedTGFβ1 1.0 ng/mlNot detectedKO3NoneNot detectedTGFβ1 1.0 ng/mlNot detectedMGMT enzyme activity (pmol of 3H removed/mg of protein) was measured in crude cellular extracts of keratinocytes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values represent the average of 2–3 independent determinations.

https://openalex.org/W1979498518,"Two phosphofructokinase genes have been described previously in Entamoeba histolytica. The product of the larger of the two genes codes for a 60-kDa protein that has been described previously as a pyrophosphate (PP(i))-dependent enzyme, and the product of the second, coding for a 48-kDa protein, has been previously reported to be a PP(i)-dependent enzyme with extremely low specific activity. Here it is found that the 48-kDa protein is not a PP(i)-dependent enzyme but a highly active ATP-requiring enzyme (k(cat) = 250 s(-)1) that binds the cosubstrate fructose 6-phosphate (Fru-6-P) with relatively low affinity. This enzyme exists in concentration- and ATP-dependent tetrameric active and dimeric inactive states. Activation is achieved in the presence of nucleoside triphosphates, ADP, and PP(i), but not by AMP, P(i), or the second substrate Fru-6-P. Activation by ATP is facilitated by conditions of molecular crowding. Divalent cations are not required, and no phosphoryl transfer occurs during activation. Kinetics of the activated enzyme show cooperativity with Fru-6-P (Fru-6-P(0.5) = 3.8 mm) and inhibition by high ATP and phosphoenolpyruvate. The enzyme is active without prior activation in extracts of E. histolytica.

https://openalex.org/W2091571601,"Two sets of studies have been reported on the electron transfer pathway of complex III in bovine heart submitochondrial particles (SMP). 1) In the presence of myxothiazol, MOA-stilbene, stigmatellin, or of antimycin added to SMP pretreated with ascorbate and KCN to reduce the high potential components (iron-sulfur protein (ISP) and cytochrome c 1) of complex III, addition of succinate reduced hemeb H followed by a slow and partial reduction of heme b L. Similar results were obtained when SMP were treated only with KCN or NaN3, reagents that inhibit cytochrome oxidase, not complex III. The average initial rate ofb H reduction under these conditions was about 25–30% of the rate of b reduction by succinate in antimycin-treated SMP, where both b H andb L were concomitantly reduced. These results have been discussed in relation to the Q-cycle hypothesis and the effect of the redox state of ISP/c 1 on cytochrome b reduction by succinate. 2) Reverse electron transfer from ISP reduced with ascorbate plus phenazine methosulfate to cytochrome b was studied in SMP, ubiquinone (Q)-depleted SMP containing ≤0.06 mol of Q/mol of complex III, and Q-replenished SMP. The results showed that Q was not required for electron transfer from ISP to b, a reaction that was inhibited by antimycin (also by myxothiazol or MOA-stilbene as reported elsewhere). It was also shown that antimycin did not inhibit electron transfer fromb (b H) to Q, in clear contrast to the assumption of the Q-cycle hypothesis regarding the site of antimycin inhibition."

Mutant proteins are incorporated into the thin filament or thick filament and eventually produce cardiomyopathy. However, it has been unclear how the several, genetically identified defects in protein structure translate into impaired protein and muscle function. We have studied the basis of FHC caused by premature truncation of the most frequently implicated thin filament target, troponin T. Electron microscope observations showed that the thin filament undergoes normal structural changes in response to Ca2+ binding. On the other hand, solution studies showed that the mutation alters and destabilizes troponin binding to the thin filament to different extents in different regulatory states, thereby affecting the transitions among states that regulate myosin binding and muscle contraction. Development of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can thus be traced to a defect in the primary mechanism controlling cardiac contraction, switching between different conformations of the thin filament.

Despite the varied functions of these many proteins, the clinical and histological manifestations of FHC define a common syndrome involving thickening of one or more parts of the left ventricular wall, myocyte disarray, fibrosis, and a variety of cardiac symptoms including sudden death (reviewed in Ref. 5Spirito P. Seidman C.E. McKenna W.J. Maron B.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 775-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Cardiomyopathic mutations have been described for thick filament proteins, as well as for every thin filament component except troponin C (TnC), i.e. for α-tropomyosin and cardiac actin and troponin I and T (TnI, TnT). TnT appears to be the most frequent thin filament target, and mutations in TnT are associated with relatively high mortality despite only modest cardiac hypertrophy (2Watkins H. McKenna W.J. Thierfelder L. Suk H.J. Anan R. O'Donoghue A. Spirito P. Matsumori A. Moravec C.S. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1058-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Experimentally, TnT mutations produce physiological dysfunction in transgenic animals and in cultured cells and altered function of purified proteins assessed in vitro (reviewed in Ref. 6Tobacman L.S.

However, the underlying mechanisms leading to these dysfunction(s) remain poorly understood. Both the thin filament and the thick filament are dynamic interacting protein assemblies. Large structural transitions in myosin produce the cross-bridge stroke that results in muscle contraction (7Houdusse A. Kalabokis V.N. Himmel D. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Cell. 1999; 97: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 8Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 687-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Similarly, changes in thin filament structure are critical for Ca2+ regulation of contraction (9Holmes K.C. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 2s-7sPubMed Google Scholar, 10Vibert P. Craig R. Lehman W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 11Squire J.M. Morris E.P. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). FHC mutations in either filament presumably act by altering filament structure or dynamics, although no direct structural examination of FHC mutants has been reported. However, critical insights into the basis of FHC have come from mapping myosin mutations onto the atomic model of the myosin head (12Rayment I. Holden H.M. Sellers J.R. Fananapazir L. Epstein N.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3864-3868Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 13Ruppel K.M. Spudich J.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 543-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Similarly for the thin filament, mutations can be mapped on to the atomic structures of the components where these are available. However, a full understanding of thin filament mutations has not been possible because of the lack of an atomic model of the thin filament as a whole and because no direct structural studies have been performed. Our recent elucidation of thin filament molecular structure by three-dimensional reconstruction of electron micrographs approaches such a model and has provided essential structural insights into the thin filament regulatory mechanism (14Rosol M. Lehman W. Craig R. Landis C. Butters C. Tobacman L.S. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 908-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 15Korman V.L. Hatch V. Dixon K. Craig R. Lehman W. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22470-22478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These studies show that tropomyosin adopts three distinct positions on actin depending on Ca2+ binding to troponin and myosin binding to actin (10Vibert P. Craig R. Lehman W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). In the absence of Ca2+, tropomyosin is localized on the periphery of the filament, where it sterically inhibits actin-myosin interaction, thereby causing relaxation (9Holmes K.C. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 2s-7sPubMed Google Scholar, 16Lehman W. Craig R. Vibert P. Nature. 1994; 368: 65-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Activation results from a two-step movement of tropomyosin away from the myosin binding site, the first induced by Ca2+, partially switching on the thin filament, and the second by myosin head binding leading to full activation (10Vibert P. Craig R. Lehman W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Our structural experiments have also enabled functional changes to be correlated with perturbations of regulatory transitions in thin filament structure. In this paper, we correlate the structural and functional effects of a FHC mutation in TnT to characterize the disease at the molecular level. We examine a 28-residue COOH-terminal truncation of cardiac TnT, similar to protein resulting from a FHC splice site mutation at the beginning of intron 15 (2). Heterozygotes for this mutation experience ∼25% mortality by age 25, similar to the mortality associated with other TnT mutations (2Watkins H. McKenna W.J. Thierfelder L. Suk H.J. Anan R. O'Donoghue A. Spirito P. Matsumori A. Moravec C.S. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1058-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). In transgenic animal models expressing the mutant protein, both systolic and diastolic function are compromised (17Tardiff J.C. Factor S.M. Tompkins B.D. Hewett T.E. Palmer B.M. Moore R.L. Schwartz S. Robbins J. Leinwand L.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2800-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Moreover, in a variety of in vitro experimental systems, thin filaments containing this mutation exhibit impaired regulation of actin-myosin interactions reflected in reduced inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity in the absence of Ca2+, diminished activation of myosin cycling in the presence of Ca2+ (6Tobacman L.S.

Despite the obviously altered control mechanisms, the present report shows that tropomyosin adopts normal positions on the actin filament, both in the presence and in the absence of Ca2+. The origin of the thin filament functional abnormalities is instead shown to be due to weakened binding of troponin to the thin filament to different extents in the three regulatory states, thereby affecting the transitions among these states that control myosin binding and regulate contraction. Development of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy due to this mutation can thus be traced to a defect in the energetics of thin filament conformational switching. Rabbit fast skeletal muscle actin and myosin subfragment 1 were purified to homogeneity as described previously (14Rosol M. Lehman W. Craig R. Landis C. Butters C. Tobacman L.S. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 908-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Cardiac tropomyosin and troponin subunits were purified (14Rosol M. Lehman W. Craig R. Landis C. Butters C. Tobacman L.S. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 908-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) from bovine heart obtained at a local slaughterhouse. Bovine cardiac TnT containing a 28-residue COOH-terminal truncation was expressed in DE3 cells using the pET3d-based expression vector, as described previously (6Tobacman L.S. Lin D. Butters C.A. Landis C.A. Back N. Pavlov D. Homsher E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28363-28370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), as was wild type recombinant TnT. In humans, the FHC-inducing splice site mutation in cardiac TnT, intron 15 G1A, results in two truncated proteins, one missing 14 COOH-terminal residues, and the other in which the 28 COOH-terminal residues are replaced by seven novel residues. In some experiments (as indicated), TnT was carboxymethylated on Cys39 using [3H]iodoacetic acid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Labeled and unlabeled troponins were reconstituted by combining TnI, TnC, and TnT under denaturing conditions in a 1:1:1 mixture, followed by sequential dialysis, and G100 chromatography monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (6Tobacman L.S.

Troponin binds very tightly to the thin filament, making the affinity difficult to measure directly. Therefore, the effect of the mutation on this process was determined by competition (21Hinkle A. Goranson A. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274 (; Correction (1999) J. Biol. Chem.274, 31750): 7157-7164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Unlabeled control or mutant troponin was used to displace radiolabeled control troponin from the thin filament. Increasing concentrations of unlabeled troponin were added to labeled thin filaments, and displacement was measured by determining the supernatant radioactivity after thin filament sedimentation in a TLA100 ultracentrifuge at 35,000 rpm for 30 min. Data were analyzed as in Hinkle et al. (21Hinkle A. Goranson A. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274 (; Correction (1999) J. Biol. Chem.274, 31750): 7157-7164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), to determine the value for KR, i.e.the ratio of the affinity of the competing troponin for the thin filament, relative to the thin filament affinity of control [3H]troponin. Conditions: 25 °C, 7 μmactin, 7 μm myosin S1, 3 μm tropomyosin, 1 μm3H-labeled troponin, 10 mmTris (pH 7.5), 300 mm KCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm EGTA, and either 0 or 0.6 mm CaCl2. These high ionic strength conditions were used to impair troponin-tropomyosin polymerization, which otherwise interferes with binding measurements (22Hill L.E. Mehegan J.P. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16106-16113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Competing unlabeled troponin was added to samples at concentrations ranging between 0 and 4 μm. Thin filaments were reconstituted by mixing F-actin (24 μm) first with cardiac tropomyosin (8 μm) and then troponin (8 μm, prepared as above from wild type troponin I and C and mutant TnT) in a solution of 250 mm KCl (used to prevent thin filament aggregation that tends to be induced by troponin), 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.1). Filaments were allowed to incubate at room temperature (∼25 °C) for 5–10 min before making a 20-fold dilution with additional buffer lacking KCl such that the final KCl concentration was 12.5 mm. Samples of reconstituted filaments were also treated with Ca2+ by a comparable 20-fold dilution in the same buffer lacking both KCl and EGTA but containing 0.1 mmCaCl2. Diluted filaments were then applied to carbon-coated electron microscope grids and negatively stained as described previously (23Moody C. Lehman W. Craig R. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1990; 11: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Electron micrograph images were recorded on a Philips CM120 electron microscope at × 60,000 magnification under low dose conditions (∼12 e−/Å2). Micrographs were digitized using either Eikonix model 1412 or Imacon Flextight Precision II scanners at a pixel size corresponding to 0.7 nm in the filaments. Regions of filaments were selected and straightened as described previously (24Hodgkinson J.L. El-Mezgueldi M. Craig R. Vibert P. Marston S.B. Lehman W. J. Mol.

While actin and tropomyosin contributions are readily delineated in reconstructions, densities due to troponin are not apparent (see Ref. 30Milligan R.A. Whittaker M. Safer D.

Tropomyosin and actin densities displayed in reconstructions were significant (32Milligan R.A. Flicker P.F. J.

To measure myosin S1-ADP binding to control and mutant thin filaments, actin was labeled on Cys374 withN-(1-pyrenyl)iodoacetamide, which is sensitive to bound S1 (34Criddle A.H. Geeves M.A. Jeffries T. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Steady state fluorescence intensity was monitored during titration of myosin S1 in 1.8-ml stirred, water-jacketed samples at 25 °C. Excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 368 and 407 nm, respectively, using an SLM 8000 spectrofluorometer. The conditions were 1 μm actin, 0.4 μm tropomyosin, 0.4 μm control or mutant troponin, 20 mmimidazole (pH 7.5), 150 mm KCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 2 mm ADP, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 25 units of hexokinase, 1 mm glucose, 20 μmP1,P5-di(adenosine 5′)-pentaphosphate, 0.5 mm EGTA, with or without CaCl2 added to 0.6 mm.

In consideration of Table I, this analysis assumed that the mutation selectively alters the free energy for formation of the myosin-blocking state and the Ca2+ state of the thin filament, to degrees determined by curve-fitting of the myosin S1 binding data.

Open table in a new tab The tabulated values are measurements of KR: the affinity of troponin for actin-tropomyosin thin filaments, relative to the affinity of wild type troponin labeled with [3H]iodoacetic acid on TnT Cys39. Results are based upon competitive binding experiments as shown in representative data in Fig. 1. Ca2+ controls muscle contraction by reversibly binding to the globular domain of troponin, which includes TnC, TnI, and a portion of TnT that contains the 28 residues removed by the FHC splice site mutation (reviewed in Ref. 36Tobacman L.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 447-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The interaction of troponin's globular domain with actin and tropomyosin is Ca2+-sensitive and is believed crucial for regulation. Previously, we showed that truncation of TnT's 28 COOH-terminal residues weakens troponin binding to thin filaments (6Tobacman L.S. Lin D. Butters C.A. Landis C.A. Back N. Pavlov D. Homsher E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28363-28370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the absence of Ca2+, the mutant troponin has only 22% the normal affinity for the thin filament, and in the presence of Ca2+ its affinity is 43% that of control troponin (TableI) (6Tobacman L.S. Lin D. Butters C.A. Landis C.A. Back N. Pavlov D. Homsher E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28363-28370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We show here that, in contrast, the mutation has little effect on troponin binding when myosin is also bound to the thin filament (Fig. 1). In averages of multiple experiments such as that shown in Fig. 1, binding of troponin to filaments decorated with myosin subfragment 1 (S1) was only slightly diminished by the FHC TnT mutation. The affinity was almost 75% that of the labeled control troponin, considerably greater than the values obtained in the absence of myosin S1 (Table I). Thus the mutation has different effects on thin filament stability under different conditions, suggesting that it could affect the equilibrium constants among the various thin filament conformations and therefore transitions among thin filament states. Although the above measurements provide thermodynamic information on thin filament stability, they do not determine how the TnT mutation might affect filament structure. For example, the position of tropomyosin could be abnormal in the presence of the mutant TnT, especially in the absence of both Ca2+ and myosin, when troponin binding to the thin filament is particularly weak. Electron microscopy was performed to determine the structural impact of the mutant TnT on thin filaments reconstituted with otherwise normal troponin subunits and tropomyosin. Thin filaments in electron micrographs of negatively stained samples containing normal and mutant troponin (Fig.2) were well dispersed in both the presence and absence of Ca2+, so any effects were not due to possible nonspecific filament aggregation caused by the mutation. In three-dimensional reconstructions of thin filaments reconstituted using mutant TnT, the position of tropomyosin was readily identified in helical projection and cross-section (Fig.3) and in surface view (Fig.4), both in the presence and absence of Ca2+. In filaments examined in the absence of Ca2+, tropomyosin was positioned at the inner aspect of the outer domain of actin in close contact with actin subdomains 1 and 2. In contrast, in the presence of Ca2+, tropomyosin moved to the outer edge of the inner domain of actin over subdomains 3 and 4, exposing most of the actin residues believed to interact with myosin. This regulatory movement of tropomyosin was indistinguishable from that observed in our previous work with cardiac muscle thin filaments containing wild type troponin examined under Ca2+ and Ca2+-free conditions (14Rosol M.

Since tropomyosin was found in the normal blocking and Ca2+-induced positions in these filaments, the effects of the TnT mutation on inhibition and activation of myosin S1-thin filament MgATPase rates and on troponin-thin filament binding were not due to aberrant tropomyosin position.Figure 3Helical projections (a,b) and transverse sections (z-sections) (c, d) of maps of three-dimensional reconstructions of negatively stained F-actin tropomyosin-troponin complexes containing mutant troponin T. Helical projections were formed by projecting component densities down the long pitch actin helices (i.e. along the n = 2 helical tracks) onto a plane perpendicular to the thin filament axis; hence, the resulting projections show axially averaged positions of tropomyosin relative to actin made to appear bilaterally symmetrical about actin's central axis. In contrast, transverse sections show the position of tropomyosin at a given axial level along filaments and connectivity to specific subdomains of actin. Because adjacent actin monomers on either side of the filament axis are staggered, sectioning through the center of actin subdomains 1 and 3 of one actin monomer results in sectioning through subdomains 2 and 4 of the other.a and c, EGTA-treated filaments, actin subdomains 1–4 are labeled in c. b and d, Ca2+-treated F-actin. Note the tropomyosin density (arrows) associated with subdomains 1 and 2, i.e.on the outer domain of actin monomers of EGTA-treated filaments, and on subdomains 3 and 4, i.e. on the inner domain of in Ca2+-treated filaments. Sections shown are at the same axial position in each reconstruction, and the actin monomers in projections and sections have the same relative orientation. Reconstructions were generated by averaging a data set containing 20 EGTA-treated filaments and another having 8 Ca2+-treated filaments. The average phase residuals (Ψ ± S.D.), measuring the relative fitting between individual filaments in each set and the averaged data, were 60.1 ± 5.0° and 60.6 ± 7.2° for EGTA- and Ca2+-treated filaments, respectively. The average up-down phase residuals (ΔΨ ± S.D.), measuring relative filament polarity, were 19.5 ± 5.6° and 17.1 ± 7.0°, respectively. The densities contributing to actin and tropomyosin in the maps shown were statistically significant at confidence levels greater than 99.95%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4Surface views of reconstruction of mutant thin filaments showing the positions of tropomyosin strands on actin. In EGTA (a), tropomyosin is associated with the inner edge of the outer actin domain of actin. Note the interaction of tropomyosin with actin subdomain-1 (single white arrowheads) and bridge of density over the neighboring subdomain-2, while subdomains-3 and -4 remain unobstructed (black cross). After Ca2+ treatment (b), tropomyosin is associated with the outer edge of the inner actin domain of actin. Note that tropomyosin now interacts with subdomain-3 (double white arrowheads) while bridging over subdomain-4 and that here subdomains-1 and -2 (black asterisk) are unobstructed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The above structural results leave unanswered the question of how TnT truncation alters Ca2+-sensitive regulation of cardiac contraction. To address this, the effect of the mutation on myosin S1 binding to the thin filament was examined, since Ca2+-dependent control of this process is central to how troponin and tropomyosin regulate contraction (10Vibert P.

Our results show, as shown previously, that myosin binding to control thin filaments is very cooperative in the absence of Ca2+, resulting in a sigmoidal binding curve (Fig.5, squares) (35Tobacman L.S.

https://openalex.org/W2027613471,"Gab-1 is a multiple docking protein that is tyrosine phosphorylated by receptor tyrosine kinases such as c-Met, hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor receptor, and epidermal growth factor receptor. We have now demonstrated that cell-cell adhesion also induces marked tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab-1 and that disruption of cell-cell adhesion results in its dephosphorylation. An anti-E-cadherin antibody decreased cell-cell adhesion-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab-1, whereas the expression of E-cadherin specifically induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab-1. A relatively selective inhibitor of Src family kinases reduced cell-cell adhesion-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab-1, whereas expression of a dominant-negative mutant of Csk increased it. Disruption of cell-cell adhesion, which reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab-1, also reduced the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt in response to cell-cell adhesion. These results indicate that E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion induces tyrosine phosphorylation by a Src family kinase of Gab-1, thereby regulating the activation of Ras/MAP kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt cascades."
