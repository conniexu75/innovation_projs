https://openalex.org/W2744848102,"Approximately two years ago, two of us (E.B. and V.G.) demonstrated the first experimental application of CRISPR–Cas9 to 'drive' a desired trait throughout a population of fruit flies. In November 2015, this same team at the University of California, San Diego, joined with A.A.J. and others at the University of California, Irvine, to develop a CRISPR-based gene drive for population modification of the malaria vector mosquito Anopheles stephensi. A month later, a group in the United Kingdom applied a CRISPR-based gene drive to another malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae."
https://openalex.org/W2742737065,"Ecological stoichiometry suggests that plant Nitrogen (N)-to-Phosphorus (P) ratios respond to changes in both soil N:P stoichiometry and soil N and P availability. Thus we would expect that soil and plant N:P ratios be significantly related along natural gradients of soil development such as those associated with primary ecological successions. Here we explicitly search for linkages between plant and soil N:P stoichiometry along four primary successions distributed across Europe. We measured N and P content in soils and plant compartments (leaf, stem and root) of 72 wild plant species distributed along two sand dune and two glacier successions where soil age ranges from few to thousand years old. Overall we found that soil N:P ratios strongly increased along successional stages, however, plant N:P ratios were neither related to soil N:P stoichiometry nor to changes in soil N and P availability. Instead changes in plant nutrient stoichiometry were “driven” by plant-functional-group identity. Not only N:P ratios differed between legumes, grasses and forbs but each of these plant functional groups maintained N:P ratios relatively constant across pioneer, middle and advanced successional stages. Our evidence is that soil nutrient stoichiometry may not be a good predictor of changes in plant N:P stoichiometry along natural primary ecological successions, which have not reached yet a retrogressive stage. This could be because wild-plants rely on mechanisms of internal nutrient regulation, which make them less dependent to changes in soil nutrient availability under unpredictable environmental conditions. Further studies need to clarify what underlying evolutionary and eco-physiological mechanisms determine changes in nutrient stoichiometry in plant species distributed across natural environmental gradients."
https://openalex.org/W2745147187,"Among primary brain cancers, gliomas are the most deadly and most refractory to current treatment modalities. Previous reports overwhelmingly support the role of the RNA-binding protein Hu antigen R (HuR) as a positive regulator of glioma disease progression. HuR expression is consistently elevated in tumor tissues, and a cytoplasmic localization appears essential for HuR-dependent oncogenic transformation. Here, we report HuR aggregation (multimerization) in glioma and the analysis of this tumor-specific HuR protein multimerization in clinical brain tumor samples. Using a split luciferase assay, a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer technique, and site-directed mutagenesis, we examined the domains involved in HuR multimerization. Results obtained with the combination of the split HuR luciferase assay with the bioluminescence resonance energy transfer technique suggested that multiple (at least three) HuR molecules come together during HuR multimerization in glioma cells. Using these data, we developed a model of HuR multimerization in glioma cells. We also demonstrate that exposing glioma cells to the HuR inhibitor tanshinone group compound 15,16-dihydrotanshinone-I or to the newly identified compound 5 disrupts HuR multimerization modules and reduces tumor cell survival and proliferation. In summary, our findings provide new insights into HuR multimerization in glioma and highlight possible pharmacological approaches for targeting HuR domains involved in cancer cell-specific multimerization."
https://openalex.org/W2743359773,"Treponema pallidum ssp. pallidum (T. pallidum), the causative agent of the sexually transmitted disease syphilis, is an uncultivatable human pathogen. The geographical differences in T. pallidum genomes leading to differences in pathogenicity are not yet understood. Presently, twelve T. pallidum genomes are available to the public, all of which are American in origin and often co-infect patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In this study, we examined the T. pallidum subsp. pallidum strain Amoy, a syphilis pathogen found in Xiamen, China. We sequenced its genome using Illumina next-generation sequencing technology and obtained a nearly (98.83%) complete genome of approximately 1.12 Mbps. The new genome shows good synteny with its five T. pallidum sibling strains (Nichols, SS14, Mexico A, DAL-1, and Chicago), among which SS14 is the strain closest to the Amoy strain. Compared with strain SS14, the Amoy strain possesses four uncharacterized strain-specific genes and is likely missing six genes, including a gene encoding the TPR domain protein, which may partially account for the comparatively low virulence and toxicity of the Amoy strain in animal infection. Notably, we did not detect the 23S rRNA A2058G/A2059G mutation in the Amoy strain, which likely explains the sensitivity of Amoy strain to macrolides. The results of this study will lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of syphilis and the geographical distribution of T. pallidum genotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2743018327,"Pediatric liver failure patients frequently develop multiple organ failure and require continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) as part of supportive therapy in the pediatric intensive care unit. While many centers employ no anticoagulation for fear of bleeding complications, balanced coagulation disturbance predisposes these patients to clotting as well as bleeding, making maintenance of longer circuit life to deliver adequate dialysis clearance challenging. Regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA) is an attractive option as it avoids systemic anticoagulation, but since citrate metabolism is impaired in liver failure, concerns about toxicity has limited its use. Pediatric data on RCA with liver failure is very scarce. We aimed to establish safety and efficacy of RCA in pediatric liver failure patients on CRRT. Retrospective review of pediatric patients with liver failure receiving CRRT over 30 months. Demographic data and CRRT related data were collected by chart review. Citrate accumulation (CA) was defined as total calcium (mg/dl) /ionized calcium (mmol/L) ratio >2.5 for > 48 hours. Efficacy was assessed by filter life. Safety was assessed by frequency of adverse events ((AEs) defined as bleeding, hemodynamic instability, arrhythmias). Fifty-one patients (median age 3.5 (IQR 0.75–14.2) years) received 861 CRRT days; 70% experienced at least one episode of CA, only 37% were recorded as such in the medical record. AE rate was 93/1000 CRRT days and did not differ between CA days and others. Median filter life was 66 hours (IQR 29–74); 63% filters lasted longer than 48 hrs. Though common, CA was not associated with increased AEs on in pediatric liver failure patients on CRRT receiving RCA. Filter life was adequate. RCA appears an effective anticoagulation for CRRT in pediatric liver failure. Application of a structured definition would increase recognition of CA to allow timely intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2743628961,"Within the microenvironment of multiple sclerosis lesions, oligodendrocytes are subject to metabolic stress reflecting effects of focal ischemia and inflammation. Previous studies have shown that under optimal conditions in vitro, the respiratory activity of human adult brain-derived oligodendrocytes is lower and more predominantly glycolytic compared to oligodendrocytes differentiated in vitro from post natal rat brain oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. In response to sub-lethal metabolic stress, adult human oligodendrocytes reduce overall energy production rate impacting the capacity to maintain myelination. Here, we directly compare the metabolic profiles of oligodendrocytes derived from adult rat brain with oligodendrocytes newly differentiated in vitro from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells obtained from the post natal rat brain, under both optimal culture and metabolic stress (low/no glucose) conditions. Oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification rates were measured using a Seahorse extracellular flux analyzer. Our findings indicate that under optimal conditions, adult rat oligodendrocytes preferentially use glycolysis whereas newly differentiated post natal rat oligodendrocytes, and the oligodendrocyte progenitor cells from which they are derived, mainly utilize oxidative phosphorylation to produce ATP. Metabolic stress increases the rate of ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation and significantly reduces glycolysis in adult oligodendrocytes. The rate of ATP production was relatively unchanged in newly differentiated post natal oligodendrocytes under these stress conditions, while it was significantly reduced in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. Our study indicates that both age and maturation influence the metabolic profile under optimal and stressed conditions, emphasizing the need to consider these variables for in vitro studies that aim to model adult human disease."

https://openalex.org/W2744270999,"Metabolic enzymes have been found to play roles in plant development. Sucrose synthase (SUS) is one of the two enzyme families involved in sucrose cleavage in plants. In tomato, six SUS genes have been found. We generated transgenic tomato plants with RNAi suppression of SlSUS1, SlSUS3 and SlSUS4 genes. Independent transgenic lines with RNAi suppression of more than one SUS gene exhibited morphological effects on their cotyledons and leaf structure, but there were no significant effects on their carbohydrate levels, demonstrating that SUS has a developmental function, in addition to its metabolic function. Shoot apices of the transgenic lines showed elevated expression of JAGGED (JAG) and the auxin transporter PIN1. In a PIN1-GFP fusion reporter/SUS-RNAi hybrid, PIN1-GFP patterns were altered in developing leaves (as compared to control plants), indicating that SlSUS suppression alters auxin signaling. These results suggest possible roles for SUS in the regulation of plant growth and leaf morphology, in association with the auxin-signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2743448946,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most prevalent and life-threatening malignancies worldwide. There are few diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and druggable targets for HCC. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) is a marker of stem cells in a variety of cancers, but the mRNA levels and prognostic value of ALDH1 isoforms in HCC patients remain unknown. In the present study, gene ontology annotation of the ALDH1 family was performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID), and the gene pathway analsis was performed using GeneMANIA software. The initial prognostic value of ALDH1 expression in 360 HCC patients was assessed using the OncoLnc database. The expression levels of ALDH1 isoforms in normal liver tissues and clinical specimens of cancer vs. normal control datasets were determined using the GTEx and Oncomine databases, respectively. We then analyzed the prognostic value of ALDH1 expression in 212 hepatitis B virus (HBV)–related HCC patients using the GEO database. We found that the ALDH1 isoform showed high aldehyde dehydrogenase activity. The ALDH1A1, ALDH1B1, and ALDH1L1 genes encoded for the ALDH1 enzyme. High ALDH1B1 expression had protective qualities in HCC patients. Moreover, HBV–related HCC patients who showed high ALDH1L1 gene expression had a better clinical outcomes. In addition, high ALDH1A1 expression was associated with a 57–month recurrence–free survival in HBV-related HCC patients. High ALDH1B1 expression was protective for HCCs with multiple nodules and high serum alpha–fetoprotein (AFP) level. Furthermore, high serum AFP levels contributed to lower ALDH1L1. ALDH1A1, ALDH1B1, and ALDH1L1, all of which were considered promising diagnostic and prognostic markers as well as potential drug targets."
https://openalex.org/W2743916482,"Core self-evaluations (CSE) have predictive value for important work outcomes such as job satisfaction and job performance. However, little is known about the mechanisms that may explain these relationships. The purpose of the present study is to contribute to CSE theory by proposing and subsequently providing a first test of theoretically relevant mediating paths through which CSE may be related to work engagement. Based on approach/avoidance motivation and Job Demands-Resources theory, we examined a perception (via job characteristics), action (via job crafting), and development path (via career competencies). Two independent samples were obtained from employees working in Germany and The Netherlands (N = 303 and N = 404, respectively). When taking all mediators into account, results showed that the perception path represented by autonomy and social support played a minor role in the relationship between CSE and work engagement. Specifically, autonomy did not function as a mediator in both samples while social support played a marginally significant role in the CSE–work engagement relationship in sample 1 and received full support in sample 2. The action path exemplified by job crafting mediated the relationship between CSE and work engagement in both samples. Finally, the development path operationalized with career competencies mediated the relationship between CSE and work engagement in sample 1. The study presents evidence for an action and development path over and above the often tested perception path to explain how CSE is related to work engagement. This is one of the first studies to propose and show that CSE not only influences perceptions but also triggers employee actions and developmental strategies that relate to work engagement."
https://openalex.org/W2744826876,"One of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease is the formation of extracellular amyloid plaques that consist mainly of abnormally aggregated forms of amyloid β (Aβ) peptides. These peptides are generated by γ-secretase–catalyzed cleavage of a dimeric membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (C99) of the amyloid precursor protein. Although C99 homodimerization has been linked to Aβ production and changes in the aggregation-determining Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, the motif through which C99 dimerizes has remained controversial. Here, we have used two independent assays to gain insight into C99 homodimerization in the context of the membrane of live cells: bioluminescence resonance energy transfer and Tango membrane protein–protein interaction assays, which were further confirmed by traditional pull-down assays. Our results indicate a four-amino acid region within the C99 transmembrane helix (43TVIV46) as well as its local secondary structure as critical determinants for homodimerization. These four amino acids are also a hot spot of familial Alzheimer's disease–linked mutations that both decrease C99 homodimerization and γ-secretase cleavage and alter the initial cleavage site to increase the Aβ42/40 ratio.

https://openalex.org/W2743029692,"Postsynaptic density 95 (PSD-95) is a major synaptic scaffolding protein that plays a key role in bidirectional synaptic plasticity, which is a process important for learning and memory. It is known that PSD-95 shows increased dynamics upon induction of plasticity. However, the underlying structural and functional changes in PSD-95 that mediate its role in plasticity remain unclear. Here we show that phosphorylation of PSD-95 at Ser-561 in its guanylate kinase (GK) domain, which is mediated by the partitioning-defective 1 (Par1) kinases, regulates a conformational switch and is important for bidirectional plasticity. Using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor, we show that a phosphomimetic mutation of Ser-561 promotes an intramolecular interaction between GK and the nearby Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, leading to a closed conformation, whereas a non-phosphorylatable S561A mutation or inhibition of Par1 kinase activity decreases SH3-GK interaction, causing PSD-95 to adopt an open conformation. In addition, S561A mutation facilitates the interaction between PSD-95 and its binding partners. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching imaging reveals that the S561A mutant shows increased stability, whereas the phosphomimetic S561D mutation increases PSD-95 dynamics at the synapse. Moreover, molecular replacement of endogenous PSD-95 with the S561A mutant blocks dendritic spine structural plasticity during chemical long-term potentiation and long-term depression. Endogenous Ser-561 phosphorylation is induced by synaptic NMDA receptor activation, and the SH3-GK domains exhibit a Ser-561 phosphorylation-dependent switch to a closed conformation during synaptic plasticity. Our results provide novel mechanistic insight into the regulation of PSD-95 in dendritic spine structural plasticity through phosphorylation-mediated regulation of protein dynamics and conformation."

https://openalex.org/W2742840256,"The Ror family receptor tyrosine kinases, Ror1 and Ror2, play important roles in regulating developmental morphogenesis and tissue- and organogenesis, but their roles in tissue regeneration in adult animals remain largely unknown. In this study, we examined the expression and function of Ror1 and Ror2 during skeletal muscle regeneration. Using an in vivo skeletal muscle injury model, we show that expression of Ror1 and Ror2 in skeletal muscles is induced transiently by the inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α and IL-1β, after injury and that inhibition of TNF-α and IL-1β by neutralizing antibodies suppresses expression of Ror1 and Ror2 in injured muscles. Importantly, expression of Ror1, but not Ror2, was induced primarily in Pax7-positive satellite cells (SCs) after muscle injury, and administration of neutralizing antibodies decreased the proportion of Pax7-positive proliferative SCs after muscle injury. We also found that stimulation of a mouse myogenic cell line, C2C12 cells, with TNF-α or IL-1β induced expression of Ror1 via NF-κB activation and that suppressed expression of Ror1 inhibited their proliferative responses in SCs. Intriguingly, SC-specific depletion of Ror1 decreased the number of Pax7-positive SCs after muscle injury. Collectively, these findings indicate for the first time that Ror1 has a critical role in regulating SC proliferation during skeletal muscle regeneration. We conclude that Ror1 might be a suitable target in the development of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to manage muscular disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2742691451,"4'-Hydroxywogonin (4'-HW), a flavonoid, has been isolated from various plants and shown to inhibit NO production in macrophages. However, the molecular mechanisms and its in vivo activity have not been determined. Our study aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory effects of 4'-HW in vitro and in vivo. We showed that 4'-HW potently reduced the expression levels of COX-2 and iNOS as well as their products, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and nitric oxide (NO) respectively, in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. 4'-HW also suppressed LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines at mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, 4'-HW blocked the interaction of TAK1 and TAB1 in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages, resulting in an inhibition of the TAK1/IKK/NF-κB signaling pathway. Furthermore, 4'-HW also reduced the phosphorylation of MAPKs and PI3/Akt signaling pathways in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. 4'-HW was also significantly decreased the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. The effect of 4'-HW was confirmed in vivo. 4'-HW exhibited potent protective effect against LPS-induced ALI in mice. These findings indicate that 4'-HW suppresses the LPS-induced response in vitro and in vivo. It is likely that the inhibition of the TAK1/IKK/NF-κB, MAPKs and PI3/AKT signaling pathways contribute to the anti-inflammatory effects of 4'-HW. Our study suggests that 4'-HW may be an important functional constituent in the plants and has the potential value to be developed as a novel anti-inflammatory agent."

Missense mutations of DCTN1 have been identified as a possible genetic risk factor for ALS. Here, we tested the DCTN1 protein-coding exons in 510 sporadic ALS patients in whom SOD1, TARDBP, FUS, and C9orf72 genes were screened before. Polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing were used for mutation discovery. The results revealed two rare heterozygous missense variants, c.1867C>T (p.R623W) and c.2798C>T (p.A933V). These two patients exhibited spinal disease onset without cognitive impairment, and their onset age and diagnosis delay was within the average range of Chinese ALS patients. Our results suggested that variants in DCTN1 are not common risk factors for Chinese sporadic ALS and that the frequency of variants of unknown significance in the cohort study was 0.39%."

https://openalex.org/W2742620842,"Extensive liver resections are common, and bleeding is frequent in these operations. Impaired regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PHx) may contribute to liver failure. We thus assessed the impact of acute bleeding on the liver regeneration progress after PHx and explored possible contributing molecular mechanisms. In rats, the regeneration progress was delayed and attenuated with PHx and bleeding and was not restored with colloid resuscitation. Livers restored their initial volume by postoperative day (POD) 2 after PHx through hepatocyte proliferation vs. POD 4 in the PHx and bleeding group, primarily by hepatocyte hypertrophy. With bleeding, hepatocyte proliferation was hindered in two mechanisms: by inhibiting cells from starting proliferation and by causing hindrance in G1/S progression. Liver hypoxia was prominent, with significant prolonged up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) and HIF-targeted genes only in the PHx and bleeding group. Gene expression profiling revealed alterations in numerous genes that belong to critical pathways, including cell cycle, DNA replication, PI3K-Akt, purine, and pyrimidine metabolism. Because liver surgery is frequently performed in patients with a predamaged liver, an improper regenerative process after PHx and bleeding might lead to decompensation. The results hint at specific pathways to target in order to improve liver regeneration during PHx and bleeding.-Matot, I., Nachmansson, N., Duev, O., Schulz, S., Schroeder-Stein, K., Frede, S., Abramovitch, R. Impaired liver regeneration after hepatectomy and bleeding is associated with a shift from hepatocyte proliferation to hypertrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2742850436,"The paradigm of research universities linked to the emergence of university rankings has unified and universalized the criteria relating to the quality of higher education. This situation has led to multiple responses across global society, which has started rating the quality of higher education systems through these rankings, supported by a series of indicators aligned to the characteristics of research universities. Given that the quality of a country's higher education is one of the fundamental pillars of its development, many countries have started to take government action in this respect. In the case of Peru this has not taken long, with the approval of Law 30220 in 2014. This aims to regulate the quality of higher education through a series of specific conditions governed by a newly created body known as SUNEDU. This article uses a Delphi panel to analyze the existing relationship between the conditions imposed by SUNEDU and the research universities' intrinsic characteristics. During the Delphi panel a consensus was reached through an acceptable and stable level of responses, resulting in confirmation that there is alignment between the conditions imposed by SUNEDU and the intrinsic characteristics of research universities."
https://openalex.org/W2744860701,"Chronic inflammation and oxidative stress are striking features of Duchenne muscular dystrophy disease. Diacerhein is an anthraquinone, which exhibits anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Based on their actions, the present study evaluated the effects of diacerhein against myonecrosis, oxidative stress and inflammatory response in the diaphragm muscle of mdx mice and compared these results to current treatment widely used in DMD patients, with a main focus on the impact of prednisone. The results demonstrated that diacerhein treatment prevented muscle damage indicated by a decrease in the IgG uptake by muscle fibers, lower CK levels in serum, reduction of fibers with central nuclei with a concomitant increase in fibers with peripheral nuclei. It also had an effect on the inflammatory process, decreasing the inflammatory area, macrophage staining and TNF-α and IL-1β content. Regarding oxidative stress, diacerhein treatment was effective in reducing the ROS and lipid peroxidation in the diaphragm muscle from mdx mice. Compared to prednisone treatment, our findings demonstrated that diacerhein treatment improved the dystrophic phenotype in the diaphragm muscle of mdx mice similar to that of glucocorticoid therapy. In this respect, this work suggests that diacerhein has a potential use as an alternative drug in dystrophinopathy treatment and recommends that its anti-inflammatory and antioxidants properties in the dystrophic muscle should be better understood."
https://openalex.org/W2742330323,"Rainfall patterns and land cover are two important factors that affect the runoff generation process. To determine the surface and subsurface flows associated with different rainfall patterns on sloping Ferralsols under different land cover types, observational data related to surface and subsurface flows from 5 m × 15 m plots were collected from 2010 to 2012. The experiment was conducted to assess three land cover types (grass, litter cover and bare land) in the Jiangxi Provincial Soil and Water Conservation Ecological Park. During the study period, 114 natural rainfall events produced subsurface flow and were divided into four groups using k-means clustering according to rainfall duration, rainfall depth and maximum 30-min rainfall intensity. The results showed that the total runoff and surface flow values were highest for bare land under all four rainfall patterns and lowest for the covered plots. However, covered plots generated higher subsurface flow values than bare land. Moreover, the surface and subsurface flows associated with the three land cover types differed significantly under different rainfall patterns. Rainfall patterns with low intensities and long durations created more subsurface flow in the grass and litter cover types, whereas rainfall patterns with high intensities and short durations resulted in greater surface flow over bare land. Rainfall pattern I had the highest surface and subsurface flow values for the grass cover and litter cover types. The highest surface flow value and lowest subsurface flow value for bare land occurred under rainfall pattern IV. Rainfall pattern II generated the highest subsurface flow value for bare land. Therefore, grass or litter cover are able to convert more surface flow into subsurface flow under different rainfall patterns. The rainfall patterns studied had greater effects on subsurface flow than on total runoff and surface flow for covered surfaces, as well as a greater effect on surface flows associated with bare land."
https://openalex.org/W2744269519,"The neurological complications of AIDS (neuroAIDS) during the infection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are symptomized by non-specific, multifaceted neurological conditions and therefore, defining a specific diagnosis/treatment mechanism(s) for this neuro-complexity at the molecular level remains elusive. Using an in silico based integrated gene network analysis we discovered that HIV infection shares convergent gene networks with each of twelve neurological disorders selected in this study. Importantly, a common gene network was identified among HIV infection, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and age macular degeneration. An mRNA microarray analysis in HIV-infected monocytes showed significant changes in the expression of several genes of this in silico derived common pathway which suggests the possible physiological relevance of this gene-circuit in driving neuroAIDS condition. Further, this unique gene network was compared with another in silico derived novel, convergent gene network which is shared by seven major neurological disorders (Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Age Macular Degeneration, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Vascular Dementia, and Restless Leg Syndrome). These networks differed in their gene circuits; however, in large, they involved innate immunity signaling pathways, which suggests commonalities in the immunological basis of different neuropathogenesis. The common gene circuits reported here can provide a prospective platform to understand how gene-circuits belonging to other neuro-disorders may be convoluted during real-time neuroAIDS condition and it may elucidate the underlying–and so far unknown–genetic overlap between HIV infection and neuroAIDS risk. Also, it may lead to a new paradigm in understanding disease progression, identifying biomarkers, and developing therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2745200974,"Sinapine is a major anti-nutritive compound that accumulates in the seeds of Brassica species. When ingested, sinapine imparts gritty flavuor in meat and milk of animals and fishy odor to eggs of brown egg layers, thereby compromising the potential use of the valuable protein rich seed meal. Sinapine content in Brassica juncea germplasm ranges from 6.7 to 15.1 mg/g of dry seed weight (DSW) which is significantly higher than the prescribed permissible level of 3.0 mg/g of DSW. Due to limited natural genetic variability, conventional plant breeding approach for reducing the sinapine content has largely been unsuccessful. Hence, transgenic approach for gene silencing was adopted by targeting two genes—SGT and SCT, encoding enzymes UDP- glucose: sinapate glucosyltransferase and sinapoylglucose: choline sinapoyltransferase, respectively, involved in the final two steps of sinapine biosynthetic pathway. These two genes were isolated from B. juncea and eight silencing constructs were developed using three different RNA silencing approaches viz. antisense RNA, RNAi and artificial microRNA. Transgenics in B. juncea were developed following Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. From a total of 1232 independent T0 transgenic events obtained using eight silencing constructs, 25 homozygous lines showing single gene inheritance were identified in the T2 generation. Reduction of seed sinapine content in these lines ranged from 15.8% to 67.2%; the line with maximum reduction had sinapine content of 3.79 mg/g of DSW. The study also revealed that RNAi method was more efficient than the other two methods used in this study."
https://openalex.org/W2743077117,"JMJD6 is known to localize in the nucleus, exerting histone arginine demethylase and lysyl hydroxylase activities. A novel localization of JMJD6 in the extracellular matrix, resulting from its secretion as a soluble protein, was unveiled by a new anti-JMJD6 mAb called P4E11, which was developed to identify new targets in the stroma. Recombinant JMJD6 binds with collagen type I (Coll-I), and distinct JMJD6 peptides interfere with collagen fibrillogenesis, collagen-fibronectin interaction, and adhesion of human tumor cells to the collagen substrate. P4E11 and collagen binding to JMJD6 are mutually exclusive because the amino acid sequences of JMJD6 necessary for the interaction with Coll-I are part of the conformational epitope recognized by P4E11. In mice injected with mouse 4T1 breast carcinoma cells, treatment with P4E11 reduced fibrosis at the primary tumor and prevented lung metastases. Reduction of fibrosis has also been documented in human breast and ovarian tumors (MDA-MB-231 and IGROV1, respectively) xenotransplanted into immunodeficient mice treated with P4E11. In summary, this study uncovers a new localization and function for JMJD6 that is most likely independent from its canonical enzymatic activities, and demonstrates that JMJD6 can functionally interact with Coll-I. P4E11 mAb, inhibiting JMJD6/Coll-I interaction, represents a new opportunity to target fibrotic and tumor diseases.-Miotti, S., Gulino, A., Ferri, R., Parenza, M., Chronowska, A., Lecis, D., Sangaletti, S., Tagliabue, E., Tripodo, C., Colombo, M.

https://openalex.org/W2743403511,"Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) of H5 subtype have persistently caused outbreaks in domestic poultry and wild birds worldwide and sporadically infected humans. Rapid and accurate diagnosis is one of the key strategies for the control of H5 HPAIVs. However, the sensitivity of the diagnosis of H5 HPAIVs has gradually reduced due to extensive antigenic variation during their evolution. Particularly, the previously developed immunochromatographic diagnosis kit for H5 viruses, Linjudge Flu A/H5, exhibits reduced detection of H5 HPAIVs isolated in recent years. In the present study, we established a new advanced H5 rapid immunochromatographic detection kit (New Linjudge Flu A/H5) by a combination of two anti-H5 hemagglutinin monoclonal antibodies, A64/1 previously applied in the Linjudge Flu A/H5 and A32/2, a novel monoclonal antibody generated from a clade 2.3.4.4 H5 HPAIV. The new kit broadly detected all classical and recent H5 influenza viruses and showed a higher specificity and sensitivity than the original Linjudge Flu A/H5 with recently circulating H5 HPAIVs. Furthermore, the applicability of the New Linjudge Flu A/H5 was demonstrated by detecting antigens from the swabs and tissue homogenates of naturally infected birds and experimentally infected chickens with H5N6 HPAIVs belonging to the genetic clade 2.3.4.4. Our study, therefore, can provide an effective point-of-care rapid antigen detection kit for the surveillance of H5 avian influenza viruses and as a prompt countermeasure against the current widespread of the clade 2.3.4.4 H5 HPAIVs in domestic and wild birds."

Whereas 10 bp of DNA was sufficient to support PU.1 binding as a monomer, additional flanking bases were required to invoke sequential dimerization of the bound protein. NMR spectroscopy revealed a marked loss of signal intensity in the 2:1 complex, and mutational analysis implicated the distal surface away from the bound DNA as the dimerization interface. Hydroxyl radical DNA footprinting indicated that the site-specifically bound PU.1 dimers occupied an extended DNA interface downstream from the 5′-GGAA-3′ core consensus relative to its 1:1 counterpart, thus explaining the apparent site size requirement for sequential dimerization. The site-specifically bound PU.1 dimer resisted competition from nonspecific DNA and showed affinities similar to other functionally significant PU.1 interactions. As sequential dimerization did not occur with the ETS domain of Ets-1, a close structural homolog of PU.1, 2:1 complex formation may represent an alternative autoinhibitory mechanism in the ETS family at the protein-DNA level.

https://openalex.org/W2745097372,"A new genus and species, Pseudorestias lirimensis, is described from the southern part of the Chilean Altiplano. While sharing several characters that clearly align the new species with Orestias, this new fish is characterized by numerous autapomorphies: the Meckel cartilage is a continuous cartilage that broadly expands posteriorly (in large specimens, it keeps its anterior part and is resorbed posteriorly), the basibranchials are fused into one long element, the second pharyngobranchial is not displaced dorsally over pharyngobranchial tooth plate 3+4, but they are aligned, the anterior and posterior ceratohyals are closely articulated keeping a scarce amount of cartilage between both bones and ventral to them, ossified middle and distal dorsal radials are present in females as well as ossified middle and distal anal radials. Pseudorestias lirimensis presents strong sexual dimorphism associated to size. Females are almost twice as large and long than males, neuromast lines are absent in males, a mesethmoid is present in males, squamation on head is reduced in males, and ossified middle and distal radial of dorsal fin are cartilaginous in males. Pseudorestias and Orestias are suggested as the sole members of the tribe Orestiini. A list of characters diagnosing the tribe is provided. The presence of the new genus is interpreted as a possible result of the ecosystem isolation where the fish is living from surrounding basins-as early as possibly from the Miocene-Pliocene times-and its physical and chemical characteristics. Small populations, living conditions, small habitat, and reduced distribution make this species a strong candidate to be considered critically endangered, a situation already established for all other Chilean species living in the Altiplano. There is high probability it will become extinct due to water demands and climate change in the region."

https://openalex.org/W2743532287,"Little information has been available on the shifts in the microbial community in decaying fallen logs during critical periods in cold forests. Minjiang fir (Abies faxoniana) fallen logs in decay classes I-V were in situ incubated on the forest floor of an alpine forest in the eastern Tibet Plateau. The microbial community was investigated during the seasonal snow cover period (SP), snow thawing period (TP), early growing season (EG) and late growing season (LG) using Phosphorous Lipid Fatty Acid (PLFA) analysis. Total microbial biomass and microbial diversity in fallen logs were much more affected by critical period than decay class, whereas decay class had a stronger effect on microbial diversity than on microbial biomass. Abundant microbial biomass and microbial diversity in logs even without the cover of snow were observed in winter, which could not be linked to thermal insulation by snow cover. The freshly decayed logs functioned as an excellent buffer of environmental variation for microbial organisms during the sharp fluctuations in temperature in winter. We also found distinct decay patterns along with seasonality for heartwood, sapwood and bark, which requires further detailed research. Gram- bacteria mainly dominated the shifts in microbial community composition from SP to EG, while fungi and Gram+ bacteria mainly dominated it from SP to TP. Based on previous work and the present study, we conclude that fallen logs on the forest floor alter ecological processes by influencing microbial communities on woody debris and beneath the soil and litter. Our study also emphasizes the need to maintain a number of fallen logs, especially fresh ones, on the forest floor."

https://openalex.org/W2743983782,"Synaptic activity increases the resistance of neurons to diverse apoptotic insults; however, the underlying mechanisms remain less well understood. Zinc promotes cell survival under varied conditions, but the role of synaptically released zinc in the activity-dependent anti-apoptotic effect is unknown. Using cultured hippocampal slices and primary neurons we show that a typical apoptosis inducer-staurosporine (STP) was able to cause concentration-dependent apoptotic cell death in brain slices; Enhanced synaptic activity by bicuculline (Bic)/4-Aminopyridine (AP) treatment effectively prevented neurons from STP-induced cell apoptosis, as indicated by increased cell survival and suppressed caspase-3 activity. Application of Ca-EDTA, a cell membrane-impermeable zinc chelator which can efficiently capture the synaptically released zinc, completely blocked the neuronal activity-dependent anti-apoptotic effect. Same results were also observed in cultured primary hippocampal neurons. Therefore, our results indicate that synaptic activity improves neuronal resistance to apoptosis via synaptically released zinc."
https://openalex.org/W2744085730,"One of the main questions in the humanities is how cultures and artistic expressions change over time. While a number of researchers have used quantitative computational methods to study historical changes in literature, music, and cinema, our paper offers the first quantitative analysis of historical changes in visual art created by users of a social online network. We propose a number of computational methods for the analysis of temporal development of art images. We then apply these methods to a sample of 270,000 artworks created between 2001 and 2010 by users of the largest social network for art—DeviantArt (www.deviantart.com). We investigate changes in subjects, techniques, sizes, proportions and also selected visual characteristics of images. Because these artworks are classified by their creators into two general categories—Traditional Art and Digital Art—we are also able to investigate if the use of digital tools has had a significant effect on the content and form of artworks. Our analysis reveals a number of gradual and systematic changes over a ten-year period in artworks belonging to both categories."
https://openalex.org/W2742383444,"Mice with spontaneous coat mutations are ideal animal models for studying skin development and tumorigenesis. In this study, skin hair growth cycle abnormalities were examined in NIH hairless mice 42 days after birth (P42) by using hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. To examine the gene expression patterns in the skin of mutant mice, the dorsal skin of P42 female NIH mice and NIH hairless mice was sequenced by RNA-Seq, and 5,068 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified (false discovery rate [FDR] ≥ 2, P < 0.05). A pathway analysis showed that basal cell carcinoma, the cell cycle and the Hippo, Hedgehog and Wnt signaling pathways were up-regulated in NIH hairless mice. Previous studies have shown that these pathways are closely associated with cell proliferation, cell cycle, organ size and cancer development. In contrast, signal transduction, bacterial and parasitic infection, and receptor-mediated pathways, including calcium signaling, were down-regulated in NIH hairless mice. A gene interaction network analysis was performed to identify genes related to hair follicle development. To verify the reliability of the RNA-Seq results, we used q-PCR to analyze 12 key genes identified from the gene interaction network analysis, including eight down-regulated and four up-regulated genes, and the results confirmed the reliability of the RNA-Seq results. Finally, we constructed the differential gene expression profiles of mutant mice by RNA-Seq. NIH hairless mice exhibited abnormalities in hair development and immune-related pathways. Pik3r1 and Pik3r3 were identified as key genes, laying the foundation for additional in-depth studies of hairless mice."
https://openalex.org/W2742695312,"The gut microbiome is highly variable among individuals, largely due to differences in host lifestyle and physiology. However, little is known about the underlying processes or rules that shape the complex microbial community. In this paper, we show that the cumulative relative abundance distribution (CRAD) of microbial species can be approximated by a power law function, and found that the power exponent of CRADs generated from 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic data for normal gut microbiomes of humans and mice was similar consistently with ∼0.9. A similarly robust power exponent was observed in CRADs of gut microbiomes during dietary interventions and several diseases. However, the power exponent was found to be ∼0.6 in CRADs from gut microbiomes characterized by lower species richness, such as those of human infants and the small intestine of mice. In addition, the CRAD of gut microbiomes of mice treated with antibiotics differed slightly from those of infants and the small intestines of mice. Based on these observations, in addition to data on the spatial distribution of microbes in the digestive tract, we developed a 3-dimensional mathematical model of microbial proliferation that reproduced the experimentally observed CRAD patterns. Our model indicated that the CRAD may be determined by the ratio of emerging to pre-existing species during non-uniform spatially competitive proliferation, independent of species composition."
https://openalex.org/W2743789268,"Traffic congestion continues to be a persistent problem throughout the world. As vehicle-to-vehicle communication develops, there is an opportunity of using cooperation among close proximity vehicles to tackle the congestion problem. The intuition is that if vehicles could cooperate opportunistically when they come close enough to each other, they could, in effect, spread themselves out among alternative routes so that vehicles do not all jam up on the same roads. Our previous work proposed a decentralized multiagent based vehicular congestion management algorithm entitled Congestion Avoidance and Route Allocation using Virtual Agent Negotiation (CARAVAN), wherein the vehicles acting as intelligent agents perform cooperative route allocation using inter-vehicular communication. This paper focuses on evaluating the practical applicability of this approach by testing its robustness and performance (in terms of travel time reduction), across variations in: (a) environmental parameters such as road network topology and configuration; (b) algorithmic parameters such as vehicle agent preferences and route cost/preference multipliers; and (c) agent-related parameters such as equipped/non-equipped vehicles and compliant/non-compliant agents. Overall, the results demonstrate the adaptability and robustness of the decentralized cooperative vehicles approach to providing global travel time reduction using simple local coordination strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2743552787,"Lymphadenopathy continues to be a common problem to radiologists and treating physicians because of the difficulty in confidently categorizing a node as being benign or malignant using standard diagnostic techniques. The goal of our research was to assess whether magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy contains the necessary information to allow differentiation of benign from malignant lymph nodes in an in-vitro approach using a modern pattern recognition method. Tissue samples from a tissue bank were analyzed on a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. A total of 69 samples were studied. The samples included a wide variety of malignant and benign etiologies. Using 45 samples, we initially created a model which was able to predict if a certain spectrum originates from benign or malignant lymph nodes using a pattern-recognition technique which takes into account the entire magnetic spectrum rather than single peaks alone. The remaining 24 samples were blindly loaded in the model to assess its performance. We obtained an excellent accuracy in differentiating benign and malignant lymphadenopathy using the model. It correctly differentiated as malignant or benign, in a blinded fashion, all of the malignant samples (13 of 13) and 10 out of the 11 benign samples. We thus showed that magnetic spectroscopy is able to differentiate benign from malignant causes of lymphadenopathy. Additional experiments were performed to verify that the differentiating abilities of our model were not due to differential tissue decay in between benign and malignant tissues. If future experiments demonstrate that a similar approach could be executed with standard MR imaging, this technique could be useful as a problem-solving tool when assessing lymphadenopathy in general. Alternatively, our in-vitro technique could also be useful to pathologists faced with indeterminate pathologies of the lymph nodes after validating our results with a larger sample size."

This study further expounds on this problem by presenting a new mathematical formulation, which is based on market economic factors. To determine solutions, a new local search metaheuristic algorithm is investigated which is called the enhanced Best Performance Algorithm (eBPA). eBPA’s results are compared against two well-known local search metaheuristic algorithms; these include Tabu Search and Simulated Annealing. The results show the potential of the eBPA for continuous optimization problems."

https://openalex.org/W2744627997,"A new ovarian near-diploid cell line, OVDM1, was derived from a highly aneuploid serous ovarian metastatic adenocarcinoma. A metastatic tumor was obtained from a 47-year-old Ashkenazi Jewish patient three years after the first surgery removed the primary tumor, both ovaries, and the remaining reproductive organs. OVDM1 was characterized by cell morphology, genotyping, tumorigenic assay, mycoplasma testing, spectral karyotyping (SKY), and molecular profiling of the whole genome by aCGH and gene expression microarray. Targeted sequencing of a panel of cancer-related genes was also performed. Hierarchical clustering of gene expression data clearly confirmed the ovarian origin of the cell line. OVDM1 has a near-diploid karyotype with a low-level aneuploidy, but samples of the original metastatic tumor were grossly aneuploid. A number of single nucleotide variations (SNVs)/mutations were detected in OVDM1 and the metastatic tumor samples. Some of them were cancer-related according to COSMIC and HGMD databases (no founder mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 have been found). A large number of focal copy number alterations (FCNAs) were detected, including homozygous deletions (HDs) targeting WWOX and GATA4. Progression of OVDM1 from early to late passages was accompanied by preservation of the near-diploid status, acquisition of only few additional large chromosomal rearrangements and more than 100 new small FCNAs. Most of newly acquired FCNAs seem to be related to localized but massive DNA fragmentation (chromothripsis-like rearrangements). Newly developed near-diploid OVDM1 cell line offers an opportunity to evaluate tumorigenesis pathways/events in a minor clone of metastatic ovarian adenocarcinoma as well as mechanisms of chromothripsis."
