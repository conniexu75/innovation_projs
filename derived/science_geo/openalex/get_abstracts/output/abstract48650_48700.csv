https://openalex.org/W2008898220,"Recombinant DNA probes were cloned for the areas flanking the breakpoint on chromosome 18 in cells from a patient with acute lymphocytic leukemia of the B-cell type; cells of this line carry the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation. Two of the probes detected DNA rearrangements in approximately 60 percent of the cases of follicular lymphoma screened. In follicular lymphoma, most of the breakpoints in band q21 of chromosome 18 were clustered within a short stretch of DNA, approximately 2.1 kilobases in length. Chromosome 18-specific DNA probes for the areas flanking the breakpoints also detected RNA transcripts 6 kilobases in length in various cell types. The gene coding for these transcript (the bcl-2 gene) seems to be interrupted in most cases of follicular lymphomas carrying the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation."

https://openalex.org/W1983818310,"Monoclonal antibodies specific for monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and MAO B, respectively, were used to localize these enzymes in primate brain. The reagents recognized different populations of neurons: those that recognized MAO A were located in cell groups containing catecholamines, including the substantia nigra, nucleus locus coeruleus, nucleus subcoeruleus, and the periventricular region of the hypothalamus, whereas those that recognized MAO B were observed in serotonin regions, including the nucleus raphe dorsalis and nucleus centralis superior. These data illustrate the physiological independence of MAO A and B and show that neurons may be specialized for their degradative as well as their synthetic functions."

In addition to its expected granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating activity, the recombinant GM-CSF had burst-promoting activity for erythroid burst-forming units and also stimulated colonies derived from multipotent (mixed) progenitors. In contrast, recombinant erythroid-potentiating activity did not stimulate erythroid progenitors. The experiments prove that human GM-CSF has multilineage colony-stimulating activity."
https://openalex.org/W2025935390,"In addition to the α and β chains of the MHC class II restricted antigen receptor, monoclonal anti-receptor antibodies coprecipitate four polypeptides that appear to be noncovalently associated with the α-β dimer of murine T cells. Included in the murine T cell antigen receptor complex are two glycoproteins of 25 kd (γ) and 21 kd (δ) and two nonglycosylated polypeptides of 26 kd (ε) and 16 kd (ζ). The ε chain appears to possess an intrachain disulfide bond and ζ exists in the complex as a disulfide-linked homodimer. The δ chain is phosphorylated on a serine residue in response to T cell activation with antigen. In contrast, both δ and ε are phosphorylated in response to treatment of the T cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. These polypeptides may play a role in the transduction of the signal(s) in T cell activation."
https://openalex.org/W1591446606,"Cytolytic granules from a T-cell line with specific cytolytic activity were isolated. Granules were solubilized and fractionated on a TSK 4000 gel filtration column. Lytic activity was eluted as a single retarded peak. Polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate indicated that the lytic fractions contained a single protein (perforin) with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 66 kDa. It separated well from the other proteins present in the granules. Isolated perforin polymerized and inserted into lipid bilayers in the presence of Ca2+, forming tubular structures with inner diameters varying from 6 to 16 nm. Lipid insertion of perforin was demonstrated using a membrane-restricted, photoactivatable probe. The lytic properties of perforin suggest an important role of this particular protein during cytolytic T-cell-mediated target cell lysis."
https://openalex.org/W1554746479,"Myoinositol trisphosphate (IP3) is formed when phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) is hydrolyzed by phospholipase C. At micromolar concentrations, IP3 is a stimulus for Ca2+ release in both platelet membranes and various permeabilized cells. We have utilized a combination of ion exchange and capillary gas chromatography to quantitate the mass of IP3 produced by human platelets stimulated by thrombin. Accumulations of IP3 are transient and detectable within 5 s of exposure to thrombin. Within 15 s, thrombin (1 unit/ml) promotes the formation of 134 pmol of IP3/10(9) platelets, the equivalent of an intracellular concentration of 13.4 microM. Incubation of platelets with a stimulus for protein kinase C, 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate, prior to the addition of thrombin impairs the hydrolysis of PIP2 and the increase in IP3, with 50% inhibition occurring at 60 nM TPA. We conclude that platelets produce sufficient quantities of IP3 to cause Ca2+ release from membrane stores. TPA inhibits the activation of phospholipase C and consequently the generation of IP3. The decreased accumulation of IP3 in platelets exposed to TPA may account for the inhibited rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+ which has been observed in such platelets."
https://openalex.org/W1530488971,"In isolated rat hepatocytes, ATP and ADP (10(-6) M) rapidly mobilize intracellular Ca2+ and increase the concentration of free cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) within 1-2 s. The increase in [Ca2+]i is maximal (2.5- to 3-fold) by about 10 s and is dose-dependent, with ATP and ADP being half-maximally effective at 8 X 10(-7) and 3 X 10(-7) M, respectively. At submaximal concentrations, the rise in [Ca2+]i is transient due to hydrolysis of the agonist. The increase in [Ca2+]i in response to ATP or ADP can be potentiated by low concentrations of glucagon (10(-9) M). In addition, the [Ca2+]i rise can be antagonized in a time- and dose-dependent manner by the tumor promoter 4 beta-phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate. Adenosine, at concentrations as high as 10(-4) M, does not alter [Ca2+]i. AMP is ineffective at 10(-5) M, but at 10(-4) M it increases [Ca2+]i approximately 1.5-fold after a 30-s lag and at a slow rate. Conversely, high concentrations (10(-4) M) of adenosine and AMP increases cell cAMP about 2- to 3-fold. ATP and ADP, at concentrations (10(-6) M) which near-maximally increase [Ca2+]i, do not affect hepatocyte cAMP. ATP and ADP increase the cellular level of myoinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), the putative second messenger for Ca2+ mobilization. The increase in IP3 is dose-dependent and precedes or is coincident with the [Ca2+]i rise. There is an approximate 20% increase in IP3 with concentrations of ATP or ADP which near-maximally induce other physiological responses. It is concluded that submicromolar concentrations of ATP and ADP mobilize intracellular Ca2+ and activate phosphorylase in hepatocytes due to generation of IP3. These effects may involve P2-purinergic receptors. In contrast adenosine and AMP interact with P1 (A2)-purinergic receptors to increase cAMP."

https://openalex.org/W2159728393,"Production of a growth factor by a cell that responds to this factor has been termed ""autocrine"" stimulation of proliferation. Considerable experimental data have suggested that tumor cells often exhibit autocrine growth stimulation and that this may contribute to the process of malignant transformation. To experimentally approach the relationship of autocrine growth stimulation to the malignant transformation of hemopoietic cells, we have used a retroviral vector to express sequences encoding a hemopoietic growth factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in a factor-dependent murine cell line (FDC-P1). Virally infected cells synthesized and secreted GM-CSF, grew independently of exogenous CSF, and--unlike the parental FDC-P1 cells--produced tumors in syngeneic mice. We have thus experimentally induced autocrine growth regulation in a factor-dependent hemopoietic cell line and have shown that this results in tumorigenicity."
https://openalex.org/W1577210936,"The complete amino acid sequence of bovine bone matrix Gla protein (MGP) was determined by automatic sequence analysis of the intact protein and of peptides isolated from tryptic and BNPS-skatole digests. This 79-residue, vitamin K-dependent protein contains a single disulfide bond and 4.8 gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residues, one each at positions 37, 41, 48, and 52, and 0.8 Gla and 0.2 Glu at position 2. There is sufficient sequence homology between MGP and bone Gla protein (BGP) to indicate that these two bovine bone proteins arose by gene duplication and subsequent divergent evolution. Although MGP has a very low solubility in water compared to BGP, there is no hydrophobic domain in MGP which could account for its insolubility, and the overall fraction of hydrophobic residues is 32% for MGP compared to 43% for BGP. MGP is the first vitamin K-dependent protein to be discovered which has several non-gamma-carboxylated residues to the NH2-terminal side of its Gla residues. The presence of NH2-terminal Glu residues between the putative targeting domain for the gamma-carboxylase in the MGP leader sequence and the mid-molecule Gla residues suggests that the gamma-carboxylase may have additional, as yet unrecognized, specificity requirements which determine the susceptibility of Glu residues for gamma-carboxylation."

https://openalex.org/W1492298052,"The hormonal regulation of the sexually differentiated cytochrome P-450 isozyme which catalyzes 16 alpha-hydroxylation of testosterone and 4-androstene-3,17-dione in male rat liver (P-450(16) alpha) was investigated. Estradiol valerate injection of male rats caused a decrease in P-450(16) alpha levels to almost the female level, while methyltrienolone injection had the reverse effect in female animals. Hypophysectomy abolished the sex difference in P-450(16) alpha levels. Human growth hormone infusion into male rats, mimicking the female pattern of growth hormone secretion, caused a feminization of P-450(16) alpha levels. The same effect was also seen in hypophysectomized rats of both sexes. In contrast, a different administration schedule involving 12 h injections of human growth hormone, mimicking the male pattern of growth hormone secretion, caused a masculinization of P-450(16) alpha levels in hypophysectomized rats, at a daily dose which causes feminization when given by infusion. Thus, the level of expression of P-450(16) alpha in the liver is dependent on the temporal pattern of blood growth hormone levels. While infusion of rat growth hormone into male rats also feminized the P-450(16) alpha levels, infusion of ovine prolactin had no effect. Ontogenic studies showed that the developmental pattern of P-450(16) alpha expression in the liver coincided with the known pattern of development of the sexual differentiation of hepatic steroid 16 alpha-hydroxylase activity and of the diurnal pattern of growth hormone secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2081132215,"The excised introns of pre-mRNAs and intron-containing splicing intermediates are in a lariat configuration in which the 5' end of the intron is linked by a 2'-5' phosphodiester bond (RNA branch) to a single adenosine residue near the 3' end of the intron. To determine the role of the specific sequence surrounding the RNA branch, we have mutated the branch point sequence of the human beta-globin IVS1. Pre-mRNAs lacking the authentic branch point sequence are accurately spliced in vitro; processing of the mutant pre-mRNAs generates RNA lariats due to the activation of cryptic branch points within IVS1. The cryptic branch points always occur at adenosine residues, but the sequences surrounding the branched nucleotide vary. Regardless of the type of mutation or the sequences remaining within IVS1, the cryptic branch points are 22 to 37 nucleotides upstream of the 3' splice site. These results suggest that RNA branch point selection is primarily based on a mechanism that measures the distance from the 3' splice site."
https://openalex.org/W2052513354,"We have studied the interaction of purified FLP protein with restriction fragments from the substrate 2mu circle DNA of yeast. We find that FLP protects about 50 bp of DNA from nonspecific nuclease digestion. The protected site consists of two 13 bp inverted repeat sequences separated by an 8 bp spacer region. A third 13 bp element is also protected by binding of the FLP protein. We demonstrate that FLP introduces single- and double-strand breaks into the substrate DNA. This site-specific cleavage occurs at the margins of the spacer region, generating 8 bp 5' protruding ends with 5'-OH and 3'-protein-bound termini. Binding to mutant sites and half-sites demonstrates that the third symmetry element is not important for binding and cleavage by the FLP protein. The integrity of the core region is important for the cleavage activity of FLP."

https://openalex.org/W1996035822,"Fifteen independently isolated complementary DNA clones that contain T-cell receptor (TCR) V beta genes were sequenced and found to represent 11 different V beta genes. When compared with known sequences, 14 different V beta genes could be defined from a total of 25 complementary DNA's; 11 clones therefore involved repeated usage of previously identified V beta's. Based on these data, we calculate a maximum likelihood estimate of the number of expressed germline V beta genes to be 18 with an upper 95 percent confidence bound of 30 genes. Southern blot analysis has shown that most of these genes belong to single element subfamilies which show very limited interstrain polymorphism. The TCR beta-chain diversity appears to be generated from a limited V beta gene pool primarily by extensive variability at the variable-diversity-joining (V-D-J) junctional site, with no evidence for the involvement of somatic hypermutation."
https://openalex.org/W1523136087,"A human liver cDNA library was screened by colony hybridization with two mixtures of synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides as probes. These oligonucleotides encoded regions of beta-factor XIIa as predicted from the amino acid sequence. Four positive clones were isolated that contained DNA coding for most of factor XII mRNA. DNA sequence analysis of these overlapping clones showed that they contained DNA coding for part of an amino-terminal extension, the complete amino acid sequence of plasma factor XII, a TGA stop codon, a 3' untranslated region of 150 nucleotides, and a poly(A)+ tail. The cDNA sequence predicts that plasma factor XII consists of 596 amino acid residues. Within the predicted amino acid sequence of factor XII, we have identified three peptide bonds that are cleaved by kallikrein during the formation of beta-factor XIIa. Comparison of the structure of factor XII with other proteins revealed extensive sequence identity with regions of tissue-type plasminogen activator (the epidermal growth factor-like region and the kringle region) and fibronectin (type I and type II homologies). As the type II region of fibronectin contains a collagen-binding site, the homologous region in factor XII may be responsible for the binding of factor XII to collagen. The carboxyl-terminal region of factor XII shares considerable amino acid sequence homology with other serine proteases including trypsin and many clotting factors. A preliminary structural model of beta-factor XIIa is proposed based on the known high resolution x-ray diffraction structures of trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase."
https://openalex.org/W1523034041,"The steady-state relationship between the activation state of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (A-kinase) and lipolysis has been defined quantitatively. A-kinase activation was assessed by measuring the ( +/- cAMP) activity ratio in adipocyte extracts, and lipolysis was determined by measuring glycerol release from cells. Both processes were stimulated either by incubating cells in a ligand-free environment achieved with adenosine deaminase or by addition of lipolytic hormones. A response spectrum was obtained with a variety of adenylate cyclase stimulators and inhibitors, both receptor- and nonreceptor-mediated. Regardless of the ligands used to manipulate adipocyte activity, lipolysis varied from nil to maximal as the A-kinase activity ratio varied from approximately 0.05 to 0.3-0.35. These data provide a quantitative description of the steady-state relationship between A-kinase activity and lipolysis and indicate that the various lipolytic and antilipolytic agents tested act on the lipolytic process exclusively by altering adenylate cyclase activity and, thus, cellular cAMP concentrations. The data reveal also that transient peaking of cAMP, as measured by A-kinase activity ratios, is not an inherent feature of adipocyte metabolism. Moreover, the concentration requirements for lipolytic hormone action are critically dependent on the ambient concentration of antilipolytic agents, and t concentration requirements for antilipolytic agents are dependent on the extent to which cells are stimulated. The data in this paper provide the basis for assessing the relationship between A-kinase activity ratio and lipolysis in the presence of insulin (Londos, C., Honnor, R. C., and Dhillon, G. S. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 15139-15145)."
https://openalex.org/W2062832392,"Mouse lymphoma cells were hybridized with two human acute T-cell leukemias with a t(11;14) (p13;q11) translocation and the segregated hybrids were examined for the presence of the DNA segments coding for the constant (C) and the variable (V) regions of the alpha chain (C alpha and V alpha) of the T-cell receptor. The C alpha segment was translocated to the involved chromosome 11 (11p+) while the V alpha segment remained on the involved chromosome 14 (14q-). The data indicate that the locus for the alpha chain of the T-cell receptor is split by the chromosomal breakpoint between the V alpha and the C alpha gene segments, and that the V alpha segments are proximal to the C alpha segment within chromosome band 14q11.2."
https://openalex.org/W1509406829,"We have recently shown that both lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) induce differentiation in the transformed murine pre-B lymphocyte cell line 70Z/3 by enhancing Na+-H+ exchange across the plasma membrane through an amiloride-sensitive transport system (Rosoff, P.M., Stein, L.F., and Cantley, L.C. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 7056-7060). These data suggested that the activation of protein kinase C indirectly by LPS and directly by TPA was the critical step in the initiation of differentiation in these cells. We extend these observations to show that LPS rapidly stimulates an increase in phosphatidylinositol turnover, leading to a rise in the levels of diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and a concomitant decrease in the amount of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. There is also a rapid elevation of intracellular free [Ca2+] which is independent of the presence of extracellular Ca2+ or Na+. These results suggest that the increase in cytosolic [Ca2+] is due to release of cation from internal stores. TPA, which also causes differentiation in these cells, and the synthetic diacylglycerol, 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol, have opposite effects from LPS on both phosphatidylinositol turnover and cellular Ca+ mobilization. These data suggest that protein kinase C inhibits the activity of phospholipase C. Thus protein kinase C plays a pivotal role in the regulation of mitogen-induced differentiation in these cells by both transducing a positive stimulus to the Na+-H+ exchange system as well as feedback regulating its own stimulatory pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1549133799,"The immunosuppressive agent, cyclosporine, has been found to augment receptor-stimulated calcium fluxes in isolated hepatocytes. After treatment of Quin 2-loaded hepatocytes with cyclosporine, both the amplitude and duration of the vasopressin-induced rise in the cytosolic free Ca2+ are increased. These effects are dependent upon the concentration and time of exposure of the cells to cyclosporine. Cyclosporine increases both 45Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane and the cellular calcium content. The total cellular magnesium, sodium, and potassium contents are not affected by cyclosporine. However, cyclosporine treatment, per se, has no apparent effect on the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration as assayed by Quin 2 fluorescence. The increase in total cell calcium is associated with progressive increases in the calcium content of the endoplasmic reticular and mitochondrial calcium pools. The vasopressin-induced net efflux of Ca2+ from hepatocytes was 2-fold greater after treatment with 10 micrograms/ml cyclosporine for 10 min, but the lag time prior to the onset of Ca2+ efflux was not affected. These results are interpreted on the basis of cyclosporine having a primary effect on increasing the permeability of the plasma membrane to Ca2+, thereby leading to an increase of the calcium content of the hormone-sensitive intracellular calcium pool."
https://openalex.org/W1547258496,"A modified procedure for the purification of the colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) in mouse L-cell-conditioned medium is used to isolate two forms of CSF, which are separable by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography with 300-A pore size supports. The specific biological activity of these CSFs (2 X 10(9) colonies/mg) was considerably higher than has been achieved by other methods. Even at high concentration (200 pM) both molecules stimulated predominantly more macrophage than granulocyte colonies; however, the less hydrophobic form appeared to stimulate the formation of more pure granulocytic colonies. Almost twice as much of the less hydrophobic CSF was recovered from L-cell-conditioned medium. Analysis using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that both forms of L-cell CSF had apparent molecular masses of approximately 70,000 daltons. However, on reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol, while both forms generated a 39,000-dalton subunit, the less hydrophobic form also yielded a 32,000-dalton subunit. Storage of either form of L-cell CSF at pH 2.1, in the presence of acetonitrile or isopropanol, destroyed the biological activity. Electrophoretic analysis of the L-cell CSFs stored under these conditions indicated that this was associated with a spontaneous dissociation of the CSF dimer into the inactive subunits. There was some charge heterogeneity (pI 3.5-4.7) indicating different degrees of glycosylation. The unique N-terminal amino acid sequences of both forms of CSF were the same: (Lys-Glu-Val-Ser-Glu-His-X-Ser-His-Met-Ile-Gly-Asn). Thus, the polypeptide chains appear to be identical for the subunits of both forms of L-cell CSF."
https://openalex.org/W1553596150,"A crude extract from Mycobacterium tuberculosis var. bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guerin was previously shown to incorporate methylmalonyl-CoA into mycocerosic acids, exemplified by 2,4,6,8-tetramethyloctacosanoic acid, and malonyl-CoA into n-fatty acids (Rainwater D. L., and Kolattukudy, P. E. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 2979-2985). The presence of several fatty acid synthases with differences in substrate preference and product chain length was detected in the crude extract of M. tuberculosis var. bovis. Among them was a mycocerosic acid synthase which was purified to homogeneity using anion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration, affinity chromatography, and hydroxylapatite chromatography. This fatty acid synthase elongated long-chain fatty acyl-CoA primers using methylmalonyl-CoA and NADPH to produce multimethyl-branched mycocerosic acids. The enzyme was specific for methylmalonyl-CoA and would not incorporate malonyl-CoA into fatty acids. It elongated n-C6 to n-C20 CoA esters to generate primarily the corresponding tetramethyl-branched mycocerosic acids. Exogenous [1-14C]acyl-CoA and trideuteromethylmalonyl-CoA were incorporated into the multimethyl-branched fatty acids. Dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis showed that the enzyme had a molecular weight of 238,000, whereas gel filtration showed a native molecular weight of 490,000, indicating that the enzyme is composed of two monomers of identical molecular weight. The enzyme contained an acyl carrier protein-like segment as indicated by incorporation of [1-14C] pantothenate into the 238-kDa protein and production of 1 mol of taurine/mol of the monomer upon hydrolysis of performic acid-oxidized enzyme. It is concluded that the mycocerosic acid synthase is a multifunctional enzyme similar to the well-characterized multifunctional fatty acid synthases except for the substrate specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1501977647,"We have investigated the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated tyrosine-specific protein kinase activity in quiescent cultures of diploid human fibroblasts that have a well characterized mitogenic response to EGF. We developed a method of permeabilizing cells with digitonin or other agents that permitted the rapid labeling of cellular proteins with exogenously added [gamma-32P]ATP while allowing only about 25% of marker cytosolic enzymes to escape from the cells. When phosphatases were inhibited with zinc and vanadate, EGF induced up to 8-fold stimulation of the incorporation of radioactivity from [gamma-32P]ATP into a 35-kDa band on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels. Alkali treatment of gels showed that EGF stimulated the phosphorylation of bands with apparent molecular masses of 170, 45, 35, 26, 22, and 21 kDa. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed on the 170- and 35-kDa bands and revealed that the EGF-stimulated phosphorylation was on tyrosyl residues. The 35-kDa band was resolved into four spots by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The most acidic form was the most prominent and it was precipitated by an antiserum against a 35-kDa protein from A-431 cells; heretofore, this protein has only been reported to be phosphorylated in an EGF-dependent manner by A-431 membranes in vitro (Fava, R. A., and Cohen, S. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 2636-2645). This antiserum also precipitated a 35-kDa phospho-protein from extracts of intact [32P]orthophosphate-labeled fibroblasts which was phosphorylated on tyrosine in an EGF-dependent manner. None of the forms of the 35-kDa phosphoproteins labeled in permeabilized cells were immunologically related to the 34-kDa protein that is a substrate for the tyrosyl kinase encoded by Rous sarcoma virus. Other mitogens (serum, insulin, platelet-derived growth factor, and thrombin) did not detectably stimulate phosphorylation in permeabilized cells."
https://openalex.org/W1538221375,"The R3327H-G8-A1 cell line derived from the Dunning rat prostate adenocarcinoma contains both androgen and glucocorticoid receptors. Following steroid deprivation, androgens specifically increase the concentration of their receptors in these cells by approximately 2-fold within 6 h and 3-4-fold in 24 h. In the presence of potent glucocorticoids, androgen receptor augmentation is reduced by 40-50% in the first 6 h and completely inhibited during the subsequent 24 h. This event, which is specific for glucocorticoids, appears to be due to an inhibition of androgen receptor synthesis. Furthermore, glucocorticoids inhibit proliferation of these cells by inhibiting the release of growth factors and arresting them in the G0 or A state of the cell cycle. This inhibition can be overcome by addition of low concentrations of either epidermal growth factor or platelet-derived growth factor; however, the inhibitory effect of the glucocorticoid on androgen receptor augmentation is not released. These results suggest that glucocorticoids arrest cellular proliferation by altering the autoregulation of growth and that this event is not dependent upon inhibition of androgen receptor augmentation."

Highly increased production of saframycin A and prolongation of the maximum production period of saframycin A were attained by constant pH control of the culture and by addition of chloramphenicol to the culture. The biosynthetic origin of the quinone skeleton common to the saframycin group was confirmed to be two tyrosine molecules which condense to generate the basic ring system of saframycin A. Feeding experiments with [1-13C]tyrosine showed specific labeling of C-11 and C-21 carbons of saframycin A, and the enrichment of the carbons was 40-fold over natural abundance. Two O- and two C-methyl and one N-methyl carbons arose directly from methionine, and alanine and glycine were the precursors for the pyruvoyl amide side chain of saframycin A."

https://openalex.org/W1639365248,"The effect of ascorbic acid on the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine was investigated in isolated chromaffin granules from bovine adrenal medulla. Ascorbic acid was shown to double the rate of [3H]norepinephrine formation from [3H]dopamine, despite no demonstrable accumulation of ascorbic acid into chromaffin granules. The enhancement of norepinephrine biosynthesis by ascorbic acid was dependent on the external concentrations of dopamine and ascorbate. The apparent Km of the dopamine beta-hydroxylation system for external dopamine was approximately 20 microM in the presence or absence of ascorbic acid. However, the apparent maximum velocity of norepinephrine formation was nearly doubled in the presence of ascorbic acid. By contrast, the apparent Km and Vmax of dopamine uptake into chromaffin granules were not affected by ascorbic acid. Norepinephrine formation was increased by ascorbic acid when the concentration of ascorbate was 200 microM or higher; a concentration of 2 mM appeared to induce the maximal effect under the experimental conditions used here. The effect of ascorbic acid on conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine required Mg-ATP-dependent dopamine uptake into chromaffin granules. In contrast to ascorbic acid, other reducing agents such as NADH, glutathione, and homocysteine were unable to enhance norepinephrine biosynthesis. These data suggest that ascorbic acid provides reducing equivalents for hydroxylation of dopamine despite the lack of ascorbate accumulation into chromaffin granules. These findings imply the functional existence of an electron carrier system in the chromaffin granule which transfers electrons from external ascorbic acid for subsequent intragranular norepinephrine biosynthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1556366790,"During the initiation of intrinsic coagulation factors XI and XIa interact intimately with several other coagulation proteins (factor XIIa, high Mr kininogen, and factor IX) as well as with the platelet surface. To help elucidate these complex intramolecular interactions, we have prepared a collection of monoclonal antibodies directed against various epitopes in factor XI. We have utilized these reagents to isolate factor XI and the light chain of factor XIa on affinity columns, and to probe structure-function relationships involved in the interactions of factor XIa with factor IX. The isolated light chain of factor XIa retained greater than 90% of its amidolytic activity against the oligopeptide substrate pyro-Glu-Pro-Arg-pNA (S-2366), but only 3.8% of its clotting activity in a factor XIa assay and 1% of its factor IX activating activity in an activation peptide release assay. This suggests that regions of the heavy chain are required for development of coagulant activity and specifically for the interaction of factor XIa with factor IX. To test this hypothesis, the effects of three of the monoclonal antibodies (5F4, 1F1, and 3C1) on the function of factor XIa were examined. The results show that in a clotting assay the light chain-specific antibody (5F4) inhibits 100% of the factor XIa activity, whereas of the heavy chain-specific antibodies, one (3C1) inhibits 75% and another (1F1) only 17%. Similarly in the factor IX activation peptide release assay, antibody 5F4 inhibits 100% of the factor XIa activity, whereas 3C1 inhibits 75% and 1F1 inhibits 33%. We conclude that regions located in the heavy chain, in addition to those in the light chain, are involved in the interaction of factor XIa with factor IX and in the expression of the coagulant activity of factor XI."

https://openalex.org/W1661585479,"A biosynthetic precursor to rat bone gamma-carboxyglutamic acid protein (BGP) was isolated from warfarin-treated ROS 17/2 osteosarcoma cells by antibody affinity chromatography followed by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. Thirty-two residues of its NH2-terminal sequence were determined by gas-phase protein sequence analysis. Comparison of this sequence with the known structure of rat BGP established that the intracellular precursor is a 76-residue molecule of Mr = 9120 that differs from 6000-Da bone BGP in having an NH2-terminal extension of 26 residues. This precursor appears to be generated from the primary translation product by cleavage of a hydrophobic signal peptide and is the probable substrate for gamma-carboxylation by virtue of its accumulation in the presence of warfarin. The putative targeting region for gamma-carboxylation previously identified in the leader sequences of vitamin K-dependent proteins is found in the propeptide portion of the precursor. Since the immunoreactive component secreted by warfarin-treated cells is identical in sequence to the 6000-Da BGP from bone, propeptide cleavage from the precursor is independent of gamma-carboxylation and precedes secretion of BGP from the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1503159803,"Fifteen peptides corresponding in sequence to segments of the major phenobarbital-inducible forms of rat hepatic cytochrome P-450 (termed P-450 PB-4 and P-450 PB-5) were chemically synthesized, conjugated to carrier proteins, and used to prepare site-specific rabbit and/or mouse antipeptide antibodies. Four of the synthetic peptides were recognized by rabbit heterosera raised against purified P-450 PB-4. The titer of these heterosera measured against P-450 PB-4 was only partially reduced upon complete adsorption of antipeptide activity suggesting that these peptides represent minor antigenic determinants. Each of the antipeptide antibodies recognized purified P-450 PB-4 and the highly homologous P-450 PB-5 as demonstrated by a solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Although each antipeptide immunoprecipitated both purified 125I-labeled P-450 PB-4 and also in vitro-synthesized apo-P-450 PB-4, the yields of immunoprecipitation were low relative to that obtained using anti-P-450 heterosera. Only one of the antipeptide antibodies gave a good signal in an immunoblot analysis of either microsomal or purified P-450s PB-4 and PB-5. Three antipeptide antibodies raised against hydrophilic segments located in the amino-terminal one-third of P-450 PB-4 markedly inhibited the P-450 PB-4-catalyzed O-deethylation of the model substrate 7-ethoxycoumarin. Four of the antipeptide antibodies were found to cross-react with P-450 beta NF-B, the major aromatic hydrocarbon-inducible rat hepatic P-450, suggesting that certain amino acid sequences or regions of secondary structure are conserved between the major phenobarbital-induced and polycyclic-induced rat liver P-450 isoenzymes. These studies demonstrate the utility of antipeptide antibodies for evaluation of antigenic sites exposed in native P-450 PB-4, for identification of specific amino acid sequences important for the interaction of P-450 PB-4 with its substrate and/or with cytochrome P-450 reductase in a reconstituted system and for elucidation of structural and immunochemical homologies between P-450 PB-4 and other P-450 isoenzymes present in rat liver endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1547953895,"In order to study the initial as well as the final steps in the aromatization of androgens to estrogens, high-specific activity [19-C3H3]androstenedione and testosterone were synthesized. Incubations of [19-C3H3]androstenedione with human placental microsomes resulted in the generation of [3H]water, as a result of the dual hydroxylation at C-19, and [3H]formic acid reflecting final aromatization. After an initial lag in the production of [3H]formic acid, the two radiolabeled products were formed linearly with time at a ratio of 2 to 1 under subsaturating conditions and 2.2 to 1 when saturating levels of substrate were present. Incubation of a mixture of [19-C3H3]- and [4-14C]androstenedione with human placental microsomes yielded 19-hydroxy- and 19-oxoandrostenedione, respectively, products of one and two hydroxylations at C-19. The isotope ratios of these derivatives revealed the presence of a tritium isotope effect in the first but not in the second hydroxylation at that site. When [19-C3H2]- and [4-14C]19-hydroxyandrostenedione were used as the substrate, the isotope ratio of the isolated 19-oxoandrostenedione showed no evidence of any isotope effect in its formation. Thus, the second hydroxylation at C-19 exhibits no isotope effect irrespective of whether androstenedione or 19-hydroxyandrostenedione are the substrates, and therefore, a concerted process and catalytic commitment are not responsible for the difference in isotope effects between the first and second C-19 hydroxylation by the placental aromatase complex. Radiometric kinetic analysis employing [19-C3H3]- and [1 beta,2 beta-3H]androstenedione as the comparative substrates provided evidence that the isotope effect is exerted solely through the Vmax component of the reaction. The distinction between the successive hydroxylations at C-19 in the aromatization sequence suggests, but does not prove, that different mechanisms, and hence different catalytic sites, may be involved in these steps."
https://openalex.org/W1519938828,"We previously reported the activation of adenylate cyclases from rat brain (Johnson, R. A., Awad, J. A., Jakobs, K. H., and Schultz, G., (1983) FEBS Lett. 152, 11-16) and from human platelets (Jakobs, K. H., Johnson, R. A., and Schultz, G. (1983) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 756, 369-375) by a factor derived from bovine sperm. In this report we describe the conditions for the extraction of the factor from bovine sperm and characteristics of its effects on adenylate cyclase which are consistent with its being a protease. The activating capacity of sperm particles was extracted from previously washed and frozen sperm into a 30,000 X g supernatant fraction by various salts, but not by the nonionic detergent Lubrol-PX. The amount of extracted factor: (a) was greatest with NH4HCO3 greater than NaCl greater than Na acetate; (b) was optimal with 0.5 M salt; (c) was not appreciably affected by the pH of the extraction buffer between pH 5.0 and 8.5; and (d) exhibited the greatest specific activity at the lower pH. The extracted sperm factor could be concentrated without loss by ultrafiltration on Amicon PM-10 membranes. The effect on adenylate cyclase of concentrated and desalted sperm extracted was inhibited 50% by various salts at 10 to 30 mM. The effects of the sperm factor to activate platelet adenylate cyclase, to block its inhibition via the alpha-adrenoceptor, and to block inhibition of stimulated forms of the enzyme by stable guanine nucleotides were prevented by protease inhibitors. A 50% reduction in the sperm factor's activation of platelet adenylate cyclase was caused by 30 nM soybean trypsin inhibitor, 30 nM alpha 2-macroglobulin, 300 nM leupeptin, 1 microM antipain, 15 microM aprotinin, and 100 microM benzamidine. Up to 3 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride was without effect on activation of the platelet cyclase by the sperm factor. The effects of the sperm factor persisted after its removal by the washing of pretreated platelet membranes and after its inactivation by the subsequent addition of leupeptin. The data strongly support the conclusion that the bovine sperm factor is a trypsin-like protease. alpha-Chymotrypsin, trypsin, and sperm acrosin were comparably effective in stimulating the platelet adenylate cyclase 5- to 8-fold, with concentrations eliciting maximal stimulation being: 200 ng trypsin/ml; 2 micrograms alpha-chymotrypsin/ml; and 2 micrograms acrosin/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1565543862,"Formation of D-loops during the exchange of strands between a circular single-stranded DNA and a completely homologous linear duplex proceeds optimally when the duplex DNA is added to the complex of recA protein and single-stranded DNA formed in the presence of single-stranded DNA-binding protein and ATP. D-loops are undetectable when 200 microM adenosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) is substituted for ATP. D-loops can be formed in the presence of adenosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) if recA protein is the last component added to the reaction. However, these D-loops, which depend upon homologous sequences, are unstable upon deproteinization and are formed to a more limited extent than the structures formed with ATP. This finding indicates that D-loops formed under these conditions may be largely nonintertwined paranemic structures rather than plectonemic structures in which two of the strands are interwoven. When adenosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) is added to an ongoing reaction containing ATP, formation of plectonemic structures and ATP hydrolysis is inhibited to an equivalent extent. We, therefore, conclude that ATP hydrolysis is required for the formation of plectonemic structures."
https://openalex.org/W1592985462,"The transit time of newly synthesized transferrin in the liver is markedly longer than that of albumin. We sought to learn the basis of this difference by the use of labeled leucine and mannose in vivo and by isolation of newly formed transferrin from rough microsomes of rat liver. Albumin and alpha 1-antitrypsin, a second glycoprotein, were also studied for comparison. Minimal hepatic transit times were 17, 23, and 31 min for albumin, alpha 1-antitrypsin, and transferrin, respectively. The delay in the case of transferrin was found to occur chiefly in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and to be paralleled by an increase in the amount of transferrin relative to albumin in that organelle. Initial glycosylation of transferrin was as rapid as that of alpha 1-antitrypsin, and essentially all of the transferrin in the rough endoplasmic reticulum contained glycans which bound to concanavalin A and were removed by endoglycosidase H. Only 3% of the transferrin isolated from the rough microsomes came from the plasma by endocytosis or adsorption. Rapidity of disulfide bond formation in rough microsomes was evident from the presence of only 1.3 cysteine thiols/molecule of rough microsomal transferrin (total of 19 cystines) and the absence of mixed disulfides. Peptide patterns upon mild proteolysis were consistent with a native configuration of disulfide bond pairing. The ability of rough microsomal transferrin to bind and deliver iron through interaction with transferrin receptors on reticulocytes suggests that considerable tertiary structure is present. Thus, initial glycosylation, disulfide bridging, and tertiary folding are all rapid processes. The cause for the slow release of transferrin from the rough endoplasmic reticulum may lie with a rate-limiting transfer mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1535613633,"23Na NMR, in combination with an anionic paramagnetic shift reagent dysprosium bis(tripolyphosphate), has been used to study intracellular Na+ in Rana oocytes, ovulated eggs, and early cleavage embryos. The technique allows accurate and simultaneous determination of both extracellular space and intracellular Na+ concentration. In prophase-arrested, follicle-enclosed oocytes, only about 17% of the total oocyte Na+ (approximately 40 mmol/kg of cells) was NMR-visible. Homogenizing oocytes in 0.24 M sucrose did not significantly affect the 23Na resonance. About 30% of the total oocyte Na+ was associated with the yolk platelets isolated at room temperature by differential centrifugation. NMR analysis, however, did not yield a detectable 23Na signal from these intact platelets. Thus, while yolk platelets are rich in Na+, this Na+ does not contribute to the oocyte 23Na NMR signal. Denuded oocytes, obtained by removing the follicular epithelium, gained about 10 mmol of total Na+/kg of cells and exhibited a comparable increase in NMR-visible Na+, suggesting the existence of compartments with varying degree of NMR visibility within the oocyte. Partially relaxed 23Na Fourier transform NMR spectra revealed the existence of at least two major intracellular compartments of NMR-visible Na+ with different magnetic environments and relaxation behavior in denuded oocytes. Since platelet Na+ appears to be NMR-invisible, one of the two observed compartments may be the nucleus. Progesterone action on the amphibian oocyte caused measurable changes in NMR-visible Na+. By ovulation (second metaphase), there is a gain in total egg Na+, and the NMR-visible Na+ is also increased. Following fertilization, however, there is some loss of total cell Na+ but, by the 2-4 cell stage, about 70% of the total Na+ becomes NMR-visible. These results indicate that a sizable fraction of the Na+ in follicle-enclosed, prophase oocyte is sequestered and located in NMR-invisible compartments and that changes in NMR-visible intracellular Na+ occur following hormonal and developmental stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W1565758675,"The extent of equilibrium perturbation of the DNA helix associated with enzymatic methylation of dA residues has been determined by the agarose gel electrophoresis band-shift method. Utilization of EcoRI methylase under conditions of reduced specificity together with Escherichia coli dam methylase permitted modification of up to 300 dA residues/plasmid pBR322 dimer. A conformational change associated with methylation was observed, with the magnitude of the transition being linear with extent of modification of relaxed DNA circles. The conformational change corresponds to an unwinding of the DNA helix by 0.5 degrees/methyl group transferred to relaxed molecules. The magnitude of the effect was independent of temperature from 5-37 degrees C indicating that it is not the consequence of a thermal transition within this range."
https://openalex.org/W1568603829,"Middle-mode RNA synthesis in T4-infected cells takes place before replication of phage DNA commences. What distinguishes it from early-mode RNA synthesis is that initiation of middle RNA depends on T4-coded proteins, in particular on the mot gene product. mot protein is localized in a DNA-protein complex which forms during the first few minutes of infection. All of the cell's mot protein is bound in this complex, and it continues to be bound long after the synthesis of mot protein has stopped. When we infect Escherichia coli with T4 carrying a temperature-sensitive mutation in the mot gene, we find a correlation between the physiology of this mot mutant and the amount of mot protein bound in the DNA-protein complex. Although there is some host RNA polymerase in the complex, mot protein does not seem to bind to this enzyme. Two other T4-coded proteins, of molecular weights 17,600 and 15,000, are also found in the pre-replicative DNA-protein complex. One of these, p17,600, is coded for by a 750-base pair region located between genes 39 and 56; p17,600 appears to be the recently described motB gene product. The other protein, p15,000, is not an RNA polymerase-binding protein; it is characterized by its strong binding to the DNA-protein complex."
https://openalex.org/W1590965325,"Abstract Nucleoside transport deficiency in mammalian cells is associated with an inability to transport most nucleosides, growth resistance to a spectrum of cytotoxic nucleosides, and a loss of binding sites for 4-nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR), a potent inhibitor of nucleoside transport. The nucleoside transport-deficient S49 T lymphoma cell line, AE1, however, was almost as capable of incorporating thymidine into TTP as the wild type parent provided thymidine was administered at a sufficiently high concentration. Consequently, AE1 cells were just as sensitive as wild type cells to the toxicity of high thymidine concentrations. In contrast, AE1 cells were highly resistant to almost all other cytotoxic nucleosides including the thymidine analogs, 5-bromodeoxyuridine and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-monophosphate. Despite having demonstrable ability to accumulate TTP, AE1 cells were unable to grow on hypoxanthine-amethopterin-thymidine (HAT)-containing medium. This was due to their inability to accumulate sufficient TTP from the low concentrations of thymidine present in HAT medium. AE1 cells possessed an incomplete thymidine transport deficiency, the extent of which was concentration dependent. The residual capacity for thymidine transport present in AE1 cells was insensitive to inhibition by 4-nitrobenzylthioinosine and could account both for their inability to grow on HAT medium and their sensitivity to cytotoxic concentrations of thymidine. Another nucleoside transport-deficient cell line, FURD-80-3-6, was similar to the AE1 cell line in its growth phenotype and NBMPR-binding site deficiency but differed in its decreased growth sensitivity to thymidine. That nucleoside transport deficiencies may vary in their completeness for different nucleosides has significance for the mechanism by which a single transporter can recognize a wide variety of nucleosides."
https://openalex.org/W1922640135,"The reductive activation of a valyl-tRNA synthetase from yeast is strongly inhibited by 1-30 microM unsaturated fatty acids, and the inhibition is antagonized by 10-100 microM saturated fatty acids. Diethylstilbestrol also inhibits the activation. The possibility that unesterified palmitoleic and oleic acids are bona fide regulatory effectors is supported by a dramatic inverse relation between their cellular content and the growth rate of commercial bakers' yeast. An increase in the ratio of unsaturated to saturated acids with slowing growth in a laboratory strain, S288C, also supports the regulatory hypothesis. The free fatty acids are extracted into slightly acidified 50% alcohol together with traces of numerous novel lipophilic substances. One of these is suggested to function as a cofactor in conjunction with a heat-stable polypeptide that activates valyl-tRNA synthetase."
https://openalex.org/W1535296749,"The reaction of the neurotoxin MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) with monoamine oxidase from a variety of tissues including rat and monkey brain, bovine liver, and human placenta and platelets was found to yield, as a primary product, a reactive photosensitive substance with an absorbance maximum at 345 nm which is not the cation 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion previously reported as a monoamine oxidase-MPTP metabolite in vivo and in vitro. Our results suggest that the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-pyridinium ion is probably only generated in subsequent nonenzymatic transformations of this reactive monoamine oxidase metabolite. This substance was found to specifically inactivate the B-form of monoamine oxidase by a photo-induced mechanism and to react directly with NADPH and dopamine. Properties of the metabolite and potential significance of its reactions to MPTP neurotoxicity are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1555889175,"The large change in fluorescence emission of 1-N6-etheno-2-aza-ATP (epsilon-aza-ATP) has been used to investigate the kinetic mechanism of etheno-aza nucleotide binding to bovine cardiac myosin subfragment 1 (myosin-S1) and actomyosin subfragment 1 (actomyosin-S1). The time course of nucleotide fluorescence enhancement observed during epsilon-aza-ATP hydrolysis is qualitatively similar to the time course of tryptophan fluorescence enhancement observed during ATP hydrolysis. In single turnover experiments, the nucleotide fluorescence rapidly increases to a maximum level, then decreases with a rate constant of 0.045 s-1 to a final level, which is about 30% of the maximal enhancement; a similar fluorescence enhancement is obtained by adding epsilon-aza-ADP to cardiac myosin-S1 or actomyosin-S1 under the same conditions (100 mM KCl, 10 mM 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, pH 7.0, 15 degrees C). The kinetic data are consistent with a mechanism in which there are two sequential (acto)myosin-S1 nucleotide complexes with enhanced nucleotide fluorescence following epsilon-aza-ATP binding. The apparent second order rate constants of epsilon-aza-ATP binding to cardiac myosin subfragment 1 and actomyosin subfragment 1 are 2-12 times slower than those for ATP. Actin increases the rate of epsilon-aza-ADP dissociation from bovine cardiac myosin-S1 from 1.9 to 110 s-1 at 15 degrees C which can be compared to 0.3 and 65 s-1 for ADP dissociation under similar conditions. Although there are quantitative differences between the rate and equilibrium constants of epsilon-aza- and adenosine nucleotides to cardiac actomyosin-S1 and myosin-S1, the basic features of the nucleotide binding steps of the mechanism are unchanged."
