https://openalex.org/W1519682167,"Abstract The intranuclear binding of radioactive hormone in prostate after the intravenous administration of testosterone-1,2-3H to rats has been studied. Nuclei obtained by sucrose density gradient centrifugation were extracted with buffer containing 0.6 m NaCl, and the soluble radioactivity was separated into bound and free fractions by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 or G-200. As early as 15 min after testosterone administration, the radioactivity recovered in the bound form was predominantly dihydrotestosterone. By gel filtration of nuclear extracts on Sephadex G-200 and by the use of digestive enzymes, it was shown that dihydrotestosterone was bound to an acidic nuclear protein. Finally, several characteristics of this binding phenomenon were defined; the binding was stable to freezing for as long as 8 days, stable to short term incubation at 20° but not at 37°, and partially stable to repeated gel filtration on Sephadex."
https://openalex.org/W2057250907,"Serial section autoradiograms were prepared of different planes of the hypothalamus and diencephalon of immature female, immature male, and ovariectomized mature rats injected with 6,7-(3)H-estradiol-17 beta. Known causes of diffusion and redistribution of the label, such as fixation, embedding, and thawing, were eliminated by the use of an autoradiographic technique based on the dry-mounting of freeze-dried sections. Neurons that concentrate estradiol exist in distinct and definable anatomical areas that are independent of the sex and hormonal state of the animals. Distribution of these neurons follows known terminations of the stria terminalis, which supports the concept of an endocrine amygdaloid-hypothalamic-hypophysial axis."

https://openalex.org/W2048141756,"Mouse somatic cells lacking thymidine kinase were mixed in culture with human diploid cells lacking hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase, and hybrid cells were isolated and maintained in a selective medium containing hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine. The hybrid cells at the time of isolation had karyotypes consisting predominantly of mouse chromosomes but with one human chromosome, a submetacentric member of group E, apparently giving thymidine kinase to the hybrid cell. However, after long-term propagation in the selective medium this chromosome has been lost, although cells continue to show thymidine kinase activity as demonstrated by the incorporation of (3)H-thy-midine into DNA in the hybrid cell. The hybrid cells have only mouse electro-phoretic variants for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase, suggesting that the human genetic loci for these enzymes are not represented in the hybrid genome and may be unlinked to that for thymidine kinase."

https://openalex.org/W2042157081,"Excised root tips from dark-grown mung bean seedlings (Phaseolus aureus) that adhere to a negatively charged glass surface when irradiated with red light and release when irradiated by far-red light develop a positive bioelectric potential (about 1.0 millivolt) at the tip in red light and a negative bioelectric potential in far-red light. The sign of the bioelectric potential was repeatedly photo-reversible, and the adhesion and release kinetics were similar to those of the development of the bioelectric potentials. Photoconversion of the phytochrome holochrome perhaps changes permeability characteristics of the cell membrane, resulting in an induced localized electrochemical gradient manifested as a bioelectric potential. This supports the view that phytochrome in situ is membrane bound."

The decoction continues to descrease fertility for at least 50 to 60 days after intake is stopped. The decoction did not affect appetite and apparently did not affect the health of adults rats.
https://openalex.org/W2086483470,"Geographic variability in call structure indicates that four largely allopatric populations of leopard frogs are present in the central United States. These forms appear to maintain their distinctness in narrow zones of sympatry, and most adult males can be separated morphologically. It is suggested that the four forms represent distinct species and that the idea of gradual clinal variability in one wide-ranging species is wrong."

https://openalex.org/W1601392683,"Abstract Chromatography on carboxymethyl cellulose and Amberlite IRC-50 was utilized to isolate minor ribonuclease components from bovine pancreatic juice. Two of these components, ribonucleases C and D, were obtained in homogeneous form at yields of 0.48 mg and 0.37 mg, respectively, per g of pooled pancreatic protein, and were detected in three of the four animals examined. Ribonucleases C and D possess amino acid compositions, specific activities, and ultraviolet spectra identical with those of ribonucleases A and B. Analyses for amino sugars indicate 4 residues of glucosamine and 2 residues of N-acetylneuraminic acid bound per molecule of ribonuclease C, and 4 residues of each amino sugar bound per molecule of ribonuclease D. Each glycoprotein also contains mannose, fucose, and galactose. Peptide maps of tryptic digests of reduced, cyanoethylated ribonucleases C and D are identical with those from ribonuclease B and reveal that the carbohydrate is attached to peptide tryptic-11."
https://openalex.org/W2073441166,"Turtles tolerate anoxic anoxia about 14 times longer than stagnant anoxia. In snakes and crocodiles this difference is much less marked. Apparently, the remarkable anaerobic viability of turtles is dependent on blood circulation, Analyses of plasma indicate that loss of brain function in anoxic crocodiles is not caused by systemic acidosis or hypoglycemia. It is suggested that the ability of the central nervous system of the turtle to function without oxygen is due to a comparatively high rate of anaerobic uptake or metabolism of glucose."

https://openalex.org/W1543154469,"Phosvitin undergoes a transition from an unordered conformation to a β structure if the pH of its aqueous solution is lowered sufficiently (1.8 to 1.9) to remove a major part of its negative charge. The characteristic optical rotatory dispersion features of this ordered conformation are ([m′] given in degree × cm2× decimole−1): trough at 230 mµ (−3,000), peak at 203 mµ (+15,000), and a crossover point at 220 mµ. The circular dichroism spectrum ([θ] given in degree × cm2× decimole−1) shows a minimum at 215 mµ (−11,800), a maximum at 194 mµ (+14,600), and a crossover point at 206 mµ. The rate of the transition, but not its extent, is a function of pH and of protein concentration. Salt affects the transition as well. The transition may be reversed nearly completely by an increase in pH if the duration of exposure to low pH is brief. Partial reversal appears to be possible in any case."

https://openalex.org/W1492849509,"Abstract The influence of the peptide group on the quantum yield of phenol and indole has been evaluated from fluorescence measurements on the diketopiperazines of the two chromophores. Strong quenching of both groups occurs in water which is almost completely eliminated in dioxane and dimethyl sulfoxide. Polarization of fluorescence measurements indicate that the diketopiperazines have folded conformations in 95% glycerol solutions. It is suggested that the low yields of tyrosyl and tryptophanyl emission in the native state of proteins may be accounted for, in part, by their interactions with the peptide group."

https://openalex.org/W1590734445,"Abstract Amethopterin has been linked covalently, via a carbodiimide-promoted synthesis, to the aminoethyl derivative of soluble starch. The resulting material (mol wt g 300,000) has been used in a novel procedure for purification of chicken liver dihydrofolate reductase (mol wt 22,000). Amethopterin-aminoethyl starch was admixed with the crude enzyme at pH 6.0 and the resulting high molecular weight, enzyme-inhibitor complex was separated from small molecular weight proteins by filtration through Sephadex G-100. The complex was then dissociated by changing the pH to 8 (in the presence of added dihydrofolate), and the highly purified enzyme was recovered by refiltration through Sephadex."

https://openalex.org/W1594398554,"Abstract Copper-(bis)histidine was selected for study from a number of copper complexes which catalyze the autoxidation of ferrocytochrome c. The apparent first order rate constant was increased some 180 times by a final copper concentration of 4 mm. The reaction was not only first order with respect to time, but also with respect to initial ferrocytochrome c concentration. The dependence on copper-histidine concentration showed first order behavior, and also saturation kinetics for different parts of the concentration range. Where saturation kinetics were applicable the Michaelis constant was 8 x 10-4 m. Increasing the hydrogen ion concentration produced a proportionate increase in the reaction rate. Increasing the ionic strength increased the reaction rate more at pH 4 than at pH 5. Hydrogen peroxide was not detectible among the products of the reaction. Some implications of these data for the mechanism are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1512243535,"Abstract A ferrohemoglobin, horse COHb, titrated with acid and back-titrated with base in the absence of air and with more rapid mixing (⅕ sec) than in earlier work, exhibits much more complex unmasking behavior (prototropic groups) than previously reported for the ferri form, Hb+. The numbers and kinds of groups liberated by exposure to acid depend not only on pH, but on salt concentrations, and on time of exposure as well. Under mild conditions of denaturation, all the groups unmasked appear to be remasked so rapidly at higher pH that a meaningful back titration curve has not been obtained. With more severe treatment, regeneration and remasking are manageably slower, and it is clear that masked basic groups, including (but not solely) imidazoles, appear. Loss of α helix, when brought about by mild acid treatment, is recovered at higher pH values which depend on the severity of the denaturation process. With the most severe treatment, about 24 groups titrating at pH g 3 are unmasked; about half of these appear to be imidazole. The number is in fair agreement with that recently calculated by Tanford and Nozaki for ferrihemoglobin. Evidence is presented that exposure of the ferroprotein to low pH (below 3) produces results (unmasked groups, regenerability of Cotton effects, and Soret band absorption) which are quantitatively different from those accompanying the maximum attainable degree of unfolding at longer times at higher pH. The pH and time of exposure to acid may determine whether unfolding of the ferroprotein occurs with or without detachment of the prosthetic group."

https://openalex.org/W2060715746,"IN separating the polyphyletic Vermetidae (s.l.) into its separate lineages, Morton1 noted the extreme anatomical similarity between Vermicularia and the coiled turritellids: “It is in fact little more than a turritellid which has taken on a sessile posture embedded in a hard substratum and proceeded to uncoil its shell whorls” (page 80 of ref. 1). Vermicularia is a ciliary suspension feeder, a common condition among sessile gastropods2. Only a few free living forms feed in this manner and one of these is Turritella. T. communis burrows into mud and may remain indefinitely in its favoured position. (Apex down and inclined at a high angle to the horizontal. The habits of Turritella are described in refs. 3 and 4.) The juvenile, regularly coiled Vermicularia lives in the same manner; its later attachment and uncoiling is a response to the availability of firm objects providing a substrate for rapid upgrowth."
https://openalex.org/W2022465700,"HETEROCYSTS are the most distinctive cells of the blue-green algae, Cyanophyta, where they occur in the great majority of the filamentous species. There have been many hypotheses regarding their function, but none of these has been widely accepted and there is fairly general agreement with the conclusion of Fritsch1 that heterocysts are still “a botanical enigma”. De Pumaly2, however, has presented evidence for an essentially mechanical function of the heterocysts and he has compared them with the rhizoids of other algae. The observations reported here are in general agreement with this interpretation of heterocysts as attachment organs, but suggest that their function is distinct from that of ordinary rhizoids."

https://openalex.org/W2399742749,"Abstract The results of the kinetic studies described in this report, of the binding studies in the accompanying paper, and of earlier investigations have led to the formulation of a kinetic mechanism for the carboxylation reaction catalyzed by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEP carboxykinase). Because of the complexity of this mechanism, no attempt was made to write an over-all rate equation for the initial velocity from which the experimental data might be interpreted. It proved more feasible to convert the pathway from free enzyme to the central complex (e-Mn2+-PEP-IDP-CO2) from a random one to an ordered, sequential one by designing experiments in which the concentrations of some species of the substrate were negligible relative to the concentrations of other species, allowing simplified rate equations to be written. It was possible, with this approach, to compile kinetic data which are consistent with the mechanism. Attempts to interpret the data on the basis of other mechanisms have led to inconsistencies. The most significant features of this mechanism are as follows. (a) The formation of a central complex consisting of enzyme, Mn2+, PEP, IDP, and CO2 proceeds by what may be described as a mixed ordered-random addition of the components. (b) PEP must bind to the enzyme before either IDP or CO2 in order to yield a kinetically active form of the enzyme. Although IDP and CO2 may bind without prior binding of PEP, they form inactive complexes that do not lead to the central complex, and they may be considered to be inhibitors with respect to PEP. (c) The binding of PEP proceeds in a random manner with respect to Mn2+ to form the ternary enzyme-Mn2+-PEP complex. Both free enzyme and enzyme-Mn2+ can bind PEP, although the affinity of the enzyme for PEP is greatly enhanced when Mn2+ is present, either on the enzyme or complexed with PEP. (d) The ternary enzyme-Mn2+-PEP complex may bind either IDP or CO2 to form a quaternary complex, which then binds the third substrate to form the central complex. (e) An alternative route to the quaternary enzyme-Mn2+-PEP-IDP complex involves the binding of MnIDP to the binary enzyme-PEP complex. (f) The central complex undergoes conversion to a new complex consisting of enzyme, Mn2+, oxalacetate, and ITP. The results of an experiment in which the reaction in the decarboxylation direction was carried out in H218O indicate that H2O does not participate directly in the reaction, since 18O was not incorporated into the products of the reaction (PEP and IDP). This result, in conjunction with the kinetic results reported herein and earlier findings, suggests that the chemical mechanism of the reaction is concerted."
