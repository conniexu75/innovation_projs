https://openalex.org/W2075832041,"Habitat loss, climate change, over-exploitation, disease and other factors have been hypothesised in the global decline of amphibian biodiversity. However, the relative importance of and synergies among different drivers are still poorly understood. We present the largest global analysis of roughly 45% of known amphibians (2,583 species) to quantify the influences of life history, climate, human density and habitat loss on declines and extinction risk. Multi-model Bayesian inference reveals that large amphibian species with small geographic range and pronounced seasonality in temperature and precipitation are most likely to be Red-Listed by IUCN. Elevated habitat loss and human densities are also correlated with high threat risk. Range size, habitat loss and more extreme seasonality in precipitation contributed to decline risk in the 2,454 species that declined between 1980 and 2004, compared to species that were stable (n = 1,545) or had increased (n = 28). These empirical results show that amphibian species with restricted ranges should be urgently targeted for conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2137890456,"Bacteria with intrinsic resistance to antibiotics are a worrisome health problem. It is widely believed that intrinsic antibiotic resistance of bacterial pathogens is mainly the consequence of cellular impermeability and activity of efflux pumps. However, the analysis of transposon-tagged Pseudomonas aeruginosa mutants presented in this article shows that this phenotype emerges from the action of numerous proteins from all functional categories. Mutations in some genes make P. aeruginosa more susceptible to antibiotics and thereby represent new targets. Mutations in other genes make P. aeruginosa more resistant and therefore define novel mechanisms for mutation-driven acquisition of antibiotic resistance, opening a new research field based in the prediction of resistance before it emerges in clinical environments. Antibiotics are not just weapons against bacterial competitors, but also natural signalling molecules. Our results demonstrate that antibiotic resistance genes are not merely protective shields and offer a more comprehensive view of the role of antibiotic resistance genes in the clinic and in nature."

These carotenoid-derived products include provitamin A, hormones, and flavor and fragrance molecules. In plants, the CCD1 enzyme cleaves carotenoids at 9,10 (9′,10′) bonds to generate multiple apocarotenoid products. Here we systematically analyzed volatile apocarotenoids generated by maize CCD1 (ZmCCD1) from multiple carotenoid substrates. ZmCCD1 did not cleave geranylgeranyl diphosphate or phytoene but did cleave other linear and cyclic carotenoids, producing volatiles derived from 9,10 (9′,10′) bond cleavage. Additionally the Arabidopsis, maize, and tomato CCD1 enzymes all cleaved lycopene to generate 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one. 6-Methyl-5-hepten-2-one, an important flavor volatile in tomato, was produced by cleavage of the 5,6 or 5′,6′ bond positions of lycopene but not geranylgeranyl diphosphate, ζ-carotene, or phytoene. In vitro, ZmCCD1 cleaved linear and cyclic carotenoids with equal efficiency. Based on the pattern of apocarotenoid volatiles produced, we propose that CCD1 recognizes its cleavage site based on the saturation status between carbons 7 and 8 (7′ and 8′) and carbons 11 and 12 (11′ and 12′) as well as the methyl groups on carbons 5, 9, and 13 (5′, 9′, and 13′).

Apocarotenoids are terpenoid compounds derived from the oxidative cleavage of carotenoids (1Wahlberg, I., and Eklund, A.-M. (1998) in Carotenoids (Britton, G., Liaaen-Jensen, S., and Pfander, H., eds) Vol. 3, pp. 195-216, Birkhäuser, BaselGoogle Scholar). They are generated when double bonds in a carotenoid are cleaved by molecular oxygen, forming an aldehyde or ketone in each product at the site of cleavage. Carotenoids can be cleaved at any of their conjugated double bonds, resulting in a diverse set of apocarotenoids. This structural diversity is the consequence of the large number of carotenoid precursors (more than 600) and subsequent modifications such as oxidation, reduction, and conjugation. Although apocarotenoid formation can also occur via nonspecific oxidation, biologically active forms with regulatory functions are expected to be generated via site-specific cleavage. Apocarotenoids are widely distributed in nature and serve important biological functions. Examples of biologically active apocarotenoids include retinoids in animals (2Giguere V. Ong E.S. Segui P. Evans R.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar), trisporic acid in fungi (3Gooday G.W. Carlile M.J. Mycologist. 1997; 11: 126-129Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and abscisic acid in higher plants (4Zeevaart J.A.D. Creelman R.A. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1988; 39: 439-473Crossref Google Scholar). A variety of other biologically important compounds are believed to be derived by oxidative cleavage of carotenoids. Among these compounds are those associated with mycorrhizal colonization, including mycorradicin (5Klingner A. Bothe H. Wray V. Marner F.J. Phytochemistry. 1995; 38: 53-55Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar), blumenin (6Maier W. Peipp H. Schmidt J. Wray V. Strack D. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and strigolactone (7Matusova R. Rani K. Verstappen F.W.A. Franssen M.C.R. Beale M.H. Bouwmeester H.J. Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 920-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Various enzymes mediate the site-specific carotenoid cleavage needed to generate biologically active apocarotenoids. The founding member of the carotenoid-cleaving enzymes is maize VIVIPAROUS14 (VP14) (8Schwartz S.H. Tan B.C. Gage D.A. Zeevaart J.A.D. McCarty D.R.

A. 1997; 94: 12235-12240Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). This 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED) generates abscisic acid via asymmetrical cleavage at the 11,12 double bond of neoxanthin and/or violaxanthin. NCED genes have been identified in a variety of plant species (9Tan B.C. Schwartz S.H. Zeevaart J.A.D. McCarty D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Using sequence similarity to VP14, the 15,15′-dioxygenases responsible for vitamin A biosynthesis were identified from Drosophila (14von Lintig J. Vogt K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11915-11920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) and humans (15Redmond T.M. Gentleman S. Duncan T. Yu S. Wiggert B. Gantt E. Cunningham F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6560-6565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). This and other work reveals that carotenoid-cleaving enzymes are an ancient and highly conserved family with members present in plants, animals, and bacteria. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains nine genes similar to VP14, five of which appear to be involved in abscisic acid biosynthesis (16Iuchi S. Kobayashi M. Taji T. Naramoto M. Seki M. Kato T. Tabata S. Kakubari Y. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Shinozaki K. Plant J. 2001; 27: 325-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Tan B.C. Joseph L.M. Deng W.T. Liu L.J. Li Q.B. Cline K. McCarty D.R. Plant J. 2003; 35: 44-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). The four remaining genes have been generically termed carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase-like (CCD) 2The abbreviations used are: CCD, carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase-like; GGPP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate; MHO, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GC, gas chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. 2The abbreviations used are: CCD, carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase-like; GGPP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate; MHO, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GC, gas chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. to distinguish them from abscisic acid biosynthetic enzymes. Two CCD enzymes produce an as yet unidentified apocarotenoid hormone involved in shoot branching (AtCCD7/MAX3 and AtCCD8/MAX4) (18Turnbull C.G.N. Booker J.P. Leyser H.M.O. Plant J. 2002; 32: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 19Sorefan K. Booker J. Haurogne K. Goussot M. Bainbridge K. Foo E. Chatfield S. Ward S. Beveridge C. Rameau C. Leyser O.

Biol. 2004; 14: 1232-1238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The function(s) of the remaining two, CCD1 and CCD4, is less obvious. The present work focuses on the biochemical activity of CCD1. CCD1 is a non-heme enzyme, requiring only Fe2+ as a cofactor. It contains four conserved histidines that are thought to coordinate iron binding. CCD1 uses oxygen to cleave a variety of carotenoid substrates symmetrically at the 9,10- and 9′,10′-positions, generating (di)aldehydes and ketones (21Schwartz S.H. Qin X. Zeevaart J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25208-25211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Until recently, controversy existed as to whether CCD1 cleavage occurred via a mono- or dioxygenase mechanism. Isotope labeling experiments have now demonstrated a dioxygenase mechanism (22Schmidt H. Kurtzer R. Eisenreich W. Schwab W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9845-9851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The aldehydes and ketones generated by CCD1 are important flavor and fragrance volatiles. Tomato CCD1 generates the flavor volatiles geranylacetone, pseudoionone, and β-ionone (23Simkin A.J. Schwartz S.H. Auldridge M. Taylor M.G. Klee H.J. Plant J. 2004; 40: 882-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). In petunia flowers, CCD1 controls emission of the fragrance and pollinator attractant β-ionone (24Simkin A.J. Underwood B.A. Auldridge M. Loucas H.M. Shibuya K. Schmelz E. Clark D.G. Klee H.J. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 3504-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). CCD1 enzymes have been isolated and shown to generate flavor volatiles from multiple plant species, including grape (25Mathieu S. Terrier N. Procureur J. Bigey F. Gunata Z. J. Exp. Bot. 2005; 56: 2721-2731Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), melon (26Ibdah M. Azulay Y. Portnoy V. Wasserman B. Bar E. Meir A. Burger Y. Hirschberg J. Schaffer A.A. Katzir N. Tadmor Y. Lewinsohn E. Phytochemistry. 2006; 67: 1579-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), crocus (27Bouvier F. Suire C. Mutterer J. Camara B. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 47-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), citrus (28Kato M. Matsumoto H. Ikoma Y. Okuda H. Yano M. J. Exp. Bot. 2006; 57: 2153-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and coffee (29Simkin, A. J., Moreau, H., Kuntz, M., Pagny, G., Lin, C., Tanksley, S., and McCarthy, J. (2008) J. Plant Physiol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Additionally, Arabidopsis ccd1 mutants have increased seed carotenoid content, suggesting a role in carotenoid turnover (30Auldridge M.E. Block A. Vogel J.T. Dabney-Smith C. Mila I. Bouzayen M. Magallanes-Lundback M. DellaPenna D. McCarty D.R. Klee H.J. Plant J. 2006; 45: 982-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). CCD enzymes have also been implicated in generating signaling compounds involved in mediating mycorrhizal relationships (31Bouwmeester H.J. Roux C. Lopez-Raez J.A. Becard G. Trends Plant Sci. 2007; 12: 224-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Hence, deciphering CCD1 function holds promise for increasing crop carotenoid content, altering volatiles contributing to taste, and understanding arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. Such an understanding has important implications for human health. Carotenoids with provitamin A activity such as β-carotene, α-carotene, and β-cryptoxanthin are essential in the human diet (32Olson J.A. J. Nutr. 1989; 119: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), and other carotenoids, such as lycopene, are associated with a decreased risk of prostate cancer (33Ansari M.S. Ansari S. Future Oncol. 2005; 1: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Increasing these beneficial carotenoids in the human diet has attracted much attention, and manipulating their metabolism would contribute greatly to this goal. Despite the growing number of studies, no effort has been undertaken to measure CCD1-generated volatiles in a systematic and quantitative manner mainly because such studies are extremely difficult to perform in vitro. Presenting the enzyme with substrate is problematic as carotenoids are extremely hydrophobic. Although there has been some limited success using natural carotenoids, most in vitro assays have utilized the more soluble synthetic substrate β-apo-8′-carotenal (22Schmidt H. Kurtzer R. Eisenreich W. Schwab W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9845-9851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 34Marasco E.K. Vay K. Schmidt-Dannert C. J. Biol.

Biotechnol. 2007; 75: 829-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In all cases, water-miscible solvents and/or micellar systems are needed for activity. As such, CCD enzymes have generally been expressed in Escherichia coli engineered to accumulate various carotenoids. Measuring CCD1-generated volatiles in a systematic and quantitative manner should provide insight into which carotenoids are the preferred substrate in planta. In the work presented, we expressed maize CCD1 (ZmCCD1) 3B. C. Tan and D. R. McCarty, submitted manuscript. 3B. C. Tan and D. R. McCarty, submitted manuscript. in E. coli engineered to produce various carotenoids (36Cunningham Jr., F.X. Gantt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This system provides a flexible method to quickly identify substrates in an environment more closely resembling conditions within plastids. Such work not only sheds light on the function of CCD1 but also provides a foundation for further studies of other carotenoid-cleaving enzymes. There are multiple apocarotenoid flavor and aroma volatiles that are not derived from 9,10 bond cleavage, and the enzyme(s) responsible for their production are not known, including 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (MHO) (5,6 cleavage), β-cyclocitral (7,8 cleavage), farnesylacetone (13,14 cleavage), and citral (7,8 cleavage). Identifying the enzymes and substrates that lead to the production of these compounds is essential to understanding carotenoid metabolism and the biological role of apocarotenoid products. Cloning of ZmCCD1—A near full-length ZmCCD1 cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from developing White cap (Wc) kernels of maize (18 days after pollination) with forward primer 5′-CCCTTCGCTACAAGCCTACA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TTCGAATACACGTCCTGCAA-3′. The PCR product was cloned into the pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The cDNA contained the complete predicted coding sequence of ZmCCD1. To create a fusion of ZmCCD1 to glutathione S-transferase (GST), the ZmCCD1 coding sequence was first amplified with forward primer 5′-GGATCCATGGGGACGGAGGCGGAGCAGCCG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ATGCCCTGCAATAATTTCCA-3′ using Pfu DNA polymerase and cloned into the pCR-blunt-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). A BamHI/EcoRI fragment from this vector was ligated into the pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Biosciences/GE Healthcare). The construct was sequenced to confirm that the gene was in the correct reading frame. Volatile Analysis from E. coli Cultures—pGEX2T-ZmCCD1, pGEX2T empty vector, pDEST15-AtCCD1, pDEST15-LeCCD1A, pDEST15-LeCCD1B, or pDEST15-GUS (23Simkin A.J. Schwartz S.H. Auldridge M. Taylor M.G.

Three individual colonies for each carotenoid strain were used to inoculate three different 3-ml cultures of LB containing 100 μg/ml carbenicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol (Sigma). The 3-ml cultures were grown overnight at 37 °C. The following day, 1 ml of overnight culture was used to inoculate 100 ml of LB containing 100 μg/ml carbenicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol in a 250-ml baffle flask. The cultures were grown at 200 rpm for 2.5–3 h at 33 °C in darkness until an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.4–0.6 was achieved. The flask was then chilled on ice for 5 min and induced with a final concentration of 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma) or 0.1% l-arabinose (Fischer Scientific). The cultures were returned to the shaker and grown for an additional 3 h (200 rpm at 25 °C). The cultures were then placed on a bench and capped with a rubber stopper, and partially purified air (the filter consisted of 0.5 mg of activated charcoal in a 0.6 × 10-cm glass tube) was bubbled through the cultures (∼175 ml min-1) for 2 h using a dual diaphragm air pump (General Hydroponics, Sebastopol, CA). The volatile head space was collected on a 30-mg Super Q column (80/100 mesh; Alltech Associates, Inc., Deerfield, IL). After volatile collection, the A600 was recorded. The Super Q columns were eluted with 150 μl of methylene chloride (Fischer Scientific) after addition of 400 ng of nonyl acetate (in 5 μl of methylene chloride) as an internal standard. Alternatively cultures were extracted twice with an equal volume of hexanes. The combined hexane extracts were dried with sodium sulfate. Before injection on the gas chromatograph, nitrogen was blown over the samples to evaporate solvent until they reached a volume of ∼300 μl. Separation of volatiles was performed on an Agilent DB-5 column (Palo Alto, CA) and an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph according to Schmelz et al. (40Schmelz E.A. Alborn H.T. Tumlinson J.H. Planta. 2001; 214: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The volatiles were compared with known standards (Sigma-Aldrich) and calculated as nmol A600-1 h-1. Any background present in control reactions was subtracted, and values were normalized for percent recovery of each volatile. Percent recovery was calculated as the average amount of volatiles recovered from flasks with 100 ml of LB treated exactly as described above except that at the point of “induction” a known amount of each volatile compound was added. The identity of each peak was confirmed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry using an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph with a DB-5 column and an Agilent 5975 mass detector in electron ionization mode. Isoprenoid Isolation—All solvents were purchased from Fischer Scientific. To analyze isoprenoids present in E. coli, 100-ml LB cultures in 250-ml baffle flasks with the appropriate antibiotics were grown in darkness (200 rpm at 28 °C) to an A600 of 0.9–1.0. The cultures were induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside and were grown an additional 16 h. Cells were pelleted at 5,000 × g for 15 min, and isoprenoids were extracted according to Fraser et al. (41Fraser P.D. Pinto M.E. Holloway D.E. Bramley P.M. Plant J. 2000; 24: 551-558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the modification that the methanol contained 0.1% butylated hydroxytoluene (Sigma-Aldrich). Where possible, all steps were carried out on ice and shielded from strong light. Isoprenoid extracts were dried under nitrogen and stored in an atmosphere of nitrogen at -80 °C prior to HPLC analysis. HPLC Analysis—All solvents used were purchased from Fischer Scientific, HPLC grade, and degassed prior to use. Prior to HPLC, samples were dissolved in 0.5 ml of ethyl acetate and spun in a microcentrifuge at 16,000 × g to clarify the samples. HPLC analysis was carried out on a Waters system consisting of a 510 pump (pump C), two 515 pumps (pumps A and B), a 717 autosampler, and a 2996 photodiode array detector according to Fraser et al. (41Fraser P.D. Pinto M.E. Holloway D.E. Bramley P.M. Plant J. 2000; 24: 551-558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A reverse-phase C30, 5-μm column (250 × 4.6 mm) coupled to a 20 × 4.6-mm C30 guard (YMC Inc., Wilmington, NC) was used. 100 μl of sample (carotenoids were resuspended in 0.5 ml of ethyl acetate, and the C17 dialdehyde was resuspended in methanol) was injected. The mobile phases consisted of methanol (A) and water/methanol (20:80 by volume) containing 0.2% ammonium acetate (B) and methyl tert-butyl ether (C). The gradient elution used was 95% A, 5% B isocratically for 12 min and a step to 80% A, 5% B, 15% C at 12 min followed by a linear gradient to 30% A, 5% B, 65% C by 30 min. A conditioning phase (30–60 min) was then used to return the column to the initial concentrations of A and B. Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification—Zm-CCD1 in pGEX2T was transformed into chemically competent BL21(DE3) (Clontech) cells. Individual colonies were grown in 5 ml of LB containing 100 μg/ml carbenicillin overnight at 37 °C. The following day, 4 ml of overnight culture was used to inoculate 400 ml of LB containing 100 μg/ml carbenicillin in a 1-liter baffle flask. These cultures were grown (200 rpm at 30 °C) to an A600 of 0.8–0.9. The flask was chilled on ice for 10 min and then induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. After induction, the cultures were grown for 4 h (200 rpm at 25 °C) and centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 15 min. The cells were resuspended in 20 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged again at 5,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The phosphate-buffered saline was poured off, and the cells were frozen overnight at -20 °C. Frozen cells were thawed on ice for 30 min. The cells were resuspended in 10 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were sonicated on ice for 5 min with 5-s bursts (microtip limit of 5, 50% duty cycle). After sonication, 20% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline was added to a final concentration of 0.2%. The cell slurry was shaken on ice for 20 min before centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-μm filter to obtain a cell free lysate. Glycerol was added to a final concentration of 20%, and the lysate was stored in aliquots at -20 °C. Enzyme assays were performed with 100 μl of lysate unless otherwise noted. GST-tagged ZmCCD1 was purified with glutathione-Sepharose resin (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's directions. Protein Blot Analysis—Samples of bacteria or protein were mixed in 2× SDS-PAGE buffer and loaded onto 10% Ready Gel Tris-HCl (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of total bacterial protein were loaded based on culture optical density, whereas protein concentration for all other samples was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. The proteins present in the gel were stained using Bio-Rad Safe Stain or transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Protein blot analysis was performed as described previously (42Kevany B.M. Tieman D.M. Taylor M.G. Cin V.D. Klee H.J. Plant J. 2007; 51: 458-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) using GST antibody (Amersham Biosciences/GE Healthcare). Enzyme Assays—A stock solution of the synthetic substrate β-apo-8′-carotenal (Sigma) was prepared by dissolving 0.01 g in 100 ml of 95% ethanol. The stock solution was stored in the dark under nitrogen at -20 °C. To obtain an aqueous stock solution for enzyme assays, 1 ml of 1% polyoxyethylene sorbitan mono-palmitate (Tween 40) (Sigma-Aldrich) in 95% ethanol was added to 3 ml of 0.1 mg/ml β-apo-8′-carotenal. The mixture was vortexed vigorously and dried under a stream of nitrogen. 1.2 ml of 50 mm NaPO4 (pH 7.2) was added and vortexed to obtain a 250 μg/ml solution. In vitro assays were performed in a total volume of 1 ml containing 50 mm NaPO4 (pH 7.2), 300 mm NaCl, 5 μm FeSO4, 5 mm ascorbate, 20% methanol, and 30 μg of β-apo-8′-carotenal. The final concentration of Tween 40 in the assay was 0.1%. Water was added to bring the total volume to 0.9 ml, and the assays were mixed and allowed to adjust to room temperature for 5 min. Then 100 μl of lysate or purified protein was added. Each assay was mixed with gentle swirling and placed in the dark for 30 min at 30 °C. Assays with lycopene and/or β-carotene were set up in an identical manner except that chloroform was used as the solvent. 1 mg of carotenoid was dissolved in 1 ml of chloroform. The concentration of each stock solution was calculated from known extinction coefficients by measuring the absorbance at 453 or 472 nm (43Britton G. Liaaen-Jensen S. Pfander H. Carotenoids: Volume 1A: Isolation and Analysis. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel1998Google Scholar). Based on the number of assays performed, an appropriate amount of carotenoid was added to 1% Tween 40 diluted in chloroform. This solution was vortexed, and 30 μg of carotenoid was aliquoted into individual glass vials. The carotenoid/Tween-40 solution was dried under a stream of nitrogen. The residue was dissolved in 200 μl of methanol, and the remaining assay components were added. Reactions were incubated in the dark for 16 h at 30 °C. Volatiles were collected from assays on a Super Q column by passing purified air (618 ml min-1) over the assays for 1 h. Volatile elution and analysis were performed as described above. Values from GC analysis were normalized for percent recovery of each volatile. Percent recovery was calculated as the average amount of volatiles recovered from assays spiked with a known amount of each volatile compound. Non-volatile products were isolated as described for the isoprenoid isolation from E. coli pellets. To determine the concentration of carotenoids dissolved in an assay, the control reactions were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min to remove any precipitate. The soluble fraction was removed, and 0.5 μg of astaxanthin was added as an internal standard. The carotenoids were isolated, resuspended in ethyl acetate, and analyzed via HPLC. Concentrations were calculated compared with standard curves. ZmCCD1 Cleaves Multiple Carotenoids to Generate Apocarotenoid Volatiles Derived from 9,10 and 5,6 Double Bond Cleavage—To determine the substrate specificities and bond cleavage preferences of ZmCCD1, we undertook a systematic analysis of the volatile products generated by the enzyme in various carotenoid-accumulating strains of E. coli. The volatile products are indicative of these cleavage activities (Table 1). Plasmids encoding various carotenoid biosynthetic enzymes (36Cunningham Jr., F.X. Gantt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cultures expressing ZmCCD1 and accumulating various carotenoids were grown in darkness, induced, and grown for a further 3 h, and the volatile head space was collected. After addition of an internal standard, volatile products were eluted and analyzed by GC and GC/MS. No isoprenoid-derived volatiles were identified from cultures synthesizing GGPP (data not shown) or phytoene (Fig. 1A), although ZmCCD1 was expressed (Fig. 1B). To ensure that ZmCCD1 did not cleave these isoprenoids and generate non-volatile products, the isoprenoids from GGPP and phytoene cultures were extracted and analyzed by HPLC. No new non-volatile products were found, and compared with the control, the levels of each isoprenoid were unchanged (data not shown), confirming that ZmCCD1 did not cleave GGPP or phytoene.TABLE 1Volatiles predicted to be generated by carotenoid cleavage at various bond positionsPosition of the double bond5,6 or 5′,6′7,8 or 7′,8′9,10 or 9,′10′GGPP6-Methyl-5-hepten-2-oneGeranylacetonePhytoene6-Methyl-5-hepten-2-oneGeranylacetoneζ-Carotene6-Methyl-5-hepten-2-oneGeranylacetoneLycopene6-Methyl-5-hepten-2-oneCitralPseudoiononeδ-Carotene6-Methyl-5-hepten-2-oneCitralα-Ionone, pseudoiononeβ-Caroteneβ-Cyclocitralβ-IononeZeaxanthin3-Hydroxy-β-cyclocitral3-Hydroxy-β-ionone Open table in a new tab Apocarotenoid volatiles were identified from cultures producing other carotenoid substrates.

Many laboratories were not able to detect the presence of cannabinoid CB2 receptors (CB2-Rs) in healthy brains, but there has been demonstration of CB2-R expression in rat microglial cells and other brain associated cells during inflammation. Therefore, neuronal expression of CB2-Rs had been ambiguous and controversial and its role in depression and substance abuse is unknown.In this study we tested the hypothesis that genetic variants of CB2 gene might be associated with depression in a human population and that alteration in CB2 gene expression may be involved in the effects of abused substances including opiates, cocaine and ethanol in rodents. Here we demonstrate that a high incidence of (Q63R) but not (H316Y) polymorphism in the CB2 gene was found in Japanese depressed subjects. CB2-Rs and their gene transcripts are expressed in the brains of naïve mice and are modulated following exposure to stressors and administration of abused drugs. Mice that developed alcohol preference had reduced CB2 gene expression and chronic treatment with JWH015 a putative CB2-R agonist, enhanced alcohol consumption in stressed but not in control mice. The direct intracerebroventricular microinjection of CB2 anti-sense oligonucleotide into the mouse brain reduced mouse aversions in the plus-maze test, indicating the functional presence of CB2-Rs in the brain that modifies behavior. We report for the using electron microscopy the sub cellular localization of CB2-Rs that are mainly on post-synaptic elements in rodent brain.Our data demonstrate the functional expression of CB2-Rs in brain that may provide novel targets for the effects of cannabinoids in depression and substance abuse disorders beyond neuro-immunocannabinoid activity."
https://openalex.org/W2013547494,"Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are protein deacetylases that play a role in repression of gene transcription and are emerging targets in cancer therapy. Here, we characterize the structure and enzymatic activity of the catalytic domain of human HDAC7 (cdHDAC7). Although HDAC7 normally exists as part of a multiprotein complex, we show that cdHDAC7 has a low level of deacetylase activity which can be inhibited by known HDAC inhibitors. The crystal structures of human cdHDAC7 and its complexes with two hydroxamate inhibitors are the first structures of the catalytic domain of class IIa HDACs and demonstrate significant differences with previously reported class I and class IIb-like HDAC structures. We show that cdHDAC7 has an additional class IIa HDAC-specific zinc binding motif adjacent to the active site which is likely to participate in substrate recognition and protein-protein interaction and may provide a site for modulation of activity.

Our studies provide mechanistic insights into class IIa HDACs and facilitate the design of specific modulators. The level of histone acetylation is regulated by the action of two classes of enzymes, histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs). 3The abbreviations used are: HDAC, histone deacetylase; cdHDAC7, catalytic domain of human HDAC7; TSA, trichostatin A; SAHA, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol. Histone acetyltransferases and HDACs are found in large multiprotein complexes, and recruitment of histone acetylase or deacetylase complexes by coactivators or corepressors is thought to cause a local change in the chromatin structure, resulting in either activation or repression of gene transcription (1Kao H.Y. Downes M. Ordentlich P. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 55-66PubMed Google Scholar). Humans have 18 HDACs and, based on their sequence similarity to yeast factors, they are grouped into four classes (class I–IV). Class II HDACs are homologous to yeast histone deacetylase HDA1 and have been implicated as global regulators of gene expression during cell differentiation and development (2Verdin E. Dequiedt F. Kasler H.G. Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 286-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). In humans, class II HDACs are subdivided into classes IIa (HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC7, and HDAC9) and IIb (HDAC6 and HDAC10). Class IIa HDACs contain two functionally important regions, a highly conserved C-terminal catalytic domain and an N-terminal extension that has no similarity with other proteins, mediates the signal-dependent shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, and harbors binding sites for transcriptional regulators (2Verdin E. Dequiedt F. Kasler H.G. Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 286-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 3Yang X.J. Gregoire S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2873-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Class IIa HDACs interact with corepressors such as N-CoR (nuclear receptor corepressor) and the MEF2 (myocyte enhancer factor 2) family of transcription factors that is not only important for controlling gene expression in normal cellular programs like muscle differentiation, T-cell apoptosis, neuronal survival, and synaptic differentiation but has also been linked to cardiac hypertrophy, asthma, atherosclerosis, hypertension, and other pathological conditions (3Yang X.J.

To date all four class IIa HDACs have been knocked out in mice, and the resulting abnormal phenotypes have been extensively characterized (6Vega R.B. Matsuda K. Oh J. Barbosa A.C. Yang X. Meadows E.

Young B.D. Li S. Qi X. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2006; 126: 321-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). HDACs catalyze the deacetylation of lysine residues in the N-terminal tails of core histones. In addition to histones, nonhistone proteins may also serve as substrates (10Zhang Y. Li N. Caron C. Matthias G. Hess D. Khochbin S. Matthias P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1168-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 11Hubbert C. Guardiola A. Shao R. Kawaguchi Y. Ito A. Nixon A. Yoshida M. Wang X.F. Yao T.P. Nature. 2002; 417: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (1793) Google Scholar). The currently accepted catalytic mechanism of HDACs has features of both metallo- and serine proteases. In a first step a tetrahedral oxyanion intermediate is formed after the nucleophilic attack of a zinc-activated water molecule on the carbonyl carbon of the substrate acetyl group. The negative charge of the tetrahedral oxyanion intermediate is stabilized by interactions with the zinc and the side chain of an active site tyrosine. The reaction is completed by the transfer of a proton to the scissile nitrogen, yielding the acetate and lysine products (12Finnin M.S. Donigian J.R. Cohen A. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A.

EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The activity of the class IIa HDACs is regulated at several levels, including tissue-specific gene expression, nucleocytoplasmic shuttling that is dependent on their phosphorylation state and subsequent binding of 14-3-3 proteins, and recruitment of distinct cofactors (2Verdin E. Dequiedt F. Kasler H.G. Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 286-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 3Yang X.J. Gregoire S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2873-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). In vivo, the enzymatic activity of class IIa HDACs is dependent on a multiprotein complex containing HDAC3 and SMRT/N-CoR (silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid receptor) (16Fischle W.

HDACs are considered to be among the most promising targets in drug development for cancer therapy (18Drummond D.C. Noble C.O. Kirpotin D.B. Guo Z. Scott G.K. Benz C.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2005; 45: 495-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 19Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 38-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (1941) Google Scholar), and some compounds like suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) are in late stage clinical trials (20Marks P.A. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 1351-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Most of the HDAC inhibitors developed so far display their effects in nano- and micromolar concentrations (21Bolden J.E. Peart M.J. Johnstone R.W. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 769-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2527) Google Scholar). However, only a few compounds are emerging as preferential inhibitors of class I versus class II HDACs, and even fewer are able to discriminate efficiently among HDACs that belong to the same class (19Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 38-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (1941) Google Scholar). HDAC structures in complex with various inhibitors revealed a pharmacophore model for HDAC inhibition. The pharmacophore consists of (i) a metal binding domain, which chelates the active site zinc and blocks the enzymatic activity, (ii) a linker domain, which mimics the substrate and occupies the enzymatic channel, and (iii) a surface domain, which makes contacts with the rim of the binding pocket (19Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 38-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (1941) Google Scholar, 22Miller T.A. Witter D.J. Belvedere S. J. Med.

To date the crystal structures of human HDAC8 and a bacterial HDAC homolog from Aquifex aeolicus, both representing class I HDACs, and the bacterial class IIb HDAC-like amidohydrolase from Bordetella/Alcaligenes strain FB188 have been reported (12Finnin M.S.

To provide insight into the structure and function of this subclass, we report here the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of human HDAC7 (cdHDAC7) and two cdHDAC7-hydroxamate inhibitor complex structures. The crystal structure of cdHDAC7 is the first structure of the catalytic domain of a eukaryotic class IIa HDAC, revealing significant structural differences compared with previously reported human and bacterial class I and bacterial class IIb-like HDAC structures. cdHDAC7 has a novel zinc binding motif adjacent to the active site, which is conserved in class IIa HDACs and likely participates in substrate recognition and protein-protein interaction. cdHDAC7 also has a variant active site topology resulting in altered catalytic properties and in an enlarged active site pocket. Our cdHDAC7 studies provide mechanistic insights into eukaryotic class IIa HDACs and may enable the design of class-specific HDAC modulators. Reagents—Thrombin was obtained from Sigma. HDAC inhibitors were purchased from commercial suppliers except those synthesized as described in supplemental Fig. S1. All other chemicals were of the highest purity available. Protein Cloning, Expression, and Purification—Residues 483–903 of isoform 1 of cdHDAC7 were amplified by PCR from the Mammalian Gene Collection clone and subcloned into a modified pET28a vector using ligation-independent cloning. cdHDAC7 (both wild type and variants) was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) Codon Plus RIL (Stratagene) in Terrific Broth medium in the presence of 50 μg/ml kanamycin. Cells were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of about 2, cooled down to 12 °C, and induced by 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-d-galactopyranoside overnight. For purification, cells were suspended in lysis buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.1% CHAPS, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed by passing through a Microfluidizer (Microfluidics Corp.) at 18,000 p.s.i. The purification procedure comprised two chromatographic steps, an affinity chromatography on a 5-ml HiTrap Chelating column (GE Healthcare) charged with Ni2+ and anion exchange chromatography on a Source 30Q column (10 × 10, GE Healthcare). The affinity column was washed with 10 column volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, and 20 mm imidazole, and the protein was eluted with elution buffer (equilibration buffer plus 250 mm imidazole). Thrombin was added to pooled cdHDAC7 fractions and incubated overnight at 4 °C while dialyzing against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT. The protein was further purified to homogeneity by anion-exchange chromatography after diluting the dialyzed sample 10 times with equilibration buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). cdHDAC7 was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl up to 400 mm (15 column volumes). The purified protein was concentrated to the desired concentration in presence of 2.5% 1,2-propandiol and 5 mm DTT. Ligand Binding Assay—Ligand binding was detected by monitoring the increase in thermostability of proteins in the presence of ligands using differential scanning light scattering as previously described (26Vedadi M. Niesen F.H. Allali-Hassani A. Fedorov O.Y. Finerty Jr., P.J. Wasney G.A. Yeung R. Arrowsmith C. Ball L.J. Berglund H. Hui R. Marsden B.D. Nordlund P. Sundstrom M. Weigelt J. Edwards A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15835-15840Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Fifty microliters of protein (0.4 mg/ml) was heated from 27 to 80 °C at a rate of 1 °C/min in each well of a clear-bottom 384-well plate (Nunc, Rochester, NY) under a variety of solution conditions. Protein aggregation was monitored by measuring the intensity of the scattered light every 30 s with a CCD camera. The pixel intensities in a preselected region of each well were integrated to generate a value representative of the total amount of scattered light in that region. These total intensities were then plotted against temperature for each sample well and fitted to the Boltzmann equation by nonlinear regression. The resulting point of inflection of each resulting curve was defined as the Tagg. Enzyme Activity Assays—Histone deacetylase activity was assayed using the Fluor de Lys™ Kit from Biomol (AK-500, Biomol International LP) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The increase in fluorescence intensity at 460 nm (emission) after excitation at 360 nm was monitored using a multiplate reader (Spectromax Gemini, Molecular Devices). To determine Km and kcat values, cdHDAC7 at 2.5 μm was assayed using different concentrations of Fluor de Lys substrate (1 μm to 1 mm), and reactions were prolonged to 150 min to be able to detect the low level of activity of the wild-type enzyme. For the cdHDAC7 variants, enzyme concentrations of 1, 1, and 0.02 μm of H843F, H843A, and H843Y were used, respectively. Each reaction was performed in 7 min. HDAC activity was also measured in the presence of potential inhibitors (LAQ824, LBH589, oxamflatin, PDX101, SAHA, TSA, and tubacin) at concentrations ranging from 1.9 μm to 2 mm using 10 μm of Fluor de Lys substrate. IC50 values were calculated using SigmaPlot 9.0 software. Protein Crystallization—Purified cdHDAC7 was crystallized using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C by mixing 3 μl of the protein solution (in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm DTT, and 2.5% 1,2-propandiol) with 3 μl of the reservoir solution. First, cdHDAC7 was co-crystallized with a 7-fold molar excess of the hydroxamate inhibitor LAQ824. However, no ligand was observed in the cdHDAC7 model. Moreover, a water molecule coordinates the catalytic zinc ion as seen in the apo structure of the HDAC-like protein from A. aeolicus (12Finnin M.S. Donigian J.R. Cohen A. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A.

To obtain the cdHDAC7-hydroxamate inhibitor complex structures, co-crystallization with the inhibitor was insufficient, and 2 mm compound needed to be included in the cryosolution during crystal freezing (soaking). The SAHA complex was prepared by directly adding 2 mm SAHA to concentrated cdHDAC7 (10–13 mg/ml). TSA complex crystals were obtained by adding 2 mm TSA to diluted protein solution followed by co-concentration up to about 10 mg/ml. All crystals were grown in a condition containing 10–15% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.1 m HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 10% isopropanol, and 10 mm DTT. Before flash-freezing the crystal in liquid nitrogen, the crystal was soaked in a cryoprotectant consisting of 80% reservoir solution and 20% ethylene glycol.

https://openalex.org/W1991128766,"Age-related increases in monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) may contribute to neurodegeneration associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). The MAO-B inhibitor deprenyl, a long-standing antiparkinsonian therapy, is currently used clinically in concert with the dopamine precursor L-DOPA. Clinical studies suggesting that deprenyl treatment alone is not protective against PD associated mortality were targeted to symptomatic patients. However, dopamine loss is at least 60% by the time PD is symptomatically detectable, therefore lack of effect of MAO-B inhibition in these patients does not negate a role for MAO-B in pre-symptomatic dopaminergic loss. In order to directly evaluate the role of age-related elevations in astroglial MAO-B in the early initiation or progression of PD, we created genetically engineered transgenic mice in which MAO-B levels could be specifically induced within astroglia in adult animals. Elevated astrocytic MAO-B mimicking age related increase resulted in specific, selective and progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN), the same subset of neurons primarily impacted in the human condition. This was accompanied by other PD-related alterations including selective decreases in mitochondrial complex I activity and increased mitochondrial oxidative stress. Along with a global astrogliosis, we observed local microglial activation within the SN. These pathologies correlated with decreased locomotor activity. Importantly, these events occurred even in the absence of the PD-inducing neurotoxin MPTP. Our data demonstrates that elevation of murine astrocytic MAO-B by itself can induce several phenotypes of PD, signifying that MAO-B could be directly involved in multiple aspects of disease neuropathology. Mechanistically this may involve increases in membrane permeant H2O2 which can oxidize dopamine within dopaminergic neurons to dopaminochrome which, via interaction with mitochondrial complex I, can result in increased mitochondrial superoxide. Our inducible astrocytic MAO-B transgenic provides a novel model for exploring pathways involved in initiation and progression of several key features associated with PD pathology and for therapeutic drug testing."
https://openalex.org/W2015127014,"Background Naturally occurring thymus derived regulatory T cells (Tregs) are central in the maintenance of self-tolerance. The transcription factor FOXP3 is crucial for the suppressive activity of Tregs and is considered the most specific marker for this population. However, human non regulatory T cells upregulate FOXP3 transiently upon activation which calls for other means to identify the Treg population. Since epigenetic mechanisms are involved in the establishment of stable gene expression patterns during cell differentiation, we hypothesized that the methylation profile of the FOXP3 promoter would allow the distinction of truly committed Tregs. Methodology/Principal Findings Human CD4+CD25hi Tregs displayed a demethylated FOXP3 promoter (1.4%±0.95% SEM methylated) in contrast to CD4+CD25lo T cells which were partially methylated (27.9%±7.1%). Furthermore, stimulated CD4+CD25lo T cells transiently expressed FOXP3 but remained partially methylated, suggesting promoter methylation as a mechanism for regulation of stable FOXP3 expression and Treg commitment. In addition, transient FOXP3 expressing cells exhibited suppressive abilities that correlate to the methylation status of the FOXP3 promoter. As an alternative to bisulphite sequencing, we present a restriction enzyme based screening method for the identification of committed Tregs and apply this method to evaluate the effect of various culturing conditions. We show that a partial demethylation occurs in long-term cultures after activation, whereas the addition of TGF-β and/or IL-10 does not induce any additional change in methylation level. Conclusions/Significance The unique FOXP3 promoter methylation profile in Tregs suggests that a demethylated pattern is a prerequisite for stable FOXP3 expression and suppressive phenotype. Presently, FOXP3 is used to identify Tregs in several human diseases and there are future implications for adoptive Treg transfer in immunotherapy. In these settings there is a need to distinguish true Tregs from transiently FOXP3+ activated T cells. The screening method we present allows this distinction and enables the identification of cells suitable for in vitro expansions and clinical use."
https://openalex.org/W2135955348,"Symbiotic relationships with bacteria are common within the Arthropoda, with interactions that substantially influence the biology of both partners. The symbionts' spatial distribution is essential for understanding key aspects of this relationship, such as bacterial transmission, phenotype, and dynamics. In this study, fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to localize five secondary symbionts from various populations and biotypes of the sweet potato whitefly Bemisia tabaci: Hamiltonella, Arsenophonus, Cardinium, Wolbachia, and Rickettsia. All five symbionts were found to be located with the primary symbiont Portiera inside the bacteriocytes--cells specifically modified to house bacteria--but within these cells, they occupied various niches. The intrabacteriocyte distribution pattern of Rickettsia differed from what has been described previously. Cardinium and Wolbachia were found in other host tissues as well. Because all symbionts share the same cell, bacteriocytes in B. tabaci represent a unique intracellular ecosystem. This phenomenon may be a result of the direct enclosure of the bacteriocyte in the egg during oogenesis, providing a useful mechanism for efficient vertical transmission by ""hitching a ride"" with Portiera. On the other hand, cohabitation in the same cell provides ample opportunities for interactions among symbionts that can either facilitate (cooperation) or limit (warfare) symbiotic existence."
https://openalex.org/W2007883639,"Background Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) offer a virtually unlimited source of neural cells for structural repair in neurological disorders, such as stroke. Neural cells can be derived from hESCs either by direct enrichment, or by isolating specific growth factor-responsive and expandable populations of human neural stem cells (hNSCs). Studies have indicated that the direct enrichment method generates a heterogeneous population of cells that may contain residual undifferentiated stem cells that could lead to tumor formation in vivo. Methods/Principal Findings We isolated an expandable and homogenous population of hNSCs (named SD56) from hESCs using a defined media supplemented with epidermal growth factor (EGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and leukemia inhibitory growth factor (LIF). These hNSCs grew as an adherent monolayer culture. They were fully neuralized and uniformly expressed molecular features of NSCs, including nestin, vimentin and radial glial markers. These hNSCs did not express the pluripotency markers Oct4 or Nanog, nor did they express markers for the mesoderm or endoderm lineages. The self-renewal property of the hNSCs was characterized by a predominant symmetrical mode of cell division. The SD56 hNSCs differentiated into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes throughout multiple passages in vitro, as well as after transplantation. Together, these criteria confirm the definitive NSC identity of the SD56 cell line. Importantly, they exhibited no chromosome abnormalities and did not form tumors after implantation into rat ischemic brains and into naïve nude rat brains and flanks. Furthermore, hNSCs isolated under these conditions migrated toward the ischemia-injured adult brain parenchyma and improved the independent use of the stroke-impaired forelimb two months post-transplantation. Conclusions/Significance The SD56 human neural stem cells derived under the reported conditions are stable, do not form tumors in vivo and enable functional recovery after stroke. These properties indicate that this hNSC line may offer a renewable, homogenous source of neural cells that will be valuable for basic and translational research."
https://openalex.org/W1974558745,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a cellular compartment for the biosynthesis and folding of newly synthesized secretory proteins such as insulin. Perturbations to ER homeostasis cause ER stress and subsequently activate cell signaling pathways, collectively known as the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). IRE1alpha is a central component of the UPR. In pancreatic beta-cells, IRE1alpha also functions in the regulation of insulin biosynthesis.Here we report that hyperactivation of IRE1alpha caused by chronic high glucose treatment or IRE1alpha overexpression leads to insulin mRNA degradation in pancreatic beta-cells. Inhibition of IRE1alpha signaling using its dominant negative form prevents insulin mRNA degradation. Islets from mice heterozygous for IRE1alpha retain expression of more insulin mRNA after chronic high glucose treatment than do their wild-type littermates.These results reveal a role of IRE1alpha in insulin mRNA expression under ER stress conditions caused by chronic high glucose. The rapid degradation of insulin mRNA could provide immediate relief for the ER and free up the translocation machinery. Thus, this mechanism would preserve ER homeostasis and help ensure that the insulin already inside the ER can be properly folded and secreted. This adaptation may be crucial for the maintenance of beta-cell homeostasis and may explain why the beta-cells of type 2 diabetic patients with chronic hyperglycemia stop producing insulin in the absence of apoptosis. This mechanism may also be involved in suppression of the autoimmune type 1 diabetes by reducing the amount of misfolded insulin, which could be a source of ""neo-autoantigens."""

NO accumulation is sensitive to the NO scavenger 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide. Neither an fnr mutant nor an fnr hmp double mutant produces NO, indicating the involvement in NO evolution from (NO2−) of protein(s) positively regulated by FNR.

Evidence for NO production by purified B. subtilis NOS has been obtained using the mammalian neuronal NOS reductase domain as electron donor (23Adak S. Aulak K.S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11071-11079Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the nos gene of Streptomyces species has been identified on a pathogenicity island that confers the ability of the species to produce thaxtomin, a depeptide phytotoxin required for plant pathogenicity. Therefore, Streptomyces NOS has been implicated in the nitration of thaxtomin (24Kers J.A. Wach M.J. Krasnoff S.B. Widom J. Cameron K.D. Bukhalid R.A. Gibson D.M. Crane B.R. Loria R. Nature. 2004; 429: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar).The ability of bacteria to perform nitrosation reactions is well documented. In the stomach, bacteria catalyze formation of N-nitroso compounds from (NO2−) at neutral pH values (26Lundberg J.O. Weitzberg E. Cole J.A. Benjamin N. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), and the resulting N-nitrosamines have been implicated in gastric cancer. Bacterial nitrosation has been characterized in vitro, using 2,3-diaminonaphthalene (DAN) as substrate and monitoring the fluorescent product (27Ralt D. Wishnok J.S. Fitts R. Tannenbaum S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 28Ji X.B. Hollocher T.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1988; 54: 1791-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Microbiology. 1997; 143: 2647-2656Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) is mediated by NO generated as a secondary activity of nitrate reductase, but this proposal has not been tested genetically. Like NrfA, NarGHIJ is expressed under anaerobic conditions via positive regulation by FNR and in the presence of (NO3−) via the activity of phosphorylated NarL (31Stewart V. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Weiss (32Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 829-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) has suggested that nitrosative mutagenesis in E. coli during (NO3−) or (NO2−) respiration arises largely from the activity of a third reductase, cytoplasmic nitrite reductase NirB; it is envisaged that NirB is the major source of NO during (NO3−) or (NO2−) metabolism and that, under hypoxic conditions, NO forms nitrosating agents such as N2O3, which result in mutagenesis in growing cells.Thus NOS-like proteins, nitrate reductase, and two nitrite reductases have been variously implicated in bacterial NO evolution and nitrosation. In view of these uncertainties, and the robust NO-consuming activities of enterobacteria, which were not appreciated in earlier work, we have undertaken a study of the production of NO by S. typhimurium, exploiting the availability of NO-sensitive electrodes and mutants in the critical reductases and NO-detoxifying flavohemoglobin. We demonstrate the production of NO from (NO2−) by NarGHI and suggest a homeostatic mechanism that minimizes NO accumulation and hence potential nitrosative mutagenesis of S. typhimurium. Parallels with the mechanisms of NO evolution that occur in higher plants are revealed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains, Media, and Culture Conditions—Table 1 lists strains used in this study. Anaerobic cultures were grown at 37 °C in Luria Broth (LB) containing potassium nitrate (KNO3) at a final concentration of 100 mm, supplemented as appropriate with kanamycin (50 μg/ml), tetracycline (25 μg/ml), or chloramphenicol (Cm) (25 μg/ml). Anaerobic cultures for NO evolution experiments and Western blots were grown in 16-ml screw-cap glass tubes filled to the brim with media. Cultures were incubated overnight in LB containing 100 mm (NO3−) (two tubes for each strain). Cells were harvested by centrifugation (10 min, 5500 rpm, 4 °C) and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, and then suspended in PBS to a final volume of 1.0 ml. Cells for Western blots were resuspended in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Anaerobic cultures for cytochrome c552 assays were grown in 500-ml Duran bottles, filled to the brim (total volume 620 ml), for 24 h to stationary phase of growth.TABLE 1Bacterial strains used in this studyS. typhimuriumGenotypeSource/Ref.Strains 14028sWild-type3Crawford M.J.

The CmR gene from pACYC184 was PCR-amplified with primers having 40 bp of both 5′- and 3′-flanking complementarity to the S. typhimurium nrfA gene. The linear DNA fragment was electroporated into wild-type S. typhimurium carrying pTP223 and transformants selected on nutrient agar containing Cm (final concentration 25 μg/ml). Putative mutants were picked the following day and verified by PCR amplification of the nrfA region. The mutation was transduced into a clean wild-type background using P22 (34Maloy S.R. Stewart V.J. Taylor R.K. Genetic Analysis of Pathogenic Bacteria: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996Google Scholar), selecting for CmR. The CmR marker was also inserted into the nirB gene using the same methods.P22 Transduction—Lysates were prepared as described previously (34Maloy S.R. Stewart V.J. Taylor R.K. Genetic Analysis of Pathogenic Bacteria: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996Google Scholar). Overnight cultures of strains were grown in LB. Aliquots (100 μl) of the recipient were then mixed with 10 μl of donor lysate for 12 min at 37 °C. LB (0.9 ml) containing EGTA (10 mm, final concentration) was added, and the tubes were incubated for a further 18 min. Cells were pelleted by brief centrifugation, and the cells were resuspended in ∼300 μl of the supernatant. Aliquots (100 μl) of the transduction mixture were then plated onto NA supplemented with Cm to a final concentration of 25 μg/ml. After an overnight incubation, any putative transductant colonies were re-streaked, and the mutation was confirmed by PCR.Western Blots—Western blots were carried out exactly as described previously (6Gilberthorpe N.J.

Cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in 10 ml of membrane buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl containing 2 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.5) and lysed by French pressing. Debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and the supernatant (containing membranes) transferred to an ultracentrifuge tube. Crude extracts were ultracentrifuged for 1 h at 225,000 × g, 4 °C. The membrane pellet was washed in membrane buffer and ultracentrifugation was repeated. The final membrane pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of buffer.Cytochrome Assays—Difference spectra (CO + reduced minus reduced) of washed membranes were recorded essentially as described (35Kalnenieks U. Galinina N. Bringer-Meyer S. Poole R.K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 168: 91-97PubMed Google Scholar) in a Johnson Foundation SDB3 dual-wavelength scanning spectrophotometer at room temperature. Samples were reduced with dithionite, bubbled with CO for 2.5 min, and used to record spectra in cells of 10-mm path length. After treatment with CO, samples were scanned successively until no further CO-induced changes were observed to allow for slow CO reactivity in such anoxically grown cells. Other scan conditions were as described before (35Kalnenieks U. Galinina N. Bringer-Meyer S. Poole R.K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 168: 91-97PubMed Google Scholar). For quantifying cytochrome bo′, we used ϵ = 145 mm–1 cm–1 (416–430 nm) (36Kita K. Konishi K. Anraku Y. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 94-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c552 concentrations in periplasmic fractions were determined spectroscopically as described previously (11Corker H. Poole R.K. J. Biol.

The protein contents of membranes, periplasmic fractions, and cleared supernatant fractions from sonicated cells were measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit and bovine serum albumin as the standard.NO Evolution and O2 Measurements—Concentrations of dissolved oxygen and NO were measured in a Clark-type polarographic oxygen electrode system (Rank Bros., Bottisham, Cambridge, UK) modified to accommodate a World Precision Instruments ISO NOP sensor (2-mm diameter) (38Mills C.E. Sedelnikova S. Soballe B. Hughes M.N. Poole R.K. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Cell suspension was diluted in the chamber (final volume 2 ml) with PBS buffer. Sodium formate (final concentration 25 mm) was used to induce rapid depletion of oxygen in preparation for anaerobic experiments, and a final concentration of 5 mm was used to allow slower reduction of oxygen in aerobic NO evolution experiments. Membrane suspensions were diluted in the chamber in membrane buffer, and 6 mm NADH (final concentration) was added to induce rapid oxygen uptake. For anaerobic NO evolution experiments, a close-fitting lid, with a fine hole for injections using a Hamilton syringe, was inserted. When respiration had reduced oxygen to the required level, the suspension was supplemented with an anoxic solution of NaNO2 to a final concentration of 25 mm, and NO evolution was then measured. NaNO2 solutions were made anoxic by bubbling the solution with argon for 20–30 min. For aerobic NO evolution experiments, an open electrode chamber was used, in which the stirred sample was open to the atmosphere, allowing continuous oxygen diffusion from the vortex surface into the sample, and prolonged measurements to be made without oxygen depletion. The O2 transfer constant K was determined from the observed half-time of the first-order equilibration of liquid (made anoxic with a few grains of sodium dithionite) with atmospheric oxygen (39Poole R.K. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1977; 99: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A value of K = 0.36 min–1 was assumed under these conditions of temperature and stirring rate. The O2 electrode was calibrated using air-equilibrated PBS and the addition of sodium dithionite (a few grains) to achieve anoxia. The NO electrode was calibrated by addition of known concentrations of NaNO2 to an acidified potassium iodide solution as described by the manufacturer. Additions of anoxic, NO-saturated solutions, NaNO2 and 3.75 mm c-PTIO (Calbiochem), were made using Hamilton syringes. NO was generated exactly as in Ref. 40Poole R.K. Anjum M.F.

A stock solution of 0.5 m NaNO2 was freshly made each day in a bottle fitted with a rubber septum (“Suba-seal,” VWR International); argon gas was bubbled through the solution for 20–30 min, making it anoxic.RESULTSNO Production by S. typhimurium and the Role of Hmp in NO Homeostasis—S. typhimurium strains were grown anaerobically overnight in the presence of 100 mm (NO3−). S. typhimurium wild-type and hmp mutant strains grew similarly in these conditions (data not shown), whereas in E. coli growth of the hmp mutant is poor compared with the wild-type strain (11Corker H. Poole R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31584-31592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested, resuspended in PBS, and added to oxygenated PBS in a closed oxygen electrode chamber with formate as electron donor. When oxygen levels fell to zero, NaNO2 was added (final concentration 25 mm), and NO evolution was followed. Fig. 1A shows a typical NO production trace for the 14028s wild-type strain; NO production was observed for 10–30 min before the levels of NO reached a plateau, typically at around 30 μm, but small daily variations were seen (Fig. 1B). Cultures grown anaerobically in the presence of 50 mm fumarate in place of (NO3−) were unable to produce NO from (NO2−) (Fig. 1B), indicating that the factor responsible for NO evolution is not expressed under these growth conditions. (NO2−) (12.5 mm) also caused NO evolution to similar levels (Fig. 1C). Lowering the concentration further to 6.25 mm (NO2−) led to a disproportionate decline in NO evolution (Fig. 1C). The small rise in oxygen levels recorded (Fig. 1A) during the experiment is attributed to oxygen diffusion into the chamber through the small injection holes. To verify that the response seen by the ISO-NOP electrode was because of production of NO, the NO scavenging compound, c-PTIO, was added to the chamber; a rapid fall in NO was sensed by the electrode (Fig. 1, A and C). In contrast with E. coli, the S. typhimurium hmp mutant was able to produce NO under anaerobic conditions with very similar NO production profiles to the wild-type strain (Fig. 1B).Because of the key roles of FNR in activating the pathways of anaerobic respiration, we tested an fnr mutant for its ability to generate NO from (NO2−) under identical conditions to those shown in Fig. 1A; NO production did not occur (Fig. 1B). As FNR is a negative regulator of hmp transcription (18Cruz-Ramos H. Crack J. Wu G. Hughes M.N. Scott C. Thomson A.J. Green J. Poole R.K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3235-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 40Poole R.K. Anjum M.F. Membrillo-Hernandez J. Kim S.O. Hughes M.N. Stewart V. J.

Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 1845-1855Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), one reason for lack of NO production may be high levels of NO detoxification by Hmp, albeit under the anoxic conditions used for the assays (38Mills C.E. Sedelnikova S. Soballe B. Hughes M.N. Poole R.K. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 42Hausladen A. Gow A.J. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To determine the effects of FNR on Hmp levels, Western blot analysis was carried out on wild-type, hmp, and fnr mutant strains following overnight growth of anaerobic cultures in LB containing 100 mm (NO3−). Higher levels of Hmp expression in the fnr mutant compared with the wild-type strain were confirmed (data not shown).When NO evolution assays were carried out in the presence of oxygen, i.e. under conditions where Hmp is most active (38Mills C.E. Sedelnikova S. Soballe B. Hughes M.N. Poole R.K. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the wild-type strain did not show NO production (data not shown). These results suggest that wild-type levels of Hmp are sufficient to prevent aerobic NO accumulation. Note that under the conditions used for growth, i.e. anoxically in the presence of (NO3−), hmp transcription is markedly up-regulated (40Poole R.K. Anjum M.F. Membrillo-Hernandez J. Kim S.O. Hughes M.N. Stewart V. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5487-5492Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of Hmp, we next assayed NO production in an hmp mutant. In these experiments, an “open” electrode system was used, and addition of 25 mm (NO2−) was made at ∼25% of saturated oxygen levels. Under these conditions, a rapid phase of NO production was observed on (NO2−) addition (Fig. 2). Indeed, the concentration of NO evolution by the hmp strain aerobically was over 10-fold greater than anaerobically (Fig. 1B). We attribute this to the combined effect of (i) the lack of NorV activity aerobically (44Gardner A.M. Helmick R.A. Gardner P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8172-8177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and (ii) the deletion of Hmp. Because the electrode system was open to the atmosphere, the abrupt inhibition of respiration by the added (NO2−) or the NO formed caused an increase in the steady-state O2 level, as evidenced by the sharp rise in the O2 trace (Fig. 2). Approximately 2–3 min after the detection of NO, the NO electrode signal declined, presumably because of nonenzymic reaction with O2 whose concentration rises during this period (Fig. 2). Collectively, these results demonstrate that aerobically, but not anaerobically, Hmp activity is sufficient to consume the NO generated by (NO2−) reduction; however, these experiments do not identify the reductase responsible.FIGURE 2NO production by an hmp mutant strain under aerobic conditions.

Transfer of the mutation was confirmed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Results showed that, even in the absence of hmp, NO production could not be detected from the fnr mutant (data not shown). This clearly indicates that it is not enhanced levels of Hmp that cause the fnr mutant strain to lack the observed NO-producing ability but rather the failure in the mutant to express the NO-producing prote"

PAF is biosynthesized through two independent pathways called the de novo and remodeling pathways. Lyso-PAF acetyltransferase (lyso-PAF AT) was believed to biosynthesize PAF under inflammatory conditions, through the remodeling pathway. The first isolated lyso-PAF AT (LysoPAFAT/LPCAT2) had consistent properties. However, we show in this study the finding of a second lyso-PAF AT working under noninflammatory conditions. We partially purified a Ca2+-independent lyso-PAF AT from mouse lung. Immunoreactivity for lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 1 (LPCAT1) was detected in the active fraction. Lpcat1-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells exhibited both LPCAT and lyso-PAF AT activities. We confirmed that LPCAT1 transfers acetate from acetyl-CoA to lyso-PAF by the identification of an acetyl-CoA (and other acyl-CoAs) interacting site in LPCAT1. We further showed that LPCAT1 activity and expression are independent of inflammatory signals. Therefore, these results suggest the molecular diversity of lyso-PAF ATs is as follows: one (LysoPAFAT/LPCAT2) is inducible and activated by inflammatory stimulation, and the other (LPCAT1) is constitutively expressed. Each lyso-PAF AT biosynthesizes inflammatory and physiological amounts of PAF, depending on the cell type.

Under noninflammatory circumstances, PAF plays roles in several physiological processes such as glycogen degradation of fetal lung (11Hoffman D.R. White R.G. Angle M.J. Maki N. Johnston J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9316-9319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), fertility (12Krausz C. Gervasi G. Forti G. Baldi E. Hum.

Neurophysiol. 2001; 85: 384-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Similarly to PC, PAF is biosynthesized by the de novo and remodeling pathways. In the remodeling pathway, alkyl-PC is cleaved at its sn-2 position by PLA2, generating lyso-PAF (alkyl-LPC). Among PLA2s, cytosolic PLA2α (cPLA2α) plays a major role in PAF production of inflammatory cells (14Shindou H. Ishii S. Uozumi N. Shimizu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 812-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). PAF is then biosynthesized from lyso-PAF by lyso-PAF acetyltransferase (lyso-PAF AT) (EC 2.3.1.67) (15Wykle R.L. Malone B. Snyder F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10256-10260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was long thought that PAF production occurs through the remodeling pathway under inflammatory conditions, whereas the de novo pathway produces physiological (noninflammatory) PAF (as summarized in Fig. 5E, upper panel) (4Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 419-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 16Snyder F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1254: 231-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that endogenous lyso-PAF AT activity is enhanced by several inflammatory stimuli, probably both by post-translational modifications and by mRNA induction (17Shindou H. Ishii S. Yamamoto M. Takeda K. Akira S. Shimizu T. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 1177-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This activity was shown to be Ca2+-dependent (18Domenech C. Machado-De Domenech E. Söling H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5671-5676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Gómez-Cambronero J. Nieto M.L. Mato J.M. Sánchez-Crespo M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 845: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We recently reported the cDNA cloning of a lyso-PAF AT, LysoPAFAT/LPCAT2. This enzyme has both lyso-PAF AT and LPCAT activities in the presence of Ca2+ (20Shindou H. Hishikawa D. Nakanishi H. Harayama T. Ishii S. Taguchi R. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6532-6539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The lyso-PAF AT activity and the mRNA level of LysoPAFAT/LPCAT2 are enhanced by various stimuli, consistently with the endogenous lyso-PAF AT activity in inflammatory cells. However, it was unknown whether additional lyso-PAF AT(s) exist. The gene with the highest homology to Lysopafat/Lpcat2 is Lpcat1 (21Nakanishi H. Shindou H. Hishikawa D. Harayama T. Ogasawara R. Suwabe A. Taguchi R. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20140-20147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). LPCAT1 is thought to be involved in the biosynthesis of pulmonary surfactant lipids based on several experimental observations as follows: substrate preference for medium-chain saturated acyl-CoAs to produce disaturated PC, high expression in alveolar type II cells, and a robust induction at the perinatal period (21Nakanishi H. Shindou H. Hishikawa D. Harayama T. Ogasawara R. Suwabe A. Taguchi R. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20140-20147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 22Chen X.

Both LPCAT1 and LysoPAFAT/LPCAT2 are members of the lysophospholipid acyltransferase family. The members of this family contain four conserved acyltransferase motifs (motifs 1–4) (23Lewin T.M. Wang P. Coleman R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5764-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Although several studies were performed based on site-directed mutagenesis using other lysophospholipid acyltransferases, the precise role of each motif is not yet clear (23Lewin T.M. Wang P. Coleman R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5764-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 24Dircks L.K. Ke J. Sul H.S. J. Biol.

Acta. 2007; 1771: 1202-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Here we show the finding of a novel Ca2+-independent lyso-PAF AT activity in the murine lung, mediated by LPCAT1. Depending on the substrate concentration, LPCAT1 recognizes a wide range of acyl-CoAs as substrates, ranging from acetyl-CoA to palmitoyl-CoA. We further characterized the nature of this substrate specificity by site-directed mutagenesis and identified several amino acid residues responsible for acyl-CoA (including acetyl-CoA) binding. We investigated the role of LPCAT1 in PAF biosynthesis and showed that LPCAT1 is neither activated nor up-regulated at the mRNA level by inflammatory stimuli, in contrast to LysoPAFAT/LPCAT2. Thus, LPCAT1 may be involved in the noninflammatory PAF production. This relationship is similar to that of the two cyclooxygenases (COXs). COX-1 is constitutive and exerts protective functions, whereas COX-2 is induced in inflammation and plays many pathological roles (26Smith W.L. Langenbach R. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 1491-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Our findings show the existence of a noninflammatory remodeling pathway involved in PAF biosynthesis. The enzymes involved in each remodeling pathway were expressed differently depending on the cell type. We propose that PAF is mainly biosynthesized by cPLA2α and LysoPAFAT/LPCAT2 in the inflammatory remodeling pathway, whereas PLA2s and LPCAT1 produce PAF in the noninflammatory remodeling pathway. Thus, the classical hypothesis needs some revision, and physiological levels of PAF may be produced not only through the de novo pathway but also through the noninflammatory remodeling pathway.

After centrifugation for 10 min at 9,000 × g, the supernatant was collected and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 300 mm sucrose, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 μm APMSF and 1× Complete. Partial Purification of Murine Ca2+-independent Lyso-PAF AT—The microsomal fraction of lung was solubilized with 0.5% BIGCHAP (w/v) for 40 min and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant of this centrifugation was designated solubilized microsomes.

Proteins were eluted by a 160–500 mm linear gradient of NaCl. Measurement of Lyso-PAF AT and LPCAT Activities—Lyso-PAF AT and LPCAT activities were measured as described previously, using microplate chromatography or thin layer chromatography (20Shindou H.

Shimizu T. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 246: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). For the measurement of lyso-PAF AT activity, the protein was incubated with 0–200 μm [3H]acetyl-CoA (1.11 GBq/mmol) and 20 μm lyso-PAF in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm CaCl2, 20 μm APMSF, 1× Complete, and 1 mg/ml PC. Eventually, EDTA, CoCl2, CuCl2, FeCl2, MgCl2, or MnCl2 was used instead of CaCl2 in some experiments. For the measurement of LPCAT activity, protein was incubated with 0–200 μm acyl-CoA and 50 μm LPC in a buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mg/ml PC. As radiolabeled substrate, [14C]palmitoyl-CoA or [14C]palmitoyl-LPC was utilized. Production of Anti-LysoPAFAT/LPCAT2 and Anti-LPCAT1 Antisera—Antisera were generated at Immuno-Biological Laboratories (Gunma, Japan). C-terminal peptides were used for immunization of rabbits (Lyso-PAFAT/LPCAT2, SNKVSPESQEEGTSDKKVD, and LPCAT1, EMYPDYAEDYLYPDQTHFDS). Specificity of the antisera was examined by Western blot using microsomes from vector-, Lysopafat/Lpcat2-, or Lpcat1-transfected cells. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (21Nakanishi H. Shindou H. Hishikawa D. Harayama T. Ogasawara R. Suwabe A. Taguchi R. Shimizu T. J. Biol.

Isolation and Stimulation of Mouse Peritoneal Cells—Mouse peritoneal macrophages induced by thioglycolate were prepared as described previously (17Shindou H. Ishii S. Yamamoto M. Takeda K. Akira S. Shimizu T. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 1177-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The cells were treated with 100 ng/ml LPS, 0.8 μm CpG oligonucleotide (ODN) 1826, or 1 μg/ml polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) for 16 h. Cells were then washed with ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 300 mm sucrose. Total RNAs were then extracted and subsequently used for the synthesis of first-strand cDNA. Isolation of Rat Alveolar Type II Cells and Macrophages—Alveolar type II cells were isolated by the method of Dobbs and Mason (30Dobbs L.G. Mason R.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1979; 63: 378-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), as described previously (21Nakanishi H. Shindou H. Hishikawa D. Harayama T. Ogasawara R. Suwabe A. Taguchi R. Shimizu T. J.

Alveolar macrophages for RNA extraction were recovered from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of 7-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats were anesthetized and euthanized, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was obtained by four times lavage using phosphate-buffered saline. A part of the cells was cytocentrifuged with Cytospin 3 at 200 rpm for 2 min and stained with Diff-Quick confirming that >90% of the cells were macrophages. Quantitative PCR—Quantitative PCR experiments were performed as described previously (21Nakanishi H. Shindou H. Hishikawa D. Harayama T. Ogasawara R. Suwabe A. Taguchi R. Shimizu T. J. Biol.

The primers used are indicated in the supplemental material. Software—All statistical calculations were performed using Prism 4 (GraphPad Software). Edmundson wheel analysis was performed using GENETYX-MAC version 13.0.6 (Genetyx Corp.). Identification of a Ca2+-independent Lyso-PAF AT Activity—To characterize PAF biosynthesis in mice, we measured lyso-PAF acetyltransferase activities in lung, spleen, brain, liver, and kidney microsomes in the presence of EDTA or Ca2+. Consistently with the expression pattern of Lysopafat/Lpcat2 (20Shindou H. Hishikawa D. Nakanishi H. Harayama T. Ishii S. Taguchi R. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6532-6539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), high lyso-PAF AT activity was observed in spleen microsomes in the presence of Ca2+, which was inhibited by EDTA (Ca2+-dependent lyso-PAF AT activity) (Fig. 1A). The Ca2+-dependent lyso-PAF AT activity was weaker in brain and liver microsomes and not detectable in kidney microsomes. Surprisingly, EDTA did not inhibit lyso-PAF AT activity in lung microsomes, indicating the presence of a Ca2+-independent lyso-PAF AT (Fig. 1A). Partial Purification of LPCAT1 as a Lyso-PAF AT—We next tried to identify the Ca2+-independent lyso-PAF AT by partial purification. After solubilization (with 0.5% (w/v) BIGCHAP), lung microsomes retained the Ca2+-independent lyso-PAF AT activity (Fig. 1C). Solubilized microsomes were applied on a DEAE-Sepharose column and fractionated (Fig. 1B). For each fraction, Ca2+-independent lyso-PAF AT activity was measured. The activity was detected from fractions 10 to 13 (Fig. 1C). We performed Western blot using anti-LysoPAFAT/LPCAT2 antiserum. Two major bands appeared in the spleen microsomes and the solubilized lung microsomes, the lower one having the size expected from the primary sequence of LysoPAFAT/LPCAT2 (60 kDa). However, the 60-kDa band was barely detected after fractionation (Fig. 1D). Thus, the proteins exhibiting immunoreactivity against LysoPAFAT/LPCAT2 were different from that with Ca2+-independent lyso-PAF AT activity (Fig. 1, C and D). We performed similar experiments using anti-LPCAT1 antiserum, because LPCAT1 possesses the highest homology (48.2%) to LysoPAFAT/LPCAT2. The immunoreactivity was present in fractions 10–14, with similarity to the Ca2+-independent lyso-PAF AT activity (Fig. 1, C and E), suggesting that LPCAT1 might be the Ca2+-independent lyso-PAF AT in lung. To obtain more direct evidence for the lyso-PAF AT activity in LPCAT1, microsomes were prepared from Lpcat1- or vector-transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells, and lyso-PAF AT activity was measured. Lpcat1-transfected cells had a higher lyso-PAF AT activity than the control cells, indicating that LPCAT1 is the Ca2+-independent lyso-PAF AT partially purified from murine lung (Fig. 2A). Characterization of LPCAT1 as a Lyso-PAF AT—We characterized kinetic properties of LPCAT1. The apparent Km values for acetyl-CoA and lyso-PAF were 82.4–128.2 and 7.9–18.4 μm, respectively (supplemental Fig. 1, A and B). Lyso-PAF AT activity of LPCAT1 was similar with or without Ca2+ (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, the activity of LysoPAFAT/LPCAT2 was detected in the presence of Ca2+ but not EDTA (Fig. 2A). The activity of LPCAT1 was not influenced by the presence of Co2+, Mg2+, or Mn2+, whereas Cu2+ and Fe2+ inhibited it. The activity of LysoPAFAT/LPCAT2 was detected in the presence of Co2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, or Mn2+ but not Cu2+ (Fig. 2A). The activity of LPCAT1 was unaltered by the presence of dithiothreitol, but the activity of LysoPAFAT/LPCAT2 was 2-fold increased (supplemental Fig. 1C). The pH optimum for LPCAT1 activity was around pH 7.5 (supplemental Fig. 1D). We next investigated the lysophospholipid preference of LPCAT1. LPCAT1 showed high activity toward alkyl-LPC (C16), acyl-LPC (C16), and alkenyl-LPC (mixture). The activity was lower for acyl-LPC (C18) and not significant for alkyl-LPC (C18) (Fig. 2B). Thus, LPCAT1 can synthesize PAF (C16) much more efficiently than PAF (C18). Acetyltransferase activity of LPCAT1 had not been reported previously, probably because of the concentration of acetyl-CoA used (21Nakanishi H. Shindou H. Hishikawa D. Harayama T. Ogasawara R. Suwabe A. Taguchi R. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20140-20147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 22Chen X. Hyatt B.A. Mucenski M.L. Mason R.J. Shannon J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 11724-11729Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Thus, we measured acyltransferase activities of LPCAT1 with two different concentrations (10 and 200 μm) of various acyl-CoAs (C2 to C20) as acyl donors. At 10 μm acyl-CoA, LPCAT1 utilized all saturated acyl-CoAs ranging from hexanoyl-CoA (C6) to palmitoyl-CoA (C16) as substrates, and the maximal activity was observed for decanoyl-CoA (C10) (Fig. 2C). On the other hand, at 200 μm acyl-CoA, the substrate preference of LPCAT1 shifted to shorter chain acyl-CoAs (Fig. 2D). Similarly to our previous report, LPCAT1 showed no acetyltransferase activity, at the substrate concentration of 10 μm (Fig. 2C). However, we could detect the activity for acetyl-CoA (C2) at 200 μm, as expected from the result shown in supplemental Fig. 1A. Activity for butanoyl-CoA (C4) was also seen, but it was not significantly different from that in vector-transfected cells. Thus, LPCAT1 recognizes a wide range of acyl-CoAs (from C2 to C16) and exerts acetyltransferase activity at a high concentration of acetyl-CoA. Analysis of Conserved Motifs in LPCAT1—To prove that the wide range of acyltransferase activity seen in Lpcat1-transfected cells is directly exerted by LPCAT1, we tried to characterize the recognition sites of acyl-CoAs in LPCAT1. Because acyl-CoA recognition may be a common characteristic of acyltransferases, we hypothesized that some of the acyltransferase motifs may play roles in acyl-CoA recognition. We compared the sequences of the following lysophospholipid acyltransferases: glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 1, lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase α and β, lysophosphatidylglycerol acyltransferase 1, and lysocardiolipin acyltransferase 1. From the aligned sequences of these enzymes, conserved His135 and Asp140 in motif 1 and Glu208 and Gly209 in motif 3 were found in LPCAT1. The amino acids in motif 2 were less conserved, and the following three regions were candidates for motif 2 in LPCAT1: from Gly164 to Arg168, from Gly164 to Arg171, and from Phe174 to Arg177. Motif 4 consists of a conserved Pro surrounded by hydrophobic amino acids. Three Pro residues in LPCAT1, namely Pro227, Pro230 and Pro233, fulfilled this criterion (Fig. 3A). We next investigated the effects of the deletion of each motif on the activity of LPCAT1. Each motif region (from His135 to Asp140, from Gly164 to Arg177, from Ile203 to Gly209, and from Pro227 to Pro233) was deleted from LPCAT1, generating mutants del1, del2, del3, and del4. Each mutant was transfected into CHO-K1 cells, and the expression was examined by Western blot. Each mutant was expressed but was weaker than wild type LPCAT1 (WT) (supplemental Fig. 2A). Lyso-PAF AT and LPCAT activities were then measured by thin layer chromatography analyses. Lyso-PAF AT and LPCAT activities were abolished in these deletion mutants (supplemental Fig. 2B). We then examined the effect of point mutations in each motif. We generated mutants H135A and D140A in motif 1; G164A, R168A, R171A, F174A, and R177A in motif 2; E208A and G209A in motif 3; and P227A, P230A, and P233A in motif 4. Each mutant was transfected into CHO-K1 cells, and the expression was detected by Western blot. The expression levels of D140A, R171A, F174A, E208A, and P233A decreased, whereas those of other mutants were similar to that of WT (supplemental Fig. 2, C–F). For each mutant, we measured lyso-PAF AT (1-hexadecyl-lyso-PAF and acetyl-CoA as substrates) and LPCAT (1-myristoyl-LPC and palmitoyl-CoA as substrates) activities relative to WT (hereafter, we will refer these relative activities as “remaining activity”). H135A, D140A, and E208A had no remaining activity, whereas R168A, R171A, G209A, P227A, P230A, and P233A had partially remaining lyso-PAF AT and LPCAT activities (Fig. 3, B–E). Notably, in G164A, lyso-PAF AT activity was slightly increased (∼150%), but LPCAT activity was similar to WT (∼100%). F174A and R177A had no detectable lyso-PAF AT activity (<10%), whereas LPCAT activity was only partially diminished (∼40%) (Fig. 3C). Analysis of Motif 2 in LPCAT1—We investigated further lyso-PAF AT and LPCAT activities in F174A and R177A. The relative lyso-PAF AT and LPCAT activities were not affected by reaction buffers, lysophospholipid species (lyso-PAF and LPC), or acyl-chain length at the sn-1 position of LPC (C14 and C16) (data not shown). However, the relative activity for acetyl-CoA was different from that for palmitoyl-CoA (Fig. 3C and Fig. 4A). We measured LPCAT activities of F174A and R177A for various chain length acyl-CoAs (C2 to C16). The substrate concentrations were 200 μm for short-chain acyl-CoAs (C2 to C8), and 10 μm for medium-chain acyl-CoAs (C10 to C16). The remaining LPCAT activities in F174A and R177A were higher for longer acyl-CoAs as substrates (Fig. 4A). We confirmed that such relationships were found in several concentrations of acyl-CoAs (supplemental Fig. 3, A–C). Thus, the preference of F174A and R177A for longer chain acyl-CoA was not because of substrate concentration but because of acyl chain length. These results suggest that mutations in motif 2 modulate acyl-CoA selectivity. Motif 2 of LPCAT1 contains many hydrophobic amino acids conserved among species, thus these residues may interact with acyl-CoA (Fig. 4B and supplemental Fig. 4A). The hydrophobic region (from Trp163 to Tyr169) was predicted to form an α-helix using the PredictProtein Server (31Rost B. Yachdav G. Liu J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W321-W326Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). When this hydrophobic region (in this example, Ile162 to Arg171) is illustrated by an Edmundson wheel representation (32Schiffer M. Edmundson A.B. Biophys. J. 1967; 7: 121-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar), all hydrophobic residues are located at one side (Fig. 4B). This suggests that this region forms an α-helix, and the hydrophobic residues are located favorably to interact with the acyl chain. To investigate their roles in acyl-CoA interaction, we constructed mutants of each hydrophobic residue (I160A, I162A, W163A, L166A, I167"
https://openalex.org/W2162347651,"Inhibitors of coagulation factors from blood-feeding animals display a wide variety of structural motifs and inhibition mechanisms. We have isolated a novel inhibitor from the cattle tick Boophilus microplus, one of the most widespread parasites of farm animals. The inhibitor, which we have termed boophilin, has been cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Mature boophilin is composed of two canonical Kunitz-type domains, and inhibits not only the major procoagulant enzyme, thrombin, but in addition, and by contrast to all other previously characterised natural thrombin inhibitors, significantly interferes with the proteolytic activity of other serine proteinases such as trypsin and plasmin. The crystal structure of the bovine α-thrombin·boophilin complex, refined at 2.35 Å resolution reveals a non-canonical binding mode to the proteinase. The N-terminal region of the mature inhibitor, Q16-R17-N18, binds in a parallel manner across the active site of the proteinase, with the guanidinium group of R17 anchored in the S1 pocket, while the C-terminal Kunitz domain is negatively charged and docks into the basic exosite I of thrombin. This binding mode resembles the previously characterised thrombin inhibitor, ornithodorin which, unlike boophilin, is composed of two distorted Kunitz modules. Unexpectedly, both boophilin domains adopt markedly different orientations when compared to those of ornithodorin, in its complex with thrombin. The N-terminal boophilin domain rotates 9° and is displaced by 6 Å, while the C-terminal domain rotates almost 6° accompanied by a 3 Å displacement. The reactive-site loop of the N-terminal Kunitz domain of boophilin with its P1 residue, K31, is fully solvent exposed and could thus bind a second trypsin-like proteinase without sterical restraints. This finding explains the formation of a ternary thrombin·boophilin·trypsin complex, and suggests a mechanism for prothrombinase inhibition in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2012745970,"Glucose-induced insulin exocytosis is coupled to associations between F-actin and SNARE proteins, although the nature and function of these interactions remains unknown. Toward this end we show here that both Syntaxin 1A and Syntaxin 4 associated with F-actin in MIN6 cells and that each interaction was rapidly and transiently diminished by stimulation of cells with d-glucose. Of the two isoforms, only Syntaxin 4 was capable of interacting directly with F-actin in an in vitro sedimentation assay, conferred by the N-terminal 39-112 residues of Syntaxin 4. The 39-112 fragment was capable of selective competitive inhibitory action, disrupting endogenous F-actin-Syntaxin 4 binding in MIN6 cells. Disruption of F-actin-Syntaxin 4 binding correlated with enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, mediated by increased granule accumulation at the plasma membrane and increased Syntaxin 4 accessibility under basal conditions. However, no increase in basal level Syntaxin 4-VAMP2 association occurred with either latrunculin treatment or expression of the 39-112 fragment. Taken together, these data disclose a new underlying mechanism by which F-actin negatively regulates exocytosis via binding and blocking Syntaxin 4 accessibility, but they also reveal the existence of additional signals and/or steps required to trigger the subsequent docking and fusion steps of exocytosis.

Insulin granules are exocytosed in two distinct phases. First-phase insulin granule release involves the rapid fusion of a small pool of granules that are already present at the plasma membrane under basal conditions, termed the readily releasable pool, and these granules will discharge their cargo in response to nutrient and also non-nutrient secretagogues (1Barg S.

In contrast, second-phase secretion is evoked only in response to nutrients and involves additional steps such as the mobilization of intracellular storage granules, targeting of granules to SNARE 3The abbreviations used are: SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescence protein; MKRBB, modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer; PM, plasma membrane; SG, storage granule; Cyt, cytosol; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; GST, glutathione S-transferase. 3The abbreviations used are: SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescence protein; MKRBB, modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer; PM, plasma membrane; SG, storage granule; Cyt, cytosol; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; GST, glutathione S-transferase. sites for docking and fusion steps of exocytosis and insulin release. Remarkably, although the actin cytoskeleton has been considered to play a principle regulatory role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion since 1968 (5Lacy P.E. Howell S.L. Young D.A. Fink C.J.

Diabetes. 1972; 21: 987-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), the lack of mechanistic data has impeded the inclusion of cytoskeletal input into models detailing the regulation of biphasic insulin release.F-actin was originally shown to function as a “cell web” in islet beta cells (7Kelly R.B. Cell. 1990; 61: 5-7Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 8Malaisse W.J. Malaisse-Lagae F. Van Obberghen E. Somers G. Devis G. Ravazzola M. Orci L. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Orci L. Malaisse W.J. Endocrinology. 1979; 104: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This notion was consistent with observations from other cell types and led to the concept that cytoskeletal disruption serves as a mechanism to clear away the F-actin barrier and permit access of granules to the plasma membrane (11Aunis D.

However this model did not suffice to explain why insulin granule transport still requires F-actin as a motive force (9Orci L. Gabbay K.H. Malaisse W.J.

Distinct from neurotransmitter exocytosis or GLUT4 translocation events that are impacted by F-actin, insulin release occurs over a long time period and in discrete phases, requiring the readily releasable pool of granules at the plasma membrane to be refilled from the more intracellular storage pool in a carefully metered manner. More recently, glucose-induced F-actin remodeling in beta cells has been visualized by dynamic changes in cortical F-actin (20Nevins A.K. Thurmond D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C698-C710Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 21Thurmond D.C. Gonelle-Gispert C. Furukawa M. Halban P.A. Pessin J.E. Mol.

No changes in the F/G-actin ratio were detected, indicating that the F-actin was being remodeled and reorganized as opposed to a general loss of cellular F-actin content in response to glucose. Remodeling occurred specifically in response to d-glucose, and not l-glucose or KCl stimulation, and was coupled to SNARE protein-mediated exocytosis.Insulin granule exocytosis requires two syntaxin isoforms: Syntaxin 1A and Syntaxin 4. Syntaxin 1A null mouse islets show significantly fewer predocked granules, which support first-phase insulin release in response to calcium influx, although second-phase secretion is normal (24Ohara-Imaizumi M. Fujiwara T. Nakamichi Y. Okamura T. Akimoto Y. Kawai J. Matsushima S. Kawakami H. Watanabe T. Akagawa K. Nagamatsu S. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 695-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Syntaxin 4 heterozygous knock-out mouse islets show decreased first-phase secretion and also a slight decrease in second-phase secretion (25Spurlin B.A. Thurmond D.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition, Syntaxin 4 overexpressing transgenic mouse islets have enhanced second-phase secretion (25Spurlin B.A. Thurmond D.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Other cell systems that utilize multiple syntaxins show partitioning of interactions and localization to particular membrane compartments to achieve differential modes of vesicle targeting and fusion (26Low S.H.

Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5784-5792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Characterization of unique features of Syntaxin 1A and Syntaxin 4 will be required before a mechanistic understanding of their different roles in biphasic insulin release can be discerned.We have previously demonstrated that, in rodent islet beta cells, glucose-induced insulin exocytosis is coupled to the interaction of F-actin with t-SNARE proteins (21Thurmond D.C. Gonelle-Gispert C. Furukawa M. Halban P.A. Pessin J.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Here, we have demonstrated the relevance of this to human islet function and expanded upon the underlying mechanism by showing that F-actin bound directly to a novel motif in the N terminus of Syntaxin 4. We found that competitive inhibition of the direct association between F-actin-Syntaxin 4 increased unstimulated granule accumulation at the plasma membrane as well as Syntaxin 4 accessibility to VAMP2. Interestingly however, VAMP2 association with syntaxin was not increased upon release of F-actin binding from Syntaxin 4, suggesting the requirement for an additional stimulus-dependent/induced step that precedes the docking and fusion steps in exocytosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Rabbit polyclonal Syntaxin 4 and mouse monoclonal Syntaxin 1 antibodies were obtained from Chemicon (Temecula, CA) and Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), respectively. The mouse anti-insulin and rabbit anti-actin antibodies were obtained from Sigma. Rabbit anti-GFP antibody was acquired from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Monoclonal anti-SNAP-25 and anti-GFP antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences/Clontech. The mouse monoclonal anti-VAMP2 antibody and recombinant soluble Syntaxin 1A protein were obtained from Synaptic Systems (Gottingen, Germany). Latrunculin B was purchased from Calbiochem. Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody and control mouse and rabbit IgG for immunoprecipitation were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Radioimmunoassay-grade bovine serum albumin and d-glucose were purchased from Sigma. The MIN6 cells were a gift from Dr. John Hutton (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center). Goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies and TransFectin lipid reagent were acquired from Bio-Rad. ECL reagent was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The human C-peptide and rat insulin radioimmunoassay kits were purchased from Linco Research Inc. (St. Charles, MO). The actin binding spin-down assay and F/G-actin quantitation kits were purchased from Cytoskeleton (Denver, CO).Plasmids—pGEX-4T1-VAMP2-(1-94) was generated as described previously (28Nevins A.K. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1944-1952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The pGEX-4T1-Syntaxin 4-(1-193), -(1-112), and -(1-70) cDNA constructs were generated by subcloning PCR-generated rat Syntaxin 4 fragments into the SalI and XhoI sites of the pGEX-4T1 expression vector. The pGEX-4T1-Syntaxin 4-(1-273) and -(39-273) cDNA constructs were made by subcloning PCR-generated fragments into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pGEX-4T1. The pEGFP-Syntaxin 4-(39-112) cDNA construct was generated by subcloning the PCR-generated Syntaxin 4 fragment engineered with 5′-EcoRI and 3′-XhoI sites into the 5′-EcoRI and 3′-SalI sites of the EGFP-C2 vector (Clontech). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.Isolation, Culture, and Stimulation of Insulin Secretion of Mouse and Human Islets—Pancreatic mouse islets were isolated as previously described (29Lacy P.E. Kostianovsky M. Diabetes. 1967; 16: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (2474) Google Scholar, 30Spurlin B.A. Thomas R.M. Nevins A.K. Kim H.J. Noh H.J. Kim J.A. Shulman G.I. Thurmond D.C. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1910-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, pancreata from 8-12-week-old male mice were digested with collagenase and purified using a Ficoll density gradient. After isolation, islets were cultured overnight in CMRL-1066 medium. Fresh islets were handpicked into groups of 10, preincubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 134 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaHCO3, 4.8 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4) containing 2.8 mm glucose and 0.1% BSA for 1.5 h in the presence of 10 μm latrunculin or DMSO vehicle followed by stimulation with 20 mm glucose for 2 h. Medium was collected to measure insulin secretion, and islets were harvested in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer to determine cellular insulin content by radioimmunoassay. Human islets isolated from two independent nondiabetic donors were obtained through the National Institutes of Health/ICR (islet cell resource) distribution program, and used in experiments identical in design to those described above with mouse islets.Cell Culture, Transient Transfection, and Secretion Assays—MIN6 beta cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (25 mm glucose) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 292 μg/ml l-glutamine, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol as described previously (31Ke B. Oh E. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21786-21797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). MIN6 beta cells at ∼60% confluence were transfected with 40 μg of plasmid DNA/10-cm2 dish using TransFectin (Bio-Rad) to obtain ∼30-50% transfection efficiency. After 48 h of incubation, cells were washed twice with and incubated for 2 h in freshly prepared modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (MKRBB: 5 mm KCl, 120 mm NaCl, 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 24 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 1 mg/ml radioimmunoassay-grade BSA). Cells were stimulated with 20 mm glucose for the amount of time indicated in the figures after which the buffer was collected and microcentrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet cell debris, and insulin secreted into the buffer was quantitated using a rat insulin immunoassay kit (Linco Research). Cells were harvested in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin) containing 60 mm n-octylglucoside and lysed for 10 min at 4 °C, and lysates were cleared of insoluble material by microcentrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C for subsequent use in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. For measurement of human C-peptide release, MIN6 beta cells were transiently co-transfected with each plasmid plus human proinsulin cDNA (kind gift from Dr. Chris Newgard, Duke University). Forty-eight h after transfection, cells were preincubated for 2 h in MKRBB buffer and stimulated with 20 mm glucose for 1 h. MKRBB was collected for quantitation of human C-peptide released.Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—MIN6 cells at 40% confluency plated onto glass coverslips were preincubated in MKRBB in the absence or presence of latrunculin (10 μm) or vehicle (Me2SO) for 1-2 h followed by stimulation with 20 mm glucose for 5 min and then immediately fixed and permeabilized in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at 4 °C. Fixed cells were blocked in 1% BSA plus 5% donkey serum for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation with insulin antibody (1:100) for 1 h. MIN6 cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and incubated with anti-mouse Texas Red secondary antibody for 1 h. All cells were washed again in phosphate-buffered saline, overlaid with Vectashield mounting medium, and mounted for confocal fluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss 510 confocal microscope. EGFP and insulin-Texas Red fluorescing cells were imaged using single-channel scanning using a ×100 objective.Electron Microscopy—MIN6 beta cells were grown to ∼80% confluence on Thermonox coverslips. Cells were washed twice with and incubated for 2 h in freshly prepared modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer followed by the addition of either latrunculin B or Me2SO vehicle for an additional 30 min. Cells were fixed in a 0.1 m cacodylate-buffered mixture of 2% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C and then postfixed in 1% OsO4 in for 1 h. En bloc staining in 0.5% aqueous uranyl acetate was performed for 3 h followed by a 10-min water wash. Dehydration was done in the following sequence: 50% ethanol, 70% ethanol, 95% ethanol, and 100% ethanol each for 10 min. Infiltration entailed ethanol and resin in the order of 3:1 (1 h), 1:1 (overnight), 1:3 (1 h), and 100% resin (2-3 changes each 30 min). The Thermonox coverslips were inverted over a 1.5-ml centrifuge tube filled with resin and polymerized for 48 h at 60 °C. Thick (0.5-2.0 μm) and thin (60-100 nm) sections were cut using the microtome (Leica Ultracut). The thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and viewed on the FEI Tecnai G2 Biotwin.Subcellular Fractionation—Subcellular fractions of beta cells were isolated as described previously (28Nevins A.K. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1944-1952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly, MIN6 beta cells at 80-90% confluence were harvested into 1 ml of homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) containing protease inhibitors. Cells were disrupted by 10 strokes through a 27-gauge needle and homogenates centrifuged at 900 × g for 10 min. Postnuclear supernatants were centrifuged at 5,500 × g for 15 min, and the subsequent supernatant was centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min to obtain the storage granule (SG) fraction in the pellet. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain the cytosolic fraction (Cyt). Plasma membrane (PM) fractions were obtained by mixing the postnuclear pellet with 1 ml of buffer A (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, d 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and 2 volumes of buffer B (2 m sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, d 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). The mixture was overlaid with Buffer A and centrifuged at 113,000 × g for 1 h to obtain an interface containing the plasma membrane fraction. The interface was collected and diluted to 2 ml with homogenization buffer for centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting pellet was collected as the plasma membrane fraction. All pellets were resuspended in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer to ensure solubilization of membrane proteins.Co-immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—MIN6 beta cell cleared detergent homogenates (2-3 mg) were combined with rabbit anti-Syntaxin 4 or mouse anti-Syntaxin 1 antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C followed by a second incubation with protein G Plus-agarose for 2 h. The resultant immunoprecipitates were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to PVDF membranes for immunoblotting. Membranes were blocked in 5% milk/TBS-Tween for 1 h at room temperature followed by immunoblotting (Syntaxin 1A, Syntaxin 4, and SNAP-25 antibodies were used at 1:1000; VAMP2 antibody was used at 1:5000). Proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence for quantitation using a Chemi-Doc gel documentation system (Bio-Rad).Recombinant Proteins and Interaction Assays—GST-VAMP2-(1-94) fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography as described (28Nevins A.K. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1944-1952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). GST-VAMP2 was immobilized on Sepharose beads and incubated with cleared detergent lysates (∼3 mg) prepared from unstimulated cells for 2 h at 4 °C. Following three washes with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, proteins were eluted from the Sepharose beads and subjected to electrophoresis on 12% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to PVDF membrane for immunoblotting with Syntaxin 4 antibody. For the F-actin spin-down assays, recombinant VAMP2 and Syntaxin 4 proteins were initially expressed and purified as GST fusion proteins after which the GST was removed by thrombin cleavage and remaining protein captured (Novagen kit). Syntaxin 1A protein was purchased from Synaptic Systems. Proteins were concentrated to ∼20 μm and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C immediately prior to use of the resulting supernatant in an actin binding assay. Purified F-actin stocks (23 μm) were prepared according to manufacturer's instructions. Test proteins were incubated with F-actin stock in actin polymerization buffer at room temperature for 30 min. BSA and α-actinin control proteins provided by the manufacturer were used as negative and positive F-actin binding control proteins, respectively, in each experiment for validation of binding. All reactions were centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1.5 h at 24 °C, and supernatants were removed into individually labeled new tubes on ice. Both the supernatants and the pellets were subjected to 12-18% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to PVDF membranes for Coomassie staining or immunoblotting analyses.Statistical Analysis—All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Data were evaluated for statistical significance using Student's t test.RESULTSF-actin Function Is Conserved between Human and Rodent islet Beta Cells—We previously reported that treatment of rat islets with latrunculin B results in potentiation of glucose-stimulated insulin release (21Thurmond D.C. Gonelle-Gispert C. Furukawa M. Halban P.A. Pessin J.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Latrunculin is a potent actin monomer-binding and sequestering agent that converts cellular F-actin to G-actin. To establish continuity of function among islet model systems, the impact of latrunculin upon secretion from mouse islets and human islets was evaluated. Similar to rat islets, isolated mouse islets showed a robust response to 2 h of glucose stimulation, which was further potentiated by latrunculin (Fig. 1A). Human islets were obtained from three independent nondiabetic human cadaver pancreases through the National Institutes of Health/ICR/ABCC (Administrative and Bioinformatics Coordinating Center) distribution program. Because of the fragility of these human islets following isolation and shipment, latrunculin pretreatment and stimulation time was limited to 1 h rather than the 2-h period used with mouse islets, which cumulatively resulted in a lesser yet still significant secretory response to glucose stimulation (Fig. 1B). Importantly, each batch of human islets showed the latrunculin-potentiated effect upon glucose-stimulated insulin release, whereas basal secretion was comparable to the vehicle (DMSO)-treated islets (Fig. 1B). Because islets contain multiple cell types, 70-80% of which are insulin-containing beta cells, cultured MIN6 beta cells were used to further confirm that this potentiating effect of latrunculin was transduced through the beta cells and not one of the other islet cell types. This potentiating effect occurred very rapidly and was evident within 5 min of stimulation with glucose (Fig. 1C). Latrunculin also potentiated insulin release from MIN6 cells in response to KCl and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) as well as calcium-stimulated secretion from streptolysin-O-permeabilized cells (21Thurmond D.C. Gonelle-Gispert C. Furukawa M. Halban P.A. Pessin J.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Moreover, the actin-depolymerizing effect of latrunculin was validated by analysis of the F:G-actin ratio, converting the F-actin: G-actin ratio from ∼20:80% in unstimulated or vehicle-treated cells to ∼1:99% (data not shown). Thus the potentiating effect of latrunculin was found to be conserved across species and relevant to human islet function. Moreover, the MIN6 beta cell line was found to be an appropriate model system in which to pursue a mechanistic study of the role of F-actin in beta cell secretion.To determine how latrunculin facilitated this potentiation, insulin granule localization was examined. Electron micrograph images of latrunculin-treated MIN6 cells showed the prevalence of granules localized at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2A, right panel). In 10 images of latrunculin-treated cells collected, more than 90% exhibited this phenotype. In contrast, vehicle-treated cells contained only a few granules at the cell periphery (Fig. 2A, left panel; arrow denotes plasma membrane between neighboring cells) in all fields. Insulin immunofluorescent confocal microscopy of vehicle- or latrunculin-treated MIN6 cells confirmed the identity of the granules localized at the PM as insulin-containing (Fig. 2B). Punctate insulin staining was visible broadly across the expanse of the beta cells under basal conditions, with regrouping of granules closer to the cell periphery after only 5 min of glucose stimulation. Latrunculin treatment mimicked this glucose-induced redistribution of granules to the cell periphery but did so in the absence of glucose. Immunofluorescent images of more than 30 clusters of latrunculin-treated cells showed the phenotype in Fig. 2B. In a third approach, subcellular fractions were prepared from MIN6 cells treated with vehicle or latrunculin to quantify the extent of the granule redistribution induced by latrunculin. The fractionation procedure was validated in two ways: 1) demonstration of the highest insulin content in the insulin SG fraction with lesser but significant levels in the PM fraction and none in the cytosolic fraction (28Nevins A.K.

In three independent sets of fractions, latrunculin induced an ∼2.5-fold increase in VAMP2-bound insulin granules localized to the PM, with a coordinate ∼40% loss from the SG pool (Fig. 2, C and D). Ponceau S staining was used to validate equal loading in each experiment. Thus, latrunculin-induced F-actin depolymerization allowed a flow of insulin granules to the PM in the absence of the glucose stimulus.FIGURE 2Latrunculin causes increased granule accumulation at the plasma membrane in the absence of glucose.

https://openalex.org/W2015611034,"Myostatin is a secreted protein that normally acts to limit skeletal muscle growth. As a result, there is considerable interest in developing agents capable of blocking myostatin activity, as such agents could have widespread applications for the treatment of muscle degenerative and wasting conditions. Myostatin normally exists in an inactive state in which the mature C-terminal portion of the molecule is bound non-covalently to its N-terminal propeptide. We previously showed that this latent complex can be activated in vitro by cleavage of the propeptide with members of the bone morphogenetic protein-1/tolloid (BMP-1/TLD) family of metalloproteases. Here, I show that mice engineered to carry a germline point mutation rendering the propeptide protease-resistant exhibit increases in muscle mass approaching those seen in mice completely lacking myostatin. Mice homozygous for the point mutation have increased muscling even though their circulating levels of myostatin protein are dramatically increased, consistent with an inability of myostatin to be activated from its latent state. Furthermore, I show that a loss-of-function mutation in Tll2, which encodes one member of this protease family, has a small, but significant, effect on muscle mass, implying that its function is likely redundant with those of other family members. These findings provide genetic support for the hypothesis that proteolytic cleavage of the propeptide by BMP-1/TLD proteases plays a critical role in the activation of latent myostatin in vivo and suggest that targeting the activities of these proteases may be an effective therapeutic strategy for enhancing muscle growth in clinical settings of muscle loss and degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2023832375,"The production, manipulation and rescue of a bacterial artificial chromosome clone of Vaccinia virus (VAC-BAC) in order to expedite construction of expression vectors and mutagenesis of the genome has been described (Domi & Moss, 2002, PNAS 99 12415–20). The genomic BAC clone was ‘rescued’ back to infectious virus using a Fowlpox virus helper to supply transcriptional machinery. We apply here a similar approach to the attenuated strain Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), now widely used as a safe non-replicating recombinant vaccine vector in mammals, including humans. Four apparently full-length, rescuable clones were obtained, which had indistinguishable immunogenicity in mice. One clone was shotgun sequenced and found to be identical to the parent. We employed GalK recombination-mediated genetic engineering (recombineering) of MVA-BAC to delete five selected viral genes. Deletion of C12L, A44L, A46R or B7R did not significantly affect CD8+ T cell immunogenicity in BALB/c mice, but deletion of B15R enhanced specific CD8+ T cell responses to one of two endogenous viral epitopes (from the E2 and F2 proteins), in accordance with published work (Staib et al., 2005, J. Gen. Virol. 86, 1997–2006). In addition, we found a higher frequency of triple-positive IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-2 secreting E3-specific CD8+ T-cells 8 weeks after vaccination with MVA lacking B15R. Furthermore, a recombinant vaccine capable of inducing CD8+ T cells against an epitope from Plasmodium berghei was created using GalK counterselection to insert an antigen expression cassette lacking a tandem marker gene into the traditional thymidine kinase locus of MVA-BAC. MVA continues to feature prominently in clinical trials of recombinant vaccines against diseases such as HIV-AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. Here we demonstrate in proof-of-concept experiments that MVA-BAC recombineering is a viable route to more rapid and efficient generation of new candidate mutant and recombinant vaccines based on a clinically deployable viral vector."
https://openalex.org/W2059521716,"In mammalian cells regulatory proteins controlling the cell cycle are necessary due to the requirements of living in a heterogeneous environment of cell-interactions and growth factors. VRK1 is a novel serine-threonine kinase that phosphorylates several transcription factors and is associated with proliferation phenotypes.In this report VRK1 has been identified as regulated in the cell cycle. VRK1 gene expression is activated by the addition of serum to starved cells, indicating it is required for the exit of G0 phase and entry in G1; a response that parallels the re-expression of MYC, FOS and CCND1 (cyclin D1) genes, suggesting that VRK1 is an early-response gene. VRK1 gene expression is also shutdown by serum withdrawal. The human VRK1 gene promoter cloned in a luciferase reporter responds similarly to serum. In response to serum, the level of VRK1 protein expression has a positive correlation with cell proliferation markers such as phosphorylated-Rb or PCNA, and is inversely correlated with cell cycle inhibitors such as p27. The elimination of VRK1 by siRNA results in a G1 block in cell division, and in loss of phosphorylated-Rb, cyclin D1, and other proliferation markers. Elimination of VRK1 by siRNA induces a reduction of cell proliferation. VRK1 colocalizes with p63 in proliferating areas of squamous epithelium, and identifies a subpopulation in the basal layer.VRK1 is an immediate early response gene required for entry in G1, and due to its implication in normal cell proliferation and division, might be a new target for development of inhibitors of cellular proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1965599026,"Besides existing artemisinin-based combination therapies, alternative safe, effective and affordable drug combinations against falciparum malaria are needed. Methylene blue (MB) was the first synthetic antimalarial drug ever used, and recent studies have been promising with regard to its revival in malaria therapy. The objective of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of two MB-based malaria combination therapies, MB-artesunate (AS) and MB-amodiaquine (AQ), compared to the local standard of care, AS-AQ, in Burkina Faso.Open-label randomised controlled phase II study in 180 children aged 6-10 years with uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Nouna, north-western Burkina Faso. Follow-up was for 28 days and analysis by intention-to-treat. The treatment groups were similar in baseline characteristics and there was only one loss to follow-up. No drug-related serious adverse events and no deaths occurred. MB-containing regimens were associated with mild vomiting and dysuria. No early treatment failures were observed. Parasite clearance time differed significantly among groups and was the shortest with MB-AS. By day 14, the rates of adequate clinical and parasitological response after PCR-based correction for recrudescence were 87% for MB-AS, 100% for MB-AQ (p = 0.004), and 100% for AS-AQ (p = 0.003). By day 28, the respective figure was lowest for MB-AS (62%), intermediate for the standard treatment AS-AQ (82%; p = 0.015), and highest for MB-AQ (95%; p<0.001; p = 0.03).MB-AQ is a promising alternative drug combination against malaria in Africa. Moreover, MB has the potential to further accelerate the rapid parasite clearance of artemisinin-based combination therapies. More than a century after the antimalarial properties of MB had been described, its role in malaria control deserves closer attention.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00354380."
https://openalex.org/W2095456538,"Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) are critical components of cytokine signaling pathways. STAT5A and STAT5B (STAT5), the most promiscuous members of this family, are highly expressed in specific populations of hypothalamic neurons in regions known to mediate the actions of cytokines in the regulation of energy balance. To test the hypothesis that STAT5 signaling is essential to energy homeostasis, we used Cre-mediated recombination to delete the Stat5 locus in the CNS. Mutant males and females developed severe obesity with hyperphagia, impaired thermal regulation in response to cold, hyperleptinemia and insulin resistance. Furthermore, central administration of GM-CSF mediated the nuclear accumulation of STAT5 in hypothalamic neurons and reduced food intake in control but not in mutant mice. These results demonstrate that STAT5 mediates energy homeostasis in response to endogenous cytokines such as GM-CSF."
https://openalex.org/W1972919397,"Background and Aims Gluten sensitivity is widespread among humans. For example, in celiac disease patients, an inflammatory response to dietary gluten leads to enteropathy, malabsorption, circulating antibodies against gluten and transglutaminase 2, and clinical symptoms such as diarrhea. There is a growing need in fundamental and translational research for animal models that exhibit aspects of human gluten sensitivity. Methods Using ELISA-based antibody assays, we screened a population of captive rhesus macaques with chronic diarrhea of non-infectious origin to estimate the incidence of gluten sensitivity. A selected animal with elevated anti-gliadin antibodies and a matched control were extensively studied through alternating periods of gluten-free diet and gluten challenge. Blinded clinical and histological evaluations were conducted to seek evidence for gluten sensitivity. Results When fed with a gluten-containing diet, gluten-sensitive macaques showed signs and symptoms of celiac disease including chronic diarrhea, malabsorptive steatorrhea, intestinal lesions and anti-gliadin antibodies. A gluten-free diet reversed these clinical, histological and serological features, while reintroduction of dietary gluten caused rapid relapse. Conclusions Gluten-sensitive rhesus macaques may be an attractive resource for investigating both the pathogenesis and the treatment of celiac disease."

MAMP perception by defined host cell surface receptors initiates MAMP-triggered immunity, the first line of defense contributing to the arrest of microbial growth. The best characterized MAMP perception system in plants is the recognition of bacterial flagellin or flg22, the bioactive peptide from a highly conserved 22-amino-acid region of the protein (3Felix G. Duran J.D. Volko S. Boller T. Plant J. 1999; 18: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar), by the receptor kinase flagellin-sensitive 2 (FLS2) (4Gómez-Gómez L. Boller T. Mol.

MAPKs are the final components of signaling cascades, activated by upstream MAPK kinases (MAPKKs), which are also activated by other upstream kinases, MAPKK kinases (MAPKKKs) (6Tena G. Asai T.

Moreover, plants with reduced levels of AtMPK6 displayed increased susceptibility to infection by virulent and avirulent strains of the bacterial pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae, indicating that signaling via AtMPK6 plays a critical role during defense responses (11Menke F.L.H. van Pelt J.A.

Pitzschke A. Hirt H. Trends Plant Sci. 2005; 10: 339-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), relatively little is known about the substrates of these kinases. The only in vivo substrate identified for AtMPK6 is 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase 6, the rate-limiting enzyme in the production of the stress hormone ethylene (12Liu Y.D. Zhang S. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 3386-3399Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). In a large scale screen for potential substrates of AtMPK3 and AtMPK6, a protein microarray strategy used denatured bacterially expressed proteins as substrates for bacterially expressed MAPKs (13Feilner T.

This screen identified 44 putative substrates of AtMPK3 and 38 putative substrates of AtMPK6, 26 of which were common for both MAPKs. However, no experiments were performed to determine whether these candidates were phosphorylated in planta. Here, we describe the identification of AtPHOS32 as a protein that becomes phosphorylated in response to flg22 treatment of Arabidopsis cell suspension cultures. Sequencing the first phosphorylation site of AtPHOS32 by nanoelectrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (nanoESI-MS/MS) indicated that this protein may be a substrate of MAPKs. Using in vitro kinase assays together with site-directed mutagenesis of the phosphorylated residue, we confirmed that AtPHOS32 is a substrate of both AtMPK3 and AtMPK6.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaintenance and Treatment of Suspension Cultures—Suspension cultures of Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Landsberg were maintained as described previously (9Nühse T.S. Peck S.C. Hirt H. Boller T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7521-7526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Cultures were grown on a rotary shaker at 120 rpm in a 16/8-h light/darkness cycle at 24 °C. Six days after subculturing, 5 ml of culture was removed to a 20-ml beaker and shaken at room temperature for 45 min prior to treatment with 100 nm flg22 peptide (3Felix G. Duran J.D. Volko S. Boller T. Plant J. 1999; 18: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). Radioactive pulse labeling of cells was performed as described previously (14Peck S.C. Nühse T.S. Hess D. Iglesias A. Meins F. Boller T. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1467-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar).Protein Extraction, Two-dimensional Gel Analysis, and Ni-NTA Enrichment—For analytical two-dimensional gel analysis, proteins were isolated and separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis as described previously (14Peck S.C. Nühse T.S. Hess D. Iglesias A. Meins F. Boller T. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1467-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). For nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) enrichment of AtPHOS32 and AtPHOS34, proteins were extracted from suspension-cultured cells using a homogenization buffer lacking chelators or reducing agents (100 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium molybdate, 25 mm sodium fluoride, 25 mm glycerophosphate, 0.5% polyvinyl pyrrolidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, and 1 nm calyculin A). Protein extracts were incubated with Ni-NTA resin on a rotating wheel for 2–4 h at 4 °C. The resin was collected by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and washed three times with 5 bed volumes of homogenization buffer. The resin was transferred to a Micro-Bio spin chromatography column (Bio-Rad), and the remaining homogenization buffer was removed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 s. Proteins bound to the Ni-NTA resin were eluted three times in 70 μl of elution buffer (50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 100 mm imidazole). The pooled eluted proteins were concentrated by methanol/chloroform precipitation. In brief, 3 volumes of methanol were added followed by 1 volume of chloroform and 4 volumes of water, with mixing by vortexing after each addition. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 min at room temperature, the aqueous (upper) phase was discarded, and proteins were precipitated from the organic phase with 4 volumes of methanol at –20 °C for at least 40 min. After collecting the precipitate by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the pellet was washed in 80% acetone and stored at –20 °C until gel separation.Mass Spectrometry—The two-dimensional gel separated proteins were prepared for and analyzed by nanoESI-MS/MS as described (14Peck S.C. Nühse T.S. Hess D. Iglesias A. Meins F. Boller T. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1467-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). MALDI-TOF analysis was performed as described (15Nühse T.S. Boller T. Peck S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45248-45254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Data base searches were performed using MS-Fit with a mass tolerance of ±50 ppm. Modifications included allowing for two missed cleavages in the trypsin digest, cysteine modification by acrylamide, and oxidized methionine in the initial search and subsequently phosphorylation of Ser, Thr, or Tyr.Bacterial Expression—For bacterial expression of AtPHOS32, the open reading frame was amplified from a cDNA library and directionally cloned into the NdeI-BamHI-digested pET-3a vector (Novagen). Individual clones were resequenced prior to transformation into BL21(DE3) bacteria for expression according to standard procedures. Proteins were isolated from bacteria under native conditions using the Ni-NTA isolation procedure described above.MAPK Immunoprecipitation and in Vitro Kinase Assays—For immunoprecipitation of AtMPK3 and AtMPK6, antibodies (α-MPK3 and α-MPK6, respectively) were raised in rabbits (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) against synthetic peptides corresponding to the N terminus of the AtMPK3 kinase (MNTGGGQYTDFPAVE) or the AtMPK6 kinase (MDGGSGQPAADTEMT). The AtMPK3/6 kinases were immunoprecipitated from flg22-elicited Arabidopsis suspension culture cells using α-MPK3 or α-MPK6 antibodies as follows. 10 min after the addition by 100 nm flg22, the elicited cells were harvested by filtration and lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium molybdate, 25 mm sodium fluoride, 25 mm glycerophosphate, 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidine, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride, 10 μl of leupeptin, 1 nm calyculin-A, and 1 mm Na3VO4). The soluble protein extract was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Antibodies were added to the protein extract, and the mixture was incubated on a rotating wheel for 2 h at 4°C. Protein A-Sepharose (pre-equilibrated in immunoprecipitation buffer) was added to the immunoprecipitation mixture, and incubation was continued for another 2 h at 4°C. The mixture was washed three times in immunoprecipitation buffer, once in kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MnCl, 10 mm MgCl), and once in kinase buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. In vitro kinase assays were performed for 10 min at 30 °C in a total volume of 20 μl of kinase buffer containing the immunoprecipitated resin, substrate, and ATP mix (10 μm ATP, 0.1 μl of[γ-32P]ATP). Reactions were stopped by adding SDS loading buffer and heating for 15 min at 65 °C. After separation of proteins on a 14% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel, radioactive incorporation was visualized by phosphorimaging using a Fuji FLA5000 scanner.Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis of bacterial expression plasmids to change the in vivo phosphorylated serine residue of AtPHOS32 to alanine or aspartic acid residues was performed commercially (BioS&T, Montreal, Canada), and the mutated expression plasmid was resequenced prior to use.MAPK Mutant Plants—Insertion lines used in this study were mpk3-1 (SALK_051594), mpk3-2 (GABI 697F07), mpk6-3 (SALK_027507, the same line as used by Liu and Zhang (12Liu Y.D. Zhang S. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 3386-3399Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar)), and mpk6-4 (SALK_062471). Numbering of mpk6 alleles continues according to Liu and Zhang (12Liu Y.D. Zhang S. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 3386-3399Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Genomic PCR with primers designed by the SIGnAL iSect tool using standard settings was used to isolate homozygote plants. The GABI-Kat lines are described in Rosso et al. (16Rosso M.G. Li Y. Strizhov N. Reiss B. Dekker K. Weisshaar B. Plant Mol. Biol. 2003; 53: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar), and the SALK lines are described in Alonso et al. (17Alonso J.M. Stepanova A.N. Leisse T.J. Kim C.J. Chen H. Shinn P.

An equal amount of protein extract from flg22-treated Arabidopsis cell suspension cultures was incubated for 2 h with protein A-Sepharose with and without the MAPK antibodies as indicated. After removing the Sepharose by centrifugation, the remaining immunodepleted supernatant was used for in vitro kinase assays carried out as described above for 20 min at 30 °C.RESULTSIsolation and Identification of AtPHOS32 and AtPHOS34—Previously, we described a two-dimensional gel-based phosphoproteomic screen to identify proteins undergoing rapid changes in phosphorylation in suspension cell cultures of Arabidopsis in response to treatment with the bacterial elicitor peptide, flg22 (14Peck S.C.

Using radioactive pulse labeling of cells with [32P]orthophosphate, a number of proteins showed reproducible changes in radioactive incorporation within 4 min of elicitation (indicated in Fig. 1A by circles and the large square). Proteins that did not change in the level of radioactive incorporation (indicated in Fig. 1A by arrows) served as internal controls for both radioactive incorporation and loading. Most of the radioactive images corresponding to differentially phosphorylated proteins did not align with stainable proteins even when using 18-cm single pI unit first dimension gradients (data not shown). The failure to visualize the differentially phosphorylated protein may result from low levels of putative signaling components, low stoichiometry of phosphorylation on these components, or a combination of these factors. Therefore, other enrichment methods were necessary to identify the target proteins.While attempting to use Ni-NTA columns to isolate other candidate phosphoproteins that had been epitope-tagged with polyhistidine, we noticed that two additional proteins binding to the Ni-NTA columns were consistently phosphorylated after elicitation with flg22 (data not shown). These additional proteins were also enriched by Ni-NTA columns in untransformed Arabidopsis suspension cells, indicating that these proteins had endogenous nickel binding properties. Therefore, we used Ni-NTA to enrich for nickel-binding proteins after radioactive pulse labeling with [32P]orthophosphate and separated these proteins by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1B). The silver-stained image shows that after elicitation with flg22, newly appearing proteins with pIs more acidic than those seen in the 0-min controls (Fig. 1B, left panels) co-migrated with the radioactive spots observed in the phosphorimage (Fig. 1B, right panels). These results indicate that these proteins are differentially phosphorylated in response to elicitation with flg22. The apparent pI and molecular weight of these proteins were similar to the series of radioactive spots indicated in Fig. 1A in the box.The pattern of newly appearing acidic proteins led us to hypothesize that these proteins may be phosphorylated isoforms of the spots in Fig. 1B, left panels, indicated by the oval and box. However, the non-linearity of silver staining made it difficult to conclude whether the level of putative unphosphorylated forms decreased concurrently with the increase of the more acidic forms.To identify each protein, we performed Ni-NTA enrichment using a liter of cell culture as starting material. This preparative protein isolation resulted in colloidal Coomassie Blue-stainable amounts of each apparent isoform (Fig. 2A). We isolated a portion of the gel from the center of each spot and performed an in-gel trypsin digest followed by peptide mass fingerprinting using MALDI-TOF MS (Fig. 2B; the complete peak list for each spot is provided as supplemental Table 1). The lower molecular weight series of proteins were all identified with 35–65% protein coverage as an Arabidopsis protein (At5g54430) (Fig. 2B). Remaining peaks not matching At5g54430 were searched independently against the Arabidopsis data base to determine whether there may be a second, co-migrating protein in the isolated gel piece, but no additional protein was identified in any of the spots (data not shown). We named this protein AtPHOS32 for PHOSphorylated protein with an apparent molecular mass of 32 kDa.FIGURE 2Identification of AtPHOS32 and AtPHOS34 by mass spectrometry. After large scale enrichment of AtPHOS32 and AtPHOS34 by Ni-NTA as described in the legend for Fig. 1, the individual phosphorylated forms were separated by two-dimensional gels (A). B, each form of the protein (labeled by spot number in A) was isolated, in-gel digested with trypsin, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. The number of matching peaks as well as the percentage of the protein covered by the peaks are listed (the actual peak lists are provided as supplemental Table 1). Peptide mass mapping analysis identified AtPHOS32 (At5g54430) and AtPHOS34 (At4g27320) as highly related proteins. C, direct sequencing of AtPHOS34 by nanoESI-MS/MS confirmed the accuracy of the peptide mass mapping experiment.

The serine residue in bold indicated by the arrow is the phosphorylation site identified in Fig. 4.

Because of the lower sequence coverage for this protein (26–33%), we performed nanoESI-MS/MS to confirm the identity (Fig. 2C). Two peptide sequence tags clearly showed single amino acid substitutions that differentiated this protein from At5g54430 (Fig. 2D, underlined), conclusively identifying the protein as At4g27320. Because of the slightly higher apparent molecular weight, we named this protein AtPHOS34.Similarity to USPA Proteins from Bacteria—A function for AtPHOS32 or AtPHOS34 was not immediately obvious from the amino acid sequence, but both proteins contain a universal stress protein A (USPA) domain named after a bacterial protein from Escherichia coli that accumulates in response to a plethora of stimuli including nutrient starvation and exposure to many stresses (18Kvint K. Nachin L. Diez A. Nyström T. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The function of this family of proteins found in many bacteria is not known. In Arabidopsis, 44 proteins are predicted to contain a USPA domain (19Kerk D. Bulgrien J. Smith D.W. Gribskov M. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 1209-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence identity between the plant and bacterial proteins in this domain is relatively low (∼20%; see alignment in Fig. 2D). However, the overall structural fold of the domain is predicted to be conserved in plant proteins (19Kerk D. Bulgrien J. Smith D.W. Gribskov M. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 1209-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).The crystal structure of Methanococcus jannaschii USPA protein, MJ0577 (PDB ID 1MJH), was determined (20Zarembinski T.I. Hung L.W. Mueller-Dieckmann H.J. Kim K.K. Yokota H. Kim R. Kim S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kim R. Kim S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15189-15193Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Only five of the USPA domain proteins from Arabidopsis contain the residues required for binding ATP (19Kerk D. Bulgrien J. Smith D.W. Gribskov M. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 1209-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and both AtPHOS32 and AtPHOS34 are among these five (Fig. 2D, asterisks indicate residues coordinating ATP in MJ0577).Identification of One Phosphorylation Site on AtPHOS32—Using the tryptic digest of Fig. 2A, Spot 2 of AtPHOS32, we sequenced one of the phosphorylated peptides from AtPHOS32 by nanoESI-MS/MS. Evidence that this peptide is phosphorylated is clearly demonstrated by the neutral loss on the doubly charged parent ion ((M+2H)2+ to (M+2H)Δ2+) (Fig. 3). The y-ion series identified the only serine residue being phosphorylated. Note that a mixed y-ion series was detected corresponding to fragments containing the phosphorylated serine residue or containing dehydroalanine as would occur after neutral loss of the phosphate. Interestingly, the serine residue in this motif is conserved in related proteins throughout a variety of plant species including monocots (Fig. 4), indicating that phosphorylation of this residue is evolutionarily conserved among plants. However, the location of this phosphorylation site is within an N-terminal extension that is not found within the bacterial USPA proteins (Fig. 2D).FIGURE 3Identification of a phosphorylation site in AtPHOS32 by mass spectrometry. Sequencing of the phosphopeptide from AtPHOS32 by nanoESI-MS/MS shows that the serine residue is phosphorylated. (M+2H)2+ labels the parent ion, and (M+2H)Δ2+ labels the parent ion after the loss of phosphate. The individual y- and b-ions are labeled in the spectra. yΔ indicates a y-ion that has undergone a neutral loss of phosphate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 4Alignment of the phosphorylation site from AtPHOS32 with apparent orthologues from other species.

This Ser-Pro motif is common in substrates of MAP kinases, among other kinases (21Sharrocks A.D. Yang S.-H. Galanis A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 448-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). One of the well characterized responses of Arabidopsis elicited with flg22 is the rapid activation of two MAP kinases, AtMPK3 and AtMPK6 (9Nühse T.S. Peck S.C. Hirt H. Boller T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7521-7526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 10Asai T. Tena G. Plotnikova J. Willmann M.R. Chiu W.L. Gómez-Gómez L. Boller T. Ausubel F.M. Sheen J. Nature. 2002; 415: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether AtPHOS32 was a substrate of these MAP kinases.To generate substrates for in vitro kinase assays, we cloned the open reading frame into a vector for bacterial expression without any epitope tag. The bacterially expressed AtPHOS32 bound to Ni-NTA columns under native or denaturing conditions, demonstrating that the nickel binding activity by which these proteins were initially identified is intrinsic to the protein. As controls for kinase specificity, we similarly produced mutant proteins with either alanine (S21A) or aspartate (S21D) substituted for the phosphorylated serine residue.To perform immunoprecipitation kinase assays, we produced peptide antibodies recognizing AtMPK3 and AtMPK6. We first tested the specificity of these antibodies using mpk3 (Fig. 5A) or mpk6 (Fig. 5B) T-DNA insertion mutants. The α-MPK3 antibody recognized a band of the expected size in Col-0 plants but not in two independent mpk3 mutants (Fig. 5A, upper panel). Perhaps more importantly, we demonstrated that kinase activity phosphorylating the general substrate, myelin basic protein, was immunoprecipitated only from elicitor-treated Col-0 plants but not from either of the mpk3 mutants (Fig. 5A, lower panel). Similar experiments using the α-MPK6 antibody showed the absence of a cross-reacting protein (Fig. 5B, upper panel) or immunoprecipitated kinase activity (Fig. 5B, lower panel) in two independent mpk6 mutants. Therefore, these antibodies are specific for their respective kinases in immunoprecipitation kinase assays.FIGURE 5AtPHOS32 is a substrate of the MAPKs, AtMPK3 and AtMPK6.

https://openalex.org/W1996312917,"The formation of functional neural circuits that process sensory information requires coordinated development of the central and peripheral nervous systems derived from neural plate and neural plate border cells, respectively. Neural plate, neural crest and rostral placodal cells are all specified at the late gastrula stage. How the early development of the central and peripheral nervous systems are coordinated remains, however, poorly understood. Previous results have provided evidence that at the late gastrula stage, graded Wnt signals impose rostrocaudal character on neural plate cells, and Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signals specify olfactory and lens placodal cells at rostral forebrain levels. By using in vitro assays of neural crest and placodal cell differentiation, we now provide evidence that Wnt signals impose caudal character on neural plate border cells at the late gastrula stage, and that under these conditions, BMP signals induce neural crest instead of rostral placodal cells. We also provide evidence that both caudal neural and caudal neural plate border cells become independent of further exposure to Wnt signals at the head fold stage. Thus, the status of Wnt signaling in ectodermal cells at the late gastrula stage regulates the rostrocaudal patterning of both neural plate and neural plate border, providing a coordinated spatial and temporal control of the early development of the central and peripheral nervous systems."
https://openalex.org/W2166187386,"Background We investigated the large and small scale evolutionary relationships of the endemic Western Australian subterranean shrimp genus Stygiocaris (Atyidae) using nuclear and mitochondrial genes. Stygiocaris is part of the unique cave biota of the coastal, anchialine, limestones of the Cape Range and Barrow Island, most of whose nearest evolutionary relations are found in coastal caves of the distant North Atlantic. The dominance of atyids in tropical waters and their food resources suggest they are pivotal in understanding these groundwater ecosystems. Methodology/Principle Findings Our nuclear and mitochondrial analyses all recovered the Mexican cave genus Typhlatya as the sister taxon of Stygiocaris, rather than any of the numerous surface and cave atyids from Australia or the Indo-Pacific region. The two described Stygiocaris species were recovered as monophyletic, and a third, cryptic, species was discovered at a single site, which has very different physiochemical properties from the sites hosting the two described species. Conclusions/Significance Our findings suggest that Stygiocaris and Typhlatya may descend from a common ancestor that lived in the coastal marine habitat of the ancient Tethys Sea, and were subsequently separated by plate tectonic movements. This vicariant process is commonly thought to explain the many disjunct anchialine faunas, but has rarely been demonstrated using phylogenetic techniques. The Cape Range's geological dynamism, which is probably responsible for the speciation of the various Stygiocaris species, has also led to geographic population structure within species. In particular, Stygiocaris lancifera is split into northern and southern groups, which correspond to population splits within other sympatric subterranean taxa."
https://openalex.org/W1967018454,"Colour changes in animals may be triggered by a variety of social and environmental factors and may occur over a matter of seconds or months. Crustaceans, like fiddler crabs (genus Uca), are particularly adept at changing their colour and have been the focus of numerous studies. However, few of these studies have attempted to quantitatively describe the individual variation in colour and pattern or their adaptive significance. This paper quantitatively describes the colour patterns of the fiddler crab Uca capricornis and their ability to change on a socially significant timescale. The most dramatic changes in colour pattern are associated with moulting. These ontogenetic changes result in a general reduction of the colour pattern with increasing size, although females are more colourful and variable than similarly-sized males. Uca capricornis are also capable of rapid colour changes in response to stress, but show no endogenous rhythms associated with the semilunar and tidal cycles commonly reported in other fiddler crabs. The extreme colour polymorphism and the relative stability of the colour patterns in Uca capricornis are consistent with their use in visually mediated mate recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2044118609,"The cytokine transcription profiles of developing T helper 1 and T helper 2 cells are imprinted and induced appropriately following stimulation of differentiated cells. Epigenetic regulation combines several mechanisms to ensure the inheritance of transcriptional programs. We found that the expression of the polycomb group proteins, whose role in maintaining gene silencing is well documented, was induced during development in both T helper lineages. Nevertheless, the polycomb proteins, YY1, Mel-18, Ring1A, Ezh2, and Eed, bound to the <i>Il4</i> and <i>Ifng</i> loci in a differential pattern. In contrast to the prevailing dogma, the binding activity of the polycomb proteins in differentiated T helper cells was associated with cytokine transcription. The polycomb proteins bound to the cytokine genes under resting conditions, and their binding was induced dynamically following stimulation. The recruitment of the polycomb proteins Mel-18 and Ezh2 to the cytokine promoters was inhibited in the presence of cyclosporine A, suggesting the involvement of NFAT. Considering their binding pattern at the cytokine genes and their known function in higher order folding of regulatory elements, we propose a model whereby the polycomb proteins, in some contexts, positively regulate gene expression by mediating long-distance chromosomal interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1993985393,"The discovery of separate 5' and 3' halves of transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules-so-called split tRNA-in the archaeal parasite Nanoarchaeum equitans made us wonder whether ancestral tRNA was encoded on 1 or 2 genes. We performed a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of tRNAs in 45 archaeal species to explore the relationship between the three types of tRNAs (nonintronic, intronic and split). We classified 1953 mature tRNA sequences into 22 clusters. All split tRNAs have shown phylogenetic relationships with other tRNAs possessing the same anticodon. We also mimicked split tRNA by artificially separating the tRNA sequences of 7 primitive archaeal species at the anticodon and analyzed the sequence similarity and diversity of the 5' and 3' tRNA halves. Network analysis revealed specific characteristics of and topological differences between the 5' and 3' tRNA halves: the 5' half sequences were categorized into 6 distinct groups with a sequence similarity of >80%, while the 3' half sequences were categorized into 9 groups with a higher sequence similarity of >88%, suggesting different evolutionary backgrounds of the 2 halves. Furthermore, the combinations of 5' and 3' halves corresponded with the variation of amino acids in the codon table. We found not only universally conserved combinations of 5'-3' tRNA halves in tRNA(iMet), tRNA(Thr), tRNA(Ile), tRNA(Gly), tRNA(Gln), tRNA(Glu), tRNA(Asp), tRNA(Lys), tRNA(Arg) and tRNA(Leu) but also phylum-specific combinations in tRNA(Pro), tRNA(Ala), and tRNA(Trp). Our results support the idea that tRNA emerged through the combination of separate genes and explain the sequence diversity that arose during archaeal tRNA evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2086337623,"The activation of the protein kinase C (PKC) family of serine/threonine kinases contributes to the modulation of insulin signaling, and the PKC-dependent phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 has been implicated in the development of insulin resistance. Here we demonstrate Ser357 of rat IRS-1 as a novel PKC-δ-dependent phosphorylation site in skeletal muscle cells upon stimulation with insulin and phorbol ester using Ser(P)357 antibodies and active and kinase dead mutants of PKC-δ. Phosphorylation of this site was simulated using IRS-1 Glu357 and shown to reduce insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, to decrease activation of Akt, and to subsequently diminish phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3. When the phosphorylation was prevented by mutation of Ser357 to alanine, these effects of insulin were enhanced. When the adjacent Ser358, present in mouse and rat IRS-1, was mutated to alanine, which is homologous to the human sequence, the insulin-induced phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 or tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 was not increased. Moreover, both active PKC-δ and phosphorylation of Ser357 were shown to be necessary for the attenuation of insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of Ser357 could lead to increased association of PKC-δ to IRS-1 upon insulin stimulation, which was demonstrated with IRS-1 Glu357.

(41Greene M.W. Morrice N. Garofalo R.S. Roth R.A. Biochem.J. 2004; 378: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and our group using the previously described mass spectrometry-based identification procedure (43Beck A. Moeschel K. Deeg M. Haring H.U. Voelter W. Schleicher E.D. Lehmann R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2003; 14: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The sequence homology of rodent and human IRS-1 is shown in Fig. 1A. The human IRS-1 contains alanine instead of serine at position 358 (position 363 in humans), i.e. whenever Ser358 is mutated to alanine, this represents the human wild type (WT) sequence.To study the regulation and function of this site in vivo, we generated polyclonal phospho-site-specific antibodies using a phosphopeptide sequence corresponding to the region of IRS-1 surrounding Ser357. The antisera were immunopurified as described under “Experimental Procedures” to eliminate cross-reactivity with the adjacent Ser358 (Fig. 1A). The specificity of the immunopurified antibodies was tested in BHKIR cells transiently transfected with IRS-1 WT, IRS-1 Ala357, IRS-1 Ala358, and IRS-1 Ala357/358 and stimulated with insulin or phorbol ester TPA, a pharmacological activator of classical and novel PKC isoforms for 30 min (Fig. 1B). The phospho-site-specific Ser357 antibody clearly detected IRS-1 upon stimulation with insulin and TPA in the cells overexpressing IRS-1 WT and IRS-1 Ala358, indicating induction of the phosphorylation of Ser357 by insulin and activation of PKC isoforms. We detected almost no signal in IRS-1 Ala357 and IRS-1 Ala357/358 transfected cells, similar to the immunoblots obtained with control transfected cells (Fig. 1B). These data clearly show that the immunopurified antibody recognizes IRS-1 solely when it is phosphorylated on Ser357 without any cross-reactivity with the adjacent putative phosphorylation residue Ser358. Similar results have been obtained using C2C12 skeletal muscle cells (data not shown).To further establish the specificity of the phospho-site-specific Ser357 antibodies, C2C12 cells were transfected with IRS-1 WT and stimulated with TPA. Immunoprecipitated IRS-1 was incubated with λ-phosphatase, which led to a complete loss of the immunoreactivity of the antibody, indicating that dephosphorylated IRS-1 was not recognized (Fig. 1C). Analyzing non-transfected C2C12 cells, we could also detect the phosphorylation of Ser357 of endogenous IRS-1 after stimulation with insulin or TPA (Fig. 1D). Moreover, phosphorylation of Ser357 was significantly induced in muscle tissue of insulin-treated mice, suggesting a physiological relevance for this site (Fig. 1E). Additionally, we observed in insulin or TPA-treated human myotubes enhanced phosphorylation of Ser357 of the endogenous human IRS-1 protein, which contain alanine instead of serine at position 358 (Fig. 1F).PKC-δ Mediates IRS-1 Ser357 Phosphorylation in C2C12 Cells—Because PKC-δ as a member of the novel PKC isoform family was able to phosphorylate Ser357 in the in vitro phosphorylation assays (41Greene M.W. Morrice N. Garofalo R.S. Roth R.A. Biochem.J. 2004; 378: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and treatment with insulin and TPA as activators of novel PKCs resulted in phosphorylation of Ser357 (Fig. 1), we focused on the role of PKC-δ in Ser357 phosphorylation in muscle cells. C2C12 cells transiently co-transfected with PKC-δ and IRS-1 WT and stimulated by insulin and TPA showed significant increase in the phosphorylation of Ser357 in comparison with cells transfected with IRS-1 WT alone (Fig. 2A). We also observed phosphorylation of Ser357 in unstimulated co-transfected cells, which might be due to basal activity of the co-transfected PKC-δ. Because TPA could activate other IRS-1 serine kinases in addition to PKC-δ, we co-transfected cells with IRS-1 and PKC-δ kinase negative mutant (KN). Phosphorylation of Ser357 in unstimulated and insulin- and TPA-treated cells was significantly abrogated when PKC-δ-KN mutant was used (Fig. 2). These findings indicate that the insulin- and TPA-induced phosphorylation of Ser357 required PKC-δ activity.FIGURE 2PKC-δ-mediated IRS-1 Ser357 phosphorylation in C2C12 cells. A, C2C12 cells were transfected with IRS-1 WT or co-transfected with PKC-δ or kinase-dead mutant of PKC-δ (PKC-δ KN). The cells were stimulated with either 10 nm insulin (ins) or 0.5 μm TPA for 30 min. A representative immunoblot with the phospho-site-specific Ser357 antibody and PKC-δ and reprobe of the blot with the polyclonal IRS-1 antibody is shown. B, Ser357 phosphorylation intensity was quantified based on scanning densitometry of the immunoblots (means +S.E., n = 3; *, p < 0.05 PKC δ co-transfected cells versus cells transfected with IRS-1 WT alone; #, p < 0.05 PKC δ KN co-transfected cells versus PKC-δ-co-transfected cells).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Phosphorylation of Ser357 of IRS-1 Leads to Reduced Phosphorylation of Akt in Skeletal Muscle Cells—We next investigated the functional role of phosphorylation of Ser357 in insulin signal transduction. The kinase Akt is an important insulin signaling molecule, shown to transduce the metabolic actions of insulin, including increases in transport and storage of glucose in muscle, and its activation is largely controlled by IRS-1 during insulin action (44Bouzakri K. Zachrisson A. Al Khalili L. Zhang B.B. Koistinen H.A. Krook A. Zierath J.R. Cell Metab. 2006; 4: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Therefore, we studied the influence of Ser357 of IRS-1 on the insulin-induced time-dependent phosphorylation of Akt. To examine a possible influence of the adjacent Ser358 residue, C2C12 cells were transiently transfected with IRS-1 WT, IRS-1 Ala357, IRS-1 Ala358, and IRS-1 Ala357/358 and stimulated for various time points with 10 nm insulin (Fig. 3A). The insulin-dependent increase in Ser473 phosphorylation of Akt was clearly enhanced in IRS-1 Ala357, IRS-1 Ala358, and IRS-1 Ala357/358-expressing cells after 10 and 60 min of insulin stimulation compared with cells expressing wild type IRS-1 (Fig. 3, A and C). The possible negative role of Ser357 phosphorylation in insulin action was further demonstrated in IRS-1 Glu357-expressing cells, which exhibited a significantly diminished Ser473 phosphorylation of Akt after 10 and 60 min of insulin stimulation compared with wild type-expressing cells (Fig. 3, B and C). Because we did not observe any difference of single IRS-1 Ala357 and the double alanine mutant, we used in further experiments IRS-1 Ala357/358 as loss-of-function and IRS-1 Glu357 as gain-of-function mutant.FIGURE 3The phosphorylation of Ser357 of IRS-1 leads to reduced phosphorylation of Akt in skeletal muscle cells. A and B, C2C12 cells, transiently transfected with IRS-1 WT, IRS-1 Ala357, IRS-1 Ala358, and IRS-1 Ala357/358 (A) or IRS-1 WT and IRS-1 Glu357 (B) were stimulated for 5, 10, and 60 min with 10 nm insulin (ins). The cell lysates were analyzed with 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and after Western blotting the phosphorylation of Ser473 of Akt was investigated. The blot was reprobed with an Akt protein antibody. The IRS-1 amount was analyzed using a polyclonal IRS-1 antibody. C, phosphorylation intensity of Ser473 of Akt was quantified based on scanning densitometry of immunoblots normalized for Akt protein (mean + S.E., n = 3; *, p < 0.05 IRS-1 Ala mutants versus IRS-1 WT; #, p < 0.05 IRS-1 Glu mutant versus IRS-1 WT).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Insulin-stimulated Phosphorylation of GSK-3α in Skeletal Muscle Cells Is Modulated by Ser357 Phosphorylation of IRS-1—The sustained negative effect of Ser(P)357 on Akt suggests a physiological function of this phosphorylation in insulin signaling. Thus, we asked whether the regulation of Akt activity was reflected by a modulation of its downstream effector GSK-3. C2C12 cells were transiently transfected with IRS-1 WT, IRS-1 Ala357/358, or IRS-1 Glu357 and stimulated for various time points with 10 nm insulin (Fig. 4, A and B). The increase in Ser21 phosphorylation of GSK-3α was more pronounced in IRS-1 Ala357/358-expressing cells after 10 and 60 min of insulin stimulation compared with cells expressing IRS-1 WT, whereas expression of IRS-1 Glu357 resulted in a clearly decreased phosphorylation (Fig. 4, B and C). Thus, the negative effect of Ser357 phosphorylation on insulin signaling could also be demonstrated at the level of GSK-3. Although both isoforms α and β of GSK-3 were present in C2C12 cells (data not shown), we observed insulin-induced phosphorylation only at Ser21 of GSK-3α. These findings are in agreement with previous studies (45Ciaraldi T.P. Nikoulina S.E. Bandukwala R.A. Carter L. Henry R.R. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 4393-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) reporting that the α-isoform of GSK-3 was more responsive to insulin as compared with GSK-3β and had a stronger association with parameters of insulin resistance.FIGURE 4Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of GSK-3 in skeletal muscle cells is modulated by Ser357 phosphorylation of IRS-1.

https://openalex.org/W1986815595,"Hsp90 is an essential molecular chaperone required for the normal functioning of many key regulatory proteins in eukaryotic cells. Vertebrates have two closely related isoforms of cytosolic Hsp90 (Hsp90alpha and Hsp90beta). However, specific functions for each isoform are largely unknown, and no Hsp90 co-chaperone has been reported to distinguish between the two isoforms. In this study, we show that the Hsp90 co-chaperone GCUNC45 bound preferentially to the beta isoform of Hsp90 in vitro. GCUNC45 efficiently blocked the progression of progesterone receptor chaperoning in an in vitro functional system when Hsp90beta was used, but did so with much less efficacy when Hsp90alpha was used. Knockdown experiments in HeLa cells showed that GCUNC45 is required for the normal cellular distribution of Hsp90beta, but not Hsp90alpha. This is the first example of a co-chaperone with isoform selectivity, and this approach may open novel avenues to understanding the functional differences between Hsp90 isoforms."
https://openalex.org/W1989296785,"Brain fatty acid binding protein (Fabp7), which is important in early nervous system development, is expressed in astrocytes and neuronal cell precursors in mature brain. We report here that levels of Fabp7 mRNA in adult murine brain change over a 24 hour period. Unlike Fabp5, a fatty acid binding protein that is expressed widely in various cell types within brain, RNA analysis revealed that Fabp7 mRNA levels were elevated during the light period and lower during dark in brain regions involved in sleep and activity mechanisms. This pattern of Fabp7 mRNA expression was confirmed using in situ hybridization and found to occur throughout the entire brain. Changes in the intracellular distribution of Fabp7 mRNA were also evident over a 24 hour period. Diurnal changes in Fabp7, however, were not found in postnatal day 6 brain, when astrocytes are not yet mature. In contrast, granule cell precursors of the subgranular zone of adult hippocampus did undergo diurnal changes in Fabp7 expression. These changes paralleled oscillations in Fabp7 mRNA throughout the brain suggesting that cell-coordinated signals likely control brain-wide Fabp7 mRNA expression. Immunoblots revealed that Fabp7 protein levels also underwent diurnal changes in abundance, with peak levels occurring in the dark period. Of clock or clock-regulated genes, the synchronized, global cycling pattern of Fabp7 expression is unique and implicates glial cells in the response or modulation of activity and/or circadian rhythms."

Methodology HIV-1 infected pregnant women received from ≥32–36 weeks of gestation scZidovudine (ZDV)+/−Lamivudine (3TC)+single-dose Nevirapine (sdNVP) at delivery within the ANRS 1201/1202 DITRAME-Plus cohort (2001–2003). Neonates received a sdNVP+7-day ZDV prophylaxis. Two infant-feeding interventions were systematically offered free of charge: formula-feeding or exclusive shortened breastfeeding with early cessation from four months. The reference group was the ANRS 049a DITRAME cohort (1994–2000) exposed to scZDV from 36 weeks, then to prolonged breastfeeding. Pediatric HIV infection was defined by a positive plasma HIV-1 RNA at any age, or if aged ≥18 months, a positive HIV-1 serology. Turnbull estimates of cumulative transmission risks (CTR) and effectiveness (HIV-free survival) were compared by exposure group using a Cox model. Findings Among 926 live-born children enrolled, 107 (11.6%) were HIV-infected at 18 months. CTRs were 22.3% (95% confidence interval[CI]:16–30%) in the 238 ZDV long-term breastfed reference group, 15.9% (CI:10–27%) in the 169 ZDV+sdNVP shortened breastfed group; 9.4% (CI:6–14%) in the 195 ZDV+sdNVP formula-fed group; 6.8% (CI:4–11%) in the 198 ZDV+3TC+sdNVP shortened breastfed group, and 5.6% (CI:2–10%) in the 126 ZDV+3TC+sdNVP formula-fed group. Each combination had a significantly higher effectiveness than the ZDV long-term breastfed group except for ZDV+sdNVP shortened breastfed children, ranging from 51% (CI:20–70%) for ZDV+sdNVP formula fed children to 63% (CI:40–80%) for ZDV+3TC+NVPsd shortened breastfed children, after adjustment for maternal eligibility for antiretroviral therapy (ART), home delivery and low birth-weight. Substantial MTCT risk reductions are reachable in Africa, even in short-term breastfed children. The two sc antiretroviral combinations associated to any of the two infant feeding interventions, formula-feeding and shortened breastfeeding, reduce significantly MTCT with long-term benefit until age 18 months and without increasing mortality."

Experimentally, WD-MCF can be induced in rabbits. The lesions observed are very similar to those described in natural host species. Here, we used the rabbit model and in vivo 5-Bromo-2′-Deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation to study WD-MCF pathogenesis. The results obtained can be summarized as follows. (i) AlHV-1 infection induces CD8+ T cell proliferation detectable as early as 15 days post-inoculation. (ii) While the viral load in peripheral blood mononuclear cells remains below the detection level during most of the incubation period, it increases drastically few days before death. At that time, at least 10% of CD8+ cells carry the viral genome; while CD11b+, IgM+ and CD4+ cells do not. (iii) RT-PCR analyses of mononuclear cells isolated from the spleen and the popliteal lymph node of infected rabbits revealed no expression of ORF25 and ORF9, low or no expression of ORF50, and high or no expression of ORF73. Based on these data, we propose a new model for the pathogenesis of WD-MCF. This model relies on proliferation of infected CD8+ cells supporting a predominantly latent infection."
https://openalex.org/W2073977744,"In studies of gene regulation the efficient computational detection of over-represented transcription factor binding sites is an increasingly important aspect. Several published methods can be used for testing whether a set of hypothesised co-regulated genes share a common regulatory regime based on the occurrence of the modelled transcription factor binding sites. However there is little or no information available for guiding the end users choice of method. Furthermore it would be necessary to obtain several different software programs from various sources to make a well-founded choice.We introduce a software package, Asap, for fast searching with position weight matrices that include several standard methods for assessing over-representation. We have compared the ability of these methods to detect over-represented transcription factor binding sites in artificial promoter sequences. Controlling all aspects of our input data we are able to identify the optimal statistics across multiple threshold values and for sequence sets containing different distributions of transcription factor binding sites.We show that our implementation is significantly faster than more naïve scanning algorithms when searching with many weight matrices in large sequence sets. When comparing the various statistics, we show that those based on binomial over-representation and Fisher's exact test performs almost equally good and better than the others.

The objective is to examine the proportion of registered clinical trials providing valid scientific leadership information.We reviewed clinical trial entries listing Canadian investigators in the two largest international and public trial registers, the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) register, and ClinicalTrials.gov. The main outcome measures were the proportion of clinical trials reporting valid contact information for the trials' Principal Investigator (PI)/Co-ordinating Investigator/Study Chair/Site PI, and trial e-mail contact address, stratified by funding source, recruiting status, and register. A total of 1388 entries (142 from ISRCTN and 1246 from ClinicalTrials.gov) comprised our sample. We found non-compliance with mandatory registration requirements regarding scientific leadership and trial contact information. Non-industry and partial industry funded trials were significantly more likely to identify the individual responsible for scientific leadership (OR = 259, 95% CI: 95-701) and to provide a contact e-mail address (OR = 9.6, 95% CI: 6.6-14) than were solely industry funded trials.Despite the requirements set by WHO and ICMJE, data on scientific leadership and contact e-mail addresses are frequently omitted from clinical trials registered in the two leading public clinical trial registers. To promote accountability and transparency in clinical trials research, public clinical trials registers should ensure adequate monitoring of trial registration to ensure completion of mandatory contact information fields identifying scientific leadership."

The functional integrity of connective tissues is dependent upon the production of an extensive and highly organized network of extracellular collagen fibrils. Curiously, collagen fibrils occur in a wide spectrum of tissues in which diverse properties are elicited from the tissue-specific organization and size of the fibrils. For example, orthogonal layers of narrow-diameter collagen fibrils account for the toughness and optical transparency of the cornea, whereas the parallel arrangement of the fibrils in tendon produces a tough, tensile tissue. An organized extracellular matrix is established in these tissues during embryonic development, but the molecular mechanisms are poorly understood.Tendons have a highly ordered, yet relatively simple extracellular matrix (ECM) 2The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; pCcollagen, procollagen lacking the N-propeptides but retaining the C-propeptides; pNcollagen, procollagen lacking the C-propeptides but retaining the N-propeptides; *collagen, a collective term for all procollagen, pCcollagen, pNcollagen, and collagen molecules or polypeptide chains of these molecules. 2The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; pCcollagen, procollagen lacking the N-propeptides but retaining the C-propeptides; pNcollagen, procollagen lacking the C-propeptides but retaining the N-propeptides; *collagen, a collective term for all procollagen, pCcollagen, pNcollagen, and collagen molecules or polypeptide chains of these molecules. composed of elongated collagen fibrils in parallel alignment with the tendon long axis. At embryonic stages of development when the architecture of the ECM is being established, the tendon precursor cells are cylindrical in shape with the long axis of the cells parallel to that of the tendon long axis. Convolutions of the plasma membranes of tendon fibroblasts form intercellular and intracellular channels in which the collagen bundles form (1Trelstad R.L. Hayashi K. Dev. Biol. 1979; 71: 228-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). These bundles are contiguous from one cell to another along the tendon long axis and are stabilized by adherens cell-cell junctions (2Richardson S.H. Starborg T. Lu Y. Humphries S.M. Meadows R.S. Kadler K.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6218-6228Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Fibril bundles and their associated cells are arranged into tendon fascicles with several fascicles composing the tendon proper. As tendon development proceeds, the fibril bundles associate laterally to form the large fascicles of mature tendons (3Birk D.E. Trelstad R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). With increasing age, bundle size increases, and the tendon fibroblasts reduce in number and become more widely dispersed (4Nakagawa Y. Majima T. Nagashima K. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1994; 152: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This organization of collagen fibrils, taking into account fibril diameter, packing density, bundle size, and the parallel orientation of the fibrils, defines the mechanical qualities demonstrated by tendon (3Birk D.E. Trelstad R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar).The motivation for the work presented here came from evidence that the late secretory pathway is involved in orchestrating the parallel organization of collagen fibrils in tendon (5Canty E.G. Lu Y. Meadows R.S. Shaw M.K. Holmes D.F. Kadler K.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Using a combination of three-dimensional electron microscopy (serial section three-dimensional reconstruction) and biochemical approaches, it was shown that during embryonic development, collagen processing begins within the cell in post-Golgi transport carriers. Actin-stabilized plasma membrane processes (fibripositors) protrude into the ECM to organize the newly assembled collagen fibrils in parallel alignment with the existing matrix (5Canty E.G. Lu Y.

The intracellular cleavage of procollagen and the concomitant appearance of fibripositors pointed to a link between the intracellular cleavage of procollagen to collagen and the formation of intracellular fibrils. Here we show using pulsechase analysis of procollagen processing that the intracellular conversion of procollagen to collagen can occur within the cell during postnatal stages of tendon development in the absence of intracellular collagen fibrils and fibripositors. Therefore, cells can prevent intracellular formation of collagen fibrils.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPulse-Chase Analysis of Procollagen Processing and Secretion—Reagents were obtained from Invitrogen or Sigma unless stated otherwise. Mice were obtained from the University of Manchester Biological Supply facility and killed using Schedule 1 procedures prior to dissection of the tail tendons. Pulse-chase experiments were performed at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 containing penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), l-glutamine (2 mm), l-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (200 mm), and β-aminopropionitrile (400 mm). Pulse-chase experiments were performed at 37 °C; tendons were pre-equilibrated for 30 min, labeled for 10 min with 2.5 μCi/ml [14C]proline (GE Healthcare), and then transferred to unlabeled medium for 15 min to 3 h. Pulse-chase was stopped by transferring the tendons to 25 mm EDTA and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 4 °C. Tendons subjected to pulse-chase analysis in 1-ml aliquots of supplemented medium were then extracted in 100-μl aliquots of salt extraction buffer (1 m NaCl, 25 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitors and supplemented as required with Nonidet P-40 detergent (1%, v/v). A concentrated stock solution of protease inhibitors was made using EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science). Tendons were extracted in four changes of salt extraction buffer (overnight (S1), 6 h (S2), overnight (S3), and 6 h (S4)) and overnight in salt extraction buffer containing Nonidet P-40. S1 extracts are shown as S lanes in Figs. 1, 2, and 3. Extracts were analyzed using 4% precast SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Novex) under reducing conditions. The gels were fixed for 40 min using two changes of methanol (10%, v/v) and acetic acid (10%, v/v) and dried under vacuum. The gels were exposed to a BAS-MS phosphorimaging plate (Fujifilm), which was processed using an FLA3000 phosphoimager (Fujifilm).FIGURE 2Intracellular cleavage of procollagen in postnatal CD1 tendons.

Lu Y. Meadows R.S. Shaw M.K. Holmes D.F. Kadler K.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Tail tendons were incubated at 37 °C in 1-ml aliquots of culture medium supplemented with [14C]proline for 10 min and chased in unlabeled medium for 15 min. Tendon samples were then incubated at 20 °C for 30 min with trypsin/EDTA (trypsin/Versene, final concentration of 0.25%; BioWhittaker) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 buffer. Soybean trypsin inhibitor was added to 0.25% to inhibit subsequent trypsinization. Proteins were sequentially extracted at 4 °C in 100-μl aliquots of four changes of neutral salt extraction buffer (overnight, 6 h, overnight, and 6 h) and finally in buffer containing Nonidet P-40 overnight. Only the first salt extracts and Nonidet P-40 extracts are shown under “Results.” Samples were analyzed using 4% precast Novex SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions. The gels were fixed for 40 min using two changes of methanol (10%, v/v) and acetic acid (10%, v/v) and dried under vacuum. The gels were exposed to a BAS-MS phosphorimaging plate, which was processed using an FLA3000 phosphoimager.Electron Microscopy—Tendons were prepared for electron microscopy as described previously (5Canty E.G. Lu Y. Meadows R.S. Shaw M.K. Holmes D.F. Kadler K.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Ultrathin (60–70 nm) sections were collected on uncoated copper 200-mesh grids and stained with lead citrate (0.3% in 0.1 m sodium hydroxide) for 1 min. Immunoelectron microscopy samples were prepared by high pressure freezing (Leica EM PACT) followed by freeze substitution (AFS, Leica) and embedding in LR White. A postembedding labeling technique was used to detect type I collagen using a rabbit anti-mouse collagen type I primary polyclonal antibody (Biodesign International) at a dilution of 1:50 for 1 h at room temperature, followed by a 10-nm gold-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (British Biocell International) at a dilution of 1:50 for 1 h at room temperature. Post-treated sections were stained with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate. Sections were examined on an FEI Tecnai 12 Biotwin transmission electron microscope, and images were recorded on Kodak 4498 film and digitized using an Imacon Flextight 848 scanner (Precision Camera and Video).Collagen Fibril Diameter Measurements—Electron micrographs of near-transverse sections of fibril bundles were recorded. Magnification calibration was performed using a diffraction grating replica (2160 lines/mm; Agar Scientific, Stanstead, UK). Subregions of micrographs were digitized using a Bosch TYK 91D TV camera and A/D converter. Diameters were measured from the digital images using the image analysis software Semper5 (Synoptics, Cambridge, UK).RESULTSDuring our studies of the occurrence and structure of fibripositors, we noted that tail tendons of postnatal mice lacked fibripositors and the associated fibricarriers that contain intracellular collagen fibrils. These observations prompted a study of procollagen processing in postnatal murine tendons in combination with ultrastructural observations of the cells and collagen fibrils. We used our sequential protein extraction procedure to examine separately procollagen cleavage intermediates inside and outside the cell (5Canty E.G. Lu Y. Meadows R.S. Shaw M.K. Holmes D.F. Kadler K.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In brief, ECM proteins are extracted into buffers containing sodium chloride, and intracellular proteins are extracted into buffers further supplemented with Nonidet P-40.Procollagen Processing during Postnatal Development of C57BL/6 Mouse Tail Tendon Occurs Predominately in the ECM—Tail tendons were removed from 4- and 6-week-old C57BL/6 strain mice, and sequential pulse-chase analyses of procollagen cleavage were performed as described (5Canty E.G. Lu Y. Meadows R.S. Shaw M.K. Holmes D.F. Kadler K.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, the appearance of procollagen processing intermediates mirrored that described previously for postnatal C57BL/6 mouse tail tendon (5Canty E.G. Lu Y. Meadows R.S. Shaw M.K. Holmes D.F. Kadler K.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), with a differential distribution of procollagen processing intermediates in the salt and Nonidet P-40 extractions. At both ages, the [14C]procollagen chains were predominately present in the Nonidet P-40 extract as pro-α1(I) and pro-α2(I) after a 15-min chase time (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 1). Procollagen α-chains could be seen in the Nonidet P-40 extracts at subsequent chase times up to 60 min (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 3, 5, and 7) along with low levels of pCcollagen. Few or no labeled procollagen α-chains could be seen at 120- or 180-min chase times (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 9 and 11). Conversely, no labeled collagen could be seen in the 15-min salt extracts (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 2). After longer chase times, some partially processed α-chains (cleaved of the N-terminal propeptide) and fully processed α-chains could be seen in the first salt extracts. At 120- and 180-min chase times (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 10 and 12), all detectable 14C-proteins were present in the salt extract as collagen and pCcollagen. These observations indicate that procollagen processing occurs predominately in the ECM in postnatal C57BL/6 mice and that processing is via pCcollagen.C57BL/6 and CD1 Mice Exhibit Differences in Postnatal Procollagen Processing—To determine whether the intracellular/extracellular pattern of postnatal procollagen processing was the same in another strain of mouse, pulse-chase experiments were performed on postnatal CD1 mouse tail tendons. Surprisingly, procollagen, pNcollagen, pCcollagen, and fully processed collagen were present in intracellular (Nonidet P-40) fractions (Fig. 2A). This was particularly apparent with chase times of 60 min or less (Fig. 2A, lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7). The amount of labeled collagen in the Nonidet P-40 extract decreased progressively as chase time increased, consistent with the secretion of collagen to the ECM. Interestingly, procollagen was observed in the Nonidet P-40 extract after a 180-min chase, whereas collagen chains had been seen almost entirely in the salt extract of C57BL/6 mice at chase times longer than 60 min (compare Figs. 1 and 2). Another surprising result was the amount of labeled collagen present in the salt extract after a 15-min chase time. Analysis of postnatal processing in C57BL/6 mice revealed no detectable 14C-labeled proteins in the salt extract after 15 min and very few after 30 min (see Fig. 1A), indicating a more rapid initial secretion of collagen in CD1 tendons. Extracellular protein extracts were otherwise similar to those observed for C57BL/6. These data show that intracellular processing of procollagen can occur via pCcollagen or pNcollagen in postnatal CD1 mouse tendon but primarily via the pCcollagen intermediate in the ECM. These results also demonstrate that there are murine strain-dependent differences in procollagen processing.Intracellular Procollagen Processing Persists in Adult CD1 Tail Tendons—Examination of procollagen cleavage in 3-month-old CD1 mouse tendons demonstrated rapid intracellular conversion of procollagen to collagen (Fig. 2B). The results showed intracellular cleavage of procollagen to collagen within a short 15-min time frame followed by secretion of fully processed collagen within 30 min (Fig. 2B, lane 2). It was noteworthy that the rate of secretion of collagen was apparently faster in the 3-month-old CD1 mice than in the 4-week-old mice.The Sequential Isolation of Extracellular and Then Intracellular Proteins Is Effective in Postnatal Murine Tendon—Although Canty et al. (5Canty E.G. Lu Y. Meadows R.S. Shaw M.K. Holmes D.F. Kadler K.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) had demonstrated that the sequential sodium chloride/Nonidet P-40 extraction procedure successfully separated intracellular from extracellular proteins in embryonic chick, we considered the possibility that the procedure might not be optimized for postnatal murine tendon, especially in light of the results using the CD1 mouse tendons. We therefore validated the procedure on CD1 mouse tendons using the trypsin sensitivity of the procollagen propeptides, based on the method described by Bruckner and Prockop (7Bruckner P. Prockop D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 110: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and used by Canty et al. (5Canty E.G. Lu Y. Meadows R.S. Shaw M.K. Holmes D.F. Kadler K.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In brief, the propeptides are sensitive to trypsin digestion but are protected from cleavage when enclosed within the cell or within a membrane-bound compartment. Fig. 3 shows that proteins extracted in the salt-containing buffer were accessible to trypsin, whereas proteins in pre-Nonidet P-40 extracts of the cells were protected from trypsin cleavage.Other Strains of Mice Exhibit Intracellular Procollagen Cleavage—Procollagen cleavage was examined at 3 weeks post-birth in the tail tendons of four additional mouse strains: BALB/c, C3H, FVB (MDR1A knock-out), and MF1-nude. For each of the strains, intracellular processing via pCcollagen and pNcollagen intermediates occurred (data not shown). These results imply that cleavage of procollagen to collagen within the confines of the cell is a feature of collagen biosynthesis during postnatal murine tendon development in many strains of mice, with C57BL/6 being a notable exception.Intracellular Collagen Does Not Directly Initiate Fibripositor Formation in Postnatal Mouse Tendon Cells—Transverse sections through tail tendon bundles of 3-week-old C57BL/6, CD1, and C3H strain mice were examined by transmission electron microscopy for evidence of fibripositors and fibricarriers. Furthermore, immunoelectron microscopy using an anti-triple helix type I collagen antibody was performed on tail tendons of 6-week-old CD1 and C3H mice to identify transport compartments containing procollagen, pNcollagen, pCcollagen, and collagen. Unfortunately it is not possible to determine which intermediates are present within the transport compartments because antibodies that are directed to the collagen triple helix, terminal propeptides, or cleaved neoepitopes will inevitably recognize at least two procollagen intermediates. In the interest of brevity, we use *collagen to describe collectively procollagen, pNcollagen, pCcollagen, and collagen. As shown in Fig. 4, the tendon cells appeared similar for each of the strains. At 3 weeks of age, the plasma membranes of the tendon fibroblasts were bordered closely by their surrounding ECM, which was dominated by closely packed parallel collagen fibrils heterogeneous in diameter (see collagen fibrils (CFs) in Fig. 4, A1, B1, and C1, of conventionally embedded and stained samples and in the collagen immunolocalization images in A2, B2, and C2). No evidence of fibricarriers, intracellularly assembled collagen fibrils, or fibripositors was observed in any of the samples. Furthermore, large-diameter *collagen-containing compartments observed by Canty et al. (5Canty E.G. Lu Y. Meadows R.S. Shaw M.K. Holmes D.F. Kadler K.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) in the stellate projections of tendon fibroblasts in 6-week-old C57BL/6 strain mice were also observed in CD1 and C3H cells (labeled with black arrows in Fig. 4, A2, B2, and C2). The stellate projections are at 90° to the tendon long axis and should not be confused with fibripositors, which are parallel to the tendon long axis. In each of the strains, the stellate projections were closely bordered by parallel type I collagen-containing fibrils and an abundance of small compartments in close association with the plasma membrane that did not label for type I collagen. Again, there was no evidence of intracellular fibril assembly or fibripositors. The results indicate that the intracellular conversion of procollagen to collagen is not sufficient to initiate their assembly into collagen fibrils or to activate the formation of fibripositors.FIGURE 4Fibricarriers and fibripositors are not present 3 weeks post-birth.

Sections were incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated to 10-nm colloidal gold particles to reveal the presence of *collagen molecules.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Strain Variations in Collagen Processing Do Not Affect Collagen Fibril Diameter—Observations of procollagen processing in several strains of mice indicate that C57BL/6 strain mice can only effectively cleave the procollagen C-propeptide following the secretion of collagen into the ECM. This is in contrast to the other strains examined, which showed active C-proteinase activity in both intracellular and extracellular locations. To examine whether the lack of C-terminal procollagen processing in C57BL/6 strain mice had an impact on fibril diameter, measurements were taken from the tail tendons of C57BL/6, CD1, and C3H strain mice at 3 weeks of postnatal development (Fig. 5). Each of the strains had a broad distribution of fibril diameters, although CD1 fibrils had a slightly higher mean diameter of 144.6 ± 1.6 nm (S.E.) (Fig. 5A) compared with 131.9 ± 1.6 nm (S.E.) for C57BL/6 (Fig. 5C) and 129.6 ± 1.4 nm (S.E.) for C3H (Fig. 5B). The data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and Tukey post-hoc analysis, and CD1 fibril diameters were significantly larger than C3H and C57BL/6 fibril diameters (p < 0.01). Fibril diameter differences between C3H and C57BL/6 strains were not significant (p = 0.579). These data show that differences in intracellular processing of type I procollagen in C57BL/6 tendons do not appear to affect collagen fibril diameter.FIGURE 5Analysis of collagen fibril diameter in 3-week murine tail tendon.

Bornstein P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 1138-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Since that time, it has been shown that cleavage of the C-terminal propeptides by procollagen C-proteinase (which, it is noteworthy, is a neutral metalloproteinase) is essential for the assembly of collagen fibrils (9Hojima Y. van der Rest M. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15996-16003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that, following cleavage, spontaneous fibrillogenesis occurs (see Refs. 10Kadler K.E. Hojima Y. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15696-15701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 11Kadler K.E. Holmes D.F. Trotter J.A. Chapman J.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar and references therein). Here we show that cleavage of the procollagen propeptides can occur in intracellular compartments in postnatal mouse tendon cells in the absence of intracellular fibrillogenesis. Thus, mechanisms must be in place to prevent intracellular collagen fibril formation. The mechanisms in postnatal mouse tendon cells are unknown. However, from extensive studies of collagen fibrillogenesis in vitro, we can speculate that factors such as low pH, high pH, restricted size of transport compartments, the absence of nucleating molecules (e.g. type V collagen), and the presence of inhibitors or a combination of these factors might be at play in postnatal tendon cells. We expand on these possibilities below.We had first examined postnatal C57BL/6 tendon and showed that procollagen processing was predominately extracellular (5Canty E.G. Lu Y. Meadows R.S. Shaw M.K. Holmes D.F. Kadler K.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In subsequent studies, we were surprised to find that in tail tendons of 3.5-week-old CD1 mice (an outbred mouse strain), marked intracellular procollagen processing occurred. The relative amounts of procollagen, pNcollagen, pCcollagen, and collagen α-chains were similar to those observed in embryonic day 13 chick tendons, with processing via both pNcollagen and pCcollagen in intracellular extracts and processing via the pCcollagen intermediate in extracellular extracts (5Canty E.G. Lu Y. Meadows R.S. Shaw M.K. Holmes D.F. Kadler K.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Interestingly, intracellular fibrils are also seen in the embryonic chick tendon cells at the same time that intracellular cleavage of procollagen occurs.The discovery (described here) that complete procollagen processing can occur within intracellular compartments of postnatal tendons prompted us to examine whether intracellular fibril formation and fibripositor formation also occurs in these tissues. However, electron microscopy revealed no evidence of intracellularly assembled fibrils or fibripositors. In addition, immunoelectron microscopy localized type I collagen chains to large-diameter compartments in the stellate projections of the cells. We noticed considerable differences in intracellular procollagen cleavage between CB57BL/6 and CD1 mice. We therefore investigated whether these d"

Although for decades IGF-1 has been considered to have therapeutic potential, systemic side effects of IGF-1 are significant, and local delivery of IGF-1 for tissue repair has been a long-standing challenge. In this study, we designed and purified a novel protein, heparin-binding IGF-1 (Xp-HB-IGF-1), which is a fusion protein of native IGF-1 with the heparin-binding domain of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor. Xp-HB-IGF-1 bound selectively to heparin as well as the cell surfaces of 3T3 fibroblasts, neonatal cardiac myocytes and differentiating ES cells. Xp-HB-IGF-1 activated the IGF-1 receptor and Akt with identical kinetics and dose response, indicating no compromise of biological activity due to the heparin-binding domain. Because cartilage is a proteoglycan-rich environment and IGF-1 is a known stimulus for chondrocyte biosynthesis, we then studied the effectiveness of Xp-HB-IGF-1 in cartilage. Xp-HB-IGF-1 was selectively retained by cartilage explants and led to sustained chondrocyte proteoglycan biosynthesis compared to IGF-1. These data show that the strategy of engineering a ""long-distance"" growth factor like IGF-1 for local delivery may be useful for tissue repair and minimizing systemic effects."

Although Klf13(-/-) mice are viable, fewer mice were present at 3 weeks than predicted by Mendelian inheritance. Viable Klf13(-/-) mice had reduced numbers of circulating erythrocytes and a larger spleen. The spleen contained an increased number of Ter119(med)CD71(hi), Ter119(hi)CD71(hi), and Ter119(hi)CD71(med) cells but not Ter119(hi)CD71(-) cells, indicating an increase in less mature erythroblasts. A higher proportion of the Ter119(med)CD71(hi) cells were proliferating, indicating that the mice were under a degree of erythropoietic stress. These data indicate that KLF13 is involved in the normal control of erythropoiesis."

Deficiencies of ASB and GALNS are associated with the mucopolysaccharidoses. To determine if expression of ASB and GALNS impacts on glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and proteoglycans beyond their association with the mucopolysaccharidoses, we modified the expression of ASB and GALNS by overexpression and by silencing with small interference RNA in MCF-7 cells. Content of total sulfated GAG (sGAG), chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4S), and total chondroitin sulfates (CSs) was measured following immunoprecipitation with C4S and CS antibodies and treatment with chondroitinase ABC. Following silencing of ASB or GALNS, total sGAG, C4S, and CS increased significantly. Following overexpression of ASB or GALNS, total sGAG, C4S, and CS declined significantly. Measurements following chondroitinase ABC treatment of the cell lysates demonstrated no change in the content of the other sGAG, including heparin, heparan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and keratan sulfate. Following overexpression of ASB and immunoprecipitation with C4S antibody, virtually no sGAG was detectable. Total sGAG content increased to 23.39 (±1.06) μg/mg of protein from baseline of 12.47 (±0.68) μg/mg of protein following ASB silencing. mRNA expression of core proteins of the CS-containing proteoglycans, syndecan-1 and decorin, was significantly up-regulated following overexpression of ASB and GALNS. Soluble syndecan-1 protein increased following increases in ASB and GALNS and reduced following silencing, inversely to changes in CS. These findings demonstrate that modification of expression of the lysosomal sulfatases ASB and GALNS regulates the content of CSs.

Deficiencies of ASB and GALNS activity are associated with the congenital mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome (MPS VI) and Morquio syndrome (MPS IVA), respectively. In these lysosomal storage diseases, there is accumulation of highly sulfated, unmetabolizable glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans. The impact of sulfatase activity on metabolism of GAGs and the proteoglycans (PGs) with which they are associated has not been widely explored, beyond the congenital storage diseases.

Recently, we reported that ASB activity is reduced in uncorrected cystic fibrosis cells, consistent with the accumulation of highly sulfated GAG in pulmonary secretions in cystic fibrosis patients. Following correction of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in pulmonary epithelial cell lines, ASB activity increased significantly (1Bhattacharyya S. Look D. Tobacman J.K. Clin. Chim. Acta. 2007; 380: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Also, we found marked reductions in arylsulfatases A and B, galactose-6-sulfatase, and steroid sulfatase in malignant mammary cell lines (MCF-7, T47D, and HCC 1937), compared with normal primary mammary epithelial and myoepithelial cells in tissue culture (2Bhattacharyya S. Tobacman J.K. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2007; 103: 20-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Decline in sulfatase activity in malignant mammary cells suggests a possible role for diminished sulfatases in the evolution of mammary malignancy, because an increase in the highly negatively charged extracellular sulfates might affect cell-cell interactions and signaling processes. Specified sulfations of GAG side chains may produce unique binding motifs that selectively recognize and mediate interactions between growth factors and cellular receptors. The interaction of heparan sulfate (HS), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and the FGF receptor are required for FGF signaling, and deficiency of 2-O-sulfotransferase, which sulfates iduronic acid in HS, results in marked abnormalities of FGF signaling (3Li J. Shworak N.W. Simons M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1951-1959Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increase in 2-O-sulfotransferase leads to enhanced FGF responsiveness (4Wilson V.A. Gallagher J.T. Merry C.L. Glycoconj. J. 2002; 19: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Alterations in specific sulfations by modifications of sulfotransferase expression and activity are also known to modulate syndecan function (5Zimmermann P. David G. FASEB J. 1999; 13: S91-S100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Tkachenko E. Rhodes J.M. Simons M. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 488-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Syndecan has vital roles in cell-cell interactions and development, influencing the adhesion capacity of neoplastic cells with the stroma and, thereby, the growth and invasion of neoplastic cells (7Tsanou E. Ioachim E. Briasoulis E. Charchanti A. Damala K. Karavasilis V. Pavlidis N. Agnantis N.J. J. Exp. Clin. Can. Res. 2004; 23: 641-650PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of syndecan-1 expression in epithelial cells results in loss of cell polarity, thereby affecting epithelial-mesenchymal transition during development (8Couchman J.R. Chen L. Woods A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2001; 207: 113-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrated that the physiological functions of syndecan-1 not only depend on its temporal and spatial expression pattern, but also on the configuration of its HS and CS side chains, which cooperate with HS chains in binding to the heparin-binding growth factors (9Deepa S.S. Yamada S. Zako M. Goldberger O. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37368-37376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Although sulfotransferases have been regarded as the predominant intracellular mechanism for the modification of the extent of sulfation of the GAG, the effects of extracellular sulfatase enzymes have also been recognized. The mammalian sulfatases (Sulf1 and Sulf2) are secreted and act as specific heparin 6-O-sulfatases (10Morimoto-Tomita M. Uchimura K. Werb Z. Hemmerich S. Rosen S.D. J. Biol.

Hsulf1 has been reported to modulate hepatocyte growth factor-mediated tumor cell invasion (13Lai J.P. Chien J. Strome S.E. Staub J. Montoya D.P. Greene E.L. Smith D.I. Roberts L.R. Shridhar V. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1439-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Qsulf1, the avian homolog of Sulf, has been shown to remodel HS on the cell surface and to promote Wnt-1 signaling (14Ai X.

In this report we present distinct effects of the activity of the lysosomal sulfatases ASB and GALNS on modification of CSs in MCF-7 cells, hypothesizing a role for these enzymes in cellular metabolism, beyond that associated with the mucopolysaccharidoses. To clarify if modification of lysosomal sulfatase expression can affect chondroitin sulfations in cells unaffected by genetic deficiency of sulfatase activity, we have considered the effects of silencing and overexpression of the lysosomal enzymes ASB and GALNS on total sulfated GAG (sGAG), total CS (C4S, C6S, CS-D, and CS-E), and chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4S) content, in MCF-7 cells in tissue culture. We have also determined the effects of modification of sulfatase enzymes on syndecan-1 and decorin mRNA expression and soluble syndecan-1 protein, because ASB and GALNS can hydrolyze the sulfate groups of the chondroitin component of the PG formed by these core proteins. Cell Culture of MCF-7 Cells—MCF-7 cells from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) were thawed, cultured as recommended, and sub-cultured in phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in humidified, 5% CO2 environment with media renewal at 2-day intervals. Confluent cells were harvested by trypsinization and sub-cultured in 6-well tissue culture plates. Cells were transfected to overexpress ASB or GALNS or were silenced by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for ASB or GALNS or both, as described below. Spent media were collected from control and treated wells at specified intervals and stored at –80 °C. Cells were harvested by scraping, and cell extracts were prepared for measurements of soluble syndecan-1, ASB activity, GALNS activity, Western blot, or total cellular protein. Protein was measured by using the BCA™ Protein assay kit (Pierce), using bovine serum albumin as standard and expressed as nanograms/mg of cellular protein. De-identified normal mammary tissue and malignant mammary tissue were obtained in accord with approved protocols of the Institutional Review Board of the University of Illinois at Chicago and the assistance of the Tissue Bank of the Department of Pathology. Malignant mammary tissue was frozen at –80 °C after surgical excision. Normal mammary tissue was cultured as previously reported (2Bhattacharyya S. Tobacman J.K. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2007; 103: 20-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Silencing of ASB and GALNS by siRNA—siRNAs for ASB and GALNS and control siRNA labeled with rhodamine were procured (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and tested for effectiveness of transfection by observing fluorescence of the control and by measurement of enzymatic activity. Effects of silencing ASB or GALNS or both in combination were measured. MCF-7 cells were grown to 60–70% confluency in 6-well tissue culture clusters, and the medium of the growing cells was aspirated and replaced with 2.3 ml of fresh medium with serum. 0.6 μl of 20 μm siRNA (150 ng) was mixed with 100 μl of serum-free medium and 12 μl of HiPerfect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen). The mixture was incubated for 10 min at room temperature to allow the formation of transfection complexes, and then added dropwise onto the cells. The plate was swirled gently, and treated cells were incubated at 37 °C in humidified, 5% CO2 environment. After 24 h, medium was exchanged with fresh growth medium, and cells were maintained in culture for an additional 24 h. Intracellular localization of the transfection complexes was ascertained by observing fluorescence of the cells that had been transfected with rhodamine-tagged control siRNA by fluorescence microscopy. Fluorescence was detected in over 95% of the cells. ASB and GALNS Overexpression—ASB (NCBI NM_000046) and GALNS (NCBI NM_000512) plasmids in pCMV6-XL4 vector were obtained (Origene) and overexpressed in MCF-7 cells by transient transfection using 2 μg of the plasmid and Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen). Combined overexpression of ASB and GALNS was also performed. Controls included untransfected cells, cells transfected with vector only, and cells transfected with ASB or GALNS and vector control. Media were changed after 6 h, and cells were incubated for 48 h in humidified, 37 °C, 5% CO2 environment, and then harvested. ASB and GALNS Activity Assays—Control, transfected, or siRNA-treated cells were harvested, and cell homogenates were prepared for measurement of ASB activity. ASB activity in the samples was determined by 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate as substrate in 0.05 m acetate buffer, pH 5.6, as previously described (1Bhattacharyya S. Look D. Tobacman J.K. Clin. Chim. Acta. 2007; 380: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 2Bhattacharyya S. Tobacman J.K. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2007; 103: 20-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). GALNS assay was also performed as previously reported (1Bhattacharyya S. Look D. Tobacman J.K. Clin. Chim. Acta. 2007; 380: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 2Bhattacharyya S.

Protein was measured by BCA™ protein assay kit, using bovine serum albumin as standard. Measurement of Sulfated Glycosaminoglycan—Total sulfated glycan content, including chondroitin 4-sulfate, chondroitin 6-sulfate, keratan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, HS, and heparin, were measured in cell lysates by sulfated GAG assay (Blyscan™, Biocolor Ltd., Newtownabbey, Northern Ireland), using labeled 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue. The sulfated polysaccharide component of PG and protein-free sulfated GAG chains are measured, whereas degraded disaccharide fragments or hyaluronan are not. The reaction is performed in the presence of excess unbound dye. The cationic dye and GAG at acid pH produce an insoluble dye-GAG complex, and the GAG content is determined by the amount of dye that is recovered from the test sample following exposure to Blyscan dissociation reagent. Absorbance maximum of 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue is 656 nm. Concentration is expressed as micrograms/mg of protein of cell lysate. Chondroitinase ABC Digestion of MCF-7 Cell Lysates—Cell lysates were prepared from the harvested MCF-7 cells following overexpression and silencing by siRNA of ASB and GALNS. Chondroitinase ABC, 0.1 unit (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to each tube, and lysate was digested for 1 h at 37 °C. After digestion, the mixture was dialyzed overnight in a Dispo-Biodialyzer (Sigma) with 1-kDa molecular mass limit, to separate undigested GAGs from the products of chondroitinase digestion. The undigested molecules were recovered from the tube and subjected to sulfated GAG assay. Keratanase Digestion of MCF-7 Cell Lysates—Content of keratan sulfate (KS) was calculated following digestion of MCF-7 cell lysates by keratanase (0.1 unit for 1 h at 37 °C; Sigma). Following digestion, the mixture was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in a dispo-biodialyzer (Sigma) with 1-kDa molecular mass limit, to separate undigested GAGs from the products of keratanase digestion. The undigested molecules were recovered from the tube and sGAG content determined, as previously described. Similar analysis was performed in cell lysates prepared following overexpression of ASB and of GALNS for 48 h. Immunoprecipitation of MCF-7 Cell Lysates by C4S and CS Antibodies—Cell lysates were prepared from treated and control cells. C4S (4D1) and CS (CS-56) antibodies were procured (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). These antibodies are not specific for the CS stubs, but instead detect native C4S or total CS. There is no prior enzymatic digestion of the cell samples by chondroitinase ABC with these antibodies. To exclude cross-reactivity of the anti-C4S with CS-E and to determine the yield from immunoprecipitation, we tested the immunoprecipitation of C4S (10 μg, Biocolor Ltd.) and of CS-E (10 μg, Cape Cod Associates, East Falmouth, MA) with the C4S antibody (1 μg). Minimal reactivity with CS-E (recovery of 0.71 ± 0.03 μg increasing to 0.84 ± 0.04 μg with 2 μg of antibody) was demonstrated. Recovery of C4S was 93.3 ± 2.7%. The CS-56 antibody is a mouse monoclonal antibody, raised against ventral membranes of chicken gizzard fibroblasts, that does not detect dermatan sulfate (15Avnur Z. Geiger B. Cell. 1984; 38: 811-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The antibodies were added to the cell lysates (C4S antibody at a concentration of 1 μg/mg of protein; CS to a final dilution of 1:50), and tubes were rotated overnight in a shaker at 4 °C. Next, 100 μl of pre-washed Protein L-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to each tube, and the tubes were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The Protein L-agarose-treated beads were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing Protease Inhibitor Mixture. The precipitate was eluted with dye-free elution buffer and subjected to sulfated GAG assay as described above. Soluble Syndecan-1 Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Syndecan-1 in the MCF-7 cell lysate and spent medium was measured by commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay Kit for human soluble syndecan-1 (hCD138, Cell Sciences, MA). At the termination of overexpression or RNA silencing procedures (48 h of incubation), MCF-7 cells were harvested, and spent medium was collected and stored at –80 °C. Cell lysates were prepared in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl containing 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, and 0.1% SDS, pH 7.4), microcentrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and clear supernatant used as cell extract containing solubilized syndecan-1. Syndecan-1 in the MCF-7 cell extracts and spent medium was determined by solid-phase sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, following the manufacturer's instructions. Syndecan-1 molecules in the samples were captured in the wells of a microtiter plate that was pre-coated with specific monoclonal antibody to syndecan-1. Immobilized syndecan-1 molecules were detected by a second monoclonal antibody to syndecan-1 that was conjugated with biotin and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase complex. The enzyme activity bound to the syndecan-1 molecules was determined by chromogenic reaction using hydrogen peroxide/tetramethylbenzidine. The color developed due to enzymatic activity was stopped by 1.8 n sulfuric acid, and intensity of color was measured at 450 nm in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay Plate reader (SLT, Spectra) with a reference filter of 620 nm. Syndecan-1 concentrations in the samples were extrapolated from a standard curve derived using known syndecan-1 quantities. Sample values were normalized with total cell protein concentrations determined using BCA™ Protein assay kit. Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was prepared from control, vector control, and plasmid transfected MCF-7 cells using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Equal amounts of RNA from all samples were reverse transcribed and amplified in a one-step reaction using Brilliant SYBR Green QRT-PCR Master Mix kit (Stratagene). QRT-PCR was performed using a Mx3000P system (Stratagene). Syndecan-1 and decorin were amplified with specific primers that were designed using NCBI data base and Primer 3 software. hβ-Actin was used as an internal control. Primers were as follows. Syndecan-1 (NM_001202): Forward, 5′-CTCTGTGCCTTCGTCTTTCC-3′, Reverse, 5′-CCACCTTCCTTTGCCATTT-3′; Decorin (NM_001202): Forward, 5′-GCCTTTTTGGTGTTGTGTCC-3′, Reverse, 5′-TGGCTAAGTTGGGATTGAGTTT-3′; Hβ-actin (NM_001101): Forward, 5′-GCCCCAAAAAGCAAAGATCA-3′, Reverse, 5′-CCAGGAAGGAAGGCTGGAA-3′. Optimal Tm of the primers was calculated from Primer 3 software. The -fold changes of specific mRNAs following transfection were determined from the difference between the cycle thresholds of amplification (CT) by using Equations 1, 2, 3. Foldchanges=2Δ3withΔ3=Δ1-Δ2(Eq. 1) Δ1=CTcontroltargetgene-CTcontrolactin(Eq. 2) Δ2=CTtreatedtargetgene-CTtreatedactin(Eq. 3) Immunoprecipitation with Syndecan-1 and Decorin Antibodies—To determine the fraction of cellular sGAG associated with syndecan-1 and with decorin, MCF-7 cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated using antibodies to syndecan-1 (SC-5632, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and to decorin (SC-22753, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a concentration of 2 μg/mg of protein. The antibodies were added to the cell lysates, and tubes were rotated overnight in a shaker at 4 °C. Next, 40 μl of pre-washed Protein A/G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to each tube, and the tubes were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The treated beads were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing Protease Inhibitor Mixture. The precipitate was eluted with dye-free elution buffer and sulfated GAG measured as described above. To determine the fraction of the syndecan-1-associated sGAG that was CS, the immunoprecipitate obtained by incubation with syndecan-1 antibody was treated with chondroitinase ABC 0.1 unit (Sigma), as previously described. After digestion, the mixture was dialyzed overnight in a dispo-biodialyzer (Sigma), the undigested sGAGs with molecular mass of >1 kDa were recovered, and the sGAG content was measured. Statistical Analysis—Results are the mean ± S.D. of at least three biological determinations and two technical replicates of each. Statistical significance was determined by one-way analysis of variance followed by the Tukey-Kramer post-test to correct for multiple comparisons, using InStat3 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA), unless stated otherwise. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Three asterisks denote p < 0.001; two asterisks denote 0.001 < p < 0.01. ASB and GALNS Activity in Mammary Cells and following Overexpression in MCF-7 Cells—Determinations of ASB and GALNS activity were performed in normal mammary epithelial cells grown in tissue culture, malignant mammary tissue from surgical specimens, and MCF-7 cells. In normal mammary epithelial cells in tissue culture, ASB activity was 233.9 (±10.1) nmol/mg of protein/h and GALNS activity was 8.44 (±0.26) nmol/mg of protein/h. In malignant mammary tissue, ASB activity was 20.87 (±8.08) nmol/mg of protein/h and GALNS activity was 2.06 (±0.78) nmol/mg of protein/h. At baseline, MCF-7 cells had ASB activity of 54.07 (±0.44) and GALNS of 3.85 (±0.14) nmol/mg of protein/h. Transfection of MCF-7 cells with 2 μg of ASB-pCMV6-XL-4 vector increased the ASB activity in the cells 110% to 113.82 (±7.68) nmol/mg of protein/h, compared with control (p < 0.001, one-way analysis of variance with Tukey-Kramer post-test) (Table 1). Transfection of MCF-7 cells with 2 μg of GALNS increased the GALNS activity in the cells to 8.15 (±0.20), a 117% increase, and statistically significant compared with controls (p < 0.001, one-way analysis of variance and Tukey-Kramer post-test). Combined silencing of ASB and GALNS and combined overexpression of ASB and GALNS did not further change the decline or increase in enzymatic activity achieved by modification of ASB or GALNS alone.TABLE 1ASB and GALNS activity following silencing and overexpression in MCF-7 cellsActivity ± (S.D.)ASBGALNSnmol/mg protein/hControl54.07 (0.44)3.85 (0.14)Control siRNA52.12 (0.27)3.76 (0.06)ASB siRNA14.03 (1.05)aDifferences in ASB and GALNS activity in the MCF-7 cells following overexpression and silencing are statistically significant compared to control (p < 0.001, one-way analysis of variance, Tukey-Kramer post-test).3.61 (0.15)GALNS siRNA55.03 (3.48)0.95 (0.04)aDifferences in ASB and GALNS activity in the MCF-7 cells following overexpression and silencing are statistically significant compared to control (p < 0.001, one-way analysis of variance, Tukey-Kramer post-test).Vector control OE56.31 (5.22)3.71 (0.12)ASB OE108.00 (7.53)aDifferences in ASB and GALNS activity in the MCF-7 cells following overexpression and silencing are statistically significant compared to control (p < 0.001, one-way analysis of variance, Tukey-Kramer post-test).3.53 (0.13)GALNS OE54.04 (5.21)8.15 (0.20)aDifferences in ASB and GALNS activity in the MCF-7 cells following overexpression and silencing are statistically significant compared to control (p < 0.001, one-way analysis of variance, Tukey-Kramer post-test).Combined siRNA13.83 (0.86)aDifferences in ASB and GALNS activity in the MCF-7 cells following overexpression and silencing are statistically significant compared to control (p < 0.001, one-way analysis of variance, Tukey-Kramer post-test).0.90 (0.02)aDifferences in ASB and GALNS activity in the MCF-7 cells following overexpression and silencing are statistically significant compared to control (p < 0.001, one-way analysis of variance, Tukey-Kramer post-test).Combined OE119.67 (11.04)aDifferences in ASB and GALNS activity in the MCF-7 cells following overexpression and silencing are statistically significant compared to control (p < 0.001, one-way analysis of variance, Tukey-Kramer post-test).8.24 (0.45)aDifferences in ASB and GALNS activity in the MCF-7 cells following overexpression and silencing are statistically significant compared to control (p < 0.001, one-way analysis of variance, Tukey-Kramer post-test).a Differences in ASB and GALNS activity in the MCF-7 cells following overexpression and silencing are statistically significant compared to control (p < 0.001, one-way analysis of variance, Tukey-Kramer post-test). Open table in a new tab Reduced Sulfatase Activity following Silencing by siRNA in MCF-7 Cells—Silencing of ASB and GALNS activity by siRNA reduced the associated enzyme activity significantly (p < 0.001, one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey-Kramer post-test) (Table 1). ASB activity declined to 14.03 (±1.05) nmol/mg of protein/h, a decline of 74% following silencing by siRNA. GALNS activity declined to 0.97 ± 0.04 nmol/mg of protein/h, a decline of 75% when MCF-7 cells were transfected with GALNS siRNA. Combined silencing of both ASB and GALNS did not lead to further reduction in either the ASB or GALNS activity. When ASB was silenced, GALNS activity remained at control level, and reciprocally, reflecting high specificity of the silencing. Vector control for siRNA did not change the ASB or GALNS activity in MCF-7 cells, compared with the normal basal activity. Total Sulfated Glycosaminoglycan Content following Sulfatase Overexpression and Silencing—At baseline, sGAG content in the MCF-7 cells was 12.47 (±0.68) μg/mg of protein. Following ASB silencing, sGAG increased to 23.39 (±1.06) μg/mg of cell protein, and following GALNS silencing, sGAG increased to 18.73 (±1.53) μg/mg of protein (Fig. 1 and Table 2). In contrast, upon overexpression of ASB, sGAG declined to 6.78 (±0.72) μg/mg of protein, and following GALNS overexpression, sGAG decreased to 8.59 (±0.59) μg/mg of protein. These results are consistent with modification of GAG sulfation by sulfatases, and suggest that changes in ASB expression have more impact than changes in GALNS expression.TABLE 2sGAGs following silencing and overexpression of ASB and GALNSExperimentTotal sGAGa±S.D.

https://openalex.org/W2014704734,"Transcriptional activation of many genes involved in peroxisome-related functions is regulated by the Oaf1p, Pip2p, and Adr1p transcription factors in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have analyzed the in vivo binding characteristics of Oaf1p-Pip2p and found that this complex is recruited to its target oleate-response element (ORE) under all growth conditions tested. In addition, this complex also binds to ORE-containing genes that do not appear to be regulated by these proteins, as well as to some genes lacking conventional OREs. The recruitment of the Oaf1p-Pip2p complex was greatly increased upon glucose derepression, possibly due to Oaf1p phosphorylation with only moderate increases upon oleate induction. Thus, this complex may receive a nutritional cue while it is already bound to DNA, suggesting that, in addition to the increase in Oaf1p-Pip2p binding, other mechanism(s) such as enhanced Adr1p association may drive the expression of highly inducible fatty acid-responsive genes. Adr1p binds to target genes in an oleate-dependent fashion and is involved in Oaf1p-Pip2p binding. In turn, the Oaf1p-Pip2p complex appears to be important for Adr1p binding to a subset of oleate-responsive genes. Adr1p is a positive regulator of ORE-containing genes, but it also acts as a negative factor in expression of some of these genes. Finally, we have also shown that Adr1p is directly involved in mediating oleate induction of Oaf1p-Pip2p target genes.

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is able to use a wide variety of carbon sources to maintain vegetative growth. When fermentable sugars, such as glucose, are supplied into culture media, genes involved in utilization of less favorable nonfermentable carbon sources are turned off via a mechanism called glucose repression (1Gancedo J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 334-361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A switch from glucose to a nonfermentable carbon source triggers transcriptional activation of these genes through another pathway, termed glucose derepression (2Schuller H.J. Curr. Genet. 2003; 43: 139-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Some of these glucose-derepressible genes, however, are able to undergo further induction upon receiving additional nutritional signals. For example, the genes encoding β-oxidation enzymes become significantly induced when oleate is included in glycerol-containing growth media; the addition of oleate also leads to peroxisome proliferation (3Veenhuis M. Mateblowski M. Kunau W.H. Harder W. Yeast. 1987; 3: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The promoters of these genes share a common sequence motif termed oleate-response element (ORE) 4The abbreviations used are: ORE, oleate-response element; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; RT, reverse transcription; CIP, calf intestinal phosphatase; UAS, upstream activation sequence; HA, hemagglutinin; IP, immunoprecipitation. (4Einerhand A.W.C. Kos W.T. Distel B. Tabak H.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 314: 323-331Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This sequence is sufficient to act as an in vitro binding target for a trans-acting factor(s) responsible for oleate induction (4Einerhand A.W.C. Kos W.T. Distel B. Tabak H.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 314: 323-331Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We and others (5Karpichev I.V. Small G.M. Mol. Cell.

Biochem. 1997; 247: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) identified two highly homologous Zn2Cyc6 transcription factors, Oaf1p and Pip2p, which mediate oleate-dependent transcriptional activation of ORE-containing genes. Both of these proteins are required to trigger oleate-dependent induction and can be recruited by synthetic OREs in in vitro binding assays. Based on this experimental evidence, and by analogy with mammalian steroid hormone receptors (8Issemann I. Green S.

Nutr. 2001; 21: 193-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar), a model in which Oaf1p and Pip2p bind to OREs of target genes in the form of a heterodimer, presumably upon receiving an oleate nutritional signal, has been proposed (5Karpichev I.V. Small G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6560-6570Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 6Karpichev I.V. Luo Y. Marians R.C. Small G.M. Mol. Cell.

Oaf1p and Pip2p play different roles in oleate induction. Although both of these proteins possess ligand binding domains, only Oaf1p binds free fatty acids (11Phelps C. Gburcik V. Suslova E. Dudek P.

The different regulation of genes encoding Oaf1p and Pip2p probably reflects different roles of these proteins in oleate response, whereas OAF1 is constantly expressed under all growth conditions, PIP2 is tightly controlled by an autoregulation mechanism (5Karpichev I.V.

In an earlier study we conducted a global search for ORE-containing genes and identified 40 genes that have oleate response-like elements in their promoter regions (5Karpichev I.V. Small G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6560-6570Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that more than 20 genes, encoding proteins with various subcellular locations, are regulated by the Oaf1p-Pip2p transcription factors. These include a number of highly inducible genes, as well as some genes that are only moderately induced by oleate. Subsequently, several genome-wide searches for ORE-containing and oleate-inducible genes were carried out, and most of the yeast genes that are significantly up-regulated by fatty acids have been identified (14Smith J.J.

In this study, we have examined the binding characteristics of Oaf1p and Pip2p to their target sequences under three different growth conditions, including oleate induction, in vivo. We confirmed that Oaf1p requires Pip2p for binding and that these proteins act as a heterodimer on their binding sites under all growth conditions tested. We also demonstrated that, in contrast to the current view, the amount of Oaf1p-Pip2p complex bound to the ORE is significantly increased upon glucose derepression and increases only moderately upon oleate induction. Furthermore, we provide evidence that Oaf1p undergoes phosphorylation when cells are grown on glycerol- or oleate-containing media, and this post-translational modification may cause an increased Oaf1p-Pip2p binding under these conditions. Thus, Oaf1p most likely receives a fatty acid nutritional signal while it is already bound to DNA, therefore receiving such a signal does not cause the initial binding of Oaf1p-Pip2p to the ORE, as was previously thought. These data also suggest that the increase in Oaf1p-Pip2p binding upon a shift from glycerol to oleate is not sufficient to achieve maximal induction of highly inducible oleate-responsive genes, and therefore there must be an additional mechanism(s) involved in up-regulation of these genes. We have also demonstrated that Adr1p binds to its target sequences under derepression and induction growth conditions, and this binding appears to be oleate-dependent. Our findings indicate that Adr1p is involved in Oaf1p-Pip2p binding, and this complex, in turn, stimulates Adr1p recruitment to the promoters of a subset of genes. In addition, we determined that Adr1p is not only required for achieving maximal expression levels, but it also contributes to oleate induction of the Oaf1p-Pip2p target genes. Finally, we have shown that Adr1p, being a positive regulator of oleate induction of peroxisome-related genes, plays an additional role in maintaining low expression levels of some oleate-responsive genes under glucose derepression conditions (negative regulation).

Small G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6560-6570Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To create a plasmid that contains both Oaf1p-HA3 and the URA3 selectable marker, a DNA fragment encoding the OAF1-HA3 allele was subcloned into pRS306 (36Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to create pRS306OAF-1HA3. This plasmid was then linearized and integrated into the URA3 locus of the appropriate recipient yeast cells. PIP2-HA3—Three tandem copies of the HA epitope were added to the C terminus of the PIP2 gene product directly upstream from the stop codon, using a combination of PCR and subcloning techniques. The resulting DNA fragment encoding PIP2-HA3 was subcloned into pRS304 to create pRS304PIP-2HA3. This plasmid was then linearized and integrated into the TRP1 locus of our pip2Δ recipient strain. OAF1-myc13 and ADR1-myc13—Thirteen copies of the 10-amino acid human c-Myc epitope were integrated into the OAF1 or ADR1 chromosomal loci using pF6a-13Myc-TRP1 or pF6a-13MycHis3-MX6 heterologous modules for PCR-based gene targeting (37Bahler J.

PCR-based gene targeting approach was also used to disrupt the OAF1 gene in the ADR1-myc13 strain using pF6a-13Myc-TRP1 as a template. Similarly, the ADR1 gene was disrupted in our wild-type strain (see Table 1). To disrupt the ADR1 gene in the PIP2-HA3/OAF1-myc13 strain, a URA3 template was used instead of the pF6-based cassettes. The correct integration of the cassettes was verified by diagnostic PCR. The procedures described below for single and sequential ChIPs are modifications of the methods of Aparicio et al.

All buffers and stock solution recipes were taken from original protocols, except where described below. Lysate Preparation—Yeast cultures were grown in 200 ml of YPD, YPG, or YPGO as was described previously (5Karpichev I.V. Small G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6560-6570Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Cells were subsequently cross-linked in the media, harvested, and washed as described (32Aparicio, O., Geisberg, J. V., Sekinger, E., Yang, A., Moqtaderi, Z., and Struhl, K. (2005) in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K., eds) pp. 21.3.1–21.3.33, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar). The fixed cells were resuspended in 6–10 ml of FAPI buffer (FA buffer supplemented with complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). 1-ml aliquots of this suspension were placed in 2-ml Eppendorf tubes, and ∼1 ml of glass beads (diameter ∼ 0.5 mm) was added to every sample. The suspensions were incubated, with shaking, for 1.5–2 h at 4 °C. The cell lysates were collected together and centrifuged as described (32Aparicio, O., Geisberg, J. V., Sekinger, E., Yang, A., Moqtaderi, Z., and Struhl, K. (2005) in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K., eds) pp. 21.3.1–21.3.33, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar). The resultant pellets, containing cross-linked chromatin, were resuspended in 4 ml of FAPI buffer, and the volume was brought to 5 ml if required. The suspension was sonicated on ice 20 times for 30 s using continuous pulse with 1-min intervals at a power output of ∼15% using a W-385 sonicator (Heat Systems-Ultrasonics, Farmingdale, NY). Following sonication, the lysate was split into 2-ml Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged in a refrigerated microcentrifuge at maximum speed for 30 min. The recovered supernatants were pooled and passed through a 0.22-μm syringe filter. A 100-μl sample was then taken to confirm DNA fragmentation (32Aparicio, O., Geisberg, J. V., Sekinger, E., Yang, A., Moqtaderi, Z., and Struhl, K. (2005) in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K., eds) pp. 21.3.1–21.3.33, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar), and the volume of the remaining lysate was adjusted to 5 ml with FAPI buffer. The lysate was divided into 500-μl aliquots placed in Eppendorf tubes, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. Before using the lysate in ChIP assays, it was titrated to determine the amount of respective antibody required to precipitate between 50 and 90% of the antigen in question as described (32Aparicio, O., Geisberg, J. V., Sekinger, E., Yang, A., Moqtaderi, Z., and Struhl, K. (2005) in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K., eds) pp. 21.3.1–21.3.33, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar). Single ChIP Assay—For an individual single ChIP, 250 –500 μl of the lysate was taken into an Eppendorf tube, and the volume was brought to 1 ml with FAPI buffer. A 50-μl sample was taken to determine the amount of DNA present in the assay (input sample), and a 30-μl sample was taken to determine the amount of antigen in the assay (T-sample). These samples were processed as described (32Aparicio, O., Geisberg, J. V., Sekinger, E., Yang, A., Moqtaderi, Z., and Struhl, K. (2005) in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (Ausubel, F.

Upon addition of antibody, the tube was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h on an Orbitron Rotator. 50 μl of protein G-agarose beads (Roche Applied Science) were then added, and the incubation was continued overnight. The sample was washed, eluted with 100 μl of the appropriate peptide elution buffer, and reverse cross-linked as described (32Aparicio, O., Geisberg, J.

https://openalex.org/W1979840261,"We present here the characterisation of the Leishmania small G protein ADP-Ribosylation Factor-Like protein 1 (ARL-1). The ARL-1 gene is present in one copy per haploid genome and conserved among trypanosomatids. It encodes a protein of 20 kDa, which is equally expressed in the insect promastigote and mammalian amastigote forms of the parasite. ARL-1 localises to the Trans-Golgi Network (TGN); N-terminal myristoylation is essential for TGN localisation. In vivo expression of the LdARL-1/Q74L and LdARL-1/T51N mutants (GTP- and GDP-bound blocked forms respectively) shows that GDP/GTP cycling occurs entirely within the TGN. This is contrary to previous reports in yeast and mammals, where the mutant empty form devoid of nucleotide has been considered as the GDP-blocked form. The dominant-negative empty form mutant LdARL-1/T34N inhibits endocytosis and intracellular trafficking from the TGN to the Lysosome/Multivesicular Tubule and to the acidocalcisomes; these defects are probably related to a mislocalisation of the GRIP domain-containing vesicle tethering factors which cannot be recruited to the TGN by the cytoplasmic LdARL-1/T34N. Thus, besides the functional characterization of a new mutant and a better understanding of ARL-1 GDP/GTP cycling, this work shows that Leishmania ARL-1 is a key component of an essential pathway worth future study."
https://openalex.org/W1972467585,"Background Muscleblind-like proteins (MBNL) have been involved in a developmental switch in the use of defined cassette exons. Such transition fails in the CTG repeat expansion disease myotonic dystrophy due, in part, to sequestration of MBNL proteins by CUG repeat RNA. Four protein isoforms (MblA-D) are coded by the unique Drosophila muscleblind gene. Methodology/Principal Findings We used evolutionary, genetic and cell culture approaches to study muscleblind (mbl) function in flies. The evolutionary study showed that the MblC protein isoform was readily conserved from nematods to Drosophila, which suggests that it performs the most ancestral muscleblind functions. Overexpression of MblC in the fly eye precursors led to an externally rough eye morphology. This phenotype was used in a genetic screen to identify five dominant suppressors and 13 dominant enhancers including Drosophila CUG-BP1 homolog aret, exon junction complex components tsunagi and Aly, and pro-apoptotic genes Traf1 and reaper. We further investigated Muscleblind implication in apoptosis and splicing regulation. We found missplicing of troponin T in muscleblind mutant pupae and confirmed Muscleblind ability to regulate mouse fast skeletal muscle Troponin T (TnnT3) minigene splicing in human HEK cells. MblC overexpression in the wing imaginal disc activated apoptosis in a spatially restricted manner. Bioinformatics analysis identified a conserved FKRP motif, weakly resembling a sumoylation target site, in the MblC-specific sequence. Site-directed mutagenesis of the motif revealed no change in activity of mutant MblC on TnnT3 minigene splicing or aberrant binding to CUG repeat RNA, but altered the ability of the protein to form perinuclear aggregates and enhanced cell death-inducing activity of MblC overexpression. Conclusions/Significance Taken together our genetic approach identify cellular processes influenced by Muscleblind function, whereas in vivo and cell culture experiments define Drosophila troponin T as a new Muscleblind target, reveal a potential involvement of MblC in programmed cell death and recognize the FKRP motif as a putative regulator of MblC function and/or subcellular location in the cell."
https://openalex.org/W2052487228,"Targeted deletion of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 2 (ACAT2) (A2), especially in the liver, protects hyperlipidemic mice from diet-induced hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis, whereas the deletion of ACAT1 (A1) is not as effective, suggesting ACAT2 may be the more appropriate target for treatment of atherosclerosis. Among the numerous ACAT inhibitors known, pyripyropene A (PPPA) is the only compound that has high selectivity (>2000-fold) for inhibition of ACAT2 compared with ACAT1. In the present study we sought to determine the PPPA interaction site of ACAT2. To achieve this goal we made several chimeric proteins where parts of ACAT2 were replaced by the analogous region of ACAT1. Differences in the amino acid sequence and the membrane topology were utilized to design the chimeras. Among chimeras, A2:1-428/A1:444-550 had 50% reduced PPPA selectivity, whereas C-terminal-truncated ACAT2 mutant A2:1-504 (C-terminal last 22 amino acids were deleted) remained selectively inhibited, indicating the PPPA-sensitive site is located within a region between amino acids 440 and 504. Three additional chimeras within this region helped narrow down the PPPA-sensitive site to a region containing amino acids 480-504, representing the fifth putative transmembrane domain of ACAT2. Subsequently, for this region we made single amino acid mutants where each amino acid in ACAT2 was individually changed to its ACAT1 counterpart. Mutation of Q492L, V493L, S494A resulted in only 30, 50, and 70% inhibition of the activity by PPPA, respectively (as opposed to greater than 95% with the wild type enzyme), suggesting these three residues are responsible for the selective inhibition by PPPA of ACAT2. Additionally, we found that PPPA non-covalently interacts with ACAT2 apparently without altering the oligomeric structure of the protein. The present study provides the first evidence for a unique motif in ACAT2 that can be utilized for making an ACAT2-specific drug."
https://openalex.org/W1982406880,"The historical spatio-temporal distribution of invasive species is rarely documented, hampering efforts to understand invasion dynamics, especially at regional scales. Reconstructing historical invasions through use of herbarium records combined with spatial trend analysis and modeling can elucidate spreading patterns and identify susceptible habitats before invasion occurs. Two perennial species were chosen to contrast historic and potential phytogeographies: Japanese knotweed (Polygonum cuspidatum), introduced intentionally across the US; and mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris), introduced largely accidentally to coastal areas. Spatial analysis revealed that early in the invasion, both species have a stochastic distribution across the contiguous US, but east of the 90(th) meridian, which approximates the Mississippi River, quickly spread to adjacent counties in subsequent decades. In contrast, in locations west of the 90(th) meridian, many populations never spread outside the founding county, probably a result of encountering unfavorable environmental conditions. Regression analysis using variables categorized as environmental or anthropogenic accounted for 24% (Japanese knotweed) and 30% (mugwort) of the variation in the current distribution of each species. Results show very few counties with high habitat suitability (>/=80%) remain un-invaded (5 for Japanese knotweed and 6 for mugwort), suggesting these perennials are reaching the limits of large-scale expansion. Despite differences in initial introduction loci and pathways, Japanese knotweed and mugwort demonstrate similar historic patterns of spread and show declining rates of regional expansion. Invasion mitigation efforts should be concentrated on areas identified as highly susceptible that border invaded regions, as both species demonstrate secondary expansion from introduction loci."
https://openalex.org/W2015941401,"Chromosomal instability (CIN) plays a crucial role in tumor development and occurs mainly as the consequence of either missegregation of normal chromosomes (MSG) or structural rearrangement (SR). However, little is known about the respective chromosomal targets of MSG and SR and the way these processes combined within tumors to generate CIN. To address these questions, we karyotyped a consecutive series of 96 near-diploid colorectal cancers (CRCs) and distinguished chromosomal changes generated by either MSG or SR in tumor cells. Eighty-three tumors (86%) presented with chromosomal abnormalities that contained both MSGs and SRs to varying degrees whereas all 13 others (14%) showed normal karyotype. Using a maximum likelihood statistical method, chromosomes affected by MSG or SR and likely to represent changes that are selected for during tumor progression were found to be different and mostly mutually exclusive. MSGs and SRs were not randomly associated within tumors, delineating two major pathways of chromosome alterations that consisted of either chromosome gains by MSG or chromosomal losses by both MSG and SR. CRCs showing microsatellite instability (MSI) presented with either normal karyotype or chromosome gains whereas MSS (microsatellite stable) CRCs exhibited a combination of the two pathways. Taken together, these data provide new insights into the respective involvement of MSG and SR in near-diploid colorectal cancers, showing how these processes target distinct portions of the genome and result in specific patterns of chromosomal changes according to MSI status."

Acute infection was diagnosed following a positive HIV RNA PCR in the absence of antibodies, or detection of HIV-1 antibodies within 3 months of a previously negative antibody test. Haemotologic parameters were assessed before infection and at regular intervals in the first twelve months of HIV infection.Fifty-seven participants with acute HIV infection were identified at a median of 14.5 days post-infection (range 10-81) and were enrolled in the CAPRISA Acute Infection cohort at a median of 41 days post-infection (range 15-104). Mean haemoglobin prior to HIV-1 infection was 12.7 g/dL, with a mean decline of 0.46 g/dL following infection. The prevalence of anaemia increased from 25.0% prior to HIV-1 infection to 52.6% at 3 months post-infection, 61.1% at 6 months post-infection, and 51.4% at 12 months post-infection.Haematologic derangements and anaemia with a trend towards iron deficiency are common with acute HIV-1 subtype C infection in this small cohort. The negative impact of anaemia concurrent with established HIV infection upon morbidity and mortality has been well documented but the prognostic potential and long-term effects of anaemia during acute HIV-1 infection remain unknown."
https://openalex.org/W2084686007,"In order to clear the body of infecting spirochetes, phagocytic cells must be able to get hold of them. In real-time phase-contrast videomicroscopy we were able to measure the speed of Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), the Lyme spirochete, moving back and forth across a platelet to which it was tethered. Its mean crossing speed was 1,636 µm/min (N = 28), maximum, 2800 µm/min (N = 3). This is the fastest speed recorded for a spirochete, and upward of two orders of magnitude above the speed of a human neutrophil, the fastest cell in the body. This alacrity and its interpretation, in an organism with bidirectional motor capacity, may well contribute to difficulties in spirochete clearance by the host."
https://openalex.org/W2049133227,"Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) and Rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV) belong to distinct genera of pararetroviruses infecting dicot and monocot plants, respectively. In both viruses, polycistronic translation of pregenomic (pg) RNA is initiated by shunting ribosomes that bypass a large region of the pgRNA leader with several short (s)ORFs and a stable stem-loop structure. The shunt requires translation of a 5'-proximal sORF terminating near the stem. In CaMV, mutations knocking out this sORF nearly abolish shunting and virus viability.Here we show that two distant regions of the CaMV leader that form a minimal shunt configuration comprising the sORF, a bottom part of the stem, and a shunt landing sequence can be replaced by heterologous sequences that form a structurally similar configuration in RTBV without any dramatic effect on shunt-mediated translation and CaMV infectivity. The CaMV-RTBV chimeric leader sequence was largely stable over five viral passages in turnip plants: a few alterations that did eventually occur in the virus progenies are indicative of fine tuning of the chimeric sequence during adaptation to a new host.Our findings demonstrate cross-species functionality of pararetroviral cis-elements driving ribosome shunting and evolutionary conservation of the shunt mechanism. We are grateful to Matthias Müller and Sandra Pauli for technical assistance. This work was initiated at Friedrich Miescher Institute (Basel, Switzerland). We thank Prof. Thomas Boller for hosting the group at the Institute of Botany."
https://openalex.org/W1965585843,"The spindle checkpoint ensures the accurate segregation of chromosomes by monitoring the status of kinetochore attachment to microtubules. Simultaneous mutations in one of several kinetochore and cohesion genes and a spindle checkpoint gene cause a synthetic-lethal or synthetic-sick phenotype. A synthetic genetic array (SGA) analysis using a mad2Δ query mutant strain of yeast identified YBP2, a gene whose product shares sequence similarity with the product of YBP1, which is required for H2O2-induced oxidation of the transcription factor Yap1. ybp2Δ was sensitive to benomyl and accumulated at the mitotic stage of the cell cycle. Ybp2 physically associates with proteins of the COMA complex (Ctf19, Okp1, Mcm21, and Ame1) and 3 components of the Ndc80 complex (Ndc80, Nuf2, and Spc25 but not Spc24) in the central kinetochore and with Cse4 (the centromeric histone and CENP-A homolog). Chromatin-immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that Ybp2 associates specifically with CEN DNA. Furthermore, ybp2Δ showed synthetic-sick interactions with mutants of the genes that encode the COMA complex components. Ybp2 seems to be part of a macromolecular kinetochore complex and appears to contribute to the proper associations among the central kinetochore subcomplexes and the kinetochore-specific nucleosome."
https://openalex.org/W1993808672,"Homologous recombination is a dominant force in evolution and results in genetic mosaics. To detect evidence of recombination events and assess the biological significance of genetic mosaics, genome sequences for various viral populations of reasonably large size are now available in the GenBank. We studied a multi-functional viral gene, the adeno-associated virus (AAV) cap gene, which codes for three capsid proteins, VP1, VP2 and VP3. VP1-3 share a common C-terminal domain corresponding to VP3, which forms the viral core structure, while the VP1 unique N-terminal part contains an enzymatic domain with phospholipase A2 activity. Our recombinant detection program (RecI) revealed five novel recombination events, four of which have their cross-over points in the N-terminal, VP1 and VP2 unique region. Comparison of phylogenetic trees for different cap gene regions confirmed discordant phylogenies for the recombinant sequences. Furthermore, differences in the phylogenetic tree structures for the VP1 unique (VP1u) region and the rest of cap highlighted the mosaic nature of cap gene in the AAV population: two dominant forms of VP1u sequences were identified and these forms are linked to diverse sequences in the rest of cap gene. This observation together with the finding of frequent recombination in the VP1 and 2 unique regions suggests that this region is a recombination hot spot. Recombination events in this region preserve protein blocks of distinctive functions and contribute to convergence in VP1u and divergence of the rest of cap. Additionally the possible biological significance of two dominant VP1u forms is inferred."
https://openalex.org/W2005506229,"In vitro display technologies such as mRNA display are powerful screening tools for protein interaction analysis, but the final cloning and sequencing processes represent a bottleneck, resulting in many false negatives. Here we describe an application of tiling array technology to identify specifically binding proteins selected with the in vitro virus (IVV) mRNA display technology. We constructed transcription-factor tiling (TFT) arrays containing ∼1,600 open reading frame sequences of known and predicted mouse transcription-regulatory factors (334,372 oligonucleotides, 50-mer in length) to analyze cDNA fragments from mRNA-display screening for Jun-associated proteins. The use of the TFT arrays greatly increased the coverage of known Jun-interactors to 28% (from 14% with the cloning and sequencing approach), without reducing the accuracy (∼75%). This method could detect even targets with extremely low expression levels (less than a single mRNA copy per cell in whole brain tissue). This highly sensitive and reliable method should be useful for high-throughput protein interaction analysis on a genome-wide scale."
https://openalex.org/W1981798546,"The need for effective collaboration tools is growing as multidisciplinary proteome-wide projects and distributed research teams become more common. The resulting data is often quite disparate, stored in separate locations, and not contextually related. Collaborative Molecular Modeling Environment (C-ME) is an interactive community-based collaboration system that allows researchers to organize information, visualize data on a two-dimensional (2-D) or three-dimensional (3-D) basis, and share and manage that information with collaborators in real time. C-ME stores the information in industry-standard databases that are immediately accessible by appropriate permission within the computer network directory service or anonymously across the internet through the C-ME application or through a web browser. The system addresses two important aspects of collaboration: context and information management. C-ME allows a researcher to use a 3-D atomic structure model or a 2-D image as a contextual basis on which to attach and share annotations to specific atoms or molecules or to specific regions of a 2-D image. These annotations provide additional information about the atomic structure or image data that can then be evaluated, amended or added to by other project members."
