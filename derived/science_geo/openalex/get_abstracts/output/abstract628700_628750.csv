https://openalex.org/W2918137318,"The nitrogen cycle has been radically changed by human activities1. China consumes nearly one third of the world’s nitrogen fertilizers. The excessive application of fertilizers2,3 and increased nitrogen discharge from livestock, domestic and industrial sources have resulted in pervasive water pollution. Quantifying a nitrogen ‘boundary’4 in heterogeneous environments is important for the effective management of local water quality. Here we use a combination of water-quality observations and simulated nitrogen discharge from agricultural and other sources to estimate spatial patterns of nitrogen discharge into water bodies across China from 1955 to 2014. We find that the critical surface-water quality standard (1.0 milligrams of nitrogen per litre) was being exceeded in most provinces by the mid-1980s, and that current rates of anthropogenic nitrogen discharge (14.5 ± 3.1 megatonnes of nitrogen per year) to fresh water are about 2.7 times the estimated ‘safe’ nitrogen discharge threshold (5.2 ± 0.7 megatonnes of nitrogen per year). Current efforts to reduce pollution through wastewater treatment and by improving cropland nitrogen management can partially remedy this situation. Domestic wastewater treatment has helped to reduce net discharge by 0.7 ± 0.1 megatonnes in 2014, but at high monetary and energy costs. Improved cropland nitrogen management could remove another 2.3 ± 0.3 megatonnes of nitrogen per year—about 25 per cent of the excess discharge to fresh water. Successfully restoring a clean water environment in China will further require transformational changes to boost the national nutrient recycling rate from its current average of 36 per cent to about 87 per cent, which is a level typical of traditional Chinese agriculture. Although ambitious, such a high level of nitrogen recycling is technologically achievable at an estimated capital cost of approximately 100 billion US dollars and operating costs of 18–29 billion US dollars per year, and could provide co-benefits such as recycled wastewater for crop irrigation and improved environmental quality and ecosystem services. Estimates of spatial patterns of nitrogen discharge into water bodies across China between 1955 and 2014 show that current discharge rates are almost three times the acceptable threshold, and ways to restore a clean water environment are suggested."

Successful adoption and sustainable integration of information technology-based eHealth and telemedicine concepts in clinical practice depend on constant evaluation of end user needs, proficiencies, and preferences. We therefore assessed how current and future healthcare professionals perceived health technology solutions and whether their perceptions differed. We conducted an online survey among a purposive sample of employees and students at the Medical University of Vienna, Austria. The structured questionnaire collected self-reported practices and beliefs in the context of eHealth and telemedicine among 905 participants (59.0% females), of which 48.4% were employees and 51.6% were students. Participants expressed moderate knowledge of eHealth and telemedicine concepts with higher levels among employees compared to students (both: p<0.05). Compared to employees, students were less convinced that online health information improves patient knowledge (p<0.001), but were more optimistic that telemedicine reduces healthcare costs (p<0.05). Participants doubted that telemedicine services would enhance the doctor-patient relationship and raised concerns regarding data security and privacy issues. Accordingly, quantitative context analysis of free text comments revealed that the four most frequently mentioned themes were related to issues concerning data privacy and security, questions of responsibility, doctor-patient interaction, and reliability of information. This study provides valuable insights into how current and future healthcare professionals differ in their perceptions regarding eHealth and telemedicine. These findings raise awareness of the need to bridge the gap between digital age groups and professional groups, especially in clinical healthcare delivery in a clocked-through, strenuous academic setting as found at a medical university."
https://openalex.org/W2919925093,"Background Nutrition outcomes among young children in Nigeria are among the worse globally. Mother’s limited knowledge about food choices, feeding, and health care seeking practices contributes significantly to negative nutrition outcomes for children in most developing countries. Much less is known about the relationship between mother’s nutrition-related knowledge and child nutritional outcomes in rural Nigeria. This paper investigates therefore: (i) the association of mother’s nutrition-related knowledge with nutrition outcomes of young children living in rural Nigeria, where access to education is limited, and (ii) whether mother’s education has a complementary effect on such knowledge in producing positive child nutrition outcomes in such settings. Methods Using the Demographic and Health Survey data for Nigeria, we employ both descriptive and regression analyses approaches in analyzing the study’s objectives. In particular, we apply ordinary least square (OLS) to investigate the association of mother’s nutrition-related knowledge with child HAZ and WHZ while controlling for maternal, child, household and regional characteristics. An index was constructed for mother’s nutrition-related knowledge using information on dietary practices, disease treatment and prevention, child immunization, and family planning. Results We found that mother’s knowledge is independently and positively associated with HAZ and WHZ scores in young children. Higher levels of mother’s education, typically above primary, have a significant, positive association with child HAZ and WHZ scores. We argue that mother’s knowledge of health and nutrition may substitute for education in reducing undernutrition in young children among populations with limited access to formal education. However, the present level of mother’s education in rural Nigeria appears insufficient to reinforce knowledge in producing better nutrition outcomes for children. Conclusions This study suggests promotion of out-of-school (informal) education, such as adult literacy and numeracy classes where women without formal education can gain health and nutrition knowledge, and practices that could enhance child nutrition outcomes in Nigeria."
https://openalex.org/W2918548227,"Benefits of antibiotics are threatened by the self-medication, people's lack of knowledge and inappropriate use of antibiotics, especially in developing countries. This study was designed to determine knowledge; attitudes and practices toward antibiotics use in an urban community, and evaluate the factors that are associated with antibiotic use. Between January and March 2015, a cross sectional and prospective study was conducted in all pharmacies within the Douala IV health district, Cameroon. Anonymous interviews including both open and closed ended questions were conducted in participants selected by convenience sampling Descriptive and logistic regression analysis were performed using StataSE11 software (version 11 SE) and R software (version 3.1.1) in data analysis. Overall 402 (33.7%) of 1,192 customers purchased antibiotics and of these, 47% bought antibiotics without a prescription. 60.7% of purchased antibiotics was for adult 'patients and around 60% of parents carried out self-medication on their children. The vast majority reported that all microbes can be treated with antibiotics (88.3%). The belief that antibiotics are appropriate for bacterial infections was more common among those with a higher level education (OR = 4.03, 95%CI:1.89-8.57, p<0.0001) and among public/private servants (OR = 2.47, 95%CI:1.21-5.08, p = 0.013). Physicians provide less explanations about antibiotics are and their potential side effects than the pharmacy auxiliaries (OR = 0.205, 95%CI = 0.09-0.46, p<0.0001), but more than pharmacists (OR = 3.692, 95%CI:1.44-9.25, p = 0.005). Indications on antibiotics use were 7 times more given to customers with a prescription compared to those without a prescription (OR = 7.37, 95% CI = 2.13-25.43, p = 0.002). Adult male (OR = 2.32, 95%CI:1.24-4.34, p = 0.009) and higher education (OR = 2.05, 95%CI:1.08-3.89, p = 0.027) were significantly associated with self-medication. Misuse, little ""practical knowledge"" and high self-medication confirm the unsatisfactory prescription and dispensing practices of the antibiotics in our country. These results highlight the important of the development and implementation appropriate guidelines for the responsible use of antibiotics for health care providers and health education targeting community members themselves."
https://openalex.org/W2915939486,"Staphylococcus epidermidis, is a common microflora of human body that can cause opportunistic infections associated with indwelling devices. It is resistant to multiple antibiotics necessitating the need for naturally occurring antibacterial agents. Malaysian propolis, a natural product obtained from beehives exhibits antimicrobial and antibiofilm properties. Chitosan-propolis nanoparticles (CPNP) were prepared using Malaysian propolis and tested for their effect against S. epidermidis. The cationic nanoparticles depicted a zeta potential of +40 and increased the net electric charge (zeta potential) of S. epidermidis from -17 to -11 mV in a concentration-dependent manner whereas, ethanol (Eth) and ethyl acetate (EA) extracts of propolis further decreased the zeta potential from -17 to -20 mV. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) depicted that CPNP effectively disrupted biofilm formation by S. epidermidis and decreased viability to ~25% compared to Eth and EA with viability of ~60-70%. CPNP was more effective in reducing the viability of both planktonic as well as biofilm bacteria compared to Eth and EA. At 100 μg/mL concentration, CPNP decreased the survival of biofilm bacteria by ~70% compared to Eth or EA extracts which decreased viability by only 40%-50%. The morphology of bacterial biofilm examined by scanning electron microscopy depicted partial disruption of biofilm by Eth and EA extracts and significant disruption by CPNP reducing bacterial number in the biofilm by ~90%. Real time quantitative PCR analysis of gene expression in treated bacteria showed that genes involved in intercellular adhesion such as IcaABCD, embp and other related genes were significantly downregulated by CPNP. In addition to having a direct inhibitory effect on the survival of S. epidermidis, CPNP showed synergism with the antibiotics rifampicin, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin and doxycycline suggestive of effective treatment regimens. This would help decrease antibiotic treatment dose by at least 4-fold in combination therapies thereby opening up ways of tackling antibiotic resistance in bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2919118401,"Human endogenous retroviruses are remnants of ancient germline infections that make up approximately 8% of the modern human genome. The HERV-K (HML-2) family is one of the most recent entrants into the human germline, these viruses appear to be transcriptionally active, and HERV-K viral like particles (VLPs) are found in cell lines from a number of human malignancies. HERV-K VLPs were first found to be produced in teratocarcinoma cell lines, and since then teratocarcinoma has been thought of as the classical model for HERV-Ks, with the NCCIT teratocarcinoma cell line particularly known to produce VLPs. Treatment for teratocarcinoma has progressed since its discovery, with improved prognosis for patients. Since the introduction of platinum based therapy, first year survival has greatly improved even with disseminated disease; however, it is estimated that 20% to 30% of patients present with metastatic germ cell tumor relapse following initial treatments. Also, the toxicity associated with the use of chemotherapeutic agents used to treat germ cell tumors is still a major concern. In this study, we show that the depletion of the HERV-K accessory protein Np9 increases the sensitivity of NCCIT teratocarcinoma cells to bleomycin and cisplatin. While decreasing the expression of Np9 had only a modest effect on the baseline viability of the cells, the reduced expression of Np9 increased the sensitivity of the teratocarcinoma cells to environmental (serum starvation) and chemical (chemotherapeutic) stresses. Np9 is also essential to the migration of NCCIT teratocarcinoma cells: in a wound closure assay, reduced expression of Np9 resulted in cells migrating into the wound at a slower rate, whereas reintroduction of Np9 resulted in NCCIT cells migrating back into the wound in a manner similar to the control. These findings support the implication that the HERV-K accessory protein Np9 has oncogenic potential."

The respective role of IgG Fc and Fab glycosylation in mediating ANCA pathogenicity is incompletely understood. Herein we investigate in detail the changes in Fc and Fab glycosylation in MPO-ANCA and Pr3-ANCA and examine the association of glycosylation aberrancies with disease activity.Total IgG was isolated from serum or plasma of a cohort of 30 patients with AAV (14 MPO-ANCA; 16 PR3-ANCA), and 19 healthy control subjects. Anti-MPO specific IgG was affinity-purified from plasma of an additional cohort of 18 MPO-ANCA patients undergoing plasmapheresis. We used lectin binding assays, liquid chromatography, and mass spectrometry-based methods to analyze Fc and Fab glycosylation, the degree of sialylation of Fc and Fab fragments and to determine the exact localization of N-glycans on Fc and Fab fragments.IgG1 Fc glycosylation of total IgG was significantly reduced in patients with active AAV compared to controls. Clinical remission was associated with complete glycan normalization for PR3-ANCA patients but not for MPO-ANCA patients. Fc-glycosylation of anti-MPO specific IgG was similar to total IgG purified from plasma. A major fraction of anti-MPO specific IgG harbor extensive glycosylation within the variable domain on the Fab portion.Significant differences exist between MPO and PR3-ANCA regarding the changes in amounts and types of glycans on Fc fragment and the association with disease activity. These differences may contribute to significant clinical difference in the disease course observed between the two diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2919532984,"The evolution of antibiotic resistance is far outpacing the development of new antibiotics, causing global public health concern about infections that will increasingly be unresponsive to antimicrobials. This risk of emerging antibiotic resistance may be meaningfully altered in highly AIDS-immunocompromised populations. Such populations fundamentally alter the bacterial evolutionary landscape in two ways, which we seek to model and analyze. First, widespread, population-level immunoincompetence creates a novel host environment with disrupted selective pressures. Second, within AIDS-prevalent populations, the recommendation that antibiotics be taken to treat and prevent opportunistic infection raises the risk of selection for drug-resistant pathogens.To determine the impact of HIV/AIDS on the emergence of antibiotic resistance-specifically in the developing world where high prevalence and economic challenges complicate disease management.We present an SEIR epidemiological model of bacterial infection, and parametrize it to capture HIV/AIDS-attributable emergence of resistance under conditions of both high and low HIV/AIDS prevalence.We demonstrate that HIV/AIDS-immunocompromised hosts can be responsible for a disproportionately greater contribution to emergence of resistance than would be expected based on population-wide HIV/AIDS prevalence alone.As such, the AIDS-immunocompromised have the potential become wellsprings of novel, resistant, opportunistic pathogen strains that can propagate into the broader global community. We discuss how public health policies for HIV/AIDS management can shape the evolutionary environment for opportunistic bacterial infections."
https://openalex.org/W2951116953,"The high affinity (KD ~ 10−15 M) of biotin for avidin and streptavidin is the essential component in a multitude of bioassays with many experiments using biotin modifications to invoke coupling. Equilibration times suggested for these assays assume that the association rate constant (kon) is approximately diffusion limited (109 M-1s-1) but recent single molecule and surface binding studies indicate that they are slower than expected (105 to 107 M-1s-1). In this study, we asked whether these reactions in solution are diffusion controlled, which reaction model and thermodynamic cycle describes the complex formation, and if there are any functional differences between avidin and streptavidin. We have studied the biotin association by two stopped-flow methodologies using labeled and unlabeled probes: I) fluorescent probes attached to biotin and biocytin; and II) unlabeled biotin and HABA, 2-(4’-hydroxyazobenzene)-benzoic acid. Both native avidin and streptavidin are homo-tetrameric and the association data show no cooperativity between the binding sites. The kon values of streptavidin are faster than avidin but slower than expected for a diffusion limited reaction in both complexes. Moreover, the Arrhenius plots of the kon values revealed strong temperature dependence with large activation energies (6–15 kcal/mol) that do not correspond to a diffusion limited process (3–4 kcal/mol). Accordingly, we propose a simple reaction model with a single transition state for non-immobilized reactants whose forward thermodynamic parameters complete the thermodynamic cycle, in agreement with previously reported studies. Our new understanding and description of the kinetics, thermodynamics, and spectroscopic parameters for these complexes will help to improve purification efficiencies, molecule detection, and drug screening assays or find new applications."

However, only a system which is accepted and utilised by the public would be sustainable in the long run. This study aimed to explore the perception and attitude of the Malaysian public towards a dengue early warning system. The sample consisted of 847 individuals who were 18 years and above and living/working in the Petaling District, an area adjacent to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. A questionnaire consisting of personal information and three sub-measures of; i) perception, ii) attitude towards dengue early warning and iii) response towards early warning; was distributed to participants. We found that most of the respondents know about dengue fever (97.1%) and its association with climate factors (90.6%). Most of them wanted to help reduce the number of dengue cases in their area (91.5%). A small percentage of the respondents admitted that they were not willing to be involved in public activities, and 64% of them admitted that they did not check dengue situations or hotspots around their area regularly. Despite the high awareness on the relationship between climate and dengue, about 45% of respondents do not know or are not sure how this can be used to predict dengue. Respondents would like to know more about how climate data can be used to predict a dengue outbreak (92.7%). Providing more information on how climate can influence dengue cases would increase public acceptability and improve response towards climate-based warning system. The most preferred way of communicating early warning was through the television (66.4%). This study shows that the public in Petaling District considers it necessary to have a dengue warning system to be necessary, but more education is required."

A total of 28 female NC/Nga mice were divided into 4 treatment groups. Controls were fed a normal commercial diet. In the experimental groups, colitis was induced by rectal administration of dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid. Two groups were orally administered 2 and 17 mg/kg EF-2001, respectively. EF-2001 treatment decreased the expression of several cytokines, including cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), interferon (IFN)-γ, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 in inflamed colon compared to the DNBS alone group. In addition, EF-2001 suppressed DNBS-induced colonic tissue destruction. Therefore, this study strongly suggests that EF-2001 could alleviate the inflammation associated with mouse IBD."
https://openalex.org/W2919163021,"Can the mere expectation of a sensory event being about to occur on an artificial limb be sufficient to elicit an illusory sense of ownership over said limb? This issue is currently under debate and studies using two different paradigms have presented conflicting results. Here, we employed the two relevant paradigms, namely, the magnetic touch illusion and the ""tactile expectation"" version of the rubber hand illusion, to clarify the role of tactile expectations in the process of attributing ownership to limbs. The illusory senses of ownership and 'magnetic touch' were quantified using questionnaires, threat-evoked skin conductance responses and a combination of motion tracking synchronized with real-time subjective ratings and skin conductance. The results showed that the magnetic touch illusion was dependent on concurrent visual and tactile stimulation and that visually induced tactile expectations alone were insufficient. Moreover, in this study, tactile expectations were not associated with the rubber hand illusion, neither in terms of subjective ratings nor skin conductance changes. Together, these findings contradict the notion that the brain uses predictions of upcoming sensory events to determine whether or not a limb belongs to the self, and, instead, emphasize the importance of correlated multisensory information."
https://openalex.org/W2952281065,"We proposed a method for segmentation of brain tissues—gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid—using multi-contrast images, including a T1 map and a uniform T1-weighted image, from a magnetization-prepared 2 rapid acquisition gradient echoes (MP2RAGE) sequence at 7 Tesla. The proposed method was evaluated with respect to the processing time and the similarity of the segmented masks of brain tissues with those obtained using FSL, FreeSurfer, and SPM12. The processing time of the proposed method (28 ± 0 s) was significantly shorter than those of FSL and SPM12 (444 ± 4 s and 159 ± 2 s for FSL and SPM12, respectively). In the similarity assessment, the tissue mask of the brain obtained by the proposed method showed higher consistency with those obtained using FSL than with those obtained using SPM12. The proposed method misclassified the subcortical structures and large vessels since it is based on the intensities of multi-contrast images obtained using MP2RAGE, which uses a similar segmentation approach as FSL but is not based on a template image or a parcellated brain atlas, which are used for FreeSurfer and SPM12, respectively. However, the proposed method showed good segmentation in the cerebellum and white matter in the medial part of the brain in comparison with the other methods. Thus, because the proposed method using different contrast images of MP2RAGE sequence showed the shortest processing time and similar segmentation ability as the other methods, it may be useful for both neuroimaging research and clinical diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2918425508,"To investigate whether multi-frequency measurement of vibration perception thresholds (VPTs) can identify individuals with a high risk of developing diabetic foot ulcer or neuropathic symptoms.VPTs were measured at six different frequencies (4, 8, 16, 32, 64 and 125 Hz) on metatarsal heads 1 and 5 on the sole of the foot using a standard VibroSense Meter device in 535 type 1 diabetic (T1DM) patients and 717 non-diabetic control subjects. VPTs in control subjects were used to establish normal values for five different age groups for male and female subjects respectively. Normal values were defined as a VPT below the mean plus 1.66 x standard deviation for each group. Various definitions of abnormal VPTs were tested using either all frequencies, only lowest VPT frequencies (4 and 8 Hz) or only highest VPT frequencies (64 and 125 Hz).The VPTs were higher in T1DM patients than in non-diabetic control subjects matched for age and gender. The low frequencies, 4 and 8 Hz, particularly were associated with the risk of diabetic foot ulcer (OR 40.7 [5.4-308.4], p = 0.0003) and with difficulties in balance and or gait (OR 1.89 [1.04-3.46], p = 0.04) difficulties and weakness (OR 2.77 [1.25-6.16], p = 0.01). The VPTs at the 125 Hz frequency were higher in short duration (≤ 10 yrs.) T1DM patients compared to age- and gender-matched control subjects.Vibration perception thresholds at low frequencies seem to be a better indicator of the risk of developing diabetic foot ulcers, gait or balance problems or weakness of the foot. The 125 Hz frequency, however, seemed to be impaired earlier and it was the only pathological VPT frequency in patients with short duration of diabetes.This study suggests that at least four different frequencies (4, 8, 64 and 125 Hz) should be included in any examination in order to obtain a complete evaluation of the risk factors for diabetic neuropathy and diabetic foot ulcers."
https://openalex.org/W2918605096,"Background and purpose In prostate cancer treatment with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), prostate motion and internal changes in tissue distribution can lead to a decrease in plan quality. In most currently used planning methods, the uncertainties due to prostate motion are compensated by irradiating a larger treatment volume. However, this could cause underdosage of the treatment volume and overdosage of the organs at risk (OARs). To reduce this problem, in this proof of principle study we developed and evaluated a novel adaptive planning method. The strategy proposed corrects the dose delivered by each beam according to the actual position of the target in order to produce a final dose distribution dosimetrically as similar as possible to the prescribed one. Material and methods Our adaptive planning method was tested on a phantom case and on a clinical case. For the first, a pilot study was performed on an in-silico pelvic phantom. A “library” of intensity modulated RT (IMRT) plans corresponding to possible positions of the prostate during a treatment fraction was generated at planning stage. Then a 3D random walk model was used to simulate possible displacements of the prostate during the treatment fraction. At treatment stage, at the end of each beam, based on the current position of the target, the beam from the library of plans, which could reproduce the best approximation of the prescribed dose distribution, was selected and delivered. In the clinical case, the same approach was used on two prostate cancer patients: for the first a tissue deformation was simulated in-silico and for the second a cone beam CT (CBCT) taken during the treatment was used to simulate an intra-fraction change. Then, dosimetric comparisons with the standard treatment plan and, for the second patient, also with an isocenter shift correction, were performed. Results For the phantom case, the plan generated using the adaptive planning method was able to meet all the dosimetric requirements and to correct for a misdosage of 13% of the dose prescription on the prostate. For the first clinical case, the standard planning method caused underdosage of the seminal vesicles, respectively by 5% and 4% of the prescribed dose, when the position changes for the target were correctly taken into account. The proposed adaptive planning method corrected any possible missed target coverage, reducing at the same time the dose on the OARs. For the second clinical case, both with the standard planning strategy and with the isocenter shift correction target coverage was significantly worsened (in particular uniformity) and some organs exceeded some toxicity objectives. While with our approach, the most uniform coverage for the target was produced and systematically the lowest toxicity values for the organs at risk were achieved. Conclusions In our proof of principle study, the adaptive planning method performed better than the standard planning and the isocenter shift methods for prostate EBRT. It improved the coverage of the treatment volumes and lowered the dose to the OARs. This planning method is particularly promising for hypofractionated IMRT treatments in which a higher precision and control on dose deposition are needed. Further studies will be performed to test more extensively the proposed adaptive planning method and to evaluate it at a full clinical level."
https://openalex.org/W2918729057,"c-Jun dimerization protein (JDP2) and Activating Transcription Factor 3 (ATF3) are closely related basic leucine zipper proteins. Transgenic mice with cardiac expression of either JDP2 or ATF3 showed maladaptive remodeling and cardiac dysfunction. Surprisingly, JDP2 knockout (KO) did not protect the heart following transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Instead, the JDP2 KO mice performed worse than their wild type (WT) counterparts. To test whether the maladaptive cardiac remodeling observed in the JDP2 KO mice is due to ATF3, ATF3 was removed in the context of JDP2 deficiency, referred as double KO mice (dKO). Mice were challenged by TAC, and followed by detailed physiological, pathological and molecular analyses. dKO mice displayed no apparent differences from WT mice under unstressed condition, except a moderate better performance in dKO male mice. Importantly, following TAC the dKO hearts showed low fibrosis levels, reduced inflammatory and hypertrophic gene expression and a significantly preserved cardiac function as compared with their WT counterparts in both genders. Consistent with these data, removing ATF3 resumed p38 activation in the JDP2 KO mice which correlates with the beneficial cardiac function. Collectively, mice with JDP2 and ATF3 double deficiency had reduced maladaptive cardiac remodeling and lower hypertrophy following TAC. As such, the worsening of the cardiac outcome found in the JDP2 KO mice is due to the elevated ATF3 expression. Simultaneous suppression of both ATF3 and JDP2 activity is highly beneficial for cardiac function in health and disease."

The aim of the current research was to describe and compare the movement profiles and energy cost of youth, sub-elite and elite senior Australian football match-play. Methods Fifty-seven Australian footballers playing in an elite senior 20, sub-elite senior 16 and elite youth competition 21 participated in this study. Distance, speed based indices and metabolic power measures recording via Global Positioning System (GPS) devices were compared across three competition tiers. Kicks and handballs were collected via a commercial statistics provider (Champion Data) and compared across the competition tiers. Results Youth players recorded less field time (elite: ES = 1.37/sub-elite: ES = 1.68), total distance (elite: ES = 1.64 /sub-elite: ES = 1.55) and high speed running (elite: ES = 0.90/sub-elite: ES = 0.26) compared to the elite and sub-elite players. The average energy cost of elite (ES = 2.19) and sub-elite (ES = 1.58) match-play was significantly higher that youth match-play. Conclusions A progressive increase regarding physical demands was evident across AF competition tiers. The findings suggest that sub-elite match-play can provide a viable pathway for youth players to develop physical capacity and technical skills before transitioning to elite senior match-play."

https://openalex.org/W2919166034,"Human listeners can focus on one speech stream out of several concurrent ones. The present study aimed to assess the whole-brain functional networks underlying a) the process of focusing attention on a single speech stream vs. dividing attention between two streams and 2) speech processing on different time-scales and depth. Two spoken narratives were presented simultaneously while listeners were instructed to a) track and memorize the contents of a speech stream and b) detect the presence of numerals or syntactic violations in the same (“focused attended condition”) or in the parallel stream (“divided attended condition”). Speech content tracking was found to be associated with stronger connectivity in lower frequency bands (delta band- 0,5–4 Hz), whereas the detection tasks were linked with networks operating in the faster alpha (8–10 Hz) and beta (13–30 Hz) bands. These results suggest that the oscillation frequencies of the dominant brain networks during speech processing may be related to the duration of the time window within which information is integrated. We also found that focusing attention on a single speaker compared to dividing attention between two concurrent speakers was predominantly associated with connections involving the frontal cortices in the delta (0.5–4 Hz), alpha (8–10 Hz), and beta bands (13–30 Hz), whereas dividing attention between two parallel speech streams was linked with stronger connectivity involving the parietal cortices in the delta and beta frequency bands. Overall, connections strengthened by focused attention may reflect control over information selection, whereas connections strengthened by divided attention may reflect the need for maintaining two streams in parallel and the related control processes necessary for performing the tasks."

We used light and electron microspcopy to study the morphology and the ultrastructure of the precibarial valve of the meadow spittlebug, Philaenus spumarius (Hemiptera, Aphrophoridae), in order to better understand the operative mechanism of this structure. The precibarial valve revealed to be a complex structure with a bell-like invagination in the middle of the precibarium (on the epipharynx). Unlike the current hypothesis, we propose that the valve opens by dilator muscles and closes through cuticular and fluid tensions, the latter leading to morphological changes to the plane of the valve based on sap flow. Moreover, the presence of a precibarial secretory structure is described for the first time for auchenorrhynchan insects. In light of these observations, functions are hypothesized and discussed for this secretory structure."
https://openalex.org/W2916363279,"We have previously identified NOD2 genotype and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) phenotype, as associated with shifts in the ileal microbiome (dysbiosis) in a patient cohort. Here we report an integrative analysis of an expanded number of Crohn's disease (CD) related genetic defects in innate immune function (NOD2, ATG16L1, IRGM, CARD9, XBP1, ORMDL3) and composition of the ileal microbiome by combining the initial patient cohort (Batch 1, 2005-2010, n = 165) with a second consecutive patient cohort (Batch 2, 2010-2012, n = 118). These combined patient cohorts were composed of three non-overlapping phenotypes: 1.) 106 ileal CD subjects undergoing initial ileocolic resection for diseased ileum, 2.) 88 IBD colitis subjects without ileal disease (predominantly ulcerative colitis but also Crohn's colitis and indeterminate colitis, and 3.) 89 non-IBD subjects. Significant differences (FDR < 0.05) in microbiota were observed between macroscopically disease unaffected and affected regions of resected ileum in ileal CD patients. Accordingly, analysis of the effects of genetic and clinical factors were restricted to disease unaffected regions of the ileum. Beta-diversity differed across the three disease categories by PERMANOVA (p < 0.001), whereas no significant differences in alpha diversity were noted. Using negative binomial models, we confirmed significant effects of IBD phenotype, C. difficile infection, and NOD2 genotype on ileal dysbiosis in the expanded analysis. The relative abundance of the Proteobacteria phylum was positively associated with ileal CD and colitis phenotypes, but negatively associated with NOD2R genotype. Additional associations with ORMDL3 and XBP1 were detected at the phylum/subphylum level. IBD medications, such as immunomodulators and anti-TNFα agents, may have a beneficial effect on reversing dysbiosis associated with the IBD phenotype. Exploratory analysis comparing microbial composition of the disease unaffected region of the resected ileum between 27 ileal CD patients who subsequently developed endoscopic recurrence within 6-12 months versus 34 patients who did not, suggested that microbial biomarkers in the resected specimen helped stratify patients with respect to risk of post-surgical recurrence."
https://openalex.org/W2918222618,"Amoebophrya is part of an enigmatic, diverse, and ubiquitous marine alveolate lineage known almost entirely from anonymous environmental sequencing. Two cultured Amoebophrya strains grown on core dinoflagellate hosts were used for transcriptome sequencing. BLASTx using different genetic codes suggests that Amoebophyra sp. ex Karlodinium veneficum uses the three typical stop codons (UAA, UAG, and UGA) to encode amino acids. When UAA and UAG are translated as glutamine about half of the alignments have better BLASTx scores, and when UGA is translated as tryptophan one fifth have better scores. However, the sole stop codon appears to be UGA based on conserved genes, suggesting contingent translation of UGA. Neither host sequences, nor sequences from the second strain, Amoebophrya sp. ex Akashiwo sanguinea had similar results in BLASTx searches. A genome survey of Amoebophyra sp. ex K. veneficum showed no evidence for transcript editing aside from mitochondrial transcripts. The dynein heavy chain (DHC) gene family was surveyed and of 14 transcripts only two did not use UAA, UAG, or UGA in a coding context. Overall the transcriptome displayed strong bias for A or U in third codon positions, while the tRNA genome survey showed bias against codons ending in U, particularly for amino acids with two codons ending in either C or U. Together these clues suggest contingent translation mechanisms in Amoebophyra sp. ex K. veneficum and a phylogenetically distinct instance of genetic code modification."
https://openalex.org/W2919015621,"The lifetime prevalence of shoulder pain is nearly 70% and is mostly attributable to subacromial disorders. A rotator cuff tear is the most severe form of subacromial disorders, and most occur in the supraspinatus. For clinical examination, shoulder ultrasound is recommended to detect supraspinatus tears. In this study, a computer-aided tear classification (CTC) system was developed to identify supraspinatus tears in ultrasound examinations and reduce inter-operator variability. The observed cases included 89 ultrasound images of supraspinatus tendinopathy and 102 of supraspinatus tear from 136 patients. For each case, intensity and texture features were extracted from the entire lesion and combined in a binary logistic regression classifier for lesion classification. The proposed CTC system achieved an accuracy rate of 92% (176/191) and an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (Az) of 0.9694. Based on its diagnostic performance, the CTC system has promise for clinical use."
https://openalex.org/W2920300521,"Population reduction or eradication of domestic or non-domestic species may be required to address their impacts on the environment, other species, or human interests. Firearms are often used to accomplish these practical management objectives, and there is increased concern that the methods used may compromise animal welfare. We document the accuracy and humaneness of gunshot placement to the brain and cervical vertebrae of Philippine deer (Rusa marianna) on Guam during depopulation activities as a model for meeting AVMA standards of euthanasia under field conditions (e.g., animal is not in hand). Deer were shot with a .223 caliber rifle from 10-125 m and approached immediately (<20 s) for assessment. A subset of adult deer was further evaluated for physiological responses including cessation of heart rate, respiration, ocular reflexes, and post-mortem spasms. All deer shot in the brain (n = 132) and upper cervical spine (C1-C3; n = 18) died immediately due to the destruction of the brain or spinal tissue. Shot placements were all within 1.9 cm of the point of aim (i.e., the center of the target region). The accuracy and immediate insensibility resulting from targeting of C1-C3 demonstrates that this is an alternative target site when animal positioning is not optimal for targeting the brain, or there is a need to preserve brain tissue (e.g., Chronic Wasting Disease testing). While targeting of C4 -C7 vertebrae (n = 6) was accurate and resulted in immediate incapacitation, the failure to produce immediate insensibility does not support the use of this shot placement when upper cervical or brain shot placement is an option. It is reasonable to achieve sufficient accuracy to target the brain or upper cervical vertebrae of deer under field conditions and meet standards of euthanasia while accomplishing management objectives."
https://openalex.org/W2918191744,"In a previous study, we reported that levels of two types of protein species-a type of ~55-kDa species and a type of ~15-kDa species-are elevated in the lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of cognitively intact elderly individuals who are at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). These species are immunoreactive to the monoclonal antibody 6E10, which is directed against amino acids 6-10 of amyloid-β (Aβ), and their levels correlate with levels of total tau and tau phosphorylated at Thr181. In this study, we investigated the molecular composition of these AD-related proteins using immunoprecipitation (IP)/Western blotting coupled with IP/mass spectrometry. We show that canonical Aβ1-40/42 peptides, together with amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) fragments located N-terminally of Aβ, are present in the ~55-kDa, 6E10-immunoreactive species. We demonstrate that APP fragments located N-terminally of Aβ, plus the N-terminal region of Aβ, are present in the ~15-kDa, 6E10-immunoreactive species. These findings add to the catalog of AD-related Aβ/APP species found in CSF and should motivate further study to determine whether these species may serve as biomarkers of disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2918355467,"Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers are used to study population structure and conservation genetics, which permits assessing similarities regarding the linkage disequilibrium and information about the relationship among individuals. To investigate the population genomic structure of 300 females and 25 males from a commercial maternal pig line we analyzed linkage disequilibrium extent, inbreeding coefficients using genomic and conventional pedigree data, and population stratification. The average linkage disequilibrium (r2) was 0.291 ± 0.312 for all adjacent SNPs, distancing less than 100 Kb (kilobase) between markers. The average inbreeding coefficients obtained from runs of homozygosity (ROH) and pedigree analyses were 0.119 and 0.0001, respectively. Low correlation was observed between the inbreeding coefficients possibly as a result of genetic recombination effect accounted for the ROH estimates or caused by pedigree identification errors. A large number of long ROHs might indicate recent inbreeding events in the studied population. A total of 36 homozygous segments were found in more than 30% of the population and these ROH harbor genes associated with reproductive traits. The population stratification analysis indicated that this population was possibly originated from two distinct populations, which is a result from crossings between the eastern and western breeds used in the formation of the line. Our findings provide support to understand the genetic structure of swine populations and may assist breeding companies to avoid a high level of inbreeding coefficients to maintain genetic diversity, showing the effectiveness of using genome-wide SNP information for quantifying inbreeding when the pedigree was incomplete or incorrect."
https://openalex.org/W2919058227,"Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive brain imaging technique that measures changes in oxygenated and de-oxygenated hemoglobin concentration and can provide a measure of brain activity. In addition to neural activity, fNIRS signals contain components that can be used to extract physiological information such as cardiac measures. Previous studies have shown changes in cardiac activity in response to different sounds. This study investigated whether cardiac responses collected using fNIRS differ for different loudness of sounds. fNIRS data were collected from 28 normal hearing participants. Cardiac response measures evoked by broadband, amplitude-modulated sounds were extracted for four sound intensities ranging from near-threshold to comfortably loud levels (15, 40, 65 and 90 dB Sound Pressure Level (SPL)). Following onset of the noise stimulus, heart rate initially decreased for sounds of 15 and 40 dB SPL, reaching a significantly lower rate at 15 dB SPL. For sounds at 65 and 90 dB SPL, increases in heart rate were seen. To quantify the timing of significant changes, inter-beat intervals were assessed. For sounds at 40 dB SPL, an immediate significant change in the first two inter-beat intervals following sound onset was found. At other levels, the most significant change appeared later (beats 3 to 5 following sound onset). In conclusion, changes in heart rate were associated with the level of sound with a clear difference in response to near-threshold sounds compared to comfortably loud sounds. These findings may be used alone or in conjunction with other measures such as fNIRS brain activity for evaluation of hearing ability."
https://openalex.org/W2919955694,"As the most severe form of tuberculosis (TB), TB meningitis (TBM) is still associated with high mortality even in developed countries. In certain areas of the United States (U.S.), more than 50% of the TBM patients die with TB or have neurological sequelae and complications despite the availability of advanced health care. This population-based analysis aimed to determine the risk factors and trends associated with TBM morbidity and mortality using state-wide surveillance data.De-identified surveillance data of all confirmed TB patients from the state of Texas between 01/2010 and 12/2017 reported to the National TB Surveillance System was analyzed. Spatial distribution of TBM cases was presented by Stata's Geographic Information Systems mapping. Univariate and multiple generalized linear modeling were used to identify risk factors associated with meningitis morbidity and mortality. Non-parametric testing was used to analyze morbidity and mortality trends.Among 10,103 TB patients reported in Texas between 2010 and 2017, 192 (1.9%) had TBM. During this 8-year period, the TBM proportion fluctuated between 1.5% and 2.7% with peaks in 2011 (2.7%) and 2016 (2.1%) and an overall non-significant trend (z = -1.32, p = 0.19). TBM had a higher mortality at diagnosis (8.9%), during treatment (14.1%) and overall (22.9%) compared to non-TBM (1.9%, 5.3%, and 7.2%, respectively, p<0.001). While mortality during treatment was unchanged over time in non-TBM patients (z = 0.5, p = 0.62), it consistently increased in TBM patients after 2013 (z = 3.09, p = 0.002). TBM patients had nearly five times the risk for overall death in multivariate analysis [aRR 4.91 (95% CI 3.71, 6.51), p<0.001]. TBM patients were younger, and more likely to present with miliary TB or HIV (+). Age ≥45 years, resident of a long-term care facility, IDU, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, abnormal chest radiography, positive AFB smear or culture and HIV (+) were independently associated with higher mortality.TBM remains challenging in Texas with significantly high mortality. Risk factors determined by multivariate modeling will inform health professionals and lay a foundation for the development of more effective strategies for TBM prevention and management."
https://openalex.org/W2920077026,"Cigarette smoke is well recognized to cause injury to the airways and the alveolar walls over time. This injury usually requires many years of exposure, suggesting that the lungs may rapidly develop responses that initially protect it from this repetitive injury. Our studies tested the hypotheses that smoke induces an inflammatory response and changes in mRNA profiles that are dependent on sex and the health status of the lung, and that the response of the lungs to smoke differs after 1 day compared to 5 days of exposure. Male and female wildtype (WT) and Scnn1b-transgenic (βENaC) mice, which have chronic bronchitis and emphysematous changes due to dehydrated mucus, were exposed to cigarette smoke or sham air conditions for 1 or 5 days. The inflammatory response and gene expression profiles were analyzed in lung tissue. Overall, the inflammatory response to cigarette smoke was mild, and changes in mediators were more numerous after 1 than 5 days. βENaC mice had more airspace leukocytes than WT mice, and smoke exposure resulted in additional significant alterations. Many genes and gene sets responded similarly at 1 and 5 days: genes involved in oxidative stress responses were upregulated while immune response genes were downregulated. However, certain genes and biological processes were regulated differently after 1 compared to 5 days. Extracellular matrix biology genes and gene sets were upregulated after 1 day but downregulated by 5 days of smoke compared to sham exposure. There was no difference in the transcriptional response to smoke between WT and βENaC mice or between male and female mice at either 1 or 5 days. Taken together, these studies suggest that the lungs rapidly alter gene expression after only one exposure to cigarette smoke, with few additional changes after four additional days of repeated exposure. These changes may contribute to preventing lung damage."
https://openalex.org/W2920396602,"Along with improvement in electroencephalogram (EEG)-measurement technology, limitations on the situations in which data can be recorded are gradually being overcome. EEG measurement in real environments has become increasingly important as a means to monitor brain activity in our daily lives, such as while playing consumer games in the living room. The present study measured brain EEG activity while two players engaged in a competitive consumer baseball game in conditions that closely resembled daily life. The recorded brain activity was thus likely related to natural mental reactions and cognitive function that occur in similar daily life activities. To measure the EEG from participants who freely moved while playing the game, we developed EEG devices that incorporated a wireless time synchronization system using Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) signals. These devices stamped the time obtained from the GPS signals onto each data sample, which was then used to synchronize the data that were recorded by different devices. When the batter in the game swung and missed, the error-related negativity component of the event-related EEG potential was strongly evoked in frontal electrodes of the participant controlling the batter. Furthermore, the error-related negativity was modulated according to who was winning and by how much. Thus, here we have demonstrated ""real-world"" brain activity using a competitive consumer game, which increases intrinsic participant motivation."
https://openalex.org/W2919918296,"Lysozyme is a type of enzymatic protein found in a wide range of organisms. Among the many applications of lysozyme, the antibacterial activity features caused by the hydrolysis of 1–4 glycosidic bonds between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine of gram-positive bacteria are beneficial in the food industry, medicine, trade, and pharmacology. Studies have indicated that specific modifications of lysozyme cause oligomerization of the enzyme, and the resulting dimer, which also undergoes changes in physicochemical properties, shows greater total antibacterial activity. Among these modifications, thermo-chemical methods are one of the most important groups. In this study, the microwave method of the enzyme heating with the associated process of enzyme oxidation was used as a novel thermo-chemical method to induce lysozyme oligomerization. The research shows that using this new method can produce enzymatic preparations composed of approximately 58.9% oligomers, including 33.5% dimer and 25.4% trimer under a hydrogen peroxide concentration of 4% and pH of 8. The maximum percentage of lysozyme dimer of 39.4% was obtained at pH 6.0 with the addition of 2% oxidant. In addition, as a result of the modification process, the hydrolytic activity and surface hydrophobicity of the enzyme were changed."
https://openalex.org/W2920404566,"This study examined factors related to the quality of life (QOL) of gay and bisexual men during emerging adulthood in Taiwan. The factors included traditional harassment (e.g., verbal ridicule, relational exclusion, physical aggression, and theft of belongings), cyber harassment, sex- and gender-related factors (e.g., sexual orientation, age at initial identification of sexual orientation, self-reported level of gender nonconformity, and perceived social acceptance toward homosexuality and bisexuality), and demographic characteristics. In total, 305 Taiwanese gay and bisexual men, aged 20–25 years, were recruited. Their QOL, traditional harassment, and cyber harassment data were collected using the World Health Organization Questionnaire on Quality of Life: Short Form, School Bullying Experience Questionnaire, and Cyberbullying Experiences Questionnaire, respectively. In total, 60.3%, 34.4%, 28.2%, and 29.5% of the participants reported experiencing traditional harassment, cyber harassment, traditional harassment across multiple contexts, and harassment in multiple forms, respectively. Both traditional and cyber harassment were significantly associated with lower QOL. Individuals who experienced traditional harassment across multiple contexts and harassment in multiple forms had lower QOL in nearly all domains than did individuals who had experienced traditional harassment in a single context and harassment of a single form. However, the QOL did not significantly differ between individuals who had experienced traditional harassment in a single context and nonvictims nor between individuals who had experienced harassment of a single form and nonvictims. Lower education level, older age at initial identification of sexual orientation, higher perception of gender nonconformity, and lower perceived social acceptance toward homosexuality and bisexuality were significantly associated with lower QOL. Clinical and public health professionals should consider these factors when developing programs to enhance the QOL of gay and bisexual men."
https://openalex.org/W2918669667,"In Klebsiella pneumoniae CG43S3, deletion of the response regulator gene rcsB reduced the capsular polysaccharide amount and survival on exposure to acid stress. A comparison of the pH 4.4-induced proteomes between CG43S3 and CG43S3ΔrcsB revealed numerous differentially expressed proteins and one of them, YfdX, which has recently been reported as a periplasmic protein, was absent in CG43S3ΔrcsB. Acid survival analysis was then conducted to determine its role in the acid stress response. Deletion of yfdX increased the sensitivity of K. pneumoniae CG43S3 to a pH of 2.5, and transforming the mutant with a plasmid carrying yfdX restored the acid resistance (AR) levels. In addition, the effect of yfdX deletion was cross-complemented by the expression of the periplasmic chaperone HdeA. Furthermore, the purified recombinant protein YfdX reduced the acid-induced protein aggregation, suggesting that YfdX as well as HdeA functions as a chaperone. The following promoter activity measurement revealed that rcsB deletion reduced the expression of yfdX after the bacteria were subjected to pH 4.4 adaptation. Western blot analysis also revealed that YfdX production was inhibited by rcsB deletion and only the plasmid expressing RcsB or the nonphosphorylated form of RcsB, RcsBD56A, could restore the YfdX production, and the RcsB-mediated complementation was no longer observed when the sensor kinase RcsD gene was deleted. In conclusion, this is the first study demonstrating that YfdX may be involved in the acid stress response as a periplasmic chaperone and that RcsB positively regulates the acid stress response partly through activation of yfdX expression. Moreover, the phosphorylation status of RcsB may affect the YfdX expression under acidic conditions."

Diabetes PPHs were identified using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Prevention Quality Indicators v6.0 logic. We used negative binomial-logit hurdle regression models to explore the adjusted relationships between diabetes PPHs and schizophrenia, bipolar, depression, anxiety, adjustment disorder, alcohol use disorder, and drug use disorder.A total of 4,521 diabetes PPHs were experienced by 3,246 of the persons in the sample. The 20.83% of persons with one or more behavioral health conditions experienced 43.62% (1,972/4,521; 95% CI 42.18%-45.07%) of all diabetes PPHs, and the 7.14% of persons with more than one diagnosed behavioral health condition experienced 24.77% (1,120/4,521; 95% CI 23.54%-26.05%) of all diabetes PPHs. After adjusting for sociodemographic and physical health covariates, patients with depression, schizophrenia, drug or alcohol use disorders, or multiple behavioral health conditions were at significantly increased risk of experiencing at least one diabetes PPH, while patients with depression, drug use disorder, or multiple behavioral health conditions were at significantly increased risk of experiencing recurring diabetes PPHs over time.A number of behavioral health conditions are associated with diabetes PPHs, which are often preventable with timely, high-quality outpatient care. The results of this study will enable clinicians, payers, and policy-makers to better focus outpatient care interventions and resources within the population of persons with diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2918582303,"Hydrocarbons released during the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill weathered due to exposure to oxygen, light, and microbes. During weathering, the hydrocarbons' reactivity and lability was altered, but it remained identifiable as ""petrocarbon"" due to its retention of the distinctive isotope signatures (14C and 13C) of petroleum. Relative to the initial estimates of the quantity of oil-residue deposited in Gulf sediments based on 2010-2011 data, the overall coverage and quantity of the fossil carbon on the seafloor has been attenuated. To analyze recovery of oil contaminated deep-sea sediments in the northern Gulf of Mexico we tracked the carbon isotopic composition (13C and 14C, radiocarbon) of bulk sedimentary organic carbon through time at 4 sites. Using ramped pyrolysis/oxidation, we determined the thermochemical stability of sediment organic matter at 5 sites, two of these in time series. There were clear differences between crude oil (which decomposed at a lower temperature during ramped oxidation), natural hydrocarbon seep sediment (decomposing at a higher temperature; Δ14C = -912‰) and our control site (decomposing at a moderate temperature; Δ14C = -189‰), in both the stability (ability to withstand ramped temperatures in oxic conditions) and carbon isotope signatures. We observed recovery toward our control site bulk Δ14C composition at sites further from the wellhead in ~4 years, whereas sites in closer proximity had longer recovery times. The thermographs also indicated temporal changes in the composition of contaminated sediment, with shifts towards higher temperature CO2 evolution over time at a site near the wellhead, and loss of higher temperature CO2 peaks at a more distant site."
https://openalex.org/W2920688413,"In China, the introduction of antiretroviral treatment has increased the number of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). New technologies, such as social media, might be useful for enhancing HIV surveillance, especially given the lack of Chinese research, which is related to stigma and discrimination. Thus, the relative anonymity of social media may make it useful for evaluating ""hard to reach"" PLWHA.This study used social media data to assess whether it reflected the prevalence of HIV and to explore PLWHA' needs and online habits.In 2017, the Baidu Tieba platform was searched to obtain 2,500 HIV-related postings and 2,500 tuberculosis-related postings as a comparative sample. Word clouds and coding schemes were used to analyze the contents and review the users' needs and online habits. Negative binomial regression was used to evaluate the relationships between word cloud geolocations and provincial numbers of men who have sex with men (MSM) PLWHA cases, after controlling for socioeconomic status.Word cloud geolocations were associated with reported MSM-PLWHA cases (p<0.001). Over one-third of the HIV-related posts were seeking advice, with 40.12% being related to medical topics, although these posts received the fewest replies. The number of HIV-related social support requests was approximately 3-fold higher than the number of posts providing social support, although relatively similar proportions of support requests and support provision were observed in the tuberculosis-related postings.Social media may help enhance HIV surveillance. Our findings also indicate that the Chinese government, non-government organizations, and healthcare professionals should offer more online support to PLWHA."

Additionally, the plasmid recombination enzyme gene (pre), which may be involved in inter-plasmid recombination and conjugation, was found. Each gene exhibited >94% sequence identity with those harbored in other Staphylococcus species. pSSTET1 was conditionally transferred to Staphylococcus species in a host-dependent manner and transferred to an Enterococcus faecalis strain in vitro. Antibiotic susceptibility of the transconjugants was host-dependent and transconjugants maintained a tetracycline-resistant phenotype in the absence of selective pressure over 100 generations."
https://openalex.org/W2919812631,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are associated with altered neuronal regulation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and release of norepinephrine (NE). As sympathetic innervation of the GI tract modulates motility, blood flow, and immune function, changes in NE signaling may alter the risk of developing IBD. Dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DβH), the enzyme responsible for NE production, has been suggested to play a critical role in IBD, however the exact mechanism is unknown. We hypothesized that genetic variants of DβH could increase the risk of IBD. We performed genetic analysis on 45 IBD patients and 74 controls. IBD patients were screened by targeted exome sequencing and compared with NeuroX DβH single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping data of the controls. Serum DβH protein levels for 15 IBD patients and 13 controls were evaluated using immunoblots and competitive ELISA. Seven SNPs were observed from DβH targeted exome sequencing in the 45 IBD patients. A single non-synonymous SNP, rs6271 (Arg549Cys), had a significant association with IBD patients; the odds ratio was a 5.6 times higher SNP frequency in IBD patients compared to controls (p = 0.002). We also examined the function and availability of the protein in both the IBD and control patients’ sera bearing DβH Arg549Cys. Both control and IBD subjects bearing the heterozygote allele had statistically lower DβH protein levels while the intrinsic enzyme activity was higher. This is the first report of a noradrenergic genetic polymorphism (rs6271; Arg549Cys) associated with IBD. This polymorphism is associated with significantly lower levels of circulating DβH."
https://openalex.org/W2915330140,"Some clinicians keep patients in stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) without hemodialysis for a while. This study investigated whether previously-initiated hemodialysis in stage 5 CKD patients may become a prognostic factor for in-hospital mortality due to pneumonia.Patient data were obtained from the multi-institutional diagnosis procedure combination database between April 1, 2012 and March 31, 2016. The patients had records of pneumonia as both trigger and major diagnoses and records of end stage renal disease (ESRD) or stage 5 CKD as a comorbidity or other diagnoses on admission and aged 18 years or older. The following factors were adjusted: age, sex, body mass index, Barthel index, orientation disturbance, arterial oxygen saturation, systolic blood pressure, C-reactive protein level or the extent of consolidation on chest radiography, ambulance use, hospitalization within 90 days, and comorbidities upon admission. The primary outcome measure was all-cause in-hospital mortality obtained via multivariable logistic regression analysis using four Models. Model 1 involved complete case analysis with overlapping; one hospitalization per patient was counted as one. Model 2 involved a complete case analysis without overlapping; only the first hospitalization per patient was counted. Model 3 involved multilevel analysis clustered by hospital codes. Model 4 was created after multiple imputation for lacking adjusted factors.A total of 907 hospitals and 7,726 patients were identified. Hemodialysis was significantly associated with lower in-hospital mortality in all models (odds ratio [OR] = 0.68, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.54-0.87 in Model 1; OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.55-0.91 in Model 2; OR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.52-0.86 in Model 3; and OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.54-0.87 in Model 4).Previously-initiated hemodialysis may be an independent prognostic factor for in-hospital mortality in pneumonia patients with end-stage renal disease. This should be borne in mind when considering the time of initiation of dialysis."
https://openalex.org/W2918881096,"We studied previously optimal shape of external shading of windows in a cellular office with an outer edge modeled by a non-uniform rational basis spline (NURBS) curve whose control points were placed uniformly around western fin, overhang and eastern fin of the window, and whose depths were allowed to vary independently. We observed there that for each climate considered in the study there exists a shading shape close to the optimal one, but with a substantially simpler structure of control points for the NURBS curve. This simpler structure was reflected in partitioning control points into six groups such that all control points in the same group have equal depths, with groups corresponding to lower part of the western fin, upper part of the western fin, joint of the western fin and the overhang, internal part of the overhang, joint of the overhang and the eastern fin and the remaining part of the eastern fin. Here we confirm that shadings with control point structure restricted in such way can perform as well as shadings with unrestricted control points by optimising shape of external shading of windows in an apartment room for both restricted and unrestricted control point structure for the same range of climates, and showing that differences in heating and cooling demands between Pareto optimal shadings in both cases are negligibly small. This grouping of control points thus gives a simple and natural division of shading into a small number of basic constituents that have most impact on its heating and cooling demands. We further consider the convex hull of the Pareto front for shadings with restricted control points, as it contains shadings that minimise equivalent source energy in terms of the ratio of efficiencies and source energy conversion factors for district heating and cooling. We show that, in cases when depths of control point groups in convex hull shadings do not experience sudden changes between their extremal values, these depths can be fitted reasonably well by a sigmoid function that results in functional shadings that satisfactorily approximate heating and cooling demands of shadings in the Pareto front."
https://openalex.org/W2920543743,"This study was conducted to investigate tumor shrinkage and influencing factors in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from radiofrequency (RF) ablation following transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE).A total of 222 patients underwent combined sequential treatment of TACE and RF ablation for HCC at our institution between 2008 and 2014. Of those, 86 patients (men, 68; women, 18) who achieved compact iodized oil tagging and complete ablation were included for this retrospective study. We measured three-dimensional tumor diameters and calculated tumor volumes on pre-treatment CT/MRI and follow-up CT scans performed post-TACE, post-ablation, and 1 month post-treatment, respectively. To compare periodically generated tumor diameters and volumes, repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify factors impacting tumor shrinkage after RF ablation.Diameters and volumes of HCCs declined significantly in the immediate aftermath of RF ablation (i.e., between post-TACE and post-ablation CT scans) (p < 0.001, for both). Mean reduction rates in tumor diameter and volume immediately after RF ablation were 18.2 ± 9.1% and 44.4 ± 14.6%, respectively. Of note, tumors of left hepatic lobe and in subphrenic or perivascular locations showed lower rates of post-ablative volume reduction than those in counterpart locations (p = 0.002, 0.046, 0.024, respectively). Tumor size and liver function did not influence tumor shrinkage after RF ablation.In patients with HCC, significant tumor shrinkage occurs immediately after RF ablation. The degree of shrinkage in response to ablative treatment seems to vary by tumor location."
https://openalex.org/W2920723495,"Theory of Mind (ToM) is often impaired in early and chronic phases of psychosis and it is often suggested that poor ToM is a trait vulnerability for psychosis. The aim of this study was to examine in an adolescent sample whether childhood ToM abilities can predict psychotic experiences over a period of six years and whether this is mediated by social functioning. To examine whether ToM is a specific predictor for psychosis, symptoms of depression and anxiety were also examined.A baseline case-control sample (T0: age 7-8 years) with and without auditory vocal hallucinations (AVH) in the general population was assessed after five years (T1: age 12-13 years) on ToM ability (ToM Storybook Frank), and after eleven years (T2: age 18-19 years) on psychotic experiences (Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences; CAPE), depressive and anxiety symptoms (Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale; DASS-21), and social functioning (Groningen Questionnaire on Social Behaviour; GSVG-45). Analyses were conducted on a subsample of 157 adolescents aged 18-19 years (T2) who had data available on ToM ability at T1.ToM at T1 was not predictive of psychotic experiences after six years (from age 12-13 to age 18-19) and social functioning was also not a mediator. ToM was not associated with psychopathology in general (depressive and anxiety symptoms) over six years (from age 12-13 to age 18-19).The current study found no evidence for a longitudinal association between ToM ability and psychotic experiences, social functioning, and symptoms of depression and anxiety, in adolescence."
https://openalex.org/W2916229822,"Fatty acyl composition of cell membrane lipids, particularly the abundance of highly unsaturated docosahexaenoic fatty acid (22:6n-3, DHA), is likely to be an important predictor of basal metabolic rate (BMR). Our study was performed using two lines of laboratory mice divergently selected for either high or low BMR. We describe a novel single nucleotide polymorphism in the Fads2 gene encoding Δ6-desaturase, a key enzyme in the metabolic pathways of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). The allele frequencies of Fads2 were significantly different in both lines of mice. The analysis of genetic distances revealed that the genetic differentiation between the two studied lines developed significantly faster at the Fads2 locus than it did at neutral loci. Such a pattern suggests that the Fads2 polymorphism is related to the variation in BMR, i.e. the direct target of selection. The Fads2 polymorphism significantly affected abundance of several PUFAs; however, the differences in PUFA composition between lines were compatible with the difference in frequency of Fads2 alleles only for DHA. We hypothesize that the polymorphism in the Fads2 gene affects the BMR through modification of DHA abundance in cell membranes. This may be the first example of a significant link between a polymorphism in a gene responsible for fatty acyl composition and variation in BMR."

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between echocardiographic parameters and blood biomarkers in PR interval groups and AF.The LIFE-Adult-Study is a population-based cohort study of randomly selected participants from Leipzig, Germany. In this cross-sectional analysis, individuals ≥40 years with available echocardiographic (LA diameter, EF) and laboratory data (creatinine, Troponin, NT-proBNP) were included.The study population comprised 1.429 individuals (median age 56 (IQR 48-66) years, 40% males) with complete ECG, echocardiographic and laboratory data. There were 48 (3.4%) individuals with AF, 177 (12.4%) with short, 138 (9.7%) with prolonged and 1.066 (74.5%) with normal PR interval. Individuals with PR interval prolongation had larger LA diameter, higher Troponin and NT-proBNP levels than individuals with normal PR interval, but lower than AF group (p<0.001). In contrast, eGFR was significantly higher in the group with PR interval prolongation than in AF, but lower than in individuals with normal PR interval (p<0.001). In the multivariate analysis, PR interval prolongation and AF shared similar characteristics, the only parameter different between both groups was NT-proBNP.Individuals with PR interval prolongation and AF showed similarities in echocardiographic parameters, renal function and blood biomarker levels. Longitudinal studies are necessary to prove whether the PR interval prolongation may be considered as preliminary stage for AF."
https://openalex.org/W2919072855,"In this study, bamboo fiber was pretreated with calcium chloride (CaCl2) solution by using an ultrasonic method, and then heat-treated at 250°C and carbonized at 1000°C. The effect of impregnation with CaCl2 on the thermal and chemical properties and morphology of bamboo fiber was determined using thermogravimetric and differential thermogravimetric analyses, in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The pore structure of the carbonized bamboo fiber was investigated. The results revealed that bamboo fiber pretreated with 5% CaCl2 (BFCa5) showed a downward shift in the temperature of the maximum rate of weight loss253°C and increase in char residue to 31.89%. BFCa5 was expected to undergo dehydration under the combined effect of oxygen-rich atmosphere and CaCl2 catalysis from 210°C, and cellulose decomposition would be remarkable at 250°C. Pretreatment with 5% CaCl2 promoted the formation of porous structure of the carbonized fiber, which exhibited a typical Type-IV isotherm, with the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller specific surface area of 331.32 m2/g and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda adsorption average pore diameter of 13.6440 nm. Thus, CaCl2 was found to be an effective catalyst for the pyrolysis of bamboo fiber, facilitating the formation of porous carbonized fiber."
https://openalex.org/W2920341885,"Uterine serous papillary carcinoma (UPSC) is an aggressive tumor, often diagnosed as a metastatic disease and characterized by a high recurrence rate and poor prognosis. UPSC represents a distinct subtype of endometrial cancer which is different in clinical and pathological behaviors from endometrioid endometrial carcinoma (EEC) and resembles more to serous ovarian carcinoma. Since tumors of serous papillary of the ovary are hypothesized to stem from cells of the fallopian tube's fimbria, we hypothesized that UPSC may also origin in the fallopian tubes. In our previous study, using a novel method of computerized morphometry of the fimbrial epithelium we have found significant differences between fimbriae of healthy women and serous ovarian cancer patients. In this study we showed the presence of morphologic differences between twenty-four fimbriae from healthy women, and twenty six fimbriae from uterus cancer (13 from UPSC patients and 13 from EEC patients). All fimbriae reported by the pathologist as ""normal"" were subjected to a computerized histomorphometric analysis. Two-step method of computerized histomorphometry, i.e. Fast Fourier transformation (FFT) followed by a co-occurrence matrix analysis and an additional analysis of the nuclear symmetry of the tubal fimbrial epithelium were applied. Using these novel methods, we were able to show differences in the morphometric characteristics of the fimbriae in UPSC patients compared to EEC and healthy patients. It is yet to be determined the clinical significance of this observation."
https://openalex.org/W2918414722,"The Erbil psychiatric hospital is the major governmental psychiatric facility in the governorate of Erbil, the capital of the Kurdistan region in Iraq, providing services for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of patients from the city and its surrounding areas. The child and adolescent outpatient clinic in the hospital is for patients younger than 18 years. The objectives of this study were to explore the sociodemographic, pregnancy and birth characteristics, as well as the clinical profiles, of patients who presented to the child and adolescent psychiatric outpatient clinic to statistically estimate the frequency of various psychiatric disorders among the attendees and to test hypotheses of the association of these psychiatric disorders with sociodemographic and birth and pregnancy characteristics as reported by many previous studies but with inconsistent results.A descriptive consecutive cross-sectional study was conducted from October 2017 to February 2018 in the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Outpatient Clinic in Erbil province of Iraq's Kurdistan region. The diagnostic criteria of the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition) were implemented. Chi-square tests were used to test the hypothesized associations.Of a total of 207 patients, 142 were males and 65 were females, and most lived in low socioeconomic status. Most of the patients' fathers were school educated, and most mothers were illiterate. Consanguinity was found in 41% of the parents, 26.6% of the patients were born by caesarean section(C/S), 62.8% were nurtured exclusively by breastfeeding in their first six months after birth, 42.5% of them visited faith healers before consulting a psychiatrist, 43% had neurodevelopmental disorders, 26.6% had intellectual disabilities with behavioral and emotional comorbidities and 30.4% had other mental/behavioral disorders.This study revealed that the child and adolescent psychiatric disorders in Erbil city are versatile and that many factors are significantly associated with them. Cultural concepts are still influential in the region in a way that can interfere with children's well-being, a situation that calls for more concern and attention."
https://openalex.org/W2919986267,"Background The association between X4 virus and an increased risk of non-AIDS-events has been reported. Morbidity/mortality due to non-AIDS events, which are properly predicted by the CD4/CD8 ratio and VACS index, have become particularly remarkable in HIV-infected patients receiving effective combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). Methods We verified the validity of the syllogism: as HIV-tropism (CRT) contributes to the onset of non-AIDS events which are successfully predicted by the CD4/CD8 ratio and VACS index, then CRT correlates with these two variables. The CD4/CD8 ratio and VACS index at baseline and overtime were analyzed according to CRT tested before the first successful cART regimen in newly-diagnosed patients. Results Patients with R5 variants had a significantly lower baseline VACS percentage risk [mean (95%CI):18.2%(16.1–20.3) vs 24.3%(18.2–22.5), p = 0.002] and higher baseline CD4/CD8 ratio [mean (95%CI):0.43 (0.38–0.47) vs 0.28 (0.19–0.36), p = 0.002] than non-R5 patients. After an initial drop, VACS increased again in R5 and non-R5 patients and the two trend curves almost overlapped. The CD4/CD8 ratio had an increasing trend in both R5 and non-R5 patients; however, even though non-R5 patients had a greater gain of CD4+, they maintained a lower CD4/CD8 ratio at any time point. Conclusion Our study confirms an association between pre-therapy CRT, CD4/CD8 ratio and VACS. A successful cART regimen positively affects the CD4/CD8 ratio; however, the disadvantage conferred by a non-R5 CRT is maintained overtime. The restoration of VACS in all patients could be directly due to variables included in the VACS calculation and to factors that adversely influence these variables."
