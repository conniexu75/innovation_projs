https://openalex.org/W2095435531,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) and other neurotrophins support survival of neurons through processes that are incompletely understood. The transcription factor CREB is a critical mediator of NGF-dependent gene expression, but whether CREB family transcription factors regulate expression of genes that contribute to NGF-dependent survival of sympathetic neurons is unknown. CREB-mediated gene expression was both necessary for NGF-dependent survival and sufficient on its own to promote survival of sympathetic neurons. Moreover, expression of Bcl-2 was activated by NGF and other neurotrophins by a CREB-dependent transcriptional mechanism. Overexpression of Bcl-2 reduced the death-promoting effects of CREB inhibition. Together, these data support a model in which neurotrophins promote survival of neurons, in part through a mechanism involving CREB family transcription factor–dependent expression of genes encoding prosurvival factors."

The neurotoxicity of Aβ in cell culture has been linked to H2O2generation by an unknown mechanism. We now report that Cu(II) markedly potentiates the neurotoxicity exhibited by Aβ in cell culture. The potentiation of toxicity is greatest for Aβ1–42 > Aβ1–40 ≫ mouse/rat Aβ1–40, corresponding to their relative capacities to reduce Cu(II) to Cu(I), form H2O2 in cell-free assays and to exhibit amyloid pathology. The copper complex of Aβ1–42 has a highly positive formal reduction potential (≈+500–550 mV versus Ag/AgCl) characteristic of strongly reducing cuproproteins. These findings suggest that certain redox active metal ions may be important in exacerbating and perhaps facilitating Aβ-mediated oxidative damage in Alzheimer's disease.

The possibility that Aβ accumulation causes oxidation, perhaps by radical formation (3Hensley K. Carney J.M. Mattson M.P. Aksenova M. Harris M. Wu J.F. Floyd R.A. Butterfield D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3270-3274Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar), has been explored, but the nature of the chemistry involved in generating Aβ-associated oxidation products such as lipid peroxides (4Mark R.J. Lovell M.A. Markesbery W.R. Uchida K. Mattson M.P. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar) remains to be elaborated. In culture, Aβ-induced neurotoxicity is characterized by elevated cellular H2O2 and is combated by antioxidants such as vitamin E and catalase (5Behl C. Davis J.B. Lesley R. Schubert D. Cell. 1994; 77: 817-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2052) Google Scholar). The origin of the toxic H2O2 is unknown. Recently, we reported that Fe(III) interacts directly with Aβ1–42 and Aβ1–40 to produce H2O2 and TBARS formation in a cell-free manner in vitro, through reduction of the metal ion (6Huang X. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Multhaup G. Goldstein L.E. Scarpa R.C. Cuajungco M.P. Gray D.N. Lim J. Moir R.D. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7609-7616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar), suggesting that a source of the H2O2 that mediates toxicity in cell cultures exposed to Aβ is extracellular. Cu(II)and Fe(III) have been found in abnormally high concentrations in amyloid plaques (≈0.4 and ≈1 mm, respectively) and AD-affected neuropil (7Lovell M.A. Robertson J.D. Teesdale W.J. Campbell J.L. Markesbery W.R. J. Neurol. Sci. 1998; 158: 47-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1828) Google Scholar), and copper-selective chelators have been shown to dissolve Aβ deposits extracted from AD post-mortem brain specimens (8Cherny R.A. Legg J.T. McLean C.A. Fairlie D. Huang X. Atwood C.S. Beyreuther K. Tanzi R.E. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. J. Biol.

Importantly, we have also reported that the generation of both Cu(II) and Fe(III)-mediated TBARS is greatest for Aβ1–42 > Aβ1–40 ≫ rat Aβ1–40 (6Huang X. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Multhaup G.

This rank order is of interest because it mirrors the relative participation of the peptides in amyloid neuropathology, and because the most active one (Aβ1–42) is overproduced in familial AD (9Scheuner D. Eckman C. Jensen M. Song X. Citron M. Suzuki N. Bird T.D. Hardy J. Hutton M. Kukull W. Larson E. Levy-Lahad E. Viitanen M. Peskind E. Poorkaj P. Schellenberg G. Tanzi R. Wasco W. Lannfelt L.

Nature. 1996; 383: 710-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar), probably due to the three amino acid substitutions in their homologue of Aβ (Arg5 → Gly, Tyr10 → Phe, and His13 → Arg) (12Shivers B.D. Hilbich C. Multhaup G. Salbaum M. Beyreuther K. Seeburg P.H. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1365-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Although Fe(III) mediates and potentiates Aβ1–40 toxicity in cell culture (13Schubert D. Chevion M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 702-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), it is not clear whether this is due to metal interaction with the peptide or due to a nonspecific increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation within the cell. Redox active metal ions, such as Cu(II) and Fe(III), play an obligatory role in generating ROS, and in mediating ROS-induced damage (e.g. the Fenton reaction) (14Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (4577) Google Scholar, 15Stadtman E.R. Oliver C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2005-2008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the Cu(II) and Fe(III) enhancement of dichlorofluorescein (DCF)-reactive oxygen species generated by Aβ25–35 treatment of post-mitochondrial rat cerebrocortex (16Bondy S.C. Guo-Ross S.X. Truong A.T. Brain Res. 1998; 799: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) could be due to catalytically enhanced ROS generation within the tissue, rather than due to metal interaction with the peptide. Cu(II) causes the peptide to aggregate to a greater extent than Fe(III) (Aβ1–42 > Aβ1–40 > rat Aβ1–40) (17Atwood C.S. Moir R.D. Huang X. Bacarra N.M.E. Scarpa R.C. Romano D.M. Hartshorn M.A. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12817-12826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar), a property that may be related to the relative affinities of the metal ions for Aβ. We hypothesize that if such redox active metal ions bind to Aβ peptides with high affinity and become more oxidizing, they may potentiate Aβ-induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, if the redox competence of Aβ is responsible for its neurotoxicity, then toxicity should be greatest for Aβ1–42 > Aβ1–40 > rat Aβ1–40. Aβ1–42 has been reported to be more neurotoxic than Aβ1–40 (18Doré S. Kar S. Quirion R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4772-4777Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), but a comparison of the neurotoxicity of these three peptides, or the effects of Cu(II) upon the potentiation of their respective toxicities in culture, has not yet been reported to our knowledge. Here we report that, in the presence of Cu(II), Aβ is indeed redox-competent (Aβ1–42 > Aβ1–40 ≫ rat Aβ1–40), and that a series of electron transfer reactions occur when Cu(II) binds to Aβ, including reduction to Cu(I) and consequent O2-dependent, cell-free peroxide formation. These changes correlate with a striking potentiation in the neurotoxicities of the respective Aβ species in cell culture, supporting an extracellular origin for the H2O2that mediates Aβ-induced toxicity. These data suggest that formation of an Aβ-copper complex may be a pathophysiological interaction, and a new target for therapeutic interdiction in AD. Aβ peptides 1–40 and 1–42 were synthesized by the W. Keck Laboratory, Yale University, New Haven, CT. Confirmatory data were obtained by reproducing experiments with Aβ peptides synthesized and obtained from other sources: Glabe Laboratory, University of California, Irvine, CA; Multhaup Laboratory, University of Heidelberg; U.S. Peptides, Bachem (Torrance, CA); and Sigma. Rat Aβ1–40 was synthesized and purified by the Multhaup Laboratory. For the EPR experiments, Aβ1–40 was synthesized at the University of Queensland. Aβ1–28 and Aβ25–35 were purchased from U.S. Peptides, Bachem, and Sigma. Aβ40–1 was purchased from Bachem, and also synthesized by the Multhaup Laboratory (giving corroborating results). Aβ peptide stock solutions were prepared in water treated with Chelex-100 resin (Bio-Rad) and quantified, according to established procedures (17Atwood C.S. Moir R.D. Huang X. Bacarra N.M.E. Scarpa R.C. Romano D.M. Hartshorn M.A. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12817-12826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). Cu(II)-Gly stock solutions were used to prevent metal-hydroxy and metal-oxy polymers that form in neutral metal ion solutions and were prepared by mixing National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standard copper with glycine at metal/ligand molar ratio of 1:6. Other reagents are from Sigma, unless otherwise mentioned. Assays were performed using a 96-well microtiter plate (Costar), based upon a modification of established protocols (19Landers J.W. Zak B. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1958; 29: 590-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Polypeptides (10 μm) or vitamin C (10 μm), Cu(II)-glycine and Cu(I) indicator (250 μm), either bathocuproine disulfonic acid (BC) or bicinchoninic acid (BCA, 4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-biquinoline), were coincubated in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 1.19 mm CaCl2, 0.6 mm MgCl2, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.4 mmKH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, 7.68 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4), at 37 °C. Absorbances were then measured using a plate reader (SPECTRAmax Plus, Molecular Devices). In control samples, both metal ion and indicator were present to determine the background buffer signal. Absorbance of metal ion and peptide present in the absence of indicator were taken to estimate the contribution of light scattering due to turbidity. The net absorbances (A) were obtained by deducting the absorbances from these controls from the absorbances generated by the peptide and metal in the presence of the indicator. Cu(I) concentrations (μm) were calculated as A × 106/M, where M is the known molar absorption coefficient (m−1cm−1). For Cu(I)-BC, M = 12,250 at 483 nm; and for Cu(I)-BCA, M = 7700 at 562 nm. Cyclic voltammograms were obtained at room temperature (22 ± 2 °C) on air-equilibrated solutions using an EG&G PARC potentiostat, model 263A. The electrochemical cell incorporated an indium/tin oxide working electrode (Donnelly Corp.) of 0.32-cm2 area, a platinum auxiliary electrode, and a Ag/AgCl (1 m KCl) reference electrode. Indium/tin oxide electrodes were pretreated by successive 30 min sonications in Alconox solution (8 g/liter), 95% ethanol, Milli-Q water, and PBS, pH 7.3, followed by overnight equilibration in PBS. The peptide solution was prepared by first dissolving Aβ1–42 with sonication in double-distilled water to 300 μm, after which the peptide solution was added to Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline without calcium or magnesium (Sigma) to a final concentration of 100 μm. Background voltammograms were first acquired in buffer on each new electrode used, followed by examination of Aβ1–42 (100 μm) in buffer, CuCl2 (17 μm) in buffer, and Aβ1–42 (100 μm) with added CuCl2 (17 μm) in buffer. The possibility that the formal potentials measured were for surface-adsorbed complexes cannot be excluded, and, in fact, the wave shapes (Fig. 3, lines c and d) are suggestive of involvement by adsorbed species. Further investigation is planned to resolve this issue. Aβ1–40 (0.42 mg) was dissolved in 300 μl of PBS buffer (20 mmNa2HPO4, 20 mmNaH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) to which CuCl2 (as indicated) was later added. Q-, X-, and S- band EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ESP300E EPR spectrometer; the magnetic field and microwave frequency were calibrated with a Bruker ER-035M gaussmeter and an EIP 548B microwave frequency counter. Quantitation of the Cu(II)-Aβ1–40 EPR resonance was performed by a comparison method (20Pilbrow J.R. Hanson G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 227: 330-353Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) using an X-band dual TE104rectangular cavity with TEMPO as reference sample. The individual cavities have different modulation amplitudes, which can be calibrated, and different microwave magnetic strengths (B1), which was overcome by measuring standard and reference samples in each cavity. The doubly integrated areas are proportional to the spin concentration and were normalized for the anisotropic probability <g 12> and instrument settings. The relative areas can then be used to calculate the concentration of Cu(II)-peptide that produces the residual spectrum. The anisotropic spectra of the Cu(II)-AB1–40 complexes were measured at 130 K using a flow-through cryostat. Spin Hamiltonian parameters were extracted from the spectra with the XSophe/Sophe computer simulation software suite (21Wang D.M. Hanson G.R. J. Magn. Reson. A. 1995; 117: 1-8Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Buffers were demetallated with Chelex 100 resin. Rat embryonic day 17 forebrain neuronal cultures were grown at 95% O2, 5% CO2, 85% humidity for 4 days in serum-free NeurobasalTM medium with B-27 supplement (Life Technologies, Inc.), 20 μml-glutamate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 g/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. On the fifth day (treatment day), the medium was replaced with serum-free NeurobasalTM plus l-glutamine without B-27 supplement (vehicle medium). Stock solutions were mixed in vehicle medium to a final concentration of peptide or copper-glycine. Experimental trials were done in triplicate wells. Viable cells were counted manually using a 1-mm2 grid (10× objective) stained with either calcein-AM (Live/DeadTM assay, Molecular Probes) or trypan blue. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance followed by post-hocStudent-Newman-Keuls method and/or Student's t test. Significance level was set at p < 0.05. The colorimetric H2O2 assay was performed in a 96-well microtiter plate (SpectraMax Plus, Molecular Devices), according to a modification of an existing protocol (22Han J. Yen S. Han G. Han P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 234: 107-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Polypeptides (10 μm) or vitamin C (10 μm), Cu(II) (1 μm), and a H2O2 scavenging agent, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (Pierce, 50 μm), were co-incubated in PBS buffer (300 μl), pH 7.4, for 1 h at 37 °C. Following incubation, the unreacted tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride was detected by 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Sigma, 50 μm). The amount of H2O2 produced was quantified based on the formula: H2O2 (μm) =A × 106/(2 × L ×M), where A is the absolute absorbance difference between a sample and catalase-only (Sigma, 100 units/ml) control at 412 nm; L = the vertical pathlength, corrected automatically by the plate reader to 1 cm; M is the molecular absorbance for 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate (14,150m−1 cm−1 at 412 nm). For the DCF assay, 5 mm of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (Molecular Probes) in 100% ethanol was de-acetylated by 0.01m NaOH for 0.5 h, 200 units/ml horseradish peroxidase was then added, and the DCF solution was neutralized and diluted to 200 μm by PBS before use. Then 20 μm DCF, 10 μm Aβ1–42, and 1 μm Cu(II)-glycine were co-incubated at 37 °C for 20 min in PBS. Catalase (1000 units/ml) with or without heat inactivation (100 °C for 30 min) was used to validate the signal. The fluorescent readings were recorded by a Packard 96-well fluorocounter (485 nm excitation; 530 nm emission). Where the O2 tension of the buffers were manipulated, the buffer vehicle was continuously bubbled for 2 h at 20 °C with 100% O2 to create conditions of increased O2tension, or purged with argon (Ar) to create anerobic conditions, prior to the addition of vitamin C or polypeptide. To establish whether Aβ reduces Cu(II) to Cu(I), we used three independent methods. In the first approach various Aβ peptides, vitamin C (as a positive control), and other control polypeptides were incubated with Cu(II)-glycine chelate. Cu(I) formation was monitored using a chromogenic Cu(I)-trapping agent, BC. Aβ1–42 and Aβ1–40 were the only tested peptides found to reduce significant amounts of Cu(II) to Cu(I) (generating 6 and 3 μm, respectively) during the 1-h incubation period (Fig. 1). Cu(II) was not significantly reduced (<1 μm) by rat/mouse Aβ1–40, reverse sequence human peptide (Aβ40–1), amylin, insulin, Aβ1–28, or Aβ25–35 (Fig. 1). Since it has been pointed out that BC could also bind to Cu(II), potentially altering its reduction potential and cause artifactual estimates of Cu(I) (23Sayre L.M. Science. 1996; 274: 1933-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we corroborated the apparent Cu(II)-reducing properties of Aβ1–40/2 by comparing the assay results using BC to those obtained with another Cu(I) detection agent, BCA. The apparent amounts of Cu(I) generated by Aβ1–42 and Aβ1–40 using either BC or BCA were in excellent agreement (Fig. 1, inset). Secondly, EPR spectroscopy was used to measure residual Cu(II) remaining after incubating stoichiometric ratios of CuCl2with Aβ1–40. This peptide caused a loss of the Cu(II) signal (76%), in relative agreement with the corresponding Cu(I) detected in the bioassays above. The detection of Cu(I) by BC assay, at levels roughly comparable to those estimated from loss of the EPR signal for Cu(II), suggests that the EPR signal was not disappearing due to formation of antiferromagnetically coupled (S = 0) dicopper species. Experimental EPR S-band spectra (Fig. 2) and X- and Q-band spectra (data not shown) establish that copper binds very tightly to these peptides. Fig. 2 A shows that an approximately equimolar mixture of Aβ1–40 and CuCl2 produces a single Cu(II)-peptide complex. The multiple resonance signal shown in the EPR spectrum for copper-peptide (Fig. 2 A) is for a single Aβ-bound Cu(II) species that is paramagnetic. Spin quantitation employing a dual mode TE104 X-band rectangular cavity revealed that this EPR signal accounted for 24% of the added Cu(II), consistent with 76% of the Cu(II) being converted to EPR-silent species, very likely Cu(I). There was no evidence of free, uncomplexed Cu(II) remaining after addition of the peptide, since unbound Cu(II) itself gives a different multiple resonance signal. The loss of 76% of the Cu(II) signal upon incubation with Aβ1–40 is compatible with peptide-mediated reduction of Cu(II) to diamagnetic Cu(I), which is undetectable. Computer simulation of the experimental spectrum of Aβ1–40 with an axially symmetric spin Hamiltonian and the g andA matrices (g ∥, 2.295;g ⊥, 2.073; A ∥, 163.60, A ⊥, 10.0 × 10−4cm−1) yielded the spectrum shown in Fig. 2 B. Expansion of the M I = −1/2 resonance revealed nitrogen ligand hyperfine coupling. Computer simulation of these resonances indicated the presence of at least three nitrogen atoms. The magnitude of the g ∥ andA ∥ values also suggest a tetragonally distorted geometry, which is commonly found in type 2 copper proteins (24Frausto da Silva J.J.R. Williams R.J.P. The Biological Chemistry of the Elements. Clarendon Press, Oxford1991Google Scholar), and together with the Blumberg Peisach plots, are consistent with a fourth equatorial ligand binding to copper via an oxygen rather than a sulfur donor atom. Thus, the coordination sphere for the copper-peptide complex is CuN3O1. The third line of independent evidence to support Aβ-dependent reduction of Cu(II) was the electrochemical behavior of Cu(II), assessed in the presence and absence of Aβ by cyclic voltammetry (Fig. 3). This revealed that Aβ1–42 (line c) gives rise to a voltammetric response with a formal reduction potential of approximately +500–550 mV (versus Ag/AgCl) in phosphate-buffered saline alone. This is an extraordinarily high positive potential, which suggests a Cu(I) oxidation state that is highly stabilized by the peptide. Our buffers, even after careful preparation and filtration through Chelex-100 resin, were found routinely to possess ≈0.1 μm copper background contamination, as assessed by inductively coupled plasma analysis (8Cherny R.A. Legg J.T. McLean C.A. Fairlie D. Huang X. Atwood C.S. Beyreuther K. Tanzi R.E. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23223-23228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). To determine whether interaction with this trace quantity of metal ion was responsible for the electrochemical response of Aβ, we added CuCl2 (17 μm) to the solution. This increased the magnitude of the response from the Aβ1–42 solution (line d), consistent with this potential being characteristic of a copper-Aβ complex. Background voltammograms of the PBS vehicle did not produce such peaks (line a), and Cu(II) in PBS showed only a Cu(II/I) peak in the reduction wave at ≈−80 mV (line b) along with the return oxidation wave. This reduction process was not observed when Cu(II) was added to Aβ1–42, consistent with the complete reaction of Cu(II) with Aβ. Since Cu(I) can in principle reduce O2, we tested Aβ peptides in the presence of Cu(II) (1 μm) for direct production of H2O2. We found that peroxide was indeed formed in these solutions, the amount of H2O2 produced in 1 h by the various Aβ and control peptides was greatest for Aβ1–42 (10 μm) > Aβ1–40 (7.5 μm) ≫ rat Aβ1–40, Aβ40–1, Aβ25–35, Aβ1–28, insulin, and amylin (≈0 μm) (Fig. 4 A), paralleling the amounts of metal reduction by the same peptides (Fig. 1). Validation of these results was achieved by coincubating Aβ with catalase, which abolished the H2O2 signal in a dose-dependent manner, and also by performing a corroborating assay using dichlorofluorescein (data not shown). To investigate whether the formation of H2O2 by Aβ was due to the specific reduction of O2, we studied the generation of H2O2 by Aβ1–42, Aβ1–40, and vitamin C under different O2 tensions in the presence of 1 μm Cu(II) (Fig. 4 B). The presence of vitamin C was used as a control measure to estimate the maximum amount of H2O2 that could be detected in the buffer vehicle by the non-protein generation of Cu(I). This experiment confirmed that there was a significant dependence of H2O2 production upon the O2tension. The presence of either Aβ1–42 and Aβ1–40 generated significantly more H2O2 (Aβ1–42 > Aβ1–40) than vitamin C under any O2 tension studied, and generated H2O2 under low O2 tension where vitamin C produced none. Under ambient and argon-purged conditions in this system, the reduction of Cu(II) alone by the positive control, vitamin C, was insufficient to produce detectable H2O2. Therefore, Aβ facilitated the reduction of O2 more than would be expected by the interaction of the Cu(I) reduced by Aβ with passively dissolved O2. Hence, Aβ acts not only to reduce metal ions, but also to trap molecular O2 to form H2O2. These data also suggest that copper cycles between the oxidized and reduced forms when bound to Aβ, since the presence of 1 μm Cu(II) was sufficient to produce a catalytic amount (10 μm) of H2O2 in 1 h, consistent with redox cycling and multiple electron donation events from Cu(I) to molecular O2. We examined Aβ1–42 (10 μm) in Cu(II) (1 μm in PBS, pH 7.4) for evidence of O2− formation over a 1 h incubation. Neither of the O2−-selective detection reagents hydroethidium (20 μm, Molecular Probes), nor nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT, 0.1 mm) detected O2− formation from Aβ, using xanthine (1 mm) with xanthine oxidase (0.015 units/ml) in PBS as a positive control. To prove that Aβ-mediated H2O2 formation is metal-ion dependent, H2O2 production by Aβ1–42 in the presence of copper-selective chelators was assayed (Fig. 4 C). The presence of 200 μm BC or diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid abolished Aβ-mediated H2O2 formation in the presence of 1 μm Cu(II). Triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride only decreased the formation of H2O2 by ≈50%, indicating that high affinity copper chelators may only be able to interrupt these interactions if they have sufficient stereochemical access to the bound copper atom. We tested the consequences of Cu(II)-Aβ interaction upon the survival of primary neuronal cultures. We found that the combination of Aβ1–42 with Cu(II)-glycine (each at 10 μm) significantly potentiated Aβ neurotoxicity (70% cell death in the presence of copper, 40% in its absence) (Fig. 5 A). The presence of catalase slightly rescued the toxicity of the peptide alone (30% cell death), but entirely rescued the fraction of Aβ1–42 toxicity that was enhanced by Cu(II), indicating that the potentiation of toxicity induced by the presence of Cu(II) was mediated by H2O2. Catalase could not completely rescue the toxicity of Aβ1–42, even when catalase was used at higher concentrations (2000 and 3000 IU, data not shown). Since Cu(II)-glycine alone was not neurotoxic, these results strongly support the possibility that Cu(II) interaction modifies Aβ leading to enhanced H2O2-mediated neurotoxicity. The inability of catalase to completely rescue the neurotoxicity caused by Aβ1–42 suggests that other neurotoxic mechanisms that are not mediated by H2O2 may contribute up to 25% of the lethality observed. To confirm that Cu(II)-enhanced toxicity of Aβ was mediated by extracellular H2O2 production, we studied the effects of Cu(II)-glycine supplementation upon the toxicity of the other biologically occurring Aβ species in primary neuronal culture, comparing human Aβ1–42 and Aβ1–40 to rat Aβ1–40 (Fig. 5 B). In the absence of additional Cu(II), Aβ1–42 was observed to be more neurotoxic than both human and rat Aβ1–40, whose lethal effects were indistinguishable and marginal at the concentrations tested (10–25 μm). However, whereas additional Cu(II) (10 μm) dramatically increased the toxicities of human Aβ1–42 and Aβ1–40, additional Cu(II) did not enhance the toxicity of rat Aβ1–40. The Cu(II)-induced potentiation of Aβ toxicity therefore followed the relationship of Aβ1–42 > Aβ1–40 ≫ rat Aβ1–40, which parallels both Cu(II) reduction, and the Cu(II)-mediated generation of H2O2, by the same peptides. Taken together, these data argue that Cu(II) enhances the neurotoxicity of Aβ substantially through the cell-free generation of H2O2. The experiments described above establish that Cu(II) is reduced by Aβ peptides, that Cu(I) mediates O2-dependent cell-free H2O2 generation, and that these properties directly correlate with the Cu(II)-mediated potentiation of Aβ neurotoxicity in cell culture. Previously, we showed that concentrations of Cu(II) at = 1 μm induce the aggregation of Aβ (17Atwood C.S. Moir R.D. Huang X. Bacarra N.M.E. Scarpa R.C. Romano D.M. Hartshorn M.A. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I.

Promising alternative antibiotics are the peptide antibiotics, abundant in host defense systems, which kill their targets by permeabilizing the plasma membrane. These peptides generally do not act via specific receptors and are active in the micromolar range. Here it is shown that vancomycin and the antibacterial peptide nisin Z use the same target: the membrane-anchored cell wall precursor Lipid II.

It is expressed most abundantly throughout the brain and in much lower amounts in liver, kidney, and lung. In addition to bile acids and the above steroids, human OATP has recently been shown to transport the adrenal androgen dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) (15Kullak-Ublick G.A. Fisch T. Oswald M.

This is due, at least in part, to their ability to lower low density lipoprotein cholesterol through the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in the liver. This results in an induction of hepatic low density lipoprotein receptors, thereby increasing the catabolism of circulating low density lipoprotein. The majority of statins, including lovastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin, are lipophilic molecules with high octanol:water partition coefficients, and, as such, they freely diffuse across membranes (21Hamelin B.A. Turgeon J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 26-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Consequently, they are potent inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase in a broad spectrum of tissues. In contrast, the reductase inhibitor pravastatin is hydrophilic in nature, is relatively membrane impermeable, and exhibits much greater tissue selectivity than the other statins. It is taken up, primarily in the liver, by a transport mechanism that is sodium-independent and is competitively inhibited by bile acids and dibromosulfophthaein in isolated rat hepatocytes (22Yamazaki M. Suzuki H. Hanano M. Tokui T. Komai T. Sugiyama Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G36-G44PubMed Google Scholar, 23Ziegler K. Stunkel W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1139: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It is the presence or absence of this transporter that is likely the basis for the tissue selectivity of pravastatin. However, the protein that is responsible for this pravastatin transport activity has not been identified. Because of their substrate specificities and tissue localization, members of the OATP family are good pravastatin transporter candidates.Clearly the OATP transporter class plays a critical role in hepatic organic anion uptake mechanisms. However, only a single human isoform has been identified, and it has very low hepatic expression. Consequently, we sought to identify additional human OATPs that are found in liver. The novel transporter, OATP2, was cloned, and its substrate specificity was examined in expression studies. It transports taurocholate, DHEAS, and pravastatin and is the only known OATP whose expression is confined to liver. Furthermore, we have identified oatp1 as a pravastatin transporter in the rat.DISCUSSIONThe present work describes a new member of the organic anion transporter polypeptide family, OATP2. It was obtained during efforts to uncover additional hepatic transporters and to define the molecular mechanism that mediates the transport of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. In addition to the novel human OATP2, oatp1 was also shown to transport pravastatin in the rat.OATP2 is unique among OATPs in several ways. It is substantially diverged in sequence from the other family members; it is only 42% identical to each of the other OATPs, compared with 67–82% identity seen among the other transporters. Furthermore, although all of the loops between TMDs are strictly conserved among the other transporters, OATP2 has additional amino acids in three of eleven loops. Our inability to clone the human hepatic pravastatin transporter by PCR using degenerate oligonucleotides that were conserved among the known OATPs is likely due to this divergence.Another distinguishing feature of OATP2 is its restricted pattern of expression. Out of 16 tissues examined, only liver was found to express OATP2 mRNA. This is in marked contrast to the other family members, all of which are found in multiple tissues in addition to liver. This includes kidney, skeletal muscle and colon for roatp1 (5Jacquemin E. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Wolkoff A.W. Meier P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), and kidney brain and retina for roatp2 and roatp3 (6Noe B. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Meier P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Human OATP mRNA, although found in liver, kidney, and lung, is expressed much more in brain than in these other tissues (14Kullak-Ublick G.A. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Schteingart C.D. Hofmann A.F. Wolkoff A.W. Meier P.J. Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 1274-1282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar).Although there is evidence for a single multivalent hepatocellular uptake site for amphipathic compounds (29Okudaira K. Yamazaki M. Sawatla Y. Sugiyama Y. Iga T. Hanano M. Pharmacol. Res. 1992; 9: 1152-1156Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 30Steen H. Merema M. Meijer D.K.F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 2323-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the discovery of a second OATP isoform in human suggests that, as in the rat, such uptake is in fact mediated by more than one carrier with partially overlapping substrate specificities. A comparison of OATP2 with human OATP reveals that the two proteins are functionally distinct with respect to the types of substrates transported by each. Both OATP2 (Fig. 8) and OATP (14Kullak-Ublick G.A. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Schteingart C.D. Hofmann A.F. Wolkoff A.W. Meier P.J.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) transport taurocholate and DHEAS. However, only OATP2 transports HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Furthermore, the two appear to differ in their transport of steroids; OATP mediates the uptake of conjugates such as estradiol 17β-d-glucuronide (3Meier P.J. Eckhardt U. Schroeder A. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 1667-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) and estrone-3-sulfate (9Bossuyt X. Muller M. Meier P.J. J. Hepatol. 1996; 25: 733-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), whereas OATP2 transports neither the former nor the neutral steroid, aldosterone. OATP has been demonstrated to transport bile acid. However it does so with a 60-fold lower transport rate in Xenopus oocytes compared with roatp1. This suggests that OATP may not mediate the majority of hepatic bile acid uptake in humans. Indeed, the much higher level of expression in brain compared with other tissues indicates that OATP may be more important in CNS transport processes than in liver uptake mechanisms (14Kullak-Ublick G.A. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Schteingart C.D. Hofmann A.F. Wolkoff A.W. Meier P.J. Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 1274-1282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Thus, OATP2 may be the predominant sodium-independent transporter of bile acids in human liver, whereas OATP might be a relatively minor hepatic carrier.DHEAS along with the nonsulfated DHEA are the major circulating adrenal steroids, serving as precursors for endogenous sex steroid synthesis (31Longcope C. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 150: S125-S127PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, they have been suggested to have positive neuropsychiatric, immune, and metabolic effects (32Bates G.W. Buster J.E. Casson P.R. Curr. Opin. Endocrinol. Diab. 1998; 5: 357-366Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). OATP2 is the second DHEAS transporter described to date and the only hepato-specific carrier. The majority of DHEAS is formed in the liver from the sulfation of DHEA, after which it is effluxed back into the circulation across the sinusoidal surface of the hepatocyte (33Longcope C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 774: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Furthermore, taurocholate inhibitable DHEAS uptake into isolated rat hepatocytes is also known to occur (34Reuter S. Mayer D. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 54: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Because members of this family are bi-directional transporters, OATP2 along with OATP are candidates for either of these transport processes in humans.A search for pravastatin transport activity in the rat revealed that rat oatp1 but not oatp2 mediates pravastatin uptake in vitro. In addition to this transport activity in transfected cells, several other lines of evidence suggest that this is the protein responsible for pravastatin uptake observed in rat hepatocytes. Yamazaki et al. (22Yamazaki M. Suzuki H. Hanano M. Tokui T. Komai T. Sugiyama Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G36-G44PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that uptake in liver cells was sodium-independent, appeared to be a single component, and was competitively inhibited by taurocholate and other cholephils as well as the lipophilic statins, lovastatin, and simvastatin. The order of potency for inhibition of radiolabeled pravastatin transport into rat hepatocytes was lovastatin = simvastatin ≫ taurocholate > pravastatin. The above characteristics of hepatic pravastatin uptake mechanisms are consistent with the known properties of roatp1 and its behavior in mediating pravastatin transport in this study: (i) roatp1 expression is relatively restricted, being expressed in relatively few organs, including liver, consistent with the relative hepatoselectivity of pravastatin; (ii) roatp1 is a sodium-independent transporter of bile acid; and (iii) in the present studies, [3H]pravastatin transport was inhibited by lovastatin, simvastatin, taurocholate, and pravastatin in the same rank order as in isolated hepatocytes. Furthermore, pravastatin inhibits the sodium-independent uptake of taurocholate in rat hepatocytes (22Yamazaki M. Suzuki H. Hanano M. Tokui T. Komai T. Sugiyama Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G36-G44PubMed Google Scholar, 23Ziegler K. Stunkel W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1139: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and in roatp1-transfected 293c18 cells.Liver and kidney are the two principle organs of distribution when pravastatin is administered intravenously to rats. This clearance occurs by uptake on the sinusoidal or basolateral side of the liver cell followed by biliary excretion across the canilicular membrane. Rat oatp1 has been localized to the basolateral surface of the hepatocyte (34Reuter S. Mayer D. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 54: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), consistent with a role in hepatic pravastatin clearance (35Bergwerk A.J. Shi X. Ford A.C. Kanai N. Jacquemin E. Burk R.D. Bai S. Novikoff P.M. Stieger B. Meier P.J. Schuster V.L. Wolkoff A.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G231-G238PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the unrelated multi-drug resistance protein, cMOAT (canilicular multi-specific organicanion transporter), is thought to be the canilicular transporter (36Fukumura S. Takikawa H. Yamanaka M. Pharmacol. Res. 1998; 15: 72-76Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). With regard to renal elimination of this drug, there is uptake from the basolateral side of the renal tubular epithelial cell in addition to glomerular filtration (37Yamazaki M. Tokui T. Ishigami M. Sugiyama Y. Biopharm. Drug Dispos. 1996; 17: 775-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, in the kidney, in contrast to the situation in liver, roatp1 resides on the apical surface of the epithelial cell, and thus, it cannot be responsible for the pravastatin uptake that occurs on the basolateral side. This implies that there is yet another pravastatin transporter in rat kidney that has this activity. It could be the recently reported roatp3, the unrelated rat OAT1 (38Sweet D.H. Wolff N.A. Pritchard J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30088-30095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), or cMOAT, all of which are expressed in kidney. Because OATP transporters are bi-directional in nature (39Shi X. Bai S. Ford A.C. Burk R.D. Jacquemin E. Hagenbuch B. Meier P.J. Wolkoff A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25591-25595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), roatp1 may transport pravastatin and other statins from the inside of the epithelial cell through the apical membrane to the lumen of the renal tubule in rat kidney. Alternatively it could be an as yet undescribed transporter.Likewise, because significant elimination of pravastatin also occurs via tubular epithelial cell transport in human kidneys (40Singhvi S.M. Pan H.Y. Morrison R.A. Willard D.A. Br. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1990; 29: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), an additional pravastatin transporter must exist in humans other than the liver-specific OATP2. Because the uptake of pravastatin into tissues is absolutely dependent on carrier mediated transport, the difference in the tissues expressing human and rat pravastatin transporters (oatp1 in rat liver, kidney, brain, lung, and skeletal muscle, and OATP only in human liver) could result in pharmacodynamic differences in the distribution of this drug between the two species.The importance of heptocellular uptake in the elimination of any drug is largely determined by its physiochemical properties. Polar organic hydrophilic compounds require specific carriers for uptake into hepatocytes, whereas lipophilic compounds are freely permeable to the basolateral hepatocyte membrane and exhibit flow-dependent distribution in the liver. Even though such drugs do not require specific uptake mechanisms, they can act as substrates for transporters and can potentially alter the hepatic handling of other drugs or endogenous compounds (41Evans A.M. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 1996; 23: 970-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). There are examples of both kinds of drugs among HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Pravastatin is an example of the former class, in which oatp1 and OATP2 are likely required for rat and human hepatic uptake, respectively. The lipophilic statins simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin are thought to be in the second class; they do not require carriers for extraction by the liver. However, the data presented here suggest that they are nevertheless very potent inhibitors of radiolabeled pravastatin and taurocholate transport by oatp1 and OATP2, showing much greater inhibition than the unlabeled substrates themselves. Although the mode of this inhibition will require more detailed mechanistic studies, it suggests that the lipophilic statins may utilize these carriers as well.In summary, we have identified a liver-specific member of the organic anion transport protein family in humans that mediates the transport of bile acid, the adrenal androgen DHEAS, and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, a clinically important class of hypolipidemic agents. The divergent sequence of OATP2, its substrate specificity, and its unique tissue distribution indicate that it is not the human orthologue of any previously described OATP, and thus, it represents a new functional entity. This should further facilitate the understanding of hepatic transport and clearance mechanisms for the molecules described as well as additional substrates. The liver functions in the clearance of a large variety of metabolic products, drugs, and other xenobiotics by transporting them across the sinusoidal membrane into the hepatocyte. Several classes of transport systems have been described that mediate these processes including the Na+/taurocholate cotransporter polypeptide, in rat and human liver (1Hagenbuch B. Stieger B.

Invest. 1994; 93: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), and a family of organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs)1 that are principally expressed in liver, kidney, and brain. These transport a broad spectrum of substrates in a sodium-independent manner (3Meier P.J. Eckhardt U. Schroeder A. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B.

The distribution of this latter family of transporters in liver, kidney, and choroid plexus in the brain is thought to reflect common physiological requirements of these organs for the clearance of a multitude of organic anions. There are three OATP isoforms identified to date in the rat: roatp1 (5Jacquemin E. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Wolkoff A.W. Meier P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Rat oatp1 and oatp2 are abundantly expressed in liver and kidney and much less in brain, whereas oatp3 is absent in liver but highly expressed in kidney. In addition to bile acids, OATPs are known to transport a variety of other compounds. These include, depending on the transporter, unconjugated and conjugated steroids, such as estrone sulfate, estradiol-17B-glucuronide, and aldosterone, and cardiac glycosides (6Noe B. Hagenbuch B.

In contrast to the rat, only one transporter of this family, OATP, has been identified in humans (14Kullak-Ublick G.A. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Schteingart C.D. Hofmann A.F. Wolkoff A.W. Meier P.J.

It is expressed most abundantly throughout the brain and in much lower amounts in liver, kidney, and lung. In addition to bile acids and the above steroids, human OATP has recently been shown to transport the adrenal androgen dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) (15Kullak-Ublick G.A. Fisch T. Oswald M.

This is due, at least in part, to their ability to lower low density lipoprotein cholesterol through the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in the liver. This results in an induction of hepatic low density lipoprotein receptors, thereby increasing the catabolism of circulating low density lipoprotein. The majority of statins, including lovastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin, are lipophilic molecules with high octanol:water partition coefficients, and, as such, they freely diffuse across membranes (21Hamelin B.A. Turgeon J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 26-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Consequently, they are potent inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase in a broad spectrum of tissues. In contrast, the reductase inhibitor pravastatin is hydrophilic in nature, is relatively membrane impermeable, and exhibits much greater tissue selectivity than the other statins. It is taken up, primarily in the liver, by a transport mechanism that is sodium-independent and is competitively inhibited by bile acids and dibromosulfophthaein in isolated rat hepatocytes (22Yamazaki M.

We isolated a novel galanin-like peptide (GALP) from porcine hypothalamus by observing its activity for increasing [35S]GTPγS binding to a membrane preparation of GALR2-transfected cells. The peptide had 60 amino acid residues and a non-amidated C terminus. The amino acid sequence of GALP-(9–21) was completely identical to that of galanin-(1–13). A cloned porcine GALP cDNA indicated that GALP was processed from a 120-amino acid GALP precursor protein. The structures of rat and human GALP-(1–60) were deduced from cloned cDNA, which indicated that the amino acid sequences 1–24 and 41–53 were highly conserved between humans, rats, and pigs. Receptor binding studies revealed that porcine GALP-(1–60) had a high affinity for the GALR2 receptor (IC50 = 0.24 nm) and a lower affinity for the GALR1 receptor (IC50 = 4.3 nm). In contrast, galanin showed high affinity for the GALR1 (IC50= 0.097 nm) and GALR2 receptors (IC50 = 0.48 nm). GALP is therefore an endogenous ligand that preferentially binds the GALR2 receptor, whereas galanin is relatively non-selective.

FEBS Lett. 1983; 164: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar) and was later found to be ubiquitous in the central and peripheral nervous systems. It exerts diverse regulatory functions including central modulation of cognition, nociception, and feeding behavior, endocrine control of pituitary and pancreatic hormones, and regulation of gastrointestinal smooth muscle contractions (for review, see Refs. 2Bartfai T.

Structurally, galanin is unrelated to any known family of neuropeptides or regulatory peptides, suggesting the presence of unknown members of a galanin peptide family. Indeed, the existence of a galanin-like peptide(s) in mammalian tissues has been proposed for several reasons. First, molecular heterogeneity of galanin-like immunoreactivity has been reported by several groups. Rökaeus et al. (4Rökaeus Å. Melander T. Hökfelt T. Lundberg J.M. Tatemoto K. Carlquist M. Mutt V. Neurosci.

Nevertheless, some of these immunoreactivities may be the result of galanin precursors or galanin-derived peptides, as described in the subsequent studies (5Sillard R. Rökaeus Å. Xu Y. Carlquist M.

The low affinity of human galanin for human GALR3 (12Smith K.E. Walker M.W. Artymyshyn R. Bard J. Borowsky B. Tamm J.A. Yao W.-J. Vaysse P.J.-J. Branchek T.A. Gerald C. Jones K.A. J. Biol.

Third, the chimeric peptides antagonizing galanin in vivo were agonists for the cloned GALR1, GALR2 (10Smith K.E. Forray C. Walker M.W. Jones K.A. Tamm J.A. Bard J. Branchek T.A. Linemeyer D.L.

Another explanation is that the chimeric peptides elicit activation of an unknown receptor, which results in antagonizing the galanin effect. Endogenous ligand for such receptors must be structurally related to galanin. In the present study, we studied endogenous galanin-like peptides using cloned GALR1 and GALR2 and discovered a novel galanin-like peptide, GALP, in the porcine hypothalamus. The physiological significance of GALP in light of the above discussion should be elucidated in future studies. Rat GALR1 (8Parker E.M. Izzarelli D.G. Nowak H.P. Mahle C.D. Iben L.G. Wang J.

The membranes (200 μl) were mixed with 50 nm[35S]GTPγS (NEN Life Science Products) (2 μl) and peptide samples (2 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide solution). After incubation at 25 °C for 60 min, the reaction mixtures were diluted with 1.5 ml of chilled TEM buffer, pH 7.4, containing 20 mmTris, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% CHAPS, and 1 mg/ml BSA, and were then filtered through GF/F glass fiber filters. The filters were washed with 1.5 ml of TEM buffer, dried, and subjected to liquid scintillation counting. Dose-response curves were obtained with 3.7 μg/ml GALR1 or 7.5 μg/ml GALR2 membranes. For a single batch of preparation, 30 porcine hypothalami including surrounding tissues (1 kg) were heat-denatured in boiling water (4000 ml) for 10 min, cooled on ice, and homogenized using a Polytron homogenizer. The homogenate was mixed with 1/17 volume of glacial acetic acid, stirred overnight at 4 °C, and centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 rpm in a Hitachi RR10 rotor. Two volumes of acetone was added to the resultant supernatant for protein precipitation. After centrifugation to remove the precipitate, the clear extract was collected, concentrated using a rotary evaporator, and then phase-partitioned twice with diethyl ether. The aqueous extract from each of the two batches of preparation was loaded onto a C-18 column (YMCgel ODS-AM 120-S50, 50 × 200 mm), eluted with 60% acetonitrile-0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and subjected to evaporation and lyophilization. The lyophilized powder (1–1.5 g from two batches of preparation) was dissolved in 50 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and each 10 ml was purified using an ODS80-TM HPLC column (21.5 × 300 mm, Tosoh). Elution was performed by a linear gradient increase of acetonitrile concentration from 20 to 60% in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 120 min at a flow rate of 4 ml/min at 40 °C. The eluate was collected at each 8-ml fraction. The ODS80-TM HPLC fractions 45–48 from eight batches of preparation were lyophilized, dissolved in 1 m acetic acid, and loaded onto an SP-Sephadex C-25 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (2.1 × 4.5 cm). After washing the column with 1 m acetic acid and 2 mpyridine, GALP activity was eluted with 2 m pyridine/acetic acid. The eluate was lyophilized, dissolved in 1 m acetic acid, and gel-filtered on a Sephadex G50 (fine grade, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (2.5 × 200 mm), which was equilibrated with 1 m acetic acid. The fractions with GALP activity were lyophilized, dissolved in 10 mm ammonium formate-40% acetonitrile buffer, and purified using a CM-2SW HPLC column (4.8 × 300 mm, Tosoh). Elution was performed by a linear gradient increase of ammonium formate concentration from 10 to 500 mm for 60 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min at 25 °C. The eluate was collected at each 0.5-ml fraction. The active fractions-(94–96) were lyophilized, dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and purified using a Super-Phenyl HPLC column (4.6 × 100 mm, Tosoh). Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile concentration from 27 to 33% for 60 min in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min at 40 °C and collected at each 0.5-ml fraction. The active fractions-(66–68) were directly injected to a Super-ODS HPLC column (4.6 × 100 mm, Tosoh). Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile concentration from 33 to 48% in 0.1% heptafluorobutyric acid for 60 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min at 40 °C. The eluate was collected at each 0.5-ml fraction. The active fractions-(82–83) were pooled as purified peptide. Four chymotryptic fragments were generated by incubating a purified peptide (50–100 pmol) with 10 pmol of TLCK-chymotrypsin (Sigma) in 1% NH4HCO3buffer including 4% acetonitrile and 20% dimethyl sulfoxide. Fragment peptides were purified using a Spheri-5 RP-18 HPLC column (Brownlee, 2.1 × 30 mm) by a linear gradient elution of acetonitrile concentration from 0 to 70% for 30 min in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The peptides were then subjected to N-terminal sequencing using a peptide sequencer (Biosystems Procise 491cLC, Perkin-Elmer) and to mass spectrometry using a JEOL HX-110 equipped with a cesium gun for the LSIMS mode. Undigested peptide was also subjected to N-terminal sequencing to determine the alignment of the fragment peptides. All oligonucleotides were custom synthesized by Japan Bio Service Co. Ltd. The porcine GALP cDNA fragment was amplified using the nested PCR method with degenerate primers. The first PCR was performed with 5′-CA(C/T)(A/C)GNGGI(A/C)GNGGIGG(G/C)TGGAC-3′ (pGAL4-7F designed from peptide sequence HRGRGGWT); 5′-ATICCNAGIGCNGT(C/T)TTICC(C/T)TT-3′ (pGAL34-1R designed from peptide sequence KGKTALGI); Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa); and first-strand cDNA synthesized from porcine brain poly(A)+ RNA by 32 cycles of 94 °C for 20 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, with a final extension at 72 °C for 4 min. The nested PCR was performed with 5′-GG(A/T/C)TGGACNCTNAA(C/T)AG(C/T)GC-3′ (pGAL9-3F designed from peptide sequence GWTLNSA), pGAL34-1R, Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa), and the first-PCR product as a template using the same thermal cycling profile as listed above. The resultant 98-bp DNA fragment (5′-GGCTGGACTTTAAATAGTGCTGGTTACCTCCTGGGTCCCGTACTCCATCCGCCCTCCAGGGCTGAAGGAGGCGGGAAGGGCAAAACAGCC CTGGGCAT-3′) was cloned and used as a probe for screening GALP cDNA in a porcine brain cDNA library (2.2 × 106 plaque-forming units, constructed using ZAP-cDNA Gigapack III Gold cloning kit, Stratagene). Phage DNA was transferred to nylon membranes, prehybridized in a hybridization buffer consisting of 5× SSPE (saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA), 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA at 60 °C for 24 h, and then hybridized with the 32P-labeled probes (5 × 105 cpm/ml) in the hybridization buffer at 60 °C for 24 h. The membranes were washed with 0.1% SDS-0.2× SSC at 50 °C for 30 min and subjected to autoradiography with x-ray films (Kodak Biomax film) at −70 °C for 3 days. Five positive clones were isolated by plaque purification. The plasmids were excised using a Rapid Excision kit (Stratagene). Rat GALP cDNA was screened from a rat brain cDNA library (2.2 × 106plaque-forming units, constructed using the ZAP-cDNA Gigapack III Gold cloning kit, Stratagene) using a 356-bp porcine GALP ORF cDNA probe, which was made using PCR with a forward primer (5′-ATGGCTCTGACTGTCCCTCTGATCGTTCT-3′) and a reverse primer (5′-TGAAACCTCGTAGTTCCTGGTCGGATTCG-3′). Hybridization was performed as described above. The membranes were washed with 0.1% SDS-2× SSC at 50 °C for 30 min. Two positive clones were isolated to a single plaque. A human GALP cDNA fragment was amplified from human whole brain cDNA usingTaq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa), a forward primer (5′-AGGCTGGACCCTCAATAGTGCTGGTTAC-3′ (F/h120)), and a reverse primer (5′-CCATCTATGGCCTTCCACAGGTCTAGGA-3′ (R/h120)) by the PCR program as 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s, with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The sequence of the resultant 126-bp DNA was obtained, and two primers (5′-CAAATGGGTGACCAAGACGGAAAGAGGG-3′ (1F/h120) and 5′-GGTCTAGGATCTCAAGGGCTGTCTCCCT-3′ (1R/h120)) were designed for 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE experiments. For the 3′-RACE experiment, PCR was performed first with human cDNA (CLONTECH, Marathon-Ready cDNA), F/h120 primer, and AP1 primer (CLONTECH) and then with the first-PCR product, 1F/h120 primer, and AP2 primer (CLONTECH). Both reactions were done withTaq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa) using the touch down program: 5 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 2 min, 5 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s and 70 °C for 2 min, 25 cycles of 94 °C for 20 s and 68 °C for 2 min, with a final extension at 68 °C for 10 min. The 5′-RACE experiment was performed as described above, first with the R/h120 and AP1 primers and then with the 1R/h120 and AP2 primers. A 473-bp DNA was amplified from human whole brain cDNA (CLONTECH) using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene), a forward primer (5′-GAGGAGCCAGAGAGAGCTGCGGAGAG-3′ (1F/hORF)), and a reverse primer (5′-GAGCTGGAGAAGAAGGATAGGAACAGGG-3′ (3R/hORF)) by the PCR program as 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s and 70 °C for 5 min, with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The sequencing reactions were performed using BigDye terminator cycle sequencing FS ready reaction kit (Perkin-Elmer). The reaction mixtures were analyzed using an automated sequencer (Perkin-Elmer, Applied Biosystems Prism 377). Porcine GALP-(1–60) was synthesized by a peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, model 430A). The synthesized peptide was de-protected using HF and purified to a single peak. The sequence of the synthesized peptide was confirmed by sequencing analysis and mass spectrometry after digestion into four chymotryptic peptide fragments. The experiment was performed using membranes from the CHO cell transfectants. Membranes (2.9 μg/ml for GALR1 and 6 μg/ml for GALR2) were incubated with 100 pm125I-rat galanin (NEN Life Science Products) and increasing concentrations of rat galanin (the Peptide Institute) or porcine GALP (1–60) at 25 °C for 90 min in binding buffer (pH 7.3) containing 20 mm Tris, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm o-phenanthroline, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml lepeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 8 μg/ml E-64, and 1 mg/ml BSA. The reaction mixtures were diluted with 1.5 ml of TEM buffer and filtered through GF/F filters pretreated with 0.3% polyethyleneimine. The filters were washed with 1.5 ml of TEM buffer and subjected to γ-counting. We established stable CHO cell transfectants expressing a large number of rat GALR1 (13.8 pmol/mg protein) and GALR2 (6.6 pmol/mg protein). These cells allowed simple and sensitive detection of galanin-like agonistic activity by measuring the increase in [35S]GTPγS binding to cell membranes. Using this assay combined with C-18 reversed-phase HPLC analysis, we investigated the galanin-like agonistic activity found in porcine hypothalamus. As shown in Fig. 1 A, a single major peak of activity was observed for GALR1. This activity was attributed to galanin because of its elution profile and immunoreactivity. In contrast, a second peak following the first galanin peak was observed for GALR2. A preliminary characterization of this activity revealed that it was broken by Pronase treatment, was more cationic and larger than galanin (M r = 5000–6000), and was undetectable using a porcine galanin radioimmunoassay kit (Peninsula). Galanin-derived peptides with a similar elution profile were not found in a previous detailed study describing variant forms of galanin in porcine brains (5Sillard R. Rökaeus Å. Xu Y. Carlquist M. Bergman T. Jörnvall H. Mutt V. Peptides. 1992; 13: 1055-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We therefore considered that the porcine hypothalamus contains a non-galanin-derived peptide with GALR2-preferential agonistic activity. Similar GALR2-agonistic activity was also found in extract from other porcine tissues including the pituitary gland, brain, and small intestine. The GALR2-agonistic activity was isolated from porcine hypothalamus for further characterization. The activity was separated into major activity I, minor activity II, and minor activity III during the Super-Phenyl HPLC step (Fig. 1 C). The major activity I was further purified to a single peak (Fig. 1 E). Approximately 200 pmol of the purified peptide was obtained from the dissected hypothalamus of 240 brains (8–9 kg of wet tissues). The N-terminal 30 amino acid residues of the peptide were determined as APVHRGRGGWTLNSAGYLLGPVLHPPSRAE by direct N-terminal sequencing analysis. The peptide was further digested into four peptide fragments with chymotrypsin. The sequences of these fragments were determined by N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry as follows: TLNSAGY (m/z = 725.5), APVHRGRGGW (m/z = 1092.5), KAIDGLPYPQSQLAS (m/z = 1588.6), and LLGPVLHPPSRAEGGGKGKTALGILD(LW/HY) (m/z = 2854.0). The C-terminal 2 residues of the last fragment could not be determined by peptide sequencing. Two possible sequences (LW/HY) were deduced from the m/z value and substrate specificity of chymotrypsin. Taking together the results from the direct N-terminal sequencing analysis and the chymotryptic fragments, the amino acid sequence of the purified peptide was determined as APVHRGRGGWTLNSAGYLLGPVLHPPSRAEGGGKGKT-ALGILD(LW/HY)KAIDGLPYPQSQLAS. The C terminus was not amidated, in contrast to many other neuropeptides. A thorough data base search revealed that the 60-amino acid sequence was indeed novel. It was of particular interest that 13 amino acid residues of the peptide-(9–21) were completely identical to the N-terminal 13 residues of galanin. The N-terminal 15 residues of galanin are conserved in numerous species (2Bartfai T. Hkfelt T. Langel Ü. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1993; 7: 229-274PubMed Google Scholar, 3Crawley J.N. Regul. Pept. 1995; 59: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these 13 residues are considered to be highly involved in galanin receptor binding and are used as a core sequence for producing chimeric peptide antagonists such as galanin-(1–13)/substance P-(5–11) amide (M15), galanin-(1–13)/spantide I (C7), and galanin-(1–13)/bradykinin-(2–9) amide (M35). Because of its striking structural characteristic, the peptide was designated GALP-(1–60). Two minor components of GALP activity (Fig. 1 E) were also purified from minor activity II (Fig. 1 C) and were determined to be GALP-(1–59) and GALP-(1–58). Molecular cloning of porcine GALP cDNA was performed by library screening using a 98-bp DNA probe obtained by degenerated PCR. We isolated a 974-bp cDNA clone (GenBankTM accession no.AF188490) that had a 360-bp ORF starting from ATG at position 35 (Fig. 2). The adjacent sequence of this ATG (GCCCTCAGatgG) partially conformed to Kozak's rules (GCCACCatgG) (15Kozak M. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Searching the upstream 5′ non-coding region of other clones, we found an in-frame stop codon and no initiation codon (data not shown). An AATAAA polyadenylation signal was found in the 3′ non-coding region of this clone. The open reading frame encodes the GALP precursor protein with 120 amino acid residues. The N-terminal 20–22 residues of the precursor protein showed characteristics of a signal sequence consisting of hydrophobic clusters followed by small polar residues. Computer analysis using the SignalP server (16Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar) predicted that the most likely cleavage site of the signal peptide was between Ala23 and Pro24. This was very close to the experimental result in that the purified peptide started from Ala23. Therefore, the mature peptide directly flanks the signal peptide. This is different from the case of galanin in which the N terminus is generated by successive cleavage of a signal peptide and processing at paired basic Lys-Arg residues (17Evans H.F. Shine J. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 1682-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 18Rökaeus Å. Brownstein M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6287-6291Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 19Vrontakis M.E. Peden L.M. Duckworth M.L. Friesen H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16755-16758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C terminus of GALP-(1–60) was revealed to be generated by cleavage at the residues Ser82-Lys83-Arg84. This C-terminal cleavage site is similar to that of human galanin (Ser-Lys-Arg) (17Evans H.F. Shine J. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 1682-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) or that of glucagon (Thr-Lys-Arg) (20Bell G.I. Santerre R.F. Mullenbach G.T. Nature. 1983; 302: 716-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), which provides a non-amidated serine or threonine residue at the C terminus. The two residues, which were not clear during peptide sequencing, were determined to be Leu66-Trp67. We next isolated a rat GALP cDNA clone from a cDNA library, which had a 369-bp open reading frame (GenBankTM accession no. AF188491). Given Kozak's rule, however, the second ATG (TCCAGGatgG), and not the first ATG (AGCTGTatgC), serves as an initiation codon. The deduced rat GALP precursor protein had 115 amino acid residues. A human GALP cDNA clone (GenBankTMaccession no. AF188492) was further obtained using PCR. It had an open reading frame encoding the human GALP precursor protein of 116 amino acid residues. The alignment of human, rat, and porcine precursor proteins (Fig. 3) suggests that human and rat mature peptides start from Ala25 and Ala24, respectively. Processing at the C terminus probably occurs at Ser84-Lys85-Arg86 in humans and at Thr83-Lys84-Arg85 in rats, which corresponds to the Ser82-Lys83-Arg84 cleavage site of porcine GALP. Consequently, human and rat GALP-(1–60) will be produced. The additional paired basic residues, Gly57-Lys58-Arg59, were found in human GALP-(1–60). Nevertheless, processing into a smaller peptide at this site is controversial because this site is not conserved in rats and pigs. The amino acid sequence of GALP-(1–60) was conserved at residues 1–24 and 41–53 between humans, rats, and pigs. Interestingly, DNA sequences for the galanin/GALP-shared 13 residues were more conserved among the GALP of different species than between the GALP and galanin (17Evans H.F. Shine J. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 1682-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 18Rökaeus Å. Brownstein M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1987; 262: 16755-16758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the same species, which indicates that GALP is not a splicing variant of galanin and that the genes for the two peptides diverged early in the process of evolution. Porcine GALP-(1–60) was chemically synthesized for pharmacological characterization and was shown to have the same retention time as the purified natural peptide GALP-(1–60) (Fig. 1 E). Receptor binding studies were performed using membrane preparations of the CHO transfectants expressing rat GALR1 and GALR2. The K d values of 125I-rat galanin from the saturation binding experiment were 18 pm for GALR1 and 65 pm for GALR2. The IC50 values of rat galanin and porcine GALP-(1–60) were determined by competitive binding experiments using125I-rat galanin. As summarized in Table I, rat galanin had quite a high affinity for GALR1, whereas porcine GALP-(1–60) had a 44-fold lower affinity. GALP-(1–60) and galanin had similarly high affinities for GALR2. The agonistic activity of GALP and galanin was measured using a [35S]GTPγS binding assay, and the EC50values were obtained from dose-response curves. Rat galanin exerted potent activity for GALR1, whereas porcine GALP-(1–60) was 180-fold less potent. In contrast, porcine GALP-(1–60) and rat galanin showed a similar activity for GALR2.Table IPharmacological characterization of GALPReceptor binding (IC50)[35S]GTPγS binding (EC50)GALR1GALR2GALR1GALR2nmnmRat galanin0.097 ± 0.0040.48 ± 0.020.16 ± 0.025.2 ± 0.5Porcine GALP4.3 ± 0.090.24 ± 0.0130 ± 42.4 ± 0.4 Open table in a new tab In summary, we discovered a novel galanin-like peptide, GALP, in porcine hypothalamus that preferentially binds and activates the GALR2 relative to the GALR1. The binding affinity of GALP for GALR3 was not determined, because significant 125I-rat galanin binding was not reproduced with GALR3-transfected COS-7 cells. Both galanin and GALP are distributed in porcine hypothalamus, whereas all three subtypes of the galanin receptor have been found in the rat hypothalamus (8Parker E.M. Izzarelli D.G. Nowak H.P.

To elucidate the physiological significance of GALP in the hypothalamus, immunohistochemical studies for revealing the localization of GALP in comparison with that of galanin and its receptors will be required. The possible presence of GALP-selective binding sites should also be investigated. It is our hope that the discovery of GALP will contribute to the development of a new horizon of knowledge about neuroendocrine regulation. We are grateful to Drs. Osamu Nishimura, Yasuhiro Sumino, and Masaaki Mori for helpful discussions and encouragement."

However, all previous biophysical studies with the recombinant prion protein have been performed in an aqueous solution. To determine the effect of a membrane environment on the conformational structure of PrP, we studied the interaction of the recombinant human prion protein with model lipid membranes. The protein was found to bind to acidic lipid-containing membrane vesicles. This interaction is pH-dependent and becomes particularly strong under acidic conditions. Spectroscopic data show that membrane binding of PrP results in a significant ordering of the N-terminal part of the molecule.

Overall, these results show that the conformational structure and stability of the recombinant human PrP in a membrane environment are substantially different from those of the free protein in solution.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13387Crossref PubMed Scopus (5151) Google Scholar, 2Weissmann C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 3Gajdusek D.C. Science. 1977; 197: 943-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). One of the hallmarks of prion diseases is cerebral accumulation of an abnormal form of prion protein (PrP),1PrPSc, which is derived from the normal cell surface glycoprotein, PrPC. According to the “protein only” hypothesis, PrPSc is the sole agent responsible for the pathogenesis of spongiform encephalopathies (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13387Crossref PubMed Scopus (5151) Google Scholar, 4Prusiner S.B. Science. 1982; 216: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (4103) Google Scholar). The conversion of PrPC into PrPSc occurs as a post-translational process without any detectable covalent modifications to the protein molecule (5Stahl N. Baldwin M.A. Teplow D.B. Hood L. Gibson B.W. Burlingame A.L. Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1991-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). The chemical identity of PrPC and PrPSc contrasts with their markedly different physical properties. Thus, PrPC is monomeric and readily degradable by proteinase K, whereas PrPSc forms highly insoluble aggregates and shows a remarkable resistance to proteolytic digestion (6Meyer R.K. McKinley M.P. Bowman K.A. Braunfeld M.B. Barry R.A. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2310-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 7Oesch B. Westaway D. Walchli M. McKinley M.P.

These characteristics most likely reflect different conformations of the two protein isoforms. Indeed, optical spectroscopic data indicate that PrPC isolated from normal brain is highly α-helical, whereas PrPSc contains a large proportion of β-sheet structure (8Pan K.M. Baldwin M. Nguyen J. Gasset M. Serban A. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. Huang Z. Fletterick R.J. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It is believed that the conversion of PrPC into PrPSc constitutes the key molecular event in the pathogenesis of prion diseases. However, the molecular mechanism of the conformational transition between the normal and pathogenic forms of prion protein remains poorly understood. Structural and biophysical studies of prion protein have been hampered by difficulties encountered in obtaining highly purified material from the brain. Only recently have expression systems been developed for large scale production of the recombinant prion protein inEscherichia coli (11Hornemann S. Glockshuber R. J. Mol.

However, a critical limitation of all these studies is that they have been performed in an aqueous solution, whereas PrPC in a living cell is associated with cellular membranes (24Stahl N. Borchelt D.R. Hsiao K. Prusiner S.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 229-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). To bridge the gap between the cellular studies with the authentic PrPC and the experiments with the recombinant PrP in an aqueous solution, we have characterized the biophysical properties of the recombinant prion protein associated with model lipid membranes. We provide evidence that the membrane environment strongly affects, in a pH-dependent manner, the conformational structure and stability of the protein. These findings have important implications for understanding the conversion of PrPC to PrPSc. cDNA coding for huPrP-(23–231), huPrP-(23–145), and huPrP-(90–231) was amplified from a plasmid pVZ21 (25Petersen R.B. Parchi P. Richardson S.L. Ulrig C.B. Gambetti P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12661-12668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) by polymerase chain reaction. The primers used were 5′-CAT GGT GGTGGA TCC GGG TCA AGG AGG and 5′-GAG GAT CGA GCT GAG AAT TCC TCT CCA CCT G for huPrP-(90–231), and 5′-GTG ACC TGG GGG ATC CGA AGA AGC GCC CG and 5′-GAG GAT CGA GCT GAG AAT TCC TCT CCA CCT G for huPrP-(23–231) and huPrP-(23–145). After digestion with BamHI and EcoRI enzymes (sites indicated in bold), the restricted fragments and a double-stranded linker (5′P-CT AGC CTG GTT CCG CGT GGT TCG-3′/5′-P-G ATC CGA ACC ACG CGG AAC CAG G-3′) were ligated into pRSETB vector (Invitrogen) that was predigested with EcoRI andNheI enzymes. The final constructs coded for appropriate huPrP fragments fused to the N-terminal linker containing His6 tail and a thrombin cleavage site. A Gly-Ser-Asp-Pro extension at the N terminus remained after cleavage of the linker. DNA sequences of all constructs were verified by automated DNA sequencing. Protein was expressed and purified essentially as described previously (15Zahn R. von Schroetter C. Wuthrich K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The modifications to the above protocol included different thrombin cleavage conditions of the His tail (1-h treatment at room temperature with 10 units of thrombin/mg protein in 10 mm phosphate, pH 6.4) and subsequent ion exchange chromatography on a CM-Sepharose column using a linear 0–500 mm gradient of NaCl in 10 mm phosphate, pH 6.4. The purity of the final product was better than 98% as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The identity of each protein was further confirmed by mass spectrometry. Protein concentration was determined spectrometrically using the molar extinction coefficient ε280 of 56,795, 21,495, and 43,600 m−1 cm−1 for huPrP-(23–231), huPrP-(90–231), and huPrP-(23–145), respectively. To obtain small unilamellar vesicles, lipid mixture of a desired composition was dissolved in chloroform and dried under a stream of nitrogen. The resulting film of dried lipid was hydrated in an appropriate buffer, vortexed, and finally sonicated on ice for approximately 15 min using a probe-type sonifier. Lysophospholipid micelles were prepared by dissolving the mixture of lysophospholipids in chloroform/methanol/water (4:4:2). After drying under nitrogen, the lipid film was dispersed by vortexing in a desired buffer. Binding of huPrP variants to lipid vesicles was studied at room temperature by fluorescence spectroscopy. For this purpose, small aliquots of concentrated vesicle suspension were successively added to 1.8 μm protein solution in a desired buffer. After each addition of lipid, the solution was thoroughly mixed and left to equilibrate for 5 min. Fluorescence emission spectra were measured on an SLM 8100 spectrofluorometer using a 4-mm cell and an excitation wavelength of 280 nm (huPrP-(23–231) and huPrP-(23–145)) or 295 nm (huPrP-(90–231)). Spectra were corrected for light scattering effect by subtracting lipid blanks in the same buffer. The fluorescence titration curves were analyzed as described previously (26Surewicz W.K. Epand R.M. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6072-6077Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 27Butko P. Huang F. Pusztai-Carey M. Surewicz W.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12862-12868Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), providing an apparent binding constantK d /n, where K d is the dissociation constant of the lipid-protein complex, and n is the number of binding sites per lipid. The ratioK d /n represents the reciprocal of the classic first association constant for the protein-lipid interaction and provides a measure of the overall affinity of a protein to the membrane. Tryptophan fluorescence quenching experiments were performed by titrating the solution of free and membrane-associated proteins with freshly prepared solution of acrylamide. Fluorescence intensities at each acrylamide concentration were measured at the wavelength corresponding to the emission maximum of each protein and corrected for dilution, blanks, and the inner filter effect. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm. Quenching curves were analyzed in terms of the effective Stern-Volmer constantK SV(eff); this effective parameter represents a weighted average of the quenching constants of individual Trp residues and may contain contributions from both dynamic and static quenching processes. K SV(eff values were calculated as described previously (28Etfink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar) from the inverse slope of theF O/ΔF versus1/[Q] plots, where F O andF are the fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of the quencher, respectively, ΔF =F O − F, and [Q] is the molar concentration of acrylamide. The effect of the lipid environment on the secondary structure of huPrP variants was studied by following changes in far UV CD spectra. The measurements were performed at 25 °C using a JASCO-600 spectropolarimeter and a 1-mm path length cell. Typically, six spectra were averaged and smoothed to improve signal to noise ratio. Thermal stability of the free and lipid-associated proteins was studied by following changes in ellipticity at 222 nm as a function of temperature. The measurements were performed using a JASCO-600 spectropolarimeter equipped with a 1-mm water-jacketed cylindrical cell and a computer-controlled water bath. If not mentioned otherwise, the following buffers were used throughout this study: pH 7, 17 mm potassium phosphate; pH 6, 40 mm potassium phosphate; pH 4 and 5, 50 mm sodium acetate. All buffers contained 130 mmNaCl and had a constant ionic strength of 180 mm. Tryptophan residues provide a convenient spectroscopic probe that allows the measurements of protein-membrane binding by fluorescence spectroscopy (26Surewicz W.K. Epand R.M. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6072-6077Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 27Butko P. Huang F. Pusztai-Carey M. Surewicz W.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12862-12868Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The full-length huPrP-(23–231) contains seven tryptophans that are located within the N-terminal portion of the protein (residues 23–99). The fluorescence emission spectrum of huPrP-(23–231) in an aqueous solution (pH range between 4 and 7) has a maximum at 348 nm and is indicative of a highly polar environment of the Trp residues. This is consistent with the NMR structural data showing that the N-terminal region is highly flexible and largely unordered (18Donne D.G. Viles J.H. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. James T.L. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13452-13457Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Incubation of the protein with membrane vesicles consisting solely of zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine (POPC) did not result in any measurable spectral changes, suggesting the lack of protein-membrane interaction. However, the fluorescence spectra changed markedly when the protein was titrated with the vesicles containing acidic phosphatidylserine (POPS). As shown in Fig. 1, upon addition of the vesicles containing the latter phospholipid the emission maximum of huPrP-(23–231) is shifted to a shorter wavelength, and there is an increase in the fluorescence intensity. The observed blue shift reflects the increase in the hydrophobicity of the Trp environment and is indicative of protein binding to the membrane. The representative titration curves obtained at different pH values by measuring changes in the fluorescence intensity or the wavelength of the emission maximum at increasing concentrations of POPC/POPS (2:1) vesicles are shown in Fig. 1. These curves indicate that the interaction between huPrP-(23–231) and phosphatidylserine-containing vesicles is pH-dependent, becoming considerably stronger under acidic conditions. The apparent binding parameters derived from data of Fig. 1 A are shown in Table I.Table IProtein-membrane binding constantspHK d /nhuPrP-(23–231)huPrP-(23–145)huPrP-(90–231)μm7.0605 ± 10592 ± 10No interaction6.0419 ± 2179 ± 8NDaND, not determined.5.0184 ± 4575 ± 1155 ± 44.0109 ± 1642 ± 6NDa ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Binding of huPrP-(23–231) to lipid vesicles was further verified by filtration on a 100-kDa cut-off Microcon membrane (Amicon). Free protein as well as the protein preincubated with POPC vesicles easily passed through the membrane, and all of it was recovered in the filtrate. However, when huPrP-(23–231) was preincubated with the vesicles containing 33 mol % of acidic POPS (at a saturating lipid concentration as assessed from the titration data), essentially all protein, together with the vesicles, was retained on the filter. These data provide independent evidence for the binding of prion protein to acidic lipid-containing vesicles. Furthermore, it confirms the validity of the fluorescence-based approach used in this study. To gain insight into the mechanism of huPrP-(23–231)-membrane interaction, the fluorescence titration experiments were performed using membrane vesicles containing different proportions of acidic phosphatidylserine. As shown in Fig. 2, up to approximately 50 mol % POPS, the binding affinity is strongly dependent on the density of negatively charged lipid in the bilayer. Such behavior suggests that the protein contains multiple binding sites that can combine with acidic lipids (29Mosior M. McLaughlin S. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 149-159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To identify the lipid-interacting region(s) in PrP, binding experiments similar to those described above were performed for prion protein fragments huPrP-(23–145) and huPrP-(90–231). As shown in Fig. 3 A, the N-terminal part 23–145 binds to acidic lipid-containing membranes both at acidic and neutral pH. The apparent membrane affinity of this fragment shows relatively little dependence on pH. In contrast to huPrP-(23–145), the fluorescence spectrum of huPrP-(90–231) at neutral pH remained essentially unchanged in the presence of the vesicles, suggesting the lack of binding to the membrane. Association of the latter protein with POPS-containing vesicles could be detected only at acidic pH. Under such conditions, the emission maximum of Trp-99 in huPrP-(90–231) was shifted to lower wavelength (Fig. 3 B), with little change in the fluorescence intensity. The apparent lipid binding affinities for PrP fragments appear to be higher than those for huPrP-(23–231), suggesting that some of the potential lipid-binding sites may be masked in the full-length protein. It should also be noted that in the presence of huPrP-(23–231) or its fragments there was a time-dependent increase in light scattering by the vesicles, especially at low pH. Although this effect was not explored further in the present study, it suggests that protein binding may induce aggregation and/or fusion of phospholipid vesicles. To characterize further the interaction between the recombinant prion protein variants and membrane lipids, we have used the technique of fluorescence quenching with a polar quencher acrylamide. This approach allows one to assess the exposure of Trp residues in proteins (28Etfink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows representative Stern-Volmer plots for acrylamide quenching of Trp fluorescence of various huPrP variants (huPrP-(23–231), huPrP-(23–145), and huPrP-(90–231)) at pH 5 in the absence and presence of membrane vesicles at a saturating lipid concentration. The effective quenching constants derived from these curves are shown in Table II. TheK SV(eff) values for the free proteins in buffer are in the range of 10–12 m−1 and indicate a complete exposure of Trp residues to water (28Etfink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar). However, the accessibility of all three prion protein variants to acrylamide quenching was markedly reduced in the presence of POPS-containing vesicles, clearly indicating protein binding to the membrane. The extent of the protection from acrylamide quenching as well as the magnitude of the lipid-induced blue shift of λmax(approximately 7 nm) suggest that the protein interacts largely with the membrane surface, with possible penetration into the lipid head group region but not the hydrophobic interior of the bilayer. A similar effect was observed at neutral pH, with the exception that under these conditions very little protection from the quencher was found for huPrP-(90–231) (Table II). These data support the notion that huPrP-(23–231) and huPrP-(23–145) interact with membrane vesicles both at acidic and neutral pH (although with different affinities), whereas the C-terminal region 90–231 shows appreciable affinity for lipids only at acidic pH.Table IIFluorescence quenching constants for prion protein variantsSystemK SV (eff)huPrP-(23–231)huPrP-(23–145)huPrP-(90–231)m −1Protein alone, pH 7.012 ± 0.611.9 ± 0.412.1 ± 0.5Protein + vesicles, pH 7.04.5 ± 0.54.3 ± 0.410.6 ± 0.6Protein alone, pH 5.011 ± 0.410.3 ± 0.511.6 ± 0.6Protein + vesicles, pH 5.04.1 ± 0.44.0 ± 0.53.9 ± 0.5 Open table in a new tab The secondary structure of proteins in a membrane-like environment was studied by CD spectroscopy. To avoid potential distortion of circular dichroism spectra due to light scattering on membrane vesicles, single chain lysophospholipids were used in the CD experiments. Since lysophospholipids form relatively small micellar structures, they produce much less light scattering than phospholipid vesicles. In a series of control fluorescence experiments, it has been verified that the binding characteristics of PrP variants to lysophospholipid micelles are very similar to those described for the corresponding phospholipid membranes (data not shown for brevity). In accord with the previous data (14Horneman S. Korth C. Oesch B. Riek R. Wider G. Wuthrich K. Glockshuber R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), the CD spectrum of huPrP-(23–231) in buffer shows a double minimum at approximately 222 and 208 nm (Fig. 5); this spectrum reflects a largely α-helical structure of the protein. Consistent with the binding data, lyso-PC alone did not have any measurable effect on the protein CD spectrum. However, in the presence of acidic lyso-PS (or a mixture of lyso-PS with lyso-PC), there was an increase in the negative ellipticity above 200 nm and a small increase in the positive ellipticity at lower wavelengths. The above spectral changes (Fig. 5 A) suggest that the lipid environment produces some rearrangement in the backbone conformation of the protein, resulting in an increased proportion of ordered secondary structure. To identify the domain of the protein involved in this conformational transition, CD spectra in the presence and absence of lyso-PS-containing micelles were measured for huPrP-(23–145) and huPrP-(90–231). The spectrum of huPrP-(23–145) in buffer at pH 7 or 5 has a minimum at approximately 197 nm and is characteristic of an essentially random conformation. The lack of ordered secondary structure in the N-terminal region is in accord with the NMR data for hamster and murine PrP (18Donne D.G. Viles J.H. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. James T.L. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13452-13457Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 19Riek R. Hornemann S. Wider G. Glockshuber R. Wuthrich K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Upon addition of lyso-PS-containing micelles, there is a marked increase in the negative ellipticity in the entire region between 200 and 240 nm, and the minimum of the CD spectrum shifts to approximately 205 nm (Fig. 5 B). This indicates that in a lipid environment at least part of the 23–145 region adopts a more ordered conformation. Although the present data are insufficient to characterize fully the molecular nature of this conformational transition, the increase in negative ellipticity between 200 and 240 nm is suggestive that a fragment of huPrP-(23–145) may form α-helix or a β-sheet structure. In contrast to huPrP-(23–231) and huPrP-(23–145), the CD spectrum of the C-terminal domain huPrP-(90–231) remains unchanged upon incubation with lyso-PS-containing micelles (Fig. 5 C). Altogether, these data indicate that the lipid-induced increase in the CD signal of the full-length PrP reflects a conformational change (partial ordering) within the N-terminal region of the protein. The effect of lipid binding on the stability of huPrP-(23–231) was studied by following changes in the ellipticity at 222 nm as a function of temperature (19Riek R. Hornemann S. Wider G. Glockshuber R. Wuthrich K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). In the absence of lipid the protein undergoes a highly cooperative thermal transition, with a midpoint unfolding temperature, T m, of 71.8 and 71.2 °C at pH 7 and 5, respectively (Fig. 6). This transition reflects thermal denaturation of the folded C-terminal domain of prion protein. The unfolding curves remained essentially unchanged in the presence of lyso-PC micelles. However, binding of huPrP-(23–231) to lyso-PS-containing micelles resulted in a structural destabilization of the protein. Although at neutral pH the above effect was relatively small (reduction of T m to 68.8 °C), lipid-induced protein destabilization becomes much more dramatic at pH 5. In the latter case, the apparent midpoint unfolding temperature of huPrP-(23–231) was reduced upon lipid binding to approximately 54 °C, and there was a drastic reduction in the cooperativity of the thermal unfolding (Fig. 6 B). Under the present experimental conditions, the thermal denaturation of the free protein was essentially reversible (recovery of the original CD signal after cooling better than 80%). However, considerably smaller reversibility was found for the protein in a lipid environment. Therefore, no attempt was made to derive thermodynamic parameters from the unfolding curves of Fig. 6. A wealth of data indicate that the key molecular event in the pathogenesis of prion disorders is a conformational change in PrPC, resulting in the conversion of a portion of the protein molecule from an α-helical conformation to a β-sheet-rich, proteinase K-resistant oligomeric structure (1Prusiner S.B.

A critical step toward dissecting the complex mechanism of this conversion reaction is to understand the structural and biophysical properties of PrPC and its folding intermediates. The recombinant prion protein has been recently used as a structural model of PrPC, providing fundamentally important information about the three-dimensional structure of the protein in an aqueous solution (16Riek R.

https://openalex.org/W2001079530,"The expression of many virulence determinants inStaphylococcus aureus including α-hemolysin-, protein A-, and fibronectin-binding proteins is controlled by global regulatory loci such as sar and agr. In addition to controlling target gene expression via agr(e.g. α-hemolysin), the sar locus can also regulate target gene transcription via agr-independent mechanisms. In particular, we have found that SarA, the major regulatory protein encoded within sar, binds to a conserved sequence, homologous to the SarA-binding site on the agrpromoter, upstream of the −35 promoter boxes of several target genes including hla (α-hemolysin gene), spa(protein A gene), fnb (fibronectin-binding protein genes), and sec (enterotoxin C gene). Deletion of the SarA recognition motif in the promoter regions of agr andhla in shuttle plasmids rendered the transcription of these genes undetectable in agr and hla mutants, respectively. Likewise, the transcription activity of spa(a gene normally repressed by sar), as measured by a XylE reporter fusion assay, became derepressed in a wild type strain containing a shuttle plasmid in which the SarA recognition site had been deleted from the spa promoter region. However, DNase I footprinting assays demonstrated that the SarA-binding region on thespa and hla promoter is more extensive than the predicted consensus sequence, thus raising the possibility that the consensus sequence is an activation site within a larger binding region. Because the sar and agr regulate an assortment of virulence factors in S. aureus, we propose, based on our data, a unifying hypothesis for virulence gene activation in S. aureus whereby SarA is a regulatory protein that binds to its consensus SarA recognition motif to activate (e.g. hla) or repress (e.g. spa) the transcription of sar target genes, thus accounting for both agr-dependent andagr-independent mode of regulation.

Crossley K.B. Archer G.L. The Staphylococci in human Diseases. 12. Churchill Livingston, New York1997: 309-329Google Scholar). The capability of S. aureus to cause a multiplicity of infections is probably attributable to the impressive array of extracellular and cell wall-associated virulence determinants produced by this organism (2Projan S.J. Novick R.P. Crossley K.B. Archer G.L. The Molecular Basis of Pathogenicity. 3. Churchill Livingston, New York1997: 55-81Google Scholar). The expression of many virulence determinants in S. aureus is highly coordinated and is generally controlled by global regulatory elements such asagr (accessory generegulator) and sar (staphylococcalaccessory regulator) (3Kornblum J. Kreiswirth B. Projan S.J. Ross H. Novick R.P. Novick R.P. Molecular Biology of the Staphylococcus. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1990: 373-402Google Scholar, 4Cheung A.L. Koomey J.M. Butler C.A. Projan S.J. Fischetti V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6462-6466Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The regulatory elements, in turn, control the transcription of a wide variety of unlinked genes, many of which have been demonstrated to be involved in pathogenesis.The global regulatory locus agr consists of two divergent transcripts, RNAII and RNAIII, initiated from two distinct promoters, P2 and P3, respectively. RNAIII is the effector molecule of theagr response and hence is responsible for the up-regulation of extracellular protein production and down-regulation of cell wall-associated protein synthesiss during the postexponential phase (3Kornblum J. Kreiswirth B. Projan S.J. Ross H. Novick R.P. Novick R.P. Molecular Biology of the Staphylococcus. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1990: 373-402Google Scholar). The RNAII molecule, driven by the P2 promoter, encodes a four gene operon, agrBDCA. AgrC and AgrA correspond to the sensor and activator proteins of two component regulatory systems, respectively. Additionally, agrD, in concert with agrB, participates in the generation of an octapeptide with quorum sensing properties (5Ji G. Beavis R.C. Novick R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12055-12059Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 6Ji G. Beavis R. Novick R.P. Science. 1997; 276: 2027-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Accordingly, AgrC, upon sensing a critical extracellular concentration of the octapeptide, becomes phosphorylated and activates AgrA by a second phosphorylation step. Activated AgrA would then, presumably, stimulate the transcription of theagr regulatory molecule RNAIII, which ultimately interacts with target genes to modulate transcription (7Novick R.P.

Kornblum J. Kreiswirth B. Moghazeh S. EMBO. J. 1993; 12: 3967-3977Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar) and possibly translation (9Morfeldt E. Taylor D. von Gabain A. Arvidson S. EMBO. J. 1995; 14: 4569-4577Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar).Another regulatory locus, designated sar, was uncovered in our laboratory (4Cheung A.L. Koomey J.M. Butler C.A. Projan S.J. Fischetti V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6462-6466Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Unlike agr, the sar locus activates the synthesis of both extracellular (e.g.hemolysins) and cell wall proteins (e.g. fibronectin-binding protein) in S. aureus (4Cheung A.L. Koomey J.M. Butler C.A. Projan S.J. Fischetti V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6462-6466Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The sar locus, contained within a 1.2-kb1fragment, is composed of three overlapping transcripts designated sarA (0.56 kb), sarC (0.8 kb), and sarB (1.2 kb). These transcripts, all encoding the major 372-bp sarA open reading frame, have common 3′ ends but originate from three distinct promoters (10Bayer M.G. Heinrichs J.H. Cheung A.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4563-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Transcription and gel shift studies (11Cheung A.L. Bayer M.G. Heinrichs J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3963-3971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Chien Y. Cheung A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2645-2652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) revealed that the SarA protein preferentially binds to the P2-, and to a lesser extent, to the P3-agr promoter region, thereby augmenting RNAII and the ensuing RNAIII transcription. RNAIII would then modulate the transcription of sar target genes (e.g. hla). More recently, we demonstrated that the SarA protein level is an important determinant of agr activation (13Chien Y.T. Manna A.C. Cheung A.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 31: 991-1001Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In particular, the sequence upstream of the sarA gene may play a role in modulating the translation of the sarA gene product, the level of which correlates with agr expression (13Chien Y.T. Manna A.C. Cheung A.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 31: 991-1001Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, phenotypic and transcriptional analyses suggest that thesar locus can also regulate target gene transcription via a SarA-dependent but agr-independent mechanism. Supporting this notion is the observation that the synthesis of β-hemolysin was further reduced in a doublesar/agr mutant as compared with the singleagr mutant (14Cheung A.L. Ying P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 580-585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Cheung A.L. Eberhardt K.J. Chung E. Yeaman M.R. Sullam P.M. Ramos M. Bayer A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1815-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Additionally, a recent report by Chan and Foster (16Chan P.F. Foster S.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6232-6241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) provided evidence that SarA may up-regulate α-hemolysin production independently of agr. Thesar locus, contrary to agr, is apparently a repressor of (V8) protease activity (16Chan P.F. Foster S.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6232-6241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these data imply that SarA, the major sar effector molecule, may somehow interact directly with sar target genes (e.g. α hemolysin) as well as with intermediate regulatory molecules such as that of agr to control gene expression.We have analyzed the SarA protein/agr promoter-DNA complex by DNase I footprinting assay (12Chien Y. Cheung A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2645-2652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The SarA-binding site on theagr promoter, as mapped by this method, covers a 29-bp sequence, more proximal to P2, in the P2 and P3 interpromoter region. In this report, we demonstrate that the SarA-binding site on theagr promoter appears to constitute a conserved SarA recognition motif found in many of the sar target genes inS. aureus including hla (α-hemolysin gene),spa (protein A gene), and fnb(fibronectin-binding protein genes). This concept was supported by data from gel shift assays using purified recombinant SarA and synthetic oligonucleotides encompassing the putative SarA recognition site. Similarly, DNase I footprinting assays with hla andspa promoter fragments and purified SarA protein also uncovered binding sites encompassing the putative SarA recognition site. A deletion of the consensus binding site, as found in the promoter regions of agr, hla, and spa, rendered the target genes unresponsive to sar regulation. Because the region of SarA binding on the hla andspa promoters, as determined by footprinting assays, was wider than the consensus binding sites, our data strongly support the existence of a common “effector” site among a larger binding region to which SarA binds in sar target genes. We propose that the binding of SarA to a common recognition motif in target genes alters (i.e. activates or represses, depending on the target) the transcription of these genes in S. aureus, thus explaining both agr-dependent andagr-independent modes of regulation by sar. Because the sar locus controls the expression of a variety of extracellular and cell wall-associated virulence determinants inS. aureus, the identification of a common regulatory pathway may provide clues to the development of novel antimicrobial strategies.DISCUSSIONThe control of expression of virulence determinants by thesar locus in S. aureus is complex, in part because the major 372-bp open reading frame (sarA) withinsar is driven by a triple promoter system that is interspersed with putative regulatory elements (10Bayer M.G. Heinrichs J.H. Cheung A.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4563-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 11Cheung A.L. Bayer M.G. Heinrichs J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3963-3971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Chien Y. Cheung A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2645-2652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Because of their overlapping nature, each of these transcripts (sarA, sarC, and sarB transcripts) also includes the sarA coding region (10Bayer M.G. Heinrichs J.H. Cheung A.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4563-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). With the promoters for the sarA and sarB transcripts being ςA-dependent (active during the exponential phase) (10Bayer M.G. Heinrichs J.H. Cheung A.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4563-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar,28Manna A.C. Bayer M.G. Cheung A.L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3828-3836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that of sarC being ςB-dependent (active during the postexponential phase) (28Manna A.C. Bayer M.G. Cheung A.L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3828-3836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Deora R. Tseng T. Misra T.K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6355-6359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is not surprising thatsar transcription varies during the growth cycle. Dependent on the pattern of sar promoter activation, the SarA level may conceivably fluctuate (12Chien Y. Cheung A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2645-2652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 28Manna A.C. Bayer M.G. Cheung A.L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3828-3836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ultimately, the level of SarA correlates positively with the degree of agr expression (13Chien Y.T. Manna A.C. Cheung A.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 31: 991-1001Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar).We previously showed that the SarA protein binds to the agrpromoter region, presumably stimulating transcription, in particular, from the agr P2 promoter (11Cheung A.L. Bayer M.G. Heinrichs J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3963-3971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of RNAII and, subsequently, RNAIII would lead to alterations in target gene expression (e.g. hla and spa), presumably by virtue of the interaction of RNAIII with the target gene at the level of transcription (8Novick R.P. Ross H.F. Projan S.J. Kornblum J. Kreiswirth B. Moghazeh S. EMBO. J. 1993; 12: 3967-3977Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 27Patel A.H. Kornblum J. Kreiswirth B. Novick R. Foster T.J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 114: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and possibly translation (9Morfeldt E. Taylor D. von Gabain A. Arvidson S. EMBO. J. 1995; 14: 4569-4577Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). However, phenotypic analyses indicated that SarA can also modulate target genes via an agr-independent mechanism. In particular, the transcription of the fibronectin-binding gene (fnbA) is positively regulated by sar via anagr-independent mechanism (30Cheung A.L. Wolz C. Abstracts of the 37th Annual Meeting of ICAAC, Toronto, September, 1997. Am. Soc. Microbiol., Washington, D. C.1997Google Scholar).3 Likewise, supplying the sar locus in trans can repressspa transcription in an agr mutant. Additionally, recent data from Chan and Foster (16Chan P.F. Foster S.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6232-6241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also disclosed thatsar may up-regulate hla transcription via bothagr-dependent and agr-independent pathways. These three diverse modes of sar-mediated regulation of target genes (i.e. fnb,spa and hla) strongly imply that SarA may directly interact with target gene promoters, with or without any involvement from the agr gene product. In mapping the 29-bp SarA-binding site on the agr promoter with in vitro footprinting assay (12Chien Y. Cheung A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2645-2652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), we explored the sequence upstream of the −35 promoter boxes of several virulence determinants representative of the three putative modes of sar-mediated regulation via a common sequence motif. Interestingly, a consensus sequence sharing a homology with the SarA-binding site on theagr promoter emerged (Fig. 1). In a recent study, Chan and Foster (16Chan P.F. Foster S.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6232-6241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) had also aligned the promoter sequence upstream of severalsar target genes including hla, hlb, tst, seb, spa, and spr (V8 protease gene). However, the data of Chan and Foster are not in agreement with the sequences displayed here (Fig. 1), partly because their alignment was based solely on comparing stretches of nucleotide sequences that are extremely AT-rich (86%) and lacked any supporting biological or biochemical data. Additionally, the transcription start site of the hla gene is upstream of the published sequence (accession number X01645) (31Gray G.S. Kehoe M. Infect. Immun. 1984; 46: 615-618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar),2 thus rendering their alignment problematic. To confirm the validity of our alignment, gel shift assays of SarA and GST-SarA with ∼45-bp oligonucleotide probes encompassing the putative SarA recognition motif of spa,fnb, hla, and sec were performed. Our results demonstrated that SarA did indeed bind to these probes whereas the control nifH2 fragment and an unrelated fragment from the β-hemolysin gene did not. Additional confirmation of the SarA recognition motif in the hla and spa promoter regions was obtained by DNase I footprinting. Surprisingly, the protected region as revealed by the footprinting assay was larger than the SarA recognition motif, thus suggesting either multiple binding sites or a complex conformational requirement for binding (discussed below).Cognizant of the AT-rich nature of our consensus sequence (95% AT), it was important to rule out the possibility that the SarA recognition motif may be an UP element the absence of which would lead to defective binding by core RNA polymerase and hence reduce target gene transcription (26Ross W. Gosink K.K. Salomon J. Igarashi K. Zou C. Ishihama A. Severinov K. Gourse R.L. Science. 1993; 262: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). More importantly, it will be essential to examine the role of this recognition motif in vivo (in the bacteria). For this reason, we chose to delete the SarA recognition motif in the promoter region of spa, a gene normally repressed by the sar locus and examine the resultantspa promoter activation. Using a xylE reporter fusion to generate quantitative data from a clone derived from the parental strain (ALC1795), we found that in the absence of the recognition motif, the transcription of spa in this staphylococcal strain became derepressed, thus resulting in significant up-regulation in XylE activity. This enhancement effect inspa transcription attributable to a lack of a SarA recognition site was completely abolished in a S. aureus sarmutant (ALC1667). Taken together, these data clearly indicated that the SarA recognition motif, present in a variety of sar target genes including hla and spa, is probably not an UP element and, in the absence of SarA or its binding motif,sar-mediated regulation (both up and down-regulation) will not occur.In deleting the consensus SarA-binding site on the agr andhla promoters, we verified that this recognition motif is likely required for SarA binding and the ensuing activation of these genes in S. aureus. This observation was confirmed by Northern blots in which we found that the SarA recognition motif upstream of the hla and agr promoters was required for gene activation in vivo in the respectivehla and agr mutant clones, respectively. We also found in vitro that a 160-bp hla promoter fragment lacking the SarA-binding site was still able to maintain SarA binding, albeit at a lower affinity than the 192-bp nonmutated counterpart (data not shown). Similarly, a spa promoter fragment devoid of the SarA recognition motif also binds to SarA with lower affinity than the intact control (Fig. 5 C). Despite variable levels of binding in vitro by all promoter fragments to SarA in gel shift assays (Fig. 5 C), only the intact spa promoter and its analogous counterpart lacking an unrelated AT-rich region were amenable to repression in vivoin a sar-positive strain (ALC1796) but not in asar minus background (ALC1668), whereas a spapromoter fragment missing the SarA recognition motif was not repressible in either genetic background (see ALC1795 and ALC1667 in Fig. 5 B). This discrepancy in binding and effector activity implies that only the conserved SarA-binding sequence represents the effector site in vivo among a broader binding region(s) within the promoter regions of spa and hla as determined by DNase I footprinting assay in vitro (Fig. 3 B).SarA, the major sar effector molecule, is thus capable of modulating the transcription of multiple target genes, thus accounting for its pleiotropic effects in S. aureus. Prior in vitro data clearly establish that SarA can bind to theagr promoter region to influence primarily agr-P2 transcription. Besides the indirect control via agr, the mechanism by which SarA directly up-regulates (e.g. hla) and down-regulates target genes (e.g. spa) has not been previously defined. In identifying a SarA recognition motif among the promoters of sar target genes, we presented a unifying hypothesis whereby SarA can modulate a variety of target genes via both agr-dependent andagr-independent pathways. The SarA recognition motif likely represents the sar-responsive element of the target gene. Accordingly, activation or repression of target gene promoters is dependent on the binding of SarA to the consensus binding site. In the case of hla, it is evident that this gene can be turned on by a double switch mechanism (via agr and by direct SarA binding to the hla promoter). Because the protected region identified by DNase I footprinting is wider than the SarA recognition motif, we propose that the promoters of target genes contain multiple bindings sites, but the SarA recognition motif by itself probably represents the effector (activation/suppression) site. Whether the expansive binding site serves as binding regions for regulatory factors other than SarA (e.g. RNAIII) is not clear. Depending on the threshold of activation, the level of SarA protein may ultimately determine the pattern of regulation of SarA-responsive genes inS. aureus. Because of the multiplicity of sarpromoters with diverse activation requirements (e.g. sarC activated by SigB) (28Manna A.C. Bayer M.G. Cheung A.L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3828-3836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Deora R. Tseng T. Misra T.K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6355-6359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the precise control of SarA protein levels as a result of differential sar promoter activation is likely to be dependent on a variety of environmental and intracellular factors. Notably, we recently identified a regulatory protein that binds to the sar promoter region to down-regulate sarC transcription (28Manna A.C. Bayer M.G. Cheung A.L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3828-3836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).3 Characterization of this protein and its effect on SarA expression are currently in progress. Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of human infections ranging from superficial abscesses, pneumonia, and endocarditis to sepsis (1Boyce J.M. Crossley K.B. Archer G.L. The Staphylococci in human Diseases. 12. Churchill Livingston, New York1997: 309-329Google Scholar). The capability of S. aureus to cause a multiplicity of infections is probably attributable to the impressive array of extracellular and cell wall-associated virulence determinants produced by this organism (2Projan S.J. Novick R.P. Crossley K.B. Archer G.L. The Molecular Basis of Pathogenicity. 3. Churchill Livingston, New York1997: 55-81Google Scholar). The expression of many virulence determinants in S. aureus is highly coordinated and is generally controlled by global regulatory elements such asagr (accessory generegulator) and sar (staphylococcalaccessory regulator) (3Kornblum J. Kreiswirth B. Projan S.J. Ross H. Novick R.P. Novick R.P. Molecular Biology of the Staphylococcus. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1990: 373-402Google Scholar, 4Cheung A.L. Koomey J.M. Butler C.A. Projan S.J. Fischetti V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6462-6466Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The regulatory elements, in turn, control the transcription of a wide variety of unlinked genes, many of which have been demonstrated to be involved in pathogenesis. The global regulatory locus agr consists of two divergent transcripts, RNAII and RNAIII, initiated from two distinct promoters, P2 and P3, respectively. RNAIII is the effector molecule of theagr response and hence is responsible for the up-regulation of extracellular protein production and down-regulation of cell wall-associated protein synthesiss during the postexponential phase (3Kornblum J. Kreiswirth B. Projan S.J. Ross H. Novick R.P. Novick R.P. Molecular Biology of the Staphylococcus. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1990: 373-402Google Scholar). The RNAII molecule, driven by the P2 promoter, encodes a four gene operon, agrBDCA. AgrC and AgrA correspond to the sensor and activator proteins of two component regulatory systems, respectively. Additionally, agrD, in concert with agrB, participates in the generation of an octapeptide with quorum sensing properties (5Ji G. Beavis R.C. Novick R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12055-12059Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 6Ji G. Beavis R. Novick R.P. Science. 1997; 276: 2027-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Accordingly, AgrC, upon sensing a critical extracellular concentration of the octapeptide, becomes phosphorylated and activates AgrA by a second phosphorylation step. Activated AgrA would then, presumably, stimulate the transcription of theagr regulatory molecule RNAIII, which ultimately interacts with target genes to modulate transcription (7Novick R.P.

J. 1995; 14: 4569-4577Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Another regulatory locus, designated sar, was uncovered in our laboratory (4Cheung A.L. Koomey J.M. Butler C.A. Projan S.J. Fischetti V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6462-6466Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Unlike agr, the sar locus activates the synthesis of both extracellular (e.g.hemolysins) and cell wall proteins (e.g. fibronectin-binding protein) in S. aureus (4Cheung A.L. Koomey J.M. Butler C.A. Projan S.J. Fischetti V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6462-6466Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The sar locus, contained within a 1.2-kb1fragment, is composed of three overlapping transcripts designated sarA (0.56 kb), sarC (0.8 kb), and sarB (1.2 kb). These transcripts, all encoding the major 372-bp sarA open reading frame, have common 3′ ends but originate from three distinct promoters (10Bayer M.G. Heinrichs J.H. Cheung A.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4563-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Transcription and gel shift studies (11Cheung A.L. Bayer M.G. Heinrichs J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3963-3971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Chien Y. Cheung A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2645-2652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) revealed that the SarA protein preferentially binds to the P2-, and to a lesser extent, to the P3-agr promoter region, thereby augmenting RNAII and the ensuing RNAIII transcription. RNAIII would then modulate the transcription of sar target genes (e.g. hla). More recently, we demonstrated that the SarA protein level is an important determinant of agr activation (13Chien Y.T. Manna A.C. Cheung A.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 31: 991-1001Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In particular, the sequence upstream of the sarA gene may play a role in modulating the translation of the sarA gene product, the level of which correlates with agr expression (13Chien Y.T. Manna A.C. Cheung A.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 31: 991-1001Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, phenotypic and transcriptional analyses suggest that thesar locus can also regulate target gene transcription via a SarA-dependent but agr-independent mechanism. Supporting this notion is the observation that the synthesis of β-hemolysin was further reduced in a doublesar/agr mutant as compared with the singleagr mutant (14Cheung A.L. Ying P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 580-585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Cheung A.L. Eberhardt K.J. Chung E. Yeaman M.R. Sullam P.M. Ramos M. Bayer A.S. J. Clin.

We have hypothesized that the absence of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) in LCAT-Tg mice facilitates the accumulation of dysfunctional HDL leading to impaired reverse cholesterol transport and the development of a pro-atherogenic state. To test this hypothesis we cross-bred LCAT-Tg with CETP-Tg mice. On both regular chow and high fat, high cholesterol diets, expression of CETP in LCAT-Tg mice reduced total cholesterol (−39% and −13%, respectively; p < 0.05), reflecting a decrease in HDL cholesterol levels. CETP normalized both the plasma clearance of [3H]cholesteryl esters ([3H]CE) from HDL (fractional catabolic rate in days−1: LCAT-Tg = 3.7 ± 0.34, LCATxCETP-Tg = 6.1 ± 0.16, and controls = 6.4 ± 0.16) as well as the liver uptake of [3H]CE from HDL (LCAT-Tg = 36%, LCATxCETP-Tg = 65%, and controls = 63%) in LCAT-Tg mice. On the pro-atherogenic diet the mean aortic lesion area was reduced by 41% in LCATxCETP-Tg (21.2 ± 2.0 μm2 × 103) compared with LCAT-Tg mice (35.7 ± 2.0 μm2 × 103;p < 0.001). Adenovirus-mediated expression of scavenger receptor class B (SR-BI) failed to normalize the plasma clearance and liver uptake of [3H]CE from LCAT-Tg HDL. Thus, the ability of SR-BI to facilitate the selective uptake of CE from LCAT-Tg HDL is impaired, indicating a potential mechanism leading to impaired reverse cholesterol transport and atherosclerosis in these animals. We conclude that CETP expression reduces atherosclerosis in LCAT-Tg mice by restoring the functional properties of LCAT-Tg mouse HDL and promoting the hepatic uptake of HDL-CE. These findings provide definitive in vivo evidence supporting the proposed anti-atherogenic role of CETP in facilitating HDL-mediated reverse cholesterol transport and demonstrate that CETP expression is beneficial in pro-atherogenic states that result from impaired reverse cholesterol transport.

HDL has also been proposed to play a major role in reverse cholesterol transport, a process that involves the movement of cholesterol from peripheral cells to the liver for removal from the body (16Glomset J.A.

Thus, raising plasma HDL by dietary, pharmacologic, or genetic interventions may be an effective strategy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in humans. Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) and lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) are two key proteins that modulate the plasma concentrations of HDL.

CETP is another key protein that modulates the plasma levels of HDL. CETP promotes the transfer of CE from HDL to apoB-containing lipoproteins in exchange for triglyceride (19Fielding C.J.

Nature. 1993; 364: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) provided support for the initial hypothesis that CETP was a “pro-atherogenic” factor. A recent study demonstrating that infusion of CETP antisense oligonucleotides in cholesterol-fed rabbits inhibited atherosclerosis provided further support for this concept (35Sugano M. Makino N.

However, large population-based studies in Honolulu (36Zhong S. Sharp D.S. Grove J.S. Bruce C. Yano K. Curb J.D. Tall A.R. J. Clin.

The conflicting data regarding the role of CETP in atherosclerosis that has emerged from these combined studies probably reflect the intricate balance between the pro- and anti-atherogenic properties of CETP. CETP activity leads to decreased plasma levels of HDL cholesterol (34Marotti K.R. Castle C.K. Boyle T.P. Lin A.H. Murray R.W. Melchior G.W.

Nature. 1993; 364: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), a lipoprotein profile that may promote atherogenesis. However, CETP can also promote dissociation of apoA-I from HDL, generating pre-β-HDL particles (39Kunitake S.T. Mendel C.M. Hennessy L.K. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1807-1816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Newnham H.H. Barter P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), which together with the enhanced transport of CE to triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, may facilitate reverse cholesterol transport. We have previously reported that the increased susceptibility of LCAT-Tg mice to development of atherosclerosis is due, at least in part, to the presence of dysfunctional HDL, which leads to delayed hepatic delivery of HDL-CE (26Berard A.M. Remaley A.T. Vaisman B.L. Paigen B. Hoyt Jr., R.F. Meyn S.M. Talley G.D. Allen D. Albers J. Marcovina S. Brewer Jr., H.B. Santamarina-Fojo S. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 744-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Thus, LCAT-Tg mice represent an animal model with enhanced atherosclerosis susceptibility due primarily to impaired reverse cholesterol transport (26Berard A.M. Remaley A.T. Vaisman B.L. Paigen B. Hoyt Jr., R.F. Meyn S.M. Talley G.D. Allen D. Albers J. Marcovina S. Brewer Jr., H.B. Santamarina-Fojo S. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 744-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In contrast to rabbits, mice lack CETP, resulting in major differences in the metabolism of HDL between the two animal models. We have hypothesized that deficiency of CETP plays a major role in promoting a pro-atherogenic state of LCAT-Tg mice by impairing the hepatic delivery of HDL-CE. To test this hypothesis we cross-bred human LCAT-Tg mice with simian CETP-Tg mice and analyzed the lipoprotein profile, the metabolic properties of HDL, and development of aortic lesions. LCAT-Tg mice (i) have decreased plasma HDL concentrations, ii) normalize the plasma clearance and hepatic uptake of CE from LCAT-Tg mouse HDL, and iii) show reduced development of aortic atherosclerosis by 41%. Our findings demonstrate that CETP corrects the functional abnormalities in LCAT-Tg mouse HDL and reduces the susceptibility of this animal model for atherosclerosis. These data provide new in vivo evidence establishing the proposed role of CETP in reverse cholesterol transport and demonstrate that by facilitating hepatic cholesterol delivery, CETP can reduce atherosclerosis in this animal model. The presence or absence of CETP is a key factor in determining the atherogenic consequences of LCAT expression. Human LCAT-Tg mice containing either 120 or 240 copies of the human transgene (22Vaisman B.L. Klein H.-G. Rouis M. Berard A.M. Kindt M.R. Talley G.D. Meyn S.M. Hoyt Jr., R.F. Marcovina S.M.

Human LCAT-Tg, simian CETP-Tg, and LCATxCETP-Tg mice were generated and propagated on a C57BL/6 genetic background. All mice used in the diet studies were female, 2.5–4.5 months of age, housed at the National Institutes of Health under protocols approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and fed a regular chow diet (NIH-07 chow diet 5% fat; Zeigler Brothers Inc., Gardners, PA). For the study, mice were maintained for 16 weeks on a high fat high cholesterol diet that contained 15% fat (ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids = 0.69), 1.25% cholesterol, and 0.5% cholic acid. Blood samples from the retroorbital plexus were obtained from mice fasted for 4 h and anesthetized with methoxyflurane (Pitman-Moore, Mundelein, IL); the blood samples were placed into precooled tubes containing EDTA (final concentration 4 mm) and centrifuged at 2500 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and aliquots of plasma were stored at −70 °C. Cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids, free cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol levels were determined previously described (41Kashyap V.S. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brown D.R. Parrott C.L.

Mouse apoB was quantitated by nephelometry using polyclonal antibodies raised against purified mouse apoB. Pooled mice plasma was used as standard. Plasma lipoproteins from either individual mice or from pooled mouse plasma were separated by gel filtration using two Superose 6 HR 10/30 columns connected in series (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Lipoproteins were eluted at a constant flow rate of 0.3 ml/min with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.02% EDTA and 0.04% sodium azide. For visualization of apolipoproteins by immunoblot, 20 μl of pooled fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) fractions were separated on a 4–20% Tris-glycine gel (Novex, San Diego, CA) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride microporous membranes (Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride; Millipore, Bedford, MA). Mouse apoA-I, apoE, and apoB were identified by blotting with polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse IgG raised against the purified apolipoproteins and visualized by a biotinylated secondary antibody (Vectastain ABC kit; Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). Two-dimensional electrophoresis of plasma lipoproteins was performed as described previously (43Asztalos B.F. Sloop C.H. Wong L. Roheim P.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1169: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Plasma lipoproteins were also analyzed by native agarose gel electrophoresis on Titan Gels (Helena Laboratories, Beaumont, Texas) according to the manufacturer's instructions. α-LCAT activity against an exogenous substrate of proteoliposomes was determined as described previously (44Chen C.H. Albers J.J. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 680-691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CETP activity in plasma was measured as described previously (45Tollefson J.H. Albers J.J.

Zilversmit D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11992-11995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Liposomes were incubated with HDL (density, 1.063–1.21 g/ml, 3 mg of total protein) and density > 1.21 serum (30 mg of total protein) from C57BL/6, LCAT-Tg, and LCATxCETP-Tg mice for 18 h at 37 °C. Labeled HDL were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation at 1.063 and 1.21 g/ml density in a TLA-100.2 rotor using a TL-100 Ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments). HDL derived from either C57BL/6, LCAT-Tg, or LCATxCETP-Tg mice were labeled with [3H]cholesterylpalmityl ether, and 1 million dpm of labeled HDL were injected into the saphenous veins of C57BL/6, LCAT-Tg, and LCATxCETP-Tg mice, respectively. Plasma decay curves were generated by dividing the plasma radioactivity at each time point by the plasma radioactivity at the initial 1-min time point, which was similar between the study groups. Fractional catabolic rate (FCR) was determined from the area under the plasma radioactivity curves using a multiexponential curve-fitting technique on the SAAM program (47Berman M. Weiss M. SAAM Manual. DHEW Publication No. (NIH) 78:180. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1978Google Scholar). After the 120-min blood sample was collected, a subset of mice injected with [3H]cholesterylpalmityl ether-labeled HDL was perfused with cold 0.15 m NaCl. Livers were harvested and extracted in 20 volumes of chloroform-methanol 2:1 (v/v), phases were separated by the addition of water (48Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and aliquots of the lower (organic) phase were counted in a Tri-Carb 2500 TR liquid scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co.).

Specific 5′ and 3′ oligonucleotides containing NotI restriction sites (5′-TGCGAGCCGCGGGGCGGCCGCAGGCG-3′ and 5′-TGTGGGGCTGGGCGGCCGCCTGCTGGGAG-3′) were synthesized on a 380B DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Polymerase chain reaction was performed in an automated DNA thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer) using DNA polymerase from Pyrococcus furiosus(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Full-length human SR-BI was subcloned into the unique NotI site of the shuttle vector pAd12 (52McKinnon R.D. Bacchetti S. Graham F.L. Gene. 1982; 19: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), containing the cytomegalovirus promoter and enhancer as well as the SV40 polyadenylation signal. The recombinant adenoviruses were generated after cotransfection of pAd12 and pJM17 (Ad5 genome) in human embryonal kidney 293 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) as previously reported (53McGrory W.J. Bautista D.S. Graham F.L. Virology. 1988; 163: 614-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 54Harrison T. Graham F.L. Williams J. Virol. 1977; 77: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The recombinant adenoviral vectors, designated rLucif-AdV and rSRBI-AdV, were stored frozen at −70 °C. Before infusion into animals, the recombinant adenovirus was titered and diluted in 0.2% mouse albumin (Sigma). Mice were injected with either control rLucif-AdV (2 × 108plaque-forming units) or rSRBI-AdV (2 × 108plaque-forming units) via the saphenous vein. After a 4-h fast, mice were anesthetized with methoxyflurane (Metofane) (Pitman-Moore, Mundelein, IL), and blood samples were collected from the retroorbital plexus before (day 0) and after (days 2, 4, and 5) recombinant adenovirus infusion. Blood samples were centrifuged at 2500 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The plasma was removed, divided into aliquots, immediately frozen on dry ice, and stored at −70 °C. Metabolic studies were performed by injecting [3H]cholesterylpalmityl ether-labeled HDL as described above on day 5 after rSRBI-AdV or rLucif-AdV infusion. Livers (0.5 g wet weight) from sham-injected control mice (day 0) as well as LCAT-Tg and control C57/Bl mice injected with either rLucif-AdV or rSRBI-AdV (day 5) were harvested, cut into small pieces, and immediately suspended (1:10 weight/volume (g/ml) in a protease inhibitor mixture buffer containing phosphate-buffered saline, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A and l μg/nl leupeptin hemisulfate (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) as well as 400 μg/ml 4-(aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (AEBF; ICN, Aurora, OH). The liver suspension was homogenized and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then re-centrifuged in a TI-60 rotor at 40,000 rpm using an L8–70M Ultracentrifuge (Beckman) for 1 h at 4 °C. Pellets were resuspended in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer that contained 1% β-mercaptoethanol or 0.1 mdithiothreitol and 5 mm bromphenol blue. Protein concentrations were determined with the BCA protein reagent (Pierce). Liver homogenates (10 μg) were electrophoresed on a 4–12% Bis-Tris denaturing NuPAGE gel (Novex) and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) using the Xcell II apparatus (Novex). Membranes were incubated with a polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse SR-BI antibody (kindly supplied by Dr. Susan Acton, Millennium Corp.) that reacts with both murine and human forms of SR-BI, followed by incubation with biotin-conjugated, goat anti-rabbit antibody (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). SR-BI was visualized using the Vectastain kit (Vector Labs). Densitometric scanning was performed using the Molecular Dynamics personal densitometer, model number PDSI-486 (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Values are presented as the mean ± S.E. Comparisons between groups of mice were made using the Student's t test for independent samples (two-tailed). To evaluate the effect of CETP expression on plasma lipoproteins and atherosclerosis in LCAT-Tg mice, we compared LCAT-Tg with LCATxCETP-Tg mice. Data on CETP-Tg and control mice are provided for reference purposes. As expected, LCAT activity (nmol/ml/h) was increased in LCAT-Tg and LCATxCETP-Tg mice (3781 ± 512 and 3124 ± 535, respectively) compared with CETP-Tg and controls (22 ± 3 and 22 ± 3, respectively; all p < 0.001, Table I). Although there was no significant difference in the LCAT activity between the two LCAT-expressing animal study groups, CETP activity was increased in LCATxCETP-Tg compared with CETP-Tg mice: 163 ± 13versus 126 ± 9%/5 μl/18 h, respectively (p < 0.05, Table I).Table ILCAT activity, CETP activity, and plasma lipids in LCAT-Tg, CETP-Tg, LCATxCETP-Tg, and control mice on a regular chow dietMiceLCATCETPTCTGPLCEHDL-CApoA-IApoBApoELCAT-Tg (n = 49)3781 ± 512ap < 0.001 (compared with controls).,bp < 0.01 (compared with CETP-Tg).0221 ± 7a,b,c66 ± 3bp < 0.01 (compared with CETP-Tg).,dp < 0.01 (compared with LCATxCETP-Tg).218 ± 6 a,b,c173 ± 6 a,b,c177 ± 10 a,b,c91 ± 9 e,f,b27 ± 36 ± 1 e,b,fCETP-Tg (n = 27)22 ± 3cp < 0.001 (compared with LCATxCETP-Tg).126 ± 9fp < 0.05 (compared with LCATxCETP-Tg).64 ± 2ap < 0.001 (compared with controls).,cp < 0.001 (compared with LCATxCETP-Tg).83 ± 6ep < 0.05 (compared with controls).,cp < 0.001 (compared with LCATxCETP-Tg).109 ± 3ap < 0.001 (compared with controls).,cp < 0.001 (compared with LCATxCETP-Tg).55 ± 2ap < 0.001 (compared with controls).,cp < 0.001 (compared with LCATxCETP-Tg).43 ± 3cp < 0.001 (compared with LCATxCETP-Tg).,ep < 0.05 (compared with controls).50 ± 129 ± 23 ± 1LCATxCETP-Tg (n = 25)3124 ± 535ap < 0.001 (compared with controls).,bp < 0.01 (compared with CETP-Tg).163 ± 13134 ± 5ap < 0.001 (compared with controls).,bp < 0.01 (compared with CETP-Tg).54 ± 3ep < 0.05 (compared with controls).161 ± 4103 ± 6ap < 0.001 (compared with controls).87 ± 3ap < 0.0"

We investigated the intrinsic transcriptional activity of TGIF fused to a heterologous DNA-binding domain. Our results demonstrate that TGIF is a transcriptional repressor able to repress transcription from several different promoters. Repression by TGIF is insensitive to the distance at which it is bound from the promoter. Moreover, the wild type TGIF effectively represses transcription when bound to its cognate DNA-binding site via its homeodomain. Deletion analysis revealed the presence of at least two separable repression domains within TGIF. Repression by one of these is dependent on the activity of histone deacetylases (HDACs), whereas the other appears not to require HDAC activity. Finally, we demonstrate that TGIF interacts with HDACs via its carboxyl-terminal repression domain. Together, these results suggest that TGIF is a multifunctional transcriptional repressor, which acts in part by recruiting HDAC activity.

Thus, the homeodomain proteins HoxB1 and Pbx1 have been shown to bind to DNA together, and they interact with each other primarily via helices one and two (5Piper D.E. Batchelor A.H. Chang C.-P. Cleary M.L. Wolberger C. Cell. 1999; 96: 587-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In addition, the interaction of homeodomain proteins with components of the basal transcription machinery has also been shown to be mediated via the amino-terminal part of the homeodomain (6Schnabel C.A. Abate-Shen C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2678-2688Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 7Zhang H. Catron K.M. Abate-Shen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1764-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Homeodomain proteins can be grouped into multiple subfamilies, based on such criteria as the primary sequence of the homeodomain, their flanking sequences, and organization into gene clusters (1Gehring W.J. Affolter M. Burglin T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 487-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). One subfamily of homeobox genes encodes proteins with an atypical homeodomain referred to as TALE (for three-amino acid loop extension) homeodomains (8Bertolino E. Reimund B. Wildt-Perinic D.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4173-4180Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). This class of proteins has a three-amino acid loop between helices one and two of the homeodomain. This insertion does not appear to affect DNA binding but may play a role in determining specific interactions with other transcription factors (5Piper D.E. Batchelor A.H. Chang C.-P. Cleary M.L. Wolberger C. Cell. 1999; 96: 587-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Members of this subfamily have been identified in diverse species (9Burglin T.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4173-4180Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) and include the yeast Matα2 protein (10Astell C.R. Ahlstrom-Jonasson L. Smith M. Tatchell K. Nasmyth K.A. Hall B.D.

Human TGIF was cloned by its ability to bind to a specific retinoid-responsive element, and its DNA binding specificity has been determined (8Bertolino E. Reimund B. Wildt-Perinic D. Clerc R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31178-31188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). TGIF mRNA has been shown to be present in a wide variety of adult human tissues, although expression levels vary greatly. Expression of TGIF appears to be most strictly regulated within the brain (8Bertolino E. Reimund B. Wildt-Perinic D. Clerc R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31178-31188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Murine TGIF transcripts are absent from the early embryo and are first detectable at embryonic day 9.5.In situ analysis of TGIF expression in mouse embryos revealed expression in an extensive range of tissues, including the brain. However, during development, expression in the brain becomes restricted to specific areas of proliferating cells, such as the cerebellar neuroepithelium (14Bertolino E. Wildt S. Richards G. Clerc R.G. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 205: 410-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Human TGIF maps to 18p11.3 (15Edwards M.C. Liegeois N. Horecka J. DePinho R.A. Sprague Jr., G.F. Tyers M. Elledge S.J. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1063-1076Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a region that contains a locus (HPE4) associated with holoprosencephaly (16Overhauser J. Mitchell H.F. Zackai E.H. Tick D.B. Rojas K. Muenke M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 57: 1080-1085PubMed Google Scholar), a prevalent congenital disorder of brain and craniofacial malformation (17Ming J.E. Muenke M. Clin. Genet. 1998; 53: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Transcriptional repression can be brought about in various ways. One way is by competition for binding to DNA, thus displacing activators (18Johnson A.D. Cell. 1995; 81: 655-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In the case of TGIF, its binding to the retinoid X receptor response element within a reporter construct inhibits retinoid X receptor-dependent transcription in this manner (8Bertolino E. Reimund B. Wildt-Perinic D. Clerc R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31178-31188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation can also be achieved by the remodeling of chromatin structure by histone acetyl transferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs)1 (19Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar,20Wolffe A.P. Science. 1996; 272: 371-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The recruitment of HDACs by transcriptional repressors to specific target genes results in the compaction of nucleosome structure, limiting accessibility of the DNA template to transcription factors (21Hassig C.A.

TGIF and the mediator of TGF-β signaling, Smad2, have recently been shown to interact following TGF-β receptor activation (28Wotton D. Lo R.S. Lee S. Massagué J. Cell. 1999; 97: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). This interaction results in the recruitment of TGIF to TGF-β response elements, repressing TGF-β-activated transcription. Repression of Smad-dependent transcription by TGIF correlates with the recruitment of HDAC instead of the coactivator p300 into the Smad complex (28Wotton D. Lo R.S. Lee S. Massagué J. Cell. 1999; 97: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 29Pouponnot C. Jayaraman L. Massagué J. J. Biol.

Together, these results suggest that TGIF acts to repress transcription. However, little is known about whether TGIF has intrinsic transcriptional repressor activity or whether TGIF is a context-dependent repressor. Here we show that TGIF is an active transcriptional repressor. This transcriptional repression appears to be dependent on multiple regions of the TGIF protein and, at least in part, requires interaction of TGIF with a histone deacetylase. Mink lung epithelial L17 cells were cultured in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. L17 cells were transfected in 6-well plates using DEAE-dextran, as described previously (32Hata A. Lo R.S. Wotton D. Lagna M. Massagué J. Nature. 1997; 388: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Firefly luciferase was measured using Promega luciferase assay reagents, and Renilla luciferase was assayed in 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and 100 mm NaCl with 0.09 μm coelenterazine (Biosynth). pCMV-Renilla luciferase (Promega) was included in all transfections to control for transfection efficiency. Five Gal4p binding sites are present upstream of the E1b TATA box in (Gal)5-E1b-luc. The (Gal)5-AdMLP-luc, (Gal)5-SV40-luc, and its derivatives with intervening sequence between the Gal4p sites and the SV40 promoter are as described previously (33Swirnoff A.H. Apel E.D. Svaren J. Sevetson B.R. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 512-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). (Gal)4-TK-luc has four Gal4p binding sites upstream of the TK promoter from pBLCAT2 (34Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar), driving luciferase. (TG)5-TK-luc has five copies of a TGIF binding site (gatctcCTGTCAAtaca (TGIF binding site in uppercase letters)) inserted into the BamHI site of TK-luc. L17 cells were transfected with the indicated reporters (1000 ng/6-well plate) together with the indicated expression constructs. Total amounts of DNA were kept constant with either pCMV5 lacking an insert or a pCMV5-farnesyl transferase construct. TSA (in 100% ethanol) was added to the indicated concentrations 18 h before cell lysis. TGIF expression constructs were created within a modified pCMV5 containing a single Flag epitope or two copies of a HA epitope. Deletion constructs were created by polymerase chain reaction or by using existing restriction sites within the TGIF sequence. HDAC expression vectors are as described previously (35Yang W.-M. Yao Y.-L. Sun J.-M. Davie J.R. Seto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28001-28007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). GBD fusions were created within a Gal4p DNA-binding domain vector (pM;CLONTECH). COS-1 cells were transfected using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Thirty-six to 48 h after transfection, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in LSLD (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 10% glycerol) supplemented with 50 mm NaF, 0.3 mm Na3VO4, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Boehringer). Proteins were immunoprecipitated using M2 Flag-agarose (Sigma), separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Proteins were detected with a HA-specific monoclonal antibody (12CA5; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or the M2 Flag monoclonal antibody (Sigma) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig (Pierce) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham). To assess the role of TGIF in transcriptional regulation, we fused its entire coding sequence to the GBD. This expression construct was transfected into mink lung epithelial (L17) cells, together with various luciferase reporter constructs. When coexpressed with a reporter in which transcription of the luciferase gene was driven by a minimal TATA element and multiple Gal4p binding sites, GBD/TGIF failed to activate transcription. In contrast, GBD/TGIF repressed transcription from this reporter when compared with the activity obtained in the presence of a control plasmid or GBD alone (Fig. 1 A). To determine whether TGIF was able to repress transcription from more complex promoters, GBD/TGIF was targeted via multiple Gal4p sites to reporter constructs in which transcription was activated by the herpes simplex virus TK promoter or the adenovirus major late promoter. In addition to a TATA element, binding sites for Sp1 and NF-1 are present within the TK promoter, and the adenovirus major late promoter contains a CCAAT box and a binding site for USF (34Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar, 36Moncollin V. Miyamoto N.G. Zheng X.M. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2577-2584Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The activities of both the adenovirus major late and TK promoters were dramatically repressed by targeting of TGIF (Fig. 1, B and C). In contrast, little effect of GBD alone was observed. To determine whether this repression was dependent on the distance of the binding sites from the promoter region, TGIF was targeted to multiple Gal4p sites at different distances from the SV40 promoter. As shown in Fig. 1 D, luciferase expression driven by the SV40 promoter was strongly repressed by GBD/TGIF. In addition, when the Gal4p sites were separated from the promoter region by either 450 base pairs or 2.9 kilobase pairs, repression by GBD/TGIF was essentially unchanged. Thus, TGIF appeared to be able to repress transcription from a distance. To localize the repression domain within TGIF, a series of GBD/TGIF fusions were coexpressed with the TK-luciferase reporter containing Gal4p binding sites. As shown in Fig. 2 A, both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal halves of TGIF (amino acids 1–137 and 138–272) repressed transcription from the TK promoter. Further deletion within the amino-terminal half of TGIF revealed that much of the homeodomain and sequences carboxyl-terminal to it appeared to be dispensable for transcriptional repression (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, deletion from the amino terminus of TGIF resulted in a clear reduction in the ability of this half of the protein to repress transcription (Fig. 2 A). These results suggest the presence of a transcriptional repression domain at the extreme amino terminus of TGIF. A series of carboxyl-terminal fragments of TGIF fused to the GBD were coexpressed with (Gal)4-TK-luc. GBD/TGIF(138–272) repressed transcription, and further division of this region revealed that it could be separated into two subfragments capable of repressing transcription: GBD/TGIF(138–192) and GBD/TGIF(208–272), each of which repressed transcription (Fig. 2 B). Deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 42 amino acids from GBD/TGIF(108–272) resulted in a slight reduction in repression. Creation of a small internal deletion within the GBD/TGIF(108–230) construct resulted in a complete loss of its ability to repress transcription. These results suggest that the carboxyl-terminal half of TGIF constitutes a second repression domain, which may consist of two subdomains (Fig. 2 C). Five copies of the TGIF binding site (CTGTCAA; Ref. 8Bertolino E. Reimund B. Wildt-Perinic D. Clerc R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31178-31188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) were inserted upstream of the TK promoter within TK-luc (creating (TG)5-TK-luc). As shown in Fig. 3 A, expression of increasing amounts of TGIF in L17 cells reduced the activity of (TG)5-TK-luc by up to 80%. Little effect of TGIF expression on the TK-luc reporter lacking TGIF sites was observed. Thus, TGIF is able to repress transcription when bound directly to DNA via its homeodomain. Coexpression of a series of TGIF deletion constructs with (TG)5-TK-luc revealed that the presence of the homeodomain is critical for repression by TGIF via its own site (Fig. 3 B). However, expression of the homeodomain alone (construct 31–137) did not result in repression of transcription from (TG)5-TK-luc. All other TGIF deletion mutants containing an intact homeodomain repressed transcription to some degree, although some differences in transcriptional repression were observed (Fig. 3 B). To more carefully compare the contribution of each domain to transcriptional repression by TGIF when bound to DNA via its homeodomain, we tested five TGIF expression constructs that were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 3 C). Increasing amounts of each expression vector were cotransfected with a TK-luciferase reporter containing two TGIF sites. In this case, repression by TGIF was less potent, due to the reduced number of TGIF binding sites. With the maximum amount of TGIF(1–272), activity was repressed to about 35% of that with a control vector (Fig. 3 C). Carboxyl-terminal deletion to amino acid 192 had no effect on repression by TGIF. However, removal of an additional 28 amino acids (construct 1–164), leaving only the amino-terminal repression domain fully intact, dramatically reduced repression (Fig. 3 C). A small internal deletion (construct 1–147:177–272) decreased transcriptional repression, suggesting that this deletion was targeting an important domain of TGIF. However, TGIF(31–192) was also unable to repress transcription as efficiently as the wild type protein, suggesting that the other domains of TGIF contribute to repression (Fig. 3 C). Repression of transcription by many proteins has been shown to involve HDAC activity. Repression of transcription from the TK promoter by GBD/TGIF(1–272) was examined in the presence of increasing concentrations of the inhibitor of deacetylase activity, TSA. As shown in Fig. 4, GBD/TGIF(1–272) repressed transcription to less than 5% of that seen with a control plasmid, and TSA had little effect. Because this fusion protein contains multiple domains capable of repressing transcription, the effect of TSA on one domain may be masked by the presence of a second repression domain. We therefore tested the effect of TSA on repression by GBD/TGIF(1–137) and GBD/TGIF(138–272). TSA was unable to relieve repression by the isolated amino-terminal repression domain. However, transcriptional repression mediated by the carboxyl-terminal half of TGIF was significantly reduced by increasing concentrations of TSA (Fig. 4). These results suggest that the carboxyl-terminal region of TGIF may repress transcription by recruitment of a histone deacetylase, whereas the amino-terminal repression domain appears to be independent of this activity. To determine whether TGIF can interact with histone deacetylases, COS-1 cells were cotransfected with full-length TGIF tagged at its amino terminus with two copies of a HA epitope, together with Flag-tagged HDAC1. As shown in Fig. 5 A, TGIF was present in Flag immunoprecipitates from cells expressing both HA-TGIF and Flag-HDAC1. In contrast, no TGIF precipitated in the absence of coexpressed HDAC. To identify the HDAC-interacting region within TGIF, a series of HA-tagged TGIF deletion constructs was coexpressed with Flag-HDAC1. Carboxyl-terminal deletion to amino acid 230 or amino acid 192 did not affect the interaction with HDAC. Similarly, removal of the amino-terminal 107 amino acids had no effect on the interaction (Fig. 5 A). Deletion within the central repression domain of TGIF abolished the interaction with HDAC1 (compare constructs 1–230 and 1–147:177–230, Fig. 5 A). Additionally, no interaction of amino acids 1–164 of TGIF with HDAC1 was observed. These results place the HDAC-interacting domain of TGIF between amino acids 108 and 192, suggesting that the central repression domain of TGIF acts by recruiting HDACs. As shown in Fig. 5 B, TGIF was clearly detectable in Flag immunoprecipitates from cells expressing Flag-HDAC1. Similarly, HA-TGIF coprecipitated with the related proteins (35Yang W.-M. Yao Y.-L. Sun J.-M. Davie J.R. Seto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28001-28007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) HDAC2 and HDAC3, suggesting that TGIF was able to interact with all three HDACs tested. TGIF is a member of the atypical TALE family of homeodomain proteins (8Bertolino E. Reimund B. Wildt-Perinic D. Clerc R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31178-31188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 9Burglin T.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4173-4180Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Members of this family of proteins have been shown to play roles in both transcriptional activation and repression. In the case of proteins such as Prep1, effects on transcription appear to be context-dependent. Thus, Prep1 is able to participate in either transcriptional repression or activation, depending on the other DNA-binding proteins with which it associates. Prep1 can displace HoxB1 and bind to DNA together with Pbx1, repressing transcription relative to a Pbx1/HoxB1 complex. However, recruitment of Prep1 by a DNA-bound complex of Pbx1 and HoxB1, without a requirement for DNA binding by Prep1, results in increased transcriptional activity (37Berthelsen J. Zappavigna V. Mavilio F. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1423-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 38Berthelsen J. Zappavigna V. Ferretti E. Mavilio F. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1434-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In contrast, TGIF appears to be an obligate transcriptional repressor. We have been unable to show transcriptional activation by TGIF, regardless of whether it was bound directly to DNA, tethered via a heterologous DNA-binding domain, or recruited to DNA by an activated Smad complex (28Wotton D. Lo R.S. Lee S. Massagué J. Cell. 1999; 97: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that interaction of TGIF with a specific protein would mask its ability to repress transcription. Under such circumstances, it is conceivable that TGIF could aid another protein in transcriptional activation, perhaps by stabilizing its binding to DNA. TGIF appears to contain at least two functionally separable repression domains. The amino-terminal domain, including part of the homeodomain, represses transcription independent of HDAC activity. Repression by the amino-terminal region of TGIF is unlikely to be due to competition with activator proteins for binding to specific response elements because it is able to repress as a Gal4p fusion. Together with the fact that TGIF repressed several unrelated promoters, this also suggests that TGIF is not acting specifically on one transcriptional activator, but rather that repression by TGIF is at the level of more general factors. Several homeodomain proteins repress transcription via interactions with components of the general transcription machinery. TheDrosophila Eve protein represses transcription by interacting directly with the TATA-binding protein, preventing it from binding to the TATA element (39Li C. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3771-3781Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that part of the homeodomain of human Msx-1 (termed the amino-terminal arm), which precedes helix one, interacts with TATA-binding protein and represses transcription (7Zhang H. Catron K.M. Abate-Shen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1764-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Similarly, repression by HoxA7 is mediated by the homeodomain and is modulated by the amino-terminal arm (6Schnabel C.A. Abate-Shen C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2678-2688Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal repression domain of TGIF may also repress transcription by interacting with TATA-binding protein or other general transcription factors. Alternatively, TGIF may interact with and recruit a second repressor protein, which confers the ability of this domain to repress transcription. Within the carboxyl-terminal half of TGIF, two regions appear to contribute to transcriptional repression (see Fig. 6). The central region of the protein interacts with HDAC, whereas we have been unable to demonstrate an interaction of HDAC with the extreme carboxyl terminus of the protein alone. Experiments with an inhibitor of HDAC activity (TSA) demonstrated that, in contrast to the amino-terminal repression domain, repression by the entire carboxyl-terminal half of the protein is dependent on HDAC activity. One interpretation of this result is that both repression domains within this half of the protein contribute to the recruitment of HDAC. In isolation, the carboxyl-terminal region of TGIF can repress transcription in the context of a GBD fusion, but it does not stably interact with HDAC to allow detection by co-immunoprecipitation. If this region represents an entirely separate repression domain, it is likely that it would mask the effect of TSA on the central region, as the amino-terminal repression domain appears to do. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that TGIF contains three repression domains, only one of which is dependent on HDAC. When bound to DNA via its homeodomain, full transcriptional repression by TGIF appears to require the central HDAC-interacting repression domain. Thus, a major way in which TGIF represses transcription may be by the recruitment of HDAC activity. However, the relative importance of these domains may be skewed by deletion analyses. We have demonstrated that TGIF actively represses transcription from multiple TGIF binding sites. A tandem array of five TGIF-like binding sites is present within the retinoid X receptor response element from the cellular retinol-binding protein II promoter (8Bertolino E. Reimund B. Wildt-Perinic D. Clerc R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31178-31188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Binding of bacterially expressed TGIF to this response element has been demonstrated, and this binding has been suggested to repress retinoid-dependent transcription. Our results demonstrate that such an element would be the target of active repression by TGIF. However, four of these TGIF-like sites are degenerate, suggesting that repression of this element by TGIF may require other factors. Interactions with other DNA-bound factors could modify the DNA binding specificity of TGIF. In light of numerous other homeodomain proteins that bind DNA cooperatively with other transcription factors (40Mann R.S. Chan S.K. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 258-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 41Mann R.S. Affolter M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), such a mechanism seems likely. Interestingly, many of these interactions involve multiple DNA-binding homeodomain proteins (5Piper D.E. Batchelor A.H. Chang C.-P. Cleary M.L. Wolberger C.

TGIF is able to repress Smad2/Smad3-dependent, TGF-β-activated transcription, and it appears that both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal repression domains are required for this corepressor activity (28Wotton D. Lo R.S. Lee S. Massagué J. Cell. 1999; 97: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). TGIF may play two separate roles within the cell: (a) acting as a specific corepressor for TGF-β-activated Smads, thereby limiting the effect of TGF-β signaling; and (b) repressing the transcription of a distinct set of genes. Thus, repression of transcription by TGIF, when bound directly to DNA, may have no functional overlap with its role in TGF-β-activated transcription. As shown in Fig. 6, TGIF appears to contain two separate recruitment domains: one that binds directly to DNA (8Bertolino E. Reimund B. Wildt-Perinic D. Clerc R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31178-31188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) and another, which binds TGF-β-activated Smad proteins (28Wotton D. Lo R.S. Lee S. Massagué J. Cell. 1999; 97: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Three other functional domains are present within TGIF: an amino-terminal, HDAC-independent repression domain (repression domain 1 (RD-1)), and two regions (RD-2a and RD-2b) within the carboxyl terminus of the protein that repress transcription in a HDAC-dependent manner. Although RD-2a alone is capable of interacting with HDAC, RD-2b may be part of the same carboxyl-terminal repression domain and may contribute to the formation of a TGIF/HDAC complex. In summary, we have demonstrated that TGIF is an active transcriptional repressor. This repression is dependent, at least in part, on HDAC activity, suggesting that TGIF may regulate transcription by remodeling chromatin. TGIF represses transcription in a context-independent manner, suggesting that any promoter to which TGIF is recruited will be repressed. It will therefore be of great interest to identify the regulatory mechanisms controlling the level or activity of TGIF within the cell. We thank Dr. E. Seto for the HDAC expression vectors, Dr. J.

https://openalex.org/W2041561339,"FKBP52 is a high molecular mass immunophilin possessing peptidylprolyl isomerase (PPIase) activity that is inhibited by the immunosuppressant drug FK506. FKBP52 is a component of steroid receptor·hsp90 heterocomplexes, and it binds to hsp90 via a region containing three tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs). Here we demonstrate by cross-linking of the purified proteins that there is one binding site for FKBP52/dimer of hsp90. This accounts for the common heterotetrameric structure of native receptor heterocomplexes being 1 molecule of receptor, 2 molecules of hsp90, and 1 molecule of a TPR domain protein. Immunoadsorption of FKBP52 from reticulocyte lysate also yields co-immunoadsorption of cytoplasmic dynein, and we show that co-immunoadsorption of dynein is competed by a fragment of FKBP52 containing its PPIase domain, but not by a TPR domain fragment that blocks FKBP52 binding to hsp90. Using purified proteins, we also show that FKBP52 binds directly to the hsp90-free glucocorticoid receptor. Because neither the PPIase fragment nor the TPR fragment affects the binding of FKBP52 to the glucocorticoid receptor under conditions in which they block FKBP52 binding to dynein or hsp90, respectively, different regions of FKBP52 must determine its association with these three proteins."

RAD30encodes a DNA polymerase, pol η,1 that can efficiently and correctly bypass a cis-syn-thymine-thymine (T-T) dimer in template DNA by inserting two adenines opposite the two thymines of the dimer (4Johnson R.E.

The Rad30 DNA polymerase activity is essential for resistance to UV radiation and for its role in error-free bypass (3Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol.

Recently, the human homologue of pol η has been identified, and mutational alterations in this protein are responsible for the variant form of the cancer-prone genetic disorder xeroderma pigmentosum (XP-V) (5Johnson R.E. Kondratick C.M. Prakash S. Prakash L. Science. 1999; 285: 263-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 6Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Yamada A. Dohmae N. Yokoi M. Yuasa M. Araki M. Iwai S. Takio K. Hanaoka F. Nature. 1999; 399: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). Most DNA polymerases misincorporate deoxynucleotides with very low frequencies, in part because they prefer to insert deoxynucleotides that form correct Watson-Crick base pairs and which do not distort the Watson-Crick geometry (7Echols H. Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 477-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Thus, even though the capacity for base pairing recognition is retained in the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (8Kemmink J. Boelens R. Koning T. van der Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Kaptein R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 4645-4653Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar,9Kim J.-K. Patel D. Choi B.-S. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 62: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), a T-T dimer is still a block to most DNA polymerases, including the eukaryotic replicative polymerase pol δ (4Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. Science. 1999; 283: 1001-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar), presumably because of the intolerance of their active site to DNA distortion caused by the dimer (10Ciarrocchi G. Pedrini A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 155: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 11Wang C.-I. Taylor J.-S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9072-9076Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In contrast, the ability of pol η for efficient and correct bypass of a T-T dimer may derive from an unusual active site that is more tolerant of DNA distortions. In that case, pol η would be expected to have a low fidelity (see also the “Discussion”). Here we determine the fidelity of pol η by measuring the steady-state kinetics of correct and incorrect deoxynucleotide incorporation and also examine its processivity. We find that pol η is a low fidelity polymerase, and it incorporates only a few nucleotides before dissociating from the primer-template DNA substrate. This low processivity may restrict pol η synthesis to short patches, thereby minimizing the error frequency, and thus accounting for its role in error-free bypass of UV-damaged DNA. The following four (53-mer) oligodeoxynucleotides were used as templates, and they differ only in the underlined sequences: Template G, 5′-ATGCC TGCAC GAAGA GTTCC TAGTG CCTAC ACTGG AGTAC CGGAG CATCG TCG; Template A, 5′-ATGCC TGCAC GAAGA GTTCG CTATG CCTAC ACTGG AGTAC CGGAG CATCG TCG; Template T, 5′-ATGCC TGCAC GAAGA GTTCA GCTTG CCTAC ACTGG AGTAC CGGAG CATCG TCG; Template C, 5′-ATGCC TGCAC GAAGA GTTCT AGCTG CCTAC ACTGG AGTAC CGGAG CATCG TCG. The oligodeoxynucleotide primer, 5′-CGACG ATGCT CCGGT ACTCC AGTGT AGGCA, was 5′-32P-end-labeled using polynucleotide kinase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Labeled primer (0.5 μm) was then annealed to the various templates (0.8 μm each) in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 100 mmNaCl by heating to 90 °C for 2 min, followed by cooling to 25 °C over several hours. DNA polymerase η was expressed in yeast strain BJ5464 and purified as described previously (3Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15975-15977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 4Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. Science. 1999; 283: 1001-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Pol η (2 nm) was incubated with 5′-32P-end-labeled primer-template substrate (50 nm) and various concentrations of a single deoxynucleotide (dNTP) (0–500 μm) in 25 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10% glycerol. Reactions were carried out at 25 °C for 2, 5, or 10 min and terminated by adding an equal volume of 150 mm EDTA containing 1.5% SDS. Quenched reactions were diluted 10 times in formamide loading buffer (80% deionized formamide, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mg/ml xylene cyanol, and 1 mg/ml bromphenol blue), heated to 90 °C for 2 min, placed on ice, and products resolved on 10% polyacrylamide sequencing gels containing 5.5 m urea. Analysis of the deoxynucleotide incorporation assays was done as described previously (12Goodman M.F. Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Petruska J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 83-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 13Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 232-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 14Bloom L.B.

Gel band intensities of the substrates and products were quantitated using a PhosphorImager and the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). For each concentration of dNTP, the observed rate of deoxynucleotide incorporation (V obs) was determined by dividing the relative amount of the extended product by the incubation time. The observed rate of deoxynucleotide incorporation was plotted as a function of dNTP concentration, and the data were fit by nonlinear regression using SigmaPlot 4.0 to the Michaelis-Menton equation describing a hyperbola as follows (Equation 1). Vobs=(Vmax×[dNTP])/(Km+[dNTP])(Eq. 1) Apparent K m and V maxsteady-state parameters for the incorporation of the correct and incorrect deoxynucleotides were obtained from the fit and used to calculate the frequency of deoxynucleotide misincorporation (f inc) using the following equation (Equation 2). finc=(Vmax/Km)incorrect/(Vmax/Km)correct(Eq. 2) Pol η (20 nm) was preincubated with the primer-template DNA substrate (20 nm) in 25 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10% glycerol for 20 min at 25 °C. Reactions were initiated by adding all four deoxynucleotides (200 μm each), 5 mmMgCl2, and excess sonicated herring sperm DNA (1 mg/ml) as a trap. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the trap, pol η was preincubuated with the trap DNA and the primer-template substrate before the addition of dNTPs and MgCl2. After various times, reactions were quenched and run on a 10% polyacrylamide gel as described for the deoxynucleotide incorporation assays. The processivity,P n, after each deoxynucleotide incorporation was calculated by a method derived from one previously described (15von Hippel P.H. Fairfield F.R. Dolejsi M.K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 726: 118-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, gel band intensities of the deoxynucleotide incorporation products at the 240 s incubation time were quantitated using the PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software. First, for each deoxynucleotide addition n, the percentage of active polymerase molecules incorporating at least n deoxynucleotides is given by the following equation (Equation 3), %active polymerases atn=(In+In+1+…)×100%/(I1+I2+…+In+…)(Eq. 3) where I1 is the intensity of the band at position 1, I n is the intensity of the band at position n, and so on. For each deoxynucleotide incorporation n, processivity, P n, is the probability that the polymerase will incorporate the next deoxynucleotide rather than dissociating (15von Hippel P.H. Fairfield F.R. Dolejsi M.K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 726: 118-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and is given by the following equation (Equation 4). Pn=%active polymerases atn+1/%active polymerases atn(Eq. 4) Applying Equation 3 to Equation 4 gives an expression forP n in terms of gel band intensities, and this equation was used to calculate the processivity as follows (Equation 5). Pn=(In+1+In+2+…)/(In+In+1+In+2+…)(Eq. 5) Fidelity is a measure of the frequency of incorporating a correctly base-paired versus an incorrectly base-paired deoxynucleotide (7Echols H. Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 477-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 12Goodman M.F. Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Petruska J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

To determine the frequency of misincorporation by pol η, we measured theV max and K m steady-state parameters for the incorporation of correct and incorrect deoxynucleotides opposite each template residue, using a standing-start assay, wherein the target template residue immediately follows the end of the primer (13Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 232-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Pol η (2 nm) was incubated with the primer-template DNA substrate (50 nm) and various concentrations of one of the four deoxynucleotides, after which reaction products were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and band intensities quantified. Fig. 1 A shows the deoxynucleotide incorporation pattern opposite a template T residue. The concentrations of dGTP, dTTP, and dCTP were varied from 0 to 200 μm, whereas the concentrations of dATP was varied from 0 to 10 μm. Under the reaction conditions, the kinetics of deoxynucleotide incorporation were linear with time. The kinetics of single deoxynucleotide incorporation opposite the template T residue are shown in Fig. 1 B. These data were fit to the Michaelis-Menton equation (Equation 1) and used to determine the apparent K m and V max values for each deoxynucleotide (Table I). The frequency of misincorporation, f inc, of G, T, and C opposite the template residue T was then calculated using Equation 2 (12Goodman M.F. Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Petruska J. Crit. Rev. Biochem.

Thusf inc for G opposite T is 5.3 × 10−3 (Table I). Similarly, f inc of T and C opposite the template T residue were 8.8 × 10−3 and 6.5 × 10−3, respectively (Table I).Table IFidelity of pol η by steady-state kineticsdNTPV maxK mV max/K mf incnm/minμmSubstrate S-1: template GdGTP0.48 ± 0.067180 ± 590.00273.8 × 10−4dATP0.20 ± 0.01092 ± 130.00223.1 × 10−4dTTP0.71 ± 0.02822 ± 2.50.0324.4 × 10−3dCTP3.1 ± 0.310.43 ± 0.247.2Substrate S-2: template AdGTP0.61 ± 0.0055100 ± 250.00612.6 × 10−3dATP0.38 ± 0.0087190 ± 100.00208.7 × 10−3dTTP3.0 ± 0.211.3 ± 0.312.3dCTP0.50 ± 0.01066 ± 3.20.00763.3 × 10−3Substrate S-3: template TdGTP0.89 ± 0.07499 ± 170.00905.3 × 10−3dATP2.9 ± 0.141.7 ± 0.251.7dTTP1.2 ± 0.01082 ± 180.0158.8 × 10−3dCTP0.52 ± 0.005548 ± 130.0116.5 × 10−3Substrate S-4: template CdGTP3.1 ± 0.365.0 ± 1.70.62dATP0.69 ± 0.16200 ± 780.00355.8 × 10−3dTTP0.15 ± 0.01475 ± 230.00203.2 × 10−3dCTP0.67 ± 0.05349 ± 130.0142.3 × 10−2 Open table in a new tab The V max and K msteady-state parameters for the misincorporation of deoxynucleotides opposite the other three template bases and the calculatedf inc values are also shown in Table I. The values for the f inc ranged from 3.1 × 10−4 for the misincorporation of A opposite a template G to 2.3 × 10−2 for the misincorporation of C opposite template C, and the average value for f inc was 6.0 × 10−3. Processivity is a measure of how many deoxynucleotides a DNA polymerase incorporates in a single DNA binding event (15von Hippel P.H. Fairfield F.R. Dolejsi M.K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 726: 118-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 18Bambara R.A. Fay P.J. Mallaber L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 270-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To ensure that we were observing deoxynucleotide incorporation resulting from a single DNA binding event, we monitored DNA synthesis in the presence of an excess of nonradiolabeled, sonicated herring sperm DNA as a trap (Fig. 2 A). The reactions inlanes 1–6 (Fig. 2 A) were performed by first preincubating pol η with the DNA substrate for 20 min. Excess herring sperm DNA, MgCl2, and all four deoxynucleotides were then added to initiate the reaction. The excess herring sperm DNA is included to trap all pol η molecules that dissociated from the substrate ensuring that all DNA synthesis resulted from a single DNA binding event. The reactions in lanes 7–12 (Fig. 2 A) were performed by first preincubating pol η with the DNA substrate and the excess herring sperm DNA for 20 min followed by the addition of MgCl2 and deoxynucleotides. The lack of DNA synthesis in these lanes shows that the excess herring sperm DNA is sufficient to trap all pol η molecules. The processivity of a DNA polymerase is quantitatively expressed as the probability, P n, for each deoxynucleotide incorporation event n that the polymerase will move ahead to incorporate the next nucleotide n + 1 rather than dissociate from the DNA template (15von Hippel P.H. Fairfield F.R. Dolejsi M.K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 726: 118-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). First, the percentage of active polymerase molecules incorporating at least n deoxynucleotides was calculated using Equation 3 (see “Materials and Methods”). The percentage of active polymerases adding at least one deoxynucleotide was set as 100%, and the percentage of active polymerases decreased after each subsequent addition because of the dissociation of some fraction of polymerase molecules. For example, 93% added at least two deoxynucleotides, 88% added at least three deoxynucleotides, 80% added at least four deoxynucleotides, and so on (Fig. 2 B). On this DNA substrate, ∼50% of the pol η molecules incorporate at least six deoxynucleotides before dissociating from the DNA. Next, we calculated the processivity P n after each deoxynucleotide incorporation using the following equation (Equation 5) (15von Hippel P.H. Fairfield F.R. Dolejsi M.K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 726: 118-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar): P n = (I n +1 + I n +2 + …)/(I n + I n +1 + I n +2 + …), where I n is the intensity of band n, I n +1 is the intensity of band n + 1, and so on. For example, of the polymerase molecules that incorporated one nucleotide, 93% incorporated at least one additional nucleotide. Thus,P 1 = 0.93. The values of P n ranged from 0.94 in the case of n = 2 deoxynucleotide additions to 0.40 in the case of n = 7 deoxynucleotide additions with an average value of 0.76 ± 0.20. Thus after each nucleotide incorporation, on average 76% of the bound pol η molecules incorporate at least one additional deoxynucleotide, while 24% dissociate from the DNA substrate. Thus pol η synthesizes DNA with low processivity. Replicative DNA polymerases incorporate wrong deoxynucleotides with very low frequencies (7Echols H. Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 477-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 12Goodman M.F. Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Petruska J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

This high fidelity has been suggested to arise in part because of the intolerance of the active site to geometric distortions in DNA (7Echols H. Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 477-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Structures of several DNA polymerases have indicated that a conformational change in the enzyme is critical for the formation of the phosphodiester bond between the primer and the incoming deoxynucleotide, and it plays an important role in fidelity (for a review, see Ref. 19Steitz T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17395-17398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these structures are consistent with the proposal that the incoming deoxynucleotide initially binds in the active site of the polymerase in a manner independent of the template base, but precise Watson-Crick base pairing geometry between the incoming deoxynucleotide, and the template base is required for this catalytically essential conformational change to occur (19Steitz T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17395-17398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Thus, if the geometry is not correct, the phosphodiester bond will not be formed efficiently. Even though the thymine bases of a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer can properly base pair with adenines (8Kemmink J. Boelens R. Koning T. van der Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Kaptein R.

Biochem. 1991; 60: 477-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). The ability of pol η to efficiently and correctly bypass dimers would suggest that relative to other DNA polymerases, the active site of pol η has an increased tolerance of DNA distortions. The in vitro misinsertion frequencies,f inc, vary for different DNA polymerases. Using a steady-state kinetics assay, the error rates for T4 DNA polymerase and Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, both replicative DNA polymerases, were found to vary from 10−4to 10−7 (14Bloom L.B.

Using an approach involving the synthesis of DNA in a gap across from the α-complementationlacZ gene of M13mp2, the eukaryotic replicative DNA polymerase pol δ was found to have an error rate of about 10−5 (21Thomas D.C.

Roberts J.D. Sabatino R.D. Myers T.W. Tan C.-K. Downey K.M. So A.G. Bambara R.A. Kunkel T.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11751-11759Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 22Osheroff W.P. Jung H.K.

Here, using the steady-state kinetics assay, we find pol η to have an error rate of ∼10−2 to 10−3. Thus, relative to these other DNA polymerases, pol η has a low fidelity, which may arise from an active site more tolerant of distortions in DNA. It would be of much interest to compare a high resolution structure of pol η with the structures of other DNA polymerases to determine the structural basis of the flexibility of pol η's active site that gives it a higher tolerance for distortions and a lower fidelity. Despite its low fidelity, pol η functions in error-free bypass of UV lesions. Both in yeast and humans, inactivation of pol η enhances the frequency of UV-induced mutations (1McDonald J.P. Levine A.S. Woodgate R. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1557-1568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol.

Additonally, pol η has little effect on spontaneous mutations, as the rate of spontaneous CAN1 s tocan1 r forward mutations is not affected in therad30Δ strain. 2S.-L. Yu, R. E. Johnson, S. Prakash, and L. Prakash, unpublished observations. Thus, there is no evidence that pol η contributes significantly to the generation of mutations in vivo. This likely occurs because the DNA synthesis activity of pol η is limited. Pol η may synthesize just enough DNA to bypass lesions, thus affording little opportunity to make errors. Additionally, the activity of pol η may be regulated by the Rad6-Rad18 complex (25Bailly V. Lauder S. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23360-23365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), which may have a role in targeting pol η to DNA damage sites and in ensuring that the action of pol η is limited to damage bypass. Very likely, pol δ takes over soon after the damage has been bypassed by pol η."
https://openalex.org/W1964648211,"The leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) integrin (CD11a/CD18) is an important adhesion molecule for lymphocyte migration and the initiation of an immune response. At the cell surface, LFA-1 activity can be regulated by divalent cations that enhance receptor affinity but also by membrane clustering induced by treatment of cells with substances such as phorbol esters. Membrane clustering leads to increased LFA-1 avidity. We report here that LFA-1-mediated binding of mouse thymocytes or activated T lymphocytes to intercellular adhesion molecule 1 can be rapidly induced by clustering of membrane rafts using antibodies to the glycosylphophatidylinositol-anchored molecule CD24 or cholera toxin (CTx). CD24 and CD18 were found to co-localize in rafts and cross-linking with CTx lead to enhanced LFA-1 clustering. We observed that disruption of raft integrity by lowering the membrane cholesterol content abolished the CTx and the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced LFA-1 binding but left the ability to activate LFA-1 with Mg2+/EGTA unimpaired. In contrast to activation with Mg2+/EGTA, activation via raft clustering was dependent on PI3-kinase, required cytoskeletal mobility, and was accompanied by Tyr phosphorylation of a 18-kDa protein. Our results support the notion that rafts as preformed adhesion platforms could be important for the rapid regulation of lymphocyte adhesion.

Lymphocytes usually travel in a nonadhesive form through the blood and lymph but become adherent when they have to interact with other cells. The LFA-11 (CD11a/CD18) integrin and its cellular ligands ICAM-1–3 play a crucial role in this process because they are involved in lymphocyte adhesion and transmigration through endothelial cells of the blood vessels and the stabilization of cell-cell contacts with antigen-presenting cells (for review see Refs.1Diamond M.S.

Thus, knowledge about the regulation of LFA-1 activity is important for the understanding of lymphocyte function. Lymphocytes can modulate LFA-1 binding without changing cell surface expression levels. Instead, the LFA-1 molecule can be rapidly converted from an inactive into an active state. In principle, the strength of LFA-1-mediated binding can be up-regulated in two ways: altering the affinity of the individual integrin molecule or increasing the avidity because of clustering of many LFA-1 molecules in the plane of the membrane (4Gahmberg C.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Experimentally, increased LFA-1 binding can be induced from the inside or the outside of the cell. For example, activation from the inside occurs following triggering of certain membrane receptors like the antigen-specific T cell receptor (6Dustin M.L. Springer T.A. Nature. 1989; 341: 619-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar), CD40 in B lymphocytes (7Barrett T.B. Shu G. Clark E.A. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 1722-1729PubMed Google Scholar), or CD14 for Mac-1 activation in monocytes (8Beekhuizen H. Blokland I. van Furth R. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 950-959PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of LFA-1 from the outside can be achieved with certain divalent cations like Mn2+ or Mg2+/EGTA, which are thought to bypass the physiological activation pathway and directly affect the conformation of the integrin receptor (4Gahmberg C.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 9Stewart M.P. McDowall A. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). LFA-1 cluster formation accompanied with increased LFA-1-mediated cell binding can artificially be induced by treatment of lymphocytes with phorbol esters and other substances that increase cellular Ca2+concentration (9Stewart M.P. McDowall A. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). This type of regulation depends on lateral diffusion of LFA-1 in the membrane and interaction with the cytoskeleton (4Gahmberg C.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 5Penninger J.M. Crabtree G.R.

Much attention has recently been drawn to the role of membrane microdomains termed as rafts (for review see Refs. 10Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar, 11Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 12Jacobson K. Dietrich C. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 87-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). These specialized membrane regions have a distinct composition and are enriched in sphingolipids, cholesterol, certain transmembrane proteins, and GPI-anchored proteins (13Varma R. Mayor S. Nature. 1998; 394: 798-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar, 14Friedrichson T. Kurzchalia T.V. Nature. 1998; 394: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 15Cinek T. Horejsi V. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2262-2270PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the evidence that rafts exist as a physical entity at the cell surface is functional, and convincing physical evidence is still necessary (12Jacobson K. Dietrich C. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 87-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Initially, microdomains containing glycospingolipids, GPI-anchored proteins and cholesterol were shown to mediate the vesicle transport and sorting of membrane proteins in polarized cells (10Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar, 16Brown D.A. Rose J.K.

At the cell surface, rafts could serve as platforms for signaling molecules like Src family members, G-proteins, PI3-kinase, and adaptor proteins (10Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar, 11Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 12Jacobson K.

Indeed, recent studies have demonstrated that rafts are required for efficient T cell activation (19Xavier R. T. Brennan Q. Li C. McCormack Seed B.

Here we have investigated the role of rafts and raft clustering in LFA-1 activation. Clustering was induced using two markers,i.e. antibodies against the GPI-anchored molecule CD24 that is confined to rafts or cholera toxin that binds to the raft marker GM1 lipid (11Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 19Xavier R. T. Brennan Q. Li C. McCormack Seed B.

We find that cross-linking leads to a rapid increase in LFA-1-mediated cell binding to purified ICAM-1 in thymocytes and activated T cells. We present evidence that CD24 and CD18 co-localize in rafts and that raft integrity is essential for cross-linking-induced but also basal LFA-1 binding. Our results suggest that membrane rafts are important platforms for the regulation of LFA-1 avidity. The following mAbs were used and have been described before: mAb 12–15 to CD2, mAb 500A12 to CD3, mAb 79 or M1.69 to mouse CD24, mAb 30G12 to CD45, mAb TIB 218 to CD18, mAbs FD441 (TIB 213) and FD 18.5 to CD11a, and mAb YN.1/1.7 against ICAM-1 (25Altevogt P. Hubbe M. Ruppert M. Lohr J. von Hoegen P. Sammar M. Andrew D.P. McEvoy L. Humphries M.J. Butcher E.C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The Thy-1-specific mAb G7 and FITC-anti-CD3 mAb were obtained from Pharmingen (Hamburg, Germany). The anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 was obtained from Biomol (Biomol, Hamburg, Germany) and antibodies to the CTx B subunit were obtained from Sigma. Antibodies were used in purified form for functional studies. CTx, CTx B subunit, and MCD were obtained from Sigma. Wortmannin, genistein, and bisindolylmaleimide I were obtained from Calbiochem (Bad Soden, Germany). Jasplakinolide was purchased from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). Thymus and spleen were collected from 6–8-week-old female C57Bl6 mice. The CD24−/− mice were originally obtained from Dr. Peter Nielsen (Max-Planck Institut für Immunbiologie, Freiburg, Germany) and bred in the DKFZ mouse colony. Erythrocytes were lysed by brief incubation in 155 mm NH4Cl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm KHCO3 solution followed by washing of the cells. T lymphocytes were activated with concanavalin A or immobilized mAb to CD3 as described previously (26Hubbe M. Altevogt P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 731-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Blasts were isolated by density centrifugation using histopaque 1077 (Sigma). The purity of the T cells was assessed by staining with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse CD3 and was approximately 95%. Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 10 mm Hepes, and 50 mm2-mercaptoethanol. All cells were cultivated at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 100% humidity. The staining of cells with mAbs and FITC-conjugated goat antibodies to rat Ig has been described (25Altevogt P. Hubbe M. Ruppert M. Lohr J. von Hoegen P. Sammar M. Andrew D.P. McEvoy L. Humphries M.J. Butcher E.C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 26Hubbe M. Altevogt P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 731-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Stained cells were analyzed with a FACScan (Becton & Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany). For confocal microscopy, cells were immobilized on poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides for 20 min and fixed with 1% freshly prepared paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min. Fluorescent staining was then perfomed using the mAb to CD18 or CD11a followed by FITC-conjugated goat anti-rat Ig. For CTx-induced cross-linking, cells were preincubated with CTx (15 μg/ml) for 10 min before immobilization to the glass slide. After staining the cells were imbedded in levanol and analyzed with a confocal microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochem, Germany). Mouse ICAM-1 was purified by affinity chromatography on a mAb YN.1/1.7 Sepharose column. Briefly, ESb-MP cells (25Altevogt P. Hubbe M. Ruppert M. Lohr J. von Hoegen P. Sammar M. Andrew D.P. McEvoy L. Humphries M.J. Butcher E.C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) were lysed in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, containing 2% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and passed over a normal rat IgG-Sepharose column followed by the specific antibody column. The column was washed and then eluted with 100 mm diethylamine/HCl, pH 11.5, 150 mm NaCl containing 50 mm β-octyl-glucopyranoside (25Altevogt P. Hubbe M. Ruppert M. Lohr J. von Hoegen P. Sammar M. Andrew D.P. McEvoy L. Humphries M.J. Butcher E.C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Peak fractions of the eluate were neutralized and analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. ICAM-1 in β-octyl-glucopyranoside (approximately 140 μg/ml) was diluted 1:10 with 10 mmTris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl and coated to LABTEK glass chamber slides (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany) for 16 h at 4 °C. Wells were blocked with 1% ovalbumin in Tris-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature and washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10 mm Hepes, 2 mmCa2+/Mg2+ (binding buffer). For the binding assay, cells (5–10 × 106/ml) were suspended in binding buffer, and 0.2 ml aliquots were added to the coated slides. For activation of LFA-1 binding, the ions in the buffer were substituted with 5 mm Mg2+ and 1 mmEGTA. Treatment of cells with PMA was performed in binding buffer supplemented with 50 ng/ml of PMA for 5 min. Raft cross-linking was induced by preincubation with antibodies (15 μg/ml purified antibody) or variable concentrations of CTx for 5 min. Antibody-mediated blocking of cell binding was carried out as described before (25Altevogt P. Hubbe M. Ruppert M. Lohr J. von Hoegen P. Sammar M. Andrew D.P. McEvoy L. Humphries M.J. Butcher E.C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The binding assay was performed for 30 min at room temperature without shaking, and the slides were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline after briefly dipping into phosphate-buffered saline. Bound cells were measured by counting six independent 10× fields by video microscopy using IMAGE 1.47 software. Data are presented as the mean values ± S.E. A stock solution was prepared by dissolving MCD in water at 5 g/ml (approximately 379 mm). MCD was diluted in binding buffer at the indicated concentration, and the cells were incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Cells were then directly used for the binding assay. For the treatment with lovastatin (kind gift of Dr. Jörg Kreuzer, University of Heidelberg), cells were cultured in the presence of 1 μmfor 20 h. DIGs, cytosol, and membrane fraction were isolated as described by Xavier et al. (19Xavier R. T. Brennan Q. Li C. McCormack Seed B. Immunity. 1998; 8: 723-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, thymocytes were lysed in 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin. The lysate was mixed with an equal volume of 85% sucrose (w/v in lysis buffer), and a step gradient was prepared by overlaying with 30% sucrose in lysis buffer followed by a final layer of 5% sucrose. The gradient was centrifuged for 18 h at 200,000 × g using a Beckman SW 55TI rotor. DIGs were isolated from the 5%/30% interphase. Cytosolic proteins and cellular membranes were prepared from postnuclear supernatant using the protocol of Walter and Blobel (27Walter P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells suspended in buffer A (250 mm sucrose, 50 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.5, 50 mm potassium acetate, 6 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 500 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and disrupted by three rounds of freezing and thawing. Cell nuclei were centrifuged (1000 × gfor 10 min), and the postnuclear supernatant was collected, applied to a cushion of 45% sucrose in buffer A, and centrifuged for 30 min at 140,000 × g using a Beckman SW 28 rotor. The pellet containing microsomal membranes was resuspended in buffer A. The supernatant was collected and considered as cytosolic fraction. The protein content of DIGs, cytosolic fraction, and membranes was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay and adjusted to 500 μg/ml. 10 μg of protein from the DIG, cytosolic or membrane fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% slab gel under nonreducing conditions and transferred to an Immobilon membrane using semi-dry blotting. Equal loading of lanes was controlled by Ponceau S staining of the membrane. After blocking with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline the blot was developed with CD24- or CD18-specific mAbs followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG and ECL detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Tyr phosphorylation of cellular proteins was tested by incubating thymocytes for the indicated length of time with mAb to CD24, CTx, Mg2+/EGTA, or PMA at 37 °C. Cells were then lysed in the presence of Na3VO4 for blocking of phosphatases, and lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted to Immobilon membrane, and analyzed for Tyr phosphorylation using a specific mAb and ECL as described previously (28Sammar M. Gulbins E. Hilbert K. Lang F. Altevogt P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that antibodies to the GPI-anchored molecule CD24 can modulate integrin activity; however, the underlying mechanism remained unclear (28Sammar M. Gulbins E. Hilbert K. Lang F. Altevogt P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 29Ruppert M. Aigner S. Hubbe M. Yagita H. Altevogt P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1881-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In the thymus, CD24 is expressed by nearly all cells, but expression ends before the cells leave the thymus and enter the periphery. We investigated the effects of anti-CD24 antibodies on the binding of thymocytes to purified mouse ICAM-1. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the basal level of binding was significantly enhanced in the presence of mAb M1.69 or other mAbs to CD24 (not shown). Adhesion was blocked by mAbs to LFA-1 or ICAM-1 in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that it was mediated by the LFA-1/ICAM-1 binding pathway (not shown). Engagement of CD24 was required for the LFA-1 activation as thymocytes derived from CD24−/− animals did not show this effect (Fig. 1 A). However, both CD24−/− and CD24+/+ thymocytes showed equal levels of LFA-1-mediated binding in response to Mg2+/EGTA, which is known to increase LFA-1 affinity (2Stewart M. Hogg N. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar,9Stewart M.P. McDowall A. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). mAbs to other cell surface antigens expressed by thymocytes were tested in a dose range of 1–50 μg/ml. In addition to CD24, another GPI-anchored molecule, Thy-1, was able to stimulate LFA-1-mediated cell binding. Antibodies to the transmembrane proteins CD45, CD3, or CD2 were without effect in the short term binding assay (not shown). GPI-anchored proteins are enriched in rafts (10Simons K. Ikonen E.

DIGs, cell membrane, and the cytosol fraction from thymocytes of CD24+/+ and CD24−/− mice were isolated, and the distribution of CD24 and CD18, the common β2 chain of LFA-1 were analyzed. As expected and shown in Fig. 2, CD24 was highly enriched in the DIG fraction of CD24+/+ thymocytes but was absent in CD24−/− thymocytes. Strikingly, also CD18 was found primarily in the DIG fraction of both types of thymocytes. A similar analysis for CD11a could not be performed because of the lack of blotting antibodies in the mouse. However, because CD11a/CD18 form a functional dimer at the cell surface, the results suggested that LFA-1 and CD24 are co-localized in membrane rafts. We assumed that the CD24 mAb cross-linked membrane rafts and because of the co-localization led to LFA-1 cluster formation. To test this hypothesis, another raft marker, the GM1 lipid, was used. CTx consists of an A subunit surrounded by five B subunits that can bind to GM1 and that has been used to cluster rafts (21Viola A. Schroeder S. Sakakibara Y. Lanzavecchia A. Science. 1999; 283: 680-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 24Harder T. Simons K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). We treated thymocytes with CTx or, for control, the monovalent B subunit and analyzed the effect on ICAM-1 binding. Fig. 1 B shows that CTx cross-linking triggered ICAM-1 binding in both CD24−/− and CD24+/+ thymocytes in a dose-dependent manner. The monomeric B subunit was unable to mediate the activating effect. However, when the B subunit was cross-linked with specific antibodies, LFA-1 activation was observed with similar magnitude as the intact CTx (not shown). These observations supported the notion that raft clustering was a prerequisite for the induction of LFA-1-mediated cell binding and that the A subunit was not involved in the process. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis revealed that the level of CD11a or CD18 expression on thymocytes did not change following preincubation with CTx (not shown). As shown in Fig. 3, using confocal microscopy, untreated cells revealed a patchy membrane staining of CD18, and these patches were significantly enlarged and appeared more condensed in CTx-pretreated cells. This observations are in support of the notion that CTx induces raft cluster formation. Having established that raft cross-linking can induce LFA-1-mediated cell binding, we set out to further characterize this activation pathway. Previous studies have indicated that rafts are enriched in Src kinases (15Cinek T. Horejsi V. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2262-2270PubMed Google Scholar, 24Harder T. Simons K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). A possible role of these kinases in CD24- or CTx-induced cell binding was therefore investigated. As summarized in Fig. 4, pretreatment of thymocytes with the Tyr kinase inhibitor genistein could prevent cell binding induced by CTx and the mAb to CD24 but did not affect the Mg2+/EGTA- or PMA-induced binding to ICAM-1. Similar results were obtained by pretreatment of cells with wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3-kinase. In contrast, the protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I blocked only the PMA-induced LFA-1 activation but did not affect any other activation pathway. Integrin binding induced by receptor clustering involves rearrangement of the cytoskeleton (9Stewart M.P. McDowall A. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 30van Kooyk Y. Weder P. Heije K. Figdor C.G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1061-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To analyze the role of the cytoskeleton in raft cross-linking, cells were pretreated with jasplakinolide, which stabilizes pre-existing actin filaments, promotes actin polymerization, and prevents actin depolymerization (9Stewart M.P. McDowall A. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 31Bubb M.R. Senderowicz A.M. Sausville E.A. Duncan K.L. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14869-14871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, Jasplakinolide did not cause inhibition of thymocyte binding in response to Mg2+/EGTA treatment of the cells. In contrast, the binding seen following activation by the mAb to CD24, CTx, or PMA was drastically reduced. Given the observation that inhibitors of Tyr kinases could block raft clustering-induced LFA-1 binding, we analyzed the effect of raft clustering on the phosphorylation of cellular proteins using phosphotyrosine blots of whole cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 5, binding of CTx or the mAb to CD24 specifically induced Tyr phosphorylation of a 16–18-kDa protein. This protein band was not detected in thymocytes treated with Mg2+/EGTA or PMA. The nature of the pp16/18 protein remains to be determined. Collectively, these data and the results presented in Fig. 4 suggest that the different pathways of LFA-1 activation are distinct but partially overlapping. Membrane rafts are enriched in cholesterol, and several reports have shown that depletion of cellular cholesterol can disperse rafts and destroy function (13Varma R. Mayor S. Nature. 1998; 394: 798-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar, 14Friedrichson T. Kurzchalia T.V. Nature. 1998; 394: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 32Keller P. Simons K.

To further analyze the role of rafts for LFA-1-mediated cell binding, we established conditions to extract membrane cholesterol from thymocytes using MCD. As shown in Table I, pretreatment of thymocytes with 1 mm MCD reduced the level of binding seen after cross-linking with CTx or the mAb to CD24 by approximately 80 or 70%, respectively. The PMA-induced LFA-1 binding was reduced by approximately 42%. The ability of cells to bind ICAM-1 in response to Mg2+/EGTA was not impaired.Table IEffect of cholesterol depletion on LFA-1-mediated cell bindingThymocytesT cell blastsUntreatedMCD-treated (1 mm)UntreatedMCD-treated (10 mm)Mg/EGTA (5 mm/1 mm)100 ± 1.797.8 ± 1.4100 ± 2.793.7 ± 3.6CTx (15 μg/ml)100 ± 3.817.6 ± 2.7100 ± 3.137 ± 3.2mAb CD24 (15 μg/ml)100 ± 1031 ± 1.9100 ± 2.936.1 ± 2.7PMA (50 ng/ml)100 ± 6.158.7 ± 1.2100 ± 2.851.5 ± 1 Open table in a new tab We also investigated the effect of MCD treatment on the binding of activated T lymphocytes to ICAM-1. In contrast to thymocytes, activated mouse T lymphocytes showed a higher level of basal binding (see below) that was further enhanced by cross-linking with CTx, Mg2+/EGTA, or PMA treatment (between 20–45%). Cross-linking with mAbs to CD24, which is transiently expressed by activated T lymphocytes (26Hubbe M. Altevogt P. Eur. J.

Rates of barbed-end elongation onto Spectrin·4.1·Actin seeds were measured by right angle light scattering to avoid confounding effects of pyrenyl-actin, and KINSIM was used to analyze elongation progress curves. Without thymosin-β4, both actin and Profilin·Actin (P·A) are competent in barbed-end polymerization, and kinetic simulations yielded the same bimolecular rate constant (∼10 × 106m−1 s−1) for actin monomer or Profilin·Actin. When measured in the absence of profilin, actin assembly curves over a 0.7–4 μmthymosin-β4 concentration range fit a simple monomer sequestering model (1 μm K D for Thymosin-β4·Actin). The corresponding constant for thymosin-β4·pyrenyl-Actin, however, was significantly higher (∼9–10 μm), suggesting that the fluorophore markedly weakens binding to thymosin-β4. With solutions of actin (2 μm) and thymosin-β4 (2 or 4 μm), the barbed-end assembly rate rose with increasing profilin concentration (0.7–2 μm). Actin assembly in presence of thymosin-β4 and profilin fit a simple thermodynamic energy cycle, thereby disproving an earlier claim (D. Pantaloni and M.-F.

Resting cells contain high concentrations of unpolymerized actin, typically 200–400 μm, or about 600–1200 times greater than the critical concentration for assembly of pure actin (1Stossel T.P.

Actin-sequestering proteins prevent spontaneous assembly of monomeric actin, and nonmuscle cells contain two such sequestering proteins: the 15-kDa protein profilin and the 5-kDa thymosin-β4 (3Southwick F.S.

Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1261-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These proteins were mainly thought to bind actin monomers with a one-to-one stoichiometry and to sequester actin monomers, and both have a higher affinity toward Actin·ATP as compared with Actin·ADP. The current view is that profilin and thymosin-β4 are likely to play complementary roles in the cell. Thymosin-β4 has a single mode of action (5Safer D. Nachmias V.T. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 6Safer D. Elzinga M. Nachmias V.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4029-4032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Safer D.

The mode of action of profilin, however, is more complex and in many respects has remained controversial and elusive. Although the Profilin·Actin complex was initially also thought to be strictly a monomer-sequestering protein (9Lal A.A. Korn E.D. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6631-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) later confirmed the inference that it adds to the barbed ends of actin filaments (13Tilney L.G. Bonder E.M. Coluccio L.M. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 112-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Initial rate and steady-state assembly measurements showed that profilin can efficiently bind actin monomers (K d < 5 μm) and can weakly interact with filament barbed ends (K capping ∼ 100 μm). Profilin catalyzes exchange of free ATP with actin-bound ADP to form actin-bound ATP and free ADP (14Mockrin S.C. Korn E.D. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5359-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 15Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Machesky L.M. Doberstein S.K. Pollard T.D J.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8384-8392Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Profilin also exhibits affinity toward oligoproline modules (17Tanaka M. Shibata H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), another unique property that facilitates transfer of actin monomers to the polymerization zone (16Kang F. Laine R.O. Bubb M.R. Southwick F.S. Purich D.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8384-8392Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) lying immediately behind motile Listeria (18Theriot J.A. Rosenblatt J. Portnoy D.A.

A. 1998; 95: 13917-13922Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). By concentrating Profilin·Actin complex in regions of active filament assembly, explosive rates of filament growth (≥500 monomers s−1) are readily catalyzed. By contrast, thymosin-β4 does not bind to oligoproline and fails to concentrate in the polymerization zone. Highly motile cells contain high concentrations of both profilin and thymosin-β4, and these proteins probably act in concert to promote rapid filament assembly. Pantaloni and Carlier (21Pantaloni D. Carlier M.-F. Cell. 1993; 75: 1007-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) investigated the role of profilin in the absence and presence of thymosin-β4. They suggested that profilin reduces the critical monomer concentration needed for filament assembly, and they suggested that this is accomplished by accelerating the irreversible hydrolysis of polymer-bound Profilin·Actin·ATP complex. However, their experimental design was compromised in several significant ways: 1) they used pyrenyl-actin polymerization and had to correct the observed data for the low affinity of profilin for pyrenyl-actin (9Lal A.A. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10132-10138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Pring M. Weber A. Bubb M.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1827-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 23Vinson V.K. De La Cruz E.M. Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10871-10880Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar); 2) all of their determinations of the steady-state extent of polymerization rested on the results of single-point assays; and, most seriously, 3) their chosen conditions incorrectly assumed that it is possible to bias assembly in favor of barbed-end filament growth. In the latter case, steady-state assembly assays on filaments with both ends free must always reflect monomer gain and loss from both ends, irrespective of the experimentally chosen monomer concentration. Moreover, such conditions permit ATP-dependent treadmilling, a nonequilibrium condition that may have unnecessarily complicated their thermodynamic analysis. The oft-quoted proposal that profilin reduces the critical actin monomer concentration by promoting irreversible ATP hydrolysis bears directly on virtually all efforts to understand the underlying mechanisms of actin-based motility. In the light of the aforementioned limitations on the earlier study, we decided to conduct an independent examination of how profilin promotes actin assembly in the absence and presence of thymosin-β4. To monitor the progress of actin polymerization, we relied on right angle light scattering, thereby avoiding all complications encountered with the use of pyrenyl-actin. To examine barbed-end actin assembly exclusively, we used the erythrocyte Spectrin·4.1·Actin complex to “seed” polymerization. Finally, to achieve self-consistent kinetic and equilibrium parameters, we utilized the KINSIM/FITSIM software to analyze large data sets defining the polymerization progress curves. Our experimental findings indicate that (a) the Profilin·Actin complex participates in an assembly scheme defined by a closed thermodynamic cycle, whether or not thymosin-β4 is present, and (b) there is no perceptible reduction in the actin critical concentration, even when profilin and thymosin-β4 are both simultaneously present. Actin was purified from rabbit muscle acetone powder by the method of Spudich and Watt (24Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4865-4871Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and gel-filtered through a 16/60 Superdex-200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Purified actin was maintained in G-buffer (5 mmTris-HCl, 0.1 mm calcium chloride, 0.2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.02% sodium azide, pH 7.9) and used within a week. Pyrene-labeled actin was prepared as described previously (25Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) and was then gel-filtered as indicated above. Recombinant human profilin was expressed in Escherichia coli(16Kang F. Laine R.O. Bubb M.R. Southwick F.S. Purich D.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8384-8392Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and purified by poly-l-proline affinity chromatography (26Lindburg U. Schutt C.E. Hellsten E. Tjader A.-C. Hult T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 967: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and Superdex 200 gel filtration to remove any profilin dimers or oligomers. Profilin monomer fraction was kept in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm sodium chloride, and 0.02% sodium azide and used within a week. Appropriate restriction sites were introduced into the coding sequence of rat Tβ41 by polymerase chain reaction, and the modified DNA was ligated into theNdeI-BamHI sites of PET-12a vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). The sequence was verified by double-strand DNA sequencing. The construct of Tβ4 was transformed into the E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. The cells were grown at 37 °C in 500 ml of LB medium (containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin) untilA 600 reached a value of 0.6, whereupon expression was induced by adding isopropylthiogalactoside (0.5 mm). The cells were harvested 3 h later by centrifugation, and the pellet was disrupted in 25 ml of ice-cold 0.5m perchloric acid with sonication for 30 s. After centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatant fluid was adjusted to pH 7.0 with potassium hydroxide. The sample was then kept on ice for 30 min, and the potassium perchlorate precipitate was removed by brief centrifugation. The resulting supernatant was enriched in Tβ4, based on analysis by SDS-PAGE and gel shift assay for G-actin (7Safer D. Golla R. Nachmias V.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2536-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The further purification of Tβ4 was carried out as described previously (27Hannappel E. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 390-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 28Yu F.-X. Lin S.-C. Morrison-Bogorad M. Atkinson M.A.L. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 502-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Tβ4-enriched sample was adjusted to pH 4.0 with formic acid and dialyzed overnight against 20 mm formic acid (pH 4.0). The sample was loaded onto a 1-ml HiTrap SP column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and preequilibrated with 20 mm formic acid (pH 4.0). Column-bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient (0–1 m sodium chloride). Thymosin-β4-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm sodium chloride, 0.02% sodium azide. Further purification was achieved using a 10/30 Superdex 75 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resulting recombinant Tβ4 was virtually pure, based on amino acid composition analysis. The Spectrin·Band 4.1·Actin complex was prepared from erythrocyte ghosts as described by Young et al. (29Young C.L. Feierstein A. Southwick F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13997-14002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), stored in G-buffer at 20 °C, and used within a week. Actin and profilin concentrations were measured by UV absorbance at 290 and 280 nm, using extinction coefficients of 0.026 and 0.015 μm−1 cm−1, respectively (30Tseng P.C. Runge M.S. Cooper J.A. Williams Jr., R.C. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Spectrin·Band-4.1·Actin complex only contains filaments with free barbed ends, and no pointed end assembly can occur (31Lin D.C. Lin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1415-1419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we used this erythrocyte preparation as polymerization seeds to study actin barbed-end elongation by measuring light scattering and/or fluorescence in a Spex Fluorolog-3 fluorometer (Spex Instruments, Inc, Edison, NJ). All experiments were carried out at 22 °C using Mg2+-actin. First, Ca2+-actin was converted to Mg2+-actin by incubating the Ca2+-actin sample in a buffer containing 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.05 mm magnesium chloride, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.01% sodium azide for 10 min. The incubation of actin was continued for an additional 5 min in the presence or absence of profilin and/or Tβ4. Seeded actin filament elongation was then initiated by adding Spectrin·4.1·Actin seeds, potassium chloride and magnesium chloride (final concentrations, of 0.1 and 2 mm respectively). For unlabeled actin, the time course of polymerization was determined by right angle light scattering at 350 nm. For pyrenyl-actin, the time course was monitored as an increase in fluorescence emission intensity at 387 nm (excitation at 366 nm with shutter on anti-bleaching mode). Polymerization of pyrenyl-actin was also measured by fluorescence and light scattering methods contemporaneously for the same sample by timed-switching between the two sets of excitation/emission wavelength settings. Our finding that the intensity of light scattering at a 90° angle is linearly proportional to polymer weight concentration is fully supported by earlier investigators (32Cooper J.A. Pollard T.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 198-200Google Scholar, 33Wegner A. Engel J. Biophys. Chem. 1975; 3: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 34Berne B.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 89: 755-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In particular, Cooper and Pollard (32Cooper J.A. Pollard T.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 198-200Google Scholar) state that 90° light scattering is proportional to polymer weight concentration and that light scattering is insignificant below the critical concentration. The work of Wegner and Engel (33Wegner A. Engel J. Biophys. Chem. 1975; 3: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) indicated that light scattering is insensitive to length distribution, when the polymer length reaches a critical length λ*. The parameter λ* equals λ/(4 sinθ), where λ is the wavelength of incident light; thus, when θ is 90°, λ* is approximately 90 nm. In practice, λ* is only a rough estimate, and those experienced with molecular light scattering find that linearity is often achieved when polymers reach a length of 0.5 λ*. In this regard, the average degree of polymerization of the actin filament seeds in Spectrin·4.1·Actin is 25–35, corresponding to a length of approximately 50 nm at the very beginning of the assembly process. Moreover, the concentration of actin seeds in our experiments was approximately 0.6 nm, whereas the initial actin monomer concentration was typically in the 2 μm range. At steady state, the filaments should reach an average length of nearly 1.2 μm (i.e. 450 monomers/filament × 2.8 nm/monomer). This polymer length is around 14 times greater than λ*, indicating that light scattering intensity should be strictly proportional to polymer mass after the first 3% of polymerization has occurred, a condition that is most likely achieved within 15 s after mixing. Whereas the above considerations indicate that accurate elongation rates are being measured over virtually the entire time course of elongation, we offer the following empirical evidence that is specifically relevant to our experiments. First, each successive pair of data points on any of our polymerization time courses corresponds to the instantaneous elongation rate with respect to a given incremental change in actin concentration. All of our polymerization data almost exactly match a first-order kinetic process, from start to end. Such a finding further validates the conclusion that incremental increases in light scattering intensity are proportional to polymer mass. Second, plots of light scattering intensity versus actin monomer concentration are linear, and when extrapolated to zero light scattering intensity, they yield critical concentration values matching those obtained with pyrenyl-actin in the absence of profilin and thymosin-β4. This observation also indicates that the total light scattering amplitude is linearly proportional to polymer mass. Third, as will be shown under “Discussion,” all of the polymerization rate data in this report fit a single linear plot. This finding by itself demonstrates that there is a linear correspondence between light scattering increment and polymer mass over a broad range of actin, profilin, and thymosin-β4 concentrations. Actin polymerization kinetics in the presence or absence of profilin and Tβ4 were analyzed with the KINSIM software (35Barshop A. Wrenn R.F. Frieden C. Anal. Chem. 1983; 130: 134-145Google Scholar) and fitted to experimental data with the Marquardt-Levant algorithm of FITSIM (36Zimmerle C.T. Frieden C. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Each individual run (i.e. each uninterrupted series of data points obtained from the fluorescence spectrometer in a single elongation experiment) could be fitted by a first-order reaction progress curve, and based on the deviation of the actual data points from individual exponential curves, we find that the range of experimental error in all light scattering data presented in this study was ±1.8%. Because error bars on each point would only tend to obscure the actual progress curve, we set the size of the symbols in each graph to correspond to ±2% of the overall amplitude. The reader will also note that some of the computer-generated progress curves presented within any one figure may actually deviate more than ±2% from the data for an individual run. The computer-generated curves presented in each plot are those returned by the KINSIM software based on a single set of rate constants applied globally to all of the data sets. This statistical treatment constitutes a far more rigorous test of the rate constants than simply analyzing individual runs with an adjustable set of rate constants. The proposal that profilin promotes filament assembly by stimulating irreversible ATP hydrolysis (21Pantaloni D. Carlier M.-F. Cell. 1993; 75: 1007-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) was based on the inability of experimentally derived equilibrium constants to yield a closed thermodynamic cycle. Such closed cycles (or “energy squares”) constitute valuable quantitative tests of models for binding interactions. If one can rigorously demonstrate the energy changes depend on the path taken around such a cycle, then there is prima facie evidence for the occurrence of one or more irreversible steps. Thus, the problem of actin polymerization in the simultaneous presence of thymosin-β4 and profilin reduces to a single question: are the constants that define actin elongation in the presence of profilin and thymosin-β4 consistent with a closed thermodynamic cycle? To answer this question, we have conducted a stepwise investigation: (a) beginning with the least complicated process, namely the barbed-end elongation of actin only (see Fig. 1 A); (b) proceeding next to examine actin polymerization in the presence of profilin (Fig. 1 B); (c) then, examining the effects of thymosin-β4 in the absence of profilin (Fig. 1 C); and (d) finally, evaluating elongation in the simultaneous presence of profilin and thymosin-β4 (Fig. 1 D). Previous investigators demonstrated that profilin binds more weakly to pyrenyl-actin than to unlabeled actin (9Lal A.A. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10132-10138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Tobacman L.S. Brenner S.L. Korn E.D. J. Biol.

De La Cruz E.M. Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10871-10880Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This behavior requires a series of calculations to correct all primary data to account for the differential affinity of profilin for unlabeled and labeled actin monomers. To assess the effects of profilin on actin filament assembly in the absence of this confounding effect, we employed right angle light scattering, which is a direct measure of polymer weight concentration. Light scattering is a useful means for studying actin polymerization (9Lal A.A. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10132-10138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Tobacman L.S.

Biol. 1974; 89: 755-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), especially when care is exercised to minimize protein aggregation or dust. The availability of highly stable, digitally controlled fluorescence spectrometers has greatly improved the sensitivity of 90° light scattering measurements. However, because pyrenyl-actin has become the standard polymerization assay method, we directly compared fluorescence and light scattering data to identify significant differences in ability of these two assays as quantitative measures of actin filament assembly. To initiate assembly only onto free barbed ends, we added Spectrin·4.1·Actin nuclei (final protein concentration, 29.5 μg/ml; estimated filament number concentration, 0.66 nm) to G-actin (2 μm) at a mole fraction of 0.6 pyrene-conjugated monomer. Simultaneous monitoring of fluorescence and light scattering intensity was achieved over 10-s intervals by switching from the fluorescence mode (365 nm excitation, 387 nm emission) to light-scattering mode (350 nm for both excitation and emission). The photon count rate (cps) was higher in the light scattering mode (see values presented in Fig. 2); however, when plotted as ΔF/ΔFmaximum or ΔLight-Scattering/ΔLight-Scatteringmaximum, both curves describe first-order processes with virtually identical rates and extents of elongation. Furthermore, the t 12 values were 98 and 103 s from fluorescence and light scattering, respectively. Slight differences between fluorescence and light scattering were only evident at the earliest time points and were without effect on the entire progress curve analysis. To characterize the elongation reaction shown in Fig. 1 A, we conducted experiments on filament assembly as a function of actin monomer concentration at a fixed concentration of Spectrin·4.1·Actin seeds. As expected, elongation kinetics were first order, and the rate and extent of polymerization depended on the initial G-actin concentration. The results presented in Fig. 3 were reproduced in three separate experiments. The rate of seeded assembly of actin at the barbed end obeys first-order kinetics as follows: v = [F n](k +1 [A] −k −1) = [F n]k +1([A] −k −1/k +1) =k obs ([A] − Ccritical), where Ccritical is the critical actin concentration (equal toK 1 ork −1/k +1 for the scheme shown in Fig. 1 A). The polymerization rate equals the product of k +1 and the concentration of polymerization-competent ends. The observed rate constant (kobs = k +1[F n]) was determined by fitting a first-order curve to the time course data using Origin software (Microcal Software, Inc., Northampton, MA). We setk +1 at 10 μm−1s−1, based self-consistent values obtained in earlier studies (12Pollard T.D. Cooper J.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6631-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 22Pring M. Weber A. Bubb M.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1827-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We estimated that the Spectrin·4.1·Actin concentration (i.e. [free barbed end] or [F n]) to be about 0.66 nm. Moreover, combined use of the FITSIM/KINSIM software permitted us to estimatek −1 at 0.3 s−1. The values ofk +1 and k −1 allowed us to obtain a value of 0.03 μm for the critical concentration (Ccritical or K 1) for the actin monomer interaction with the barbed ends. Finally, because the observed kinetics remain strictly first-order over the entire assembly time course, the polymer number concentration must not change appreciably. This finding suggests that all of the filaments remain assembly-competent and that little or no spontaneous nucleation occurred during the elongation measurements. To evaluate how profilin influences the rate and extent of polymerization, we obtained complete time courses for polymerization of 2 μm actin in the presence of 0, 0.7, 1.2, 2.0, 3.5, and 6.0 μm profilin (Fig. 4). With the aid of the KINSIM/FITSIM software, we simultaneously analyzed the data for all progress curves to extract self-consistent, global values for rate and equilibrium constants. As shown in Fig. 1 B, both A and P·A complex add to barbed ends by different routes, each resulting in net elongation. We began by usingk +1 = 10 × 106m−1 s−1 andk −1 = 0.3 s−1 for actin monomer addition to and release from the barbed end, respectively. We allowed the FITSIM program to determine the best-fit values by minimizing the sum of the squares of the deviations. This approach putk +2 at 10 × 106m−1 s−1,k −2 at 50 s−1,K 3 at 1.5 μm,k +4 at 5 × 106m−1 s−1, andk −4 at 1.25 × 103s−1. Furthermore, when 0.7–2 μm profilin (final concentration) was added to the actin solution, no significant change in the initial rate of assembly occurred, suggesting that profilin does not lower the critical concentration of barbed-end actin filament assembly (Fig. 4, inset). We next chose to analyze actin polymerization in the presence thymosin-β4 (see Fig. 1 C) for two reasons. First, the quantitative analysis is best accomplished when one analyzes all polymerization steps under identical experimental conditions, rather than relying on a range of literature values obtained by using other assays. Second, whereas Weber et al. (8Weber A. Nachmias V.T. Pennise R. Pring M. Safer D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6179-6185Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) reported that that thymosin-β4 acts exclusively as a monomer-sequestering protein, Carlier et al. (37Carlier M.-F.

To obtain the rate constants for Tβ4·Actin complex formation, we conducted polymerization experiments in"
https://openalex.org/W2009650205,"Activation of p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K) by growth factors requires multiple signal inputs involving phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), its effector Akt, and an unidentified kinase that phosphorylates Ser/Thr residues (Ser411, Ser418, Ser424, and Thr421) clustered at its autoinhibitory domain. However, the mechanism by which G protein-coupled receptors activate p70S6K remains largely uncertain. By using vascular smooth muscle cells in which we have demonstrated Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation through Ca2+-dependent, epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor transactivation by Gq-coupled angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor, we present a unique cross-talk required for Ser411 phosphorylation of p70S6K by Ang II. Both p70S6K Ser411 and Akt Ser473phosphorylation by Ang II appear to involve EGF receptor transactivation and were inhibited by dominant-negative Ras, whereas the phosphorylation of p70S6K and ERK but not Akt was sensitive to the MEK inhibitor. By contrast, the phosphorylation of p70S6K and Akt but not ERK was sensitive to PI3K inhibitors. Similar inhibitory pattern on these phosphorylation sites by EGF but not insulin was observed. Taken together with the inhibition of Ang II-induced p70S6K activation by dominant-negative Ras and the MEK inhibitor, we conclude that Ang II-initiated activation of p70S6K requires both ERK cascade and PI3K/Akt cascade that bifurcate at the point of EGF receptor-dependent Ras activation. Activation of p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K) by growth factors requires multiple signal inputs involving phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), its effector Akt, and an unidentified kinase that phosphorylates Ser/Thr residues (Ser411, Ser418, Ser424, and Thr421) clustered at its autoinhibitory domain.

This family of mRNAs encode many of the components of the translational apparatus, including ribosomal proteins and elongation factors. Thus, activation of p70S6K has long been thought to be a prerequisite to protein synthesis. Inhibition of the kinase activation suppresses cell growth and in some cell types blocks cell cycle progression (1Chou M.M. Blenis J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 806-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 2Pullen N. Thomas G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 3Avruch J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 31-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar).Activation of p70S6K appears to involve multiple signal inputs. The immunosuppressant rapamycin is the most potent inhibitor of p70S6K described, blocking its activation by all known agents (1Chou M.M. Blenis J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 806-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). It forms a gain-of-function inhibitory complex with FKBP12 that targets mTOR, a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)1-related family of protein kinases (4Thomas G. Hall M.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Because an mTOR mutant, which is unable to bind rapamycin-FKBP12, protects p70S6K activity in the presence of the inhibitor, it has been reasoned that mTOR is an upstream regulator of p70S6K (5Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). PI3K has also been implicated in the signal transduction of p70S6K activation (6Chung J. Grammer T.C. Lemon K.P. Kazlauskas A. Blenis J. Nature. 1994; 370: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Constitutively active PI3K alleles cause elevations in p70S6K activity, and the inhibitors of PI3K, wortmannin and LY294002, inhibit the activation of p70S6K by various agonists (1Chou M.M. Blenis J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 806-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 2Pullen N. Thomas G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 3Avruch J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 31-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The downstream effector of PI3K, Akt/ protein kinase B (PKB) mediates PI3K-dependent p70S6Kactivation. Oncogenic or membrane-targeted mutants of Akt activate p70S6K, which is blocked by rapamycin (7Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1872) Google Scholar, 8Kohn A.D. Takeuchi F. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21920-21926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Recently, phosphorylation and activation of mTOR by Akt was reported (9Scott P.H. Brunn G.J. Kohn A.D. Roth R.A. Lawrence J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7772-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar).Although mitogens that activate p70S6K simultaneously activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK/MAPK), p70S6K and the Ras/ERK cascade have since been shown to lie on distinct pathways (6Chung J. Grammer T.C. Lemon K.P. Kazlauskas A. Blenis J. Nature. 1994; 370: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 10Ballou L.M. Luther H. Thomas G.

Rapamycin inactivates p70S6K without having any discernible effects on ERK (6Chung J. Grammer T.C. Lemon K.P. Kazlauskas A. Blenis J. Nature. 1994; 370: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). A Ras mutant blocks activation of ERK but not p70S6K. Certain PDGF receptor mutants, which normally activate Ras, fail to activate p70S6K (11Ming X.F. Burgering B.M. Wennstrom S. Claesson W.L. Heldin C.H. Bos J.L. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Nature. 1994; 371: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). However, a recent study showed that a conditionally active Raf-1 mutant as well as a constitutively active MEK1 activates p70S6K in CCL39 fibroblasts (13Lenormand P. McMahon M. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15762-15768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Beside the ERK cascade, the small G proteins, Cdc42 and Rac1 (14Chou M.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1996; 85: 573-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and both conventional (6Chung J. Grammer T.C. Lemon K.P. Kazlauskas A. Blenis J. Nature. 1994; 370: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar) and atypical (15Akimoto K. Nakaya M. Yamanaka T. Tanaka J. Matsuda S. Weng Q.P. Avruch J. Ohno S. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) PKCs are also implicated in p70S6K activation.Along with the diversity in the activating pathways, a complex multisite phosphorylation, directed to different domains, are required for p70S6K activation (2Pullen N. Thomas G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 3Avruch J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 31-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of closely clustered Ser411, Ser418, Thr421, and Ser424, located within a pseudosubstrate autoinhibitory domain, is not sufficient for the kinase activation but seems to be a prerequisite for its activation (2Pullen N. Thomas G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 3Avruch J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 31-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Although each of these Ser/Thr residues are followed immediately by a proline residue and can be phosphorylated in vitro by an array of proline-directed kinases including ERK (16Mukhopadhyay N.K. Price D.J. Kyriakis J.M. Pelech S. Sanghera J. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3325-3335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in vivo requirement of these kinases has not been substantiated to date. The phosphorylation of Thr229 in the catalytic domain and Thr389 in the linker domain is stimulated by PI3K is inhibited by wortmannin and appears to be essential for the kinase activation (2Pullen N. Thomas G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 3Avruch J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 31-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). These sites are conserved in many members of Ser/Thr kinases including PKC and Akt/PKB. Recently, the phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase PDK1, which was originally identified as a Thr308kinase for Akt/PKB, has also been shown to phosphorylate the homologous site in p70S6K, Thr229 (17Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S.C. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 18Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), thus connecting a link between PI3K and p70S6K. Alternatively,in vitro phosphorylation of the Thr389 by mTOR has recently been demonstrated (19Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Taken together, it now appears likely that p70S6K activation requires a complex array of separate, concurrent phosphorylations at multiple sites catalyzed by several protein kinases. However, the precise mechanism of activation as well as the identity of the p70S6K kinases are yet largely unclear.Recently, rapid activation of p70S6K has been reported in rat balloon-injured arteries (20Koyama H. Olson N.E. Dastvan F.F. Reidy M.A. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 713-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and pressure-overloaded hearts (21Laser M. Kasi V.S. Hamawaki M. Cooper G. Kerr C.M. Kuppuswamy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24610-24619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), suggesting the significance of p70S6K as a potential therapeutic target in cardiovascular diseases. Angiotensin II (Ang II), a major effector peptide of the renin-angiotensin system, is now widely believed to play a critical role in vascular remodeling associated with hypertension, atherosclerosis, and restenosis after vascular injury (22Timmermans P.B.M.W.M. Wong P.C. Chiu A.T. Herblin W.F. Benfield P. Carini D.J. Lee R.J. Wexler R.R. Saye J.A.M. Smith R.D. Pharmacol. Rev. 1993; 45: 205-251PubMed Google Scholar). We and others have previously cloned the Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1), a heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) (23Sasaki K. Yamano Y. Bardhan S. Iwai N. Murray J.J. Hasegawa M. Matsuda Y. Inagami T. Nature. 1991; 351: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 24Murphy T.J. Alexander R.W. Griendling K.K. Runge M.S. Bernstein K.E. Nature. 1991; 351: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar) that not only mediates diverse hemodynamic effects of Ang II but also promotes hypertrophy and/or hyperplasia of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) (25Griendling K.K. Ushio-Fukai M. Lassegue B. Alexander R.W. Hypertension. 1997; 29: 366-373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Berk B.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: S62-S68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In VSMC, Gq-coupled AT1 activates phospholipase C, which initiates the generation of inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, causing intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and PKC activation, respectively (25Griendling K.K. Ushio-Fukai M. Lassegue B. Alexander R.W. Hypertension. 1997; 29: 366-373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, Ang II induces several signaling events commonly evoked by growth factor receptors, such as protein tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of ERK in VSMC (25Griendling K.K. Ushio-Fukai M. Lassegue B. Alexander R.W. Hypertension. 1997; 29: 366-373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Berk B.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: S62-S68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Inagami T. Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Motley E.D. Tang H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: S57-S61PubMed Google Scholar). Earlier studies from our laboratory indicate that a Ca2+-dependent tyrosine kinase may mediate Ang II-induced Ras and ERK activation in cultured VSMC (28Eguchi S. Matsumoto T. Motley E.D. Utsunomiya H. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14169-14175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we have shown that this mechanism involves the ligand-independent transactivation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) (29Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H.

J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar), little is known about the mechanism by which GPCRs activate p70S6K (33Wilson M. Burt A.R.

Here, we have presented several lines of evidence indicating that Ang II-induced p70S6K activation requires not only the PI3K/Akt cascade but also the ERK cascade, both of which exist downstream of the Ca2+-dependent EGFR transactivation and bifurcates at the level of Ras.DISCUSSIONThe major finding of this study is that Ang II-induced p70S6K activation in VSMC requires two parallel pathways that bifurcate at the point of EGFR-dependent Ras activation. One is the ERK cascade and the other may involve PI3K/Akt/mTOR. These data will provide new insight into the signaling mechanism by which Ang II contributes vascular hypertrophy.Although phosphorylation of the autoinhibitory domain of p70S6K is not sufficient for the kinase activation, recent studies have shown its ability to gain access of p70S6Kkinases such as PDK1 to sites whose phosphorylation are critical for p70S6K activation (2Pullen N.

The present study further extended this transactivation mechanism to GPCR (AT1)-induced Ser411 phosphorylation and subsequent activation of p70S6K. Although earlier studies demonstrated Ang II-induced PDGFR transactivation in VSMC (39Linseman D.A. Benjamin C.W. Jones D.A. J. Biol.

Indeed, GPCR-mediated PDGFR transactivation has recently been shown to occur only when the target cell lacks EGFR (52Herrlich A. Daub H. Knebel A. Herrlich P. Ullrich A. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc.

However, whether signals from these tyrosine kinases are sufficient to the activation of p70S6K remains to be determined.Several lines of evidence have indicated that ERK and p70S6K lie on separate signaling pathways (6Chung J.

Indeed, we observed that insulin induced Ser411phosphorylation of p70S6K without affecting Tyr204 phosphorylation of ERK in VSMC and the insulin-induced Ser411 phosphorylation was not inhibited by the MEK inhibitor PD98059. In CHO cells, PD98059 had no effect on Thr421/Ser424 phosphorylation of p70S6K in response to a Gi-coupled μ-opioid receptor stimulation (45Polakiewicz R.D. Schieferl S.M. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Comb M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23534-23541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In contrast, the present study clearly demonstrates that the Gq-coupled AT1-induced Ser411 phosphorylation and subsequent activation of p70S6K were prevented by PD98059 or the dominant-negative Ras. Consistent with our observation, others have indicated the involvement of a PD98059-sensitive kinase in insulin-induced p70S6K activation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes and CHO cells in which insulin activates ERK (62Scott P.H. Lawrence J.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In CCL39 fibroblasts, conditionally active Raf-1 stimulation resulted in rapid activation of both ERK and p70S6K (13Lenormand P. McMahon M. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15762-15768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Moreover, ERK2 efficiently phosphorylates a synthetic peptide with the amino acid sequence of the autoinhibitory domain of p70S6K in vitro (16Mukhopadhyay N.K. Price D.J. Kyriakis J.M. Pelech S. Sanghera J. Avruch J. J. Biol.

However, PD98059 dose not interfere with JNK or p38 MAPK both in vitro and in vivo (46Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

These changes are brought about by the action of a cell surface receptor coupled to specific G proteins that control morphology and motility through the action of a group of small GTPases, the Rho family of proteins. Many studies have focused on actin reorganization modulated by Rho-GTPases, but almost no information has been obtained concerning microtubular network reorganization after LPA-induced neurite retraction. In the present study, we demonstrate an increase in site-specific Alzheimer's disease-like Tau phosphorylation during LPA-induced neurite retraction in differentiated SY-SH5Y human neuroblastoma cells. The phosphorylation state of Tau was inferred from its immunoreactivity with antibodies that recognize phosphorylation-sensitive epitopes. The effects of specific kinase inhibitors indicate that this phosphorylation is mediated by glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3). In support of this idea, we observed an increase of GSK-3 activity upon growth cone collapse.

During development they integrate complex positive and negative extracellular signals and physically direct neurite outgrowth through the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics. Two major components of the cytoskeleton are involved in growth cone extension: actin microfilaments (MFs)1 and microtubules (MTs). In combination with molecular motors (kinesins, dyneins, and myosins), these mediate the processes of advance, cessation, turning, branching, etc. of neuronal extension. In opposing processes such as extension and retraction, MTs and MFs may be precisely coordinated. MFs appear to regulate the initial events of the growth cone tip and filopodia and lamellipodia progression, and in a second step MTs stabilize the extended neurite (1Tanaka E. Sabry J. Cell. 1995; 83: 171-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Microtubules are essential for neurite formation and maintenance. These structures are composed of tubulin and a variety of minor proteins denoted by microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). The level of MAPs and, more importantly, their phosphorylation level appear to modulate microtubule stability and dynamics (2Avila J. Dominguez J. Diaz-Nido J. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1994; 38: 13-25PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, Tau, one of the most abundant axonal MAPs, may play a key role in axonogenesis (3Caceres A. Kosick K. Nature. 1990; 343: 461-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 4Caceres A. Potrebic S. Kosick K. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 1515-1523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tau phosphorylation is developmentally regulated, being lower in adult than in fetal brain. Additionally,Tau hyperphosphorylation occurs in the aberrant structures known as paired helical filaments (PHFs) that appear in neuronal disorders such as Alzheimer's disease where these structures are a neuropathological hallmark (5Greenberg S.G. Davies P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5827-5831Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). The intracellular mechanisms that regulate neurite extension such as activation of the neurotrophin/neurotrophin receptor/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) pathway (6Lewin G.R. Barde Y.A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 289-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar) are better understood than those implicated in growth cone collapse and neurite retraction (7Moolenaar W. Kranenburg O. Postma R.F. Zondag G.C.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. (1997). 1996; 9–2: 168-173Google Scholar). Different groups of molecules that induce neurite retraction have been described (7Moolenaar W. Kranenburg O. Postma R.F. Zondag G.C.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. (1997). 1996; 9–2: 168-173Google Scholar, 8Kapfhammer J.P. Raper J. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 201-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Stahl B. Muller B. Von Boxberg Y. Cox E.C. Bonhoeffer F. Neuron. 1990; 5: 733-743Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Many of them, such as thrombin or LPA, may play a significant role in neuronal development (10Hecht J.H. Weiner L.A. Post R.S. Chun J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Several studies of neuronal cell lines have revealed that LPA and thrombin induce neurite retraction, through G protein-coupled receptors (11Jalink K. van Corven E.J. Hengeveld T. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 12Tigyi g. Fisscher D.J. Sebok A. Yang C. Dyer D.L. Mileddi R. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 537-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and the modulation of the activity of the small GTP-binding protein, Rho. These GTPases regulate many cellular processes, such as actomyosin-based contraction, actin and tubulin cytoskeleton organization, and cell shape (13Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 31-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar) and cell division in many non-neuronal cells (14Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). Depending on the cell type studied and the parameters measured, LPA initiates a wide range of transduction signals, not necessarily all of which are linked. For instance, three different G proteins have been implicated in the initial steps. One of these (Gα12/13) is located upstream of Rho and Rho-activated kinases and at least partially controls cytoskeletal organization (15Chuprun J.K. Raymond J.R. Blackshear P.J. J Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 773-781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The second GTP-binding protein (Gi) appears to be upstream of another set of kinases, such as phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3′-kinase) and members of the MAP kinase superfamily, that mediate trophic effects (7Moolenaar W. Kranenburg O. Postma R.F. Zondag G.C.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. (1997). 1996; 9–2: 168-173Google Scholar). The third heterotrimeric G protein (Gq) has been linked to the activation of phospholipases, resulting in protein kinase C activation and increasing intracellular calcium concentration (11Jalink K. van Corven E.J. Hengeveld T. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 16Jalink K. van Corven E.J. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12232-12239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Many studies have focused on actin reorganization modulated by Rho family proteins, but almost no information is available regarding how the microtubular network is reorganized after LPA-induced retraction. In the present study, using differentiated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, we describe that during LPA-induced neurite retraction there is an increase in site-specific Alzheimer's disease-like Tauphosphorylation. The state of Tau phosphorylation was inferred from its immunoreactivity with antibodies that recognize phosphorylation-sensitive epitopes. Our results using specific kinase inhibitors strongly support the hypothesis that this phosphorylation is mediated by GSK-3 β. Furthermore, in cell extracts from LPA-treated cells we observed an increase of GSK-3 activity associated with the neurite retraction. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the activation of GSK-3 kinase occurs in the Rho pathway and thus may constitute an important link between MT and MF dynamics. Lysophosphatidic acid (1-oleyl-9-(cis)-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3 phosphate) (LPA) was purchased from Sigma, and 1.3 mm stock solution was made in HEPES-buffered saline, 1 mm CaCl 2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1% bovine serum albumin. Dibutyryl-cyclic AMP (db-cAMP) (Sigma) was used at a final concentration of 1 mm. Genistein, LiCl, pertussis toxin (PTX), and okadaic acid, all from Sigma, were used at different concentrations as indicated below. Wortmannin, the p38 inhibitor SB203580, and the MAP kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059 were obtained from Research Biochemicals, Inc. Protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin) were purchased from Sigma. SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum containing glutamine (2 mm) and antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin). To obtain a neuronal-like phenotype, the medium was changed to Neurobasal supplemented with B-27 (NB-B27) containing db-cAMP (1 mm) in which cells were maintained for 48–72 h. To initiate neurite retraction the medium was changed to fresh NB-B27 without db-cAMP for 4 h, and then LPA (10 μm) was included. The effect was analyzed 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after the addition of LPA. Controls without LPA in which db-cAMP was maintained were followed simultaneously. To interfere with neurite retraction, the inhibitors PTX, genistein, db-cAMP, or wortmannin were added in combination with LPA treatment. Total RNA was purified from SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma; N2A, NIE-115, and NRK mouse neuroblastoma cells; NIH-3T3, a mouse fibroblast cell line; and from primary cultures of astrocytes (kindly supplied by Dr. Gema Alvarez) (17Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 16: 156-159Crossref Scopus (63191) Google Scholar). For Northern blot analysis, RNA (5 μg/lane) was electrophoresed in formaldehyde-agarose gels and blotted onto nylon membranes by a positive pressure system (Stratagene). The RNA was cross-linked to the nylon filter by UV (Strata-linker). The hybridization was performed with 32P-labeled EDG-2 c-DNA, in a solution containing 7.5× SSC, 50% formamide in phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7) with t-RNA and salmon sperm DNA as carriers. The filters were incubated in this solution with the DNA probes at 42 °C. To remove32P-labeled probe, filters were washed successively with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min and 0.1× SSC, 0.5% SDS for 30 min and were then exposed. For RT-PCR, RNA (5 μg) of each cell line was reverse-transcribed with specific primers: EDG-2 primers, gtcaaccgccgcttccattt (forward) and ctgtagaggggtgccatgtt (reverse); these primers should produce a 351-bp specific product; and EDG-4 primers, caatctgctggtcatagcag (forward) and actactgttgtcagaactgg (reverse), which should produce a 590-bp-specific product (18Fischer D.J. Liliom K. Guo Z. Nusser N. Virag T. Murakami-Murofushi K. Kobayashi S. Erickson J.R. Sun G. Miller D.D. Tigyi G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). One microliter of each reverse transcription reaction were used in the PCR reactions (35 cycles). The amplifications were performed basically with the following protocol: 35 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 54 °C for 1 min, and 65 °C for 2 min. The PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose gel, transferred to nylon, and hybridized with the cDNA probe corresponding to EDG-2 (vzg-1). Monoclonal antibody against β3 tubulin (1:1000) and acetyl-tubulin (1:300) were purchased from Sigma. Tau monoclonal antibodies PHF-1 (1:30) were kindly supplied by Dr. P. Davies (Albert Einstein Coll, Bronx, NY), andTau-1 (1:1000) was a kind gift of Dr. L. Binder (MGC, Chicago, IL). Using the residue numbering of the 441-amino acid humanTau isoform (19Welsh G.I. Patel J.C. Proud C.G. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 244: 16-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody Tau-1 recognizes the protein when serines 195, 198, 199, and 202 are dephosphorylated, and PHF-1 recognized the serines 396 and 404 when they are in the phosphorylated form. Additionally, F-actin was visualized with phalloidin-fluorescein (1:400). Cell extracts were prepared from semi-confluent differentiated SH-SY5Y. Cells were washed with 1× PBS and were then resuspended in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm sodiumortho-vanadate, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and 10 μg/ml pepstatin) and disrupted with a Polytron homogenizer. The soluble fraction was obtained by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Proteins (25–50 μg total) were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose filter. Nitrocellulose sheets were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T). The nitrocellulose was then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Filters were rinsed three times in PBS-T buffer and then incubated with the corresponding peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (diluted 1:5000, Promega) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactivity was visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Densitometric analysis was performed on different Western blot lanes (three replicates) and the data processed with an imaging densitometer (GS-6470 model, Bio-Rad). Data were analyzed with Molecular Analyst software. The densitometric values were normalized with respect to the values obtained for a control antibody to correct for any variations in the amounts of total loaded protein. GSK-3 assays were carried out essentially as described previously (18Fischer D.J. Liliom K. Guo Z. Nusser N. Virag T. Murakami-Murofushi K. Kobayashi S. Erickson J.R. Sun G. Miller D.D. Tigyi G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were prepared from neuroblastoma cells at different times after the initiation of the growth cone collapse, and from control cells. Cells were collected with a cell scraper and homogenized in a buffer of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium ortho-vanadate, 5 mm EDTA, 100 nm okadaic acid, with protease inhibitors (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin). The soluble fraction was obtained after centrifugation at 13,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. Samples of 5 μg of protein were incubated in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm MgCl2 with a specific glycogen synthase substrate peptide (20Glass D.B. Masaracchia R.A. Feramisco J.R. Kemp B.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 566-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) at a final concentration of 0.75 mg/ml in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. After 1 h, the reaction was stopped by boiling, and the activity was quantified by spotting aliquots on P81 phosphocellulose paper. The difference between the kinase activity in the presence or absence of 20 mm LiCl (21Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar) was considered to be a measure of GSK-3 protein kinase activity. After treatments, cell cultures were fixed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing paraformaldehyde (4%) for 30 min. After several washes with PBS, the cells were pre-incubated in PBS, containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% fetal calf serum, for 30 min. After a brief wash with PBS, they were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies, diluted in PBS, containing 1% fetal calf serum and 0.1% Triton X-100. Following incubation with the primary antibody, cultures were extensively washed and then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody, conjugated either with fluorescein or Texas-red (Jackson Laboratories) for 45 min. After washing, they were immediately mounted with Fluoromount, examined, and photographed under a Labophot (Nikon) or Axiophot (Zeiss) microscope. Initially, we characterized the neuronal-like phenotype of SH-SY5Y after db-cAMP treatment. The differentiated phenotype was obtained after addition of this cAMP analog (1 mm) in the serum-free NB-B27 culture medium. The neuron-like phenotype was quite apparent 12 h after incubation. Characterization of the cytoplasmic extensions in these differentiated cells indicated that they are MAP1B-positive and Tau-positive, which is indicative of axon-like processes (data not shown). After db-cAMP treatment, differentiated cells were incubated in the presence of 10 μm LPA, and cell morphology was analyzed at different times after addition. Before the LPA treatment more than 95% of the differentiated cells showed processes. Neurite retraction was time-dependent, and the extended process was almost completely reduced 1–2 h after LPA addition. At this time, 80–90% of cells were rounded and showed no cytoplasmic extensions. The analysis of tubulin and the actin network during the neurite retraction process showed that the polymerized actin is promptly disorganized 15 min after LPA addition. At this time, the reorganization of microtubules was not so evident. However, 60 min after LPA addition, tubulin was no longer present in the axon-like extension but had accumulated in the cell body (Fig. 1, B and C), clearly correlating with the morphological retraction. The addition of LPA to differentiated SH-SY5Y cells induced an neurite retraction in a concentration-dependent manner. The retraction is detectable at a concentration as low as 10 nm(data not shown), being maximal at 5–10 μ M (Fig. 1). To characterize the involvement of a specific receptor in this response to LPA, we analyzed the expression in SH-SY5Y of the prototypical members of the LPA G protein-coupled receptors, EDG-2/vzg-1 and EDG-4 (22Goetzl E.J. Songzhu A. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). RT-PCR with specific primers for EDG-2 and EDG-4 were performed with different neuroblastoma cell lines, as well as with NIH-3T3 as an EDG-2-positive control (18Fischer D.J. Liliom K. Guo Z. Nusser N. Virag T. Murakami-Murofushi K. Kobayashi S. Erickson J.R. Sun G. Miller D.D. Tigyi G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The RT-PCR reaction showed the presence of similar products in SH-SY5Y and NIH-3T3, with the predictable size of 351 bp. However, the expected EDG-4 product of 590 bp was not detectable in SH-SY5Y but was detectable in NIE-115 cells (Fig. 2 A). To fully confirm the presence of EDG-2 in SH-SY5Y, the RT-PCR products were transferred to a nylon filter, and the blot was hybridized with the 32P-labeled cDNA probe of EDG-2 (Fig. 2 B). In the same way, the Northern blot analysis of RNA samples from SH-SY5Y and NRK neuroblastomas, from NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, and from primary astrocytes showed the presence of a 3.8-kilobase EDG-2 mRNA in all cells lines. However, the amount of the EDG-2 mRNA in SH-SY5Y appears to be 5–10 times lower than in 3T3 cells. (Fig. 2 C). Biochemically, neurite retraction may be the opposite of neurite outgrowth. Also, one of the most important elements that mediates the stability of microtubules is the phosphorylation level of MAPs (23Mandell J. Banker G. Neurobiol. Aging. 1996; 16: 229-237Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Taking these facts into account, we tested the phosphorylation level of Tau protein present in the differentiated SH-SY5Y and analyzed how it is modified during the process of neurite retraction. LPA-treated cells were obtained at different times during the retraction process. Cell extracts were analyzed by Western blot using antibodies that recognized specifically phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated Tau epitopes, as described previously (24Muñoz-Montaño J.R. Moreno F.J. Avila J. Diaz-Nido J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The LPA treatment results in a site-specific phosphorylation ofTau, as confirmed by the increase of PHF-1 immunoreactivity, which reached its highest level 60 min after LPA addition and then decreased (Fig. 3 A). This phosphorylation increase was evident when compared with the total amount of Tau or of tubulin (Fig. 3 A). The data from three independent experiments showed a 2–2.5-fold increase of PHF-1 immunoreactivity, 60 min after addition, when densitometric data was referred to the total amount of Tau or to the total amount of β tubulin (Fig. 3 B). The decrease of PHF-1 immunoreactivity without an appreciable decrease of Tau protein suggested the presence of a phosphatase activity. To confirm this hypothesis, we performed similar LPA-induced neurite retraction experiments in the presence of 400 nmokadaic acid. The addition of okadaic acid 60 min after LPA treatment not only blocked the decrease of PHF-1 immunoreactivity but even increased the phosphorylation level of Tau from 60 to 120 min (Fig. 3 C). The Western blot and the quantitative data from these blots showed that the phosphorylation level at 120 min is almost four times higher than the control level. Different transduction signaling pathways have been described as being initiated by LPA binding to its receptor(s). Three different G proteins, one of them PTX-sensitive, have been described (see the Introduction) as being coupled to the LPA receptor. We found that the addition of PTX (50 or 100 ng/ml) before or during the retraction process did not modify the collapse. The analysis of Tau protein phosphorylation, using the antibody PHF-1, showed no significant differences between treatment (PTX plus LPA) or control (LPA alone) (Fig. 3, left), except thatTau phosphorylation did not peak in the presence of PTX 60 min after LPA treatment but continued to increase after 120 min (Fig. 4). The quantitative data from different Western blots for PHF-1 immunoreactivity with respect to the amount of tubulin indicated a 3-fold increase over the treatment with PTX alone. Additionally, many protein kinases, such as protein kinase A, PI3′-kinase, or tyrosine kinase(s), have been implicated in the regulation of LPA-activated pathway(s) (7Moolenaar W. Kranenburg O. Postma R.F. Zondag G.C.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. (1997). 1996; 9–2: 168-173Google Scholar). We analyzed the LPA-induced neurite retraction and the level of LPA-mediated Tauphosphorylation after modifying these kinases, adding db-cAMP to activate protein kinase A, wortmannin to inhibit PI3′-kinase, or genistein to inhibit cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases. The addition of db-cAMP (2 mm) or the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (100 μm) 30 min before LPA addition is known (for review see Ref. 7Moolenaar W. Kranenburg O. Postma R.F. Zondag G.C.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. (1997). 1996; 9–2: 168-173Google Scholar) to prevent growth cone collapse and neurite retraction by maintaining the neuron-like phenotype (data not shown). Our biochemical data confirm that the LPA-induced increment in the phosphorylation level of Tau protein, using the antibody PHF-1, was blocked by db-cAMP (data not shown) or genistein (Fig. 4,right) treatments. Thus, the addition of these compounds also correlated with the inhibition of neurite retraction. On the contrary, the addition of wortmannin (100 nm) neither altered the collapse nor modified the LPA-induced phosphorylation pattern produced by PHF-1 antibody (Fig. 4,center). The reaction of Tau protein with PHF-1 antibody is increased in Alzheimer's disease pathology, and three main kinases (GSK-3, MAP kinases, and stress kinases) have been implicated in its phosphorylation (25Ishiguro K. Avila J. Brandt R. Kosick K. Brain Microtubules Associated Proteins. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1996: 73-93Google Scholar). We determined the possible role of these kinases in Tau phosphorylation during neurite retraction. To establish whether one of these kinases is responsible forTau phosphorylation by LPA, we used three compounds that specifically inhibit the mentioned kinases. LiCl for GSK-3 (21Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar), the inhibitor SB203580 for stress kinase p38, and the inhibitor of MAP kinase kinase, PD98059. Treatment of differentiated cells with LiCl (20 mm) 2 h before LPA addition partially prevented neurite collapse (data not shown) and almost completely prevented the reaction with PHF-1 antibody (Fig. 5 A). That this happens because of dephosphorylation of Tau is corroborated by the increase of Tau-1 immunoreactivity (Fig. 5 B). Kinase inhibition by LiCl was specific, since addition of an identical concentration of NaCl as an osmotic control had no effect on the phosphorylation state of Tau (data not shown). Furthermore, the effect appears to be specific for GSK-3 because the inhibition of stress kinase p38 with SB203580 (25 μm), or that of MAP kinase kinase with PD98059 (100 μm), showed no differences from that observed with LPA treatment in the absence of these drugs, except that after MAP kinase inhibition, Tauphosphorylation did not peak at 60 min after treatment but continued to increase after 120 min (Fig. 5 A). The fact thatTau immunoreactivity increased with PHF-1 antibody after LPA treatment, in combination with the observed inhibition of this specific phosphorylation by LiCl, strongly suggests that GSK-3 activity is increased after LPA addition. To test this hypothesis directly, GSK-3 activity was measured in cell extracts obtained after LPA addition, using a specific peptide as a GSK-3 substrate. Data from three experiments showed that the GSK-3 specific activity increased 6–7-fold 30 min after LPA addition. This increase was maintained around 5-fold from 60 min to 120 min after addition (Fig. 6). No differences were detected in the total amount of the GSK-3 protein, as indicated by the Western blot (Fig. 5). The present study has focused on the analysis of how the microtubular network is reorganized after LPA-induced neurite retraction. We initially characterized the LPA receptor(s) that are present in SH.SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. From the prototypical EDG family proteins, two receptors have been specifically associated with LPA, EDG-2/vzg-1 and EDG-4 (22Goetzl E.J. Songzhu A. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Our data from RT-PCR showed the presence of a fragment corresponding to EDG-2 receptor with its predicted size of 351 bp (18Fischer D.J. Liliom K. Guo Z. Nusser N. Virag T. Murakami-Murofushi K. Kobayashi S. Erickson J.R. Sun G. Miller D.D. Tigyi G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This fact was fully confirmed by the hybridization with the EDG-2 cDNA and by Northern blot. On the other hand, EDG-4 was not detected in our cell line although it has been observed in other mouse neuroblastoma lines. Our data from Northern blot analysis showed the presence of the EDG-2 mRNA with the same size as that of control cells (NIH-3T3). From these results we conclude that at least the EDG-2 LPA receptor is expressed in SH-SY5Y cells. In addition, the presence of other LPA receptors, such as the PSP24-like members, can not yet be discarded. In our differentiated neuroblastoma cells, as in primary neurons, microtubule dynamics are largely determined by the polymerization capacity of tubulin modulated by the specific tubulin-binding capacity of each MAP. This tubulin-stabilizing capacity of MAPs in turn appears to be regulated by their phosphorylation level (2Avila J. Dominguez J. Diaz-Nido J. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1994; 38: 13-25PubMed Google Scholar, 23Mandell J. Banker G. Neurobiol. Aging. 1996; 16: 229-237Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To establish whether the phosphorylation level of MAPs plays a key role during the retraction process, we used differentiated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells as a model system. We studied Tau phosphorylation levels because it is the most abundant MAP in the mature axon, and it may play an essential role not only in neurite outgrowth but specifically in axon elongation (3Caceres A. Kosick K. Nature. 1990; 343: 461-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 4Caceres A. Potrebic S. Kosick K. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 1515-1523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated in vitro that Tauphosphorylation influences tubulin binding capacity and affects tubulin polymerization capacity and microtubule dyn"

We demonstrate that this cleavage occurs via a hairpin intermediate. The first step is a 3′ hydrolytic nick by transposase. The free 3′OH then attacks the phosphodiester bond on the opposite strand, forming a hairpin at the transposon end. In addition to forming precise hairpins, Tn5 transposase can form imprecise hairpins. This is the first example of imprecise hairpin formation on transposon end DNA. To undergo strand transfer, the hairpin must to be resolved by a transposase-catalyzed hydrolytic cleavage. We show that both precise and imprecise hairpins are opened by transposase. A transposition mechanism utilizing a hairpin intermediate allows a single transposase active site to cleave both 3′ and 5′ strands without massive protein/DNA rearrangements.

Transposition is one of the ways by which these rearrangements occur. The transposon Tn5 is a 5.8-kilobase pair prokaryotic, composite transposon consisting of two inverted repeats, IS50L and IS50R, that flank genes encoding antibiotic resistance. IS50R codes for the Tn5transposase (Tnp), the protein catalyzing all the steps in transposition. Each IS50 repeat is bracketed by two different 19-bp1 end sequences, termed the outside end (OE) and the inside end (IE), that are specifically recognized by Tn5 transposase (Fig. 1) (reviewed in Refs. 1Berg D.E. Howe M.M. Mobile DNA. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1989: 185-210Google Scholar and 2Reznikoff W.S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 945-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transposition of the full Tn5 element requires two OEs, whereas transposition of an IS50 element requires one OE and one IE.In vitro, Tn5 transposition requires only a hyperactive mutant transposase, such as EK54/LP372 Tnp, Mg2+, transposon DNA defined by two inverted 19-bp end sequences, and target DNA (3Goryshin I.Y. Reznikoff W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7367-7374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Transposition frequency can be increased by using the mosaic end sequence (ME), a hyperactive, synthetic end sequence that is a hybrid of the OE and IE (Fig. 1) (4Zhou M. Bhasin A. Reznikoff W.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 913-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Tn5 is a member of the “cut and paste” family of transposons that includes Tn10 and Tn7. Although the transposition reactions vary in details, they follow the same basic mechanism. Transposase binds to the transposon DNA at the end recognition sequences. Then, the end sequences are brought together via transposase oligomerization to form a complex nucleoprotein structure, 2A. Bhasin, I. Y. Goryshin, M. Steiniger-White, D. York, and W. S. Reznikoff, manuscript in preparation. termed a synaptic complex (5Mizuuchi M. Baker T.A. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1992; 70: 303-311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 6Sakai J. Chalmers R.M. Kleckner N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4374-4383Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Once a stable synaptic complex has been formed, the transposon end sequence-donor DNA boundary can be cleaved to release a pair of 3′OHs at the ends, which are then used in the next chemical step, strand transfer (Fig. 2 A). Strand transfer occurs via a one step transesterification (7Mizuuchi K. Adzuma K. Cell. 1991; 66: 129-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 8Mizuuchi K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1011-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) in which the 3′OHs attack phosphodiester bonds in the target DNA in a staggered fashion. For Tn5, the staggered attack leads to 9-bp gaps flanking the integrated transposon. The gaps are presumed to be filled in and ligated in the cell, and this leads to 9-bp duplications of the target sequence flanking the transposon (9Sasakawa C. Uno Y. Yoshikawa M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1981; 182: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 10Syvanen M. Hopkins J.D. Clements M. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 158: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In replicative transposition, the strand transfer product is a cointegrate, which is processed by DNA replication (11Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1983; 35: 785-794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The cleavage step differentiates cut and paste transposition from replicative transposition. In replicative transposons, such as phage Mu, only the 3′ end of the transposon is nicked to release a 3′OH, whereas the 5′ end remains covalently joined to donor DNA (7Mizuuchi K. Adzuma K. Cell. 1991; 66: 129-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). On the other hand, both the 3′ and 5′ ends of cut and paste transposons are cleaved from the flanking donor DNA. The Tn5 transposon is excised from the donor DNA by flush double strand breaks precisely at the end sequences (3Goryshin I.Y. Reznikoff W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7367-7374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), as is Tn10 (12Morisato D. Kleckner N. Cell. 1984; 39: 181-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Tn7 is excised with three-nucleotide 5′ overhangs (13Bainton R. Gamas P. Craig N.L. Cell. 1991; 65: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In this study, we examine how these double strand breaks arise. Previous work on Tn10 showed that the 3′ and 5′ nicks did not occur simultaneously, but rather were sequential with the 3′ nick preceding the 5′ nick (14Bolland S. Kleckner N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7814-7818Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In addition, in Mu, a single transposase active site carries out all the chemical steps (cleavage and strand transfer) at one end sequence (15Namgoong S.-Y. Harshey R. M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3775-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Similarly, in Tn10, evidence suggests that a single transposase active site can also carry out all chemical steps at one end (16Bolland S. Kleckner N. Cell. 1996; 84: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Like Tn10 transposase, Tn5transposase is a single polypeptide chain. It is difficult to imagine how a single active site can cleave both the 3′ and 5′ ends of a transposon without major conformational changes in the transposase and/or DNA. This is commonly known as the polarity problem. Tn7 has bypassed this problem by having its transposase made up of two polypeptides, TnsA and TnsB. TnsB contains the active site responsible for 3′ nicking, whereas TnsA contains the active site for 5′ nicking (17Sarnovsky R.J. May E.W. Craig N.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6348-6361Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). V(D)J recombination, an antigen receptor recombination system mechanistically similar to transposition, bypasses this polarity problem by going through a hairpin intermediate (18McBlane J.F. van Gent D.C. Ramsden D.A. Romeo C. Cuomo C.A. Gellert M. Oettinger M.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 387-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). It has recently been found that the Tn10 reaction also proceeds via a hairpin intermediate (19Kennedy A.K. Guhathakurta A. Kleckner N. Haniford D.B. Cell. 1998; 95: 125-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The model for cleavage via a hairpin is as follows. The first cleavage step is a 3′ hydrolytic nick by transposase at the end sequence. The free 3′OH attacks the 5′ end, forming a hairpin at the transposon end and releasing the flanking donor DNA. In order to undergo strand transfer, the hairpin needs to be resolved. The hairpin is hydrolytically cleaved by transposase in a step chemically identical to the first cleavage step, 3′ nicking. Cleavage of the hairpin frees a 3′OH. This 3′OH joins to target DNA in a strand transfer reaction chemically similar to the hairpin formation step (Fig. 2 B). Note that this mechanism utilizes only two repetitive chemistries, nicking and strand transfer. Furthermore, this model allows for a single transposase active site to perform all the necessary chemical steps without having to undergo a large conformational change, thus relieving the polarity problem. Using short, radiolabeled transposon end-containing DNAs in thein vitro Tn5 cleavage assay, we studied the cleavage step in Tn5 transposition. Our results demonstrate that Tn5 transposes via a hairpin intermediate. Hairpin formation is essential for blunt end cleavage of the transposon. Preformed hairpins can be cleaved to form a blunt-ended transposon. Imprecise hairpins can also be formed and cleaved, although less efficiently. Cleavage of the imprecise hairpin leads to precise 3′ end exposure. This finding of imprecise hairpin formation and resolution on the transposon end is novel. Lastly, position 1 of the end sequence is required for efficient hairpin formation. DNA substrates were 5′ end-labeled using T4 Polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and [γ-32P]ATP (DuPont, Redivue). Oligonucleotides were annealed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl by heating at 65 °C for 10 min and then cooling the reaction at room temperature. EK54/LP372 transposase was purified using the IMPACT T7 one-step protein purification system (New England Biolabs). The expression vector pGRTYB35 contains the transposase gene linked to the chitin binding domain through an intein. It was created by digesting pGRTEMP2 (3Goryshin I.Y. Reznikoff W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7367-7374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) with BglII, filling in with Sequenase, and digesting with BspHI. The resulting 1.5-kilobase pair transposase gene fragment was agarose gel-purified and ligated into the large NcoI-SmaI fragment of pTYB4 (NEB). PGRTYB35 was transformed into the strain ER2566 (NEB). These cells were grown to an A 600 of 0.5, and were then induced with 100 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration) for 5 h at room temperature (23 °C). Cells were harvested and resuspended in 20 ml (for 1 liter cell culture) of TEGX (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.7 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were sonicated, and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation. Cleared lysate was loaded onto a chitin (NEB) column (10 ml of column resin/1 liter of cell culture). The column was washed with 20 column volumes of TEGX, flushed with 3 column volumes of TEGX containing 50 mmdithiothreitol, and then left overnight at 4 °C. Protein was eluted from the column with TEGX, and transposase was collected in the first 10 ml of eluate. The EK54/LP372 transposase was determined to be at least 95% pure by SDS-PAGE analysis and Coomassie staining. Aliquots of 0.4 μg/μl, determined by Bradford assay, were stored at −70 C. A 5′ end-labeled single-stranded oligonucleotide was used to assay for 3′–5′ exonuclease activity in the EK54/LP372 transposase preparation and in a catalytically inactive mutant transposase preparation. 3T. A. Naumann and W. S. Reznikoff, manuscript in preparation. A weak single base ladder (up to 9 bases) of DNA degradation products was detected for both protein preparations (data not shown). The substrate used in many of the in vitro cleavage reactions (Figs. 3 A and4) was made by annealing two complementary 53-base mosaic end (the mosaic end is shown in boldface letters) containing oligonucleotides (40-base transposon and 13-base donor DNA) 5′-ACATGCATGCTCACTCACTCAAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGTCGACCTGCAGGG-3′ and 5′-CCCTGCAGGTCGACTGTCTCTTATACACATCTTGAGTGAGTGAGCATGCATGT-3′ (Research Genetics, PAGE-purified).FIG. 4The 80-base species is a hairpin with two mosaic ends head to head. The 80-base hairpin DNA was isolated from a denaturing polyacrylamide gel and subjected to Maxam-Gilbert A+G sequencing (lane 3). The individual strands of the substrate DNA were also sequenced (lanes 1 and 2). The sequencing reactions were electrophoresed on a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. A few bases of the mosaic end DNA (ME) are marked.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In vitro cleavage reactions consisted of radiolabeled mosaic end DNA (see legends to Figs. 3 and 6), 377 nm EK54/LP372 transposase, 0.1 m potassium glutamate, 25 mmTris acetate, pH 7.5, 10 mm Mg2+ acetate, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 μg/ml tRNA in a total of 20 μl. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for various times (see figure legends). Reactions were stopped by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation in the presence of 20 μg of glycogen. Reactions were resuspended in water, and an equivalent volume of formamide loading buffer (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.76Google Scholar) was added. Reactions were then boiled for 5 min and electrophoresed through 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Gels were visualized and quantitated with a phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics). Putative hairpin DNA generated from in vitro cleavage reactions was excised from 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The excised DNA was eluted in TE buffer, (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) (Fig. 4), or in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl (Fig. 3 B) overnight at 4 °C. The eluate was ethanol precipitated in the presence of glycogen and resuspended in water. This DNA was then either electrophoresed through a 15% native gel (Fig. 3 B) or subjected to Maxam-Gilbert A+G chemical sequencing (Fig. 4) (21Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9015) Google Scholar). To clone the hairpin, a 53-base oligonucleotide containing the mosaic end (in boldface), the −35 region of the tetracycline promoter (in italics), and a 4-bpEcoRI overhang at the 5′ end: 5′-AATTTTATCTGTCAA GATGTGTATAAGAGACAGTGTTGGGAGCTCGAACTGAG-3′ was annealed to a 48-base oligonucleotide containing the mosaic end, the −35 region of the tetracycline promoter, and a 4-bpAatII overhang at the 3′ end: 5′-CTCAGTTCGAGCTCCCAACACTGTCTCTTATACACATCT TGACAACGT-3′ (Integrated DNA Technologies, PAGE-purified) to form the substrate. Some of this substrate was 5′ end-labeled, whereas some was phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase and ATP. An in vitro cleavage reaction was done with 1.5 nmradiolabeled substrate and 73.5 nm phosphorylated substrate (reaction conditions described above). Aliquots were taken at 10, 20, and 30 min. Reactions were stopped and loaded on a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The hairpins were isolated from the gel and eluted in TE. Eluates were pooled, ethanol-precipitated in the presence of glycogen, and resuspended in water. The cloning vector used was pGREC1. pGREC1 was created by digesting pBR322 with EcoRI and ClaI, filling in with Sequenase, and ligation with T4 DNA ligase (Promega). pGREC1 is missing the −35 region of the tetracycline promoter, but contains anEcoRI site followed by the −10 region of the tetracycline promoter. The plasmid was purified using the QIAfilter Maxi kit. pGREC1 was digested with AatII and EcoRI (Promega), and the large fragment (4261-bp) was agarose gel-purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit. The isolated hairpin (with AatII andEcoRI sites) was ligated as a single strand into the pGREC1AatII/EcoRI large fragment using T4 DNA ligase. The ligation was dialyzed and electroporated into DH5α cells. The transformation was plated onto agar containing tetracycline (15 μg/ml). Plasmid DNA from colonies was isolated by an alkaline lysis miniprep protocol and dideoxy sequenced according to the protocol of Goryshin and Reznikoff (3Goryshin I.Y. Reznikoff W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7367-7374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). A 40-μl in vitro cleavage reaction consisting of 71.5 nm radiolabeled 53-base mosaic end and 377 nm EK54/LP372 transposase (reaction conditions described above) was incubated at 37 °C. 2.5-μl aliquots were taken at 0, 5, 10, 15, 25, 35, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120, and 150 min. The reactions were stopped by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 12.2 mm and keeping the aliquots on ice. After all of the time points were taken, all aliquots were subjected to phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation in the presence of glycogen. Reactions were resuspended in 50% formamide loading dye, boiled for 5 min, and electrophoresed through 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Gels were visualized with a phosphorimager. Imprecise and precise hairpins were made by annealing self-complementary oligonucleotides containing head-to-head mosaic ends (in boldface), the −35 region of the tetracycline promoter (in italics, overlapping the mosaic end) and a PmlI restriction site as a 5′ overhang. The hairpin junctions are underlined. The 50-base precise hairpin is 5′-CACGTGTTGACA TGTGTATAAGAGACAGCTGTCTCTTATACACATGTCAA-3′, and the 51-base imprecise hairpin is 5′-CACGTGTTGACA TGTGTATAAGAGACAGACTGTCTCTTATACACATGTCAA-3′ (Integrated DNA Technologies, PAGE-purified). These annealed oligonucleotides were used as substrates in an in vitrocleavage reaction. These oligonucleotides were also used to recover strand transfer products. The precise or imprecise hairpin oligonucleotide was phosphorylated with T4 Polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and ATP. The phosphorylated hairpins were then reacted in vitro with EK54/LP372 transposase and the plasmid pGREC1 as target DNA. The reaction conditions were as described above except with 750 nm EK54/LP372 Tnp, 4.8 pmol of hairpin DNA, and 0.04 pmol of pGREC1. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Insertion by transposition of two cleaved hairpins into pGREC1 leads to linearization of the plasmid. The linearized plasmid was recircularized by ligation of the two PmlI restriction sites with T4 DNA ligase (Promega). Upon ligation, the tetracycline resistance gene of pGREC1 was activated because the inserted transposon provided the −35 region of the promoter. Note that in these substrates, position 18 of the mosaic end was changed from a C to a G to accommodate a properly spaced −35 region. This base change had no effect on substrate activity (data not shown). The ligation mixture was dialyzed, transformed by electroporation into DH5α cells, and plated onto agar containing tetracycline (15 μg/ml). Plasmid DNA from colonies was isolated and dideoxy-sequenced. For the dideoxy experiment, we used four oligonucleotides: 20-mer, 5′-TGTTGGGAGCTCGAACTGAG-3′; 39-mer, 5′-ACATGCATGCTCACTCACTCAAGATGTGTATAAGAGACA-3′; 40-mer, 5′-ACATGCATGCTCACTCACTCAAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG-3′; and 60-mer, 5′-CTCAGTTCGAGCTCCCAACACTGTCTCTTATACACATCTTGAGTGAGTGAGCATGCATGT-3′ (all Integrated DNA Technologies, PAGE-purified). The 39-mer, 40-mer and 60-mer contained the mosaic end (shown in boldface) and were all 5′ end-labeled. A ddGTP was added to the 3′ end of some of the labeled 39-mer by terminal transferase. The reaction consisted of 0.5 μm radiolabeled 39-mer, 5 μm ddGTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 20 units of terminal transferase (Promega) and was incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. The reaction was heat-inactivated at 65 °C, ethanol-precipitated in the presence of glycogen, and resuspended in water. The 39ddGTP was then tailed with dNTPs and terminal transferase. This reaction consisted of 0.58 μm 39ddGTP, 15 μm each dNTP and 20 units of terminal transferase. This reaction product plus the other labeled oligonucleotides were ethanol precipitated, electrophoresed on a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel for purification, and visualized by autoradiography. The oligonucleotides were isolated from the gel and eluted in TE. The eluates were ethanol precipitated in the presence of glycogen and DNA concentrations were determined by scintillation counting. The DNA substrates were assembled by annealing oligonucleotides. Annealing of the 60-mer, 20-mer, and 39-mer formed the substrate 39dA. Annealing of the 60-mer, 20-mer, and 40-mer formed the substrate 40dG, whereas annealing of the 60-mer, 20-mer, and 39ddGTP formed the 40ddG substrate. The final concentrations of the annealed substrates were 0.027 pmol/μl. These substrates were then used in in vitro cleavage reactions consisting of 2.65 nm substrate DNA, 377 nm EK54/LP372 transposase, 5 mg/ml tRNA, 0.1 m potassium glutamate, 25 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 10 mm Mg2+acetate, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. All quantitation was done using Molecular Dynamics ImageQuant. A key event in Tn5 transposition is the blunt end cleavage of the transposon free from the donor backbone DNA. We have developed anin vitro assay to study the cleavage step in detail. In this assay, we incubate short, radiolabeled DNAs containing the 19-bp mosaic end sequence with purified EK54/LP372 tranposase in a potassium glutamate buffer in the presence of 10 mm Mg2+acetate. The reactions are incubated at 37 °C to allow cleavage to occur, and the cleavage products are analyzed on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Using a 53-bp DNA, we expected to see two cleavage products, a 40-base transposon and a 13-base donor DNA. In addition to the expected products, we detected a low mobility band migrating at 80 bases in a denaturing polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 3 A). We hypothesized that this band was a hairpin intermediate. To test whether the low mobility band was a hairpin, the DNA in the band was isolated from a denaturing gel and was electrophoresed on a native polyacrylamide gel. Under native conditions, the isolated DNA migrated faster, at 40 base pairs (Fig. 3 B). This differential mobility under denaturing and nondenaturing conditions is characteristic of a hairpin. Maxam-Gilbert sequencing was used to verify that this species is a hairpin. The 32P end-labeled putative hairpin DNA was isolated from a denaturing polyacrylamide gel and was subjected to Maxam-Gilbert A+G chemical sequencing (Fig. 4) (21Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9015) Google Scholar). The sequence matched bottom strand substrate DNA until hitting position 1 of the 3′ end of the mosaic end, and then the sequence began to match top strand substrate DNA beginning at position 1 of the 5′ end of the mosaic end. Notice that the three sets of triplets beyond the A-56 position on the hairpin A+G sequence match the three sets of triplets found in the top strand A+G sequence (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 3). This sequence of head to head mosaic ends matches the predicted hairpin sequence. The sequence became more difficult to read after position 1 of the 3′ end, indicating that multiple species existed in the isolated DNA. To further study the sequence of the hairpin species, we cloned putative hairpin DNAs and subjected individual clones to Sanger dideoxy sequencing. A DNA substrate was designed such that the hairpin would have a 4-bpEcoRI overhang at the 5′ end, a 4-bp AatII overhang at the 3′ end, and a properly spaced promoter −35 consensus sequence for direct selection during cloning. An in vitrocleavage assay was performed with this substrate, and the putative hairpin DNA was isolated from a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. This putative hairpin DNA was ligated as single-stranded DNA into anEcoRI-AatII digested pGREC1 plasmid, which is missing the −35 region of the tetracycline gene promoter. A successful ligation would provide the −35 region and allow for selection by tetracycline resistance. Upon transformation, the gapped DNA will be filled in by cellular functions. We recovered and dideoxy-sequenced 16 clones. Fourteen of the clones had sequences predicted for precise hairpins. Precise hairpins had position 1 of the 3′ end of the mosaic end covalently linked to position 1 of the 5′ end. This gave a hairpin junction of 5′-CAGCTG-3′. The other two clones derived from imprecise hairpins. In this case, the imprecise hairpins were formed from a covalent linkage between position 1 of the 3′ end of the mosaic end and position −1 of the 5′ end. The imprecise hairpins gave a hairpin junction of 5′—CAGACTG—3′ (Fig. 5). Imprecise hairpins can also be seen on denaturing polyacrylamide gels (see time course experiment below). We were interested in determining whether the hairpin is an intermediate in the Tn5 transposition reaction or a by-product. A kinetic analysis of an in vitro cleavage reaction described above shows that the hairpin is an intermediate (Fig. 6 A). The 80-base hairpin appeared quickly, within the first 5 min of the reaction, and continued to increase until it peaked at 25 min. At this peak, the hairpin was 1.6% of the total labeled molecules. After 25 min, the amount of hairpin in the reaction dropped to 0.5% at 60 min (Fig. 6 C). The other species in the reaction behaved differently (Fig. 6 B). The substrate decreased from 100 to 50% in 45 min; after 45 min, no more substrate was metabolized. The 40-base band represents both nicked and double strand break products. These products accumulated to approximately 25% of the total label at 25 min, and then a plateau was reached. Donor DNA was released upon hairpin formation. The donor DNA released from precise hairpin formation was 13 bases, and was detectable at low levels at 5 min. This product accumulated to 20% at 45 min and then leveled off. Interestingly, two hairpin species and two released donor DNA products were detectable. The second hairpin species is an 81-base imprecise hairpin. This species was hardly detectable until about 25 min; at this point, it made up just less than 1% of the total label. The imprecise hairpin persists through the end of the time course (150 min). Upon imprecise hairpin formation, a 12-base donor DNA was released. This species was clearly detectable, 1.3% of the total label, at 25 min. It increased to 5% of the label at 150 min. From 45 to 150 min, many other species of varying sizes were detectable. We speculate that they are strand transfer products generated by integration at various sites in unmetabolized substrate DNA. Because a kinetic analysis of an in vitro cleavage reaction showed that the hairpin is an intermediate, we hypothesized that preformed hairpins should be a substrate for transposase cleavage. The hairpin oligonucleotides were designed so that upon proper cleavage, a 28-base fragment will be released. Preformed precise and imprecise hairpin oligonucleotides were annealed, 5′ end-labeled, used as substrates in in vitrocleavage reactions, and analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Both precise and imprecise hairpins can be cleaved correctly at the 3′ +1 position, as seen by release of the 28-base product (Fig. 7). This processing of the hairpin is further evidence that the hairpin is an intermediate in the cleavage reaction. The imprecise hairpin is cleaved 10-fold less well than the precise hairpin. Although 50% of the precise hairpins were cleaved, only 6% of the imprecise hairpins were cleaved. We speculate that the additional band at approximately 33 bases in the precise hairpin reaction is a strand transfer product. It is likely that this band was not seen in the imprecise hairpin reaction because cleavage of the imprecise hairpin is less efficient. Preliminary evidence shows that precise and imprecise hairpins can undergo strand transfer. One imprecise hairpin strand transfer product has been sequenced, and it has the precise transposon/duplication junction, as well as the trademark 9-bp duplication. The additional base in the imprecise hairpin is not found in the strand transfer product (data not shown). We hypothesized that 5′ end cleavage requires formation of a hairpin on the transposon end and hairpin formation requires a 3′OH at position 1 of the bottom strand to attack the top strand. To test this, we designed prenicked mosaic end DNA substrates that had either a deoxyguanosine or a dideoxyguanosine at position 1 of the bottom strand. In addition, we used a pregapped mosaic end DNA substrate missing position 1 of the bottom strand (Fig. 8 A). If hairpin formation requires a 3′OH, the dideoxy containing substrate would be unable to support hairpin formation and 5′ end cleavage. The prenicked substrate with deoxyguanosine (40dG) (Fig. 8 B, lane 6) was efficiently metabolized, as seen by strong signals for hairpin formation (at 80 bases) (16% of total labeled molecules) and donor DNA release (at 20 bases) (26% of total label). A smearing of the DNA toward the upper half of the gel indicates that a variety of integration events occurred. Interestingly, the pregapped substrate was also metabolized, although much less efficiently (39dA) (Fig. 8 B, lane 2). Hairpins were formed 150-fold less well (only 0.1% of the total label) with the pregapped subs"
https://openalex.org/W2068053973,"Mechanisms that regulate conversion of prointerleukin-1β (pro-IL-1β) to its mature form by the cysteine protease caspase-1 are not well understood. In this study, we demonstrate that mature caspase-1 subunits are produced when human monocytes are treated with ATP and, like mature IL-1β, are released extracellularly. Characterization of the pharmacological sensitivity of this stimulus-coupled response revealed that some caspase-1 inhibitors allow pro-IL-1β secretion, whereas others do not. Two nonselective alkylating agents, N-ethylmaleimide and phenylarsine oxide, also blocked maturation and release of pro-IL-1β. Two inhibitors of anion transport, glyburide and ethacrynic acid, blocked maturation of both caspase-1 and pro-IL-1β and prevented release of the propolypeptides. Procaspase-3 was detected in monocyte extracts, but its proteolytic activation was not efficient in the presence of ATP. Maturation of procaspase-1 and release of the mature enzyme subunits therefore accompany stimulus-coupled human monocyte IL-1 post-translational processing. Agents that appear to selectively inhibit mature caspase-1 do not prevent ATP-treated cells from releasing their cytosolic components. On the other hand, anion transport inhibitors and alkylating agents arrest ATP-treated monocytes in a state where membrane latency is maintained. The data provided support the hypothesis that stimulus-coupled IL-1 post-translational processing involves a commitment to cell death."

Here, using heterologous cell systems, we have found that at least two different mechanisms are involved in the intracellular movement of GK.

However, in the presence of GKRP, GK moves to the nucleus and resides there in association with this protein until changes in the metabolic milieu prompt its release.

The post-transcriptional regulation of hepatic GK involves binding to the GK regulatory protein (GKRP). The interaction of these two proteins, which is stimulated by fructose 6-phosphate and inhibited by fructose 1-phosphate, competitively inhibits the phosphorylation of glucose by GK (13Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Under basal glucose conditions (∼5.5 mm) hepatic GK is bound largely to GKRP. However, after exposure to either high glucose (10–30 mm) or fructose (50 μm to 1 mm), GK is released from GKRP and exists in an unbound condition (14Agius L. Peak M. Biochem.

In the cytoplasm GK exists in an unbound state. However, in the nucleus GK is bound to GKRP (16Brown K.S. Kalinowski S.S. Megill J.R. Durham S.K. Mookhtiar K.A.

Cell Biol. 1995; 103: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The nuclear import and export of proteins occurs via the nuclear pore complex, which has an exclusion limit for proteins of 40–60 kDa (19Feldherr C.M. Kallenbach E. Schultz N. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 2216-2222Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 20Dworetzky S.I. Feldherr C.M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 575-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 21Peters R.

Proteins that are smaller than the exclusion limit are generally able to diffuse freely both into and out of the nucleus, whereas proteins greater than this size must be actively transported. Active transport through the nuclear pore complex involves the recognition of either nuclear localization signal (NLS) or nuclear export signal (NES) sequences (23Gerace L. Cell. 1995; 82: 341-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 24Ullman K.S. Powers M.A. Forbes D.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 967-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The mechanism(s) whereby hepatic GK, which has a molecular mass of 50 kDa, is able to both enter and leave the nucleus has not been elucidated. Indeed, until recently the enzyme was generally assumed to reside only within the cytoplasm of cells. To determine the molecular mechanisms involved in the nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation of GK, we studied the role of GKRP in the translocation of GK fusion proteins using both HeLa cells and yeast as heterologous cell systems. These studies clearly demonstrate that GK lacks a NLS and thus is unable to enter the nucleus by itself. Instead, entry into the nucleus depends on GKRP, presumably by a piggy-back mechanism. In addition, identification of a NES sequence within GK suggests that upon release of binding to GKRP in response to metabolic cues, the enzyme is exported from the nucleus via an active process. Together, these results suggest a nuclear-cytoplasmic transport cycle for GK in the hepatocyte that involves both GKRP and a NES sequence in GK. GKRP appears to play multiple roles in this transport cycle. In addition to its established function as a metabolic sensor and allosteric inhibitor of GK, GKRP also appears to function as a nuclear chaperone that binds to and carries GK into the nucleus. pCMV4-GK.L1 (25Andreone T.L.

Grimsby, unpublished data. were used to express wild type rat hepatic GK and rat GKRP, respectively. GK-cHKII chimeras were made using a PCR-based strategy to introduce newNcoI, KpnI, XhoI, EcoRI, and EcoRV sites into the GK cDNA (GenBankTMaccession number J04218). These base modifications did not alter the amino acid sequence of the enzyme. The primer pairs used to generate the different GK cDNA cassettes were: G1, 5′-C*C* ATG GCT ATG GAT ACT ACA AGG TG and 5′-G*GT A*CC CGT CAT GGC GTC CTC GGG (NcoI and KpnI ends); G2/G3, 5′-GGT* ACC* GCC GAG ATG CTC TTT GAC TAC and 5′-CTC G*AG TAG GAA CTC ATC CAG CTC GC (KpnI andXhoI ends); G4, 5′-CTC* GAG TAT GAC CGGATG GTG GAT GAA AG and 5′-G*AT A*TC GCA GTC GGT GAC AGA GGG TC (XhoI and EcoRV ends); and G5, 5′-GAT* ATC* GTG CGC CGT GCC TGT GAA AGC G and 5′-GAA TTC CTG GGC CAG CAT GCA AGC CTT (EcoRV and EcoRI ends). The altered bases are indicated by an asterisk, and the underlined bases denote a new restriction site. By utilizing the naturally occurring PstI and BalI sites, as well as the introduced sites, GK cassettes designated G1–G5 were obtained. Similarly, DNA fragments from the C-terminal half of rat HKII (GenBankTM accession number M68971) corresponding to the GK sequence cassettes were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR of RNA from AR42J cells, a rat pancreatic tumor cell line (ATCC: CRL1492). The primers used for the preparation of HKII cassettes, designated H1–H5, are as follows: H1, 5′-CTG CAG CAC GAG CAG CTT CTG GAG GTT and 5′-GGT ACC ATG CAT AAC CTC CTG TGG (PstI andKpnI ends); H2, 5′-GGT ACC GGG GAA GAG CTC TTC GAC CAC and 5′-T GGC CAC TGT GTC ATT CAC CAC GGC AAC (KpnI and BalI ends); H3 5′-TG GCC ACT ATG ATG ACT TGT GGC TAC G and 5′-CTC GAG CCG CAA GTC ATC CAG GCA GCC A (BalI and XhoI ends); H4, 5′-CTC GAG TTT GAT GTT GCT GTG GAT GAG C and 5′-GAT ATC GCT GTC ATC GCA CGT GCT CTC C (XhoI andEcoRV ends); and H5, 5′-GAT ATC GTG AAG GAG GTG TGC ACT G and 5′-GAA TTC TCT CTG CCC AGC CTC CCG GAT (EcoRV and EcoRI ends). GK-EGFP fusion genes were made by ligating a PstI-EcoRI fragment of GK (containing cassettes G1–G5) together with the 5′ sequences of hepatic GK (as a HindIII-PstI fragment) and with EGFP (as a EcoRI-NotI fragment from pEGFP-N2 (CLONTECH)) into the HindIII andNotI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The GK-cHKII-EGFP chimeras were made by replacing the appropriate GK cassette in the GK-EGFP parent vector with the corresponding HKII cassette. Because the generation of new restriction sites resulted in amino acid substitutions in some of the HKII cassettes, the cHKII-EGFP construct was made by direct PCR amplification of HKII using the H1-forward and H5-reverse primers. For the yeast two-hybrid analysis the GKRP cDNA fragment, including entire coding region, was amplified by linker-primer PCR from pSG5-GKRP thereby introducing a NdeI site at the 5′ end and aBamHI site at the 3′ end. TheNdeI-BamHI fragment was ligated into pAS2-1 (CLONTECH) to generate the GAL4-binding domain (BD)-GKRP fusion gene. To express the GAL4 activation domain (AD) fusion protein, each PstI-EcoRI fragment from the GK, cHKII or GK-cHKII chimeras was ligated into the NcoI andEcoRI sites of pACT2 (CLONTECH) with theNcoI-PstI fragment of GK obtained from the fragment amplified by PCR using the primer sets G1. The function of the two putative NESs of GK was tested using a fusion protein containing a segment of GK (amino acids 299–359) linked to EGFP. Linker-primer PCR was used to introduce EcoRI andBamHI sites on the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, of a GK cDNA fragment (bases 962–1144). The resultingEcoRI-BamHI fragment was ligated via anXhoI-EcoRI adapter into XhoI andBamHI sites of pEGFP-N2. The adapter included the Kozak consensus sequence and start codon for translation initiation (CGCCACCATG). Mutagenesis of the putative NESs was performed using a QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). HeLa cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 25 mm glucose. Cells were seeded in 35-mm glass bottom microwell dishes (MatTek) at a density of 1.5–2 × 105 cells/dish 1 day before transfection. Transfections were performed using SuperFect reagent (Qiagen) according to the supplier's instructions. After transfection, cells were cultured for 14–20 h, and then expressed proteins were localized either by direct fluorescence or by immunocytochemistry. Indirect immunofluorescent staining for GK and GKRP was performed as described previously (27Jetton T.L. Liang Y. Pettepher C.C. Zimmerman E.C. Cox F.G. Horvath K. Matschinsky F.M. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3641-3654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using sheep anti-GST-GK antibody (28Jetton T.L. Magnuson M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2619-2623Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and rabbit anti-rat GKRP antibody.2 Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-sheep IgG and Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) were used as secondary antibodies. Actin was revealed by staining with monoclonal anti-actin antibody, C4 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) after fixation with cold methanol. Images were acquired using a Zeiss 410 Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (Carl Zeiss). Nuclear/cytoplasmic ratios were determined by digital image analysis using NIH Image 1.61 software. Briefly, a 79 pixel area, which was approximately the area of an average nucleolus, was used to measure mean pixel intensities in the cytoplasm and in the nucleoplasm for each cells studied. From these values, the ratio of the nuclear intensity to the cytoplsmic intensity (N/C ratio) was calculated. Yeast two-hybrid analysis was performed as described by Fields and Song (29Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar). Yeast strain Y187 (Matα, ura3, his3, ade2, trp1, leu2, gal4Δ, met−, gal80Δ, URA3::GAL1USA-GAL1TATA-lacZ) (CLONTECH) was co-transfected with pAS2-1-GKRP and each of the pACT2-GK, cHKII or GK/cHKlI chimeras and selected on SD/−Trp/−Leu plates. The resulting transformants were grown in SD/−Trp/−Leu medium overnight then cultured in YPEG medium (1% yeast extract, 1% peptone, 1% ethanol, and 2% glycerol) for 6 h. β-Galactosidase activity was quantitated usingo-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate. One unit of β-galactosidase is defined as the amount activity able to hydrolyze 1 mmol of o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside to o-nitrophenol andd-galactose/min/cell (30Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 74Google Scholar). Expression of both the BD and AD fusion proteins in each transformant was confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-BD and anti-AD antibodies (CLONTECH), respectively. Because hepatocytes express both GK and GKRP we established a heterologous cell system in which the nuclear translocation of GK could be studied without interference by endogenously expressed proteins. HeLa cells, which do not express either GK or GKRP (data not shown) and which have served as a model for nuclear translocation studies of other proteins, were used. Hepatic GK and GKRP were each transiently expressed, and their subcellular locations were each determined by immunocytochemistry. When expressed by itself, GK was found almost completely in cytoplasm (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, when GKRP was expressed by itself, it was detected both in the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 1 B). However, when GK and GKRP were co-expressed they both were found to be located predominately in the nucleus (Fig. 1, C and D). Thus, in HeLa cells GKRP causes GK to change from being exclusively cytoplasmic in location to being predominately nuclear in location. At the same time, the presence of GK caused GKRP to become more concentrated in the nucleus. To determine whether GK and GKRP need to interact for GK to be translocated to the nucleus and to determine what regions of GK are necessary, we made and tested a series of fusion proteins between GK and the C-terminal half of hexokinase II (cHKII). HKII has a molecular mass of ∼100 kDa and consists of two related halves, each of which is highly similar to GK (31Printz R.L. Koch S. Potter L.R. O'Doherty R.M. Tiesinga J.J. Moritz S. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5209-5219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Kogure K. Shinohara Y. Terada H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8422-8424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and both of which are catalytically active (33Ardehali H. Printz R.L. Whitesell R.R. May J.M. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15986-15989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Chimeric proteins between GK and cHKII have been reported to be catalytically active, thereby indicating that portions of GK can be replaced with corresponding regions of cHKII without causing dramatic changes in the overall structure of this enzyme (34Kogure K. Yamamoto K. Majima E. Shinohara Y. Yamashita K. Terada H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15230-15236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Thus in this study, GK, except for 25 amino acids from N-terminal end, was divided into five cassettes (amino acids 26–117 (G1), 118–207 (G2), 208–271(G3), 272–365 (G4), and 366–464 (G5)). Each cassette was replaced with its counterpart in cHKII, thereby generating five different GK-cHKII chimeras (C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5) as shown in Fig. 2. In this experiment, all of the GK-cHKII chimeras, as well as both wild type hepatic GK and cHKII, were linked with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). This allowed us to directly observe the subcellular location of these proteins in cells, both with and without GKRP. GK-EGFP was located predominately in the cytoplasm when expressed alone but became almost entirely nuclear in location when expressed with GKRP (Fig. 3). Thus, addition of EGFP to the C-terminal end of GK did not adversely affect the GKRP-dependent nuclear translocation of GK. When expressed by itself cHKII-EGFP was also localized mainly in the cytoplasm. However, cHKII-EGFP did not translocate into the nucleus in the presence of GKRP (Fig. 3). The C1–C4 GK-cHKII-EGFP chimeras were found to be totally cytoplasmic in location when expressed either with or without GKRP. However, the C5 GK-cHKII-EGFP chimera retained the ability to translocate into the nucleus in the presence of GKRP (Fig. 3). These results suggest that nearly 70% of GK may be necessary for GKRP-dependent nuclear translocation and retention (Fig. 2).FIG. 3Subcellular localization of GK-cHKII chimeras in HeLa cells. Five GK-cHKII-EGFP chimeras (C1–C5) as well as control GK-EGFP and cHKII-EGFP were transiently expressed in HeLa cells with or without GKRP. The location of the expressed fusion proteins was determined by the use of laser scanning confocal microscopy in living cells. Scale bar, 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further assess whether the GKRP-dependent nuclear translocation of GK depends upon the binding of GK with GKRP, we established a yeast two-hybrid assay in which interactions of the two proteins could be quantitatively assessed. Both GK and GKRP were co-expressed in yeast as fusion proteins with GAL4 AD or BD, respectively, and their interactions were assessed by measuring β-galactosidase activity. Because the interaction between GK and GKRP in yeast two-hybrid system was inhibited by glucose in medium at a concentration required for growth of yeast (45–100 mm), 3C. Shiota and M. A. Magnuson, unpublished data. YPGE medium that contains glycerol and ethanol instead of glucose as carbon sources was used. The interaction with GKRP was detected only in the C5 GK-cHKII chimera (Fig. 4 A) among 5 GK-cHKII chimeras (Fig. 2). Thus, the only GK mutant that was able to bind to GKRP in yeast was also the only mutant that was able to cause the translocation of GK to the nucleus in HeLa cells (Fig. 3). In all cases, the proper expression of fusion proteins in yeast was verified by Western blot analysis. The lack of detectable interactions between the C1–C4 GK-cHKII chimeras and GKRP was not due to deficiency of protein expression (Fig. 4 B). Thus, these results are interpreted as indicating that the nuclear translocation of GK depends upon binding to GKRP. Inspection of the sequence of GK revealed two regions, 300ELVRLVLLKLV310 and347QIHNILSTLGLR358, that are similar in structure to other leucine-rich NES sequences. Both of these putative NES sequences contain five hydrophobic residues (leucine or isoleucine), four of which have spacing that characterizes well established NESs like those in human immunodeficiency virus, type I (HIV-1) Rev protein (35Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W. Luhrmann R. Cell. 1995; 82: 475-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar), protein kinase A inhibitor (36Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (37Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1635-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). To determine whether these putative NES sequences were actually functional, we made a series of EGFP fusion proteins containing amino acids 299–359 of GK because both NES were present within this portion of the protein. Alanine substitution mutations were introduced at positions 306, 307, and 309 (underlined) within the300ELVRLVLLKLV310region and at positions 355 and 357 of the347QIHNILSTLGLR358region. The substitution of alanines for leucines within functional NES sequences has been shown previously to eliminate their function (36Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). This series of GK (299–359)-EGFP fusion proteins, as well as EGFP, were expressed in HeLa cells and the subcellular location of these proteins was assessed by microscopic digital image analysis. EGFP without any GK sequence was distributed nearly equally between the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 6 A; N/C ratio = 1.09 ± 0.024), presumably because of its small size (27 kDa), which is well below the exclusion size of the nuclear pore complex. In contrast, GK299–359-EGFP had a N/C ratio of 0.95 ± 0.019, indicating that this fragment of GK was acting either to diminish the entry of the protein into the nucleus or increasing its extrusion from the nucleus. Although the ability of the GK299–359fragment to extrude EGFP from the nucleus may appear to be much less than that of the entire sequence of GK (Fig. 6, B andC, and Table I), the two cannot be directly compared because of the difference in the sizes of the fusion proteins (34 versus 77 kDa) which would affect the ability of these different proteins diffuse into the nucleus. Indeed, the higher N/C ratio of GK299–359-EGFP compared with GK1–456-EGFP is likely to be due simply to greater entry of GK299–359-EGFP into the nucleus. Nonetheless, given that the differences in the N/C ratios determined in this manner were not very large, we proceeded to mutate both of the putative NES sequences within GK299–359-EGFP. Mutation of both NESs (GK299–359-EGFP(mt1)) caused a nearly equal distribution of the protein between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 6 D). In contrast, mutation of only the347QIHNILSTLGLR358 sequence (GK299–359-EGFP(mt2)) resulted in a protein that, again, had a greater cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 6 E). Mutation of the 300ELVRLVLLKLV310 sequence in GK299–359-EGFP(mt3) abolished this effect (Fig. 6 F and Table I). Thus, these results indicate that the amino acids 300ELVRLVLLKLV310 within GK do, indeed, constitute a functional NES sequence.Table IEffect of putative NES regions of GK on subcellular distribution of EGFPFusion proteinSequences of putative NES regionsNo. of cellsN/C ratioEGFP301.09 ± 0.024GK(1–465)-EGFP300ELVRLVLLKLV310347QIHNILSTLGLR358390.61 ± 0.036ap < 0.001 compared with EGFP.GK(299–359)-EGFP300ELVRLVLLKLV310347QIHNILSTLGLR358360.95 ± 0.019ap < 0.001 compared with EGFP.GK(299–359)-EGFP (mt1)300ELVRLVAAKAV310347QIHNILSTAGAR358391.13 ± 0.020GK(299–359)-EGFP (mt2)300ELVRLVLLKLV310347QIHNILSTAGAR358480.92 ± 0.016ap < 0.001 compared with EGFP.GK(299–359)-EGFP (mt3)300ELVRLVAAKAV310347QIHNILSTLGLR358361.09 ± 0.016a p < 0.001 compared with EGFP. Open table in a new tab Inspection of the amino acid sequence of GK did not reveal motifs that met the consensus for any known NLS sequences. Indeed, the fact that GK is found only in the cytoplasm in the absence of GKRP strongly suggests the lack of a functional NLS within this enzyme. However, we considered it possible that GK might enter the nucleus in the absence of GKRP (via either diffusion or some other active mechanism) but then be extruded immediately by the NES in GK, thereby making it appear to always reside in the cytoplasm. Thus, to rule out the possibility of entry of GK into the nucleus in the absence of GKRP, we tested the effect of leptomycin B (LMB), an inhibitor of leucine-rich NES-dependent nuclear export (39Nishi K. Yoshida M. Fujiwara D. Nishikawa M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6320-6324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Kudo N. Wolff B. Sekimoto T. Schreiner E.P. Yoneda Y. Yanagida M. Horinouchi S. Yoshida M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). HeLa cells expressing GK were treated with LMB for 8 h, and then both GK and actin were localized by immunostaining. Actin, which has two functional NES sequences, served as positive control for the effect of LMB because actin enters the nucleus by diffusion and accumulates there when NES-mediated nuclear export is inhibited using LMB (38Wada A. Fukuda M. Mishima M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1635-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). After LMB treatment GK remained in the cytoplasm, whereas actin was detected in the nucleus (Fig. 7). Thus, this experiment provides direct evidence against a GKRP-independent mechanism for entry of GK into the nucleus. The entry and exit of proteins into and out of the nucleus is a highly regulated process. The entry of proteins of a size greater than the exclusion limit of the nuclear pore complex depends on the presence of a NLS sequence within the protein. In the absence of an NLS sequence, proteins that are too large to enter the nucleus by themselves may do so via interactions with other proteins,e.g. a piggy-back mechanism. Similarly, the export of proteins from the nucleus is an active process that depends upon a different motif called a NES sequence. Together, the presence or absence of either NLS or NES sequences, as well as the functional state of these motifs (because they can be masked by conformational changes or binding of other proteins) causes dynamic alterations in the subcellular distribution of many proteins. Because both NLS and NES sequences, as well as the proteins involved in transporting proteins to and from the nucleus, are increasingly well understood, we made use of this knowledge to study the mechanisms that are involved in the translocation of GK in the liver. In a HeLa cell model system, the co-expression of GKRP with GK was found to be required for GK to be able to enter the nucleus. In the absence of GKRP, GK resides only within the cytoplasm. However, in the presence of this protein GK is able to enter and be retained in the nucleus. Analysis of a series of GK-cHKII chimeric proteins showed that only those chimeras that are able to bind to GKRP are transported into the nucleus. These results clearly indicate that binding to GKRP is essential for both the nuclear translocation and accumulation of GK. Previous studies have shown that GKRP functions to anchor GK in the nucleus (16Brown K.S. Kalinowski S.S. Megill J.R. Durham S.K. Mookhtiar K.A. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, these studies suggest that GKRP has the additional function of a chaperone that mediates the nuclear entry of GK. HeLa cells were used in this study because they lack both GK and GKRP and have been used widely for studies of nuclear translocation mechanisms. However, HeLa cells do not fully mimic the function of hepatocytes. For instance, the intracellular location of GK in HeLa cells was not modulated by changes in the glucose concentration or addition of other metabolic factors (data not shown). This may explain why HeLa grown in a medium containing 25 mm glucose showed subcellular localization of GK and GKRP that was similar to that previously observed for hepatocytes cultured under basal glucose level (∼5.5 mm). The reason for the differences between HeLa cells and hepatocytes is not known but could be due to many factors such as the lack of the type 2 glucose transporter, as well as other proteins that determine rate of glycolytic flux. Previous studies, which have detected GKRP largely in the nucleus, have led to the suggestion that GK is able to enter and exit the nucleus by itself (16Brown K.S. Kalinowski S.S. Megill J.R. Durham S.K. Mookhtiar K.A. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, our results are not consistent with such a model. First, although GK has several clusters of basic amino acids, none of them matches the consensus sequences for either an SV40 or bipartite NLS. Second, GK resides exclusively in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells in the absence of GKRP. Third, GK does not accumulate in the nucleus even when nuclear export is inhibited with LMB. Thus, these findings do not support entry of GK into the nucleus in the absence of GKRP, either via an active or passive mechanism. Instead, our observation that GKRP, in the absence of GK, is found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm but changes to being largely nuclear in the presence of GK suggests that GKRP is an active participant in mediating the nuclear entry of GK. Further evidence that GKRP actively participates in the entry of GK into the nucleus was obtained by our studies of a set of GK-cHKII chimeras. The ability of these proteins to be transported and retained in the nucleus of HeLa cells was found to be dependent upon their ability to bind to GKRP, as determined by a yeast two-hybrid assay. Thus, based on the data we have obtained we suggest a new model for the nuclear-cytoplasmic movement of GK (Fig. 8). In this model, GKRP functions as a nuclear chaperone that carries GK into the nucleus via a piggy-back mechanism. Piggy-back mechanisms have been shown to be involved in the nuclear import of several other proteins, such as the 46-kDa subunit of DNA polymerase α-primase (41Mizuno T. Okamoto T. Yokoi M. Izumi M. Kobayashi A. Hachiya T. Tamai K. Inoue T. Hanaoka F. J. Cell. Sci. 1996; 109: 2627-2636PubMed Google Scholar) and the interleukin-5 receptor (42Jans D.A. Briggs L.J. Gustin S.E. Jans P. Ford S. Young I.G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although we have not demonstrated that GKRP is able to exit the nucleus after releasing GK, we think this is probably the case. Previous studies have suggested that the turnover rate of GKRP is slower than that of GK (12Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, unless GKRP is itself able to transit out of the nucleus, there might not be enough of the protein in some situations to be able to chaperone all molecules of GK back into the nucleus. Previously, GKRP has been thought to be located constitutively in the nucleus based on observations in primary hepatocytes (16Brown K.S. Kalinowski S.S. Megill J.R. Durham S.K. Mookhtiar K.A. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, within hepatocytes, which also express GK, it is possible that GKRP is present only transiently within the cytoplasm, where it is more difficult to detect than in the nucleus. It is also possible that specific metabolic traits of hepatocytes may affect the subcellular location of GKRP. For instance, the binding of GKRP to GK is promoted by fructose 6-phosphate and inhibited by fructose 1-phosphate (13Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 43Van Schaftingen E. Vandercammen A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Because these hexose phosphates interact with GKRP not GK, two different conformations of GKRP have been proposed: one form binds fructose 6-phosphate and GK, and the other binds fructose 1-phosphate (44Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 45Detheux M. Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, different conformational variations might also be able to affect the subcellular localization of GKRP, thereby providing a possible explanation for why GKRP is readily detected in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells but not hepatocytes. Leucine-rich NES sequences were first identified in the HIV-1 Rev protein (35Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W. Luhrmann R. Cell. 1995; 82: 475-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar) and in the cellular protein kinase A inhibitor (36Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). In these studies, the ability of this sequence motif to affect the subcellular location of a protein was demonstrated by nuclear microinjection of NES-conjugated bovine serum albumin or IgG. In this study we identified a NES in GK by transfection of EGFP fusion proteins. Although this method is technically simpler than the microinjection of larger fusion proteins into the nucleus, it has the disadvantage of depending upon diffusion of protein into the nucleus. Nonetheless, this approach enabled us to test the function of the two putative NES sequences in GK by measuring the N/C ratio of a series of EGRP-tagged fusion proteins. The results obtained demonstrate that one of two putative NES sequences within GK is functionally active. The presence of a functional NES in GK helps to explain why, in the absence of GKRP, GK is always detected in the cytoplasm. Also, the presence of a NES in GK may explain how the protein is quickly extruded from the nucleus after its release from GKRP. Based on the crystal structure of the structurally related yeast hexokinase B, GK has been predicted to fold into a small domain and large domain, which are connected by hinge region with a deep cleft (46Gidh-Jain M. Takeda J. Xu L.Z. Lange A.J. Vionnet N. Stoffel M. Froguel P. Velho G. Sun F. Cohen D. Patel P. Lo Y.-M.D. Hattersley A.T. Luthman H. Wedell A. St. Charles R. Harrison R.W. Weber I.T. Bell G.I.

Diabetes. 1994; 43: 784-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The 300ELVRLVLLKLV310 region in GK is predicted to lie within the large domain far from the cleft where the glucose-binding site resides. Thus, given the probable location of the NES in GK, glucose binding probably does not obstruct NES-dependent nuclear export. The binding sites for GKRP have previously been suggested to be located in the small domain and the hinge region of GK (48Veiga-da-Cunha M. Courtois S. Michel A. Gosselain E. Van Schaftingen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 27: 6292-6297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 49Veiga-da-Cunha M. Xu L.Z. Lee Y.H. Marotta D. Pilkis S.J. Van Schaftingen E. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 1173-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), some of which overlap with glucose-binding site. However, when a portion of the large domain of GK (amino acids 272–365) that contains the NES sequence was replaced with cHKII sequences, the resulting chimeric protein did not show any affinity to GKRP in yeast two-hybrid assay. Thus, our studies suggest that there may be a large interface between GK and GKRP because only a small portion of the protein was found to be dispensable when tested in this manner. However, additional studies are necessary to be certain of this. In the model shown in Fig. 8, when GK is in the nucleus, it binds to and is inhibited by GKRP. We speculate that GKRP may mask the NES in GK to ensure the GK-GKRP complex remains in the nucleus and is not rapidly exported. However, when blood glucose levels rise after feeding, GK is released from GKRP and is exported from the nucleus via an NES-dependent manner. Within the cytoplasm GK is catalytically active and converts glucose to glucose-6-phosphate. However, as the blood glucose levels begin to fall, GKRP binds cytoplasmic GK and moves it back into the nucleus, thereby completing a translocation cycle. Although these studies provide insights into the mechanisms that control GK translocation to and from the nucleus, they do not actually reveal the purpose of this translocation cycle. Indeed, the functional importance of the nuclear sequestration of GK will require the generation and characterization of GKRP knock-out mice. We thank Dr. M. Yoshida for generously providing leptomycin B and Drs. J. Michael Moates, Sally Mullany and Tom Jetton for participation in the early phases of this work."

We previously demonstrated that a variant of TCRα lacking lysines (KαR) is degraded by this pathway with kinetics indistinguishable from those of the wild type protein (Yu, H., Kaung, G., Kobayashi, S., and Kopito, R.

Here, we show that dislocation and degradation of TCRα and KαR are suppressed by dominant negative ubiquitin coexpression and by mutations in the ubiquitin activating enzyme, indicating that their degradation requires a functional ubiquitin pathway. A cytoplasmic TCRα variant that mimics a dislocated degradation intermediate was degraded 5 times more rapidly than full-length TCRα, suggesting that dislocation from the endoplasmic reticulum membrane is the rate-limiting step in TCRα degradation.

Nascent polypeptide chains destined for this compartment are translated on membrane-bound cytoplasmic ribosomes and targeted by signal sequences for translocation across or integration into the ER membrane (reviewed in Ref. 1Corsi A.K. Schekman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30299-30302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The translocation machinery, which minimally includes signal recognition particle, signal recognition particle receptor, and the SEC61p translocon, couples the synthesis of membrane and secretory proteins to their translocation across or integration into the ER membrane (1Corsi A.K.

Nature. 1977; 269: 775-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and to prevent aggregation within the reducing, aqueous environment of the cytoplasm (4Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J.

Dislocation is necessary for ERAD because proteasomes are restricted to the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments, while ER degradation substrates are initially present either on the luminal side of, or are integrated into, the ER membrane. Because many ERAD substrates are extremely prone to aggregate if exposed to cytosol (4Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1777) Google Scholar, 8Yu H. Kaung G. Kobayashi S. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20800-20804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), it is likely that dislocation and degradation are tightly coupled processes. Such coupling could be achieved, by analogy to biosynthetic translocation, by direct transfer of substrates to proteasomes “docked” at the ER membrane. However, because dislocated, deglycosylated, and often multiubiquitinated forms of misfolded glycoproteins are found to accumulate in the cytoplasm following acute proteasome inhibition (6Wiertz E.J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1777) Google Scholar), the coupling between dislocation and proteolysis cannot be strictly obligatory. Although recent genetic and biochemical studies suggest a role for the translocation machinery, including BiP, Sec61p, and Sec63p (22Plemper R.K. Beohmler S. Bordallo J. Sommer T. Wolf D.H. Nature. 1997; 388: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 23Pilon M. Schekman R. Romisch K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4540-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), in the dislocation of some misfolded ER-derived proteins, how such substrates are recognized and delivered to the dislocation machinery and the proteasome is unknown. Multiubiquitination is a well established signal that targets cytoplasmic proteins to proteasomes for degradation (for a comprehensive review, see Ref. 24Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6902) Google Scholar). A role for multiubiquitination in the degradation of ER-derived proteins is less clear, however, because many of these substrates are topologically separated by the ER membrane from the Ub-conjugating machinery in the cytoplasm (24Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6902) Google Scholar). Accumulation of multiubiquitinated ER-derived substrates following acute proteasome inhibition (4Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J.

On the other hand, many ER-derived substrates are stabilized by mutant Ub-activating (12Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2069-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), strongly suggesting a role for the Ub pathway in ERAD. Such mutant studies cannot, however, discriminate between a role for direct ubiquitin conjugation to the degradation substrate or an indirect signaling role for Ub. The studies in this paper address the role of the ubiquitin pathway in the coupling of dislocation of an integral membrane protein, TCRα, to its degradation by cytoplasmic proteasomes. TCRα is a 38-kDa type I glycoprotein composed of extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, a single transmembrane domain, and a short (5-amino acid) cytoplasmic tail (27Chien Y. Becker D.M. Lindsten T. Okamura M. Cohen D.I. Davis M.M. Nature. 1984; 312: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Unassembled TCRα chains are unstable and are rapidly (t 12 = 45–60 min) degraded (28Lippincott-Schwartz J. Bonifacino J.S. Yuan L.C. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1988; 54: 209-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 29Bonifacino J.S. Suzuki C.K. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Weissman A.M. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Although it is well established that TCRα degradation requires dislocation to cytoplasmic proteasomes (8Yu H. Kaung G. Kobayashi S. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20800-20804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 9Huppa J.B. Ploegh H.L. Immunity. 1997; 7: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), the role for ubiquitination in this process has been controversial. Multiubiquitinated forms of TCRα have been detected in some (20Yang M. Omura S. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) but not all (8Yu H. Kaung G. Kobayashi S. Kopito R.R. J. Biol.

Immunity. 1997; 7: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) TCRα-expressing cells following exposure to proteasome inhibitors. We previously reported that the kinetics of dislocation and degradation of a lysineless variant of TCRα (KαR) were indistinguishable from those of the wild type protein (8Yu H. Kaung G. Kobayashi S. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20800-20804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), demonstrating that ubiquitination of TCRα on ε-amino groups is not required for its dislocation or its degradation by proteasomes. However, those studies did not determine whether ubiquitination could contribute to TCRα degradation directly, by conjugation to a nonlysine residue, or indirectly, by conjugation to unidentified proteins. In the present study, we have employed alternative strategies to investigate the role of ubiquitin in the degradation of TCRα. Surprisingly, our data show that degradation of both TCRα and the lysineless variant, KαR, requires a functional ubiquitination apparatus. We also show that ubiquitination is required for dislocation of TCRα from the ER membrane, although no ubiquitinatable residues of this integral membrane protein are initially accessible to the cytoplasmic ubiquitination machinery. Finally, we present data suggesting that dislocation from the ER membrane is the rate-limiting step in TCRα degradation. E36 and ts20 cells were maintained in RPMI medium 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin at 30 °C and 5% CO2. HEK cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The cells were transiently transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously (30Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25710-25718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and used 48 h post-transfection. Co-transfection of His6Myc-tagged wild type (HM-Ub) or His6Myc-tagged K48R-Ub (HM-K48R-Ub) (12Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R.

For selecting stable cell lines of E36 and ts20 expressing TCRα, the cells were co-transfected with pSV2neo and grown in G418-containing medium 48 h after transfection. Individual clones of stably transfected E36 and ts20 cells were isolated. The cDNA corresponding to 2B4 TCRα (31Saito T. Weiss A. Miller J. Norcross M.A. Germain R.N. Nature. 1987; 325: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) was a kind gift from J. Bonifacino (National Institutes of Health). Lysineless TCRα (KαR) was generated as described previously (8Yu H. Kaung G. Kobayashi S. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20800-20804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Signal sequences of TCRα and KαR were deleted by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis. The hemagglutinin A (HA) epitope (YPYDVPDYASL) was inserted in the 3′-ends of TCRα and KαR upstream of the stop codon by overlapping polymerase chain reaction. All constructs derived from 2B4 TCRα were subcloned into pCDNA3.1− (Invitrogen) and verified by sequencing. HEK, ts20, or E36 cells were starved in Cys/Met-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 30 min, pulse-labeled with 500 μCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys (>1000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products), and chased in complete growth medium with 75 μm emetine (Sigma) for the indicated times. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with the active form of the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin, clastolactacystin β-lactone (10 μm) (Calbiochem) for 1 h. Subsequent starvation, metabolic labeling, and chase were performed in the continued presence of the same inhibitor. The cells were washed and lysed in IPB+ (10 mmTris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μm TLCK, 200 μm TPCK, 10 μg/mlN-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal). The lysate was cleared of insoluble material by centrifugation at 16,000 × g. The resulting detergent-insoluble pellet was sonicated in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 1% SDS and then diluted in 0.95 ml of IPB+. Samples were precleared with 50 μl of Gammabind-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation was performed using monoclonal anti-TCRα antibody H28-7-10 (32Becker M.L. Near R. Mudgett-Hunter M. Margolies M.N. Kubo R.T. Kaye J. Hedrick S.M. Cell. 1989; 58: 911-921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and Gammabind Plus Sepharose overnight. The Gammabind beads were washed sequentially with WB1 (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mmEDTA), WB2 (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.05% SDS), and WB3 (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mmEDTA). The beads were boiled for 3 min, and the immunoprecipitates were fractionated in 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by fluorography or PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.) as indicated. HEK cells were transiently transfected with 2B4 TCRα and K48R-Ub constructs. After 38 h, the cells were pulse-labeled and chased as described above. The cells were homogenized in buffer H (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA) supplemented with protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, TPCK, TLCK, andN-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal) using a glass/Teflon homogenizer. Unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min. Total cell membranes from the resulting postnuclear supernatant were then sedimented in TLA100.2 rotor (Beckman) at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The membrane pellet was resuspended in buffer H containing 10 mm CaCl2. Samples were treated with 0.01 mg/ml Proteinase K (Life Technologies, Inc.) in the presence or absence of 1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at 0 °C. Protease digestion was terminated by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 5 mm. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Bovine ubiquitin (Sigma) was radioiodinated using 1 mCi of [125I]NaI (17 Ci/mg, NEN Life Science Products) and IODO-GEN beads (Pierce). 125I-Labeled Ub at 1–2 × 105 cpm/nmol was purified by gel filtration. Forin vitro ubiquitination, TCRα-HA and KαR-HA were each used to program 150-μl coupled transcription and translation reactions with rabbit reticulocyte lysate (T7-TNT; Promega) in the presence of 125I-labeled Ub (1 × 104cpm/μl) for 90 min at 30 °C. TCRα-HA and KαR-HA were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-HA antibody 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 50 μl of Gammabind Plus Sepharose beads.125I-Ub-labeled TCRα-HA and KαR-HA were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). For the control sample, empty pCDNA3.1− vector was used in place of the TCRα-HA and KαR-HA cDNA to program the translation reactions. For immunoblotting of in vitro translated TCRα-HA and KαR-HA, 125I-labeled Ub was omitted from the coupled transcription and translation reactions. The translation products were immunoprecipitated with 12CA5 and immunoblotted with rabbit anti-HA antibody HA.11 (BAbCo). In this study, we sought to evaluate the role of Ub in the degradation of the lysineless TCRα variant, KαR. Because the internal epitope recognized by anti-TCRα antibodies may be obscured by ubiquitination of internal lysine residues, we performed pulse-chase analysis on human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK) cells expressing epitope-tagged variants, TCRα-HA and KαR-HA (Fig. 1 A). Both proteins were rapidly (t 1/2 ∼30 min) degraded during the chase with indistinguishable kinetics. These kinetics are slightly faster than those observed for the native TCRα (8Yu H. Kaung G. Kobayashi S. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20800-20804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 28Lippincott-Schwartz J. Bonifacino J.S. Yuan L.C. Klausner R.D.

Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), suggesting that the presence of a HA epitope further destabilizes this protein. Nonetheless, the data establish that TCRα degradation does not require ubiquitination on Lys residues (8Yu H. Kaung G. Kobayashi S. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20800-20804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and that the HA epitope tag does not interfere with targeting of these proteins to the proteasome. To determine the extent to which elimination of lysine residues reduced the capacity of TCRα to be ubiquitinated, TCRα-HA and KαR-HA were used to program cell-free transcription and translation reactions in rabbit reticulocyte lysate supplemented with 125I-labeled ubiquitin. Total TCRα-HA and KαR-HA synthesis and125I-labeled Ub conjugates thereof were assessed by anti-HA immunoblotting or by autoradiography, respectively, of HA-immunoprecipitated translation products (Fig. 1 B). Although both proteins were synthesized and immunoprecipitated with equivalent efficiency (Fig. 1 B; lanes 1–3), substitution of the 11 Lys residues in TCRα-HA with Arg reduced the level of 125I-labeled Ub conjugation by 91% (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4–6). The residual ubiquitination of KαR-HA in this assay suggests that Ub must be conjugated to nonlysine sites, most likely the N-terminal α-amino group, as was recently shown for the transcription factor MyoD (33Breitschopf K. Bengal E. Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5964-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). These data show that the effect of eliminating Lys residues on the kinetics of TCRα degradation does not correlate with the effect of this mutation on the capacity of the protein to become ubiquitinatedin vitro. Together, these results suggest either that ubiquitination is not involved in the degradation of TCRα or that ubiquitination at nonlysine residue(s) is sufficient to target the protein to the proteasome. Since the capacity of TCRα-HA and KαR-HA to become multiubiquitinated fails to correlate with their degradation kinetics, we used an alternative method to assess the role of the ubiquitin pathway in TCRα and KαR degradation. Individual ubiquitin moieties within multiubiquitin chains are linked by isopeptide bonds between the carboxyl group of the terminal glycine residue of one ubiquitin and the ε-amino group of a lysine residue, usually Lys48, in the next monomer (34Hershko A.

Expression of mutant Ub with Lys48 substituted by Arg (K48R) exerts a dominant-negative, chain-terminating effect on multiubiquitin chains and on the degradation of cytoplasmic (35Chau V. Tobias J.W.

Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar, 15Biederer T. Volkwein C. Sommer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2069-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Pulse-chase analysis (Fig. 2 A) revealed that coexpression of K48R-ubiquitin (HM-K48R-Ub) (12Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar) strongly stabilized wild type TCRα, extending its half-life to nearly 3 h, while coexpression of wild type Ub (HM-Ub) had no detectable effect on TCRα degradation. Because the effect of K48R coexpression on targeting substrates to the proteasome is dependent on the position in a multiubiquitin chain at which the mutant Ub is incorporated, and because the expressed mutant Ub must compete with the large pool of wild type Ub in the cell, the effect of K48R coexpression on degradation is always significantly less than 100%. Nonetheless, we found that coexpression of K48R-Ub inhibited the degradation of the lysineless construct KαR to a similar extent (Fig. 2 B) as wild type TCRα, indicating that, even in the absence of ε-amino groups, multiubiquitination machinery is in some way required for TCRα degradation. To confirm a role for ubiquitination in TCRα degradation, we expressed TCRα in ts20 cells that harbor a thermolabile allele of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) (Fig. 3 A). At the restrictive temperature (40 °C), ubiquitination and, consequently, ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation by these cells are inhibited (37Kulka R.G. Raboy B. Schuster R. Parag H.A. Diamond G. Ciechanover A. Marcus M. J. Biol Chem. 1988; 263: 15726-15731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Degradation of TCRα in these cells was blocked byN-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal and lactacystin, indicating that, as in HEK cells, it is mediated by the proteasome (data not shown). Shifting to the nonpermissive temperature of 40 °C profoundly inhibited TCRα degradation in ts20 cells (Fig. 3 A) but not in the parental E36 cells (Fig. 3 B). Together, these data unambiguously support a role for Ub conjugation in the degradation of both TCRα and KαR. However, because TCRα has no ubiquitinatable residues initially accessible to the cytoplasm, direct ubiquitination of TCRα cannot precede its dislocation. Moreover, a functional role for co-dislocational ubiquitination of TCRα is unlikely, because KαR is degraded at the same rate as TCRα, although it has no free internal amino groups. The preceding discussion implies that the only way for direct ubiquitination of TCRα to contribute to its degradation is if the protein is first dislocated to the cytoplasm and then ubiquitinated. In this manner, ubiquitination of TCRα could serve to functionally couple dislocation and degradation if and only if the rate of TCRα ubiquitination is fast compared with the rate of its dislocation from the membrane. The observation that deglycosylated forms of TCRα accumulate in the cytoplasm following chronic exposure of cells to proteasome inhibitors (8Yu H. Kaung G. Kobayashi S. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20800-20804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 9Huppa J.B. Ploegh H.L. Immunity. 1997; 7: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) is consistent with such a model. To determine whether cells possess the capacity to recognize and rapidly degrade dislocated TCRα molecules, we experimentally uncoupled degradation of TCRα from its ER dislocation by selectively deleting its N-terminal signal sequence. The primary structure of the protein encoded by this construct should be identical to the hypothetical deglycosylated form of the protein following its dislocation from the membrane (with the exception that in the dislocated protein the Asn residues should be replaced by Asp byN-glycanase hydrolysis of the N-glycans (9Huppa J.B. Ploegh H.L. Immunity. 1997; 7: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and the amino-terminal residue is predicted to be Asp following signal sequence processing in the ER). When expressed in transfected HEK cells, this variant, ΔssTCRα, and the corresponding lysineless version, ΔssKαR, migrated on SDS-PAGE at a molecular mass of ∼29 kDa (Fig. 4, A and B), consistent with the predicted molecular mass of the core polypeptides lacking N-linked glycans. Subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed that ΔssTCRα was restricted to the cytosolic fraction (data not shown). In contrast, ΔssKαR was degraded ∼4.5-fold slower than ΔssTCRα, witht 1/2 ∼45 min (Fig. 4, C andE). Thus, although lysine residues are not required for degradation of TCRα dislocated from the ER, they are required for the extremely rapid degradation rate observed for this hypothetical cytoplasmic TCRα intermediate. The kinetics of ΔssTCRα and ΔssKαR degradation were evaluated by pulse-chase analysis (Fig. 4). Following a 10-min pulse labeling with [35S]Met, the majority of both proteins was soluble in Nonidet P-40 and deoxycholate. A small fraction of these proteins was chased into a detergent-insoluble pool. Strikingly, subse"

Here, we report that the CCT expression is closely correlated with cell growth and is markedly enhanced at early S phase of the cell cycle in mouse and human cultured cells. The CCT up-regulated around early S phase is associated with tubulin in vivo. From these observations, we discuss the role of CCT in cell growth and cell cycle progression.

Total RNA (5 μg/lane) was electrophoresed on 2.2 mformaldehyde, 1% agarose gels and transferred onto nylon filters. These filters were hybridized with 32P-labeled human or mouse Ccta, Cctb, β-actin, and α-tubulin cDNA probes in Northern hybridization buffer (5 × SSPE, 5 × Denhardt's reagent, 1% SDS, 50% formamide, 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA) at 42 °C overnight, and then washed in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 68 °C. Cells were cultured in methionine (Met)- and cysteine (Cys)-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% dialyzed FBS and [35S]Met/[35S]Cys mixture (NEN Life Science Products Inc.), at 1.5 MBq/ml for 15 min, or at 7.4 MBq/ml for 4 h, depending on purpose. The labeled proteins in these cultured cells were chased in medium containing 10 mm nonradiolabeled Met and Cys for appropriate periods and extracted using RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 100 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 milliunits/ml aprotinin, 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5). After removing proteins that bind to protein G-Sepharose by absorption (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), aliquots (200 μl) of the supernatant was mixed with 5 μg of anti-CCTα antibody (clone 22b) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Protein G-Sepharose beads were then added to the mixture, incubated at 4 °C overnight on a rotator, and washed repeatedly in RIPA buffer. Proteins bound to the resin were extracted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE using 10% polyacrylamide gels. Radioactivity of bands was counted using a BAS2000 image analysis system (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). Cellular proteins were extracted as described above (see “Western Blotting” section). A Superose 6 column (1 × 30 cm) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was equilibrated with a buffer consisting of 40 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.2), 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol. The extracted proteins were applied to the column at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with an FPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein concentration was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm and fractions (0.5 ml each) of the eluate were collected. Aliquots of the fractions were analyzed by Western blotting. Previously, we found that CCT subunits are highly expressed in mouse tissues containing rapidly propagating cells such as the testis and spleen (13Kubota H. Yokota S. Yanagi H. Yura T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 492-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), suggesting that CCT expression may be correlated with cell growth. To study this correlation further, we analyzed CCT expression levels in several lines of mouse cultured cells that exhibit widely different growth rates. Cellular proteins were extracted from these cells, and expression levels of the eight different CCT subunits were determined by Western blotting with specific antibodies to individual subunits (Fig. 1). The mouse cell lines used in this experiment were: FM3A (mammary carcinoma), DA3 (myeloid cells), L5187Y (lymphoma), 7TD1 (B-cell hybridoma), J774A.1 (macrophage-like cells), LLC1 (lung carcinoma), and L929 (fibroblasts). Under the culture conditions used, FM3A, 7TD1, DA3, and L5187Y cells grew in suspension, whereas LLC1, L929, and J774A.1 grew as adherent cells. The CCT expression levels determined by Western blotting (Fig. 1 A) varied widely among these cells, and were in the following order from lower to higher: J774A.1 < L929 < LLC1 < L5187Y < DA3 < 7TD1 < FM3A. To examine the correlation between CCT levels and growth rates, [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA was determined with these cells. The radioactivity incorporated was correlated well with the levels of CCT subunit expression in these cells (Fig. 1 B), with correlation coefficients of 0.89 to 0.97 (Fig. 1 D). We also analyzed the proportion of S phase cells in the cultures by flow cytometry after DNA staining with propidium iodide and found a reasonable correlation between % S phase cells and CCT content (data not shown). Since the folding of tubulin and actin is known to be assisted by CCT (16Frydman J. Nimmesgern E. Erdjument-Bromage H. Wall J.S. Tempst P. Hartl F.-U.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), the amounts of these proteins expressed in these cells were determined. In contrast to CCT, the amounts of three known substrates of CCT, actin, α- and β-tubulin, showed no significant correlations with the growth rates (Fig. 1, C and D). Although the CCT expression levels varied among the cell lines, the expression patterns of subunits were very similar among the eight subunit species (Fig. 1, A and B). To examine whether these subunits formed complexes, gel filtration analysis of cell extracts prepared from J774A.1, L929, DA3, and FM3A was carried out. More than 99% of CCT subunits (each approximately 60 kDa) were eluted as symmetrical peaks at about 700 kDa as judging from Western blot analysis of eluates, for any of the four cell lines used (data not shown). These results indicate that most CCT subunits in vivo exist as a large complex regardless of cell growth. CCT complexes in growing cells are likely to be formed with almost identical subunit composition, although it can be changed in special circumstances such as differentiated neurites (42Roobol A. Carden M.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The constant ratio of subunits is consistent with the fixed arrangement of different CCT subunits in the complex as proposed by Liou et al. (14Liou A.K.F. Willison K.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4311-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and implies that there is a tight control mechanism for adjusting the expression levels of different CCT subunits in growing mammalian cells. Next, we analyzed CCT expression levels in cells undergoing growth arrest during differentiation. We used HL60 (35Collins S.J. Blood. 1987; 70: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a multipotent promyelolytic cell that can differentiate into different types of cells in response to a variety of chemical reagents: Me2SO and RA induce granulocytic differentiation, whereas sodium butyrate and TPA induce monocytic and macrophage-like differentiation, respectively. The differentiation induced by these chemicals was confirmed by morphological changes, expression of cell-surface CD11b antigen, and induction of two esterases as reported previously (35Collins S.J. Blood. 1987; 70: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the course of differentiation induced by Me2SO, sodium butyrate, or TPA treatment, cell numbers doubled during the initial 24 h but showed little increase thereafter (Fig. 2 A). Cell proliferation was arrested after 2 to 3 days upon RA treatment. Analysis of [3H]thymidine incorporation also confirmed the decrease of DNA synthesis during differentiation (Fig. 2 B). In addition, flow cytometry analysis of cells stained by the TUNEL method revealed that only a small fraction of the cells (less than 10%) were apoptotic during differentiation induced by any of the above chemicals (data not shown). Under the conditions described above, the levels of two CCT subunits (α and β) examined by Western blotting decreased during treatment with the chemicals (Fig. 2, C-F). These results are consistent with the idea that CCT expression is closely correlated with cell growth rate. The time course of the decrease in expression level was similar between the two subunits but different among the inducers utilized. The CCT levels decreased to less than 5% by TPA treatment for 4 days, but only to 20–50% after 5 days with the other chemicals (Fig. 2, E and F). The rapid decrease in CCT induced by TPA is probably related to a rapid decrease in DNA synthesis (Fig. 2 B). It is notable that the decrease in CCT subunit levels had already started within 24 h of treatment with all the inducers used, whereas cell number doubled during this period. These observations suggest that the synthesis of CCT subunits is reduced prior to growth arrest determined by counting cell numbers. The levels of CCT mRNAs encoding α and β subunits also decreased during treatment with all the inducers: the mRNA levels had started to decrease within 12 h of treatment (Fig. 3). Thus, the CCT mRNA levels decrease before the onset of growth arrest of these cells, suggesting that cells rapidly reduce transcription of CCT genes prior to growth arrest. Taken together, these results indicate that CCT expression is tightly coupled with cell growth and is mainly controlled at the mRNA level. In contrast to the changes in CCT levels, no significant changes were observed in α-tubulin level except for cultures treated with TPA (Fig. 2 G). Upon TPA treatment, HL60 cells can differentiate to macrophage-like cells without cell division or new DNA synthesis (43Rovera G. Olashaw N. Meo P. Nature. 1980; 284: 69-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), accompanied by phosphorylation of tubulin and microtubule-associated proteins followed by destabilization and depolymerization of microtubule architecture (44Katagiri K. Katagiri T. Kajiyama K. Yamamoto T. Yoshida T. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar). Since TPA treatment also leads to rapid reduction of CCT subunit level, tubulin and CCT appears to be coregulated in these cells. The level of α-tubulin mRNA decreased rapidly in response to all of the inducers tested (Fig. 3), similarly to CCT subunit mRNA level, suggesting that transcription of these mRNAs may also be co-regulated. On the other hand, the amount of actin showed little change during differentiation induced by any of these chemicals (Fig. 2 H) and the actin mRNA showed little change or slow decrease depending upon the chemicals used (Fig. 3). Since the level of CCT showed marked changes concomitant with cell growth as described above, turnover of CCT may also play important roles in regulating the amounts of CCT in the cell. For this experiment, we employed mouse DA3 cells which requires IL-3 for growth (33Ihle J.N. Contemp. Top. Mol. Immunol. 1985; 10: 93-119PubMed Google Scholar). When DA3 cells that had been grown with IL-3 were cultured in the absence of IL-3, the amounts of all CCT subunits decreased rapidly (Fig. 4). After IL-3 starvation for 16 h, the amounts of CCT subunits were reduced to approximately half of the levels in normally growing cells (Fig. 4 B) although the rate of decrease is not completely identical between subunits (turnover rates may be slightly different). Even after 32 h of starvation, readdition of IL-3 restored growth (data not shown) concomitant with coordinated synthesis of CCT subunits (Fig. 4 A). A similar phenomenon was observed using another growth factor-dependent cell line, 7TD1 (data not shown), which requires IL-6 for growth (34van Snick J. Contrib. Microbiol. Immunol. 1986; 11: 73-95Google Scholar). These results suggested that CCT subunits are rapidly degraded during starvation leading to growth arrest. The amount of β-tubulin was reduced significantly during starvation but that of actin remained unaffected (Fig. 4). Half-lives of CCT in growing and arrested cells were determined by pulse-chase experiments. DA3 cells were labeled with [35S]Met and [35S]Cys for 4 h under normal growth conditions, and excess unlabeled Met and Cys were added in the presence or absence of IL-3. The labeled CCT complex was analyzed by immunoprecipitation using anti-CCTα monoclonal antibody followed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5 A). Since eight different subunits of approximately 60 kDa are contained in the CCT hexadecamer complex (4Kubota H. Hynes G. Willison K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), they appear as a cluster of bands at 53–65 kDa by SDS-PAGE (11Kubota H. Hynes G. Carne A. Ashworth A. Willison K. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 89-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 16Frydman J. Nimmesgern E. Erdjument-Bromage H. Wall J.S. Tempst P. Hartl F.-U.

Nature. 1992; 358: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The half-life of labeled CCT in DA3 cells was estimated to be 6.0 h in the presence of IL-3 and 6.8 h in the absence of IL-3 (Fig. 5 B), indicating that the turnover rate of CCT is little affected by growth conditions. Another cell line, FM3A, which grows faster and shows higher CCT contents (Fig. 1), showed a similar CCT half-life (7.5 h) under normal growth conditions (Fig. 5). These results indicate that CCT undergoes rapid degradation with nearly constant rates regardless of growth conditions and probably also of cell type. In the course of these experiments, a 70-kDa protein co-precipitated with the CCT complex was observed (indicated by asterisks in Fig. 5). Since HSP70 and/or HSC70 were previou"
https://openalex.org/W2049055505,"Recently, we have described a distance constraint in the unknown tertiary structure of the human dopamine transporter (hDAT) by identification of two histidines, His193 in the second extracellular loop and His375 at the top of transmembrane (TM) 7, that form two coordinates in an endogenous, high affinity Zn2+-binding site. To achieve further insight into the tertiary organization of hDAT, we set out to identify additional residues involved in Zn2+ binding and subsequently to engineer artificial Zn2+-binding sites. Ten aspartic acids and glutamic acids, predicted to be on the extracellular side, were mutated to asparagine and glutamine, respectively. Mutation of Glu396 (E396Q) at the top of TM 8 increased the IC50 value for Zn2+ inhibition of [3H]dopamine uptake from 1.1 to 530 μm and eliminated Zn2+-induced potentiation of [3H]WIN 35,428 binding. These data suggest that Glu396 is involved in Zn2+ binding to hDAT. Importantly, Zn2+ sensitivity was preserved following substitution of Glu396 with histidine, indicating that the effect of mutating Glu396 is not an indirect effect because of the removal of a negatively charged residue. The common participation of Glu396, His193, and His375 in binding the small Zn2+ ion implies their proximity in the unknown tertiary structure of hDAT. The close association between TM 7 and 8 was further established by engineering of a Zn2+-binding site between His375 and a cysteine inserted in position 400 in TM 8. Summarized, our data define an important set of proximity relationships in hDAT that should prove an important template for further exploring the molecular architecture of Na+/Cl−-dependent neurotransmitter transporters.

Summarized, our data define an important set of proximity relationships in hDAT that should prove an important template for further exploring the molecular architecture of Na+/Cl−-dependent neurotransmitter transporters. dopamine transporter human DAT norepinephrine transporter human NET transmembrane segment wild type The dopamine transporter (DAT)1 tightly controls the amount of available dopamine in the synaptic cleft by mediating rapid reuptake of released dopamine into the presynaptic nerve terminal (1Horn A.S. Prog. Neurobiol. 1990; 34: 387-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar,2Amara S.G. Kuhar M.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 73-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). In this way, DAT plays a critical role in modulating the physiological effects of dopamine, including regulation of locomotor activity, cognitive functions, and neuroendocrine systems (1Horn A.S. Prog. Neurobiol. 1990; 34: 387-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 2Amara S.G. Kuhar M.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 73-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). The DAT, together with the closely related norepinephrine (NET) and serotonin transporters, forms a subfamily within a larger family of neurotransmitter and amino acid transporters that are characterized functionally by their dependence on the presence of both Na+ and Cl− in the extracellular fluid (3Giros B. Caron M.G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 43-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 4Nelson N. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1785-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Of particular interest, DAT, NET, and serotonin are transporters targets for both antidepressants drugs and several commonly abused psychostimulatory drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamine (1Horn A.S. Prog. Neurobiol. 1990; 34: 387-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 2Amara S.G. Kuhar M.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 73-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar, 4Nelson N. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1785-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Although cocaine and amphetamine inhibit all three transporters with similar potencies, it is generally assumed that inhibition of DAT is primarily responsible for the reinforcing and locomotor stimulatory effects of these drugs (5Giros B. Jaber M. Jones S.R. Wightman R.M. Caron M.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (2076) Google Scholar, 6Ritz M.C. Lamb R.J. Goldberg S.R. Kuhar M.J.

Na+/Cl−-dependent transporters are believed to share a common topology characterized by 12 transmembrane segments and an intracellular location of the amino and carboxyl termini (2Amara S.G. Kuhar M.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 73-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar, 3Giros B. Caron M.G. Trends Pharmacol.

Many studies have been carried out to characterize functional domains both in DAT and other Na+/Cl−-dependent transporters. Generation of chimeric transporter molecules has provided insight into the domains determining the subtype-specific pharmacological properties of the different transporters (8Barker E.L. Kimmel H.L.

However, little is yet known about the tertiary structure of this important class of transporters, and the nature of the molecular processes responsible for the translocation mechanism remains unknown. Recently, we have reported an important distance constraint in the tertiary structure of the hDAT based on the discovery of an endogenous high affinity Zn2+-binding site (22Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Initially, we observed that Zn2+, in micromolar physiological concentrations, acts as a potent noncompetitive blocker of dopamine uptake. Furthermore, it was found that micromolar concentrations of Zn2+ markedly potentiate binding of the cocaine-like blocker, WIN 35,428 (22Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Systematic mutation of histidines, predicted to be on the extracellular face of the transporter, identified two histidines, His193 in the large second extracellular loop 2 outside transmembrane segment (TM) 3 and His375 at the top of TM 7, as two coordinates in this endogenous Zn2+-binding site (Fig. 1) (22Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The two residues are separate in the primary structure, but their common participation in Zn2+ binding designated their spatial proximity in the tertiary structure (22Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The structures of many Zn2+-binding sites are known from x-ray crystallography of Zn2+-binding proteins, and therefore, the geometry of the interaction between Zn2+ and different coordinating side chains is well characterized (23Vallee B.L. Falchuk K.H. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 79-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Schwabe J.W. Klug A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 25Alberts I.L. Nadassy K. Wodak S.J. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1700-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The coordination of Zn2+ is most often found to be tetrahedral involving the side chains of four residues or the side chains of three residues plus a water molecule (23Vallee B.L. Falchuk K.H. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 79-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Schwabe J.W. Klug A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 25Alberts I.L. Nadassy K. Wodak S.J. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1700-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). It is thus conceivable that His193 and His375 are not the only residues involved in coordinating Zn2+ binding to the hDAT. In addition to the imidazole side chain of histidines, the side chains found to coordinate Zn2+ are the sulfhydryl side chain of cysteines and the acidic side chains of glutamates and aspartates (25Alberts I.L. Nadassy K. Wodak S.J. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1700-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Because mutation of several cysteines predicted to be accessible from the extracellular side did not indicate participation of these residues in Zn2+ binding, 2L. Norregaard, J. Ferrer, J. Javitch, and U. Gether, unpublished observation. we decided to investigate the possible involvement of aspartates and glutamates. Previously, we demonstrated that full Zn2+susceptibility can be conveyed to the human NET (hNET) by mutational transfer of only His193, which is nonconserved between hDAT and hNET (22Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Additional coordinating residues can therefore be expected to be conserved between the two transporters, and we could restrict our search to 10 conserved aspartates and glutamates predicted to be on the extracellular face (Fig. 1). By mutational analyses we find that Glu396 at the extracellular end of TM 8 is a putative third coordinate in the hDAT Zn2+-binding site, indicating proximity between extracellular loop 2, TM 7 and TM 8 in hDAT. Moreover, we show that an artificial Zn2+-binding site can be engineered between TM 7 and TM 8. This binding site both verify the proximity between the two domains as wells as it supports an α-helical configuration at the top of TM 8. The cDNA encoding the human dopamine transporter (hDAT) and norepinephrine transporter (hNET) were kindly provided by Dr. Marc G. Caron (Duke University, Durham, NC). Mutant transporters were constructed by polymerase chain reaction-derived mutagenesis using Pfu polymerase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The generated polymerase chain reaction fragments were digested with the appropriate enzymes, purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector, pRc/CMV (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), containing either hDAT or hNET (9Giros B.

Neurosci. 1993; 13: 4246-4253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All mutations were confirmed by restriction enzyme mapping and DNA sequencing using an ABI 310 automated sequencer. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 041 01885 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine and 0.01 mg/ml gentamicin. Wild type and mutant constructs in pRc/CMV were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (27Johansen T.E. Scholler M.S. Tolstoy S. Schwartz T.W. FEBS Lett. 1990; 267: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 28Gether U. Marray T. Schwartz T.W. Johansen T.E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Uptake assays were performed modified from Giros et al. (29Giros B. el Mestikawy S. Godinot N. Zheng K. Han H. Yang-Feng T. Caron M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 383-390PubMed Google Scholar) using 2,5,6-[3H]dopamine (7–21 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Transfected COS-7 cells were plated in either 24-well dishes (105 cells/well) or 12-well dishes (2–3 × 105 cells/well) to achieve an uptake level of 5–10% of total added [3H]dopamine. The uptake assays were carried out 2 days after transfection. Prior to the experiment, the cells were washed once in 500 μl of uptake buffer (5 mm Tris base, 7.5 mm HEPES, 120 mm NaCl, 5.4 mmKCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mmMgSO4, 1 mml-ascorbic acid, 5 mmd-glucose, pH 7.1). The compound to be tested was added to the cells, and uptake was initiated by addition of 10 nm [3H]dopamine in a final volume of 500 μl. After 10 min of incubation at 37 °C, the cells were washed twice with 500 μl of uptake buffer, lysed in 500 μl 1% SDS and left 1 h at 37 °C. All samples were transferred to 24-well counting plates (Wallac, Turku, Finland), 500 μl of Opti-phase Hi Safe 3 scintillation fluid (Wallac) was added followed by counting of the plates in a Wallac Tri-Lux β-scintillation counter (Wallac). Nonspecific uptake was determined in the presence of 1 mmnonlabeled dopamine (Research Biochemicals International, Natick, MA). All determinations were performed in triplicate. Binding assays were carried out on whole cells using [3H]WIN 35,428 (83.5 Ci/mmol) (NEN Life Science Products) as radioligand. One day after transfection, cells were seeded in either 24-well dishes (105 cells/well) or 12-well dishes (2–3 × 105 cells/well) to achieve a binding level of 5–10% of total added [3H]WIN 35,428. Two days after transfection, competition binding assays were performed in a final volume of 500 μl of uptake buffer containing 2–4 nm [3H]WIN 35,428 and indicated concentrations of compound to be tested. Binding was terminated after 2 h at 4 °C by washing the cells twice in 500 μl of uptake buffer prior to lysis in 500 μl 1% SDS for 1 h at 37 °C. All samples were transferred to 24-well counting plates (Wallac, Turku, Finland), and 500 μl of Opti-phase Hi Safe 3 scintillation fluid (Wallac) was added followed by counting of the plates in a Wallac Tri-Lux β- scintillation counter (Wallac). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm WIN 35,428 (RBI). Determinations were made in triplicate. Uptake and binding data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis using Prism 2.0 from GraphPad Software (San Diego, CA). Zn2+ potently inhibits [3H]dopamine uptake in a biphasic manner with a high affinity component (IC50 = 1.1 μm) and a low affinity component (IC50 > 1000 μm) in COS-7 cells transiently expressing the wild type (WT) hDAT (Fig. 2 A and Table I and Ref. 22Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown evidence that the high affinity component is due to the interaction of Zn2+ with at least two residues, His193 and His375, on the predicted extracellular face of the transporter (Fig. 1 and Ref. 22Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). His193 is nonconserved between hDAT and hNET, whereas His375 is conserved between the two transporters. Full Zn2+ susceptibility can be conveyed to the hNET by mutational transfer of only His193(22Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar); therefore, Zn2+-coordinating residues in addition to His193 and His375 can be expected to be conserved between hDAT and hNET. To examine the possible participation of aspartates and glutamates in binding of Zn2+, we mutated the 10 conserved aspartates and glutamates predicted to face the extracellular environment to asparagine and glutamine, respectively (Fig. 1). All mutant transporters were functional and displayedK m values for [3H]dopamine uptake andK D values for [3H]WIN 35,428 binding comparable with WT hDAT (Table I). Mutation of Glu215, Glu218, Asp232, Asp301, Glu307, Asp381, Asp385, and Glu476 did not change the ability of Zn2+ to inhibit [3H]dopamine uptake, whereas mutation of Glu191 to glutamine lead to a small 2–3-fold increase in the IC50 value for Zn2+ inhibition (Table I). In contrast, mutation of Glu396 to glutamine caused an almost 500-fold increase in the IC50 value for Zn2+ inhibition of [3H]dopamine uptake (Fig. 2 A and Table I). This suggests that Glu396 could be a third coordinate in the hDAT Zn2+-binding site. Notably, the effect on Zn2+ inhibition by mutating Glu396 is similar to the effect observed by mutating the previously identified Zn2+ coordinates, His193and His375 (Ref. 22Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U.

Open table in a new tab We have shown earlier that introducing a histidine in position 189 of the hNET (hNET-K189H), corresponding to His193 in hDAT, converts Zn2+ into a potent inhibitor of [3H]dopamine uptake mediated by the hNET (Ref. 22Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar and shown in Fig. 2 Bfor comparison). We demonstrated also that mutation of His372 in hNET-K189H, corresponding to His375in hDAT, essentially eliminated the high affinity component in hNET-K189H, suggesting that Zn2+ is interacting with the same site in the hNET-K189H mutant as in WT hDAT (22Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This was further supported by mutating Glu393 to glutamine in hNET-K189H, corresponding to Glu396 in the hDAT. As shown in Fig. 2 B, Zn2+ was only a rather poor inhibitor of [3H]dopamine uptake in this mutant (hNET-K189H-E393Q), displaying a 30-fold increase in IC50 value as compared with hNET-K189H (Fig. 2 B and Table I). These data indicate that Glu393 is involved in Zn2+ binding in hNET-K189H. The effect of mutating Glu393 was, however, not as dramatic as the effect of mutating Glu396 in the hDAT, where a 500-fold increase in IC50 value was observed for Zn2+ (Table I and Fig. 2 A). Most likely, this difference is due to some subtle structural differences between hDAT and hNET. Similar to what was observed following mutation of Glu396 in hDAT, mutation of Glu393 in hNET-K189H did not cause changes in the K m for [3H]dopamine uptake and the K D for [3H]WIN 35,428 binding (Table I). As illustrated in Fig. 3, Zn2+causes a marked potentiation of [3H]WIN 35,428 binding to the hDAT with maximal potentiation in the presence of 10 μm Zn2+. In our previous study we have shown that this potentiation is due mainly to an increase in the apparent number of binding sites (22Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Mutation of His193 or His375 eliminates the potentiation by Zn2+, indicating that both inhibition of dopamine uptake and potentiation of [3H]WIN 35,428 binding by Zn2+ are due to the interaction of Zn2+ with the same site (22Norregaard L. Frederiksen D. Nielsen E.O. Gether U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Mutation of Glu396 to glutamine also eliminated Zn2+-induced potentiation of [3H]WIN 35,428 binding (Fig. 3). This provides additional support that Glu396 is a third coordinate in the hDAT Zn2+-binding site. Following mutation of the other nine acidic residues (Asp191, Glu215, Glu218, Asp232, Asp301, Glu307, Asp381, Asp385, and Glu476), Zn2+-induced potentiation was at least partially preserved (Table I). It is possible that the loss of Zn2+ sensitivity upon mutating Glu396 to glutamine in hDAT is due to an indirect structural effect caused by the removal of a negative charge rather than the disruption of a direct interaction with Zn2+. To exclude this possibility we substituted the glutamate with another residue capable of coordinating Zn2+. As shown in Fig. 4, histidine could fully substitute for the glutamate (hDAT-E396H mutant) in respect of Zn2+inhibition of [3H]dopamine uptake. In fact, the inhibition curve was monophasic with a Hill slope of −2.2, and micromolar concentrations of Zn2+ were able to inhibit [3H]dopamine uptake entirely in contrast to the WT hDAT, where saturation of the apparent high affinity site only results in 60–70% inhibition of [3H]dopamine uptake (Fig. 2 A). Regarding Zn2+ potentiation of [3H]WIN 35,428 binding the histidine could substitute only partly for the glutamic acid (15% increase in binding in E396Hversus 55% in WT; Table II).Table IIUptake and binding characteristics of E396H mutant transportershDAT Mutants[3H] Dopamine uptakeK m [S.E. interval]V maxIC50 (Zn2+) [S.E. interval]F MUT (Zn2+)[3H]WIN 35,428 bindingK d [S.E. interval]B maxZn2+ ratioNμmfmol/min/10 5 cellsμmNnmfmol/10 5 cells% B 0hDAT131.5 [1.3–1.8]2200 ± 3151.1[1.0–1.2]11511[10–12]86 ± 13155 ± 10hDAT E396H40.7 [0.5–0.9]72 ± 130.64[0.54–0.78]0.6319[12–27]39 ± 10115 ± 5aSignificantly different from hDAT wild type (p < 0.01).hDAT H193K + E396H31.4 [1.1–1.6]339 ± 641.43[1.36–1.51]1.3332[30–34]93 ± 27102 ± 12aSignificantly different from hDAT wild type (p < 0.01).hDAT H375A + E396H61.0 [0.7–1.5]124 ± 20593[466–754]539316[13–21]29 ± 2110 ± 3aSignificantly different from hDAT wild type (p < 0.01).hDAT H193K + H375A + E396H90.9 [0.8–1.2]48 ± 9469[405–543]426216[13–19]17 ± 6100 ± 4aSignificantly different from hDAT wild type (p < 0.01).hDAT H193K + E396Q53.5 [3.0–4.0]4229 ± 813664[611–721]604322[20–25]142 ± 4389 ± 4aSignificantly different from hDAT wild type (p < 0.01).hDAT H193K + H375A + E396Q53.4 [3.0–3.9]917 ± 131>1000>1000317[15–20]112 ± 3097 ± 7aSignificantly different from hDAT wild type (p < 0.01).a Significantly different from hDAT wild type (p < 0.01). Open table in a new tab To ensure that Zn2+ binding to hDAT-E396H involved His193 and His375, we mutated His193 and His375 by themselves (hDAT-H193K-E396H and hDAT-H375A-E396) and combined (hDAT-H193K-H375A-E396H) (Table II). Mutation of His375(hDAT-H193K-H375A-E396H) eliminated the high affinity binding of Zn2+, which confirmed a crucial role of His375(Table II and Fig. 4). However, mutation of His193(hDAT-H193K-E396H) did only increase the IC50 value for Zn2+ inhibition 2-fold, suggesting that His193only has a minor role in Zn2+ inhibition of [3H]dopamine uptake in the hDAT-E396H mutant (Table IIand Fig. 4). Possibly, insertion of a histidine in position 396 causes a structural change of the Zn2+-binding site that could lead to involvement of as yet unidentified residues in addition to His375 and the histidine in position 396. Nonetheless, the data still support the close proximity between His375 and Glu396 and are consistent with Glu396 being a third coordinate in the endogenous Zn2+-binding site. Our data suggest that His375 at the top of TM 7 is facing Glu396 at the top of TM 8. To further elaborate this spatial proximity between TM 7 and 8, we next wished to engineer artificial metal ion-binding sites between the two domains. Assuming that Glu396 is situated in an α-helical environment, it could be expected that His375 also is close to thei+4 or i+3 position from Glu396 in TM 8 and thus that a bidentate Zn2+-binding site could be generated between His375 and either the i+4 ori+3 position, whereas the i+2 position would be expected to be located on the opposite side of the helix (Fig. 5 A). Accordingly, three mutant transporters were generated in which His193 and Glu396 were removed, His375 was preserved, and cysteines residues were inserted in positions i+2 (hDAT-H193K-E396Q-I398C), i+3 (hDAT-H193K-E396Q-A399C) andi+4 (hDAT-H193K-E396Q-T400C). Cysteines were chosen because their smaller side chain would be expected to be better tolerated in the transmembrane regions as compared with histidines. As illustrated in Fig. 5 B, Zn2+ was a potent inhibitor of [3H]dopamine uptake in hDAT-H193K-E396Q-T400C (i+4), displaying an IC50 value of 24 μm in contrast to 660 μm for the background mutant, hDAT-H193K-E396Q (Table III and Fig. 5 B). This almost 30-fold increase in apparent Zn2+ affinity was not only dependent on the presence of a cysteine in position 400 but was also dependent on the presence of His375. Mutation of His375 to alanine in the hDAT-H193K-E396Q-T400C construct (resulting in hDAT-H193K-H375A-E396Q-T400C) eliminated high affinity Zn2+inhibition of [3H]dopamine uptake (IC50 = 995 nm; Table III). This indicates that an inhibitory bidentate Zn2+-binding site had been generated between His375 and T400C. For hDAT-H193K-E396Q-A399C (i+3) we observed a small 2–3-fold decrease in the IC50 value for Zn2+, whereas a 5-fold decrease was found for hDAT-H193K-E396Q-I398C (i+2) (Fig. 5 C and Table III). Importantly, this 5-fold decrease in the IC50 value for Zn2+ in hDAT-H193K-E396Q-I398C (IC50 = 122 μm) as compared with control, hDAT-H193K-E396Q (IC50 = 664 μm; Table III) was found to be independent of the presence of His375because a similar IC50 value was observed in the control mutant hDAT-H193K-H375A-E396Q-I398C (IC50 = 137 μm; Table III).Table IIIUptake characteristics of mutants with inserted cysteine residues in the top of TM 8hDAT mutants[3H]Dopamine uptakeK m [S.E. interval]V maxIC50(Zn2+) [S.E. interval]Nμmfmol/min/10 5 cellsμmhDAT H193K + E396Q53.5 [3.0–4.0]4229 ± 813664 [611–721]hDAT H193K + E396Q + I398C50.44 [0.38–0.50"

In the presence of Mn2+, 3Dpol activity was increased by greater than 10-fold relative to that in the presence of Mg2+. Steady-state kinetic analysis revealed that the increased activity observed in the presence of Mn2+ was due, primarily, to a reduction in the K M value for 3Dpol binding to primer/template, without any significant effect on the K M value for nucleotide. The ability of 3Dpol to catalyze RNA synthesis de novo was also stimulated approximately 10-fold by using Mn2+, and the enzyme was now capable of also utilizing a DNA template for primer-independent RNA synthesis. Interestingly, the use of Mn2+ as divalent cation permitted 3Dpolactivity to be monitored by following extension of 5′-32P-end-labeled, heteropolymeric RNA primer/templates.

For example, as many as 4 million Americans are currently infected by hepatitis C virus. Hepatitis C virus is capable of establishing a persistent infection, which leads to cirrhosis of the liver and, in some cases, liver cancer (1Houghton M. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M.

RdRP activity is unique to virus-infected, human cells; therefore, the RdRP is a suitable target for the development of antiviral agents.

A detailed kinetic and thermodynamic description of RdRP-catalyzed nucleotide incorporation should permit this enzyme to be distinguished from cellular polymerases, thus facilitating the development of RdRP-specific inhibitors useful for the treatment of RNA virus infection. Biological and biochemical studies of poliovirus genome replication have been ongoing for decades (9Rueckert R.R. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 1. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, PA1996: 609-654Google Scholar). These studies have shown that RNA structures at the 3′-end of the genome (10Xiang W. Paul A.V. Wimmer E. Semin. Virol. 1997; 8: 256-273Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and possibly at the 5′-end of the genome (11Andino R. Rieckhof G.E. Achacoso P.L. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3587-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), specify the site of assembly of the replication complex. The exact composition and order of assembly of this complex remains to be determined. However, both viral and host factors have been implicated in replicase assembly and/or function (12Xiang W. Cuconati A. Hope D. Kirkegaard K. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6732-6741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Gamarnik A.V. Andino R.

J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8482-8489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After complex assembly, poliovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, 3Dpol, initiates RNA synthesis by using the protein primer, 3B (VPg). 3Dpol has been studied intensively for many years because of its key role in poliovirus genome replication. Therefore, this enzyme is an ideal model system to use in the study of RdRP mechanism and for the elucidation of RdRP structure-function relationships. In vitro studies employing pure, active 3Dpolhave identified many of the biochemical properties and enzymatic activities associated with this enzyme. In addition to oligo(dT)- and oligo(rU)-dependent poly(rU) polymerase activity (3Ishihama A. Barbier P. Arch. Virol. 1994; 134: 235-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 4Plotch S.J. Palant O. Gluzman Y. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 216-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 3Dpol is capable of uridylylating VPg and utilizing the resulting VPg-pUpU product as a primer for poly(rU) synthesis (16Paul A.V. van Boom J.H. Filippov D. Wimmer E. Nature. 1998; 393: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). 3Dpol has terminal transferase activity (17Neufeld K.L. Galarza J.M. Richards O.C. Summers D.F Ehrenfeld E. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5811-5818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and strand displacement activity (18Cho M.W. Richards O.C. Dmitrieva T.M. Agol V. Ehrenfeld E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3010-3018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, 3Dpol has the ability to multimerize (19Hansen J.L. Long A.M. Schultz S.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1109-1122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), and Kirkegaard and colleagues (20Beckman M.T.L. Kirkegaard K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6724-6730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have suggested that multimerization may be required for nucleic acid binding, polymerase activity (21Pata J.D. Schultz S.C. Kirkegaard K. RNA ( N. Y. ). 1995; 1: 466-477PubMed Google Scholar), and virus viability (22Diamond S.E. Kirkegaard K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 863-876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that 3Dpol is sufficient for template switching, and this enzyme is capable of catalyzing primer-independent RNA synthesis (23Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2706-2716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Finally, a high resolution crystal structure is available for 3Dpol (19Hansen J.L. Long A.M. Schultz S.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1109-1122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The overall topology of 3Dpol is quite similar to that of the other classes of nucleic acid polymerase in that the enzyme resembles a right hand with “fingers,” “palm,” and “thumb” subdomains. The palm subdomain contains four structural motifs (A–D) found in all polymerases, in addition to a fifth motif (E) found only in enzymes, such as reverse transcriptases, which utilize RNA templates. Clearly, a great deal of information germane to 3Dpolfunction exists. However, detailed kinetic and mechanistic studies of this enzyme have yet to be performed. The absence of this information greatly limits the extent to which structural information can be exploited to establish the structure-function relationships of this class of polymerase. Detailed kinetic and mechanistic investigations of 3Dpol have been limited, primarily, by the inability to establish stoichiometric complexes between 3Dpol and primer/template that permit polymerase activity to be monitored by following the extension of end-labeled, heteropolymeric RNA primers. One possible explanation for this is that 3Dpol has a low affinity for nucleic acid. We have shown that theK M value of 3Dpol for short, homopolymeric primer/templates is in the 10–20 μm range (23Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2706-2716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and Kirkegaard and colleagues (20Beckman M.T.L. Kirkegaard K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6724-6730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have reportedK d values for 3Dpol binding to nucleic acid that are in the μm range. In this report, we have extended our systematic, quantitative analysis of 3Dpol by evaluating the divalent cation specificity of this enzyme. Taken together, the data described herein provide evidence for functional similarity between the RdRP and DNA polymerases and suggest novel strategies for the design of primer/template substrates to investigate 3Dpol mechanism. [α-32P]GTP (>3,000 Ci/mmol), [α-32P]UTP (>6,000 Ci/mmol), and [γ-32P]GTP (>6,000 Ci/mmol) were from NEN Life Science Products; [γ-32P]ATP (>7,000 Ci/mmol) was from ICN; nucleoside 5′-triphosphates, 2′-deoxynucleoside 5′-triphosphates, 2′,3′-deoxynucleoside 5′-triphosphates (all nucleotides were ultrapure solutions), and poly(rA) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.; poly(rC) and poly(U) were from Sigma; all DNA oligonucleotides were from Operon Technologies, Inc. (Alameda, CA); all RNA oligonucleotides were from Dharmacon Research, Inc. (Boulder, CO); 10-base pair DNA ladder was from Life Technologies, Inc.; T4 polynucleotide kinase and calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase were from New England Biolabs, Inc.; MgCl2, MnCl2, ZnCl2, and CaCl2 were from Fisher; CuCl2, FeCl2, NiCl2, CoCl2, and GpG were from Sigma; polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plates were from EM Science; 2.5-cm DE81 filter paper discs were from Whatman. All other reagents were of the highest grade available from Sigma or Fisher. Expression and purification of 3Dpol was performed as described previously (23Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2706-2716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 24Gohara D.W. Ha C.S. Ghosh S.K.B. Arnold J.J. Wisniewski T.J. Cameron C.E. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 17: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). DNA and RNA oligonucleotides were purified by denaturing PAGE. Gels consisted of: 19% acrylamide, 1% bisacrylamide, 7 murea and 1 × TBE (89 mm Tris base, 89 mmboric acid, and 2 mm EDTA). The oligonucleotide ladder was visualized by UV shadowing. A gel slice containing only the full-length oligonucleotide was removed, and the nucleic acid was electroeluted from the gel in 1 × TBE by using an Elutrap apparatus (Schleicher & Schuell). Oligonucleotides were desalted on Sep-Pak columns (Millipore) as specified by the manufacturer. Oligonucleotides were typically suspended in T10E1 (10 mmTris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C until use. Concentrations were determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm by using calculated extinction coefficients (25Carroll S.S. Benseler F. Olsen D.B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 275: 365-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). [α-32P]NTPs were diluted to 0.1 μCi/μl in ddH2O, and 1 μl was spotted in triplicate onto TLC plates. TLC plates were developed in 0.3 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, dried, and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen. Imaging and quantitation were performed by using the ImageQuant software from Molecular Dynamics. The purity was used to correct the specific activity of NTP in reactions to calculate accurate concentrations of product. Purity was checked before or after each experiment and ranged from 50 to 90%. DNA and RNA oligonucleotides were end-labeled by using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase essentially as specified by the manufacturer. Reactions typically contained 11 μm [γ-32P]ATP, 10 μm DNA, or RNA oligonucleotide, and 0.4 unit/μl T4 polynucleotide kinase. Unincorporated nucleotide was removed by passing the sample over two consecutive 1-ml Sephadex G-25 (Sigma) spun columns. Labeling of the DNA ladder was performed by using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase as specified by Life Technologies, Inc. GpG was end-labeled by using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase essentially as specified by the manufacturer. Reactions typically contained 1 μm[γ-32P]ATP, 10 μm GpG, and 0.4 unit/μl T4 polynucleotide kinase. Reactions were quenched by heating the reaction at 60 °C for 5 min. 1 μm end-labeled RNA primer was mixed with 9 μm unlabeled RNA primer and 10 μm unlabeled RNA template in T10E1 and heated to 90 °C for 1 min and slowly cooled to 10 °C at a rate of approximately 5 °C/min in a Progene thermocycler. Reactions contained 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm MgCl2 or MnCl2, 60 μm ZnCl2, 500 μm NTP, primer/template and 3Dpol. Reactions were quenched by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 50 mm. Specific concentrations of primer/template and 3Dpol, along with any deviations from the above, are indicated below or in the appropriate figure legend. Reactions contained 0.5 μm 3Dpol, 500 μm nucleotide (UTP or GTP), 0.2 μCi/μl radiolabeled nucleotide ([α-32P]UTP or [α-32P]GTP), either MgCl2 or MnCl2 (5 mm) and either dT15 (1.88 μm) and poly(rA) (93.4 μm AMP), or dG15 (1.88 μm) and poly(rC) (93.4 μm CMP), or dT15/rA30 (1 μm) or dG15/rC30 (1 μm). Reactions were initiated by the addition of 3Dpol and incubated at 30 °C for 5 min. Reaction volumes were 25 μl. Reactions contained 3Dpol (0.1 μm), dG6 (4.7 μm), poly(rC) (93.4 μmCMP), GTP (500 μm), [α-32P]GTP (0.2 μCi/μl, 0.07 μm) and either MgCl2 or MnCl2. Reactions were initiated by addition of 3Dpol and incubated at 30 °C for 5 min at which time the reactions were quenched by addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 50 mm. Reaction volumes were 25 μl. Products were analyzed by DE81 filter binding. Reactions contained 3Dpol (0.5 μm), GTP (500 μm), [α-32P]GTP (0.2 μCi/μl, 0.07 μm), either MgCl2 (5 mm) or MnCl2 (5 mm) and either rC30 (10 μm), dC30 (10 μm), or poly(rC) (300 μm CMP). Reactions were initiated by addition of 3Dpol and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. Reaction volumes were 50 μl. Products were analyzed by DE81 filter binding. Kinetic constants, K M andV max, were determined by using the assay described above. The concentration of 3Dpol employed in these experiments ranged from 0.01 to 0.5 μm depending upon the substrate and cation employed. The V maxvalues reported in Table III have been normalized to 0.01 μm 3Dpol to facilitate comparison of the various substrates. Concentrations of the varied substrate, nucleic acid or nucleotide, ranged from 0.25 × K M to 4 × K M . The concentration of the substrate that remained constant was 5–10 × K M . Single time points were taken that were in the linear range for product formation. Reaction rates were plotted as a function of substrate concentration, and these data were fit to a hyperbola by nonlinear regression using the program KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA) to obtain the kinetic constants. In one instance, the determination of the K M value for GTP in the presence of MgCl2, the enzyme was not saturated with dG15/rC30 primer/template, thus theK M (app) is reported. However, the trueK M was calculated by using Equation 1.

Open table in a new tab Reactions contained 3Dpol (0.5 μm), dT15/rA30 (1 μm), UTP (500 μm), [α-32P]UTP (0.2 μCi/μl, 0.034 μm), and XCl2 (5 mm), whereX = Zn2+, Cu2+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, Co2+, and Mn2+. Reactions were initiated by addition of 3Dpol and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. Reaction volumes were 25 μl. In all cases, 5 mm was the optimal concentration for maximal activity. Products were analyzed by DE81 filter binding. Phosphatase reactions were performed by using calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase and either [α-32P]GTP- or [γ-32P]GTP-labeled RNA essentially as described by the manufacturer. Reactions contained 0.1 unit/μl calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase and either [α-32P]GTP-labeled RNA (300,000 cpm, 15 pmol) or [γ-32P]GTP-labeled RNA (300,000 cpm, 100 pmol). Reaction volumes were 50 μl. Reactions were initiated by addition of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase and incubated at 37 °C. Reactions were quenched by addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 50 mm. [α-32P]GTP- and [γ-32P]GTP-labeled RNA were prepared as follows: reactions contained 3Dpol (5 μm), rC30 (10 μm), GTP (500 μm), MnCl2 (5 mm), and either [α-32P]GTP (1 μCi/μl, 0.33 μm) or [γ-32P]GTP (4 μCi/μl, 0.68 μm). Reactions were initiated by addition of 3Dpol and incubated at 30 °C for 5 min at which time reactions were quenched by addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 50 mm. Each quenched reaction was passed over two consecutive 1-ml Sephadex G-25 spun columns to remove any unincorporated nucleotide. 10 μl of the quenched reaction was spotted onto DE81 filter paper discs and dried completely. The discs were washed three times for 10 min in 250 ml of 5% dibasic sodium phosphate and rinsed in absolute ethanol. Bound radioactivity was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting in 5 ml of Ecoscint scintillation fluid (National Diagnostics). 1 μl of the quenched reaction was spotted onto TLC plates. TLC plates were developed in 0.3 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, dried, and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen. Sample preparation and electrophoresis were as described previously (26Arnold J.J. Ghosh S.K.B. Bevilacqua P.C. Cameron C.E. BioTechniques. 1999; 27: 450-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μl of the quenched reaction was added to 9 μl of loading buffer: 90% formamide, 50 mm Tris borate, 0.025% bromphenol blue, 0.025% xylene cyanol and where appropriate a 10-fold excess of unlabeled RNA (trap strand) relative to the end-labeled RNA under investigation was added. Samples were heated to 70 °C for 2–5 min prior to loading 5 μl on a 1× TBE, 7 m urea polyacrylamide gel of the appropriate percentage. Highly cross-linked gels contained 2% bisacrylamide. Electrophoresis was performed in 1 × TBE at 75 watts. Gels were visualized and quantitated by using a PhosphorImager. We determined the effect of Mn2+ on 3Dpol-catalyzed nucleotide incorporation with the following substrates: dT15/poly(rA), dT15/rA30, dG15/poly(rC), and dG15/rC30 (Table I). The stimulation of 3Dpolactivity observed by using Mn2+ was substrate-dependent and varied from 5- to 100-fold the activity determined in the presence of Mg2+ (Table I). The 10-fold decrease in activity with dT15/poly(rA) was due, most likely, to a decrease in the solubility in the presence of Mn2+ as a white precipitate could be observed after centrifugation of this reaction mixture. The precipitate formed in the presence or absence of enzyme. This phenomenon was not observed with other primer/template substrates.Table IDivalent cation modulation of 3D pol poly(rU) and poly(rG) polymerase activitySubstrateActivityMg2+Mn2+pmol/min/μgdT15/poly(rA)1,00010dT15/rA3010100dG15/poly(rC)2001,000dG15/rC302200 Open table in a new tab The optimal concentration for maximal 3Dpol activity was 5 mm (Table II). Concentrations of divalent cation greater than 10 mm were inhibitory (Table II). The observed inhibition did not appear to be due to precipitation of nucleic acid and/or enzyme. The K M value for primer/template substrates was reduced by an average of 25-fold in the presence of Mn2+ relative to the corresponding values measured in the presence of Mg2+(Table III). A 3-fold reduction inV max was observed for dT15/rA30 by using Mn2+ instead of Mg2+; however, a 30-fold increase inV max was observed for dG15/rC30 by using Mn2+ instead of Mg2+. The K M values for UTP and GTP with the corresponding primer/template substrates were similar, 62 and 116 μm, respectively, and the V maxvalues were as expected based on the kinetic analysis of primer/template substrates discussed above. The increase inV max observed in the presence of Mn2+ when dG15/rC30 was employed did not result from a change in K M value for GTP (Table III). Thus, an increase in the number of productive 3Dpol-dG15/rC30 complexes formed may occur by using Mn2+ instead of Mg2+. Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Fe2+ supported higher levels of activity than Mg2+ (Table IV). Ca2+ and Cu2+ supported lower levels of activity than Mg2+ (Table IV). Zn2+ was incapable of supporting activity (Table IV).Table IIOptimal divalent cation concentration for maximal activity and RNA synthesis de novo: template specificityGMP incorporatedMg2+Mn2+pmolConcentration0.5 mm551721 mm3862,0582.5 mm6912,3565 mm8262,38410 mm7592,16250 mm0590SubstraterC30172,250dC3011,100Poly(rC)7009,900 Open table in a new tab Table IVDivalent cation specificity of 3D polDivalent cationUMP incorporatedpmolZn2+0Cu2+3Ca2+4Mg2+9Fe2+31Ni2+38Co2+97Mn2+275 Open table in a new tab Recently, we reported that 3Dpol initiates RNA synthesis when poly(rC) and GTP are employed as the sole substrates (23Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2706-2716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Primer-independent RNA synthesis did not result from a polynucleotide-phosphorylase-like activity as template was required (data not shown). Poly(rC) and GTP appear to be the most efficient substrates for this reaction as neither poly(rA) and UTP nor poly(rU) and ATP could be used to demonstrate convincingly synthesis of RNA (data not shown). In addition, rC30, but not dC30, was also a template for primer-independent RNA synthesis, albeit at a level 30-fold lower than observed by using poly(rC) (Table II). As shown in Table II, Mn2+ stimulated primer-independent RNA synthesis by 15-fold relative to reactions performed in the presence of Mg2+when either poly(rC) or rC30 was employed as template. In the presence of Mn2+, dC30 was also utilized as a template (Table II) and utilization of the dC30 template by 3Dpol was now only 2-fold less efficient than utilization of the rC30 template. Products of this reaction resolved by denaturing PAGE and visualized by phosphorimaging were greater than unit length and similar in appearance to those produced via template switching when dG15/rC30 and GTP are employed as substrates (23Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2706-2716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). What is the mechanism of initiation of these long RNA products? One possibility is that the terminal transferase activity of 3Dpol adds GMP to the 3′-end of rC30, thus creating a “snap-back” substrate that is efficiently extended by 3Dpol. However, by using a 5′-end-labeled rC30template, we were only able to show the incorporation of a single GMP into rC30 (data not shown). Moreover, the kinetics of formation of this product were too slow to support the hypothesis that rC30G RNA was the substrate used by 3Dpol to produce long products (data not shown). A second possibility is that RNA synthesis is initiated de novo. To test this possibility, we performed an experiment employing rC30 and [γ-32P]GTP as substrates. If RNA synthesis initiatesde novo, then long RNA products should incorporate the label. Product RNA was labeled by using [γ-32P]GTP, thus long products most likely result from de novoinitiation (Fig. 1 B). The primary product of this reaction was the dinucleotide, pppGpG. Also, tri-, tetra-, and pentanucleotide products were observed. The dinucleotide product was assigned based upon the comigration of this product with 32pGpG on polyacrylamide gels (data not shown). To keep a complete inventory of all products formed during the course of the reaction when [γ-32P]GTP was employed, reaction mixtures were also resolved by TLC; over half of the nucleotide was utilized based on PPi accumulation (Fig. 1 C). Phosphatase treatment of [γ-32P]GTP-labeled RNA showed a time-dependent loss of label by using the DE81 filter paper method (Fig. 2 A) and PAGE (Fig. 2 B) without any change in label associated with the control, [α-32P]GTP-labeled RNA (Fig. 2, Aand B). Greater than 95% of the counts associated with [γ-32P]GTP-labeled RNA originated from [γ-32P]GTP, thus confirming that this RNA was initiatedde novo.FIG. 2RNA synthesis de novo: phosphatase sensitivity of [γ-32P]GTP-labeled RNA products. [α-32P]GTP- and [γ-32P]GTP-labeled RNA were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Reactions contained calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (0.1 unit/μl) and either [α-32P]GTP-labeled RNA (300,000 cpm, 15 pmol) or [γ-32P]GTP-labeled RNA (300,000 cpm, 100 pmol). Reaction volumes were 50 μl. Reactions were initiated by addition of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase and incubated at 37 °C.

In Xenopus egg extracts, the inhibitory phosphorylations of Cdc2 on Tyr-15 and Thr-14 are controlled by the phosphatase Cdc25 and the kinases Myt1 and Wee1. At mitosis, Cdc25 is activated and Myt1 and Wee1 are inactivated through phosphorylation by multiple kinases, including Cdc2 itself. The Cdc2-associated Suc1/Cks1 protein (p9) is also essential for entry of egg extracts into mitosis, but the molecular basis of this requirement has been unknown. We find that p9 strongly stimulates the regulatory phosphorylations of Cdc25, Myt1, and Wee1 that are carried out by the Cdc2/cyclin B complex. Overexpression of the prolyl isomerase Pin1, which binds to the hyperphosphorylated forms of Cdc25, Myt1, and Wee1 found at M-phase, is known to block the initiation of mitosis in egg extracts. We have observed that Pin1 specifically antagonizes the stimulatory effect of p9 on phosphorylation of Cdc25 by Cdc2/cyclin B. This observation could explain why overexpression of Pin1 inhibits mitotic initiation. These findings suggest that p9 promotes the entry into mitosis by facilitating phosphorylation of the key upstream regulators of Cdc2.

We have observed that Pin1 specifically antagonizes the stimulatory effect of p9 on phosphorylation of Cdc25 by Cdc2/cyclin B. This observation could explain why overexpression of Pin1 inhibits mitotic initiation. These findings suggest that p9 promotes the entry into mitosis by facilitating phosphorylation of the key upstream regulators of Cdc2. M-phase promoting factor The entry into mitosis in eukaryotic cells is controlled by maturation or M-phase promoting factor (MPF)1 (1Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1802) Google Scholar). InXenopus egg extracts, MPF is a trimeric complex consisting of the protein kinase Cdc2, a B-type cyclin, and a small 9-kDa subunit called Xe-p9 (p9), a homolog of the Suc1/Cks protein (2Patra D. Dunphy W.G. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1503-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). MPF acts by carrying out key regulatory phosphorylations on various substrates that are involved in mitotic processes such as nuclear disassembly and chromosome transmission. In addition, MPF participates in regulatory circuits that control its “autocatalytic” activation at the G2/M transition (3Hoffmann I. Clarke P.R. Marcote M.J. Karsenti E. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 4Izumi T. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1337-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and its inactivation at the conclusion of M-phase, respectively (1Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1802) Google Scholar). During interphase, Cdc2 is kept inactive because of inhibitory phosphorylations on its Tyr-15 and Thr-14 residues. These modifications are catalyzed by the kinases Wee1 and Myt1 (1Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1802) Google Scholar). The dual-specificity phosphatase Cdc25 removes both inhibitory phosphates when the conditions are appropriate for mitosis, thereby activating Cdc2 (1Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1802) Google Scholar). Cdc25, Myt1, and Wee1 are all highly regulated during the cell cycle (5Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 139-151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 6Izumi T. Walker D.H. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol.

For example, these enzymes become highly phosphorylated at mitosis and concomitantly undergo large changes in their catalytic activities. In particular, the kinases Cdc2/cyclin B and Plx1 collaborate to carry out the stimulatory phosphorylations of Cdc25 (3Hoffmann I. Clarke P.R. Marcote M.J. Karsenti E. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 4Izumi T. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1337-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 5Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G.

Conversely, the Cdc2-specific kinase activities of both Myt1 and Wee1 are strongly down-regulated by phosphorylation at mitosis (7Mueller P.R. Coleman T.R. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 119-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 8Watanabe N. Broome M. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1878-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 9McGowan C.H. Russell P.

The Suc1/Cks protein is also essential for the proper regulation of Cdc2 in various species (2Patra D. Dunphy W.G. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1503-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 12Moreno S. Hayles J. Nurse P. Cell. 1989; 58: 361-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 13Tang Y.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1190-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In Xenopus egg extracts, p9 is required for both entry into and exit from mitosis (2Patra D. Dunphy W.G. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1503-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The role of p9 in mitotic exit is now understood in some detail. In particular, p9 is necessary for the destruction of cyclin B and the phosphorylation of various proteins associated with ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (e.g. Cdc27 and BIME) (16Patra D. Dunphy W.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2549-2559Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In the case of Cdc27, p9 was shown to strongly enhance the ability of Cdc2/cyclin B to phosphorylate recombinant Cdc27 without affecting the intrinsic catalytic activity of Cdc2, indicating that p9 facilitates substrate recognition (16Patra D. Dunphy W.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2549-2559Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 17Shteinberg M. Hershko A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Significantly, immunodepletion of p9 also prevents the entry of Xenopus interphase egg extracts into M-phase, but the molecular basis of this defect has not been resolved. In the absence of p9, the Cdc2/cyclin B complex accumulates in its inactive form that is phosphorylated on Tyr-15 and Thr-14, suggesting that p9 in some manner regulates the dephosphorylation of these residues. The Pin1 protein has recently emerged as another potential regulator of mitotic progression (18Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T. Science. 1996; 380: 544-547Google Scholar, 19Ranganathan R. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 20Shen M. Stukenberg P.T. Kirschner M.W. Lu K.P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 706-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 21Crenshaw D.G. Yang J. Means A.R. Kornbluth S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 22Lu P.J. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Lu K.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). The human Pin1 protein was identified in a yeast two-hybrid assay by virtue of its ability to interact with the mitotic regulatory kinase NIMA (18Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T. Science. 1996; 380: 544-547Google Scholar). Pin1 is a nuclear protein that has two structural domains: an N-terminal WW domain that is involved in protein-protein interactions and a C-terminal prolyl-isomerase domain. Depletion of Pin1 from HeLa cells results in a mitotic arrest, whereas overexpression of Pin1 in HeLa cells causes a G2 arrest (18Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T. Science. 1996; 380: 544-547Google Scholar). Similarly, the addition of excess recombinant human His6-Pin1 protein to cycling Xenopus egg extracts can block the entry of these extracts into mitosis (20Shen M. Stukenberg P.T. Kirschner M.W. Lu K.P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 706-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 21Crenshaw D.G. Yang J. Means A.R. Kornbluth S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). These studies indicated that Pin1 can impinge upon the Cdc2/cyclin B-dependent pathway of mitotic regulation. In this report, we have examined the requirement for p9 in regulating the G2/M transition. We find that p9 significantly stimulates the ability of a Cdc2/cyclin B complex to phosphorylate the mitotic regulators Cdc25, Myt1, and Wee1. This observation suggests that p9 plays an indispensable role in the “autocatalytic” activation of MPF at the G2/M transition. In the course of these studies, we also observed that excess Pin1 protein can antagonize the stimulatory effect of p9 on the phosphorylation of the regulators of Cdc2, suggesting that Pin1 may likewise participate in the activation of Cdc2. His6-Cdc25 and His6-Myt1 proteins were purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells as described (10Mueller P.R. Coleman T.R. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Science. 1995; 270: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 11Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Science. 1996; 273: 1377-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of these proteins was analyzed using 8% SDS gel electrophoresis. 35S-Labeled Xenopus Wee1 was synthesized using pET3a-XeWee1 as the template (7Mueller P.R. Coleman T.R. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 119-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) and the TNT in vitro transcription/translation system (Promega Corp.) in the presence of [35S]Translabel (ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Irvine, CA). Analysis of the phosphorylation products was performed by SDS-gel electrophoresis with a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.357% piperazine diacrylamide (Bio-Rad) instead of 0.267% bisacrylamide. Wild-type His6-Pin1 was expressed and purified from Escherichia coliBL21(DE3)pLysS cells using the pET28a-His6-Pin1 construct (18Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T. Science. 1996; 380: 544-547Google Scholar) as described (19Ranganathan R. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar) except that the protein was induced at an optical density of 0.5 (600 nm). A plasmid encoding the mutant His6-Pin1-W34A protein was constructed with the QuikChangeTM Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), using pET28a-His6-Pin1 as the template (18Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T. Science. 1996; 380: 544-547Google Scholar) and two oligonucleotides with the following sequences: 5′-CACATCACTAACGCTAGCCAGGCGGAGCGGCCCAGCG-3′ and 5′-CGCTGGGCCGCTCCGCCTGGCTAGCGTTAGTGATGTG-3′. This procedure resulted in the conversion of the Trp-34 to Ala (100TGG103 to100GCG103) as well as the insertion of a silent mutation in the coding region of His6-Pin1 (91GCC93 to 91GCT93) that allowed for the identification of the mutant clone by restriction analysis with NheI and EcoRV. These mutations were further confirmed by sequencing. The mutant His6-Pin1-W34A protein was then expressed and purified as described above for the wild-type protein. To assess the role that p9 plays in mitotic entry, we examined whether p9 would affect the Cdc2-dependent phosphorylation of various regulators of the G2/M transition. For this purpose, we incubated recombinant Xenopus Cdc25, Myt1, and Wee1 with a dimeric Cdc2/Δcyclin B complex or trimeric p9/Cdc2/Δcyclin B complex. For Cdc25 and Myt1, phosphorylation was assessed by monitoring 32P incorporation and mobility during gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 1 (top and middle panels), p9 strongly stimulated the incorporation of radioactive phosphate into both His6-Cdc25 and His6-Myt1. Furthermore, treatment with p9/Cdc2/Δcyclin B, but not Cdc2/Δcyclin B, resulted in a large decrease in the electrophoretic mobilities of both Cdc25 and Myt1, which is characteristic of the mitotic forms of these proteins. The presence of p9 in the Cdc2/Δcyclin B complex consistently resulted in a 4- to 5-fold increase in the appearance of the hyperphosphorylated forms of Cdc25 and Myt1. Because Xenopus Wee1 possesses substantial autophosphorylation activity and undergoes less extensive modification at mitosis, we assessed its phosphorylation by monitoring the shifting of 35S-Wee1 in SDS gels under modified electrophoretic conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”). We observed that p9 also significantly increased the phosphorylation of35S-Wee1 by Cdc2/Δcyclin B, but to a lesser degree than for Cdc25 and Myt1 (Fig. 1, bottom panel). The prolyl isomerase Pin1 binds to the phosphorylated forms of Cdc25, Myt1, and Wee1, as well as other mitotic phosphoproteins near the beginning of M-phase (18Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T. Science. 1996; 380: 544-547Google Scholar, 19Ranganathan R. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 20Shen M.

Overexpression of Pin1 in human cells (18Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T. Science. 1996; 380: 544-547Google Scholar) and Xenopus egg extracts inhibits the entry into mitosis (20Shen M. Stukenberg P.T. Kirschner M.W. Lu K.P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 706-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 21Crenshaw D.G. Yang J. Means A.R. Kornbluth S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Depletion of Pin1 from human cells by expression of an antisense construct and deletion of the gene encoding the budding yeast Pin1 homologue Ess1 both result in a defect in the progression through mitosis (18Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T. Science. 1996; 380: 544-547Google Scholar). Although the precise physiological role of Pin1 has not been established, these data collectively suggest that Pin1, like p9, plays some role both in the entry into and progression through mitosis. We asked whether Pin1 might affect the ability of p9 to stimulate substrate recognition by Cdc2/Δcyclin B. Recombinant His6-Pin1 (100 μg/ml) completely abolished the stimulatory effect of p9 on the Cdc2-catalyzed phosphorylation of His6-Cdc25 and His6-Myt1 (Fig. 2 A). In dose-response studies with His6-Cdc25 as the substrate, we observed that half-maximal inhibition of the p9-stimulated phosphorylation of Cdc25 occurred at ∼50 μg/ml His6-Pin1 (Fig. 2 B). Previously, the endogenous concentration of Pin1 in Xenopus egg extracts was estimated to be 0.5 μm or 9 μg/ml (20Shen M. Stukenberg P.T. Kirschner M.W. Lu K.P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 706-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recombinant Pin1 at a final concentration of 10 μm (180 μg/ml) completely blocked the entry of egg extracts into mitosis (20Shen M. Stukenberg P.T. Kirschner M.W. Lu K.P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 706-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Thus, the concentration of His6-Pin1 that inhibits the p9-dependent phosphorylation of Cdc25 by Cdc2/Δcyclin B is within the range previously established to block mitosis in egg extracts. In control experiments, we examined whether His6-Pin1 would affect the catalytic activity of p9/Cdc2/Δcyclin B toward the generic substrate histone H1. As shown in Fig. 2 C, up to 100 μg/ml His6-Pin1 had no effect on the ability of p9/Cdc2/Δcyclin B to phosphorylate histone H1. As reported previously (16Patra D. Dunphy W.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2549-2559Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), Cdc2/Δcyclin B and p9/Cdc2/Δcyclin B phosphorylated histone H1 with equal efficiency (Fig. 2 C, compare lanes a and b). The Cdc25 protein can also be phosphorylated and regulated by the Polo-like kinases (Plx1 in Xenopus) (11Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Science. 1996; 273: 1377-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). However, His6-Pin1 (100 μg/ml) had no inhibitory effect on the ability of Plx1 to phosphorylate Cdc25 in vitro (data not shown). Finally, we examined the possibility that His6-Pin1 might disrupt the binding of p9 to Cdc2/Δcyclin B because p9 does possess a proline-containing region that has been implicated in controlling the binding of Suc1/Cks proteins to cyclin-dependent kinases (23Bourne Y. Arvai A.S. Bernstein S.L. Watson M.H. Reed S.I. Endicott J.E. Noble M.E. Johnson L.N. Tainer J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1995; 92: 10232-10236Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 24Endicott J.A. Noble M.E. Garman E.F. Brown N. Rasmussen B. Nurse P. Johnson L.N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1004-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 25Bourne Y. Watson M.H. Hickey M.J. Holmes W. Rocque W. Reed S.I. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1996; 84: 863-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). By immunoblotting with anti-p9 antibodies (2Patra D. Dunphy W.G. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1503-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we observed that His6-Pin1 (100 μg/ml) did not affect the binding of p9 to Cdc2/Δcyclin B (data not shown). Pin1 consists of a carboxyl-terminal prolyl isomerase domain and an amino-terminal WW domain that binds to peptides containing phosphoserine or phosphothreonine (22Lu P.J. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Lu K.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Its WW domain is critical for the association of Pin1 with mitotic phosphoproteins such as Cdc25. To ask whether the WW domain of Pin1 is necessary for its ability to antagonize p9, we prepared the mutant His6-Pin1-W34A in which the function of the WW domain was abolished by mutagenesis of Trp-34 to Ala. As shown in Fig. 3, the mutant His6-Pin1-W34A, in contrast to wild-type His6-Pin1, was not able to inhibit the p9-stimulated hyperphosphorylation of Cdc25. In contrast, a form of Pin1 with a mutation in the prolyl isomerase domain (Pin1-H59A) (19Ranganathan R. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 20Shen M. Stukenberg P.T. Kirschner M.W. Lu K.P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 706-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) could still inhibit the stimulatory effect of p9 on the phosphorylation of Cdc25 (data not shown). Thus, the WW domain of Pin1 is crucial for its ability to impair the phosphorylation of Cdc25. In summary, one finding of this report is that p9 strongly enhances the ability of Cdc2 to phosphorylate its key upstream regulators (e.g. Cdc25, Myt1, and Wee1) (Fig. 4). Mitotic hyperphosphorylation results in up-regulation of Cdc25 (3Hoffmann I. Clarke P.R. Marcote M.J. Karsenti E. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 4Izumi T. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1337-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 5Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G.

Cell. 1992; 3: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and down-regulation of Wee1 (7Mueller P.R. Coleman T.R. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 119-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 8Watanabe N. Broome M. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1878-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 9McGowan C.H. Russell P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2166-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) and Myt1 (10Mueller P.R. Coleman T.R. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Science. 1995; 270: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), respectively. Cdc2/cyclin B appears to play a crucial role in these mitotic hyperphosphorylations. Although Plx1 and possibly other kinases participate in this process, it is not fully clear whether Plx1 acts upstream or downstream of Cdc2. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that the arrest of p9-depletedXenopus egg extracts in interphase can be attributed at least in part to a failure in the Cdc2-dependent hyperphosphorylation of Cdc25, Myt1, and Wee1. Consequently, Cdc25 could not be activated and both Myt1 and Wee1 could not be inactivated in the absence of p9. Thus, p9 should be regarded as an essential component of MPF. Conceivably, p9 could play an additional role(s) in regulating the G2/M transition, such as affecting the ability of Cdc25, Myt1, and Wee1 to modify Cdc2, but we have not been able to detect any effect of p9 on the catalytic functions of Cdc25, Myt1, and Wee1 (data not shown). In structural studies, the Suc1/Cks protein has been shown to contain a potential phosphate-binding pocket (25Bourne Y. Watson M.H. Hickey M.J. Holmes W. Rocque W. Reed S.I. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1996; 84: 863-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In principle, this pocket could allow p9 to dock onto phosphoproteins such as Cdc25, Myt1, and Wee1. In this event, p9 could stimulate the further phosphorylation of these proteins by Cdc2/cyclin B through its ability to increase the local concentration of Cdc2 in relation to its substrates. The action of p9 as a substrate-docking factor could help to explain the kinetics of mitotic entry in Xenopus egg extracts. In this system, the activation of Cdc2 by cyclin B requires a critical threshold concentration of cyclin B and involves a substantial lag period between the binding of cyclin B to Cdc2 and the ensuing activation of this complex (26Solomon M.J. Glotzer M. Lee T.H. Philippe M. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1990; 63: 1013-1024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Another conclusion of this study is that Pin1 can disrupt the stimulatory action of p9 through the ability of its WW domain to bind to the same regulators (e.g. Cdc25, Myt1, and Wee1) that are also substrates of p9/Cdc2/cyclin B (Fig. 4). The ability of Pin1 to block the activation of Cdc25 and inactivation of Wee1 and Myt1 could explain why overexpression of Pin1 blocks the entry into mitosis inXenopus egg extracts and human cells. There are conflicting reports about whether Pin1 can directly inhibit the phosphatase activity of Cdc25 (20Shen M. Stukenberg P.T. Kirschner M.W. Lu K.P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 706-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 21Crenshaw D.G. Yang J. Means A.R. Kornbluth S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), but we have not been able to observe an inhibitory effect of human Pin1 on the catalytic activity ofXenopus Cdc25 (data not shown). Thus, although Pin1 may be able to inhibit the catalytic function of Cdc25 under certain assay conditions, we suggest that overexpression of Pin1 blocks mitotic entry by compromising phosphorylation of the upstream regulators of Cdc2. These findings raise the possibility that p9 and Pin1 may normally play antagonistic roles in controlling the G2/M transition. However, at this time, it is not known whether inhibition of mitotic entry by Pin1 could reflect a physiological function of Pin1 or is instead a consequence of its overexpression. Further studies will be required to resolve conclusively the physiological role of Pin1 in cell cycle control.

https://openalex.org/W2055245856,"Human leukocyte chemoattractant receptors activate chemotactic and cytotoxic pathways to varying degrees and also activate different G-proteins depending on the receptor and the cell-type. To determine the relationship between G-protein usage and the biological and biochemical responses activated, receptors for the chemoattractants formyl peptides (FR), platelet-activating factor (PAFR), and leukotriene B4 (BLTR) were transfected into RBL-2H3 cells. Pertussis toxin (Ptx) served as a Gαiinhibitor. These receptors were chosen to represent the spectrum of Gi usage as Ptx had differential effects on their ability to induce calcium mobilization, phosphoinositide hydrolysis, and exocytosis with complete inhibition of all responses by FR, intermediate effects on BLTR, and little effect on PAFR. Ptx did not affect ligand-induced phosphorylation of PAFR and BLTR but inhibited phosphorylation of FR. In contrast, chemotaxis to formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine, leukotriene B4, and platelet-activating factor was completely blocked by Ptx. Wortmannin, a phosphotidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, also completely blocked ligand-induced chemotaxis by all receptors but did not affect calcium mobilization or phosphoinositide hydrolysis; however, it partially blocked the exocytosis response to formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine and the platelet-activating factor. Membrane ruffling and pseudopod extension via the BLTR was also completely inhibited by both Ptx and wortmannin. These data suggest that of the chemoattractant receptors studied, G-protein usage varies with FR being totally dependent on Gi, whereas BLTR and PAFR utilize both Gi and a Ptx-insensitive G-protein. Both Ptx-sensitive and -insensitive G-protein usage can mediate the activation of phospholipase C, mobilization of intracellular calcium, and exocytosis by chemoattractant receptors. Chemotaxis, however, had an absolute requirement for a Gi-mediated pathway. Human leukocyte chemoattractant receptors activate chemotactic and cytotoxic pathways to varying degrees and also activate different G-proteins depending on the receptor and the cell-type. To determine the relationship between G-protein usage and the biological and biochemical responses activated, receptors for the chemoattractants formyl peptides (FR), platelet-activating factor (PAFR), and leukotriene B4 (BLTR) were transfected into RBL-2H3 cells. Pertussis toxin (Ptx) served as a Gαiinhibitor. These receptors were chosen to represent the spectrum of Gi usage as Ptx had differential effects on their ability to induce calcium mobilization, phosphoinositide hydrolysis, and exocytosis with complete inhibition of all responses by FR, intermediate effects on BLTR, and little effect on PAFR. Ptx did not affect ligand-induced phosphorylation of PAFR and BLTR but inhibited phosphorylation of FR. In contrast, chemotaxis to formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine, leukotriene B4, and platelet-activating factor was completely blocked by Ptx. Wortmannin, a phosphotidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, also completely blocked ligand-induced chemotaxis by all receptors but did not affect calcium mobilization or phosphoinositide hydrolysis; however, it partially blocked the exocytosis response to formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine and the platelet-activating factor.

Previous studies in RBL cells indicated that FR activated Gi, whereas PAFR utilized both Giand a Ptx-insensitive G-protein to activate phosphoinositide hydrolysis, calcium mobilization, and exocytosis (11Ali H.

However, the G-protein usage requirements for activating chemotaxisversus exocytosis in these cells were unknown. Therefore, we sought to determine the relationship between G-protein usageversus the subsequent responses activated by these receptors in a single cell line viz. RBL-2H3 cells. Epitope-tagged BLTR, FR, and PAFR were expressed in RBL-2H3 cells, and inhibitors of signaling through Gi proteins (Ptx) and the PI3 kinase pathway (wortmannin) were used to determine the role of these pathways in pseudopod extension, chemotaxis, phospholipase C activation, calcium mobilization, and exocytosis. These data demonstrate distinct G-protein usage among chemoattractant receptors and suggest that a Gi-mediated pathway, presumably involving βγ and PI3 kinase, is required for motility-related functions. On the other hand, stimulation of phospholipase C activity, calcium mobilization, and exocytosis can be mediated through activation of a Ptx-insensitive G-protein as well as through Gi.DISCUSSIONExpression of chemoattractant receptors that activate different G-proteins in a single cell line allowed the determination of the role of specific G-proteins in activating distinct biological responses. The data show that chemoattractant receptors may activate phospholipase C, calcium mobilization, and exocytosis through multiple G-proteins, but ligand-stimulated pseudopod extension and chemotaxis require the activation of a Ptx-sensitive G-protein and PI3 kinase.Comparison of biochemical responses activated by FR, BLTR, and PAFR, all of which activate Gi, but couple to varying degrees to a Ptx-insensitive G-protein, allowed clear distinctions to be made for the role of G-proteins in different activities. Previous studies have indicated that receptor occupancy, but not signaling through G-proteins, is essential for receptor phosphorylation (20Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar, 21Prossnitz E.R. Gilbert T.L. Chiang S. Campbell J.J. Qin S. Newman W. Sklar L.A. Ye R.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2240-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Whereas the PAFR and BLTR were phosphorylated to similar levels in Ptx-treated cells, FR phosphorylation was inhibited. These data suggest that FR is likely phosphorylated by G-protein-coupled receptor kinases GRK2 or GRK3, because both require free βγ for translocation to membrane and activation (20Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). Studies on in vitro phosphorylation of the C terminus of FR also support this contention (22Prossnitz E.R. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1130-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Lack of any affect, by Ptx, on ligand-induced receptor phosphorylation of PAFR and BLTR indicates that signal transduction through the Ptx-sensitive G-protein is not required for this event.Previous studies in neutrophils and in transfected cell lines indicated that all FR responses are completely Ptx-sensitive (1Snyderman R. Uhing R.J. Gallin J.I. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. 3rd Ed. Lippincot Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia1999: 607-626Google Scholar, 11Ali H. Richardson R.M.

Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 23Verghese M.W. Charles L. Jakoi L. Dillon S.B. Snyderman R. J.

Our previous observations in RBL cells showed that calcium mobilization was only marginally affected and phosphotidylinositol hydrolysis was partially inhibited by Ptx, which suggests that PAFR activate a Ptx-insensitive G-protein in RBL cells (12Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. DuBose R.A. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24557-24563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PAFR activated sufficient levels of Ptx-insensitive G-protein in these cells to cause exocytosis. The current studies show that like PAFR, BLTR expressed in RBL cells could utilize a Ptx-insensitive G-protein to activate phosphotidylinositol hydrolysis and mobilize intracellular calcium. However, the most significant finding of the current study is that despite activating different G-proteins all three receptors displayed an absolute requirement for Gi to activate chemotaxis. This suggests that signal transduction pathways activated through Ptx-insensitive G-proteins are not sufficient, and the activation of a Gi-mediated event is essential for chemotaxis. Recent studies also indicate that βγ-mediated responses are essential for cell migration (25Neptune E.R. Bourne H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14489-14494Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 26Arai H. Tsou C.L. Charo I.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2824-2828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The data presented herein indicates that this βγ must come from the activation of a Ptx-sensitive G-protein, presumably Gi. The βγ released from a Ptx-insensitive G-protein by the same chemoattractant receptor was not sufficient for chemotaxis.The single cell manipulation assay has provided a means to correlate biochemical and motility-related cellular responses. The ability of RBL cells to extend a pseudopod similar to the one produced by leukocytes suggests molecular events in the migration of leukocytes and transfected RBL cells are related (19Zhelev D.V. Alteraifi A.M. Hochmuth R.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 35: 331-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Whereas cell lines of non-lymphoid origin like Chinese hamster ovary cells and HEK 293 cells also undergo chemotaxis (7Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 25Neptune E.R. Bourne H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14489-14494Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), it is not known whether they use similar pathways or cytoskeletal processes as leukocytes for migration. In wortmannin-treated RBL cells, the low level of chemotactic responsiveness was associated with weak membrane ruffling and no pseudopod extension (Fig. 5). These results again underscore the dissociation of chemotaxis from the calcium release and exocytosis, which remain unaffected by wortmannin.The unique biochemical pathways activated by the βγ subunits of Gi proteins that mediate chemotaxis are at present unknown. The βγ induced PI3 kinase activity, and its related signaling pathway could be one of these events (28Hartwig J.H. Bokoch G.M. Carpenter C.L. Janmey P.A. Taylor L.A. Toker A. Stossel T.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 643-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 29Knall C. Worthen G.S. Johnson G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1997; 390: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Other studies also indicated that GTPγS could activate actin polymerization in soluble cell extracts of leukocytes in the presence of the low molecular weight G-protein CDC42 but not Rho or Rac (31Tapon N. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 32Zigmond S.H. Joyce M. Borleis J. Bokoch G.M. Devreotes P.N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Therefore it is possible that βγ dimers released from Gi, but not the Gq family of G-proteins, activate one or more low molecular weight G-proteins that may participate in leukocyte migration. In any case, the data clearly demonstrate that chemoattractant receptors may couple to individual or multiple G-proteins. To stimulate chemotaxis however, they must activate Gi. Moreover, distinct signaling pathways among G-proteins are likely to determine other cellular responses initiated by chemoattractant receptors. These data may explain numerous observations in neutrophils and other cells that different chemoattractant receptors display different abilities to trigger nonmotility-related functions (i.e. respiratory burst, mitogenesis) despite exhibiting similar chemotactic responses (1Snyderman R. Uhing R.J. Gallin J.I. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. 3rd Ed. Lippincot Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia1999: 607-626Google Scholar, 23Verghese M.W. Charles L. Jakoi L. Dillon S.B. Snyderman R. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 4374-4380PubMed Google Scholar). The availability of a model system in which migration responses may be measured both at population and single cell levels will allow further investigation of the divergent pathways for motility and cytotoxic functions. Migration of leukocytes to sites of inflammation is mediated via the activation of G-protein-coupled chemoattractant receptors (1Snyderman R. Uhing R.J. Gallin J.I. Snyderman R.

Nature. 1997; 390: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Other studies also indicated that GTPγS could activate actin polymerization in soluble cell extracts of leukocytes in the presence of the low molecular weight G-protein CDC42 but not Rho or Rac (31Tapon N. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 32Zigmond S.H. Joyce M. Borleis J. Bokoch G.M. Devreotes P.N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Therefore it is possible that βγ dimers released from Gi, but not the Gq family of G-proteins, activate one or more low molecular weight G-proteins that may participate in leukocyte migration. In any case, the data clearly demonstrate that chemoattractant receptors may couple to individual or multiple G-proteins. To stimulate chemotaxis however, they must activate Gi. Moreover, distinct signaling pathways among G-proteins are likely to determine other cellular responses initiated by chemoattractant receptors. These data may explain numerous observations in neutrophils and other cells that different chemoattractant receptors display different abilities to trigger nonmotility-related functions (i.e. respiratory burst, mitogenesis) despite exhibiting similar chemotactic responses (1Snyderman R. Uhing R.J. Gallin J.I. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. 3rd Ed. Lippincot Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia1999: 607-626Google Scholar, 23Verghese M.W. Charles L. Jakoi L. Dillon S.B. Snyderman R. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 4374-4380PubMed Google Scholar). The availability of a model system in which migration responses may be measured both at population and single cell levels will allow further investigation of the divergent pathways for motility and cytotoxic functions. Expression of chemoattractant receptors that activate different G-proteins in a single cell line allowed the determination of the role of specific G-proteins in activating distinct biological responses. The data show that chemoattractant receptors may activate phospholipase C, calcium mobilization, and exocytosis through multiple G-proteins, but ligand-stimulated pseudopod extension and chemotaxis require the activation of a Ptx-sensitive G-protein and PI3 kinase. Comparison of biochemical responses activated by FR, BLTR, and PAFR, all of which activate Gi, but couple to varying degrees to a Ptx-insensitive G-protein, allowed clear distinctions to be made for the role of G-proteins in different activities. Previous studies have indicated that receptor occupancy, but not signaling through G-proteins, is essential for receptor phosphorylation (20Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar, 21Prossnitz E.R. Gilbert T.L. Chiang S. Campbell J.J. Qin S. Newman W. Sklar L.A. Ye R.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2240-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Whereas the PAFR and BLTR were phosphorylated to similar levels in Ptx-treated cells, FR phosphorylation was inhibited. These data suggest that FR is likely phosphorylated by G-protein-coupled receptor kinases GRK2 or GRK3, because both require free βγ for translocation to membrane and activation (20Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). Studies on in vitro phosphorylation of the C terminus of FR also support this contention (22Prossnitz E.R. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1130-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Lack of any affect, by Ptx, on ligand-induced receptor phosphorylation of PAFR and BLTR indicates that signal transduction through the Ptx-sensitive G-protein is not required for this event. Previous studies in neutrophils and in transfected cell lines indicated that all FR responses are completely Ptx-sensitive (1Snyderman R. Uhing R.J. Gallin J.I. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. 3rd Ed. Lippincot Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia1999: 607-626Google Scholar, 11Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R.

In contrast, both PAFR and BLTR can activate Ptx-insensitive G-proteins as well as Gi (7Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 23Verghese M.W. Charles L. Jakoi L. Dillon S.B. Snyderman R. J.

Our previous observations in RBL cells showed that calcium mobilization was only marginally affected and phosphotidylinositol hydrolysis was partially inhibited by Ptx, which suggests that PAFR activate a Ptx-insensitive G-protein in RBL cells (12Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. DuBose R.A. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24557-24563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PAFR activated sufficient levels of Ptx-insensitive G-protein in these cells to cause exocytosis. The current studies show that like PAFR, BLTR expressed in RBL cells could utilize a Ptx-insensitive G-protein to activate phosphotidylinositol hydrolysis and mobilize intracellular calcium. However, the most significant finding of the current study is that despite activating different G-proteins all three receptors displayed an absolute requirement for Gi to activate chemotaxis. This suggests that signal transduction pathways activated through Ptx-insensitive G-proteins are not sufficient, and the activation of a Gi-mediated event is essential for chemotaxis. Recent studies also indicate that βγ-mediated responses are essential for cell migration (25Neptune E.R. Bourne H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14489-14494Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 26Arai H. Tsou C.L. Charo I.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2824-2828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The data presented herein indicates that this βγ must come from the activation of a Ptx-sensitive G-protein, presumably Gi. The βγ released from a Ptx-insensitive G-protein by the same chemoattractant receptor was not sufficient for chemotaxis. The single cell manipulation assay has provided a means to correlate biochemical and motility-related cellular responses. The ability of RBL cells to extend a pseudopod similar to the one produced by leukocytes suggests molecular events in the migration of leukocytes and transfected RBL cells are related (19Zhelev D.V. Alteraifi A.M. Hochmuth R.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 35: 331-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Whereas cell lines of non-lymphoid origin like Chinese hamster ovary cells and HEK 293 cells also undergo chemotaxis (7Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 25Neptune E.R. Bourne H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14489-14494Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), it is not known whether they use similar pathways or cytoskeletal processes as leukocytes for migration. In wortmannin-treated RBL cells, the low level of chemotactic responsiveness was associated with weak membrane ruffling and no pseudopod extension (Fig. 5). These results again underscore the dissociation of chemotaxis from the calcium release and exocytosis, which remain unaffected by wortmannin. The unique biochemical pathways activated by the βγ subunits of Gi proteins that mediate chemotaxis are at present unknown. The βγ induced PI3 kinase activity, and its related signaling pathway could be one of these events (28Hartwig J.H. Bokoch G.M. Carpenter C.L. Janmey P.A. Taylor L.A. Toker A. Stossel T.P.

The α-carbon of the conserved lysine present near the C-terminal end of the transmembrane helix (Lys1125 in α2, Lys1022 in α5, Lys752 in β1, and Lys724 in β2) is buried in the plasma membrane, and the charged amino group most likely reaches into the polar head-group region of the lipid bilayer.

A possible role for the conserved lysine in integrin function is discussed. transmembrane helix leader peptidase minimal glycosylation distance receptor for activated protein kinase C Integrins are cell adhesive receptors composed of non-covalently linked α and β subunits. Each subunit consists of a large extracellular domain, a transmembrane helix (TMH),1 and a short cytoplasmic tail of usually less than 60 amino acids. Cell attachment to extracellular matrix via integrins is necessary for normal cell growth and differentiation. Integrins are also involved in cellular processes that require migration of cells, e.g. angiogenesis and extravasation of lymphocytes. Upon ligand binding, clustering of integrins leads to formation of focal contacts containing signaling complexes (1Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1469) Google Scholar, 2Hynes R.O. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The short cytoplasmic domains of integrin β subunits have multiple functions: to establish contact with the actin cytoskeleton, to start signaling cascades, and to regulate the conformation of the extracellular domain of the receptor and thereby the ability to bind extracellular ligands (3Chen Y.P. O'Toole T.E. Shipley T. Forsyth J. LaFlamme S.E. Yamada K.M. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18307-18310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kawaguchi S. Hemler M.E. J.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). All these functions depend on interactions with cytoplasmic proteins, some of which mediate outside-in signaling and some that regulate extracellular ligand binding affinity (so called inside-out signaling) (7Fernandez C. Clark K. Burrows L. Schofield N.R. Humphries M.J. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 684-700Crossref Google Scholar). α subunits of integrins appear to have a regulatory role over the β subunits, possibly by hindering β subunits from binding to cytosolic proteins in the absence of bound extracellular ligand (8Kawaguchi S. Bergelson J.M. Finberg R.W. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 977-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 9Kassner P.D. Kawaguchi S. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19859-19867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, specific signals are also generated by cytoplasmic tails of α subunits (10Shaw L.M. Turner C.E. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23648-23652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 11Zhang Z. Vuori K. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 867-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Thus, the cytoplasmic domains are indispensable for proper functioning of integrins as demonstrated by many studies. However, for both integrin subunits, the border between the cytoplasmic domain and the C-terminal end of the transmembrane domain is unclear. Usually the cytoplasmic domain of integrins is assumed by most authors to start at the first charged residue after the continuous stretch of 23 hydrophobic amino acids. In a few cases the cytoplasmic domain has instead been suggested to be 4 and 5 amino acids shorter for the α and β subunits, respectively (see Fig. 1) (13Argraves W.S. Suzuki S. Arai H. Thompson K.

Interestingly, all presently known α and β subunits, except for β4, exhibit a similar pattern in this region: a single conserved, positively charged amino acid (Lys/Arg), a short stretch of hydrophobic amino acids, and highly polar sequence unlikely to be buried in the plasma membrane. The regions between and C-terminally adjacent to the predicted ends of the TMHs of α and β subunits (Fig. 1) are involved in affinity regulation and in dimerization of integrins (4Kawaguchi S.

In this study, we have used a glycosylation mapping technique to determine the position of the C-terminal end of the TMHs of human integrin α subunits (α2, α5) and β subunits (β1, β2) in microsomal membranes. Our results establish that the α-carbon of the conserved lysine and the following short hydrophobic stretch of all tested subunits are buried in the membrane. Possible functional implications of this finding are discussed. Unless otherwise stated, all enzymes were from Promega and MBI Fermentas AB. Ribonucleotides, deoxyribonucleotides, dideoxyribonucleotides, the cap analog m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G, T7 DNA polymerase, and [35S]Met were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The plasmid pGEM1, dithiothreitol, bovine serum albumin, RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor, and rabbit reticulocyte lysate were from Promega. Spermidine was from Sigma. Oligonucleotides were from Kebo Lab (Stockholm, Sweden) and DNA Technology (Aarhus, Denmark). The pGEM1-based Lep vectors coding for a glycosylation acceptor site at different positions have been described (21Nilsson I. Sääf A. Whitley P. Gafelin Waller C. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1165-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Introduction of the TMHs of human integrin subunits α5, α2, β1, β2 in Lep was performed by replacing the H2 segment (bracketed by BclI-NdeI restriction sites) by the appropriate fragments amplified by polymerase chain reaction from the corresponding cDNAs. For the amplification of the TMH of the integrin subunits, the following primers were used: α5, α5TMu (5′-TTTAATCATATGAGCGTTTGAAGAATCCAAG-3′) and α5TMd (5′-TTTATATTGATCAACTGTCCTACTGGTCCCG-3′); for α2, α2TMu (5′-TTTATATTGATCACTGATGAGAAAGCCGAAGTA-3′) and α2TMd (5′-ATTTAATCATATGATCTTTTGAAGAAGCCGAG-3′); for β1, β1TMu (5′-ATTTAATCATATGACCTTCTGTCATGAATTATCAT-3′) and β1TMd (5′-TTTATATTGATCACCAAGGCAGAAGGCAGC-3′); and for β2, β2TMu (5′-TTTATATTGATCAACTGTGTGGCAGGCCCCAAC-3′) and β2TMd (5′- ATTTAATCATATGACCGGAGGTCGCTCAGGTGG-3′). Residues 59–81 in H2 were thus replaced by residues 723–761 of β1, 695–733 of β2, 1096–1131 of α2, and 989–1028 of α5, respectively. In the glycosylation constructs Asn84-Ser85-Thr86 and Asn88-Ser89-Thr90 (numbering corresponding to the Lep wild type sequence), the flanking Pro residues were changed to Gln, since such flanking prolines reduce the efficiency of glycosylation (22Monné M. Nilsson I. Elhmed N. Johansson M. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1177-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 23Mellquist J.L. Kasturi L. Spitalnik S.L. Shakin-Eshleman S.H.

The mutations L753K (L-K753) and LLMII5753–757N5 (5N753–757) in β1 TMH were introduced by the polymerase chain reaction method using antisense primers β1TML-K (5′-TTTAATTCATATGACCTTCTGTCATGAATTATCATT AACTTTTTCCAAATC-3′) and β1TM5N (5′-TTTAATCATATGACCTTCTGT CATGATTGTTATTGTTATTTTTCCAAATT-3′), respectively, together with the sense primer β1TMu. The designed mutations were generated by the underlined nucleotides. The amino acids HDRR in β1 constructs Lep-β1L-K753 and Lep-β15 5N753–757 were deleted by using shorter antisense primers in polymerase chain reaction reactions: for L-K753β1TMΔL-K (5′-TTTAATCATATGAAATTATCATTACTTTTTCCAAATC-3′), and for 5N753–757 β1TMΔ5N (5′-TTTAATCATATGAATTGTTATTGTTATTTTTCCAAATC-3′). Conditions for the polymerase chain reaction cycles were 95 °C for 15 sec, 55 °C for 30 sec, and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by a final extension for 10 min. The number of cycles used was 30. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing of plasmid or single-stranded M13 DNA using T7 DNA polymerase and ALFexpress, (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Synthesis of mRNA from pGEM1 by SP6 RNA polymerase and translation in reticulocyte lysate in the presence and absence of dog pancreas microsomes was performed as described (25Liljeström P. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 147-154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and gels were quantitated on a Fuji BAS1000 phosphoimager using the MacBAS 2.31 software. The extent of glycosylation of a given construct was calculated as the quotient between the intensity of the glycosylated band divided by the summed intensities of the glycosylated and nonglycosylated bands. In general, the glycosylation efficiency varies by no more than ± 5% between different experiments, and the precision in the minimal glycosylation distance (MGD) determinations is ± 0.2 residues. The glycosylation mapping technique has previously been described in detail (21Nilsson I. Sääf A. Whitley P. Gafelin Waller C. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1165-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Briefly, the lumenally oriented active site of the endoplasmic reticulum enzyme oligosaccharyltransferase was used as a fixed point of reference against which the position of a TMH in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane could be measured (Fig. 2 A). Based on the variation in glycosylation efficiency for a set of constructs differing only in the position of a glycosylation acceptor site, it was possible to define a MGD, i.e. the number of residues in the nascent chain needed to bridge the distance between the end of the TMH and the oligosaccharyltransferase active site. By calibration of the MGD scale against TMHs whose position in the lipid bilayer had been determined by direct techniques such as x-ray crystallography, NMR, or fluorescence quenching measurements, the point where a TMH exited from the lipid environment could be determined to within less than ± 1 residue. Previously, we used this technique to study how the position of model TMHs in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane changed in response to single mutations such as the introduction of a proline or a charged residue (21Nilsson I. Sääf A. Whitley P. Gafelin Waller C. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1165-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 22Monné M. Nilsson I. Elhmed N. Johansson M. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1177-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We had also calibrated our measurements against two different TMHs of known position in the membrane, the TMH of the H-subunit from the photosynthetic reaction center and the TMH from the phage M13 major coat protein, as well as against model poly-Leu TMHs of varying lengths (21Nilsson I. Sääf A. Whitley P. Gafelin Waller C. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1165-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 22Monné M. Nilsson I. Elhmed N. Johansson M. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1177-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These studies showed that the MGD measured from the first residue after the hydrophobic region of a typical TMH is 9.5–10.5 residues. For the studies of the TMH of α subunits, a segment encoding residues 989–1028 was amplified from the α5 and 1096–1131 from α2 cDNAs and cloned into a series of previously constructed vectors based on the well characterized protein leader peptidase (Lep) (Fig. 2 A). The vectors differ only in the position of a single Asn-Ser-Thr glycosylation acceptor site downstream of the TMH and, thus, allow facile determination of the C-terminal MGD for any TMH. The results of in vitro transcription/translation of three Lep-α2 and Lep-α5 constructs in the absence and presence of dog pancreas microsomes are shown in Fig. 2 B, and the MGD-determination is shown in Fig. 2 C. Essentially identical results were obtained for both tested α subunits. The glycosylation efficiency drops from 54% for the Asn88 construct to 6% for the Asn87 construct for α2 subunit and from 85% for the Asn88 construct to 6% for the Asn87construct for α5 subunit. Since the expected MGD value for a TMH longer than ∼23 residues is ∼10 residues (21Nilsson I. Sääf A. Whitley P. Gafelin Waller C. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1165-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), this allows the C terminus of the TMHs of α2 and α5 to be positioned relative to the reference TMHs (Fig. 2 D). Even with allowance for a rather wide margin of error, this clearly places the α-carbon of Lys1125 in α2 and Lys1022 in α5 more than one helical turn below the membrane-water interface, similar to the position of Lys40 in M13 coat protein (26Spruijt R.B. Wolfs C.J. Verver J.W. Hemminga M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10383-10391Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 27Stopar D. Spruijt R.B. Wolfs C.J. Hemminga M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15467-15473Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and to single lysine mutations in a poly-Leu TMH (22Monné M. Nilsson I. Elhmed N. Johansson M. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1177-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Similarly, for the studies of β subunits, a segment encoding residues 723–761 from the β1 and 695–933 from the β2 cDNAs was amplified and cloned into the Lep vectors. Very similar results were obtained (Fig. 2, B and C), placing the α-carbon of Lys752 in β1 and Lys724 in β2 well below the membrane-water interface (Fig. 2 D). We conclude that the membrane-embedded parts of the TMHs of the α subunits extend roughly to Phe1129 in α2 and to Phe1026 in α5. For the β subunits, the TMH of β1 extends to Ile757, and the TMH of β2, to His723. As proposed in the so-called snorkel model (28Gavel Y. Nilsson L. von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 1988; 235: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 29Mishra V.K. Palgunachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Biol.

Proteins. 1990; 8: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), the long, aliphatic part of the side chain of the membrane-embedded Lys in integrin α and β subunits most likely extends toward the membrane surface, placing the positively charged terminal amino group in the polar head-group region of the lipid bilayer. To confirm our interpretation of the glycosylation mapping data, we constructed two derivatives of the β1 TMH: one where the entire hydrophobic segment between Lys752 and His758 was replaced by Asn residues (β1Δ5N), and one where Leu753 was replaced by Lys (β1ΔL-K) (Fig. 3 A). Since both Asn82 constructs were fully glycosylated (data not shown), the four residues HDRR near the lipid-water interface were deleted to facilitate the MGD determination. For both β1Δ5N and β1ΔL-K, the MGD measurement indicated a substantial shift in the position of the TMH in the membrane (Fig. 3 B). Although we have only determined the MGD to within ± 1 residue in this case, it is nevertheless clear that Lys752 is positioned much closer to the membrane-water interface in these constructs (Fig. 2 D). This demonstrates that the hydrophobic segment between Lys752 and His758 in wild type β1 is embedded in the membrane and that it is pushed out of the membrane when its hydrophobicity is reduced. In this study the glycosylation mapping technique has been used to determine the position of the TMHs of two human integrin α and β subunits in the microsomal membrane. The TMHs of the α subunits were found roughly to Phe1129 in α2 and to Phe1026in α5, and the TMHs of the β subunits were found to extend to Ile757 in β1 and to His728 in β2. Interestingly, the α-carbon of the single positively charged amino acid present near the C-terminal end of the TMHs (Lys1125in α2, Lys1022 in α5, Lys752 in β1, and Lys724 in β2) was buried in the membrane in all cases. Thus, the same result was obtained, irrespective of whether tryptophan or tyrosine is N-terminally adjacent to the conserved sequence KXGFFKR of the α subunits. Reductions in the hydrophobicity of the short hydrophobic stretch downstream of Lys752 in the β1 TMH caused a shift in the position of Lys752 relative to the membrane, confirming that the hydrophobic segment between Lys752 and His758is indeed buried in the membrane in the wild type protein. These results were obtained using microsomal membranes; however, the integrin TMHs can be accommodated in the same way also in the plasma membrane, which actually is thicker than microsomal membranes. The highly conserved motif KXGFFKR at the C-terminal end of the α subunit TMH is known to be critically important for integrin function, although the phenotypic effects of modification in this region vary between different integrins. Deletion of the motif from αIIb results in a constitutive high affinity state of the αIIbβ3 integrin. Similarly, deletion of LLITIHD in β3, the opposing region of KXGFFKR motif in αIIb, also leads to a high affinity state of the receptor. It has been suggested that the amino acids Arg and Asp in these motifs form a salt bridge and that breaking the bridge locks the integrin in a conformation corresponding to a high affinity state (16Hughes P.E.

This idea is further supported by molecular modeling on integrin subunits αIIb and β3 showing that the LLITIHD sequence in β3 and the KXGFFKR motif in αIIb are likely to be associated (31Haas T.A. Plow E.F. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1395-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Similarly, deletion of VGFFK in αL increases the affinity of the αLβ2 integrin, but in this case the mutation also interferes with post-ligand binding events dependent on the cytoskeleton (19Lu C.F. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 268-278PubMed Google Scholar, 32Peter K. O'Toole T.E. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In addition, the KXGFFKR motif has been shown to promote the assembly and/or stabilization of the αLβ2 heterodimer (18Pardi R. Bossi G. Inverardi L. Rovida E. Bender J.R. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1252-1263PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lu C.F. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 268-278PubMed Google Scholar) as well as of several β1 integrins (4Kawaguchi S. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16279-16285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20De Melker A.A. Kramer D. Kuikman I. Sonnenberg A. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These regions have been demonstrated to interact with a variety of different proteins. The intracellular calcium-binding protein calreticulin was reported to bind the sequence KXGFFKR in α subunits, and this interaction may be required for integrin activation (33Coppolino M.

Grinstein S. St. Arnaud R. Dedhar S. Nature. 1997; 386: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). A recent report by Coppolino and Dedhar shows that interaction between α subunits and calreticulin is ligand-specific and transient, occurring shortly after ligand binding (35Coppolino M.G. Dedhar S. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The synthetic peptide KLLMIIHDRREFA derived from the β1 sequence was found to interact with focal adhesion kinase in vitro (36Schaller M.D. Otey C.A. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Focal adhesion kinase is known to be involved in integrin-mediated signaling (37Guan J.L. Matrix Biol. 1997; 16: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) but appears not to be required for integrin activation (38Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar). Recently, the proteins Rack1 and skelemin were shown to bind to the membrane-proximal region of β-subunits in yeast two-hybrid assay (39Liliental J. Chang D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2379-2383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 40Reddy K.B. Gascard P. Price M.G. Negrescu E.V. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35039-35047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Rack1 binding to β1 and β2 integrins requires activation of protein kinase, which is one of the early events after ligand binding of integrins (41Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21459-21462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Lewis J.M. Cheresh D.A. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1323-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and Rack1 may recruit protein kinase C to adhesion complexes by its ability to bind integrins. However, the functional role of Rack1 in integrin signaling remains to be elucidated. Muscle skelemin was found to bind β1 and β3 subunits but not to β2. In Chinese hamster ovary cells the skelemin-like protein colocalized with integrins at early stages of cell spreading (40Reddy K.B. Gascard P. Price M.G. Negrescu E.V. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35039-35047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Our results show that the KLGFF sequence in α2 and α5, KLLMII in β1, and KALIH in β2 are buried in the membrane in the absence of interacting proteins. Why, then, is a transmembrane lysine conserved in all known integrin subunits (17 α and 8 β subunits)? One possibility is presented in Fig. 4 A. This model is based on the studies discussed above, demonstrating that the regions between arrows1 and 2 in Fig. 1 are involved in interactions with intracellular proteins and, thus, are likely to be exposed to the cytoplasm. The charged residue may facilitate a transfer of this region out of the hydrophobic environment as a result of binding to intracellular proteins. Such a movement could trigger the conformational changes associated with integrin activation and/or ligand binding. The possibility that the position of the conserved lysine and the following stretch of hydrophobic amino acids in the plasma membrane may contribute to the transmembrane signaling of integrins was first discussed by Williams et al. (43Williams M.J. Hughes P.E. O'Toole T.E. Ginsberg M.H. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 109-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Our study provides supporting evidence for this view. We suggest that this region in one or both of the integrin subunits is positioned differently relative to the plasma membrane depending on the affinity state of the receptor. For example, in the inactive conformation, the Cαs of the lysines could be buried in the plasma membrane. In this situation the TMHs would probably be tilted in the membrane due to their length, and the α and β subunits could associate close to the cytoplasm,e.g. via the Asp-Arg bridge. Upon integrin activation, the TMHs would be shortened by 4–5 amino acids, possibly induced by binding of cytosolic proteins to the cytoplasmic tails of integrin subunits. The tension exerted by actin cytoskeleton toward integrin clusters may also have a role in preventing backsliding of the mobile region (Fig. 4 A). Only a few studies have directly addressed the role of the conserved TMH Lys (e.g. Lys752 in human β1 subunit) in integrin function. Mutation of the Lys in α1 (Lys to Asp) did not impair the α1β1-mediated adhesion to collagen IV but resulted in localization of α1β1 to focal contacts also on a fibronectin substrate (44Briesewitz R. Kern A. Smilenov L.B. David F.S. Marcantonio E.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1499-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The phenomenon of ligand-independent clustering of integrins in focal contacts has been suggested to reflect a disturbed interaction between the α- and β-cytoplasmic domains, resulting in unmasking of binding sites in the β-tail for components in existing focal contacts (8Kawaguchi S. Bergelson J.M. Finberg R.W. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 977-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 44Briesewitz R. Kern A. Smilenov L.B. David F.S. Marcantonio E.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1499-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 45Wennerberg K. Fässler R. Wärmegård B. Johansson S. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1117-1126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutated chicken β1 subunit (Lys to Leu) was also found to localize to focal contacts when expressed in mouse NIH 3T3 cells (46Hayashi Y. Haimovich B. Reszka A. Boettiger D. Horwitz A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), but in this case it is unclear whether the mutated receptor localized to focal contacts in a ligand-dependent or -independent manner. It is also unknown if this mutation affects the conformation of the extracellular domain. Another possible role for the positively charged residues in the TMHs of integrins could be to promote interactions with other membrane proteins (Fig. 4 B). This would be analogous to the T-cell receptor complex, which depends on charged amino acids in the TMHs for assembly and surface expression on T-cells (47Cosson P. Lankford S.P. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1991; 351: 414-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The T-cell receptor complex is stabilized in the endoplasmic reticulum by salt bridges between negatively charged residues in TMH of CD3 and positively charged residues in TMHs of T-cell receptor chains. In this context it is interesting that several tetraspanin proteins implicated in integrin function, e.g. CD9 and CD81, contain negatively charged glutamic acids in their third TMH (48Yanez-Mo M. Alfranca A. Cabanas C. Marazuela M. Tejedor R. Ursa M.A. Ashman L.K. de Landazuri M.O. Sanchez-Madrid F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 49Shaw A.R.

A total 30 of the of 68 ribosomal proteins were N-terminal-acetylated, and 24 of these (80%) were NatA substrates, unacetylated in solely the ard1-Δ mutant and having mainly Ac-Ser- termini and a few with Ac-Ala- or Ac-Thr- termini. Only 4 (13%) were NatB substrates, unacetylated in solely thenat3-Δ mutant, and having Ac-Met-Asp- or Ac-Met-Glu- termini. No NatC substrates were uncovered, e.g.unacetylated in solely mak3-Δ mutants, consistent with finding that none of the ribosomal proteins had Ac-Met-Ile-, Ac-Met-Leu-, or Ac-Met-Phe- termini. Interestingly, two new types of the unusual NatD substrates were uncovered, having either Ac-Ser-Asp-Phe- or Ac-Ser-Asp-Ala- termini that were unacetylated in the ard1-Δ mutant, and only partially acetylated in themak3-Δ mutant and, for one case, also only partially in the nat3-Δ mutant. We suggest that the acetylation of NatD substrates requires not only Ard1p and Nat1p, but also auxiliary factors that are acetylated by the Mak3p and Nat3p N-terminal acetyltransferases.

Nα-terminal N-terminal acetyltransferase(s) matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization Cleavage of N-terminal1methionine residues and N-terminal acetylation are the most common modifications, occurring cotranslationally on the vast majority of eukaryotic proteins. Methionine is cleaved from penultimate residues having radii of gyration of 1.29 Å or less, resulting in N-terminal residues of glycine, alanine, serine, cysteine, threonine, proline, and valine (1Sherman F. Stewart J.W. Tsunasawa S. Bioessays. 1985; 3: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 2Moerschell R.P. Hosokawa Y. Tsunasawa S. Sherman F. J. Biol.

Subsequently, N-terminal acetylation occurs on some but not all proteins containing N-terminal residues of methionine, serine, alanine, glycine, or threonine. We are determining the amino acid sequence requirements for N-terminal acetylation and the NATs (N-terminal acetyltransferases) responsible for this modification in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Polevoda et al. (4Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) have investigated Ard1p, Nat3p, and Mak3p, which are related to each other by amino acid sequence, and which are believed to be the catalytic subunits of three different NATs, each acting on different sets of proteins having different N-terminal regions. Certain proteins, which are normally N-terminal acetylated, lack this modification in mutants deleted in one or an other of these NAT genes. Subclasses of proteins with Ser-, Ala-, Gly- or Thr- termini are not acetylated in ard1-Δ mutants (NatA substrates) (4Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar); proteins with Met-Glu- or Met-Asp- termini and subclasses of proteins with Met-Asn- termini are not acetylated innat3-Δ mutants (NatB substrates) (4Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar); and subclasses of proteins with Met-Ile-, Met-Leu-, Met-Trp-, or Met-Phe- termini are not acetylated in mak3-Δ mutants (NatC substrates) (4Polevoda B.

Chem. 2000; (in press)Google Scholar). In addition, a special subclass of substrates with Ser-Glu-Phe-, Ala-Glu-Phe-, or Gly-Glu-Phe- termini are not acetylated in mutants deficient in any of three NATs genes (NatD substrates) (4Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). These results were primarily obtained by examining a mutationally altered forms of iso-1-cytochrome c, abundant wild-type proteins, and proteasomal subunits that were acetylated in normal strains but not in mutants deficient in one or another of the three NATs genes (4Polevoda B.

Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), an expected result because both Nat1p and Ard1p subunits are required for activity of this NAT (5Mullen J.R. Kayne P.S.

In this study, we have taken advantage of the high proportion of ribosomal proteins that are N-terminal-acetylated to expand the data base. The genome sequence revealed that S. cerevisiae apparently contains 78 different genes, which encode 32 different small ribosomal subunits and 46 different large ribosomal subunits (9Mager W.H.

Chem. 1992; 267: 5442-5445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) used two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to analyze the acetylation of 20 ribosomal proteins from a normal strain and a nat1-Δ mutant. The additional charge due to the lack of N-terminal acetylation of 14 ribosomal proteins from the nat1-Δ mutant resulted in the identification of these proteins as substrates for the NAT (12Takakura H. Tsunasawa S. Miyagi M. Warner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5442-5445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) encoded by the NAT1 and ARD1 genes (5Mullen J.R. Kayne P.S. Moerschell R.P.

In this study, we have analyzed the apparent acetylation state of 66 ribosomal proteins from a normal strain and the ard1-Δ, nat3-Δ, and mak3-Δ mutants, using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The masses of molecules smaller than approximately 30 kDa can be measured with an accuracy of approximately 1 Da, allowing the identification of acetylation, methionine cleavage, and other modifications. Furthermore, the rapidity of mass spectrometric procedures has allowed us to conveniently analyze numerous samples. The findings in this study with ribosomal proteins has extended the known kinds of NatA and NatB substrates and, more importantly, revealed new types of NatD substrates, which are dependent on all three NATs, Ard1p, Nat3p, and Mak3p. These results have allowed use to expand our hypothesis explaining the mechanism of acetylation of NatD substrates. The following strains used in this study have been described by Polevoda et al.

Ribosomal proteins were prepared essentially as described by Takakura et al. (12Takakura H. Tsunasawa S. Miyagi M. Warner J. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells were harvested in mid-log phase, washed with TMN buffer (50 mm Tris-Acetate, pH 7.0, 12 mmMgCl2, 50 mm NH4Cl, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and resuspended in small volume of TMN. Cells were disintegrated by vigorous vortexing with glass beads, and the resulting homogenate was centrifuged for 5 min at 5,000 ×g, the glass beads were washed once with fresh TMN buffer, and the supernatants were pooled. The cell extracts were centrifuged three consecutive times at 14,000 × g, the final supernatants layered over a 10% sucrose (w/v) cushion of TMN buffer containing 0.5 m NH4Cl to strip off loosely associated proteins and centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 150 min in SW 55 rotor (Beckman). The supernatants were carefully pipetted off, and the pellet of ribosomes was suspended in 10 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 0.01 mm MgCl2 by stirring. Subsequently 0.10 volume of 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 0.10 volume of 1.0 m MgCl2, and 2 volumes of glacial acetic acid were added. After stirring at 4 °C for 30 min, the RNA was removed by centrifugation three consecutive times at 14,000 ×g for 15 min. The supernatants were dialyzed against 1% acetic acid and, if necessary, concentrated using Centricon-3 filter devices (Amicon). Protein concentrations were determined by BCA reagent (Sigma). Reagents used for mass spectrometry analysis included: trifluoroacetic acid (purchased from EM Science (Gibbstown, NJ)), bovine trypsinogen and bovine carbonic anhydrase (supplied by Sigma), acetonitrile (obtained from Fisher Scientific (Fair Lawn, NJ)), and sinapinic acid (purchased from Aldrich). MALDI samples were prepared by mixing one part ribosome solution with three parts sinapinic acid matrix at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in 2:1 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile and applying 1 μl of this mixture to the sample probe. For some samples, 1% trifluoroacetic acid was added to the ribosome sample before mixing with matrix to enhance the MALDI signal. Samples were allowed to air dry before inserting them into the mass spectrometer. Positive ion mass spectra were recorded on a home-built linear time-of-flight mass spectrometer as described previously (14Colby S. Reilly J. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1419-1428Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar) using 30 keV of total acceleration energy. External mass calibration was performed using a sample containing trypsinogen and carbonic anhydrase in sinapinic acid matrix. After identifying some subunit proteins, their measured flight times and masses calculated from genomic data were used to internally calibrate spectra. Ribosomal proteins from the normal strain and from each of the ard1-Δ, nat3-Δ, and mak3-Δ mutants were subjected to mass spectrometric analysis. Peaks corresponding to ribosomal proteins were observed at masses between 6 and 40 kDa, as shown for the normal strain in Fig. 1. A composite of three separately recorded spectra, in which a total of 14 points were used to calibrate the data, is shown in Fig. 1. The 68 ribosomal proteins listed in Table I were identified by the masses determined from the spectra, the masses deduced from the genomic sequence, and knowledge of previously established modifications. Also listed in Table I is a portion of the results of Takakura et al. (12Takakura H. Tsunasawa S. Miyagi M. Warner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5442-5445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who identified 20 ribosomal proteins by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, including 13 ribosomal proteins that were identified in the present study.Table IAcetylation of yeast ribosomal proteinsProtein nameN-terminal sequenceAffected byard1-Δ or nat1-ΔL33A(M)AESHRaProteins were identified by mass spectrometry; the lack of acetylation was inferred from a diminution in mass of approximate 42 Da.,cProteins were present in both acetylated and unacetylated forms in the normal strain.

Open table in a new tab The masses of the ribosomal proteins have permitted us to deduce that 30 of the 68 ribosomal proteins were acetylated (Table I). Three of the ribosomal proteins, Li6B, L33A, and S1A, appeared to be only partially acetylated (Table I), whereas the remaining 27 were apparently either completely or nearly completely acetylated. Also cleavage of N-terminal methionine residues occurred mainly by the rules first suggested by Sherman et al. (1Sherman F. Stewart J.W. Tsunasawa S. Bioessays. 1985; 3: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and later confirmed (2Moerschell R.P. Hosokawa Y. Tsunasawa S. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19638-19643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Arnold R.J. Reilly J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), except for the S27A, S27B, and L42B ribosomal proteins whose mature forms have Met-Val-Leu- or Met-Val-Asn-terminal regions (Table I). The lack or incomplete cleavage of N-terminal methionine from penultimate residues having intermediate sizes of side chains has been previously noted. Moerschell et al. (2Moerschell R.P. Hosokawa Y. Tsunasawa S. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19638-19643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated antepenultimate (the third residue) proline residues can inhibit methionine cleavage from certain residues with intermediate sizes of side chains. Also, methionine cleavage was completely inhibited from the Met-Val-Pro- sequence of a mutant human hemoglobin (15Prchal J.T. Cashman D.P. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 24-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 16Barwick R.C. Jones R.T. Head C.G. Shih M.F.-C. Prchal J.T. Shih D.T.-B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4602-4605Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In other studies withEscherichia coli, antepenultimate proline residues partially inhibited cleavage from Met-Ala-Pro- (17Yamada T. Kato K. Kawahara K. Nishimura O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 135: 837-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 18Hirel H.-P. Schmitter J.-M. Dessen P. Fayat G. Blanquet S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8247-8251Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar) and Met-Thr-Pro- (19Devlin P.E. Drummond R.J. Toy P. Mark D.F. Watt K.W. Devlin J.J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 65: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Ribosomal proteins also have been reported to be phosphorylated and methylated. The phosphorylation of ribosomal proteins in vivo was reported in yeast, mammals, but not in prokaryotes. Five proteins, S5 and/or S6, S13 (previously denoted S27), P1, and P2 (previously denoted L44 and L45, respectively) and one unidentified protein were found phosphorylated in yeast (20Zinker S. Warner J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1799-1807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of ribosomal proteins labeled in vivorevealed that P1, P2, S5 (previously denoted S2), S6 (previously denoted S10), and L24 (previously denoted L30) were phosphorylated (21Kruiswijk T. De Hey J.T. Planta R.J. Biochem. J. 1978; 175: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), with P1 and P2 being the major phosphorylated proteins (20Zinker S. Warner J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1799-1807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kruiswijk T. De Hey J.T. Planta R.J. Biochem. J. 1978; 175: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). From the subset of ribosomal proteins that were measured by mass spectrometry in this study, P2A and P2B from all strains had masses 95–97 Da higher than expected from the unmodified protein mass, consistent with the presence of a phosphate group and in agreement with the results of Zinker and Warner (20Zinker S. Warner J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1799-1807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Kruiswijk et al. (21Kruiswijk T. De Hey J.T. Planta R.J. Biochem. J. 1978; 175: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We also wish to point out that P2A and P2B proteins, as well as some of the other ribosomal proteins, P0, P1A, P1B, and P5, are acidic proteins that have characteristic phosphorylation sites, mostly in the C-terminal region, which is important for interaction with other components of the ribosome (22Naranda T. Ballesta J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10563-10567Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, except for P2A and P2B, we did not observe increased masses corresponding to phosphorylation of other ribosomal proteins, including S5, S13, and P1A. Modification of ribosomal proteins by methylation has been observed in diverse organisms, from E. coli to higher eukaryotes. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis of yeast ribosomal proteins labeled in vitro with [methyl-3H]methionine and [1-14C]methionine revealed that the following four proteins were methylated: S25 (previously denoted S31), S26 (previously denoted S32), L12 (previously denoted L15), and L42 (previously denoted L41) (23Kruiswijk T. Kunst A. Planta R.J. Mager W.H. Biochem. J. 1978; 175: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our measurements with mass spectrometry revealed that L42B from all strains had an extra 26 Da mass, which corresponds approximately to the shift caused by two methyl groups [-CH3] (28 Da), or a single sodium atom (22 Da). Interestingly, Williamson et al. (11Williamson N.A. Raliegh J. Morrice N.A. Wettenhall R.E.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 786-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) recently reported that the orthologous L42B protein from rat had an extra mass of 22 Da, although the nature of modification was not determined. In addition, our mass spectrometric measurements revealed that P2A had an extra mass of 18 Da, which approximately corresponds to the mass of a single methyl group (14 Da). Furthermore, yeast P2A is orthologous to E. coli L7/L12, which is believed by some but not all investigators to be methylated (23Kruiswijk T. Kunst A. Planta R.J. Mager W.H. Biochem. J. 1978; 175: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In our study, no other ribosomal protein had increased masses compatible with methylation, including L29, which, together with L40, is methylated in rat (11Williamson N.A. Raliegh J. Morrice N.A. Wettenhall R.E.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 786-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, detection of methyl groups and other small modifications on large proteins, such as S25 or L12, is difficult using mass spectrometry, especially in the range of 0.09–0.2 groups per protein molecule, as has been reported previously (23Kruiswijk T. Kunst A. Planta R.J. Mager W.H. Biochem. J. 1978; 175: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The analysis of the ribosomal proteins from the ard1-Δ,nat3-Δ, and mak3-Δ mutants, presented in Table I, revealed that 30 out of the 68 proteins were diminished in mass by approximately 42 Da, which corresponds to the mass of an acetyl group. Examples are shown in FIG. 2, FIG. 3, FIG. 4. S7A (Fig. 2) is considered to be a NatA substrate because of the diminished mass when isolated from theard1-Δ, but not the nat3-Δ ormak3-Δ mutants. Similarly, S21B (Fig. 3) had a diminished mass when isolated from the nat3-Δ, but not from the ard1-Δ ormak3-Δ mutants, a result that defines NatB substrates. In contrast, S20 (Fig. 4) gave results consistent with the view that it was completely unacetylated inard1-Δ and only partially acetylated innat3-Δ and mak3-Δ mutants, therefore revealing a new type of NatD substrates. In summary, the ribosomal proteins could be assigned to NatA, NatB, or NatD groups from the shifts of approximately 42 Da mass, as summarized in Table I. None of ribosomal proteins were NatC substrates, consistent with the lack of Met-Leu-, Met-Ile-, Met-Trp-, and Met-Phe- termini.FIG. 3MALDI mass spectra of ribosomal proteins from the normal and mutants strains, showing the range corresponding to the ribosomal proteins S21A and S21B. S21B has a calculated mass of 9,801 and 9,759 Da, respectively, for the acetylated and unacetylated forms, whereas S21A has a calculated mass of 9,786 and 9,744 Da, respectively, for the acetylated and unacetylated forms. The diminished mass of the ribosomal protein S21B in thenat3-Δ mutant indicates the lack of N-terminal acetylation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)FIG. 2MALDI mass spectra of ribosomal proteins from the normal and mutants strains, showing the range corresponding to the ribosomal protein S7A, which has a calculated mass, lacking the N-terminal methionine residue, of 21,525 and 21,483 Da, respectively, for the acetylated and unacetylated forms.

Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) were more-or-less similar (Table II). The majority, 26 out of 30 of the normally acetylated ribosomal proteins, were NatA substrates, with most having Ac-Ser- termini and only a few having Ac-Thr- or Ac-Ala- termini. Only four were NatB substrates, having Ac-Met-Glu- or Ac-Met-Asp- termini. No NatC substrates were uncovered in this study of ribosomal proteins or in the previous study of abundant proteins (4Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar).

Similarly, the S20 and S24A, having Ac-Ser-Asp-Phe- and Ac-Ser-Asp-Ala- termini, respectively, were not acetylated in theard1-Δ mutant, but were partially acetylated in themak3-Δ mutant. Also, S20 was only partially acetylated innat3-Δ (Table III). One possible interpretation of the NatD substrates is that they are a subclass of NatA substrates requiring, in addition to Ard1p and Nat1p, other factors whose full active form requires acetylation by Mak3p and in some cases Nat3p. These hypothetical auxiliary factors may increase the efficiency of action of the Ard1p/Nat1p N-terminal acetyltransferase on the NatD substrates. The lack of acetylation of the auxiliary factors may result in no or only partial acetylation, depending on the particular NatD substrate, as summarized in Table III. An alignment of the N-terminal region of NatD substrates and related sequences reveals an obvious requirement, but not sufficiency, for acidic residues, Glu or Asp, at the antepenultimate position (Table III).Table IIIThe acetylation of NatD and related proteinsGeneSequenceApproximate percent acetylationTypeRef.Normalard1 or nat1mak3nat3CYC1–987Ac-Ser-Glu-Phe-Leu-Ala-100%0%0%0%NatD4Polevoda B.

Even with the expanded the data base, N-terminal acetylation can not be readily predicted from N-terminal sequences alone. As first emphasized by Moerschell et al. (2Moerschell R.P. Hosokawa Y. Tsunasawa S. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19638-19643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Met-Glu- and Met-Asp- termini of eukaryotic proteins are usually acetylated, although certain other residues in the N-terminal region can reduce or possibly prevent acetylation. On the other hand, NatA and NatC are difficult to predict, and acetylation depends on more than just the N-terminal residue (Table II). As recently stressed by Polevoda et al. (4Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), the lack of acetylation could be due to the absence of required residues in degenerate motifs or to the presence of inhibitory residues. Certainly, the conclusion of Huanget al. (24Huang S. Elliott R.C. Liu P.S. Koduri R.K. Weickmann J.L. Lee J.H. Blair L.C. Gosh-Dastidar P. Bradshaw R.A. Bryan K.M. Einarson B. Kendall R.L.

Further analysis of even a larger number of acetylated and unacetylated proteins may refine the rules for predicting N-terminal acetylation. We thank G.

In this study, we studied the possible involvement of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and PI 3-kinase signaling pathways in mediating IGF-I-regulated IGFBP-5 gene expression. The addition of Des(1–3)IGF-I, an IGF analog with reduced affinity to IGFBPs, resulted in a transient activation of p44 and p42 MAPK. Inhibition of the MAPK activation by PD98059, however, did not affect IGF-I-stimulated IGFBP-5 expression. Des(1–3)IGF-I treatment also strongly activated PI 3-kinase. This activation was probably mediated through IRS-1, because IGF-I stimulation resulted in a significant increase in IRS-1- but not IRS-2-associated PI 3-kinase activity. This activation occurred within 5 min and was sustained at high levels for over 6 h. Likewise, Des(1–3)IGF-I caused a long lasting activation of PKB/Akt and p70s6k. When LY294002 and wortmannin, two specific inhibitors of PI 3-kinase, were added with Des(1–3)IGF-I, the IGF-I-regulated IGFBP-5 expression was negated. The addition of rapamycin, which inhibits IGF-I-induced p70s6k activation, significantly inhibited IGF-I-regulated IGFBP-5 gene expression. These results suggest that the action of IGF-I on IGFBP-5 gene expression requires the activation of the PI 3-kinase-PKB/Akt-p70s6k pathway but not the MAPK pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells.

Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9947) Google Scholar). These cellular events are regulated by a number of peptide growth factors including insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). Studies have shown that IGF-I is a mitogen and strong chemoattractant for cultured VSMCs (2Bornfeldt K.E. Raines E.W. Nakano T. Graves L.M. Krebs E.G. Ross R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1266-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 3Imai Y. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4228-4235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocr.

The growth and migration-promoting actions of IGF-I are mediated through the IGF-IR, a tyrosine kinase receptor that is linked to the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) signaling pathways (3Imai Y. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4228-4235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The bioactivity of IGF-I is further modulated by several high affinity binding proteins (IGFBPs) present in the local vasculature. These IGFBPs control the distribution of IGF-I between extracellular environment and cell surface binding sites and can alter IGF bioactivity by modulating its interaction with the receptor (4Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that VSMCs secrete several IGFBPs, including IGFBP-5 (5Giannella-Neto D. Kamyar A. Sharifi B.

The increased IGFBP-5 protein, in turn, modulates the IGF-I action by a feedback mechanism in these cells (12Duan C. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16836-16842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The regulatory effect of IGF-I on IGFBP-5 gene expression in VSMCs is mediated through the IGF-IR (11Duan C. Hawes S.B. Prevette T. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4280-4288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, how the activation of the IGF-IR leads to the elevation of IGFBP-5 gene expression is not well understood. In this study, we investigated the effect of IGF-I on MAPK and PI 3-kinase activation and the role of these signaling pathways in mediating IGF-I-stimulated IGFBP-5 gene expression in cultured VSMCs. IGF-I exposure resulted in the activation of both MAPK and PI 3-kinase signaling cascades in these cells. When the activation of PI 3-kinase or p70s6k was suppressed using specific inhibitors, the IGF-I-regulated IGFBP-5 gene expression was negated. The addition of PD98059, which inhibits IGF-I-induced MAPK activation, had no such effect. These results suggest that the action of IGF-I on IGFBP-5 gene expression requires the activation of the PI 3-kinase-PKB/Akt-p70s6k pathway but not the MAPK pathway in VSMCs. All chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma unless noted otherwise. PI 3-kinase and 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The IRS-1 and IRS-2 antibodies were a gift from Dr. Ildiko Szantos-Denes (Harvard Medical School, Boston). Phosphospecific (activated) and control antibodies for MAPK, PKB/Akt, and p70s6k as well as mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1 inhibitor PD98059 were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit antibody, rainbow molecular weight markers, [32P]ATP, and [32P]dCTP were from NEN Life Science Products. Human IGF-I and Des(1–3)IGF-I were obtained from GroPep (Adelaide, Australia). LY294002 was purchased from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Fetal bovine serum, Dulbecco's minimum essential medium with high glucose, and penicillin-streptomycin were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Trypsin was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Porcine VSMCs were isolated from thoracic aorta of newborn piglets (11Duan C. Hawes S.B. Prevette T. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4280-4288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in 10-cm dishes (Falcon, Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ) in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium supplemented with 4 mm glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% fetal bovine serum. The medium was changed every fourth day until the cells became confluent. Prior to stimulation experiments, medium was changed to serum-free Dulbecco's minimum essential medium for 18–24 h. This serum-free Dulbecco's minimum essential medium was then replaced with serum-free Dulbecco's minimum essential medium plus indicated growth factors for various times. For Western immunoblotting analysis, cells were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Equal amounts of lysates were separated by 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon P membrane (0.45-μm pore size, Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin (Fisher) in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 (TBST). For anti-PKB/Akt and p70s6k blotting, membranes were incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of the primary antibodies in TBST-bovine serum albumin buffer and then washed three times with TBST. All other blots were incubated with a 1:5000 dilution of the indicated antibody in blocking buffer for 2 h at room temperature. Blots were then washed with TBST and incubated with a 1:3000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit or 1:8000 dilution anti-mouse secondary antibodies in blocking buffer for 2–3 h, followed by further washing. Enhanced chemiluminescence was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Densitometry was performed by scanning the autoradiographs (ScanJet IIcx; Hewlett-Packard) and then analyzed using Scion Image software (Frederick, MD). After growth factor treatment, cell cultures were washed, lysed (1% IGEPAL, 137 mm NaCl, I mm MgCl2, 150 μm vanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin), and incubated with primary antibody overnight followed by further incubation with protein A-Sepharose for 2 h. After three washes, the PI 3-kinase assay was performed as described previously (13Yano K. Bauchat J.R. Liimatta M.B. Clemmons D.R. Duan C. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4622-4632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were resuspended in 30 μl of PI 3-kinase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EGTA), and 20 μg of phosphatidylinositol were added. After 5 min at room temperature, 10 μCi of [32P]ATP was added. After 10 min at room temperature, the reaction was stopped with 80 μl of 1 mHCl, and lipids were extracted with 160 μl of MeOH/chloroform (1:1). Samples were spotted on 1% potassium oxalate-treated TLC plates (Analtech, Newark, DE) and developed in CHCl3/MeOH/H2O/NH4OH (64:47:11.3:2). The highest migrating spots on the TLC plate, representing phosphatidylinositol phosphate, were quantitated as described above. Total RNA was isolated from cell cultures using TriReagent following the manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) and was quantified by measuring UV absorption at OD 260 nm. RNA samples were size-fractionated on a 1% agarose gel, blotted, and fixed onto a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). They were hybridized with [32P]dCTP-labeled porcine IGFBP-5 cDNAs (14Duan C. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24844-24851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). cDNA probes for rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and bovine IGFBP-2 were used to determine that the same amounts of RNA were loaded. Densitometry was performed as described above. Values are means ± S.E. Differences among groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Fisher's protected least significance difference test using Statview (Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkeley, CA). To determine the signaling mechanism(s) that IGF-I utilizes to regulate IGFBP-5 gene expression, the effect of IGF-I on MAPK activation was investigated using a phosphospecific MAPK antibody that only detects the doubly phosphorylated (at Thr202 and Tyr204 residues) ERK1 and ERK2. Activation of MAPK occurs through phosphorylation of Thr202 and Tyr204 by mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (15Sturgill T.W. Ray L.B. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Nature. 1988; 334: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Since it is known that IGFBP-5 can modulate IGF-I activities in VSMCs (12Duan C. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16836-16842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), Des(1–3)IGF-I, an IGF-I analog that binds to IGF-IR with normal affinity but has significantly reduced affinity for IGFBPs (16Francis G.L. Rossm M. Ballard F.J. Milner S.J. Senn C. McNeil K.A. Wallace J.C. King R. Wells J.R.E. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 8: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), was used to activate the IGF-IR. In cultured porcine VSMCs, Des(1–3)IGF-I induced a concentration- and time-dependent increase in the phosphorylation/activation of ERK1 and ERK2 (Fig. 1). ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation was observed at 5 min, and the maximum phosphorylation occurred within 10 min (Fig. 1 A). This effect disappeared rapidly thereafter and returned to the basal levels within 30 min. The minimum effective concentration of Des(1–3)IGF-I was 5 ng/ml. This is followed by a concentration-dependent increase, with the maximum phosphorylation response seen at approximately 20 ng/ml of Des(1–3)IGF-I (Fig. 1 B). PD98059, which noncompetitively blocks the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase by Raf-1 without affecting other known serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases (17Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3248) Google Scholar), was used to block the activation of MAPK by Des(1–3)IGF-I. Pretreatment with PD98059 at 20 μm for 2 h inhibited the Des(1–3)IGF-I-stimulated ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation by approximately 90% (Fig. 2 A). This inhibition was specific, because LY294002, wortmannin, and rapamycin had no such effect. Inhibition of MAPK activation by PD98059 at the concentrations of 20–40 μm had little effect in changing IGF-I-stimulated IGFBP-5 gene expression (Fig. 2, B andC). PD98059 at the same concentrations, however, significantly inhibited IGF-I-induced VSMC migration (data not shown). These results indicate that MAPK activation is not required for IGF-I-induced IGFBP-5 gene expression in porcine VSMCs.FIG. 2Inhibition of Des(1–3)IGF-I-stimulated MAPK activation does not affect IGF-I-stimulated IGFBP-5 gene expression in cultured VSMCs. A, serum-starved cells were pretreated with LY294002 (10 μm), wortmannin (20 μm), rapamycin (20 ng/ml), or PD98059 (20 μm), for 2 h prior to 10 min of Des(1–3)IGF-I (20 ng/ml) stimulation. Cell lysates were prepared from these cells, and Western blotting was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, confluent cells were treated with or without Des(1–3)IGF-I (100 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of PD98059 (40 μm). Total RNA samples isolated from the cell were size-fractionated on a 1.0% agarose gel. The samples were blotted and fixed onto a Hybond-N membrane and hybridized with [32P]dCTP-labeled IGFBP cDNAs as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Ethidium bromide staining of the gel is shown in the bottom panel. C, densitometry analysis results of B. Values are the means of four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Since activation of the MAPK signaling cascade is not required for IGF-I-dependent IGFBP-5 expression, we next tested whether this action of IGF-I is mediated through the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway. For this, the effect of Des(1–3)IGF-I in activating PI 3-kinase was first examined. Serum-starved or Des(1–3)IGF-I-treated cells were immunoprecipitated using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10), and the PI 3-kinase activity was analyzed by an in vitro kinase assay. As shown in Fig. 3, Des(1–3)IGF-I treatment resulted in a significant increase in the phosphotyrosine-associated PI 3-kinase activity. Binding and phosphorylation of a member of the IRS proteins is an early and essential step for the signal transduction initiated by the IGF-IR (18LeRoith D. Werner H. Beitner-Johnson D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 143-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar, 19White M.F. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1998; 182: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). IRS proteins then serve as a multiple docking protein by binding to numerous Src homology 2 domain-containing proteins, including the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase. To determine whether IRS-1, IRS-2, or both are involved in IGF-I signaling in VSMCs, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with either an anti-IRS-1 or anti-IRS-2 antibody, and the associated PI 3-kinase activity was determined. Des(1–3)IGF-I resulted in a significant increase of IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity (Fig. 3). In contrast, there was no change in the IRS-2-associated PI 3-kinase activity after Des(1–3)IGF-I stimulation. These results suggest that IGF-I primarily utilizes IRS-1 to activate PI 3-kinase and its downstream signaling molecules in porcine VSMCs. The Des(1–3)IGF-I-induced increase in IRS-I-associated PI 3-kinase activity was dose-dependent at concentrations ranging from 1 to 50 ng/ml (Fig. 4 B). At the maximum concentration (50 ng/ml), Des(1–3)IGF-I induced an over 100-fold increase. This activation occurred within 5 min of Des(1–3)IGF-I stimulation and was sustained at high levels for 6 h (Fig. 4 A). The activity began to decline after 6 h but remained significantly higher than the basal level even after 24 h. To further examine the effect of Des(1–3)IGF-I in activating the PI 3-kinase signaling cascade, the phosphorylation of PKB/Akt, a downstream target of PI 3-kinase, was examined using a phosphospecific and control PKB/Akt antibody. Consistent with the PI 3-kinase assay results, the Des(1–3)IGF-I-induced PKB/Akt phosphorylation was observed within 5 min and lasted for several hours (Fig. 5 A). Des(1–3)IGF-I induced the phosphorylation of PKB/Akt in a concentration-dependent manner in concentrations ranging from 1 to 20 ng/ml (Fig. 5 B). The maximum phosphorylation response was seen at 20 ng/ml Des(1–3)IGF-I.FIG. 4Des(1–3)IGF-I stimulation leads to a strong and sustained increase in the IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity in cultured VSMCs.

The effectiveness of these inhibitors was examined by directly monitoring the Des(1–3)IGF-I-induced changes in PI 3-kinase activity as well as the phosphorylation state of PKB/Akt. As shown in Fig. 6 A, pretreatment of porcine VSMCs with wortmannin (20 μm) completely abolished the Des(1–3)IGF-I-induced PI 3-kinase activation. LY294002 (10 μm) also significantly inhibited the activation. PD98059 (40 μm) had no such inhibitory effect (Fig. 6 A). Likewise, both wortmannin and LY294002 but not PD98059 or rapamycin blocked the IGF-I-stimulated PKB/Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 6 B). When co-incubated with Des(1–3)IGF-I (100 ng/ml), LY294002 (10 μm) completely inhibited the Des(1–3)IGF-I-stimulated IGFBP-5 gene expression (Fig. 7). Similarly, wortmannin at the concentration of 20 μm blocked the effect of Des(1–3)IGF-I in up-regulating IGFBP-5 gene expression (Fig. 7). These results indicate that PI 3-kinase activation is required for IGF-I-induced IGFBP-5 gene expression in porcine VSMCs.FIG. 7Inhibition of PI 3-kinase activation abolishes Des(1–3)IGF-I-stimulated IGFBP-5 gene expression in cultured VSMCs.

Activation of p70s6knecessitates its phosphorylation at Ser411, Thr421, and Ser424 residues, which lie within the pseudosubstrate region (20Cheatham L. Monfar M. Chou M.M. Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1995; 92: 11696-11700Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 21Weng Q.P. Andrabi K. Klippel A. Koziowski W.T. Williams L.T. Avruch J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5744-5748Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of these residues is thought to lead to activation of p70s6k via relief of pseudosubstrate repression. The possible effect of IGF-I in activating p70s6k in cultured porcine VSMCs was examined by Western immunoblot analysis using antibodies specific for Ser411 as well as Thr421/Ser424-phosphorylated p70s6k, respectively. As shown in Fig. 8, Des(1–3)IGF-I stimulation resulted in a concentration- and time-dependent increase in the phosphorylation of p70s6k at Ser411 and Thr421/Ser424 residues. Phosphorylation of p70s6k was observed at 5 min after IGF-I treatment. The maximum phosphorylation occurred at 10–30 min (Fig. 8 A), and this high level was sustained for 6 h. The phosphorylation levels gradually decreased thereafter. As shown in Fig. 8 B, Des(1–3)IGF-I was effective at concentrations as low as 1 ng/ml. This was followed by a concentration-dependent increase with the maximum phosphorylation response seen at a concentration of 10–20 ng/ml. To determine whether p70s6k is required for IGF-I action in porcine VSMCs, the immunosuppressant rapamycin was used to inhibit p70s6k activation. p70s6k phosphorylation induced by Des(1–3)IGF-I (20 ng/ml) was effectively inhibited by 20 ng/ml rapamycin as well as LY294002 and wortmannin (20 μm) (Fig. 9). In contrast, PD98059 (40 μm) had no such effect. Preincubation of cells with rapamycin (20 ng/ml) inhibited the effect of Des(1–3)IGF-I on IGFBP-5 expression (Fig. 10). These experiments were repeated three times, and an average of 46 ± 11% inhibition was obtained (p < 0.05). These results indicate that p70s6k is involved in IGF-I-regulated IGFBP-5 gene expression in VSMCs. To ascertain that the change was not due to any toxic effect of these compounds used, we examined the effects of these compounds on the forskolin-induced IGFBP-5 gene expression. Our previous study indicated that forskolin treatment increases IGFBP-5 gene expression through a cAMP-mediated mechanism (14Duan C. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24844-24851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 10 C, forskolin (10 μm) treatment resulted in a 12-fold increase in IGFBP-5 mRNA abundance. This effect was additive with IGF-I, suggesting that they act through different mechanisms. When LY294002 (20 μm), rapamycin (20 ng/ml), or PD98059 (40 μm) was added with forskolin, it did not affect the forskolin induction of IGFBP-5 gene expression (Fig. 10 C).FIG. 10Blockage of p70s6k activation inhibited Des(1–3)IGF-I-stimulated IGFBP-5 gene expression in cultured VSMCs.

Total RNA was isolated and subjected to Northern blot analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It has been shown that IGF-I stimulates the expression of IGFBP-5 in VSMCs, and this up-regulation of IGFBP-5 by its own ligand is mediated through the IGF-IR (11Duan C. Hawes S.B. Prevette T. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4280-4288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). How the activation of the IGF-IR leads to the elevation of IGFBP-5 gene expression is poorly defined. In this study, we present evidence that IGF-I stimulation caused a strong and sustained activation of the PI 3-kinase and its downstream signaling molecules, PKB/Akt and p70s6k, in primary porcine VSMCs. We found that inhibition of PI 3-kinase activation by LY294002 or wortmannin abolished the IGF-I-stimulated IGFBP-5 gene expression. Likewise, inhibition of p70s6k also inhibited the IGF-I-stimulated IGFBP-5 gene expression. These results suggest that the action of IGF-I on IGFBP-5 gene expression requires the activation of the PI-3-kinase-PKB/Akt and p70s6k pathway in cultured porcine VSMCs. Studies using “model” systems (i.e. various tumor or transformed cell lines) have revealed that a complex network of signaling events are activated upon ligand occupancy of the IGF-IR (18LeRoith D. Werner H. Beitner-Johnson D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 143-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar). Two homologous adapter proteins, IRS-1 and IRS-2, have been identified as major substrates of the activated IGF-IR (19White M.F. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1998; 182: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that IGF-I stimulation resulted in a significant increase in IRS-1- but not IRS-2-associated PI 3-kinase activity. These results strongly suggest (but do not definitively prove) that IGF-I activates the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway primarily through IRS-1. IRS-1 has over 20 potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites, which serve as docking sites for numerous Src homology 2 domain-containing proteins, including the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase (19White M.F. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1998; 182: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Like other cell types, activation of IRS-1 in cultured porcine VSMCs results in the activation of the PI 3-kinase pathways. In these primary cells, Des(1–3)IGF-I is a potent activator of PI 3-kinase. This activation is strong and sustained for more than 6 h. In this study, we have used two potent and specific inhibitors of PI 3-kinase, LY294002 and wortmannin, to determine the possible involvement of PI 3-kinase in mediating the effect of IGF-I in regulating IGFBP-5 gene expression.

To decipher the molecular basis for such prolonged poisoning, intoxication in adreno-chromaffin cells was monitored over 2 months. Exocytosis from BoNT/B-treated cells resumed after 56 days because of the appearance of intact synaptobrevin. However, inhibition continued in BoNT/A-treated cells, throughout the same interval, with a continued predominance of cleaved SNAP-25-(1–197) over the intact protein. When recovery from poisoning was attempted by transfection of the latter cells with the gene encoding full-length SNAP-25-(1–206), no restoration of exocytosis ensued even after 3 weeks. To ascertain if this failure was because of the persistence of the toxin's protease activity, the cells were transfected with BoNT/A-resistant SNAP-25 constructs; importantly, exocytosis was rescued. C-terminal truncation of the toxin-insensitive SNAP-25 revealed that residues 1–201, 1–202, 1–203 afforded a significant return of exocytosis, unlike shorter forms 1–197, −198, −199, or −200; accordingly, mutants M202A or L203A of full-length SNAP-25 rescued secretion.

Seven serotypes of BoNTs (A to G) are produced by Clostridium botulinum, whereas only a single form of tetanus toxin (TeTX) is synthesized by Clostridium tetani; the latter blocks transmitter release at central inhibitory nerve terminals (4Pellizzari R. Rossetto O. Schiavo G. Montecucco C. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1999; 354: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). These homologous, but immunologically distinct, proteins share many properties; each active neurotoxin consists of a heavy chain and a light chain (LC) linked by a disulfide bond and non-covalent interactions. The heavy chain is required for high affinity binding to specific neuronal ecto-acceptors, subsequent internalization, and translocation of the LC into the cytosol, where the latter blocks synaptic vesicle exocytosis (reviewed in Ref. 4Pellizzari R. Rossetto O. Schiavo G. Montecucco C. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1999; 354: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The LCs of BoNTs and TeTX are Zn2+-dependent endoproteinases that exhibit remarkable substrate selectivities, targeting single bonds (except for BoNT/C, see below) in one of three SNARE (soluble N -ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) proteins proposed to constitute the core components of the vesicle docking/fusion complex that mediates the regulated exocytosis of neurotransmitters (5Söllner T.

Synaptosomal-associated protein with a molecular mass of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) is proteolyzed by BoNT/A, /C, and /E at separate sites near the C terminus: Gln197-Arg198, Arg198-Ala199, and Arg180-Ile181 (6Schiavo G.

Syntaxin 1A/B is also cleaved by BoNT/C and synaptobrevin (Sbr) by BoNT/B, /D, /F, /G, and TeTX (reviewed in Ref. 4Pellizzari R. Rossetto O. Schiavo G. Montecucco C. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1999; 354: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Unlike syntaxin 1A/B and Sbr, which each possess a transmembrane anchor (9Niemann H. Blasi J. Jahn R. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), SNAP-25 is attached to the membrane through thioester-linked palmitate modifications of one or more of its four centrally located cysteines (10Lane S.R. Liu Y.C. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1864-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). BoNT/A- or /E-truncated SNAP-25 remain membrane-bound, but release is inhibited because of the destabilization of the ternary complex even though assembly and disassembly can still occur (11Hayashi T. McMahon H.J. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 12Pellegrini L.L. O'Connor V. Lottspeich F. Betz H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4705-4713Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The precise basis of their blockade of neuroexocytosis has yet to be elucidated. While the mechanism of BoNT-induced inhibition has received much attention, the molecular processes involved in recovery of the NMJ from poisoning, which can take up to 4 months depending on the serotype used, remains poorly understood. In humans, the extent of recovery from the neuromuscular paralysis caused by BoNT/A or /B was found to be ∼6 and ∼66%, respectively, at 49 days post-injection (2Sloop R.R. Cole B.A. Escutin R.O. Neurology. 1997; 49: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Recently, the sequence of events involved in the protracted resumption of neurotransmission in BoNT/A poisoned motor endplates has been revealed by monitoring synaptic function in individual, identified nerve endings of living animals (13de Paiva A. Meunier F.A. Molgo J. Aoki K.R. Dolly J.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3200-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). This showed that the transient appearance of functional nerve sprouts mediates a partial return of neuromuscular function, with full recovery relying on the originally poisoned nerve terminals reacquiring synaptic activity. However, it is still unclear how the lifetime of the SNAREs and/or persistence of toxin activity influences the time course of the recovery. To gain insights into the molecular basis of the extended but varied recovery periods, this process was studied in adreno-chromaffin cells. Evoked exocytosis from the latter shares many characteristics with synaptic vesicle-mediated neurotransmitter release from neurons; in particular, SNAP-25, Sbr, and syntaxin 1A/B are present and have all been shown to be required for release of their large dense core vesicles (LDCVs) (14Lawrence G.W. Foran P. Dolly J.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 15Foran P. Lawrence G.W. Shone C.C. Foster K.A. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2630-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) because cleavage of these targets by BoNT/A, /B, or /C blocks exocytosis. Previous studies performed on chromaffin cells suggested that persistence of BoNT/A or TeTX activity was responsible for prolonged inhibition of catecholamine release (16Bartels F. Bergel H. Bigalke H. Frevert J. Halpern J. Middlebrook J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8122-8127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it was pertinent to compare the time course of recovery of exocytosis in chromaffin cells to the different durations of paralysis of NMJ in humans poisoned with BoNT/A and B (2Sloop R.R. Cole B.A. Escutin R.O. Neurology. 1997; 49: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The changing amounts of the respective BoNT-truncated and full-length SNARE could be quantified throughout the periods of intoxication in these cells, a feat that cannot be easily achieved at the NMJ. Further, this cell model allowed rescue of BoNT/A poisoning to be attempted through the introduction of vectors encoding various forms of SNAP-25. Failure to recover exocytosis in this way with the wild-type molecule, up to 3 weeks post-intoxication, suggested continued activity of the toxin. This was shown conclusively by the successful rescue with SNAP-25 mutants that were engineered to be highly resistant to proteolysis. This important achievement facilitated experimentation which established that substituting residues in SNAP-25 at positions 197, 198, 202, or 203 does not affect its role in regulated secretion, whereas truncating SNAP-25 past residue 201 inhibits the process. Highly purified BoNT/A was isolated as described previously (17Shone C.C. Tranter H.S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 195: 143-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). BoNT/B and /E were supplied by Drs. C. C. Shone (Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research, UK) and B. DasGupta (Madison, WI) and activated prior to use (18Lawrence G.W. Foran P. Mohammed N. DasGupta B.R. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3061-3067Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Antiserum specific for SNAP-25-(1–197) was a gift from Drs. T. A. N. Ekong and D. Sesardic (National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, UK). Mouse cDNA encoding SNAP-25b and its BoNT/A-truncated version were provided by Dr. L. Zhou of this laboratory. Urografin (Schering Healthcare, Germany), radioimmunoassay (RIA) kit (Nichols Institute, CA, USA), Quick-ChangeTM (Stratagene), calcium phosphate reagents (Life Technologies, Inc., UK), SuperfectTM(QIAGEN, Inc.), pGEX-2T and enhanced chemiluminesence (ECL) reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK), and pcDNA1.1/Amp (Invitrogen) were purchased. Chromaffin cells were prepared from bovine adrenal glands and maintained as primary cultures, as described previously (14Lawrence G.W. Foran P. Dolly J.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cells required for transfection were further enriched using urografin density-gradient centrifugation (19Wilson S.P. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1987; 19: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Within 2–3 days after preparation, the cells were incubated with a low ionic strength medium (LISM) at 37 °C for 24 h in the absence or presence of 6.6 nm BoNT/A or 66 nm BoNT/B; after washing, they were maintained at 37 °C (14Lawrence G.W. Foran P. Dolly J.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). At various intervals after treatment with or without BoNT/A or /B, the cells were washed briefly with Locke's solution (19Wilson S.P. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1987; 19: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and incubated in quadruplicate at 22 °C with this buffer in the absence or presence of 2 mm Ba2+. After 15 min, aliquots of the medium bathing the cells were removed and assayed for catecholamine content using a fluorometric procedure (14Lawrence G.W. Foran P. Dolly J.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Values for basal release of catecholamine were subtracted from the amounts recorded in the presence of Ba2+ to determine the evoked components, which were expressed as a percentage of the total catecholamine content within the cells. The mouse SNAP-25b gene was ligated into either pGEX-2T or pcDNA1.1/Amp, using the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites. Site-specific point mutations or stop codons were introduced into these constructs, using Pfu-DNA polymerase either by conventional polymerase chain reaction strategies or using the Quick-Change site-directed mutagenesis methodology. When required, unidirectional ligations were performed using the BamHI andEcoRI restriction sites. These mutations or deletions in the SNAP-25 gene were verified by sequencing. Full-length variants of glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-SNAP-25 were expressed inEscherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography (20Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5046) Google Scholar). Each of the recombinant proteins was coated onto 96-well plates, rinsed, blocked with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and exposed to various concentrations of DTT-reduced BoNT/A at 37 °C for 4 h. The wells were then aspirated, washed, and probed with anti-SNAP-25(C terminus)-IgG (generated against the last 12 residues of SNAP-25) (14Lawrence G.W. Foran P. Dolly J.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Unbound IgG was removed by rapid washing, and the bound IgGs were detected indirectly using anti-species-specific IgGs-conjugated to alkaline phosphatase; appearance of the colored product was quantified upon addition of p-nitrophenyl phosphate. TheA 405 nm values recorded from toxin-treated wells were expressed as percentages of those for toxin-free control and plotted against the toxin concentration used. Standard curves relating amounts of intact SNAP-25 remaining in wells were made, using defined mixtures of full-length and BoNT/A-truncated GST-SNAP-25. TheA 405 nm readings observed were expressed as percentages of that recorded for the 100% intact protein sample and plotted against the amounts of intact GST-SNAP-25 coated. This was used to extrapolate the actual amount of intact SNAP-25 remaining in each well; generally, ∼70% of the maximal A 405 nm signal represented 50% intact SNAP-25 in wells. CHO cells, which lack SNAP-25, were transfected with pcDNA1.1/Amp-SNAP-25s using SuperfectTM and 24 h later were incubated in LISM with and without 6.6 nmBoNT/A, as described for chromaffin cells. Membranes were isolated, subjected to immunoblotting with the following IgGs (14Lawrence G.W. Foran P. Dolly J.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 15Foran P. Lawrence G.W. Shone C.C. Foster K.A. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2630-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar); anti-SNAP-25(full-length)-IgG (an antibody raised against recombinant GST-SNAP-25), anti-SNAP-25A (an antiserum solely reactive with SNAP-251–197), anti-SNAP-25(C terminus)-IgG and anti-Sbr/Cbr-IgG (raised against residues 33–94 of human Sbr-2). Bound antibodies were detected indirectly using anti-species-specific IgGs conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and visualized by the ECL detection system. At the indicated times after incubation in LISM with or without 6.6 nm BoNT/A, the cells were transfected with the hGH construct together with pcDNA1.1/Amp-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), as a control, or the appropriate SNAP-25 gene (wild-type or mutants) using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (21Holz R.W. Senter R.A. Uhler M.D. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Four to six days after transfection, hGH secretion from intact chromaffin cells was stimulated (as described for catecholamine release) and quantified using a RIA. In some experiments, transfected cells were permeabilized with 20 μm digitonin in a permeabilization buffer (18Lawrence G.W. Foran P. Mohammed N. DasGupta B.R. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3061-3067Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and exposed for 15 min to reduced BoNT/E. Release over the subsequent 15 min was evoked by the addition of 20 μm free Ca2+ and was then assessed. Aliquots were removed and assayed for hGH content; Ca2+-evoked hGH secretion was calculated as outlined above for Ba2+-evoked hGH release. To investigate the important question of how BoNTs exert their inhibitory actions for prolonged periods, neuroendocrine chromaffin cells were treated for 24 h with BoNT/A (6.6 nm) or B (66 nm), using a LISM to overcome the absence of high affinity acceptors (14Lawrence G.W. Foran P. Dolly J.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Evoked secretion and cell complement of SNAREs were assessed at 5, 19, 40, and 56 days post-intoxication (Fig. 1). Ba2+ was employed instead of other commonly used stimuli (e.g. 55 mm K+ or nicotine which induce Ca2+ entry) because it evokes much more catecholamine release (up to 50% of the total cell complement compared with only ∼20% by the latter stimuli) while still exhibiting the same requirements for SNAP-25 and Sbr/Cbr (14Lawrence G.W. Foran P. Dolly J.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). After 5 days, cells that had been treated with BoNT/A or /B showed extensive inhibition of Ba2+-evoked catecholamine release of 84 ± 0.7 and 90 ± 0.4% (means ± S.E.; n = 4), respectively, relative to that for toxin-free controls (Fig. 1). Full-length SNAP-25 was monitored using anti-SNAP-25(C terminus)-IgG, whereas intact Sbr and cellubrevin (Cbr; a BoNT-sensitive homologue (22McMahon H.T. Ushkaryov Y.A. Edelmann L. Link E. Binz T.

Nature. 1993; 364: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar)) were quantified using anti-Sbr/Cbr-IgG; both of these antibodies exhibit no reactivity toward the membrane-retained portion of their antigens upon proteolytic cleavage by BoNT/A or /B. The presence of BoNT/A-truncated SNAP-25 in the membrane was monitored using IgG specific for SNAP-25A; the latter does not recognize intact SNAP-25 but reacts strongly with the product of BoNT/A (18Lawrence G.W. Foran P. Mohammed N. DasGupta B.R. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3061-3067Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 23Ekong T.A.N. Feavers I.M. Sesardic D. Microbiology ( UK ). 1997; 143: 3337-3347Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Western blotting of the requisite membrane fraction of the cells showed that the BoNT-mediated inhibition of secretion noted at day 5 was accompanied by total or near-complete disappearance of intact SNAP-25 or Sbr/Cbr (Fig. 1), with the BoNT/A-truncated SNAP-25 being readily detected at this time (Fig. 1 A). At day 40 post-intoxication, only a trace of SNAP-25 C terminus immunoreactivity was observed in BoNT/A-poisoned cells relative to the amount in toxin-free control cells; accordingly, the level of evoked secretion was not significantly greater than that recorded on day 5 (Fig. 1 A). However, at day 56 post-intoxication, slightly larger amounts of intact SNAP-25 were noted in the poisoned cells, enough to cause a statistically significant level of recovery of exocytosis (from 16 to 34% of control). Throughout this time course, SNAP-25A persisted in the intoxicated cells (Fig. 1 A). Difficulties inherent to primary cell cultures precluded studies longer than 8 weeks post-intoxication, periods that would appear to be necessary to attain complete recovery from BoNT/A poisoning. In contrast, a much faster recovery from blockade by BoNT/B was observed. The high level of inhibition of evoked secretion in BoNT/B-poisoned cells, noted on day 5, of 90 ± 0.4% gradually subsided until only 10 ± 3.4% inhibition (means ± S.E.;n = 4) remained at day 56. This resumption of regulated exocytosis was coincident with reappearance of intact Sbr/Cbr to a level comparable with that observed in toxin-free cells (Fig. 1 B). Based on the above noted findings, it was hypothesized that expression of an excess of the full-length SNAP-25 in BoNT/A-poisoned cells might restore regulated exocytosis by competing with the SNAP-25Apresent. As a prerequisite to testing this possibility, expression of SNAP-25 in mammalian cells had to be demonstrated; this could be most readily achieved by transfecting pcDNA1.1/ Amp-SNAP-25 into CHO cells that lack endogenous SNAP-25. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting of a Triton X-100 solubilized extract of the cells showed that SNAP-25 was expressed and exhibited the same M r as the native species present in chromaffin cells (Fig. 2 A) when probed with anti-SNAP-25(full-length)-IgG; it was also detectable with anti-SNAP-25(C terminus)-IgG but not by IgG specific for SNAP-25A (Fig. 2 A). Notably, exposure of these transfected cells to BoNT/A resulted in the loss of labeling with anti-SNAP-25(C terminus)-IgG and the appearance of SNAP-25Areactivity (Fig. 2 A), establishing the susceptibility of the recombinant protein to the toxin. To evaluate the prospect of rescuing release through the introduction of SNAP-25 into BoNT/A-poisoned chromaffin cells, the protein was transiently co-expressed with hGH. The latter, which is normally absent from these cells, co-localizes with catecholamines in LDCVs; thus, evoked hGH secretion serves as an excellent reporter for LDCV exocytosis (21Holz R.W. Senter R.A. Uhler M.D. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Control cells transfected with vectors encoding hGH and the non-toxic protein, CAT, exhibited an appreciable level of Ba2+-evoked hGH release, and this was inhibited extensively in cells pretreated with BoNT/A (Fig. 2 B). Notably, these two values approximate the respective levels of stimulated catecholamine secretion observed for non-transfected cells (Fig. 1 A). Transfection with a plasmid encoding wild-type SNAP-25 increased slightly the amount of hGH secreted from toxin-free cells; significantly, such overexpression of SNAP-25 failed to overcome the extent of inhibition because of BoNT/A poisoning (Fig. 2 B). These results suggested that persistence of BoNT/A protease for 5 days after intoxication maintained the blockade of release; to exclude other factors, SNAP-25 mutants insensitive to BoNT/A had to be constructed and tested. To examine the likelihood of the enzymic activity of the toxin being sustained within poisoned cells, suitable forms of full-length SNAP-25 that were not susceptible to BoNT/A but might be able to mediate exocytosis were constructed and characterized. Amino acids at positions 197 and/or 198 in wild-type SNAP-25, located on either side of the susceptible bond (i.e. the P1 or P′1 sites, nomenclature of Schechter and Berger (24Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4753) Google Scholar)), were altered because an investigation of SNAP-25 peptides had shown that the P′1 arginine residue is critical for cleavage by BoNT/A (25Schmidt J.J. Bostian K.A. J. Protein Chem. 1997; 16: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus, the SNAP-25b gene was altered by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis, and the mutant proteins were expressed as GST-linked products (see “Experimental Procedures”) so that their susceptibility to BoNT-mediated proteolysis could be assessed in vitro. Seven different SNAP-25 mutants were generated containing either single or double substitutions at the P1 and/or P′1 positions (listed in Fig. 3 A). Each GST-SNAP-25 variant was purified by affinity chromatography; SDS-PAGE and Western blotting confirmed that they exhibited the appropriate mobilities and immunoreactivities (not shown). The cleavage of recombinant SNAP-25 by BoNT/A was assessed using an ELISA which measured the amount of full-length substrate remaining. Notably, wild-type and SNAP-25 mutants all exhibited different susceptibilities to BoNT/A (Fig. 3 B); the EC50 values for the cleavage of each was determined from Fig. 3 B and displayed in Table I. Changes at the P′1, but not at the P1, position yielded proteins highly resistant to BoNT/A compared with the wild-type substrate; replacement of P′1 arginine with either alanine (R198A) or threonine (R198T) reduced degradation of SNAP-25 by ∼550- and ∼16,000-fold, respectively (Table I). In contrast, alteration of the P1 glutamine to alanine caused little change (Q197A; Table I). On the other hand, double-point mutations incorporating the innocuous P1 alanine replacement in addition to alterations at the P′1 site to alanine (Q197A/R198A) or lysine (Q197A/R198K) greatly decreased sensitivity to proteolysis by type A toxin, with the latter proving to be the most resistant (∼38,000-fold reduction in susceptibility). Other double-point mutations at the P1 and P′1 positions (i.e. the wild-type Gln197/Arg198 sequence to either KH, naturally occurring in Torpedo SNAP-25 (26Risinger C. Blomqvist A.G. Lundell I. Lambertsson A. Nassel D. Pieribone V.A. Brodin L. Larhammar D. J. Protein Chem. 1993; 268: 24408-24414Google Scholar), or WW) caused far less resistance to BoNT/A (∼440- and ∼96-fold, respectively; Table I). It was hoped that, at least, some of these SNAP-25 variants could rescue evoked exocytosis from inhibition by BoNT/A.Table ISusceptibilities of wild-type and various SNAP-25 mutants to cleavage by BoNT/ASNAP-25 variantPosition of mutated residue(s)Minimum BoNT/A concentration necessary to proteolyse 50% of SNAP-25 in the standard assayaStandard curves, relating increasing amounts of intact GST-SNAP-25 per well to the increasing A 405 nm values recorded, were used to calculate the A 405 nm reading which was equivalent to 50% intact SNAP-25 remaining in wells.

Open table in a new tab For the initial rescue experiments, R198T was selected for several reasons: (i) its high resistance to BoNT/A; (ii) a single substitution was deemed more likely than a double to be able to mediate exocytosis and cause rescue in toxin-treated cells, and (iii) in the unlikely event of it being cleaved intracellularly, the product would be detectable with anti-SNAP-25A-IgG because of the retention of Gln197 (which was altered in the double mutants). As a preliminary to the complicated rescue experiments, the expression of R198T and its lack of susceptibility to BoNT/A were first established in CHO cells. After transfection, as described above, R198T was found to be expressed at a level similar to that of wild-type SNAP-25, as judged from the labeling on blots using two antibodies reactive with full-length SNAP-25 or its C-terminal region (Fig. 2 A). Exposure of the transfected cells to BoNT/A did not lower the R198T reactivity with anti-SNAP-25(C terminus)-IgG, and furthermore, no product could be observed with SNAP-25A-IgG (Fig. 2 A). Having demonstrated that R198T mutant was expressed but not cleaved by BoNT/A in mammalian cells, plasmids encoding several such SNAP-25 mutants were introduced into chromaffin cells.

Conversely, bound calmodulin protects RYR1 from the effects of oxidants (Zhang, J.-Z., Wu, Y., Williams, B. Y., Rodney, G., Mandel, F., Strasburg, G. M., and Hamilton, S. L. (1999)Am. J. Physiol. 276, Cell Physiol. C46–C53). In addition, calmodulin protects RYR1 from trypsin cleavage at amino acids 3630 and 3637 (Moore, C. P., Rodney, G., Zhang, J.-Z., Santacruz-Toloza, L., Strasburg, G. M., and Hamilton, S. L. (1999) Biochemistry 38, 8532–8537). The sequence between these two tryptic sites is AVVACFR. Alkylation of RYR1 with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) blocks both35S-apocalmodulin binding and oxidation-induced intersubunit cross-linking. In the current work, we demonstrate that both cysteines needed for the oxidation-induced intersubunit cross-link are protected from alkylation with N-ethylmaleimide by bound calmodulin. We also show, using N-terminal amino acid sequencing together with analysis of the distribution of [3H]NEM labeling with each sequencing cycle, that cysteine 3635 of RYR1 is rapidly labeled by NEM and that this labeling is blocked by bound calmodulin. We propose that cysteine 3635 is located at an intersubunit contact site that is close to or within a calmodulin binding site. These findings suggest that calmodulin and oxidation modulate RYR1 activity by regulating intersubunit interactions in a mutually exclusive manner and that these interactions involve cysteine 3635. Oxidation of the skeletal muscle Ca2+ release channel (RYR1) increases its activity, produces intersubunit disulfide bonds, and blocks its interaction with calmodulin. Conversely, bound calmodulin protects RYR1 from the effects of oxidants (Zhang, J.-Z., Wu, Y., Williams, B. Y., Rodney, G., Mandel, F., Strasburg, G. M., and Hamilton, S. L. (1999)Am. J.

Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). One of the proteins involved in excitation-contraction coupling, the skeletal muscle Ca2+-release channel, is modulated by both oxidants (8Favero T.G. Zable A.C. Abramson J.J. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25462-25467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This regulation appears to be controlled, at least in part, by the binding of calmodulin (CaM) to RYR1 (12Zhang J.-Z. Wu Y. Williams B.Y. Rodney G. Mandel F. Strasburg G.M. Hamilton S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C46-C53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Moore C.P. Rodney G. Zhang J.-Z. Santacruz-Toloza L. Strasburg G.M. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8532-8537Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Ca2+-free CaM is a partial agonist of RYR1, whereas Ca2+-CaM is an inhibitor (14Tripathy A. Xu L. Mann G. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 106-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In addition to these direct functional effects, CaM bound to RYR1 protects the channel from oxidation-induced intersubunit cross-linking (12Zhang J.-Z. Wu Y. Williams B.Y. Rodney G. Mandel F. Strasburg G.M. Hamilton S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C46-C53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and conversely, oxidation can block CaM binding to RYR1. In contrast to the effects of oxidation, alkylation of RYR1 with NEM rapidly destroys the ability of RYR1 to bind 35S-Ca2+-free CaM (apoCaM) but does not alter its ability to bind35S-Ca2+-CaM. Alkylation also prevents oxidation-induced intersubunit cross-linking. Our studies suggest that there is only one CaM site per subunit of RYR1 at either high or low Ca2+ (13Moore C.P. Rodney G. Zhang J.-Z. Santacruz-Toloza L. Strasburg G.M. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8532-8537Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Some indication of the location of the CaM binding site has been obtained from examination of sites on RYR1 protected from tryptic cleavage by CaM (13Moore C.P. Rodney G. Zhang J.-Z. Santacruz-Toloza L. Strasburg G.M. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8532-8537Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Treatment of RYR1 with trypsin rapidly destroys its ability to bind CaM, but CaM bound to RYR1 can protect its binding site from tryptic digestion. The sites protected by Ca2+-CaM or apoCaM are at amino acids 3630 and 3637, suggesting that either the binding sites for CaM in both the Ca2+-free and Ca2+-bound forms are physically close to this region of RYR1 or that the binding of both forms of CaM produces a conformational change that buries this region of RYR1. The latter possibility seems unlikely because the functional effects of apoCaM are opposite those of Ca2+-CaM. The sequence between these two sites is AVVACFR, suggesting that cysteine 3635 may be one of the cysteines that, in the absence of CaM, can form the intersubunit disulfide bond. This intersubunit contact site is likely to represent an important site for regulating RYR1 activity. In the current study, we demonstrate that cysteine 3635 is one of the amino acids involved in redox modulation of RYR1. Both [3H]NEM (47 Ci/mmol) and [14C]NEM (0.04 Ci/mmol) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Dithiothreitol (DTT), NEM, MOPS, CHAPS, EGTA, and bovine serum albumin were obtained from Sigma. Digitonin was purchased from CalBiochem (La Jolla, Ca). Unlabeled CaM (bovine brain) was obtained either from Sigma or from Upstate Biochemicals (Lake Placid, N.Y.). SR membranes were prepared from rabbit leg and backstrap white skeletal muscle and were purified using sucrose gradient centrifugation as described previously (15Hamilton S.L. Tate C.A. McCormack J.G.C. Cellular Calcium. IRL Press, Oxford1991: 313-343Google Scholar). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described by Laemmli (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) or Schägger and von Jaggow (17Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). SR membranes were reduced with 0.1 mm DTT for 30 min at room temperature. Excess DTT was removed by pelleting in an Airfuge for 5 min at 30 p.s.i. The membranes (1 mg/ml) were then labeled with 10 μm [3H]NEM in the presence or absence of CaM for 10 min on ice. Reactions and CaM incubations were carried out in either high Ca2+ buffer (300 mm NaCl, 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 1 mm EGTA, 1.2 mmCaCl2) or low Ca2+ buffer (300 mmNaCl, 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 1 mm EGTA). The reactions were stopped by the addition of DTT to 0.1 mm. Protein was centrifuged in a Beckman TL100.3 rotor for 45 min at 30,000 rpm and resuspended to remove CaM. Diamide was added to 100 μm and incubated for 30 min on ice to induce intersubunit cross-links of RYR1. NEM was added to 5 mm to stop the reaction with diamide. Equal amounts of protein were electrophoresed on a 5% Laemmli gel (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). SR membranes were trypsinized for 10 min at 37 °C at a protease to protein ratio of 1:1000. Digestion was halted by the addition of 20× soybean trypsin inhibitor. After solubilization in 2% digitonin, proteolyzed complexes were purified over a 5–20% linear sucrose gradient containing 0.4% CHAPS for 18 h. Fractions were collected, and peak protein was assessed by a Bradford assay (18Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar).

The activity of RYR1 is modulated by modification of its cysteine residues by oxidation (8Favero T.G. Zable A.C. Abramson J.J. J. Biol.

Science. 1998; 279: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). The cysteine residues involved in these reactions have not previously been identified. The identification of the cysteines involved in these modulations is difficult because RYR1 has 100 cysteines per subunit. However, the functionally important cysteines appear to be hyper-reactive (21Aghdasi B. Zhang J.Z. Wu Y. Reid M. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3739-3748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 22Feng W. Liu G. Xia R. Abramson J.J. Pessah I.N. Mol.

We have previously shown that the N terminus of RYR1 contains sulfhydryls that react rapidly with NEM (19Wu Y. Aghdasi B. Dou S.J. Zhang J.Z. Liu S.Q. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25051-25061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Other sulfhydryls also react rapidly with this reagent, in particular, the cysteines that alter the ability of RYR1 to bind CaM. Alkylation of less than 5% of the total RYR1 sulfhydryls completely blocks35S-apoCaM binding to RYR1, without altering the ability of RYR1 to bind either 35S-Ca2+-CaM or [3H]ryanodine (12Zhang J.-Z. Wu Y. Williams B.Y. Rodney G. Mandel F. Strasburg G.M. Hamilton S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C46-C53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, both Ca2+-CaM and apoCaM can protect this site from NEM inactivation (data not shown), suggesting a steric inhibition of 35S-apoCaM, but not 35S-Ca2+-CaM binding. Are the sulfhydryls that are alkylated under these conditions also those that form the intersubunit disulfide bond? To assess this, we made use of our previous observation that NEM blocks diamide-induced intersubunit cross-linking and asked whether bound CaM could protect both cysteines needed for the cross-link from NEM alkylation (Fig. 1). For this experiment, apoCaM was first bound to RYR1, and the membranes were then treated with NEM. To avoid the effect of CaM on the diamide cross-linking, the bound CaM was removed by washing. The membranes were then treated with diamide under conditions previously shown to generate disulfide bonds between neighboring subunits (19Wu Y. Aghdasi B. Dou S.J. Zhang J.Z. Liu S.Q. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25051-25061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Alkylation in the absence of apoCaM prevented diamide-induced intersubunit cross-linking (Fig. 1,lane 2). If, however, apoCaM was bound at the time of NEM alkylation and the apoCaM was then removed by washing, diamide-induced intersubunit cross-link was detected (Fig. 1, lane 3). The same result was obtained using Ca2+-CaM (data not shown), suggesting that CaM (either form) either protects both of the cysteines involved in the intersubunit cross-link or one of the cysteines does not react with NEM even in the absence of CaM. These findings again support a model in which CaM binds at a site of intersubunit contact. The CaM binding sites on RYR1 are extremely sensitive to tryptic cleavage (13Moore C.P. Rodney G. Zhang J.-Z. Santacruz-Toloza L. Strasburg G.M. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8532-8537Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We have previously identified the fragments of RYR1 generated by trypsin cleavage (24Callaway C. Seryshev A. Wang J.P. Slavik K. Needleman D.H. Cantu C. Wu Y. Jayaraman T. Marks A.R. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15876-15884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One fragment is a 160-kDa polypeptide that begins at amino acid 3119 and extends to the C terminus. A second cleavage generates a smaller fragment that probably ends at amino acid 4475. Bound CaM protects both of these fragments from additional cleavages at amino acids 3630 and 3637. Bound CaM also protects these fragments from labeling with [14C]NEM (Fig. 2), suggesting that these fragments contain the cysteine(s) that regulates CaM binding. Also seen in Fig. 2are two bands (bands c and f) that are very heavily labeled by [14C]NEM under these conditions, but their labeling is not altered by the presence of calmodulin. We have previously identified these bands as fragments of the N terminus (24Callaway C. Seryshev A. Wang J.P. Slavik K. Needleman D.H. Cantu C. Wu Y. Jayaraman T. Marks A.R. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15876-15884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bands obtained after labeling in low Ca2+ have also been excised and digested, and the radiolabel was quantified. We find a 65 ± 13% (n = 3) decrease in radioactivity in the 160-kDa band and a 41 ± 19% (n = 3) decrease in the 150-kDa when labeling is carried out in the presence of CaM. An examination of the sequence between the two CaM protected cleavage sites shows a cysteine at position 3635. To test whether this cysteine modulates CaM binding, we incubated membranes in the presence and absence of CaM at μm Ca2+ and then reacted with [3H]NEM. In these experiments, CaM was then removed by successive washes, and the membranes were digested with trypsin. This treatment cleaves RYR1 after amino acids 3630 and 3637, producing two fragments in approximately equal amounts that differ by 7 amino acids. The N-terminal sequence of fragment 1 that begins at amino acid 3630 is AVVACFRMTPLYNLPT, and fragment 2 that begins at amino acid 3637 is MTPLYNLPTHRAC. In fragment 1 there are cysteines that will be detected at sequencing cycles 5 and 20, whereas fragment 2 has a cysteine that would be detected at cycle 13. Half of the sample from each round of sequencing was collected for scintillation counting. The3H radiolabel was detected only in the fifth cycle of sequencing, corresponding to cysteine 3635 in fragment 1 (Fig. 3). Fragment 2 has a tyrosine at cycle 5. The incorporation was greatly decreased by the presence of CaM during the labeling (Fig. 3). No radiolabel was detected in cycle 13 or 20, the position of cysteine 3650 in fragments 2 and 1, respectively. Our data suggest that one potential site of redox modulation of RYR1 is cysteine 3635 and that the reactivity of this residue is regulated by the binding of CaM to RYR1. CaM protects RYR1 from oxidation-induced intersubunit cross-linking and alkylation-induced inactivation of the apoCaM-binding site. Our findings support the assignment of cysteine 3635 as the site of NEM alkylation that blocks apoCaM binding. The question is whether this cysteine is also one of the two cysteines involved in the intersubunit cross-link. NEM can prevent the formation of the diamide-induced disulfide, but not if CaM is bound to RYR1, demonstrating that either both of the intersubunit disulfide bond-forming cysteines are protected by CaM or that one of these cysteines does not react with NEM even in the absence of CaM. Although we cannot completely eliminate the possibility that the cysteines involved in the intersubunit cross-link are allosterically modulated by CaM binding, this seems unlikely because both apoCaM and Ca2+-CaM, which have opposite effects on channel activity, can protect against oxidation-induced intersubunit cross-linking, alkylation of cysteine 3635, and trypsin cleavage at amino acids 3630 and 3637. We propose that cysteine 3635 can be disulfide bonded to a cysteine on a neighboring subunit of the RYR1 tetramer."

Thirdly, copper delivery and incorporation into cytosolic superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1)1 is mediated by the soluble copper carrier, CCS (copperchaperone for SOD), also known inSaccharomyces cerevisiae as LYS7 (13Culotta V.C.

J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 716-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Studies with the yeast metallochaperone have shown that CCS directly incorporates copper into SOD1 despite exquisitely low levels of available free copper (15Rae T.D. Schmidt P.J. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1999; 284: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar). The target of the CCS metallochaperone, SOD1, is a homodimeric copper- and zinc-requiring enzyme that acts to disproportionate superoxide (O2) to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and oxygen in a reaction catalyzed by the redox cycling of bound copper (16McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, SOD1 is also capable of catalyzing deleterious reactions involving the redox active copper cofactor. The Cu(I) form of SOD1 can react with H2O2 to generate the highly toxic hydroxyl radical (OH⋅) (17Borders C.L. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem.

In fact, it has been suggested that this inherent peroxidase activity of SOD1 may be involved in cases of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in which disease results from dominant mutations in SOD1 (20Yim M.B.

It is noteworthy that the human CCS metallochaperone harbors a polypeptide region bearing striking resemblance to SOD1. This region, found in the central 16-kDa portion of CCS, is postulated to serve in target recognition of SOD1 (25Casareno R.L.B. Waggoner D. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23625-23628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), whereas smaller segments at the N and C terminus of CCS are thought to facilitate the binding and release of copper into SOD1 (26Schmidt P. Rae T.D. Pufahl R.A. Hamma T. Strain J. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23719-23725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Homology between the central portion of CCS and SOD1 approaches 50% identity and 60% similarity (25Casareno R.L.B. Waggoner D. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23625-23628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Based on this curious conservation of sequence, CCS was originally postulated to be “SOD4,” the fourth mammalian SOD (GenBankTM accession number 1608528). The concordance of sequence between SOD1 and CCS was the focus of current studies. CCS molecules from diverse mammals contain all of the zinc binding ligands found in SOD1 and three of four histidine copper binding ligands; the fourth histidine is always substituted by an aspartate. We demonstrate here that the presence of this single aspartate prohibits CCS from functioning as a SOD. Substituting this aspartate with a histidine results in a CCS molecule with significant superoxide scavenging activity. Furthermore, this variant of CCS appears to be a bifunctional SOD, capable of self-activation with copper. The isogenic wild type SY1699 and lys7 null SY2950 strains were previously described (27Horecka J. Kinsey P.T. Sprague G.F. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 162: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), as was the sod1Δ sod2Δ strain KS100 (28Culotta V.C. Joh H.D. Lin S.J. Slekar K.H. Strain J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29991-29997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). VC107 and VC279 are sod1Δ::TRP1 derivatives of SY1699 and SY2950, respectively, and PS120 is a lys7Δ::URA3derivative of KS100. Stocks of yeast strains were maintained by growth on enriched YPD medium (29Sherman F. Fink G.R. Lawrence C.W. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1978: 163-168Google Scholar) in anaerobic culture jars (BBL, GasPak), whereas growth tests for lysine auxotrophy utilized a synthetic minimal medium (29Sherman F. Fink G.R. Lawrence C.W. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1978: 163-168Google Scholar). The vector for expression of human CCS in yeast cells is pCCS-HIS, containing the human CCS coding sequence under the control of theS. cerevisiae PGK1 (phosphoglycerol kinase) promoter. pCCS-HIS was constructed by mobilizing the PGK1-CCS fusion from pSMCCS (13Culotta V.C. Klomp L.W.J. Strain J. Casareno R.L.B. Krems B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23469-23472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar) by digestion with BamHI and SalI and by insertion at these same sites into pRS423 (HIS32μ; Ref. 30Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human SOD1 was expressed in yeast by the pLC1 vector (URA3 2μ) where the SOD1 cDNA was placed under the control of the PGK1 promoter as described (31Corson L.B. Strain J. Culotta V.C. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6361-6366Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). pSM703 is the PGK1 promoter-containing vector (URA3 2μ) that served as the parent plasmid for construction of all human SOD1 and CCS expression plasmids. Plasmids pMR002 and pPS030 for the expression of D200H CCS and H120D SOD1 were derived from pCCS-HIS and pLC1, respectively, through use of the Quick Change Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) per manufacturer's instructions. Cell lysates were prepared essentially as described (13Culotta V.C. Klomp L.W.J. Strain J. Casareno R.L.B. Krems B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23469-23472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Strains transformed with the appropriate plasmids were grown approximately 18 h to an A 600 of 1.5 in 50 ml of selecting SD medium (29Sherman F. Fink G.R. Lawrence C.W. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1978: 163-168Google Scholar); cells were harvested and were lysed by glass bead homogenization in 0.2–0.5 ml of a lysis buffer containing 10 mm NaPO4 (pH 7.8), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton, 50 mm NaCl, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1.0 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Glycerol was added to the final lysates at a concentration of 5%. As needed, lysates were concentrated by Microcon-10 Microconcentrator (Amicon) columns per manufacturer's instructions. For analysis of SOD activity, extracts were applied directly without boiling to a nondenaturing 12% precast polyacrylamide gel (Novex). Following electrophoresis, the gel was subject to nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) staining for superoxide (32Flohe L. Otting F. Packer L. Methods in Enzymology: Oxygen Radicals in Biological Systems. Academic Press, New York1984: 93-104Google Scholar) in a 75-ml solution containing one tablet of NBT (10 mg/tablet), 50 mmKPO4 (pH 7.8), 0.1 mg/ml riboflavin, and 1 μl/ml TEMED. Western blot analyses of lysates were carried out as described (33Lin S.J. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6303-6312Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 34Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.39-7.52Google Scholar) using a denaturing 14% polyacrylamide gel. A polyclonal rabbit anti-human SOD1 serum (kind gift of D. Borchelt, Johns Hopkins University) and a polyclonal CCS antibody (obtained from Jeff Rothstein, Johns Hopkins University) were used at 1:5000 and 1:500 dilutions, respectively, and were detected using as secondary antibody, anti-rabbit donkey IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Visualization involved the Hybond ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For immunoprecipitation of human CCS and yeast SOD1, 50–100 μg of cell lysate protein was reacted with either anti-CCS (1:100 dilution), anti-yeast SOD1 (1:500 dilution; kind gift of Dan Kosman, SUNY, Buffalo), or preimmune serum (1:100 dilution) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40, as needed. Following incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, 20 μl of a 50% suspension of A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) was added, and incubation continued for an additional hour. The mixture was subjected to microcentrifugation for 1 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatants were concentrated on Microcon-10 Microconcentrator (Amicon) columns. The central region of human CCS encompassing amino acids 78 to 232 shares nearly 50% identity with human SOD1. All four of the zinc binding ligands of SOD1 and three of four histidine copper binding ligands are present in CCS; the fourth histidine is replaced by an aspartate residue, which is also a possible ligand for copper (35Lippard S.J. Berg J.M. Principles of Bioinorganic Chemistry. University Science Books, Mill Valley, CA1994: 45Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). Interestingly, this precise pattern of homology to SOD1 is observed with murine CCS (36Nishihara E. Furuyama T. Yamashita S. Mori N. Mol. Neurosci. 1998; 9: 3259-3263Google Scholar). Based on sequence analysis alone it would seem plausible that mammalian CCS should possess SOD activity. To address this question in vivo, human CCS was expressed in a yeast strain lacking SOD1 and was assayed for the ability to overcome the oxidative damage of these cells. Yeast sod1Δ mutants cannot synthesize lysine when grown in air due to oxidative damage of lysine biosynthetic component(s) (37Liu X.F. Elashvili I. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Lapinskas P. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18298-18302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Gralla E.B. Kosman D.J. Adv. Genet. 1992; 30: 251-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 39Bilinski T. Krawiec Z. Liczmanski L. Litwinska J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This defect is readily corrected by expression of the heterologous human SOD1 (Fig. 1 C). However, expression of human CCS failed to complement the lysine auxotrophy of the sod1 mutant (Fig. 1 C) even though the protein accumulated to substantial levels (Fig. 1 B). By a NBT gel assay for SOD activity (32Flohe L. Otting F. Packer L. Methods in Enzymology: Oxygen Radicals in Biological Systems. Academic Press, New York1984: 93-104Google Scholar), CCS exhibited no detectable scavenging of superoxide (Fig. 2 A, lane 5). Therefore, despite the exquisite homology between SOD1 and human CCS, the copper chaperone appears nonfunctional for SOD activity. The most noteworthy difference between SOD1 and the SOD1 homology domain of human CCS is the substitution of a copper binding histidine with an aspartate (Fig. 1 A). To test whether this single amino acid variance precludes SOD activity, the aspartate at CCS position 200 was mutated to a histidine. By Western blot analysis, D200H CCS accumulated to wild type levels when expressed in yeast (Fig. 1 B). Surprisingly, expression of this mutant CCS molecule effectively complemented the yeast sod1 mutation (Fig. 1 C), suggesting that this metallochaperone had acquired SOD activity. D200H CCS was directly examined for superoxide scavenging activity by the NBT gel assay. These studies were conducted in the background of a sod1Δ sod2Δ strain devoid of any endogenous SOD activity (Fig. 2 A, lane 1). As seen in Fig. 2 A, a dose response of superoxide scavenging activity was detected in lysates from cells expressing D200H CCS. 2It is unclear whether D200H CCS is active as a monomer or dimer. On nondenaturing gels, the superoxide scavenging activity associated with D200H migrates to a position that lies between dimeric SOD1 and tetrameric SOD2. To establish that the mutant CCS molecule was indeed responsible for this activity, cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with either an anti-CCS antibody or preimmune control sera prior to analysis of superoxide scavenging activity. As seen in Fig. 2 B, treatment with anti-CCS depleted all activity from the cell lysates, demonstrating that D200H CCS is capable of scavenging superoxide. The gain of activity observed with D200H CCS indicated that aspartate 200 in this molecule is sufficient to prohibit SOD activity. To confirm this, we conducted the reverse mutagenesis experiment in which the fourth histidine copper ligand in human SOD1 was substituted with an aspartate (Fig. 1 A). The resultant H120D SOD1 molecule accumulated to significant levels when expressed in thesod1Δ strain and like other mutant alleles of human SOD1 (31Corson L.B. Strain J. Culotta V.C. Cleveland D.W.

As seen in Fig. 3 B, H120D SOD1 was nonfunctional in complementing the aerobic lysine auxotrophy of the sod1Δ mutant. Furthermore, when more directly visualized by the NBT gel assay, the H120D SOD1 mutant exhibited no detectable SOD activity (Fig. 3 C). The strong inhibitory effect of the H120D mutation on SOD1 activity supports the notion that the aspartate residue at CCS position 200 is sufficient to prevent this molecule from functioning as a SOD. We next tested whether amino acid Asp200 in human CCS evolved to facilitate copper transfer to SOD1. To monitor the metallochaperone activity of CCS, wild type and D200H CCS molecules were expressed in a lys7Δ null strain lacking the yeast CCS molecule (Fig. 4 A). Yeast SOD1 is still present in lys7Δ strains but is normally inactive because the enzyme is apo for copper (13Culotta V.C. Klomp L.W.J. Strain J. Casareno R.L.B. Krems B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23469-23472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 15Rae T.D. Schmidt P.J. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V.

However, yeast SOD1 can be fully activated by expression of the human CCS metallochaperone (Fig. 4 B). By direct monitoring of SOD1 activity, the wild type and D200H mutant CCS molecules appeared equally capable of charging yeast SOD1 with copper (Fig. 4 B). Compared with the experiment of Fig. 2, this study utilized a low level of cell lysate to minimize interference from the superoxide scavenging activity of D200H CCS. To confirm that the activity observed in Fig. 4 B indeed reflected SOD1 and not D200H CCS, an immunodepletion experiment was conducted. As seen in Fig. 4 C, the activity observed with cells coexpressing SOD1 and D200H CCS was immunodepleted with an antibody directed against yeast SOD1 and not human CCS. Thus, D200H CCS retains full activity as a metallochaperone for SOD1. Because the D200H CCS molecule retains its function as a copper chaperone and also exhibits superoxide scavenging activity, is it possible that this SOD-like molecule can act as its own metallochaperone? To address this, the mutant CCS molecule was expressed in a strain lacking both SOD1 and the yeast copper chaperone LYS7. This strain cannot grow on medium lacking lysine; however, the D200H CCS mutant rescued oxidative damage and supported lysine independent growth (Fig. 5 A). By the NBT gel assay, it is evident that D200H CCS is capable of superoxide scavenging even in the absence of the yeast copper chaperone LYS7 (Fig. 5 B,lanes 2–4). Therefore, the D200H mutant of CCS appears to self-activate itself for superoxide scavenging activity. The mammalian CCS metallochaperone has evolved with a domain exhibiting remarkable homology to its target of copper delivery, SOD1. Based on this high degree of sequence identity, SOD activity would not have been an unreasonable assumption. In fact, a number of copper-containing complexes have been shown to scavenge superoxide (43Lengfelder E. Weser U. Bull. Eur. Physiopathol. Respir. 1981; 17: 73-80PubMed Google Scholar, 44deAlvare L.R. Goda K. Kimura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 69: 687-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 45Batinic-Haberle I. Liochev S.I. Spasojevic I. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, CCS exhibits no detectable superoxide scavenging activity, and prohibition of SOD activity is in part accomplished by the presence of a single aspartate residue (Asp200) at the putative copper site. Substitution of this aspartate with histidine helps to reconstruct the four-histidine copper site of SOD1 and is sufficient to unlock the superoxide scavenging capacity of CCS. It is curious that mammalian CCS has evolved to look so much like SOD1 without retaining SOD activity. Presumably, this striking homology is required for CCS recognition of SOD1. SOD1 normally exists as a homodimer (46Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Beem K.M. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 160: 181-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar), and the formation of a transient heterodimer (or multimer) between enzyme and CCS metallochaperone may initiate metal transfer. Physical interaction between SOD1 and the SOD homology domain of CCS has in fact been demonstrated by Gitlin and colleagues (25Casareno R.L.B. Waggoner D. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23625-23628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Because metal binding can affect the conformation of SOD1 (42Lyons T.J. Nerissian A. Goto J.J. Zhu H. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Bioinorg. Chem. 1998; 3: 650-662Google Scholar), the presence of a SOD1-like copper site in CCS may contribute to the overall domain structure needed for target recognition. It is not known whether copper binds at this site, yet if this were the case, the metal appears incapable of the redox cycling needed for superoxide scavenging. As an added advantage, abrogation of copper redox chemistry should also prohibit the deleterious peroxidase activity typical of SOD1 (18Yim M.B. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5006-5010Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 19Yim M.B. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4099-4105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on homology to SOD1, there are four possible copper ligands in the central domain of CCS, and of these, placement of an aspartate at position 200 seems best suited to preclude redox damage to the protein. Uchida and Kawakishi (47Uchida K. Kawakishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2405-2410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that at the analogous position in human SOD1 (His120) the histidine is highly susceptible to oxidation, whereas the remaining three histidine copper ligands are not. Hence, the presence of Asp200 in CCS appears perfectly designed to prohibit self-oxidation of the copper chaperone or oxidation of its intimate partner, SOD1. Although mammalian CCS exhibits great homology to SOD1, far less homology is evident when one compares the central domain of yeast CCS to that of yeast SOD1 (approximately 25% identity at the amino acid level). Furthermore, as revealed through x-ray crystallographic studies by Rosenzweig and co-workers (48Lamb A.L. Wernimont A.K. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C. Nature Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 724-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), the central domain of yeast CCS is devoid of a metal binding cavity, even though the overall structure is remarkably similar to SOD1. The loss of this metal binding site in yeast CCS may reflect a unique requirement for activation of yeast SOD1. Valentine and co-workers (42Lyons T.J. Nerissian A. Goto J.J. Zhu H. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Bioinorg. Chem. 1998; 3: 650-662Google Scholar) have demonstrated that unlike mammalian SOD1, which forms a symmetrical homodimer, the yeast enzyme adopts an asymmetrical conformation in which there is unequal metallation of the two subunits (42Lyons T.J. Nerissian A. Goto J.J. Zhu H. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Bioinorg. Chem. 1998; 3: 650-662Google Scholar). As fungal SOD1 diverged from the human enzyme, it is likely that their respective metallochaperones evolved concomitantly to conform to specific metallation requirements. Why do separate molecules exist for SOD1 and its metallochaperone? Our studies here with human D200H CCS indicate that it is possible to manufacture a self-sufficient SOD molecule that can charge itself with copper. Although more energy-consuming, the synthesis of separate molecules for superoxide scavenging and metal incorporation may allow for control of SOD1 activity at the post-translational level. In general, the SOD1 polypeptide is ubiquitously expressed, but the fraction of apo- to holoSOD1 can vary greatly among cell types and tissues (49Petrovic N. Comi A. Ettinger M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28331-28334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 50Rossi L. Marchese E. DeMartino A. Rotilio G. Ciriolo M.R.

It is also a signaling molecule (6Garcia V.E. Soncini F.C. Groisman E.A.

FEBS Lett. 1990; 269: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This suggests Mg2+ may also be a signaling molecule in eukaryotes (15Grubbs R.D. Maguire M.E. Magnesium. 1987; 6: 113-127PubMed Google Scholar,16Maguire M.E. Met. Ions Biol. Syst. 1990; 26: 135-153Google Scholar). Despite these many functions, little is known about the regulation of intracellular Mg2+ and the mechanism of Mg2+transport. The CorA class of Mg2+ transporters is by far the most abundant class of prokaryotic Mg2+ transporter (17Hmiel S.P. Snavely M.D. Florer J.B. Maguire M.E. Miller C.G. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4742-4751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hmiel S.P. Snavely M.D. Miller C.G. Maguire M.E. J.

CorA homologues are found in almost all Gram-positive and Gram-negative Bacteria and in Archaea such as Archeoglobus fulgidis andMethanococcus jannaschii. There are also distantly related proteins in yeast and possibly other eukaryotes (21Kehres D. Lawyer C.H. Maguire M.E. Microbial Comp. Genomics. 1998; 43: 151-169Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 22MacDiarmid C.W. Gardner R.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 20438-20443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). It is likely that most of the members of this family are true homologues of theSalmonella typhimurium CorA and transport Mg2+. This is evidenced by the CorA homologue from the Archeon M. jannaschii. When expressed in S. typhimurium, this homologue appears to transport Mg2+with essentially identical properties as the S. typhimuriumCorA, despite only 22% sequence identity and a considerably different native membrane environment (24Smith R.L. Gottlieb E. Kucharski L.M. Maguire M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2788-2791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CorA is apparently constitutively expressed and transports Mg2+ with high capacity. CorA is functionally distinct from the MgtA/MgtB and MgtE classes of Mg2+ transporters because it also transports Co2+ and Ni2+ and has been shown to efflux Mg2+ at very high external Mg2+concentrations (25Snavely M.D. Florer J.B. Miller C.G. Maguire M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4761-4766Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 26Gibson M.M. Bagga D.A. Miller C.G. Maguire M.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2753-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 27Smith R.L. Maguire M.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Mg2+ influx through CorA should not require energy other than the membrane potential; however, the transport mechanism is unknown. The topology of CorA is quite unusual among transporters in that it contains a very large periplasmic domain at its amino terminus and a small membrane domain at the carboxyl terminus (28Smith R.L. Banks J.L. Snavely M.D. Maguire M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14071-14080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane domain consists of only three TMs.1 TM2 and TM3 are highly conserved, and only one of over forty homologues contains even a single charged residue in these two segments. TM1 contains a variable number of charged residues, none of which are conserved (21Kehres D. Lawyer C.H. Maguire M.E. Microbial Comp. Genomics. 1998; 43: 151-169Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The S. typhimurium CorA contains a single negatively charged residue in TM1 that is not required for transport (29Smith R.L. Szegedy M.A. Kucharski L.M. Walker C. Wiet R.M. Redpath A. Kaczmarek M.L. Maguire M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28663-28669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This lack of charge within the membrane is highly unusual for a cation transporter as most, if not all, contain charged residues in one or more membrane helices to counterbalance the charge of the ion being transported. Therefore, CorA-mediated transport of Mg2+ appears quite different from known mechanisms of selective ion transport. Previous mutagenesis studies targeting TM3 indicated that a single face of the presumed α-helix contained three residues important for transport and therefore appeared to form part of a “Mg2+pore”. This report describes the mutagenesis of TM2. In contrast to studies on TM3, several residues within TM2 are important for transport, and their kinetic properties have led to insights of the transport process. All media were obtained from Difco. All other reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). Supplemented N-minimal medium (N-Min) (30Nelson D.L. Kennedy E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 3042-3049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) contains 0.1% casamino acids and 0.4% (w/v) glucose. MgSO4 was used when medium was supplemented with Mg2+. The concentrations of antibiotics used were 50 μg/ml ampicillin, 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 50 μg/ml kanamycin. Mutations were created using one of two similar vectors. Mutations of corA in plasmid pRS170 (29Smith R.L. Szegedy M.A. Kucharski L.M. Walker C. Wiet R.M. Redpath A. Kaczmarek M.L. Maguire M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28663-28669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) were made using the Altered Sites® II kit (Promega, Madison, WI). The QuikChangeTM Mutagenesis System (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to create mutations ofcorA in plasmid pMAS29, which is pRS170 with the ampicillin gene repaired. Mutations were verified by sequencing the 3′-portion of the gene, which included the entire membrane domain. The plasmids were propagated as described (29Smith R.L. Szegedy M.A. Kucharski L.M.

Transport and growth by CorA mutants were analyzed in MM281, a Mg2+ transport-deficient strain (18Hmiel S.P. Snavely M.D. Miller C.G. Maguire M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 1444-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), with Western blot analysis performed as described previously (29Smith R.L. Szegedy M.A. Kucharski L.M. Walker C. Wiet R.M.

Briefly, overnight cultures of the mutants were lysed by French Press, and the membranes were pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Protein quantitation was done using the Pierce BCA Assay. Membrane samples were analyzed by loading 10 μg of protein on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and transferring to nitrocellulose. CorA expression was visualized using an antibody directed to the 16 residues at the amino terminus (29Smith R.L. Szegedy M.A. Kucharski L.M. Walker C. Wiet R.M. Redpath A. Kaczmarek M.L. Maguire M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28663-28669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For those mutants exhibiting altered migration on Western blots, the entire coding region of the gene was sequenced to verify the absence of secondary mutations. Complementation of the Mg2+ transport-deficient strain MM281 was determined by streaking a single colony from an LB plate onto an N-Min plate containing 0.25% (w/v) glucose and 0.5 mm leucine and incubating at 37 °C for 48 h. The growth assay can detect mutants able to take up sufficient Mg2+ to grow but whose transport capacity is too low to be measured by the Ni2+transport assay. The growth assay also can detect mutations that hinder cell growth yet retain measurable amounts of cation uptake. Growth in supplemented N-Min medium with varying concentrations of Mg2+ was determined by adding 5 × 103cells/well in a 96-well microtiter plate, assuming 2 × 108 cells = 1 A 600 nm. The total volume in each well was 100 μl. The inside plate cover was coated with Never Fog® (North American, Atlanta, GA) to prevent condensation during the incubation. MgSO4concentrations used were: 0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 50, and 100 mm. The OD650 nm was measured every 30 min for 16 h using a Molecular Devices THERMOmaxTMplate reader held at 37 °C. The Mg2+ transport-deficient strain, MM281, required at least 2.5 mm Mg2+ to grow. MM281 with wild type CorA on plasmid pMAS29 required 10 μm Mg2+ to grow in this assay. The uptake of 63Ni2+ (NEN Life Science Products) was assayed instead of Mg2+ uptake, as 28Mg2+ is prohibitively expensive and not readily available (19Snavely M.D. Gravina S.A. Cheung T.T. Miller C.G. Maguire M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 824-829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Methods for transport were as described previously (29Smith R.L. Szegedy M.A. Kucharski L.M.

Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4752-4760Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown overnight in LB with 100 mm MgSO4 and appropriate antibiotics. The MgSO4 concentration was 100 mm because the background strain MM281 requires high concentrations of Mg2+ for growth. Cells were washed twice in supplemented N-Min (without Mg2+) and resuspended in the same medium to 1–2 A 600 nm. Cells were added to tubes containing varying concentrations of inhibitor cation plus 200 μm NiCl2 and 1–1.2 μCi of63Ni2+ in a final volume of 1 ml. The reactions were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C, stopped by the addition of 5 ml of ice-cold N-Min containing 10 mm MgSO4 and 0.5 mm EDTA, filtered immediately on nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell), and washed once with 5 ml of the same solution. The filters were placed in a 3-ml Biosafe II scintillation mixture (Research Products International Corp., Mount Prospect, IL) and counted using a Beckman LS 6500 scintillation counter with 80% efficiency. Transport was assayed at 200 μm NiCl2, the approximate K m for wild type CorA (19Snavely M.D. Gravina S.A. Cheung T.T. Miller C.G. Maguire M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 824-829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If the affinity of a mutant for Ni2+ has decreased, the substrate concentration is no longer near the K m, and therefore the velocity attained will be a smaller fraction of theV max of the mutant. Unfortunately, the uptake values could not be corrected for affinity changes. As the Ni2+ dose-response curves were irregular for many mutants as described below, the Ni2+ affinity could not be determined accurately. Therefore, reported maximal uptake of each mutant (Table I) as a percentage of wild type CorA represents a minimum value.Table IProperties of CorA mutantsMutantGrowth on minimal mediumaGrowth on plates was the ability to grow on N-Min plates supplemented with leucine and glucose.

Open table in a new tab Inhibition of 63Ni2+ transport was determined for Ni2+, Mg2+, and Co2+. Inhibition curves are plotted as a percent of the maximal transport of the mutant, that is, the amount of 63Ni2+uptake at 200 μm NiCl2 with no competing cation present. These plots allow a visual determination of affinity changes, assuming a single cation binding site, and are independent of changes in uptake capacity. A change in affinity for Ni2+will also alter inhibition curves for Mg2+ and Co2+ because they are in turn inhibiting63Ni2+ transport. Because a mutation could affect the affinity of each cation differently, a brief delineation of possible changes is relevant. When Ni2+ is used to inhibit63Ni2+ uptake, a shift of the dose-response curve to the right would indicate a decrease in affinity for Ni2+, whereas a shift to the left would indicate an increase in affinity. For Co2+ or Mg2+inhibition of 63Ni2+ uptake, the shift in the dose-response curve is dependent upon the affinities of both Ni2+ and the inhibitory cation. We have never observed an increase in the affinity for Ni2+ with any mutant, so only three general patterns of affinity changes are likely for the cations assayed. First, if there is no change in affinity for either Ni2+ or the competing cation, there will be no shift in the dose-response curves. Second, if the affinity for Ni2+ does not change and that for the competing cation decreases, the Ni2+ inhibition curve remains the same and the competing inhibition curve of the cation shifts to the right. If the affinity for Ni2+ remains the same and that for the competing cation increases, there will be a shift to the left in the dose-response curve of that cation. Third, if the affinity for Ni2+ is decreased, there would be a shift to the right in the Ni2+dose-response curve. If the affinity for Ni2+ is decreased and the affinity for the competing cation remains the same as the wild type, the dose response curve of the competing cation will exhibit a shift to the left. However, if the affinity for the competing cation also decreases, the dose response curve of the competing cation may demonstrate a shift to the right, a slight shift to the left, or no apparent shift depending on the relative extent of the affinity change for the two cations. If the affinity for CorA of the competing cation increases, it will exhibit a significant left shift. These interpretations assume that there is a single binding site. If there is more than one cation binding site, the kinetics of transport become more complex than the interpretations described above, unless mutations affect each site similarly. The assay used for K m and V max studies was similar to the dose-response curve transport protocol above. The uptake of Ni2+ was assayed over a concentration range of 8 μm to 1 mm NiCl2. The final concentrations of 63Ni2+ were 8–88 μCi/μmol NiCl2. Each Ni2+ concentration was assayed in triplicate, and blanks with 10 mmMgSO4 were subtracted for each individual Ni2+concentration. The residues selected for mutagenesis studies were based on conserved and hydroxyl-bearing residues from the alignment shown in Fig. 1 and from additional alignments using other CorA homologues (21Kehres D. Lawyer C.H. Maguire M.E. Microbial Comp. Genomics. 1998; 43: 151-169Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The expression of the CorA mutants was determined by Western blot analysis of isolated membranes. All mutants were expressed to a similar extent as wild type CorA (Fig. 2). The S260A, S260V, S263A, and F266A mutants exhibited slightly altered migration. These mutants were therefore completely sequenced, and none contained secondary mutations. The S260V mutant in particular migrated at a significantly lower apparent molecular mass. This suggests that the S260V mutant may be less stable than wild type CorA, possibly being proteolytically cleaved at the carboxyl terminus during membrane isolation. With many of the TM2 mutants assayed, Ni2+inhibition of 63Ni2+ transport curves demonstrated an increase in uptake with increasing Ni2+concentration even though the 63Ni2+ specific activity was simultaneously decreasing (Fig. 3). This phenomenon will be referred to as an “induction” of transport. This induction was also seen for some Co2+ inhibition curves but to a smaller extent. Very few Mg2+ inhibition curves displayed induction, and this was also to a much smaller extent, such as that shown for the F266Y mutant (Fig. 4). This difference between the three cations is likely because of their relative affinities. Ni2+ has the lowest affinity at approximately 200 μm, whereas Co2+ and Mg2+ have affinities of 30 and 15 μm, respectively. Therefore the affinities of Co2+ and Mg2+ would have to be drastically altered to see induction with the addition of micromolar quantities of Co2+ or Mg2+. Conversely, the affinity of Ni2+ is sufficiently low to allow changes in affinity to demonstrate the induction at micromolar levels of added Ni2+.FIG. 4Mg2+ inhibition of63Ni2+ uptake for the P269A, F266A, and F266Y mutants. Transport was performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” Curves are normalized to the maximal uptake of each mutant. These data are the average of a minimum of three separate uptake experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Induction of Ni2+ uptake was displayed for all TM2 mutants except S263A and S275A. The F266Y, P269A, S274A, and S274T mutants demonstrated the largest induction, each reaching approximately 140% of maximal uptake defined at 200 μm Ni2+. The peak of induction for most mutants was at approximately 300 μm added NiCl2, corresponding to a total Ni2+ concentration of 500 μm. Exceptions were the S274A and S274T mutants, which had a peak of induction with 1 mm added Ni2+, corresponding to a total of 1.2 mm Ni2+. Such induction may be indicative of cooperativity as has been shown with a Na+, K+-ATPase mutant (33Tepperman K. Millette L.A. Johnson C.L. Jewell-Motz E.A. Lingrel J.B. Wallick E.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C2065-C2079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate this possibility,63Ni2+ uptake at varying concentrations of NiCl2 was determined for wild type CorA and one of the mutants. This experiment is different from the Ni2+inhibition curves because there was a greater range of Ni2+concentration, and the specific activity of the isotope was maintained. The P268A mutant was chosen for this assay because it maintained a significant amount of uptake, had a normal growth phenotype, yet demonstrated the Ni2+ induction. The P268A mutant had a 5-fold shift in the Ni2+ and a 4-fold shift for Co2+ dose-response curves with no shift in the Mg2+ dose-response curve. The velocity versussubstrate concentration curve was sigmoidal for both wild type CorA and the P268A mutant (Fig. 5), consistent with positive cooperativity. The V max and Hill coefficient were estimated using a least square fit. The estimate ofV max is 1800 pmol/A 600 nm/min for wild type and 935 pmol/A 600 nm/min for the P268A mutant. The n Hvalues are 2.5 for the control and 2.0 for the mutant. Therefore, CorA may contain two or more binding sites for Mg2+, and the mutants alter the binding properties of these sites. When Ni2+ inhibition for several alanine mutants was assayed with 500 μm NiCl2, rather than 200 μm NiCl2, the induction was either diminished or eliminated altogether (data not shown). Consequently, the induction effect is revealed by the decreased affinity of the mutated CorAs for Ni2+. Although the kinetics of transport are more complex than simple inhibition, the dose-response curves are nonetheless appropriate for determining relative affinity changes for the mutants, because all other data follow the wild type simple inhibition curve because the affinities of the different binding sites appear to be altered to a similar extent. The S260A and S260T mutants displayed an unusual affinity profile for the cations tested, suggesting that Ser260 plays a role in cation selectivity. Both mutants maintained significant amounts of 63Ni2+ uptake and displayed normal growth. However, both mutants also displayed a shift to the left of 4–5-fold in the Mg2+ dose-response curve as shown in Fig. 6. No other CorA mutants to date have demonstrated such a left shift. Co2+inhibition was similar to wild type, and Ni2+ inhibition displayed 10- and 3-fold shifts to the right for the S260A and S260T mutants, respectively (data not shown). This is in contrast to the behavior seen with other CorA mutants, where the dose-response curves for all three cations shifted in the same direction. The S260V mutant had no measurable transport. However, it was functional because it required only 50 μmMg2+ to grow in supplemented N-Min medium, as shown in Table I. The increased Mg2+requirement could be related to the decreased stability of the S260V mutant as noted above. Alternatively, this may be because of a slight decrease in affinity for Mg2+ with a severely decreased affinity for Ni2+, causing no measurable63Ni2+ transport. The latter seems more likely because it correlates with the properties of other Ser260mutants. Thus, Ser260 is likely involved in cation selectivity, but the hydroxyl moiety is not essential. For the Thr270 mutants constructed, as the size of the side chain increased, both transport capacity and affinity for cation also increased. The T270A mutant had no measurable transport activity. The T270C mutant had 4% of wild type uptake, a greater than 5-fold shift in the Mg2+ dose-response curve (Fig. 7) and a 10-fold shift to the right in the Ni2+ inhibition curve (data not shown), indicating significant decreases in affinity for both Mg2+ and Ni2+. The T270S mutant, which maintains the hydroxyl moiety, had 17% of wild type uptake and demonstrated a smaller shift to the right in the Mg2+ dose-response curve of about 3–4-fold (Fig. 7). The shift for Ni2+ inhibition was also moderate at 3-fold (data not shown). The T270V mutant, which maintains the relative size of the residue while eliminating the hydroxyl group, maintained 35% of wild type ion uptake and had a minimal shift to the right in both Mg2+ and Ni2+ dose-response curves. All three mutants appeared to have the same 5-fold shift to the right for Co2+ (data not shown). The growth data indicated that all Thr270 mutants, including T270A, were functional because they all complemented MM281. The T270A mutant required 50 μm Mg2+ to grow, whereas the T270C, T270S, and T270V mutants required only 10 μm Mg2+, the same as wild type. Thus, the T270V mutant maintained the greatest amount of CorA function of all the mutants made at this residue. Valine best approximates the size of threonine but is hydrophobic. This suggests that the size of the residue at Thr270 is more important for transport than the hydroxyl group. All mutations at Ser274 displayed considerably decreased cation affinity and decreased transport capacity. S274A and S274T mutants maintained measurable cation transport, whereas the S274C and S274V mutants had no measurable ion uptake. The S274A mutant had only 5% of wild type transport and demonstrated an asymmetric shift to the right for the Mg2+dose-response curve that reached about 10-fold at high Mg2+concentrations (Fig. 8). This was the only mutant that exhibited this behavior. Both Ni2+ and Co2+ gave a greater than 10-fold shift to the right for the S274A mutants (data not shown). The Ni2+ and Co2+ inhibition curves of the S274A mutant displayed an even shift throughout the curve and did not reflect the asymmetric Mg2+ inhibition curv"

The present knowledge is based essentially on in situ labeling with45Ca (4Colca J.R. Kotagal N. Lacy P.E. McDaniel M.L. Biochim. Biophys.

A problem when interpreting these data is that the preparations include cells other than normal beta cells and that the permeabilization is difficult to control in islets and suspensions of cells. An alternative to these techniques is to measure organelle Ca2+ directly. Maechler et al.(13Maechler P. Kennedy E.D. Sebö E. Valeva A. Pozzan T. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12583-12592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) recently performed such measurements in clonal INS-1 cells specifically expressing the Ca2+-sensitive photoprotein aequorin in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).1 It is possible to study organelle Ca2+ in normal cells with fluorescent indicators introduced as membrane-permeable acetoxymethyl esters (14Hofer A.M. Machen T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2598-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 15Hajnóczky G. Thomas A.P.

Taking advantage of the latter approach we recently reported that the low affinity indicator furaptra can be used to monitor organelle Ca2+ in individual pancreatic beta cells after controlled permeabilization of the plasma membrane (17Tengholm A. Hagman C. Gylfe E. Hellman B. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1224-1230PubMed Google Scholar). Glucose, the major natural stimulator of insulin release, has profound effects on the beta cell handling of Ca2+ (18Hellman B. Gylfe E. Wesslén N. Biochem. Int. 1986; 13: 383-389PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hellman B. Gylfe E. Grapengiesser E. Lund P.-E. Marcström A. Flatt P.R. Nutrient Regulation of Insulin Secretion. Portland Press, London1992: 213-246Google Scholar). Early studies with 45Ca indicated that glucose, in addition to stimulating the entry of Ca2+ into the beta cells, promotes the sequestration of the ion in an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate- (IP3) sensitive pool (18Hellman B. Gylfe E. Wesslén N. Biochem. Int. 1986; 13: 383-389PubMed Google Scholar). Because Ca2+accumulation in the ER is required both for Ca2+homeostasis of the beta cell (20Worley III, J.F. McIntyre M.S.

J. 1997; 323: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), it is important to explore whether sequestration of this ion is actively regulated by ATP produced during glucose metabolism (2Hellman B. Gylfe E. Cheung W.E. Calcium and Cell Function. Academic Press, Orlando1986: 253-326Crossref Google Scholar) or simply reflects the elevation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ (13Maechler P. Kennedy E.D. Sebö E.

Using the furaptra approach we now demonstrate that glucose is an efficient stimulator of Ca2+ uptake in the ER of the pancreatic beta cell both by increasing ATP and cytoplasmic Ca2+. Reagents of analytical grade and deionized water were used. The acetoxymethyl ester of the Ca2+ indicator furaptra, the heavy metal chelatorN,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN), thapsigargin, and IP3 were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR); and the acetoxymethyl ester of the Ca2+ indicator Fura-2FF was from TefLabs (Austin, TX). Roche Molecular Biochemicals provided collagenase, HEPES, and ATP, and Calbiochem supplied digitonin. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) sodium salt solution in chloroform:methanol:water (20:9:1) was from Lipid Products (Redhill, UK). The Ca2+chelators EGTA, N-(2-hydroxyethyl)ethylenediaminetriacetic acid, and nitrilotriacetic acid as well as oligomycin were obtained from Sigma. Diazoxide and heparin were kind gifts from Schering (Kenilworth, NJ) and Løvens kemiske fabrik (Ballerup, Denmark), respectively. Unless otherwise stated, intact cells were exposed to a medium containing: 125 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.3 mm CaCl2, and 25 mm HEPES with the pH adjusted to 7.40 with NaOH. Permeabilized cells were superfused with an “intracellular” medium containing: 140 mm KCl, 0–10 mmNa2ATP, and 10 mm HEPES with the pH adjusted to 7.00 with KOH. During changes of the ATP concentration free Mg2+ was maintained at 0.1 mm. Free Ca2+ was buffered to 50 nm−500 μm with 2 mm EGTA,N-(2-hydroxyethyl)ethylenediaminetriacetic acid, or nitrilotriacetic acid, as indicated in the figure legends. The ion concentrations were calculated using the Maxchelator program (24Bers D.M. Patton C.W. Nuccitelli R. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). To prepare PIP2 solutions the solvent was first evaporated by flushing with N2. Medium was then added, and PIP2 was dispersed by a 30-min sonication on ice. To prevent contamination of the superfusion system (see below), PIP2-containing solutions were added directly to the experimental chamber. Islets of Langerhans were isolated from the splenic part of the pancreas of adultob/ob mice taken from a non-inbred colony (25Hellman B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1965; 131: 541-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Single cells were prepared by shaking the islets in a Ca2+-deficient medium (26Lernmark Å. Diabetologia. 1974; 10: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). After suspension in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 30 μg/ml gentamicin, the cells were allowed to attach to circular cover glasses during culture for 1–5 days at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in humidified air. The ob/ob mouse islets contain more than 90% beta cells (25Hellman B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1965; 131: 541-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Non-beta cells were avoided by selecting cells with large size and low nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio for analyses (27Berts A. Gylfe E. Hellman B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 644-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In most experiments the cells were loaded with furaptra during a 60-min incubation at 37 °C with 4 μmof its acetoxymethyl ester added to the extracellular medium containing 3 mm glucose. In some experiments the cells were instead loaded with Fura-2FF using an analogous protocol. After rinsing, the cover glasses with the attached cells were used as exchangeable bottoms of an open superfusion chamber thermostated at 37 °C. The plasma membrane was permeabilized in intracellular medium supplemented with 4 μm digitonin during simultaneous measurements of the fluorescence obtained by excitation at 340 and 380 nm (17Tengholm A. Hagman C. Gylfe E. Hellman B. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1224-1230PubMed Google Scholar). The detergent was immediately removed when there was a sudden drop in fluorescence caused by the loss of cytoplasmic furaptra. The effect of glucose on organelle Ca2+ was tested by 0–20 mm of the sugar in the loading medium together with 400 μm diazoxide, which hyperpolarizes the beta cells by activating the ATP-dependent K+(K ATP) channels (28Trube G. Rorsman P. Ohno-Shosaku T. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1986; 407: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). In this case the cells were rinsed with indicator-free extracellular medium containing 50 nm Ca2+ and the same concentrations of glucose and diazoxide. Subsequent permeabilization was performed with maintenance of the glucose concentration in intracellular medium containing 4 μm digitonin. Investigating the influence of elevated cytoplasmic Ca2+, loading was performed with the beta cells depolarized with 30.9 mm K+ in the presence of 400 μm diazoxide and 3 mmglucose, followed by rinsing in the same medium lacking indicator. The permeabilization with 4 μm digitonin was made in intracellular medium containing the same concentration of glucose and 1 μm Ca2+. Intracellular medium containing 50 nm Ca2+ but lacking digitonin and glucose was introduced immediately upon permeabilization. Organelle free Ca2+ was measured with a dual wavelength microfluorometric system (Deltascan, Photon Technology International Inc, Princeton, NJ). The excitation light was alternately directed to two monochromators by a chopper mirror spinning at 50 Hz. The monochromator outputs were connected via a bifurcated optical fiber to the epifluorescence attachment of an inverted microscope (Nikon Diaphot) equipped with a 100x objective (numerical aperture 1.3). Fluorescence was recorded at 535 nm with a photomultiplier using a 25-nm half-bandwidth interference filter. The background-subtracted signals, obtained by excitation at 340 and 380 nm, were recorded at 2 Hz using the FeliX™ software (Photon Technology International). The distribution of furaptra and Ca2+ among subcellular compartments was assessed by imaging single beta cells at 510 nm with an intensified CCD camera (Extended ISIS-M, Photonic Science, Robertsbridge, UK). A 75-watt xenon arc lamp and 10–13-nm half-bandwidth interference filters were used for excitation at 340 and 380 nm. The excitation filter changer was part of a Magiscan image analysis system (VisiTech International, Sunderland, UK). Images, consisting of 64 averaged video frames, were captured every 3.1 s using the Tardis program (VisiTech International). All images were corrected for background before calculation of the 340/380 nm fluorescence excitation ratios. Furaptra has been reported to have K D values for Ca2+ and Mg2+ binding corresponding to 53 μm and 1.5 mm, respectively (29Raju B. Murphy E. Levy L.A. Hall R.D. London R.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C540-C548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These affinities are convenient for monitoring cytoplasmic Mg2+, and such studies have been performed also in pancreatic beta cells (30Gylfe E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1055: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Using furaptra for measurements of Ca2+ in beta cell organelles, it is therefore important to consider interference from Mg2+. Although we have previously demonstrated that variations in Mg2+ do not affect the measurements (17Tengholm A. Hagman C. Gylfe E. Hellman B. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1224-1230PubMed Google Scholar), it cannot be excluded that there is a small background contribution of this ion. Because the K D values for furaptra depend strongly on the experimental conditions, the concentrations of organelle Ca2+ are presented as the 340/380 nm fluorescence excitation ratios. To get a rough estimate of the actual organelle concentration of Ca2+ we performed titrations by exposing the permeabilized beta cell to increasing concentrations of the ion in the presence of the equilibrating ionophore Br-A23187. Fig. 1illustrates the permeabilization procedure and a subsequent Ca2+ titration using the digital imaging technique. Beta cells loaded with furaptra exhibited a diffuse Ca2+-independent cytoplasmic fluorescence when excited at 340 nm with the brightest signal from the nucleus (Fig. 1 A). After permeabilization with 4 μm digitonin in the presence of 200 nm Ca2+ and 3 mmATP there was a marked loss of the 340-nm excitation signal from the cytoplasm and nucleus with a significant amount of fluorescence remaining in cellular organelles (Fig. 1 B). In the permeabilized cell the furaptra 340/380-nm fluorescence excitation ratio displayed regional differences (Fig. 1 C). The highest ratios corresponded to a Ca2+ concentration of almost 500 μm, as indicated from Ca2+ titration in the presence of the equilibrating ionophore Br-A23187 (Fig. 1). It is evident that the furaptra is not Ca2+ saturated even in the compartments with the highest concentrations of the ion. In a medium containing Br-A23187 the presence of 3 mmMn2+ resulted in quenching of 94 ± 2% (n = 5) of the fluorescence excited at 340 nm (not shown), indicating almost complete hydrolysis of the indicator ester. In the absence of Mn2+ there was no evidence for heavy metal interference with the measurements. At a concentration of 20 μm the membrane-permeable heavy metal chelator TPEN lacked detectable effects on the 340/380-nm fluorescence excitation ratio (Fig. 2). Higher concentrations of TPEN (200–1200 μm) induced a concentration-dependent linear reduction of the fluorescence excitation ratio (r = 0.99;p < 0.001; n = 4), consistent with its low affinity binding of Ca2+ (31Hofer A.M. Fasolato C. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Although the control experiments with furaptra indicated that measurements of organelle Ca2+ could be performed without interference from Mg2+ or heavy metal ions, we also tested whether the more Ca2+-specific indicator Fura-2FF could be used. Unfortunately, Fura-2FF loaded poorly with little fluorescence remaining after digitonin permeabilization. This problem was aggravated by substantial leakage of the indicator. Titration experiments, like those in Fig. 1, indicated that Fura-2FF in organelles reacted to Ca2+ concentrations as low as 100 nm and became almost saturated at 50 μm of the ion (not shown). Because Fura-2FF was inferior to furaptra for measurements of Ca2+in beta cell organelles, subsequent measurements were performed with the latter indicator. It has been reported that IP3-induced release of Ca2+ in permeabilized hepatocytes loaded with Fura-2FF is followed by a rapid mitochondrial uptake of some of this Ca2+, affecting the kinetics of the release process (32Hajnóczky G. Hager R. Thomas A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14157-14162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). However, these authors did not observe such an effect with Ca2+-buffered medium or maximally effective concentrations of IP3, as used in the present study. It is therefore unlikely that mitochondria affect Ca2+ release from the ER in our experiments. We have previously observed that the steady-state organelle Ca2+ detected by furaptra in permeabilized beta cells is influenced little by agents affecting mitochondrial function (17Tengholm A. Hagman C. Gylfe E. Hellman B. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1224-1230PubMed Google Scholar). The Ca2+ concentration in the mitochondrial matrix has been reported to be much lower in insulin-releasing cells (33Kennedy E.D. Rizzuto R. Theler J.M. Pralong W.F. Bastianutto C. Pozzan T. Wollheim C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2524-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 34Maechler P. Kennedy E.D. Wang H. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol.

Accordingly, mitochondrial furaptra can be expected to have a minimal influence on the observed variations in Ca2+ signal. Results are expressed as mean values ± S.E. Differences were statistically evaluated by a two-tailed Student's t test. The SigmaStat software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used for regression analyses. Exponential curve fits and illustrations were made with the Igor Pro software (Wavemetrics Inc., Lake Oswego, OR). To investigate the effect of glucose on organelle Ca2+, intact beta cells were loaded with furaptra in medium containing 0–20 mm of the sugar under hyperpolarizing conditions (exposure to 400 μm diazoxide). When the cells were permeabilized in an ATP-free medium containing 50 nmCa2+, there was a prompt increase of the furaptra fluorescence ratio followed by gradual decay. This decay, reflecting emptying of the organelle pool, started from a level strongly dependent on the glucose concentration. Fig. 3shows experiments with beta cells maintained in medium lacking (A) or containing 7 (B) and 20 (C) mm glucose. In the absence of glucose there was only a tiny increase of the furaptra fluorescence ratio upon permeabilization, whereas in the presence of 7 and 20 mm of the sugar the magnitudes of the increase and following decay were more pronounced. Fitting the decay to exponential functions there was no evidence for the involvement of more than one component. The time constant observed in the presence of 20 mm glucose was 139 ± 28 s (n = 10). After depletion of organelle Ca2+the introduction of 3 mm ATP resulted in a rapid refilling with a fluorescence ratio reaching similar levels as observed upon permeabilization in the presence of 20 mm glucose (C). Subsequent addition of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) inhibitor thapsigargin or omission of ATP (not shown) resulted in a simple exponential decay as the organelle pool was emptied. Despite variations between experiments the time constants for decay of glucose- and ATP-incorporated organelle Ca2+ did not differ within experiments, the changes being 2 ± 15 s (n = 5, thapsigargin addition) and −2 ± 15 s (n = 5, ATP omission) between the first and second decay. Oligomycin (2 μg/ml) completely prevented the effect of glucose on organelle Ca2+ without interfering with the action of ATP after permeabilization (not shown). The glucose dependence of the Ca2+ accumulation in the beta cell organelles is summarized in Fig. 4. The filling observed immediately upon permeabilization after pre-exposure to different glucose concentrations is expressed in percent of the uptake subsequently reached with 3 mm ATP. Subtracting the glucose-independent accumulation, the data fitted a hyperbolic function (r = 0.905, p < 0.001) with half-maximal effect at 5.5 mm. In accordance with the organelle Ca2+ pool being filled during exposure to 20 mm glucose, subsequent beta cell permeabilization in the presence of 3 mm ATP resulted in an instant increase of the furaptra fluorescence ratio with no further change (not shown).FIG. 4Dependence of organelle Ca2+ on glucose concentration. The filling of the organelle Ca2+ pool immediately upon permeabilization is expressed as the percent of the filling reached after the subsequent addition of 3 mm ATP, as illustrated in Fig. 2, and plotted as a function of the glucose concentration. The solid line shows a fit of 31 individual data points to a hyperbolic function plus a constant representing glucose-independent uptake (r = 0.905,p < 0.001). Data are mean values ± S.E. for six to seven experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Testing the effect of an elevated cytoplasmic Ca2+concentration on organelle uptake of the ion, the cells were depolarized with 30.9 mm K+ in the presence of 400 μm diazoxide and 3 mm glucose during the furaptra loading and the subsequent rinsing. The exposure to digitonin was then made in intracellular medium containing 1 μmCa2+ to prevent depletion of the organelles. By lowering Ca2+ to 50 nm immediately upon permeabilization it became possible to study the kinetics of Ca2+disappearance from the organelles under similar conditions as in the glucose experiments. Fig. 5 Ashows that permeabilization results in a prominent peak of the furaptra fluorescence ratio followed by gradual decay. The peak was more pronounced than expected from the prevailing glucose concentration (3 mm) corresponding to 75 ± 5% (n = 10, p < 0.01) of the level subsequently reached with 3 mm ATP. Also in this case the early decay followed similar monoexponetial kinetics as observed when omitting ATP at the end of the experiments. Like the effect of glucose on organelle uptake of Ca2+, that of K+ depolarization was prevented by oligomycin (Fig. 5 B). The ATP sensitivity of the uptake process was studied in a medium containing 50 or 200 nm Ca2+. After initial depletion of organelle Ca2+ in an ATP-free medium, introduction of 1 μm-1 mm ATP resulted in concentration-dependent reuptake of the ion. In the presence of 50 nm Ca2+ more than 10 μm ATP was required for uptake of Ca2+ (Fig. 6 A), whereas there was a considerable uptake at 1 μm ATP with 200 nmCa2+ (Fig. 6 B). Nevertheless, the maximal concentrations of organelle Ca2+ reached with 1 mm ATP were similar at 50 and 200 nmCa2+, corresponding to 2.21 ± 0.32 (n= 6) and 2.56 ± 0.34 (n = 9) ratio units, respectively. Further elevation of ATP to 10 mm resulted in a small decrease of the fluorescence excitation ratio at both Ca2+ concentrations. In the next series of experiments the effect of Ca2+ was tested, keeping ATP constant at 3 μm or 3 mm. In the presence of 3 μm ATP, there was little uptake of Ca2+ at 50 nm of the ion (Fig. 7 A). Further elevations of Ca2+ to 200 nm-5 μm resulted in concentration-dependent increases of organelle Ca2+. During exposure to 3 mm ATP there was a pronounced increase of organelle Ca2+ already at 50 nm Ca2+ with no further effect during gradual elevations of Ca2+ to 5 μm (Fig. 7 B). The effects of Ca2+ and ATP on the organelle Ca2+ stores are summarized in Fig. 8. Half-maximal uptake of organelle Ca2+ was reached at concentrations of ATP estimated to 45 and 3.5 μm at 50 and 200 nm Ca2+, respectively (Fig. 8 A). Whereas half-maximal uptake of Ca2+ was obtained at less than 50 nm in the presence of 3 mm ATP, about 230 nmCa2+ was required at 3 μm ATP (Fig. 8 B). When tested with 50 nm Ca2+ in the absence and presence of half-saturating concentrations of ATP (45 μm), 2–5 mm glucose 6-phosphate had no effect on organelle Ca2+ (not shown).FIG. 8Dependence of organelle Ca2+ on ATP and Ca2+. Organelle Ca2+ is plotted as a function of the ATP (A) or Ca2+ concentrations (B). The fluorescence excitation ratios are expressed relative to the values observed at 1 mm ATP (A) and 5 μm Ca2+ (B). Data are mean values ± S.E. for six (○), nine (●), six (▴), and eight (▵) experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Most of the organelle Ca2+ in beta cells permeabilized during exposure to 3 mm ATP and 200 nmCa2+ was released when the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase was inhibited with thapsigargin (Fig. 9 A). During subsequent exposure to the Ca2+ ionophore Br-A23187 the additional release was less than 10%. The thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+could be divided into pools sensitive or not to IP3 (Fig. 9 B). Maximally effective concentrations of IP3(10 μm) thus released 64 ± 4% (n = 7) of the Ca2+ sensitive to thapsigargin. The fraction of IP3-sensitive Ca2+ was somewhat lower when the Ca2+ stores had been refilled after permeabilization during Ca2+-depleting conditions (ATP- or Ca2+-deficient medium). Fig. 10 illustrates such experiments, testing the effect of IP3 at different filling states of the thapsigargin-sensitive store. In the presence of 200 nmCa2+ and 3 μm ATP the depleted stores refilled to 47 ± 7% (n = 14, Fig. 10). In this situation IP3 released 44 ± 4% (n = 14) of the thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+. After subsequent maximal filling of the stores by combining 200 nmCa2+ with 3 mm ATP (Fig. 10 A) or 1 μm Ca2+ with 3 μm ATP (Fig. 10 B) the IP3-sensitive fractions did not change significantly (38 ± 4%, n = 9 and 54 ± 8%, n = 5, respectively).FIG. 10Effects of IP3 on organelle Ca2+ in individual beta cells. The furaptra-loaded cells were permeabilized with 4 μm digitonin in an ATP-free medium with 200 nm Ca2+ (A) or a Ca2+-deficient medium containing 2 mm EGTA and 3 μm ATP (B). IP3 (10 μm), thapsigargin (TH, 200 nm), and higher concentrations of ATP or Ca2+ buffered with EGTA were introduced as indicated. The fractions of Ca2+sensitive to IP3 and thapsigargin are indicated byi and t, respectively.

Most of these experiments were performed at 50 nm Ca2+to approximate the situation in unstimulated beta cells. In the presence of 45 μm ATP, which half-maximally fills the Ca2+ stores (Fig. 8), 5 μm PIP2was found to release 7"
https://openalex.org/W2043892597,"The vesicle-associated membrane proteins (Vamp(s)) function as soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor proteins in the intracellular trafficking of vesicles. The membrane attachment of Vamps requires a carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic sequence termed an insertion sequence. Unlike other insertion sequence-containing proteins, targeting of the highly homologous Vamp1 and Vamp2 to the endoplasmic reticulum requires ATP and a membrane-bound receptor. To determine if this mechanism of targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum extends to other Vamps, we compared the membrane binding of Vamp1 and Vamp2 with the distantly related Vamp8. Similar to the other Vamps, Vamp8 requires both ATP and a membrane component to target to the endoplasmic reticulum. Furthermore, binding curves for the three Vamps overlap, suggesting a common receptor-mediated process. We identified a minimal endoplasmic reticulum targeting domain that is both necessary and sufficient to confer receptor-mediated, ATP-dependent, binding of a heterologous protein to microsomes. Surprisingly, this conserved sequence includes four positively charged amino acids spaced along an amphipathic sequence, which unlike the carboxyl-terminal targeting sequence in mitochondrial Vamp isoforms, is amino-terminal to the insertion sequence. Because Vamps do not bind to phospholipid vesicles, it is likely that these residues mediate an interaction with a protein, rather than bind to acidic phospholipids. Therefore, we suggest that a bipartite motif is required for the specific targeting and integration of Vamps into the endoplasmic reticulum with receptor-mediated recognition of specifically configured positive residues leading to the insertion of the hydrophobic tail into the membrane.

Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 73-75Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Recently, progress has been made in the understanding of the subsequent subcellular trafficking of some of these proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 to synaptic vesicles and the Golgi. The synaptic vesicle targeting of vesicleassociated membrane proteins (Vamps) is mediated by a region that is distal to the insertion sequence (2Grote E. Hao J.C. Bennett M.K. Kelly R.B. Cell. 1995; 81: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In contrast, the signal for trafficking to the Golgi of Sed5p is related to the length of the hydrophobic segment as sequences that are 4–5 amino acids longer exit the ER (3Pedrazzini E. Villa A. Borgese N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4207-4212Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 4Rayner J.C. Pelham H.R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 29043-29051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, regardless of the final destination of the protein, it is postulated that the hydrophobic sequence provides the thermodynamic driving force for initial integration into the ER membrane. Consistent with this model, many variations are tolerated within the hydrophobic core sequence (6Whitley P. Grahn E. Kutay U. Rapoport T.A. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7583-7586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The recent cloning of separate isoforms of cytochromeb5 (7De Silvestris M. D'Arrigo A. Borgese N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and Vamp1 (8Isenmann S. Khew-Goodall Y. Gamble J. Vadas M. Wattenberg B.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1649-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) that are targeted to either ER or mitochondria has led to the identification of the last 9 or 5 amino acids, respectively, as critical for targeting. The results of sequence swapping and mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that at least two positive charges near the carboxyl terminus are essential for insertion into the cytoplasmic face of the outer mitochondrial membrane (7De Silvestris M. D'Arrigo A. Borgese N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 8Isenmann S. Khew-Goodall Y. Gamble J. Vadas M. Wattenberg B.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1649-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It remains to be definitively shown whether mitochondrial targeting by these sequences is an active process (i.e. the sequence alterations specify mitochondrial localization) or if the endoplasmic reticulum forms contain a sequence that prevents mitochondrial localization and that must be altered for more promiscuous targeting. The original studies on the mechanism of the cytochromeb5 (Cb5) insertion sequence-mediated protein targeting suggested that the integration step was spontaneous, promiscuous, and nonsaturable (9Anderson D.J. Mostov K.E. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7249-7253Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 10Takagaki Y. Radhakrishnan R. Wirtz K.W. Khorana H.G. J. Biol.

However, we have demonstrated that there are at least two distinct mechanisms for integration into membranes (14Kim P.K. Janiak-Spens F. Trimble W.S. Leber B. Andrews D.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8873-8882Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Vamp1 is the best studied example of a protein for which membrane integration is receptor-mediated (6Whitley P. Grahn E.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Vamp1 is a member of a family of proteins that currently includes eight members (16Bock J.B. Scheller R.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 133-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Vamps 1 and 2 function as solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors in the intracellular trafficking of vesicles (14Kim P.K. Janiak-Spens F. Trimble W.S. Leber B. Andrews D.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8873-8882Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 15Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilger G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Both Vamps 1 and 2 require ATP and a membrane-bound receptor to target to the ER (14Kim P.K. Janiak-Spens F. Trimble W.S. Leber B. Andrews D.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8873-8882Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 15Kutay U. Ahnert-Hilger G. Hartmann E. Wiedenmann B. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) by a process in which targeting and integration appear to occur simultaneously. Once integrated into the ER membrane, Vamps 1 and 2 are sorted to secretory vesicles and the plasma membrane. To elucidate the mechanism of targeting of Vamp proteins to the ER membrane, we have compared the membrane binding characteristics of distantly related members of the Vamp family (Vamps1 and -2 compared with Vamp8) and identified the sequence that specifies localization to the endoplasmic reticulum. Surprisingly the sequence necessary for targeting in all three Vamps includes four positively charged amino acids spaced along one side of an amphipathic sequence that is amino-terminal to the hydrophobic region. Our results also indicate that there is a common mechanism and probably a single receptor used to target different Vamps to the ER. Construction of a plasmid expressing Vamp1 (GenBankTM accession no. AAA42322) was described previously (14Kim P.K. Janiak-Spens F. Trimble W.S. Leber B. Andrews D.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8873-8882Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Vamp2 (GenBankTM accession no. AAA42321) and Vamp8 (GenBankTM accession no. T63214) cDNA sequences were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from rat and human cDNA, respectively, and inserted into pBluescript KS-. For in vitro transcription/translation, the protein coding sequences were cloned into pSPUTK, a plasmid that contains both a SP6 promoter and a high efficiency 5′-untranslated region for translation in reticulocyte lysate (17Falcone D. Andrews D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2656-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Vamp2 and Vamp8 were subcloned into pSPUTK by PCR. Primer sequences are available from the authors upon request. In vitro and in vivo gPA behaves as a cytosolic protein but can be targeted to different intracellular membranes when fused to appropriate targeting sequences (18Janiak F. Glover J.R. Leber B. Rachubinski R.A. Andrews D.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Gene fusions for gPA and either Vamp2 or Vamp8 were constructed using a unique BamHI site near the 3′-end of the coding region of gPA and a XhoI site 3′ of the gPA termination codon. The required sequences were added to the coding regions of Vamp2 and Vamp8 by PCR amplification. Amino-terminal deletions of the Vamp2 coding sequence in gPAVamp2 were constructed using a whole plasmid PCR method as described (19Hughes M.J. Andrews D.W. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 192-196Google Scholar) except that PCR was performed using a 40:1 ratio of Taq (MBI, Fermentas) and Vent (New England Biolabs) DNA polymerases. To construct a plasmid encoding gPAVamp2-(96–116), the plasmid encoding gPAVamp2 was prepared from GM48 cells and cut with BclI (within the Vamp2 coding region) and BamHI (near the carboxyl end of gPA) restriction endonucleases, and then the plasmid was reclosed by ligation. Plasmids encoding point mutations were generated by cassette mutagenesis using internal BclI and EcoRI sites. For random mutants the oligonucleotides were synthesized with multiple nucleotides added at the appropriate steps in the synthesis reaction (Mobix Central Facility, McMaster University, Ontario, Canada). The relevant regions of all of the plasmids were sequenced to ensure that additional mutations were not introduced during amplification or cloning. Plasmids and complete construction details are available from the authors. Canine pancreatic ER membranes (microsomes) were prepared as described by Walter and Blobel (20Walter P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Each batch of microsomes was tested for cotranslational translocation of preprolactin (21Andrews D.W. Lauffer L.

Phospholipid vesicles (7:8:1:4 phosphatidylcholine:phosphatidylethanolamine:phosphatidylserine:cholesterol) were prepared by extrusion in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5 (24Hope M.J. Bally M.B. Webb G. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar). In vitro transcription and translation were performed as described previously (21Andrews D.W. Lauffer L. Walter P. Lingappa V.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 797-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). After a 60-min incubation at 24 °C, the translation reaction was stopped by adding cycloheximide to a final concentration of 20 μg/ml. ATP was then removed from the translation reaction by incubation with 5 units of apyrase (Sigma) at 24 °C for 30 min. Nucleotides and other small molecules were removed by passing the reaction though a 600 μl Sephadex G-25 (Sigma) spin column. ATP was added to the G-25 treated translation reaction by adding a solution containing 100 mm ATP, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, to a final concentration of 0.50 mmATP. The membrane binding assay has been described previously (14Kim P.K. Janiak-Spens F. Trimble W.S. Leber B. Andrews D.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8873-8882Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting with calreticulin of a parallel reaction fractionated similarly demonstrated that the microsomes remained sealed throughout the procedure. Mitochondria and lysosome binding assays were performed similarly with the following modifications. Mitochondria were pelleted at 17,000 × g in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was washed once with translation buffer (50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Lysosomes were pelleted through a 0.5 m sucrose cushion by centrifugation at 39,000 × g in a TLA100 rotor (Beckman). Volumes of each fraction corresponding to equivalent amounts of the original translation reaction were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a Tris-Tricine buffer system (25Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10457) Google Scholar). Radioactive proteins were visualized and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Quantitative membrane binding assays were performed as described previously (14Kim P.K. Janiak-Spens F. Trimble W.S. Leber B. Andrews D.W.

Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Among Vamp homologues, Vamps1, -2, and -3 are the most similar (≥71% identical). The other Vamps are 25–33% identical to Vamp1 and to each other (16Bock J.B. Scheller R.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 133-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition, a splice isoform of Vamp1 has been reported that appears to target to mitochondria (29Greenawalt J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 30Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1761) Google Scholar). All transmembrane Vamps contain an insertion sequence that is expected to function as the membrane anchor domain. In addition, both Vamps 1 and 2 require ATP and an ER receptor to bind to ER membranes. Although it is likely that the other family members have similar requirements for membrane targeting it is essential to demonstrate this prior to using sequence comparisons to identify a putative common ER targeting signal for Vamp proteins. Vamp8 was selected as an example of a divergent Vamp because it is only 29% identical to Vamp1 and 33% identical to Vamp2. Vamp2 and Vamp8 both bind with similar efficiency to microsomes (Fig. 1, lanes 1–3). Although the binding efficiency (20 and 21%, respectively) was much lower than that observed for the control protein cytochrome b5 (67%), the amount of material pelleted was significantly higher than in control reactions without microsomes (lanes 13–15). Specific binding of Vamps never exceeded 25% suggesting that most Vamps do not fold into membrane binding competent conformation in ourin vitro system. However, >80% of the membrane-bound material was resistant to extraction with sodium carbonate, pH 11.5, confirming that this material becomes integrated into the bilayer (data not shown). When ATP was depleted from the reaction mix using apyrase or by passing the reaction mixture through a G25 column, binding was abolished for both Vamp2 and Vamp8 (Fig. 1, lanes 4–6 and7–9). When ATP was added to reactions from which small molecules were depleted by G25 chromatography, membrane binding was restored (Fig. 1, lane 10–12). Other nucleotides were ineffective, confirming the nucleotide specificity (data not shown). Previously we have shown saturable binding of Vamp1 to microsomes stripped of peripheral proteins by high salt and that this binding can be abolished when membranes are treated with a very low concentration of trypsin (14Kim P.K. Janiak-Spens F. Trimble W.S. Leber B. Andrews D.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8873-8882Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Saturable binding was also observed when Vamp1, Vamp2, and Vamp8 binding was examined to nonsalt treated microsomes (Fig. 2). Binding curves for the three proteins are superposable with saturation occurring for 1 equivalent of membranes at 45 fmol of protein. Furthermore, none of the proteins bound to trypsinized microsomes (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that all three Vamps bind to ER membranes via an interaction with a membrane protein. To formally demonstrate the presence of a common receptor would require competitive binding assays. The amount of protein required for such experiment is not attainable using in vitro translation. To confirm that unlike membrane binding of Cb5 membrane binding of Vamps requires a membrane protein, Vamp1 was assayed for binding to lipid vesicles with a composition similar to that of the ER membrane (21Andrews D.W. Lauffer L. Walter P. Lingappa V.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 797-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this assay, proteins bound to liposomes float upward in the sucrose gradients (Fig. 3 A, fraction 1). Unbound proteins remain in fraction 4, where they were loaded originally, and aggregates pellet to the bottom (fraction 5). Cb5 molecules were recovered from fractions 1 and 2 indicating direct insertion into lipid bilayers. In contrast, neither Vamp1 (Fig. 3 A) nor Vamp8 (data not shown) bound to the liposomes, consistent with the presence of a Vamp receptor on the ER. Vamp1 and -2 are known to cycle between the plasma membrane and internal organelles (30Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1761) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that Vamp proteins may insert directly into other membranes. However,in vitro, Vamp1 and Vamp8 did not pellet with lysosomes, a membrane system similar to that of endosomes (Fig. 3 B). Cb5, a positive control for membrane binding in vitro, bound to lysosomes quite efficiently confirming that the membranes were intact. Recently, a novel isoform of Vamp1 was identified that appears to target specifically to mitochondria (8Isenmann S. Khew-Goodall Y. Gamble J. Vadas M. Wattenberg B.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1649-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Targeting to mitochondria is mediated by a shortened hydrophobic domain and two positive-charged residues at the carboxyl terminus (8Isenmann S. Khew-Goodall Y. Gamble J. Vadas M. Wattenberg B.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1649-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Similar to lysosomes, authentic Vamps1 and 8 do not bind to mitochondria in vitro (data not shown). It is not known whether the modification at the carboxyl terminus that leads to mitochondrial binding eliminates binding to ER. Therefore, we modified the targeting signal on Vamp2 to match the sequence of the isoform previously shown to bind to mitochondria. This mutant termed, Vamp2mito, bound to ER membranes as efficiently as Vamp2 (Fig. 3 C) with ATP dependence (data not shown). This suggests that mitochondrial targeting may be a result of relaxed specificity for ER and that residues essential for ER targeting are not found at the extreme carboxyl terminus of the Vamps. The requirement for a receptor on the ER membrane to target Vamps suggests the presence of a specific signal that is common in the amino acid sequence of Vamp proteins but is not shared by proteins with promiscuous insertion. A candidate sequence for targeting Vamps to ER membranes is the helix 1 sequence previously shown to be important for targeting to synaptic vesicles (2Grote E. Hao J.C. Bennett M.K. Kelly R.B. Cell. 1995; 81: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons of the eight known Vamps revealed several other highly conserved regions among those with well defined insertion sequences. Because it is possible that there may also be more than one sequence that contributes to ER-specific binding, we screened a series of Vamp2 deletion mutants fused to gPA to identify those sequences sufficient for binding to microsomes in vitro (Fig. 4 A). Fusion proteins containing residues 80–116 of Vamp fused to gPA bound to microsomes as efficiently as Vamp2. We therefore designated this plasmid gPAVMB (Vamp Minimal Binding region) (Fig. 4 B). The fusion protein containing residues 90–116 of Vamp (gPAV2-(90–116)) exhibited impaired targeting. However, the deletion of residues 1–95 (yielding gPAVamp2-(96–116)) resulted in no membrane binding above background (Fig. 4 B). As shown in Fig. 4 C, gPAVMB binds to ER in an ATP-dependent fashion (but not gPAV2-(96–116), Fig. 4 B), suggesting that the mechanism of membrane binding for the fusion protein is the same as for the full-length Vamps. Using several secondary structure prediction programs, three regions of helix were predicted for the Vamps1, -2, and -8, residues 30–46 (helix 1), residues 50–72 (helix 2), and residues 76–97 (helix 3) numbering according to Vamp2. Residues 80–96 are part of the helix 3 region of Vamp2 encompassing the most conserved region among the three Vamps (residues 83–96). Within helix 3, the sixteen amino acids immediately preceding the hydrophobic sequence include five positively charged amino acids, two tryptophans, and an asparagine that are all conserved residues (Fig. 5 A). When helix 3 is plotted on a helical wheel, four of the five conserved positively charged residues were on the same face, suggesting that this region forms an amphipathic helix (Fig. 5 B). These conserved residues may contribute to a specific or may be necessary only for correct spacing between the hydrophobic domain and the gPA passenger. To test these hypotheses, all the positive charges in gPAVMB were changed to hydrophilic residues (Fig. 5 A). The resulting fusion protein, gPAVMB (0+) did not bind to membranes above background (Fig. 6 A), demonstrating that the positively charged residues are necessary for binding. To determine if the four lysines on the same face of the helix are sufficient to trigger membrane binding, a mutant was constructed in which the lysine and arginine that were not on this face of the helix (amino acids 7 and 8 in Fig. 5 B) were replaced by uncharged residues. This mutant, gPAVMB(4K), bound to microsomes as efficiently as the wild-type sequence in gPAVMB (Fig. 6 A). To probe the importance of the individual lysines on the same face of the helix a series of mutants were constructed containing various combinations of these four residues but not the lysine or arginine from the other side of the helix. No single residue was found to be critical for membrane binding. Instead, it appears that the four residues together form the binding signal. Therefore, membrane binding was averaged for mutants with the same number of positively charged amino acids. When presented in this format (Fig. 6 A), the direct relationship between the number of positive charges and membrane binding is obvious. As expected from this result, the corresponding region from Vamp8 fused to gPA were also sufficient to confer membrane binding equivalent to the full-length protein (Fig. 6 B, lanes 1 and2). When the four conserved lysine residues of Vamp8 are replaced by noncharged hydrophilic residues (Fig. 5 A), membrane binding was greatly diminished (Fig. 6 B,lanes 2 and 3). Thus the hydrophobic carboxyl-terminal sequence and the 16 amino acids directly amino-terminal of this sequence constitutes a Vamp targeting signal for ER membranes. Because this sequence is present in the Vamp1B isoform that targets to mitochondria, we tested to see if the changes at the extreme carboxyl terminus of the protein would alter the mechanism of targeting, rendering targeting to the ER insensitive to the lysines in the amphipathic helix. The signal that permits mitochondrial binding in Vamps is unable to confer ER binding when added to the gPAVMB (0+), the mutant that lacks the six positively charged residues (Fig. 3 C, lanes 4 and 5). Together these experiments confirm that the four lysines on one face of the helix are essential for binding to ER microsomes and suggest that the changes in the carboxyl terminus that permit targeting to mitochondria do not alter the mechanism of binding to ER. They further suggest that the “mitochondrial” isoform of Vamp is likely to be found at both the ER and mitochondria. To determine if the two conserved tryptophans and asparagine also play a role in binding of Vamps to membranes, these residues were changed to a variety of other amino acids by cassette mutagenesis using doped oligonucleotides. These oligonucleotides were designed to encode 1 of 10 amino acids at the sites of tryptophan and asparagine. Substitution of the asparagine residue (with Y, T, P, H, or D) significantly reduced membrane binding (Fig. 7). In contrast, with only one exception, membrane binding was insensitive to mutation of either of the tryptophan residues. The only mutant with decreased binding compared with wild type resulted in a marginal decrease (p = 0.02), observed when one of the tryptophans was changed to a proline (Fig. 7) likely by disrupting local secondary structure. Most Vamp proteins are initially targeted to the ER membrane and then sorted to their ultimate destinations within the secretory pathway. The membrane targeting of distantly related Vamps exhibit identical binding curves (Fig. 2) and require both ATP and a trypsin sensitive membrane component (Fig. 1 and Ref. 14Kim P.K. Janiak-Spens F. Trimble W.S. Leber B. Andrews D.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8873-8882Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These data strongly suggest that Vamps are targeted to pancreatic ER microsomes by a single targeting mechanism. Consistent with Vamp proteins containing a unique targeting signal within and around the hydrophobic transmembrane sequence this region is 50% identical between Vamp1 and Vamp8, two molecules with an overall identity of only 29%. Deletion and point mutations generated in Vamps as well as fusions to gPA were used to identify sequences other than the insertion sequence that are important for binding Vamps to ER. Taken together, our data suggest that the signal for ER targeting includes the 16 residues amino-terminal to the hydrophobic transmembrane domain. This region is predicted to form an amphipathic helix that contains four conserved lysine residues on one face. These lysines were shown to contribute additively to membrane binding (Fig. 6 A). Thus, both the hydrophobic region and the amphipathic sequence are necessary to direct Vamps to the ER membrane. Other proteins have been shown to use polar or charged residues to mediate the initial step in membrane insertion. Several myristoylated proteins such as Src and myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate require both the hydrophobic acyl chain and a sequence of positively charged residues for membrane binding (31Silverman L. Resh M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 415-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 32Buser C.A. Sigal C.T. Resh M.D. McLaughlin S.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2145-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In this case the cluster of basic residues is required for nonspecific interaction with acidic phospholipids, whereas the myristate is inserted into the lipid bilayer. A synaptic vesicle-associated protein, SNAP-25, requires an interhelical Gly-Pro-Xaa-Arg motif for membrane targeting (34Gonzalo S. Greentree W.K. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21313-21318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Although this process is protein-mediated, unlike Vamp, the subsequent membrane insertion of SNAP-25 requires the palmitoylation of cysteine residues. Because membrane binding of Vamps requires ATP and a trypsin-sensitive, saturable component of the ER membrane, the positive charged residues are more likely to mediate a protein interaction than bind nonspecifically to acidic phospholipids. Sequence comparison with other Vamp proteins revealed that the 16-residue predicted amphipathic helix is conserved only in those Vamp proteins with a hydrophobic putative transmembrane sequence. Comparison of the sequences of the 16-residue amphipathic targeting sequences for Vamps 1, 2, and 8 (Fig. 5 A) revealed five additional conserved amino acids (K, R, N, and two Ws). Of these only asparagine contributes to binding to microsomes in vitro, suggesting that it plays an important but as yet undefined role in membrane binding. The evidence for separate motifs that lead to either mitochondria or ER membrane binding suggests a novel model for the targeting of insertion sequence proteins to the appropriate membrane. If Vamp isoforms with a mitochondrial targeting sequence are targeted exclusively to the mitochondria, our results indicate that there must not be a cytoplasmic receptor present in reticulocyte lysate that prevents binding of these proteins to ER membranes. It is also likely that a protein is needed to insert the mitochondrial-targeted Vamps into the outer mitochondrial membrane. Our results demonstrate that the changes at the carboxyl terminus that lead to mitochondrial targeting do not lead to spontaneous insertion into ER membranes (the four lysines are still required (Fig. 3 D)) or into liposomes (data not shown). It remains to be determined if a single protein serves both functions of targeting and insertion for the mitochondrial isoform. In principle a cytoplasmic receptor is not essential for ER-specific targeting as membrane binding for these Vamps requires a membrane-bound receptor that is not found on liposomes, lysosomes, or mitochondria (Fig. 3,A and B, and data not shown). Our data suggesting a common receptor-mediated, ATP-dependent mechanism used by different Vamps to target to the ER establishes this as a bona fide targeting mechanism for carboxyl-terminal insertion sequences. Thus there are now at least five distinct mechanisms that have been proposed whereby proteins containing insertion sequences attach to membranes (14Kim P.K. Janiak-Spens F. Trimble W.S. Leber B. Andrews D.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8873-8882Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Examples of the other mechanisms include: spontaneous insertion into membranes and phospholipid vesicles (Cb5), insertion into multiple membranes without insertion into liposomes (Bcl-2), insertion into distinct intracellular membranes mediated by cytoskeletal components (polyomavirus middle T antigen), and insertion into membranes only after conformational changes that occur during apoptosis (Bax) (14Kim P.K. Janiak-Spens F. Trimble W.S. Leber B. Andrews D.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8873-8882Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar,35Andrews D.W. Gupta J. Abisdris G. Mol. Cell.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Of these, the Vamp-targeting signal is the first sequence important for integration into membranes that has been found to be located amino-terminal of the hydrophobic transmembrane sequence. Identification of this sequence will likely be useful in predicting the membrane binding mechanism used by other proteins with insertion sequences that are targeted to ER membranes. Examples include SSS1p, Sec61γ, and Sec61β, proteins that all contain a positively charged region predicted to form an amphipathic helix amino-terminal of an insertion sequence. Our results will also be useful for identifying the molecules that mediate membrane targeting and insertion of these proteins.

These cells constitutively express tissue factor (TF), the cellular receptor for plasma clotting factor VIIa (FVIIa). Formation of TF·FVIIa complexes on cell surfaces triggers the blood coagulation cascade. In the present study, we have investigated the fate of TF·FVIIa complexes formed on the cell surface of fibroblasts in the presence and absence of plasma inhibitor, tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). FVIIa bound to TF on the cell surface was internalized and degraded without depleting the cell surface TF antigen and activity. TFPI significantly enhanced the TF-specific internalization and degradation of FVIIa. TFPI-enhanced internalization and degradation of FVIIa requires the C-terminal domain of TFPI and factor Xa. TFPI·Xa-mediated internalization of FVIIa was associated with the depletion of TF from the cell surface. A majority of the internalized FVIIa was degraded, but a small portion of the internalized FVIIa recycles back to the cell surface as an intact protein. In addition to TF, other cell surface components, such as low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) and heparan sulfates, are essential for TFPI·Xa-induced internalization of FVIIa. Acidification of cytosol, which selectively inhibits the endocytotic pathway via coated pits, inhibited TFPI·Xa-mediated internalization but not the basal internalization of FVIIa. Overall, our data support the concept that FVIIa bound to cell surface TF was endocytosed by two different pathways.

Tissue factor functions as the cellular receptor for plasma clotting factor VIIa (FVIIa) and the formation of TF·FVIIa complexes on the cell surface membrane triggers the coagulation cascade (2Rapaport S.I. Rao L.V.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In health, TF is constitutively expressed on the surface membrane of many extravascular cells, such as fibroblasts within blood vessel wall, but not in cells within vasculature that contact blood such as monocytes and endothelial cells (3Fleck R.A. Rao L.V.M. Rapaport S.I. Varki N. Thromb. Res. 1990; 59: 421-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 4Drake T.A. Morrissey J.H. Edgington T.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1989; 134: 1087-1097PubMed Google Scholar). Vessel wall injury disrupts the endothelial cell barrier that normally separates the circulating blood from TF with resultant binding of circulating plasma factor VII to TF sites on cells within the vessel wall and surrounding tissues, such as fibroblasts and pericytes, triggering the coagulation. TF·FVIIa expression on cell surfaces can be regulated by at least three distinct mechanisms: transcriptional regulation of TF gene expression, the availability of anionic phospholipids, and specific plasma inhibitors, particularly tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) (5Rao L.V.M. Pendurthi U.R. Blood Coag. Fibrin. 1998; 9 (Suppl. 1): S27-S35PubMed Google Scholar). Besides these, TF·FVIIa activity on cell surfaces may also be regulated by other mechanisms. Bach and Moldow (6Bach R.R. Moldow C.F. Blood. 1997; 89: 3270-3276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that a fraction of TF on cell surfaces exists as dimers that can bind to FVIIa but are unable to activate factor X and that calcium influx into the cytosol triggers a calmodulin-dependent process that causes the dimers to dissociate into monomers capable of factor X activation. It has also been proposed that localization of TF to specialized plasma membrane microdomains, such as caveolae, might limit the function of TF (7Mulder A.B. Smit J.W. Bom V.J.J. Blom N.R.

Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Many serine proteases involved in blood coagulation and fibrinolysis bind to cell surface receptors and are subsequently internalized and trafficked within the cells. Such receptor-mediated endocytosis could also play an important role in regulation of TF-dependent coagulation. However, not much is known about the fate of TF·FVIIa complexes assembled on cell surfaces and the role of plasma inhibitors in modulating their fate. Chang and Kisiel (9Chang G.T.G. Kisiel W. Thromb. Haemost. 1995; 73: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) reported that FVIIa bound to human hepatoma cell line HuH7 was internalized independent of TF. While our present study was in progress, Hamik et al.(10Hamik K. Setiad H. Bu G. McEver R.P. Morrissey J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4962-4969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) reported that TFPI mediated the permanent down-regulation of TF in monocytic cells via low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP)-dependent internalization and degradation. In these studies, TFPI-mediated down-regulation of TF was dependent upon the presence of FVIIa but not Xa. In the present study, we investigated whether binding of FVIIa to TF leads to internalization of FVIIa and/or TF and whether TFPI·Xa affects the internalization of TF·FVIIa complexes in human fibroblasts. Our studies show that FVIIa bound to cell surface TF was internalized and degraded without depleting TF on cell surfaces. Tissue factor-specific internalization and degradation of FVIIa was significantly increased in the presence of TFPI·Xa complexes. In contrast to FVIIa internalization in the absence of TFPI·Xa, FVIIa internalization in the presence of TFPI·Xa was associated with down-regulation of TF expression on cell surfaces. Our data also provide suggestive evidence that FVIIa complexed with TF was endocytosed by two different pathways: LRP-independent pathway in the absence of TFPI·Xa and LRP-dependent pathway in the presence of TFPI·Xa. A human fibroblast cell line, WI-38, was obtained from American Type Culture Collection. The cell line was grown in T-75 flasks and subcultured into 12-well tissue culture plates as described (11Callander N.S. Rao L.V.M. Nordfang O. Sandset P.M. Warn-Cramer B. Rapaport S.I. J. Biol.

When cells reached confluency, the monolayers were washed once with buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, and 11 mmglucose) containing 5 mm EDTA and then twice with the buffer A not containing EDTA before the monolayers were used in experiments. Recombinant human FVIIa was isolated as described (12Thim L. Bjoern S. Christensen M. Nicolaisen E.M. Lund-Hansen T. Pedersen A.H. Hedner U.

Recombinant full-length TFPI expressed inEscherichia coli was a generous gift from Dr. Alba Creasy (Chiron Corp.). In initial experiments, we used recombinant TFPI expressed in baby hamster kidney cells. Because of the limited availability of this reagent, the majority of the experiments were carried out using recombinant TFPI expressed in E. coli. No apparent differences were found between full-length TFPI expressed in eukaryotic cells and bacteria in their effects on FVIIa binding, internalization, and degradation. Factors X (14Bajaj S.P.

The 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP) and the affinity purified anti-LRP antibodies were generous gift of Dr. Dudley Strickland (American Red Cross, Rockville, MD). FVIIa, FFR-FVIIa, and TF mAb were labeled by using Iodo-Gen coated tubes and Na125I according to the manufacturer's technical bulletin and as described previously (17Le D.T. Rapaport S.I. Rao L.V.M.

The reaction was quenched by the addition of KI (1%), and free iodine was removed by extensive dialysis against 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl. The concentration of the labeled proteins was determined byA 280 measurements. Specific radioactivity of labeled proteins was 5–9 × 109 cpm/mg. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the radiolabeled proteins were intact with no apparent degradation.125I-labeled FVIIa retained 80% or more of the functional activity of the unlabeled FVIIa. To determine FVIIa and FFR-FVIIa binding to cell surface TF, confluent monolayers of WI-38 in 12-well culture plates were incubated with 0.5 ml of 125I-labeled FVIIa or125I-labeled FFR-FVIIa (10 nm) in buffer B (buffer A containing 5 mm CaCl2 and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for varying time periods either at 37 or 4 °C. At selected times, unbound 125I-VIIa was removed, and the monolayers were washed four times with ice-cold buffer B. The cell surface-associated radioactivity was eluted by incubating the washed monolayers for 1 min with 0.5 ml of 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.4, and the eluate was counted in a γ counter (Cobra, Packard Instrument Co). After eluting the cell surface-associated radioactivity, the cells were removed from the well by trypsin digestion and counted for the radioactivity to determine internalized ligand. To determine degradation of the ligand, monolayers were incubated with125I-labeled FVIIa or FFR-FVIIa (10 nm) as described above, and at selected time intervals an aliquot from the overlying medium was removed and precipitated with equal volume of trichloroacetic acid (20% v/v). Radioactivity associated with trichloroacetic acid-soluble fraction was taken as degraded ligand. To determine TF-specific binding, internalization and degradation of FVIIa, parallel experiments were carried out in which the monolayers were first incubated for 30 min with rabbit anti-human TF IgG (100 μg/ml) before radioactive ligands were added to cells. TF-specific binding, internalization, and degradation were determined by subtracting the values from the corresponding values obtained in the absence of anti-TF antibody. In general, TF-specific binding, internalization, and degradation of 125I-labeled FVIIa in WI-38 cells was in the range of 70–80%. Duplicate wells were used for all measurements, and most of the experiments were repeated 3–4 times. The data shown in the figures represent the means ± S.E. To investigate whether TF receptors are depleted from the cell surface in the process of FVIIa internalization, monolayers were incubated at 37 °C with unlabeled FVIIa and FFR-FVIIa in the presence and absence of TFPI·Xa for varying time periods and then chilled on ice. Cell surface TF was measured in two ways: (i) The monolayers were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with 125I-labeled TF monoclonal antibodies (TF9-H10) that bind to TF whether or not the TF was occupied by FVIIa. After 2 h, unbound radiolabeled TF antibodies were removed from the cells, and the cells were washed four times with ice cold buffer B. Cell-associated radioactivity was determined by detaching the cells from the wells with trypsin/EDTA digestion and counting them in a gamma counter. (ii) The monolayers were washed for 3 min with glycine, pH 2.4, to dissociate ligands associated with the cell surface, and then monolayers were washed three times with buffer B. The cell surface TF activity was assayed in a factor Xa generation assay after the addition of fresh FVIIa (10 nm) and FX (175 nm) (17Le D.T. Rapaport S.I. Rao L.V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15447-15454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the fate of FVIIa bound to cell surface TF, confluent monolayers of human embryonal lung fibroblasts (WI-38), which constitutively express TF, were incubated with 125I-labeled FVIIa or 125I-labeled FFR-FVIIa (10 nm), in the absence and presence of anti-TF IgG, for varying time periods at 37 °C, and the levels of cell surface-associated, internalized, and degraded FVIIa were measured. As shown in Fig. 1 A, FVIIa and FFR-FVIIa bound to cell surface TF in a time-dependent manner, and the saturation of cell surface binding of FVIIa occurs within 60 min. The data also show that no marked differences exist between the kinetics of FVIIa and FFR-FVIIa binding to cell surface TF. However, it should be noted that in a majority of experiments, we found 10–20% more FFR-FVIIa associated with the cell surface as compared with FVIIa. The greater amounts of FFR-FVIIa association with cell surface TF than FVIIa could be the result of a known higher affinity of FFR-FVIIa than FVIIa to TF (13Sorensen B.B. Persson E. Freskgard P.-O. Kjalke M. Ezban M. Williams T. Rao L.V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11863-11868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 18Sorensen B.B. Rao L.V.M. Blood Coag. Fibrinol. 1998; 9 (suppl.): S67-S71Google Scholar). Binding experiments performed at 4 °C showed a similar amount of FVIIa binding to the cell surface but required about 120 min of incubation to reach the maximal binding (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1 B, FVIIa and FFR-FVIIa bound to cell surface TF was internalized in a time-dependent manner, and no differences were found between FVIIa and FFR-FVIIa in their internalization. The amount of FVIIa internalized was progressively increased up to 60 min and thereafter reached steady-state levels. At the end of the 2-h incubation period at 37 °C, about 20% of FVIIa associated with cells was in internalized form. As expected, no internalization of 125I-labeled FVIIa was observed if the cells were incubated with radiolabeled FVIIa at 4 °C (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1 C, TF-mediated internalized FVIIa and FFR-FVIIa were degraded and secreted into overlying medium. No differences were found between FVIIa and FFR-FVIIa in their degradation. The rate of degradation was linear after 1 h of incubation, and about 150 fmol of FVII/106 cells were degraded per hour. To test whether the binding of plasma inhibitor TFPI to cell surface TF·FVIIa complexes affects the kinetics of FVIIa binding, internalization, and degradation, WI-38 cells were incubated with 125I-labeled FVIIa (10 nm) in the presence of TFPI·Xa complexes (10 nm). The data show that TFPI·Xa markedly enhanced the internalization of FVIIa bound to cell surface TF (Fig. 2 B). TFPI·Xa-induced increase in internalization of FVIIa was associated with an increased degradation of FVIIa (Fig. 2 C). TFPI·Xa also slightly enhanced the amount of FVIIa associated with the cell surface TF (Fig. 2 A), and this could be due to a slower dissociation of FVIIa from the quaternary complex of TF·FVIIa·TFPI·Xa (19Rao L.V.M. Nordfang O. Hoang A.D. Pendurthi U.R. Blood. 1995; 85: 121-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TFPI·Xa had no effect on the cellular uptake and degradation of FFR-FVIIa (Fig. 2). Next, we investigated structural requirements of TFPI for its ability to increase the rate of FVIIa internalization. Preincubation of cells with anti TFPI-IgG did not prevent the base level of FVIIa internalization, which indicates that traces of endogenous TFPI that could be possibly present on cell surfaces is not responsible for the internalization of FVIIa observed in the absence of exogenously added inhibitor. TFPI had to be in complex with factor Xa to increase the cellular uptake of FVIIa, because TFPI and factor Xa alone had no significant effect on the internalization of FVIIa (Fig. 3 A). To examine the role of C-terminal region and the third Kunitz domain of TFPI in TF-mediated internalization of FVIIa, we have used recombinant TFPI variants, TFPI lacking C-terminal region (TFPI1–250) and TFPI lacking both the third Kunitz domain and C-terminal region (TFPI1–161). As shown in Fig. 3 B, unlike TFPI·Xa, TFPI1–250·Xa, and TFPI1–161·Xa complexes only minimally enhanced the extent of FVIIa internalization, indicating that intact C terminus of TFPI is required for enhancing the internalization of FVIIa bound to TF. We also examined the effect of full-length TFPI·Xa and truncated variant TFPI·Xa complexes on their ability to inhibit cell surface TF·FVIIa functional activity (measured in factor X activation assay). All TFPI·Xa preparations at a 10 nm concentration completely inhibited TF·FVIIa functional activity, and no significant differences were found in their inhibitory activity. Because the basic C terminus of TFPI has been shown previously to bind heparin (20Wesselschmidt R. Likert K. Huang Z. MacPhail L. Broze Jr., G.J. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1993; 4: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and because the above experiments show C-terminal region of TFPI is important for TFPI·Xa-enhanced internalization and degradation of FVIIa, we have examined the ability of heparin to affect FVIIa binding, internalization, and degradation in the presence and absence of TFPI·Xa. As shown in Fig. 4, heparin had no significant effect on FVIIa internalization and the subsequent degradation in the absence of TFPI·Xa. However, heparin reduced TFPI·Xa-enhanced internalization by 30% and the degradation by about 50%. The decreased internalization and degradation of FVIIa by heparin did not stem from the impairment in FVIIa binding to cell surfaces because the same amount of FVIIa was associated with cell surface TF in the presence and absence of heparin (data not shown). TFPI was shown to bind directly to LRP (21Warshawsky I. Herz J. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25873-25879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and LRP mediates the cellular uptake and degradation of TFPI (22Warshawsky I. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6664-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Further, LRP functions as an endocytosis receptor for a number of diverse ligands that are involved in lipoprotein metabolism and coagulation regulation (23Strickland D.K. Kounnas M.Z. Argraves W.S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 892-898Crossref Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the role of LRP in FVIIa uptake and degradation by using anti-LRP antibodies and RAP, a 39-kDa protein that inhibits the binding and/or cellular uptake of all ligands by LRP (23Strickland D.K. Kounnas M.Z. Argraves W.S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 892-898Crossref Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Anti-LRP antibodies and RAP had no or only minimal effect on the internalization and degradation of FVIIa in the absence of TFPI·Xa (Fig. 5). In contrast, both anti-LRP antibodies and RAP inhibited TFPI·Xa-increased internalization and degradation of FVIIa (Fig. 5). The effect of anti-LRP antibodies and RAP was more pronounced in TFPI·Xa-mediated degradation of FVIIa (60–90% inhibition) than TFPI·Xa-mediated internalization (30–60% inhibition). Both anti-LRP antibodies and RAP had no significant effect on FVIIa binding to cell surface TF in the absence and presence of TFPI·Xa. In fact, RAP slightly enhanced the amount of FVIIa associated with cell surface TF (data not shown). The above data that show heparin and RAP inhibit the internalization and degradation of FVIIa in the presence of TFPI·Xa but not in its absence, suggest that FVIIa·TF and FVIIa·TF·TFPI·Xa complexes are internalized via different endocytotic pathways. To examine the role of coated pits on FVIIa internalization and degradation, we have depleted coated pits on cell surface by cytosol acidification. As shown in Fig. 6, acidification of cells did not affect FVIIa binding to cell surface TF in the presence and absence of TFPI·Xa. In the presence of TFPI·Xa, acidification inhibited FVIIa internalization by more than 50% and the degradation by 80%. In contrast, acidification had a minimal effect on the internalization and degradation of FVIIa not complexed with TFPI·Xa (Fig. 6). Next, we examined whether a portion of internalized FVIIa could recycle back to cell surface. In these experiments, WI-38 cells were incubated with125I-labeled FVIIa in the presence and absence of TFPI·Xa for 1 h at 37 °C to allow internalization of FVIIa. Thereafter, cell surface-associated radiolabeled FVIIa was completely removed by treating the cells with low pH buffer, and the monolayers were allowed to stand at 37 °C. At the end of 30- and 90-min incubation periods, the amount of cell surface-associated, degraded, and internalized FVIIa were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 7, at the end of 30 min, although the majority of FVIIa remain inside the cell, a significant portion of internalized FVIIa (about 25%) was associated with the outer cell surface. We also observed recycling of FVIIa, to a lower extent (about 15%), that was internalized with TFPI·Xa. Furthermore, a small portion of secreted radioactivity in the overlying medium could be precipitable with 10% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid, suggesting the release of intact FVIIa from the internalized pool. This was further supported by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, which showed that trichloroacetic acid-precipitable FVIIa migrated as a single band with approximate molecular mass of 50 kDa (Fig. 7 B). At the end of 90 min, the fraction of cell surface-associated FVIIa remained unchanged or slightly reduced, but the amount of internalized FVIIa was decreased substantially with a corresponding increase in the secretion of degraded FVIIa (data not shown). To obtain further support for the observation that a portion of internalized FVIIa recycles back to the cell surface, we have monitored the expression of TF·FVIIa functional activity. In these experiments, unlabeled FVIIa was allowed to internalize as described above. After the removal of cell surface-associated FVIIa, the cells were allowed to stand at 37 °C for varying time periods before adding factor X to determine TF·FVIIa functional activity. Because no FVIIa was added with factor X, the rate of factor X activation directly correlates to the amount of FVIIa recycled onto the cell surface TF. As shown in Fig. 7 B, factor X activation was increased in a time-dependent manner for 30 min, indicating the appearance of functionally active FVIIa on the cell surface. (A low level of factor X activation seen at zero time could possibly be due to the presence of trace contaminant FVII in the factor X preparation.) When similar experiments were carried out to evaluate the recycling of FVIIa that was internalized with TFPI·Xa, we found that factor X was activated with a rate less than 20% of that was obtained with FVIIa internalized in the absence of TFPI·Xa (data not shown). This could be due to a combination of a lower extent of FVIIa recycling that was internalized with TFPI·Xa and/or possible recycling of TFPI·Xa that could inhibit the functional activity of recycled FVIIa. The above experiments clearly establish that FVIIa bound to TF is internalized and TFPI·Xa enhances the extent of FVIIa internalization. However, these data do not provide any information on the fate of cell surface TF. To examine this, we have monitored the expression of cell surface TF in cells exposed to a variety of experimental conditions by determining the radiolabeled TF mAb binding to cells and also by measuring the expression of cell surface TF functional activity. For binding studies, we chose a TF mAb, TF9 10H10, because it was shown to bind to TF at an epitope that was not affected by FVIIa and factor X binding to TF (24Morrissey J.H. Fair D.S. Edgington T.S. Thromb. Res. 1988; 52: 247-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Further, Western blot analysis using whole cell extract of WI-38 cells established that the antibody recognized a single protein, corresponding to the molecular mass of purified human brain TF (45 kDa). In initial experiments, we characterized TF mAb binding to WI-38 cells by incubating monolayers with varying concentrations of125I-labeled TF mAb at 4 °C in the presence and absence of 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled antibody. The data show that TF mAb bound to cell surface TF in a dose-dependent and saturable manner with a high specificity. The amount of nonspecific binding of TF mAb to the cell surface was negligible (less than 5%) (Fig. 8 A). A 10–20 nmconcentration of TF mAb was sufficient to obtain saturable binding. As expected, the binding of TF mAb to cell surface TF was not affected by the presence of FVIIa or FVIIa and TFPI·Xa (data not shown). The apparent discrepancy in the amount of TF mAb and FVIIa bound to cell surface TF (Figs. 1 A and 8 A) could be the result of variation in TF expression in different batches of cells used in these experiments. Additional experiments were carried out to examine whether TF mAb bound to cell surface TF was internalized. As shown in Fig. 8 B, the cell-bound TF mAb was internalized at 37 °C in a time-dependent manner, and the rate of internalization was about 400 fmol/106 cells/h. To determine whether internalization of TF mAb was associated with depletion of cell surface TF, we first incubated the monolayers with unlabeled TF mAb at 37 °C for various time periods and then measured the amount of cell surface TF by radiolabeled FVIIa binding and functional activity assay. The preincubation of cells with TF mAb resulted in a minimal decrease in the subsequent FVIIa binding to cell surface TF (Fig. 9 A) and no change in the functional expression of cell surface TF (Fig. 9 B). These data demonstrate that internalization of TF mAb was not associated with depletion of TF receptors on the cell surface, suggesting a rapid recycling of internalized TF receptor. Although with the present data we cannot rule out the possibility that the antibody binding to TF induced the internalization of TF, the data are also compatible with the hypothesis that TF receptor is continuously internalized and recycled in the absence of the ligand. To investigate whether TF receptors were depleted from the cell surface in the process of FVIIa internalization, monolayers of WI-38 cells were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h with unlabeled FVIIa or FFR-FVIIa in the presence and absence of plasma inhibitors. Then the monolayers were chilled on ice and incubated with 125I-labeled TF mAb (10 nm) f"

Analysis of deduced amino acid sequences revealed that β1 and β2 encode 349 and 354 amino acids, respectively, and the two isoforms only differ in the most carboxyl 28 amino acids. The γ cDNA encodes 354 amino acids and is almost identical to monkey IDHγ. Northern analyses revealed that the smaller β2 transcript (1.3 kilobases) is primarily expressed in heart and skeletal muscle, whereas the larger β1 mRNA (1.6 kilobases) is prevalent in nonmuscle tissues. Sequence analysis of the IDHβ gene indicates that the difference in the C-terminal 28 amino acids between β1and β2 proteins results from alternative splicing of a single transcript. Among the various combinations of human IDH subunits co-expressed in bacteria, αβγ, αβ, and αγ combinations exhibited significant amounts of IDH activity, whereas subunits produced alone and βγ showed no detectable activity. These data suggest that the α is the catalytic subunit and that at least one of the other two subunits plays an essential supporting role for activity. Substitution of β1 with β2 in the co-expression system lowered the pH optimum for IDH activity from 8.0 to 7.6. This difference in optimal pH was analogous to what was observed in mouse kidney and brain (β1 prevalent; optimal pH 8.0) versus heart (β2 prevalent; pH 7.6) mitochondria. Experiments with a specially designed splicing reporter construct stably transfected into HT1080 cells indicate that acidic conditions favor a splicing pattern responsible for the muscle- and heart-specific β2 isoform. Taken together, these data indicate a regulatory role of IDHβ isoforms in determining the pH optimum for IDH activity through the tissue-specific alternative splicing.

Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1970; 2: 1-17Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In mammals, three classes of ICDH isoenzymes exist: mitochondrial NAD+-dependent ICDH (IDH), mitochondrial NADP+-dependent ICDH, and cytosolic NADP+-dependent ICDH (2Plaut G.W.E. Gabriel J.L. Lennon D.L.F. Stratman F.W. Zahlten R.N. Biochemistry of Metabolic Process. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc, 1983: 285-301Google Scholar, 3Plaut G.W. E Cook M. Aogaichi T. Biochim. Biophys.

In addition, recent data suggest that a peroxisomal NADP+-dependent ICDH exists as the fourth ICDH isoenzyme in yeast. This putative protein probably provides NADPH, which is required for the peroxisomal oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids (5Henke B. Girzalsky W. Berteaux-Lecellier V. Erdmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3702-3711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 6van Roermund C.W. Hettema E.H. Kal A.J. van den Berg M. Tabak H.F. Wanders R.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In contrast to eukaryotics, only one type of ICDH (NADP+-dependent enzyme) is present inEscherichia coli (7LaPorte D.C. Thorsness P.E. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10563-10568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among the eukaryotic ICDH isoenzymes, IDH has been assumed to play a major role in the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (8Barnes L.D. Kuehn G.D. Atkinson D.E. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3939-3944Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 9Ehrlich R.S. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4769-4774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its key role is underscored by the fact that its activity is regulated by numerous allosteric regulators. For example, it is positively regulated by ADP in mammals and AMP in yeast, yet inhibited by ATP, NADH, or NADPH. Calcium ions have also been known to enhance IDH activity in the presence of isocitrate and adenine nucleotide (10Aogaichi T. Evans J. Gabriel J. Plaut G.W.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 204: 350-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Recent functional studies on the yeast ICDH isoenzymes revealed the catalytic and regulatory roles of IDH2 and IDH1, respectively (11Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22199-22205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16417-16423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9323-9328Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition to its catalytic role in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the yeast IDH protein was shown to specifically bind to the 5′-untranslated region of mRNAs of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunits I, II, and III as well as cytochrome b, thus suggesting another important regulatory role of the IDH protein in controlling mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism (14Elzinga S.D. Bednarz A.L. van Oosterum K. Dekker P.J. Grivell L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5328-5331Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In mammals, the IDH enzyme exists as a heterotetramer consisting of 2α, 1β,and 1γ subunits. All the subunits have comparable molecular masses (39–41 kDa) and highly similar amino acid sequences (15Ramachandran N. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8859-8864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Huang Y.C. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8266-8273Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Despite numerous biochemical and kinetic studies of IDH isolated from animal tissues, the precise function of each subunit and the nature of their interactions in the catalytically active IDH protein have not been elucidated in mammals. The nucleotide and deduced protein sequences of a cDNA clone encoding the human IDHα were previously reported, and the possibility that IDHα serves as a catalytic subunit was suggested (17Kim Y.-O. Oh I.-U. Park H.-S. Jeng J. Song B.J. Huh T.-L. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Accordingly, to further elucidate the functional roles of the three IDH subunits, human cDNA clones for both IDHβ and IDHγ were isolated and characterized and then co-expressed with IDHα inE. coli using a co-expression system that we developed. We demonstrate that IDHα is critical for the catalytic activity of IDH, whereas the IDHβ or -γ subunit has a supporting role in constituting the IDH activity. We also report, for the first time, the tissue-specific expression of an IDHβ isoform (IDHβ2), which is probably derived from a pH-dependent exon-splitting alternative splicing from a single IDHβ gene caused by an internal acceptor within an intron (18Andreadis A. Gallego M.E. Nadal-Ginard B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1987; 3: 207-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The substitution of IDHβ1 (non-muscle-specific) with IDHβ2(muscle-specific) in the recombinant IDHαβγ protein lowered the optimal pH values for IDH activity from 8.0 to 7.6.

Oligonucleotides were radiolabeled at the 3′-end with [α-32P]dCTP using terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase as described by Rosenberg et al. (20Rosenberg H.F. Ackerman S.J. Tenen D.G. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 384PubMed Google Scholar) and then used as probes for plaque hybridization. Bovine heart λgt11 cDNA library was screened with32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes (oligo 1 and 2 for IDHβ and oligo 3 and 4 for IDHγ). Conditions for hybridization and washing were as described (20Rosenberg H.F. Ackerman S.J. Tenen D.G. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 384PubMed Google Scholar). The positive cDNA clones from plaque hybridization were subcloned into plasmid pGEM7(+), and their nucleotide sequences were determined. The cDNA inserts containing a deduced amino acid sequence matching the amino acid sequences of the partial tryptic peptide sequences (16Huang Y.C. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8266-8273Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) of the pig heart IDHβ and IDHγ were isolated, labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random primer labeling, and then used to screen a λgt11 cDNA library from human heart. Conditions for hybridization and washing were as described previously (21Huh T.-L. Ryu J.-H. Huh J.-W. Sung H.-C. Oh I.-L. Song B.J. Veech R.L. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The cDNA inserts for human IDHβ1, IDHβ2, and IDHγ were isolated and subcloned into plasmid pGEM7(+) for subsequent characterization as described below. Genomic clones for human IDHβ were isolated from a λEMBL3 human lymphocyte genomic DNA library (Dr. Frank J. Gonzalez, NCI, National Institutes of Health) by plaque hybridization with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled IDHβ1 cDNA as a probe. The conditions for labeling, hybridization, and washing were the same as described above. Complete nucleotide sequences of the largest cDNA clones encoding human IDHβ1, IDHβ2, and IDHγ were determined by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (22Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52250) Google Scholar) with a Sequenase version 2.0 kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). To accomplish double-stranded DNA sequencing, cDNA subclones were gradually deleted from both ends using a kit (Erase-a-Base from Promega (Madison, WI)) with the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Nucleotide sequence data were assembled and analyzed using the computer software PC/GENE (IntelliGenetics, Mountain View, CA). The nucleotide sequence analysis for genomic DNA was also performed as described above. A membrane for human multiple tissue Northern (MTNTM) blot (CLONTECH, Palto Alto, CA) was successively probed with 32P-labeled IDHβ and IDHγ cDNAs. Total RNAs from various mouse (C57BL/6NCR) tissues were prepared using RNAzol (Tel-Test Inc., Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Polyadenylated RNA (4 μg/lane) from different mouse tissues was separated by electrophoresis on 0.66 m formamide, 1% agarose gels, transferred to GeneScreen membranes, and hybridized with32P-labeled human cDNA probes for IDHα, IDHβ2, and IDHγ, respectively. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (1.2-kb cDNA fragment fromCLONTECH) was used as a loading control to monitor the quantity and integrity of the mRNA. Hybridization was carried out at 42 °C in a solution of 50 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 5× Denhardt's solution (1× Denhardt's solution: 0.1% Ficoll, 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.1% bovine serum albumin), 50% formamide, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA for at least 20 h. The membranes were washed in 2× SSC (1× SSC: 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015m sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 0.1% SDS twice for 15 min and then washed once with 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C for 20 min. The membranes were then dried and exposed to x-ray films at −80 °C with intensifying screen. Amplifications of DNA by PCR were performed using the following sets of oligonucleotide primers, AM1/AM2, BM1/BM2, and GM1/GM2 (for the sequences of primers, see below) to introduce appropriate restriction enzyme sites into the 5′- and 3′-ends of the coding sequences for the mature human IDHα (17Kim Y.-O. Oh I.-U. Park H.-S. Jeng J. Song B.J. Huh T.-L. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), IDHβ1/IDHβ2, and IDHγ, respectively, in a DNA thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer) as described previously (17Kim Y.-O. Oh I.-U. Park H.-S. Jeng J. Song B.J. Huh T.-L. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The primers were synthesized to contain either a NdeI orBamHI site as highlighted by boldface letters as follows: AM1 (sense), 5′-AGACATATGACTGGTGGTTTCAGACA-3′; AM2 (antisense), 5′-GTGGGATCCATTTAGAGTGACTGATGTAAATGC-3′. BM1 (sense), 5′-GCGCATATGGCATCGCGGACGCAGGCCGAG-3′; BM2 (antisense), 5′-TATGGATCCGGCCTATGGGTGGGGCAA-3′. GM1 (sense), 5′-CGAGGCATATGTTTTCAGAACAAACAATT-3′; GM2 (antisense), 5′-AGGGGATCCTAGGGCCAGCCTAGGCCTCCA-3′. The amplified DNA fragments were gel-purified and then subcloned into pT7Blue T-vector (Novagen, Madison, WI); their partial nucleotide sequences near the cloning site were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The modified DNA fragments were excised with NdeI/BamHI enzymes and inserted into the NdeI/BamHI site of the expression vector pT7–7 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to generate the plasmids pHIDHα, pHIDHβ1, pHIDHβ2 and pHIDHγ (Fig. 1). The recombinant plasmids for co-production of IDH proteins were constructed by the strategy outlined in Fig. 1. For co-production of IDHα and IDHγ, a ScaI/BglII fragment containing the IDHγ coding region was isolated from the plasmid pHIDHγ and treated with Klenow enzyme to produce a blunt end and then ligated to theScaI-cleaved plasmid pHIDHα to generate plasmid pHIDHαγ. For co-production of IDHγ with IDHβ, plasmid pHIDHβ1γ and pHIDHβ2γ were constructed by the ligation of the ScaI/BamHI fragment from plasmid pHIDHγ with the ScaI/BglII fragments isolated from the respective plasmid pHIDHβ1 and pHIDHβ2. For co-production of all IDH subunits, plasmid pHIDHαβ1γ or pHIDHαβ2γ was constructed by ligation of the larger DNA fragment from theScaI/BglII-digested plasmid pHIDHαγ with the larger ScaI/BamHI fragments of plasmid pHIDHβ1 or pHIDHβ2. For co-production of IDHα and IDHβ proteins, plasmid pHIDHαβ1 and pHIDHαβ2 were constructed by self-ligation of the larger DNA fragments isolated from the BamHI-cleaved plasmid pHIDHαβ1γ and pHIDHαβ2γ, respectively. E. coli EB106 (λ−, icd-11, dadA1 (op),trpA62, trpE61, tnaA5) (23Apostolakos D. Menter P.A. Rampsch B.J. Reeves H.C. Birge E.A. Curr. Microbiol. 1982; 7: 45-47Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar) deficient in ICDH was obtained from E. coli Genetic Stock Center (Department of Biology, Yale University). To introduce T7 RNA polymerase gene into the chromosome of E. coli EB106, the recombinant phage λDE3 was infected to E. coli EB106 by λDE3 Lysogenization kit (Novagen, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The λDE3 lysogen of E. coli EB106 was designated asE. coli EB106 (DE3) and used as a host to overproduce the recombinant IDH proteins of various combinations, as described above. The recombinant plasmids were transferred to E. coli EB106 (DE3) by the CaCl2 method (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar), and bacterial colonies with positive inserts were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB media supplemented with ampicillin (50 μg/ml). The overnight cultures of transformants were diluted 100-fold into 1 liter of the same media and allowed to grow at 37 °C until A 600 reached 0.6. The cultures containing transformants were cooled in an ice-water bath and treated with 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to induce gene expression. During the induction period, bacterial cells were grown at 25 °C for 24 h with poor aeration. E. coli cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in a lysis buffer (10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Resuspended cells were disrupted by sonication with five 20-s treatments at half-maximum power of a sonicator (Bronson model 350) on ice. The soluble lysates obtained by centrifugation at 9000 × g for 20 min were used to measure the IDH activity. All procedures for the soluble lysate preparation were conducted at 4 °C. IDH activity was determined by monitoring the production of NADH at 340 nm, the same as the method described by Rutter and Denton (25Rutter G.A. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) with slight modification. IDH activity was measured at 25 °C in reaction mixture (50 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, containing 5 mmthreo-ds-isocitrate, 35.5 mm triethanolamine, 2 mm NAD+, 1 mm ADP, 2 mmMgCl2, and 1 μg/ml rotenone). Enzyme reaction was initiated by the addition of the E. coli soluble lysate containing the recombinant IDH proteins into the reaction mixture (final volume of 1 ml), and optical density was measured using a Beckman DU-65 spectrophotometer. To determine the optimal pH value for each IDH isoform, the pH of the reaction mixture was gradually changed in 0.2-unit increments starting from 6.2 and ending with 8.8. The rate of NADH production was linear for at least 1 min. One unit of IDH activity is defined as the amount catalyzing the conversion of 1 μmol of substrate/min at 25 °C. Kinetic constants (K m and V max) for the recombinant IDHαβ1γ and IDHαβ2γ were obtained by nonlinear regression analysis and fitted to v =V max·S n /(K m + S n). Enzyme reactions were performed at pH 7.8 and 25 °C. Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. To determine the optimal pH value for IDH activity in different tissues, mitochondrial fractions from mouse brain, heart, and kidney were prepared by the method of Loverde and Lehrer (27Loverde A.W. Lehrer G.M. J. Neurochem. 1973; 20: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To study the effect of pH on the level of splicing responsible for H-IDHβ2, the DNA fragment containing part of the human IDHβ gene (nucleotide positions 539–1888 in Fig. 6 A) was cloned by PCR using the following set of oligomers. A modified sense primer (5′-TAGCCGTCGACTCTCTCTCCAACAGGG-3′) and an antisense primer (5′-TGGGTGGGCCCAGGCAGCAATGAC-3′) were used to contain the respective SalI and ApaI restriction sequences, as marked by boldface letters. This PCR fragment was double-digested with SalI and ApaI and then ligated to the SalI- and ApaI-cleaved plasmid pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH) containing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene as a marker. The resulting plasmid, designated as pIDHβGFP, was subsequently used to start the translation of GFP from AUG codon (nucleotide positions 607–609 in Fig. 6 A) present in the exon of the H-IDHβ gene. To prepare cells expressing the IDHβ-GFP construct, 10 μg of pIDHβGFP DNA was transfected into HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method. Transfected cells were grown for 48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. To obtain cells that were stably transfected, HT1080 cells were selected for 2 weeks in culture media containing G418 (500 μg/ml) with media changed every 2 days. HT1080 cells that were both resistant to G418 and fluorescent (from GFP) under a fluorescence microscope were collected and used for subsequent experiments. The cells expressing GFP were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 15 mm sodium bicarbonate (approximately pH 7.4). At 70% confluence, HT1080 cells were rinsed once with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, pH 7.4, and further allowed to grow for 16 h in fresh media at the following pH: 6.2, 6.6, 7.0, 7.4, and 7.8 (0.9, 2.3, 5.9, 15.0, and 37.0 mm sodium bicarbonate). The condition for pH adjustment was as previously reported (28Endo H. Matsuda C. Kagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12488-12493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GFP fluorescence in HT1080 cells was observed by an inverted microscope (Olympus BX50) with a GFP filter. To measure the relative intensity of GFP fluorescence, transfected HT1080 cells grown under different pH values were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer with a Teflon pestle in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Triton X-100. Clear cell lysates were obtained by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. The intensity of GFP fluorescence was determined for each cell lysate (0.3 mg of protein in 3 ml) at least three times per sample by a fluorescence spectrometer (Kontron SFM25) with excitation and emission at 488 and 510 nm, respectively. Mixed oligonucleotide probes as described under “Experimental Procedures” were used to screen a bovine heart λgt11 cDNA library in order to isolate cDNA clones encoding IDHβ and IDHγ subunits. Six and five positive cDNA clones for IDHβ and IDHγ, respectively, were isolated from about 2 million plaques screened. The size of DNA inserts ranged from 0.7 to 1.6 kb. Independent cDNA inserts for IDHβ and IDHγ were purified and subcloned into plasmid pGEM7(+), and their nucleotide sequences were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Among the cDNA clones isolated for IDHβ, one clone (1.4 kb) showed a deduced amino acid sequence of SSRTQGEDVRVE, which is very similar to the partial tryptic peptide sequence (ASRSQAEDVRVE) of pig heart IDHβ (16Huang Y.C. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8266-8273Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Another cDNA clone (1.6 kb) showed a deduced amino acid sequence (FSQQTIPPSAKYGGRHTVTMIPGDGIGP), which is highly homologous to the partial tryptic peptide sequence (FSQQTIPPSAKYGGILTVTMSPGDGDGP) of pig heart IDHγ (16Huang Y.C. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8266-8273Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The two partially characterized bovine cDNA clones for bovine IDHβ (1.4 kb) and IDHγ (1.6 kb) were then used as DNA probes to isolate their human counterpart cDNAs. Eighteen positive clones (insert size ranging from 0.6 to 1.6 kb) for IDHβ and 20 positive clones (from 0.4 to 1.5 kb) for IDHγ were isolated from about 1 million phage plaques from a human heart λgt11 cDNA library. The positive phage plaques were further purified. The entire nucleotide sequences of the two largest cDNA inserts for IDHβ (1.6 kb) and IDHγ (1.5 kb) were subsequently determined from both ends. As shown in Fig. 2, one cDNA clone for human IDHβ (H-IDHβ) was 1,597 bp long with an open reading frame (1,155 bp) for the entire protein coding region of IDHβ, starting with the initiation codon, ATG, and ending with the termination codon, TAG. One site for potential polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) was found in the 3′-untranslated region. The N terminus of the deduced amino acid sequence of the human IDHβ precursor protein (Ala1–Ala33) is identical to the N-terminal 33-amino acid sequence of pig IDHβ (16Huang Y.C. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8266-8273Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) except for the 14th and 31st amino acids. Therefore, the precursor human protein contains 385 amino acids (42,211 Da), and the mature protein consists of 351 amino acids (38,794 Da) with the first 34 amino acids as a mitochondrial signal peptide. Deduced protein sequence of H-IDHβ showed 96% identity to that of monkey IDHβ (29Nichols B.J. Perry A.C.F. Hall L. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), although the C-terminal region of H-IDHβ shared less amino acid sequence homology with those of pig peptide XII (16Huang Y.C. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8266-8273Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and monkey IDHβ (29Nichols B.J. Perry A.C.F. Hall L. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3,M-IDHβ). Careful examination of the nucleotide and deduced protein sequences revealed an intron-like sequence of 317 bp in the H-IDHβ sequence, starting at the GT (nucleotides 1072 and 1073 in Fig. 2) and ending at the AG (nucleotides 1387 and 1388 in Fig. 2). These dinucleotide sequences GT (GU in mRNA) and AG exactly match the consensus boundary sequences for the 5′-splice site (donor site) and 3′-splice site (acceptor site) of an intron (30Sharp P.A. Cell. 1994; 77: 805-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), respectively. Interestingly, the deduced C-terminal protein sequence obtained by splicing out of an intron-like sequence (317 bp) from H-IDHβ cDNA was almost identical to those of tryptic peptide XII (16Huang Y.C. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8266-8273Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and monkey IDHβ (29Nichols B.J. Perry A.C.F. Hall L. Denton R.M. Biochem.

Overexpression of human P-glycoprotein MDR1 is responsible for the phenomenon of multiple drug resistance in various resistant cell lines and tumors. P-glycoprotein is an integral plasma membrane protein that acts as an ATP-dependent efflux pump to extrude seemingly unrelated hydrophobic compounds from the cell interior, thus conferring resistance to a large variety of drugs (1Gottesman M.M.

It belongs to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC)1transporter superfamily and consists of a tandem repeat of transmembrane domains and conserved nucleotide-binding motifs, connected by a central linker region (1Gottesman M.M.

Ubiquitination of plasma membrane proteins acts as a signal to initiate their endocytosis and subsequent Pep4p-dependent degradation in the vacuole (30Hicke L. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1215-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Casein kinase I-mediated phosphorylation is required for efficient constitutive endocytosis of the yeast mating pheromone receptors, Ste3p (31Panek H.R. Stepp J.D. Engle H.M. Marks K.M. Tan P.K. Lemmon S.K. Robinson L.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4194-4204Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and Ste2p (32Hicke L. Zanolari B. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), and the uracil permease, Fur4p (33Marchal C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Urban-Grimal D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), but it is still unknown whether casein kinase I phosphorylates these proteins. The replacement of serine residues by alanine in a PEST-like sequence of Fur4p (33Marchal C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Urban-Grimal D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and in a sequence surrounding a ubiquitination site of Ste2p (34Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) decreases the level of phosphorylation and ubiquitination of each protein. In this study, we show that Pdr5p, like Yor1p and Snq2p, is subjected to phosphorylation in vitro. This phosphorylation is abolished by mutations in the YCK1 and YCK2 genes encoding plasma membrane-bound casein kinase I isoforms. Loss of Yck1p and Yck2p function modulates the multiple drug resistance phenotype of Pdr5p. Phosphorylation probably protects Pdr5p against vacuolar degradation, as suggested by the abnormal instability of Pdr5p in the casein kinase I-deficient strains. The S. cerevisiae strains used are listed in Table I. The casein kinase I mutants, LRB266 (yck1Δ), LRB343 (yck2Δ), and LRB346 (yck1Δ yck2 ts), are isogenic to the parental strain, LRB341 (35Robinson L.C. Menold M.M. Garrett S. Culbertson M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2870-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The pep4::Kan Rnull allele (see below) was transformed into the LRB346 strain, using the lithium acetate method (36Kuo C.-L. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1730-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), to give the ROY1 strain. Geneticin-resistant transformants were isolated on YPD containing 200 μg/ml of Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Correct integration of the Kan R marker at the PEP4 target site was confirmed by PCR amplification of genomic DNA prepared from the Geneticin-resistant transformants (37Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene ( Amst. ). 1987; 57: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2020) Google Scholar). The yck1Δ(ADK1) and yck1Δ yck2 ts (ADK12) mutant strains were derived from AD124567 as follows. The 4.5-kilobase pairEcoRI/XhoI fragment of the pAD-ΔYCK1 plasmid carrying theyck1Δ::hisG::URA3::hisG null allele (see below) was used to replace the chromosomal YCK1gene of the AD124567 strain. Yeast transformants were grown overnight in rich medium and plated onto 5-fluoroorotic acid-containing medium to allow the isolation of ADK1 (yck1Δ::hisG) from the Ura− clones. The pL2.330-URA3 plasmid carrying theyck2 ts ::URA3 construct (see below) was then cut with SacI and XbaI and introduced into the ADK1 strain to replace the YCK2 gene with the yck2 ts allele, yielding the ADK12 strain. Correct gene disruption was checked by PCR as described above.Table IS. cerevisiae strains usedStrainGenotypeSourceIL125–2BMATα PDR1 his1Ref. 16Balzi E. Wang M. Leterme S. Van Dyck L. Goffeau A. J.

Solid media were supplemented with 2% Bacto-agar. For multiple drug resistance assays, cultures grown overnight at 23 °C in YD medium were spotted onto YD medium supplemented with 1 or 2 μg/ml cycloheximide; 500 or 750 μg/ml fluconazole; 15 or 20 μg/ml ketoconazole; or 0.1, 2, or 3 μg/ml miconazole using a 32-well replicator, and then the plates were incubated at 23 °C for 3 days. For determination of cycloheximide minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC), cultures were grown in minimal SD medium at 23 °C to a density of 1–2 × 107 cells/ml. Five μl of undiluted and 100-fold diluted samples were spotted onto YD or SD medium supplemented with increasing concentrations of cycloheximide, and the plates were incubated at 23, 28, or 37 °C for 3 days. To construct thepep4::Kan R null allele, the KanMX cassette in the plasmid pFA6a-kanMX6 (38Wach A. Yeast. 1996; 12: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR, using two 60-mer oligonucleotides, 5′- GCTTGAAAGCATTATTGCCATTGGCCTTGTTGTTGGTCAGCATCGATGAATTCGAGCTCGand 5′- GGCCAAACCAACCGCATTGTTGCCCAAATCGTAAATAGAAGGTCGACGGATCCCCGGGTT(the Kan R sequences are underlined; the flanking PEP4 sequences correspond to nucleotides 8–49 and 1166–1204, respectively, starting from the first ATG). PCR amplification of the YCK1 gene was performed on yeast genomic DNA, using the primers 5′-GGAATTCCTGCTTGCTTCTTACAAAC (EcoRI site underlined) and 5′-GCTCTAGAGCTTATGAGAAGCAGCTAG (HindIII site underlined). The resulting PCR fragment was cloned as an EcoRI/HindIII fragment into the pSK plasmid to give pSK-YCK1. An internal 0.76-kilobase pairBglII fragment of YCK1 was replaced by theBamHI/BglII-cut hisG-URA3-hisGcassette, yielding plasmid pAD-ΔYCK1. The YDp-U plasmid (39Berben G. Dumont J. Gilliquet V. Bolle P.-A. Hilger F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 475-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) was cut with SmaI and NheI. TheURA3-containing fragment was made blunt with Klenow and ligated into the ScaI-cut pL2.330 plasmid (35Robinson L.C. Menold M.M. Garrett S. Culbertson M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2870-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), yielding pL2.330-URA3. The ScaI site lies 169 nucleotides downstream of the yck2–2 ts coding sequence. Plasma membrane-enriched fractions were prepared from cells grown to late exponential phase as described previously (40Goffeau A. Dufour J.-P. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 528-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Lowry method (41Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Nucleoside triphosphatase activity was assayed at 35 °C in 100 μl of 6 mm NTP (ATP or UTP), 7 mm MgSO4, 10 mmNaN3, 50 mm Mes/Mops/Tris adjusted to the indicated pH with either HCl or NaOH (42Decottignies A. Kolaczkowski M. Balzi E. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12797-12803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rhodamine B accumulation and extrusion experiments were carried out as described previously (43Decottignies A. Grant A.M. Nichols J.W. de Wet H. McIntosh D.B. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12612-12622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Plasma membrane-enriched fractions containing 50 μg of protein were incubated for 15 min at 35 °C in 50 μl of 6 mmMgCl2, 10 mm NaN3, 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP (300 Ci/mmol), 17 mm Mes/Mops/Tris, at the indicated pH. The phosphorylation reaction was stopped by the addition of 25 μl of 3-fold concentrated Laemmli sample buffer (240 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 30% glycerol, 6% SDS, 3% dithiothreitol, 0.015% bromphenol blue) and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (PAGE), and then the gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography at −80 °C. In vitro phosphorylated plasma membranes (150 μg of protein) from the US50–18C and AD3 strains were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Gel bands corresponding to 32P-labeled ABC transporters (M r 160,000) and Pma1p (M r 100,000) were cut into small pieces, and the proteins were eluted onto a dialysis membrane by electrophoresis for 20 h at 121 V in 25 mm Tris, 192 mmglycine, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, pH 8.3 (HCl). The eluted proteins were hydrolyzed in 800 μl of 6 n HCl for 1.5 h at 110 °C, and then the hydrolysate was dried and redissolved in 3 μl of chromatography buffer (pyridine/AcOH/water, 10:100:1890) containing 1 mg/ml phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine. The amino acid residues were separated by thin layer isoelectric focusing for 45 min at 750 V on cellulose plates, using a double-chamber apparatus (Desaga, Germany). Then the positions of the radioactive residues and amino acid standards were detected by autoradiography at −80 °C and spraying with 0.2% ninhydrin in acetone, respectively (44Kolarov J. Kulpa J. Baijot M. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10613-10619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma membranes were incubated for 15 min at 56 °C in 200 μl of solubilization buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.25% SDS). After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge (4 °C), the solubilized membrane proteins were diluted 2.5 times with immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Hepes pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) containing 10 μl of polyclonal anti-Pdr5p antibodies 2A. Decottignies, unpublished data. that had been affinity-purified on polyvinylidene difluoride blots of Pdr5p protein separated by SDS-PAGE as described previously (45Pringle J.R. Adams A.E.M. Drubin D.G. Haarer B.K. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 565-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). After overnight incubation at 4 °C on an end-over-end stirrer, 20 μl of a 50% (v/v) suspension of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The immune complexes bound to the protein A-Sepharose beads were washed four times with immunoprecipitation buffer containing 0.1% SDS, resuspended in 15 μl of 3-fold concentrated Laemmli sample buffer, and heated to 56 °C for 15 min. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 1 min at room temperature in an Eppendorf centrifuge, plasma membrane and immunoprecipitate fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE (8% polyacrylamide gel), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell), and probed with purified polyclonal anti-Pdr5p or monoclonal mouse anti-ubiquitin (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) antibodies at respective dilutions of 1:2,000 and 1:200. Immunoreactive complexes were detected by chemiluminescence, using anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:25,000 dilution; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). When required, the bound antibodies were removed according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the membrane was reprobed with polyclonal anti-Pdr5p or anti-Pma1p antibodies (1:10,000 dilution) (46Capieaux E. Rapin C. Thinès D. Dupont Y. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21895-21900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described above. Cells were grown at 23 °C overnight in minimal SD medium to an optical density at 600 nm (A 600) of 0.5–1.0. Ten ml of cells were harvested, resuspended in 400 μl of SD and metabolically labeled by adding 215 μCi of Pro-Mix l-[35S] labeling mix (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and shaking at 23 °C for 15 min (pulse). After washing twice with SD medium containing 10 mml-methionine (chase medium), they were resuspended in 400 μl of chase medium and incubated at 23 or 28 °C to impose the yck1Δ yck2 ts block. Time point aliquots were transferred to chilled tubes containing 400 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin) and 400 μl of glass beads, and then the cells were lysed by vigorous vortexing (2 × 1.5 min with a 1-min cooling interval). SDS was then added to a final concentration of 0.25%, and the mixture was again vortexed (2 × 1 min). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge (4 °C) and diluted 2.5 times with immunoprecipitation buffer. Samples containing the same amount of trichloroacetic acid-insoluble labeled material were processed for immunoprecipitation, using 5 μl of polyclonal anti-Pdr5p serum, and SDS-PAGE analysis as described above. The relative intensity of the Pdr5p bands at each time point was quantified by scanning densitometry of the autoradiograms, using Imagemaster1D software (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or by phosphor imaging, using the Molecular Imaging System (Bio-Rad). The expression levels of several ABC transporters, including Pdr5p, Snq2p, and Yor1p, are abnormally high inpdr1–3 mutant strains (16Balzi E. Wang M. Leterme S. Van Dyck L. Goffeau A. J. Biol.

Plasma membrane-enriched fractions from the pdr1–3 strain, US50–18C, were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography (Fig. 1 A). Two major bands with molecular weights of 160,000 and 100,000 were found to be phosphorylated in vitro. The 100-kDa polypeptide was the plasma membrane H+-ATPase, Pma1p, previously shown to be phosphorylated by casein kinase I (48Estrada E. Agostinis P. Vandenheede J.R. Goris J. Merlevede W. François J. Goffeau A. Ghislain M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32064-32072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), whereas the 160-kDa band consisted of Pdr5p, Snq2p, and Yor1p, as the signal intensity was drastically decreased in the PDR1 wild-type IL125-2B strain, which does not overproduce these three ABC proteins (data not shown), and successive deletions of PDR5 (strain AD3),SNQ2 (strain AD23), and YOR1 (strain AD123) in the US50–18C strain resulted in a decreasing intensity of the 160-kDa signal (Fig. 1 A). The contribution of Yor1p to the degree of phosphorylation of the 160-kDa band was rather low, most likely reflecting differences in the relative abundance of Pdr5p, Snq2p, and Yor1p. We then examined the phosphorylation of plasma membranes prepared from the SUPERYOR strain (43Decottignies A. Grant A.M. Nichols J.W. de Wet H. McIntosh D.B. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12612-12622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), which contains multiple deletions of the ABC transporter genes, including SNQ2 and PDR5, and expressesYOR1 from the PDR5 promoter (PPDR5 ::YOR1). The phosphorylation level of Yor1p was increased in the SUPERYOR strain compared with theYOR1 wild-type AD234567 strain, and the labeled band was not detected in membranes from the yor1Δ derivative, AD1234567 (Fig. 1 B). Taken together, these results indicate that Pdr5p, Snq2p, and Yor1p are subject to phosphorylation in vitro. It is unlikely that thepdr1–3 mutation affects plasma membrane-bound kinase activity, since the level of Pma1p phosphorylation in thePDR1 wild type and pdr1–3 mutant strains is the same (data not shown). The 160-kDa band phosphorylated in the membranes of the PDR5 wild-type (US50–18C) and pdr5Δmutant (AD3) strains was eluted from polyacrylamide gels and subjected to acid hydrolysis. After electrophoresis on thin layer cellulose plates, the phosphorylated residues were identified as serine (Fig. 1 C). In a separate control experiment, in which the 100-kDa band was treated similarly, only phosphoserine residues were found, confirming the observation that Pma1p is phosphorylated on serine residues (44Kolarov J. Kulpa J. Baijot M. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10613-10619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49McDonough J.P. Mahler H.P. J. Biol.

Microsequencing of one peptide gave the sequence Gln412-Thr-Thr-Ala-Asp-Phe-Leu-Thr-Ser-Val421of Pdr5p, suggesting that Ser420 could be a target forin vitro phosphorylation. The sequence of the remaining peptides could not be determined because of low amount or incomplete purification. Phosphorylation of the 160-kDa band was higher at pH 7.6 than at pH 6.0 (Fig. 2 A). Interestingly, the signal intensity decreased upon the addition of Zn2+ ions, with complete inhibition of phosphorylation being seen at 0.6 mm (Fig. 2 B). No inhibition of phosphorylation was seen in the presence of 0.5 mm EGTA or 1 μm staurosporine, an inhibitor of protein kinase C (data not shown). However, there is no evidence suggesting the presence of protein kinase C activity in yeast plasma membranes (50Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Friedli L. Payton M.A. Paravicini G. J. Biol.

The survival and apoptotic responses of these cells were compared after exposure toN-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), a DNA-damaging agent that activates PARP, or to tumor necrosis factor-α, which causes apoptosis without initial DNA damage. In response to MNNG, the cells with caspase-uncleavable PARP were very resistant to loss of viability or induction of apoptosis. Most significantly, ∼25% of these cells survived and retained clonogenicity at a level of DNA damage that eliminated the cells with wild type PARP or PARP (−/−) cells. Expression of caspase-uncleavable PARP could not protect the cells from death induced by tumor necrosis factor, although there was a slower progression of apoptotic events in these cells. Therefore, one of the functions for cleavage of PARP during apoptosis induced by alkylating agents is to prevent survival of the extensively damaged cells.

One of the immediate responses to DNA damage in the higher eukaryotic cells is catalytic activation of PARP, which results in consumption of NAD and formation of the polymers of ADP-ribose (pADPr) on PARP itself and a few selected nuclear proteins that are involved in chromatin architecture and DNA-related metabolisms. This rapid reaction by PARP has been implicated in DNA base excision repair and in the maintenance of genomic integrity after DNA damage (reviewed in Refs. 1Lindahl T. Satoh M.S. Poirier G.G.

Two independently created PARP (−/−) mice with interruptions in different exons were shown to be highly susceptible to DNA-damaging agents such as γ-rays and alkylating agents (12Menissier-de Murcia J.

Despite the initial lack of consensus among different studies with PARP (−/−) models, it is now clearly emerging that PARP (−/−) cells have significant deficiencies in response to DNA damage. These cells inherently possess shorter telomere and unstable chromosomes (14Fagagna F. Hande M.P. Tong W.M. Lansdorp P.M. Wang Z.Q. Jackson S.P. Nat.

Recently, PARP (−/−) cells were shown to be specifically defective in long patch repair pathways of DNA base excision repair (17Dantzer F. Schreiber V. Niedergang C. Trucco C. Flatter E.

Thus, in response to low or moderate levels of DNA damage, the activity of PARP could help in DNA repair and cell survival. However, PARP may have a completely different function(s) when death responses are initiated. During the initial phase of apoptotic death, when the majority of the cellular proteins remain intact, PARP is one of the earliest proteins to be specifically cleaved to form two fragments of ∼89 and 24 kDa (20Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar). The 89-kDa fragment, although capable of the basal enzymatic activity due to presence of the catalytic domain (21Simonin F. Menissier-de Murcia J. Poch O. Muller S. Gradwohl G. Molinete M. Penning C. Keith G. de Murcia G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19249-19256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cannot be stimulated by the DNA strand breaks (20Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y.

The apoptosis-specific cleavage of PARP at the DEVD↓G site was shown to be due to a protease resembling interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (23Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2340) Google Scholar) that was identified as CPP32, Yama, or Apopain and later classified as caspase 3 (24Fernandes-Alnemri T.

Livingston D.J. Nicholson D.W. Salvesen G. Thornberry N.A. Wong W.W. Yuan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2132) Google Scholar). Although PARP cleavage has served as a sensitive analytical reporter for the activation of caspases or for the onset of apoptosis in various models of cell death, the physiological role for this cleavage is not known (28Duriez P.J. Shah G.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 29Scovassi A.I. Dengri M. Donzelli M. Rossi L. Bernardi R. Mandarino A. Frouin I. Negri C. Eur. J. Histochem. 1998; 42: 251-258PubMed Google Scholar). For many of the ∼50 other caspase targets, their cleavage serves different functions, such as inactivation of anti-apoptotic factors, activation of proapoptotic factors, or disassembly of cellular structures (30Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6136) Google Scholar). However, for some substrates such as PARP, DNA-dependent protein kinase, and DNA replication factor C, it has been assumed that disabling their normal survival functions in DNA repair and replication would facilitate cell death (30Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6136) Google Scholar, 31Rosen A. Casciola-Rosen L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Additionally, the cleaved fragments of PARP might acquire novel functions that could actively contribute to apoptosis. The caspase-induced cleavage of PARP might result in production of an enzyme with altered substrate specificity or subcellular localization. This altered enzyme might actively potentiate the apoptotic response. The 24-kDa fragment of PARP has been shown to bind to apoptotic fragments of DNA (32Smulson M.E. Pang D. Jung M. Dimtchev A. Chasovskikh S. Spoonde A. Simbulan-Rosenthal C. Rosenthal D. Yakovlev A. Dritschilo A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3495-3498PubMed Google Scholar), and this could facilitate death decisions by competing with any remaining intact PARP or other proteins for binding to strand breaks. The catalytic function of PARP is also implicated in cell death responses following massive amounts of DNA damage that are encountered during certain pathological conditions. A prolonged and high level of catalytic activation of PARP under these circumstances has been suggested to lead to cell death by energy deprivation due to depletion of NAD and ATP (33Berger N.A. Radiat. Res. 1985; 101: 4-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). This role of PARP is strongly supported by recent studies demonstrating resistance of PARP (−/−) neuronal, cardiac and pancreatic cells to death caused by extensive DNA damage with ischemia-reperfusion or streptozotocin (34Burkart V. Wang Z.Q. Radons J. Heller B. Herceg Z. Stingl L. Wagner E.F. Kolb H. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 35Eliasson M.J.L. Sampei K. Mandir A.S. Hurn P.D.

This function of PARP in cell death would be eliminated when it is cleaved by caspases, because the 89-kDa fragment of PARP cannot be stimulated in the presence of DNA breaks (20Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar, 22Shah G.M. Kaufmann S.H. Poirier G.G. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 232: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, PARP has been implicated in both the survival and death responses following DNA damage. PARP cleavage by caspases could play a crucial role in shifting the equilibrium between its two roles, and this can be explored in a model where PARP is rendered resistant to cleavage by caspase 3. The caspase-resistant PARP could strengthen the cellular responses to DNA damage, resulting in delayed cell death and possible survival of the damaged cells. On the other hand, uncleavable PARP could accelerate death by continued depletion of NAD and ATP. To distinguish between these alternatives, we have created stable cell lines that express either caspase-uncleavable mutant or wild type PARP in a PARP (−/−) fibroblast background. Our study for the first time compared the death and survival responses of these stable cell lines after exposure to alkylating DNA damage that activates PARP as part of the survival response or to tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which can cause apoptosis without initial DNA damage. We hypothesized that response of the cells expressing caspase-uncleavable PARP would be different in these two situations. In response to alkylating DNA damage, uncleaved PARP might have both survival and death functions, whereas in response to TNF-α it might serve only the death functions. Three recently reported studies used a similar approach and focused mainly on the death responses of cells expressing caspase-uncleavable PARP (38Oliver F.J. de la Rubia G. Rolli V.

As described later, one of these studies used a transient transfection approach (38Oliver F.J. de la Rubia G. Rolli V. Ruiz-Ruiz M.C. de Murcia G. Murcia J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33533-33539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), and the other two studies using stable cell lines focused mainly on the death responses after exposure to TNF-α or staurosporine (39Herceg Z.

Chem. 1999; 274: 22932-22940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), treatments that are not likely to involve survival functions of PARP induced by DNA damage. We report here that in response to moderate levels of DNA damage by the alkylating agent MNNG, cells expressing caspase-uncleavable PARP exhibit reduced cell death and increased cell survival under conditions where cells with wild type PARP are eliminated. When death is induced in the absence of initial DNA damage by TNF-α, the presence of the caspase-uncleavable PARP could not prevent the ultimate apoptotic demise of the cell, and in fact, the progression of apoptosis is slower than in the cells expressing wild type PARP. Tet-Off expression system, pPUR plasmid, and puromycin were from CLONTECH. Mouse TNF-α, FITC-dUTP, and deoxynucleotidyltransferase were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals.

Puromycin (5 or 2.5 μg/ml) and hygromycin (200 or 100 μg/ml) were freshly added during selection and maintenance of clones. HL-60 cells were grown in RPMI medium and induced to undergo apoptosis by treatment with 68 μmetoposide for 6 h (22Shah G.M. Kaufmann S.H. Poirier G.G. Anal.

Polymerase chain reaction site-directed mutagenesis was employed to obtain the D214A single-point mutation using human PARP cDNA as a template. Mutant cDNA was cloned in pZeoSV(+) (Invitrogen), expressed in DH5α, isolated with plasmid maxi kit (Qiagen), and sequenced in a 373 DNA Sequencer Stretch-XL (Applied Biosystems). It was confirmed to carry only the relevant GAT/GCT mutation when compared with wild type cDNA using MultAlin software. Mutant or wild type PARP cDNA was cloned in SacII-XbaI site of the pTRE, the second vector of Tet-Off system. Since PARP (−/−) cells carried geneticin resistance, “neo” (BglII-PstI) from the first vector pTet-Off was excised and replaced by puromycin resistance marker (PvuII-BamHI) from pPUR plasmid to create pTet-Off-Pur, a new first vector for the Tet-Off system. PARP (−/−) cells (clone A1) were transfected with pTet-Off-Pur by Ca3(PO4)2 protocol, and 60 puromycin-resistant clones were established. Clone A1.47, with the most stringent doxycyclin control, was transfected with pTRE, the second vector containing cDNA of either the wild type or D214A mutant human PARP along with pTK-Hyg plasmid to select double-transfectant clones. Although the Tet system has been reported to have excellent control over the expression of a variety of genes, none of our clones that express wild type or uncleavable PARP could maintain doxycyclin repression in culture beyond the eighth passage. Therefore, we performed all the experiments in absence of doxycyclin and selected several clones that upheld steady and high levels of expression of either uncleavable or wild type PARP up to passage 40. To minimize clone-specific effects, each study was repeated with at least 2–3 clones for each PARP phenotype: PARP (−/−) clones (A1, A11, and A1.47); PARP-D/A clones (A12, A18, and C9); human PARP-wt clones (B57, B60), murine PARP-wt cells (F20). After treatment with the DNA-damaging agent, cells were trypsinized, and viable cells were measured by their ability to exclude trypan blue dye. For clonogenicity, treated cells were washed with PBS, trypsinized, and seeded in quadruplicate at 250 or 1000 cells in 35-mm dishes. After 7 days, adherent cells were rinsed in PBS, fixed in methanol for 3–5 min, and stained with 1% crystal violet. An aggregate of >35 cells was scored as a colony (41Shah G.M. Poirier D.

Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of the distribution of cells in different phases of cell cycles was carried out by total DNA staining with propidium iodide and analyzed (10,000 events/assay) using a Coulter EPICS Elite with He-Cd laser (42Shah G.M.

In brief, floating and trypsinized adherent cells were pooled, washed in PBS, fixed for 15 min in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and permeabilized for 2 min at 4 °C in 3.9 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0 containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells washed in PBS containing 1% BSA were reacted for 30 min at 37 °C in 50 μl of TUNEL mixture containing 1× deoxynucleotidyltransferase reaction buffer (40 mmpotassium cacodylate, 40 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.8 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol), 1.2 μm FITC-dUTP, 3.02 μm dATP, 1 mm CoCl2, and 6.25 units of deoxynucleotidyltransferase enzyme.

The floaters and adherent cells were pooled after treatment, and an aliquot representing 0.5 × 106 cells was resolved on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were reacted with anti-caspase 3 (1:2,000) to detect the precursor procaspase 3 (p32) and its activated form p17 (46Huot J. Houle F. Rousseau S. Deschesnes R.G. Shah G.M. Landry J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1361-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Human PARP is cleaved by caspase 3 at the sequence Asp-Glu-Val-Asp214-Gly, and since a peptide containing a DEVAG site does not serve as a caspase substrate (23Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2340) Google Scholar), a mutant cDNA was created that encoded the caspase-uncleavable human PARP with mutation of the critical aspartate (Asp214) to alanine (Ala). Several stable clones were isolated that expressed caspase-uncleavable mutant PARP (PARP-D/A, clones A12, A18, and C9) or wild type PARP (PARP-wt, clones B57 and B60) in the PARP (−/−) background at a level comparable to murine PARP-wt expressed in the fibroblasts derived from the sibling mice (F20). In the PARP immunoblot (Fig. 1 A), PARP-D/A (lane 4) was observed to comigrate with human (lane 6) or murine (lane 5) wild type PARP. The nuclear localization of the PARP-D/A in the stable clones was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence (data not shown), in agreement with earlier studies (38Oliver F.J. de la Rubia G. Rolli V.

The catalytic and DNA damage sensor functions of PARP-D/A were analyzed from two different perspectives: its potential to make pADPr in vitro by an activity-Western blot method (Fig. 1 B) and the actual pADPr synthesis occurring in the cells expressing PARP-D/A by a polymer immunoblot method (Fig. 1 C). In the activity-Western blot (Fig. 1 B), a signal for automodified PARP-D/A immobilized at 113 kDa confirmed its basal catalytic function (lane 5), which could be stimulated in the presence of damaged DNA (lane 3). The capacity of PARP-D/A to form pADPr in the oxidant-exposed cells was quite similar to that of PARP-wt, as seen in the ADP-ribose polymer immunoblot (Fig. 1 C). Since PARP is the major acceptor for its own reaction, the signal for PARP automodified to varying degrees can be detected in the region of 113–200 kDa (1Lindahl T. Satoh M.S. Poirier G.G. Klungland A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 405-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 47Ruscetti T. Lehnert B.E. Halbrook J. Le Trong H. Hoekstra M.F. Chen D.J. Peterson S.R.

Within the first 5–15 min after exposure to 300 μm H2O2, cells expressing PARP-wt or PARP-D/A exhibited a strong signal in the region from 113–200 kDa (Fig. 1 C, lanes 7, 8,12, 13, and 17). In each of these clones, this signal was absent before (Fig. 1 C, lanes 6, 11, and 16) or 30 min after exposure to oxidant (lanes 9, 15, and 20). Similar rapid and transient formation of pADPr was detected in the PARP (wt or D/A) clones after exposure to 10–100 μm MNNG (data not shown). In contrast, PARP (−/−) cells exhibited no significant oxidant-induced changes in polymer signal in the region above 113 kDa (lanes 1–5). While examining the PARP (−/−) cells for activity of the PARP homologs, we observed an ∼70-kDa polypeptide that was weakly stimulated by DNA in the activity-Western blot (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2 versus 4 and3 versus 5). However, in the polymer immunoblot, the ∼70-kDa signal was observed in both untreated control and oxidant-exposed cells (Fig. 1 C, lanes 1 and3). Therefore, this polypeptide may contribute to very low basal levels of pADPr synthesis in PARP (−/−) cells, although, unlike the full-length PARP, it was not stimulated in response to oxidant damage. In summary, despite the presence of a mutation within its DNA binding domain, caspase-uncleavable D214A mutant PARP was a fully functional enzyme capable of translocating to the nucleus, becoming activated in response to DNA damage and rapidly forming pADPr. Its resistance to cleavage during apoptosis was confirmed in the studies described below. PARP function is likely to have a maximal impact on cell survival after exposure to DNA-damaging agents that activate the enzyme as part of responses involving base excision repair. This was demonstrated by the extreme susceptibility of PARP (−/−) mice to methylnitrosourea and γ-irradiation (12Menissier-de Murcia J. Niedergang C. Trucco C. Ricoul M. Dutrillaux B. Mark M. Javier-Olivier M.F. Masson M. Dierich A. LeMeur M. Walztinger C. Chambon P. de Murcia G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7303-7307Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). Therefore, cells expressing different forms of PARP were challenged for 2 h with 10–100 μm MNNG, an alkylating agent that activates PARP"

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether somatostatin increases glucocorticoid responsiveness by up-regulating glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression and signaling. Somatostatin promoted a time- and dose-dependent increase in [3H]dexamethasone binding to RAW 264.7 macrophages. Cell exposure to 10 nm somatostatin for 18 h promoted a 2-fold increase in the number of GR sites per cell without significant modification of the affinity. Analysis of GR heterocomplex components demonstrated that somatostatin increased the level of heat shock protein (Hsp) 90, whereas the level of GR remained almost unchanged. The increase in Hsp 90 was associated with a decrease in the cleavage of its carboxyl-terminal domain. Evidence for the involvement of calpain inhibition in this process was obtained by the demonstration that 1) somatostatin induced a dose-dependent decrease in calpain activity and 2) calpain inhibitors, calpain inhibitor I and calpeptin, both abolished the cleavage of Hsp 90 and induced a dose-dependent increase in [3H]dexamethasone binding. Increases in glucocorticoid binding after somatostatin treatment were associated with similar increases in the ability of GR to transactivate a minimal promoter containing two glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) and to interfere with the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Thus, the present findings indicate that somatostatin increases glucocorticoid binding and signaling by limiting the calpain-specific cleavage of GR-associated Hsp 90. This mechanism may represent a novel target for intervention to increase glucocorticoid responsiveness.

N. Engl. J. Med. 1983; 309: 1495-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar, 2Reichlin S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1983; 309: 1556-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Subsequently, somatostatin has been shown to have a widespread distribution and to participate in a variety of biological processes including inflammatory reaction. Immunoreactive somatostatin has been detected in the cytoplasm of macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells at the site of carrageenin-induced aseptic inflammation in rat (3Karalis K. Mastorakos G. Sano H. Wilder R.L. Chrousos G.P. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4133-4138Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Likewise, somatostatin and preprosomatostatin mRNA have been demonstrated in granuloma cells, mainly macrophages, surrounding parasites in mice infected with Schistosoma mansoni (4Elliott D.E. Blum A.M. Li J. Metwali A. Weinstock J.V. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3997-4003PubMed Google Scholar). Such an expression of somatostatin is thought to limit inflammatory processes. Indeed, in vivo administration of octreotide, a stable somatostatin analogue, decreases the volume and the leukocyte concentration of the exudate in carrageenin-induced inflammation (5Karalis K. Mastorakos G. Chrousos G.P. Tolis G. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2000-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and reduces granuloma size in Schistosomiasis mansoni (6Blum A.M. Metwali A. Mathew R.C. Cook G. Elliott D. Weinstock J.V. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3621-3626PubMed Google Scholar). A number of signaling events are potentially important in this anti-inflammatory response. Among them is the ability of somatostatin to interact with T cells (7Sreedharan S.P. Kodama K.T. Peterson K.E. Goetzl E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 949-952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), neutrophils, and macrophages to inhibit interferon-γ release (4Elliott D.E. Blum A.M. Li J. Metwali A. Weinstock J.V. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3997-4003PubMed Google Scholar), elastase release (8Adeyemi E.O. Savage A.P. Bloom S.R. Hodgson H.J. Peptides ( Elmsford ). 1990; 11: 869-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)1 binding (9Bermudez L.E. Wu M. Young L.S. Lymphokine Res. 1990; 9: 137-145PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. In addition, somatostatin participates in the anti-inflammatory actions of glucocorticoids. For instance, in the model of carrageenin-induced acute inflammation, administration of dexamethasone increases the expression of immunoreactive somatostatin in inflammatory cells, whereas administration of anti-somatostatin antiserum prevents the dexamethasone-mediated blockade of leukocyte accumulation (3Karalis K. Mastorakos G. Sano H. Wilder R.L. Chrousos G.P. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4133-4138Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms whereby somatostatin would induce glucocorticoid responsiveness in target cells remain unknown. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that somatostatin increases glucocorticoid responsiveness by up-regulating GR expression. This concept is supported by findings of a direct correlation between the concentration of GR in a target cell and the sensitivity of this cell to glucocorticoids (10Brönnegard M. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1996; 154: 28-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the cell concentration of GR has been already shown to be modulated by a number of mediators including glucocorticoids, cAMP-inducing agonists, and cytokines such as TNF-α and interleukin-2, -4, and -13 (11Dong Y.

This increase is not related to an increased expression of GR but represents a stabilization of GR-associated Hsp 90 due to calpain inhibition. The mouse cell line RAW 264.7 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Cells were grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. They were exposed to somatostatin (Sigma) and/ord-Phe-Cys-Tyr-d-Trp-Arg-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH2(CTAP, Bachem Biochimie, Voisins-le-Bretonneux, France),N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (Calpain inhibitor I, Sigma), or N-benzyloxycarbonyl-l-leucylnorleucinal (calpeptin, Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), orN-CBZ-Ile-Glu(O-t-butyl)-Ala-leucinal (Z-IE(O-t-Bu)A-leucinal, Sigma). Thioglycollate-elicited macrophages were harvested from the peritoneal cavity of 12-week-old BALB/c mice, as described previously (16Salkowski C.A. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 4041-4047PubMed Google Scholar). A whole cell binding assay was used to determine GR number and affinity in untreated and somatostatin-treated cells (16Salkowski C.A. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 4041-4047PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2.5% FBS in 24-well tissue culture dishes, at 106 cells per well. Subsequently, the medium was replaced with medium containing [3H]dexamethasone (85.0 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) together with or without unlabeled dexamethasone (Sigma). For Scatchard analysis, the concentration of [3H]dexamethasone ranged from 0.5 to 64 nm; for one-point binding assays, a saturating concentration of [3H]dexamethasone was used (32 nm). Unlabeled dexamethasone was used at a concentration of 10 μm. After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C, monolayers were washed 6 times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cells were lysed in 1n NaOH. Lysates were harvested and counted in a beta spectrometer. To quantitate GR mRNA levels, RPA was performed as described previously (17Escoubet B. Coureau C. Blot-Chabeau M. Bonvalet J.P. Farman N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1343-C1353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA was co-hybridized with radiolabeled probes for mouse GR, β-actin, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Mouse GR probe was synthesized by using a cDNA insert in Bluescript plasmid (generous gift from G. Schuetz, Heidelberg, Germany). This probe contains 307 nucleotides, of which 234 are protected by hybridization to the mGR mRNA (residues 2113–2347). Mouse β-actin probe was synthesized using a cDNA insert in PGEM-3 plasmid (generous gift from D. Alvarado, Paris, France). This probe contains 190 nucleotides, of which 135 are protected by hybridization to the β-actin mRNA (residues 696–833). Rat GAPDH probe was synthesized using a cDNA insert in a pBluescript plasmid (generous gift from C. Dani, Nice, France). This probe contains 183 nucleotides, of which 164 are protected by hybridization to the GAPDH mRNA (residues 707–871). The results were normalized and expressed as the GR mRNA/β-actin mRNA ratio or the GR mRNA/GAPDH mRNA ratio (arbitrary units). Total RNA was isolated using a commercially available kit (RNABle, Eurobio, Les Ulis, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA by using avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase (10 units/μl; Promega, Charbonnieres, France). Reverse-transcribed samples were analyzed for Hsp 84- and β-actin-specific cDNA by PCR amplification. Specific primers for Hsp 84 and β-actin were as follows: GAAGATTCCACTAACCGCCG (sense) and CCATTGTAGAGT-TGTCTCGC (antisense); CAAGGTGTGATGGTGGGAAT (sense) and GTCATCT-TTTCACGGTTGGC (antisense), respectively (18Tanaka Y. Kobayashi K. Kita M. Kinoshita S. Imanishi J. Curr. Eye Res. 1995; 14: 1125-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). PCR was performed in a 20-μl reaction volume containing Taq polymerase buffer, deoxynucleotide mixture (0.2 mm each), MgCl2 (2.5 mm), Taq DNA polymerase (0.5 units) (Promega), oligonucleotide primers (0.5 μmeach), and reverse-transcribed RNA. Complementary DNA was amplified in a temperature cycler as follows: 5 min at 94 °C, and 26 cycles of 45 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, with a final extension step of 10 min at 72 °C. Twenty six PCR cycles were found in the exponential phases of PCR amplification of both Hsp 84 and β-actin cDNA. Fifteen-μl samples of PCR products were analyzed on 2% agarose gels containing 0.2 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Densitometry of the bands was performed on the gels using an Imager scanner (Appligene, Illkirch, France) and NIH image densitometry software (version 1.44). The results were expressed as the ratio of the optical density of Hsp 84 band/β-actin band. Medium was removed from culture dishes, and RAW 264.7 cells were resuspended using a cell scraper in 1.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then pelleted by centrifugation (600 × g, 4 °C for 10 min), frozen at −70 °C for 4 h, thawed, and resuspended in 100 μl of ice-cold protease inhibitory buffer (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40). The lysate was centrifuged (4 000 × g, 4 °C for 30 min). A 10-μl portion of the supernatants was reserved for protein determination, and protein concentration in supernatant samples was adjusted with the protease inhibitory buffer. These samples were boiled for 3 min in Laemmli loading buffer and subjected to electrophoresis on a 7.5% polyacrylamide-SDS gel. Proteins were electroeluted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA) that was stained with Ponceau S (0.5% in 1% acetic acid) to ensure uniformity of loading and transfer. After destaining with water, the membrane was blocked for 18 h at 4 °C in 10% nonfat dry milk solution in phosphate-buffered saline + 0.1% Tween. GR was detected using a polyclonal antibody (1:100 dilution; Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO); Hsp 84 was detected using either a polyclonal antibody raised against the amino-terminal domain of the molecule (1:200 dilution; Affinity Bioreagents) or a polyclonal antibody raised against the carboxyl-terminal domain of the molecule (1:500 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and Hsp 86 was detected using a polyclonal antibody (1:2 000 dilution; Affinity Bioreagents). Primary antibody incubations were followed by incubations with peroxidase-labeled anti-IgG secondary antibody (1:20,000 dilution). Then the membrane was developed with the ECL detection reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The calpain-like activity was determined in intact cells, as described (19Bronk S.F. Gores G.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G744-G751PubMed Google Scholar). RAW 264.7 cells were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2.5% FBS in 6-well tissue culture dishes, at 5 × 106 cells per well. After the indicated culture period, the medium was replaced with Krebs-Ringer buffer solution (pH 7.4) containing 1.8 mmCaCl2 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 20 μmSuc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC (Calbiochem), a membrane-permeant calpain protease substrate. The incubation was continued for 10 min at 37 °C. AMC fluorescence was then determined in the supernatant at 360 nm excitation and 430 nm emission. An AMC (Sigma) standard curve was generated for each experiment. Calpain activity was expressed in picomoles of AMC released per min of incubation time per well. The measurement of AMC fluorescence in the supernatant was previously validated by demonstrating that AMC did not accumulate in cultured cells (19Bronk S.F. Gores G.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G744-G751PubMed Google Scholar). RAW 264.7 cells were incubated with or without 250 nm dexamethasone for 3 h and then stimulated with or without 1 μg/ml LPS for 1 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared by the method described previously (20Bellocq A. Suberville S. Philippe C. Bertrand F. Perez J. Fouqueray B. Cherqui G. Baud L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5086-5092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and were stored at −80 °C until analysis. Protein was determined by using the Bio-Rad reagent (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. EMSA was as described (20Bellocq A. Suberville S. Philippe C. Bertrand F. Perez J. Fouqueray B. Cherqui G. Baud L. J. Biol.

Schreck R. Bauerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 252-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RAW 264.7 cells were transfected with (GRE)2 TK luciferase, a glucocorticoid-inducible reporter plasmid containing a minimal promoter with two consensus GRE upstream of the gene for luciferase (generous gift from Dr. M.-G. Catelli, CNRS UPR 1524, Paris, France), using the DEAE-dextran procedure (22Selden R.F. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996: 9.2.1-9.2.6Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was assayed as described (23Bertrand F. Philippe C. Antoine P.J. Baud L. Groyer A. Capeau J. Cherqui G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24435-24441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Results are presented as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann Whitney Utest. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. To assess initially the sensitivity of RAW 264.7 cells to somatostatin, these cells were exposed for 24 h to varying concentrations of somatostatin before binding experiments with [3H]dexamethasone were performed. Somatostatin caused a dose-dependent increase in [3H]dexamethasone-specific binding (Fig. 1 A). Maximal effect was seen at a somatostatin concentration of 10 nm. For this concentration, increase in [3H]dexamethasone-specific binding appeared after 2 h of exposure and peaked at 8–24 h. In contrast, CTAP, a somatostatin analogue with low affinity for somatostatin receptors (24Kramer T.H. Shook J.E. Kazmierski W. Ayres E.A. Wire W.S. Hruby V.J. Burks T.F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1989; 249: 544-551PubMed Google Scholar) was inactive at concentrations ≤100 nm. To determine whether somatostatin treatment led to an increase in GR number or affinity, saturation binding and Scatchard analysis were performed (Fig. 1 B). Control RAW 264.7 cells demonstrated saturable [3H]dexamethasone binding. Pre-exposure of cells to 10 nm somatostatin for 18 h yielded a 2-fold increase in the average number of GR sites per cell (control cells 38,977 ± 3,893; somatostatin-treated cells 77,869 ± 8,304;p < 0.05) without significant increase in theK d value (control cells 28.3 ± 9.0 nm; somatostatin-treated cells 49.9 ± 21.3 nm; not significant). To investigate further the effect of somatostatin on glucocorticoid binding to monocytes/macrophages, a subset of experiments was repeated using peritoneal macrophages. Exposure of these cells to 10 nm somatostatin for 18 h also caused an increase in [3H]dexamethasone-specific binding (1.2-fold,p < 0.05 compared with untreated cells). As binding studies indicated that somatostatin increased the number of [3H]dexamethasone-binding sites, further analysis evaluated the effect of somatostatin on GR expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. Time course of the effect of 10 nm somatostatin on GR mRNA levels in RAW 264.7 cells was analyzed using a specific RPA. There were no significant changes in the GR mRNA/β-actin mRNA ratio or the GR mRNA/GAPDH mRNA ratio with somatostatin incubation up to 48 h (Fig. 2 A). Then, the dose-dependent effect of somatostatin on GR expression in RAW 264.7 cells was assessed using Western blot analysis. Exposure of cells for 18 h to somatostatin doses up to 10 nm did not affect GR protein expression visibly (Fig. 2 B). Above this concentration, GR protein levels fell slightly. In addition to GR, GR heterocomplex includes heat shock proteins Hsp 56, Hsp 70, and Hsp 90 (25Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21455-21458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Hsp 90 chaperone, i.e. Hsp 90α (Hsp 86) and/or Hsp 90β (Hsp 84) (26Moore S.K. Kozak C. Robinson E.A. Ullrich S.J. Appella E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5343-5351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), must be bound to GR for allowing the hormone binding domain to be in a ligand binding conformation (27Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar). Thus, to determine whether somatostatin might increase [3H]dexamethasone binding indirectly by up-regulating Hsp 90, somatostatin effect on Hsp 90 expression was determined at both the mRNA and protein levels. Time course of the effect of 10 nm somatostatin on Hsp 84 mRNA levels in RAW 264.7 cells was assessed using a semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis. There was no difference in the Hsp 84/β-actin ratio between control and somatostatin-treated cells (0.95 ± 0.28 and 0.84 ± 0.09, respectively, at 2 h; 0.93 ± 0.07 and 0.77 ± 0.14, respectively, at 6 h; 1.25 ± 0.22 and 1.12 ± 0.27, respectively, at 24 h). Then, the dose-dependent effect of somatostatin on Hsp 84 expression in RAW 264.7 cells was assessed using Western blot analysis. Hsp 84 was expressed in untreated RAW 264.7 cells as a protein with the expected molecular mass (∼84 kDa) and an additional protein with a lower molecular mass (∼75 kDa) (Fig. 3 A). Incubation of cells with somatostatin for 18 h resulted in an increase in 84-kDa protein and a dose-dependent disappearance of 75-kDa protein. Western blot analysis of Hsp 86 provided roughly identical results (Fig. 3 B). The results are taken as an indication that 1) the 75-kDa protein is a cleavage product of Hsp 90 and 2) somatostatin prevents this cleavage. Given that the polyclonal anti-Hsp 84 antibody used in Western blot analysis reacts with the amino-terminal domain of the molecule, the detectable cleavage product of Hsp 84 would include that domain. Thus, for comparison, additional Western blot analysis was performed with a polyclonal anti-Hsp 84 antibody directed against the carboxyl-terminal domain of the molecule. As illustrated in Fig. 3 C, no cleavage product could be detected with this antibody in untreated RAW 264.7 cells. Again incubation of these cells with somatostatin for 18 h resulted in a dose-dependent increase in 84-kDa protein. Thus, somatostatin promotes Hsp 90 stabilization by preventing the cleavage of its carboxyl-terminal domain. Based on the ability of purified calpain, a cytosolic calcium-activated cysteine protease, to cleave the carboxyl-terminal domain of mouse Hsp 90 (28Minami Y. Kimura Y. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Yahara I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1459-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), we evaluated whether somatostatin would promote Hsp 90 stabilization by blunting the activity of this enzyme. First, the fluorogenic calpain substrate Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC was used to determine the calpain-like protease activity in RAW 264.7 cells. Calpain activity was 214 ± 16 pmol/min/well in untreated cells. Calpain inhibitor 1 and calpeptin, two potent inhibitors of calpain activity, suppressed this enzyme activity. A kinetic analysis revealed that the addition of somatostatin (10 nm) resulted in a rapid decrease in calpain activity that peaked at 2 h (data not shown). Fig. 4 A depicts the dose response observed at this time point. Thereafter, the effect of calpain inhibitor 1 on Hsp 90 cleavage was assessed using Western blot analysis. Cell exposure to 10 μm calpain inhibitor 1 for 2 h prevented the appearance of the ∼75-kDa breakdown product (Fig. 4 B). The stabilization of Hsp 90 was associated with a significant increase in [3H]dexamethasone-specific binding (Fig. 5 A). RAW 264.7 cells were also exposed to somatostatin and calpain inhibitor I in combination (Fig. 5 B). The observation that somatostatin increased [3H]dexamethasone-specific binding to the same extent as the combination of somatostatin and calpain inhibitor I at maximally effective doses of each individual molecule supported a role for calpain inhibition in somatostatin response. Given that calpain inhibitor I might decrease the enzyme activity of the proteasome in addition to that of calpains (29Griscavage J.M. Wilk S. Ignarro L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3308-3312Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), we compared the response to calpeptin and to Z-IE(O-t-Bu)A-leucinal, two potent and more selective inhibitors of calpain and proteasome pathways, respectively. Calpeptin was more active than Z-IE(O-t-Bu)A-leucinal in increasing [3H]dexamethasone binding (Fig. 5 C), clearly indicating the importance of calpains in this process. We assessed whether the changes in glucocorticoid binding after somatostatin treatment were associated with changes in glucocorticoid signaling. Given that glucocorticoids regulate gene transcription via the binding of GR to GRE or the interaction of GR with different transcription factors (30Karin M. Cell. 1998; 93: 487-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), either signaling pathway was studied. First, to analyze the binding of GR to GRE, we used a reporter gene that contains two copies of the GRE. Exposure of RAW 264.7 cells transfected with (GRE)2 TK luciferase to dexamethasone for 24 h resulted in a dose-dependent increase in luciferase activity (Fig. 6 A). This response was enhanced (× 1.7) by the cell pre-exposure to 10 nm somatostatin. Second, we determined by EMSA the ability of dexamethasone to suppress the DNA binding activity of NF-κB. This regulation has been attributed to both induction of the IκBα inhibitory protein and direct interaction between the NF-κB heterodimer and the GR (31Scheinman R.I. Cogswell P.C. Lofquist A.K. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1995; 270: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar). Exposure of RAW 264.7 cells to LPS for 1 h increased DNA binding activity of NF-κB, as evidenced by the increased intensity of the retarded band (Fig. 6 B). Competition assay with the cold NF-κB oligonucleotide (Fig. 6 B) and supershifts performed with antisera to p50 and p65 (data not shown) revealed that this band was specific and involved the presence of p50·p65 heterodimers, respectively. Exposure of RAW 264.7 cells to dexamethasone led to a dose-dependent decrease in LPS-induced NF-κB activation. Somatostatin enhanced this response, solely at the lowest dose of dexamethasone tested. The data presented in this study show that somatostatin increases glucocorticoid binding and signaling in macrophages and that this response is associated with the stabilization of Hsp 90, a component of the GR heterocomplex. That somatostatin increases [3H]dexamethasone binding to RAW 264.7 macrophages confirmed that monocytes/macrophages may be a target for somatostatin. Previous studies have shown that exposure of human monocyte-derived macrophages and murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 to somatostatin decreases TNF-α responsiveness and chemotactic activity, respectively (9Bermudez L.E. Wu M. Young L.S. Lymphokine Res. 1990; 9: 137-145PubMed Google Scholar, 32Ahmed A.A. Wahbi A. Nordlind K. Kharazmi A. Sundqvist K.G. Mutt V. Liden S. Scand. J. Immunol. 1998; 48: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the current studies, the actions of somatostatin are probably mediated by specific somatostatin receptors as a somatostatin analogue with low affinity for somatostatin receptors was inactive. Five receptor subtypes have been cloned and shown to be coupled to a variety of signal transduction pathways including inhibition of adenylate cyclase, modulation of ionic conductance channels, and protein dephosphorylation (33Patel Y.C. Srikant C.B. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 8: 398-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To date, the identity of somatostatin receptors at the surface of monocytes/macrophages has not been reported. Scatchard analysis of the data indicated that somatostatin increased the number of binding sites for [3H]dexamethasone, whereas the GR binding affinity was not significantly affected. This might be related to a de novo synthesis of GR. Consistent with this hypothesis are the recent findings that somatostatin binds to the 86-kDa subunit of Ku autoantigen (p86-Ku) (34Le Romancer M. Reyl-Desmars F. Cherifi Y. Pigeon C. Bottari S. Meyer O. Lewin M.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17464-17468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The p86-Ku protein, which is localized at the cell surface and within both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, is involved in the positive control of GR gene transcription (35Warriar N. Pagé N. Govindan M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18662-18671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although no direct evidence exists, these findings suggest that somatostatin might promote GR gene transcription through the activation of p86-Ku. However, this mechanism seems unlikely in our model since somatostatin did not increase the steady state levels of GR mRNA and GR. Even GR level was slightly decreased by somatostatin at concentrations above 10 nm (Fig. 2 B). Several findings of the present study suggest that the effects of somatostatin on glucocorticoid binding are rather indirect effects on Hsp 90. The requirement of Hsp 90 for glucocorticoid binding to GR has been previously demonstrated (reviewed in Ref. 27Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar). Assembly of GR-Hsp 90 complexes promotes a folding change of the GR hormone binding domain so that the hydrophobic binding pocket becomes accessible to the ligand (36Dittmar K.D. Demady D.R. Stancato L.F. Krishna P. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21213-21220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In the mouse, GR binds homodimers of Hsp 86 or Hsp 84 or heterodimers of Hsp 86 and Hsp 84 (27Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar). In our study, Western blotting analysis using an antibody directed against the carboxyl-terminal domain of Hsp 84 revealed only one molecular form of Hsp 84 with the predicted molecular weight, whereas Western blotting analysis using an antibody directed against the amino-terminal domain of Hsp 84 revealed two distinct molecular forms of Hsp 84 with a molecular mass of ∼84 and ∼75 kDa, respectively (Fig. 3). This indicates that a part of Hsp 84 molecules are truncated leading to the formation of shorter molecules including the amino-terminal domain. Somatostatin diminished the amount of 75-kDa protein in parallel with an increase in the amount of intact 84-kDa protein. This suggests that somatostatin inhibits the cleavage of the Hsp 84 carboxyl-terminal domain. Since the carboxyl-terminal 10–15-kDa region of Hsp 84 contains both the dimerization site (28Minami Y. Kimura Y. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Yahara I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1459-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and the domain that interacts with the hormone binding domain of GR (27Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar), somatostatin would enhance the assembly of GR·Hsp 84 complexes. As a consequence, somatostatin would increase the level of high affinity species of GR through the conversion of nonbinding to binding species. A second central finding of this study was that the marked stabilization of Hsp 84 induced by somatostatin was associated with a decrease in calpain activity. There are two major isoforms of calpain, μ and m, which require micro- and millimolar Ca2+concentrations for activity in vitro, respectively (37Croall D.E. Demartino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Purified μ- and m-calpain have been reported previously to cleave the carboxyl-terminal domain of purified Hsp 84 (28Minami Y. Kimura Y. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Yahara I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1459-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This probably reflects the ability of Hsp 90 isoforms to bind calmodulin (38Minami Y. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Yahara I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9604-9610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a characteristic shared by various calpain substrates (39Wang K.K.W. Villalobo A. Roufogalis B.D. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 693-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Our study adds to these data by demonstrating the importance of endogenous calpains. Calpain inhibitors both prevented Hsp 84 cleavage and increased [3H]dexamethasone binding. In combination, calpain inhibitor I and somatostatin had no additive effects. Therefore, the cause for the observed stabilization of Hsp 84 and increase in [3H]dexamethasone binding relates to activities that are common to both calpain inhibitor I and somatostatin, i.e. calpain inhibition. The finding that somatostatin blunted calpain activity in RAW 264.7 cells provided further evidence for this mechanism. The complex control of calpain activity affords many potential sites for a regulatory action of somatostatin. First, calpains co-exist in cells with calpastatin that functions as an inhibitor with high affinity and specificity for calpains (37Croall D.E. Demartino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). The amount of this inhibitor and its relative concentration with respect to calpains modulate the activity of calpains. Thus, somatostatin might affect the abundance of calpains and/or calpastatin by modifying the transcription of either gene. However, modulating enzyme activity through changes in transcription represents a relatively slow regulatory mechanism. The rapid kinetics of calpain inhibition by somatostatin (<2 h) favor a more direct mechanism such as post-translational modification by specific phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of calpains or calpastatin. In line with this interpretation, observations argue strongly that phosphorylation can alter calpastatin function (40Cong M. Thompson V.F. Goll D.E. Antin P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 660-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and possibly calpain function (37Croall D.E. Demartino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). In addition, somatostatin might modify the phosphorylation status of calpain substrate that affects the sensitivity to calpain cleavage (41Kimura Y. Koga H. Araki N. Mugita N. Fujita N. Takeshima H. Nishi T. Yamashima T. Saido T.C. Yamasaki T. Mozitake K. Saya H. Nakao M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 915-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Finally, the possibility exists that somatostatin binding to RAW 264.7 cells leads to a fall in Ca2+ influx (33Patel Y.C. Srikant C.B. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 8: 398-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), thereby allowing a decrease in calcium-dependent activity of calpains. By contrast with somatostatin, glucocorticoids are believed to up-regulate the activity of calpains. Increases in calpain gene transcription and calpain expression contribute to this regulation in a tissue- or a cell-specific manner (42Deshpande R.V. Goust J.-M. Chakrabarti A.K. Barbosa E. Hogan E.L. Banik N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2497-2505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 43Hong D.H. Forsberg N.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 108: 199-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 44Squier M. Miller A. Malkinson A. Cohen J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 159: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 45Walker G. Pfeilschifter J. Kuntz D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16679-16687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus, our data imply that glucocorticoids could limit their own binding to GR by up-regulating calpain activity. Somatostatin would prevent such a negative feedback. GR association with the Hsp 90 complex modifies GR folding and, hence, gives rise to a molecular conformation with a high affinity for the ligand. However the Hsp 90 association also inactivates GR, either by docking GR heterocomplex in cytoplasmic structures or by inhibiting GR binding to GRE (27Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar, 46Cadepond F. Schweizer-Groyer G. Segard-Maurel I. Jibard N. Hollenberg S.M. Giguère V. Evans R.M. Baulieu E.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5834-5841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is recent evidence that the latter inhibitory function of Hsp 90 prevails when Hsp 90/GR ratio is highly increased, especially in the nucleus (47Kang K.I. Meng X. Devin-Leclerc J. Bouhouche I. Chadli A. Cadepond F. Baulieu E.-E. Catelli M.-G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1439-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Thus, whether Hsp 90 accumulation following calpain inhibition increases glucocorticoid responsiveness in addition to glucocorticoid binding was questionable. Actually, exposure of RAW 264.7 cells to somatostatin promoted a substantial increase in dexamethasone-mediated transcriptional activation (Fig. 6 A). Furthermore, somatostatin synergistically increased the repressive effects of dexamethasone on DNA binding of NF-κB (Fig. 6 B). Together these findings indicate that, upon somatostatin treatment, the rise of Hsp 90/GR ratio is sufficient to increase glucocorticoid binding to GR but not to decrease GR activity. In conclusion, the data presented demonstrate that somatostatin may participate in the anti-inflammatory actions of glucocorticoids by increasing the binding of glucocorticoids to GR. A mechanism by which somatostatin may mediate these effects is through a decrease in the calpain-specific cleavage of Hsp 90, a component of the GR heterocomplex. Thus, our results also strongly support the concept that calpain inhibition may offer a new and exciting possibility for enhancing glucocorticoid efficiency toward inflammatory reaction.

Different T3R isoforms are expressed in a tissue-specific and developmentally regulated manner. The T3Rα-1, β-0, and β-1 isoforms typically repress target gene expression in the absence of hormone and activate transcription in the presence of hormone. Intriguingly, however, the T3Rβ-2 isoform fails to repress, and instead is able to activate transcription in both the absence and presence of hormone. We investigated the molecular mechanism behind this absence of repression by T3Rβ-2. Repression by T3Rα-1, β-0, and β-1 is mediated by the ability of these isoforms to physically recruit a SMRT/N-CoR corepressor complex. We determined that the unliganded T3Rβ-2 also recruits the SMRT corepressor; in contrast to the α-1, β-0, and β-1 isoforms, however, the T3Rβ-2 protein interacts not only with the C-terminal “receptor-interaction domain” of SMRT, but also makes additional contacts with the N-terminal “silencing domain” of the SMRT corepressor. These additional, T3Rβ-2-specific contacts interfere with the subsequent association of SMRT with mSin3, a crucial second subunit of the corepressor holo-complex. Our results suggest that T3Rβ-2 regulates transcription through a novel anti-repression mechanism, recruiting SMRT, but preventing the subsequent formation of a functional corepressor complex.

Reflecting this common mode of action, nuclear hormone receptors also share a common structural architecture composed of a central DNA binding domain and a C-terminal hormone binding domain, flanked in turn by more divergent N-terminal and “hinge” regions (Fig. 1). Embedded within this global domain structure are additional amino acid motifs responsible for receptor nuclear localization, for transcription regulation, and for interactions of the receptor with a variety of accessory and modulatory proteins (1Beato M.

Notably, many nuclear hormone receptors are expressed from more than one locus, and/or are subject to alternative mRNA splicing so as to generate a series of distinct, although interrelated receptor “isoforms.” Thyroid hormone receptors (T3Rs),1 for example, are encoded by two distinct loci, denoted α and β, and each locus can in turn be expressed as alternatively spliced isoforms, α-1 and α-2, or β-0 (in birds), β-1, and β-2 (Fig. 1). Different receptor isoforms are synthesized in a developmentally regulated and cell-specific manner; T3Rβ-2 expression, for example, is restricted principally to the pituitary, hypothalamus, and a few other tissues, whereas the T3Rα-1 and T3Rβ-0/1 isoforms are more broadly expressed (8Forrest D.

Many nuclear hormone receptors have bimodal transcriptional properties, and can either repress or activate expression of a given target gene depending on the hormone status, nature of the promoter, and the cell context. Particularly well characterized is the ability of the T3Rα-1, β-0, and β-1 isoforms to repress transcription of many of their target genes in the absence of hormone, and to activate transcription of these same target genes in the presence of hormone (see, e.g., Refs. 15Baniahmad A.

These bipolar regulatory properties are closely linked to the ability of these receptors to recruit accessory proteins, denoted corepressors and coactivators, that help mediate the actual transcriptional response (reviewed in Ref. 22Horwitz K.B.

Different receptor isoforms can display distinct functions. For example, in contrast to the bipolar regulatory properties of the T3Rα-1, β-0, and β-1 isoforms described above, the T3Rβ-2 isoform does not repress, and can even activate, certain promoters in the absence of hormone; addition of thyroid hormone simply further enhances this hormone-independent activation (21Sjoberg M. Vennstrom B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4718-4726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Hollenberg A.N. Monden T. Madura J.P. Lee K. Wondisford F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28516-28520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We wished to better understand why the unliganded T3Rβ-2 isoform fails to repress transcription. We report here that T3Rα-1, T3Rβ-0, T3Rβ-1, and T3Rβ-2 all strongly interact with the SMRT corepressor in the absence of hormone; the T3R-β2 isoform, however, makes additional contacts with domains of the SMRT corepressor that are not contacted by the T3Rα-1, T3Rβ-0, or T3Rβ-1 forms. These additional T3Rβ-2 contacts overlap the silencing domains of the SMRT polypeptide and inhibit the ability of the SMRT protein to recruit the mSin3 subunit of the corepressor complex. Conversely, disruption of this inhibitory interaction of the T3Rβ-2 N terminus with the SMRT silencing domain, using any of a variety of experimental modalities, converts the unliganded T3Rβ-2 into a transcriptional repressor, analogous in its properties to those of the T3Rα, β-0, or β-1 isoforms. Our results therefore suggest a novel “anti-repression” model in which the T3Rβ-2 receptor recruits SMRT, but prevents SMRT-mediated repression by preventing assembly of a functional corepressor complex. This model of anti-repression may extend to other members of the nuclear hormone receptor family, or to other families of transcriptional repressors that also mediate their actions through the SMRT/N-CoR corepressor complex. GlutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusions were constructed by using a pGEX-KG vector and inserting target DNA representing full-length TFIIB, codons 1–214 of mSin3A, codons 404–545 of mSin3A, codons 1–101 of T3Rβ-1, codons 1–107 of T3Rβ-2, or various domains of SMRT (35Wong C.-W.

The recombinant plasmids were transformed intoEscherichia coli strain DH5α, and the resulting GST fusion proteins were purified and immobilized by binding to glutathione-conjugated agarose beads (41Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). [35S]Methionine-radiolabeled proteins were synthesized by employing pSG5-, pCMV-, or pVZ-based plasmids in a coupled in vitro transcription/translation (TnT) system (Promega). The35S-labeled proteins were subsequently incubated with 25 μl of the GST protein-agarose matrix for 2 h at 4 °C in 300 μl of HEMG buffer (40 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1× Complete Proteinase Inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) (27Sande S.

The agarose matrix was then washed four times with 500 μl each of HEMG buffer lacking proteinase inhibitors and bovine serum albumin. Radiolabeled proteins remaining bound to the matrix were eluted with 10 mm free glutathione and were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (27Sande S.

The electrophoretograms were visualized and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics Storm System). For competition experiments codons 1–101 of T3Rβ-1, codons 1–107 of T3Rβ-2, or codons 404–545 of mSin3A were inserted into pMAL-c2. The plasmids were introduced into E. coli DH5α and the resulting maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion polypeptides were induced and were purified using the manufacturer's protocol (New England Biolabs). COS-1 cells were transfected by a LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) methodology. Approximately 2.5 × 105 cells were transfected with 750 ng of a pCR-SMRT plasmid and a pSG5-GAL4AD-HA plasmid containing no insert, codons 1–101 of T3Rβ-1, or codons 1–107 of T3Rβ-2. The transfected cells were incubated for 36 h and harvested into lysis buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mg/ml iodoacetamide, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Complete Protease Inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation, incubated with anti-HA-directed antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C, 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose was added to each sample, and the incubation was continued for 1 h. The immune complex was collected by centrifugation, extensively washed in lysis buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, using a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against the SMRT C-terminal domain. NotI site substitution mutants of T3Rβ-2 were constructed by a polymerase chain reaction protocol using standard recombinant DNA techniques (44Yoh S.M. Chatterjee V.K.K. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 470-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were devised to substitute four native codons, spaced every 10 amino acids within the T3Rβ-2 N terminus, with a GCT GCG GCC GCT sequence, representing the introduction of four alanines and a novel NotI restriction site. Subsequent NotI cleavage and ligation permitted the generation of defined deletions between any two of the alanine substitution mutations. Creation of the Y61F/Y65F double substitution mutation within the T3Rβ-2 N terminus was through an analogous oligonucleotide-directed, polymerase chain reaction technique (44Yoh S.M. Chatterjee V.K.K. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 470-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Transfections of CV-1 cells were performed by a liposome/Lipofectin methodology (Life Technologies, Inc.). Approximately 5 × 104 cells were transfected with 20 ng of a pSG5-T3Rα, pSG5-T3Rβ-0, pSG5-T3Rβ-1, or pSG5-T3Rβ-2 plasmid, 50 ng of pCH110 as an internal control, and 100 ng of a pTK-DR4-luciferase reporter (43Hong S.-H.

Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 470-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). For certain experiments, a pSG5-mSin3A expression vector was also incorporated. Additional pUC18 plasmid was used to normalize the total DNA to 500 ng/transfection. The cells were placed into either hormone-depleted medium, or medium containing 100 nm T3-thyronine and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. The cells were subsequently harvested, and the luciferase activity was determined relative to β-galactosidase activity (42Wong C.-W. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5724-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 43Hong S.-H. David G. Wong C.-W. Dejean A. Privalsky M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It has been reported that the neither the avian nor the mammalian β-2 isoform of T3R represses target gene expression, but instead either has no effect on target gene transcription in the absence of hormone, or displays a hormone-independent transcriptional activation that is further enhanced on addition of hormone (21Sjoberg M. Vennstrom B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4718-4726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Hollenberg A.N. Monden T. Madura J.P. Lee K. Wondisford F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28516-28520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To confirm this phenomenon, we employed transient transfections of CV-1 cells to examine the ability of the different T3R isoforms to modulate expression of a suitable T3R-responsive luciferase reporter gene. CV-1 cells contain little or no endogenous T3Rs, and exhibited little or no hormone regulation of luciferase expression when this reporter construct was introduced alone (Fig. 2). As expected from prior work (21Sjoberg M. Vennstrom B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4718-4726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), introduction of the T3Rα-1, β-0, or β-1 isoforms led to repression of reporter gene expression in the absence of hormone (Fig. 2, A and B). In clear contrast, however, introduction of the T3Rβ-2 isoform did not repress reporter gene expression in the absence of hormone; instead, the unliganded T3Rβ-2 either had no effect on luciferase expression or had a slight stimulatory activity when compared with the basal levels of reporter expression observed in the absence of an introduced receptor (Fig. 2and data not shown). Also as expected, addition of hormone led to stimulation of reporter gene expression by all the T3R isoforms tested (Fig. 2 B and data not shown). Our results confirm that the T3Rβ-2 isoform exhibits unique transcriptional regulatory properties, and in contrast to other T3R isoforms, fails to repress transcription in the unliganded state. We wished to determine the molecular basis for the failure of the T3Rβ-2 isoform to repress gene transcription. We first tested if the T3Rβ-2 isoform was able to interact with the SMRT corepressor, given that the recruitment of SMRT is crucial for repression by the other T3R isoforms (25Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar, 26Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamel Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

We initially employed a “GST-pull-down” methodology. GST fusions, representing different domains of SMRT, were immobilized by binding to glutathione agarose. The various immobilized SMRT derivatives were then incubated with the radiolabeled T3R, and the T3R protein bound to the SMRT matrix was subsequently eluted, detected by SDS-PAGE, and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis (Fig. 3). Although unable to repress in vivo, the T3Rβ-2 isoform nonetheless interacted strongly with the C terminus of SMRT (codons 1086–1495) (Fig. 3); this region of SMRT has previously been identified as the principal site of interaction of corepressor with the nuclear hormone receptors (Fig. 1). The SMRT/T3Rβ-2 interaction was comparable in intensity to those observed between SMRT and T3Rα-1, T3Rβ-0, or T3Rβ-1 (Fig. 3). Also in common with these other isoforms, the interaction of the T3Rβ-2 with the SMRT (codons 1055–1495) domain was inhibited by the addition of thyroid hormone (Fig. 3; compare solid to diagonal fill bars). None of the T3R isoforms tested interacted with a non-recombinant GST construct employed as a negative control, or with a GST fusion representing an internal domain (codons 751–1074) of SMRT (Fig. 3). Intriguingly, however, the T3Rβ-2 isoform did bind to a domain within the N-terminal domain of SMRT that was not contacted by the other T3R isoforms. This novel, T3Rβ-2-specific contact mapped to amino acids 566–680 of SMRT (Fig. 3) and overlaps a region in the N terminus of SMRT crucial for SMRT-mediated transcriptional silencing (Fig. 1). It would appear likely that the ability of T3Rβ-2, but not β-0 or β-1, to interact with the SMRT silencing domain reflects the divergent nature of the N termini of the different isoforms, given that the DNA-binding and hormone-binding domains of these isoforms are identical (Fig. 1). Notably, the N terminus of T3Rβ-0 is highly truncated relative to that of β-2 (Fig. 1), suggesting that the T3Rβ-2 N terminus might serve to stabilize the interaction with the SMRT silencing domain, rather than the N terminus of the other isoforms acting to inhibit this interaction. Supporting this conclusion, an artificially truncated T3Rβ2 product, lacking an N-terminal domain (Fig. 4, denoted T3Rβ2-t), failed to bind to the SMRT (codons 566–680) silencing domain, whereas the full-length T3Rβ-2 translation product, employed in the same assay, did bind to the SMRT silencing domain (Fig. 4). As expected, both the full-length and truncated T3Rβ2 forms bound to the SMRT C-terminal (codons 1086–1495) domain (Fig. 4); this interaction is mediated by the C-terminal receptor domain that is retained in both T3Rβ-"

We have partially purified a 105-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein from platelets stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and obtained the sequence of an internal 12-mer peptide derived from this protein. The sequence was identical to human α-actinin sequences deposited in the Swiss Protein Database. α-Actinin, a 105-kDa protein in platelets, was subsequently purified from activated platelets by four sequential chromatographic steps. Fractions were analyzed by Western blotting and probed with α-actinin and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. The distribution of α-actinin and pp105 overlapped throughout the purification. Furthermore, in the course of this purification, a 105-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein was only detected in fractions that contained α-actinin. The purified α-actinin protein was immunoprecipitated with antibodies to phosphotyrosine in the absence but not in the presence of phenyl phosphate. α-Actinin resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of activated platelet lysates was recognized by the antibodies to phosphotyrosine, whereas pretreatment of the platelets with bisindolylmaleimide, a protein kinase C inhibitor that prevents tyrosine phosphorylation of pp105, inhibited the reactivity of the antibodies to phosphotyrosine with α-actinin. Taken together, these data demonstrate that a fraction of α-actinin is tyrosine-phosphorylated in activated platelets. The integrin αIIbβ3 mediates tyrosine phosphorylation of a 105-kDa protein (pp105) in activated platelets. We have partially purified a 105-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein from platelets stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and obtained the sequence of an internal 12-mer peptide derived from this protein. The sequence was identical to human α-actinin sequences deposited in the Swiss Protein Database. α-Actinin, a 105-kDa protein in platelets, was subsequently purified from activated platelets by four sequential chromatographic steps. Fractions were analyzed by Western blotting and probed with α-actinin and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. The distribution of α-actinin and pp105 overlapped throughout the purification. Furthermore, in the course of this purification, a 105-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein was only detected in fractions that contained α-actinin. The purified α-actinin protein was immunoprecipitated with antibodies to phosphotyrosine in the absence but not in the presence of phenyl phosphate. α-Actinin resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of activated platelet lysates was recognized by the antibodies to phosphotyrosine, whereas pretreatment of the platelets with bisindolylmaleimide, a protein kinase C inhibitor that prevents tyrosine phosphorylation of pp105, inhibited the reactivity of the antibodies to phosphotyrosine with α-actinin. Taken together, these data demonstrate that a fraction of α-actinin is tyrosine-phosphorylated in activated platelets. phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate monoclonal antibody phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase high pressure liquid chromatography polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Tyrosine phosphorylation of protein substrates is central to all cellular processes that are regulated by the integrin family of extracellular matrix receptors (1Hynes R.O.

The array of responses regulated by integrins is greatly simplified in platelets that are enucleated, terminally differentiated cells. Platelets, therefore, provide a useful model system to study integrin-mediated protein tyrosine phosphorylation events that are closely linked to cell shape change and the underlying cytoskeleton organization. A rapid increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation is detected within seconds to minutes of platelet activation by soluble agonists such as thrombin or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)1 (7Shattil S.J.

In platelets stimulated by thrombin, PMA, or adhesion to fibrinogen, a second wave of protein tyrosine phosphorylation that is strictly dependent on both ligand binding to the αIIbβ3 integrin receptor and the cytoskeleton organization is observed (7Shattil S.J.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of two additional proteins of 101 and 105 kDa (pp101 and pp105) is also detected in platelets that aggregate following stimulation with an agonist such as PMA and in platelets adherent and spread on fibrinogen (9Haimovich B.

Both platelet aggregation and adhesion to fibrinogen are mediated by the integrin αIIbβ3. Platelet spreading on fibrinogen and tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125FAK, pp101, and pp105 are inhibited by protein kinase C, PI3-kinase, and phospholipase A2 enzyme(s) (21Haimovich B. Kaneshiki N.

The goal of this study was to isolate and characterize pp105. To this end, a 105-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein was partially purified from platelets stimulated with PMA and subjected to microsequencing. The sequence of an internal 12-mer peptide derived from the partially purified protein was identical to human α-actinin sequences deposited in the Swiss Protein Database. Consistent with the possibility that α-actinin is tyrosine-phosphorylated in platelets, α-actinin tyrosine phosphorylation was recently reported in other experimental systems (26Egerton M. Moritz R.L. Druker B. Kelso A. Simpson R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 666-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 27Mukai H. Toshimori M. Shibata H. Takanaga H. Kitagawa M. Miyahara M. Shimakawa M. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4740-4746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To further confirm the identity of pp105 as α-actinin, α-actinin was purified from activated platelets by four sequential chromatographic steps. The purified protein was recognized and immunoprecipitated by antibodies to phosphotyrosine. In addition, the antibodies to phosphotyrosine recognized α-actinin resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of activated platelet lysates. Collectively, these data demonstrate that a fraction of α-actinin is tyrosine phosphorylated in activated platelets. Human platelets were isolated by gel filtration from freshly drawn blood anticoagulated with 0.15 volumes of NIH formula A acid-citrate-dextrose solution supplemented with 1 μm prostaglandin E1 and 1 unit/ml apyrase as described previously (9Haimovich B. Lipfert L. Brugge J.S. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15868-15877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Platelet concentration was adjusted to 2–5 × 108 platelets/ml in an incubation buffer containing 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 3.3 mmNaH2PO4, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Platelet adhesion to fibrinogen (100 μg/ml) was studied in electrically untreated polystyrene plates pre-coated with the specific protein and blocked with bovine serum albumin as described previously (9Haimovich B. Lipfert L. Brugge J.S. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15868-15877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To purify large amounts of protein, platelets were isolated as described above from 1 to 2 units of outdated platelets that were purchased from the New Jersey Blood Bank. The isolated platelets were activated for 20 min with 10 nm PMA. Platelet aggregates were collected by 5 min of centrifugation at 800 × g. The platelet pellet from each unit was resuspended in 20 ml of buffer containing 0.02% Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (lysis buffer) and lysed by sonication. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. Insoluble material was removed by 15 min of centrifugation at 15,000 × g. Ammonium sulfate was added sequentially to the supernatant to yield final concentrations of 10, 20, 30, and 40%. At each step the solution was mixed for at least 45 min prior to a 15-min centrifugation at 15,000 × g. Proteins precipitated in the presence of 10, 20, 30, and 40% ammonium sulfate were reconstituted in lysis buffer and dialyzed extensively. All fractions were subsequently centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 × g. Duplicate samples from each fraction were analyzed by Western blots probed with the mAb to phosphotyrosine, 4G10, and by silver staining of gels. Most, if not all tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins precipitated in the presence of less than 40% ammonium sulfate. The proteins re-solubilized and dialyzed following precipitation with 30% and 40% ammonium sulfate were combined and applied to a DEAE-Sepharose ion exchange column (1.0 × 4 cm) pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer. Proteins retained on the column were eluted with a step gradient of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1 m NaCl prepared in lysis buffer (two column volumes were used for each NaCl concentration). Proteins eluted off the DEAE column were dialyzed, concentrated, and analyzed by Western blots probed with mAb 4G10. Subsequently, proteins contained in the fractions eluted with 0.8 and 1 m NaCl were combined and Western-blotted onto an Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was stained with India ink, and the 105-kDa region was excised. Protein digestion with endoproteinase Lys-C, HPLC fractionation, and internal peptide sequencing were carried out by the microsequencing facility at the Rockefeller University (28Fernandez J. DeMott M. Atherton D. Mische S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). α-actinin was purified from two units of outdated platelets. Platelets were isolated by gel filtration and stimulated for 20 min with 50 nm PMA. A purification flow chart is shown in Fig. 3. Platelet aggregates were collected by 5 min of centrifugation at 800 × g. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 9.0, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mmCaCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4 and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (buffer 1). The activated platelets were lysed by sonication. The lysate was cleared by 20 min of centrifugation at 17,000 × g. The resulting supernatant was resolved by gel filtration on a Sephacryl 300-HR column (1.6 × 70 cm) at a constant flow of 0.32 ml/min in buffer 1. Fractions containing α-actinin were identified by Western blots and probing with mAb 4G10 and an α-actinin antiserum and were combined. KCl was added to the protein solution to reach 0.6 m. The solution was vigorously vortexed and dialysis-concentrated against buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 0.6 mKCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 1 mmNa3VO4 (buffer 2) utilizing a concentrator apparatus (Schleicher & Schuell) equipped with a collodion bag with a molecular mass cut-off of 75 kDa. The volume was reduced to 5 ml or less. The sample was centrifuged for 60 min at 100,000 ×g (20 °C; SW Ti55 Beckman rotor). The supernatant was further dialysis-concentrated to 2 ml and then subjected to gel filtration on a Sephacryl 300-HR column (1.6 × 70 cm) pre-equilibrated with buffer 2 at a constant flow of 0.32 ml/min. Fractions containing α-actinin were identified by Western blots, as described above, and combined. The protein solution was dialysis-concentrated down to 2 ml against buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm CaCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4 (buffer 3). This sample was passed through a CM-Sepharose column (1.2 × 14 cm) at a flow of 1 ml/min. α-Actinin was not retained on this column. α-Actinin-containing fractions were pooled and loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose column (1.2 × 14 cm) pre-equilibrated with buffer 3. The column was washed with 30 ml of the loading buffer, and proteins were eluted off the column with a linear increase in NaCl concentration from 0–0.5 m in 40 ml of buffer 3. Fractions containing α-actinin were identified by Western blots and combined. All chromatographic analyzes were performed at room temperature.FIG. 3α-Actinin purification from PMA-stimulated platelets. Purified outdated platelets were activated with PMA and lysed by sonication. Soluble proteins were subjected to gel filtration on a Sephacryl 300-HR column (Aand B). Panel A shows the chromatography profile of this column, and arrows point to the first and last fractions that were subsequently combined (fractions 3–12). Fractions containing α-actinin and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were identified, respectively, by Western blots and probing with mAb 4G10 and α-actinin antiserum (B). Most of the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, including the 105-kDa protein, were recovered in the α-actinin-containing fractions. The combined fractions were brought to 0.6 m KCl. The resulting sample was treated as described under ”Materials and Methods.“ The sample was next resolved by gel filtration on a Sephacryl 300-HR column in the presence of 0.6 m KCl. C shows the chromatography profile of the column. Arrows point to the first and last fractions that were subsequently combined (fractions 4–6). The migration profile of α-actinin and the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were determined by Western blots (D). The combined fractions were next applied to a CM-Sepharose column. α-Actinin was not retained on this column (data not shown). The sample was next loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose column. α-Actinin was eluted off the column with a linear gradient of 0–0.5M NaCl (E). Fractions containing α-actinin and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were identified by Western blots as described above. An outline of the purification scheme, including the protein amount recovered at each step, is shown in F.G, duplicate samples from the various purification steps marked in F were loaded onto two gels. One gel was silver-stained. The second gel was Western-blotted and probed with mAb 4G10 and α-actinin antiserum. Lanes 2-7 were loaded with 10 μg of protein, and lanes 8 and 9were loaded with 5 μg of protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were detected in most experiments using mAb 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology). In some experiments, mAb PY-20 (Transduction Laboratories) or mAb PY-99 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used yielding indistinguishable results. Two α-actinin antiserums were used. One antiserum was purchased from Sigma (A-2543). This antiserum was used to generate the data shown in Fig. 1. A second antiserum was generated by us by immunizing rabbits with a 14-mer peptide derived from residues 25–38 of human α-actinin (Swiss Protein Database accession number P12814,aac1_human). Attempts to precipitate α-actinin with either α-actinin antiserum were unsuccessful. Antibody reactivity was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad). Phosphotyrosine-containing proteins and α-actinin were visualized by chemiluminescent detection with ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To immunoprecipitate tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, samples were pre-cleared for 1 h with 20 μl of protein A/G agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by an overnight incubation with mAb PY-20 (4 μg/sample) in the presence or absence of 50 μm phenyl phosphate. Antibody-antigen complexes were immunoprecipitated with 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads, eluted with sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fibrinogen-adherent platelets were lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.02% Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates containing 60 μg protein/lane were resolved by gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose. The membrane was blocked from 2 h to overnight with 2% albumin (Fraction V, ICN) in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.03% sodium azide. The membrane was separated into strips each representing one lane of the gel. The strips were submerged in solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% mercaptoethanol, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin with or without 25 milliunits/ml of protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase), a recombinant 34-kDa fragment from Yersinia enterocolitica (from Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Dephosphorylation was carried out at room temperature. At times 0 and 60 min, one strip from each group was removed, rinsed in water, and placed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm Na3VO4 overnight. The strips were probed with mAb 4G10 and the antiserum to α-actinin. Two approaches were used for protein separation in the first (pI) dimension. The first approach involved lysis of fibrinogen adherent platelets or PMA-stimulated platelets in boiling 2% SDS in 66 mm Tris, pH 8.0. In some experiments, platelets were treated for 1 h with 12 μm bisindolylmaleimide, a protein kinase C inhibitor, (29Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M.

Blood. 1996; 87: 152-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Isoelectric focusing of samples containing 50 μg of protein was carried out in a glass tube using 2% pH 4–8 ampholines (BDH from Hoefer Scientific Instruments, as described in Ref. 30O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second-dimension SDS-PAGE was carried out on 8% acrylamide gels. The two-dimensional gel analysis was performed by Kendrick Laboratories Inc. (Madison, WI). The second two-dimensional gel analysis performed by us entailed the use of polyacrylamide gels that are pre-cast on plastic support film and contain an immobilized pH gradient of 3–10 (Immobiline DryStrips, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Unstimulated, fibrinogen-adherent, and PMA-stimulated platelets were lysed in 9m urea, 2% Triton X-100, and 10 mmdithiothreitol. 50–100 μg of protein were loaded onto the Immobiline DryStrips. First-dimension electrophoresis was performed utilizing the Multiphor II apparatus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the procedure described by the manufacturer. Second-dimension SDS-PAGE was carried out on 7% acrylamide gels. Platelet activation with soluble agonists such as PMA as well as platelet adhesion to immobilized matrix proteins such as fibrinogen (9Haimovich B. Lipfert L. Brugge J.S. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15868-15877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Ferrell J.E. Martin G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To begin to characterize these proteins, we set out to partially purify a 105-kDa protein(s) from PMA-activated outdated platelets. The activated platelets were lysed in a buffer containing 0.02% Triton X-100. Soluble proteins were precipitated with 10–40% ammonium sulfate. After re-solubilization, aliquots from each fraction containing an equal amount of protein (15 μg/lane) were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Gels were analyzed by silver staining or Western blotting and probed with the phosphotyrosine-specific mAb 4G10 (Fig. 1 C). A tyrosine-phosphorylated protein band of 105 kDa was enriched in 30 and 40% ammonium sulfate precipitates. These fractions were pooled and applied to a DEAE-Sepharose ion exchange column. Proteins retained on the column were eluted with a step gradient of 0.2–1 mNaCl. Duplicate samples containing an equal protein amount were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by silver staining or Western blotting and probing with mAb 4G10 (Fig. 1 D). Proteins eluted off the DEAE column with 0.8 and 1 m NaCl were pooled and Western-blotted onto an Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and visualized with India ink. The 105-kDa region was cut out and HPLC purified peptides derived from endoproteinase Lys-C digestion were microsequenced (28Fernandez J. DeMott M. Atherton D. Mische S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). A 12-amino acid internal sequence, QLEINFNTLQTK, was identified. The sequence was identical to human α-actinin sequences aac1_human, aac2_human, andaac3_human deposited in the Swiss Protein Database. Based on these data, the blots shown in Fig. 1, A, C, andD, were reprobed with a polyclonal antiserum to α-actinin. In all three cases (Fig. 1, B, C, andD), the α-actinin antiserum reacted with a single protein band of 105-kDa that co-migrated with the 105-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein identified with mAb 4G10. Lysates from activated platelets were Western-blotted onto nitrocelullose and dephosphrylated with a recombinant tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) fromY. enterocolitica. Dephosphorylation of the proteins eliminated reactivity with mAb 4G10 but had no effect on the reactivity of the samples with the antiserum to α-actinin (Fig. 1 E). Collectively, these data suggested that α-actinin may be the 105-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein detected in activated platelets. To further demonstrate that α-actinin is tyrosine-phosphorylated in activated platelets, an α-actinin purification protocol was developed. Prior α-actinin purification protocols relied on the relatively low solubility of this cytoskeletal protein in buffers containing 1% Triton X-100. For example, Rosenberg et al.(33Rosenberg S. Stracher A. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12986-12991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that more than 90% of platelet α-actinin was recovered in the Triton-insoluble pellet fraction. To further investigate the cellular partitioning of α-actinin and pp105, platelets were activated with PMA for 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 min before lysis (Fig. 2). At the indicated time points, the platelets were lysed by the addition of an equal volume of buffer containing 2% Triton X-100 as described by Fox et al. (22Fox J.E.B. Lipfer L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.C. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates were spun for 4 min at 12,000 × g, yielding the low speed pellet. The resulting supernatants were sedimented for 2.5 h at 100,000 × g, resulting in a soluble and an insoluble high speed pellet for each time point. The low speed and high speed fractions contain, respectively, cytoskeleton- and membrane-cytoskeleton-associated proteins (22Fox J.E.B. Lipfer L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.C. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins contained in each fraction were Western-blotted and analyzed with mAb 4G10 and the α-actinin antiserum (Fig. 2, A and B). PMA stimulation triggered a time-dependent decrease in the amount of α-actinin recovered in the soluble (supernatant fractions) and the membrane-cytoskeleton (high speed pellet) pools with a simultaneous increase in α-actinin localized to the cytoskeleton fraction (low speed pellet). Whereas in resting platelets 18% of α-actinin was recovered in the cytoskeleton fraction, 56% of α-actinin was recovered in the cytoskeleton fraction of platelets stimulated with PMA for 20 min (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, the fraction of soluble α-actinin dropped from 53 to 38%. Most dramatic, however, was the change in α-actinin partitioning to the high speed/membrane-cytoskeleton fraction, which dropped from 29 to 4% over the same time period. Many other platelet proteins have been shown to move from the soluble to the cytoskeleton fraction of activated platelets (22Fox J.E.B. Lipfer L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.C. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J.

In contrast with this trend, a time-dependent increase in the tyrosine-phosphorylated 105-kDa protein and its predominant enrichment in the detergent-soluble fractions was observed. After a much longer exposure of the gel shown in Fig. 2 A, we did note that α-actinin localized to the membrane-cytoskeleton compartment at the 20-min time point was also tyrosine-phosphorylated. However, no tyrosine phosphorylation signal associated with α-actinin in the cytoskeleton compartment was detected. Similar result were obtained with thrombin-stimulated platelets (22Fox J.E.B.

To identify a functional GH-responsive element (GHRE) in vivo, we performed the direct injection of promoter-luciferase chimeric genes into female rat livers. The results showed that the luciferase activity was decreased to approximately 20% by the deletion of the sequence between nucleotides −4213 and −4161. Within this region, two copies of a possible GHRE were present. The sequence of the GHRE was overlapped with that of an interferon-γ-activated sequence, known to be recognized by the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. In fact, a supershift assay showed that STAT5 was capable of binding to the core sequence of the GHRE. Furthermore, a luciferase assay with reporter plasmids, Δ−4161/−3781, mutated hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (HNF-4), and mutated HNF-6, revealed that the GH-stimulated expression of the CYP2C12 gene was regulated cooperatively by STAT5, HNF-4, HNF-6, and the factor(s) that binds to the elements, 2C12-I (−4095 to −4074) and 2C12-II (−4072 to −4045). The cooperative regulation by STAT5 and the liver-enriched transcription factors account for the GH-dependent and the liver-specific expression of the CYP2C12 gene in female rats.

Although the pattern of GH secretion in male rats is characterized by the peaks of large amplitude every 3–4 h with undetectable levels in interpulse periods, the pattern of GH secretion in female rats shows more frequent oscillation of small amplitude (13Tannenbaum G.S. Martin J.B. Endocrinology. 1976; 98: 562-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 14Edén S. Endocrinology. 1979; 105: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Thus, the transcription of the CYP2C12 gene is thought to be activated by the constant level of GH seen in female rats (9MacGeoch C. Morgan E.T. Cordell B. Gustafsson J.-Å. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 143: 782-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 10Legraverend C. Mode A. Westin S. Ström A. Eguchi H. Zaphiropoulos P.G. Gustafsson J.-Å. Mol.

The effects of GH are mediated by a GH receptor, which belongs to a cytokine/hematopoietin receptor superfamily (15Argetsinger L.S. Carter-Su C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1089-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). On the basis of a proposed pathway for the induction of gene expression by GH, the binding of GH to the GH receptor promotes the association of the GH receptor with Janus kinase 2 and the tyrosyl phosphorylation of the Janus kinase 2. (16Argetsinger L.S. Campbell G.S. Yang X. Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Carter-Su C. Cell. 1993; 74: 237-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the activated Janus kinase 2 phosphorylates the tyrosine residues of the STAT protein. After the formation of the homodimer of the STAT protein or the heterodimer of the STAT protein with other factor(s) in the cytoplasm, the complex translocates to the nucleus and then binds to target sequences (17Darnell J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5062) Google Scholar). Among the STAT family, STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 have been identified as GH-stimulated proteins (15Argetsinger L.S. Carter-Su C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1089-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 18Ram P.A. Park S.-H. Choi H.K. Waxman D.J. J. Biol.

Zhong Z. Wen Z. Thomas M.J. Darnell J.E. Rotwein P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 171-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), serine protease inhibitor 2.1 (21Sliva D. Wood T.J.J. Schindler C. Lobie P.E. Norstedt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26208-26214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the acid-labile subunit gene (22Ooi G.T. Hurst K.R. Poy M.N. Rechler M.M. Boisclair Y.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 675-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pulsatile plasma GH secretion seen in male rats but not in female rats has been shown to activate STAT5 in the liver (23Waxman D.J.

Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 400-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Based on these lines of evidence, STAT5 has been regarded as the male-specific regulator for the expression of genes including the sex-limited protein gene (25Varin-Blank N. Dondi E. Tosi M. Hernandez C. Boucontet L. Gotoh H. Shiroishi T. Moriwaki K. Meo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8750-8755Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) andCYP3A10 (26Subramanian A. Teixeira J. Wang J. Gil G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4672-4682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date, the mechanism responsible for the GH-dependent activation of the CYP2C12 gene in females has been studiedin vitro. HNF-6 has been reported to be involved in the GH-dependent transcription of the CYP2C12 gene (27Lahuna O. Fernandez L. Karlsson H. Maiter D. Lemaigre F.P. Rousseau G.G. Gustafsson J.-Å. Mode A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12309-12313Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Additionally, it was found that the female-enriched GH-dependent complex, termed GHNF, bound to five distinct regions within the CYP2C12 promoter region between nucleotides −1560 and +60 (28Waxman D.J. Zhao S. Choi H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29978-29987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, it has not been clarified as yet whether or not the above factors play a key role in the in vivo expression of the CYP2C12 gene. In addition to the uncertainty of the in vivo role of these factors, a functional GH-responsive element(s) has not yet been clarified in the regulatory region of the CYP2C12 gene. To identify a functional factor(s) responsible for the modulation of the GH-dependent transcription of the CYP2C12gene, we attempted to search the cultured cells to show the inducibility of CYP2C12 by GH. However, no suitable cultured cells were found. Recently, it has been reported that the direct injection of plasmid DNA into the liver is a useful method to assay the in vivo activity of the CYP2B and CYP2Cpromoters (29Park Y. Li H. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23725-23728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, we employed the direct injection method to search for a critical factor(s) responsible for the GH-dependent expression and to determine the relative contribution of each transcription factor to the GH-dependent expression of theCYP2C12 gene. In the present study, we provide evidence that the GH-dependent and liver-specific expression of theCYP2C12 gene in female rats results from a cooperative regulation with STAT5, HNF-4, HNF-6, and factors that bind to elements 2C12-I and 2C12-II in the upstream region of the CYP2C12gene. Adult female Harlan Sprague Dawley rats (8 weeks old; Sankyo Experimental Animals, Tokyo, Japan) were used. When necessary, female rats were hypophysectomized at 6 weeks of age. Recombinant human methionylated GH (Somatonorm, Kabi Vitrum, Stockholm, Sweden) was kindly supplied by Sumitomo Pharmaceutical Co. (Osaka, Japan). Human GH was administered by a continuous infusion (0.94 IU/kg·day), which mimics female-type GH secretion, with an osmotic minipump (model 2001, Alza, Palo Alto, CA) or by a pulsatile injection (0.94 IU/kg·day), which mimics male-type GH secretion (10Legraverend C. Mode A. Westin S. Ström A. Eguchi H. Zaphiropoulos P.G. Gustafsson J.-Å. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), for 6 days. To isolate the 5′-flanking region of the CYP2C12 gene (30Zaphilopous P.G. Westin S. Ström A. Mode A. Gustafsson J.-Å. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), a gene library prepared from the rat genomic DNA, which had been cleaved by Sau3A I and cloned into λFIXII vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), was screened with the fragment of a CYP2C12promoter as a probe. Consequently, a positive clone containing the 9–10-kilobase fragment of the CYP2C12 gene was obtained. The clone was digested with XhoI and HindIII to obtain a 5′-flanking region between nucleotides −5132 and +113 from the transcription start site (30Zaphilopous P.G. Westin S. Ström A. Mode A. Gustafsson J.-Å. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The resultant fragment was subcloned to the XhoI/HindIII site of pUC19 (pUC5.2). Luc5132 reporter plasmid was constructed as follows. AHindIII site was introduced downstream of the nucleotide +16 of pUC5.2 by site-directed mutagenesis (pUC5.2(+16)). pUC5.2(+16) was then cleaved with XhoI and HindIII. The fragment corresponding to nucleotides from −5132 to +16 was ligated into the unique XhoI–HindIII site of basic vector 2 (Toyoinki, Tokyo, Japan). Reporter plasmids, Luc4213, Luc4118, and Luc1944, were constructed by the digestion of Luc5132 with restriction enzymes, HincII, BstXI, and BamHI, respectively. Luc4200, Luc4187, and Luc4161 were generated by polymerase chain reaction using S-4200, S-4187, or S-4161 as a 5′-primer and AS-3614 as a 3′-primer. Synthesized fragments were digested with BglII at position −3780 in theCYP2C12 gene. Resultant fragments were inserted into theSmaI/BglII site of Luc3780. To construct Luc4200ΔGHRE2 without the region between nucleotides −4174 and −4162, the region corresponding to nucleotides from −4200 to −4175 was inserted into the KpnI site of Luc4161. To confirm the contribution of GHRE to GH-dependent transcriptional activity, reporter plasmids, 1×GHRE-LucTK, 2×GHRE-LucTK, 4×GHRE-LucTK, and GHRE-Luc1944 were constructed. TK promoter was inserted into the BglII/HindIII site of basic vector 2 (LucTK). 1×GHRE, 2×GHRE, or 4×GHRE was then introduced into the XhoI site of LucTK. The copy number and the direction of the oligonucleotides inserted into the reporter plasmids were confirmed by a sequence analysis (31Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). To construct Luc4200Δ(−4161/−3781) or Luc4200Δ (−4161/−4118), the region corresponding to nucleotides from −4200 to −4162 was inserted into theKpnI/NheI site of Luc3780 or Luc4118. To construct Luc4200Δ(−3776/−3138), Luc4200Δ(−3137/−1944), Luc4200Δ(−1939/−536), Luc4200Δ(−535/−81), Luc4200Δ(−4122/−4036), or Luc4200Δ(−4030/−3781), Luc4200 was digested with BglII/EcoRV,EcoRV/BamHI, BamHI/StuI,StuI/MscI, BstXI/HgaI, orHgaI/BglII, respectively. Resultant fragments were blunt-ended and self-ligated. To construct GHRE-Luc3780, the region corresponding to nucleotides from −4200 to −4162 was inserted into the KpnI/NheI site of Luc3780. To construct GHRE-2C12-I-Luc3780 and GHRE-2C12-II-Luc3780, the regions corresponding to nucleotides from −4095 to −4074 (2C12-I) and from −4072 to −4045 (2C12-II) were cloned into the GHRE-Luc3780. To construct GHRE-2C12-I/II-Luc3780, the region corresponding to nucleotides from −4072 to −4045 (2C12-II) was cloned into the GHRE-2C12-I-Luc3780. Luc4200mtC/EBP, Luc4200mtHNF-4, and Luc4200mtHNF-6 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis.

Direct DNA injection was performed with minor modifications of the method previously described (34Malone R.W. Hickman M.A. Lehmann-Bruinsma K. Sih T.R. Walzem R. Carlson D.M. Powell J.S. J. Biol.

The CYP2C12-Luc chimeric genes (600 μg of plasmid DNA diluted with 1.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nisssui Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan)) were injected into the peripheral site of single liver lobes. Rats were sacrificed 7 days later to obtain the injected liver weighing from 0.1 to 0.2 g. Human GH was administered 1 day after the DNA injection by a continuous infusion for 6 days (30Zaphilopous P.G. Westin S. Ström A. Mode A. Gustafsson J.-Å. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). When a reporter plasmid with TK promoter was injected into the livers of hypophysectomized rats, GH was administered 5 days prior to the DNA injection. Rats were sacrificed 1 day after the DNA injection, when the highest luciferase activity was seen. Three ml of LCβ/PGC-51 lysis buffer (Toyoinki, Tokyo, Japan) per 1 g of liver tissue was added to prepare liver cell extracts. After homogenization with a Dounce homogenizer, insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation. The supernatants were kept frozen at −80 °C until use. Luciferase activity was measured using a Berthold Lumat LB 9501 luminometer with photon detection integrated over 10-s intervals. Statistical significance was judged by a Mann-Whitney U test. Nuclear extracts were prepared from the livers from hypophysectomized rats and from the hypophysectomizd rats treated with GH by the constant infusion as described elsewhere (35Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar) except for 1% aprotinin (Sigma) in an initial homogenization buffer. Subsequently, the extracts were snap-frozen in 0.01-ml aliquots at 5–10 mg of protein/ml and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage. The gel shift assay was performed with 20 μl of a reaction mixture containing 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.8), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5% glycerol, 2% Ficoll 400, 10 μg of liver nuclear extracts, and a32P-labeled probe (10 fmol). The mixture was incubated at 0 °C for 90 min. Resulting DNA-protein complex was subjected to a 6% polyacrylamide gel in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris borate and 0.5 mm EDTA. For a competition assay, liver nuclear extracts were preincubated at 0 °C for 30 min with a 20-fold molar excess of an unlabeled oligonucleotide. CRE and mutated CRE used for a competition assay were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). For a supershift assay, liver nuclear extracts were preincubated at 0 °C for 30 min with 1 μl of antibodies to STAT1α, STAT3, STAT5, STAT5a, CREB1, or CREB2. These antibodies to STAT proteins were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. After a labeled probe was added, the mixture was incubated at 0 °C for 90 min.

To examine whether or not the Luc5132 reporter gene was activated in vivo by GH secreted in a female-type pattern, we injected the DNA of Luc5132 into the liver of female rats (Fig. 1 A). As expected, the luciferase activity was detected in the liver transfected with Luc5132. Hypophysectomy of female rats resulted in the abolishment of the luciferase activity. However, the activity was restored to the level seen in intact rats by the continuous infusion of GH to the livers of hypophysectomized female rats. These results indicate that the direct DNA injection is a useful method to clarify the mechanism responsible for the GH-dependent transcriptional regulation of the CYP2C12 gene. To identify possible regulatory element(s) involved in the GH-induced expression of the CYP2C12 gene, the 5′-deletion mutants of the gene were constructed as shown in Fig. 1 B. When the mutants were injected into livers of female rats, the maximal activity of luciferase was seen in the liver that received Luc4213. The activity was decreased to approximately 20% by the deletion of the nucleotide sequences between −4213 and −4161. Further deletion between −4118 and −1944 also resulted in a significant decrease to a basal activity. These results suggest that at least two regions are necessary for the GH-dependent expression of the CYP2C12 gene in female rats. The sequence of the 5′-flanking region of the CYP2C12 gene was found to contain 9-bp palindrome sequences (5′-TTCCTAGAA-3′), designated as GHRE1 and GHRE2, in a region between nucleotides −4213 and −4161 (Fig. 2 A). Compared with elements reported so far, the sequence of the GHREs overlapped with those of the interferon γ-activated sequence and acute-phase response element (5′-TTCCNNNAA-3′), known to be the binding sites of STAT proteins. As can be seen in Fig. 2 B, the deletion of either the GHRE1 or the GHRE2 caused an 80–90% decrease in the luciferase activity. This result indicates that both GHREs contribute to the GH-dependent activation of the CYP2C12gene in female rats. Furthermore, a gel shift assay using the GHRE1 or the GHRE2 as a probe showed that a factor(s) in nuclear extracts from female livers bound to each GHRE (Fig. 2 C). Interestingly, the binding of the constitutive factor(s) to the GHREs disappeared with the hypophysectomy of female rats. The binding of the factor(s) to the GHREs was, however, restored by the continuous infusion of GH, which mimics female-type GH secretion, to hypophysectomized female rats. To further confirm the contribution of the GHREs to the GH-dependent expression of the CYP2C12 gene, GHRE-Luc1944, which contains 10 copies of the GHRE, was injected into the liver of female rats (Fig. 3 A). The results indicate that the luciferase activity in the liver transfected with GHRE-Luc1944 is much higher than that in the liver transfected with Luc1944. In the livers from hypophysectomized female rats, the activation of the GHRE-Luc1944 was not seen. The continuous infusion of GH to hypophysectomized rats elevated the luciferase activity of GHRE-Luc1944 by approximately 10-fold. To further characterize GHRE, 1×GHRE-, 2×GHRE-, and 4×GHRE-LucTK were used for a luciferase assay. The luciferase activity was significantly increased with the copy number of GHRE (Fig. 3 B). Additionally, the luciferase activity with 4×GHRE-LucTK was elevated by the infusion of GH to the livers of hypophysectomized rats (Fig. 3 C).FIG. 3GH-dependent activation of theCYP2C12 or TK promoter through the GHRE . A, GHRE-Luc1944 was constructed as described under “Materials and Methods.” The reporter plasmid was injected into the livers of nontreated females (NT), hypophysectomized females (Hypox), and hypophysectomized females infused with human GH for 6 days (Hypox + GH).

Particularly, the sequence of the GHRE was completely identical to the STAT5 binding sequence found in the acid-labile subunit gene (22Ooi G.T. Hurst K.R. Poy M.N. Rechler M.M. Boisclair Y.R. Mol.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar) possessed only one base change as compared with the GHRE sequence. To confirm the binding of STAT protein to the GHRE2, we performed a competition assay with STAT-binding sequences seen in the rat β-casein, rat α2-macroglobulin, and human Ly6E and M67 genes (Fig. 5 A). We found that the binding of the GH-stimulated factor(s) to the GHRE2 disappeared with the presence of a 20-fold molar excess of the STAT-binding sequences of the β-casein and α2-macroglobulin genes. The competitor of Ly6E and M67 partially inhibited the formation of the complex of the GH-stimulated factor(s) with the GHRE2. Unlike the competitors, the β-casein, α2-macroglobulin, Ly6E, andM67 genes, mutated β-casein, and nonspecific competitor, GATA-1, did not affect the binding of the complex to the GHRE2. To identify a STAT protein to bind to the GHRE, a supershift assay using antibodies to STAT1α, STAT3, STAT5, and STAT5a was performed (Fig. 5,B and C). The results showed that a supershifted band appeared in the presence of antibodies against STAT5 and STAT5a. Thus, it appeared that STAT5a is one of the modulators for the expression of CYP2C12 in the livers of female rats.FIG. 5Binding of STAT5 to the GHRE .

Thus, we postulated that liver-specific factors other than STAT5 were required for the expression of CYP2C12 in the livers of female rats. To identify the regulatory regions necessary for the liver-specific expression of theCYP2C12 gene, we performed a luciferase assay with reporter plasmids, Luc4200Δ(−4161/−3781), Luc4200"

We conclude that spontaneous activation of ICRAC by low [Ca2+]cyt could serve as a feedback mechanism keeping the resting [Ca2+]cyt constant.

It had been shown for many cell types that the capacitative Ca2+ entry is mediated by “store-operated channels” (SOC) in the plasma membrane (3Parekh A. Penner R. Physiol.

The properties of these channels are different in different species or tissues and range from a Ca2+-selective “Ca2+release-activated Ca2+ channel” (ICRAC; Refs.4Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar and 5Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 32523-32528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although variable in their biophysical properties, these channels have in common that a prerequisite for their activation is depletion of IP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores. At present the nature of the signal that leads to opening of SOCs is a matter of debate. One hypothesis assumes a Ca2+ influx factor produced by the empty stores, which diffuses to the plasma membrane and binds to the SOC or to regulatory proteins of it that leads to opening of the channel (Ref. 8Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar; for review, see Ref. 9Berridge M. J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). An alternative model proposes direct coupling between the Ca2+store and the SOC. Ca2+ depletion-induced conformational changes of proteins of the store (for example the IP3receptor) would be transferred to the SOC by protein-protein interaction (Ref. 10Irvine R. F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar; for review, see Ref. 9Berridge M. J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). A recent alternative hypothesis proposes that a decrease in the concentration of Ca2+ below the resting cytoplasmic Ca2+([Ca2+]cyt) in a subplasmalemmal space near the SOC can also activate capacitative Ca2+ entry (11Barritt G.J. Cell Calcium. 1998; 23: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). While it is known that in many cell types SOCs are regulated by feedback inhibition at high [Ca2+]cyt (Refs.12Louzao M.C.

Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar), it has not yet been decided if low [Ca2+]cyt have direct effects on SOCs. Lack of information on the influence of low [Ca2+]cyt on ICRAC may be due to the experimental problem to discriminate between direct effects of low [Ca2+]cyt on SOCs and effects that are mediated by passive depletion of Ca2+ stores at low [Ca2+]cyt (15Hofer A.M. Curci S. Machen T.E. Schulz I. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To overcome this problem we have combined patch clamp measurements of SOC activities with simultaneous [Ca2+] measurements in Ca2+stores using the “mag fura-2” technique (16Hofer A.M. Machen T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2598-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). This approach was used earlier (17Hofer A.M. Fasolato C. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and it was found that at [Ca2+]cyt of 100 nm the magnitude of Ca2+ entry closely correlated to the extend of Ca2+ store depletion. We now describe that decrease of resting [Ca2+]cyt to the range of 30–50 nm activates the store-operated current ICRACin RBL-1 cells independently of global Ca2+ store depletion, while at the resting [Ca2+]cyt(100 nm) ICRAC activation is accompanied by global store depletion. We speculate that activation of ICRAC at low [Ca2+]cyt is a feedback mechanism that keeps the [Ca2+]cytat a level to allow refilling of Ca2+ stores after hormonal stimulation had ceased. RBL-1 cells (ATCC, number CRL1378) were grown on glass coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a moist atmosphere with 5% CO2. Before an experiment the glass coverslips were transferred from the culture medium to the measuring chamber. Patch clamp experiments were performed in the tight-seal, whole-cell configuration (18Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15172) Google Scholar) at room temperature (24 ± 2 °C) in a standard bath solution containing in mm: 140 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 10 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, pH 7.4. BaCl2 (0.5 mm) was added to inhibit potassium currents. Patch pipettes were manufactured from borosilicate glass capillaries and had resistances of 2–4 megaohms when filled with a standard pipette buffer containing in mm: 110 Cs+-glutamate, 15.5 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N, BAPTA, 0.5 Mg-ATP, 10 glucose adjusted to pH 7.2 with CsOH. CaCl2 was added to obtain different free [Ca2+] as calculated with the freeware software WINMAXC. The standard solution was termed “Ca2+-free” if no Ca2+ was added ([Ca2+] < 0.1 nm). To check the [Ca2+] of the ready-made solutions we used a calcium calibration buffer kit (number C-3722, Molecular Probes) and found that the difference between the calculated and the measured free [Ca2+] was less than 10%. Patch clamp experiments were recorded with a computer-controlled EPC9 patch clamp amplifier (HEKA; Lambrecht, Germany). Cell capacitance and series resistance were calculated with the software-supported internal routines of the EPC9 and compensated before each experiment. Data were sampled at 1 kH on the computer hard disc after low pass filtering at 600 Hz. In the whole-cell experiments voltage ramps were applied every 4 s to the cells (−140 mV to 100 mV, slope 1 V/s). EitherI/V curves are shown (after subtraction of the leak current) or time courses of currents at certain potentials (after extraction from every ramp) are presented. Measurement of Luminal [Ca2+] in Stores ([Ca2+]store)—RBL-1 cells grown on glass coverslips were loaded with mag fura-2-AM (1 μm) in the cell culture medium at 37 °C for 15 min. After dye loading the cells were transferred to the measuring chamber. The fluorescence indicator was dialyzed from the cytoplasm of a cell via a patch pipette in the whole-cell configuration. About 2–5 min were necessary for the wash out of the dye (time constant 164 ± 30 s, Fig. 1). Compartmentalized dye remaining in cellular organelles was used to determine the ratio of the intensities of emitted light following excitation at wave lengths of 340 and 380 nm. For excitation and analysis of emitted light (>510 nm) video camera- or photomultiplier-based systems (both Till Photonics, Munich, Germany) adapted to Zeiss Axiovert 135 microscopes were used. The photometric system was combined to the patch clamp set up and allowed simultaneous determinations of membrane currents and [Ca2+]store. Video camera-based measurement of stored Ca2+ was performed after permeabilization of the plasma membrane with streptolysin O (1 unit/ml) as described (16Hofer A.M. Machen T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2598-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). For this procedure cells were superfused with an extracellular buffer containing in mm: 125 KCl, 25 NaCl, 0.1 MgCl2, 0.5 Mg-ATP, 10 HEPES. Ca2+ and EGTA were added to obtain the desired Ca2+ concentrations. Cells were loaded with 5 μm fura-2-AM similar as described for loading with mag fura-2-AM. Fura-2 ratiometric measurements were made with an imaging system (Zeiss Axiovert 135 equipped with an apparatus from Till Photonics). Cells were excited alternately with light of 340 and 380 nm wavelength, the emitted light (>510 nm) was collected, and [Ca2+]cyt was calculated from the ratios (19Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Fura-2-loaded RBL-1 cells were perfused via patch pipettes with solutions containing fura-2 (70 μm) and different free [Ca2+]. Data were analyzed as described in the legend of Fig. 5. Time constants for current activation or changes in [Ca2+]store were determined by fitting data with an single exponential decay function:I(t) = a 0 +a 1 exp(−t/τ) (I = measured current or [Ca2+], a 0 = minimal current or minimal [Ca2+],a 1 = maximal current or maximal [Ca2+], t = time after start, τ = time constant) Mag fura-2-AM, fura-2-AM, and fura-2 salt were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). 2,5-Di-tert-butyl-hydroquinone (BHQ) was from Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany) and all other chemicals were from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). In a first set of experiments we tested the influence of different [Ca2+]cyt on the [Ca2+]store. Stored Ca2+ was measured as a ratio signal of mag fura-2 after cytosolic mag fura-2 had been washed out of the cell by a patch pipette. Thus signals from the dye within stores were unmasked and could be monitored by the increase in the fluorescence ratio (details under “Experimental Procedures”). We found that a [Ca2+]cytabove 30 nm was high enough to keep Ca2+ stores at a constant level at least for about 10 min (Fig. 1, a and b). In contrast, dialysis with a Ca2+-free solution induced spontaneous Ca2+ release with a time constant of 372 ± 46 s (Fig. 1 c). At a [Ca2+]cyt of 30 and 50 nmCa2+ release could be induced by inhibition of the “sarcoendoplasmic reticulumCa2+-ATPases” (SERCAs) with BHQ, 10 μm, Fig. 1 b, time constant 254.67 ± 95 s) or by application of a Ca2+ ionophore (ionomycin, 1 μm, Fig. 1 a, time constant 18 ± 95 s). Mean values of time constants are shown in Fig. 1 d. Comparison of effects of BHQ and ionomycin revealed that BHQ released 85 ± 7% (n = 9) of the ionomycin-releasable Ca2+ (measured in terms of the ratio). This shows that part of the measured mag fura-2 signal is produced by BHQ-insensitive stores. To test the influence of [Ca2+]cyt on [Ca2+]store, we averaged ratio values from experiments as shown in Fig. 1 a before store depletion (as soon as the cytoplasmic dye was completely washed out) and after store depletion with 1 μm ionomycin. We found that [Ca2+]store (measured in terms of the ratio) stays constant even if [Ca2+]cyt is lowered from 100 nm to 30 nm (Fig. 2 a). To measure the influence of [Ca2+]cyt on stored Ca2+ more directly we performed experiments on mag fura-2 loaded RBL-1 cells (Fig. 2 b) after the cytoplasmic dye had been removed by streptolysin O-induced permeabilization of the plasma membrane. One advantage of this method is that changes in [Ca2+]cyt could be performed by changing the Ca2+ concentration of the perfusion medium. Again we found that reduction in [Ca2+]cyt from 100 to 30 nm did not induce changes in [Ca2+]store, while a Ca2+-free solution reduced [Ca2+]store with a time constant of 390 ± 45 s (n = 5) (Fig. 2 b). To test if [Ca2+]cyt had any effect on activation of ICRAC, both fluorescence signals and membrane currents were recorded simultaneously. As shown in Fig. 3 a at t = 0 s, a whole-cell configuration was established with a Ca2+-free solution in the pipette. A current was activated immediately after breakage into the cell (lag time 30 ± 15 s, n = 6) with a time constant of 61 ± 25 s (n = 6). The current/voltage curve (I/V curve) of this current was inwardly rectifying and reversed at a positive voltage (55 ± 15 mV, n = 6, Fig. 3). La3+ (100 μm) an inhibitor of ICRAC inhibited the current completely (not shown), and the reduction in the extracellular [Ca2+] from 10 mm (the standard [Ca2+] that we used) to 1.3 mm reduced the current (not shown) below the signal to noise ratio. These features characterize the current as ICRAC (3Parekh A. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). Because activation of ICRAC as described in Fig. 3a occurred before the cytoplasmic mag fura-2 had been completely washed out and [Ca2+]storecould be determined, it is unclear to what extent Ca2+ had been lost from stores before ICRAC was activated. But taking into account that at Ca2+-free conditions passive leak in RBL-1 cells is small (Fig. 1 d) the current was activated maximally long before stores were completely emptied. In the experiment shown in Fig. 3 a we added 5 μmionomycin to the bath for store depletion. This was without any additional effect on the current, which shows that ICRAChad been activated maximally without maximal store depletion. At [Ca2+]cyt of 50 nmICRAC activated with similar kinetics (Fig. 3 b, lag time 32 ± 12 s, time constant 71 ± 30 s,n = 9) as at Ca2+-free conditions. At [Ca2+]cyt of 50 nm spontaneous Ca2+ release did not occur (see Fig. 1 b), and the concentration of stored Ca2+ was not lower as at 100 nm [Ca2+]cyt (Fig. 2 a). It therefore appears likely that ICRACactivation was not due to global store depletion at that low [Ca2+]cyt. This assumption agrees with the observation that release of Ca2+ induced by BHQ (Fig. 3 b) or ionomycin (not shown) did not further increase the current, which had been activated at a low [Ca2+]cyt of 50 nm. Elevation of [Ca2+]cyt to more than 50 nm changed ICRAC activation from a “spontaneous” mode to a “store-operated” mode. Fig. 3 c shows an experiment in which a cell was dialyzed with a solution containing 70 nm free [Ca2+]. After having established the whole-cell configuration a current developed spontaneously and reached a plateau. Store depletion induced with 5 μm ionomycin or with 10 μm BHQ (not shown) increased the current. In average 64 ± 34% (n = 6) of the total current present after store depletion had been already activated spontaneously before store depletion in these experiments (Fig. 3 c). At a [Ca2+]cyt of 100 nm (Fig. 3 d) spontaneous activation of ICRAC could not be found and depletion of stores was necessary to activate ICRAC (n = 7). The range of [Ca2+]cyt that induced a change from the “spontaneous activation” to “activation by store depletion” was narrow, between 50 and 100 nm. At all tested conditions maximal ICRAC had the same magnitude (Fig. 4 a). This supports the assumption of a single channel type involved in the measured currents. Comparison of the time courses of current activation at different [Ca2+]cyt with the time courses of spontaneous or store depletion-induced Ca2+ release (Fig. 4 b) revealed that ICRAC activation only correlated with the time course of Ca2+ release when store depletion was induced by BHQ at [Ca2+]cyt of 100 nm (current activation, τ = 175 ± 58 s, n = 3; Ca2+ store depletion, τ = 198 ± 90 s, n = 6). At these conditions a decrease in [Ca2+]store was accompanied by a simultaneous activation of ICRAC. Maximal depletion of stores was necessary to activate ICRAC maximally (Fig. 3,c and d). Spontaneous activation of ICRAC with a Ca2+-free pipette solution or a pipette solution containing 50 nm[Ca2+]cyt had a time constant of 66 ± 28 s (n = 15) and 89 ± 56 s (n = 7), respectively (see Fig. 4 b). Accompanying Ca2+ release was either slower (Ca2+-free, τ = 372 ± 46 s,n = 4) or did not take place ([Ca2+]cyt = 50 nm,n = 9) (see Fig. 4 b). In the presence of ionomycin Ca2+ release was fast (τ = 11 ± 3 s), while activation of ICRAC occurred within a similar time (τ = 89 ± 55 s) as it was found for low [Ca2+]cyt (Ca2+-free and 50 nm [Ca2+]cyt, see Fig. 4 b). It therefore appears that activation of ICRAC could reach a maximal speed by either rapid store depletion (ionomycin) or in the presence of low [Ca2+]cyt. On the other hand a relative slow depletion of stores (by BHQ) was accompanied by a slower activation of ICRAC with similar time constants for both Ca2+release and ICRAC activation. The conclusion that ICRAC is activated by [Ca2+]cyt< 100 nm rises the question about the resting [Ca2+]cyt of RBL-1 cells. Because of difficulties to measure a real R min at low Ca2+ concentrations (20Kao J.P.Y. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 155-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), standard calibrations of fura-2 signals according to Grynkiewicz et al. (19Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) gave only approximations of a Ca2+ concentration. We therefore performed an in vivo calibration of Ca2+ signals as described under “Experimental Procedures.” With this approach we obtained a resting [Ca2+]cyt of 105 nm (Fig. 5). At this [Ca2+]cyt ICRAC is inactivated (see Fig. 3 d). A relative small decrease in [Ca2+]cyt results in a spontaneous opening of ICRAC (see Fig. 3 c). To test the possibility if ICRAC is activated in intact cells (i.e. cells that are not in the whole-cell modus) when [Ca2+]cyt is decreased, we performed experiments on fura-2-loaded RBL-1 cells. For lowering of [Ca2+]cyt, cells were treated with a nominally Ca2+ free bath solution containing 10 μm BAPTA-AM. BAPTA-AM penetrates the cell, becomes hydrolyzed by cytosolic esterases, and increases the cellular Ca2+ buffer. Thereby [Ca2+]cytwas reduced within 5–10 min from around 100 nm to around 70 nm (Fig. 6 a) (Δ[Ca2+]cyt = −35 ± 15 nm, n = 10) as estimated by the method after Grynkiewicz (19Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). After loading, BAPTA-AM was removed from the bath, and subsequently 1.3 mm Ca2+ was added. This maneuver resulted in an influx of Ca2+ and an increase in [Ca2+]cyt to the resting [Ca2+]cyt level (Fig. 6 a). This Ca2+ influx was sensitive to La3+ (Fig. 6 b). Several reports have described inhibitory effects of high [Ca2+]cyt on ICRAC (12Louzao M.C. Ribeiro C.M.P. Bird G.S.J. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14807-14813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 13Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Biol.

ICRAC is activated after perfusion of cells with pipette solutions containing high concentrations of Ca2+ buffers (free [Ca2+] < 0.1 nm) with (4Hoth M. Penner R.

In these studies ICRACactivation had been interpreted to be the consequence of depletion of Ca2+ stores. Here we discuss the possibility that a [Ca2+]cyt below 100 nm could also activate ICRAC. A problem in testing the effect of low [Ca2+]cyt on ICRAC is the discrimination between direct effects of low Ca2+ on ICRAC and indirect effects via a passive depletion of Ca2+ stores. In the present study we tried to solve this problem by a combination of both, the patch clamp and the mag fura-2 technique, what allows simultaneous measurements of ICRACand [Ca2+]store. A direct effect of low [Ca2+]cyt on ICRAC could only be evaluated if loading of different Ca2+ stores by the mag fura-2 method could be quantified. Our measurements could be influenced by several pitfalls of the technique that had been described previously (25Hofer A.M. Schulz I. Cell Calcium. 1996; 20: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Part of the compartmentalized dye might have been saturated, and therefore we might have measured ratios at [Ca2+]store much above the K D of mag fura-2 at which signal changes are nonlinear. Thus changes in [Ca2+]storewould have produced only unsignificant signal changes. In our experiments such a pitfall did not seem to play a role, since administration of BHQ was immediately followed by an observable Ca2+ release, which argues against a global Ca2+-saturation of the dye. More critical is the assumption of certain subtypes of stores that probably contain little mag fura-2 or are too small in volume to induce significant changes in a global Ca2+ store signal. If we assume that dialysis of cells with low [Ca2+] passively depleted such subtypes of Ca2+ stores and depletion of which led to activation of ICRAC, such Ca2+stores would have not been detected by our technique. Our finding that inhibition of SERCAs with BHQ (i.e. only the leak determines Ca2+ release) led to slower activation of ICRACthan reduced [Ca2+]cyt argues against a higher constitutive Ca2+ leak rate from those stores that might have activated ICRAC. However our kinetic data can be explained by the assumption that there exist subtypes of Ca2+ stores that have a higher sensitivity to a drop in [Ca2+]cyt than the bulk of Ca2+pools. Therefore these Ca2+ store subtypes could respond, undetected by our method, before global Ca2+ release occurred. Taken all together our data allow two possible interpretations. First, low [Ca2+]cyt activates ICRAC by lowering the [Ca2+] in certain undetectable stores (26Parekh A.B. Fleig A. Penner R. Cell. 1997; 89: 973-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar,27Huang Y. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 31: 19554-19559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (73) Google Scholar), or second, a decrease in the [Ca2+]cytbelow the resting level can activate ICRAC directly and independently of Ca2+ store depletion. Both interpretation have in common that the cell is able to answer in a sensitive way to changes in [Ca2+]cyt independent of global changes in [Ca2+]store. Another interesting point of the present study is the finding that a change in [Ca2+]cyt from 100 to 30 nm did not reduce the global [Ca2+]store (see Fig. 1 a). This seems to be surprising because it is known that the K m for Ca2+ pumping of SERCAs is in the micromolar range (28Lytton J. Westlin M. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14483-14489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which should lead to a gradual decrease in [Ca2+]store. On the other hand it is known that in vivo the [Ca2+]store is regulated by the Ca2+ pump activity. For example high [Ca2+]store inhibits pump activity (29Mogami H. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of the regulatory protein phospholamban enhances SERCA activities (30Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2809-2815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It therefore appears that a cell is able to keep the filling state of its Ca2+ stores constant even if [Ca2+]cyt varies. Since ICRAC is inactive at unstimulated conditions the resting [Ca2+]cyt concentration in RBL-1 cells should be at least 100 nm (at which concentration no spontaneous activation was observed in our study). ICRAC activation by low [Ca2+]cyt could serve as a feedback mechanism which keeps [Ca2+]cyt at a minimal level. Such regulatory properties may play a role after termination of hormonal stimulation when Ca2+ stores have to be refilled. The refilling period is much longer than the time that is necessary to bring the [Ca2+]cyt back to the resting level (29Mogami H. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). It had been described that after termination of a Ca2+ signal the [Ca2+]cyt can be transiently below the control level (“undershoot”; Ref. 31Sims S.M. Jiao Y. Preiksaitis H.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1679-C1689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that at physiological conditions Ca2+ influx limits the time for store refilling. In such a situation a feedback regulation via a low [Ca2+]cyt that activates ICRAC independently of the filling state of Ca2+ stores seems to be helpful. The phenomenon described here could serve as such a feedback which activates ICRACat [Ca2+]cyt below a certain threshold (i.e. the resting [Ca2+]cyt). Recently a hypothesis (11Barritt G.J. Cell Calcium. 1998; 23: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) has been published in which it had been assumed that a decrease in [Ca2+]cyt near the plasma membrane in response to store depletion leads to activation of ICRAC. The present study gives the first direct evidence that low [Ca2+]cyt has the proposed effect on ICRAC. Nevertheless it remains to be clarified if at physiological conditions the [Ca2+]cyt indeed decreases after store depletion in a subplasmalemmal area (11Barritt G.J. Cell Calcium. 1998; 23: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 32Liu X. O'Connell A. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33295-33304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) before it can be decided to what extent spontaneous activation of ICRAC by low [Ca2+]cytparticipates in the activation of SOCs.

Using GAL4-Sp1 fusion proteins and a luciferase reporter, PMA is shown to activate the transcriptional activity of Sp1 independent of the WAF1 promoter. This activation does not require the Ser/Thr-rich region of Sp1 and can be mediated by 41 amino acids (152–193) of Sp1 that are important for the interaction with human TAF130. Because transforming growth factor-β enhances WAF1 promoter activity through both Sp1 and Smad proteins, the role of Smads in PMA transcriptional activation was examined. PMA addition to hematopoietic cells was found to activate a GAL4/Smad-dependent promoter and the transforming growth factor-β-responsive promoter, p3TP-lux. Immunofluorescence data demonstrate that PMA addition to hematopoietic cells induces the translocation of Smad3 to the nucleus. However, Smad3 does not stimulate the WAF1 promoter, but rather slightly inhibits the PMA-mediated induction of transcription from this upstream region. Additionally, transfection of Smad3 did not enhance the activation of GAL4/Sp1 by PMA. These results demonstrate that, while PMA can activate Smad-mediated transcription, Smad proteins do not appear to play a major role in the PMA induction of the WAF1 promoter.

Wei N. Keyomarse K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5239) Google Scholar). Additionally, WAF1 complexes directly with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen, suggesting a role for this protein in the regulation of DNA synthesis. WAF1 may have a direct role in controlling apoptotic cell death as genetic disruption of the WAF1 gene increases the apoptotic response to DNA damage (3Waldman T. Lengaver C. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1996; 381: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Increases in WAF1 protein can be seen during skeletal muscle and hematopoietic differentiation (4Steinman R.A. Hoffman B. Iro A. Guillouf C. Leibermann D. El-Houseini M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3389-3396PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that this protein is important in the terminal cell cycle arrest in the G0 phase of the cycle. The levels of WAF1 protein are controlled both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally. After DNA damage of fibroblasts, p53 protein increases and binds to two upstream promoter sites increasing the transcriptional activation of the WAF1 promoter, while in comparison tumor necrosis factor-α addition to hematopoietic cells modulates WAF1 levels through posttranslational mechanisms (5Shiohara M. Akashi M. Gombart A. Yang R. Koeffler H.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 568-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 6Viziri H. West M. Allsopp R. Davison T. Wu Y. Arrowsmith C. Poirier G. Benchimol S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6018-6033Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In hematopoietic cells that are deleted for p53, PMA1 induces the transcription of WAF1 in a p53-independent manner. This PMA-mediated transcriptional stimulation is regulated by one of several GC-rich regions adjacent to the TATA box that bind the Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors (7Biggs J.R. Kudlow J. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 901-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Mutation of this site reduces both basal and PMA-induced transcription. Because transcription of a reporter plasmid containing only Sp1 binding sites and a TATA box was induced by PMA, it was suggested that PMA may regulate Sp1 levels directly. However, analysis of Sp1 binding to DNA by gel mobility shift and DNase I footprint experiments indicated that Sp1 was bound to the WAF1/CIP1 promoter both before and after PMA treatment. The importance of these Sp1 binding sites to p53-independent transcription of WAF1 is demonstrated by the observations that these sequences are essential for the induction of WAF1 by TGFβ during normal keratinocyte differentiation (8Datto M. Yu Y. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28623-28628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) and for the induction of WAF1 in colon cancer cells by butyrate (9Nakano K. Mizuno T. Sowa Y. Orita T. Yoshino T. Okuyama Y. Fujita T. Ohtani-Fujita N. Matsukawa Y. Tokino T. Yamagishi H. Oka T. Nomura H. Sakai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22199-22206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), as well as the observation that Sp1 bound to these sites interacts with the progesterone receptor during progesterone induction of WAF1 (10Owen G. Richer J. Tung L. Takimoto G. Horwitz K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10696-10701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Nerve growth factor induces both WAF1 and cyclin D1 gene transcription in PC12 cells by activating the Sp1 transcription factor (11Billon N. van Grunsuen L. Rudkin B. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2047-2054PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, in osteosarcoma cells, Sp1 plays a role in histone deactylase inhibitor activation of WAF1 transcription (12Sowa Y. Orita T. Minamikawa S. Nakano K. Mizuno T. Nomura H. Sakai T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 142-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Thus, Sp1 binding to the WAF1 promoter is an essential element in the control of transcription of this gene. It is possible that the regulation of Sp1 through this diverse set of agents occurs by modulation of the basal transcription machinery or other enhancer-binding transcription-activating proteins. Recently, we have shown that the addition of PMA to hematopoietic cells stimulates the phosphorylation of the amino-terminal tail of TBP, suggesting that direct modulation of TBP by PMA could control transcription (13Biggs J.R. Ahn N.G. Kraft A. Cell Growth Diff. 1998; 9: 667-676PubMed Google Scholar). Others (14Naar A. Beaurang P. Zhou S. Abraham S. Solomon W. Tjian R. Nature. 1999; 398: 828-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that PMA increases an essential protein in the basal transcription complex. Studies of the WAF1 promoter transfected into HepG2 cells demonstrated that overexpression of Smad3 could stimulate promoter activity (15Moustakas A. Kardassis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6733-6738Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Smad3 is phosphorylated by TGFβ-mediated activation of the type I receptor and dimerizes with Smad4 (16Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Wu R. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar); this phosphorylated heterodimer then translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to enhancer elements and activates transcription. A dominant-negative mutant Smad4 inhibits induction of the WAF1 promoter by TGFβ, suggesting that Smad proteins play an important role in modulating the activity of this promoter (17Hunt K.K. Fleming J. Abramian A. Zhang L. Evans D. Chiao P.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5656-5661PubMed Google Scholar). In HepG2 cells overexpression of Smad3 also stimulated the activity of a GAL4-Sp1 construct (15Moustakas A. Kardassis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6733-6738Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), suggesting an interaction between Sp1 and Smad3 in regulating the WAF1 promoter. Because Smad 3 binds to the p300 co-activator and to the transcription factor c-Jun as well as forming a dimer with Smad4, it was proposed that Smad3 might activate transcription of WAF1 by forming a bridge between p300 and other upstream transcriptional activators (18Pouponnet C. Jayanaman L. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22865-22868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 19Feng X.H. Zhang Y. Wu R.Y. Derynck R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). To evaluate the complex mechanism of transcriptional regulation of the WAF1 promoter, we have used K562 cells that respond to PMA treatment with megakaryocytic differentiation (21Whalen A.M. Galasinski S.C. Shapiro P.S. Nahreini T.S. Ahn N.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1195-1947Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar). We find that PMA-induced regulation of Sp1 is mediated by 43 amino acids of Sp1 protein necessary for binding to the TBP-associated factor, human TAF130. This PMA activation is inhibited by E1A, but not by an E1A mutant incapable of binding to p300, suggesting that p300 plays a role in PMA-induced WAF1 transcription. Additionally, in K562 cells PMA activated both GAL4-Smad and p3TP-lux, a TGFβ-responsive promoter. PMA induced the phosphorylation of Smad3 and caused the translocation of Smad3 to the nucleus. However, in K562 cells Smad3 transfection did not increase WAF1 transcription or PMA-induced WAF1 transcription. Additionally, EVI-1, a protein that binds Smad3 and inhibits its activity (22Kurokawa M. Mitani K. Irie K. Matsuyama T. Takahashi T. Chiba S. Yazaki Y. Matsumoto K. Hirai H. Nature. 1998; 394: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), had no effect on PMA-induced WAF1 transcription. Taken together, these results suggest that PMA regulation of the WAF1 promoter occurs through core transcription factors, but does not involve the Smad pathway. K562 human leukemic cells obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD) were passaged in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated bovine calf serum and antibiotics at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For selection of stably transfected cell lines carrying the pMEP vector, cells were passaged after transfection in media containing 200 μg/ml hygromycin B for approximately 3 weeks. For transfection, 20 million K562 cells were resuspended in 0.8 ml of PBS and transferred to an electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad). 20–50 μg of plasmid DNA was added, and the cells were pulsed two times at 25 V, 250 microfarads. The cells were then divided into aliquots and allowed to recover for 5–6 h in the incubator. Cells were then treated with CdSO4, PMA, or other reagents as indicated. PMA was obtained from Calbiochem. When using TGFβ-neutralizing antibodies (R&D systems), transfected cells were pretreated for 1 h with antibodies before addition of PMA or TGFβ. The GAL4-Smad3 construct, a gift from Y. Zhang and R. Derynck, was transferred from pSG424 to pBluescript SK using flanking HindIII and XbaI sites, and then into pMEP using KpnI and NotI sites. To make GAL4-Smad3A, a BglII/NotI fragment from the Smad3A expression vector (a gift from X. Liu and H. Lodish) containing COOH-terminal coding sequence and three serine to alanine mutations was used to replace the equivalent sequence in wild-type GAL4-Smad3. To make GAL4-Sp1 fusions, PCR primers were designed to amplify the appropriate regions of Sp1 using a full-length Sp1 cDNA as template. The PCR primers were designed with a BamHI site on 5′ primers and an XbaI site on 3′ primers to allow cloning of PCR products into pSG424, which contains the GAL4 DNA binding domain (amino acids 1–147), and giving in-frame fusions between GAL4 and Sp1. The sequences encoding the GAL4-Sp1 fusions were cloned into pBluescript (Stratagene) using HindIII and XbaI sites, and then cloned into pMEP using KpnI andNotI sites. GAL4 luciferase reporter plasmids were a gift from A. Patterson and J. Kudlow. Cell pellets were lysed in 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm vanadate, 10 mm benzamide, 40 mm glycerol phosphate, and protease inhibitors for 30 min at 4 °C. Debris was removed by spinning for 10 min in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C. Equal amounts of cell lysate were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transfered to nitrocellulose. After blocking in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% bovine serum albumin, the filter was incubated in blocking solution plus anti-GAL4 antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) for 2–4 h. The filter was washed in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for 30 min, then incubated with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After further washing, antibody bound to the filter was visualized using ECL detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For luciferase assays, cells were lysed for 10 min at room temperature in 25 mm Tris-phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100. After a 30-s spin in a microcentrifuge to remove debris, equal amounts of protein were brough to a final sample volume of 100 μl. Just prior to measurement of light intensity, 100 μl of luciferin buffer was added to each sample. The luciferin buffer contained 20 mm Tricine, 1.07 mm magnesium carbonate, 2.67 mmMgSO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 33.3 mmdithiothreitol, 530 μm ATP, 270 μm coenzyme A, and 470 μm luciferin. K562 cells transfected with vectors expressing FLAG-Smad3 or FLAG-Smad3A were incubated 5 h in medium containing either 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine or 200 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate. PMA was added at various times before the cells were lysed in the buffer described under “Western Blots.” 1 μg of anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma M2 monoclonal) bound to 10 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Calbiochem) was added to each sample, followed by an overnight incubation on a rocker at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were then washed three times in lysis buffer, followed by heating at 96 °C for 5 min in SDS buffer for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. K562 cells transfected with FLAG-Smad3 were stained as in Ref. 21Whalen A.M. Galasinski S.C. Shapiro P.S. Nahreini T.S. Ahn N.G. Mol. Cell.

The cells were then fixed in neutral buffered 10% formalin (Sigma) for 5 min at room temperature and washed three times in PBS. Slides were blocked with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.5% Tween 20 (PBS-TB), incubated 1–4 h at room temperature with 4 μg/ml anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma M2 monoclonal) in PBS-TB, washed three times for 5 min at room temperature with PBS-TB, then incubated 1–2 h at room temperature with 3 μg/ml anti-mouse IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (Sigma). After three final washes in PBS-TB, coverslips were mounted on the slides with Fluoromount G (Southern Biotechnology Associates). Previous studies (15Moustakas A. Kardassis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6733-6738Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) have shown that PMA induction of the WAF1 promoter is mediated through Sp1 binding sites, but the mechanism by which Sp1 regulates PMA-induced transcriptional activation remains unclear. The Sp1 transcription factor contains A and B activation domains and within each domain there are Ser/Thr- and glutamine-rich regions (23Kadonaga J. Courey A.J. Ladika J. Tjian R. Science. 1988; 242: 1566-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Since PMA regulates the activity of a number of transcription factors, e.g. c-Jun, c-Ets, through phosphorylation, one possibility to explain the transcriptional regulation of Sp1 by PMA is an induced modification of the Ser/Thr region of this protein. Alternatively, other portions of the molecule might be essential for this induction and thus point to the mechanism of PMA regulation of Sp1. To examine whether specific portions of the Sp1 molecule are necessary for PMA-induced regulation of Sp1, the entire A domain (amino acids 83–232) or portions of that domain were cloned as GAL4 fusions under the control of the metallothionein promoter. This expression vector (pMEP) was chosen because the addition of PMA does not affect the level of expression of this promoter. Thus, K562 cells treated with CdSO4 alone or CdSO4 plus PMA contain the same amount of GAL4-Sp1 fusion protein (Fig. 1 A). When GAL4-Sp1 fusion proteins containing either Sp1 domain A or Sp1 domain B were transfected into K562 cells along with a GAL4 driven luciferase reporter; both regions of the protein were identically stimulated by PMA. For simplicity, only the construct containing domain A was used for further experiments. Although the removal of the Ser/Thr region decreases the level of basal transcription, deletion of this domain does not affect the level of activation of GAL4/Sp1 transcription by PMA (Fig. 1 B). 41 amino acids in the glutamine-rich region are sufficient for PMA-induced regulation (Fig. 1 B). These 41 amino acids contain the region of Sp1 shown to interact with the basal transcription factor hTAFII130, a component of the TFIID complex (24Gill G. Pascal E. Tsing Z.H. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). p300 interacts with TAFs and TBP and forms a bridge between the basal transcription machinery and specific transcription factors (25Janknecht R. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 951-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). This interaction is inhibited by the E1A protein, which binds directly to p300 (26Yang J.Y. Ogryzko V. Nishikawa J. Howard B. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; : 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). The TGFβ induction of the WAF1 promoter is blocked by the adenovirus protein E1A (27Datto M.B. Hu P. Kowalik T.F. Yingling J. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2030-2037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the ability of E1A to block induction is dependent on its ability to bind to the coactivator p300. For this reason, the role of p300 in regulating PMA-induced activation by Sp1 was investigated. The E1A protein was transfected along with the Sp1(152–193)-Gal4 construct and the GAL4/luciferase reporter plasmid into K562 cells and the cells treated with PMA. The presence of E1A blocked the activation of this fusion protein by PMA (Fig. 1 C). In comparison, an E1A protein lacking the p300 binding domain (E1A2–36) had no inhibitory effect. Identical results were demonstrated using the WAF1 promoter (bases −154 to +16) containing multiple Sp1 binding sites (data not shown). These results suggest a role for p300 in the PMA-induced regulation of the WAF1 promoter. Possible direct contact between Sp1 (or Sp1-associated proteins) and p300 may be necessary for PMA induction of this promoter. Since both TGFβ and PMA activate the WAF1 promoter through Sp1 sites (7Biggs J.R. Kudlow J. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 901-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 8Datto M. Yu Y. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28623-28628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) and E1A blocks the stimulatory effects of both of these activators, the possibility that they shared a further common mechanism of action was investigated. Recent studies have suggested that the TGFβ-induced interaction between Sp1 and p300 may be mediated by the Smad3 protein. Smad3 has been shown to bind to p300 (18Pouponnet C. Jayanaman L. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22865-22868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 19Feng X.H. Zhang Y. Wu R.Y. Derynck R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and exogenous Smad3 stimulates both the WAF1 promoter and a GAL4-Sp1 fusion protein in HepG2 cells (15Moustakas A. Kardassis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6733-6738Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). These observations led to the proposal that Smad3, when phosphorylated and activated by TGFβ, mediates TGFβ stimulation of the WAF1 promoter by interacting with both Sp1 and p300. This model would account for the fact that TGFβ mediates WAF1 promoter induction through Sp1 binding sites, but does not affect the binding of Sp1 to these sites (8Datto M. Yu Y. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28623-28628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). If PMA were to activate the Smad signal-transduction pathway, a similar mechanism, in which phosphorylated and activated Smad3 forms a bridge between Sp1 and p300, might explain PMA induction of the WAF1 promoter. To determine whether PMA treatment activates the Smad signal-transduction pathway in K562 cells, the cells were co-transfected with a vector expressing a GAL4-Smad3 fusion protein and a luciferase reporter containing GAL4 DNA binding sites. The GAL4-Smad3 fusion gene was placed in the pMEP expression vector described above. Fig. 2 shows that PMA treatment causes a substantial increase in the transcriptional activity of the GAL4-Smad3 fusion protein. This response is enhanced by cotransfection with a Smad4 expression vector, a protein that dimerizes with Smad3 and enhances its activity, and inhibited by cotransfection with the Evi-1 oncoprotein, a protein that binds to Smad3 and inhibits its activity (data not shown). Previous studies of Smad3 activation by TGFβ have demonstrated that three carboxyl-terminal serines on Smad3 are phosphorylated in response to treatment with TGFβ, and that these serines are necessary for Smad3 functions, including transcriptional activation (19Feng X.H. Zhang Y. Wu R.Y. Derynck R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Liu X. Sun Y. Constantinescu S. Karam E. Weinberg R. Lodish H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94 (669–10, 674): 10Google Scholar). Mutation of these serines to alanines creates a dominant-negative Smad3, which inhibits the Smad pathway response to TGFβ. This inhibition is believed to occur through stable interactions between the dominant-negative Smad and the TGFβ receptor (28Liu X. Sun Y. Constantinescu S. Karam E. Weinberg R. Lodish H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94 (669–10, 674): 10Google Scholar). When a plasmid expressing a GAL4-Smad3A protein, which contains the three serine to alanine mutations, was transfected into K562 cells, the response to PMA was greatly reduced when compared with the wild-type GAL4-Smad3 fusion protein (Fig. 2). This result shows that the carboxyl-terminal serines are important for the Smad3 response to PMA. These results with GAL4-Smad3 fusion proteins provide strong evidence that transcriptional activation by Smad3 is mediated by PMA. To confirm PMA activation of the Smad signal-transduction pathway using a known Smad-regulated promoter, the p3TP-lux reporter plasmid was transfected into K562 cells. The p3TP-lux plasmid promoter consists of three 32-base pair phorbol ester response elements and a 94-base pair sequence from the plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) gene promoter. p3TP-lux is synergistically induced by overexpression of Smads (29Nakao A. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Kawabata M. Ishisaki A. Miyamozo K. ten Dijke P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5353-53362Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, p3TP-lux is strongly stimulated by PMA treatment of K562 cells. In comparison, TGFβ or activin A treatment of K562 cells induces significantly less p3TP-lux activity (data not shown). Transfection of the wild-type Smad3 greatly enhances the PMA-induced stimulation of the 3TP-lux promoter, whereas the COOH-terminal phosphorylation mutant of Smad3 had no effect. In comparison, the Evi-1 protein, an inhibitor of Smad3, does block PMA induction of p3TP-lux. Taken together, these data suggest that PMA regulates the p3TP-lux promoter at least in part through Smad3. The results shown in Figs. 2 and 3 indicate that PMA regulates Smad-dependent promoters in K562 cells. However, PMA-induced stimulation of these promoters could be occurring through the secretion of TGFβ or the up-regulation of TGFβ receptors. Both proteins are known to be up-regulated by PMA in other hematopoietic cells (30Taipale J. Matikain S. Hurme M. Keski-Oja J. Cell Growth Diff. 1994; 5: 1309-1319PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the role of the TGFβ protein in PMA-induced activation of the p3TP-lux construct, K562 cells were pretreated with either anti-TGFβ antibodies (shown to neutralize TGFβ) or control antibodies, then treated with either PMA or TGFβ. As shown in Fig. 4 A, although the addition of TGFβ to K562 cells had only a small effect on p3TP-lux promoter activity, the neutralizing antibodies inhibit TGFβ activation of p3TP-lux, while the nonspecific antibodies had no effect. In comparison, the TGFβ antibodies had no effect on PMA stimulation of the p3TP-lux promoter (Fig. 4 B). To evaluate the role of the TGFβ receptor in PMA-induced stimulation, K562 cells were transfected with a dominant-negative type 1 receptor missing the Smad 3 binding site (31DeCaestecker M.P. Parks W.T. Frank C.J. Castagnino P. Bottaro D.P. Roberts A.B. Lechleider R.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1587-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) and the p3TP-lux promoter construct. As shown in Fig. 5, the dominant-negative receptor blocked TGFβ activation of p3TP-lux (Fig. 5 A), but not PMA activation (Fig. 5 B). Therefore, neither secretion of TGFβ nor modulation of the TGFβ receptor is required for PMA-induced activation of p3TP-lux promoter, suggesting that PMA may modulate Smad3 directly.FIG. 5A dominant-negative TGFβ receptor inhibits TGFβ but not PMA induction of p3TP-lux. K562 cells were transfected with p3TP-lux and either empty pcDNA3 vector or vector expressing a dominant-negative TGFβ receptor. After 24 h, transfected cells were treated with either 10 ng/ml TGFβ (A) or 200 nm PMA (B). After an additional 16 h, cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Recent work (31DeCaestecker M.P. Parks W.T. Frank C.J. Castagnino P. Bottaro D.P. Roberts A.B. Lechleider R.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1587-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) suggests that Smad2, which is highly homologous to Smad3, can be activated by the ERK pathway independently of the TGFβ receptor family. Since PMA regulates the activity of the ERK pathway in K562 cells (21Whalen A.M. Galasinski S.C. Shapiro P.S. Nahreini T.S. Ahn N.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1195-1947Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar), the ability of PMA to modify the phosphorylation and cellular location of Smad3 was examined. K562 cells were stably transfected with vectors expressing either Flag-tagged wild-type Smad3 or mutant Smad3A (with the carboxyl-terminal serines mutated to alanines). Analysis of [35S]methionine immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6) demonstrates that PMA treatment of these K562 cell lines induces the appearance of a diffuse, higher molecular weight band running just above Smad3 in both wild-type Smad3 and Smad3A cell lines. To verify that this band represents phosphorylated Smad3, these two cell lines were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and the experiment repeated. As shown in Fig. 6, PMA induces similar phosphorylation on both wild-type Smad3 and Smad3A. This result indicates that PMA-induced phosphorylation is occurring at a site(s) other than the carboxyl-terminal serines. Because Smad2 is phosphorylated in an ERK-dependent manner and PMA regulates ERK in K562 cells, the effect of the MEK kinase inhibitor PD98059 on PMA-induced Smad phosphorylation was examined. This inhibitor was added to [32P]orthophosphate-labeled K562 cells expressing FLAG-Smad3 prior to PMA stimulation. Immunoprecipitation with the Flag antibody demonstrates that PMA-induced phosphorylation of wild-type and mutant Smad is partially blocked by this inhibitor (Fig. 7 A), suggesting that PMA activates ERKs to phosphorylate Smad3. The observation that PMA activation of Smad3 is associated with ERK-mediated phosphorylation suggests that ERK activity may be necessary for Smad3 transcriptional activation. To determine whether ERK activity is necessary for PMA activation of Smad3 in K562 cells, cells were transfected either with p3TP-lux or"

All A. niger endopolygalacturonases (PGs) were unable to hydrolyze the two monomethyldigalacturonates and 2-methyltrigalacturonate, whereas 1-methyltrigalacturonate was only cleaved by PGI, PGII, and PGB albeit at an extremely low rate. The hydrolysis of 3-methyltrigalacturonate into 2-methyldigalacturonate and galacturonate by all endopolygalacturonases demonstrates that these enzymes can accommodate a methylgalacturonate at subsite −2. TheA. tubingensis exopolygalacturonase hydrolyzed the monomethyl-esterified digalacturonates and trigalacturonates although at lower rates than for the corresponding oligogalacturonates. 1-Methyltrigalacturonate was hydrolyzed at the same rate as trigalacturonate which demonstrates that the presence of a methyl ester at the third galacturonic acid from the nonreducing end does not have any effect on the performance of exopolygalacturonase. Of the fourE. chrysanthemi pectinases, Ogl was the only enzyme able to cleave digalacturonate, whereas all four enzymes cleaved trigalacturonate. Ogl does not cleave monomethyl-esterified digalacturonate and trigalacturonate in case the second galacturonic acid residue from the reducing end is methyl-esterified. PehX did not hydrolyze any of the monomethyl-esterified trigalacturonates. The two lyases, PelX and PelW, were both only able to cleave 1-methyltrigalacturonate into Δ4,5-unsaturated 1-methyldigalacturonate and galacturonate.

Pectin is a heteropolysaccharide with smooth regions of α-1–4-linked d-galacturonic acid residues of which approximately 70% of the carboxylic groups are methyl-esterified. Besides these homogalacturonan parts, the polysaccharide also contains highly branched regions withl-rhamnose and d-galacturonate as the alternating constituents of the backbone structure in which rhamnose can be found to be highly substituted with galactose or long branched arabinose side chains and in which the d-galacturonate moieties can be methyl-esterified, O-acetylated, or substituted with xylose (1De Vries J.A. Rombouts F.M. Voragen A.G.J. Pilnik W. Carbohydr. Polym. 1982; 2: 25-33Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Aspergillus niger was shown to harbor an endopolygalacturonase (PG)1 gene family consisting of 7 members (2Bussink H.J.D. Buxton F.P. Fraaye B.A. de Graaff L.H. Visser J. Eur. J.

The enzymes have been characterized biochemically using polygalacturonate, pectins with different degree of methyl esterification, and oligogalacturonates with different degree of polymerization. The PGI, -II, -A, and -B appeared to be highly active on the homogalacturonan part of the pectin molecule, whereas the activity of PGC and PGE on this substrate was low (6Pařenicová L. Benen J.A.E.

Biochem. 1999; 259: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Differences were also observed with respect to the influence of the degree of methyl esterification. Whereas PGA and PGB were most active on pectins with a degree of esterification of 22%, the remaining four enzymes preferred non-methyl-esterified polymer substrate. Trigalacturonate was the smallest substrate hydrolyzed by all six PGs. The exopolygalacturonase from Aspergillus tubingensis was shown to hydrolyze d-galacturonate from the nonreducing end of the substrate (9Kester H.C.M. Kusters-van Someren M.A. Müller Y. Visser J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 738-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The enzyme was able to hydrolyze digalacturonate. In a recent study it was demonstrated that exopolygalacturonase is only fully active after de-esterification of the pectin and that the enzyme has an additional xylogalacturonase activity (10Kester H.C.M. Benen J.A.E. Visser J. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1999; 30: 53-57PubMed Google Scholar). From the strain Erwinia chrysanthemi 3937, a large number of genes encoding pectinolytic enzymes have been cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli (11Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Condemine G. Nasser W. Reverchon S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 213-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The selected enzymes that are included in this study are the exopolygalacturonan hydrolase (PehX), which hydrolyzes digalacturonate from the nonreducing end of polygalacturonate (12Shevchik V.E.

Gene ( Amst. ). 1987; 55: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For PelW it was demonstrated that the enzyme is active on polygalacturonate and pectin with degree of esterification up to 45% producing Δ4,5-unsaturated digalacturonate (13Shevchik V. Condemine G. Robert-Baudouy J. Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3912-3919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ogl is most active on oligogalacturonates with degree of polymerization less than four, with optimal activity on both saturated and Δ4,5-unsaturated digalacturonate. Those substrates are degraded into galacturonate and Δ4,5-unsaturated galacturonate, and 2 molecules of Δ4,5-unsaturated galacturonate, respectively. For Δ4,5-unsaturated galacturonate, it is known that this compound is not stable and spontaneously converts into 5-keto-4-deoxyuronate (DKI).

The individual Aspergillus enzymes were purified from the culture fluids of A. niger transformants as described earlier (6Pařenicová L. Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C.M. Visser J. Eur. J.

According to international nomenclature the position of the methyl-esterified carboxyl is numbered starting from the reducing end of the molecule. Solvents for chromatography were dried as follows: diethyl ether and ethyl acetate from KOH; dichloromethane and pentane from P2O5. Reaction mixtures were magnetically stirred. The reactions were monitored by TLC on Silica Gel 60 F254 (Merck), and detection was carried out using UV light after charring with a 5% phosphomolybdic acid solution in ethanol containing 10% of H2SO4. Column chromatography was performed on silica gel (Kieselgel 60, 0.04–0.06 mm, Merck) using the following solvent systems (v/v): A 1, 100:1;A 2, 60:1; A 3, 30:1 dichloromethane/diethyl ether; B 1, 10:0.5:5;B 2, 10:1:5; B 3, 10:2:5;B 4, 10:3:5 pentane/ethyl acetate/dichloromethane; C, dichloromethane; D,1:1 pentane/diethyl ether; E, 2:1 pentane/ethyl acetate;F 1, 5:4:4; F 2, 5:2:2 isopropyl alcohol/H2O/acetic acid. Organic solutions were dried on MgSO4. Optical rotations were measured with a Perkin-Elmer 241 polarimeter, and 1H NMR and13C NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3, except when otherwise stated, with either a Bruker AM 200 or 300 spectrometer at room temperature. Chemical shifts are given in ppm downfield from internal Me4Si. Splitting patterns abbreviations are as follows: s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; m, multiplet; p, pseudo. Elemental analyses were performed by “Service Central de Microanalyses du CNRS,” Solaize (France). Donor (0.6 mmol) and acceptor (0.5 mmol) were dried (vacuum dessicator; P2O5; 0.1 mm Hg) for 24 h and then dissolved in 4 ml of freshly distilled (P2O5) CH2Cl2. To this solution, under a dry nitrogen atmosphere, were addedN-iodosuccinimide (0.15 g, 0.66 mmol, crystallized from dioxane-CCl4) and dried-P2O5 and dried (300 °C, 1 h, 0.1 mm Hg) 4-Å powder molecular sieves (0.9 g) followed by the addition of 8 ml of freshly distilled (LiAlH4) diethyl ether. To this cooled (−60 °C) and stirred solution, 0.2 ml (0.06 mmol) of a solution of 0.03 ml of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid in 1 ml of dichloromethane was added (400 μl in the case of 3b). During the reaction the temperature of the solution was maintained below −55 °C (1e, 2 h; 1f, 7 min; 3b, 3 h) or allowed to warm to room temperature (1g, 3 h; 3a, 4 h;3c, 4 h). When the donor had disappeared as monitored by TLC analysis (3a, solvents A 2 andB 3; 3b, solventsA 3 and B 2; 3c, solvent A 3; 1e, solvent D;1f, solvent A 3; 1g, solvent A 3), the reaction mixture was poured into a mixture of 50 ml of saturated NaHCO3 solution and 100 ml of diethyl ether. A small amount of Na2S2O5 was added until decoloration. After extraction with diethyl ether (3 × 50 ml), the organic layers were pooled, dried, and concentrated under reduced pressure. To a solution ofO-benzylated compound (0.2 mmol) in ethyl acetate (7.5 ml) a mixture of 2-propanol/water/acetic acid: 3:1:1, v/v/v, 46 ml), and Pd(OH)2/C (20%, 0.30 g) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred under hydrogen (1 bar) until TLC analysis showed only one spot (3d–f, 7 h, solventF 1; 1h–i, 5 h, solventF 2). The catalyst was removed by filtration and washed with water. The combined filtrates were concentrated under reduced pressure to give, quantitatively, the debenzylated compound, as a colorless solid. In order to get correctly resolved NMR spectra, the crude reaction product was dissolved in water and treated with Dowex 50-H+ (0.2 g) for 10 min. Then the resin was filtered off and washed with water. After concentration the residue was dissolved three times in D2O (2 ml), and the resulting solution was concentrated under reduced pressure before recording the NMR spectra. The non-esterified oligogalacturonates were prepared from polygalacturonic acid as described (21Kester H.C.M. Visser J. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1990; 12: 150-160PubMed Google Scholar). For the preparation of Δ4,5-unsaturated digalacturonate, 1 liter of a 2% (mass/volume) polygalacturonate solution in 10 mm Tris/HCl, 1 mmCaCl2, pH 8.0, was incubated with 5 units of E. chrysanthemi PelX (12Shevchik V.E. Kester H.C.M. Benen J.A.E. Visser J. Robert-Baudouy J. Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1652-1663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for 46 h at 30 °C. The reaction mixture was treated with 80 g of Dowex 50W-X8 (H+). High molecular mass material was precipitated by adding ethanol up to 76% followed by filtration. The clear filtrate was evaporated under vacuum and dissolved in 10 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5.0. The preparation was loaded on a Ag1-X8 column (2.5 × 9 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer and eluted with a linear ammonium acetate gradient, pH 5.0 (700 ml, 0.01–0.5 m). Δ4,5-unsaturated dimer containing fractions as analyzed by HPAEC-PAD were pooled and lyophilized. Δ4,5-unsaturated trimer was prepared as described previously (8Benen J.A.E. Kester H.C.M. Visser J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The concentrations of the unsaturated substrates were determined spectrophotometrically at 235 nm using the molar extinction coefficient for Δ4,5-unsaturated dimer (4600m−1·cm−1) (22McMillan J.D. Vaughn R.H. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 564-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Identification of partially methyl-esterified reaction products was performed by high performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) on a Carbopac PA-100 column (250 × 4 mm, Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA), in 0.02 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5, using a Dionex BioLC/high performance chromatography system with pulsed amperometric detection (PAD). Samples (50 μl, 0.5 mm) were eluted with a 30-min linear gradient of 0.02–0.7 m sodium acetate, pH 5, at a flow of 0.65 ml·min−1. PAD detection was facilitated by post-column addition of 0.5 m NaOH at a flow of 0.65 ml·min−1. The purity of the monomethyl-esterified substrates was tested using the same chromatographic conditions. In order to determine the hydrolysis rate, the reaction mixture was analyzed by high performance anion-exchange chromatography on a Carbopac PA-100 (250 × 4 mm) column equilibrated in 0.2m NaOH, 0.1 m sodium acetate. Samples were eluted with a 10-min linear gradient of 0.1–0.7 m sodium acetate in 0.2 m NaOH at a flow of 1 ml·min−1. The eluate was analyzed using PAD detection and, in case of Δ4,5-unsaturated products, UV- detection at 235 nm. By using this alkaline system the methyl-esterified substrates and reaction products were analyzed as their non-methyl-esterified counterparts. Substrates and saturated products were identified and quantitated using a standard mixture of mono, di-, and trigalacturonate. Unsaturated reaction products were identified by UV detection at 235 nm and a standard mixture of Δ4,5-unsaturated digalacturonate and trigalacturonate. The concentration of the two heterodimers was estimated using digalacturonate as the standard. The substrates (50 μm) were incubated at 30 °C with the Aspergillus enzymes in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.2, or pH 5.0 in case of endopolygalacturonase B. The reaction volume was 0.5 ml. At timed intervals aliquots (70 μl) were taken from the incubation mixture, and the enzyme reaction was stopped by raising the pH to 8.5–9.0 by adding 45 μl of 2 mm Tris, 50 mm NaOH. Reaction products were analyzed by HPAEC-PAD at pH 12 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The injection volume was 80 μl. Initial reaction rates were calculated from the linear increase in time of products and/or decrease of substrate. For A. tubingensisexopolygalacturonase nonlinear progression curves were observed which was due to the strong inhibition of the enzyme by the reaction product,d-galacturonate, as demonstrated earlier (9Kester H.C.M. Kusters-van Someren M.A. Müller Y. Visser J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 738-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In order to minimize the product inhibition, the amount of enzyme used in the incubation mixtures was such that total degradation was less than 3%. For the Erwinia pectinases the reactions were performed at 37 °C using 50 μm substrate in a total reaction volume of 0.3 ml. Substrates were diluted in 20 mm Tris/HCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0, for Ogl, PelW, and PelX or 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.6, for PehX. At timed intervals aliquots (50 μl) were taken from the reaction mixture, and the enzyme reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 1.2% acetic acid, for Ogl, PelW, and PelX or 15 μl of 2 mmTris, 50 mm NaOH for PehX. Reaction products were analyzed by HPAEC-PAD at pH 12 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The injection volume was 40 μl. Reaction rates were expressed in volume activities as these recombinant enzymes still contained some contaminating host proteins. Before removal of the benzyl groups the synthesized compounds were purified as follows. For1e, the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure, and the crude product was dissolved in 30 ml of methanol, and the resulting solution was stirred with 0.5 g of Amberlite 15 resin (H+). After 15 min the removal of the C-4′ trimethylsilyl group was complete (TLC, solvent D). The resin was removed by filtration and washed with methanol (3 × 30 ml). The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residue was chromatographed (solvent E) to give compound 1e(0.35 g, 69%) as a syrup. For 1f, the crude reaction mixture was purified by silica gel chromatography (solventC) to give compound 1f (0.47 g, 88%) as a syrup. For 1g, the crude reaction mixture was purified by silica gel chromatography (solvent C thenA 1). First 0.208 g of pure compound1g was eluted as a syrup and then 0.222 g of a mixture (1:4) of 1g and of the β-linked anomer (combined yield = 80%; α/β = 61:39). For 3a, the crude reaction mixture was purified by two silica gel chromatographic steps (1st column, solvent B 2 thenB 3 then B 4; 2nd column,A 1 then A 2). During the second chromatographic step 0.24 g of pure compound 3a, as a syrup, and 0.056 g of a mixture (1:1) of compound 3aand of the β-linked isomer (combined yield = 40%; α/β = 89:11) were eluted. We also recovered 0.270 g (54%) of unreacted acceptor 1c. For 3b, the crude reaction mixture was purified by silica gel chromatography (solventB 1 then B 2 thenB 3). First 0.33 g of pure compound3b was eluted, as a syrup, and finally 0.066 g of a mixture consisting mainly of the β-linked anomer (combined yield = 54%; α/β = 83:17). Unreacted acceptor 1d, 0.160 g (35%), was also recovered. For 3c, the crude reaction mixture was purified by silica gel chromatography (solventC, then A 2). Pure compound3b (0.27 g, as a syrup) and 0.059 g of a mixture (1:1) of compound 3c and the β-linked isomer (combined yield = 45%; α/β = 95:5). The unreacted acceptor 1e (0.23 g, 50%) was also recovered. After removal of the benzyl groups (see “Experimental Procedures”), the compounds were dissolved in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5, and the purity was checked by HPAEC-PAD at pH 5. As for all synthesized compounds the purity was >95%; they were directly used for the enzymatic degradation studies. The analytical and NMR data of those compounds (1e–i and 3a–f) which have not been published before are shown under “.” The PGs did not hydrolyze 1- and 2-methyldigalacturonate, galactosylgalacturonate, and galacturonylgalactose (results not shown). All six A. nigerPGs hydrolyzed 3-methyltrigalacturonate into 2-methyldigalacturonate and galacturonate, although with different efficiencies (Table I). For all enzymes the rate of hydrolysis of 3-methyltrigalacturonate is much lower (6–18%) than for trigalacturonate, although PGA still retains 38% activity on 3-methyltrigalacturonate. The presence of a methyl group at position 1 or 2 of trigalacturonate influenced the enzyme activity to a much larger extent (Table I). Neither of the PGs was able to hydrolyze 2-methyltrigalacturonate, whereas hydrolysis of 1-methyltrigalacturonate was only observed at a very low rate for PGI, PGII, and PGB.Table IHydrolysis rates of A. niger endopolygalacturonases on monomethyl-esterified trigalacturonatesEnzyme(GalpA)31-Methyl (GalpA)32-Methyl (GalpA)33-Methyl (GalpA)3milliunits · mg −1PGI5800.4 (0.07)085 (15Magaud D.

All monomethyl-esterified di- and trigalacturonates were hydrolyzed by exopolygalacturonase, although the reaction rates were lower than those for the unmethyl-esterified counterparts, except for 1-methyltrigalacturonate which was hydrolyzed at the same rate as trigalacturonate (Table II). For the degradation of all monomethyl-esterified oligogalacturonates, nonlinear progression curves were obtained, and the substrates were not fully degraded even after prolonged incubation or in the presence of a large amount of enzyme. This is most likely due to the strong inhibition of the enzyme by the product, galacturonate, as was shown before (9Kester H.C.M. Kusters-van Someren M.A. Müller Y. Visser J. Eur. J.

The two MPRs, the cation-dependent MPR (CD-MPR) and the insulin-like growth factor II/cation-independent MPR, carry out this process by binding with high affinity to mannose 6-phosphate residues found on the N-linked oligosaccharides of their ligands. To elucidate the key amino acids involved in conveying this carbohydrate specificity, site-directed mutagenesis studies were conducted on the extracytoplasmic domain of the bovine CD-MPR. Single amino acid substitutions of the residues that form the binding pocket were generated, and the mutant constructs were expressed in transiently transfected COS-1 cells. Following metabolic labeling, mutant CD-MPRs were tested for their ability to bind pentamannosyl phosphate-containing affinity columns. Of the eight amino acids mutated, four (Gln-66, Arg-111, Glu-133, and Tyr-143) were found to be essential for ligand binding. In addition, mutation of the single histidine residue, His-105, within the binding site diminished the binding of the receptor to ligand, but did not eliminate the ability of the CD-MPR to release ligand under acidic conditions.

Although an increasing number of different classes of proteins have been shown to interact with the receptors, the best characterized function of the MPRs in higher eukaryotic cells is their ability to target newly synthesized soluble acid hydrolases to the lysosome (6von Figura K.

In the Golgi, the MPRs bind acid hydrolases carrying mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) residues on their N-linked oligosaccharides. The acid hydrolases are then transported from the trans Golgi network to an acidified endosomal compartment where the low pH (pH ≤ 6.0) of this compartment causes the receptor to release its ligand. The acid hydrolases are then packaged into lysosomes, whereas the MPRs travel back to the Golgi to repeat the process or move to the cell surface where they can function in the internalization of exogenous ligands. The MPRs constitute the P-type family of lectins of which there are only two members: the 46-kDa cation-dependent MPR (CD-MPR) and the 300-kDa insulin-like growth factor-II/cation-independent MPR (IGF-II/CI-MPR). Both receptors are type I integral membrane glycoproteins. The bovine CD-MPR, which exhibits optimal Man-6-P binding in the presence of divalent cations (9Baba T. Watanabe K. Arai Y. Carbohydr.

In contrast, the IGF-II/CI-MPR contains a large extracytoplasmic region composed of 15 contiguous repeating units, each approximately 147 amino acids in length. Although there are little primary sequence similarities between the transmembrane or cytoplasmic regions of the MPRs, the extracytoplasmic region of the CD-MPR shares 14–28% sequence identity, including a conserved positioning of cysteine residues with each of the 15 repeating extracytoplasmic domains of the IGF-II/CI-MPR (12Lobel P.

Although the carbohydrate binding specificities of the two MPRs have been well characterized, until recently little was known about the molecular interactions that mediate the high affinity binding of Man-6-P by either the CD-MPR or the IGF-II/CI-MPR. Previous chemical modification studies on the human CD-MPR in the presence and absence of Man-6-P suggested that arginine and histidine residues are important in ligand binding (18Stein M. Braulke T. Krentler C. Hasilik A. von Figura K. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1987; 368: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Subsequent site-directed mutagenesis studies further supported these observations by indicating that His-105 and Arg-111 of the human CD-MPR are involved in Man-6-P binding (19Wendland M. Waheed A. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2917-2923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our recent determination of the crystal structure of the extracytoplasmic domain of the bovine CD-MPR complexed with Man-6-P (20Roberts D.L. Weix D.J. Dahms N.M. Kim J.-J.P. Cell. 1998; 93: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) or pentamannosyl phosphate (21Olson L.J. Zhang J. Lee Y.C. Dahms N.M. Kim J.-J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29889-29896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) has confirmed the presence of His-105 and Arg-111 in the binding pocket and has identified seven additional residues that are within hydrogen bonding distance of Man-6-P. To identify the residues that form critical contacts with Man-6-P, we have expressed recombinant proteins that contain single amino acid substitutions of the residues that comprise the carbohydrate binding pocket of the bovine CD-MPR and have analyzed the mutant receptors for their ability to bind Man-6-P by affinity chromatography. Our results indicate that essential ligand interactions are made by residues Gln-66, Arg-111, Glu-133, and Tyr-143, whereas mutations of residues Tyr-45, His-105, or Arg-135 resulted in only a partial loss of the ability of the receptor to bind phosphomannosyl-containing affinity columns. In contrast, mutation of Asp-103 to either alanine or glutamate did not significantly alter the ability of the CD-MPR to bind ligand. Furthermore, our studies demonstrate that although substitution of His-105 does affect ligand binding, it does not eliminate the ability of the CD-MPR to release ligand at an acidic pH. The following reagents were obtained commercially as indicated: EXPRE35S35S [35S]protein labeling mix (NEN Life Science Products, 1200 Ci/mmol), acrylamide (Schwarz/Mann), SDS (BDH Biochemical), prestained low molecular weight protein standards, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies, Inc.), pcDNA3 plasmid (Invitrogen), restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, T4 polynucleotide kinase, T7 DNA polymerase, uracil glycosylase inhibitor, M13K07 helper phage, CJ236 and NM522 Escherichia coli strains (New England Biolabs), Thermo-sequenase kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Inc.), COS-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection), Man-6-P, protein A-Sepharose, and ω-aminoethyl-agarose (Sigma). Phosphomannan fromHansenula holstii was a generous gift of Dr. M. E. Slodki of the Northern Regional Research Center (Peoria, IL). The plasmid containing a glycosylation-deficient form of the extracytoplasmic domain of the CD-MPR was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (22Zhang Y. Dahms N.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This mutant form of the CD-MPR (Asn-81/STOP155), which encodes residues 1–154, was constructed by changing the proline (residue 155) codon in the wild-type bovine CD-MPR sequence (CCA, nucleotides 584–586) to a termination codon (TGA). In addition, asparagine residues at positions 31, 57, 68, and 87 were replaced with glutamine to eliminate four of the five potential N-linked glycosylation sites, leaving theN-glycosylation site at position 81 intact. Asn-81/STOP155 constructs containing an additional amino acid substitution of a residue located within the Man-6-P binding pocket were generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis according to the method of Kunkel et al. (23Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar). The mutagenic oligonucleotides (each substitution is indicated by the underlined codon) used are as follows: Y45F (5′-AC ATA GCT GAA CAT GTC TGG-3′), Q66E (5′-TTT GTT GAT CTC CAC CAG GC-3′), Q66N (5′-TTT GTT GAT ATT CAC CAG GC-3′), D103A (5′-ACA GTG GTTCGC ATA TTC AT-3′), D103E (5′-ACA GTG GTT CTCATA TTC AT-3′), H105N (5′-CCT GCC ACA GTT GTT GTC AT-3′), H105S (5′-CCT GCC ACA GGA GTT GTC AT-3′), R111A (5′-TG TCG ATT GCA GGA GAT CAT CAC CAC TGC CCG GGC CTG CTC C-3′), R111K (5′-TG TCG ATT GCA GGA GAT CAT CAC CAC TGC CCG CTTCTG CTC C-3′), E133D (5′-GCC TCG CTC GTC AGA CAC AG-3′), E133L (5′-GCC TCG CTC CAG AGA CAC AG-3′), E133Q (5′-GCC TCG CTC CTG AGA CAC AG-3′), R135E (5′-GAC TTT GCCTTT CTC CTC AG-3′), R135K (5′-GAC TTT GCC TTCCTC CTC AG-3′), and Y143F (5′-CTC AAA GAG GAA GAA ACA AT-3′). For each construct, the region in the plasmid that was synthesized in vitro by T7 DNA polymerase was subjected to double-stranded DNA sequence analysis to confirm the predicted sequence. All mutants were cloned into the pcDNA3 vector for subsequent isolation and transfection of COS-1 cells. COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and maintained in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Transfection of COS-1 cells with plasmid pcDNA3 containing the wild-type or the various mutant forms of Asn-81/STOP155 cDNA was performed by the DEAE-dextran technique as described previously (17Dahms N.M. Rose P.A. Molkentin J.D. Zhang Y. Brzycki M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5457-5463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were labeled in methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 50 μCi/ml EXPRE35S35S [35S]protein labeling mix for 24 h. Following labeling, the medium was harvested and dialyzed exhaustively at 4 °C against 50 mm imidazole (pH 6.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MnCl2, and 5 mmβ-glycerophosphate (column buffer). The cells were solubilized for 1 h at 4 °C in column buffer containing Triton X-100 (1%, v/v), sodium deoxycholate (0.1%, w/v), aprotinin (1%, v/v), antipain (4 mg/ml), benzamidine (20 mg/ml), and 2 mg/ml each of leupeptin, chymostatin, and pepstatin. To determine the percentage of each construct that was secreted into the medium, equal aliquots of the cell lysate and dialyzed medium were subjected to immunoprecipitation and gel electrophoresis as described below. Pentamannosyl phosphate-agarose was prepared as described previously (17Dahms N.M. Rose P.A. Molkentin J.D. Zhang Y. Brzycki M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5457-5463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assay the constructs for ligand binding ability, dialyzed media containing the secreted mutant receptors were passed over pentamannosyl phosphate-agarose columns (0.5 × 1.0 cm) that had been equilibrated with column buffer and maintained at 4 °C. Following loading of the sample, the column was washed with column buffer and a total of five fractions (3 ml each) were collected. The column was then eluted with 3 ml of column buffer containing 10 mm glucose 6-phosphate (nonspecific ligand) followed by 3 ml of column buffer containing 10 mm Man-6-P. The flow-through fractions and the material eluted from the column were immunoprecipitated as described below. For acidic pH elution studies, the columns were eluted with an acidic pH buffer (MES buffer) containing 50 mm MES, pH 4.6, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MnCl2, and 5 mmβ-glycerophosphate prior to elution with Man-6-P. Samples were incubated with rabbit polyclonal antisera specific for the bovine CD-MPR plus protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C for 16–24 h as described previously (22Zhang Y. Dahms N.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated material was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Radioactivity was quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics Storm 860) and ImageQuant (version 4.1) software. We have previously shown that a truncated, glycosylation-deficient form of the bovine CD-MPR (Asn-81/STOP155), which lacks the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of the receptor and contains only a singleN-glycosylation site, binds the lysosomal enzyme, β-glucuronidase, with an affinity identical to that of the full-length wild-type receptor (24Marron-Terada P.G. Bollinger K.E. Dahms N.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17223-17229Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Our recent success in crystallizing Asn-81/STOP155 in the presence of Man-6-P (20Roberts D.L. Weix D.J. Dahms N.M. Kim J.-J.P. Cell. 1998; 93: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) or pentamannosyl phosphate (21Olson L.J. Zhang J. Lee Y.C. Dahms N.M. Kim J.-J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29889-29896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) has resulted in the three-dimensional structure of the extracytoplasmic region of the CD-MPR and has identified nine residues (Tyr-45, Gln-66, Asp-103, Asn-104, His-105, Arg-111, Glu-133, Arg-135, and Tyr-143) that are involved in binding Man-6-P (Figs. 1 and2). A comparison of the amino acid sequence of the CD-MPR from bovine, human, and mouse species shows that these nine residues are conserved (Fig. 1). To evaluate the relative importance of each of these residues with respect to Man-6-P recognition, eight of the nine residues located in the carbohydrate binding pocket (Tyr-45, Gln-66, Asp-103, His-105, Arg-111, Glu-133, Arg-135, and Tyr-143) of Asn-81/STOP155 were subjected to site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 1). Asparagine at position 104 was not mutated because a main-chain atom, rather than the side-chain, of Asn-104 provides the predominant interaction with Man-6-P (Fig. 2). To probe the role of a particular amino acid side chain in Man-6-P recognition, both conservative and nonconservative replacements were performed to generate receptors that contained a single amino acid substitution of a residue located in the carbohydrate binding site (see Table I).FIG. 2CD-MPR bound to Man-6-P .

Open table in a new tab The mutant Asn-81/STOP155 constructs were expressed in transiently transfected COS-1 cells. We have previously demonstrated that this truncated form of the CD-MPR is secreted by COS-1 cells (22Zhang Y. Dahms N.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Because many misfolded proteins are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (25Gething M.J. McCammon K. Sambrook J. Cell. 1986; 46: 939-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 26Wooden S.K. Li L.J. Navarro D. Qadri I. Pereira L. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 5612-5623Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), only receptors secreted into the medium were analyzed for their ability to bind phosphomannosyl residues. Upon analysis of various recombinant CD-MPRs encoding soluble forms of the receptor, we have consistently observed a lower percentage of ligand binding activity by cell-associated receptors compared with the activity of the receptors that are secreted into the medium (22Zhang Y. Dahms N.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that soluble forms of the MPRs that are retained in the cell have not folded into a native conformation, whereas those that have entered the secretory pathway have folded into a conformation conducive to ligand binding. To determine if the substitution of a single amino acid in the Asn-81/STOP155 construct caused a global effect on the conformation of the protein, the efficiency of secretion was assayed for each of the mutant proteins as a measure of their native conformation (Table I). All mutants, except Q66N, R111A, and R111K, were efficiently secreted (i.e. >30% of the total receptor secreted at steady state). COS-1 cells transfected with the various mutant CD-MPRs were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine 48–72 h post-transfection. The medium was harvested and subjected to pentamannosyl phosphate-agarose affinity chromatography. The results demonstrate that ∼73% of the wild-type Asn-81/STOP155specifically bound to the affinity column, whereas replacement of Gln-66, Arg-111, Glu-133, or Tyr-143 resulted in little or no detectable binding to the column (Table I and Fig. 3). Although the R111A and R111K constructs were poorly secreted, similar results were obtained when these substitutions were generated in the fully glycosylated truncated CD-MPR, STOP155 (22Zhang Y. Dahms N.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), which resulted in their efficient secretion (80%) by transfected COS-1 cells; no detectable binding of the R111A/STOP155 and R111K/STOP155 constructs to a pentamannosyl phosphate-agarose affinity column was observed. 2N. Dahms, unpublished data. In contrast to that observed at positions 66, 111, 133, and 143, replacement of Tyr-45, His-105, or Arg-135 only partially inhibited binding of the CD-MPR to the pentamannosyl phosphate affinity columns, whereas substitutions at Asp-103 had no significant effect on Man-6-P binding (Table I and Fig. 3). Studies by Wendland et al. (19Wendland M. Waheed A. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2917-2923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported similar results for the H105S, R111K, and R135K substitutions performed in the full-length human CD-MPR. To determine whether the replacement of His-105 resulted in a loss of the ability of the CD-MPR to release ligand under acidic conditions, medium from metabolically labeled transfected COS-1 cells expressing the wild-type, H105N, or H105S Asn-81/STOP155 construct was passed over pentamannosyl phosphate-agarose affinity columns. The proteins were then eluted sequentially with glucose 6-phosphate, MES buffer (pH 4.6), and Man-6-P. The results demonstrate that the majority (>86%) of the wild-type, H105N, and H105S constructs that bound to the column could be eluted with the acidic MES buffer (Table II and Fig. 4). These results indicate that His-105 is not essential for acid-dependent dissociation of phosphomannosyl residues by the CD-MPR.Table IIElution of Asn-81/STOP 155 constructs under acidic conditionsConstruct expressedAffinity columnaThe constructs secreted into the medium were subjected to pentamannosyl phosphate-agarose affinity chromatography as described in the legend to Fig. 4, and the percent of the construct found in each eluate represent the mean ± S.E. for three independent determinations.

Open table in a new tab The MPRs provide a highly specific recognition and delivery system in the cell by carrying Man-6-P-containing proteins from the biosynthetic pathway (i.e. trans Golgi network) or the cell surface to endosomal compartments. The ability of the MPRs to recognize various Man-6-P-containing proteins with nanomolar affinity, such as soluble lysosomal enzymes (27Fischer H.D. Gonzalez-Noriega A. Sly W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5069-5074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), transforming growth factor-β precursor (28Kovacina K.S. Steele-Perkins G. Roth R.A. Mol.

The observed ∼10,000-fold higher affinity for Man-6-P compared with mannose or glucose 6-phosphate (10Tong P.Y. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7970-7975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Tong P.Y. Gregory W. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7962-7969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrates the degree with which the MPRs can distinguish between closely related structures. However, until recently little was known about the structural features of the MPRs that determine their carbohydrate specificity. Our recent determination of the three-dimensional structure of the extracytoplasmic region of the bovine CD-MPR (20Roberts D.L. Weix D.J. Dahms N.M. Kim J.-J.P. Cell. 1998; 93: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 21Olson L.J. Zhang J. Lee Y.C. Dahms N.M. Kim J.-J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29889-29896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) has identified the amino acids that comprise the Man-6-P binding pocket. These residues (Tyr-45, Gln-66, Asp-103, Asn-104, His-105, Arg-111, Glu-133, Arg-135, and Tyr-143), which are conserved among bovine, human, and mouse CD-MPRs (Fig. 1), were shown to be located within hydrogen bonding distance of Man-6-P (Fig. 2 B). The aim of this study was to identify which of these residues provide key contacts for high affinity phosphomannosyl binding by the CD-MPR. Eight of the nine residues were subjected to site-directed mutagenesis. Asn-104 was not mutated because it interacts predominantly with Man-6-P via a main-chain, rather than a side-chain, atom (Fig. 2 B). Of the eight residues altered, only the substitution of Asp-103, with either a conservative (Glu) or nonconservative (Ala) residue, caused no significant effect on ligand binding (Table I). In addition to the amide nitrogen of Asp-103 making hydrogen bond contacts with the phosphate group, its carboxylate side chain is coordinated to the Mn2+ present in the binding pocket (Fig. 2). However, the presence of Mn2+ has been shown to enhance CD-MPR binding to Man-6-P by only 4-fold (10Tong P.Y. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7970-7975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, this finding is consistent with changes in the side-chain group at position 103 having no detectable effect on the binding of the CD-MPR to a pentamannosyl phosphate affinity column. Substitution of Tyr-45, His-105, or Arg-135 resulted in a partial inhibition of phosphomannosyl binding. Our recent crystal structure of Asn-81/STOP155 bound to pentamannosyl phosphate reveals that Tyr-45 interacts with the 1-hydroxyl of Man-6-P, which is involved in an O-glycosidic linkage, and the 4-hydroxyl of the penultimate mannose residue (21Olson L.J. Zhang J. Lee Y.C. Dahms N.M. Kim J.-J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29889-29896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Replacement of Tyr-45 with Phe decreases receptor binding to pentamannosyl phosphate columns by ∼30% (Table I), indicating that Tyr-45 is not critical for ligand recognition. Substitution of His-105 with Ser or Asn resulted in a 50% decrease in binding to the affinity column (Table I). Although the δ nitrogen of the imidazole ring of His-105 interacts with a phosphate oxygen, the phosphate group of Man-6-P makes several interactions with CD-MPR residues; hydrogen bond contacts are made with the main chain amide nitrogen atoms of Asp-103, Asn-104, and His-105 as well as with the δ nitrogen of His-105 (Fig. 2 B). Thus, it is likely that the loss of the imidazole ring does not completely compromise phosphate binding because of the multiple interactions of the polypeptide with the phosphate oxygens of the ligand. Conservative replacement of Arg-135 with Lys had only a moderate effect on receptor binding (∼20% decrease), both in the bovine (Table I) and human (19Wendland M. Waheed A. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2917-2923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) CD-MPR, whereas nonconservative replacement with Glu yields a larger decrease (70%) in receptor binding (Table I). Arg-135 interacts with the 4-hydroxyl of Man-6-P (Fig. 2 B). When lysine is modeled at this position, the ε-amino group of Lys is within hydrogen bonding distance of the 4-hydroxyl of Man-6-P, which may explain the minimal effect this substitution has on carbohydrate recognition. Modeling of glutamate at position 135 demonstrates that its carboxylate group: 1) is within hydrogen bonding distance of the 4-hydroxyl of Man-6-P and 2) introduces a negative charge adjacent (3.1 Å) to the negative charge of Glu-133, which could destabilize the binding pocket (Fig. 5). Thus, the existence of a potential hydrogen bond could be offset by the close proximity of the two carboxylate groups and may explain why R135E exhibits a greater deleterious effect than R135K. Four of the amino acid residues present in the carbohydrate binding pocket (Gln-66, Arg-111, Glu-133 and Tyr-143) were shown to play an essential role in phosphomannosyl binding as both conservative and nonconservative substitutions resulted in the complete loss of binding to the affinity column (Table I and Fig. 2 A). Modeling of the Gln-66 mutations indicates that the presence of an Asn residue would eliminate the hydrogen bond between position 66 and the 2- and 3-OH of the mannose ring. Because Gln-66 lies on a rigid β-sheet (β-strand 3), substitution with a methylene-carbon shorter residue, Asn, results in the side chain being too distant from the mannose for H-bonding. The introduction of the charged amino acid, Glu, at position 66 is predicted to perturb the electrostatic interaction between Glu-133 and neighboring Arg-135 (Fig. 5), which could alter the binding pocket and result in a decreased affinity for ligand. Previous studies conducted on Arg-111 in the human CD-MPR (19Wendland M. Waheed A. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2917-2923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the analogous Arg in domains 3 and 9 of the bovine IGF-II/CI-MPR (17Dahms N.M. Rose P.A. Molkentin J.D. Zhang Y. Brzycki M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5457-5463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that this conserved Arg was essential for ligand binding by both MPRs as assessed by affinity chromatography. Our results are consistent with these findings in that replacement of Arg-111, which interacts with the 2-hydroxyl of Man-6-P (Fig. 2 B), with either Lys or Ala in the bovine CD-MPR resulted in the loss of receptor binding to pentamannosyl phosphate-agarose columns. When Lys is modeled into the structure at position 111, the ε-amino group is within hydrogen bonding distance of the 2-OH. However, unlike the case observed with R135K, no detectable Man-6-P binding is observed. The presence of a Lys at this position does not appear to introduce any unfavorable electrostatic or steric interactions. However, the observed stacking of the aromatic ring of Tyr-102 with the plane of the guanidinium group of Arg-111, which are located 3.6 Å apart, may aid in the stabilization and/or delocalization of the charge on Arg-111 (Fig. 5). Taken together, these studies suggest that the presence of a guanidinium group at position 111, rather than a positive charge, is essential for high affinity ligand binding. Substitution of Glu-133, which interacts with the 3- and 4-hydroxyl of Man-6-P, with Leu, Gln, or Asp abolished detectable binding to pentamannosyl phosphate-agarose columns (Table I). Replacement of Glu-133 with the aliphatic side chain of Leu eliminates the hydrogen bond acceptor atoms of Glu and results in the loss of three hydrogen bond interactions between the CD-MPR and ligand (Fig. 2 B). The introduction of Gln does not alter the hydrogen bonding pattern but does alter the electrostatics of the region, as is also predicted for Leu. In addition to serving as a key contact for the 3- and 4-hydroxyl groups, Glu-133 is within 4.9 Å of Arg-135 and its negative charge, along with Asp-43, may aid in neutralizing the positive charge of this Arg (Fig. 5). Although the presence of Asp at position 133 does not significantly alter the distance between this negatively charged side chain and that of Arg-135, the geometry of the interaction is altered. Furthermore, Asp at position 133 is no longer within hydrogen bonding distance to the ligand. Tyr-143 interacts with the 2- and 3-hydroxyls of Man-6-P (Fig. 2 B). The replacement of Tyr-143 with Phe eliminates the ability of the CD-MPR to interact with the affinity column, indicating the important role of these interactions for ligand recognition. The four residues (Gln-66, Arg-111, Glu-133, and Tyr-143) identified by site-directed mutagenesis to be essential for Man-6-P binding, which combined form all but one of the contacts between the receptor and the 2-, 3-, and 4-hydroxyls of mannose, are located in regions of the receptor with relatively rigid geometry (β-strands 3, 7, 8, or 9 respectively). Residues Gln-66, Arg-111, and Tyr-143 form the region of the binding pocket that interacts with the polar face of the mannose ring, whereas Glu-133 aligns with an edge of the mannose ring (Fig. 2 A). The location of amino acids essential for ligand recognition in regions of limited flexibility may contribute to the specificity displayed by the receptor: the fixed geometry of the region may aid in the ability of the receptor to discriminate between mannose and its 2-hydroxyl epimer, glucose. Residues critical for ligand binding are likely to be conserved between species. This is true for Gln-66, Arg-111, Glu-133, and Tyr-143 of the CD-MPR identified in this study (Fig. 1). Because the CD-MPR and the IGF-II/CI-MPR exhibit a similar carbohydrate specificity for phosphomannosyl residues (10Tong P.Y. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7970-7975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Tong P.Y. Gregory W. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7962-7969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the possibility exists that the two MPRs share similarities in the configuration of their Man-6-P binding pockets. We have previously demonstrated that the two Man-6-P binding sites of the IGF-II/CI-MPR map to domains 1–3 and 7–9 (16Westlund B. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23233-23239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with an essential arginine residue, Arg-435 and Arg-1334, located in domain 3 and domain 9, respectively (17Dahms N.M. Rose P.A. Molkentin J.D. Zhang Y. Brzycki M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5457-5463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Arg-435 and Arg-1334 are analogous to Arg-111 in the CD-MPR. Of the four residues found to be essential for Man-6-P binding by the CD-MPR, Gln-66, Arg-111, and Tyr-143 are absolutely conserved between the CD-MPR and domains 3 and 9 of the IGF-II/CI-MPR from various species (Fig. 1). These results suggest that the CD-MPR and the IGF-II/CI-MPR utilize similar amino acids for high affinity binding of phosphomannosyl residues. The CD-MPR functions to transport acid hydrolases from the trans Golgi network to endosomal compartments, where the acidic pH (≤ 6.0) of the compartment causes the receptor to release its ligand. However, the mechanism that is responsible for triggering this release at low pH is not yet known. A likely amino acid candidate for triggering low pH release is histidine because it has a pK a that falls within the range of the normal physiological pH values encountered by the receptor. The CD-MPR contains three His residues in its extracytoplasmic domain: His-58, located in the loop joining β-strand 2 to 3; His-105, located in the ligand binding site; and His-122, located on the loop joining β-strand 7 to 8. The ability of His-105 to regulate low pH dissociation of ligand was tested using the H105N and H105S constructs. Although both constructs demonstrated a diminished overall ability to bind pentamannosyl phosphate-agarose, they were eluted completely from the column by an acidic buffer (pH 4.6) (Table II and Fig. 4). These results indicate that His-105 is not critical for acid-dependent dissociation. However, it is possible that substitution of His-105 resulted in a change in the pH optimum of binding and/or release. Future studies will be required to test this hypothesis and to determine whether His-58 and/or His-122 are involved in the pH dependence of binding and release by the CD-MPR. It is also possible that a residue(s) other than His, whose pK a may be altered because of the surrounding microenvironment, is responsible for modulating the interaction of the receptor with ligand under various pH conditions. Structural studies of the CD-MPR under acidic conditions will be required to resolve this issue. In summary, we have identified four residues (Gln-66, Arg-111, Glu-133, and Tyr-143) of the CD-MPR that are absolutely essential for the specific recognition of lysosomal enzymes. The conservation of Tyr-45, Gln-66, Arg-111, and Tyr-143 between the CD-MPR and the IGF-II/CI-MPR suggests that the two MPRs utilize a similar mechanism for the recognition of phosphomannosyl residues. Future structural studies will be required to confirm whether the architecture of the Man-6-P binding sites of the CD-MPR and the IGF-II/CI-MPR are similar."

Previous work showed that the transfer of alanine fromEscherichia coli alanyl-tRNA synthetase to a cognate RNA minihelix involves a transition state sensitive to changes in the tRNA acceptor stem. Specifically, the “discriminator” base at position 73 of minihelixAla is a critical determinant of the transfer step of aminoacylation. This single-stranded nucleotide has previously been shown by solution NMR to be stacked predominantly onto G1 of the first base pair of the alanine acceptor stem helix. In this work, RNA duplexAla variants were prepared to investigate the role of specific discriminator base atomic groups in aminoacylation catalytic efficiency. Results indicate that the purine structure appears to be important for stabilization of the transition state and that major groove elements are more critical than those located in the minor groove. This result is in accordance with the predicted orientation of a class II synthetase at the end of the acceptor helix. In particular, substitution of the exocyclic amino group of A73 with a keto-oxygen resulted in negative discrimination at this site. Taken together, these new results are consistent with the involvement of major groove atomic groups of the discriminator base in the formation of the transition state for the amino acid transfer step.

In the first step, an amino acid reacts with ATP to form an aminoacyl-adenylate (aminoacyl-AMP) intermediate in the active site of the appropriate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. While still bound by the synthetase, the amino acid is then transferred to the 3′-end of the tRNA. The so-called “discriminator” base at position 73 and other acceptor stem elements proximal to the site of amino acid attachment are critical determinants of specificity and catalytic efficiency in most synthetase systems (1Giegé R. Sissler M. Florentz C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5017-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 2Musier-Forsyth K. Schimmel P. Acc. Chem. Res. 1999; 32: 368-375Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the period since the original discriminator site hypothesis (3Crothers D.M. Seno T. Söll D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3063-3067Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), the fourth single-stranded nucleotide from the 3′-end of tRNAs (N73) has been the subject of extensive investigation. Indeed, although the details of the original hypothesis, which proposed a relationship been the nature of the amino acid and the identity of the base at position 73, are not entirely correct, biochemical and genetic experiments have shown that N73 is generally important for aminoacylation (1Giegé R. Sissler M. Florentz C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5017-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 4Shimizu M. Asahara H. Tamura K. Haseqawa T. Himeno H. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 35: 436-443PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hou Y.-M. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 93-96Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of this position, to our knowledge, the energetic contribution of individual discriminator base functional groups to aminoacylation catalytic efficiency has not been examined in detail. In the case of Escherichia coli tRNAAla, it has been shown that mutagenesis of wild-type A73 to other standard nucleotides does not completely eliminate aminoacylationin vitro as long as the substrate contains the critical G3:U70 base pair (6Shi J.-P. Francklyn C. Hill K. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3621-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 7Shi J.-P. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2705-2708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is the major determinant in this system (8Hou Y.-M. Schimmel P. Nature. 1988; 333: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 9McClain W.H. Foss K. Science. 1988; 240: 793-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Although a detailed kinetic analysis was not reported, N73 substitution in minihelixAla reduced the extent of aminoacylation to ≤6% of the wild-type minihelix. Thus, the nucleotide at position 73 modulates the efficiency of the aminoacylation reaction in the presence of the essential G3:U70 base pair (6Shi J.-P. Francklyn C. Hill K. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3621-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 7Shi J.-P. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2705-2708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This nucleotide has been shown by solution NMR spectroscopy to stack onto the end of the helix and to stabilize the G1:C72 base pair (10Limmer S. Hofmann H.-P. Ott G. Sprinzl M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6199-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 11Limmer S. Reif B. Ott G. Lubos A. Sprinzl M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 12Ramos A. Varani G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Stacking of A73 with the first base pair occurs predominantly with G1 on the opposite strand (Fig. 1). In addition, NMR experiments indicate that A73, C74, and C75 all stack onto each other in a manner that resembles stacking within each strand of a double helix (12Ramos A. Varani G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). 1The structure of the single-stranded region of microhelixAla resembles that of a strand within a double helix (12Ramos A. Varani G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We will therefore refer to functional groups of A73 as located in “grooves.” For example, N-6 and N-7 are in what would be the major groove of a double helical region, and position 2 is in the minor groove. In accordance with the relatively weak binding affinity between tRNAs and synthetases, presumably due to the need for rapid turnover during protein synthesis, the transition state of catalysis has often been found to be a more significant factor in discrimination than the binding step. To determine the mechanism by which N73modulates aminoacylation with alanine, Shi and Schimmel (7Shi J.-P. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2705-2708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) studied the single turnover charging of wild-type minihelixAla and three N73 variants (U73, C73, and G73). Using preformed, enzyme-bound aminoacyl-adenylate, they determined that modulation of the reaction upon N73substitution does not arise from hydrolysis of the adenylate or a transiently charged RNA, but rather from a reduced rate of alanine transfer to the minihelix substrate. They hypothesized that this reduced efficiency is most likely due to a conformational change, which is sensitive to the discriminator base, and that this change occurs during the transition state of the transfer step. Although the transfer reaction was previously shown to proceed more slowly with N73 variants of minihelixAla (7Shi J.-P. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2705-2708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the specific atomic groups responsible for this defect were not identified. In the present work, we wished to further define the critical elements for the amino acid transfer reaction by examining the effect of atomic group substitutions at position 73 of duplexAla variants. Inosine and all four standard RNA phosphoramidite monomers were purchased from Chemgenes (Waltham, MA). All other modified bases and RNA synthesis chemicals were from Glen Research Corp. (Sterling, VA). Solid-phase synthesis of RNA oligonucleotides was accomplished using the phosphoramidite method on a Gene Assembler Special (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (13Scaringe S.A. Francklyn C. Usman N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5433-5441Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 14Sproat B. Colonna F. Mullah B. Tsou D. Andrus A. Hampel A. Vinayak R. Nucleosides Nucleotides. 1995; 14: 255-273Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides were gel-purified on 16% polyacrylamide gels, eluted, and desalted as described (13Scaringe S.A. Francklyn C. Usman N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5433-5441Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 14Sproat B. Colonna F. Mullah B. Tsou D. Andrus A. Hampel A. Vinayak R. Nucleosides Nucleotides. 1995; 14: 255-273Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar). E. coli histidine-tagged alanyl-tRNA synthetase was purified as described previously (15Beuning P.J. Gulotta M. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 8397-8402Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). RNA duplex substrates were annealed immediately before use by heating at 80 °C for 2 min, cooling to 60 °C for 2 min, adding MgCl2 to 10 mm, and placing on ice. Aminoacylation assays were performed at room temperature using published conditions (16Musier-Forsyth K. Scaringe S. Usman N. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). RNA duplexes (4.5 μm) and all other assay components were pre-equilibrated to room temperature prior to initiating the reaction with E. coli alanyl-tRNA synthetase (45 nm). Initial rates of aminoacylation are proportional to RNA concentration under the conditions used for these experiments. Thus, V o /[S] is an accurate reflection of k cat/K m . RNA duplexes that mimic the acceptor stem of tRNAAlaare specific substrates for aminoacylation by E. colialanyl-tRNA synthetase (16Musier-Forsyth K. Scaringe S. Usman N. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). In this work, we examined aminoacylation of eight duplexAlavariants containing both standard and modified bases at position 73 (Fig. 3). As expected from previous reports (6Shi J.-P. Francklyn C. Hill K. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3621-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 7Shi J.-P. Schimmel P. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6014-6019Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), substitution of A73 with the other three standard bases caused significant decreases in aminoacylation activity. The cytosine and uracil substitutions resulted in 34- and 67-fold decreases in aminoacylation efficiency, respectively (Table I). Whereas pyrimidine substitutions are not well tolerated, an even greater decrease occurred upon substitution of another purine base, guanine, which reduced the activity by 100-fold relative to the wild-type duplex (Table I). The guanine substitution replaced the 6-amino group of adenine with a keto-oxygen and also added an N-1 proton and an amino group at position 2.FIG. 3Structures of bases incorporated at position 73 of duplexAla.

Open table in a new tab Because standard nucleotide substitutions result in multiple atomic group changes relative to the wild-type base, they are not as useful in elucidating specific major groove versus minor groove effects. For this reason, atomic group mutagenesis was next performed using modified purine nucleotides. When 2′-deoxynebularine (Neb)2 was substituted at position 73, activity was only reduced ∼2-fold relative to the wild-type duplex (Table I). This base lacks all exocyclic functional groups, but retains significant activity, suggesting that the major groove amino group of adenine is only a minor contributor to the overall activity. Furthermore, it suggests that the purine structure alone is sufficient for efficient aminoacylation. The substitution of 2′-deoxy-7-deazaadenine (7DAA), which lacks the N-7 atom that can function as a hydrogen bond acceptor, resulted in a significant decrease in aminoacylation catalytic efficiency. The 14-fold decrease relative to the wild-type duplex corresponds to a 1.6 kcal/mol contribution to transition state formation. To probe the minor groove, 2′-deoxy-2-aminoadenine (2AA) was substituted at position 73. This substitution results in the addition of an exocyclic 2-amino group to the wild-type base. Interestingly, this change resulted in a small (1.3-fold) but reproducible increase in activity relative to the wild-type substrate. A second substitution, that of 2′-deoxy-2-aminopurine (2AP), confirmed this result. 2AP lacks the 6-amino group of adenine, but contains a minor groove amino group; thus, when compared with Neb, it specifically tests the effect of placing an amino group in the minor groove. This substitution retained 67% of the wild-type activity and was 1.4-fold more active than the Neb73 variant. Finally, substitution of A73 with inosine, a guanine analog lacking the exocyclic 2-amino group, reduced aminoacylation efficiency by 200-fold relative to the wild-type duplex. This decrease in activity is even greater than that observed upon A73 → G substitution and supports the hypothesis that introduction of a major groove 6-keto-oxygen results in a blocking effect. Using atomic group mutagenesis, we previously showed that tRNA acceptor stem recognition by alanyl-tRNA synthetase involves minor groove recognition at an internal (3:70) position (19Musier-Forsyth K. Usman N. Scaringe S. Doudna J. Green R. Schimmel P. Science. 1991; 253: 784-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 20Musier-Forsyth K. Schimmel P. Nature. 1992; 357: 513-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and major groove discrimination at the terminal base pair (1:72) of the acceptor stem helix (15Beuning P.J. Gulotta M. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 8397-8402Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We now extend this analysis to the discriminator base position. This nucleotide is of particular interest because it is a well known determinant for recognition by most synthetases, including alanyl-tRNA synthetase (5Hou Y.-M. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 93-96Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Moreover, standard base substitutions at this site in minihelixAla are known to slow transition state formation for the amino acid transfer step of the alanine aminoacylation reaction (7Shi J.-P. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2705-2708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 2′-hydroxyl group has previously been shown to be dispensable at this site (20Musier-Forsyth K. Schimmel P. Nature. 1992; 357: 513-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar); however, the function of specific nucleotide base atomic groups was not examined in this earlier work. In the present study, using duplexAla substrates, both positive determinants and negative or “antideterminants” involved in the function of this key single-stranded acceptor stem nucleotide were elucidated. Similar to our previous results at the adjacent 1:72 base pair (15Beuning P.J. Gulotta M. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 8397-8402Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we found that major groove substitutions at position 73 significantly affected aminoacylation activity, whereas minor groove substitutions had only small effects. The importance of major groove interactions at the end of the tRNAAlaacceptor stem helix is in accordance with the hypothesis, based primarily on known x-ray crystal structures of synthetase-tRNA complexes, that class II synthetases approach the top of the acceptor stem from the major groove side (21Ruff M. Krishnaswamy S. Boeglin M. Poterszman A. Mitschler A. Podjarny A. Rees B. Thierry J.C. Moras D. Science. 1991; 252: 1682-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 22Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2834-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The largest positive contribution by a single atomic group of A73 was observed upon removal of a hydrogen bond acceptor at position 7. By substituting N-7 of A73 with a carbon atom (A73 → 7DAA), we determined that this position contributes 1.6 kcal/mol to the free energy of transition state formation. Introducing a 6-keto-oxygen and an N-1 proton in the major groove (A73 → I) has a negative effect on aminoacylation. A similar effect was previously observed in a study of the 1:72 position (15Beuning P.J. Gulotta M. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 8397-8402Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). At both positions 72 (15Beuning P.J. Gulotta M. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 8397-8402Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and 73 (Fig. 3 and Table I), the negative contribution of these functionalities is worth ∼3 kcal/mol. The large decrease in aminoacylation efficiency upon A73 → I substitution can be largely attributed to a blocking element rather than to the loss of the 6-amino group of A73 because Neb substitution, which removes all exocyclic functional groups (Fig. 3), is well tolerated (−ΔΔG = 0.43 kcal/mol). Thus, the N-6-amino group is not a major contributor to transition state stabilization. The minor groove of A73 was also found to contribute very little to catalytic efficiency. Interestingly, the addition of an exocyclic 2-amino group to the minor groove had a small but reproducible positive impact on aminoacylation. Comparison of A73 → 2AA, Neb → 2AP, and I → G indicates that the presence of a 2-amino group contributes 0.17–0.4 kcal/mol to transition state stabilization (Fig. 3 and Table I). It should be noted that for the purine substitutions, atomic group changes are unlikely to significantly affect stacking interactions at the end of the helix (23Turner D.H. Sugimoto N. Kierzek R. Dreiker S.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 3783-3785Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 24Santa-Lucia Jr., J. Kierzek R. Turner D.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4313-4322Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The atomic group mutagenesis data presented here allow us to begin to understand the strong preference for A73 over G73 in the alanine system. Although the 6-amino group of A73 is not a major positive recognition element, the presence of the 6-keto-oxygen of G results in a significant block to aminoacylation, presumably by slowing the amino acid transfer step (7Shi J.-P. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2705-2708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The preference for a purine base at N73 of the tRNAAla acceptor stem is also evident from this work. At least part of the reduction in activity upon pyrimidine substitution can be explained by the lack of the positive N-7 determinant present in the purine bases. A recent high resolution NMR structure of microhelixAla also sheds light on the preference for a purine discriminator base (12Ramos A. Varani G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The structure shows that there is substantial base stacking between the A at position 73 and the guanine located on the opposite strand of the first base pair (G1) (Fig. 1). This stacking interaction may contribute to proper orientation of the discriminator base during amino acid transfer. Moreover, according to nearest-neighbor free energy parameters (25Sugimoto N. Kierzek R. Turner D.H. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4554-4558Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar,26Turner D.H. Sugimoto N. Freier S.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 17: 167-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), an RNA duplex closed with a 5′-G:C-3′ pair containing a 3′-A single base overhang is predicted to have greater stability than the same duplex with a 3′-pyrimidine overhang (ΔΔG = 0.5–0.9 kcal/mol). Thus, the local conformation and stability of the RNA are likely to be altered upon pyrimidine substitution at position 73. NMR studies of acceptor stem microhelices previously showed that the conformation of the CCA 3′-end and the stability of the first base pair are dependent on the identity of N73 (27Puglisi E.V. Puglisi J.D. Williamson J.R. RajBhandary U.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11467-11471Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 28Metzger A.U. Heckl M. Willbold D. Breitschopf K. RajBhandary U.L. Rösch P. Gross H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4551-4556Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In particular, in the context of an E. colimicrohelixfMet variant containing a terminal G1:C72 base pair, the presence of an A at position 73 results in an extended CCA 3′-end (27Puglisi E.V. Puglisi J.D. Williamson J.R. RajBhandary U.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11467-11471Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), similar to the conformation observed in the high resolution structure of microhelixAla (12Ramos A. Varani G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In contrast, a U73substitution results in a fold-back conformation with the terminal A76 in close proximity to G1 (27Puglisi E.V. Puglisi J.D. Williamson J.R. RajBhandary U.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11467-11471Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The conformation of the CCA 3′-end in duplexAla variants containing subtle atomic group changes, such as 7DAA73, is unlikely to be altered in such a dramatic way. However, even small changes in stability and stacking can have large effects on aminoacylation. For example, a discriminator base change from A73 to G in human tRNALeu switches acceptor specificity from leucine to serine (29Breitschopf K. Gross H.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3166-3169Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Moreover, structural studies of human microhelixLeu variants support a close correlation between the identity of the nucleotide at position 73 and terminal base pair stability (28Metzger A.U. Heckl M. Willbold D. Breitschopf K. RajBhandary U.L. Rösch P. Gross H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4551-4556Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In particular, an A73 → G change resulted in a destabilization of the G1:C72pair also present in this system. A previous study of discriminator base recognition in the human tRNASer system used atomic group mutagenesis to incorporate modified bases into position 73 of semi-synthetic tRNAs (30Breitschopf K. Gross H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 405-410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although a detailed kinetic analysis was not carried out, when wild-type G73 was changed to 2AP, tRNASer could be aminoacylated, albeit very weakly. An I73 substitution completely eliminated charging (30Breitschopf K. Gross H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 405-410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in contrast to the alanine case, a minor groove atomic group is critical in the human serine system. Since seryl-tRNA synthetase also belongs to class II, majorversus minor groove effects at the discriminator base do not appear to be a class-specific feature of tRNA aminoacylation. In summary, in E. coli tRNAAla, an A73 discriminator base is required for optimal formation of the transition state for the amino acid transfer step in the aminoacylation reaction. Insights into the strong preference for an adenine over the other three natural bases are gained from the atomic group mutagenesis results presented here. The positive contribution of a purine N-7 and a strong negative effect upon introduction of a 6-keto-oxygen substitution indicate that major groove determinants are critical at this site. Whether these functional groups exert their effect via a direct or an indirect mechanism remains to be determined.

Spectral studies of enzyme species where the natural cofactor was substituted by pyridoxal 5′-sulfate (PLS), pyridoxal 5-deoxymethylene phosphonate (PDMP), and pyridoxal 5′-phosphate monomethyl ester (PLPMe) were used to gain insight into the structural basis for binding of cofactor and substrate analogues. PDMP-DSD exhibits 35% of the activity of the native enzyme, whereas PLS-DSD and PLPMe-DSD are catalytically inactive. The emission spectrum of native DSD when excited at 280 nm shows maxima at 335 and 530 nm. The energy transfer band at 530 nm is very likely generated as a result of the proximity of Trp-197 to the protonated internal Schiff base. The cofactor analogue-reconstituted DSD species exhibit emission intensities decreasing from PLS-DSD, to PLPMe-DSD, and PDMP-DSD, when excited at 415 nm. Large increases in fluorescence intensity at 530 (540) nm can be observed for cofactor analogue-reconstituted DSD in the presence of substrate analogues when excited at 415 nm. In the absence and presence of substrate analogues, virtually identical far UV CD spectra were obtained for all DSD species. The visible CD spectra of native DSD, PDMP-DSD, and PLS-DSD exhibit a band centered on the visible absorption maximum with nearly identical intensity. Addition of substrate analogues to native and cofactor analogue-reconstituted DSD species results in most cases in a decrease or elimination of ellipticity. The results are interpreted in terms of local conformational changes and/or changes in the orientation of the bound cofactor (analogue). d-Serine dehydratase (DSD) is a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of d-serine to pyruvate and ammonia.

Snell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4618-4628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A second low affinity binding site for the cofactor has also been reported (K d ∼ 1 mm) (2Huang Y.Z. Snell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7358-7364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From reconstitution experiments ofd-serine apodehydratase with various PLP analogues, it was deduced that substitutions at positions 2 and 6 of the coenzyme are not critical for catalytic activity of the dehydratase (3Dowhan Jr., W. Snell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4629-4635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the phosphate group in the 5′-position of the cofactor in its dianionic form is essential (4Groman E. Huang Y.Z. Watanabe T. Snell E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The absorption spectrum of highly purified DSD exhibits a prominent absorbance maximum at 415 nm, indicating a protonated Schiff base linkage of the formyl group of PLP to the ε-amino group of Lys-118 (1Dowhan Jr., W.

Excitation ofd-serine dehydratase at 296 nm causes an emission spectrum with maxima at 335 and 510 nm, respectively (8Schnackerz K.D. Z. Physiol.

Z. Physiol. Chem. 1973; 354: 1183-1184Google Scholar). The dehydratase is weakly fluorescent with an excitation maximum at 415 nm corresponding to the absorbance maximum of the internal Schiff base and an emission maximum around 510 nm (8Schnackerz K.D.

Upon addition of 0.5 m glycine orl-alanine the fluorescence intensity at 510 nm increased markedly, and the λmax shifts from 510 to 485 (9Ehrlich J. Schnackerz K.D. Z. Physiol.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1674-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As suggested above a particularly useful approach to investigate the active sites of PLP enzymes is measuring spectral properties associated with the protein and cofactor. In this study we have investigated the environment of the natural cofactor and three cofactor analogues, one active and two inactive, in DSD by CD and fluorescence spectroscopy. PDMP was kindly provided by Dr. O. Saiko (Merck). PLP monomethyl ester, prepared by the method of Pfeuffer et al. (17Pfeuffer T. Ehrlich J. Helmreich E. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 2125-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), was a gift of Dr. J. Ehrlich. Pyridoxal 5′-sulfate was prepared by the method of Kuroda (18Kuroda T. Bitumen. 1963; 28: 21-28Google Scholar). All other chemicals were of highest quality commercially available. d-Serine dehydratase was purified fromEscherichia coli K12 mutant C6 as described by Schiltz and Schnackerz (19Schiltz E. Schnackerz K.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 71: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) or from a wild-type DSD expression plasmid (11Marceau M. McFall E. Lewis S.D. Shafer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16926-16933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).d-Serine apodehydratase was prepared by using the resolution procedure described by Dowhan and Snell (1Dowhan Jr., W. Snell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4618-4628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The apoenzyme had a residual activity of 1.9 units/mg of protein. The specific activity of PLP-reconstituted dehydratase was 100 units/mg of protein when measured at 25 °C. Reconstitution of apodehydratase with PLP analogues was achieved by incubating apoenzyme with a 5-fold excess of the respective cofactor analogue for 1 h at 25 °C in the dark. Excess cofactor analogue was removed by passing the incubation mixture over a Sephadex G-25 (3.4 × 40 cm) or PD10 column equilibrated with 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8. The specific activity of the PDMP-reconstituted dehydratase was 38 units/mg of protein. The enzymatic activity of DSD was determined at 25 °C as described by Dowhan and Snell (1Dowhan Jr., W. Snell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4618-4628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay mixture contains 10 mmd-serine, 100 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 0.15 mm NADH, lactate dehydrogenase (0.1 mg/ml), and DSD. The decrease of NADH absorbance was measured at 334 nm (ε = 6.2 mm−1cm−1). A unit is defined as the amount of enzyme required to form 1 μmol of pyruvate in 1 min at 25 °C under the above assay conditions. Specific activities are expressed in units/mg protein. Protein concentrations were determined at 280 nm. A DSD solution of 1 mg/ml has an absorbance of 1.05 at 280 nm. Inhibition constants were obtained from initial velocity measurements in whichd-serine was varied from 0.1 to 0.5 mm at different fixed levels of inhibitor. In all cases, inhibition was competitive, and K i values were estimated as the absolute value of the abscissa intercept of the replot of slopeversus inhibitor concentration. Absorption spectra were taken at 5 °C on a Cary model 15 or a Hewlett-Packard 8453 diode array recording spectrophotometers equipped with thermostatted cuvette holders. All buffers used for spectral measurements of enzyme solutions were saturated with nitrogen prior to use. CD experiments were performed at 5 °C on either a Cary 60 spectropolarimeter equipped with a model 5002 CD accessory, a Jouan Dicograph III, or an Aviv 62DS spectropolarimeter. The CD instruments were calibrated with an aqueous solution of d 10-camphorsulfonic acid, and all spectra were corrected for buffer solution ellipticities. Circular dichroism data are expressed in terms of [θ], the mean residue ellipticity, in units of (degrees)(cm2)/dmol, using a mean residue weight of 106. Cells of 0.2-cm path length were used for the 220–250 and the 300–500 nm region. Fluorescence emission and excitation measurements were performed on a Schoeffel fluorimeter model RRS 1000 equipped with a 450-watt xenon lamp. The excitation wavelength for emission measurements was 280 or 415 nm, respectively. The optical density of the samples at the excitation wavelength was always smaller than 0.1 for a path length of 1 cm. Apparent K d values of the external aldimines were determined from double-reciprocal plots of changes in fluorescence emission at 415 nm versusthe concentration of the respective amino acid. A number of substrate analogues, such as diaminopropionate, isoserine, l-alanine, β-alanine,l-serine, O-methylserine, and glycine were found to be competitive inhibitors for DSD. Their inhibition constants were determined by initial velocity measurements at different fixed levels of inhibitor. Similar studies were carried out with PDMP-reconstitutedd-serine dehydratase.

Open table in a new tab The absorption spectrum of native DSD gives an absorption maximum at 415 nm with a shoulder at 330 nm (Fig. 1) in agreement with previous reports (1Dowhan Jr., W. Snell E.E.

Addition of glycine or DAP results in a decrease of absorbance at the maximum and in the case of DAP a red shift in the λmax. l-Serine produces a slight decrease in the absorbance and a red shift in the λmax at the visible maximum and an increase in the absorbance at 330 nm. The absorption spectrum of PLPMe-DSD has a maximum at 413 nm with an extinction coefficient slightly higher compared with native enzyme. Addition of amino acids results in a decrease in the absorption and/or a red shift in the λmax at the maximum. In the case of the PLS-DSD, two maxima are observed at 415 and 330 nm, both with extinction coefficients higher than those for native enzyme. Addition of amino acids results in an increase in the extinction coefficients of both bands. Data are summarized in Table II. Fluorescence emission spectra have been very informative of the environment and orientation of the cofactor in PLP-dependent enzymes (12McClure G.D. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1674-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 16Strambini G.B. Cioni P. Peracchi A. Mozzarelli A.

The emission spectrum of native DSD when excited at 280 nm exhibits two maxima at 335 and 530 nm, respectively. In addition to the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (λmax 335 nm) an energy transfer band (λmax 530 nm) is generated as a result of the proximity of an enzyme tryptophan residue to the protonated internal Schiff base of the active site PLP (8Schnackerz K.D. Z. Physiol. Chem. 1972; 353: 1565PubMed Google Scholar). The ratio ofF 335/F 530 is about 3. Excitation of DSD at 415 nm results in an emission band at 530 nm (8Schnackerz K.D. Z. Physiol. Chem. 1972; 353: 1565PubMed Google Scholar,10Federiuk C.S. Shafer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5372-5378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), typical of the emission of Schiff bases of PLP in an aqueous environment at neutral pH (21Arrio-Dupont M. Photochem. Photobiol. 1970; 12: 297-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 22Arrio-Dupont M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 44: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 23Shaltiel S. Cortijo M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 41: 594-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The excitation spectrum for longer wavelength emission of DSD measured at 510 nm exhibits two bands. The shorter wavelength excitation band is located at 275 nm, whereas the longer wavelength excitation band is located at 400 nm (data not shown). Excitation of apoDSD at 280 nm yields an emission spectrum with a single maximum at 335 nm. Upon addition of PLP to apoDSD at a 1:1 ratio the emission band at 335 nm decreases with the concomitant appearance of the 510 nm emission band. The rates of those processes are identical when compared on a percent basis (data not shown). Furthermore, the rate at which enzymatic activity occurs is very similar if not identical to the rate at which the 510 nm band appears (8Schnackerz K.D. Z. Physiol. Chem. 1972; 353: 1565PubMed Google Scholar). Excitation of DSD at 280 nm in the presence ofl-diaminopropionate, dl-diaminopropionate, glycine, l-serine, and isoserine (10 ×K i) shows considerable enhancement of the fluorescence emission at 530 nm, indicating energy transfer from a tryptophanyl residue to the PLP-amino acid Schiff base, concomitant with a blue shift from 530 to 510, 500, or 490 nm forl-serine and isoserine, glycine, and dl- andl-diaminopropionate, respectively (Fig. 2). In all cases, the tryptophan emission at 335 nm had the same intensity. Similar results were obtained when native DSD was excited at 415 nm in the presence of these amino acids which act as competitive inhibitors (data not shown). The enhancement of the long wavelength emission band ranges from 1.7-fold for isoserine, 7.5-fold for l-serine, 11.8-fold fordl-diaminopropionate to 13.3-fold for glycine. Table Isummarizes the apparent dissociation constants of competitive inhibitors of DSD which all form external Schiff bases. The tightest binding was found for dl-diaminopropionate (K d = 44 μm), whereas the binding of isoserine is almost 2 orders of magnitude weaker (K d = 1.4 mm). A K d value of 5 mm was determined for l-serine and glycine, whereas the K d values for β-alanine andl-alanine are 10 and 20 mm, respectively. The binding of O-methylserine (K d = 71 mm) is over 1600-fold less effective thandl-diaminopropionate. Note that the agreement between apparent dissociation and inhibition constants for the active DSD species are quite good. The most tightly bound substrate analogue isdl-diaminopropionate for almost all DSD species and it is the most effective inhibitor for all the active DSD species. When DSD is excited at 415 nm in the presence of 14.8 mmd-serine (about 40 × K m) at 2 °C an emission band at 510 nm is observed (data not shown). d-Serine apodehydratase was reconstituted with PDMP (PDMP-DSD), pyridoxal 5′-sulfate (PLS-DSD), and pyridoxal 5-phosphate monomethyl ester (PLPMe-DSD). The first enzyme species has 35% enzymatic activity when compared with native enzyme. The latter two enzyme species are totally inactive. Emission maxima at 530 or 540 nm for PLS-DSD or PDMP-DSD and PLPMe-DSD, respectively, were observed upon excitation at 415 nm (Fig. 3). The fluorescence intensity at 530 (540) nm for bound pyridoxal 5′-sulfate and the monomethyl ester analogue is about 100 and 58% the value found for native DSD, respectively, whereas it is only 14% for PDMP-DSD. Large increases in fluorescence intensity can be observed for cofactor analogue-reconstituted dehydratase in the presence of various substrate analogues. When PLS-DSD is excited at 415 nm in the presence ofd-serine, dl-diaminopropionate, and glycine emission bands around 490 nm were observed. The fluorescence enhancement was 23-, 17-, and 14-fold for d-serine, glycine, and dl-diaminopropionate, respectively (data not shown). Apparent dissociation constants of cofactor analogue-reconstituted apoDSD were obtained from fluorescence measurements. The data are summarized in Table I. Both far UV CD and visible cofactor-induced CD spectra have been useful in interpreting overall structural parameters of proteins and changes in the orientation of the cofactor. The far UV CD spectrum of native DSD exhibits a broad negative Cotton effect at 208–225 nm with positive Cotton effect below 200 nm (data not shown). Virtually identical CD spectra are obtained for apoDSD and other DSD species that carry PLP analogues. Data indicate that no gross conformational changes are introduced upon cofactor binding. Addition of reactant and analogues, known to form an external Schiff base based on UV-visible absorption spectrum of DSDs, also gave no change in the far UV CD spectrum (data not shown). Circular dichroism spectra were also recorded in the visible region, 300–500 nm, for native and cofactor analogue-reconstituted DSD in the absence and presence of amino acids, Fig. 4 A–D. In all cases, spectra are normalized to the same enzyme concentration. In the absence of amino acids, the visible CD spectra of native enzyme, PDMP-DSD, and PLS-DSD exhibit a band centered on the visible absorption maximum with nearly identical intensity. Although the PLPMe-DSD also gives a maximum around 415 nm, it is about half the intensity of that observed for native DSD. Addition of amino acids to the native enzyme results in a decrease in ellipticity with isoserine giving a spectrum closest to native enzyme alone. Addition of amino acids to PDMP-DSD results in elimination of most of the ellipticity. In the presence of d-serine no change is observed in the CD spectrum of the PLS-DSD, whereas addition of DAP eliminates all ellipticity. Finally, a slight decrease is observed in the ellipticity of the PLPMe-DSD upon addition of DAP, l-serine, or isoserine, whereas glycine eliminates most of the ellipticity. d-Serine dehydratase is a member of the β-family of PLP-dependent enzymes (24Alexander F.W. Sandmeier E. Mehta P.K. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) and belongs to the fold type II family (25Grishin N.V. Phillips M.A. Goldsmith E.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1291-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Other members of this family include tryptophan synthase β subunits and O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase which have been extensively studied with respect to fluorescence and CD spectral properties (12McClure G.D.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7664-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Threonine deaminase is also a member of the β-family that has been studied to a more limited extent (33Eisenstein E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29416-29422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Eisenstein E. Yu H.D. Schwarz F.P. J. Biol.

Structure. 1998; 6: 465-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). DSD is likely to have the same fold as the other enzymes in the β-family (see below) and mechanistic similarities given a common α-aminoacrylate intermediate. Data ford-serine dehydratase can thus be interpreted using the results of these other enzymes as a frame of reference. In order to interpret data obtained for d-serine dehydratase, it is important to understand generally what each of the spectral probes reflects with respect to the structure of a cofactor-bound PLP-dependent enzyme. Each of the spectral measurements used in these studies probes a different aspect of the bound PLP-cofactor and/or protein structure, and each will be considered below, as a frame of reference. Ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra are useful in determining the tautomers of the bound PLP that exist in equilibrium at any step that can be accessed along the reaction pathway. Each of the potential intermediates along the reaction pathway has its own spectral signature, as shown in Scheme 1 (36Torchinsky Y.M. Dolphin D. Poulsen R. Avramovic O. Pyridoxal Phosphate, Chemical, Biochemical, and Medical Aspects. Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1986: 163-221Google Scholar). Note that each of the intermediates may exhibit multiple spectral bands dependent on the tautomeric equilibrium that exists. The tautomeric equilibrium will, of course, be influenced by the structure of the bound cofactor. OASS (37Cook P.F. Hara S. Nalabolu S. Schnackerz K.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2295-2303Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and TRPS (38Goldberg M.E. Baldwin R.L. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 2113-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) exhibit maxima at 412 nm reflecting the ketoenamine tautomer and finite absorbance at 330 nm, likely reflecting the enolimine tautomer, although other species cannot be ruled out. The OASS external Schiff base withO-acetyl-l-serine absorbs maximally at 418 nm (39Woehl E.U. Tai C.H. Dunn M.F. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4776-4783Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), whereas that formed upon addition of l-serine to TRPS absorbs maximally at 425 nm (20Goldberg M.E. York S. Stryer L. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 3662-3667Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 40York S. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 2733-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) due the ketoenamine. In both cases, finite absorbance also exists at 330 nm, which likely reflects the existence of the other tautomer. On the other hand, reaction ofl-serine with OASS at high pH results in a decrease in the absorbance at 412 nm by about 60% with a concomitant increase in the absorbance at 330 nm, and a shift of the remaining absorbance to 418 nm indicating a shift in the enolimine/ketoenamine equilibrium (27Schnackerz K.D. Tai C.H. Simmons III, J.W. Jacobson T.M. Rao G.S.J. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12152-12160Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Fluorescence spectra will provide information on the environment around the tryptophans when excited at 280 nm. Upon excitation in the 280–296 nm range tryptophan residues of a protein will emit in the 324–350 nm range (41Burstein E.A. Vendenkina N.S. Ivkova M.N. Photochem. Photobiol. 1973; 18: 263-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). The blue extreme (324 nm) indicates protection of the tryptophanyl side chain from aqueous solvent in a hydrophobic environment, whereas the red extreme (350 nm) reveals full exposure of the residue to aqueous solvent. For TRPS (16Strambini G.B. Cioni P. Peracchi A. Mozzarelli A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7527-7542Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), OASS (12McClure G.D. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1674-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and TDA (34Eisenstein E. Yu H.D. Schwarz F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29423-29429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the tryptophan emission occurs at 337, 335, and 342 nm, respectively, suggesting partial exposure of at least one of the residues contained in the individual subunits. All three enzymes also yield a long wavelength emission around 500 nm (which is cofactor-derived) upon excitation at 280 nm. The long wavelength band was suggested to result from delayed fluorescence of the ketoenamine tautomer of the internal aldimine, enhanced by triplet-singlet Förster resonance energy transfer from an enzyme tryptophan to the PLP cofactor (12McClure G.D. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1674-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and this was confirmed by phosphorescence (16Strambini G.B. Cioni P. Peracchi A. Mozzarelli A.

We have been interested in the mechanism by which the OBP of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), UL9, coordinates its DNA binding and DNA unwinding activities to initiate replication of the HSV-1 genome at the replication origin. The HSV-1 genome contains three highly homologous origins of replication, OriL and two copies of OriS (reviewed in Refs. 6Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Annu. Rev.

The minimal sequence necessary for origin-specific replication, OriS, contains three homologous inverted repeat sequences known as Boxes I, II, and III, each containing a partially overlapping pentanucleotide dyad (8Elias P.

In addition to UL9, six virally encoded proteins are required for origin-specific replication of the HSV-1 genome in vivo (6Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Annu. Rev.

A generally accepted model for initiation of HSV-1 replication proposes that protein-protein interactions between Box I- and Box II-bound dimers of UL9 cause formation of a nucleoprotein core complex in which the ATR is distorted into a partially single-stranded conformation (13Elias P.

ICP8 binds to the distorted ATR, stabilizing the single-stranded conformation, and also interacts with UL9. This UL9-ICP8-ssDNA initiation complex opens the origin DNA, rendering it accessible to other replication proteins. The ensemble of replication proteins that subsequently assembles at the origin then carries out the subsequent unwinding, priming, and elongation events of replication. In this model, formation of a ssDNA segment at the ATR is essential for UL9 activity contributing to origin unwinding. UL9 has ATPase and ATP-dependent 3′ → 5′ helicase activities that are specifically stimulated by ICP8 but not by heterologous ssDNA-binding proteins (23Fierer D.S. Challberg M.D. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3986-3995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Earnshaw D.L. Jarvest R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1333-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 28Dodson M.S.

The ATPase activity has previously been reported to be greatly stimulated by the presence of ssDNA but not by the presence of duplex DNA (28Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. J. Biol.

Helicase activity has also been found to be dependent on ssDNA; UL9 unwinds partially single-stranded DNA substrates in the presence of ATP but has not been observed to unwind fully duplex DNAs or plasmids, even if they contain origin DNA or if ICP8 is present (23Fierer D.S.

These observations further support a model in which distortion of the ATR is a prerequisite for initiation of replication. Sequence analysis and mutagenesis of the 851-amino acid UL9 polypeptide have led to the assignment of functional domains (Fig. 2). The domain comprised of the N-terminal two-thirds of the polypeptide chain (the N-domain) contains conserved ATP binding and helicase motifs that are critical for origin-specific replication (31Gorbalenya A.E.

The C-domain also contains the region of interaction with ICP8 (40Boehmer P.E. Craigie M.C. Stow N.D. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29329-29334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the critical DNA binding and helicase functions of UL9 are present on two separable but linked domains. This structural arrangement may provide for regulation of UL9 activity, as discussed later in this report. Although the various functions of UL9 as an OBP, an ATPase, and a helicase have been identified and characterized, the exact mechanism by which UL9 functions to unwind DNA at the origin is not well understood. The enzymatic functions of UL9 have been consistently observed to require a single-stranded or partially single-stranded DNA substrate, implying that distortion of the origin to form a ssDNA region is a prerequisite for UL9 enzymatic activity in vivo. In this study, we have more rigorously examined the stimulation of UL9 ATPase activity by DNA coeffectors. We present evidence that duplex DNA containing Box I can act to specifically and dramatically stimulate UL9 ATPase activity. We also show that this DNA is a poor coeffector for the ATPase activity of the isolated N-domain and that the isolated N-domain is a more active enzyme than full-length UL9. The implications of these findings for the role and regulation of UL9 in unwinding origin DNA are discussed.

Constantin (University of Arizona). Polyclonal antiserum to UL9 was a generous gift from Dr. I. R. Lehman (Stanford University). Synthetic DNAs were obtained from Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used as coeffectors in ATPase assays are shown in Fig. 3. The complementary oligonucleotides BoxI/U (Box I upper) (5′-CGAAGCGTTCGCACTTCGTCCC-3′) and BoxI/L (Box I lower) (5′-GGGACGAAGTGCGAACGCTTCG-3′) comprised the 22-bp segment of OriS containing Box I. The complementary oligonucleotides Mut/U (Mutant upper) (5′-CGAAGCGGGCGACCTTCGTCCC3′) and Mut/L (Mutant lower) 5′-GGGACGAAGGTCGCCCGCTTCG-3′) were identical to BoxI/U and BoxI/L, respectively, with the exception of the 4 underlined base changes. The complementary oligonucleotides Ran/U (Random upper) (5′-CCATCGCTCTGCTGCAGCTAGC-3′) and Ran/L (Random lower) (5′-GCTAGCTGCAGCAGAGCGATGG-3′) were equal in base composition to BoxI/U and BoxI/L, respectively, but were of randomized sequence. The concentration of each oligonucleotide was confirmed by measurement of A 260, using the extinction coefficients provided by the manufacturer. Duplex DNAs BoxI/DS, Mut/DS, and Ran/DS were made by heating equimolar mixtures of the component upper and lower strands to 95 °C and allowing them to cool slowly to 25 °C. For use in ATPase activity assays 8 μmsingle-stranded or duplex oligonucleotide stocks were serially diluted in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA. Plasmid pGAD-UL9t contains the UL9 gene derived from pVL941/UL9 (28Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1213-1219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in pGAD-424 (CLONTECH), flanked by EcoRI and XbaI sites. A partially self-complementary DNA (5′-GATCCCTAACCGGTTAGG-3′) containing a stop codon (TAA) and BamHI ends was self-annealed and then inserted into the distal BamHI site in the UL9gene on pGAD-UL9t to truncate the gene at amino acid 536. The 3651-bpEcoRI-XbaI DNA fragment containing the truncatedUL9 gene (UL9/N) was then inserted into the baculovirus transfer vector pBacPAK9. The sequence of the entireUL9/N gene in the resultant recombinant plasmid pBP-UL9/N was confirmed by the sequencing laboratory at the University of Arizona. pBP-UL9/N was then used to generate the recombinant baculovirus AcNPV/UL9/N as described by theCLONTECH manual. Stocks of recombinant baculovirus were propagated in Sf9 cells grown in TMNFH containing 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate, and 2 μg/ml fungizone (TMNFH medium) (42Summers M.D. Smith G.E. A Manual of Methods for Baculovirus Vectors and Insect Cell Procedures.Texas Agricultural Experiment Station, Bulletin 1555. Texas A & M University, College Station, TX1987Google Scholar). Buffer A, used during purification of UL9/N and UL8 protein, contained 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 1.0 mm DTT, 10 mm NaHSO3, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 10 μmleupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.2 mm benzamidine HCl. Buffer B was the same as Buffer A except it contained 100 mm NaCl. A 400-ml suspension culture of Sf9 cells was grown to a cell density of 2.4 × 106cells/ml in TMNFH medium containing 0.1% Pluronic F-68 (TMNFH/P medium). The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 100 ×g for 15 min and resuspended in fresh TMNFH/P medium. Fifty ml of AcNPV/UL9/N viral stock (at approximately 2 × 108 plaque-forming units/ml) were added to the cells for a final concentration of 9.4 × 106 cells/ml. After 1 h at 24 °C, the cells were divided into two 2-liter roller bottles, and fresh TMNFH/P medium was added to dilute the cells to 9.4 × 105 cells/ml. The roller bottles were placed upright in an orbital shaker at 27 °C and shaken at 140 rpm with loosened caps. Seventy hours later, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cells were gently resuspended in 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.6, containing 1.0 mm DTT, 150 mm NaCl, and 5% (w/v) glycerol. Centrifugation as above yielded 2.8 g wet cells that were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The cells were subsequently thawed at 37 °C, immediately resuspended in 30 ml of cold Buffer A, transferred to a chilled Dounce homogenizer, and lysed using 10 strokes with a tight pestle. The suspension was centrifuged at 300 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. The cytosolic extract was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C. After thawing on ice, the cytosolic extract was brought to 100 mm NaCl (as determined by conductivity measurements) by dropwise addition of 4 m NaCl while stirring. The extract was cleared by centrifugation at 24,000 rpm in a Beckman Ti50 rotor for 30 min. The outlet of a 12-ml DEAE-Sepharose column was connected directly to a 2-ml heparin-Sepharose CL-4B column, and both columns were equilibrated with Buffer B. The cleared extract was loaded onto the columns at 10–20 ml/h. The columns were washed extensively with Buffer B (about 68 ml) until A 280 returned to base line, at which point the DEAE-Sepharose column was removed. The heparin-Sepharose column was eluted with a 20-ml gradient from 100 to 800 mm NaCl in Buffer A at 10 ml/h, and 700-μl fractions were collected. After removal of analytical samples from selected fractions, all fractions were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Conductivity measurements were recorded for the analytical samples, which were then prepared for SDS-PAGE using a pyrogallol red-molybdate precipitation reagent as described (43Aguilar R.M. Bustamante J.J. Hernandez P.G. Martinez A.L. Haro L.S. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 267: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). UL9/N protein eluted at 250–650 mm NaCl, as determined by conductivity measurements. Densitometry of peak fraction 18 (described below) showed that the full-length UL9/N protein and its degradation products comprised 26 and 23% of the total protein, respectively. As a negative control, the above procedures for expression and purification of UL9/N protein were performed using a recombinant baculovirus strain expressing UL8 protein (AcNPV/UL8/H) in place of AcNPV/UL9/N. The protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on identical 10% polyacrylamide gels that were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting. The nitrocellulose was probed with UL9 antiserum followed by protein A-horseradish peroxidase conjugate; 4-chloro-1-naphthol was used as the substrate for color development. The Coomassie-stained gels were scanned with a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech UltraScan XL densitometer. UL9/N and its degradation products comprised approximately 49% of the total protein. UL9 protein was expressed in Sf9 cells and purified from nuclear extracts as described (28Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1213-1219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purity was 95% as determined by densitometry of a Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel loaded with approximately 6 μg of protein. Unless otherwise noted, the reaction mixtures contained 40 mm HEPPS buffer, pH 8.3, 2 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and varying amounts of purified UL9 or partially purified UL9/N. The DNA-dependent ATPase reactions were initiated by the addition of oligonucleotides to a final concentration of 0–400 nm (for duplex DNAs) or 0–800 nm (for ssDNAs) and concomitant transfer of the reaction tubes from ice to a temperature-controlled water bath. After 1 h at 37 °C (UL9 reaction mixtures) or 15 min at 30 °C (UL9/N reaction mixtures), the reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.75 ml of acidic molybdenum/malachite green solution (44Lanzetta P. Alvarez L. Reinach P. Candia O. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar). (Because a significant loss of UL9/N activity was observed upon extended incubation at 37 °C, both the time and temperature of the assay reaction were reduced compared with the UL9 reaction. At 30 °C approximately 80% of UL9/N ATPase activity was retained over 15 min. UL9/N was found to be significantly more active at 37 than 30 °C, however.) Color was allowed to develop for 5 or 6 min at room temperature; color development was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 34% (w/v) sodium citrate, and the formation of inorganic phosphate was determined by measurement of A 650. The blank contained all reaction components except DNA. To compensate for variations in enzyme concentration from run to run, an internal standard reaction was included in each run, and all measured activities were normalized relative to this standard. For UL9 assays, the standard reaction contained 572 nm BoxI/DS. For UL9/N assays, the standard reaction contained 800 nm (dT)22. For each DNA substrate, the normalized data from 3 to 6 replicate series were combined and then fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the curve fit feature of Kaleidograph 3.08 (Synergy Software). The standard errors for the curve fit parameters and the averages and standard deviations for the data were also calculated by Kaleidograph. Assays of UL9/N or UL8 column fractions were as described above for UL9/N except that the reaction mixtures were made up with or without DNA, and reactions were initiated by the addition of 0.5 μl of a column fraction. Reactions were performed in duplicate in both the presence and absence of 800 nm (dT)22. We examined the stimulation of UL9 ATPase activity by various duplex and single-stranded 22-mer DNAs (Fig. 3) derived from the Box I sequence of OriS (Fig. 1). These results are summarized in Fig. 4 and Table I. Of the duplex DNAs examined, only BoxI/DS greatly stimulated UL9 ATPase activity, displaying both a high relative V max of 1.18 (corresponding to 2.8 × 103 nmol of ATP hydrolyzed/nmol enzyme·h) and the highest apparent affinity (K d (app) = 29 nm) (Fig. 4 a and Table I). In contrast, duplex DNAs in which 4 bases were mutated to eliminate specific binding by UL9 (Mut/DS) or in which the base sequence was scrambled (Ran/DS) were relatively poor activators, exhibiting lower activities (V max = 0.76 and 0.49, respectively) and significantly lower apparent affinities (K d (app) = 690 and 240 nm, respectively). The Box I, random, and mutant ssDNAs exhibited poor to moderate stimulatory capacity (Fig. 4 b). Although the upper strands exhibited approximately the same relativeV max as BoxI/DS (ranging from 1.09 to 1.31), their apparent affinities were significantly reduced (by 25–51-fold). The lower strands (BoxI/L, Mut/L, and Ran/L) displayed significantly reduced relative activities (V max = 0.27, 0.61, and 0.34, respectively) and intermediate affinities (reduced by 9–21-fold). The specific and dramatic effect of duplex Box I on UL9 ATPase activity is most clearly illustrated by a comparison ofV max/K d (app) for the various DNAs (Fig. 4 c). This measure of activation efficiency, which is analogous tok cat /K m as a measure of catalytic efficiency, is 20–56-fold higher for duplex Box I than for any of the other DNAs examined.Table IKinetic parameters for UL9 ATPase activity in the presence of various duplex and single-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotidesDNAStrand(s)RelativeV maxK d (app)nmBox IBoxI/DS1.18 ± 0.0629 ± 4.8BoxI/U1.09 ± 0.09740 ± 100BoxI/L0.27 ± 0.03260 ± 60MutantMut/DS0.76 ± 0.16690 ± 210Mut/U1.08 ± 0.241480 ± 460Mut/L0.61 ± 0.05620 ± 100RandomRan/DS0.49 ± 0.09240 ± 85Ran/U1.31 ± 0.18800 ± 180Ran/L0.34 ± 0.08420 ± 210 Open table in a new tab A recombinant protein consisting of the N-domain of UL9 (UL9/N) (Fig. 2) was partially purified from Sf9 cytosolic extracts by DEAE-Sepharose and heparin-Sepharose chromatography. A major band running at the expected molecular weight of UL9/N (60,000) was apparent on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel of the column fractions, peaking in fractions 14–18 (Fig. 5 a). This band also reacted with anti-UL9 antiserum (Fig. 5 b). In addition, three moderate intensity bands of lower apparent molecular weight were visible by Coomassie staining and immunodetection with anti-UL9 antiserum, indicating that they were products of UL9/N degradation. Indeed, significant degradation of UL9/N was observed throughout the purification procedure (data not shown), despite the presence of multiple protease inhibitors. The full-length UL9/N protein and its degradation products comprised approximately 49% of the total protein. As a control, an identical purification procedure was carried out on cytosolic extracts from cells infected with a baculovirus expressing a different HSV-1 protein (UL8). Column fractions from this procedure yielded no major 60-kDa band visible by Coomassie staining and no bands visible by immunodetection with anti-UL9 antiserum (data not shown). The UL9/N column fractions were assayed for ATPase activity in the presence and absence of 800 nm (dT)22. Both activities were found to copurify with the immunoreactive 60-kDa polypeptide, peaking in fractions 14–18 (Fig. 6 a). The addition of (dT)22 was found to stimulate the ATPase activity of the peak fractions by 10–16-fold. Quantitation of the amount of full-length UL9/N in fraction 18 by densitometry allowed the DNA-dependent ATPase activity of UL9/N to be estimated at 3.6 ± 1.5 × 104 nmol of ATP hydrolyzed per"
https://openalex.org/W2073588381,"We have previously demonstrated that the 5′-flanking regions from the rat serum amyloid A1 (SAA1) promoter are necessary and sufficient to confer specific cytokine-induced expression in cultured hepatoma cells. Deletion analysis identified a tissue-specific repressor (TSR) regulatory element, located between bp −289 and −256, that functioned as a silencer, contributing to the transcription repression on SAA1 promoter in nonliver cells. When this 34-base pair TSR-binding element was used as a probe in electrophoretic mobility shift assays, an intense DNA-protein complex was detected in nuclear extracts from HeLa and several other nonliver tissues. This TSR binding activity, however, was undetectable in extracts from liver or liver-derived cells. The distribution of TSR binding activity is therefore consistent with its regulatory role in repressing SAA1 expression in a tissue-specific manner. In this study, we purified TSR protein from HeLa nuclear extracts and showed that it has a molecular mass of approximately 50 kDa. Surprisingly, protein sequencing and antibody supershift experiments identified TSR as transcription factor AP-2. Subsequent functional analysis showed that forced expression of AP-2 in HepG2 cells could indeed inhibit conditioned medium-induced SAA1 promoter activation. Moreover, expression of a dominant-negative mutant of AP-2 in HeLa cells or mutation of the AP-2-binding site led to derepression of the SAA1 promoter, presumably by neutralizing the inhibitory effects of the endogenous wild-type AP-2. Our results therefore demonstrate a novel function for AP-2 in the transcriptional repression of SAA1 promoter. Together with its tissue distribution, AP-2 may contribute to SAA1's highly liver-specific expression pattern by restricting its expression in nonliver cells."

Previously, we had shown that alternative modules of static DNA curvature could partially replace IHF in recombination. Now we use regions of single-stranded DNA as a flexible tether to address whether the function of IHF in recombination is simply to reduce persistence length. Although we find that these modules clearly enhance recombination in the absence of IHF, they are not perfect replacements. In addition, evidence is presented that the efficacy of a flexibility swap is specific to a particular IHF site. This may indicate that additional functions beyond simple deformation of DNA are required of IHF.

In some cases, DNA structure has been shown to have a specific function and not simply be a consequence of protein binding or DNA sequence (1Goodman S.D. Nash H.A.

DNA bending is known to be associated with virtually all types of nucleoprotein systems including DNA replication, transcription, and recombination (5Travers A.A. Cell. 1990; 60: 177-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 6Travers A.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1991; 1: 114-122Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Interestingly, DNA deformation is often relegated to an accessory function that simply modulates the function of other essential components. In the few cases where DNA deformation has been proven to be functional, it is unclear how the structure affects function. Although there is reason to believe that the deformation in and of itself induces effects on the structure of neighboring DNA (7Ramstein J. Lavery R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1988; 85: 7231-7235Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), a parsimonious theory is that DNA bending could simply reduce the native persistence length of DNA to allow adjacent regions of DNA and/or proteins bound there to interact. The Escherichia coli bacteriophage λsite-specific recombination system was the first system where DNA deformation was proved to be functional (1Goodman S.D. Nash H.A. Nature. 1989; 341: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In this system, a 250-bp1 site (attP) on the phage is required for conservative integration of the phage genome into a unique site (attB) on theE. coli chromosome. attP and attB share 15 bp of perfect sequence identity within which the cleavage and ligation steps of recombination occur. The integrated prophage product has phage bacterial junctions called attL andattR for left and right attachment sites, respectively. The phage-encoded integrase (Int) protein performs all of the recombination steps. The prophage can be excised from the bacterial chromosome by Int but only in conjunction with another phage-encoded protein, excisionase (Xis). In addition to the phage-encoded proteins, one host protein, integration host factor (IHF), is absolutely required for efficient recombination. IHF is a site-specific DNA-binding protein that, upon binding, invariably bends its DNA target into a virtual U-turn (8Rice P.A. Yang S. Mizuuchi K. Nash H.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 1295-1306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 9Rice P.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 86-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Three such high affinity IHF binding sites exist on attP whereas none are found on attB. Consequently, recombination distributes one of these sites to attL and two toattR, although the most distal site on attR is not required for excisive recombination. Previously, we had demonstrated that the requirement for IHF binding for both integrative and excisive recombination could be functionally replaced through a bend swap, an exchange of bending modules. Specifically, IHF-induced bends were substituted with sequence-directed DNA deformation that approximates native IHF-induced curvature (1Goodman S.D. Nash H.A. Nature. 1989; 341: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 4Goodman S.D. Nicholson S.C. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1992; 89: 11910-11914Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Recombination substrates, in which all of the required IHF sites were replaced with properly phased DNA bends, were competent for recombination in the absence of IHF (4Goodman S.D. Nicholson S.C. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1992; 89: 11910-11914Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The results of these experiments strongly suggest that the role of IHF in phageλ site-specific recombination is to act as an architectural element. Studies on excisive substrates, which, unlike attP, each require a single IHF site, have demonstrated that one role of IHF is to assist Int binding to the DNA (10Segall A.M. Goodman S.D. Nash H.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4536-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 11Kim S. Moitoso de Vargas L. Nunes-Duby S.E. Landy A. Cell. 1990; 63: 773-781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Int possesses two DNA binding domains. The amino-terminal domain binds with high affinity to arm-type sites found at the periphery of attP, attR, andattL, whereas the carboxyl-terminal domain, which possesses recombination functions, binds with lower affinity to core-type sites that flank the region of strand exchange. One effect of IHF binding is to stabilize the interaction of individual Int promoters simultaneously bound to both high and low affinity sites. Because such bivalent binding would require the intervening DNA to bend and because that segment of DNA is well below the persistence length of B-form DNA, it is possible that the sole function of IHF is to reduce the persistence length of the DNA between these two types of sites. We have tested whether a module of flexibility can replace IHF for function in bacteriophage λ recombination. It has been demonstrated that regions of single-stranded DNA possess much higher capacity for isotropic flexibility than native duplex DNA (12Mills J.B. Cooper J.P. Hagerman P.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1797-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 13Kahn J.D. Yun E. Crothers D.M. Nature. 1994; 368: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 14Mills J.B.

Heteroduplex regions of DNA possess single-stranded character with reduced persistence length (13Kahn J.D. Yun E. Crothers D.M. Nature. 1994; 368: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). By substituting the essential IHF binding sites with heteroduplex DNA we were able to examine whether flexible DNA could substitute for IHF in excisive recombination. We found that, although these flexible regions could adequately replace IHF in the formation of at least one type of nucleoprotein complex, they failed to completely support IHF-independent excisive recombination. Moreover, despite making dramatic changes in the IHF recognition sites, we observed that the heteroduplex DNA was still a specific site for functional IHF binding. E. coli DH5 was host for plasmid propagation. pHN864 (15Gardner J.F. Nash H.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) contains both a wild typeattL and an attR locus. For quantitation, some DNA substrates were end-labeled with 32P using the RTS T4 kinase labeling system (Life Technologies, Inc.). Labeled oligonucleotides were purified using a nucleotide removal kit (QIAGEN) and eluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. All DNA substrates were purified by gel electrophoresis through 2% agarose followed by extraction using a gel extraction kit (QIAGEN); DNA was eluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. Double-stranded attL and attR DNA fragments were generated by the PCR using pHN864 as a template and the following oligonucleotides (Table I): oSG117 and oSG122 for attR, oSG46 and oSG49 for attL, and oSG153 and oSG49 for saf attL. The PCR was performed withTaq polymerase (Promega) with the following temperature incubation profile: 94 °C for 3 min. followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 3 min. The heteroduplex (T-bubble) DNA substrates were generated by annealing and extending partially complementary oligonucleotides (Table I; oSG145 and oSG146 for FattR, oSG147 and oSG148 for FattL, and oSG148 and oSG152 for saf FattL). For each particular substrate, the appropriate oligonucleotides were mixed together to a final concentration of 0.1 μm in 1.5× Sequenase® buffer (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) in a 10-μl volume, placed in a 65 °C heat block, and allowed to cool down to room temperature over approximately 45 min. The 3′ ends of these annealed oligonucleotide pairs were then extended by addition of dithiothreitol to 6.7 mm, dNTP to 0.2 mm, and 7 units of Sequenase® (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) in a final volume of 15 μl and incubation for 30 min at room temperature. Incubation at 15 °C was found to increase the yields for the FattR because of a shorter complementary region. saf (siteaffinity) mutants are missense mutations in the overlap region of att sites. saf-heteroduplexattL and FattL fragments for the Int cleavage assay were assembled by denaturation and reannealing of a mixture of wild type and isotopically end-labeled saf-mutant substrates. The substrates were mixed at an equimolar ratio to a final concentration of 10 nm each in TEN buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). Mixtures were incubated for 3 min at 95 °C, chilled on ice, and placed in a 65 °C heat block that was allowed to cool down to room temperature. The DNA was then dialyzed against 10 mmTris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. This results in three isotopically labeled species, namely the attLsaf-mutant homoduplex and two attLsaf-heteroduplexes. Of these three species only the twoattL saf-heteroduplex species were substrates for Int cleavage; the homoduplex was inert (data not shown).Table IOligonucleotides used in this studyOligonucleotideatt coordinatesSequence (5′ to 3′)aUnderlined bases have been altered from the wild type sequence.oSG46 (attL)−20 to +13GGAATTCCGTTGAAGCCTGCTTTTTTATACTAAGTTGGCoSG49 (attL)+88 to +49GGAATTCAAATAATGATTTATTTTGACTGATAGTGACCTGTTCoSG117 (attR)+24 to −7GGAATTCCCGTTTCGCTCAAGTTAGTATAAAAAAGCoSG122 (attR)−115 to −85GGAATTCATAGTGACTGCATATGTTGTGTTTTACoSG145 (FattR)−115 to −19GGAATTCATAGTGACTGCATATGTTGTGTTTTACAGTATTATGTAGTCTGTTTTTTATGCAAAATCTAATTTAATATATTTTTTTTTTTATCATTTTACGoSG146 (FattR)+24 to −53GGAATTCCCGTTTCGCTCAAGTTAGTATAAAAAAGCTGAACGAGAAACGTAAAATGATATTTTTTTTTATATATTAAATTAGoSG147 (FattL)−20 to +49GGAATTCCGTTGAAGCCTGCTTTTTTATACTAAGTTGGCATTATAAAAAAGCATTTTTTTTTTATTTGTTGCAACoSG148 (FattL)+88 to +11GGAATTCAAATATGATTTATTTTGACTGATAGTGACCTGTTCGTTGCAACAAATTTTTTTTTTATGCTTTTTTATAATGCCoSG152 (FattL saf + 1G)−20 to +49GGAATTCCGTTGAAGCCTGCTTTTTTGTACTAAGTTGGCATTATAAAAAAGCATTTTTTTTTTATTTGTTGCAACoSG153 (attL saf + 1G)−20 to +13GGAATTCCGTTGAAGCCTGCTTTTTTGTACTAAGTTGGCa Underlined bases have been altered from the wild type sequence. Open table in a new tab Isotopically labeled DNA substrates (2 μm) were incubated with 20 units of mung bean endonuclease (Stratagene) in 1× mung bean nuclease buffer (Stratagene) at 30 °C for 30 min. All recombination reactions were performed in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 60 mmKCl, 250 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm spermidine, 0.5 mm EDTA in 1% glycerol. Incubations were performed at 25 °C at the indicated times. DNA substrates were either PCR amplicons or restricted plasmid DNA and present at a final concentration of 2 nm. In cases where PCR amplicons were used exclusively as the recombination substrates, 0.1 μg of carrier DNA (salmon sperm or cleaved pBR322) was added. Pure IntE174K, Xis, and IHF were gifts from Howard Nash. Pure Int was the gift of Life Technologies, Inc. Int and IntE174K were added to 70 nm. Xis and IHF were added to 30 nm and 50 nm,respectively. attL × attL reactions were performed as described above except Xis protein was omitted. The statistical significance of values used to calculate average recombination efficiencies was determined by the Q-test. The Int heteroduplex cleavage assay was assembled in the same manner as the excisive recombination reactions except the attL and FattL saf-heteroduplexes, described above, were used as substrates. Each binding reaction consisted of purified proteins at the same concentrations used in the recombination reactions but were executed in the following buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 60 mm KCl, 50 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol in a final volume of 20 μl. The concentration of each DNA substrate was 5 nm. Reactions were incubated at the designated temperature for 30 min to achieve equilibrium. The entire reaction volume was immediately loaded onto an 8% native polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was performed at 5 V/cm for 3 h at 22 or 4 °C. Gels were dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics). Bands were quantified with ImageQuaNT software. Competition experiments to determine equilibrium dissociation constants were performed as described previously (16Goodman S.D. Velten N.J. Gao G. Robinson S. Segall A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3246-3255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Statistical significance of values used to calculate averages was determined by the Q-test. DNA flexibility swaps were studied in λ excisive recombination, taking advantage of the simple substrate requirements. Unlike integrative recombination, the excisive recombination substrates, attL and attR, do not have strict topology requirements and can be reduced to short PCR amplicons (Fig. 1). In addition to DNA substrates, native excisive recombination absolutely requires the phage-encoded proteins Int and Xis and the host protein IHF. Int must bind to both the P2 and P′1 arm-type sites in addition to the core elements (C, C′, B, and B′) whereas Xis binds to the X1 and X2 sites. IHF binding and deformation are required at the H2 and H′ sites. Previously, we had shown that sequence-directed bends facilitate modest recombination efficiency in place of IHF (1Goodman S.D. Nash H.A. Nature. 1989; 341: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 4Goodman S.D. Nicholson S.C. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1992; 89: 11910-11914Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Initial nucleoprotein intermediates, such as the one speculated at attL (10Segall A.M. Goodman S.D. Nash H.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4536-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 11Kim S. Moitoso de Vargas L. Nunes-Duby S.E. Landy A. Cell. 1990; 63: 773-781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), require IHF to bend DNA for proper Int binding, e.g. Int must simultaneously bind the C′ and the P′1 sites of attL. To construct excisive recombination sites with flexible regions or Fatt sites (flexible attachment sites) we made use of heteroduplex DNA. Regions of heteroduplex are known to be more flexible than native B-form duplex DNA (13Kahn J.D. Yun E. Crothers D.M. Nature. 1994; 368: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The solved cocrystal structure of IHF bound to DNA (8Rice P.A. Yang S. Mizuuchi K. Nash H.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 1295-1306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 9Rice P.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 86-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) was used as a guide to design our heteroduplex replacement substrates. We substituted the nine base pairs between the two positions on the DNA where IHF induces kinks, with nine thymidine residues on each strand (T-bubble, Fig. 2). Thymidines were chosen for their lack of self base pairing and their poor stacking capacity. The same strategy was used for both attL and attR. Fatt sites were first characterized to ensure the existence of the desired T-bubble. Sources of flexure are known to retard the rate of DNA migration during native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (17Bhattacharyya A. Lilley D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6821-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows the wild type versions of attL and attR side by side with their Fatt counterparts. Because each type of att site is otherwise identical, decreased mobility can be ascribed to the T-bubble within the IHF locus of each Fatt site; a denaturing gel of the same substrates shows no mobility differences (data not shown). In addition, Fatt sites were sensitive to mung bean single-stranded endonuclease whereas the wild typeatt sites were resistant to digestion. On FattL, mung bean endonuclease treatment was predicted to yield two duplex DNA fragments of similar length (about 60 bp), because cleavage(s) could, in principle, occur anywhere within the single-stranded region of the T-bubble. The products of cleavage of FattR were predicted to yield two fragments of approximately 60 and 80 bp. As shown in Fig. 3, cutting was restricted to the region of the T-bubble as judged by the size of the DNA cleavage products. We began by testing Fatt sites as substrates in various forms of in vitro recombination. Fatt sites were first used in excisive recombination mediated by a hyperactive mutant of the Int protein that possesses a single missense mutation that changes the glutamate at amino acid position 174 to a lysine (IntE174K). Bruist and co-workers (18Patsey R.L. Bruist M.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) have shown that IntE174K binds with higher affinity to core-type sites, which they conclude facilitates the bivalent binding of the IntE174K promoter in the absence of IHF. This single amino acid change creates an integrase with higher specific activity that can even perform a small amount of IHF-independent recombination (18Patsey R.L. Bruist M.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). If Fatt sites contribute to IHF-independent recombination, we reasoned that this mutant Int protein could produce a synergistic effect with the T-bubble resulting in a significant increase in recombination efficiency over the wild type att sites. As shown in Table II, although IntE174K promotes recombination on both att and Fattsubstrates in the absence of IHF, the recombination of Fattsites was almost 5-fold more efficient than wild type sites. In the presence of IHF, recombination of Fatt sites andatt sites was of similar efficiency. Hence, IHF more than doubled the efficiency of Fatt site recombination but increased recombination between wild type att sites by 12-fold. This demonstrates that the introduced T-bubble is providing a significant benefit to the Fatt sites in favor of recombination competent nucleoprotein complexes.Table IIIn Vitro excisive recombination in the presence and absence of IHFatt site substratesIntegraseIHFPercent recombinationaPercent recombination is defined as the fraction of substrate counts chased into product and is normalized to the percent of attL × attR converted to recombinant product with Int, Xis, and IHF.

Open table in a new tab We repeated these experiments with wild type Int. In the presence of Int and Xis alone we failed to detect any recombinant product with the wild type att sites. Similarly, Fatt sites also failed to produce detectable recombination in the absence of IHF. In contrast, wild type att sites recombined efficiently when IHF was added to reaction mixtures. Surprisingly, the Fattsites also recombined with added IHF, achieving about half the efficiency of the wild type sites. This suggests that IHF still binds to these sites. This was not expected, because we had both altered the sequence of the IHF consensus at some of the most conserved residues and disrupted base pairing within this region. It had been shown previously (10Segall A.M. Goodman S.D. Nash H.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4536-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 11Kim S. Moitoso de Vargas L. Nunes-Duby S.E. Landy A. Cell. 1990; 63: 773-781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) that excisive recombination substrates give very specific mobility shifts during native electrophoresis when bound to particular recombination proteins. Thus we tested Fatt sites for their capacity to generate nucleoprotein complexes with combinations of Int, Xis, and IHF. In the presence of IHF alone, both attL andattR shifted specifically into a single nucleoprotein complex. Moreover, the Fatt sites were also shifted into complexes with similar mobility (Fig. 4,A and B). They differed, however, in that both FattR and FattL failed to form complexes as discrete as the wild type sites. The shifted Fatt complexes also migrated slightly faster than the complexed att sites. Taken together, this may indicate that IHF has a more distributive mode of binding on the Fatt sites. To further assess IHF binding to Fatt sites we quantitatively measured the dissociation constants of IHF to each of the Fatt sites. Dissociation constants were measured by a competition of IHF binding for the 119-bp wild type attL under limiting IHF concentrations (16Goodman S.D. Velten N.J. Gao G. Robinson S. Segall A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3246-3255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nonspecific DNA has 100 to 1000-fold lower affinity for IHF than specific sites (19Yang S-W. Nash H.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6292-6300Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). As shown in Table III, these T-bubble-containing Fatt sites bound IHF within a factor of 2 of their respective wild type site. Hence, part of the IHF site containing some of the most conserved residues can be replaced with a T-bubble with only a small loss of affinity. Our results suggest that the T-bubbles, when embedded in native DNA, are preferred sites for IHF binding. Future experiments will be required to determine whether enhanced flexibility is the feature that allows retention of IHF binding affinity.Table IIIEquilibrium dissociation constants (K d) of IHF bound to att sitesattsiteK d aEach value is the average of three trials, each of which was within 10% of the average.m × 10 −9attL0.8attR0.5FattL2.0FattR0.5a Each value is the average of three trials, each of which was within 10% of the average. Open table in a new tab For Int to yield a functional complex on attL it must bind simultaneously to both the P′1 and C′ sites. In the native system, IHF is required to sufficiently facilitate this structure. Int bound toattL yields two weak complexes. Upon addition of IHF, both the substrate and the faster migrating complex get chased into the slower shifted complex. This latter species has been previously shown to consist of bivalent Int binding to P′1 and C′ and bound IHF (10Segall A.M. Goodman S.D. Nash H.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4536-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar,11Kim S. Moitoso de Vargas L. Nunes-Duby S.E. Landy A. Cell. 1990; 63: 773-781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Henceforth, we will refer to these complete nucleoprotein singleatt species as unimolecular complexes. In contrast, FattL makes, almost exclusively, one complex with Int that comigrates indistinguishably with the att·Int·IHF unimolecular complex. Thus in the absence of IHF, Int and FattL appear to form a productive unimolecular complex. Little change is observed when IHF is added to reactions that contain FattL. Because we have already shown that IHF binds to FattL and because IHF binding is required for wild type recombination, we assume that IHF is still binding but fails to significantly affect the migration of this complex. We interpret this to mean that the primary reduction in electrophoretic migration is the result of DNA distortion by the T-bubble and Int acting in concert and that IHF binding fails to add significantly to both that distortion and the electrophoretic mobility. Hence by EMSA, IHFs role appears to be mimicked by the T-bubble. We repeated this analysis with attR and FattR (Fig. 4 B). In this case, we examined shifted complexes with Int, IHF, Int/Xis, and Int/Xis/IHF. Distinct complexes withattR were observed with each of these protein combinations. We observed that FattR and attR yielded similar but not identical complexes with each protein combination with one important exception, namely the Int·Xis·FattR complex nearly comigrated with the unimolecular complex of attR bound to Int, Xis, and IHF. However, the addition of IHF to the Int·Xis·FattR further enhanced the migration rate of the complex, making the two FattR complexes distinguishable. This differed from Int·FattL complexes that were indistinguishable by EMSA in the presence and absence of IHF. This is the first indication that the T-bubble, at least withinattR, may not functionally replace the IHF-bound complex. Nevertheless, although this IHF-independent complex on FattR is merely similar and not identical to the unimolecular complex on wild type attR, it is still dependent on both Int and Xis for its formation. To determine whether the T-bubble flexibility accounted for this drastic change in IHF-independent EMSA complexes, we repeated the above EMSA experiments but performed all of the steps, including polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, at 4 °C. At lower temperatures, others have shown that base-stacking interactions are stronger for single-stranded regions of DNA, yielding a greater persistence length (14Mills J.B. Vacano E. Hagerman P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Thus as the temperature is reduced we hypothesize that the T-bubble will become stiffer. As shown in Fig. 4, C andD, there are nominal differences in the extent and relative migration of nucleoprotein complexes on the native att sites at this lower temperature; however, the number of major complexes remains the same. The most dramatic change is that the Fattsites are now dependent on IHF for efficient production of the unimolecular complex. Hence, this temperature-induced change, which is consistent with reduced flexibility, provides further evidence that under nonpermissive conditions these Fatt sites can behave like wild type att sites; they are competent for unimolecular complex formation but only in the presence of IHF. To further characterize FattL as a substrate for recombination, we took advantage of the attL × attL recombination pathway. This form of recombination is a naturally occurring secondary pathway that has recently been characterized in vitro (20Segall A.M. Nash H.A. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Via this route, attL solely requires Int to perform recombination; addition of IHF is strongly inhibitory. If Int is able to simultaneously bind the C′ and P′1 sites of attL, thus creating a sharp bend as is required in excisive recombination, thenattL × attL recombination is inhibited. Recombination efficiency is even depressed if only one attL partner is bound to IHF. This allows us to distinguish whether FattL behaves like unbent attL or more like IHF-bound bent attL. Table IVshows that IHF inhibited Int-mediated attL ×attL recombination. In contrast, FattL ×attL recombination was equally efficient with or without added IHF but was only as efficient as attL ×attL recombination in the presence of IHF. Hence, recombination with Fatt sites mimicked the wild typeattL sites in the presence of IHF. This result further confir"
