https://openalex.org/W2020004405,"Activation of Kupffer cells (KCs) by gut-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Toll-Like Receptors 4 (TLR4)-LPS-mediated increase in TNFα production has a central role in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease. Micro-RNA (miR)-125b, miR-146a, and miR-155 can regulate inflammatory responses to LPS. Here we evaluated the involvement of miRs in alcohol-induced macrophage activation. Chronic alcohol treatment in vitro resulted in a time-dependent increase in miR-155 but not miR-125b or miR-146a levels in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Furthermore, alcohol pretreatment augmented LPS-induced miR-155 expression in macrophages. We found a linear correlation between alcohol-induced increase in miR-155 and TNFα induction. In a mouse model of alcoholic liver disease, we found a significant increase in both miR-155 levels and TNFα production in isolated KCs when compared with pair-fed controls. The mechanistic role of miR-155 in TNFα regulation was indicated by decreased TNFα levels in alcohol-treated macrophages after inhibition of miR-155 and by increased TNFα production after miR-155 overexpression, respectively. We found that miR-155 affected TNFα mRNA stability because miR-155 inhibition decreased whereas miR-155 overexpression increased TNFα mRNA half-life. Using the NF-κB inhibitors, MG-132 or Bay11-7082, we demonstrated that NF-κB activation mediated the up-regulation of miR-155 by alcohol in KCs. In conclusion, our novel data demonstrate that chronic alcohol consumption increases miR-155 in macrophages via NF-κB and the increased miR-155 contributes to alcohol-induced elevation in TNFα production via increased mRNA stability.

MicroRNAs (miRs) 3The abbreviations used are: miR, microRNA; ALD, alcoholic liver disease; KC, Kupffer cell; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; qPCR, quantitative PCR. are small non-coding RNA molecules that regulate the expression of target genes involved in a wide range of biological processes (1Baltimore D.

Physiol. 2009; 218: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Innate immune responses and inflammation are fine-tuned by miR-125b, miR-146a, and miR-155. Upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, both miR-146a and miR-155 are up-regulated in monocytes and macrophages (3O'Connell R.M. Taganov K.D. Boldin M.P. Cheng G. Baltimore D. Proc Natl. Acad.

Liu C.G. Calin G.A. Croce C.M. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 5082-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, miR-155 exerts a positive regulation on the release of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) through enhancing its translation (5Tili E. Michaille J.J. Cimino A. Costinean S. Dumitru C.D. Adair B. Fabbri M. Alder H. Liu C.G. Calin G.A. Croce C.M. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 5082-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). In contrast, miR-146a acts as a negative regulator and decreases the release of inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin (IL)-1β or IL-8 (4Perry M.M. Moschos S.A. Williams A.E. Shepherd N.J. Larner-Svensson H.M. Lindsay M.A. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 5689-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), whereas miR-125b acts as a post-transcriptional repressor of TNFα (5Tili E. Michaille J.J. Cimino A. Costinean S. Dumitru C.D. Adair B. Fabbri M. Alder H. Liu C.G. Calin G.A. Croce C.M. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 5082-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). In alcoholic liver disease (ALD), TNFα production by the resident liver macrophages, Kupffer cells (KCs), plays a central role in disease pathogenesis (6Thurman R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G605-G611PubMed Google Scholar). Chronic alcohol exposure in vitro and in vivo increases inflammatory cell responses, particularly to LPS stimulation (7Romics Jr., L. Mandrekar P.

Alcohol-induced sensitization of KCs to gut-derived LPS was shown to contribute to the initiation and progression of ALD (9Nagy L.E. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 882-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). KC-derived TNFα has been identified as an important mediator of steatosis, inflammation, and hepatocyte damage in ALD (10Iimuro Y. Gallucci R.M. Luster M.I. Kono H. Thurman R.G. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 1530-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 11Uesugi T. Froh M. Arteel G.E. Bradford B.U. Wheeler M.D. Gäbele E.

Although the involvement of various signaling pathways such as nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and Erk and mRNA stability has been studied in KCs from ALD (8Mandrekar P. Bala S. Catalano D. Kodys K.

A recent report has described the miR expression profile in a murine model of ALD (14Dolganiuc A. Petrasek J. Kodys K. Catalano D. Mandrekar P. Velayudham A. Szabo G. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 2009; 33: 1704-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), but the functions and physiological activity of specific miRs and their cell-specific role and expression remain to be elucidated. Considering the potential role of miRs in LPS-induced TNFα production and the importance of macrophage inflammatory activation in ALD, we hypothesized that miR-155, miR-146a, and/or miR-125b could play a role in the development of alcoholic liver injury. Here we report for the first time that chronic alcohol induces miR-155 in macrophages via NF-κB and that elevated miR-155 results in increased TNFα production by increasing TNFα mRNA stability. All animals received proper care in agreement with animal protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee of the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Eight-week-old female mice (C57BL/6) were divided into two groups (15–30 mice/group depending on the experiment). The alcohol-fed group received the Lieber-DeCarli diet (Bio-Serv, Frenchtown, NJ) with 5% (v/v) ethanol (32.4% alcohol-derived calories) for 4 weeks; pair-fed control mice received an equal amount of calories as their alcohol-fed counterparts with the alcohol-derived calories substituted with dextrin maltose. Mice were bled by submandibular venipuncture, and serum was separated from whole blood and frozen at −80 °C. For some mice, livers were fixed in formalin and were further paraffin-embedded, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for microscopic analysis. The rest of the mice received anesthesia with ketamine (100 mg/kg), and KCs were isolated as described previously (15Hritz I. Mandrekar P. Velayudham A. Catalano D. Dolganiuc A. Kodys K. Kurt-Jones E. Szabo G. Hepatology. 2008; 48: 1224-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Briefly, the livers were perfused with saline solution for 10 min followed by in vivo digestion with liberase enzyme for 5 min and in vitro digestion for 30 min. The non-hepatocyte content was separated by Percoll gradient and centrifuged for 60 min at 800 × g. The intercushion fraction was washed and adhered to plastic in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal bovine serum. The non-adherent fraction was washed, and the adherent KC population was adjusted to 2 × 106/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Depending on experimental conditions, cells from 5–10 mice were pooled for each experiment given the limited number of KCs available from each animal. For in vitro stimulation, cells were rested overnight, and on the next day, they were stimulated with 25 mm alcohol or 100 ng/ml LPS or both for 6 h; supernatants were collected for TNFα analysis, and total RNA was isolated from cells for miR-155 expression as indicated in Fig. 4, D–E legend. Serum alanine aminotransferase activity was determined using a kinetic method (D-Tek LLC, Bensalem, PA), serum endotoxin levels were measured using the limulus amebocyte lysate assay (Lonza, MD), and serum alcohol levels were determined using an alcohol analyzer (Analox Instruments). RAW 264.7 macrophages were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Dulbecco's modified medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS (HyClone, South Logan, UT) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. For prolonged alcohol exposure, cells exposed to 50 mm alcohol were placed in a C.B.S. Scientific incubation culture chamber with twice the alcohol concentration in the bottom of the chamber to saturate the chamber and maintain a stable alcohol concentration, as described previously (8Mandrekar P. Bala S. Catalano D. Kodys K. Szabo G. J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 1320-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Actinomycin D, MG-132, Bay11-7082, and LPS (Escherichia coli strain 0111:B4) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. RAW 264.7 macrophages were stimulated with E. coli-derived LPS (100 ng/ml), 50 mm alcohol, or the combination of LPS and alcohol at the times indicated in Figs. 1, A and B, 2, A–D, 5, A–E, 6, A–D, and 7, A–C legends.FIGURE 2TNFα production is increased in RAW 264.7 macrophages after LPS and/or alcohol treatment and correlates with miR-155 expression.

B and C, for NF-κB inhibition, RAW 264.7 macrophages were pretreated with Bay11-7082 (0.1 μm) or MG-132 (0.25 μm) or DMSO as a negative control for 30 min and then exposed or not to alcohol (50 mm) for 48 h and further treated or not with LPS for 6 h.

Statistically significant differences are shown (*, p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For inhibition of miR-155, RAW 264.7 macrophages were transfected with anti-miR-155 and anti-miR-negative control 1 (anti-miR-control), and for overexpression, pre-miR-155 and pre-miR-negative control 1 (pre-miR-control) were used to transfect the cells using siPORT NeoFx transfection agent. All these reagents were purchased from Ambion Inc. (Austin, TX). Knockdown efficiency was determined by transfecting the cells with GAPDH siRNA (Ambion), and overexpression efficiency was checked by determining mature miR-155 levels in transfected cells. Transfected cells were treated with and without 50 mm alcohol for 48 h and, where indicated, stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) and treated in the presence or absence of actinomycin D according to experimental requirements before the isolation of RNA (RNeasy kit, Qiagen) or supernatant collection. Amaxa mouse macrophage Nucleofector kit was used to transfect KCs according to manufacturer instructions using the Y-001 program (Lonza). Medium was changed after 4–6 h of transfection, and on the next day, KCs were stimulated with LPS as indicated in Fig. 5F legend. Total RNA was isolated using the mirVanaTM miRNA isolation kit (Ambion). The quality of RNA was routinely checked by measurement of optical density (260/280 and 260/230 ratio) and gel electrophoresis. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses for miR-125b, miR-146a, miR-155, and sno202, used as normalizing control, were performed using TaqMan miRNA assays with reagents, primers, and probes obtained from Ambion. In brief, a stem loop primer was used for reverse transcription (30 min, 16 °C; 30 min, 42 °C; 5 min 85 °C) followed by qPCR employing TaqMan probes and primers in an Eppendorf Realplex Mastercycler (Eppendorf, Westbury, NY). For TNFα and 18 S mRNA expression, RNA was cDNA transcribed with the reverse transcription system (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed using the iCycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories), as described (16Romics Jr., L. Kodys K. Dolganiuc A. Graham L. Velayudham A. Mandrekar P. Szabo G. Hepatology. 2004; 40: 376-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The primer sequences were as follows: 18 S, forward, 5′-GTA ACC CGT TGA ACC CCA TT-3′, and reverse, 5′-CCA TCC AAT CGG TAG TAG CG-3′; TNFα, forward, 5′-CAC CAC CAT CAA GGA CTC AA-3′, and reverse, 5′-AGG CAA CCT GAC CAC TCT CC-3′. Relative expression was calculated using the comparative threshold cycle (Ct) method. To examine NF-κB activation, RAW 264.7 macrophages were exposed to 50 mm alcohol for 48 h and treated or not with 100 ng/ml LPS for 30 min, and nuclear proteins were isolated. KCs from pair-fed or alcohol-fed mice were isolated, rested overnight, and treated or not with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 30 min, and whole cell lysate was isolated given the limited number of cells. Five μg of nuclear protein from RAW 264.7 macrophages or 10 μg of whole cell lysate from KCs were labeled with NF-κB probe as described (17Mandrekar P. Jeliazkova V. Catalano D. Szabo G. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 7686-7693Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To inhibit NF-κB activity, RAW 264.7 macrophages were first treated with Bay11-7082 or MG-132 for 30 min prior to alcohol or LPS stimulation, and then cells were exposed or not to 50 mm alcohol for 48 h as indicated in the Fig. 7, B–C legend. For KCs, cells were rested overnight and then treated with MG-132 for 30 min prior to any in vitro stimulation as described in Fig. 7E legend. Total RNA was extracted with the mirVana miRNA isolation kit and analyzed for miR-155 expression as described earlier. The amount of TNFα in cell-free supernatants was determined by ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences). Data are presented as mean ± S.E., and groups were compared by means of Student's t test or Mann-Whitney U test according to data distribution. Correlation was assessed by means of Spearman's rho test. p < 0.05 was regarded as significant. Prolonged alcohol exposure leads to increased inflammatory cell responses, particularly up-regulation of LPS-induced TNFα production in macrophages and KCs (8Mandrekar P. Bala S. Catalano D. Kodys K. Szabo G. J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 1320-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 18Mandrekar P. Szabo G. J. Hepatol. 2009; 50: 1258-1266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrated that TNFα is regulated by miR-125b (5Tili E. Michaille J.J. Cimino A. Costinean S. Dumitru C.D. Adair B. Fabbri M. Alder H. Liu C.G. Calin G.A. Croce C.M. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 5082-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar), miR-146a (19Taganov K.D. Boldin M.P. Chang K.J. Baltimore D. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. 2006; 103: 12481-12486Crossref PubMed Scopus (3545) Google Scholar), and miR-155 (5Tili E. Michaille J.J. Cimino A. Costinean S. Dumitru C.D. Adair B. Fabbri M. Alder H. Liu C.G. Calin G.A. Croce C.M. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 5082-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that alcohol may affect TNFα production via regulation of miRs. First, we studied RAW 264.7 cells that represent a surrogate model of KCs with respect to alcohol-induced TNFα production (20Szabo G. Mandrekar P. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 2009; 33: 220-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Alcohol treatment at a 50 mm dose, which corresponds to a 0.2 g/dl blood alcohol level found in chronic alcoholics, resulted in significant up-regulation of miR-155 (Fig. 1A). Alcohol increased miR-155 within 6–72 h with the highest induction after prolonged alcohol exposure for 72 h (Fig. 1A). We identified that the alcohol-induced increase was specific to miR-155 as there were no significant changes in miR-146a or miR-125b levels (Fig. 1A). This observation led us to further study miR-155 in alcohol-treated macrophages. The Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) ligand, LPS, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ALD (15Hritz I. Mandrekar P. Velayudham A. Catalano D. Dolganiuc A. Kodys K. Kurt-Jones E. Szabo G. Hepatology. 2008; 48: 1224-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), and it has been proposed that alcohol sensitizes liver macrophages to LPS-induced TNFα production. Although alcohol or LPS treatment alone resulted in a significant increase in miR-155 expression in RAW macrophages, alcohol pretreatment augmented the LPS-induced increase in miR-155 levels (Fig. 1B). These data suggest that miR-155 could be involved in alcohol-induced changes in macrophage activation. Because miR-155 is involved in LPS-induced TNFα regulation (5Tili E. Michaille J.J. Cimino A. Costinean S. Dumitru C.D. Adair B. Fabbri M. Alder H. Liu C.G. Calin G.A. Croce C.M. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 5082-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar) and TNFα is increased in ALD (18Mandrekar P. Szabo G. J. Hepatol. 2009; 50: 1258-1266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), next we confirmed enhanced TNFα production in chronic alcohol-treated macrophages. Prolonged alcohol treatment alone resulted in a time-dependent induction of TNFα in RAW cells (Fig. 2A), and LPS alone also stimulated TNFα production (Fig. 2, B and C). More important, prolonged alcohol pretreatment augmented LPS-induced TNFα protein production (Fig. 2B) and mRNA expression (Fig. 2C). We identified that changes in TNFα production and miR-155 expression were parallel in macrophages. Indeed, a significant positive correlation (R2 = 0.94) existed between TNFα levels and miR-155 expression after alcohol and/or LPS stimulation (Fig. 2D). KCs, the resident macrophages in the liver, are the main source of TNFα in this organ (21Dong Z. Wei H. Sun R. Tian Z. Cell. Mol. Immunol. 2007; 4: 241-252PubMed Google Scholar), and activation of KCs plays a key role in ALD (18Mandrekar P. Szabo G. J. Hepatol. 2009; 50: 1258-1266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next evaluated whether KCs in vivo would have increased miR-155 levels in ALD. Chronic alcohol feeding in mice resulted in increased serum alcohol levels (Fig. 3A) and significant liver damage indicated by increased serum alanine aminotransferase levels when compared with isocaloric diet feeding (Fig. 3B). We found increased serum endotoxin levels in alcohol-fed mice, suggesting a role for LPS (Fig. 3C). Evaluation of liver histology revealed features of ALD including steatosis and inflammatory cell infiltrates in alcohol-fed but not in pair-fed mice (Fig. 3D). Given the features of ALD in vivo, next we tested the hypothesis that miR-155 and TNFα were increased in vivo in KCs in ALD. We determined that KCs isolated from alcohol-fed mice showed increased TNFα production and TNFα mRNA expression when compared with pair-fed controls even without ex vivo stimulation (Fig. 4, A and B). LPS stimulation in KCs from alcohol-fed mice resulted in significantly higher TNFα production at both protein and mRNA levels when compared with KCs from LPS-stimulated pair-fed mice as well as from LPS-naive KCs of alcohol fed mice (Fig. 4, A and B). In addition, we found significantly higher expression of miR-155 in KCs of mice with alcohol feeding when compared with mice with isocaloric control diet (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, the level of miR-125b but not miR-146a was also increased after alcohol feeding in KCs (Fig. 4C). In vitro LPS stimulation amplified alcohol-induced miR-155 expression in KCs isolated from alcohol-fed mice when compared with pair-fed mice (Fig. 4D). In contrast, in vitro alcohol exposure showed no significant effect on miR-155 level in KCs from alcohol-fed mice with or without in vitro LPS stimulation (Fig. 4D). A similar pattern was seen on TNFα level because in vitro alcohol exposure showed no significant effect on TNFα production in KCs from alcohol-fed mice treated or not with LPS in vitro (Fig. 4E). These data suggested that miR-155 up-regulation occurs in vivo in KCs after chronic alcohol intake in the liver. The correlation between increased miR-155 expression and TNFα levels after alcohol treatment prompted us to evaluate whether a causative relationship existed between the alcohol-induced increases in miR-155 and TNFα levels. First, transfection with a miR-155-specific inhibitor reduced alcohol-induced TNFα production (Fig. 5A). More important, inhibition of miR-155 not only reduced LPS-induced TNFα production but also decreased TNFα production in response to alcohol plus LPS (Fig. 5B). These results revealed that up-regulation of TNFα could be prevented by the anti-miR-155 but not by the anti-miR-control in RAW 264.7 macrophages treated with alcohol, LPS, or their combination (Fig. 5, A and B). Next, we sought to evaluate whether miR-155 overexpression could augment LPS-induced TNFα production because this approach could be expected to mimic up-regulation of TNFα in alcohol-treated cells. Overexpression of miR-155 by transfection of pre-miR-155, but not the pre-miR-control, resulted in increased mature miR-155 levels as measured by real-time PCR for mature miR-155 expression (Fig. 5C). Overexpression of miR-155 increased TNFα production in alcohol-treated cells when compared with cells transfected with pre-miR-control (Fig. 5D). Likewise, increased TNFα production after LPS stimulation was found in cells transfected with pre-miR-155 in both alcohol-naive and alcohol-pretreated cells (Fig. 5E), suggesting that miR-155 could augment the effect of LPS on TNFα production. However, we found no significant increase in TNFα production in cells transfected with pre-mir-155 and treated with alcohol plus LPS when compared with LPS alone-stimulated cells. These data suggest that cells may reach a threshold in miR-155 effect on TNFα after LPS stimulation, where the miR-155 effect is saturated and cannot result in further increase in TNFα production (Fig. 5E). Next, we transfected KCs from alcohol-fed mice with anti-miR-155 or anti-miR-control using the Amaxa mouse macrophage Nucleofector kit. Inhibition of miR-155 resulted in decreased TNFα production when compared with cells transfected with anti-miR-control (Fig. 5F). These results suggest that miR-155 regulates TNFα production in KCs in response to alcohol. Previous reports indicated that prolonged alcohol treatment increases LPS-induced TNFα mRNA stability both in RAW 264.7 macrophages and in primary rat KCs (22Nagy L.E. Alcohol. 2004; 33: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, we evaluated the hypothesis that miR-155 could affect TNFα production in part by regulating mRNA stability in alcohol-treated cells. First, we found that alcohol treatment alone increased TNF"

The key to developing efficient knowledge-based potential functions is to design reference states that can appropriately counteract generic interactions. The reference states of many knowledge-based distance-dependent atomic potential functions were derived from non-interacting particles such as ideal gas, however, which ignored the inherent sequence connectivity and entropic elasticity of proteins. Methodology We developed a new pair-wise distance-dependent, atomic statistical potential function (RW), using an ideal random-walk chain as reference state, which was optimized on CASP models and then benchmarked on nine structural decoy sets. Second, we incorporated a new side-chain orientation-dependent energy term into RW (RWplus) and found that the side-chain packing orientation specificity can further improve the decoy recognition ability of the statistical potential. Significance RW and RWplus demonstrate a significantly better ability than the best performing pair-wise distance-dependent atomic potential functions in both native and near-native model selections. It has higher energy-RMSD and energy-TM-score correlations compared with other potentials of the same type in real-life structure assembly decoys. When benchmarked with a comprehensive list of publicly available potentials, RW and RWplus shows comparable performance to the state-of-the-art scoring functions, including those combining terms from multiple resources. These data demonstrate the usefulness of random-walk chain as reference states which correctly account for sequence connectivity and entropic elasticity of proteins. It shows potential usefulness in structure recognition and protein folding simulations. The RW and RWplus potentials, as well as the newly generated I-TASSER decoys, are freely available in http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/RW."

PI3KC3 is composed of the human Vps34 (hVps34) catalytic subunit and two regulatory subunits (p150 and Beclin 1) that are highly conserved from yeast to human. Functional equivalents of Beclin 1/hVps34/p150 in yeast (Atg6/Vps15/Vps34) are essential for autophagy and vacuolar protein sorting (3Kihara A. Noda T. Ishihara N. Ohsumi Y. J.

PI3KC3 forms two mutually exclusive protein subcomplexes that localize to different subcellular organelles and execute distinct functions. One complex is composed of the PI3KC3 core complex (hVps34, p150, and Beclin 1) and Barkor/Atg14(L). Barkor/Atg14(L) is the targeting factor for this complex to nascent autophagosomes (7Sun Q. Fan W. Chen K. Ding X. Chen S. Zhong Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 19211-19216Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The other complex consists of the PI3KC3 core complex and UVRAG. UVRAG positively regulates PI3KC3 activity and autophagy maturation (13Liang C. Feng P. Ku B. Dotan I. Canaani D. Oh B.H. Jung J.U. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 688-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). UVRAG is also required for endocytosis through its interaction with C-VPS/HOPS (13Liang C. Feng P. Ku B. Dotan I. Canaani D.

Here, we demonstrate that Rubicon resides in the UVRAG subcomplex of PI3KC3. Interestingly, we detected no direct interaction between Rubicon and Beclin 1, although it was originally purified in the Beclin 1 complex. Instead, Rubicon physically interacted with UVRAG and hVps34. We have mapped the interaction domain of Rubicon with hVps34 to the RUN domain. The RUN domain is critical for the function of Rubicon in suppressing PI3KC3 lipid kinase activity and autophagy maturation. 293T and U2OS cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. For tetracycline-inducible cells, Tet system approved FBS (Clontech) was used. For immunoprecipitation, cell extracts were incubated with 2 μg of antibody for 4 h and collected with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 4 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were then washed three times and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was performed following standard procedures. The full-length cDNA for human Rubicon (KIAA0226) was generated by PCR on the basis of a partial cDNA clone purchased from Kazusa. Anti-Rubicon antibodies were generated by Abmart, Abgent, and Cell Signaling. Other antibodies used in this study include anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma), anti-HA (Roche Applied Science), anti-Myc (9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-UVRAG (Abgent), and anti-LC3 (Sigma). pcDNA5/FRT/TO (Invitrogen) was modified by introducing the coding sequence of a 3×FLAG tag (between NotI and XhoI) and designated as pcDNA5-FLAG. The Rubicon coding sequence was inserted between BamHI and NotI to generate the reading frame of Rubicon-FLAG, which was used for setting up a stable cell line. pcDNA4/TO (Invitrogen) was modified by introducing the coding sequence of a Myc tag (between NotI and XhoI) and designated as pcDNA4-Myc, into which Rubicon coding sequence were cloned between BamHI and NotI. The procedure was modified from a protocol described previously (13Liang C. Feng P. Ku B. Dotan I. Canaani D. Oh B.H. Jung J.U. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 688-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged hVps34 expressed in cells was immunoprecipitated with M2 beads (Sigma) and extensively washed and preincubated at room temperature for 10 min in 60 μl of reaction containing 2 μg of sonicated phosphatidylinositol. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 μl of ATP mixture (1 μl of 10 mm unlabeled ATP, 1 μl of [γ-32P]ATP, and 3 μl of H2O) and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated, dried using a SpeedVac system, and resuspended in 20 μl of CHCl3/MeOH (1:1). The resultant assay product was separated on dried silica alumina thin liquid chromatography plates with running buffer (9:7:2 CHCl3/MeOH and 4 m NH4OH). Radiolabeled phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) was visualized with a Fuji phosphorimaging scanner. The protocol for recombinant protein production from insect cells is similar to a tandem affinity purification procedure described previously (7Sun Q. Fan W. Chen K. Ding X. Chen S. Zhong Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 19211-19216Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). For the recombinant proteins purified from mammalian cells, whole cell lysates from transfected 293T cells were prepared in tandem affinity purification buffer, and recombinant proteins were collected with M2 beads. After extensive washing, the proteins were eluted with FLAG peptide (0.1 mg/ml) and analyzed. Cells were grown on 6-well plates with coverslips. One day later, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution in PBS at room temperature for 10 min. After permeabilization with PBS buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 20 min, cells were incubated with primary antibodies at 37 °C for 2 h. Upon extensive washing, cells were incubated with different fluorescent dye-conjugated secondary antibodies at 37 °C for 2 h. Slides were examined using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510 META VIS/UV). The shRNA sequences were designed with siRNA Target Finder provided by Ambion and were cloned into BglII and HindIII sites of the pSUPERIOR.puro vector (Oligoengine). The inducible shRNA cell lines were established according to the protocol. The shRNA coding sequence for human Rubicon knockdown is GATCCCCGCAGTGGAACAGAACAACCTTCAAAGAGGTTGTTCTGTTCCACTGCTTTTTA (with the targeted sequence of Rubicon underlined). The inducible knockdown stable cell lines were generated from U2OSTetR cells (7Sun Q. Fan W. Chen K. Ding X. Chen S. Zhong Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 19211-19216Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). To measure the knockdown efficiency, cells were treated with 500 ng/ml doxycycline for 3 days, followed by Western blotting against Rubicon. In complementation assays, RNAi-resistant wild-type Rubicon and mutants (in pcDNA4-GFP-FLAG) were generated by site-specific mutagenesis with primer p1 (catgctgcagtgcctggaagcCgtCgaGcaAaaTaaTccccgcctcctggctcagatc) and p2 (gatctgagccaggaggcggggAttAttTtgCtcGacGgcttccaggcactgcagcatg). These constructs were expressed in Rubicon-depleted cells, and stable cell lines were established by selection against 200 μg/ml Zeocin, 0.5 μg/ml blasticidin, and 1 μg/ml puromycin. For electron microscopy, cells were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) for 2 h, followed by 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) for 2 h. Samples were blocked with 0.5% aqueous uranyl acetate overnight and subjected to low temperature dehydration and infiltration with a graded series of Epon/Araldite, followed by embedding in 100% Epon/Araldite. Thin sections (60 nm) were cut and stained with Reynolds lead citrate using an FEI Tecnai 12 transmission electron microscope.

Rubicon is involved in autophagosome maturation and is likely involved in endosome maturation also (9Matsunaga K. Saitoh T. Tabata K. Omori H. Satoh T. Kurotori N. Maejima I. Shirahama-Noda K.

The stoichiometry of the PI3KC3 complex is complicated by the formation of two mutually exclusive subcomplexes characterized by Barkor/Atg14(L) and UVRAG, respectively (7Sun Q. Fan W. Chen K. Ding X.

Cell. 2008; 19: 5360-5372Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). These two subcomplexes have organelle-specific distributions. The Barkor/Atg14(L) complex is localized to autophagosomes (7Sun Q. Fan W. Chen K. Ding X. Chen S. Zhong Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 19211-19216Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 8Itakura E. Kishi C. Inoue K. Mizushima N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 5360-5372Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar), whereas the UVRAG complex resides predominantly on endosomes (14Liang C. Lee J.S. Inn K.S. Gack M.U. Li Q. Roberts E.A. Vergne I. Deretic V. Feng P. Akazawa C. Jung J.U. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 776-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Although Rubicon has been identified as a component of PI3KC3, it is still not clear which PI3KC3 subcomplex it associates with or whether it forms a unique subcomplex of PI3KC3. To clarify this question, we performed sequential affinity purifications of cellular complexes of Rubicon to elucidate its complex compositions. Rubicon fused to a ZZ tag (two tandem repeats of the PrA IgG binding domain) at the amino terminus and a FLAG tag at the COOH terminus was used as bait (Fig. 1A) to purify its endogenous complex following a procedure described previously in U2OS cells (7Sun Q. Fan W. Chen K. Ding X. Chen S. Zhong Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 19211-19216Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 11Sun Q. Fan W. Zhong Q.

In the Rubicon complex, UVRAG, hVps34, p150, and Beclin 1 (but not Barkor/Atg14(L)) were detected by mass spectrometry (Fig. 1A). Rubicon consistently coprecipitated with hVps34 (Fig. 1B). These data confirmed the presence of Rubicon in the PI3KC3 complex and assigned Rubicon to the subcomplex with UVRAG. Although Rubicon has been shown to interact with the PI3KC3 complex (Fig. 1) (9Matsunaga K. Saitoh T. Tabata K. Omori H. Satoh T. Kurotori N. Maejima I. Shirahama-Noda K. Ichimura T. Isobe T.

Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar), the component through which it binds to PI3KC3 directly has not been characterized. To test which component(s) of PI3KC3 directly interact with Rubicon, we purified recombinant full-length Rubicon, hVps34, UVRAG, Beclin 1, and Barkor/Atg14(L) from baculovirus-infected insect cells or mammalian cells (Fig. 2A) and tested their interactions in an in vitro pulldown assay. All of these recombinant proteins were purified to near homogeneity (Fig. 2A). Both Rubicon and Barkor/Atg14(L) possessed an additional His6 tag. These two proteins were bound to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) column first, followed by incubation of individual PI3KC3 subunits. In this in vitro pulldown assay, Rubicon directly bound to hVps34 and UVRAG (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, there was no direct interaction between Rubicon and Beclin 1, although Rubicon was identified in the Beclin 1 complex (9Matsunaga K. Saitoh T. Tabata K. Omori H. Satoh T. Kurotori N.

Backer J.M. Chait B.T. Heintz N. Yue Z. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). As a control, we found that Barkor/Atg14(L) interacted with Beclin 1, but neither hVps34 nor UVRAG bound directly (Fig. 2B). We mapped the interaction domain of Rubicon for UVRAG and hVps34 binding. A series of deletion mutants were generated, including deletions of the RUN domain, coiled-coil domain (CCD), and FYVE-like domain of full-length Rubicon, as well as three large polypeptide fragments containing the RUN domain, CCD, or FYVE domain (Fig. 3A). The interaction of these mutants with UVRAG was evaluated by an immunoprecipitation assay. Deletion of the RUN domain, CCD, or FYVE-like domain was not enough to abolish the interaction between Rubicon and UVRAG (Fig. 3A, lanes 3–5). Two fragments of Rubicon encompassing amino acids (aa) 300–600 and 600–972, but not the N-terminal fragment 1–300, interacted with UVRAG efficiently (Fig. 3A), which is consistent with a previous report that a large region (aa 393–849) of Rubicon binds to UVRAG (9Matsunaga K. Saitoh T. Tabata K. Omori H. Satoh T. Kurotori N. Maejima I. Shirahama-Noda K. Ichimura T. Isobe T. Akira S. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Because we detected a direct interaction between Rubicon and hVps34, we further investigated the interaction domain of Rubicon with hVps34. The C terminus of Rubicon (aa 300–972) could pull down hVps34 probably through UVRAG (supplemental Fig. S1) (9Matsunaga K. Saitoh T. Tabata K. Omori H. Satoh T. Kurotori N. Maejima I.

Chait B.T. Heintz N. Yue Z. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, the N-terminal region of Rubicon (aa 1–300), which does not interact with UVRAG (9Matsunaga K. Saitoh T. Tabata K. Omori H. Satoh T. Kurotori N. Maejima I. Shirahama-Noda K. Ichimura T. Isobe T. Akira S. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar, 10Zhong Y. Wang Q.J. Li X. Yan Y. Backer J.M. Chait B.T. Heintz N. Yue Z. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar), strongly bound to hVps34 in the co-immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 3B). We further divided the first 300 amino acids into three fragments, including the RUN domain alone (aa 49–180). Although the expression of the RUN domain alone was much lower compared with the other two fragments, the weakly expressed RUN domain bound to hVps34 strongly (Fig. 3B). Binding of the Rubicon RUN domain to hVps34 led to the speculation that the RUN domain might be involved in PI3KC3 regulation. We measured PI3KC3 lipid phosphorylation activity in HEK293T cells expressing wild-type or mutant Rubicon. PI3KC3 phosphorylates the 3′-hydroxyl position of the phosphatidylinositol ring to produce PI(3)P (19Backer J.M. Biochem. J. 2008; 410: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 20Lindmo K. Stenmark H. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The production of PI(3)P by PI3KC3 could be visualized and quantified by fluorescence of the GFP-tagged double FYVE finger of the Hrs protein (15Mari M. Macia E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Cormont M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42501-42508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Because the FYVE probe specifically binds to PI(3)P, we could measure PI3KC3 activity by detecting FYVE fluorescence. PI(3)P production was compromised in Rubicon-expressing cells compared with that in wild-type cells (Fig. 4, A and B), consistent with the inhibitory role of Rubicon in PI3KC3 lipid phosphorylation (10Zhong Y. Wang Q.J. Li X. Yan Y. Backer J.M. Chait B.T. Heintz N. Yue Z. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). We then expressed different fragments of Rubicon to test their effect on PI3KC3 activity. Because the expression of the RUN domain alone was low probably because its expression requires the surrounding regions (Fig. 3B), we expressed the N terminus of Rubicon (aa 1–300) and a large C terminus (aa 180–972) to score their effect on PI(3)P production. The RUN domain-containing fragment was efficient in suppressing PI(3)P production (Fig. 4, A and B), suggesting that Rubicon binding of hVps34 via the RUN domain plays an important role in hVps34 inhibition. As a positive control, PI(3)P production could be efficiently blocked by treatment with the PI3K inhibitor 3-methyladenine (Fig. 4, A and B). In addition, the N terminus of Rubicon also reduced the number of LC3 puncta (supplemental Fig. S2), suggesting that autophagy is also blocked by this fragment. To consolidate the function of the Rubicon RUN domain in PI3KC3 regulation, we measured the lipid phosphorylation activity in an in vitro TLC lipid kinase assay. In this assay, the production of PI(3)P by PI3KC3 could be detected and quantified by radiolabeling the phosphate group of phosphoinositol (19Backer J.M. Biochem. J. 2008; 410: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 20Lindmo K. Stenmark H. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). hVps34 was coexpressed with Barkor/Atg14(L), UVRAG, and Rubicon (Fig. 4C), and its lipid kinase activity was tested accordingly. Both Barkor/Atg14(L) and UVRAG stimulated hVps34 lipid kinase activity (Fig. 4D), supporting their positive roles in hVps34 activation. Coexpression of wild-type Rubicon efficiently blocked UVRAG-mediated hVps34 activity (Fig. 4D, lane 4), indicating that Rubicon can antagonize UVRAG-mediated hVps34 stimulation. A Rubicon mutant with a RUN domain deletion significantly reduced the inhibitory activity of Rubicon in PI(3)P production (∼40%) (Fig. 4D, lane 5). This suggests that the RUN domain of Rubicon contributes to its efficient suppression of PI3KC3 lipid kinase activity. Two recent studies suggested that Rubicon plays a negative role in autophagosome maturation (9Matsunaga K. Saitoh T. Tabata K. Omori H. Satoh T. Kurotori N. Maejima I. Shirahama-Noda K. Ichimura T. Isobe T. Akira S. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar, 10Zhong Y. Wang Q.J. Li X. Yan Y. Backer J.M. Chait B.T. Heintz N. Yue Z. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). We investigated the function of the RUN domain in autophagy regulation. We employed two of the most representative approaches for autophagy regulation, electron microscopy analysis and p62 degradation, to study the structural requirement of the RUN domain in autophagy. In Rubicon-depleted cells, autophagosome maturation was promoted, which led to the accumulation of late autophagic vacuoles, probably due to the inability of lysosomes to digest increased autophagosomes in time. Autophagic vacuoles could be detected under the electron microscope. We performed the electron microscopy analysis with wild-type and Rubicon RNAi-depleted cells. Rubicon was depleted by an shRNA against Rubicon that was inducibly expressed upon the addition of doxycycline in U2OS cells. In Rubicon-depleted cells, we observed abundant mature autophagic vacuoles that were highly enriched in cytosolic content and organelles (Fig. 5A, arrows). Autophagic vacuoles were rarely observed in parental U2OS or shRNA-non-induced cells (Fig. 5A). This observation is consistent with previously published results (9Matsunaga K. Saitoh T. Tabata K. Omori H. Satoh T. Kurotori N. Maejima I. Shirahama-Noda K. Ichimura T. Isobe T. Akira S. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar, 10Zhong Y. Wang Q.J. Li X. Yan Y. Backer J.M. Chait B.T. Heintz N. Yue Z. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Rubicon depletion also led to the accumulation of LC3 cytosolic puncta representing autophagic vacuoles (supplemental Fig. S3). A significant portion of LC3 cytosolic puncta colocalized with Rab5 (an early endosome marker), Rab7 (a late endosome marker), and LAMP1 (a lysosome marker) (supplemental Fig. S1), suggesting that late autophagic vacuoles that fuse with endosomes and lysosomes accumulate in Rubicon-depleted cells. These data confirmed that autophagosome maturation is accelerated when Rubicon is depleted, consistent with previously published results (9Matsunaga K. Saitoh T. Tabata K. Omori H. Satoh T. Kurotori N. Maejima I. Shirahama-Noda K. Ichimura T. Isobe T. Akira S. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar, 10Zhong Y. Wang Q.J. Li X. Yan Y. Backer J.M. Chait B.T. Heintz N. Yue Z. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). We further tested whether ectopically expressed Rubicon could slow autophagosome maturation and therefore relieve the accumulation of mature autophagic vacuoles. We established Rubicon RNAi-depleted cells stably complemented with RNAi-resistant wild-type Rubicon (supplemental Fig. S4). Rubicon RUN domain deletion (aa 1–180) and C-terminal deletion (aa 800–972) mutants were also stably expressed in Rubicon-depleted U2OS cells. Autophagic vacuoles were observed and counted in these cells under an electron microscope. Expression of wild-type Rubicon or the Rubicon mutant with the C-terminal deletion was sufficient to ablate the autophagic vacuole accumulation in Rubicon-depleted cells, but expression of the Rubicon mutant with the RUN domain deletion failed to complement this phenotype (Fig. 5, B and C). Hence, the RUN domain is crucial for the negative function of Rubicon in autophagosome maturation. Degradation of the selective autophagy substrate p62 (21Bjørkøy G. Lamark T. Brech A. Outzen H.

Cell. 2007; 131: 1149-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar) was also examined in Rubicon-depleted and Rubicon-complemented cells. p62 autophagic degradation was accelerated in Rubicon-depleted cells, which was rescued by complementation with wild-type Rubicon and the C-terminal deletion mutant, but not with the RUN domain deletion mutant (Fig. 5D). This result is consistent with the EM results, indicating that the RUN domain of Rubicon is important for the negative regulator role of Rubicon in autophagic degradation. Rubicon is a recently identified PI3KC3 subunit that is required for suppression of autophagosome maturation. In this study, we demonstrated that Rubicon preferentially interacts with UVRAG in the endosomal PI3KC3 subcomplex. In addition to a physical interaction with UVRAG, Rubicon also binds to the catalytic subunit hVps34 via its RUN domain. This binding contributes to its suppression of hVps34 lipid kinase activity. Finally, the RUN domain is critical for Rubicon function in autophagosome maturation and autophagic degradation. Although the RUN domain is proposed to interact with small GTPases, we have revealed here a unique role of the RUN domain in hVps34 interaction and autophagy regulation. Several proteins have been reported to interact with hVps34, including Rab5 (23Stein M.P. Feng Y. Cooper K.L. Welford A.M. Wandinger-Ness A.

Recent biochemical purifications from several laboratories have disclosed six to seven subunits of PI3KC3, including hVps34, p150/Vps15, Beclin 1/Atg6, UVRAG, Barkor/Atg14(L), and Rubicon (7Sun Q.

Autophagy. 2009; 5: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). All of them except Rubicon have a functional counterpart in yeast. Also, similar to the yeast PI3K complex, mammalian PI3KC3 forms two mutually exclusive subcomplexes (7Sun Q. Fan W. Chen K. Ding X. Chen S. Zhong Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 19211-19216Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 9Matsunaga K. Saitoh T. Tabata K. Omori H. Satoh T. Kurotori N. Maejima I. Shirahama-Noda K. Ichimura T. Isobe T. Akira S.

One subcomplex contains the core complex and Barkor/Atg14(L). Because of its localization on early autophagosomes and functionality in autophagosome formation (7Sun Q. Fan W. Chen K. Ding X. Chen S. Zhong Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 19211-19216Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), we refer to this complex as the autophagosomal PI3KC3 complex. The other subcomplex contains the core complex, UVRAG, and Rubicon. This complex is localized mainly to endosomes; we therefore refer to it as the endosomal PI3KC3 complex. Emerging evidence suggests that this subcomplex is involved in both autophagosome and endosome maturation (9Matsunaga K. Saitoh T. Tabata K. Omori H. Satoh T. Kurotori N. Maejima I. Shirahama-Noda K.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 19338-19343Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). However, the architecture of the mammalian PI3KC3 complex is slightly different from its counterpart in yeast. For example, Barkor/Atg14(L) and UVRAG interact with hVps34 via Beclin 1 in mammalian cells (7Sun Q. Fan W. Chen K. Ding X. Chen S. Zhong Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 19211-19216Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 13Liang C. Feng P. Ku B. Dotan I. Canaani D. Oh B.H. Jung J.U. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 688-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar), whereas two regulatory proteins, Atg14 (Barkor-like) and Vps38 (UVRAG-like) mediate the interaction between hVps34 and Beclin 1/Atg6 (3Kihara A. Noda T. Ishihara N. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Furthermore, because Rubicon and its autophagy-inhibiting functions through the PI3KC3 complex have no homologous function in yeast, the autophagy inhibition activity of Rubicon could be unique to multicell organisms. However, the mechanism of PI3KC3 and autophagy inhibition by Rubicon is largely unknown. Interestingly, we found no direct interaction between Beclin 1 and Rubicon, although Rubicon was named as a Beclin 1-interacting protein (9Matsunaga K. Saitoh T. Tabata K. Omori H. Satoh T. Kurotori N. Maejima I. Shirahama-Noda K. Ichimura T. Isobe T. Akira S. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar, 10Zhong Y. Wang Q.J. Li X. Yan Y. Backer J.M. Chait B.T. Heintz N. Yue Z. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Instead, Rubicon interacts with UVRAG and hVps34 directly (Fig. 2). The physical interaction between Rubicon and hVps34 might help to explain its inhibitory effect on PI3K activity. The data presented in this study support a critical role of the RUN domain in the inhibitory function of Rubicon. However, the interaction between the central region of Rubicon and UVRAG (9Matsunaga K. Saitoh T. Tabata K. Omori H. Satoh T. Kurotori N. Maejima I. Shirahama-Noda K. Ichimura T. Isobe T. Akira S.

Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar) might also contribute to the negative regulation of Rubicon, which needs further investigation. We also cannot exclude the possibility that Rubicon could interact with hVps34 through region(s) other than the RUN domain. Nevertheless, our data demonstrate that the RUN domain is not only sufficient for hVps34 binding but also critical for regulating PI3KC3 lipid kinase activity and autophagy. The RUN domain was originally found in a group of proteins that interact with small GTPases (15Mari M. Macia E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Cormont M. J. Biol.

It was therefore proposed as a binding surface for small GTPases. Our results indicate that the RUN domain can also bind hVps34. This may provide a possible link between many RUN domain-containing proteins and PI3K regulation, the detailed mechanism of which is still largely unknown and needs to be further explored through more structural and functional analyses. In this study, we have identified a previously unknown function of the RUN domain of Rubicon in PI3KC3 and autophagy regulation. Dissecting the molecular mechanism of this molecule will provide exciting insight into the mechanism of the autophagic pathways. Such information should be critical for the development of novel therapeutic tools for multiple human pathological conditions with dysfunctions of autophagy.

Methods and Findings A population-based sample of 5603 women from Medchal Mandal in Andhra Pradesh, India were invited to participate in a study comparing Pap cytology, VIA, and HPV DNA screening for the detection of CIN3+. Participation in primary screening and all subsequent follow-up visits was rigorously tracked. A 20% random sample of all women screened, in addition to all women with a positive screening test result underwent colposcopy with directed biopsy for final diagnosis. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were adjusted for verification bias. HPV testing had a higher sensitivity (100%) and specificity (90.6%) compared to Pap cytology (sensitivity = 78.2%; specificity = 86.0%) and VIA (sensitivity = 31.6%; specificity = 87.5%). Since 58% of the sample refused involvement and another 28% refused colposcopy or biopsy, we estimated that potentially 87.6% of the total underlying cases of CIN3 and cancer may have been missed due to program failures. Conclusions We conclude that despite our use of available resources, infrastructure, and guidelines for cervical cancer screening implementation in resource limited areas, community participation and non-compliance remain the major obstacles to successful reduction in cervical cancer mortality in this Indian population. HPV DNA testing was both more sensitive and specific than Pap cytology and VIA. The use of a less invasive and more user-friendly primary screening strategy (such as self-collected swabs for HPV DNA testing) may be required to achieve the coverage necessary for effective reduction in cervical cancer mortality."
https://openalex.org/W1968547522,"Heme enzymes are ubiquitous in biology and catalyze a vast array of biological redox processes. The formation of high valent ferryl intermediates of the heme iron (known as Compounds I and Compound II) is implicated for a number of catalytic heme enzymes, but these species are formed only transiently and thus have proved somewhat elusive. In consequence, there has been conflicting evidence as to the nature of these ferryl intermediates in a number of different heme enzymes, in particular the precise nature of the bond between the heme iron and the bound oxygen atom. In this work, we present high resolution crystal structures of both Compound I and Compound II intermediates in two different heme peroxidase enzymes, cytochrome c peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase, allowing direct and accurate comparison of the bonding interactions in the different intermediates. A consistent picture emerges across all structures, showing lengthening of the ferryl oxygen bond (and presumed protonation) on reduction of Compound I to Compound II. These data clarify long standing inconsistencies on the nature of the ferryl heme species in these intermediates."
https://openalex.org/W2062685624,"We studied the properties of the permeability transition pore (PTP) in rat liver mitochondria and in mitoplasts retaining inner membrane ultrastructure and energy-linked functions. Like mitochondria, mitoplasts readily underwent a permeability transition following Ca(2+) uptake in a process that maintained sensitivity to cyclosporin A. On the other hand, major differences between mitochondria and mitoplasts emerged in PTP regulation by ligands of the outer membrane translocator protein of 18 kDa, TSPO, formerly known as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor. Indeed, (i) in mitoplasts, the PTP could not be activated by photo-oxidation after treatment with dicarboxylic porphyrins endowed with protoporphyrin IX configuration, which bind TSPO in intact mitochondria; and (ii) mitoplasts became resistant to the PTP-inducing effects of N,N-dihexyl-2-(4-fluorophenyl)indole-3-acetamide and of other selective ligands of TSPO. Thus, the permeability transition is an inner membrane event that is regulated by the outer membrane through specific interactions with TSPO."
https://openalex.org/W2137849467,"Background During tumor angiogenesis, endothelial cells (ECs) are engaged in a number of energy consuming biological processes, such as proliferation, migration, and capillary formation. Since glucose uptake and metabolism are increased to meet this energy need, the effects of the glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) on in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis were investigated. Methodology/Principal Findings In cell culture, 2-DG inhibited EC growth, induced cytotoxicity, blocked migration, and inhibited actively forming but not established endothelial capillaries. Surprisingly, 2-DG was a better inhibitor of these EC properties than two more efficacious glycolytic inhibitors, 2-fluorodeoxy-D-glucose and oxamate. As an alternative to a glycolytic inhibitory mechanism, we considered 2-DG's ability to interfere with endothelial N-linked glycosylation. 2-DG's effects were reversed by mannose, an N-linked glycosylation precursor, and at relevant concentrations 2-DG also inhibited synthesis of the lipid linked oligosaccharide (LLO) N-glycosylation donor in a mannose-reversible manner. Inhibition of LLO synthesis activated the unfolded protein response (UPR), which resulted in induction of GADD153/CHOP and EC apoptosis (TUNEL assay). Thus, 2-DG's effects on ECs appeared primarily due to inhibition of LLOs synthesis, not glycolysis. 2-DG was then evaluated in two mouse models, inhibiting angiogenesis in both the matrigel plug assay and the LHBETATAG transgenic retinoblastoma model. Conclusions/Significance In conclusion, 2-DG inhibits endothelial cell angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo, at concentrations below those affecting tumor cells directly, most likely by interfering with N-linked glycosylation rather than glycolysis. Our data underscore the importance of glucose metabolism on neovascularization, and demonstrate a novel approach for anti-angiogenic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2038804324,"Keratin polypeptide 8 (K8) associates noncovalently with its partners K18 and/or K19 to form the intermediate filament cytoskeleton of hepatocytes and other simple-type epithelial cells. Human K8, K18, and K19 variants predispose to liver disease, whereas site-specific keratin phosphorylation confers hepatoprotection. Because stress-induced protein phosphorylation regulates sumoylation, we hypothesized that keratins are sumoylated in an injury-dependent manner and that keratin sumoylation is an important regulatory modification. We demonstrate that K8/K18/K19, epidermal keratins, and vimentin are sumoylated in vitro. Upon transfection, K8, K18, and K19 are modified by poly-SUMO-2/3 chains on Lys-285/Lys-364 (K8), Lys-207/Lys-372 (K18), and Lys-208 (K19). Sumoylation affects filament organization and stimulus-induced keratin solubility and is partially inhibited upon mutation of one of three known K8 phosphorylation sites. Extensive sumoylation occurs in cells transfected with individual K8, K18, or K19 but is limited upon heterodimerization (K8/K18 or K8/K19) in the absence of stress. In contrast, keratin sumoylation is significantly augmented in cells and tissues during apoptosis, oxidative stress, and phosphatase inhibition. Poly-SUMO-2/3 conjugates are present in chronically injured but not normal, human, and mouse livers along with polyubiquitinated and large insoluble keratin-containing complexes. Notably, common human K8 liver disease-associated variants trigger keratin hypersumoylation with consequent diminished solubility. In contrast, modest sumoylation of wild type K8 promotes solubility. Hence, conformational changes induced by keratin natural mutations and extensive tissue injury result in K8/K18/K19 hypersumoylation, which retains keratins in an insoluble compartment, thereby limiting their cytoprotective function.

Upon transfection, K8, K18, and K19 are modified by poly-SUMO-2/3 chains on Lys-285/Lys-364 (K8), Lys-207/Lys-372 (K18), and Lys-208 (K19). Sumoylation affects filament organization and stimulus-induced keratin solubility and is partially inhibited upon mutation of one of three known K8 phosphorylation sites. Extensive sumoylation occurs in cells transfected with individual K8, K18, or K19 but is limited upon heterodimerization (K8/K18 or K8/K19) in the absence of stress. In contrast, keratin sumoylation is significantly augmented in cells and tissues during apoptosis, oxidative stress, and phosphatase inhibition. Poly-SUMO-2/3 conjugates are present in chronically injured but not normal, human, and mouse livers along with polyubiquitinated and large insoluble keratin-containing complexes. Notably, common human K8 liver disease-associated variants trigger keratin hypersumoylation with consequent diminished solubility. In contrast, modest sumoylation of wild type K8 promotes solubility. Hence, conformational changes induced by keratin natural mutations and extensive tissue injury result in K8/K18/K19 hypersumoylation, which retains keratins in an insoluble compartment, thereby limiting their cytoprotective function."
https://openalex.org/W2089833244,"Sall1 is a multi-zinc finger transcription factor that regulates kidney organogenesis. It is considered to be a transcriptional repressor, preferentially localized on heterochromatin. Mutations or deletions of the human <i>SALL1</i> gene are associated with the Townes-Brocks syndrome. Despite its high expression, no function was yet assigned for Sall1 in embryonic stem (ES) cells. In the present study, we show that Sall1 is expressed in a differentiation-dependent manner and physically interacts with Nanog and Sox2, two components of the core pluripotency network. Genome-wide mapping of Sall1-binding loci has identified 591 genes, 80% of which are also targeted by Nanog. A large proportion of these genes are related to self-renewal and differentiation. Sall1 positively regulates and synergizes with Nanog for gene transcriptional regulation. In addition, our data show that Sall1 suppresses the ectodermal and mesodermal differentiation. Specifically, the induction of the gastrulation markers T brachyury, Goosecoid, and Dkk1 and the neuroectodermal markers Otx2 and Hand1 was inhibited by Sall1 overexpression during embryoid body differentiation. These data demonstrate a novel role for Sall1 as a member of the transcriptional network that regulates stem cell pluripotency."
https://openalex.org/W1978939437,"Although the trimming of α1,2-mannose residues from precursor N-linked oligosaccharides is an essential step in the delivery of misfolded glycoproteins to endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD), the exact role of this trimming is unclear. EDEM1 was initially suggested to bind N-glycans after mannose trimming, a role presently ascribed to the lectins OS9 and XTP3-B, because of their in vitro affinities for trimmed oligosaccharides. We have shown before that ER mannosidase I (ERManI) is required for the trimming and concentrates together with the ERAD substrate and ERAD machinery in the pericentriolar ER-derived quality control compartment (ERQC). Inhibition of mannose trimming prevents substrate accumulation in the ERQC. Here, we show that the mannosidase inhibitor kifunensine or ERManI knockdown do not affect binding of an ERAD substrate glycoprotein to EDEM1. In contrast, substrate association with XTP3-B and with the E3 ubiquitin ligases HRD1 and SCFFbs2 was inhibited. Consistently, whereas the ERAD substrate partially colocalized upon proteasomal inhibition with EDEM1, HRD1, and Fbs2 at the ERQC, colocalization was repressed by mannosidase inhibition in the case of the E3 ligases but not for EDEM1. Interestingly, association and colocalization of the substrate with Derlin-1 was independent of mannose trimming. The HRD1 adaptor protein SEL1L had been suggested to play a role in N-glycan-dependent substrate delivery to OS9 and XTP3-B. However, substrate association with XTP3-B was still dependent on mannose trimming upon SEL1L knockdown. Our results suggest that mannose trimming enables delivery of a substrate glycoprotein from EDEM1 to late ERAD steps through association with XTP3-B.

Calnexin and calreticulin will bind to the sugar chains if they possess only one terminal glucose residue that remains from the original precursor or after its readdition by the folding sensor UDP-Glc: glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (4D'Alessio C.

Biol. 2010; 21: 500-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). If proper folding cannot be achieved in a certain time frame, the glycoprotein molecules are targeted to ERAD by retrotranslocation to the cytosol and degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The decision to send a glycoprotein molecule to ERAD involves differential processing of its sugar chains (6Frenkel Z. Gregory W. Kornfeld S. Lederkremer G.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34119-34124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 7Lederkremer G.Z. Glickman M.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Three or four mannose residues are excised from misfolded molecules and only one or two from folded molecules that exit to the Golgi. Although it is well established that this trimming of mannose residues is essential for delivery to ERAD (1Aebi M. Bernasconi R. Clerc S. Molinari M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2010; 35: 74-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 2Hebert D.N. Bernasconi R. Molinari M. Semin. Cell Dev.

Biol. 2009; 19: 515-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), it is still unclear what events are regulated by this process. Recent studies on affinity of early secretory pathway lectins in vitro show that OS9 binds only after the trimming and cannot bind untrimmed Man9GlcNAc2 or Man8BGlcNAc2 (8Hosokawa N. Kamiya Y.

Glycobiology. 2010; 20: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Conversely, lectins that support trafficking from the ER to the Golgi (ERGIC53, VIP36, VIPL) cannot bind the trimmed Man5GlcNAc2 and associate with higher affinity with untrimmed molecules (12Kamiya Y. Kamiya D. Yamamoto K. Nyfeler B. Hauri H.P. Kato K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1857-1861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This suggests a model whereby extensive excision of mannose residues has a triple function: removal of the glycoprotein from the calnexin cycle (because the acceptor mannose for reglucosylation is lost), prevention of its binding to ER-Golgi lectins, and delivery to OS9 or XTP3-B. OS9 and XTP3-B would thus be the lectin-acceptors for the trimmed glycoprotein ERAD substrates, although evidence for this exists in vivo only for OS9 (8Hosokawa N. Kamiya Y. Kamiya D. Kato K. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 17061-17068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This role was initially proposed for the ERAD-enhancing factor EDEM1 (ER degradation enhancing mannose-like protein 1) (13Hosokawa N. Wada I. Hasegawa K. Yorihuzi T. Tremblay L.O. Herscovics A. Nagata K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 14Jakob C.A. Bodmer D. Spirig U. Battig P. Marcil A. Dignard D. Bergeron J.J. Thomas D.Y. Aebi M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), a protein implicated in accepting misfolded substrates released from the calnexin cycle. EDEM1 has a mannosidase-like domain, but a mannosidase activity has not been found yet in vitro, although it accelerates directly or indirectly trimming of mannose residues in vivo (15Hosokawa N.

FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 3658-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that trimming of mannose residues is an obligatory step for ERAD substrate accumulation in the ER quality control compartment (ERQC) (6Frenkel Z. Gregory W. Kornfeld S.

Glycobiology. 2010; 20: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) that are recruited to the ERQC (19Kondratyev M. Avezov E. Shenkman M. Groisman B. Lederkremer G.Z. Exp. Cell Res. 2007; 313: 3395-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and the affinity of these lectins for trimmed sugar chains would suggest that the substrate glycoprotein becomes trapped in the ERQC after trimming. Here, we elucidate steps that require mannose trimming in the targeting of a glycoprotein substrate to ERAD in mammalian cells in vivo. We analyzed the effect of mannose trimming inhibition on association of EDEM1 and downstream ERAD factors with the substrate and the effect on the subcellular localization of these factors in relation to the substrate. We used as a model an established ERAD substrate, the uncleaved precursor of asialoglycoprotein receptor H2a (20Shenkman M. Ayalon M. Lederkremer G.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 11363-11368Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 21Frenkel Z. Shenkman M. Kondratyev M. Lederkremer G.Z. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2133-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The precursor of H2a is a type 2 membrane glycoprotein that is expressed endogenously only in hepatocytes and is cleaved next to the transmembrane domain, and its ectodomain is secreted (22Tolchinsky S. Yuk M.H. Ayalon M. Lodish H.F. Lederkremer G.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14496-14503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). When expressed in other cell types, most H2a precursor molecules remain uncleaved and are targeted to ERAD (18Kamhi-Nesher S. Shenkman M. Tolchinsky S. Fromm S.V. Ehrlich R. Lederkremer G.Z. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1711-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 20Shenkman M. Ayalon M. Lederkremer G.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 11363-11368Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that association of EDEM1 with the substrate does not require ERManI and the mannose-trimming event. In contrast, this trimming is essential for association with XTP3-B, substrate sequestration in the ERQC, and delivery to the E3 ubiquitin ligases HRD1 and SCFFbs2. Rainbow 14C-labeled methylated protein standards were obtained from GE Healthcare. Promix cell labeling mix ([35S]Met plus [35S]Cys) >1000 Ci/mmol was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.

Reverse transcription was performed with a VersoTM cDNA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), using a mixture of random hexamer and anchored oligo(dT) primers. An aliquot (10%) of the RT product was used for PCR with the following primers: CCTTCAGTGAGTGGTTTGG and GTGGTCCATCTTGGCACTG for ERManI, CAATGAAGGAGAAGGAGAC and CAATGTGTCCCTCTGTTGTG for EDEM1, AAAGCCCTGGAGAGAGTG and TTCCACTGTTCATTCCTG for SEL1L, and CTTTTAACTCTGGTAAAGTGG and TTTTGGCTCCCCCCTGCAAAT for GAPDH. Rabbit polyclonal anti-H2 carboxyl-terminal and anti-H2 amino-terminal antibodies were the ones used in earlier studies (22Tolchinsky S. Yuk M.H. Ayalon M. Lodish H.F. Lederkremer G.Z. J. Biol.

Mouse monoclonal antibodies were as follows; anti-FLAG (M2) was from Sigma, anti-Myc from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA), anti-HA from Sigma or Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and an anti-S tag from Novagen (Gibbstown, NJ). Goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to Cy2, goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to FITC, and goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG conjugated to HRP were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to agarose was from Sigma. HEK 293 cells were grown in DMEM plus 10% FCS and NIH 3T3 cells in DMEM plus 10% new born calf serum. An HEK 293 stable cell line expressing H2aSBP was described previously (23Groisman B. Avezov E. Lederkremer G.Z. Isr. J. Chem. 2006; 46: 189-196Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). All cells were grown at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Transient transfection of NIH 3T3 cells was performed using FuGENE 6TM reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the kit protocol. Transient transfection of HEK 293 cells was done according to the calcium phosphate method. The experiments were performed 24–48 h after the transfection. Subconfluent (90%) cell monolayers in 60-mm dishes were labeled with [35S]Cys, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with anti-H2 antibodies as described previously (20Shenkman M. Ayalon M. Lederkremer G.Z.

Kif (100 μm) was added to cells 2 h before the labeling, and it was also present during starvation, labeling, and chase periods. Reducing SDS-PAGE was performed on 10% or 12% Laemmli gels. The gels were analyzed by fluorography using 20% 2,5-diphenyloxazole and were exposed to Biomax MS film using a BioMax TranScreen LE from Kodak (Vancouver, BC). Quantitation was performed in a Fujifilm FLA 5100 phosphorimaging device (Japan). Cell lysis and immunoprecipitation of H2a and related constructs was done as described previously (20Shenkman M. Ayalon M. Lederkremer G.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 11363-11368Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), except that an anti-H2a N-terminal antibody was used. Cell lysis was performed in the presence of 2 mm PMSF and 5 μg/ml aprotinin. For precipitation of SBP cell lysis was done in 1%Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl for 30 min on ice, and debris and nuclei were pelleted in a microfuge for 30 min at 4 °C. The samples were immunoprecipitated with streptavidin-agarose-conjugated beads or an appropriate antisera and protein A-agarose. For immunoprecipitation with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody, whole goat anti-mouse IgG antibody immobilized on agarose beads was used. After overnight precipitation, the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, followed by elution of the bound proteins by boiling with sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol at 100 °C for 5 min. Immunoblotting and detection by ECL were done as described previously (18Kamhi-Nesher S. Shenkman M. Tolchinsky S. Fromm S.V. Ehrlich R. Lederkremer G.Z. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1711-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), except for exposure and quantitation in a Bio-Rad ChemiDocXRS Imaging System. The procedures employed were as described previously (17Avezov E. Frenkel Z. Ehrlich M. Herscovics A. Lederkremer G.Z. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 18Kamhi-Nesher S. Shenkman M. Tolchinsky S. Fromm S.V. Ehrlich R. Lederkremer G.Z. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1711-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Whereas for biochemical experiments HEK 293 cells were used for high transfection efficiency, the imaging experiments were done using NIH 3T3 cells for optimal subcellular structure resolution. For treatments with Lac (25 μm) or Kif (100 μm) cells on coverslips were incubated with medium containing the drug at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator for 3–5 h. Confocal microscopy was done on a Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM 510; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) as described previously (17Avezov E. Frenkel Z. Ehrlich M. Herscovics A. Lederkremer G.Z. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Colocalization analysis (Pearson) was done using ImageJ software. We had previously shown that degradation of asialoglycoprotein receptor H2a is strongly dependent on trimming of mannose residues (17Avezov E. Frenkel Z. Ehrlich M. Herscovics A. Lederkremer G.Z. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 26Ayalon-Soffer M. Shenkman M. Lederkremer G.Z. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3309-3318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This can be seen in Fig. 1A, that shows the result of a pulse-chase experiment, where the H2a precursor was much stabilized in the presence of the α1,2-mannosidase inhibitor Kif, leading also to an increased amount of the cleaved H2a ectodomain fragment. When mannose trimming is blocked, there is a typical shift to a slower migration of the ERAD substrate (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4 compared with lanes 1 and 2). We tested the requirement of EDEM1 for ERAD of H2a. Anti-EDEM1 shRNA strongly inhibited the degradation of H2a, although it did not lead to a significant change in the migration (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 3 and 4 with 1 and 2 and the graph in Fig. 1D). In contrast, overexpression of EDEM1 accelerated the degradation (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 3 and 4 with 1 and 2, Fig. 1D) and also caused a 30% reduction in the level of the pulse-labeled H2a (Fig. 1C, compare lane 1 with lane 3), probably by reducing the initial lag in degradation (22Tolchinsky S. Yuk M.H. Ayalon M. Lodish H.F. Lederkremer G.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14496-14503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Fig. 1E shows the efficiency of the EDEM1 knockdown. EDEM1 coimmunoprecipitated with H2a to a similar extent in the presence or absence of a proteasomal inhibitor (Lac) and also when inhibiting mannose trimming with Kif (Fig. 2A), similar to what had been observed with another ERAD substrate, Null Hong Kong mutant of α1-antitrypsin (27Cormier J.H. Tamura T. Sunryd J.C. Hebert D.N. Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 627-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We looked at the subcellular localization of EDEM1, which appeared in a somewhat punctate ER pattern (see Ref. 28Zuber C. Cormier J.H. Guhl B. Santimaria R. Hebert D.N. Roth J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 4407-4412Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar for a detailed analysis of EDEM1 localization), colocalizing partially with H2a linked to monomeric red fluorescent protein (H2aRFP) (Fig. 2B, upper panels). H2aRFP is an ERAD substrate (19Kondratyev M. Avezov E. Shenkman M. Groisman B. Lederkremer G.Z. Exp. Cell Res. 2007; 313: 3395-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and similar to H2a, Kif inhibits its degradation and trimming of its mannose residues (Fig. 2D). Upon proteasomal inhibition, the ERAD substrate accumulates in the ERQC and colocalized to a much higher extent (2-fold) with EDEM1 (Fig. 2C), which partially redistributed to this juxtanuclear region (Fig. 2B, middle panels). Inhibition of mannose trimming causes the ERAD substrate to accumulate in a punctate pattern (6Frenkel Z. Gregory W. Kornfeld S. Lederkremer G.Z. J. Biol.

Cell. 2008; 19: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and also in this case, there was more colocalization with EDEM1 (Fig. 2B, lower panels, and 2C). The behavior of EDEM1 is different from that of ERManI, which is concentrated in the ERQC in all conditions, in untreated cells, after proteasome inhibition and after inhibition of mannose trimming (17Avezov E. Frenkel Z. Ehrlich M. Herscovics A. Lederkremer G.Z. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Because Kif could theoretically compete with substrate binding to EDEM1, we analyzed the effect of inhibition of mannose trimming by knockdown of ERManI, an enzyme that we had shown is required for the extensive mannose trimming and targeting to ERAD (17Avezov E. Frenkel Z. Ehrlich M. Herscovics A. Lederkremer G.Z. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Knockdown of ERManI causes a smaller extent of inhibition of mannose trimming compared with Kif (compare band shifts in Figs. 2A and 3A, middle panels), but led to increased coimmunoprecipitation of EDEM1 with H2a (Fig. 3), indicating that association of EDEM1 with the substrate does not depend on the activity or presence of ERManI, the presence of which may actually compete for binding to the substrate. Altogether, the results indicate that EDEM1 is involved in ERAD of H2a and that association and colocalization of EDEM1 and the ERAD substrate do not require mannose trimming or ERManI. The affinity of the mammalian lectin OS9 and of yeast Yos9 for several oligosaccharides was determined recently in vitro and showed a clear preference for trimmed oligosaccharides and no binding to Man9GlcNAc2 or Man8BGlcNAc2 (missing the middle branch terminal mannose) (8Hosokawa N.

The same is true for XTP3-B, which has a similar function as OS9 (11Yamaguchi D. Hu D. Matsumoto N. Yamamoto K. Glycobiology. 2010; 20: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, the prediction would be that inhibition of α1,2-mannosidases would inhibit ERAD substrate binding to the lectins. Although for some substrates OS9 and XTP3-B seem to be interchangeable (29Bernasconi R. Galli C. Calanca V. Nakajima T. Molinari M. J. Cell Biol. 2010; 188: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), other substrates have a preference in associating with one of the lectins (30Christianson J.C. Shaler T.A. Tyler R.E. Kopito R.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 272-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Coimmunoprecipitation of H2a with OS9 yielded a very low signal (data not shown), but it showed significant binding to XTP3-B (Fig. 4A, lane 1). Cell treatment with Kif or knockdown of ERManI significantly inhibited the coimmunoprecipitation to 25 and 35% of the control, respectively, even though the total amount of ERAD substrate present increased as its degradation was inhibited (Fig. 4A, lanes 2 and 3 compared with lane 1). Combined knockdown of ERManI and Kif treatment reduced the association even further, to 10% of the control (Fig. 4A, graph). It had been reported that the sugar chains of SEL1L, the HRD1 E3 ligase adaptor (31Mueller B. Lilley B.N. Ploegh H.L. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), are involved in its interactions with EDEM1 (27Cormier J.H. Tamura T. Sunryd J.C. Hebert D.N. Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 627-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and also with OS9 and XTP3-B (30Christianson J.C. Shaler T.A. Tyler R.E. Kopito R.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 272-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). These findings could suggest an indirect sugar dependence, with a protein-protein interaction of the substrate with SEL1L and sugar-protein interactions of SEL1L with the lectins. In this case, knockdown of SEL1L should abrogate the mannose-trimming dependence of the putative indirect interaction of the ERAD substrate with XTP3-B. Nevertheless, after efficient knockdown of SEL1L (Fig. 4C), the coimmunoprecipitation of H2a with XTP3-B was still inhibited by cell treatment with Kif, to an extent similar to that in the control cells (compare Fig. 4, A and B, lanes 1 and 2). We analyzed whether delivery of the substrate to factors downstream of XTP3-B in the ERAD pathway is dependent on the mannose-trimming step. We had shown that two E3 ubiquitin ligases participate in the degradation of H2a (23Groisman B. Avezov E. Lederkremer G.Z. Isr. J. Chem. 2006; 46: 189-196Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar), HRD1 (a transmembrane protein exposing a RING H2 finger domain to the cytosol (32Kikkert M. Doolman R. Dai M. Avner R.

Chem. 2003; 278: 43877-43884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This can be seen in Fig. 5, which shows a pulse-chase analysis of H2a and the inhibition of the degradation by overexpression of dominant negative mutants of HRD1 (RING finger mutant) and Fbs2 (F box mutant). In this case, we used SBP-tagged uncleavable H2a, which behaves similarly to the wild type protein, except that it does not yield a cleaved fragment (23Groisman B. Avezov E. Lederkremer G.Z. Isr. J. Chem. 2006; 46: 189-196Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We had seen that upon proteasomal inhibition, a large portion of HRD1 colocalizes with H2aRFP at the ERQC (19Kondratyev M. Avezov E. Shenkman M. Groisman B. Lederkremer G.Z. Exp. Cell Res. 2007; 313: 3395-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This can be seen in Fig. 6A (middle panels). Treatment with Kif redistributed both H2aRFP and HRD1 to a punctate pattern but with much decreased colocalization, similar to that in untreated cells (Fig. 6A, lower panels, and B). Kif also caused a much lower degree of coprecipitation of H2aSBP and HRD1 (Fig. 6C). For SCFFbs2, Fbs2, the substrate recognition component of this E3 ligase presents additional interest. Fbs2 is a lectin that binds substrate N-glycans (34Yoshida Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2007; 71: 2623-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and for sugar chain recognition, the glycoprotein must undergo retrotranslocation to the cytosol where the E3 ligase is located. Thus, Fbs2 associates with the substrate at a very late ERAD stage. We had shown that Fbs2 targets the sugar mo"

This strategy relies on the limited background activity of the modified Cre recombinase (CreER) in the absence of its inducer, the competitive estrogen receptor ligand, tamoxifen. The RIP-CreER mouse (Tg (Ins2-cre/Esr1) 1Dam) is among the few available β-cell specific CreER mouse lines and thus it has been often used to manipulate gene expression in the insulin-producing cells of the endocrine pancreas.Here, we report the detection of tamoxifen-independent Cre activity as early as 2 months of age in RIP-CreER mice crossed with three distinct reporter strains.Evidence of Cre-mediated recombination of floxed alleles even in the absence of tamoxifen administration should warrant cautious use of this mouse for the study of pancreatic β-cells."

To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of this regulation, we study here, using different approaches, the interaction of Tau, spermine, and calcium, three representative partners of the tubulin C-terminal region, with a peptide composed of the last 42 residues of α1a-tubulin. The results show that their binding involves overlapping amino acid stretches in the C-terminal tubulin region: amino acid residues 421–441 for Tau, 430–432 and 444–451 for spermine, and 421–443 for calcium. Isothermal titration calorimetry, NMR, and cosedimentation experiments show that Tau and spermine have similar micromolar binding affinities, whereas their binding stoichiometry differs (C-terminal tubulin peptide/spermine stoichiometry 1:2, and C-terminal tubulin peptide/Tau stoichiometry 8:1). Interestingly, calcium, known as a negative regulator of microtubule assembly, can compete with the binding of Tau and spermine with the C-terminal domain of tubulin and with the positive effect of these two partners on microtubule assembly in vitro. This observation opens up the possibility that calcium may participate in the regulation of microtubule assembly in vivo through direct (still unknown) or indirect mechanism (displacement of microtubule partners). The functional importance of this part of tubulin was also underlined by the observation that an α-tubulin mutant deleted from the last 23 amino acid residues does not incorporate properly into the microtubule network of HeLa cells.

https://openalex.org/W2036535656,"In our investigations towards the isolation of potentially biologically active constituents from Orchidaceae, we carried out phytochemical and biological analyses of Vanda species. A preliminary biological screening revealed that Vanda coerulea (Griff. ex. Lindl) crude hydro-alcoholic stem extract displayed the best DPPH /(•)OH radical scavenging activity and in vitro inhibition of type 2 prostaglandin (PGE-2) release from UV(B) (60 mJ/cm(2)) irradiated HaCaT keratinocytes.Bio-guided fractionation and phytochemical analysis led to the isolation of five stilbenoids: imbricatin (1) methoxycoelonin (2) gigantol (3) flavidin (4) and coelonin (5). Stilbenoids (1-3) were the most concentrated in crude hydro-alcoholic stem extract and were considered as Vanda coerulea stem biomarkers. Dihydro-phenanthropyran (1) and dihydro-phenanthrene (2) displayed the best DPPH/(•)OH radical scavenging activities as well as HaCaT intracellular antioxidant properties (using DCFH-DA probe: IC(50) 8.8 µM and 9.4 µM, respectively) compared to bibenzyle (3) (IC(50) 20.6 µM). In turn, the latter showed a constant inhibition of PGE-2 production, stronger than stilbenoids (1) and (2) (IC(50) 12.2 µM and 19.3 µM, respectively). Western blot analysis revealed that stilbenoids (1-3) inhibited COX-2 expression at 23 µM. Interestingly, stilbenoids (1) and (2) but not (3) were able to inhibit human recombinant COX-2 activity.Major antioxidant stilbenoids (1-3) from Vanda coerulea stems displayed an inhibition of UV(B)-induced COX-2 expression. Imbricatin (1) and methoxycoelonin (2) were also able to inhibit COX-2 activity in a concentration-dependent manner thereby reducing PGE-2 production from irradiated HaCaT cells.

Although activation of the dopamine (DA) pathway is hypothesized to mediate these effects of PCP, the precise mechanisms by which PCP induces its effects remain to be elucidated. The present study investigated the effect of PCP on extracellular levels of DA (DAex) in the striatum and prefrontal cortex (PFC) using in vivo microdialysis in mice lacking the NMDA receptor channel ε1 or ε4 subunit (GluRε1 [GluN2A] or GluRε4 [GluN2D]) and locomotor activity. PCP significantly increased DAex in wildtype and GluRε1 knockout mice, but not in GluRε4 knockout mice, in the striatum and PFC. Acute and repeated administration of PCP did not increase locomotor activity in GluRε4 knockout mice. The present results suggest that PCP enhances dopaminergic transmission and increases locomotor activity by acting at GluRε4."

However, the potential role of Toca-1 in these processes has not been reported. Here, we show that epidermal growth factor (EGF) induces Toca-1 localization to lamellipodia, where it co-localizes with F-actin and Arp2/3 complex in A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells. EGF also induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Toca-1 and interactions with N-WASP and Abi1. Stable knockdown of Toca-1 expression by RNA interference has no effect on cell growth, EGF receptor expression, or internalization. However, Toca-1 knockdown cells display defects in EGF-induced filopodia and lamellipodial protrusions compared with control cells. Further analyses reveal a role for Toca-1 in localization of Arp2/3 and Abi1 to lamellipodia. Toca-1 knockdown cells also display a significant defect in EGF-induced motility and invasiveness. Taken together, these results implicate Toca-1 in coordinating actin assembly within filopodia and lamellipodia to promote EGF-induced cell migration and invasion."

Association analysis: Using a discovery sample of 187 UK families, nearly 3000 SNPs were genotyped across the chromosome 18 dyslexia susceptibility candidate region. Following association analysis, the top ranking SNPs were then genotyped in the remaining samples. The linkage analysis revealed a broad signal that spans approximately 40 Mb from 18p11.2 to 18q12.2. Following the association analysis and subsequent replication attempts, we observed consistent association with the same SNPs in three genes; melanocortin 5 receptor (MC5R), dymeclin (DYM) and neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated 4-like (NEDD4L).Along with already published biological evidence, MC5R, DYM and NEDD4L make attractive candidates for dyslexia susceptibility genes.

https://openalex.org/W2088852929,"Although the spread of drug resistance and the influence of climate change on malaria are most often considered separately, these factors have the potential to interact through altered levels of transmission intensity. The influence of transmission intensity on the evolution of drug resistance has been addressed in theoretical studies from a population genetics' perspective; less is known however on how epidemiological dynamics at the population level modulates this influence. We ask from a theoretical perspective, whether population dynamics can explain non-trivial, non-monotonic, patterns of treatment failure with transmission intensity, and, if so, under what conditions. We then address the implications of warmer temperatures in an East African highland, where, as in other similar regions at the altitudinal edge of malaria's distribution, there has been a pronounced increase of cases from the 1970s to the 1990s. Our theoretical analyses, with a transmission model that includes different levels of immunity, demonstrate that an increase in transmission beyond a threshold can lead to a decrease in drug resistance, as previously shown [1], but that a second threshold may occur and lead to the re-establishment of drug resistance. Estimates of the increase in transmission intensity from the 1970s to the 1990s for the Kenyan time series, obtained by fitting the two-stage version of the model with an explicit representation of vector dynamics, suggest that warmer temperatures are likely to have moved the system towards the first threshold, and in so doing, to have promoted the faster spread of drug resistance. Climate change and drug resistance can interact and need not be considered as alternative explanations for trends in disease incidence in this region. Non-monotonic patterns of treatment failure with transmission intensity similar to those described as the ‘valley phenomenon’ for Uganda can result from epidemiological dynamics but under poorly understood assumptions."
https://openalex.org/W2065314306,"Pathogens have important effects on host life-history traits, but the magnitude of these effects is often strongly context-dependent. The outcome of an interaction between a host and an infectious agent is often associated with the level of stress experienced by the host. Ranavirus causes disease and mortality in amphibian populations in various locations around the world, but most known cases of ranaviral infection have occurred in North America and the United Kingdom. While Ranavirus virulence has been investigated, the outcome of Ranavirus infection has seldom been related to the host environment. In a factorial experiment, we exposed Northern leopard frog (Lithobates pipiens, formerly Rana pipiens) tadpoles to different concentrations of Ranavirus and investigated the effect of host density on certain life-history traits, namely survival, growth rate, developmental stage and number of days from virus exposure to death. Our results suggest a prominent role of density in driving the direction of the interaction between L. pipiens tadpoles and Ranavirus. We showed that increasing animal holding density is detrimental for host fitness as mortality rate is higher, day of death earlier, development longer and growth rate significantly lower in high-density tanks. We observed a linear increase of detrimental effects when Ranavirus doses increased in low-density conditions, with control tadpoles having a significantly higher overall relative fitness. However, this pattern was no longer observed in high-density conditions, where the effects of increasing Ranavirus dose were limited. Infected and control animals fitness were consequently similar. We speculate that the host may eventually diverts the energy required for a metabolic/immune response triggered by the infection (i.e., direct costs of the infection) to better cope with the increase in environmental ""stress"" associated with high density (i.e., indirect benefits of the infection). Our results illustrate how the net fitness of organisms may be shaped by ecological context and emphasize the necessity of examining the direct/indirect costs and benefits balance to fully understand host-pathogen interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2153410863,"Clostridium difficile is an etiological agent of pseudomembranous colitis and antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Adhesion is the crucial first step in bacterial infection. Thus, in addition to toxins, the importance of colonization factors in C. difficile-associated disease is recognized. In this study, we identified Fbp68, one of the colonization factors that bind to fibronectin (Fn), as a manganese-binding protein (K(D) = 52.70 ± 1.97 nM). Furthermore, the conformation of Fbp68 changed dramatically upon manganese binding. Manganese binding can also stabilize the structure of Fbp68 as evidenced by the increased T(m) measured by thermodenatured circular dichroism and differential scanning calorimetry (CD, T(m) = 58-65 °C; differential scanning calorimetry, T(m) = 59-66 °C). In addition, enhanced tolerance to protease K also suggests greatly improved stability of Fbp68 through manganese binding. Fn binding activity was found to be dependent on manganese due to the lack of binding by manganese-free Fbp68 to Fn. The C-terminal 194 amino acid residues of Fbp68 (Fbp68C) were discovered to bind to the N-terminal domain of Fn (Fbp68C-NTD, K(D) = 233 ± 10 nM, obtained from isothermal titration calorimetry). Moreover, adhesion of C. difficile to Caco-2 cells can be partially blocked if cells are pretreated with Fbp68C, and the binding of Fbp68C on Fn siRNA-transfected cells was significantly reduced. These results raise the possibility that Fbp68 plays a key role in C. difficile adherence on host cells to initiate infection."
https://openalex.org/W1972178521,"The incidence and death rate of prostate cancer is increasing rapidly. In addition, the low sensitivity of prostate cancer to chemotherapy makes it difficult to treat this condition. The serine/threonine kinase Pim-1 plays an important role in cell cycle progression and apoptosis inhibition, resulting in prostate tumorigenesis. Therefore, Pim-1 inhibition has been expected to be an attractive target for developing new anti-cancer drugs. However, no small compounds targeting Pim-1 have progressed to clinical use because of their lack of specificity. Here, we have reported a new cell-permeable Pim-1 inhibitory p27(Kip1) peptide that could interfere with the binding of Pim-1 to its substrates and act as an anti-cancer drug. The peptide could bind to Pim-1 and inhibit phosphorylation of endogenous p27(Kip1) and Bad by Pim-1. Treatment of prostate cancer with the peptide induces G(1) arrest and subsequently apoptosis in vitro. However, the peptide showed almost no growth inhibitory or apoptosis-inducing effects in normal cells. The peptide could inhibit tumor growth in in vivo prostate cancer xenograft models. Moreover, the peptide treatment could overcome resistance to taxol, one of the first line chemotherapeutic agents for prostate cancer, and a combination of the peptide with taxol synergistically inhibited prostate cancer growth in vivo. These results indicate that a Pim-1 inhibitory p27(Kip1) peptide could be developed as an anti-cancer drug against prostate cancer."

Methods Questionnaires were used to collect information on epidemiological characteristics, illness features and co-morbidities of cases identified in the 2009 Victorian Influenza Sentinel Surveillance program. Results The median age of 132 index cases was 21 years, of whom 54 (41%) were under 18 years old and 28 (21%) had medical co-morbidities. The median symptom duration was significantly shorter for children who received antivirals than in those who did not (p = 0.03). Assumed influenza transmission was observed in 63 (51%) households. Influenza-like illness (ILI) developed in 115 of 351 household contacts, a crude secondary attack rate of 33%. Increased ILI rates were seen in households with larger numbers of children but not larger numbers of adults. Multivariate analysis indicated contacts of cases with cough and diarrhoea, and contacts in quarantined households were significantly more likely to develop influenza-like symptoms. Conclusion Most cases of pH1N1 in our study were mild with similar clinical characteristics to seasonal influenza. Illness and case features relating to virus excretion, age and household quarantine may have influenced secondary ILI rates within households."

https://openalex.org/W2033799388,"Inflammation of the middle ear cavity (otitis media) and the abnormal deposition of bone at the otic capsule are common causes of conductive hearing impairment in children and adults. Although a host of environmental factors can contribute to these conditions, a genetic predisposition has an important role as well. Here, we analyze the Tail-short (Ts) mouse, which harbors a spontaneous semi-dominant mutation that causes skeletal defects and hearing loss. By genetic means, we show that the Ts phenotypes arise from an 18-kb deletion/insertion of the Rpl38 gene, encoding a ribosomal protein of the large subunit. We show that Ts mutants exhibit significantly elevated auditory-brain stem response thresholds and reduced distortion-product otoacoustic emissions, in the presence of normal endocochlear potentials and typical inner ear histology suggestive of a conductive hearing impairment. We locate the cause of the hearing impairment to the middle ear, demonstrating over-ossification at the round window ridge, ectopic deposition of cholesterol crystals in the middle ear cavity, enlarged Eustachian tube, and chronic otitis media with effusion all beginning at around 3 weeks after birth. Using specific antisera, we demonstrate that Rpl38 is an ∼8-kDa protein that is predominantly expressed in mature erythrocytes. Finally, using an Rpl38 cDNA transgene, we rescue the Ts phenotypes. Together, these data present a previously uncharacterized combination of interrelated middle ear pathologies and suggest Rpl38 deficiency as a model to dissect the causative relationships between neo-ossification, cholesterol crystal deposition, and Eustachian tubes in the etiology of otitis media."

However, little is known regarding the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying this process. To study the role of dopamine in memory recall, we have analyzed dopamine transporter heterozygous knockout mice (DAT+/−), and found that while these mice possess normal learning, consolidation, and memory recall under full cue conditions, they exhibit specific deficits in pattern completion under partial cue condition. This form of memory recall deficit in the dopamine transporter heterozygous knockout mice can be reversed by a low dose of the dopamine antagonist haloperidol, further confirming that the inability to retrieve memory patterns is a result of dopamine imbalance. Therefore, our results reveal that a delicate control of the brain's dopamine level is critical for pattern completion during associative memory recall."

Several genetic models have been proposed but fail to give mechanistic insights. Here we show how dominant negative interactions might give rise to heterotic responses. We also explore a biochemical model of gene dosage effects in macromolecular complexes in a similar context. With the help of heuristic examples and computer simulations we find that heterotic individuals display higher allelic diversity and smaller average multimer concentrations than nonheterotic ones. As intuitively expected’ the existence of heterosis involving multimeric complexes arises when the inbred parents have on average smaller genetic values than the maximum possible.

Since bacterial cellulose (Acetobacter xylinum zooglea) and animal cellulose (tunicin) may be assumed to be formed in conditions which differ radically from those which govern cell-wall deposition in green plants, it appeared to be of interest to investigate the microscopic structure of these natural cellulose membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2013361946,"WE have recently shown1 that the caterpillars of the flour moth, Ephestia kuehniella, grow slowly on a purified diet in which all the known vitamins of the B-complex are provided in pure substance. The length of the larval stage is about 7–8 weeks, as compared with 5–6 weeks on a diet which contains yeast or yeast extract. A preparation of dried grass juice (Cerophyl Laboratories) was found to be an excellent source of the missing factor which, in its relations to charcoal, seemed to behave like folic acid2. It was adsorbed on norrite at pH 3 and was contained in the eluate, but not in the filtrate. We later obtained synthetic folic acid (Lederle Laboratories)3 and established that this is the missing factor. On a purified diet, with folic acid, most of the larvæ pupated after 5–6 weeks ; whereas without folic acid they mostly died and none pupated before the eighth week. The minimal optimal requirements seem to be about 2 µgm./gm. of the dry diet, that is, of the order of the riboflavin requirements of another insect, Tribolium confusum. We have also some evidence that crystalline vitamin Bc (Parke Davis and Co.)4 has a similar, if not identical, effect as folic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1993619431,"Observers respond more accurately to targets in visual search tasks that share properties with previously presented items, and transient attention can learn featural consistencies on a precue, irrespective of its absolute location.We investigated whether such attentional benefits also apply to temporal consistencies. Would performance on a precued Vernier acuity discrimination task, followed by a mask, improve if the cue-lead times (CLTs; 50, 100, 150 or 200 ms) remained constant between trials compared to when they changed? The results showed that if CLTs remained constant for a few trials in a row, Vernier acuity performance gradually improved while changes in CLT from one trial to the next led to worse than average discrimination performance. The results show that transient attention can quickly adjust to temporal regularities, similarly to spatial and featural regularities. Further experiments show that this form of learning is not under voluntary control.The results add to a growing literature showing how consistency in visual presentation improves visual performance, in this case temporal consistency."

https://openalex.org/W1970527565,"Previous studies have demonstrated that molecules of the Ras signaling pathway are present in intracellular compartments, including early endosomes, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and the Golgi, and suggested that mitogens can regulate Ras activity in these endomembranes. In this study, we investigated the effect of angiotensin II (AngII) on intracellular Ras activity in living HEK293 cells expressing angiotensin type 1 receptors (AT1-Rs) using newly developed bioluminescence resonance energy transfer biosensors. To investigate the subcellular localization of AngII-induced Ras activation, we targeted our probes to various intracellular compartments, such as the trans-Golgi network (TGN), the ER, and early endosomes. Using these biosensors, we detected AngII-induced Ras activation in the TGN and ER, but not in early endosomes. In cells expressing a cytoplasmic tail deletion AT1-R mutant, the AngII-induced response was enhanced, suggesting that receptor internalization and β-arrestin binding are not required for AngII-induced Ras activation in endomembranes. Although we were able to demonstrate EGF-induced Ras activation in the plasma membrane and TGN, but not in other endomembranes, AG1478, an EGF receptor inhibitor, did not affect the AngII-induced response, suggesting that the latter is independent of EGF receptor transactivation. AngII was unable to stimulate Ras activity in the studied compartments in cells expressing a G protein coupling-deficient AT1-R mutant (125DRY127 to 125AAY127). These data suggest that AngII can stimulate Ras activity in the TGN and ER with a G protein-dependent mechanism, which does not require β-arrestin-mediated signaling, receptor internalization, and EGF receptor transactivation.

The small G proteins, such as Ras, Rho, and Rac, are central players of many signal transduction pathways that regulate a wide variety of cell functions. The small G proteins are monomeric GTPases, serve as molecular switches, and regulate a wide variety of functions, such as gene expression, cell proliferation, cytoskeleton dynamics, the cell cycle, and vesicular transport (1Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar). The >100 mammalian small G proteins are classified into several families, including the Ras and Rho families. Generally, their GDP-bound form is inactive, and upon stimulatory effect, GDP will be changed to GTP, and this activated form will interact with downstream signaling partners. GDP/GTP conversion is stimulated by a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, whereas small G protein inactivation is facilitated by GTPase-activating proteins (2García-Mata R. Burridge K. Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 36-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 3Buday L. Downward J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1786: 178-187PubMed Google Scholar). Small G proteins are active in association with a cellular membrane, and according to the well established model, an extracellular stimulus causes the activation of the Ras and Rho proteins via plasma membrane receptors (3Buday L. Downward J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1786: 178-187PubMed Google Scholar). Activated Ras proteins activate Raf protein kinases, leading to MAPK pathway signalization (4Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). Raf proteins are the main and direct effectors of Ras proteins, and activated Raf kinases stimulate MEKs. Membrane localization on the cytoplasmic leaflet of cellular membranes is mediated by post-translational modifications with a lipid moiety on their C-terminal tail. The C-terminal hypervariable regions of Ras isoforms contain the motifs for different plasma membrane signaling nanocluster associations. K-Ras localizes in a cholesterol-independent nanocluster with the help of its polybasic domain, which associates electrostatically with plasma membrane lipids. This association can be disrupted by PKC phosphorylation of Ras, which also causes mitochondrial translocation (5Bivona T.G. Quatela S.E. Bodemann B.O. Ahearn I.M. Soskis M.J. Mor A. Miura J. Wiener H.H. Wright L. Saba S.G. Yim D. Fein A. Pérez de Castro I. Li C. Thompson C.B. Cox A.D. Philips M.R. Mol.

Immunol. 2006; 24: 771-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). It has been shown that targeting of Ras proteins to the plasma membrane is preceded by their localization to endomembranes, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 3The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumGPCRG protein-coupled receptorAngIIangiotensin IIAT1-Rangiotensin type 1 receptorBRETbioluminescence resonance energy transferRBDRas-binding domainTGNtrans-Golgi network. and Golgi (8Choy E.

Early studies also demonstrated that elements of Ras signaling can be detected in endosomes (9Di Guglielmo G.M. Baass P.C. Ou W.J. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4269-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) and have an important role in the MAPK signaling of growth factor receptors, including the EGF receptor (10Wang Y. Pennock S. Chen X. Wang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7279-7290Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 11Sorkin A. McClure M. Huang F. Carter R. Curr.

Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was shown that internalized growth factor receptors can selectively activate endosomal H-Ras (but not K-Ras) signaling (13Roy S. Wyse B. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5128-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Although it is generally accepted that the Ras signal generation predominantly occurs at the plasma membrane (14Augsten M. Pusch R. Biskup C. Rennert K. Wittig U. Beyer K. Blume A. Wetzker R. Friedrich K. Rubio I. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), it seems that the plasma membrane is not the sole platform for Ras signal generation (15Plowman S.J. Hancock J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1746: 274-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In addition to the well established role of the endosomal compartment in growth factor receptor signaling, recent data suggest that Ras signaling in other endomembranes may also have physiological roles. For example, a recent study proposed that Ras signaling in the Golgi has an effect on thymocyte selection (16Daniels M.A. Teixeiro E. Gill J. Hausmann B. Roubaty D. Holmberg K. Werlen G. Holländer G.A. Gascoigne N.R. Palmer E. Nature. 2006; 444: 724-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The demonstration of the presence of various elements of Ras signaling in intracellular compartments, including the Golgi and ER, raises the possibility that Ras signal generation can also occur in these compartments (7Mor A. Philips M.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 24: 771-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). endoplasmic reticulum G protein-coupled receptor angiotensin II angiotensin type 1 receptor bioluminescence resonance energy transfer Ras-binding domain trans-Golgi network. Ras also can be activated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Angiotensin II (AngII) is an octapeptide hormone that is the main effector of the renin-angiotensin system and mediates its physiological and pathological effects. AngII can bind and activate two types of angiotensin receptors (angiotensin type 1 and 2 receptors). The angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1-R) is a typical seven-transmembrane GPCR, and the G protein-mediated “classical” signaling mechanisms are responsible for the majority of AngII-evoked cellular responses. These signaling mechanisms have a wide spectrum, including second messenger generation (Ca2+ signal via inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol), activation of small G proteins and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, regulation of ion channels, and transactivation of growth factor receptors. After binding to the AT1-R, a heterotrimeric G protein (Gq) mediates the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate by phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase Cβ, resulting in the generation of second messengers (17Hunyady L. Catt K.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 953-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). It is well established that extracellular stimulus of the AT1-R can lead to activation of various small G proteins, including Ras, either through transactivation of a tyrosine kinase receptor (mainly via the EGF receptor) or through transactivation independently (18Ohtsu H. Suzuki H. Nakashima H. Dhobale S. Frank G.D. Motley E.D. Eguchi S. Hypertension. 2006; 48: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 19Higuchi S. Ohtsu H. Suzuki H. Shirai H. Frank G.D.

Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2035-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Not only does endocytosis of GPCRs regulate the activity of plasma membrane receptors (21Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hunyady L. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: S47-S56PubMed Google Scholar), but it can also initiate signaling pathways, such as MAPK activation (23Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated whether agonist stimulation of a GPCR, the AT1-R, can lead to intracellular Ras activation and compared these responses with those of the EGF receptor. Recently, a wide range of FRET-based approaches were used to examine Ras and other signal transduction mechanisms (24Bivona T.G. Philips M.R. Methods. 2005; 37: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 25Kiyokawa E. Hara S. Nakamura T. Matsuda M. Cancer Sci. 2006; 97: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To investigate Ras activation in various locations inside cells upon agonist stimulation of the AT1-R, we have developed several intra- and intermolecular probes for bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) measurements in living cell experiments based on previous FRET-based studies (26Mochizuki N. Yamashita S. Kurokawa K. Ohba Y. Nagai T. Miyawaki A. Matsuda M. Nature. 2001; 411: 1065-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 27Nakamura T. Kurokawa K. Kiyokawa E. Matsuda M. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 406: 315-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We show that Ras signal generation can be detected not only in the plasma membrane but also in intracellular compartments, such as the trans-Golgi and ER, in response to AngII stimulation. Molecular biology enzymes were obtained from Fermentas (Burlington, Canada), Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), and Invitrogen. Cell culture dishes and plates for BRET measurements were purchased from Geiner Bio-One GmbH (Kremsmunster, Austria). Lipofectamine 2000 and coelenterazine h were from Invitrogen. Unless stated otherwise, all other chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma. HEK293 cells were from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). For the construction of our intramolecular BRET probes, we followed the design of the Raichu (Ras and interacting protein chimeric unit) FRET probes from the Matsuda laboratory (26Mochizuki N. Yamashita S. Kurokawa K. Ohba Y. Nagai T. Miyawaki A. Matsuda M. Nature. 2001; 411: 1065-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 27Nakamura T. Kurokawa K. Kiyokawa E. Matsuda M. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 406: 315-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The cDNA parts of the constructs were generated by amplification either from a respective expressed sequence tag clone (German Resource Center for Genome Research (RZPD), Berlin, Germany) or from H295R human cell line cDNA by PCR. For the intramolecular BRET probes, the order of the domains was similar to that in the Raichu probes (26Mochizuki N. Yamashita S. Kurokawa K. Ohba Y. Nagai T. Miyawaki A. Matsuda M. Nature. 2001; 411: 1065-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). We used the pEYFP-C1 plasmid backbone (Clontech, Mountain View, CA), and the fluorescent acceptor protein (YFP) was followed by H-Ras, the Ras-binding domain (RBD) of Raf-1, and luciferase (see Fig. 1 for schematic representation). We have previously shown that the Raf-1 RBD (amino acids 51–131) is able to recognize activated Ras but is not capable of being recruited to the plasma membrane (28Bondeva T. Balla A. Várnai P. Balla T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2323-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), which makes this RBD suitable for utilizing in targeted biosensors. We used Renilla luciferase as the energy donor by subcloning the codon-humanized Renilla luciferase from pRluc-N2 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The intermolecular BRET probes were derived from their respective intramolecular probes by splitting them between Ras and the RBD of Raf-1 by adding suitable start and stop codon sequences. Targeting was achieved by placing a targeting signal at either the N- or C-terminal end of the probe. We used several previously described targeting motifs to target our BRET probes (29Várnai P. Balla T. Pflugers Arch. 2007; 455: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Targeting to the plasma membrane was achieved using various distinct tags. We fused CAAX motifs from Ras proteins C-terminally as described (26Mochizuki N. Yamashita S. Kurokawa K. Ohba Y. Nagai T. Miyawaki A. Matsuda M. Nature. 2001; 411: 1065-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 30Fukano T. Sawano A. Ohba Y. Matsuda M. Miyawaki A. Cell. Struct. Funct. 2007; 32: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, the tK tag (K-Ras CAAX targeting motif, tail K-Ras), KMSKDGKKKKKKSKTKCVIM, consists of the membrane-targeting CAAX motif and hypervariable regions of K-Ras (GenBank accession number NM_004985). The tHL tag (tail H-Ras long, KLNPPDESGPGCMSCKCVLS) consists of the membrane-targeting CAAX motif and hypervariable regions of H-Ras (accession number NM_005343), whereas the tHS tag (tail H-Ras short, CMSCKCVLS) consists of the membrane-targeting CAAX motif but without the hypervariable regions of H-Ras. The MP (MyrPalm) and PP (PalmPalm) tags targeting to plasma membrane rafts were based on the design of Zacharias et al. (31Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1750) Google Scholar), where the MP tag is the N-terminal amino acid sequence (MGCIKSKRKDNLNDDE) from Lyn kinase (accession number NM_002350), and the PP tag is the N-terminal amino acid sequence (MLCCMRRTKQ) from GAP43 (accession number NM_002045) (31Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1750) Google Scholar). Targeting to the Golgi surface was achieved by fusing the full-length trans-Golgi network protein 2 (also known as TGN38; accession number NM_006464) (32Szentpetery Z. Várnai P. Balla T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 8225-8230Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and targeting to the ER surface was achieved by adding segment 233–250 of the yeast Ubc6 protein (accession number NM_001178991) or the C-terminal segment 521–587 of the Sac1 phosphoinositide phosphatase (accession number NM_014016) (29Várnai P. Balla T. Pflugers Arch. 2007; 455: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 33Várnai P. Balla A. Hunyady L. Balla T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 7859-7864Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Endosomal targeting was done by fusing the probes C-terminally with the FYVE domain (segment 1253–1411) of EEA1 (early endosome antigen 1; accession number NM_3566) Mutagenesis was performed using standard mutagenesis conditions. After verifying the mutations with dideoxy sequencing, the mutated fragment was exchanged between the wild-type and mutated portions with suitable restriction sites to avoid the generation of unwanted mutations outside the sequenced regions. pcDNA3.1-AT1A-R, pcDNA3.1-AT1A-RΔ319 (with Tyr319 substituted with a stop codon), and pcDNA3.1-DRY/AAY-AT1A-R (with the highly conserved 125DRY127 sequence mutated to 125AAY127) were described previously (34Smith R.D.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The experiments were performed on the HEK293 cell line. The cells were cultured in DMEM with penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) and 10% heat-inactivated FBS in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cells were cultured in plastic dishes, trypsinized prior to transfection, and transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and plated on polylysine-pretreated white 96-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well for BRET measurements. The DNA amount was 0.2–0.4 μg/well; the amount of Lipofectamine 2000 was 0.5 μl/well. We monitored the molecular interactions of either two parts of a biosensor (intramolecular probes) or two proteins (intermolecular probes) by BRET measurements. The measurements were performed after 24 h of transfection on white 96-well plates. Before BRET measurements, the HEK293 cells were switched to serum-free medium (DMEM with 0.1% BSA) for several hours (4–6 h) to render the cells quiescent. The medium of the cells was changed prior to measurements to a modified Krebs-Ringer buffer containing 120 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.7 mm MgSO4, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm NaHEPES (pH 7.4), and the BRET measurements were performed at 37 °C. The BRET measurements were started after the addition of the cell-permeable substrate coelenterazine at a final concentration of 5 μm, and the counts were recorded using a Berthold Mithras LB 940 multilabel reader, which allows for the detection of signals using filters at 485- and 530-nm wavelengths. The detection time was 0.25–0.5 s. The BRET ratios were calculated as the 530/485 nm ratio. The measurements were done in triplicate. The BRET records are the average of at least three independent experiments. BRET ratios were base line-corrected to the vehicle curve using GraphPad Prism software. The approximate BRET ratio of the YFP-deficient intramolecular RasBRET-tK probe was ∼0.8 (data not shown). The localization and distribution of the targeted probes were analyzed using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser scanning microscope in living cells plated on polylysine-pretreated glass coverslips (3 × 105 cells/35-mm dish). To study Ras activation after AngII or EGF stimulation in intracellular compartments, we first established a BRET-based Ras activity measurement using newly developed probes. For the detection of Ras activation, HEK293 cells were chosen for our studies because this cell line is broadly used for angiotensin receptor studies (20Shah B.H. Yesilkaya A. Olivares-Reyes J.A. Chen H.D. Hunyady L. Catt K.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2035-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 23Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 10782-10787Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Moreover, this cell type has endogenous EGF receptors, and Ras activation upon EGF treatment could be detected using BRET measurements. Stimulation of endogenous EGF receptors by EGF yielded a robust and prolonged response in Ras activation as assessed in the plasma membrane by the intramolecular RasBRET-tK probe (see details under “Experimental Procedures”) (Fig. 1A), which was designed as the BRET version of the Raichu-Ras fusion protein (26Mochizuki N. Yamashita S. Kurokawa K. Ohba Y. Nagai T. Miyawaki A. Matsuda M. Nature. 2001; 411: 1065-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). The probes indicate when the respective Ras becomes loaded with GTP because the RBD of Raf-1 increases its affinity dramatically for Ras upon GTP loading. This results in conformational changes that bring the energy acceptor close to the donor, as was shown by the developers of the corresponding FRET probes (38Ohba Y. Kurokawa K. Matsuda M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 859-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Compared with EGF treatment, Ras activation upon AngII stimulation resulted in a transient and smaller response in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1A). To optimize the probe, tags were used to target it to different plasma membrane microdomains, including non-raft domains (tK), caveolae/rafts (tHS and tHL) (39Prior I.A. Harding A. Yan J. Sluimer J. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), and plasma membrane raft domains (MP and PP) (31Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1750) Google Scholar). The localization and distribution of the targeted probes in HEK293 cells were verified by confocal microscopy (Fig. 1, lower panels). Among these targeting sequences, the MP-targeted version of the intramolecular probe yielded the most sensitive probe (Fig. 1B) (data not shown for the others). To further improve the sensitivity of the detection of Ras activation in the plasma membrane, an intermolecular variant of the MP-targeted RasBRET probe (the energy donor and acceptor are in different polypeptide chains; MP-YFP-Ras + RBD-luciferase) (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 1C) was constructed. Fig. 1C shows that this setup yielded a greatly improved and very sensitive probe for measuring Ras activation. The higher signal-to-noise ratio of the intermolecular biosensor can be explained by the high basal BRET signal of the intramolecular probes (∼1.4 versus ∼1.1) because, in these constructs, the donor and acceptor are in the same molecule. The cytosolic (spatially unbiased) intermolecular plasmid pair for RasBRET (non-targeted YFP-Ras plus RBD-luciferase) had the lowest absolute level of the BRET signal (∼0.9). We validated that the change in the BRET signal using the intermolecular MP-RasBRET probe in our experimental protocol is dependent on the activation state of Ras (hence, the interaction of Ras and the Raf RBD) by performing measurements with mutated Ras domains in the probe. Fig. 2 shows that, by utilizing the “active” form of the intermolecular MP-RasBRET probe pair (G12V), we detected the maximal absolute level of the BRET signal. In contrast, when we applied the “inactive” Ras S17N mutation, the extent of the BRET signal was lower than the base line of the wild-type probe, showing that Ras was partially active in control cells. Because the optimization of BRET biosensors showed that the intermolecular MP-RasBRET probe resulted in the best Ras activation biosensors, we used the intermolecular BRET approach in our later work, and therefore, all subsequent data represent results using intermolecular BRET biosensors. After optimization and validation of our BRET strategy, experiments were performed with RasBRET probes in HEK293 cells cotransfected with the wild-type AT1A-R, the tail deletion AT1A-RΔ319 mutant (which is unable to internalize) (40Balmforth A.J. Lee A.J. Bajaj B.P. Dickinson C.J. Warburton P. Ball S.G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 291: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), or the AT1-R-DRY/AAY mutant (which is unable to couple to Gαq and initiate inositol phosphate signaling) (35Gáborik Z. Jagadeesh G. Zhang M. Spät A. Catt K.J. Hunyady L. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 2220-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 37Wei H. Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Karnik S.S. Hunyady L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 10782-10787Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, AngII stimulation of the wild-type AT1-R caused transient Ras activation in the plasma membrane, which was rapidly terminated because of the receptor desensitization and internalization. However, when the desensitization or internalization was reduced in cells expressing the AT1A-RΔ319 mutant, Ras activation was enhanced and prolonged. We did not detect significant Ras activation when utilizing the AT1-R-DRY/AAY mutant, which suggests that the AngII-induced Ras activation is predominantly G protein-mediated. In the next set of experiments, the effect of extracellular stimuli on intracellular Ras activation was examined. To investigate specifically the possible compartmentalized Ras signaling processes, we targeted our probes to the surface of intracellular organelles using previously described targeting motifs (29Várnai P. Balla T. Pflugers Arch. 2007; 455: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These motifs were placed at either the N or C terminus of the respective probes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We used intermolecular probe pairs in which one of the interacting partners (either YFP-Ras or RBD-luciferase) was tagged with the targeting sequence while the other polypeptide was not targeted to organelles and was therefore expressed in the cytosol. The micrographs (confocal microscopic images) in Fig. 4 demonstrate that all probes were properly expressed in the targeted compartment. HEK293 cells were cotransfected with the AT1A-R (wild-type AT1A-R, AT1A-RΔ319 or AT1A-R-DRY/AAY) and with the indicated intermolecular probes targeted to various compartments, such as the trans-Golgi network (TGN), the ER, and endosomes. EGF- and AngII-induced Ras activation was detected in the Golgi using YFP-Ras targeted to the TGN (the targeting sequence was fused to the N terminus of YFP-Ras, and RBD-luciferase was cytosolic) (Fig. 4A). AngII caused a rapid and transient Ras activation in the TGN (Fig. 4A). In contrast to the Ras activation in the plasma membrane, where AngII stimulation resulted in a much smaller response compared with EGF-evoked activation, the changes in the BRET ratios in the TGN were quite similar for EGF and AngII, suggesting that the relative Ras activation efficacy of AngII may be higher than that of EGF in this compartment. It is also important to note that the response to AngII consistently occurred more rapidly then the EGF-induced response. To assess the compartmentalized Ras signaling upon agonist stimulation, we compared the data obtained using the wild-type AT1-R and an internalization-deficient AT1-R mutant (AT1A-RΔ319) coexpressed with various BRET probes in HEK293 cells. Our data show that the AngII-induced Ras activation in the TGN is not a consequence of receptor internalization because the internalization-deficient AT1-R mutant showed prolonged, rather than inhibited, Ras activation compared with the wild-type AT1-R (Fig. 4A). We also detected Ras activation on the surface of the ER using both Ubc6- and Sac1- targeted intermolecular probes. In these constructs, the ER-targeting sequences were fused to the C terminus of the RBD-luciferase part while the YFP-Ras part was cytosolic. Interestingly, only AngII stimulation activated Ras in the ER, whereas EGF was not able to show this effect (Fig. 4B). The kinetics and characteristics of the AngI"

https://openalex.org/W2088967849,"HOUSTOUN1 has pointed out that a three-colour theory, such as that of Young and Helmholtz, inevitably leads to mathematical contradictions. It is well known in addition that a theory in which there are only three primary sensitivities, such as red, green and blue, becomes unsatisfactory when the many different forms of defective colour vision are studied in detail. Pieron2 has recently attempted to meet these difficulties, but only by a complex and speculative hypothesis. Chapanis3 has published results of experiments on variations of the saturations of spectrum colours, which are inconsistent with a three-colour theory."

Here we studied the interaction between Vsp1 and Vsp2 with brain endothelium in more detail.We compared Vsp1 to Vsp2 using human brain microvascular endothelial cell (HBMEC) association assays with aminoacid radiolabeled Vsp-expressing clones of recombinant Borrelia burgdorferi and lanthanide-labeled purified lipidated Vsp1 (LVsp1) and Vsp2 (LVsp2) and inoculations of the lanthanide-labeled proteins into mice. The results showed that heterologous expression of LVsp1 or LVsp2 in B. burgdorferi increased its association with HBMEC to a similar degree. Purified lanthanide-labeled lipidated Vsp1 (LVsp1) and LVsp2 by themselves were capable of associating with HBMEC. The association of LVsp1 with brain endothelium was time-dependent, saturable, and required the lipidation. The association of Vsp1 with HBMEC was inhibited by incubation at lower temperature or with excess unlabeled LVsp1 or LVsp2 but not with excess rVsp1 or mouse albumin or an anti Vsp1 monoclonal antibody. The association of LVsp2 with HBMEC and its movement from blood to brain parenchyma significantly increased in the presence of LVsp1.Variable bacterial outer membrane lipoproteins interact with brain endothelium differently; the lipidation and variable features at the protein dome region are key modulators of this interaction."

Liver cytoplasm may be determined either by estimating the sum of the protein, phospholipin and nucleic acid contents of the liver or by estimating the non-glycogen non-lipid liver solids. It was suggested at the time that the determination of liver cytoplasm by means of the non-glycogen non-lipid solids may lend itself to a simple and rapid assessment of the biological value of a protein. Since then, investigations have been in progress in this laboratory with the view of developing a suitable method. The most important results obtained from a large number of tests have already been reported2,3, and a detailed paper is being prepared for publication."
