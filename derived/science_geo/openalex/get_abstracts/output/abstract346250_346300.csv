https://openalex.org/W1998680662,High-resolution chemostratigraphy reveals an episode of enrichment of the redox-sensitive transition metals molybdenum and rhenium in the late Archean Mount McRae Shale in Western Australia. Correlations with organic carbon indicate that these metals were derived from contemporaneous seawater. Rhenium/osmium geochronology demonstrates that the enrichment is a primary sedimentary feature dating to 2501 ± 8 million years ago (Ma). Molybdenum and rhenium were probably supplied to Archean oceans by oxidative weathering of crustal sulfide minerals. These findings point to the presence of small amounts of O 2 in the environment more than 50 million years before the start of the Great Oxidation Event.

Protein kinases comprise the single largest protein class and reflect Giardia's requirement for a complex signal transduction network for coordinating differentiation. Lateral gene transfer from bacterial and archaeal donors has shaped Giardia's genome, and previously unknown gene families, for example, cysteine-rich structural proteins, have been discovered. Unexpectedly, the genome shows little evidence of heterozygosity, supporting recent speculations that this organism is sexual. This genome sequence will not only be valuable for investigating the evolution of eukaryotes, but will also be applied to the search for new therapeutics for this parasite."

https://openalex.org/W2024011553,"The CCR5 co-receptor binds to the HIV-1 gp120 envelope glycoprotein and facilitates HIV-1 entry into cells. Its N terminus is tyrosine-sulfated, as are many antibodies that react with the co-receptor binding site on gp120. We applied nuclear magnetic resonance and crystallographic techniques to analyze the structure of the CCR5 N terminus and that of the tyrosine-sulfated antibody 412d in complex with gp120 and CD4. The conformations of tyrosine-sulfated regions of CCR5 (α-helix) and 412d (extended loop) are surprisingly different. Nonetheless, a critical sulfotyrosine on CCR5 and on 412d induces similar structural rearrangements in gp120. These results now provide a framework for understanding HIV-1 interactions with the CCR5 N terminus during viral entry and define a conserved site on gp120, whose recognition of sulfotyrosine engenders posttranslational mimicry by the immune system."

https://openalex.org/W2091864502,High-resolution geochemical analyses of organic-rich shale and carbonate through the 2500 million-year-old Mount McRae Shale in the Hamersley Basin of northwestern Australia record changes in both the oxidation state of the surface ocean and the atmospheric composition. The Mount McRae record of sulfur isotopes captures the widespread and possibly permanent activation of the oxidative sulfur cycle for perhaps the first time in Earth's history. The correlation of the time-series sulfur isotope signals in northwestern Australia with equivalent strata from South Africa suggests that changes in the exogenic sulfur cycle recorded in marine sediments were global in scope and were linked to atmospheric evolution. The data suggest that oxygenation of the surface ocean preceded pervasive and persistent atmospheric oxygenation by 50 million years or more.

However, application of TMS is limited by uncertainty concerning its physiological effects. We applied TMS to the cat visual cortex and evaluated the neural and hemodynamic consequences. Short TMS pulse trains elicited initial activation (approximately 1 minute) and prolonged suppression (5 to 10 minutes) of neural responses. Furthermore, TMS disrupted the temporal structure of activity by altering phase relationships between neural signals. Despite the complexity of this response, neural changes were faithfully reflected in hemodynamic signals; quantitative coupling was present over a range of stimulation parameters. These results demonstrate long-lasting neural responses to TMS and support the use of hemodynamic-based neuroimaging to effectively monitor these changes over time."

https://openalex.org/W1971655998,"The hyperfine interaction of an electron with the nuclei is considered as the primary obstacle to coherent control of the electron spin in semiconductor quantum dots. We show, however, that the nuclei in singly charged quantum dots act constructively by focusing the electron spin precession about a magnetic field into well-defined modes synchronized with a laser pulse protocol. In a dot with a synchronized electron, the light-stimulated fluctuations of the hyperfine nuclear field acting on the electron are suppressed. The information about electron spin precession is imprinted in the nuclei and thereby can be stored for tens of minutes in darkness. The frequency focusing drives an electron spin ensemble into dephasing-free subspaces with the potential to realize single frequency precession of the entire ensemble."
https://openalex.org/W2058968970,"Most individuals with Down syndrome show early onset of Alzheimer disease (AD), resulting from the extra copy of chromosome 21. Located on this chromosome is a gene that encodes the dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A). One of the pathological hallmarks in AD is the presence of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which are insoluble deposits that consist of abnormally hyperphosphorylated Tau. Previously it was reported that Tau at the Thr-212 residue was phosphorylated by Dyrk1A in vitro. To determine the physiological significance of this phosphorylation, an analysis was made of the amount of phospho-Thr-212-Tau (pT212) in the brains of transgenic mice that overexpress the human DYRK1A protein (DYRK1A TG mice) that we recently generated. A significant increase in the amount of pT212 was found in the brains of DYRK1A transgenic mice when compared with age-matched littermate controls. We further examined whether Dyrk1A phosphorylates other Tau residues that are implicated in NFTs. We found that Dyrk1A also phosphorylates Tau at Ser-202 and Ser-404 in vitro. Phosphorylation by Dyrk1A strongly inhibited the ability of Tau to promote microtubule assembly. Following this, using mammalian cells and DYRK1A TG mouse brains, it was demonstrated that the amounts of phospho-Ser-202-Tau and phospho-Ser-404-Tau are enhanced when DYRK1A amounts are high. These results provide the first in vivo evidence for a physiological role of DYRK1A in the hyperphosphorylation of Tau and suggest that the extra copy of the DYRK1A gene contributes to the early onset of AD.

DS patients suffer various symptoms, including congenital heart defects, immune and endocrine system defects, mental retardation, and early onset of Alzheimer disease (AD) (3Korenberg J.R. Chen X.N.

Both DS and AD patients have pathological hall-marks, amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that are insoluble deposits made of proteins called β-amyloid (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated Tau, respectively (4Grundke-Iqbal I.

Pathol. 1973; 73: 457-476PubMed Google Scholar). Although an early onset AD in DS patients is not clearly understood, one potential mechanism is the presence of three chromosomal copies of β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene. However, the APP overexpression alone in mice does not show the endosome abnormalities observed in AD-like pathology (7Cataldo A.M. Petanceska S. Peterhoff C.M. Terio N.B. Epstein C.J. Villar A. Carlson E.J. Staufenbiel M. Nixon R.A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6788-6792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), implying the necessity of additional genes on the chromosome 21 for a full spectrum of AD pathologies. NFTs found in AD are composed of paired helical filaments (PHFs), which are mainly composed of hyperphosphorylated Tau protein (8Selkoe D.J. Neuron. 1991; 6: 487-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar). To date, more than 30 phosphorylation sites and 7–10 mol of phosphates per mol of Tau have been observed in PHF-Tau (9Ksiezak-Reding H. Liu W.K. Yen S.H.

Although Tau protein is phosphorylated in vitro by numerous kinases, it is unclear how many kinases actually phosphorylate Tau in vivo. Currently, only glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), cyclin-dependent kinase 5, cAMP-dependent protein kinase A, and microtubule affinity-regulating kinase are known to modulate Tau phosphorylation in vivo at some level, either directly or indirectly (11Johnson G.V.

Genomics. 1999; 57: 407-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Dyrk1A has dual substrate specificities as follows: autophosphorylation on the tyrosine 321 residue for self-activation and phosphorylation of target proteins on serine/threonine residues with a preferred phosphorylation consensus motif of RPX(S/T)P (12Kentrup H.

Dyrk1A potentially phosphorylates or interacts with several proteins, including transcription factors (NFATc, STAT3, Forkhead, CREB, and Gli1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 2Bϵ, Dynamin 1, cyclin L2, Hip-1, and α-synuclein, implying the multiple biological functions of DYRK1A (22Galceran J. de Graaf K. Tejedor F.J. Becker W. J. Neural Transm. Suppl. 2003; 67: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Dyrk1A knock-out mice show a general delay in fetal development and are embryonic lethal, indicating the vital and nonredundant biological functions of Dyrk1A (23Fotaki V. Dierssen M. Alcantara S.

We recently generated transgenic mice that overexpress human DYRK1A (DYRK1A TG mice) by introducing a bacterial artificial chromosome that only carries the human DYRK1A genomic DNA, including the endogenous promoter (24Ahn K.J. Jeong H.K. Choi H.S. Ryoo S.R. Kim Y.J. Goo J.S. Choi S.Y. Han J.S. Ha I. Song W.J. Neurobiol. Dis. 2006; 22: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). These DYRK1A TG mice show learning and memory deficits similar to what is seen in DS patients, a finding that is comparable with previous studies on the mouse Dyrk1A cDNA transgenic mice or the human genomic transgenic mice carrying a few chromosome 21 genes, including DYRK1A on a yeast artificial chromosome (24Ahn K.J. Jeong H.K. Choi H.S. Ryoo S.R. Kim Y.J. Goo J.S. Choi S.Y. Han J.S. Ha I. Song W.J. Neurobiol. Dis. 2006; 22: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 25Altafaj X. Dierssen M. Baamonde C.

Previously, it was reported that Dyrk1A phosphorylates Tau at Thr-212 in vitro, a residue that is phosphorylated in fetal Tau and hyperphosphorylated in filamentous Tau from AD brains (27Woods Y.L. Cohen P. Becker W. Jakes R. Goedert M. Wang X. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the physiological significance of this phosphorylation event using transgenic mice that overexpress human DYRK1A (DYRK1A TG mice). It was found that that Tau phosphorylation at Thr-212 is significantly increased in DYRK1A TG mice. Furthermore, Tau protein was also phosphorylated at Ser-202 and Ser-404 residues by Dyrk1A in vitro, and the levels of the phosphorylation at those residues were increased in DYRK1A TG mice. These results indicate that the overexpression of DYRK1A in DS brains may contribute to early onset of AD pathology through the hyperphosphorylation of Tau. Proteins and Antibodies—The full-length mouse Dyrk1A cDNAs (wild-type and Y321F kinase-inactive mutant) were cloned into pET-25b (Novagen), followed by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) codon plus RIL (Stratagene). Using its endogenous 13-histidine repeat, the Dyrk1A protein was purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen). Human recombinant Tau, nonglycosylated and nonphosphorylated form of 441-amino acid Tau splice variant, was obtained from Calbiochem. Bovine tubulin was purchased from Cytoskeleton, and JNK2 was from Upstate. Antibodies for Tau (Tau-5) and phospho-Tau (pS202, pT212, pS404) were obtained from BIOSOURCE. Phosphopeptides and non-phosphopeptides were purchased to perform the peptide competition assay for all three phospho-Tau antibodies (BIOSOURCE). The anti-Dyrk1A antibody was custom-made as described previously (24Ahn K.J. Jeong H.K. Choi H.S. Ryoo S.R. Kim Y.J. Goo J.S. Choi S.Y. Han J.S. Ha I. Song W.J. Neurobiol. Dis. 2006; 22: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry—Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, and perfused transcardially with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) followed by fixative (4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4). The brains were fixed at 4 °C overnight and were cryoprotected. Sagittal sections of mouse brains were prepared as described previously (24Ahn K.J. Jeong H.K. Choi H.S. Ryoo S.R. Kim Y.J. Goo J.S. Choi S.Y. Han J.S. Ha I. Song W.J. Neurobiol. Dis. 2006; 22: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and incubated first with phospho-Tau antibodies (pS202, pT212, and pS404; 1:100 dilution), then with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (1:200 dilution), and finally with avidin biotinylated horseradish peroxidase (Vector Laboratories). After visualization with an SG reagent set (Vector Laboratories), signals were examined with a Zeiss Axioplan microscope using conventional optics. Preparation of Mouse Brain Lysates and Immunoblotting—DYRK1A TG mice that overexpressed the human DYRK1A gene, which was transcribed from the genomic DYRK1A DNA carried on a bacterial artificial chromosome, were produced and maintained as described previously (24Ahn K.J. Jeong H.K. Choi H.S. Ryoo S.R. Kim Y.J. Goo J.S. Choi S.Y. Han J.S. Ha I. Song W.J. Neurobiol. Dis. 2006; 22: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed in accordance with guidelines set forth by the Inje University Council Directive for the proper care and use of laboratory animals. Mouse brain lysates were prepared by homogenization in a tissue grinder (Fisher) in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% deoxycholic acid) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem), 20 μm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The protein concentration was determined using the BCA method (Sigma). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot with phospho-Tau and Tau antibodies. Densitometric quantification of Western blotting signal bands was carried out with a Science Lab 2001 Image Gauge (version 4.0, Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.). In Vitro Tau Phosphorylation—Human recombinant Tau protein (1.1 μg) was incubated for 90 min at 30 °C with the purified Dyrk1A (300 ng) in kinase buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm sodium orthovanadate, and 100 μm ATP; 30-μl reaction volume). The reaction mixtures were separated on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot with Tau and phospho-Tau antibodies. Microtubule Assembly—Tau protein (9.2 μm) was phosphorylated by either no kinase, JNK2 (0.83 μm), or Dyrk1A (0.90 μm) for 2 h as described above. Phosphorylated Tau proteins were subjected to microtubule assembly assay as described previously (28Yoshida H. Hastie C.J. McLauchlan H. Cohen P. Goedert M. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 352-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Briefly, nonphosphorylated or phosphorylated Tau (final concentration, 1.3 μm) was mixed with tubulin (20 μm) in polymerization buffer (80 mm Na-PIPES, pH 6.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA and 1 mm GTP) at 37 °C. Microtubule assembly was initiated by addition of glycerol (final concentration, 5%) and was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 340 nm over 20 min. Plasmids, siRNAs, and HEK293T Cell Transfection—A full-length wild-type Dyrk1A cDNA from a mouse brain and a full-length human Tau cDNA were cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The Y321F kinase-inactive mutant Dyrk1A cDNA was generated by DpnI-mediated site-directed mutagenesis. For siRNA experiment, the mouse Dyrk1A-specific siRNA (5′-GGUAUGAAAUCGACUCCUU) with the TT overhang was designed and synthesized by Samchully Pharm. Co. (South Korea). For siRNA delivery, Dyrk1A-specific duplex siRNA (60 pmol for 6-well plate) was co-transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells (8 × 105 cells/well) with Dyrk1A and Tau plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated GFP-specific siRNA (5′GUUCAGCGUGUCCGGCGAGTT) was used as a nonsilencing control. After 24 h of siRNA treatment, cell lysates were prepared for immunoblot analyses. Immunocytochemistry—COS-7 cells on PDL-coated coverslip (6-well) were transfected with Dyrk1A and Tau plasmids. After 24 h, cells were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and blocked with PBS containing 1% normal goat serum for 2 h. Cells were incubated with the primary antibodies (Dyrk1A, 1:200; Tau, 1:500) at room temperature for 2 h, and then with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit or Cy3 goat anti-mouse-coupled secondary antibodies (1:200) for 1 h. Technical support by examining the images using a confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss LSM 510) was provided by the Korea Basic Science Institute. Co-immunoprecipitation—Brain lysate (1 mg) from the DYRK1A TG mice was incubated with control IgG (R & D Systems), Tau (BIOSOURCE), or Dyrk1A antibody for overnight at 4 °C in RIPA buffer with protease inhibitors and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The next day after a 1-h incubation with protein A beads (Pierce), the beads were gently washed with 1% Triton X-100 in RIPA buffer, and then the bound proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis for the indicated antibodies. Increased Phospho-Thr-212-Tau in DYRK1A TG Mice—To investigate the link between DYRK1A and Tau phosphorylation at the Thr-212 residue in vivo, transgenic mice that overexpress human DYRK1A (DYRK1A TG mice) were analyzed. These DYRK1A TG mice contained two copies of the mouse Dyrk1A gene and one copy of the human DYRK1A genomic DNA, and the human DYRK1A protein expression was tightly controlled by the endogenous promoter. The overexpression of DYRK1A in these mice resulted in approximately a 70% increase in kinase activity. 4Ryoo, S.-R., Cho, H.-J., Lee, H.-W., Jeong, H. K., Radnaabazar, C., Kim, Y.-S., Kim, M.-J., Son, M.-Y., Seo, H., Chung, S.-H., and Song, W.-J., J. Neurochem., in press. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that phospho-Thr-212-Tau (pT212) expression was markedly increased in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of DYRK1A TG mice compared with control littermates (Fig. 1, A and B). The increase in pT212 was observed in the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus and the polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus where DYRK1A overexpression was observed previously (24Ahn K.J. Jeong H.K. Choi H.S. Ryoo S.R. Kim Y.J. Goo J.S. Choi S.Y. Han J.S. Ha I. Song W.J. Neurobiol. Dis. 2006; 22: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The results were corroborated by Western analysis of brain lysates prepared from the hippocampus of DYRK1A TG mice and control littermates (Fig. 1C). After normalization with Tau, the amounts of pT212 in the DYRK1A TG mice were increased by 49 ± 18% (n = 8, p < 0.05), relative to control littermates. The fact that increased phosphorylation of Tau at Thr-212 was evident in both immunohistochemical and immunoblot experiments suggests that overexpression of DYRK1A is functionally linked to Tau phosphorylation in vivo. In Vitro Phosphorylation of Tau at Ser-202 and Ser-404 by Dyrk1A—Previously it was reported that Dyrk1A preferentially phosphorylates substrate proteins at serine and/or threonine residue(s) when proline is present at the +1 position, (S/T)P (20Himpel S. Tegge W. Frank R. Leder S. Joost H.G. Becker W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2431-2438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). An examination of the amino acid sequence of Tau reveals the presence of multiple serine/threonine residues followed by proline. To further explore the role of Dyrk1A in Tau hyperphosphorylation, we examined whether this kinase phosphorylates Tau in vitro at other residues that are implicated in NFT formations in AD, such as Ser-202 and Ser-404 residues (29Augustinack J.C. Schneider A. Mandelkow E.M. Hyman B.T. Acta Neuropathol. 2002; 103: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). The full-length mouse Dyrk1A proteins (wild-type (WT) and Y321F kinase-inactive mutant (YF)) were expressed in E. coli and were purified as ∼90 kDa.4 The recombinant full-length human Tau was incubated in the presence or absence of Dyrk1A, and the reaction mixture was then subjected to immunoblotting analysis. Phosphorylation of Ser-202 and Ser-404 was detected with phospho-Ser-202-Tau (pS202)- and phospho-Ser-404-Tau (pS404)-specific antibodies, respectively. Only in the presence of both Tau and Dyrk1A were the pS202- and pS404-specific antibodies able to detect a protein band that corresponded to Tau on the immunoblotted membrane (Fig. 2A). This result indicates that Dyrk1A can phosphorylate the Ser-202 and Ser-404 residues of Tau directly in vitro. The phosphorylation of Tau by Dyrk1A did not result from any contaminating E. coli kinase activity during Dyrk1A purification, as the Tau protein was phosphorylated only by the WT Dyrk1A and not by the Y321F mutant (Fig. 2B). The Y321F mutant Dyrk1A showed slightly faster mobility on the SDS-PAGE, because of mutation of the Tyr-321 residue, the autophosphorylation site required for kinase activation (Fig. 2B and Fig. 4A). When the WT and Y321F proteins were treated with λ phosphatase for dephosphorylation, they showed the same mobility (data not shown).FIGURE 4Tau phosphorylation by Dyrk1A in mammalian cells. A, HEK293T cells were transfected with indicated plasmid(s) or a control pcDNA3.1. After 24 h, cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblot analyses for the indicated phospho-Tau, Tau, and Dyrk1A. B, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with human Tau, mouse Dyrk1A, and Dyrk1A-specific siRNAs. The level of Dyrk1A, phospho-Tau, and Tau were examined by immunoblot analyses. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated GFP-specific siRNA was used as a nonsilencing siRNA control (Con). C, peptide competition assay for phospho-Tau antibodies. Mouse hippocampal lysates were analyzed by Western blotting with indicated phospho-specific Tau antibodies preincubated in the absence (N) or presence of non-phosphopeptides (NP), phosphopeptides (P), or unrelated phosphopeptides (UP). The pS404 phosphopeptide was used as an unrelated phosphopeptide control for the pS202 antibody competition assay and vice versa. The pS202 phosphopeptide was used as an unrelated phosphopeptide control for the pT212 antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Inhibition of Microtubule Assembly by Dyrk1A-mediated Tau Phosphorylation—It is known that hyperphosphorylated Tau inhibits microtubule assembly, whereas normal Tau stimulates assembly and stabilizes the microtubule. We examined the extent to which Tau phosphorylation by Dyrk1A affects the ability of Tau in promoting microtubule assembly. Phosphorylation of Tau by Dyrk1A strongly inhibited microtubule assembly (Fig. 3). After incubation for 20 min, assembly of the samples incubated with Tau phosphorylated by Dyrk1A was inhibited by 80 ± 7% (n = 4, p < 0.01) when compared with that of control (no kinase). The extent of Dyrk1A-mediated inhibition was comparable with that of JNK2, a known Tau kinase that phosphorylates several Tau residues (28Yoshida H. Hastie C.J. McLauchlan H. Cohen P. Goedert M. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 352-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The strong inhibition of the microtubule assembly in the presence of Dyrk1A supports that Dyrk1A potentially phosphorylates multiple residues in Tau. Tau Phosphorylation by the Dyrk1A in Mammalian Cells—To determine whether Dyrk1A phosphorylates full-length Tau on Ser-202, Ser-404, and Thr-212 in vivo, a Western analysis was performed with lysates of human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells that had been transiently transfected with a full-length Tau expression plasmid, either in the presence or absence of a plasmid encoding mouse Dyrk1A (WT or Y321F). Although the amounts of Tau were similar, the amounts of pS202, pT212, and pS404 were strongly increased in cells expressing Dyrk1A WT, but not Dyrk1A Y321F (Fig. 4A), indicating that full-length Tau is phosphorylated by Dyrk1A in cells. The Ser-202, Thr-212, and Ser-404 of Tau were weakly phosphorylated in the absence of exogenous mouse Dyrk1A, potentially on account of the presence of endogenous Dyrk1A and other Tau-phosphorylating kinases, including JNK (28Yoshida H. Hastie C.J. McLauchlan H. Cohen P. Goedert M. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 352-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Y321F mutant, a dominant negative kinase-inactive mutant of Dyrk1A, may inhibit kinase activity of Dyrk1A by competing with endogenous Dyrk1A in HEK293T cells, resulting in further inhibition of Dyrk1A-mediated Tau phosphorylation, compared with that of Tau-transfected control (Fig. 4A). To confirm the above finding, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with Dyrk1A siRNA along with plasmids encoding the full-length mouse Dyrk1A and human Tau. A nonsilencing fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated GFP-specific siRNA was used as a negative control. After 24 h of treatment, Dyrk1A siRNA strongly inhibited expression of Dyrk1A. Correspondingly, the levels of pS202, pT212, and pS404 were also reduced, whereas Dyrk1A siRNA did not affect Tau expression (Fig. 4B). This result supports that Dyrk1A phosphorylates Tau on Ser-202, Thr-212, and Ser-404 in vivo. Specificity of each phospho-specific antibody was demonstrated by the peptide competition assay. Fig. 4C showed that the specific band signal in an immunoblot of mouse brain lysate was blocked only when the membrane was preincubated with the corresponding phosphopeptide, but not with the non-phosphopeptide or the unrelated phosphopeptide. Increase in the Amounts of Phos-pho-Ser-202 and Phospho-Ser-404 in the Hippocampus and Frontal Cortex of DYRK1A TG Mice—To determine the physiological significance of Tau phosphorylation at the Ser-202 and Ser-404 residues, DYRK1A TG mice were analyzed with immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that pS202 and pS404 were increased in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of DYRK1A TG mice relative to control littermates (Fig. 5). Strong immunohistochemical signals were observed in the neuronal cell bodies of the hippocampus or apical dendrites of the frontal cortex in DYRK1A TG mice relative to those of control mice. Increases in pS202, pT212, and pS404 were also observed in scattered neurons in the hippocampus and axonal tract in the corpus callosum of DYRK1A TG mice (Fig. 1A and Fig. 5). The results were corroborated by Western analysis of brain lysates prepared from the hippocampus or frontal cortex of DYRK1A TG mice and control littermates. Immunoblot analyses showed that after normalization with Tau, the amounts of pS202 and pS404 in the hippocampal lysates of DYRK1A TG mice were increased by 26 ± 9% (n = 11, p < 0.01) and 29 ± 7% (n = 9, p < 0.05) relative to that of control littermates, respectively (Fig. 6A). In addition, after normalization with Tau, the amounts of pS202 and pS404 in the frontal cortex of DYRK1A TG mice were also increased by 32 ± 4% (n = 3, p < 0.05) and 74 ± 6% (n = 3, p < 0.01) relative to that of control littermates, respectively (Fig. 6B). Taken together, these results demonstrate that phosphorylation of Tau at Ser-202 and Ser-404 is enhanced when the amount of DYRK1A is increased suggesting that overexpression of DYRK1A is functionally linked to Tau hyperphosphorylation in vivo. Interaction of Dyrk1A with Tau—To determine whether Tau is phosphorylated through the physical interaction with Dyrk1A, the brain lysates of DYRK1A TG mice were immunoprecipitated with anti-Tau-antibody. As shown in Fig. 6C, immunoprecipitation of Tau led to co-immunoprecipit"
https://openalex.org/W2054324003,"A major goal of developing high-precision control of many-body quantum systems is to realize their potential as quantum computers. A substantial obstacle to this is the extreme fragility of quantum systems to “decoherence” from environmental noise and other control limitations. Although quantum computation is possible if the noise affecting the quantum system satisfies certain conditions, existing methods for noise characterization are intractable for present multibody systems. We introduce a technique based on symmetrization that enables direct experimental measurement of some key properties of the decoherence affecting a quantum system. Our method reduces the number of experiments required from exponential to polynomial in the number of subsystems. The technique is demonstrated for the optimization of control over nuclear spins in the solid state."

https://openalex.org/W2049960163,"STIM1 and CRACM1 (or Orai1) are essential molecular components mediating store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) and Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) currents. Although STIM1 acts as a luminal Ca2+ sensor in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the function of STIM2 remains unclear. Here we reveal that STIM2 has two distinct modes of activating CRAC channels: a store-operated mode that is activated through depletion of ER Ca2+ stores by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and store-independent activation that is mediated by cell dialysis during whole-cell perfusion. Both modes are regulated by calmodulin (CaM). The store-operated mode is transient in intact cells, possibly reflecting recruitment of CaM, whereas loss of CaM in perfused cells accounts for the persistence of the store-independent mode. The inhibition by CaM can be reversed by 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), resulting in rapid, store-independent activation of CRAC channels. The aminoglycoside antibiotic G418 is a highly specific and potent inhibitor of STIM2-dependent CRAC channel activation. The results reveal a novel bimodal control of CRAC channels by STIM2, the store dependence and CaM regulation, which indicates that the STIM2/CRACM1 complex may be under the control of both luminal and cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels."
https://openalex.org/W2089890557,"Insect-specific baculoviruses are increasingly used as biological control agents of lepidopteran pests in agriculture and forestry, and they have been previously regarded as robust to resistance development by the insects. However, in more than a dozen cases of field resistance of the codling moth Cydia pomonella to commercially applied C. pomonella granulovirus (CpGV) in German orchards, resistance ratios exceed 1000. The rapid emergence of resistance is facilitated by sex-linkage and concentration-dependent dominance of the major resistance gene and genetic uniformity of the virus. When the gene is fixed, resistance levels approach 100,000-fold. Our findings highlight the need for development of resistance management strategies for baculoviruses."
https://openalex.org/W2080903787,"A major role for c-Myc in the proliferation of normal cells is attributed to its ability to promote progression through G(1) and into S phase of the cell cycle. The absolute requirement of c-Myc for cell cycle progression in human tumor cells has not been comprehensively addressed. In the present work, we used a lentiviral-based short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression vector to stably reduce c-Myc expression in a large number of human tumor cell lines and in three different types of normal human cells. In all cases, cell proliferation was severely inhibited, with normal cells ultimately undergoing G(0)/G(1) growth arrest. In contrast, tumor cells demonstrated a much more variable cell cycle response with cells from several lines accumulating in S or G(2)/M phases. Moreover, in some tumor lines, the phase of cell cycle arrest caused by inhibition of c-Myc could be altered by depleting tumor suppressor protein p53 or its transcriptional target p21(CIP/WAF). Our data suggest that, as in the case of normal cells, c-Myc is essential for sustaining proliferation of human tumor cells. However its rate-limiting role in cell cycle control is variable and is reliant upon the status of other cell cycle regulators."
https://openalex.org/W2091255007,"Attention can selectively enhance neuronal responses and exclude external noise, but the neuronal computations that underlie these effects remain unknown. At the neuronal level, noise exclusion might result in altered spatial integration properties. We tested this proposal by recording neuronal activity and length tuning in neurons of the primary visual cortex of the macaque when attention was directed toward or away from stimuli presented in each neuron's classical receptive field. For cells with central-parafoveal receptive fields, attention reduced spatial integration, as demonstrated by a reduction in preferred stimulus length and in the size of the spatial summation area. Conversely, in cells that represented more peripheral locations, attention increased spatial integration by increasing the cell's summation area. This previously unknown dichotomy between central and peripheral vision could support accurate analysis of attended foveal objects and target selection for impending eye movements to peripheral objects."
https://openalex.org/W2087394084,"N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) activation and downstream signaling are important for neuronal function. Activation of prosurvival Src family kinases and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 is initiated by NMDAR activation, but the cellular organization of these kinases in relation to NMDARs is not entirely clear. We hypothesized that caveolin-1 scaffolds and coordinates protein complexes involved in NMDAR signaling and that this organization is necessary for neuronal preconditioning, whereby NMDAR activation protects neurons from subsequent ischemic cell death. We found that sublethal ischemia (SLI) or preconditioning via NMDA treatment of primary cortical neurons from neonatal rats or mice increases expression of phosphorylated (P) caveolin-1, P-Src, and P-ERK1/2. The NMDAR antagonist, MK801, or the Src inhibitor, PP2, attenuated SLI-induced preconditioning. NMDAR2B distributed to buoyant fractions and heavy fractions, partially colocalized with caveolin-1 and the membrane raft marker, cholera toxin B. Cultures of primary neurons treated with caveolin-1 small interfering RNA or from caveolin-1(-/-) mice lacked the NMDA-mediated increase in P-Src and P-ERK, as well as SLI- and NMDA-induced preconditioning. Adenovirally mediated expression of caveolin-1 in neurons from caveolin-1(-/-) mice restored NMDA-mediated enhancement of P-Src and P-ERK1/2, redistributed NMDAR2B to buoyant fractions, and enhanced NMDAR2B localization to membrane rafts. We conclude that caveolin-1, perhaps via its ability to scaffold key signaling components, is essential for NMDAR localization to neuronal membrane rafts, NMDAR/Src tyrosine kinase family/ERK signaling, and protection of neurons from ischemic injury and cell death."

Thus, the hippocampus is necessary for modifying learning in males and females after acute stressful experience."

Our objective was to identify these enzymes, as ppo gene replacements show critical developmental aberrancies in sporulation and pathogenicity in the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus and the genetic model Aspergillus nidulans. The PpoAs of A. fumigatus and A. nidulans were identified as (8R)-dioxygenases with hydroperoxide isomerase activity, designated 5,8-LDS. 5,8-LDS transformed 18:2n-6 to (8R)-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid ((8R)-HPODE) and (5S,8R)-dihydroxy-9Z,12Z-octadecadienoic acid ((5S,8R)-DiHODE). We also detected 8,11-LDS in A. fumigatus and (10R)-dioxygenases in both Aspergilli. The diol synthases oxidized [(8R)-2H]18:2n-6 to (8R)-HPODE with retention of the deuterium label, suggesting antarafacial hydrogen abstraction and insertion of molecular oxygen. Experiments with stereospecifically deuterated 18:2n-6 showed that (8R)-HPODE was isomerized by 5,8- and 8,11-LDS to (5S,8R)-DiHODE and to (8R,11S)-dihydroxy-9Z,12Z-octadecadienoic acid, respectively, by suprafacial hydrogen abstraction and oxygen insertion at C-5 and C-11. PpoCs were identified as (10R)-dioxygenases, which catalyzed abstraction of the pro-S hydrogen at C-8 of 18:2n-6, double bond migration, and antafacial insertion of molecular oxygen with formation of (10R)-hydroxy-8E,12Z-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid ((10R)-HPODE). Deletion of ppoA led to prominent reduction of (8R)-H(P)ODE and complete loss of (5S,8R)-DiHODE biosynthesis, whereas biosynthesis of (10R)-HPODE was unaffected. Deletion of ppoC caused biosynthesis of traces of racemic 10-HODE but did not affect the biosynthesis of other oxylipins. We conclude that ppoA of Aspergillus sp. may code for 5,8-LDS with catalytic similarities to 7,8-LDS and ppoC for linoleate (10R)-dioxygenases.

Keller and co-workers found with the aid of the 7,8-LDS sequence that both genomes contained three genes (ppoA, ppoB, and ppoC), which coded for putative fatty acid oxygenases of the MPO family with about 40% amino acid identity with 7,8-LDS (22Tsitsigiannis D.I.

In addition to the impact on the sporulation process, deletion of these genes also led to alterations in virulence on host seed (20Tsitsigiannis D.I. Keller N.P. Mol.

Open table in a new tab Studies of recombinant 7,8-LDS suggested that (5S,8R)-DiHODE could be formed by an enzyme of A. nidulans with a closely related oxygenation mechanism (26Coffa G. Schneider C. Brash A.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). 7,8-LDS expressed in insect cells had similar properties as the native enzyme. 7,8-LDS expressed in Pichia pastoris oxygenated 18:2n-6 to (8R)-HPODE and (5,8R)-DiHODE and transformed exogenous (8R)-HPODE to (5,8R)-DiHODE (26Coffa G. Schneider C. Brash A.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Mycelia and cell-free preparations of A. nidulans were found to oxidize 18:2n-6 to (8R)-HPODE and (5S,8R)-DiHODE and transformed (8R)-HPODE to (5S,8R)-DiHODE. In addition, (10R)-HODE was formed as a major metabolite under certain conditions (26Coffa G. Schneider C. Brash A.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 29Garscha U. Oliw E.H. Anal. Biochem. 2007; 367: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Fungi have been known to produce 10-HODE with R or S absolute configuration. The shiitake mushroom, Lentinula edodes, and the field mushroom form (10S)-HPODE, which can be transformed to an aroma compound, 1-octen-3-ol, or reduced to (10S)-HODE (30Wurzenberger M. Grosch W.

Tetrahedron Lett. 1987; 28: 73-76Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and this stereoisomer also predominates in G. graminis and A. nidulans (26Coffa G. Schneider C. Brash A.R. Biochem. Biophys.

The corresponding (10R)-hydroperoxide has not been identified, and little is known about the mechanism of biosynthesis of (10R)-HODE. The first aim of the present study was to examine the biosynthesis of oxylipins from 18:2n-6 by the human pathogen A. fumigatus. We next extended these studies to A. nidulans, as this has traditionally been used as a model organism (4Champe S.P. el-Zayat A.A. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3982-3988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that both species transformed 18:2n-6 to (8R)-HPODE/(8R)-HODE, (5S,8R)-DiHODE, and (10R)-HPODE/(10R)-HODE. In addition, (8R,11S)-DiHODE was formed by A. fumigatus. The second aim was to determine the mechanism of biosynthesis of the Aspergillus metabolites and their relation to (8R)-HPODE. The third goal was to determine the stereochemical relation between hydrogen abstraction and oxygenation using stereospecifically deuterated 18:2n-6 at C-5, C-8, and C-11. These studies were consistent with expression of two enzymes, 5,8-LDS and (10R)-DOX, in A. nidulans and A. fumigatus, and a third enzyme, 8,11-LDS, in A. fumigatus. Our final goal was to link each of the genes to each of these enzymes by gene targeting. We report that ppoA likely codes for 5,8-LDS and ppoC for (10R)-DOX. The corresponding genes appear to occur in virtually all Aspergillus sp. sequenced so far. 18:1n-9 (99%), 18:2n-6 (99%), 18:3n-3 (99%), 18:3n-6 (99%), and imidazole were from Merck. 18:2n-6 (94–96%) was from Carl Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany).

The crystal structure of the cytoplasmic mitoNEET (residues 33–108) is determined in this study. The structure presents a novel protein fold and contains a [2Fe-2S] cluster-binding domain. The [2Fe-2S] cluster is coordinated to the protein by Cys-72, Cys-74, Cys-83, and His-87 residues. This coordination is also novel compared with the traditional [2Fe-2S] cluster coordinated by four cysteines or two cysteines and two histidines. The cytoplasmic mitoNEET forms homodimers in solution and in crystal. The dimerization is mainly mediated by hydrophobic interactions as well as hydrogen bonds coordinated by two water molecules binding at the interface. His-87 residue, which plays an important role in the coordination of the [2Fe-2S] cluster, is exposed to the solvent on the dimer surface. It is proposed that mitoNEET dimer may interact with other proteins via the surface residues in close proximity to the [2Fe-2S] cluster.

Interestingly, pioglitazone was recently reported to have negative regulatory effect on complex I activity in muscle, liver, and astroglioma cells (6Brunmair B. Staniek K. Gras F. Scharf N.

This correlation and the mitochondrial localization of mitoNEET suggest that pioglitazone may exert its action on mitochondria by regulating the activities of respiratory complexes via its interaction with mitoNEET. Type II diabetes is a complex metabolic disease characterized by insulin resistance in the initial stage. The disease and the associated complications have become prevailing public health concerns; thus it is significant to determine the mechanisms by which the anti-diabetes drug pioglitazone functions as an insulin sensitizer. Moreover, it was recently reported that rosiglitazone, another Type II diabetes drug in the thiazolidinedione family that has similar binding affinity to mitoNEET, may increase the risk of myocardial infarction (9Home P.D.

Therefore, the structural studies of mitoNEET, which is a potential target of pioglitazone and the TZDs, are highly significant for diabetes and other human diseases. Here we report the crystal structure at 1.8 Å resolution of the cytoplasmic portion of human mitoNEET (from residues 33–108, referred as mitoNEET33–108). The structure of mitoNEET33–108 represents a new overall fold and contains a novel Cys3–His1 coordinated [2Fe-2S] cluster. The structure reveals a homodimer of mitoNEET33–108 with strong hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bond network at the dimeric interface. The data suggest that it is highly likely that mitoNEET forms a dimer on the outer membrane of mitochondria. Protein Expression and Purification—The gene of human mitoNEE33–108 was amplified by PCR and cloned to the pMCSG9 vector using the ligation-independent cloning technology (17Donnelly M.I. Zhou M. Millard C.S. Clancy S. Stols L. Eschenfeldt W.H. Collart F.R. Joachimiak A. Protein Expression Purif. 2006; 47: 446-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). His-maltose binding protein-tagged protein was produced in the Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) strains. Cells were grown at 37 °C in 3.2 liters of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. When A600 reached 0.6, the cells were induced at 16 °C for 20 h by adding 0.35 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. Then the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 30 min. The pellets were resuspended and sonicated in 60 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl). After centrifugation at 16,000 rpm for 30 min, the supernatant was loaded onto a Ni2+-affinity column equilibrated with the lysis buffer. The column was washed sequentially by 20 column volumes of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm imidazole), and 10 column volumes of washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 40 mm imidazole), and then the protein was eluted with elution buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 400 mm imidazole). The eluted solution was cleaved overnight with tobacco etch virus protease at 4 °C, which yields untagged mitoNEET33–108 with three residues (Ser-Asn-Ala) at the N terminus. The untagged mitoNEET33–108 was further purified by ion-exchange chromatography on a 5-ml HiTrap SP FF ion-exchange column. Fractions containing mitoNEET33–108 were desalted and concentrated to ∼10 mg/ml in the concentration buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and stored at –20 °C. When being tentatively purified for the first time, the eluted solution after tobacco etch virus protease cleavage was subjected to the size exclusion chromatography before the ion-exchange chromatography, and the retention time suggested that mitoNEET33–108 protein existed in solution as a dimer. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals were obtained at 289 K using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. Each hanging drop is a 1:1 mixture of protein and reservoir solution. The crystal used for the single anomalous dispersion (SAD) experiment was grown in the reservoir solution containing 2.0 m NaCl and 0.1 m MES, pH 5.5, and the crystal used for the high resolution measurement was grown in the solution containing 2.0 m NaCl and 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0. The SAD data set with high redundancy was collected at 100 K on a Rigaku R-AXIS IV++ imaging-plate system with a Rigaku FRE copper rotating-anode generator in Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The data were processed with HKL2000 (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). The high resolution data set was collected at beamline 19ID of the Structural Biology Center at the Advanced Photon Source in the Argonne National Laboratory with the ADSC315 CCD detector and were processed with HKL3000 (19Minor W.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination—The crystal structure of human mitoNEET33–108 was solved by the SAD method using the anomalous signal of iron atoms. Heavy atom positions were located by SHLXD (20Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). Heavy atom refinement, phasing, and density flattening were performed by autoSHARP (21Vonrhein C. Blanc E. Roversi P. Bricogne G. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 215-230Google Scholar). The initial model was automatically built by ARP/wARP (22Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar), manually modified with Coot (23Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23226) Google Scholar), and refined with Refmac5 (24Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13854) Google Scholar). The [2Fe-2S] cluster and water molecules were built in according to the Fo – Fc map at the very late stage of refinement. The stereochemical quality of the final model was evaluated by Procheck (25Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Structure determination and refinement statistics are listed in Table 1. Overall Structure—The final model refined to 1.8Å resolution consists of 76 amino acids (Arg-33–Lys-105 of mitoNEET and Ser-Asn-Ala at the N terminus resulting from the vector), one [2Fe-2S] cluster, one chloride ion, and 125 water molecules. Lys-105 was modeled as alanine, and three C-terminal residues (Lys-106, Glu-107, and Thr-108) were not able to be modeled due to the weak electron density. The [2Fe-2S] cluster and chloride ion are identified based on the anomalous difference Fourier map using SAD phases. The 2Fo – Fc and difference Fourier map around the [2Fe-2S] cluster and the chloride ion are shown in Fig. 1A. The model is well refined, and all the crystallographic data statistics are shown in Table 1. The structure contains a long loop from Arg-33 to Lys-55 in the N-terminal part and a β-β-α-β topology for the rest of the protein (Fig. 1, B and C). A [2Fe-2S] cluster is bound in the loop between β2 and α1 and is flanked by the helix α1 and the two-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet (β2β3). The β1 strand is away from the cluster-binding domain (residues from β2 to β3) and interacts with the cluster-binding domain mainly by hydrophobic residues such as Ile-56, Phe-60, Ala-69, Tyr-71, Phe-80, and Phe-82. A structural homology search in the PDB with the program Dali gives two results with the Z-score of 0.5 and 0.4, respectively, indicating that the mitoNEET33–108 structure represents a new fold. The secondary structure features are shown in Fig. 1C. In addition, we found two human CDGSH domain-containing proteins (accession numbers A6NMV4 and Q8N5K1) using protein sequence similarity search (blastp on ExPASy against UniProt Knowledgebase). The subcellular localization of Q8N5K1 (named as “Miner 1”) was reported (1Wiley S.E. Murphy A.N. Ross S.A. van der Geer P. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 5318-5323Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), but the structure and function of these two proteins are unknown to date. Based on the sequence similarity, we predict that these two proteins are likely to fold similarly as mitoNEET, and the sequence alignment is shown in Fig. 1C. In particular, A6NMV4 is a new homolog that has not been reported previously. A6NMV4 has the identical length as mitoNEET and 87% sequence identity with mitoNEET. It remains to be determined whether the new homolog A6NMV4 is a unique protein expressed in human tissues. Its structure and function also need to be elucidated. [2Fe-2S] Cluster-binding Domain—The [2Fe-2S] cluster is coordinated by Cys-72, Cys-74, and Cys-83 from the loop between β2 and α1 and by His-87 from the start point of α1 (Fig. 1, B and C). [2Fe-2S] clusters deposited in the PDB heretofore can be classified into two types: four-cysteine coordinated clusters and Rieske clusters with two cysteines and two histidines (Fig. 1D). The structure of a [2Fe-2S] cluster coordinated with Cys3–His1 as found in this study of mitoNEET is the first time that this novel structure of [2Fe-2S] cluster is demonstrated in crystal structure. Except the coordination residues, the [2Fe-2S] cluster itself is identical to the classical [2Fe-2S] clusters; the two irons and the inorganic sulfurs are in a plane, and the irons are tetrahedrally coordinated (Fig. 1D). The cluster-binding domain of mitoNEET was proposed as a CDGSH-type zinc finger domain based on the sequence information. With the three-dimensional structural determination in this study, we proposed to rename this domain as the third class of [2Fe-2S] cluster-binding domain. In comparison with the consensus motif Cys-X4-Cys-X2-Cys-X≈30-Cys for Cys4 coordinated [2Fe-2S] clusters in ferredoxins (26Lill R. Dutkiewicz R. Elsasser H.P. Hausmann A. Netz D.J. Pierik A.J. Stehling O. Urzica E. Muhlenhoff U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 652-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and Cys-X-His-X15–17-Cys-X2-His for Cys2–His2 coordinated Rieske [2Fe-2S] cluster (27Tsoi T.V. Plotnikova E.G. Cole J.R. Guerin W.F. Bagdasarian M. Tiedje J.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 2151-2162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the coordinated residues in mitoNEET present an arrangement of Cys-X-Cys-X8-Cys-X3-His, which results in the unique feature of the [2Fe-2S] cluster-binding domain. These coordinated residues are so close to one another that the loop between β2 and α1 rolls up around the [2Fe-2S] cluster in the cluster-binding domain (Fig. 1B). In the open side of the loop, the coordinated residues Cys-83 and His-87 are partially exposed to the polar surroundings, where two water molecules interact respectively with the main-chain oxygen of Cys-83 and the ϵ2 nitrogen of His-87 by hydrogen bonds. The crystal structure of the [2Fe-2S] cluster is also supported by a recent mitoNEET spectroscopic study that presented spectroscopic evidence suggesting a [2Fe-2S] cluster slightly different from the traditional ones found in ferredoxins and Rieske protein (28Wiley S.E. Paddock M.L. Abresch E.C. Gross L. van der Geer P. Nechushtai R. Murphy A.N. Jennings P.A. Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

Munck E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 124-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The same study also showed that the [2Fe-2S] cluster coordination to mitoNEET is pH-dependent (28Wiley S.E. Paddock M.L. Abresch E.C. Gross L. van der Geer P. Nechushtai R. Murphy A.N. Jennings P.A. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23745-23749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Our crystal structure of mitoNEET33–108 dimer shows that the side chain of His-87 is exposed to solvent and is adjacent to the basic residue Lys-55 from the other monomer (see the discussion on the dimeric structure). Because of the pH dependence of the protonation status of the imidazole ring in histidine and the close proximity of His-87 to a basic residue, our study provides detailed structural support for the reported pH-dependent spectroscopic features. The Dimeric Structure of mitoNEET—The crystal structure also reveals a homodimer of mitoNEET33–108, which is consistent with the retention time on the size exclusion chromatography during protein purification. There is one molecule in an asymmetric unit. A homodimer is formed by the crystallographic 2-fold axis c (Fig. 2A). Approximately 58% of the hydrophobic residues in mitoNEET33–108 exist in the dimer interface, and the dimerization buries 30% of the total surface area in each monomer. The N-terminal β1 strand forms a parallel β sheet with β3 coming from the other monomer. Consequently, two symmetric three-stranded β-sheets are formed face-to-face in the dimer (Fig. 2A). Residues such as Val-56 and Val-57 from β1, Leu-65 from the loop between β1 and β2, Tyr-71 from β2, Trp-75 from the loop betweenβ2 and α1, as well as Leu-101 and Ile-103 from β3 provide a number of hydrophobic interactions between the monomers (Fig. 2B). Therefore, the dimerization should be very tight and could be necessary for mitoNEET functions. We propose that mitoNEET exists as a dimer under the physiological conditions. Interestingly, although the dimer interface is mainly hydrophobic, two water molecules are symmetrically buried in the hydrophobic core of the dimer interface. These water molecules link the two monomers by hydrogen bonds with the side chain of Arg-73 and the main-chain oxygen atoms of Pro-81 and cluster-coordinated Cys-72 from the other monomer (Fig. 2C). Interfacial water molecules can enhance the stability of protein-protein interactions (30Levy Y. Onuchic J.N. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2006; 35: 389-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the structure of mitoNEET33–108 dimer, the two interfacial water molecules make the basic Arg-73 well accommodated to the hydrophobic interface. They also stabilize the two monomers by intermonomer hydrogen bonds. In addition, it is reported that interfacial waters adjacent to redox centers influence their intermolecular electron-transfer reaction (31Lin J. Balabin I.A. Beratan D.N. Science. 2005; 310: 1311-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In the structure of mitoNEET33–108 dimer, the distance of the two clusters is ∼14 Å, which is a reasonable distance for potential electron transfer between the two clusters, although the intersubunit electron transfer has not been experimentally tested yet. The structural feature, however, is consistent with the proposed role of mitoNEET in regulating electron transfer reactions in mitochondria (1Wiley S.E. Murphy A.N. Ross S.A. van der Geer P. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 5318-5323Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Given the special role of Arg-73 in the dimeric interface, we propose that this residue is critical to the structure and function of mitoNEET. We are currently testing this hypothesis by substituting Arg-73 to other residues. We also solved a mitoNEET33–108 structure with a crystal in another space group (p212121, 3.0 Å resolution, data not shown), in which the same dimer was observed, although the dimer was formed by the non-crystallographic 2-fold symmetry in one asymmetric unit. This structure provides additional support for the observed mitoNEET dimer as representing the physiological dimer. The N-terminal 32 residues are reported to direct mitoNEET to the outer mitochondrial membrane (1Wiley S.E. Murphy A.N. Ross S.A. van der Geer P. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 5318-5323Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Using GlobPlot (32Linding R. Russell R.B. Neduva V. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3701-3708Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar), residues from Trp-13 to Tyr-35 are predicted to constitute a transmembrane domain. In our mitoNEET33–108 structure, residues from Ser-33 to Ala-43 are away from the dimerized core. In the dimer, the N terminus of the two monomers extends to the same direction (Fig. 2A). It is reasonable to propose that this dimer would exist on the mitochondrial surface with the two N-terminal transmembrane domains inserted into the outer membrane in vivo. The electrostatic surface potential of the dimer is shown in Fig. 2D. As discussed earlier, the His-87 residue that is critical to the [2Fe-2S] cluster binding resides in a basic patch on the protein surface. The basic patches on both sides of the dimer may provide a site for interacting with other proteins and small molecules such as pioglitazone. Since the basic patch is in close proximity to the [2Fe-2S] cluster, the binding properties and redox potential of the [2Fe-2S] cluster would be influenced by the proteins and small molecules that can potentially interact with the basic patches. This study provides critical insights into the structure of mitoNEET and its potential function on the mitochondrial outer membrane. Based on the structure of mitoNEET33–108 in this study, it is likely that the binding of pioglitazone or rosiglitazone would significantly change the Fe-S cluster binding and dimeric structure of mitoNEET as well as its function in mitochondria. The structural basis of the interaction between mitoNEET and pioglitazone as well as other TZD compounds is currently under investigation.

They are composed of a transmembrane domain of six putative transmembrane segments flanked by large N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic domains. The melastatin subfamily (TRPM) channels have N-terminal domains of ∼700 amino acids with four regions of shared homology and C-terminal domains containing the conserved TRP domain followed by a coiled-coil region. Here we investigated the effects of N- and C-terminal deletions on the cold and menthol receptor, TRPM8, expressed heterologously in Sf21 insect cells. Patch-clamp electrophysiology was used to study channel activity and revealed that only deletion of the first 39 amino acids was tolerated by the channel. Further N-terminal truncation or any C-terminal deletions prevented proper TRPM8 function. Confocal microscopy with immunofluorescence revealed that amino acids 40–86 are required for localization to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, analysis of deletion mutant oligomerization shows that the transmembrane domain is sufficient for TPRM8 assembly into tetramers. TRPM8 channels with C-terminal deletions tetramerize and localize properly but are inactive, indicating that although not essential for tetramerization and localization, the C terminus is critical for proper function of the channel sensor and/or gate.

Shared homology in these N- and C-terminal regions is what defines the different TRP subfamilies. The transmembrane region is predicted to form tetrameric channels and share a similar fold to voltage-dependent K+ channels (4Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Ruta V. Cadene M. Chait B.T. Mackinnon R. Nature. 2003; 423: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar, 5Long S.B. Campbell E.B. Mackinnon R. Science. 2005; 309: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1826) Google Scholar). Most TRP channels also have a short hydrophobic “TRP domain” sequence shortly after the last transmembrane segment (1Montell C. Sci. STKE. 2005; 2005: 1-24Google Scholar, 6Montell C. Sci. STKE. 2001; 2001: 1-17Google Scholar). Unlike the TRPC and TRPV channels, which contain between three and six ankyrin repeats in their N-terminal cytoplasmic domains, TRPM8 and the seven other TRPM channels share four regions of high homology (TRPM homology regions, MHRs) in their N-terminal cytoplasmic domain (3Clapham D.E. Nature. 2003; 426: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (2109) Google Scholar, 7Fleig A. Penner R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 633-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The TRPMs also have a coiled-coil region just C-terminal to the TRP domain (7Fleig A. Penner R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 633-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). TRPM proteins are involved in a broad range of biological processes, such as responses to oxidative stress (TRPM2), T-cell activation (TRPM4), taste (TRPM5), magnesium homeostasis (TRPM6 and TRPM7), and temperature sensation (TRPM8) (8Harteneck C. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2005; 371: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 9Kraft R. Harteneck C. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2005; 451: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar).TRPM8 is activated by “cool” temperatures (8–25 °C) and “cooling” agents such as menthol, eucalyptol, and icilin (10McKemy D.D. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D. Nature. 2002; 416: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1938) Google Scholar, 11Peier A.M. Moqrich A. Hergarden A.C. Reeve A.J. Andersson D.A. Story G.M. Earley T.J. Dragoni I.

Stucky C.L. Jordt S.E. Julius D. Nature. 2007; 448: 204-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). The depolarization of sensory neurons expressing TRPM8 is a result of Na+ influx through the channel because of the much higher extracellular concentration of Na+ versus Ca2+ and the low selectivity of TRPM8 (PCa/Na = 3.2) (10McKemy D.D. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D. Nature. 2002; 416: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1938) Google Scholar, 15Reid G. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2005; 451: 250-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The TRPM8 temperature response is mediated at least in part by its C-terminal intracellular domain: chimeras swapping the C-terminal domains of TRPM8 and TPRV1 (i.e. the vanilloid family TRP channel activated by temperatures >42 °C (16Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (6943) Google Scholar)) switch their thermal sensitivity (17Brauchi S. Orta G. Salazar M. Rosenmann E. Latorre R. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 4835-4840Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). These chimeras retained their wild-type chemical agonist sensitivity.TRPM8 gating is not regulated by temperature alone. Voltage and pH interact allosterically with temperature to activate the channel (18Voets T. Droogmans G. Wissenbach U. Janssens A. Flockerzi V. Nilius B. Nature. 2004; 430: 748-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar, 19Brauchi S. Orio P. Latorre R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15494-15499Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 20Hui K. Guo Y. Feng Z.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333: 374-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). TRPM8 and other TRP channels are voltage-dependent and can be activated upon depolarization. In fact, cooling and ligand binding lead to TRPM8 channel opening by shifting of the activation voltage into the physiologic range (18Voets T. Droogmans G. Wissenbach U. Janssens A. Flockerzi V. Nilius B. Nature. 2004; 430: 748-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis indicates that the voltage sensor is in the S4 and S4–S5 linker, and mutation of residues involved in voltage sensation also alters the temperature and agonist sensitivity (21Voets T. Owsianik G. Janssens A. Talavera K. Nilius B. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The two best characterized chemical agonists of TRPM8, icilin and menthol, activate the channel through distinct mechanisms. Activation by icilin is inhibited by low pH and by the absence of intracellular Ca2+. On the other hand, menthol activation is unaffected by pH and is inhibited by the presence of intracellular Ca2+ (22Chuang H.H. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D. Neuron. 2004; 43: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 23Andersson D.A. Chase H.W. Bevan S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5364-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Mutational analyses indicate that residues in the S1 and S2 transmembrane segments are required for TRPM8 activation by menthol and icilin (22Chuang H.H. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D. Neuron. 2004; 43: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 24Bandell M. Dubin A.E. Petrus M.J. Orth A. Mathur J. Hwang S.W. Patapoutian A. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and that residues in the S4 transmembrane segment and S4–S5 linker are also important for menthol binding (21Voets T. Owsianik G. Janssens A. Talavera K. Nilius B. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In addition, hydrophobic residues in the TRP domain are important for menthol, but not temperature, activation (24Bandell M. Dubin A.E. Petrus M.J. Orth A. Mathur J. Hwang S.W. Patapoutian A. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Finally, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) is required for TRPM8 activity. Hydrolysis of PIP2 after TRPM8 activation and the resulting Ca2+ entry into the cells results in rundown of the TRPM8 current (25Liu B. Qin F. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1674-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Current evidence indicates that conserved positively charged residues in the TRP domain are involved in the PIP2 regulation of TRPM8 and other TRP channels (26Rohacs T. Lopes C.M. Michailidis I. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar).In this study we endeavored to determine the role of different TRPM8 regions. This was carried out by deletion mutagenesis in combination with assays for channel function: tetramerization, localization, and channel activation by cooling and agonists. Both the N and C termini of TRPM8 are critical for proper function. A region N-terminal to the first MHR, encompassing residues 40–86, is required for plasma membrane localization. Furthermore, although the transmembrane domain is sufficient for tetramerization, the C-terminal coiled-coil domain is an important component of the channel gate.MATERIALS AND METHODSCloning and Expression—Using the QuikChange PCR protocol (Stratagene), the silent mutations c198t and t2772c were introduced into Rattus norvegicus TRPM8 cDNA (provided by David Julius) to remove two NdeI sites. Full-length TRPM8 and the deletion mutants were amplified by PCR and ligated between the NdeI and NotI sites of a modified pFastBac1 vector, pFastBac-CFLAG, with an altered multiple cloning site and encoding a C-terminal FLAG tag (27Lishko P.V. Procko E. Jin X. Phelps C.B. Gaudet R. Neuron. 2007; 54: 905-918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Bacmid DNA was produced by transformation of the resulting pFBF1-TRPM8 DNA vectors into DH10Bac cells and then transfected into Sf21 insect cells using standard protocols to produce baculovirus (Invitrogen). Insect cells were grown at 27 °C in Hink's TNM-FH (Mediatech) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.1% Pluronic F-68.Electrophysiology—Insect cells were adhered to 12-mm glass coverslips and infected with baculovirus carrying full-length TRPM8 or the deletion mutants at a multiplicity of infection providing maximal protein expression. Currents were recorded 48–52 h postinfection using 2–4 megaohms resistance borosilicate pipettes in the whole-cell patch-clamp configuration on an Axopatch 200B amplifier controlled by a Digidata 1322 and pClamp 9.2 software (Molecular Devices) with data sampling at 5–10 kHz. Whole-cell capacitance was recorded from the amplifier settings. Voltage ramps (1500 ms) from -100 to +100 mV were applied every 5 s from a holding potential of 0 mV. Data were analyzed and displayed with Origin 7.0 (Origin-Lab Corp.) or pClamp 9.2 software. Cells were placed in a temperature-controlled chamber with the thermistor within 1 mm of the recorded cell and held at 28 °C or subjected to temperature ramps by continuous perfusion. A CL-100 bipolar temperature controller (Warner Instruments) was used to control the electrophysiology chamber temperature and generate temperature ramps. A multichamber perfusion apparatus was used for agonist application. The bath (perfusion) solution contained 140 mm sodium gluconate, 10 mm MES, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm d-glucose, adjusted to pH 6.3 with NaOH and an osmolarity of 315 mosm with NaCl. The pipette solution contained 140 mm cesium methanesulfonate, 10 mm MES, 2.5 mm NaCl, and 10 mm EGTA, adjusted to pH 6.3 with CsOH and an osmolarity of 315 mosm. For pH 7.2 experiments, the MES was replaced with HEPES in both the pipette and bath solutions. Menthol (Sigma) and icilin (Tocris) were dissolved in Me2SO prior to dilution in the bath solution. The concentration of Me2SO in the bath solution was <0.1%, and controls showed no response to Me2SO alone. Data are presented as mean ± S.E.Immunofluorescence with Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy—Insect cells were allowed to grow overnight on 22-mm coverslips before baculovirus infection with FLAG-tagged TRPM8. The virus was aspirated and replaced with fresh medium after 1 h to ensure synchronous infection and expression. After 48 h the cells were fixed with formaldehyde, permeabilized with saponin, stained with monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody M2-fluorescein isothiocynate conjugate (Sigma), and counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes). Slides were mounted using ProLong solution (Molecular Probes). Images were collected within 48 h of staining/mounting using a Zeiss LSM510 META on an upright microscope with 355- and 488-nm lasers at the Harvard University Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology Imaging Facility.Pentadecafluorooctanoic Acid (PFO)-PAGE—Insect cells were infected as for immunofluorescence, washed once with Tris-buffered saline, homogenized in Tris-buffered saline + 1% Triton X-100, and centrifuged to remove cell debris. Whole-cell lysates were mixed with an equal volume of PFO sample buffer (100 mm Tris, 20% glycerol, 8% PFO (Fluka), and 0.005% bromphenol blue (pH 8.0)) and run on a 4–15% gel in 20 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 0.5% PFO (pH 8.3). FLAG-tagged TRPM8 constructs were detected by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibody M2 conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma).Anti-FLAG M2-Agarose Pulldowns and Size Exclusion Chromatography—Insect cells were co-infected with baculovirus carrying the appropriate FLAG-tagged constructs and harvested 48 h postinfection. Cells were lysed by trituration in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Fos-choline-12 (pH 7.5) (Anatrace) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C prior to centrifugation for 20 min at 20,000 × g. Supernatants were applied to 50 μl of anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with 1 ml of Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.5) + 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.2% Fos-choline-12 and eluted with 0.5 ml of the same solution supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml 3X FLAG peptide (Biopolymers Laboratory at Harvard Medical School). The samples were injected on a Sephacryl S300 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare) in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) supplemented with 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Fos-choline-12. Bio-Rad size exclusion standards were used to calibrate the column. The elution volumes of the TRPM8 samples were determined by Western blotting using anti-FLAG M2-antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma).RESULTSConstruct Design and Expression—All TRPM8 deletion mutants were generated based on homology to other TRPM family members from worms to humans (alignment in supplemental Fig. S1). The N-terminal deletion mutant boundaries were based on the location of breakpoints in similarity levels. The first deletion, removing the N-terminal 39 residues (ΔN39), marks the start of homology between TRPM8 and other TRPM proteins (Fig. 1). Deletions ΔN86 and ΔN116 remove regions of progressively higher similarity, and residue 117 also marks the start of the first TRPM homology region. The other two N-terminal deletion mutants, ΔN245 and ΔN352, remove the first and second MHRs, respectively. The two C-terminal deletion mutants were designed to remove most of the conserved coiled-coil domain (ΔC1070) and the entire cytosolic region including the TRP domain (ΔC992). The N-terminal cytosolic domain of TRPM8 (M8-NT, residues 1–692) was used as a nontransmembrane domain control. All constructs were cloned with a C-terminal FLAG tag for detection. Full-length FLAG-tagged TRPM8 (M8-FL) and the deletion mutants were expressed in Sf21 insect cells by baculovirus infection, and expression was confirmed by Western blotting (data not shown).Electrophysiology—TRPM8 activity was assayed using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology in insect cells. Previous studies with TRPV1 have shown the suitability of insect cells for studying TRP channels by electrophysiology (27Lishko P.V. Procko E. Jin X. Phelps C.B. Gaudet R. Neuron. 2007; 54: 905-918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 28Phelps C.B. Procko E. Lishko P.V. Wang R.R. Gaudet R. Channels. 2007; 1: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise noted, experiments were carried out at the native pH (6.3) of Sf21 insect cells.TRPM8 expressed in insect cells has a reverse potential of -8.5 ± 2.3 mV and a temperature of 50% activation of 21 ± 2°C (Fig. 2) similar to the values obtained from mammalian cells (10McKemy D.D. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D. Nature. 2002; 416: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1938) Google Scholar). At pH 6.3, TRPM8 was activated both by cooling (to 15 °C) and by menthol (0.5 mm). Icilin (10 μm) was unable to activate TRPM8 at pH 6.3 (n = 6) (Fig. 2) as observed previously (23Andersson D.A. Chase H.W. Bevan S. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5364-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Raising both the intra- and extracellular pH to 7.2 restored sensitivity to icilin but did not alter the response to menthol. At -80 mV, the average maximal current density in response to 0.5 mm menthol is the same, within error, at pH 6.3 and 7.2: -64.5 ± 6.2 pA/pF (n = 6) and -70.7 ± 19.2 pA/pF (n = 4), respectively. In contrast, there was almost no response to 10 μm icilin at pH 6.3, with a current density of -6.4 ± 1.1 pA/pF (n = 6), whereas at pH 7.2 the icilin response was similar to the menthol response, with a current density of -73.3 ± 15.8 pA/pF (n = 4). These data confirm that the properties of TRPM8 expressed in insect cells are very similar to those observed previously in mammalian cells (10McKemy D.D. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D.

The sample recording (C) and current-voltage relationship data (D) were recorded and processed as in A and B, and the aggregate data in D are from n = 6 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As previous reports indicated that PIP2 is important for TRPM8 activation, we tested the effect of supplementing the pipette (intracellular) solution with 20 μm PIP2. In the presence of PIP2, icilin (10 μm) was able to activate TRPM8 at pH 6.3 with currents almost identical to those activated by menthol in the presence of PIP2 (Fig. 2). PIP2 also potentiated the responses to temperature and menthol: much larger currents were observed at negative potentials, and the responses became less outwardly rectified (Fig. 2). These results, combined with other data published previously (19Brauchi S. Orio P. Latorre R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15494-15499Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 21Voets T. Owsianik G. Janssens A. Talavera K. Nilius B. Nat. Chem.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1674-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), clearly indicate that gating of TRPM8 is modulated by the simultaneous interplay of pH, ligand binding (PIP2, menthol, and icilin), temperature, and membrane voltage and that the insect cell expression system is appropriate for the study of TRPM8 and its modulation by all those agonists.All TPRM8 deletion mutants were then examined for their ability to respond to cooling and menthol (Figs. 1 and 3). Of the deletion mutants, only ΔN39 showed wild-type TRPM8 activity. As shown in Fig. 3, the current-voltage responses for M8-FL and ΔN39 are almost identical for both temperature and menthol. All other mutants failed to respond to either 1 mm menthol or cooling to less than 12 °C. We also applied menthol during cooling, as both stimuli are known to sensitize TRPM8 to the other (10McKemy D.D. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D. Nature. 2002; 416: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1938) Google Scholar, 11Peier A.M. Moqrich A. Hergarden A.C. Reeve A.J. Andersson D.A. Story G.M. Earley T.J. Dragoni I. McIntyre P. Bevan S. Patapoutian A. Cell. 2002; 108: 705-715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar). This sensitization can be seen in the M8-FL and ΔN39 recordings, particularly at a negative potential (Fig. 3). The dual stimulation with temperature and menthol failed to generate a response in all other deletion mutants (Figs. 1B and 3). Forty of 46 cells (87%) exposed to M8-FL baculovirus responded to stimulation. Therefore, to eliminate the possibility that the lack of response in other deletion mutants was due to patching of uninfected cells, 10 cells were tested for the smallest truncations (ΔN86, ΔN116, and ΔC1070; a sign test yields a p value of 0.001), and all other deletion mutants were tested six times (p < 0.05). In summary, residues 1–39 are dispensable, whereas the conserved regions at the N and C termini of TRPM proteins are critical for the proper functioning of TRPM8.FIGURE 3Whole-cell patch-clamp of TPRM8 deletion mutants. Sample recordings were from insect cells expressing full-length TRPM8 (A) or ΔN39 (B). C, current-voltage relationships of full-length (solid symbols) and ΔN39 (open symbols) TRPM8 stimulated with 1 mm menthol (diamonds) or cooling to 15 °C (squares). Average current density is plotted against membrane potential for n = 8 cells, error bars represent the S.E. D–F, sample recordings from insect cells infected with ΔN86 (D), ΔC1070 (E), and empty virus (control, F). ΔN86 and ΔC1070 show the same responses to menthol and temperature as control insect cells infected with empty virus. All currents were extracted from 1500-ms voltage ramps, and currents at +80 (open squares) and -80 mV (filled triangles) are shown. Temperature is shown in gray, and stimulation with 1 mm menthol is indicated by black bars. The dashed lines indicate zero current.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tetramerization—To form competent channels that can be studied by patch-clamp electrophysiology, TRPM8 must first form tetramers and be transported to the plasma membrane. Therefore, we endeavored to determine the oligomeric state of the inactive deletion mutants.Tetramerization was examined using PFO-PAGE. PFO is an anionic detergent that is milder than SDS and preserves the oligomeric structure of many proteins and was shown recently to be effective with TRPM8 (29Dragoni I. Guida E. McIntyre P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37353-37360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Detergent-solubilized insect cell membrane extracts were subjected to PFO-PAGE and visualized by anti-FLAG Western blotting (Fig. 4A). Apoferritin, catalase, and bovine serum albumin were also run as molecular weight standards to calculate a standard curve. Fig. 4B shows a plot comparing TRPV1 and TRPM8 to molecular weight standards. The relative mobilities of the four observed bands for each TRPV1 and TRPM8 are plotted using the predicted molecular weights of oligomers of n = 1–4 and show good agreement with the standards. The N-terminal cytosolic domain was the only construct tested that did not form tetramers.FIGURE 4Oligomerization of TRPM8 deletion mutants. A, 4–15% PFO-PAGE visualized by anti-FLAG Western blotting. The number of subunits (n) of the oligomers is indicated next to the bands. B, relative mobility of PFO-PAGE samples plotted against the log of their molecular weight (MW). Standards (apoferritin, catalase, and bovine serum albumin) are shown as circles, and the black line shows the linear fit to the molecular weight standards. The relative mobilities of TRPV1 (triangles) and TRPM8 (squares) oligomers are plotted against the calculated molecular weight for n-monomers and show good agreement with the standard curve. C, 7.5% SDS-PAGE/anti-FLAG Western blotting of fractions from size exclusion analysis of insect cell-expressed ΔN39 and ΔC1070. The void volume (V0) and retention volumes of molecular weight standards are indicated along with the retention volume of the individual samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm the role of the transmembrane domain in subunit association, FLAG-tagged ΔN39 and ΔC1070 were expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells and partially purified by anti-FLAG pulldown prior to analysis by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 4C). ΔN39 was selected instead of full-length TRPM8 because of its higher expression levels and because it is the active construct that is the closest in molecular weight to ΔC1070. Both ΔN39 and ΔC1070 eluted at approximately the same volume, indicating that they are in the same oligomeric state. Furthermore, their elution volume is consistent with that of a tetramer.Subcellular Localization—Plasma membrane localization, as mentioned above, is an important step in forming fully functional channels that are accessible to functional assays by patch-clamp electrophysiology. Subcellular localization was determined by confocal microscopy and immunofluorescence (Fig. 5). As expected"

The molecular mechanisms underlying Cryptosporidium attachment to, and invasion of, host cells are poorly understood. Previously, we described a surface-associated Gal/GalNAc-specific lectin activity in sporozoites of Cryptosporidium parvum. Here we describe p30, a 30-kDa Gal/GalNAc-specific lectin isolated from C. parvum and Cryptosporidium hominis sporozoites by Gal-affinity chromatography. p30 is encoded by a single copy gene containing a 906-bp open reading frame, the deduced amino acid sequence of which predicts a 302-amino acid, 31.8-kDa protein with a 22-amino acid N-terminal signal sequence. The p30 gene is expressed at 24–72 h after infection of intestinal epithelial cells. Antisera to recombinant p30 expressed in Escherichia coli react with an ∼30-kDa protein in C. parvum and C. hominis. p30 is localized to the apical region of sporozoites and is predominantly intracellular in both sporozoites and intracellular stages of the parasite. p30 associates with gp900 and gp40, Gal/GalNAc-containing mucin-like glycoproteins that are also implicated in mediating infection. Native and recombinant p30 bind to Caco-2A cells in a dose-dependent, saturable, and Gal-inhibitable manner. Recombinant p30 inhibits C. parvum attachment to and infection of Caco-2A cells, whereas antisera to the recombinant protein also inhibit infection. Taken together, these findings suggest that p30 mediates C. parvum infection in vitro and raise the possibility that this protein may serve as a target for intervention.

The intestinal apicomplexan parasite Cryptosporidium causes human and animal diarrheal disease worldwide (1Leav B.A. Mackay M. Ward H.D. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2003; 36: 903-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 2Tzipori S. Ward H. Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 1047-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) The two major species that cause human disease are Cryptosporidium parvum, which infects humans as well as other animals, and Cryptosporidium hominis, which primarily infects humans (3Xiao L. Fayer R. Ryan U. Upton S.J. Clin. Microbial. Rev. 2004; 17: 72-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Cryptosporidial infection in immunocompetent hosts is asymptomatic or self-limiting. However, in immunocompromised hosts, such as patients with AIDS, Cryptosporidium may cause severe, chronic, and possibly fatal disease. Cryptosporidium is responsible for numerous outbreaks of waterborne diarrheal disease worldwide. Because of the potential for intentional contamination of water supplies with this organism, the Centers for Disease Control have listed Cryptosporidium as a category B pathogen for biodefense (4Rotz L.D. Khan A.S. Lillibridge S.R. Ostroff S.M. Hughes J.M. Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2002; 8: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Treatment options for cryptosporidiosis are limited. Although nitazoxanide is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in immunocompetent individuals with the infection, this drug is not effective against cryptosporidiosis in immunocompromised patients (5Zardi E.M. Picardi A. Afeltra A. Chemotherapy. 2005; 51: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Infection with Cryptosporidium occurs when oocysts are ingested with contaminated water or food or by direct person-to-person contact. Oocysts excyst in the small intestine, releasing sporozoites that attach to and invade intestinal epithelial cells. Intracellular replication occurs within a parasitophorus vacuole via asexual as well as sexual cycles. Although the pathogenic mechanisms by which Cryptosporidium cause disease are poorly understood, it is apparent that attachment of invasive stages (sporozoites and merozoites) of the parasite to epithelial cells and subsequent invasion of these cells are crucial events in the establishment of an infection. The ultrastructural characteristics of attachment and invasion and various factors influencing attachment have been described (6Fayer R. Guidry A. Blagburn B.L. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 2962-2965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hamer D.H. Ward H. Tzipori S. Pereira M.E. Alroy J.P. Keusch G.T. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 2208-2213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lumb R. Smith K. O'Donoghue P.J. Lanser J.A. Parasitol. Res. 1988; 74: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, little is known about specific parasite and host molecules involved in these processes. Knowledge of such molecules is crucial for understanding the pathogenic mechanisms involved in these interactions and for designing novel strategies to combat cryptosporidiosis. However, progress in identifying these molecules and their functional role has been severely hampered by the inability to propagate Cryptosporidium in vitro and to genetically manipulate the parasite (9Wanyiri J. Ward H. Future Microbiol. 2006; 1: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the human or animal host, Cryptosporidium preferentially infects small intestinal epithelial cells (10Yu J.R. Choi S.D. Kim Y.W. Korean J. Parasitol. 2000; 38: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 11Upton S.J. Tilley M. Brillhart D.B. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 118: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This suggests that specific parasite and/or host determinants are involved in recognition and adhesion of the parasite to host cells. A number of such intercellular recognition and adhesion functions are mediated by lectins, or carbohydrate-binding proteins, via their interaction with specific carbohydrate residues (12Houzelstein D. Goncalves I.R. Fadden A.J. Sidhu S.S. Cooper D.N. Drickamer K. Leffler H. Poirier F. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2004; 21: 1177-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 13Sharon N. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2042-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Lectins or carbohydrate-binding proteins have been implicated as mediators of attachment and/or invasion of host cells in a number of protozoan parasites (14Bhat N. Ward H. Caron M. Seve A.P. Lectins and Pathology. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam, Netherlands2000: 173-200Google Scholar). Previous studies from our group reported the presence of surface-associated lectin activity in C. parvum sporozoites (15Thea D.M. Pereira M.E. Kotler D. Sterling C.R. Keusch G.T. J.

This activity was identified using a hemagglutination (HA) 3The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutination; Tg, Toxoplasma gondii; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium; RT, reverse transcription; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PIC, protease inhibitor mixture; mAb, monoclonal antibody; IFA, immunofluorescence assay; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; ORF, open reading frame; OGS, octyl glucoside; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; MALDI-TOF-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry. 3The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutination; Tg, Toxoplasma gondii; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium; RT, reverse transcription; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PIC, protease inhibitor mixture; mAb, monoclonal antibody; IFA, immunofluorescence assay; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; ORF, open reading frame; OGS, octyl glucoside; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; MALDI-TOF-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry. assay, is optimal at a pH of 7.5 and in the presence of divalent cations Ca2+ and Mn2+, and is most specific for the monosaccharides Gal and GalNAc (16Joe A. Hamer D.H. Kelley M.A. Pereira M.E. Keusch G.T. Tzipori S. Ward H.D. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1994; 41: S44PubMed Google Scholar). Gal and GalNAc-containing disaccharides and glycoconjugates, such as mucins, are potent inhibitors of lectin-induced hemagglutination. In addition, mucins block attachment to and invasion of host cells, implicating either host mucins and/or a C. parvum Gal/GalNAc-binding lectin in host cell recognition and adherence by C. parvum (17Joe A. Verdon R. Tzipori S. Keusch G.T. Ward H.D. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 3429-3432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Chen X.M. LaRusso N.F.

Immun. 2006; 74: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Here we describe the identification and characterization of a 30-kDa Gal/GalNAc-specific lectin named C. parvum or C. hominis protein 30 (p30), which binds to intestinal epithelial cells and mediates attachment to and subsequent infection of these cells in vitro. Parasites—C. parvum (GCH1) and C. hominis (TU502) oocysts were obtained from Dr. Saul Tzipori, Tufts University Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine (Grafton, MA), and C. parvum (Iowa) was obtained from Pleasant Farms, Troy, ID, or Bunch Grass Farms, Deary, ID. Oocysts were stored at 4 °C. Prior to use oocysts were treated with 1.75% (v/v) sodium hypochlorite for 10 min on ice and then washed twice with 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 150 mm sodium chloride (PBS) by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. Hypochlorite-treated, washed oocysts were excysted for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of 0.75% taurocholic acid in PBS. Excysted sporozoites were separated from oocysts by filtration through a 3.0-μm pore-size Nucleopore polycarbonate filter (Costar Scientific Corp., Cambridge, MA). Exocytosed or “shed proteins” were obtained as described previously (20Cevallos A.M. Bhat N. Verdon R. Hamer D.H. Stein B. Tzipori S. Pereira M.E. Keusch G.T. Ward H.D. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5167-5175Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Soluble phase proteins were obtained by Triton X-114 extraction and phase separation. Briefly, hypochlorite-treated oocysts (1.5 × 108/ml) were excysted for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of 0.75% taurocholic acid, and the mixture of excysted oocysts and sporozoites was incubated with ice-cold pre-condensed 2% (v/v) Triton X-114 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm sodium chloride (TBS-1) for 1 h on ice followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min to induce phase separation. The aqueous phase containing soluble proteins (soluble phase proteins) and the detergent phase enriched in membrane proteins (detergent phase proteins) were separated by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. Proteins in both phases were precipitated with 8 volumes of chilled (-20 °C) acetone overnight at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, the pellet was dried at room temperature, dissolved in SDS-PAGE reducing sample buffer, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Cell Culture—Intestinal epithelial Caco-2A and HCT-8 cells were grown in 75-cm2 flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf sera, 25 mm HEPES, 100 units of penicillin, and 100 μg of streptomycin per ml at 37 °C in 5% CO2 as described earlier (17Joe A. Verdon R. Tzipori S. Keusch G.T. Ward H.D. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 3429-3432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gal-affinity Chromatography—Hypochlorite-treated C. parvum oocysts (2 × 109) were resuspended in PBS containing a protease inhibitor mixture (PIC) consisting of 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μm leupeptin (Sigma), 20 μm pepstatin (Sigma), and 20 μm E-64 (Sigma) and excysted at 37 °C for 1 h. The resultant mixture of sporozoites and unexcysted oocysts was washed three times with PBS by centrifugation at 4500 × g for 15 min, resuspended in PBS containing PIC, and lysed by sonication on ice using a Branson Sonifier 450 (Branson Ultrasonics Corporation, Danbury, CT) (five times for 1 min each with an interval of 2 min, 50% duty cycle, output 3) followed by detergent extraction in 1% octyl glucoside (1% OGS) (Sigma) in PBS overnight at 4 °C, and centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 25 min. C. parvum lysate or C. hominis soluble phase proteins were applied to Gal-agarose (EY Laboratories Inc. San Mateo, CA) columns equilibrated with PBS containing 1% OGS overnight at 4 °C. After extensive washing with PBS containing 0.1% OGS, bound proteins were eluted with 1 m Gal in 0.01% OGS/PBS. Proteins present in the eluted fractions were detected by silver staining following SDS-PAGE. Eluted fractions were pooled and concentrated using Centricon-10 centrifugal filters (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Gel Filtration—Gal affinity-purified proteins were separated by gel filtration on a Sephacryl S300-HR column (0.75 × 26.5 cm) equilibrated with TBS-1 containing 1 m Gal and 0.01% Triton X-100. 0.3-ml fractions were collected at a flow rate of 20 ml/h. The void volume (Vo) of the column was determined using blue dextran (2,000,000–4,000,000 kDa), and the column was calibrated using cytochrome c (14,700), carbonic anhydrase (29,000), albumin (68,000), amylase (200,000), and thyroglobulin (669,000) (all obtained from Sigma) as standards. Protein content of the fractions was monitored using a micro BCA assay kit (Pierce). Each fraction was concentrated 6-fold using Vivaspin 500 concentrators (Vivascience, Stonehouse, UK) and analyzed by Western blotting. The blots were probed with α-rp30 sera and mAb 4E9. p30, gp40, and gp900 present in the fractions were quantified by scanning densitometry of the Western blots using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). The molecular mass of the proteins eluted in the two major included peaks was determined by the least squares line equation (21Andrews P. Biochem. J. 1965; 96: 595-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar). N-terminal and Internal Peptide Amino Acid Sequence Determination—Gal affinity-purified proteins from C. parvum were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.), and stained with Coomassie Blue. The 30-kDa band was excised and processed for N-terminal amino acid microsequencing by automated Edman degradation using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences ABI 477A sequencer at the Tufts University Core Facility. The N-terminal sequence of the first 11 residues was determined. To obtain amino acid sequence data from internal peptides, the 30-kDa band was excised from Coomassie Blue-stained SDS gels and submitted to the Harvard Microchemistry Facility, Cambridge, MA. After in-gel tryptic digestion of the protein, sequence analysis of peptides was performed by microcapillary reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry on a Finnigan LCQ quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. Four peptides were selected and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). These four peptides were then sequenced by Edman degradation. High confidence amino acid sequences (supported by the MALDI-TOF-MS results) were obtained for four peptides (Table 1).TABLE 1Sequence of p30-derived peptides and synthetic oligonucleotides used for PCR and RT-PCRPeptidesOligonucleotidesNGVC1LKKGaThis is an N-terminal peptide; P1 and P2 are degenerate primersP1, 5′-AATGGAGUCTGCATTCUUAAAAAAGG-3′ (Forward)FIAGSKVAYSLYKP2, 5′-TTTATAUUGGGUATAAGC-3′ (Reverse)QEWLATSSGSFVGR–FIYQSVSQGTMNVSR–P3, 5′-ATGAGCGGCGCGCGCAGCAGCATTTTTATT-3′ (Forward)P4, 5′-AACGGCGTGTGCATTCTGAAAAAAGGCGC-3′ (Forward)P5, 5′-ATAGCTGTTCATGGTGCCCTGGCTC-3′ (Reverse)a This is an N-terminal peptide; P1 and P2 are degenerate primers Open table in a new tab Hemagglutination (HA) and HA Inhibition Assays—The presence of lectin activity was determined by using an HA assay (22Goldhar J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 236: 211-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Serial doubling dilutions (in PBS containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 2 mm CaCl2) of starting material or eluate were incubated with equal volumes of a 1% (v/v) suspension of rabbit erythrocytes in PBS in the wells of a U-bottom microtiter plate (Falcon Micro Test III™ BD Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. Lectin activity was expressed (in HA units) as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of the test solution showing visible hemagglutination. Carbohydrate specificity was determined using an HA inhibition assay. Serial 2-fold dilutions of mono- and disaccharides (Sigma) in PBS were preincubated with equal volumes of test solution for 1 h at room temperature, and an equal volume of 1% rabbit erythrocytes in PBS was added. The plate was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C, and HA titer was determined as described above. DNA Isolation, PCR, and DNA Sequencing—DNA was isolated from hypochlorite-treated, freeze-thawed GCH1 oocysts using a Fast DNA kit (Bio 101, Carlsbad, CA). Degenerate primers (P1 and P2, see Table 1) were constructed based on the amino acid sequence of the N-terminal and internal peptides shown in Table 1 (Invitrogen). Nondegenerate primers P3, P4, and P5 (Table 1) were synthesized by the Tufts University School of Medicine Core Facility. Conditions for PCR using degenerate primers were as follows: 95 °C for 2 min; 95 °C for 40 s, 37 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 50 s (5 cycles); 94 °C for 40 s, 55 °C for 50 s, and 72 °C for 50 s (35 cycles); and 72 °C for 5 min. The first five cycles were excluded for PCR using nondegenerate primers. Reagents were used at the following final concentrations: deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 0.4 mm; degenerate primers, 1 μm; nondegenerate primers, 0.5 μm; MgCl2, 2.5 mm; and TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The 909-bp fragment generated by PCR using primers P3 and P5 was cloned into the pCR 2.1 vector (Invitrogen) for sequencing. Plasmids were purified using a Qiagen miniprep kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA). DNA sequencing was performed by the dye-terminator method at the Tufts University School of Medicine Core Facility using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences ABI 377 sequencer. The BLAST algorithm was used to compare DNA and protein sequences to sequences in data bases. Analysis of nucleotide and amino acid sequences was performed using Vector NTI software (Informax, North Bethesda, MD) and the ExPASy Molecular Biology Server. The entire coding sequences of p30 were obtained from the C. parvum (23Abrahamsen M.S. Templeton T.J. Enomoto S. Abrahante J.E. Zhu G. Lancto C.A. Deng M. Liu C. Widmer G. Tzipori S. Buck G.A. Xu P.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D329-D331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequences of p30 were deposited in GenBank™ under accession numbers AY308041 (GCH1, C. parvum) and AY308040 (TU502, C. hominis). RT-PCR and Northern Blot Analysis—Caco-2A cells were grown to confluence in T25 tissue culture flasks and infected with C. parvum GCH1 oocysts (3 × 106 per flask) for 24 h at 37 °C as described previously (20Cevallos A.M. Bhat N. Verdon R. Hamer D.H. Stein B. Tzipori S. Pereira M.E. Keusch G.T. Ward H.D. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5167-5175Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). RNA was extracted from uninfected and infected Caco-2A monolayers at different time points (24, 48, and 72 h) using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Contaminating DNA was removed by RNase-free DNase treatment using a DNA-free™ kit (Ambion). 8 μg of total RNA was used in each RT reaction, which was performed using primers P3 and P5 (Table 1) and the Access RT-PCR System according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). RNA from uninfected Caco-2A cells was used as a negative control. RT-PCRs without added reverse transcriptase were performed in parallel to confirm that the PCR products were not because of the amplification of contaminating DNA. The product obtained by RT-PCR was cloned into the TOPO pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen), and the nucleotide sequence was determined as described above. As a loading control for the RT-PCRs, an 800-bp fragment of the C. parvum small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU rRNA) was amplified using previously described primers and conditions (27Tosini F. Agnoli A. Mele R. Gomez Morales M.A. Pozio E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 134: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (28O'Connor R.M. Thorpe C.M. Cevallos A.M. Ward H.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 119: 203-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, mRNA was isolated from uninfected and infected Caco-2A cells using an Oligotex QIA kit (Qiagen). 3.5 μg of mRNA was separated by 1% glyoxyl-agarose electrophoresis, transferred to a BrightStar Plus nylon membrane (Ambion) using a Northern-Gly blotting kit (Ambion) and fixed by UV radiation using a UV Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene). The 909-bp product generated by PCR using genomic DNA (Table 1) was extracted from an agarose gel using a GEL QIAquick extraction kit (Qiagen), labeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming, and the membrane hybridized with this probe. Hybridization was carried out in prehybridization/hybridization solution at 65 °C for 16 h in a PersonalHyb™ chamber (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The blot was washed three times with 40 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% SDS and exposed to film, and reactive bands were detected by autoradiography. Expression, Purification, and Gal Binding of Recombinant p30—The p30 sequence (excluding the signal sequence) was cloned from genomic DNA and primers P4 and P5 into the pET-32 Xa/LIC vector (Novagen, Madison WI), which contains an internal factor Xa cleavage site (8 amino acids), a thrombin site (8 amino acids), an S tag (15 amino acids), a His tag (6 amino acids), and an N-terminal thioredoxin tag (109 amino acids), and the plasmid was designated pNBp30. The recombinant fusion protein designated rp30 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli AD494 (DE3) cells following induction with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. E. coli cells expressing rp30 were lysed in BugBuster reagent (Novagen), and the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min in the presence of Benzonase 1 mg/ml (Novagen). The supernatant and pellet (containing inclusion bodies) were resuspended in TBS-1, resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and the S tag present in the fusion protein was detected by probing with HRP-conjugated S-protein according to the manufacturer's instructions (Novagen). The majority of rp30 was detected in the pellet that contains inclusion bodies. rp30 present in inclusion bodies was solubilized and refolded using a protein refolding kit (Novagen). The refolded protein was suspended in binding buffer (50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole, and 5 mm CaCl2), and rp30 was purified by metal-affinity chromatography using Talon metal-affinity resin (Clontech). Purity of rp30, which migrated at the expected relative molecular mass of 48 kDa, was verified by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with HRP-conjugated S protein. Equal amounts of purified rp30 in binding buffer were applied to two 0.5-ml Gal-agarose columns overnight at 4 °C. After washing with 10 bed volumes of binding buffer, the bound proteins were eluted with 1 m Gal or 1 m Glc in the same buffer. Eluted fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Antibodies—mAb 4E9 is an IgM mAb directed at an αGal-NAc-containing carbohydrate epitope present on C. parvum gp900 and gp40 (20Cevallos A.M. Bhat N. Verdon R. Hamer D.H. Stein B. Tzipori S. Pereira M.E. Keusch G.T. Ward H.D. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5167-5175Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Antisera to purified rp30 were produced as follows. Purified rp30 was resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. The 48-kDa band (which was shown to represent rp30 by S tag Western blotting of a parallel strip of gel transferred to nitrocellulose) was excised and emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant for the initial immunization and incomplete complete Freund's adjuvant for subsequent boosts. 6-Week-old BALB/c mice were immunized by intraperitoneal injection at 6–10-week intervals for a total of three immunizations, and the presence of α-rp30 antibodies in sera was monitored by Western blotting of C. parvum oocysts and rp30. Antisera were depleted of antibodies to rp30 by incubation with rp30 immobilized via the His tag on Talon metal affinity resin for 2 h on ice. Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with mAb 4E9 and α-rp30 sera as described (20Cevallos A.M. Bhat N. Verdon R. Hamer D.H. Stein B. Tzipori S. Pereira M.E. Keusch G.T. Ward H.D. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5167-5175Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM and IgG (heavy and light chain) (Pierce) were used as secondary antibodies for mAb 4E9 and α-rp30, respectively. The S tag present in fusion proteins was identified in blots by reactivity with HRP-conjugated S protein according to the manufacturer's instructions (Novagen). Blots were developed with SuperSignal substrate (Pierce). Perfect Protein markers, 10–225 kDa (Novagen); were used as molecular weight standards and were detected by reactivity with HRP-conjugated S protein according to the manufacturer's protocol. Immunofluorescence Assay (IFA)—Hypochlorite-treated oocysts (2 × 107/ml in PBS) were placed on 0.1% poly-l-lysine-coated 8-well chamber slides (Falcon), allowed to excyst at 37°C for 1 h in a moist chamber, then air-dried, fixed, and permeabilized in methanol for 10 min at room temperature. IFAs were performed as described earlier (20Cevallos A.M. Bhat N. Verdon R. Hamer D.H. Stein B. Tzipori S. Pereira M.E. Keusch G.T. Ward H.D. Infect.

Glycosidase Digestion—Hypochlorite-treated oocysts (2 × 108/ml) were excysted in the presence of 0.75% taurocholic acid for 1 h at 37 °C. The mixture of excysted oocysts and sporozoites was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm sodium chloride (TBS-2) and PIC and lysed by freeze-thawing (20 cycles). The lysate was incubated with an equal volume of 2% Triton X-100 in TBS-2 overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was treated with recombinant peptide N-glycosidase F, 300 units/ml (New England Biolabs, Beverley, MA), or α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, 500 units/ml (New England Biolabs), at 37 °C overnight according to the manufacturer's instructions. As a control for these glycosidases, aliquots of lysate were treated with buffer alone under identical conditions. p30 Binding Assay—Binding of p30 to Caco-2A cells was assessed by ELISA (20Cevallos A.M.

https://openalex.org/W2093334711,"Cysteine-rich 61 (Cyr61/CCN1) is involved in human gastric cancer development and progression. Nonetheless, the role of Cyr61 as regards peritoneal dissemination of such cancers has not yet been completely characterized. We used liposome-mediated transfection to establish Cyr61, or antisense Cyr61, expression vectors into gastric cancer AGS or MKN45 cell lines. Transfectants were tested by means of a cancer-cell adhesion assay in vitro and ex vivo. Furthermore, a functional integrin fluorescence-activated cell sorting assay, reverse transcription-PCR, and an AP-1 reporter assay were performed to investigate the potential signaling pathway of Cyr61. It was shown that stable transfection of Cyr61 into the AGS cell line strongly enhanced its adhesion ability. The overexpression of Cyr61 within AGS cells significantly increased the functional expression of integrin α2β1. Function-neutralizing antibody to integrin α2β1 effectively suppressed the Cyr61-mediated enhanced adhesion of AGS cells to peritoneal tissue. Promoter assays of integrin α2 gene further revealed that the AP-1 pathway was evidently activated within Cyr61-expressing AGS cells. Animal studies have revealed that mice injected with Cyr61-overexpressed AGS cells featured a greater number of peritoneal seeding nodules and a lower survival rate than the Neo control cell lines, and when such cells were treated with functional blocking antibody to integrin α2β1, they were able to elicit a decline in the peritoneal dissemination. The data suggest that Cyr61 may contribute to the peritoneal dissemination of gastric cancer by promoting tumor-cell adhesion ability through the up-regulation of the functional integrin α2β1 via an AP-1-dependent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2004993637,"Post-translational modifications of the extracellular matrix receptor dystroglycan (DG) determine its functional state, and defects in these modifications are linked to muscular dystrophies and cancers. A prominent feature of DG biosynthesis is a precursor cleavage that segregates the ligand-binding and transmembrane domains into the noncovalently attached alpha- and beta-subunits. We investigate here the structural determinants and functional significance of this cleavage. We show that cleavage of DG elicits a conspicuous change in its ligand-binding activity. Mutations that obstruct this cleavage result in increased capacity to bind laminin, in part, due to enhanced glycosylation of alpha-DG. Reconstitution of DG cleavage in a cell-free expression system demonstrates that cleavage takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum, providing a suitable regulatory point for later processing events. Sequence and mutational analyses reveal that the cleavage occurs within a full SEA (sea urchin, enterokinase, agrin) module with traits matching those ascribed to autoproteolysis. Thus, cleavage of DG constitutes a control point for the modulation of its ligand-binding properties, with therapeutic implications for muscular dystrophies. We provide a structural model for the cleavage domain that is validated by experimental analysis and discuss this cleavage in the context of mucin protein and SEA domain evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1970745142,"The bacterial chemotaxis system is one of the most extensively studied signal transduction systems in biology. The response regulator CheY controls flagellar rotation and is phosphorylated by the CheA histidine kinase to its active form. CheC is a CheY-P phosphatase, and this activity is enhanced in a CheC-CheD heterodimer. CheC is also critical for chemotactic adaptation, the return to the prestimulus system state despite persistent attractant concentrations. Here, CheC point mutants were examined in Bacillus subtilis for in vivo complementation and in vitro activity. The mutants were identified separating the three known abilities of CheC: CheD binding, CheY-P binding, and CheY-P phosphatase activity. Remarkably, the phosphatase ability was not as critical to the in vivo function of CheC as the ability to bind both CheY-P and CheD. Additionally, it was confirmed that CheY-P increases the affinity of CheC for CheD, the later of which is known to be necessary for receptor activation of CheA. These data suggest a model of CheC as a CheY-P-induced regulator of CheD. Here, CheY-P would cause CheC to sequester CheD from the chemoreceptors, inducing adaptation of the chemotaxis system.

This model represents the first plausible means for feedback from the output of the system, CheY-P, to the receptors. In the signal transduction process, a cell detects extracellular stimuli, transmits a signal across the cell membrane, and generates a response. Notably, the bacterial chemotaxis system must constantly respond to effectors and then adapt to their continued presence. This adaptation allows the cell to detect minute changes in an attractant gradient. Chemotaxis, the ability of an organism to direct movement toward more favorable environments, is accomplished in the bacteria and archaea through a modified two-component signaling system (1Parkinson J.S. Kofoid E.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 71-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar, 2Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2476) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic histidine kinase CheA is regulated by chemoreceptor proteins known as methylated chemotaxis proteins (MCP) 3The abbreviations used are: MCP, methylated chemotaxis protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase. and coupled to them by the CheW protein (3Borkovich K.A. Kaplan N. Hess J.F. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1208-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In Bacillus subtilis, CheA autophosphorylation increases when the receptors bind an attractant (4Garrity L.F. Ordal G.W. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 2945-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The phosphoryl group is subsequently transferred to the response regulator CheY. This active protein (CheY-P) regulates the rotational direction of the flagella of the cell by binding the flagellar switch protein FliM (5Toker A.S. Macnab R.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 6Scharf B.E. Fahrner K.A. Turner L. Berg H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In B. subtilis, the default rotation is clockwise and causes the cells to “tumble” in space. High CheY-P levels cause the rotation to reverse to counter-clockwise, and the bacterium swims smoothly (7Ordal G.W. Marquez L.M. Chamberlin M.J. Sonenshein A. Bacillus subtilis and Other Gram Positive Bacteria: Biochemistry, Physiology, and Molecular Genetics. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, DC1993: 765-781Google Scholar). Controlled modulation of tumbles and smooth swims results in a biased random walk up a concentration gradient to optimal conditions. Adaptation is accomplished by desensitizing the system to effector concentrations already detected and responded to. This returns CheA to basal activity and leads to normal CheY-P levels (8Jasuja R. Lin Y. Trentham D.R. Khan S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11346-11351Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Traditionally, adaptation has involved modification of the chemotaxis receptors by the addition and removal of methyl-esters from conserved glutamate residues by the CheR methyltransferase (9Djordjevic S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 18610-18616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. The activity of CheR is not directly regulated, but CheB is activated by CheA phosphorylation of its N-terminal response regulator domain. Consequently CheB activity parallels that of CheA and forms a feedback loop between CheA and the receptors. A second, less common adaptation system involves CheV (13Karatan E. Saulmon M.M. Bunn M.W. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43618-43626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), a response regulator protein with a CheW-like domain. CheV-P is thought to decouple CheA and the receptors to bring about adaptation. CheC is also known to be involved in chemotactic adaptation in B. subtilis (14Rosario M.M. Kirby J.R. Bochar D.A. Ordal G.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3823-3831Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 15Kirby J.R. Kristich C.J. Saulmon M.M. Zimmer M.A. Garrity L.F. Zhulin I.B. Ordal G.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), although the mechanism for CheC involvement has been unclear. However, there has been no mechanism identified by which the primary output of the chemotaxis system, CheY-P, was involved in a feedback loop. Removal of the CheY-P signal is accomplished by accelerating the natural auto-dephosphorylation of CheY (2Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2476) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, the CheY-P phosphatase CheZ is absolutely necessary for chemotaxis (16Boesch K.C. Silversmith R.E. Bourret R.B. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3544-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, CheZ has only been found in proteobacterial genomes (17Szurmant H. Ordal G.W. Microbiol. Mol.

These proteins share a common tertiary structure and a consensus sequence (D/S-X3-E-X2-N-X22-P) thought to define the phosphatase active site (17Szurmant H. Ordal G.W. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 301-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). CheC has been shown to form a heterodimer with the receptor deamidase CheD (22Rosario M.M. Ordal G.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This interaction increases the effectiveness of CheC phosphatase activity (20Szurmant H. Muff T.J. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21787-21792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The CheD-binding site on CheC was shown to be an α-helix, which mimics the enzymatic target of CheD, the MCP chemoreceptors (23Chao X. Muff T.J. Park S.Y. Zhang S. Pollard A.M. Ordal G.W. Bilwes A.M. Crane B.R. Cell. 2006; 124: 561-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Because a cheC mutant has defective adaptation, it was proposed that CheD is released from the receptors post stimulus to activate the CheC phosphatase activity (20Szurmant H. Muff T.J. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21787-21792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). CheC has been shown in vitro to inhibit CheD deamidation activity on the MCP chemoreceptors for both Thermotoga maritima (23Chao X. Muff T.J. Park S.Y. Zhang S. Pollard A.M. Ordal G.W. Bilwes A.M.

The addition of CheY-P led to further inhibition of deamidation, suggesting that CheY-P augments CheD binding by CheC (23Chao X. Muff T.J. Park S.Y. Zhang S. Pollard A.M. Ordal G.W. Bilwes A.M. Crane B.R. Cell. 2006; 124: 561-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). CheD has been shown to have other possible MCP interactions, including demethylation (23Chao X.

Cell. 2006; 124: 561-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and an interaction with the HAMP domain found N-terminal to the methylation region (24Kristich C.J. Ordal G.W. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5950-5955Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Indeed, mutants lacking cheD show almost no CheA kinase activity (14Rosario M.M. Kirby J.R. Bochar D.A. Ordal G.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3823-3831Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To further understand the function of CheC, we have mutationally analyzed the two putative phosphatase active sites and the CheD-binding site. The mutant genes were analyzed for their ability to complement the ΔcheC mutant, and the corresponding proteins were assayed for their ability to dephosphorylate and bind CheY-P. We were able to identify mutants defective in the known functions of CheC: CheY-P binding, phosphatase ability, and CheD binding. Based on this data we have created a model for the physical association of CheY with CheC. Further, the ability to bind CheY-P and/or CheD was shown to be critical for chemotaxis, whereas a mutant defective only in phosphatase ability retained some function. Based on this data, we present a model of the chemotaxis system where CheC is a mediator of CheY-P feedback to the receptors via regulation of CheD.

Briefly, the evolution of inorganic phosphate from CheY was measured using the EnzCheck phosphate assay kit (Invitrogen) and a Shimadzu Biospec-1601 spectrophotometer. The data were averaged from two separate experiments. The Pi release rates at various concentrations of phosphatase were plotted versus concentration. Rates of μm Pi min–1 μm–1 phosphatase were determined for CheC, CheC-CheD, and FliY using the slope of the initial, linear portion of the plot. Concentration of CheD was varied to see the activation effect of CheD on the phosphatase ability of CheC and mutants. Swarm Plate Assay for Chemotaxis—Semi-solid swarm plates were inoculated by sterile toothpick from single colonies grown overnight at 30 °C. Tryptone swarm medium was 1% tryptone, 0.5% NaCl, 0.28% agar, 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (to induce expression from Pspac promoters). Tryptone plates were grown at 37 °C for 4 h, and swarm diameters were measured. Swarm sizes were averaged over four swarms for each strain and expressed relative to the wild type.

Methods Enzymol. 2007; 423: 336-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) except 20 mm acetyl phosphate was selectively added to incubations and washes to continuously generate GST-CheY-P or CheY-P. Briefly, a bait GST fusion protein (10 nmol GST-CheY, GST-CheD, or GST) was bound to glutathione-Sepharose (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) and incubated with the secondary protein (12 μm CheC) and co-factors (12 μm CheD or 70 μm CheY). After subsequent washes, the proteins were eluted from the beads, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by Coomassie stain. Presence of the secondary protein indicates a protein-protein interaction. Complementation Ability of cheC Mutants—Alanine mutations were made for each of the four conserved residues (D/S, E, N, and P) in each of the two CheC active sites (Fig. 1A), as well as selected double mutations. The cheC mutant genes were expressed ectopically in strain OI3135 containing an in frame deletion of cheC. Each mutant strain was inoculated onto low agar “swarm” plates. As the cells grow and metabolize the nutrients, they create a gradient detectable by the chemotaxis system and form dense rings as they swarm out from the inoculation point. The diameters of each swarm were measured and expressed normalized to the wild type swarm diameter. Mutants in the first active site were generally less deleterious than those in the second active site (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the second active site is more important for function. For both active sites, glutamate mutants were the most impaired of the four conserved residues. Double mutants cheC-E17A/N20A and -E118/N121A had swarm sizes close to those of the respective single glutamate mutants (Fig. 1B). Paired mutations of the homologous conserved residues from each active site were also created. The double glutamate mutation (cheC-E18A/E118A) is the least able to complement in vivo; its swarm size is no greater than the ΔcheC mutant alone (Fig. 1B). However, the other paired mutants have less effect. The cheC-N20A/N121A and cheC-D13A/S114A mutants are 42 and 64% of the wild type swarm, respectively. The cheC-E18A/N20A/E118/N121A strain predictably looks identical to the ΔcheC mutant (Fig. 1B). Based on this assay, only the glutamate residue of the active sites were necessary for in vivo CheC function. Mutations were generated in cheC residues likely to disrupt the interaction with CheD based on the CheC-CheD crystal structure (23Chao X. Muff T.J. Park S.Y. Zhang S. Pollard A.M. Ordal G.W. Bilwes A.M. Crane B.R. Cell. 2006; 124: 561-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The Asp149 and Ala153 residues are conserved in CheC throughout Gram-positive bacteria and are positioned in the CheC-CheD interface (Fig. 1A). The α2′-helix of CheC serves as the MCP mimic for CheD association. Ala153 is on this α2′-helix, and Asp149 is found between the central β-sheet and α2′-helix. Both residues proved critical for CheD association (Fig. 1B). Previously, a cheC-D149K mutant was shown to have impaired chemotaxis, and the protein was unable to bind to CheD (23Chao X. Muff T.J. Park S.Y. Zhang S. Pollard A.M. Ordal G.W. Bilwes A.M. Crane B.R. Cell. 2006; 124: 561-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Additionally, mutation of Asp149 to tryptophan and even alanine also led to loss of the ability of the gene to complement the ΔcheC strain on swarm plate (Fig. 1B). The Ala153 residue was shown to be intolerant of substitution to tryptophan or leucine (Fig. 1B). These mutants demonstrate that the ability to bind CheD is critical for the function of CheC in vivo. The ΔcheC strain was previously shown to have a “sharp” ring morphology compared with the wild type strain on minimal medium asparagine swarm plates, whereas a cheD::cat mutant did not form a ring (15Kirby J.R. Kristich C.J. Saulmon M.M. Zimmer M.A. Garrity L.F. Zhulin I.B. Ordal G.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Selected mutants were tested on asparagine swarm plates to see whether they retained the cheC morphology. Both the cheC-E17A/E118A and -D149K strains displayed the small, sharp swarm rings associated with the ΔcheC strain (Fig. 2). The cheC-N20A/N121A mutant, however, had a swarm ring similar in morphology to that of the wild type in addition to having a larger swarm size than the ΔcheC strain. A strain deleted for cheC but expressing cheX had a similar swarm size to the cheC-N20A/N121A strain, although it retained the cheC morphology (Fig. 2). Although the swarm sizes of the cheC-N20A/N121A and ΔcheC cheX+ were similar, the differences in swarm morphology further demonstrate that the CheX phosphatase is unable to truly complement the ΔcheC strain as was recently reported (28Muff T.J. Foster R.M. Liu P.J. Ordal G.W. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 7007-7013Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Phosphatase Activity of CheC and the CheC-CheD Complex—Previous studies have shown that CheC is a much weaker CheY-P phosphatase than FliY (20Szurmant H. Muff T.J. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21787-21792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, when CheD was added, the phosphatase activity of CheC was greatly increased. A kinetic assay was employed to quantitate the rates of dephosphorylation of CheY-P (16Boesch K.C. Silversmith R.E. Bourret R.B. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3544-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) in the presence of the phosphatases CheC, CheC-CheD, and FliY. The concentration of phosphatase was varied and plotted against the resulting Pi release/min (Fig. 3A). A rate of μm Pi min–1 μm–1 phosphatase was obtained from the initial linear portion of the curve. The specific activities for CheC, CheC-CheD, and FliY were 1.7 ± 0.1, 7.8 ± 0.2, and 19 ± 1 μm Pi min–1 μm–1 phosphatase, respectively. The CheC-CheD complex showed an increase of 4.6 times the activity of CheC alone. Although CheC alone seems weak at only 9% of FliY activity, the addition of CheD enhanced CheC activity up to almost half that of FliY. Furthermore, FliY and CheC-CheD have the same maximum activity (Fig. 3A). Phosphatase Activity of CheC Mutants—The mutant CheCs were purified and tested for CheY-P phosphatase ability via the phosphate release assay. Mutants in the first active site (CheC-D13A, -E17A, -N20A, and -P43A) had a slightly reduced phosphatase activity compared with wild type CheC; however, all second site mutant proteins (CheC-S114A, -E118A, -N121A, and -P144A) had almost no phosphatase ability (data not shown). Remarkably, when CheD was added to a concentration of 5 μm (such that most CheC should be bound to CheD) the CheC-E118A and CheC-N121 mutant proteins each were nearly indistinguishable from the wild type CheC-CheD (data not shown). To see the effect of CheD activation on these mutant proteins, CheC concentrations were kept constant at 2 μm, and the concentration of CheD was varied from 0 to 5 μm.2 μm CheC was chosen because it was the concentration at which maximum Pi release was attained for the wild type CheC with CheD-(Fig. 3A). CheC-E17A and CheC-N20A had moderately lower Pi release at 0 μm CheD compared with wild type CheC (Fig. 3B), but the Pi release/min increased with CheD concentration for both mutants, although less than wild type. Both mutant proteins caused maximum Pi release per minute at 2 μm CheD, but at a lower maximum rate than wild type CheC. CheC-E17A/N20A had activity similar to the single mutant proteins. Second active site mutants had no phosphatase activity alone. As CheD concentration was increased CheC-E118A and -N121A each gained phosphatase activity (Fig. 3B), but more slowly per μm CheD compared with wild type CheC. Neither reached maximum activity until a CheD concentration of 3 μm, and the CheC-N121A mutant protein exceeded the maximum activity of the wild type CheC (Fig. 3B). CheC-E118A/N121A was activated by CheD very poorly, even in the presence of 5 μm CheD. Paired double CheC mutant proteins were also tested. CheC-N20A/N121A predictably showed no activity at 0 μm CheD but was unable to be activated by CheD at any concentration tested (Fig. 3C). Thus, the conserved asparagine residues are necessary for the phosphatase ability of CheC. CheC-E17A/E118A phosphatase activity was severely impaired as well but showed slight enhancement at high CheD concentration (Fig. 3C). Its maximum activity was still well below wild type CheC alone. The conserved glutamate residues must be important for CheC function but not absolutely critical for the dephosphorylation of CheY-P. CheC-D13A/S114A reacted similarly to the single CheC-S114A mutant; phosphatase activity was impaired but quickly restored by CheD activation (data not shown). Because the cheC-D149K and -D149A mutant strains swarmed the least and the most, respectively, of the CheD-binding mutants, the corresponding proteins were purified and tested for CheD activation of phosphatase ability. Alone, both proteins showed wild type or higher activity, demonstrating that the mutation had little or no direct effect on the active sites (Fig. 3C). When CheD was added, no increase in phosphatase ability was seen until high concentrations (2–3 μm). Thus, CheD was unable to effectively activate either mutant. Binding of CheC to CheY-P—A modified pulldown assay was used to examine binding of CheC and mutants to CheY-P. First, conditions were tested for CheC ± acetyl phosphate (to generate GST-CheY-P) and/or CheD. In the pulldown experiment (Fig. 4A), CheC was only retained in the presence of both acetyl phosphate and CheD and thus only bound GST-CheY-P with CheD. Also tested under these conditions were CheC-E17A/E118A and -N20A/N121A. The later bound GST-CheY with acetyl phosphate and CheD as wild type CheC had, but E17A/E118A would not pulldown with GST-CheY under the conditions tested (Fig. 4A). This shows that CheC only exhibits significant binding (to an extent detectable by pulldowns) toward CheY-P (versus CheY) and only when bound to CheD. Select mutant CheC proteins were tested by the same method to observe the mutational effect on binding to CheY (Fig. 4B). In this assay, acetyl phosphate was added to each sample because it was shown to be necessary for binding, but CheD was varied as control. Again, the wild type CheC and -N20A/N121A mutant proteins both bound GST-CheY in the presence of CheD, whereas CheC-E17A/E118A did not. Less CheC-D13A/S114A bound than the wild type CheC, but considerably more than CheC-E17A/E118A (Fig. 4B). Previous data suggested that the second active site of CheC was more functional than"

Some microorganisms, that can use cellulose as a carbon source produce various cellulases and can efficiently degrade cellulose. Most herbivorous animals and many insects have these types of microorganisms in their digestive systems. Some organisms that have cellulolytic ability were confirmed to produce a huge protein complex called cellulosome, which can efficiently degrade crystalline cellulose (1Béguin P. Aubert J.P. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 13: 25-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the cellulosome, a noncatalytic protein termed the scaffolding protein is associated with several enzymatic proteins by cohesin-dockerin interaction. The scaffolding protein contains modules called cohesin, and each enzymatic protein has a module named dockerin. In the scaffolding protein and the enzymatic proteins, modules are connected to each other by a flexible linker as observed by electron microscopy (2Bayer E.A. Lamed R. J.

CelJ is one of the major enzymatic components of the cellulosome of Clostridium thermocellum strain F1, and its gene was cloned previously (6Ahsan M.M. Kimura T. Karita S. Sakka K. Ohmiya K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5732-5740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is a multidomain endoglucanase and consists of five modules and a signal peptide. The five components are a cellulose binding module that belongs to CBM family 30, a GH family 9 cellulase described as Cel9D, a GH family 44 cellulase described as Cel44A, a dockerin domain, and a CBM domain (CBM44) (7Arai T.

The Cel44A domain was cloned, and its cellulase activities were measured (9Ahsan M. Matsumoto M. Karita S. Kimura T. Sakka K. Ohmiya K. Biosci. Biotechnol.

The recombinant Cel44A consists of 519 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 58 kDa, and it can degrade cellooligosaccharide, xylan, lichenan, and various celluloses, such as acid-swollen cellulose, ball-milled cellulose, and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC). In addition, Najmudin et al. reported that Cel44A has xyloglucanase activity (8Najmudin S. Guerreiro C.I. Carvalho A.L. Prates J.A. Correia M.A. Alves V.D. Ferreira L.M. Romao M.J. Gilbert H.J.

This broader substrate recognition indicates that Cel44A plays a central role in the early stages of cellulose degradation. The structural information of Cel44A was expected to explain this broad substrate recognition as well as the detailed reaction mechanisms of GH family 44 enzymes. Here we report the crystal structure of recombinant Cel44A and two mutant structures in complex with two kinds of substrates. Combined with biochemical experiments, these structures revealed the detailed reaction mechanisms of this enzyme. Protein Expression and Purification—The Cel44A gene was amplified by PCR using the primers listed in Table 1 and inserted into the vector pQE-30 (Qiagen). The cloned Cel44A vector was transformed into Escherichia coli JM109 by electroporation. E. coli cells were grown in LB medium at 37 °C with 100 μg/ml ampicillin to midexponential phase (A600 = 0.6) and for an additional 3 h after adding 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to induce expression. Expressed protein was purified with HiTrap Chelating HP 5 ml (Amersham Biosciences), treated with thrombin (Sigma) to remove the His tag, and passed again through HiTrap Chelating HP 5 ml, and the flow-through fractions were collected. Finally, it was purified with HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 pg (Amersham Biosciences) and concentrated to A280 = 16.6 in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). Vectors carrying the E186Q and E359Q mutants were cloned and amplified by PCR using the primers listed in Table 1 designed against wild-type Cel44A vector. The PCR products were treated with DpnI (New England BioLabs) to degrade template plasmids. The expression and purification procedures of these mutants were the same as described for the wild type.TABLE 1Primers used for cloning and mutagenesis of Cel44AConstructsPrimersSequencesWild typeForwardGTTAGATCTGAACCTGCAAAAGTGGTTGACReverseGTTGTCGACTAGGGCTCCGCAGCTTCAAGCACE186QForwardGTTATTCAATAGATAACCAGCCGGCReverseCCACAATGCCCGGCTGGTTATCTATTGE359QForwardCTTGCTATAACTCAATATGACTATGReverseGCCATAGTCATATTGAGTTATAGC Open table in a new tab Enzyme Assay—Cellulase activity of Cel44A mutants was measured by incubation of 5.7, 5.8, and 5.7 μg of protein at 60 °C in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) in the presence of CMC (10 mg/ml; Sigma) with 300 μl of the reaction mixture. Released reducing sugars were determined with 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid reagent (10Miller G.L. Anal. Chem. 1959; 31: 426-428Crossref Scopus (21978) Google Scholar), using glucose as the standard. After incubation, 900 μl of 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid reagent was added and heated in a boiling bath for 5 min. The absorbance was measured at 570 nm. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to release 1 μmol of reducing sugar from CMC in 1 min. The enzymatic kinetics of Cel44A against cellohexaitol was determined by measuring the rate of release of reducing sugars also using 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid reagent (10Miller G.L. Anal. Chem. 1959; 31: 426-428Crossref Scopus (21978) Google Scholar) with glucose as the standard. Cellohexaitol was prepared following the previous report (11Schou C. Rasmussen G. Kaltoft M.B. Henrissat B. Schulein M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 947-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). 25 mg of cellohexaose was reduced with 5 mg of sodium borohydride in 1 ml of water at room temperature. After 2 h, the solution was neutralized with Amberlite IR-120H cation exchange resin H+ form (Sigma), and its supernatant was collected. Then the solution was freeze-dried. Assays were carried out at 60 °C in 10 mm potassium sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The reaction system included 1–6 mm cellohexaitol and 3.26 μg of protein in a 30-μl solution. The reaction velocities were calculated by estimating the release of reducing sugars against six substrate concentrations. Chronological Examinations of 1H NMR Measurements of the Reaction Product—Cel44A protein was purified without the thrombin treatment and was finally dissolved in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Then the enzyme and substrate cellohexaitol were freeze-dried and were dissolved in D2O twice. Final concentration of the substrate cellohexaitol was 5 mg/ml in D2O with 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. After adding ∼1.0 mg of Cel44A enzyme, the 1H NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker DRX500 spectrometer at 22.5 °C at 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75, 85, 95, 125, 185, 365, and 665 min after the reaction started. The reference data were measured without enzyme. Crystallization and Data Collection—As a result of the screening using the Hampton Crystal screen, crystal screen 2, PEG/ion screen, grid screen PEG 6000, and grid screen PEG/LiCl, the initial Cel44A crystals were obtained under the conditions of the Hampton Crystal screen 2 kit 27: 0.1 m MES-NaOH, pH 6.5, 10 mm ZnSO4, 25% (w/v) PEG monomethyl ether 550. The screening experiments were performed by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method with a 100-μl reservoir and 1:1 μl protein/reservoir ratio at 293 K. The initial crystallization conditions were optimized to 0.1 m MES-NaOH, pH 5.8, 6 mm ZnSO4, 20% (w/v) PEG monomethyl ether 550 or 14% (w/v) PEG 3350 for wild-type Cel44A. In addition, the conditions for the E186Q mutant included 0.1 m MES-NaOH, pH 5.8, 10 mm ZnSO4, 16–20% (w/v) PEG monomethyl ether 550. In both cases, the hanging drop vapor diffusion method was used with a 1-ml reservoir and 2:2 μl protein/reservoir ratio at 293 K. Crystals grew to about 0.05 × 0.2 × 0.5 mm and were soaked in cryoprotectant containing 20% glycerol when the diffraction data were collected at 100 K. Some wild-type crystals grown in the presence of 14% (w/v) PEG 3350 grew to 0.1 × 0.4 × 0.7 mm. All crystals belonged to space group P212121, and unit-cell parameters are listed in Table 2. The asymmetric unit contained one Cel44A molecule with a Matthews' coefficient VM of 2.09 Å3 Da–1, which suggests that the estimated solvent content is ∼41.0%.TABLE 2Data collection and refinement statisticsWild typeMAD dataWild type with cellohexaoseWild type with cellopentaoseE186Q with cellohexaoseE186Q with cellohexaoseaWith higher concentration.E186Q with cellopentaosePeakRemoteData sets Wavelength (Å)1.00001.28240.98001.00001.00001.00001.00001.0000 Space groupP212121P212121P212121P212121P212121P212121P212121P212121 Unit cell parametersa (Å)48.148.048.047.947.947.950.147.9b (Å)59.259.159.159.159.159.159.359.1c (Å)170.7170.4170.5170.4170.5171.4168.7171.1 Resolution range (Å)50.0-0.96 (0.99-0.96)50.0-1.80 (1.86-1.80)50.0-1.80 (1.86-1.80)50.0-1.75 (1.81-1.75)50.0-1.60 (1.66-1.60)50.0-1.78 (1.84-1.78)50.0-2.80 (2.90-2.80)50.0-2.00 (2.07-2.00) No. of observed reflections1,549,330307,972287,608246,449210,928235,13184,986157,535 No. of unique reflections292,56245,46145,50049,77263,06347,67113,03932,781 Multiplicity5.3 (2.8)6.8 (6.3)6.3 (6.0)5.0 (3.6)3.4 (2.3)4.9 (4.5)6.5 (4.6)4.8 (3.5) Completeness (%)98.9 (91.7)98.8 (96.9)98.7 (97.2)99.7 (97.7)97.1 (85.9)99.8 (98.9)99.3 (94.9)96.9 (81.7) Rsym (%)12.7 (39.8)8.0 (28.0)5.6 (13.9)6.8 (21.6)9.7 (29.0)5.7 (18.5)11.2 (36.9)7.5 (15.9) I/σI22.1 (2.3)21.2 (6.0)23.1 (9.8)21.4 (5.4)13.4 (2.5)21.9 (7.6)16.1 (3.9)12.2 (4.2)Refinement statistics No. of nonhydrogen atoms412441974224421641284084 No. of water molecules57445447653153459 Rwork/Rfree (%)13.3/14.616.1/18.717.0/18.616.2/18.520.4/25.916.5/20.1 Root mean square deviation bond length (Å)0.0170.0080.0070.0050.0070.006 Root mean square deviation bond angle (degrees)1.81.51.51.31.41.3 Ramachandran plotIn most favored regions (%)89.290.289.589.584.289.0In disallowed regions (%)0.00.00.00.00.00.0a With higher concentration.

The crystals were soaked in cryoprotectant containing 1 mm cellohexaose and cellopentaose (Seikagaku Kogyo, Tokyo) for 2 h to introduce substrates. In the case of a high concentration of cellohexaose, the crystals were soaked in cryoprotectant containing cellohexaose at 20% saturation. All data sets were processed using the HKL2000 software package (12Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Phasing, Model Building, and Refinement—The structure of Cel44A was solved by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion method using the zinc ion as an anomalous scatterer for phase calculation. Zinc ions were included in the crystallization conditions and seemed to bind accidentally to the Cel44A molecule as described. The zinc ion was located using SHELXD (13Sheldrick, G. M., Hauptman, H. A., Weeks, C. M., Miller, R., and Usón, I. (2001) International Tables for Crystallography, Vol. F (Arnold, E., and Rossmann, M. G., eds) pp. 333–351, Kluwer Academic Publishers, DordrechtGoogle Scholar) after analyzing the substructure structure factors using SHELXC (14Sheldrick G.M. SHELXC. Göttingen University, Germany2003Google Scholar), and the initial phase calculation and phase improvement by density modification were performed by SHELXE (15Sheldrick G.M. Z. Kristallogr. 2002; 217: 644-650Crossref Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Initial model building was performed with ARP/wARP (16Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar) using the phase calculated by SHELXE. As a result, 499 of the 519 cloned residues were traced automatically with their side chains. The initial model was extended manually with O (17Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar), and restrained refinement was performed using REF-MAC5 (18Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Tanaka I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2006; 39: 57-63Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 22Yao M. Zhou Y. Tanaka I. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The refinement statistics are given in Table 2. Overall Structure—The structure of the wild-type Cel44A was refined to a resolution of 0.96 Å, and the final model is composed of 510 amino acid residues. Three residues at the N terminus and six residues at the C terminus were disordered and no clear electron densities were observed. Three glycerol molecules and two ions, described later, were also identified. The structure shows that Cel44A is composed of two large domains, a β-sandwich domain and a TIM-like barrel domain. The β-sandwich domain consists of residues 7–23 in N-terminal and 418–516 in C-terminal segments. The TIM-like barrel domain is formed by residues 24–417 in the middle part of the enzyme (Fig. 1). The β-sandwich domain consists of 10 strands (β1–β2 and β19–β26) in two twisted β-sheets. The topology of this domain could be easily classified into “the composite domain of GH family 5, 30, 39, 51” in the Structural Classification of Proteins data base (23Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5575) Google Scholar). The TIM-like barrel domain has 19 α-helices and 16 β-strands (α1–α19 and β3–β18). The core part of the TIM-like barrel domain is the TIM barrel fold (α/β)8, except that the first α-helix of a typical (α/β)8 becomes a short loop in the Cel44A structure. There are two additional inserted regions in the TIM-like barrel domain. The two regions are present between the second β-strand (β4) and second α-helix (α5) of (α/β)8 (Ala45–Pro86) and between the third β-strand (β7) and third α-helix (α7) of (α/β)8 (Gln110–Tyr157), respectively (Fig. 1b). The inserted regions make a small domain that includes an imperfect antiparallel β-sheet of six strands and four small α-helices. In the small domain, there is one ion located in the loop on the edge of the imperfect β-sheet and tightly ligated by the side chains of Glu54 and Glu153, the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Asp50 and Tyr155, and two water molecules. From its ligand coordination, this ion seems to be a calcium ion. The zinc ion, which was used as the anomalous scatterer at the phasing step, is bound on the surface of the protein as a regular tetragonal coordination with the side chains of Asp35, Glu401, the main chain carbonyl oxygen atom of Ala395, and the side chain of Glu126 of the adjacent molecule. Three glycerol molecules used as a cryoprotectant were also found at the surface of the protein molecule, one of which was located at a pocket-like hollow as described below. There is a planar and relatively strong unassigned electron density at the center of the TIM-like barrel domain. The shape of the electron density looks like a pyranose ring, but it is not clear. Crystal Structures Complexed with Substrates Cellopentaose and Cellohexaose—Cellohexaose and cellopentaose, which were identified as substrates of Cel44A, were introduced into the wild-type crystals using the crystal soaking technique, and these complex structures were solved at 1.75 and 1.6 Å resolution, respectively. In both cases, the electron density maps showed cellotetraose binding (Fig. 2a). Cellotetraose seems to be one of the reaction products. The locations of four pyranose rings of the molecule clearly show the presence of the four subsites –1 to –4 for recognition of pyranose rings at the nonreducing end. These subsites exist at one of the clefts on the surface of the Cel44A molecule, and some hydrogen bonds between Cel44A protein and substrate are expected, as shown in Fig. 2b. The pyranoses located at –1, –3, and –4 subsites interact with Trp392, Tyr71, and Trp64, respectively. Trp64 and Tyr71 face each other diagonally over the substrate at subsite –3, and Asn46 at subsite –1 is located at the opposite side of the substrate with Trp392. Two residues, Glu186 and Glu359, are located at the reducing end of cellotetraose, and these positions strongly suggest that these two are the catalytic residues. The orientation of 1′-OH of the pyranose at subsite –1 is unusual. It is almost perpendicular to the sugar plane, and this pyranose ring seems to be distorted from the relaxed chair form to the boat form (Fig. 2c). Enzyme Assay of E186Q and E359Q Mutants—In order to confirm the catalytic residues suggested by the structures, E186Q and E359Q mutants were cloned and purified, and enzyme assays for these mutants were performed with the wild type as a reference. The specific activity of purified wild-type Cel44A enzyme was 40 units/mg, and no cellulase activity was detected with both mutants (Fig. 3); these two residues were therefore confirmed to be catalytic residues. E186Q Mutant Structure Complexed with Cellopentaose and Cellohexaose—The crystal structures of E186Q mutant complexed with cellopentaose and cellohexaose were solved at 2.0 and 1.8 Å resolution, respectively. In the case of cellopentaose complex, four pyranose rings of the substrate were clearly observed at subsites –1 to –4 in the electron density map (Fig. 4a). Although the electron density of the nonreducing end pyranose ring is poorer than those of the other four, its existence could be clearly recognized. This nonreducing end pyranose ring sticks out into the solvent region from the surface of the Cel44A molecule, and there were no specific residues for substrate recognition. In this structure, the pyranose ring located at the –1 subsite is in the relaxed chair form, and one water molecule sits at the β-side of the ring. Unlike the wild type, the 1′-OH of the reducing terminal was clearly observed as a normal β-side conformation. In the case of cellohexaose, cellohexaose itself was also observed in the electron density map as with cellopentaose. Four pyranose rings from the reducing end were located at subsites –1 to –4, and other two pyranose rings from the nonreducing end are also observed in the solvent region (Fig. 4b). Interestingly, soaking with a higher concentration of cellohexaose gave different results. In this case, the structure was solved at 2.8 Å resolution, and eight pyranose rings were identified in the obtained electron density map (Fig. 5). The sugar chain stretches over the putative catalytic point, and there were five pyranose rings at the plus side and three at the minus subsites. The appearance of cellooctaose seems to be caused by the superposition of the several cellohexaose binding states. Previously, Sakon et al. (24Sakon J. Adney W.S. Himmel M.E. Thomas S.R. Karplus P.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10648-10660Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) identified cellotetraose in the crystal structure despite using cellobiose, and they concluded that it was the result of reverse reaction. In our case, however, the reverse reaction is impossible, because one of the catalytic residues was mutated, and the inactivity of the mutant was confirmed by biochemical assay as described above. The pyranose rings located at the +3, +4, and +5 subsites interact with Trp327 and Trp331. These two residues are located at one side of the substrate, and Trp327 is located between subsites +3 and +4. The direction of the pyranose ring located at the +1 subsite is almost perpendicular to the pyranose ring plane located at the –1 subsite. In order to connect the pyranose rings at –1 and +1 subsites, the pyranose ring located at the –1 subsite cannot be in the relaxed chair form. The cellooctaose model, in which the pyranose ring of the –1 subsite is the boat form, is fit well into the observed electron density map, as shown in Fig. 5. Determination of the Stereochemical Course of Hydrolysis—To confirm the retention mechanism of hydrolysis, the chronological examinations of 1H NMR measurements of the reaction product was performed for Cel44A. To avoid the overlap of peaks for the reactant and the products, the reduced cellohexaose, cellohexaitol, was used as a substrate. The enzymatic kinetics against cellohexaitol was calculated as km = 4.43 s–1, Kcat = 2362.9 μm from the reaction velocity measurements. Changes of the spectra for the anomeric region during the reaction at 22.5 °C are shown in Fig. 6. The spectra show that the superiority of the amount of β-anomer clearly exists at the early stage of the reaction before the two anomers come to equilibrium. Structure Comparison—Glycoside hydrolase simply hydrolyzes the glycosidic bond, and the GH family includes many enzymes because of the diversity of carbohydrates. Sequence-based classification can be correlated with the structural information, and such analysis has provided useful information for the substrate recognition and the enzymatic reaction mechanisms (25Henrissat B. Davies G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). The combination of structural and amino acid sequence-based information regarding the glycoside hydrolases and other carbohydrate-related proteins, such as glycosyl transferases, polysaccharide lyases, carbohydrate esterases, and CBMs is summarized in the carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy) data base (26Coutinho, P. M., and Henrissat, B. (1999) in Recent Advances in Carbohydrate Bioengineering (Gilbert, H. H., Davies, G., Henrissat, B., and Svensson, B., eds) pp. 3–12, The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UKGoogle Scholar), in which glycoside hydrolases fall into 110 families (GH family) based on their amino acid sequences. Half of the GH families fall into 14 superfamilies termed clans based on their structural similarities, and several features such as reaction mechanisms can be estimated by the classifications. The clan GH-A is the biggest clan superfamily and includes 17 kinds of GH families. GH-A is defined by three features: (i) (α/β)8 TIM barrel fold; (ii) the positions of two catalytic residues, which are located at the ends of the fourth and seventh β strands of the TIM barrel (27Jenkins J. Lo Leggio L. Harris G. Pickersgill R. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), and (iii) the hydrolysis catalytic mechanism of retention. The clan GH-A is also termed as the 4/7 superfamily because of the positions of catalytic residues. The distance between these two residues is ∼5Å. Cel44A can be classified into clan GH-A because it has all three features described above. The distance between two catalytic residues (Glu186 and Glu359) is ∼5.3 Å, and as described below, the retention reaction mechanism of Cel44A was confirmed by 1H NMR. Furthermore, the seven counterparts of eight key residues, which include the catalytic residues and have been identified to be functionally conserved in clan GH-A (24Sakon J. Adney W.S. Himmel M.E. Thomas S.R. Karplus P.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10648-10660Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 28Ryttersgaard C. Lo Leggio L. Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. Larsen S.

Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), are also observed in Cel44A: Arg42, Asn185, Glu186, His283, Tyr285, Glu359, and Trp392. A catalytic triad composed of serine-histidine-glutamate seems also to be common to clan GH-A. The catalytic triad plays a role in lowering the pKa of the acid/base residue and is critical for enzymatic activity (30Shaw A. Bott R. Vonrhein C. Bricogne G. Power S. Day A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cel44A has the counterpart triad, Thr358-His283-Glu186. Cel44A has a β-sandwich domain termed “the composite domain of GH family 5, 30, 39, 51.” All of these four GH families belong to clan GH-A. In these four families, there are 62 crystal structures in CAZy, and six structures shown in Table 3 have both the TIM barrel and the composite domain of GH family 5, 30, 39, 51 (31Czjzek M.

Despite the low level of amino acid identity of 11–16%, Cel44A has several features in common with these six structures. (i) The core topologies of both the TIM barrel and the β-sandwich correspond well, although there are some differences in the small insertion domains and the detailed structures. (ii) The β-sandwich domain is composed of nine strands from the C terminus and one strand from the N-terminal region. The only exception is GH 30 human acid-β-glucosidase, in which an additional two strands are from the N-terminal region. (iii) The spatial relationships between the TIM barrel domain and β-sandwich domain are quite similar. (iv) The spatial positions of the catalytic residues correspond"

In this study, we evaluated the effects of selective activation of the different PKA regulatory subunits type 1A (R1A) and type 2B (R2B) on melanocyte proliferation. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that normal melanocytes lacked R1A protein whereas this subunit was highly expressed in all human melanomas studied (N=20) and in six human melanoma cell lines. Pharmacological activation of the R2 subunits by the cAMP analogue 8-Cl-cAMP inhibited proliferation and increased caspase-3 activity by 68.77+/-10.5 and 72+/-9% respectively, in all cell lines with the exception of the only p53-mutated one. Similar effects were obtained by activating R2 subunits with other analogues and by silencing R1A expression. The antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of 8-Cl-cAMP were comparable to those observed with commonly used antitumoral drugs. Moreover, 8-Cl-cAMP potentiated the effects of these drugs on both cell proliferation and caspase-3 activity. In conclusion, this study first reports that human melanomas are characterized by a high R1/R2 ratio and that pharmacological and genetic manipulations able to revert this unbalanced expression cause significant antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in melanoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W1999391499,"Glucose metabolism is altered in long-lived people and mice. Although it is clear that there is an association between altered glucose metabolism and longevity, it is not known whether this link is causal or not. Our current hypothesis is that decreased fasting glucose utilization may increase longevity by reducing oxygen radical production, a potential cause of aging. We observed that whole body fasting glucose utilization was lower in the Snell dwarf, a long-lived mutant mouse. Whole body fasting glucose utilization may be reduced by a decrease in the production of circulating glucose. Our isotope labeling analysis indicated both gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis were suppressed in Snell dwarfs. Elevated circulating adiponectin may contribute to the reduction of glucose production in Snell dwarfs. Adiponectin lowered the appearance of glucose in the media over hepatoma cells by suppressing gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. The suppression of glucose production by adiponectin in vitro depended on AMP-activated protein kinase, a cell mediator of fatty acid oxidation. Elevated fatty acid oxidation was indicated in Snell dwarfs by increased utilization of circulating oleic acid, reduced intracellular triglyceride content, and increased phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Finally, protein carbonyl content, a marker of oxygen radical damage, was decreased in Snell dwarfs. The correlation between high glucose utilization and elevated oxygen radical production was also observed in vitro by altering the concentrations of glucose and fatty acids in the media or pharmacologic inhibition of glucose and fatty acid oxidation with 4-hydroxycyanocinnamic acid and etomoxir, respectively."

Whereas substrate activation results from communication between an allosteric regulatory site and the active site, the communication among active sites leads to alternating site reactivity (3Sergienko E.A.

Versées W. Gocke D. Pohl M. Steyaert J. Vanderleyden J. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 7626-7633Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the root-associated bacterium Azospirillum brasilense, AbPPDC catalyzes the second step in the conversion of phenylalanine and tryptophan into phenyl- and indole-acetic acid, respectively (8Somers E.

Similar to several PDCs, the AbPPDC displays substrate activation with indolepyruvate and other substrates, characterized by sigmoidal v versus [S] plots (7Spaepen S. Versées W. Gocke D. Pohl M.

These provide new snapshots along the reaction coordinate and unveil the regulatory site and a detailed molecular mechanism for allosteric substrate activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression, Purification, and Preparation of the Complexes—The wild-type AbPPDC was cloned, expressed, and purified as described previously (7Spaepen S.

During purification the enzyme activity was monitored with phenylpyruvate as substrate using the established coupled optical test with horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase and NADH (13Weiss P.M.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2197-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Complexes of PPDC with the inhibitors 3-deaza-ThDP (PPDC-3dThDP) and 2-(1-hydroxyethyl)-3-deaza-ThDP (PPDC-2HE3dThDP) were subsequently obtained by incubating PPDC (purified without addition of ThDP) with 1 mm 3dThDP or 2HE3dThDP for 48 h at 4 °C. Complete exchange of ThDP with the analogues was confirmed by total loss of activity with phenylpyruvate as a substrate. The tertiary complexes with phenylpyruvic acid (PPDC-3dThDP-PPA) and 5-phenyl-2-oxovaleric acid (PPDC-3dThDP-POVA) were then obtained by incubating the PPDC-3dThDP complex with 100 mm phenylpyruvate and 5 mm 5-phenyl-2-oxovaleric acid, respectively.Crystallization and Data Collection—The PPDC-2HE3dThDP complex was crystallized by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Equal volumes of protein solution and precipitant containing 15% polyethylene glycol 4000 (w/v), 10% glycerol (v/v) in 100 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.0, were mixed and equilibrated at 293 K. The crystals were transferred to a cryo-solution containing 20% polyethylene glycol 4000 (w/v), 25% glycerol (v/v) in 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, and transferred immediately to the cryostream.

In a different approach we used unreactive analogues of the coenzyme to trap intermediates in a thiamine-dependent enzyme. 3dThDP is such an unreactive analogue of ThDP, in which the single nitrogen atom of the thiazolium ring is replaced by a carbon (23Mann S. Perez Melero C. Hawksley D. Leeper F.J. Org. Biomol. Chem. 2004; 2: 1732-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although an excellent steric mimic of the cofactor, 3dThDP electrostatically more closely resembles the overall neutral ylide form of thiamine, due to the absence of the positive charge on position 3. AbPPDC in which the naturally occurring ThDP is replaced by 3dThDP proves indeed to be enzymatically inert.The crystal structure of PPDC in complex with 3dThDP (PPDC-3dTHDP) was solved to 3.2-Å resolution. This structure is nearly perfectly superimposable on the structure of the native PPDC holo-enzyme (PPDC-ThDP) that we previously solved, showing that replacement of ThDP with 3dThDP causes no structural rearrangements (12Versées W. Spaepen S. Vanderleyden J. Steyaert J. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 2363-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (see supplemental materials for all structural details). Because PPDC-3dThDP is enzymatically inert we were able to trap the substrates PPA and POVA in its active site and to solve the structures of these ternary complexes to 2.15-Å (PPDC-3dThDP-PPA) and 1.9-Å (PPDC-3dThDP-POVA) resolution, respectively. Chemical synthesis also allows 3dThDP to be substituted on the C2 to obtain stable analogues of covalent reaction intermediates in the reaction cycle (24Leeper F.J. Hawksley D. Mann S. Perez Melero C. Wood M. D.H. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 772-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Using such an analogue we solved the structure of PPDC in complex with 2-(1-hydroxyethyl)-3-deaza-ThDP (PPDC-2HE3dThDP) to 1.85-Å resolution to study the structure of the last covalent intermediate on the reaction coordinate (Fig. 1, intermediate 5).All structures show clear electron density with full occupancy for all ligands bound to both active sites of the homodimer in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 2). In the PPDC-2HE3dThDP structure (Fig. 2b) the density for the 1-hydroxyethyl moiety of the intermediate analogue corresponds to a mixture of the R and S enantiomer at the Cα atom, consistent with the fact that a racemic mixture was used in the co-crystallization. Both enantiomers were modeled with half-occupancy. The overall structure of the active site is very similar in PPDC-3dThDP and PPDC-2HE3dThDP compared with the native holo-enzyme (Fig. 2, a and b). These three structures all exhibit an open active site with the active site loop spanning residues 104-120, completely disordered (see Versées et al. (12Versées W. Spaepen S. Vanderleyden J. Steyaert J. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 2363-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) for a detailed description of the PPDC-ThDP active site). In PPDC-3dThDP-PPA and PPDC-3dThDP-POVA, binding of the substrates is accompanied by a complete structuring of the 104-120 loop. Upon substrate binding, this long loop folds over the active site bringing His112 and His113 into the active site pocket (Fig. 2, c and d). Concomitantly, a second active site loop spanning residues 280-294 of the neighboring subunit of the tight dimer is reorganized, wedging residues Asp282 and Thr283 deeper into the active site pocket. This structural transition causes a H-bond to be formed between His112 of the first loop and Asp282 of the second loop. The reorganization of the 280-294 loop also permits new interactions with the C-terminal helix (e.g. between the side chain of Gln536 and Arg538 and the main chain carbonyls of Asp282 and Ala287 and Ser288, respectively) allowing this helix to bend over the active site.FIGURE 2Close up view of the active sites of PPDC-3dThDP (a), PPDC-2HE3dThDP (b), PPDC-3dThDP-PPA (c), and PPDC-3dThDP-POVA (d).

This site is located at a distance of 18 Å from the active site, at the interface of the PYR, R, and PP domains of each subunit. The substrate molecules in this second site are tightly bound by residues coming from the three domains (Fig. 3). In both structures, the carboxyl group of the substrate forms charged H-bonds with the Arg60 and Arg215 (bidentate) side chains and an additional H-bond to the main chain amide of Ala397. A third arginine residue, Arg214, is involved in a cation-π stacking interaction with the phenyl moiety of the substrate. The 2-keto oxygen of the substrate forms an H-bond with a protein-bound water molecule. Remarkably, this carbonyl oxygen makes very close (unfavorable) contacts with the main chain carbonyls of Met238 (2.9 Å), Arg240 (2.8 Å), and Leu395 (3.0 Å).FIGURE 3The regulatory substrate-binding site of PPDC-3dThDP-POVA: location of the regulatory substrate-binding site at the juncture of the three domains in a PPDC subunit (a), and close up view of the interactions with the regulatory substrate (b). The PYR, R, and PP domains in a are color-coded blue, green, and red, respectively, and the same coloring is maintained in b for the C-atoms of the amino acid residues in the regulatory site. The POVA molecules bound in the active site and in the regulatory site are shown as sticks and colored magenta and orange, respectively.

In this dimer, each subunit adopts the archetypical pyruvate oxidase (POX) fold consisting of the PYR, R, and PP domains (25Muller Y.A. Schulz G.E. Science. 1993; 259: 965-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The secondary complexes PPDC-ThDP, PPDC-3dThDP, and PPDC-2HE3dThDP are very similar in subunit architecture (see supplemental Table 1S for a full list of root mean square deviations upon superposition). Upon substrate binding in the active and regulatory sites, a change in this subunit architecture involving a domain rotation is observed in both ternary complexes (PPDC-3dThDP-PPA and PPDC-3dThDP-POVA). When the PYR and PP domains of PPDC-ThDP and either of the substrate complexes are superimposed, the R domains differ by a rotation of about 12° (Fig. 4). This domain rotation is accompanied by a large rearrangement of active site loop 280-294 of the R domain and the concomitant ordering of active site loop 104-120 of the PYR domain of the neighboring subunit causing the complete closure of the active sites in PPDC-3dThDP-PPA and PPDC-3dThDP-POVA.FIGURE 4Tertiary structure rearrangements upon substrate binding. A superposition of the binary complex PPDC-ThDP and the ternary complex PPDC-3dThDP-POVA is shown, zoomed in on one subunit. Whereas the PYR and PP domains of PPDC-ThDP and PPDC-3dThDP-POVA superimpose nearly perfectly, the R domain rotates by about 12° upon substrate binding. PPDC-ThDP is shown in gray; PPDC-3dThDP-POVA is colored according to the domain, with the PYR, R, PP domains, and the intervening loops colored blue, green, red, and yellow, respectively. The mobile 280-294 loop of the R domain and the 104-120 loop of the PYR domain of the neighboring subunit are colored orange and are indicated by arrows. His112 and His113 of loop 104-120 and Asp282 of loop 280-294 are represented as sticks.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Quaternary Structure Rearrangements upon Substrate Binding—PPDC adopts a homotetrameric assembly in solution (7Spaepen S. Versées W. Gocke D. Pohl M. Steyaert J. Vanderleyden J. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 7626-7633Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In all the crystal structures, the two tight dimers constituting the biological tetramers are related through a 2-fold crystallographic symmetry axis (7Spaepen S. Versées W. Gocke D. Pohl M. Steyaert J. Vanderleyden J. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 7626-7633Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 12Versées W. Spaepen S. Vanderleyden J. Steyaert J. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 2363-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, large differences exist between the tetramer architecture of the binary complexes (PPDC-ThDP, PPDC-3dThDP, and PPDC-2HE3dThDP) and the ternary complexes with substrates bound at the active and the regulatory sites (PPDC-3dThDP-PPA and PPDC-3dThDP-POVA). In the binary complexes, the non-perpendicular arrangement of non-crystallographic axes relating the monomers in the asymmetric unit and the crystallographic axis relating the two dimers results in an asymmetrical tetramer assembly, best described as an asymmetrical dimer of dimers (Fig. 5a). For the ternary complexes the non-crystallographic symmetry axes relating the two subunits in the dimer intersect with the crystallographic axis at an angle of 90°, resulting in a dimer of dimers with pseudo 222 symmetry (Fig. 5b). In going from the asymmetrical dimer of dimers observed for the binary complexes to the symmetrical dimer of dimers of the ternary complexes, one dimer has to be rotated by about 34°, vis à vis to the second dimer. This also has implications for the dimer-dimer interfaces. Whereas the AC and BD interfaces are different in the asymmetrical tetramers (see Fig. 5, for subunit nomenclature) these interfaces are the same for the symmetrical tetramers.FIGURE 5Quaternary structure rearrangements upon substrate binding. The biological tetramers of the binary complex PPDC-2HE3dThDP (a) and the ternary complex PPDC-3dThDP-POVA (b) are depicted with their AB homodimer in the same orientation. The transition from an asymmetrical dimer of dimers in substrate-free PPDC to a symmetrical dimer of dimers in substrate-bound PPDC is accompanied by a 34° rotation of the CD dimer vis à vis the AB dimer. Cofactors and substrates are shown as sticks with the carbon atoms of 3dThDP and 2HE3dTHDP colored yellow and the POVA substrates colored purple. The crystallographic 2-fold axis relating the two dimers is indicated in orange. The two NCS-axes relating the subunits in the asymmetric unit are indicated as blue and red bars.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A Cascade of Conformational Changes Links the Regulatory Substrate-binding Site to the Active Site—Comparison of the binary complexes (PPDC-ThDP, PPDC-3dThDP, and PPDC-2HE3dThDP) with the ternary complexes (PPDC-3dThDP-PPA and PPDC-3dThDP-POVA) uncovers a series of coupled local conformational changes running from the regulatory substrate-binding site to the active site (see Fig. 6). Binding of a substrate molecule in the regulatory site causes a change in side chain conformation of Arg214 leading to the formation of a cation-π interaction with the phenyl group of the substrate. The void left by the arginine side chain gets occupied by the side chain of Leu242. This rear-rangement of Leu242, together with the steric repulsion caused by the binding of the 2-ketoacid moiety of the substrate and the loss of the H-bond between Arg214 and the main chain carbonyl of Arg240, induces a relocation of the entire region between Phe237 and Pro247. The changes in the Phe237-Pro247 segment lead to further structural rearrangements in two distinct branches both leading to the active site. In a first branch, changes at Met238 force the Tyr400 side chain to flip around with a concomitant displacement of its hydroxyl group by 9.8 Å. This conformational change in its turn forces a relocation of Leu109 of the neighboring subunit and the associated structuring of the entire 104-120 loop, bringing the two residues His112 and His113 into the active site. The second branch of the cascade is initiated by the steric clash of Phe237 with Phe285 located on the 280-294 active site loop. This causes a rearrangement of this entire loop, the most obvious change being a 13-Å displacement of the Phe285 side chain. Reorganization of the 280-294 loop (branch 2) liberates the necessary space for the 104-120 loop (branch 1) to enter the active site. Asp282 is also shifted into the active site in this process (a shift of 5 Å) and now forms a H-bond with His112. This cascade of transmitted conformational changes clearly provides a link between substrate binding in the regulatory substrate-binding site and structural changes in the active site.FIGURE 6Intramolecular signal transduction via a cascade of conformational changes. A superposition of the relevant residues of the unactivated binary complex PPDC-ThDP (in gray) with the activated ternary complex PPDC-3dThDP-POVA (in green and blue for residues of the A and B subunit, respectively) is shown. POVA molecules in the regulatory and active site are shown in magenta. Binding of a substrate molecule in the regulatory site causes a rearrangement of Arg214, with concomitant rearrangement of the region between Phe237 and Leu242. These rearrangements are transmitted via Tyr400 and Phe285 to the 104-120 and 280-294 loops that fold over the active site. A H-bond between Asp282 and His112 is hereby formed completing the proposed Asp25-His112-Asp282 catalytic triad. This sterical relay mechanism hence provides a clear link between substrate binding in the regulatory site and catalytic competence in the active site.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONSnapshots along the Catalytic Cycle of a ThDP-dependent Decarboxylase—Multiple studies have been reported dealing with the complex kinetics of ThDP-dependent enzymes. However, a full interpretation of this wealth of data has always been hampered by a lack of structures visualizing the relevant reaction intermediates. Only recently structures of some of these intermediates have been solved: the lactyl-ThDP intermediate in the active site of pyruvate oxidase (intermediate 3, see Fig. 1); the planar enamine intermediate in the active site of pyruvate oxidase and transketolase (intermediate 4B, see Fig. 1) and the non-planar, more carbanion-like form of the latter intermediate in the active site of branched-chain 2-ketoacid dehydrogenase (intermediate 4A, see Fig. 1) (26Wille G.

https://openalex.org/W2057598278,"Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are activated through the kinase cascades of MAPK, MAPK kinase (MAPKK) and MAPKK kinase (MAPKKK). MAPKKKs phosphorylate and activate their downstream MAPKKs, which in turn phosphorylate and activate their downstream MAPKs. MAPKKK proteins relay upstream signals through the MAPK cascades to induce cellular responses. However, the molecular mechanisms by which given MAPKKKs are regulated remain largely unknown. Here, we found that serine-threonine protein kinase 38, STK38, physically interacts with the MAPKKKs MEKK1 and MEKK2 (MEKK1/2). The carboxy terminus, including the catalytic domain, but not the amino terminus of MEKK1/2 was necessary for the interaction with STK38. STK38 inhibited MEKK1/2 activation without preventing MEKK1/2 binding to its substrate, SEK1. Importantly, STK38 suppressed the autophosphorylation of MEKK2 without interfering with MEKK2 dimer formation, and converted MEKK2 from its phosphorylated to its nonphosphorylated form. The negative regulation of MEKK1/2 was not due to its phosphorylation by STK38. On the other hand, stk38 short hairpin RNA enhanced sorbitol-induced activation of MEKK2 and phosphorylation of the downstream MAPKKs, MKK3/6. Taken together, our results indicate that STK38 negatively regulates the activation of MEKK1/2 by direct interaction with the catalytic domain of MEKK1/2, suggesting a novel mechanism of MEKK1/2 regulation."

Some sex hormone receptor modulators with bone sparing effects selectively target estrogen or androgen receptors, whereas others appear more promiscuous, in part through enzymatic metabolism.

Moreover, prostaglandin E2 increased the amount of functional endogenous nuclear C/EBPδ that could bind specifically to a distinct domain ∼1.8-kb upstream from the start site of AKR1C9 transcription.

Hochberg R.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1120-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In this regard, fetal rat osteoblasts rapidly oxidize the synthetic compound estren (4-estren-3α, 17β-diol), which has very low affinity for SSRs, to the potent androgen 19-nortestosterone. This effect was replicated in vitro with cell free extract or with a recombinant protein preparation of the AKR family member AKR1C9, a potent 3-ketosteroid reductase when supplemented with cofactor concentrations that preferentially favor substrate oxidation (12Centrella M. McCarthy T.L. Chang W. Labaree D.C. Hochberg R.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1120-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Other studies suggested that within the context of the intact cell, however, oxidation of 3α- and/or 3β-hydroxysteroids may be driven principally if not exclusively by members of the short chain dehydrogenase reductase/short chain oxidoreductase gene family (5Sherbet D.P. Papari-Zareei M. Khan N. Sharma K.K. Brandmaier A. Rambally S. Chattopadhyay A. Andersson S. Agarwal A.K. Auchus R.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2007; 265–266: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Even so, fetal rat osteoblasts exhibit abundant mRNA levels of AKR1C9 (12Centrella M. McCarthy T.L. Chang W. Labaree D.C. Hochberg R.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1120-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the predominant rat AKR with 3-ketosteroid reductase potential (3Penning T.M. Jin Y. Heredia V.V. Lewis M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 85: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This predicted that in addition to steroid oxidation, osteoblasts can synthesize bioactive reduced 3-hydroxysteroids with conformations analogous to some estrogen receptor (ER) agonists. Mechanisms that regulate 3-ketosteroid levels locally within the skeleton could have important implications for native steroid metabolism, as well as for exposure to synthetic compounds used for sex steroid hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to prevent osteoporosis. The AKR1C9 gene promoter has been cloned, and sequence analysis identified a variety of possible regulatory cis-acting elements. To date, only few of these elements have been addressed, and essentially all that is known derives from studies in liver cells where the enzyme was initially thought to have its primary activity (13Lin H.K. Penning T.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4105-4113PubMed Google Scholar, 14Hou Y.-T. Lin H.-K. Penning T.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 15Hung C.F.

Tibolone (7-methyl-17-ethynyl-19-norandrostan-5 (10)en-3-one), a 3-ketosteroid androgen receptor (AR) agonist with potential HRT efficacy, has complex effects in vivo through AR, ER, and progesterone receptor (PR), in part through rapid conversion to other metabolites in the organism. Reduction of tibolone at position 3 in steroid ring A by AKR1C family members produces the ER agonists 3α-hydroxytibolone and 3β-hydroxytibolone (16Kloosterboer H.J.

In this study we assessed the activation potential of tibolone on ERα-dependent gene induction in rat osteoblasts, using it as a model for endogenous 3-ketosteroid reductase activity in bone. Based on previously unrecognized hormone interactions and on sequence analyses, we also assessed AKR1C9 expression and gene promoter activity in these cells to define molecular mechanisms that drive its expression. Our results show that osteoblasts, through inherent 3-ketosteroid reductase activity, can metabolize steroid substrates into potent estrogens or possibly to limit their androgenic activity. They further predict that hormone-dependent changes in 3-ketosteroid reductase expression by osteoblasts could oppose their endogenous 3α-/3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase oxidation potential, ultimately regulating the levels of ER or AR agonists within the skeletal tissue environment. Cells—Primary osteoblast-enriched cultures were isolated from parietal bones of 22-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat fetuses (Charles River Breeding Laboratories), as approved by the Yale Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Sutures were dissected, and cells were released by five sequential collagenase digestions. Cells pooled from the last three digestions express features of differentiating osteoblasts, including high levels of runt homology domain nuclear factor 2 (Runx2), parathyroid hormone receptor, type I collagen synthesis, and alkaline phosphatase. They also increase osteocalcin expression in response to vitamin D3, exhibit differential sensitivity to transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), bone morphogenetic protein 2, and various prostaglandins (PGs), and form mineralized nodules under conditions promoting long term differentiation in vitro. Cells were plated at 4,000/cm2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml ascorbic acid and grown for 6 days before transfection or treatment, which was performed in serum-free medium (19McCarthy T.L.

Transfections—Promoter-reporter fusion plasmids, gene expression plasmids, or empty parental vectors, were pretitrated for optimal expression efficiency and transfected with reagent LT1 (Mirus). Cultures at 70% confluence were exposed to an optimal amount of reporter plasmid (75 ng per cm2) or expression plasmid (10–75 ng per cm2) in medium supplemented with 4% serum. Cells were cultured for 6–72 h and treated in serum-free medium as indicated in the figures. The cells were rinsed and lysed, and supernatants were analyzed for reporter gene activity and corrected for protein content. To account for competition among plasmids for limiting transcriptional components, control cultures were transfected with a compensating amount of empty vector. Transfection efficiency was assessed in parallel in cells transfected with positive and negative reporter plasmids as previously described (23Ji C. Casinghino S. Chang D.J. Chen Y. Javed A. Ito Y.

HPLC—To assess tibolone metabolites, an elution profile for purified 3H-labeled tibolone and its known conversion products (17Steckelbroeck S. Oyesanmi B. Jin Y. Lee S.H. Kloosterboer H.J.

Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 1702-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) was established by HPLC. Briefly, [3H]tibolone, [3H]Δ4-tibolone, [3H]3α-hydroxytibolone, and [3H]3β-hydroxytibolone were chromatographed individually on C18 μBondapak. Samples were applied in 60% methanol and eluted at 1 ml/min for 5 min, followed by a 20-min linear gradient to achieve 65% methanol, and continued at 65% methanol for 15 additional minutes. Elution was monitored by liquid scintillation counting. A combined elution profile of the four readily separated compounds is shown in the upper panel of Fig. 2A, where tibolone migrates at 25 min, Δ4-tibolone at 17 min, 3α-hydroxytibolone at 20 min, and 3β-hydroxytibolone at 28 min. Osteoblasts were then incubated with the 0.5 μCi of [3H]tibolone or its derivatives for 0, 2, 6, or 24 h. Each culture medium was combined with a methanol extract from its cell layer and extracted with hexane. The aqueous fraction was ether extracted and steroids in the ether extract were analyzed by HPLC as described above. Extraction efficiency and recovery was determined with reference to 2 μg of unlabeled Δ4-tibolone as an internal UV light (240 nm) absorbent recovery standard. All tibolone and tibolone derivatives used in these studies were generously supplied by Organon NV, Oss, The Netherlands. mRNA Analysis—Total RNA was extracted with acid-guanidine-monothiocyanate, precipitated with isopropyl alcohol, and dissolved in sterile water. AKR1C9 mRNA was assessed by fractionation on a 1.5% agarose/2.2 m formaldehyde gel, blotting on charged nylon, and hybridization with 32P-labeled cDNA encompassing a 0.6-kb HindIII/EcoRI restriction fragment (bp 251–854) of the coding region of rat AKR1C9 (12Centrella M. McCarthy T.L. Chang W. Labaree D.C. Hochberg R.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1120-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). rRNA was assessed by ethidium staining of a parallel gel. Radiolabeled products were examined by autoradiography and densitometry (39McCarthy T.L. Pham T.H. Knoll B.I. Centrella M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; (in press)Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Analysis (EMSA)—Double-strand oligonucleotide probes comprising AKR1C9 promoter fragments that define three separate C/EBP binding sites (Table 1) were labeled with [32P]dCTP and Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, and gel-purified. Nuclear protein extracts (3 μg) from control or PGE2 induced cells were preincubated with either no addition, a 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide (Table 1), nonimmune IgG, or antiserum to C/EBPδ or C/EBPβ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and then supplemented with 32P-labeled probe. Protein-bound DNA complexes were resolved on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and examined by autoradiography (39McCarthy T.L. Pham T.H. Knoll B.I. Centrella M. Mol.

Sex Steroid Receptor-dependent Gene Expression by Tibolone in Osteoblasts—SSR agonists induce direct and indirect effects on gene expression in osteoblasts in relatively receptor restricted ways (12Centrella M. McCarthy T.L. Chang W. Labaree D.C. Hochberg R.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1120-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 29McCarthy T.L. Chang W.-Z. Liu Y. Centrella M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43121-43129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Unlike the focused effects of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or 17β-estradiol (17βE), exposure to tibolone produced direct, dose-dependent effects through both AR and ERα in osteoblasts. The effect of tibolone closely paralleled the AR-specific response to DHT through ARE (Fig. 1A, upper panel) and the ERα-specific response to 17βE through ERE (Fig. 1A, lower panel). In addition, like 17βE (12Centrella M. McCarthy T.L. Chang W. Labaree D.C. Hochberg R.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1120-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 29McCarthy T.L. Chang W.-Z. Liu Y. Centrella M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43121-43129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), tibolone enhanced the activity of the essential osteoblast transcription factor Runx2 in combination with ERα but not AR (Fig. 1B). These results revealed that tibolone, itself an AR selective agonist (16Kloosterboer H.J. Maturitas. 2004; 48: S30-S40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), achieved ERα agonist potential in the presence of metabolically active osteoblasts. Osteoblasts Rapidly Convert Tibolone to 3α-Hydroxytibolone and 3β-Hydroxytibolone—Preliminary studies with purified [3H]tibolone or its know derivatives [3H]Δ4-tibolone, [3H]3α-hydroxytibolone, or [3H]3β-hydroxytibolone, established an elution profile from C18 μBondapak by standard reversed phase HLPC methods (upper panel, Fig. 2A). Within 2–6 h of incubation with osteoblasts, virtually all of the [3H]tibolone was metabolized. At least 25% of [3H]tibolone was lost to polar, water soluble metabolites, and the remainder was recovered primarily as [3H]3α-hydroxytibolone, and to a much lesser extent, [3H]3β-hydroxytibolone (lower panels, Fig. 2A). Parallel studies with the [3H]tibolone derivatives showed that [3H]Δ4-tibolone was stable throughout 24 h of incubation, whereas a large fraction of [3H]3β-hydroxytibolone was converted to [3H]3α-hydroxytibolone, presumably by way of 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-dependent oxidation and subsequent 3-ketosteroid reductase re-reduction. A significant portion of [3H]3α-hydroxytibolone was also lost to water soluble metabolites, and no more than 1% of either [3H]3α-hydroxytibolone or [3H]3β-hydroxytibolone appeared as [3H]Δ4-tibolone (data not shown). Thus, through conversion or inter-conversion, 3α-hydroxytibolone accounted for the primary tibolone metabolite, albeit some was lost to other polar, but presently unknown breakdown products. Moreover, these results establish with certainty that osteoblasts express significant 3-ketosteroid reductase activity in addition to their oxidative 3α/β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity (12Centrella M. McCarthy T.L. Chang W. Labaree D.C. Hochberg R.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1120-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As expected from chemical structure and receptor binding studies (16Kloosterboer H.J. Maturitas. 2004; 48: S30-S40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), tibolone and Δ4-tibolone induced AR-dependent gene expression through ARE comparable to the effect of DHT. 3α-Hydroxytibolone had no detectable effect, and 3β-hydroxytibolone had more modest activity, presumably because of its oxidized intermediate status during interconversion to 3α-hydroxytibolone (Fig. 2B, upper panel). Analogously, tibolone, 3α-hydroxytibolone and 3β-hydroxytibolone all potently induced ERα-dependent gene expression through ERE comparable to the effect of 17βE (Fig. 2B, lower panel). Also, like 17βE (29McCarthy T.L. Chang W.-Z. Liu Y. Centrella M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43121-43129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), tibolone enhanced the stimulatory effect of TGF-β on Smad-dependent gene promoter activity in ERα-expressing osteoblasts (Fig. 2C). Thus tibolone acted as a potent agonist for ERα in osteoblasts resulting from its rapid reduction to 3-hydroxytibolone metabolites. When osteoblasts were treated with tibolone in the presence of two different oxidoreductase inhibitors, quercetin or phenolphthalein (41Rosemond M.J. St John-Williams L. Yamaguchi T. Fujishita T. Walsh J.S. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2004; 147: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 42Atalla A. Breyer-Pfaff U. Maser E. Xenobiotica. 2000; 30: 755-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), its ERα activation potential was severely reduced. For presently unexplained reasons, each inhibitor enhanced basal ERα-dependent gene expression in the absence of ligand, but the significant stimulatory effect of tibolone was nonetheless reduced by ∼70% (Fig. 2D). Consistent with in vitro receptor binding (16Kloosterboer H.J. Maturitas. 2004; 48: S30-S40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), tibolone and Δ4-tibolone also potently enhanced progesterone response element-driven gene expression through PR-B in osteoblasts, 3β-hydroxytibolone had more modest activity, and 3α-hydroxytibolone had no significant effect. By contrast to results with PR-B, highly attenuated effects occurred through PR-A (supplemental Fig. S1). This pattern of agonist-dependent activity through PR-B was analogous to their AR-dependent effects through ARE in osteoblasts, and to their biochemical effects in human endometrial cancer-derived cells (43Blok L.J. De Ruiter P.E. Kuhne E.C. Hanekamp E.E. Grootegoed J.A. Smid-Koopman E. Gielen S.C. De Gooyer M.E. Kloosterboer H.J. Burger C.W. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

https://openalex.org/W2033302851,"The calcium dependence of cobalamin (Cbl) binding to the BtuB protein of Escherichia coli and the reversibility of its function in the transport of Cbl across the outer membrane have been examined. The results show that the two calcium-binding sites in BtuB that were identified previously by others are responsible for the calcium dependence of high affinity Cbl binding. The affinity of the pure BtuB protein for Cbl was ∼1000-fold higher in the presence of saturating levels of calcium than in its absence. The affinities of BtuB for both Cbl and calcium were decreased by insertion of alanine residues at position 51 of the mature protein and were increased by several mutations and deletions in the TonB box. Experiments on the uptake of Cbl into the periplasmic space showed that this process is reversible and that the exit of Cbl back into the medium does not require the protonmotive force. Our interpretation of these results is that the role of the TonB-ExbB-ExbD complex, potentiated by the protonmotive force, is to reduce the affinity of the Cbl-binding site, thus increasing the rate of Cbl release into the periplasmic space. The evidence also indicates that access of the Cbl-binding site of BtuB to the periplasmic space does not require removal of the hatch domain from the barrel.

Our interpretation of these results is that the role of the TonB-ExbB-ExbD complex, potentiated by the protonmotive force, is to reduce the affinity of the Cbl-binding site, thus increasing the rate of Cbl release into the periplasmic space. The evidence also indicates that access of the Cbl-binding site of BtuB to the periplasmic space does not require removal of the hatch domain from the barrel. The BtuB protein in the outer membrane of Escherichia coli is the cobalamin (Cbl) 3The abbreviations used are: Cbl, cobalamin; pmf, protonmotive force; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; CN[57Co]Cbl, 57Co-labeled cyanocobalamin. 3The abbreviations used are: Cbl, cobalamin; pmf, protonmotive force; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; CN[57Co]Cbl, 57Co-labeled cyanocobalamin. carrier in an active transport process that pumps Cbl from the external medium into the periplasmic space. The mature protein consists of 594 amino acid residues folded into two major domains. The C-terminal 458 residues form a 22-stranded β-barrel with connecting loops that extend variously on either side of the membrane. The N-terminal 136 residues form a globular domain located within and potentially occluding the lumen of the barrel (1Heller K. Kadner R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 904-908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Chimento D.P. Kadner R.J. Wiener M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 999-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Similar structures are found in the outer membrane proteins FecA, FepA, and FhuA, which serve as the carriers for the ferric siderophores ferric dicitrate, ferric enterobactin, and ferric ferrichrome, respectively. The Cbl-binding site of BtuB consists primarily of interactions with residues on the external loops and nearby residues in the hatch (2Chimento D.P. Kadner R.J. Wiener M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 999-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We know from a previous study that the rate of energy-dependent Cbl transport across the outer membrane is greater than the off-rate observed for high affinity Cbl binding by BtuB (3Bradbeer C. Kenley J.S. Di Masi D.R. Leighton M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1347-1352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the potentiation mechanism must involve an increased off-rate (lowered affinity) for Cbl when the binding site is exposed on the periplasmic side of the membrane. The energy source is the protonmotive force (pmf) of the inner membrane, which is coupled to Cbl transport through interactions with the TonB-ExbB-ExbD protein complex that is anchored in the inner membrane (4Bradbeer C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3146-3150Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 5Higgs P.L. Larsen R.A. Postle K. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have indicated a direct interaction between the TonB protein and the TonB box (residues 6–12) of BtuB (6Heller K.J. Kadner R.J. Gunther K. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 64: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 7Cadieux N. Bradbeer C. Kadner R.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5954-5961Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We have shown previously (8Bradbeer C. Reynolds P.R. Bauler G.M. Fernandez M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2520-2523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bradbeer C. Gudmundsdottir A. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4919-4926Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) that high affinity Cbl binding (KD ∼ 1 nm) by BtuB is calcium-dependent and that calcium binding is dependent upon Cbl. The affinity of BtuB for Cbl is greatly reduced by suboptimal calcium concentrations. The structure for BtuB derived from x-ray studies shows two calcium-binding sites that are formed primarily from a group of 5 aspartate residues quite close to the Cbl-binding site (2Chimento D.P. Kadner R.J. Wiener M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 999-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that mutagenesis of these residues results in impaired calcium and Cbl binding. We also show here that calcium and Cbl binding is modified by changes both in the TonB box and in other regions of the hatch, supporting our view that the intraprotein signaling that thus exists between the N terminus and the distant Cbl- and calcium-binding sites has an essential role in this transport process. We also present evidence that the exposure of the Cbl-binding site of BtuB to the periplasm does not require either TonB or the pmf. In addition, BtuB can catalyze the transport of Cbl from the periplasm to the exterior of the cell in the absence as well as in the presence of the pmf. Our results show that the exposure of the Cbl-binding site of BtuB to the periplasmic space does not require removal of the hatch from the lumen of the barrel. E. coli Strains and Plasmids—The strains and plasmids used are listed in Table 1. The strain used for plasmid construction and maintenance was JM109 (Stratagene).

The pAG1 plasmid carrying the wild-type btuB gene in pUC8 has been described previously (11Gudmundsdottir A. Bell P.E. Lundrigan M.D. Bradbeer C. Kadner R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6526-6533Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). BtuB mutants were constructed using a two-step PCR method as described previously (12Cadieux N. Kadner R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10673-10678Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). All mutagenic primers incorporated a silent restriction site that was used to facilitate screening. PCR fragments containing the mutations were cloned back into pAG1 using restriction fragment exchange, and all changes were verified by nucleotide sequencing. Transfer of the mutations onto the chromosome of RK8452 used the λInCh system, which is compatible with pUC plasmids (13Boyd D. Weiss D.S. Chen J.C. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Allelic replacement was verified by PCR amplification of the btuB locus, followed by restriction digest to confirm the presence of the mutated allele and loss of the Km cassette. Growth and Fractionation of Cells—The cells were grown to mid-log phase at 37 °C on the minimal medium described by Davis and Mingioli (14Davis B.D. Mingioli E.S. J. Bacteriol. 1950; 60: 17-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), supplemented with glucose (10 mg/ml) and, as required, with amino acids and antibiotics. For the preparation of cell envelopes, the washed cells were suspended in either 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.1) or 10 mm potassium MOPS (pH 7.1) and broken by passage through a French pressure cell. Residual whole cells were removed by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min, followed by 7000 × g for 7 min. Envelope particles were sedimented by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 60 min and resuspended in an appropriate buffer at a concentration of ∼4 mg/ml protein. Protein was determined by the Lowry method using fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin as the standard (24Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assay of Cobalamin Binding and Transport—The methods have been described previously and involved the use of 57Co-labeled cyanocobalamin (CN[57Co]Cbl), filtration through Millipore filters, and liquid scintillation counting (15Bradbeer C. Woodrow M.L. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 128: 99-104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Uptake of Cbl in cells containing haploid BtuB is expressed as picomoles of Cbl/ml of cells with A660 = 0.6, which is roughly equivalent to 1 × 109 cells. Such an amount of cells, with wild-type BtuB and grown in the absence of Cbl, contains 0.3–0.5 pmol of BtuB. Whole envelopes from such cells bind ∼4–7 pmol of Cbl/mg of protein. The calculated theoretical specific activity for pure BtuB would be 15.0575 nmol of Cbl bound per mg of protein. CN[57Co]Cbl was prepared as described (7Cadieux N. Bradbeer C. Kadner R.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5954-5961Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The precise experimental conditions for each experiment are given in the figure legends. Specific free Ca2+ concentrations were generated with calcium EGTA buffers using the methods of Portzehl et al. (16Portzehl H. Caldwell P.C. Ruegg J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 79: 581-591PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows a representation of the structure of BtuB as determined by Chimento et al. (2Chimento D.P. Kadner R.J. Wiener M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 999-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), with the near side of the β-barrel cut away and the domains that we have examined in this study highlighted. Pure BtuB Protein—We showed previously the interdependence and reciprocal relationship between the binding of Cbl and calcium by BtuB (8Bradbeer C. Reynolds P.R. Bauler G.M. Fernandez M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2520-2523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bradbeer C. Gudmundsdottir A. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4919-4926Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This is confirmed in Fig. 2 with a sample of the pure BtuB protein (a gift from David Cafiso, Chemistry Department, University of Virginia). In the presence of enough calcium to fully saturate the calcium-binding sites, the KD for Cbl was ∼5 nm. However, in the absence of calcium, the KD for Cbl was ∼5 μm. Calcium Cage Mutations—The structure of BtuB derived from x-ray analysis shows two calcium-binding sites that are close to each other and to the Cbl-binding site (2Chimento D.P. Kadner R.J. Wiener M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 999-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These calcium atoms are contained in a cage that consists primarily of 5 aspartate residues. Fig. 3 shows the effects on Cbl binding of changing these aspartates to other amino acid residues. The experimental material consisted of whole envelopes from cells containing plasmids bearing the mutant BtuB species. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the expression of BtuB was essentially the same in all of the strains. The concentration of Cbl used was enough to give at least 80% saturation of high affinity wild-type Cbl-binding sites. Calcium EGTA buffers were used to generate three different free calcium concentrations: 3 nm, which is too low for appreciable Cbl binding by wild-type BtuB, and 3 and 300 μm, both of which would fully saturate the wild-type calcium-binding sites. Single replacements of the aspartates with arginines at positions 179, 193, 195, and 230 almost completely eliminated Cbl binding at all three calcium concentrations. Arginine at position 241 showed less of an effect on Cbl binding and was consistent with an estimated KD for calcium binding of that strain of ∼5 μm, compared with the wild-type value of ∼30 nm. Substitution of glutamates for the aspartates had less of an effect on Cbl binding, with amounts bound of ∼10–30% of the wild-type values. Changing the aspartates to serines completely eliminated Cbl binding at positions 195 and 230, but ∼20–40% activity was retained at positions 179 and 193. Our results indicate that of the two calcium atoms bound, that designated calcium 1 by Chimento et al. (2Chimento D.P. Kadner R.J. Wiener M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 999-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) may be more important for Cbl binding than calcium 2. Asp179 is required only for the calcium 1 site, and its change to arginine completely eliminated high affinity Cbl binding. In contrast, Asp241 is required only for the calcium 2 site, and its change to arginine had a much lesser effect on Cbl binding. Fig. 4 shows the rates of transport of Cbl by cells that contained single copies of the wild-type or mutant btuB gene. In this experiment, each mutant contained arginine instead of aspartate at the specified position. They all showed measurable rates of Cbl transport, but the rates varied from a low of ∼4% of the wild-type value for D195R to a high of ∼40% for cells containing the D241R mutation. The results shown in Figs. 3 and 4 confirm that the calcium-binding sites shown in the x-ray crystal structure are the ones that our previous functional studies had shown to be required for the high affinity binding of Cbl by BtuB (8Bradbeer C. Reynolds P.R. Bauler G.M. Fernandez M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2520-2523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bradbeer C. Gudmundsdottir A. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4919-4926Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Insertions at Position 50—We showed previously (9Bradbeer C. Gudmundsdottir A. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4919-4926Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) that a BtuB species that lacked the first 11 N-terminal residues and contained an aspartate-proline dipeptide between what had been residues 50 and 51 of the intact mature BtuB had a much reduced affinity for calcium. However, its affinity for Cbl was normal when the calcium concentration was increased to give full saturation of the reduced affinity calcium-binding sites. We also deduced that a second BtuB species that lacked the first 49 N-terminal residues showed no calcium-dependent, high affinity Cbl binding but still had the low affinity binding of Cbl that is characteristic of wild-type BtuB in the absence of calcium. We examined the effects on Cbl binding by the insertion of 1–5 alanines between residues 50 and 51. The results from cell envelope preparations in which BtuB expression was greatly amplified are shown in Fig. 5. Cbl binding was measured at Cbl concentrations of 21 nm and 18 μm in the presence of either 3 or 300 μm free Ca2+. A Cbl concentration of 21 nm and either calcium concentration would enable wild-type BtuB to show close to maximal high affinity binding. A Cbl concentration of 18 μm should allow close to maximal low affinity Cbl binding whether calcium was present or not. The results indicate that the insertion of a single alanine reduced the affinity for calcium, but full activity of high affinity Cbl binding was obtained at the higher calcium concentration. Increasing the number of inserted alanines eventually eliminated high affinity binding. Low affinity Cbl binding was reduced to a much lesser extent, although in each case, the higher level of calcium gave higher Cbl binding. The primary conclusion from these measurements is that increasing the number of inserted alanines at position 50 decreased the affinity of BtuB for both Cbl and calcium. None of these mutants showed measurable Cbl transport under our usual assay conditions but were able to utilize Cbl for growth in the absence of methionine in the medium. The single and double alanine insertion mutants grew on solid media in the presence of 0.1 nm Cbl; the triple insertion mutant required 5 nm Cbl; and the mutants with either 4 or 5 inserted alanines required 50 nm Cbl. Mutations in the TonB Box—We showed previously (11Gudmundsdottir A. Bell P.E. Lundrigan M.D. Bradbeer C. Kadner R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6526-6533Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) that the L8P and V10P mutations in the TonB box eliminated Cbl transport across the outer membrane but had little, if any, effect on high affinity Cbl binding. We looked further at nine TonB box mutations and found that some have profound effects upon the calcium dependence of high affinity Cbl binding. All except A12D lacked Cbl transport. The experimental material consisted of whole cell envelopes from strains containing BtuB on a plasmid. Enough Cbl was contained in the reaction mixtures to ensure saturation of normal high affinity binding. Measurements were made over a range of free Ca2+ concentrations from 1 nm to 300 μm. The major part of the results from eight strains is shown in Fig. 6, where Cbl binding is expressed as a percentage of the maximal values obtained by each. In seven of these strains, the maximal amounts of Cbl bound ranged from 885 to 1212 pmol/mg of protein. The wild-type envelopes had a specific activity of 1086 pmol of Cbl/mg of protein. Envelopes from the ΔBox mutant contained less BtuB, as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and had a correspondingly lower specific activity of 496 pmol of Cbl bound per mg of protein. In all cases, there was a close correlation between the amount of BtuB expressed and the maximal observed amount of Cbl binding. All of these mutants showed what we have concluded to be increased affinities for calcium. These increases were comparatively modest for the point mutations L8P, V10G, and A12D. The affinities for calcium of the other mutants, V10P, 7,10Box, AlaBox, and ΔBox, plus two others (V9G and Δ1–11), for which the data are not shown, were all apparently very high, with better than 80% of maximal Cbl binding at the lowest calcium concentration used. Our lack of data at free calcium concentrations below 1 nm means that we cannot be certain whether these strains really have very high affinities for calcium or whether high affinity Cbl binding in these mutants has actually become independent of a calcium requirement. Cobalamin binding by the Δ1–11 mutant had >80% of maximal Cbl binding at 1 nm free calcium, whereas a previously described mutant (9Bradbeer C. Gudmundsdottir A. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4919-4926Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) that also lacked the first 11 amino acid residues but, in addition, contained an aspartyl-prolyl dipeptide between residues 50 and 51 required 10 μm free calcium for half-maximal Cbl binding. We have also shown (11Gudmundsdottir A. Bell P.E. Lundrigan M.D. Bradbeer C. Kadner R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6526-6533Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) that whole cells and envelopes from these TonB box mutants have slower off-rates for bound Cbl, indicating higher affinities for Cbl compared with the wild type. These results emphasize how sensitive Cbl and calcium binding is to structural changes in the hatch domain of the BtuB protein. Fig. 7 shows the rates of release of bound CN[57Co]Cbl from whole cells and from envelope particles upon the addition of a large excess of unlabeled CNCbl. Both preparations were from the same lot of cells that contained ∼200 times the haploid amount of wild-type BtuB. The envelope particles were prepared by cell breakage with a French pressure cell and differential centrifugation and were not exposed to any detergent or to EGTA or EDTA. The reaction mixtures and incubation conditions were identical in each case and included 2 mm 2,4-dinitrophenol to prevent any Cbl transport. The expression of TonB was not amplified so that these measurements were done effectively in the absence of both TonB and the pmf. The rate of Cbl release was much faster from the envelope particles than from the whole cells. We interpret these results as indicating that, even in the absence of TonB and the pmf, the occupied Cbl-binding site fluctuates between exposure to both the exterior of the cell and the periplasm. The rate of Cbl release from the envelope particles was still slower than the previously observed rates of active transport of Cbl across the outer membrane (3Bradbeer C. Kenley J.S. Di Masi D.R. Leighton M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1347-1352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We showed previously (17Reynolds P.R. Mottur G.P. Bradbeer C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4313-4319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that btuC mutants are incapable of Cbl transport across the inner membrane of E. coli and accumulate Cbl to high concentrations in the periplasmic space. This permitted us to study transport of Cbl across the outer membrane in isolation and showed that this was an active transport process that was potentiated by interactions requiring the pmf and the TonB protein. The transport of labeled Cbl quickly reached a plateau, indicating equality between the exit rate and the in rate, and the label was rapidly released back into the medium upon the addition of a large excess of unlabeled Cbl. Here, we examined the exit of Cbl in more detail. The results shown in Fig. 8 indicate that the pmf is not essential for BtuB-dependent Cbl transport from the periplasm to the external medium and argue against any mechanism for this transport process that requires the TonB- and pmf-dependent removal of the hatch from the barrel to permit access of the Cbl-binding site to the periplasm. The experimental cells were btuC and btuC/atp mutants. Cells that lack a functional ATP synthase are unable to generate the pmf when the electron transport chain is blocked by cyanide. In two of the reaction mixtures shown in Fig. 8, cyanide was added at the beginning of the incubation, but inhibition of Cbl transport was observed only in the atp strain, confirming the dependence of this transport system upon the pmf. In the other reaction mixtures, the uptake of CN[57Co]Cbl was allowed to proceed for 25 min, at which point a variety of reagents were added, and the retention of 57Co-labeled Cbl by the cells was followed. The addition of a large excess of unlabeled Cbl resulted in a rapid loss of label from both strains, indicating the essential reversibility of this transport process. The addition of cyanide, which would eliminate the pmf only in the btuC/atp double mutant, resulted in the loss of label only from that strain, whereas the addition of dinitrophenol, which would abolish the pmf in both strains, released the label from both. Finally, when the labeled Cbl outside the cell was removed by the addition of the mammalian Cbl-binding protein non-intrinsic factor, the label was also released rapidly from the cells. It should be noted that the rate of release of Cbl from the cells was somewhat more rapid in the presence of the pmf (addition of either unlabeled Cbl or the non-intrinsic factor) than in its absence. In any case, the results show that Cbl can flow down its concentration gradient from a high concentration in the periplasm to a low external concentration. The purpose of this study was to gain further insight into the mechanisms by which the TonB-ExbB-ExbD complex in the inner membrane of E. coli and the pmf potentiate the BtuB-dependent active transport of cobalamin across the outer membrane. From a previous study of ours (12Cadieux N. Kadner R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10673-10678Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), as well as a study on the analogous TonB-dependent transport of ferric siderophores (18Skare J.T. Ahmer B.M. Seachord C.L. Darveau R.P. Postle K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16302-16308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is evident that there is a direct interaction between the C-terminal region of TonB and the TonB box part of the outer membrane transporters. The N-terminal region of TonB forms a complex with ExbB and ExbD that is embedded in the inner membrane and must provide a channel for the movement of protons from the periplasm into the cytoplasm. This movement presumably causes some sort of conformational change in the C-terminal region of TonB that stimulates the release of the transportable substrate from its outer membrane carrier into the periplasm. TonB is able to bind to the TonB box region of BtuB in the absence of energization by the pmf, but the catalyzed release of Cbl into the periplasm requires the pmf. The structures of BtuB and the ferric siderophore carriers FhuA, FepA, and FecA are basically the same and consist of a β-barrel embedded in the outer membrane, the potential channel of which seems to be occluded by an N-terminal region of ∼150 amino acid residues that is commonly called the hatch. In BtuB, residues 6–12 form the TonB box. Fig. 1 shows a cut-away representation of the structure of the BtuB protein as determined Chimento et al. (2Chimento D.P. Kadner R.J. Wiener M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 999-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), with some of the parts discussed in this study highlighted. Further x-ray diffraction studies on crystals containing both BtuB and the C-terminal 93 residues of TonB showed that the unenergized interaction of these two proteins results in the conversion of the TonB box into a β-strand that aligns itself parallel to, and in contact with, the three-stranded β-sheet of TonB (19Shultis D.D. Purdy M.D. Banchs C.N. Wiener M.C. Science. 2006; 312: 1396-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Superficially, the structures of BtuB and the other TonB-dependent, outer membrane transporters look like porins that have their aqueous channels occluded by hatch domains. This has led to the suggestion that they are selective, “ligand-gated porins” and that their mechanism of action involves substrate binding, followed by the TonB/pmf-potentiated removal of the hatch to expose the ligand-binding site to the periplasmic space (20Ma L. Kaserer W. Annamalai R. Scott D.C. Jin B. Jiang X. Xiao Q. Maymani H. Massis L.M. Ferreira L.C. Newton S.M.C. Klebba P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 397-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We object to the designation “ligand-gated porin” because such a mechanism is not capable of active transport, i.e. the movement of a substrate against its concentration gradient, and Cbl is clearly actively transported across the outer membrane. Similarly, we also dislike the designation “TonB-gated transporters” (21Postle K. Science. 2002; 295: 1658-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) because it implies that TonB is required for access of the bound ligand to the periplasmic space, whereas in the case of Cbl transport, such access is not TonB-dependent. Rather, the function of TonB is to increase the rate of dissociation of bound Cbl. Our view is that the BtuB protein on its own is probably capable of facilitated diffusion of Cbl across the outer membrane. However, to capture enough Cbl from the very low concentrations found naturally, it needs a high affinity Cbl-binding site. Although such high affinity binding is successful in scavenging subnanomolar levels of Cbl from the exterior, the dissociation rate is too slow to provide the 25–500 Cbl molecules that may be required in the cytoplasm of each cell for continued growth (22Bradbeer C. Banerjee R. Chemistry and Biochemistry of B12. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 489-506Google Scholar). Accordingly, some way is needed to increase the rate of dissociation of Cbl from the BtuB protein. This is accomplished by interaction with energized TonB. It must involve some conformational change in the hatch domain. It is even possible that this could include the partial or complete removal of the hatch from the barrel of BtuB, but it should be stressed that such movement is not required for exposure of bound Cbl to the periplasm. It should be noted that our work is confined to Cbl transport, and it remains possible that TonB-dependent conformational changes in the hatch domain are required to provide access of the ferric siderophore-binding sites to the periplasmic space. Our proposed mechanism for Cbl transport across the outer membrane consists first of calcium-dependent, high affinity binding of Cbl to BtuB on the external surface of the outer membrane. This is followed by fluctuations in BtuB such that the occupied Cbl-binding site is sometimes exposed to the exterior and sometimes to the periplasm. The interaction of the TonB box of BtuB with the energized TonB protein transmits a conformational change through the hatch to the Cbl/calcium-binding sites and reduces the affinity of BtuB for both Cbl and calcium. The marked increase in the rate of dissociation of Cbl from its binding site stimulates the release of Cbl into the periplasm. The evidence for calcium-dependent, high affinity binding of Cbl by BtuB has been well established previously (8Bradbeer C. Reynolds P.R. Bauler G.M. Fernandez M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2520-2523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bradbeer C. Gudmundsdottir A. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4919-4926Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and is shown above with the pure protein. Our earlier assumption that TonB and the pmf were not required for access of the Cbl-binding site to the periplasm was challenged by structural studies showing the apparent occlusion of the β-barrel by the hatch domain. This prompted the present study on access from the periplasm, which has confirmed our earlier suggestions. Fig. 7 shows that when an excess of unlabeled Cbl is added to preparations that have bound labeled Cbl, the rate of release of the labeled Cbl is faster from envelope particles, which have both sides of the outer membrane exposed to the reaction medium, than from whole cells. In both cases, the reaction conditions precluded involvement from either TonB or the pmf. In the whole cells, the unlabeled Cbl can exchange only with label when the binding site is toward the medium, whereas with the envelope preparations, the unlabeled Cbl has access to both sides of the outer membrane. It should be noted, even so, that the rate of Cbl release from the envelopes is slower than the observed rate of overall Cbl transport from the medium into the cytoplasm under optimal transport conditions, indicating a faster off-rate for Cbl toward the periplasm when the system is fully energized. More conclusive evidence that exposure of the Cbl-binding site on BtuB to the periplasm does not require the pmf is shown in Fig. 8. In btuC mutants, Cbl transport across the inner membrane is absent, and Cbl transport across the outer membrane can be studied in isolation. In such cells, in the presence of fully functional TonB and the pmf, Cbl accumulates in the periplasm until a plateau is reached when the rates of intake and exit become equal. The rates of Cbl exit from the periplasm into the medium can be measured by the addition of unlabeled Cbl after the plateau of labeled Cbl transport has been reached. In this counterflow experiment, the TonB/pmf energization is present. However, in the absence of addition of unlabeled Cbl, the accumulated periplasmic labeled Cbl can also be released by abolishing the pmf by the addition of dinitrophenol and, in the case of btuC/atp double mutants, also by cyanide. Thus, Cbl is able to flow down its concentration gradient to the outside of the cell, indicating that the BtuB protein on its own is capable of facilitated diffusion. This also means that, in the absence of the pmf, the Cbl-binding site is accessible to periplasmic Cbl and rules out any mechanism of Cbl transport that would require the removal of the hatch domain as a necessary step in the energization process. Consistent with the possibility of a capacity for facilitated diffusion are our observations that metE mutants that are also tonB will grow on minimal media containing 50 nm Cbl, whereas metE/btuB double mutants require 5 μm Cbl. In any case, a facilitated diffusion mechanism is not adequate for growth in media containing subnanomolar Cbl, and a mechanism is needed to increase the off-rate of Cbl toward the periplasmic space. Our proposal now and previously is that this is what the ExbB/ExbD/pmf system does. It decreases the affinity of BtuB for Cbl and thus increases its off-rate. The interdependence of calcium and Cbl binding means that this interaction could be exerted primarily upon either Cbl or calcium binding. The effect would be the same: increased off-rates for both calcium and Cbl. Fig. 2 shows that the pure BtuB protein has a 1000-fold greater affinity for Cbl in the presence of saturating calcium than in its absence, indicating a high potential for an increased off-rate. We have also shown (Figs. 5 and 6) how exquisitely sensitive calcium and Cbl binding is to structural changes in the hatch region, including the region at position 50 as well as the TonB box. Evidence has also been provided that the calcium-binding sites that were identified by x-ray structural analysis are the ones upon which high affinity Cbl binding is dependent. The report of some sequence homology between the ExbB and ExbD proteins and the proton-translocating proteins MotA and MotB of the flagellar motor (23Cascales E. Lloubes R. Sturgis J.N. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 795-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) prompts us to support the view that the energized TonB protein undergoes some rotary motion and transmits some torque to the hatch, providing enough conformational change to decrease the affinity of BtuB for Cbl and calcium. We acknowledge the considerable amount of advice and support given to us by the late Robert J. Kadner, in whose laboratory much of this work was done."

Although Purα and Purβ share substantial sequence homology and nucleic acid binding properties, genomic promoter and cis-element occupancy studies reported herein suggest that Purβ is the dominant factor in gene regulation. To dissect the molecular basis of Purβ repressor activity, site-directed mutagenesis was used to map amino acids critical to the physical and functional interaction of Purβ with the smooth muscle α-actin promoter. Of all the various acidic, basic, and aromatic residues studied, mutation of positionally conserved arginines in the class I or class II repeat modules significantly attenuated Purβ repressor activity in transfected vascular smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. DNA binding and protein-protein interaction assays were conducted with purified recombinant Purβ and selected mutants to reveal the physical basis for loss-of-function. Mutants R57E, R57E/R96E, and R57A/R96A each exhibited reduced single-stranded DNA binding affinity for an essential promoter element and diminished interaction with corepressor YB-1/MSY1. Structural analyses of the R57A/R96A and R57E/R96E double mutants in comparison to the wild-type Purβ homodimer revealed aberrant self-association into higher order oligomeric complexes, which correlated with decreased α-helical content and defective DNA and protein binding in vitro.

Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). The importance of this process is highlighted by the fact that the degree of ensuing lipoprotein and inflammatory cell retention and fibrous cap formation may dictate the overall vulnerability of atheromatous plaque to lethal rupture (2Falk E.

Cardiol. 2006; 47: C13-C18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1822) Google Scholar). Other clinically relevant conditions involving dysfunctional vascular remodeling such as in-stent restenosis, transplant vasculopathy, and vein bypass graft failure are also thought to entail VSMC migration and proliferation as a primary pathophysiological mechanism leading to narrowing of the lumen (4Rahmani M. Cruz R.P. Granville D.J. McManus B.M. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 801-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). However, accumulating evidence suggests that resident fibroblasts of the vascular wall adventitia as well as circulating progenitor cells may also contribute to neointimal hyperplasia in certain animal models of arterial disease and injury by virtue of conversion to a myofibroblast phenotype (5Sartore S.

Notwithstanding the diversity of cell types implicated in vascular remodeling, the biochemical hallmark of a differentiated VSMC or myofibroblast is expression of smooth muscle α-actin (SMαA), a cytoskeletal protein that plays an essential role in facilitating vascular contractility and wound healing (7Schildmeyer L.A.

As such, the gene encoding SMαA is a relevant target for elucidating mechanisms that contribute to phenotypic modulation of cell types involved in vascular development, disease, and repair. Over the past fifteen years, work from many different investigators has led to a consensus view that SMαA gene regulatory mechanisms are highly cell type-dependent and, in the case of transcriptional control, typified by combinatorial interactions among multiple cis-elements, corresponding DNA-binding proteins, and associated tissue-restricted cofactors (13Kumar M.S.

Among the various regulatory proteins identified to date, several single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding proteins known as Purα and Purβ have been implicated in SMαA promoter repression in VSMCs and myofibroblasts by virtue of their strand-specific interaction with certain sequence elements present in the 5′-flanking region of the gene (15Kelm Jr., R.J.

Each known Pur-interacting element in the SMαA promoter (-195 to -164 and -59 to -28) has a high degree of purine-pyrimidine asymmetry and a core motif that, in double-stranded configuration, serves as a recognition site for an essential activator. Mechanistically, Purα and Purβ appear to repress transcription by virtue of inhibitory protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions, which serve to impair efficient SMαA enhancer elaboration by basal and inducible activators including TEF-1, SRF, Sp1/3, and R-Smad2/3/4. Importantly, physical and functional interaction with YB-1/MSY1, which preferentially binds to the pyrimidine-rich strand complementary to Purα/β-binding element spanning -195 to -164 (15Kelm Jr., R.J.

Purα and Purβ are members of an evolutionarily-conserved family of ssDNA and RNA-binding proteins whose signature biochemical feature is specific and high affinity interaction with single-stranded nucleic acid sequences rich in purine nucleotides (20Gallia G.L.

All known Pur paralogs expressed in vertebrates (Purα, Purβ, and Purγ) exhibit a substantial degree of homology marked by an ordered array of highly conserved class I (basic aromatic) and class II (acidic leucine-rich) repeats in the central region of each protein (22Johnson E.M. Anticancer Res. 2003; 23: 2093-2100PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these repeats comprise the ssDNA/RNA-binding domain of both Purα and Purβ (19Kelm Jr., R.J. Wang S.X. Polikandriotis J.A.

Given the diversity of functions attributed to different members of the Pur family, molecular analysis of genetically engineered point mutants may be helpful in clarifying the mechanisms by which Pur paralogs modulate gene expression and cell phenotype. In the present study, we set out to test how mutation of certain conserved and non-conserved amino acid residues would change the physical and functional properties of Purβ in relation to SMαA promoter repression. This line of investigation has led to the novel finding that specific arginine residues present in the class I and class II repeats are essential to formation of a structurally stable protein, which can bind to ssDNA, interact with corepressor partner YB-1/MSY1, and inhibit SMαA gene transcription.

Primer sequences along with detailed methods describing mutant plasmid synthesis, propagation, and quality control are provided in the online data supplement. Large-scale purification of sequence-verified mutant expression plasmids was achieved by double cesium chloride gradient centrifugation of DNA extracted from 1-liter Escherichia coli cultures. Supercoiled mutant Purβ expression plasmids were quantified by optical density measurement at 260 nm. Plasmid stocks used for transient transfection were subjected to analytical agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm both the absence of genomic DNA and the correct restriction fragment pattern after double digestion with BamHI and KpnI (Roche Applied Science). Selected mutant Purβ cDNA fragments released from pCI by BamHI and KpnI digestion were subcloned into the bacterial expression plasmid pQE30 (Qiagen) and re-sequenced. Recombinant NHis-Purβ Purification and Structural Characterization—Expression, purification, and quantification of His6-tagged point mutants were performed as previously described for wild-type NHis-Purβ except that isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction was done at room temperature rather than 37 °C (18Knapp A.M.

Analytical size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed on selected preparations with the use of a HiPrep™ (16/60) Sephacryl™ S200HR column (GE Healthcare) coupled to a BioCAD® 700E work station (PerSeptive Biosystems) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was calibrated with a mixture of molecular weight standards (Sigma), which included blue dextran (2000 kDa), BSA (66 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), cytochrome c (12.4 kDa), and DNP-aspartate. Wild-type or mutant NHis-Purβ was loaded at a concentration of ∼30 μm (0.6 ml) and eluted in buffer consisting of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol with 0.2 m NaCl or 1 m NaCl. Protein elution was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. Selected SEC-fractioned NHis-Purβ preparations were analyzed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy on an Aviv model 215 CD spectrometer fitted with a thermal equilibration chamber (UMDNJ Circular Dichroism Facility). Spectra were obtained from 260 to 200 nm at 0.5 nm intervals. Data were collected at protein concentrations of 0.2 mg/ml in buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and temperatures ranging from 20 to 70 °C at 5 °C intervals. Smoothing and baseline correction of the data were performed as described (41Greenfield N.J. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2527-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Cell Culture, Transient Transfection, Reporter Gene, and Pur Point Mutant Expression Assays—AKR-2B mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and A7r5 rat aortic VSMCs were cultured and transiently transfected with the use of GenePORTER® (Gene Therapy Systems, Inc.) or jetPEI™ (Qbiogene) reagents as previously described (18Knapp A.M.

Subconfluent cells were transfected with 3 μg of mouse SMαA promoter:chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter plasmid plus 1 μg of pCI expression plasmid encoding wild-type or mutated His-tagged Purβ. As a control, cells were transfected with reporter plasmid plus 1 μg of empty pCI plasmid. After 48 h culture in growth medium, cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then extracted for 30 min with 1× CAT lysis buffer (Roche Applied Science) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin. Extracts were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and subjected to various biochemical assays. Total protein was determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (Sigma) with the use of BSA as a standard. CAT reporter protein was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Roche Applied Science). Expression of His-tagged Purβ was assessed by either immunocytochemistry (see supplemental methods) or by immunoblotting of cell extracts as previously described using a primary antibody directed against the N-terminal His6 epitope (19Kelm Jr., R.J. Wang S.X. Polikandriotis J.A. Strauch A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38749-38757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Blots were reprobed with a monoclonal antibody against GAPDH (clone 6C5, Research Diagnostics, Inc.) to verify equivalent protein loading. Transfections were typically performed in triplicate and repeated two to three times. Data sets were subjected to analysis of variance. Differences between groups were further analyzed by Student's t test with the alpha level set at 0.05 and Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons. DNA Binding Assays—Quantitative colorimetric assays in microtiter well format were used to assess the binding of cell extract-derived or recombinant Pur proteins to selected DNA probes as previously described (18Knapp A.M.

Nucleoprotein binding buffer consisted of 20 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA with 0.2% w/v BSA (Sigma, ELISA-qualified) and 0.05% v/v Tween 20 plus 5 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) (Roche Applied Science). In assays using cell extract-derived protein, 1.5 mm MgCl2 was substituted for EDTA in the binding buffer. In the assay design where synthetic 3′-biotinylated oligonucleotides (Sigma-Genosys) were immobilized on StreptaWells (Roche Applied Science), solid-phase Pur nucleoprotein complexes formed after incubation of DNA-coated wells with nuclear extract (42Wang S.X.

Chem. 2005; 280: 6204-6214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) or purified protein were detected by discontinuous ELISA. This involved incubating washed wells for 1 h with 1.0 μg/ml primary antibody directed against the C terminus of Purβ or Purα (15Kelm Jr., R.J. Cogan J.G. Elder P.K. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14238-14245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) followed by a secondary incubation with a 1:2000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) then tertiary incubation with HRP substrate solution (19Kelm Jr., R.J.

In both assay formats, wells were washed three times with HEPES-buffered saline containing 0.05% v/v Tween 20 between each reagent application. To assess the association of Pur proteins with genomic DNA in living cells, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were conducted by adapting established procedures (29Ji J. Tsika G.L. Rindt H.

A detailed methodological description of the assay including culture conditions, formaldehyde fixation, cell lysis, chromatin fragmentation, immunoprecipitation with Pur or MSY1 polyclonal antibodies, reverse cross-linking of isolated nucleoprotein complexes, and PCR amplification of SMαA promoter sequence is provided in the online data supplement. Protein-Protein Interaction Assay—The binding of Purβ mutants to selected proteins was evaluated by ELISA (18Knapp A.M. Ramsey J.E. Wang S.X. Godburn K.E. Strauch A.R. Kelm Jr., R.J. J. Biol.

To validate comparison of the binding capacity of wild-type and mutant Purβ proteins immobilized in the solid-phase, control assays were initially conducted to ensure that the coating efficiency of each mutant was similar to wild-type Purβ over a range of coating concentrations. Based on these results, wells were coated with wild-type or mutant Purβ at a saturating concentration of 100 nm in HEPES-buffered saline. Nuclear extracts from AKR-2B MEFs were prepared as previously described (42Wang S.X. Elder P.K. Zheng Y. Strauch A.R. Kelm Jr., R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6204-6214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and used as a source of Purβ interaction partners at 200 μg/ml in binding buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl with 0.2% w/v BSA and 0.05% v/v Tween 20. Primary detecting antibodies against Purα (A291–313) or MSY1 (M242–267) (15Kelm Jr., R.J. Cogan J.G. Elder P.K. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14238-14245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) were applied at a concentration of 1.0 μg/ml followed by secondary HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG at a 1:2000 dilution. Wells were washed three times between each reagent application. In all microplate-based assays, colorimetric signal was generated by application of HRP substrate solution (ABTS single reagent system, Chemicon). After 5–15 min, reactions were quenched by the adding an equal volume of 1% SDS. End point absorbance values at 405 nm were measured with a Vmax™ microplate reader (Molecular Devices). The binding of selected Purβ mutants to recombinant MSY1 was similarly assessed by ELISA in which purified MSY1 was immobilized in the solid phase (15Kelm Jr., R.J. Cogan J.G. Elder P.K. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14238-14245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Biochemical Evidence for Purβ Dominance in SMαA Promoter and cis-Element Association in Vivo—Results of recent gene knockdown and overexpression studies indicated that the repressor activity of Purβ exceeded that of Purα in both fibroblasts and VSMCs despite the fact that the recombinant proteins displayed nearly identical ssDNA binding properties in vitro (18Knapp A.M.
