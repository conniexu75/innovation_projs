https://openalex.org/W2065506464,"The application of island biogeography theory to conservation practice is premature. Theoretically and empirically, a major conclusion of such applications-that refuges should always consist of the largest possible single area-can be incorrect under a variety of biologically feasible conditions. The cost and irreversibility of large-scale conservation programs demand a prudent approach to the application of an insufficiently validated theory."
https://openalex.org/W2040134564,"Documentation is reported for sea turtles overwintering on the sea bottom. Seri Indians have traditionally hunted nonmigrating dormant green turtles (Chelonia mydas) along the bottom of the Infiernillo Channel in the Gulf of California. Mexican fishermen independently discovered dormant turtles during winter 1972-1973, and with new hunting technologies are rapidly decimating these unusual stocks."

https://openalex.org/W2044354590,"Prototaxites southworthii. an Upper Devonian, nonvascular plant of unknown affinity that is commonly ascribed to the brown algae, has filaments with septal pores. These superficially resemble various pores and pit connections of the higher algae and fungi and suggest that very elaborate cell wall structure had evolved by Devonian times."
