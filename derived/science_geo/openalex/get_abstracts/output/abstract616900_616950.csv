https://openalex.org/W2888110720,"Classic studies of spatial attention assumed that its neural and behavioral effects were continuous over time. Recent behavioral studies have instead revealed that spatial attention leads to alternating periods of heightened or diminished perceptual sensitivity. Yet, the neural basis of these rhythmic fluctuations has remained largely unknown. We show that a dynamic interplay within the macaque frontoparietal network accounts for the rhythmic properties of spatial attention. Neural oscillations characterize functional interactions between the frontal eye fields (FEF) and the lateral intraparietal area (LIP), with theta phase (3–8 Hz) coordinating two rhythmically alternating states. The first is defined by FEF-dominated beta-band activity, associated with suppressed attentional shifts, and LIP-dominated gamma-band activity, associated with enhanced visual processing and better behavioral performance. The second is defined by LIP-specific alpha-band activity, associated with attenuated visual processing and worse behavioral performance. Our findings reveal how network-level interactions organize environmental sampling into rhythmic cycles."

Exquisite sensitivity to sound has provided a powerful evolutionary advantage for countless life forms on earth. Despite the prevalence and critical nature of sound sensitivity, the genes and proteins that mediate sensory transduction in the auditory system have not been definitively identified. Among vertebrates, there is an evolutionarily conserved gene (Keresztes et al., 2003Keresztes G. Mutai H. Heller S.

Although multiple lines of evidence support a role for TMC1 as a part of the channel complex mediating sensory transduction (Corey and Holt, 2016Corey D.P. Holt J.R. Are TMCs the mechanotransduction channels of vertebrate hair cells?.J. Neurosci. 2016; 36: 10921-10926Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), alternative interpretations exist (Wu and Müller, 2016Wu Z. Müller U. Molecular identity of the mechanotransduction channel in hair cells: not quiet there yet.J. Neurosci. 2016; 36: 10927-10934Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and definitive evidence is lacking. In addition, whereas the multiple-transmembrane topology of TMC1 resembles an ion channel, the region of the protein that forms the ion channel pore has not been identified; hence, the protein retains the name “channel-like.” Sensory transduction in inner-ear hair cells converts mechanical information, in the form of sound or head movements, into electrical signals, which are relayed to the brain via the eighth cranial nerve. Hair cells utilize a mechanosensitive apparatus that rests atop bundles of 60–100 modified microvilli known as stereocilia. According to the prevailing model, there are an estimated 60–200 mechanosensory transduction channels per hair bundle, 1 or 2 per stereocilium. These mechanosensitive transduction channels perform the fundamental transformation, converting mechanical motion into electrical current in response to stereocilia bundle deflections. Although a biophysical model for hair cell mechanosensory transduction was proposed 35 years ago (Corey and Hudspeth, 1983Corey D.P. Hudspeth A.J. Kinetics of the receptor current in bullfrog saccular hair cells.J. Neurosci. 1983; 3: 962-976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the search for the molecular identity of the hair cell transduction channel has yielded numerous dead ends and false leads (Corey and Holt, 2016Corey D.P. Holt J.R. Are TMCs the mechanotransduction channels of vertebrate hair cells?.J. Neurosci. 2016; 36: 10921-10926Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that TMC1, and closely related TMC2, are pore-forming components of the elusive sensory transduction channel required for auditory and vestibular transduction in inner-ear hair cells (Pan et al., 2013Pan B. Géléoc G.S. Asai Y. Horwitz G.C. Kurima K. Ishikawa K. Kawashima Y. Griffith A.J. Holt J.R. TMC1 and TMC2 are components of the mechanotransduction channel in hair cells of the mammalian inner ear.Neuron. 2013; 79: 504-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Here, we use a variety of approaches to test this hypothesis and present a structural model for the channel pore. To investigate the stoichiometry of the TMC family of proteins, we expressed GFP- and mCherry-tagged variants of mouse TMC (mmTMC) in CHO cells and measured fluorescence resonance energy transfer between them. Among a subset of mmTMC homologs, we observed a robust fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) signal (∼0.15) between GFP and mCherry (Figures S1A and S1B). A Förster distance R0 ∼ 51–54 Å (Stryer and Haugland, 1967Stryer L. Haugland R.P. Energy transfer: a spectroscopic ruler.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1967; 58: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar) indicates a proximity of ∼70 Å between GFP and mCherry tags on co-expressed TMCs. There was no observed FRET signal with a negative control, the α4 acetylcholine receptor subunit, for either mmTMC1 or mmTMC2. These data suggest that mmTMCs assemble as multimeric complexes—both homomeric and heteromeric—in CHO cells. Next, we performed fluorescence size-exclusion chromatography (FSEC) on detergent-solubilized HEK cell lysates containing human TMC1 (hsTMC1) fused to GFP (Figure 1A). To obtain an initial estimate for the molecular weight of the protein, we created a calibration curve for our chromatography column (see STAR Methods; Wu, 2004Wu C.-S. Handbook of Size Exclusion Chromatography and Related Techniques.Second Edition. Marcel Dekker, 2004Google Scholar). Specifically, we plotted the elution volume of established globular protein standards against their known molecular masses (Fasman, 1989Fasman G.D. Practical Handbook of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla.1989Google Scholar); from that, we estimated that the detergent-solubilized GFP-tagged hsTMC1 elution peak volume corresponds to a mass of ∼310 kDa (Figure 1B). Assuming an apparent mass for the surrounding detergent micelle in the range of ∼100 kDa (Slotboom et al., 2008Slotboom D.J. Duurkens R.H. Olieman K. Erkens G.B. Static light scattering to characterize membrane proteins in detergent solution.Methods. 2008; 46: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), the estimated protein mass is ∼210 kDa, which agrees best with a dimer of 115.4 kDa (87.7 + 28.7 kDa) GFP fusion proteins. We also performed FSEC on GFP-mmTMEM16a, which is a known dimer of 139 kDa (110.9 + 28.7 kDa) subunits. The elution volume of GFP-mmTMEM16a was consistently close to that of GFP-TMC1 (Figure S1C). As a control, we performed FSEC on HEK293FT cells transfected with a plasma-membrane-targeting GFP vector, which did not show a protein peak in this position (Figure S1C). To perform more rigorous biochemical tests of stoichiometry, we purified TMC proteins. We expressed mouse and human TMC1 constructs with a C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag preceded by an HRV3C cleavage site in HEK293FT cells. TMC1-HA was purified by binding to an HA-agarose resin and eluted via cleavage of the HA tag from the protein (see STAR Methods). To improve the stability of the purified proteins, TMCs were reconstituted into amphipols (Popot et al., 2011Popot J.L. Althoff T. Bagnard D. Banères J.L. Bazzacco P. Billon-Denis E. Catoire L.J. Champeil P. Charvolin D. Cocco M.J. et al.Amphipols from A to Z.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2011; 40: 379-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The purity of the TMC1 proteins was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Figure S1D). The circular dichroism spectrum of purified TMC1 in amphipols showed dipping peaks near 210 and 222 nm, indicating a folded protein of high α-helical content (Figure S1E). Finally, the identity of the purified proteins was confirmed by mass spectrometry sequencing of the Coomassie-stained gel band of GFP-TMC1 followed by in-gel trypsin digestion into peptide fragments (Figure S2). We found that 99.85% of the peptide signal intensity in our sample band was assigned to GFP-TMC1, with the next highest scoring protein at 0.006%. Because oligomerization state could be altered as a membrane protein is purified and transferred to detergents or amphipathic polymers that are more amenable for high-resolution structure determination, we monitored stoichiometry of TMC1 reconstituted in amphipols using FSEC. Both mouse and human TMC1 constructs eluted on SEC as single peaks (Figure S1F). Importantly, after purification, the FSEC profiles of purified GFP-TMC1-HA proteins were similar to those before purification (Figure S1G), suggesting that the purification procedure does not alter subunit stoichiometry. Consistent with what one would expect for dimers, native-PAGE experiments showed protein bands corresponding to molecular weights of ∼200 kDa for untagged hsTMC1-HA (Figure 1C) and ∼240 kDa for GFP-hsTMC1-HA (not shown). We then cross-linked purified proteins with disuccinimidyl dibutyric urea (DSBU) and assessed mass with denaturing PAGE (see STAR Methods). The cross-linked subunits are expected to migrate according to their combined molecular mass on denaturing gels. Bands were apparent at the predicted molecular masses of both monomers and dimers of hsTMC1 (Figure 1D). Finally, we used SEC-multi-angle static light scattering (MALS) analysis (see STAR Methods) to estimate the mass of the amphipol-protein complex. The combined mass of protein and amphipols was ∼230 kDa (±3%; Figure 1E). To determine the contribution of the amphipol to the complex, we performed a protein-conjugate analysis. We calculated a contribution of ∼150 kDa from the protein (±3%) and ∼80 kDa from amphipols (±8%; Figure 1E). The protein mass is roughly twice that of the untagged mmTMC1 (∼88 kDa), indicating that mmTMC1 subunits assemble as a dimer. We then purified hsTMC1 proteins and viewed them with negative stain as well as cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Images confirm that the preparations contained a fairly homogeneous population of TMC1 proteins, free of aggregation (Figures 1F and 1G). The class averages did not reveal structural details, suggesting conformational mobility and disorder. Assuming a protein density of ∼1.35 g/cm3, however, their ∼7- to 10-nm diameter indicates a protein of 200–220 kDa, consistent with a dimer of 88-kDa subunits. In addition, the images show a bi-lobed structure, but not trimeric symmetry, which is also consistent with a dimeric complex (Figure 1H). We conclude that TMC1 assembles as a dimer. Most ion channel families assemble as trimers (P2Xs, ASICs, and piezos), tetramers (voltage-gated potassium channels and TRPs), pentamers (acetylcholine receptors [AChRs], GABAA receptors, glycine receptors, and 5-HT3 receptors), or hexamers (connexins). Mechanosensitive channels in bacteria assemble as tetramers, pentamers, or heptamers (Haswell et al., 2011Haswell E.S. Phillips R. Rees D.C. Mechanosensitive channels: what can they do and how do they do it?.Structure. 2011; 19: 1356-1369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In each case, the multimer creates a single, central pore through which ions can pass. There are a few families that assemble as dimers; notable examples are the CLC chloride channels and transporters and the TMEM16 family of anion channels and lipid scramblases. Both of these families have two separate ion conduction pathways, one in each subunit of the dimer (Middleton et al., 1996Middleton R.E. Pheasant D.J. Miller C.

A pore idea: the ion conduction pathway of TMEM16/ANO proteins is composed partly of lipid.Pflugers Arch. 2016; 468: 455-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We wondered whether TMC proteins shared structural similarity with either of these dimeric channels. To understand the transmembrane architecture of mmTMC1, we plotted its hydrophobicity (Figure S3A). Six or seven domains (indicated with boxes 1–5 and 9 and 10) are strongly hydrophobic, but additional domains (indicated as boxes 6–8) are ambiguous (Keresztes et al., 2003Keresztes G. Mutai H. Heller S.

We used additional transmembrane prediction algorithms on the CCTOP prediction server (Dobson et al., 2015Dobson L. Reményi I. Tusnády G.E. CCTOP: a consensus constrained TOPology prediction web server.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: W408-W412Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), which aggregates predictions from multiple algorithms, including TMHMM (Krogh et al., 2001Krogh A.

Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9084) Google Scholar), Octopus (Viklund and Elofsson, 2008Viklund H. Elofsson A.

Improved topology prediction using the terminal hydrophobic helices rule.Bioinformatics. 2016; 32: 1158-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For mmTMC1, different algorithms did not always predict the same transmembrane domains but tended to predict 8–10 domains, with intracellular N and C termini (Figure S3B). We also used CCTOP to analyze the sequences of mmTMEM16A, an anion channel, and btCLC-K, a chloride channel. Structures for both have been solved (Park et al., 2017Park E. Campbell E.B. MacKinnon R.

Kalienkova V. Brunner J.D. Schenck S. Dutzler R. Structural basis for anion conduction in the calcium-activated chloride channel TMEM16A.eLife. 2017; 6: e26232Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). CCTOP predicted 8 transmembrane domains for mmTMEM16A, which is known to have 10 transmembrane domains (Paulino et al., 2017aPaulino C. Neldner Y. Lam A.K. Kalienkova V. Brunner J.D. Schenck S. Dutzler R. Structural basis for anion conduction in the calcium-activated chloride channel TMEM16A.eLife. 2017; 6: e26232Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). As with mmTMC1, the predictions of different algorithms did not always agree. The solved transmembrane domains S1, S2, S3, S4, S9, and S10 were strongly predicted, whereas S5, S6, S7, and S8—also known to be transmembrane—showed mixed prediction. Notably, however, the regions of strong prediction and mixed prediction for mmTMC1 matched those for mmTMEM16. It is clear why predictions for S5–S8 of mmTMEM16A were mixed: these contain some charged and polar residues not normally found in lipid-facing transmembrane domains. In TMEM16A, these transmembrane regions line the channel pore (Paulino et al., 2017bPaulino C. Kalienkova V. Lam A.K.M. Neldner Y. Dutzler R. Activation mechanism of the calcium-activated chloride channel TMEM16A revealed by cryo-EM.Nature. 2017; 552: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, Dang et al., 2017Dang S. Feng S. Tien J. Peters C.J. Bulkley D. Lolicato M. Zhao J. Zuberbühler K. Ye W. Qi L. et al.Cryo-EM structures of the TMEM16A calcium-activated chloride channel.Nature. 2017; 552: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar); they may also in TMC1. S7 and S8 are short with few hydrophilic residues separating them and are always predicted as a single-transmembrane segment. Instead, a conserved PxxP sequence between S7 and S8 domains in TMEM16 provides a kink that is necessary for the hairpin structure in this region. The presence of this sequence in most TMCs supports the prediction that there are two distinct transmembrane domains in this segment: S7 between amino acids 570 and 591 in the mouse sequence and S8 between amino acids 596 and 616. In contrast, the transmembrane prediction for btCLC-K showed 14 transmembrane domains, consistent with the known structure (Park et al., 2017Park E. Campbell E.B. MacKinnon R. Structure of a CLC chloride ion channel by cryo-electron microscopy.Nature. 2017; 541: 500-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) but very different from the topology of TMCs (Figure S3B). Overall, the predicted transmembrane topology of TMCs matched that of TMEM16s. In addition, our mass spectrometry of purified hsTMC1 is consistent with 10 transmembrane domains. Mass spectrometry of trypsin-digested membrane proteins often does not detect hydrophobic peptide segments. Mass spectrometry analysis of purified, trypsin-digested hsTMC1 resulted in ∼45% peptide coverage, and the missing sequences were consistently within the predicted transmembrane domains (Figure S2A). Mass spectrometry after chymotrypsin digestion, in contrast, showed more extensive coverage. Both indicated that the sample was full-length hsTMC1 (Figure S2B). We also compared predicted secondary structure of mmTMC1 with that of mmTMEM16 using PSSpred (Yan et al., 2013Yan R. Xu D. Yang J. Walker S. Zhang Y. A comparative assessment and analysis of 20 representative sequence alignment methods for protein structure prediction.Sci. Rep. 2013; 3: 2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Predictions for both indicate coiled-coil and helical structure in the N terminus before S1, a helix in the C terminus after S10, and very little beta strand structure (Figure S3C), consistent with the circular dichroism spectrum of purified TMC1 (Figure S1E). They show ten helical segments that match transmembrane segments predicted from hydrophobicity. The mmTMC1 protein has an additional helix between S2 and S3, not seen in mmTMEM16, but otherwise the length and placement of helical segments is similar. The similarity in predicted secondary structure further suggests that TMCs may have a structure similar to TMEM16s. A schematic illustration of predicted transmembrane topology and secondary structure for mmTMC1, drawn from the combined transmembrane and secondary structure predictions, is shown in Figure 2A. Membrane proteins can be phosphorylated and glycosylated. Our mass spectrometry experiments detected six sites that were phosphorylated and located primarily in the intracellular N-terminal section of the protein (Figure S2A). In addition, the S5/S6 loop, predicted to be extracellular, bears an asparagine (N472 in mmTMC1) with the canonical NxT/S recognition sequence for N-linked glycosylation (N472 in mmTMC1), suggesting that this loop is likely to be extracellular. TMCs have previously been reported to have sequence similarity with the TMEM16 family (Hahn et al., 2009Hahn Y. Kim D.S. Pastan I.H. Lee B.

Tate J. Mistry J. Coggill P.C. Sammut S.J. Hotz H.R. Ceric G. Forslund K. Eddy S.R. Sonnhammer E.L. Bateman A. The Pfam protein families database.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: D281-D288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1907) Google Scholar). We used ClustalX2 to align amino acid sequences of TMCs and TMEM16s from many species. Although similarity was low overall between TMCs and TMEM16s, there were regions of high similarity, especially for transmembrane domains S1 and a short segment preceding it, S2 and a segment following, S4, S5, S7, S8, S9, S10, and a short segment after S10 (Figure S4; Data S1). Based on this alignment, we used ClustalX2 to understand the phylogenetic relationship between these two families. Each family falls into a distinct group in an unrooted tree (Figure S5) with the fungal Nectria hematococca TMEM16 (nhTMEM16) toward the middle, but the phylogenetic distance between families is not much more than distances between some members within families. Phyre2 (Kelley and Sternberg, 2009Kelley L.A. Sternberg M.J. Protein structure prediction on the Web: a case study using the Phyre server.Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (3553) Google Scholar) and I-TASSER (Yang and Zhang, 2015Yang J. Zhang Y. Protein structure and function prediction using I-TASSER.Curr. Protoc. Bioinformatics. 2015; 52: 5.8.1-5.8.15Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) servers use algorithms that identify relationships among protein families by comparing amino acid sequences of near homologs. These algorithms identify the most conserved regions and then weight those regions more heavily in a search for more distant relatives. To find proteins related to TMCs—specifically those for which structures have been determined—we submitted many TMC sequences to the Phyre2 and I-TASSER servers (see STAR Methods). In almost all cases, they identified nhTMEM16 or mmTMEM16A as the most closely related homolog with a known structure. Both Phyre2 and I-TASSER then used the nhTMEM16 or mmTMEM16A structures solved with X-ray crystallography or cryo-EM (Brunner et al., 2014Brunner J.D. Lim N.K. Schenck S. Duerst A. Dutzler R.

The alignments were monomer-to-monomer, even though TMEM16s are dimers, so we created dimeric models of mmTMC1 and hsTMC1 by aligning the TMC monomer models to the mmTMEM16A dimer structure (Figure 2B). Extracellular and intracellular loops were not consistently modeled, and sequence similarity between TMEM16s and TMCs is weak in the loops, so we focused only on the arrangement of transmembrane helices, which are shown in several views (Figures 2C and 2D). We then sought an independent test of this arrangement. An emerging approach to predict protein structure is to use information contained within sequence variation among the members of large protein families (Marks et al., 2011Marks D.S. Colwell L.J. Sheridan R. Hopf T.A. Pagnani A. Zecchina R. Sander C. Protein 3D structure computed from evolutionary sequence variation.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e28766Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Residues that are closely apposed tend to co-vary. Using EVcoupling software (Marks et al., 2011Marks D.S. Colwell L.J. Sheridan R. Hopf T.A. Pagnani A. Zecchina R. Sander C. Protein 3D structure computed from evolutionary sequence variation.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e28766Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar), we identified and aligned about 3,500 sequences for TMCs in different species. The predicted contact map for hsTMC1, for 108 couplings with >80% confidence, is shown in Figure S6. We focused especially on couplings between residues in predicted transmembrane helices. This analysis predicted a number of adjacencies that are characteristic of parallel and anti-parallel transmembrane helix arrangements and—with some exceptions—are consistent with the predicted structure. Specifically, residues assigned to domains S6, S7, and S8 show evolutionary coupling (EC) signatures expected from their positions in the predicted structure, as do residues in S1 and S2, S3 and S4, and S1 and S8. These are schematized in a view of one subunit from the extracellular side (Figures 2E and S6). Structures derived by threading the sequence of one homolog onto the structure of a second are approximations at best, especially when sequence identity is low. Following a strategy used for prestin (Gorbunov et al., 2014Gorbunov D. Sturlese M. Nies F. Kluge M. Bellanda M. Battistutta R. Oliver D.

https://openalex.org/W2888520682,"Individuals with schizophrenia or substance use disorder have a substantially increased mortality compared to the general population. Despite a high and probably increasing prevalence of comorbid substance use disorder in people with schizophrenia, the mortality in the comorbid group has been less studied and with contrasting results. We performed a nationwide open cohort study from 2009 to 2015, including all Norwegians aged 20–79 with schizophrenia and/or substance use disorder registered in any specialized health care setting in Norway, a total of 125,744 individuals. There were 12,318 deaths in the cohort, and total, sex-, age- and cause-specific standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated, comparing the number of deaths in patients with schizophrenia, schizophrenia only, substance use disorder only or a co-occurring diagnosis of schizophrenia and substance use disorder to the number expected if the patients had the age-, sex- and calendar-year specific death rates of the general population. The SMRs were 4.9 (95% CI 4.7–5.1) for all schizophrenia patients, 4.4 (95% CI 4.2–4.6) in patients with schizophrenia without substance use disorder, 6.6 (95% CI 6.5–6.8) in patients with substance use disorder only, and 7.4 (95% CI 7.0–8.2) in patients with both schizophrenia and substance use disorder. The SMRs were elevated in both genders, in all age groups and for all considered causes of death, and most so in the youngest. Approximately 27% of the excess mortality in all patients with schizophrenia was due to the raised mortality in the subgroup with comorbid SUD. The increased mortality in patients with schizophrenia and/or substance use disorder corresponded to more than 10,000 premature deaths, which constituted 84% of all deaths in the cohort. The persistent mortality gap highlights the importance of securing systematic screening and proper access to somatic health care, and a more effective prevention of premature death from external causes in this group."
https://openalex.org/W2888008754,"Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease increasingly affecting our aging population. Remarkable advances have been made in developing novel therapies to control symptoms, halt or cure the disease, ranging from physiotherapy and small molecules to cell and gene therapy. This progress was enabled by the existence of reliable animal models. The nonhuman primate model of Parkinson's disease emulates the cardinal symptoms of the disease, including tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, postural instability, freezing and cognitive impairment. However, this model is established through the specific loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, while our current knowledge reflects the reality of Parkinson's disease as a multisystem disease. Parkinson's disease involves both motor and non-motor symptoms, such as sleep disturbance, olfaction, gastrointestinal dysfunctions, depression and cognitive deficits. Some of the non-motor symptoms emerge earlier at the prodromal phase and worsen with disease progression, yet in basic and translational studies, they are rarely considered as endpoints. In this study, we set to characterize an ensemble of less described motor and non-motor dysfunctions in the marmoset MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) model. We provide evidence that this animal model expresses postural head tremor and a progressive worsening of fine motor skills, movement coordination and cognitive abilities over a 6-month period. We report for the first time a non-invasive approach showing detailed analysis of daytime and nighttime sleep and circadian rhythm disturbance remarkably similar to Parkinson's disease patients. This study describes the incidence of tremors, motor and non-motor dysfunctions in a preclinical model and highlights the need for their consideration in translating effective new therapeutic approaches for Parkinson's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2888492640,"Previous research in animal shelters has determined the breeds of dogs living in shelters by their visual appearance; however the genetic breed testing of such dogs is seldom conducted, and few studies have compared the breed labels assigned by shelter staff to the results of this testing. In the largest sampling of shelter dogs’ breed identities to-date, 459 dogs at Arizona Animal Welfare League & SPCA (AAWL) in Phoenix, Arizona, and 460 dogs at San Diego Humane Society & SPCA (SDHS) in San Diego, California, were genetically tested using a commercially available product to determine their breed heritage. In our sample, genetic analyses identified 125 distinct breeds with 91 breeds present at both shelters, and 4.9% of the dogs identified as purebreds. The three most common breed signatures, in order of prevalence, American Staffordshire Terrier, Chihuahua, and Poodle, accounted for 42.5% or all breed identifications at the great grandparent level. During their stay at the shelter, dogs with pit bull-type ancestries waited longer to be adopted than other dogs. When we compared shelter breed assignment as determined by visual appearance to that of genetic testing, staff at SDHS was able to successfully match at least one breed in the genetic heritage of 67.7% of dogs tested; however their agreement fell to 10.4% when asked to identify more than one breed. Lastly, we found that as the number of pit bull-type relatives in a dog’s heritage increased, so did the shelter’s ability to match the results of DNA analysis. In total when we consider the complexity of shelter dog breed heritage and the failure to identify multiple breeds based on visual identification coupled with our inability to predict how these breeds then interact within an individual dog, we believe that focusing resources on communicating the physical and behavioral characteristics of shelter dogs would best support adoption efforts."

A novel laccase isoform LacA was purified; LacA is a homodimer with an apparent molecular mass of 55 kDa and an isoelectric point of 4.7. Its optimal pH was 2.5, 4.0, and 5.5 when 2, 2’-Azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonate) (ABTS), guaiacol, and 2, 6-dimethoxyphenol (2, 6-DMP) were used as the substrates, respectively. The optimal temperature was 60°C for ABTS and 80°C for both guaiacol and 2, 6-DMP. LacA retained 82–92% activity when pH was greater than 4 and 42%-92% activity at or below 50°C. LacA was completely inhibited by 0.1 mM L-cysteine, 1 mM Dithiothreitol, and 10 mM metal ions, Ca2+, Mg2+ and Co2+. LacA had good affinity for ABTS, with a Km of 49.1 μM and a kcat of 3078.9 s-1. It decolorized synthetic dyes at 32.3–87.1%. In the presence of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT), LacA decolorized recalcitrant dyes such as Safranine (97.1%), Methylene Blue (98.9%), Azure Blue (96.6%) and simulated textile effluent (84.6%). With supplemented manganese peroxidase (MnP), Mn2+ and HBT, the purified LacA and BBP6 fermentation broth showed great potential in denim bleaching, with an up to 5-fold increase in reflectance values."
https://openalex.org/W2888201043,"Bladder cancer therapy relies on aggressive treatments highlighting the need for new, targeted therapies with reduced side effects. SWI/SNF complexes are mutated in ~20% across human cancers and dependency of SWI/SNF-deficient tumors on EZH2 has been uncovered recently. To systematically dissect the frequency of genetic alterations in SWI/SNF complexes potentially contributing to their inactivation, mutations and copy number variations in 25 SWI/SNF subunit genes were analyzed making use of publicly available sequencing data for 408 muscle-invasive bladder carcinoma samples. ARID1A truncating mutations were identified as the by far most common alterations of SWI/SNF complexes in urothelial bladder cancer. As current ARID1A protein expression data in bladder cancer are inconsistent and incomplete we examined if the frequency of truncating ARID1A mutations translates into a similar frequency of cases showing ARID1A protein loss. We applied a validated ARID1A antibody conducting a comprehensive immunohistochemistry-based expression analysis in urothelial bladder cancer (n = 362) including carcinoma in situ (CIS) cases. While observing increased median ARID1A protein levels in all carcinoma subgroups compared to normal urothelial controls (n = 21), the percentage of cases showing ARID1A protein loss was positively correlated with increasing stage and grade culminating in a rate of 14.1% in muscle-invasive disease. ARID1A-depletion did neither increase EZH2 protein or trimethylated H3K27 levels in vitro nor did ARID1A expression correlate with EZH2 or H3K27me3 amounts in human bladder carcinomas. Importantly, ARID1A-deficiency was neither associated with enhanced sensitivity towards inhibition of EZH2 enzymatic activity nor depletion of EZH2 protein. In summary, ARID1A truncating mutations, potentially translating into ARID1A protein loss in a subset of high-grade bladder cancers, are the most common SWI/SNF genetic alterations in bladder cancer. Our data do not support ARID1A-deficiency as predictive biomarker for EZH2-inhibitor treatment response in bladder cancer underlining the need for future bladder cancer-specific, drug screens for successfull discovery of ARID1A-deficiency-based targeted drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2888625858,"The large-bodied, terrestrial primates in the tribe Papionini are among the most intensely studied animals in the world, yet for some members of this tribe we know comparatively little about their evolutionary history and phylogeography. Geladas (Theropithecus gelada Rüppell, 1835), endemic primates of the Ethiopian highlands, are largely unstudied both in genetic diversity and intrageneric phylogeny. Currently, a northern and central subspecies and one isolated southern population are recognized, of which the central is classified as Least Concern, the northern as Vulnerable, and the southern is not yet assessed. The distribution and taxonomy of the subspecies remain poorly defined. Here, we estimate the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) diversity and phylogenetic relationships among gelada mtDNA lineages based on samples across the entire species range. We analysed 1.7 kb-long sequences of the mtDNA genome, spanning the cytochrome b gene and the hypervariable region I of the D-loop, derived from 162 faecal samples. We detected five major haplogroups or clades (south, central-1, central-2, north-1, north-2) which diverged between 0.67 and 0.43 million years ago, thus suggesting a rapid radiation, resulting in largely unresolved intrageneric phylogenetic relationships. Both, the northern and central demes contain two similarly valid haplogroups, each with little or no geographic segregation among respective haplogroups. Effective population sizes of the northern and central demes decreased during and after the last glacial maximum but remained stable for the southern deme, although on a very low level. The distribution of haplogroups within the geographic ranges of the putative gelada subspecies indicates that mtDNA sequence information does not allow reliable taxonomic inferences and thus is not sufficient for solving the taxonomic rank of the three demic populations, with the possible exception of the southern population. Nevertheless, due to the genetic differences all three populations deserve conservation efforts, in particular the smallest southern population."
https://openalex.org/W2888064405,"Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with antiretroviral medication is an effective, evidence-based option for HIV prevention. In England, issues of cost-effectiveness and of responsibility for commissioning prevention services have so far led National Health Service (NHS) England to decide not to commission PrEP. Given the significant lag between the awareness of PrEP efficacy and the opportunity to obtain PrEP through traditional health care routes, many gay and other men who have sex with men (MSM) have turned to ‘DIY PrEP’, purchasing generic formulations of PrEP for themselves on the internet or via other alternative routes. However, there is very little research on DIY PrEP practices and no qualitative study with DIY PrEP users in the UK. A formative qualitative study was conducted in 2017 to inform the development of an intervention (PrEP Club) to support DIY PrEP users and improve the safety and experience of this prevention strategy. Focus groups were held with 20 MSM who are based in London and are obtaining PrEP through means other than clinical trials, to explore their accounts of sourcing and using PrEP and the experiential meanings of these. In this article, we report findings from this first, formative study and present the different practices involved in finding out about PrEP, buying it and ascertaining legitimacy of sellers and products. We reflect on the uncertainties participants described related to actually using PrEP, including deciding on drug dosing and monitoring their health. Finally, we present the results of the discussions participants had about the kind of support they had received, the help they would have liked, and their views on proposed interventions to support DIY PrEP users, such as PrEP Club."
https://openalex.org/W2888680323,"Various studies suggest the importance of sport-specific cognitive and perceptual abilities in soccer. However, the role of general perceptual-cognitive abilities and the relation of age respective to position have not been clarified for soccer in detail. Therefore, it was the objective of the present study to determine the relation of age and position to general perceptual-cognitive abilities. 178 highly talented male soccer players (mean age 16.2, age range 10 to 33 years) were involved. The participants performed computer-based sustained attention and anticipation (using Vienna Test System) tests. 139 subjects (mean age 16.6) took part in visual and acoustic reaction tests (using Talent Diagnostic System). The soccer players, subdivided into age and position groups, were recruited from a youth academy of a professional soccer club and played at the highest and 2nd highest national soccer competition for their age. Group differences were tested using analysis of variance. Correlations were analyzed for age and abilities. Significant correlations and group differences were found for age and sustained attention tasks. Significant differences for position groups were observed with regard to acoustic reaction time (ART). Further, we found statistical tendencies for group differences regarding the visual reaction time (VRT), indicating that midfielders outperform defenders and strikers in simple reaction tasks. Improved skills in sustained attention tasks resulted for defenders, who worked faster and more precisely in figural tasks. Regarding general anticipation tasks differences were not found. No group differences were found in basic anticipation tasks. Our study indicates that additional research is needed to further clarify the development of general perceptual-cognitive abilities and position-specific differences in the above abilities of highly talented soccer players."
https://openalex.org/W2888116354,"We examined 20,648 prokaryotic unique taxids with respect to the annotation of the 3' end of the 16S rRNA, which contains the anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequence. We used the sequence of highly conserved helix 45 of the 16S rRNA as a guide. By this criterion, 8,153 annotated 3' ends correctly included the anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequence, but 12,495 were foreshortened or otherwise mis-annotated, missing part or all of the anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequence, which immediately follows helix 45. We re-annotated, giving a total of 20,648 16S rRNA 3' ends. The vast majority indeed contained a consensus anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequence, embedded in a highly conserved 13 base ""tail"". However, 128 exceptional organisms had either a variant anti-Shine-Dalgarno, or no recognizable anti-Shine-Dalgarno, in their 16S rRNA(s). For organisms both with and without an anti-Shine-Dalgarno, we identified the Shine-Dalgarno motifs actually enriched in front of each organism's open reading frames. This showed to what extent the Shine-Dalgarno motifs correlated with anti-Shine Dalgarno motifs. In general, organisms whose rRNAs lacked a perfect anti-Shine-Dalgarno motif also lacked a recognizable Shine-Dalgarno. For organisms whose 16S rRNAs contained a perfect anti-Shine-Dalgarno motif, a variety of results were obtained. We found one genus, Alteromonas, where several taxids apparently maintain two different types of 16S rRNA genes, with different, but conserved, antiSDs. The fact that some organisms do not seem to have or use Shine-Dalgarno motifs supports the idea that prokaryotes have other robust mechanisms for recognizing start codons for translation."
https://openalex.org/W2888023997,"Plants in arid zones are constantly exposed to drought stress. The ASR protein family (Abscisic, Stress, Ripening) -a subgroup of the late embryogenesis abundant superfamily- is involved in the water stress response and adaptation to dry environments. Tomato ASR1, as well as other members of this family, is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) that functions as a transcription factor and a chaperone. Here we employed different biophysical techniques to perform a deep in vitro characterization of ASR1 as an IDP and showed how both environmental factors and in vivo targets modulate its folding. We report that ASR1 adopts different conformations such as α-helix or polyproline type II in response to environmental changes. Low temperatures and low pH promote the polyproline type II conformation (PII). While NaCl increases PII content and slightly destabilizes α-helix conformation, PEG and glycerol have an important stabilizing effect of α-helix conformation. The binding of Zn2+in the low micromolar range promotes α-helix folding, while extra Zn2+ results in homo-dimerization. The ASR1-DNA binding is sequence specific and dependent on Zn2+. ASR1 chaperone activity does not change upon the structure induction triggered by the addition of Zn2+. Furthermore, trehalose, which has no effect on the ASR1 structure by itself, showed a synergistic effect on the ASR1-driven heat shock protection towards the reporter enzyme citrate synthase (CS). These observations prompted the development of a FRET reporter to sense ASR1 folding in vivo. Its performance was confirmed in Escherichia coli under saline and osmotic stress conditions, representing a promising probe to be used in plant cells. Overall, this work supports the notion that ASR1 plasticity is a key feature that facilitates its response to drought stress and its interaction with specific targets."
https://openalex.org/W2888060748,"In the summer of 1845, under the command of Sir John Franklin, 128 officers and men aboard Royal Navy ships HMS Erebus and HMS Terror sailed into Lancaster Sound and entered the waters of Arctic North America. The goal of this expedition was to complete the discovery of a northwest passage by navigating the uncharted area between Barrow Strait and Simpson Strait. Franklin and his crew spent the first winter at Beechey Island, where three crewmen died and were buried. In September 1846, the ships became stranded in ice off the northwest coast of King William Island, where they remained until April 1848. At that time, the crew, reduced to 105, deserted the ships and retreated south along the island’s western and southern shores in a desperate attempt to reach the mainland and via the Back River, to obtain aid at a Hudson’s Bay Company Post. Sadly, not one individual survived. Previous analyses of bone, hair, and soft tissue samples from expedition remains found that crewmembers’ tissues contained elevated lead (Pb) levels, suggesting that Pb poisoning may have contributed to their demise; however, questions remain regarding the timing and degree of exposure and, ultimately, the extent to which the crewmembers may have been impacted. To address this historical question, we investigated three hypotheses. First, if elevated Pb exposure was experienced by the crew during the expedition, we hypothesized that those sailors who survived longer (King William Island vs. Beechey Island) would exhibit more extensive uptake of Pb in their bones and vice versa. Second, we hypothesized that Pb would be elevated in bone microstructural features forming at or near the time of death compared with older tissue. Finally, if Pb exposure played a significant role in the failure of the expedition we hypothesized that bone samples would exhibit evidence of higher and more sustained uptake of Pb than that of a contemporary comparator naval population from the 19th century. To test these hypotheses, we analyzed bone and dental remains of crew members and compared them against samples derived from the Royal Navy cemetery in Antigua. Synchrotron-based high resolution confocal X-ray fluorescence imaging was employed to visualize Pb distribution within bone and tooth microstructures at the micro scale. The data did not support our first hypothesis as Pb distribution within the samples from the two different sites was similar. Evidence of Pb within skeletal microstructural features formed near the time of death lent support to our second hypothesis but consistent evidence of a marked elevation in Pb levels was lacking. Finally, the comparative analysis with the Antigua samples did not support the hypothesis that the Franklin sailors were exposed to an unusually high level of Pb for the time period. Taken all together our skeletal microstructural results do not support the conclusion that Pb played a pivotal role in the loss of Franklin and his crew."
https://openalex.org/W2888353926,"This paper estimates the influence of inadequate access to healthcare services on the rate of Emergency Room (ER) hospital visits in Australia. We take micro-data on different types of healthcare shortfalls from the 2012 Australian Survey of Disability, Aging and Carers, and employ Propensity Score Matching (PSM) techniques to identify their effects on ER visits. We find that shortfalls in access to various medical services increases ER visits for individuals with mental and physical conditions by about the same degree. Conversely, inadequate community care services significantly predict ER visits for individuals with physical conditions, but not for persons with mental conditions. The lack of predictive power for inadequate community care for persons with mental health problems is surprising, as “acopia” is thought to be a significant driver of crises that require emergency treatment. We discuss some of the mechanisms that may underpin this finding and address the policy implications of our results. Lastly a number of robustness checks and diagnostics tests are presented which confirm that our modelling assumptions are not violated and that our results are insensitive to the choice of matching algorithms."

Growers usually depend on chemical insecticides to control this pest, but demand for more environmentally-friendly means of controlling pests is increasing. At least 91 plant extracts have been reported to be effective against other lepidopterans, but their acute toxicity against G. molesta has rarely been studied. Among these 91 materials, we assessed the residual toxicity of 32 extracts against first instar larvae (< 5 h old) of G. molesta in the laboratory. Nicotiana tabacum L., used at the concentration of 2 mg/ml, showed the highest corrected mortality (92.0%) with a lethal time (LT50) value of 12.9 h. The extract was followed in its efficacy by Allium sativum L. (88.0%), Zanthoxylum piperitum (L.) De Candolle (70.0%), and Sapindus mukorossi Gaertner (65.0%), when mortality was assessed at 20 h after exposure. Against adult fruit moths (< 5 d old), N. tabacum also showed the highest corrected mortality among tested extracts, being 85 and 100% in adult females and males, respectively, at 168 h after exposure. However, there was no synergistic effect of the combined application of any of the top four extracts in either laboratory or greenhouse assays. Oviposition by G. molesta on peach twigs was reduced 85–90% when N. tabacum was applied at 4 ml/ twig compared to control (methanol), demonstrating that N. tabacum may have potential for use as a botanical insecticide against G. molesta."

Identified eyes were classified by simplified AREDS categories, and analyzed for the primary endpoint of new CNV after treatment.The EMR revealed SDM was offered to 373/392 (95%) patients with dry AMD and elected by 363/373 (97%) between 2008-2017. Follow up was available for 354/363 patients (547 eyes, 98%) (range 6-108 mos., avg. 22).

New CNV developed in 9/547 eyes (1.6%, annualized rate 0.87%). Visual acuity was unchanged. There were no adverse treatment effects.In a review of a large group of eyes with exceptionally high-risk AMD, SDM was followed by a very low incidence of new CNV. If confirmed by further study, SDM would offer a new and highly effective treatment to reduce the risk of vision loss from AMD."
https://openalex.org/W2888267609,"Accidents, bad weathers, traffic congestions, etc. led to the uncertainties of travel times in real-life road networks, which greatly affected the quality of individual's life and the reliability of transportation system. This paper addressed the school bus routing problem in such a stochastic and time-dependent road environment. Firstly, the problem was set based on a single-school configuration, and the students were picked up at their homes, which was in line with the current situation of school bus systems in China. Thus, it could be regarded as an independent problem of school bus route generation in random dynamic networks, which could be solved as a variant of extended Vehicle Routing Problem. However, due to the fluctuation and uncertainty of link travel times, the arrival time at each stop including the destination was varying. Therefore, the selection of optimal path connecting the current service node with the next one was treated as a sub-problem in this study, where the reliability of travel times in the stochastic and time-varying network was highly concerned by such time-rigid commuters. To this end, a Robust Optimal Schedule Times model with a hard time windows constraint was built to generate a most cost-reliable route for school buses. By the use of Robust Optimization method, it was intended to minimize the worst-case total cost which combined the cost of earlier schedule delays with the disutility of travel times. It was also proved that the proposed model could be converted into solving a conventional problem in deterministic dynamic networks for a reduction of computation complexity, which provided the potential of applying to the practical problems. Finally, the validity of the proposed model and its performance evaluation was analyzed through a small-scale computational instance, where all the link travel times in the simulated network were attributed to both time-varying and stochastic. Then, a mathematical programming solver was used to find the exact optimal solution. The results indicated that the model was valid, and the necessity of considering the stochastic and time-dependent nature of transportation networks was also confirmed in the case study."
https://openalex.org/W2888081294,"NHLRC2 (NHL repeat-containing protein 2) is an essential protein. Mutations of NHLRC2, including Asp148Tyr, have been recently associated with a novel FINCA disease (fibrosis, neurodegeneration, cerebral angiomatosis), which is fatal in early childhood. To gain insight into the mechanisms of action of this essential protein, we determined the crystal structure of the Trx-like and NHL repeat β-propeller domains of human NHLRC2 to a resolution of 2.7 Å. The structure reveals two domains adjacent to each other that form a cleft containing a conserved CCINC motif. A SAXS structure of full-length NHLRC2 reveals that the non-conserved C-terminal domain does not pack against the N-terminal domains. Analysis of the surface properties of the protein identifies an extended negative electrostatic potential in the surface of the cleft formed by the two domains, which likely forms a binding site for a ligand or interaction partner(s). Bioinformatics analysis discovers homologs across a range of eukaryotic and prokaryotic species and conserved residues map mostly to the adjacent surfaces of the Trx-like and β-propeller domains that form the cleft, suggesting both that this forms the potential functional site of NHLRC2 and that the function is conserved across species. Asp148 is located in the Trx-like domain and is not conserved across species. The Asp148Tyr mutation destabilizes the structure of the protein by 2°C. The NHLRC2 structure, the first of any of its homologs, provides an important step towards more focused structure-function studies of this essential protein."
https://openalex.org/W2888201648,"One strategy to prevent urinary tract infections is the use of natural products such as cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) and propolis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of these products alone and combined on the motility and biofilm formation of a collection of representative uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). Motility was evaluated by the swarming and swimming capacity of the isolates in presence/absence of cranberry ± propolis. Early and late biofilm formation was observed with the Biofilm Ring test (BioFilm Control) and the crystal violet method. Cranberry alone was seen to have a variable effect on motility and biofilm formation unrelated to bacterial characteristics, but a reduced motility and biofilm formation was observed for all the isolates in the presence of cranberry + propolis. These results suggest that cranberry alone doesn’t work on all the E. coli strains and propolis potentiates the effect of cranberry on UPEC, representing a new strategy to prevent recurrent urinary tract infections."
https://openalex.org/W2888095726,"To reduce nutrient pollution in urban watersheds, residents need to voluntarily practice a range of stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs). However, little is known about the underlying social factors that may act as barriers to BMP implementation. The overall goal of this study was to better understand barriers to BMP implementation by exploring the links among resident demographics, knowledge, and behaviors so that appropriate education can be more effectively developed and targeted. In 2014–2015, a detailed questionnaire was administered door-to-door to 299 randomly selected households in two sub-watersheds of the Chesapeake Bay basin to test relationships among resident demographics, knowledge and attitudes towards water resources and BMPs, and BMP implementation. Multifactor regression models showed that respondents who had greater knowledge of water resources and BMPs lived in households that implemented greater numbers of BMPs. In turn, resident BMP knowledge, or familiarity with BMPs, strongly varied with race and ownership status, with respondents who identified as Caucasian or within a collection of ‘Other’ races, and who were home owners, having greater BMP knowledge than respondents who identified as African American and who were home renters, respectively. Renters and members of homeowner’s associations were also less likely to implement BMPs independent of knowledge, possibly reflecting perceived or real bureaucratic or procedural barriers to good stormwater management. Overall, respondents preferred to receive educational materials on stormwater via pamphlets and YouTube videos. These results suggest that resident ownership status knowledge is important to determining the number of household BMPs, and that education outreach should probably target African American and renting households that have lower BMP knowledge and landlords and administrators of homeowner’s associations using well-planned print and video educational media."

Moreover, the cancer cell resistance to anti-angiogenic therapies is deeply mediated by the communication between tumor cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)—the most important microenvironmental cells for the coordination of all supportive processes in tumor development. Thus, simultaneous targeting of TAMs and cancer cells could improve the outcome of the anti-angiogenic therapies. Since our previous studies proved that simvastatin (SIM) exerts strong antiproliferative actions on B16.F10 murine melanoma cells via reduction of TAMs-mediated oxidative stress and inhibition of intratumor production of HIF-1α, we investigated whether the antitumor efficacy of the anti-angiogenic agent—5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA) could be improved by its co-administration with the lipophilic statin. Our results provide confirmatory evidence for the ability of the combined treatment to suppress the aggressive phenotype of the B16.F10 melanoma cells co-cultured with TAMs under hypoxia-mimicking conditions in vitro. Thus, proliferation and migration capacity of the melanoma cells were strongly decelerated after the co-administration of SIM and DMXAA. Moreover, our data suggested that the anti-oxidant action of the combined treatment, as a result of melanogenesis stimulation, might be the principal cause for the simultaneous suppression of key molecules involved in melanoma cell aggressiveness, present in melanoma cells (HIF-1α) as well as in TAMs (arginase-1). Finally, the concomitant suppression of these proteins might have contributed to a very strong inhibition of the angiogenic capacity of the cell co-culture microenvironment."

We aimed to present the current situation of obesity in Jiangsu Province and explore the relationship between obesity and other common diseases in children.Physical examination among children aged 7 to 14 years in Jiangsu Province was conducted since 2014, and more than one third primary schools were covered annually. The physical measurements included body height, weight, blood pressure, vision, sex, age, and so on.The prevalence of overweight and obesity among primary school children was 15.2% (18.7% for male students and 11.0% for female students), and 11.7% (14.5% for male students and 8.2% for female students) respectively. Obesity/overweight prevalence varied by regions. Among them the lowest prevalence was found in the southern region of Jiangsu Province, where residents had the highest average income level. Obesity group had elevated blood pressure comparing with the normal group, and obesity group especially in the male children aged 7 to 12 years had a higher prevalence of uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) than that of normal group.This study found that obesity/overweight prevalence differed by sex, age, and regions in Jiangsu Province. In addition, obese children were closely associated with other common disease. Further studies are needed to explore the basis of biological and statistical theories."
https://openalex.org/W2888034265,"A common denominator for patients with heart failure is the correlation between elevated serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines and adverse clinical outcomes. Furthermore, lipoxygenase-induced inflammation is reportedly involved in the pathology of heart failure. Cardiac fibroblasts, which are abundant in cardiac tissue, are known to be activated by inflammation. We previously showed high expression of the lipoxygenase arachidonate 15 lipoxygenase (ALOX15), which catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to 15-hydroxy eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE), in ischemic cardiac tissue. The exact roles of ALOX15 and 15-HETE in the pathogenesis of heart failure are however unknown. Biopsies were collected from all chambers of explanted failing human hearts from heart transplantation patients, as well as from the left ventricles from organ donors not suffering from chronic heart failure. Biopsies from the left ventricles underwent quantitative immunohistochemical analysis for ALOX15/B. Gene expression of ALOX enzymes, as well as 15-HETE levels, were examined in cardiac fibroblasts which had been cultured in either hypoxic or normoxic conditions after isolation from failing hearts. After the addition of fibroblast supernatants to human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, intracellular calcium concentrations were measured to examine the effect of paracrine signaling on cardiomyocyte beating frequency. While ALOX15 and ALOX15B were expressed throughout failing hearts as well as in hearts from organ donors, ALOX15 was expressed at significantly higher levels in donor hearts. Hypoxia resulted in a significant increase in gene and protein expression of ALOX15 and ALOX15B in fibroblasts isolated from the different chambers of failing hearts. Finally, preconditioned medium from hypoxic fibroblasts decreased the beating frequency of human cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells in an ALOX15-dependent manner. In summary, our results demonstrate that ALOX15/B signaling by hypoxic cardiac fibroblasts may play an important role in ischemic cardiomyopathy, by decreasing cardiomyocyte beating frequency."
https://openalex.org/W2888420043,"Language in its highest complexity is a unique human faculty with simultaneous translation being among the most demanding language task involving both linguistic and executive functions. In this context, bilingually grown up individuals as well as simultaneous interpreters (SIs) represent appropriate groups for studying expertise-related neural adaptations in the human brain. The present study was performed to examine if a domain-specific neural network activation pattern, constituted by brain regions involved in speech processing as well as cognitive control mechanisms can be detected during a task-free resting state condition. To investigate this, electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded from 16 SIs and 16 age and gender-matched multilingual control subjects. Graph-theoretical network analyses revealed interhemispheric hyperconnectivity between the ventral part of the prefrontal cortex (pars opercularis and pars triangularis) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in language experts compared to multilingual controls in the alpha frequency range. This finding suggests that the high cognitive demands placed on simultaneous interpreting lead to an increased neural communication between prefrontal brain regions essentially engaged in supporting executive control-a neural fingerprint that is even detectable during rest."
https://openalex.org/W2888521846,"Introduction Meeting targets of the Sustainable Development Goals in the domain of maternal health and the Family Planning 2020 commitments for Cameroon requires an increased use of modern contraception. Long acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) are methods which have been proven highly efficient with contraceptive failure rates of less than 1%. The objective of this survey was to determine the contraceptive method mix in the Biyem-Assi Health District and identify factors associated to the use of LARCs. Methodology A cross-sectional community-based study was conducted from March 2015 to April 2015 targeting current female contraceptive users of childbearing age in the Biyem-Assi Health District. A multistep cluster sampling was used and data collected by trained surveyors using a pretested and validated questionnaire. Data were analysed using the statistical software Epi-Info version 3.5.4. Logistic regressions were used to identify associations between the use of LARCs and selected covariates and the strength of association measured with the odds ratio. Results A total of 437 eligible women were included in the survey. Their mean age was 26.7±5.8 years and 45.8% were in a union. The contraceptive method mix decreased in this order; male condoms (76.0%), female condoms (7.6%), oral contraceptive pills (5.0%), implants (4.6%), and intrauterine devices (3.4%) giving us a LARC rate of 8%. Only 54.0% and 46.9% of the participants reported to be knowledgeable of the implant and intrauterine device respectively. Their contraceptive choices were determined principally by perceived efficiency and accessibility. The major factor significantly associated to LARC use was the number of living children above 2 (AOR = 3.90[1.53–9.94], p-value = 0.004). Though not statistically significant, associations were found between LARC use and other factors like marital status, level of education, religion and future fertility desire. Conclusion The rate of use of LARCs is still very low among these women. The number of living children is significantly associated with the use of LARCs. The local family planning policy makers should intensify sensitization on the benefits and side effects of modern contraception and LARCs in order to create more awareness and improve contraceptive uptake."
https://openalex.org/W2888619748,"Toll like receptors (TLRs) are important pattern recognition receptors that can detect pathogen and danger associated molecular patterns to initiate an innate immune response. TLR1 and 2 heterodimerize at the plasma membrane upon binding to triacylated lipopeptides from bacterial cell walls, or to the synthetic ligand Pam3CSK4. TLR1/2 dimers interact with adaptor molecules TIRAP and MyD88 to initiate a signalling cascade that leads to activation of key transcription factors, including NF-kB. Despite TLRs being extensively studied over the last two decades, the real-time kinetics of ligand binding and receptor activation remains largely unexplored. We aimed to study the kinetics of TLR activation and recruitment of adaptors, using TLR1/2 dimer interactions with adaptors MyD88 and TIRAP. Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) allows detection of real-time protein-protein interactions in living cells, and was applied to study adaptor recruitment to TLRs. Energy transfer showed interactions between TLR2 and TIRAP, and between TLR2 and MyD88 only in the presence of TIRAP. Quantitative BRET and confocal microscopy confirmed that TIRAP is necessary for MyD88 interaction with TLR2. Furthermore, constitutive proximity between the proteins in the absence of Pam3CSK4 stimulation was observed with BRET, and was not abrogated with lowered protein expression, changes in protein tagging strategies, or use of the brighter NanoLuc luciferase. However, co-immunoprecipitation studies did not demonstrate constitutive interaction between these proteins, suggesting that the interaction observed with BRET likely represents artefacts of protein overexpression. Thus, caution should be taken when utilizing protein overexpression in BRET studies and in investigations of the TLR pathway."

This study aimed to estimate the prevalences of self-reported physician-diagnosed chronic diseases among urban and rural populations aged 15 years and older in Shaanxi Province, China, during 2003-2013 and explore how these changes differ by subpopulation.Three independent cross-sectional surveys were implemented in 2003, 2008 and 2013 in Shaanxi Province. A multistage stratified cluster random sampling method was used in each wave to collect representative samples. In total, 10,568 residents in 2003, 15,453 in 2008 and 48,808 in 2013 were included in this analysis. Information on self-reported physician-diagnosed chronic diseases was collected using face-to-face interviews in each survey. Multilevel Poisson regression with robust error variance was employed to calculate the adjusted prevalence ratios to estimate the relative change in chronic conditions in 2008 and 2013, compared to that in 2003.In 2013, 23.9%/22.1% of urban/rural residents, respectively, reported having at least one chronic condition, which represents an increase from 17.0%/15.1%, respectively, in 2008 and 12.8%/10.9%, respectively, in 2003. Adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics, the prevalence of chronic diseases was significantly higher in 2013 than that in 2003. Among the chronic diseases studied, the prevalence of hypertension and diabetes has increased dramatically over a decade. The increase in chronic diseases occurred mainly among the middle-aged and elderly.Chronic diseases are highly prevalent and continuously increasing in the adult population in Shaanxi Province from 2003 to 2013. Given its large aging population, China may face a greater chronic disease burden. A national chronic disease surveillance system and screening program should be established to acquire comprehensive information regarding the distribution and trends of chronic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2888734709,"Transcription of a gene can be regulated at many different levels. One such fundamental level is interaction between protein and DNA. Protein(s) binds to distinct sites on the DNA, which activate, enhance or repress transcription. Despite being such an important process, very few tools exist to identify the proteins that interact with chromosome, most of which are in vitro in nature. Here, we propose an in vivo based method for identification of DNA binding protein(s) in bacteria where the DNA-protein complex formed in vivo is crosslinked by formaldehyde. This complex is further isolated and the bound proteins are identified. The method was used to isolate promoter DNA binding proteins, which bind and regulate the dsz operon in Gordonia sp. IITR 100 responsible for biodesulfurization of organosulfurs. The promoter binding proteins were identified by MALDI ToF MS/MS and the binding was confirmed by gel shift assay. Unlike other reported in vivo methods, this improved method does not require sequence of the whole genome or a chip and can be scaled up to improve yields."

A total of 120 apolipoprotein E-deficient mice (apoE-/- mice) were randomly divided into five groups, including the vehicle alone, scrambled RNAi, Lp-PLA2 RNAi, YKL-40 RNAi, and combined Lp-PLA2 and YKL-40 RNAi groups. Constrictive collars were used to induce plaque formation. Lp-PLA2 RNAi and YKL-40 RNAi viral suspensions were transduced into carotid plaques of the mice. Carotid plaques were harvested for histological analysis four weeks after viral vector transduction. Inflammatory gene expression in the plasma and atherosclerotic plaques was determined by ELISA and real-time PCR. Four weeks after RNAi, the serum concentration and plaque mRNA expression of Lp-PLA2 and YKL-40 were remarkably attenuated, leading to reduced inflammatory gene expression. Plaques from the Lp-PLA2 or YKL-40 RNAi group showed lower lipid content, higher collagen content, increased fibrous cap thickness, and lower mRNA expressions of MCP-1 and MMP-8 than than those in the vehicle and scramble groups. When compared with the isolated Lp-PLA2 or YKL-40 RNAi group, the combined Lp-PLA2 and YKL-40 RNAi group exhibited higher collagen content and fibrous cap thickness, and lower lipid content and local inflammation. The beneficial effects of RNAi were independent of the plasma lipoprotein profile. Combined RNAi of Lp-PLA2 and YKL-40 is superior to RNAi of Lp-PLA2 or YKL-40 alone in ameliorating atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2888027799,"Background According to James Fries morbidity compression is present if morbidity rates are decreasing to a larger extent than mortality rates. Compression also occurs if age at onset is increasing at a faster pace than age at death. These two variants of the compression hypothesis were formulated as a population concept. Compression has seldom been studied with a specific disease as application. Methods Morbidity compression was examined in terms of myocardial infarction (MI) by using German claims data covering the years 2006 to 2015. The findings are based on an annual case number of about 2 m women and men aged 18 years and older. Analyses were performed by means of proportional hazards regression and by using linear regression. Results Decreases of morbidity rates were more pronounced than those of mortality. For men, the hazard ratio for contracting MI in 2015 as compared to 2006 was hr = 0.66 and hr = 0.71 for the female population. The respective results for mortality were hr = 0.75 in men and hr = 1.0 in women. They can be interpreted in favor of morbidity compression. For the subgroup of women and men with MI, changes of onset age revealed marked gender differences. For 2015 as compared with 2006, age at MI-occurrence in men increased by 10.5 months as compared to an increase of 10.4 months for age at death. In women changes were smaller and statistically not significant. The findings referring to women have to be interpreted against the backdrop of higher onset age and higher age at death than in men. Conclusions Taken together, morbidity compression has occurred in terms of decreasing MI-rates as well as in terms of increased onset age in men. It can be concluded that both processes have led to an improvement of healthy lifetime. Decreasing morbidity rates in women are also pointing towards morbidity compression, a finding that is not complemented by changes of onset age. Our data are demonstrating that morbidity rates and age at onset may vary independently. From this perspective morbidity compression is a multi-faceted phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W2888286530,"Three-dimensional (3D) computational aortic models have been established to reproduce aortic diseases such as aortic aneurysm and dissection; however, no such models have been developed to study diabetes mellitus (DM). To characterize biomechanical properties of the human aorta with DM, reconstructed aortic CT images were converted into DICOM format, and imported into the 3D segmentation using Mimics software. This resulted in a 3D reconstruction of the complete aorta, including three branches. We applied a pulsatile blood pressure waveform for the ascending aorta to provide a biomimetic environment using COMSOL Multiphysics software. Hemodynamics were compared between the control and DM models. We observed that mean blood flow velocity, aortic pressure, and von Mises stress values were lower in the DM model than in the control model. Furthermore, the range of aortic movement was lower in the DM model than in the control model, suggesting that the DM aortic wall is more susceptible to rupture. When comparing biomechanical properties in discrete regions of the aorta, all values were higher in the ascending aorta for both control and DM models, corresponding to the location of most aortic lesions. We have developed a compute based that integrates advanced image processing strategies and computational techniques based on finite element method to perform hemodynamics analysis based on CT images. Our study of image-based CFD analysis hopes to provide a better understanding of the relationship between aortic hemodynamic and developing pathophysiology of aortic diseases."

The aim of this study was to quantify incidence and characteristics of injuries in elite youth field hockey players during a major international tournament. Standardized reporting forms detailing time, location on pitch, mechanism and anatomical location of injury were completed for new musculoskeletal conditions resulting in a time stoppage by the umpire and where a player was noticeably affected by an injury for up to 20 s regardless of time stoppage. Injury incidence was 1.35 and 2.20 injuries/match or 53 and 86 injuries per 1000 player match hours for boys (B) and girls (G) respectively; girls were over three times more likely to have a minor injury. Most injuries were contusions due to being hit by the ball or stick (B: 12, G: 27), with high numbers of injuries to the torso (B: 8) and head/face (G: 7). Injuries during the penalty corner (B: 3, G: 4) were to the lower limb and hand, and boys were less likely to wear facial protection (B: 65.9%, G: 86.4%). Results form an essential initial dataset of injuries in U18 field hockey players. Current reporting protocols under-report injuries and must be addressed by the international governing body. The high number of head/face injuries, particularly in females, requires further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W4246236353,The aim of this study was to clarify whether serum matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP-3) levels are associated with an effect of iguratimod as add-on therapy to biological DMARDs (bDMARDs) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).Forty three patients with RA were treated with iguratimod as add-on therapy to bDMARDs. They were classified into remission and non-remission groups at 24 weeks of iguratimod therapy. Remission was defined as a state with a disease activity score (DAS) <2.6 in 28 joints (termed DAS remission) and total power Doppler ultrasound (US) score <3 (termed US remission). The serum MMP-3 levels at baseline and at 12 weeks were compared between these two groups.There were no significant differences in the serum MMP-3 levels at baseline between the DAS and US remission groups and the non-remission group. The serum MMP-3 levels at 12 weeks in the US remission group were significantly lower than those in the non-remission group. The ratios of the serum MMP-3 levels at baseline to those at 12 weeks in both the DAS and US remission groups were significantly lower than those in the non-remission group. An MMP-3 ratio <0.86 was determined as the cut-off value to predict US remission at 24 weeks.Our findings suggest that the ratios of the serum MMP-3 levels at baseline to those at 12 weeks could be used to predict remission in RA patients who are administered iguratimod as an add-on to bDMARDs.
https://openalex.org/W2888031465,"Little is known about the best strategy for weaning patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) from mechanical ventilation. Spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) using a T-piece or pressure-support ventilation (PSV) have a central role in this process. Our aim was to compare T-piece and PSV SBTs according to the duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) in patients with COPD.Patients with COPD who had at least 48 hours of invasive MV support were randomized to 30 minutes of T-piece or PSV at 10 cm H2O after being considered able to undergo a SBT. All patients were preemptively connected to non-invasive ventilation after extubation. Tracheostomized patients were excluded. The primary outcome was total invasive MV duration. Time to liberation from MV was assessed as secondary outcome.Between 2012 and 2016, 190 patients were randomized to T-piece (99) or PSV (91) groups. Extubation at first SBT was achieved in 78% of patients. The mean total MV duration was 10.82 ± 9.1 days for the T-piece group and 7.31 ± 4.9 days for the PSV group (p < 0.001); however, the pre-SBT duration also differed (7.35 ± 3.9 and 5.84 ± 3.3, respectively; p = 0.002). The time to liberation was 8.36 ± 11.04 days for the T-piece group and 4.06 ± 4.94 for the PSV group (univariate mean ratio = 2.06 [1.29-3.27], p = 0.003) for the subgroup of patients with difficult or prolonged weaning. The study group was independently associated with the time to liberation in this subgroup.The SBT technique did not influence MV duration for patients with COPD. For the difficult/prolonged weaning subgroup, the T-piece may be associated with a longer time to liberation, although this should be clarified by further studies.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01464567, at November 3, 2011."
https://openalex.org/W2888056471,"This study determined the effect of substitution of inpatient care from medical doctors (MDs) to physician assistants (PAs) on non-adherence to guidelines on medication prescribing.A multicenter matched-controlled study was performed comparing wards on which PAs provide medical care in collaboration with MDs (PA/MD model), with wards on which only MDs provide medical care (MD model). A set of 17 quality indicators to measure non-adherence to guidelines on medication prescribing by PAs and MDs was composed by 14 experts in a modified Delphi procedure. The indicators covered different pharmacotherapeutic subjects, such as gastric protection in case of use of NSAID or prevention of obstipation in case of use of opioids. These indicators were expressed in proportions by dividing the number of patients in which the prescriber did not adhere to a guideline, by all patients that were applicable. Multivariable regression analysis was performed in order to adjust for potential confounders.1021 patients from 17 hospital wards in the 'PA/MD model' group and 1286 patients from 17 hospital wards in the 'MD model' group were included. Two of the 17 quality indicators showed significantly less non-adherence to guidelines for the PA/MD model; the indicators concerning prescribing gastric protection in case of use of NSAID in combination with corticosteroids (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.19-0.90) and in case of use of NSAID in patients older than 70 years (OR 0.47, 95% 0.23-0.95). For none of the other quality indicators for prescribing of medication a difference between the MD model and the PA/MD model was found.This study suggests that the non-adherence to guidelines on medication prescribing on wards with the PA/MD model does not differ from wards with traditional house staffing by MDs only. Further research is needed to determine quality, efficiency and safety of prescribing behavior of PAs."
https://openalex.org/W2888402134,"Response of tumours to Hsp90 inhibitors is highly variable and their clinical effects are unpredictable, emphasising the need for a predictive marker. We postulated that sensitivity to Hsp90 inhibitors is connected to basal proteotoxic stress that makes cells dependent on Hsp90. Therefore, we assessed HSF1 as a general sensor of proteotoxic stress and correlated its activity with sensitivity to three separate small molecule Hsp90 inhibitors in seven breast cancer cell lines representing each of the different cancer subtypes. Flow cytometry was used to analyse the viability of breast cancer cell lines after Hsp90 inhibition. HSF1 activity was characterised by Ser326 phosphorylation and the transactivation capacity of HSF1 was determined by qPCR analysis of the ratios of HSF1-dependent (HOP, Hsp70) and HSF1-independent (CHIP) chaperones and cochaperone mRNAs. We show that the sensitivity of breast cancer cell lines to Hsp90 inhibition is highly variable. The basal levels of phosphorylated HSF1 also vary between cell lines and the magnitude of change in HSF1 phosphorylation after Hsp90 inhibition showed a negative correlation with sensitivity to Hsp90 inhibitors. Similarly, the basal transactivation capacity of HSF1, determined by the ratio of Hsp70 or HOP mRNA to CHIP mRNA level, is directly proportional to sensitivity to Hsp90 inhibitors. Increasing basal HSF1 activity by prior heat shock sensitised cells to Hsp90 inhibition. These results demonstrate that endogenous HSF1 activity varies between individual cancer cell lines and inversely reflects their sensitivity to Hsp90 inhibitors, suggesting that basal proteotoxic stress is an important and generalised predictor of response. Mechanistically, the data indicate that high endogenous proteotoxic stress levels sensitise to Hsp90 inhibition due to the inability to respond adequately to further proteotoxic stress. HSF1 activity therefore represents a potential biomarker for therapy with Hsp90 inhibitors, which may be useful for the rational design of future clinical studies."
https://openalex.org/W2888408565,"Thorough knowledge of the structure of analyzed data allows to form detailed scientific hypotheses and research questions. The structure of data can be revealed with methods for exploratory data analysis. Due to multitude of available methods, selecting those which will work together well and facilitate data interpretation is not an easy task. In this work we present a well fitted set of tools for a complete exploratory analysis of a clinical dataset and perform a case study analysis on a set of 515 patients. The proposed procedure comprises several steps: 1) robust data normalization, 2) outlier detection with Mahalanobis (MD) and robust Mahalanobis distances (rMD), 3) hierarchical clustering with Ward's algorithm, 4) Principal Component Analysis with biplot vectors. The analyzed set comprised elderly patients that participated in the PolSenior project. Each patient was characterized by over 40 biochemical and socio-geographical attributes. Introductory analysis showed that the case-study dataset comprises two clusters separated along the axis of sex hormone attributes. Further analysis was carried out separately for male and female patients. The most optimal partitioning in the male set resulted in five subgroups. Two of them were related to diseased patients: 1) diabetes and 2) hypogonadism patients. Analysis of the female set suggested that it was more homogeneous than the male dataset. No evidence of pathological patient subgroups was found. In the study we showed that outlier detection with MD and rMD allows not only to identify outliers, but can also assess the heterogeneity of a dataset. The case study proved that our procedure is well suited for identification and visualization of biologically meaningful patient subgroups."
https://openalex.org/W2888466085,"High-fat diet is associated with hypercholesterolemia and seminal alterations in White New Zealand rabbits. We have previously reported disorders in the development of the manchette-acrosome complex during spermiogenesis and decreased testicular efficiency in hypercholesterolemic rabbits. On the other hand, olive oil incorporated into the diet improves cholesterolemia and semen parameters affected in hypercholesterolemic rabbits. In this paper, we report the recovery—with the addition of olive oil to diet—from the sub-cellular mechanisms involved in the shaping of the sperm cell and testicular efficiency altered in hypercholesterolemic rabbits. Using morphological (structural, ultra-structural and immuno-fluorescence techniques) and cell biology techniques, a reorganization of the manchette and related structures was observed when olive oil was added to the high-fat diet. Specifically, actin filaments, microtubules and lipid rafts—abnormally distributed in hypercholesterolemic rabbits—were recovered with dietary olive oil supplementation. The causes of the decline in sperm count were studied in the previous report and here in more detail. These were attributed to the decrease in the efficiency index and also to the increase in the apoptotic percentage in testis from animals under the high-fat diet. Surprisingly, the addition of olive oil to the diet avoided the sub-cellular, efficiency and apoptosis changes observed in hypercholesterolemic rabbits. This paper reports the positive effects of the olive oil addition to the diet in the recovery of testicular efficiency and normal sperm shaping, mechanisms altered by hypercholesterolemia."
https://openalex.org/W2888077331,"The World Health Organization aims to eliminate HCV infection worldwide by 2030. A targeted HCV screening policy is currently unavailable in Thailand, but a decrease in HCV infection has been observed in the country. However, a previous study showed that there was a higher HCV seroprevalence in adults aged between 30–64 years in the Phetchabun province (15.5%), as compared to the Khon Kaen province (3.6%). It was hypothesized that young adults had a lower rate of HCV seropositivity; this was determined by the age distribution of anti-HCV in Phetchabun and with the identification of high seroprevalence birth cohorts. In order to compare the provincial findings to the national level, anti-HCV birth cohorts were further analyzed in Khon Kaen (averaged-HCV prevalence) as well as the Thai data set that was derived from the previous literature. Thai individuals aged between 18–30 years residing in Phetchabun (n = 1453) were recruited, tested for the presence of anti-HCV antibodies and viral RNA and completed questionnaires that were designed to identify HCV exposure risks. Data was collected and compiled from previously published articles (n = 1667, age 30–64 years). The HCV seropositivity in Phetchabun by age group (18–64, at 5-year intervals) and the birth year were tabulated parallel to the Khon Kaen data set (n = 2233) in conjunction with data from the national survey 2014 (n = 5964) representing the Thai population. Factors such as age, male gender, agricultural work, blood transfusion, intravenous drug use and having a tattoo were associated with anti-HCV positivity in Phetchabun. HCV seroprevalence was less than 4.0% (ranging from 0.0–3.5%) from the age of 18–34 years. A dramatic increase of 15.1% was found in adults aged greater than or equal to 35 years, whereas, the age group in Khon Kaen and the national population with increasing prevalence of HCV were older (≥40). The HCV seropositivity cohort accumulated for those born between 1951–1982 accounted for 71.4–100.0% of all seropositive individuals. Subsequently, new cases occurred sporadically. This finding provides evidence that there is a disproportionately high HCV seroprevalence among people born before 1983 (or aged ≥35). This cohort should be targeted for priority screening as part of the national HCV screening policy. Incorporating this birth cohort with other risk factors could improve HCV diagnostic rates, resulting in overall improvements in parallel to those given by novel antiviral treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2888274223,"The Shine-Dalgarno motif occurs in front of prokaryotic start codons, and is complementary to the 3’ end of the 16S ribosomal RNA. Hybridization between the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the anti-Shine-Dalgarno region of the16S rRNA (CCUCCU) directs the ribosome to the start AUG of the mRNA for translation. Shine-Dalgarno-like motifs (AGGAGG in E. coli) are depleted from open reading frames of most prokaryotes. This may be because hybridization of the 16S rRNA at Shine-Dalgarnos inside genes would slow translation or induce internal initiation. However, we analyzed 128 species from diverse phyla where the 16S rRNA gene(s) lack the anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequence, and so the 16S rRNA is incapable of interacting with Shine-Dalgarno-like sequences. Despite this lack of an anti-Shine-Dalgarno, half of these species still displayed depletion of Shine-Dalgarno-like sequences when analyzed by previous methods. Depletion of the same G-rich sequences was seen by these methods even in eukaryotes, which do not use the Shine-Dalgarno mechanism. We suggest previous methods are partly detecting a non-specific depletion of G-rich sequences. Alternative informatics approaches show that most prokaryotes have only slight, if any, specific depletion of Shine-Dalgarno-like sequences from open reading frames. Together with recent evidence that ribosomes do not pause at ORF-internal Shine-Dalgarno motifs, these results suggest the presence of ORF-internal Shine-Dalgarno-like motifs may be inconsequential, perhaps because internal regions of prokaryotic mRNAs may be structurally “shielded” from translation initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2888290767,"We discovered a transient adhesion property in poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate (PEG-DMA) hydrogels and employed it to develop a novel “stem cell bandage” model of cellular delivery. First, we cultured human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) on the surface of PEG-DMA hydrogels with high amounts of arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) adhesive peptides (RGD++) or without RGD (RGD-). On day 1, MSCs underwent an initial adhesion to RGD- hydrogels that was not significantly different over 13 days (n = 6). In addition, cells appeared to be well spread by day 3. Significantly fewer cells were present on RGD- hydrogels on day 15 compared to day 9, suggesting that RGD- hydrogels allow for an initial cellular adhesion that is stable for multiple days, but transient over longer periods with a decrease by day 15. This initial adhesion is especially surprising considering that PEG-DMA does not contain any biological adhesion motifs and is almost chemically identical to poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEG-DA), which has been shown to be non-adhesive without RGD. We hypothesized that MSCs could be cultured on RGD- PEG-DMA hydrogels and then applied to a wound site to deliver cells in a novel approach that we refer to as a “stem cell bandage”. RGD- donor hydrogels were successfully able to deliver MSCs to PEG-DMA acceptor hydrogels with high RGD content (RGD++) or low amounts of RGD (RGD+). Our novel “bandage” approach promoted cell delivery to these model surfaces while preventing cells from diffusing away. This stem cell delivery strategy may provide advantages over more common stem cell delivery approaches such as direct injections or encapsulation and thus may be valuable as an alternative tissue engineering approach."
https://openalex.org/W2888590724,"Considerable epidemiologic evidence and plausible biobehavioral mechanisms suggest that depression is an independent risk factor for diabetes. Moreover, reducing the elevated diabetes risk of depressed individuals is imperative given that both conditions are leading causes of death and disability. However, because no prior study has examined clinical diabetes outcomes among depressed patients at risk for diabetes, the question of whether depression treatment prevents or delays diabetes onset remains unanswered. Accordingly, we examined the effect of a 12-month collaborative care program for late-life depression on 9-year diabetes incidence among depressed, older adults initially free of diabetes. Participants were 119 primary care patients [M (SD) age: 67.2 (6.9) years, 41% African American] with a depressive disorder but without diabetes enrolled at the Indiana sites of the Improving Mood-Promoting Access to Collaborative Treatment (IMPACT) trial. Incident diabetes cases were defined as diabetes diagnoses, positive laboratory values, or diabetes medication prescription, and were identified using electronic medical record and Medicare/Medicaid data. Surprisingly, the rate of incident diabetes in the collaborative care group was 37% (22/59) versus 28% (17/60) in the usual care group. Even though the collaborative care group exhibited greater reductions in depressive symptom severity (p = .024), unadjusted (HR = 1.29, 95% CI: 0.69–2.43, p = .428) and adjusted (HR = 1.18, 95% CI: 0.61–2.29, p = .616) Cox proportional hazards models indicated that the risk of incident diabetes did not differ between the treatment groups. Our novel preliminary findings raise the possibility that depression treatment alone may be insufficient to reduce the excess diabetes risk of depressed, older adults."
https://openalex.org/W2888525007,"Hybrid crops produce higher yields than their inbred parents due to heterosis. For high purity of hybrid seeds, it is critical to eliminate self-pollination. Manual or mechanical removal of male parts (such as detasseling in maize) is labor-intensive, fuel and time-consuming, and can cause physical damage to female plants, resulting in significant seed yield reductions. Many male-sterility systems either require a maintainer for male-sterile line propagation or are often affected by environmental factors. Roundup® Hybridization System (RHS) utilizes glyphosate to induce male sterility, which effectively eliminates the need for maintainer lines and removal of male parts for commercial hybrid seed production. The first-generation RHS (RHS1) is based on low expression of a glyphosate-insensitive 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (CP4 EPSPS) in pollen. This report presents the second-generation RHS (RHS2) technology built on RNA interference (RNAi) combined with CP4 EPSPS. It utilizes maize endogenous male tissue-specific small interfering RNAs (mts-siRNAs) to trigger cleavage of the CP4 EPSPS mRNA specifically in tassels, resulting in glyphosate-sensitive male cells due to lack of the CP4 EPSPS protein. Male sterility is then induced by glyphosate application at the stages critical for pollen development, and the male-sterile plants are used as the female parent to produce hybrid seed. The endogenous mts-siRNAs are conserved across maize germplasms, and the inducible male sterility was replicated in representative germplasms through introgression of a CP4 EPSPS transgene containing the mts-siRNA target sequence. This technology combines the relative simplicity and convenience of a systemic herbicide spray methodology with targeted protein expression to create an inducible male sterility system for industrial production of row crop hybrid seeds in an environmentally-independent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2977358314,"Breast cancer (BC) screening has been developed to detect earlier stage tumors associated with better prognosis. The aim of study was to evaluate the impact of BC screening on therapeutic management of patients with first operable BC, and on costs, patients’ needs, and working life. OPTISOINS01 was a multicenter, prospective observational study which aimed to identify the main care pathway of early BC. Among patients aged from 50 to 74 years-old, 2 groups were defined: the “Clinical signs” group and the ""Screening"" group (national organized screening and individual screening). We compared between these 2 groups: locoregional and systemic treatments, direct medical and non-medical costs from a National Health Insurance perspective, patients’ needs assessed by the validated SCNS-BR8 “breast cancer” module of the SCNS-SF34 supportive care needs survey and the duration of sick leave. The “Clinical signs” group included 89 patients, while the”Screening” group included 290 patients. More axillary lymph node dissections and radical breast surgery were performed in the “Clinical signs”. The rate of adjuvant chemotherapy was dramatically higher in the “Clinical signs” group. The median direct medical costs of the “Screening” group were €11,860 (€3,643-€41,030) per year and per patient, much lower than in the “Clinical signs” group (€14,940; €5,317-€41,070). Finally, needs specifically assessed by the SCNS-BR8 questionnaire were significantly higher for the postoperative and post-adjuvant periods in the “Clinical signs” group. This study highlighted the benefit of BC screening in terms of reduced therapies and positive impact on work and social life."
https://openalex.org/W2888365383,"Background and aim Hepatic decompensation is a severe on-treatment adverse event for chronic hepatitis C treated with paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir and dasabuvir (PrOD). Till now, few papers regarding on-treatment hepatic decompensation have been reported. The study aims to analyze the general feature and predictive factors of on-treatment hepatic decompensation in hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1b-infected patients with advanced fibrosis and compensated cirrhosis who receive treatment with PrOD. Methods A real-word cohort enrolled 189 HCV genotype 1b patients with advanced fibrosis and compensated cirrhosis treated with 12-week PrOD. Clinical and laboratory data were analyzed between patients with and without on-treatment hepatic decompensation. Results The sustained virologic response rate at 12 weeks after treatment was 97.3% in HCV subtype 1b patients with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. On-treatment hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin >2 mg/dL) occurred in 27 (14.3%) patients, and the incidence of the increase of total and direct form bilirubin was significantly different during treatment between patients with Child-Turcotte-Pugh score 5 and score 6. Five (18.5%) hyperbilirubinemia patients progressed to hepatic decompensation. Older age (adjusted OR: 1.2, 95% CI: 1.0–1.4) and albumin ≤3.6 g/dL (adjusted OR: 10.4, 95% CI: 1.3–81.2) may be two predictors for on-treatment hepatic decompensation by multivariate analysis. Conclusions PrOD is an effective direct-acting antiviral agent for antiviral therapy in HCV genotype 1b patients with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. Hyperbilirubinemia is possibly the early warning feature of on-treatment hepatic decompensation. This serious adverse event of on-treatment hepatic decompensation is not common. Older age and low baseline albumin level may be predictive factors."
https://openalex.org/W2888377785,"DNA sequence elements in the core promoter can play a central role in regulation of gene expression. Core elements (e.g. INR and TATA box) are located within ~50bp of the transcription start site and both upstream and downstream elements are known. Although all can affect the level of gene expression, their mechanism of action has yet to be fully defined. The studies described here are focused on two core promoter elements, INR and BRE, in the human genome. The locations of the two elements were determined in a large number of human promoters and the results were interpreted in terms of overall promoter function.A total of 13,406 promoters were collected from the reference version of the human genome and found to contain 62,891 INR sequences and 32,290 BRE. An INR sequence was found in the core region of 1231 (9.2%) promoters and a BRE in 2592 (19.3%); 121 promoters (0.9%) have both INR and BRE elements. Counts support the view that most human promoters lack an INR or BRE element in the core promoter. Further analysis was carried out with the aligned aggregate of promoters from each chromosome. The results showed distinct INR distributions in separate chromosome groups indicating a degree of chromosome specificity to the way core promoter elements are deployed in the genome. The rare promoters with both INR and BRE elements were found to be enriched among the genes with divergent transcription. Enrichment raises the possibility that core promoter elements can have a function in chromosome organization as well as in initiation of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2888467545,"Decisions about the choice of a mate can greatly impact both individual fitness and selection processes. We developed a novel agent-based model to investigate two common mate choice rules that may be used by female gray treefrogs (Hyla versicolor). In this model environment, female agents using the minimum-threshold strategy found higher quality mates and traveled shorter distances on average, compared with female agents using the best-of-n strategy. Females using the minimum-threshold strategy, however, incur significant lost opportunity costs, depending on the male population quality average. The best-of-n strategy leads to significant female:female competition that limits their ability to find high quality mates. Thus, when the sex ratio is 0.8, best-of-5 and best-of-2 strategies yield mates of nearly identical quality. Although the distance traveled by females in the mating task varied depending on male spatial distribution in the environment, this did not interact with female choice for the best-of-n or minimum-threshold strategies. By incorporating empirical data from the frogs in this temporally- and spatially-explicit model, we thus show the emergence of novel interactions of common decision-making rules with realistic environmental variables."
