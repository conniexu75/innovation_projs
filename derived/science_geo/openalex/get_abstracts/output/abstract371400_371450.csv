https://openalex.org/W2059099579,"DNA cytosine methylation is a central epigenetic modification that has essential roles in cellular processes including genome regulation, development and disease. Here we present the first genome-wide, single-base-resolution maps of methylated cytosines in a mammalian genome, from both human embryonic stem cells and fetal fibroblasts, along with comparative analysis of messenger RNA and small RNA components of the transcriptome, several histone modifications, and sites of DNA–protein interaction for several key regulatory factors. Widespread differences were identified in the composition and patterning of cytosine methylation between the two genomes. Nearly one-quarter of all methylation identified in embryonic stem cells was in a non-CG context, suggesting that embryonic stem cells may use different methylation mechanisms to affect gene regulation. Methylation in non-CG contexts showed enrichment in gene bodies and depletion in protein binding sites and enhancers. Non-CG methylation disappeared upon induced differentiation of the embryonic stem cells, and was restored in induced pluripotent stem cells. We identified hundreds of differentially methylated regions proximal to genes involved in pluripotency and differentiation, and widespread reduced methylation levels in fibroblasts associated with lower transcriptional activity. These reference epigenomes provide a foundation for future studies exploring this key epigenetic modification in human disease and development. The 'fifth base' of DNA, methylated cytosine, is an epigenetic modification that makes up a small fraction of the mammalian genome yet has important roles in regulating cellular processes such as gene expression and development. The first genome-wide, single-base resolution maps or 'methylomes' of methylated cytosines in a mammalian genome — from human embryonic stem cells and fetal fibroblasts — are now published, together with analyses of the transcriptome, histone modifications, and sites of DNA–protein interaction for several regulatory factors. The results reveal key differences in methylation patterns between the two cell types, suggesting potentially different gene regulation mechanisms in pluripotency and differentiation.

https://openalex.org/W2148699021,"The fractional quantum Hall effect is a quintessential manifestation of the collective behaviour associated with strongly interacting charge carriers confined to two dimensions and subject to a strong magnetic field. It is predicted that the charge carriers present in graphene — an atomic layer of carbon that can be seen as the 'perfect' two-dimensional system — are subject to strong interactions. Nevertheless, the phenomenon had eluded experimental observation until now: in this issue two groups report fractional quantum Hall effect in suspended sheets of graphene, probed in a two-terminal measurement setup. The researchers also observe a magnetic-field-induced insulating state at low carrier density, which competes with the quantum Hall effect and limits its observation to the highest-quality samples only. These results pave the way for the study of the rich collective behaviour of Dirac fermions in graphene. The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) is the quintessential collective quantum behaviour of charge carriers confined to two dimensions but it has not yet been observed in graphene, a material distinguished by the charge carriers' two-dimensional and relativistic character. Here, and in an accompanying paper, the FQHE is observed in graphene through the use of devices containing suspended graphene sheets; the results of these two papers open a door to the further elucidation of the complex physical properties of graphene. In graphene, which is an atomic layer of crystalline carbon, two of the distinguishing properties of the material are the charge carriers’ two-dimensional and relativistic character. The first experimental evidence of the two-dimensional nature of graphene came from the observation of a sequence of plateaus in measurements of its transport properties in the presence of an applied magnetic field1,2. These are signatures of the so-called integer quantum Hall effect. However, as a consequence of the relativistic character of the charge carriers, the integer quantum Hall effect observed in graphene is qualitatively different from its semiconductor analogue3. As a third distinguishing feature of graphene, it has been conjectured that interactions and correlations should be important in this material, but surprisingly, evidence of collective behaviour in graphene is lacking. In particular, the quintessential collective quantum behaviour in two dimensions, the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE), has so far resisted observation in graphene despite intense efforts and theoretical predictions of its existence4,5,6,7,8,9. Here we report the observation of the FQHE in graphene. Our observations are made possible by using suspended graphene devices probed by two-terminal charge transport measurements10. This allows us to isolate the sample from substrate-induced perturbations that usually obscure the effects of interactions in this system and to avoid effects of finite geometry. At low carrier density, we find a field-induced transition to an insulator that competes with the FQHE, allowing its observation only in the highest quality samples. We believe that these results will open the door to the physics of FQHE and other collective behaviour in graphene."

https://openalex.org/W2100122781,"Mammographically dense breast tissue is one of the greatest risk factors for developing breast carcinoma, yet the associated molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Importantly, regions of high breast density are associated with increased stromal collagen and epithelial cell content. We set out to determine whether increased collagen-matrix density, in the absence of stromal cells, was sufficient to promote proliferation and invasion characteristic of a malignant phenotype in non-transformed mammary epithelial cells. We demonstrate that increased collagen-matrix density increases matrix stiffness to promote an invasive phenotype. High matrix stiffness resulted in increased formation of activated three-dimensional (3D)-matrix adhesions and a chronically elevated outside-in/inside-out focal adhesion (FA) kinase (FAK)–Rho signaling loop, which was necessary to generate and maintain the invasive phenotype. Moreover, this signaling network resulted in hyperactivation of the Ras–mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which promoted growth of mammary epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo and activated a clinically relevant proliferation signature that predicts patient outcome. Hence, the current data provide compelling evidence for the importance of the mechanical features of the microenvironment, and suggest that mechanotransduction in these cells occurs through a FAK–Rho–ERK signaling network with extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) as a bottleneck through which much of the response to mechanical stimuli is regulated. As such, we propose that increased matrix stiffness explains part of the mechanism behind increased epithelial proliferation and cancer risk in human patients with high breast tissue density."

https://openalex.org/W2147978858,"Community Acquired Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) causes severe necrotizing infections of the skin, soft tissues, and lungs. Staphylococcal α-hemolysin is an essential virulence factor in mouse models of CA-MRSA necrotizing pneumonia. S. aureus α-hemolysin has long been known to induce inflammatory signaling and cell death in host organisms, however the mechanism underlying these signaling events were not well understood. Using highly purified recombinant α-hemolysin, we now demonstrate that α-hemolysin activates the Nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing gene family, pyrin domain containing 3 protein (NLRP3)-inflammasome, a host inflammatory signaling complex involved in responses to pathogens and endogenous danger signals. Non-cytolytic mutant α-hemolysin molecules fail to elicit NLRP3-inflammasome signaling, demonstrating that the responses are not due to non-specific activation of this innate immune signaling system by bacterially derived proteins. In monocyte-derived cells from humans and mice, inflammasome assembly in response to α-hemolysin results in activation of the cysteine proteinase, caspase-1. We also show that inflammasome activation by α-hemolysin works in conjunction with signaling by other CA-MRSA-derived Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs) to induce secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. Additionally, α-hemolysin induces cell death in these cells through an NLRP3-dependent program of cellular necrosis, resulting in the release of endogenous pro-inflammatory molecules, like the chromatin-associated protein, High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). These studies link the activity of a major S. aureus virulence factor to a specific host signaling pathway. The cellular events linked to inflammasome activity have clear relevance to the disease processes associated with CA-MRSA including tissue necrosis and inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2054791783,"miR-210 is a key player of cell response to hypoxia, modulating cell survival, VEGF-driven endothelial cell migration, and the ability of endothelial cells to form capillary-like structures. A crucial step in understanding microRNA (miRNA) function is the identification of their targets. However, only few miR-210 targets have been identified to date. Here, we describe an integrated strategy for large-scale identification of new miR-210 targets by combining transcriptomics and proteomics with bioinformatic approaches. To experimentally validate candidate targets, the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) loaded with miR-210 was purified by immunoprecipitation along with its mRNA targets. The complex was significantly enriched in mRNAs of 31 candidate targets, such as BDNF, GPD1L, ISCU, NCAM, and the non-coding RNA Xist. A subset of the newly identified targets was further confirmed by 3′-untranslated region (UTR) reporter assays, and hypoxia induced down-modulation of their expression was rescued blocking miR-210, providing support for the approach validity. In the case of 9 targets, such as PTPN1 and P4HB, miR-210 seed-pairing sequences localized in the coding sequence or in the 5′-UTR, in line with recent data extending miRNA targeting beyond the “classic” 3′-UTR recognition. Finally, Gene Ontology analysis of the targets highlights known miR-210 impact on cell cycle regulation and differentiation, and predicts a new role of this miRNA in RNA processing, DNA binding, development, membrane trafficking, and amino acid catabolism. Given the complexity of miRNA actions, we view such a multiprong approach as useful to adequately describe the multiple pathways regulated by miR-210 during physiopathological processes. miR-210 is a key player of cell response to hypoxia, modulating cell survival, VEGF-driven endothelial cell migration, and the ability of endothelial cells to form capillary-like structures.

IntroductionmiRNAs are 21–23-nucleotide non-protein coding RNA molecules that regulate the stability and/or the translational efficiency of target messenger RNAs (1.Bartel D.P.

Mature miRNAs are loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) 3The abbreviations used are: RISCRNA-induced silencing complexmiRNAmicroRNAECendothelial cellGOgene ontologyHUVEChuman umbilical vein endothelial cellsLNAlocked nucleic acidUTRuntranslated region. and mediate the translational inhibition of target mRNA, albeit a few opposing examples have been described as well (4.Vasudevan S.

The rules that guide miRNA-mRNA interaction are very complex and still under investigation. However, the current paradigm states that a Watson-Crick pairing between the mRNA and the 5′-region of the miRNA centered on nucleotides 2–7, termed “seed sequence,” is required for miRNA-mediated inhibition (7.Bartel D.P. Cell. 2009; 136: 215-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15587) Google Scholar). RISC-miRNA complexes can move the mRNAs they bind to the P-bodies, which are specialized cytoplasmic compartments where translational repression and mRNA turnover is thought to occur (8.Parker R. Sheth U. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). Because P-bodies contain many enzymes involved in mRNA exonucleolitic degradation, miRNAs may also have a secondary quantitative inhibitory effect on mRNAs. A role for miRNAs in mRNA destabilization is also suggested by studies reporting robust correlations between the levels of miRNAs and the message of multiple predicted or validated targets (9.Esau C. Davis S. Murray S.F. Yu X.X. Pandey S.K. Pear M. Watts L. Booten S.L. Graham M. McKay R. Subramaniam A. Propp S. Lollo B.A. Freier S. Bennett C.F. Bhanot S. Monia B.P.

Nature. 2005; 433: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (3952) Google Scholar).miR-210 is currently regarded as “master miRNA” of hypoxic response, because it was found up-regulated by hypoxia in all the cell types tested to date (12.Ivan M. Harris A.L. Martelli F. Kulshreshtha R. J. Cell Mol. Med. 2008; 12: 1426-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Previously, we characterized miR-210 regulation and its functional relevance in endothelial cell (EC) response to hypoxia (13.Fasanaro P. D'Alessandra Y. Di Stefano V. Melchionna R. Romani S. Pompilio G. Capogrossi M.C. Martelli F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15878-15883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). We found that miR-210 increases EC tubulogenesis and migration, whereas miR-210 blockade in the presence of hypoxia inhibits these processes and induces apoptosis. These effects are mediated, at least in part, by the direct inhibition of the receptor-tyrosine kinase ligand Ephrin-A3 (EFNA3). Furthermore, other miR-210 targets have been recently identified: E2F3, NPTX1, RAD52, ACVR1B, MNT, CASP8AP2, FGFRL1, and HOXA-1 and -9 (14.Giannakakis A. Sandaltzopoulos R. Greshock J. Liang S.

Cell. 2009; 35: 856-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), suggesting multiple roles of this miRNA in the cellular adaptation to low oxygen. Considering that the function of each miRNA is mediated by the modulation of a subset-specific mRNA targets and that each miRNA is thought to regulate hundreds of mRNAs (21.Zhdanov V.P. Mol. Biosyst. 2009; 5: 638-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the identification of new miR-210 targets represents an important step in elucidating its function. Several tools for predicting miRNA targets have been developed. However, the overlap between their output is rather limited (7.Bartel D.P. Cell. 2009; 136: 215-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15587) Google Scholar), raising the distinct possibility of false positive predictions. On the other hand, genuine targets could be excluded by a cut-off that depends on base pairing type, as well as by conservation or 3′-UTR localization requirements. Indeed, many reports have recently demonstrated that certain miRNAs can inhibit mRNAs subsequent to targeting of their coding regions or of the 5′-UTR (5.Ørom U.A. Nielsen F.C. Lund A.H. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 460-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar, 6.Tsai N.P. Lin Y.L. Wei L.N. Biochem. J. 2009; (in press)Google Scholar, 22.Rigoutsos I.

To overcome these limitations of bioinformatic predictions, several biochemical approaches for target identification have been developed (25.Karginov F.V. Conaco C. Xuan Z. Schmidt B.H. Parker J.S. Mandel G. Hannon G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 19291-19296Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 26.Hendrickson D.G. Hogan D.J. Herschlag D. Ferrell J.E. Brown P.O.

Nature. 2009; 460: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar).In this study, candidate miR-210 targets have been selected using a combination of bioinformatic, proteomic, and transcriptomic approaches, using ECs with manipulated levels of miR-210. These potential targets were validated based on their association to RISC complexes enriched for miR-210, leading to the identification of a panel of novel targets.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we took a molecular approach encompassing proteomics, transcriptomics, bioinformatics, and biochemistry to investigate miR-210 function. Specifically, we studied how perturbations of miR-210 levels or activity influenced gene expression, both directly and indirectly, affecting specific molecular pathways and cellular functions. Furthermore, we identified, among the modulated genes, 31 new direct miR-210 targets, allowing to better delineate the molecular pathways underpinning miR-210 action.Our approach to study gene expression modulation by miR-210 was 2-fold, proteomic and transcriptomic. Whereas proteomics is the technique of choice to analyze post-transcriptional regulation, it is also limited by its low sensitivity. Thus, we also measured gene expression modifications induced by both miR-210 overexpression and blockade. Transcriptomic experiments are highly sensitive; however, often yield extensive lists of modulated genes, and it is challenging to evaluate the directly affected genes, or the genes of relevance for a given process. To address this issue, we limited our analysis to those genes that exhibited inverse patterns when miR-210 was overexpressed or down-regulated. A similar approach was recently used to study miR-140 function and targets (33.Nicolas F.E. Pais H. Schwach F. Lindow M. Kauppinen S. Moulton V. Dalmay T. Rna. 2008; 14: 2513-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and to demonstrate that miR-210 modulates the c-Myc antagonist MNT (18.Zhang Z. Sun H. Dai H. Walsh R.M. Imakura M. Schelter J.

Of note, one of the most enriched GO classes, “heart development,” was consistent with miR-210 up-regulation observed in cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure (36.van Rooij E. Sutherland L.B. Liu N.

Furthermore, in keeping with HIF1α-dependent regulation of miR-210 in hypoxic conditions (12.Ivan M. Harris A.L. Martelli F. Kulshreshtha R. J. Cell Mol. Med. 2008; 12: 1426-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), the HIF1α pathway was found as the most enriched miR-210-modulated pathway, suggesting a potential bi-directional relationship between miR-210 and the HIF pathway. Other enriched pathways, such as ATM, FAS, and TNFR1, correlated with the anti-apoptotic role of miR-210 (13.Fasanaro P. D'Alessandra Y. Di Stefano V. Melchionna R. Romani S. Pompilio G.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 1290-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). Likewise, integrin and agrin pathway modulations may be instrumental for miR-210-dependent regulation of EC migration and in vitro differentiation previously described by our group (13.Fasanaro P. D'Alessandra Y. Di Stefano V. Melchionna R. Romani S. Pompilio G. Capogrossi M.C. Martelli F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15878-15883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar).Potential miR-210 direct targets were then assessed for direct association with miR-210 within RISC complexes. To this end, we immunoprecipitated RISC complexes enriched for miR-210 targets. Our analysis included candidate genes, identified both by proteomics and transcriptomics, containing miR-210 seed-pairing sequences. Moreover, given the reported specificity of Pictar and Targetscan (26.Hendrickson D.G. Hogan D.J. Herschlag D. Ferrell J.E. Brown P.O. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), predicted targets identified by these algorithm were assayed as well. One important aspect of the adopted assay is that, despite of miR-210 overexpression, non-targets were not squelched out of the RISC complex. Furthermore, it was previously demonstrated that the overexpression of the RISC component Ago2 in HEK-293 cells does not substantially alter the global gene expression program (26.Hendrickson D.G. Hogan D.J. Herschlag D. Ferrell J.E. Brown P.O. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the immunoprecipitation of non-crosslinked RNA-protein complexes, including Ago-miRNAs, may co-purify mRNAs that are not specific targets (39.Mili S. Steitz J.A. Rna. 2004; 10: 1692-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 40.Kirino Y. Mourelatos Z. Rna. 2008; 14: 2254-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To minimize this potential artifact source, miR-210-containing RISC complexes were compared with RISC complexes derived from cells transfected with a scramble sequence: Thus, most artifactual targets were presumably excluded by the background subtraction. Results show that 31 of 76 tested genes were targeted by miR-210 directly. However, we cannot exclude that, among non-enriched genes, bona fide miR-210 targets exist. Indeed, our approach was not intended to provide a comprehensive compilation of miR-210 targets, but it was aimed at the identification of a sizable number of targets, allowing to highlight certain nodal elements of the molecular pathways underpinning miR-210 function.To this aim, very stringent selection parameters were adopted to minimize the number of false positives. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the transcriptomic and the proteomic experiments were performed in HUVEC cells, whereas the IP-RISC experiments were, for technical reasons, performed in the highly transfectable HEK-293 cells. Whereas tested genes were expressed in both cell types, one should consider that alternative splicing and polyadenylation may eliminate miRNA target sites, as demonstrated for highly proliferating cells that express shortened 3′-UTRs (7.Bartel D.P.

Indeed, miR-210 was necessary for the down-modulation of the identified targets in hypoxic HUVEC.The validity of the RISC immunoprecipitation approach was also confirmed by a recent study that identified a number of miR-210 targets with an experimental approach similar to the one we adopted (20.Huang X.

It is worth noting that the targets identified by Huang et al. display very little overlap with the ones we demonstrated. Indeed, relevant differences in the experimental procedures and in the cell system are present, and none of the studies is saturating, leaving avenues to further investigations in the field.In our low-stringency research of miR-210 seed-pairing among the differentially expressed genes identified by transcriptomics and proteomics, we kept limitations to a minimum. Thus, our search was not confined to the gene 3′-UTR, but included the coding sequence and the 5′-UTR, both recently demonstrated as involved in miRNA-mRNA binding (5.Ørom U.A. Nielsen F.C. Lund A.H. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 460-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar, 6.Tsai N.P. Lin Y.L. Wei L.N. Biochem. J. 2009; (in press)Google Scholar, 22.Rigoutsos I.

Zang J.B. Mele A. Darnell R.B. Nature. 2009; 460: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). It was found that miR-210 seed-pairing sequences were more frequent among the putative targets compared with controls. Furthermore, we did not impose any conservation bias. Indeed, whereas many miRNAs are evolutionarily conserved, others are species-specific, including human miRNAs not conserved in chimpanzee (43.Berezikov E. Thuemmler F. van Laake L.W. Kondova I. Bontrop R. Cuppen E. Plasterk R.H. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 1375-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), consistent with miRNA roles ranging from generating cellular to organismal diversity. Thus, it is not surprising that a certain gene may be targeted by miR-210 in humans but not in other vertebrates.Fig. 5 summarizes the identified cellular processes affected by miR-210, both directly and indirectly, and how some of the new validated targets could be involved in the direct regulation of these events. CLASP2, MDGA1, NCAM1, and P4HB are involved in cellular migration and adhesion and could, at least in part, mediate miR-210 regulation of tubulogenesis and migration observed in hypoxic ECs (13.Fasanaro P. D'Alessandra Y. Di Stefano V. Melchionna R. Romani S. Pompilio G. Capogrossi M.C. Martelli F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15878-15883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that, following hindlimb ischemia, PTPN1 negatively regulates VEGFR2 and modulates cell-cell adhesions (44.Nakamura Y. Patrushev N. Inomata H. Mehta D. Urao N. Kim H.W. Razvi M. Kini V. Mahadev K. Goldstein B.J. McKinney R. Fukai T. Ushio-Fukai M. Circ. Res. 2008; 102: 1182-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Moreover, in keeping with our findings, previous studies found that CPEB2 and the ternary complex factor ELK-3 proteins are modulated by hypoxia (45.Hägele S. Kühn U. Böning M. Katschinski D.M. Biochem. J. 2009; 417: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 46.Gross C. Dubois-Pot H. Wasylyk B. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 1333-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Many identified targets, such as the tumor suppressor APC, ACVR1B, CDK10, SERTAD2, as much the previously identified E2F3 and MNT (14.Giannakakis A. Sandaltzopoulos R. Greshock J. Liang S. Huang J.

Cell Cycle. 2009; 8: 2756-2768Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), are involved in cell cycle regulation. These results are in keeping with miR-210 overexpression observed in breast cancer, where miR-210 levels correlate with aggressiveness of lymph node-negative, estrogen receptor-positive human breast cancer (18.Zhang Z. Sun H. Dai H. Walsh R.M. Imakura M. Schelter J. Burchard J. Dai X. Chang A.N. Diaz R.L. Marszalek J.R. Bartz S.R. Carleton M. Cleary M.A. Linsley P.S. Grandori C.

Garrone O. Gasco M. Tutt A.N. Crook T. Lord C.J. Ashworth A. Cancer Cell. 2008; 13: 91-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for miR-210 in this regulation. Furthermore, miR-210 is overexpressed in many other solid cancer types (50.Volinia S. Calin G.A. Liu C.G. Ambs S. Cimmino A. Petrocca F. Visone R. Iorio M. Roldo C. Ferracin M. Prueitt R.L. Yanaihara N. Lanza G. Scarpa A. Vecchione A. Negrini M. Harris C.C. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 2257-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (4896) Google Scholar), it was detected in serum of patients affected by diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (51.Lawrie C.H. Gal S. Dunlop H.M. Pushkaran B. Liggins A.P. Pulford K. Banham A.H. Pezzella F. Boultwood J. Wainscoat J.S. Hatton C.S. Harris A.L. Br. J. Haematol. 2008; 141: 672-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar) and by breast, colon, lung, and ovarian cancer (52.Lodes M.J. Caraballo M. Suciu D. Munro S. Kumar A. Anderson B. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e6229Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). It was also found that elevated expression of miR-210 in melanoma and in pancreatic tumors associates with poorer survival (18.Zhang Z. Sun H. Dai H. Walsh R.M. Imakura M. Schelter J. Burchard J. Dai X. Chang A.N. Diaz R.L. Marszalek J.R. Bartz S.R. Carleton M. Cleary M.A. Linsley P.S. Grandori C. Cell Cycle. 2009; 8: 2756-2768Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 53.Greither T. Grochola L. Udelnow A. Lautenschlager C. Wurl P. Taubert H. Int. J. Cancer. 2009; (in press)Google Scholar). Another novel target is GPD1L, a gene recently linked to sudden infant cardiac death and the Brugada syndrome, a disease that induces syncope, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden death (54.Benito B.

Circulation. 2007; 116: 2253-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Interestingly, acute myocardial ischemia involving the right-ventricular outflow tract is known to induce Brugada-like electrophysiological and electrocardiogram alterations (57.Omichi C. Fujimoto N. Kawasaki A. Kasai A. Int. J. Cardiol. 2009; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 58.Di Diego J.M. Fish J.M. Antzelevitch C. J.

Whereas miR-210 and GPD1L levels were not measured in these pathological conditions, it is worth noting that hypoxia is both a crucial component of ischemia and a potent miR-210 inducer (12.Ivan M. Harris A.L. Martelli F. Kulshreshtha R. J. Cell Mol. Med. 2008; 12: 1426-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To the best of our knowledge, to date a single report shows that miRNAs could target non-coding RNAs (27.Chi S.W. Zang J.B. Mele A. Darnell R.B. Nature. 2009; 460: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). Thus, an unexpected target is Xist (60.Ng K. Pullirsch D. Leeb M. Wutz A. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), a long non-protein coding RNA involved in mammalian X-chromosome inactivation during early female embryogenesis. Although Xist is confined in the nucleus, recent data demonstrate that miRNAs can be imported to the nucleus (61.Hwang H.W. Wentzel E.A. Mendell J.T. Science. 2007; 315: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). In keeping with our data, Xist is down-modulated by ischemia (62.Yoshida T. Kurella M. Beato F. Min H. Ingelfinger J.R. Stears R.L. Swinford R.D. Gullans S.R. Tang S.S. Kidney Int. 2002; 61: 1646-1654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and recently was demonstrated an inappropriate Xist expression/localization on active X-chromosome in breast cancer (63.Sirchia S.M. Tabano S. Monti L. Recalcati M.P. Gariboldi M. Grati F.R. Porta G. Finelli P. Radice P. Miozzo M. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e5559Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Given high miR-210 levels observed in breast cancer (47.Foekens J.A. Sieuwerts A.M. Smid M. Look M.P. de Weerd V. Boersma A.W. Klijn J.G. Wiemer E.A. Martens J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 13021-13026Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 48.Camps C. Buffa F.M. Colella S. Moore J. Sotiriou C. Sheldon H. Harris A.L. Gleadle J.M. Ragoussis J. Clin. Cancer Res. 2008; 14: 1340-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar), one can hypothesize that miR-210 may play a role in this deregulation. Furthermore, another identified miR-210 target, SMCHD1, localizes to the inactive X-chromosome specifically, and has a role in the maintenance of its inactivation (64.Blewitt M.E. Gendrel A.V. Pang Z. Sparrow D.B. Whitelaw N. Craig J.M. Apedaile A. Hilton D.J. Dunwoodie S.L. Brockdorff N. Kay G.F. Whitelaw E. Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Another interesting finding is that the miR-210 seed-pairing sequence of Xist in position 6197–6202 represents the 3′-end of a perfect palindrome within Xist (see supplemental Fig. SF2 for details), suggesting several possible speculations: miR-210 access to Xist palindrome sequence could be modulated in different physiological situations and, in turn, Xist could be regulated by both miR-210 and miR-210* (the complementary mature strand). Moreover, miR-210 may also regulate Tsix, the Xist antisense partner that blocks X-chromosome silencing (60.Ng K. Pullirsch D. Leeb M. Wutz A. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Further studies to functionally evaluate miR-210/Xist interaction are ongoing.We can conclude that this study establishes a new frame for further studies determining the relevance of each of the newly identified or predicted molecular pathways in mediating miR-210-dependent response to hypoxia. Our integrative approach may also serve as a model that can be applied for the functional dissection of additional miRNAs. IntroductionmiRNAs are 21–23-nucleotide non-protein coding RNA molecules that regulate the stability and/or the translational efficiency of target messenger RNAs (1.Bartel D.P. Cell. 2004; 116: 281-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29004) Google Scholar, 2.Kim V.N. Han J. Siomi M.C. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Genet. 2008; 9: 102-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (4103) Google Scholar). Mature miRNAs are loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) 3The abbreviations used are: RISCRNA-induced silencing complexmiRNAmicroRNAECendothelial cellGOgene ontologyHUVEChuman umbilical vein endothelial cellsLNAlocked nucleic acidUTRuntranslated region. and mediate the translational inhibition of target mRNA, albeit a few opposing examples have been described as well (4.Vasudevan S. Tong Y. Steitz J.A. Science. 2007; 318: 1931-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (2153) Google Scholar, 5.Ørom U.A. Nielsen F.C. Lund A.H. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 460-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar, 6.Tsai N.P. Lin Y.L. Wei L.N. Biochem. J. 2009; (in press)Google Scholar). The rules that guide miRNA-mRNA interaction are very complex and still under investigation. However, the current paradigm states that a Watson-Crick pairing between the mRNA and the 5′-region of the miRNA centered on nucleotides 2–7, termed “seed sequence,” is required for miRNA-mediated inhibition (7.Bartel D.P. Cell. 2009; 136: 215-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15587) Google Scholar). RISC-miRNA complexes can move the mRNAs they bind to the P-bodies, which are specialized cytoplasmic compartments where translational repression and mRNA turnover is thought to occur (8.Parker R. Sheth U. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). Because P-bodies contain many enzymes involved in mRNA exonucleolitic degradation, miRNAs may also have a secondary quantitative inhibitory effect on mRNAs. A role for miRNAs in mRNA destabilization is also suggested by studies reporting robust correlations between the levels of miRNAs and the message of multiple predicted or validated targets (9.Esau C. Davis S. Murray S.F. Yu X.X. Pandey S.K. Pear M. Watts L. Booten S.L. Graham M. McKay R. Subramaniam A. Propp S. Lollo B.A. Freier S. Bennett C.F. Bhanot S. Monia B.P.

Nature. 2005; 433: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (3952) Google Scholar).miR-210 is currently regarded as “master miRNA” of hypoxic response, because it was found up-regulated by hypoxia in all the cell types tested to date (12.Ivan M. Harris A.L. Martelli F. Kulshreshtha R. J. Cell Mol. Med. 2008; 12: 1426-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Previously, we characterized miR-210 regulation and its functional relevance in endothelial cell (EC) response to hypoxia (13.Fasanaro P. D'Alessandra Y. Di Stefano V. Melchionna R. Romani S. Pompilio G. Capogrossi M.C. Martelli F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15878-15883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). We found that miR-210 increases EC tubulogenesis and migration, whereas miR-210 blockade in the presence of hypoxia inhibits these processes and induces apoptosis. These effects are mediated, at least in part, by the direct inhibition of the receptor-tyrosine kinase ligand Ephrin-A3 (EFNA3). Furthermore, other miR-210 targets have been recently identified: E2F3, NPTX1, RAD52, ACVR1B, MNT, CASP8AP2, FGFRL1, and HOXA-1 and -9 (14.Giannakakis A. Sandaltzopoulos R. Greshock J. Liang S.

Cell. 2009; 35: 856-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), suggesting multiple roles of this miRNA in the cellular adaptation to low oxygen. Considering that the function of each miRNA is mediated by the modulation of a subset-specific mRNA targets and that each miRNA is thought to regulate hundreds of mRNAs (21.Zhdanov V.P. Mol. Biosyst. 2009; 5: 638-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the identification of new miR-210 targets represents an important step in elucidating its function. Several tools for predicting miRNA targets have been developed. However, the overlap between their output is rather limited (7.Bartel D.P. Cell. 2009; 136: 215-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15587) Google Scholar), raising the distinct possibility of false positive predictions. On the other hand, genuine targets could be excluded by a cut-off that depends on base pairing type, as well as by conservation or 3′-UTR localization requirements. Indeed, many reports have recently demonstrated that certain miRNAs can inhibit mRNAs subsequent to targeting of their coding regions or of the 5′-UTR (5.Ørom U.A. Nielsen F.C. Lund A.H. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 460-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar, 6.Tsai N.P. Lin Y.L. Wei L.N. Biochem. J. 2009; (in press)Google Scholar, 22.Rigoutsos I.

To overcome these limitations of bioinformatic predictions, several biochemical approaches for target identification have been developed (25.Karginov F.V. Conaco C. Xuan Z. Schmidt B.H. Parker J.S.

Nature. 2009; 460: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar).In this study, candidate miR-210 targets have been selected using a combination of bioinformatic, proteomic, and transcriptomic approaches, using ECs with manipulated levels of miR-210. These potential targets were validated based on their association to RISC complexes enriched for miR-210, leading to the identification of a panel of novel targets."
https://openalex.org/W2128899239,"Activating mutations in one allele of an oncogene (heterozygous mutations) are widely believed to be sufficient for tumorigenesis. However, mutant allele specific imbalance (MASI) has been observed in tumors and cell lines harboring mutations of oncogenes.We determined 1) mutational status, 2) copy number gains (CNGs) and 3) relative ratio between mutant and wild type alleles of KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA and EGFR genes by direct sequencing and quantitative PCR assay in over 400 human tumors, cell lines, and xenografts of lung, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers. Examination of a public database indicated that homozygous mutations of five oncogenes were frequent (20%) in 833 cell lines of 12 tumor types. Our data indicated two major forms of MASI: 1) MASI with CNG, either complete or partial; and 2) MASI without CNG (uniparental disomy; UPD), due to complete loss of wild type allele. MASI was a frequent event in mutant EGFR (75%) and was due mainly to CNGs, while MASI, also frequent in mutant KRAS (58%), was mainly due to UPD. Mutant: wild type allelic ratios at the genomic level were precisely maintained after transcription. KRAS mutations or CNGs were significantly associated with increased ras GTPase activity, as measured by ELISA, and the two molecular changes were synergistic. Of 237 lung adenocarcinoma tumors, the small number with both KRAS mutation and CNG were associated with shortened survival.MASI is frequently present in mutant EGFR and KRAS tumor cells, and is associated with increased mutant allele transcription and gene activity. The frequent finding of mutations, CNGs and MASI occurring together in tumor cells indicates that these three genetic alterations, acting together, may have a greater role in the development or maintenance of the malignant phenotype than any individual alteration."
https://openalex.org/W2048214675,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) expressed on immune cells trigger inflammatory responses. TLRs are also expressed on ovarian cancer (OvCa) cells, but the consequences of signaling by the TLR4/MyD88 pathway in these cells are unclear. Here, TLR4 and MyD88 expression in OvCa tissues (n=20) and cell lines (OVCAR3, SKOV3, AD10, A2780 and CP70) was evaluated by reverse transcriptase–PCR, western blots and immunohistochemistry. Cell growth, apoptosis, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) translocation, IRAK4 and TRIF expression and cJun phosphorylation were measured following tumor cell exposure to the TLR4 ligands, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or paclitaxel (PTX). Culture supernatants were tested for cytokine levels. TLR4 was expressed in all tumors, tumor cell lines and normal epithelium. MyD88 was detectable in tumor tissues and in 3/5 OvCa lines but not in normal cells. In MyD88+ SCOV3 cells, LPS or PTX binding to TLR4 induced IRAK4 activation and cJun phosphorylation, activated the NF-κB pathway and promoted interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6, vascular endothelial growth factor and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 production and resistance to drug-induced apoptosis. Silencing of TLR4 in SCOV3 cells with small interference RNA resulted in phosphorylated-cJun (p-cJun) downregulation and a loss of PTX resistance. In PTX-sensitive, MyD88neg A2780 cells, TLR4 stimulation upregulated TRIF, and TLR4 silencing eliminated this effect. Thus, TLR4/MyD88 signaling supports OvCa progression and chemoresistance, promoting immune escape."
https://openalex.org/W2170160409,"Background The pathologies of numerous retinal degenerative diseases can be attributed to a multitude of genetic factors, and individualized treatment options for afflicted patients are limited and cost-inefficient. In light of the shared neurodegenerative phenotype among these disorders, a safe and broad-based neuroprotective approach would be desirable to overcome these obstacles. As a result, gene delivery of secretable-neuroprotective factors to Müller cells, a type of retinal glia that contacts all classes of retinal neurons, represents an ideal approach to mediate protection of the entire retina through a simple and innocuous intraocular, or intravitreal, injection of an efficient vehicle such as an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV). Although several naturally occurring AAV variants have been isolated with a variety of tropisms, or cellular specificities, these vectors inefficiently infect Müller cells via intravitreal injection. Methodology/Principal Findings We have previously applied directed evolution to create several novel AAV variants capable of efficient infection of both rat and human astrocytes through iterative selection of a panel of highly diverse AAV libraries. Here, in vivo and in vitro characterization of these isolated variants identifies a previously unreported AAV variant ShH10, closely related to AAV serotype 6 (AAV6), capable of efficient, selective Müller cell infection through intravitreal injection. Importantly, this new variant shows significantly improved transduction relative to AAV2 (>60%) and AAV6. Conclusions/Significance Our findings demonstrate that AAV is a highly versatile vector capable of powerful shifts in tropism from minor sequence changes. This isolated variant represents a new therapeutic vector to treat retinal degenerative diseases through secretion of neuroprotective factors from Müller cells as well as provides new opportunities to study their biological functions in the retina."
https://openalex.org/W2017906219,"Dominant missense mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are the most common known genetic cause of Parkinson disease. LRRK2 encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase, and pathogenic mutations may increase kinase activity. Intrinsic GTP binding in the GTPase domain may govern kinase activity through an internal signal transduction cascade. As with many protein kinases, LRRK2 self-interacts through mechanisms that may regulate enzymatic activity. We find that the disruption of either GTPase or kinase activity enhances the formation of high molecular weight oligomers and prevents the formation of LRRK2 dimer structures. In addition, brief application of the broad spectrum kinase inhibitor staurosporine ablates LRRK2 dimers and promotes LRRK2 high molecular weight oligomers. LRRK2 interactions with other proteins in cell lines are kinase-independent and include chaperones and cell cytoskeleton components, suggesting that LRRK2 self-assembly principally dictates complex size. To further explore the mechanics of kinase activation, we separate soluble LRRK2 protein that encodes the pathogenic G2019S mutation into high molecular weight oligomers, dimers, and monomers and find that kinase activity resides with dimeric LRRK2. Some PD-associated mutations that increase kinase activity in vitro significantly increase the proportion of dimer structures relative to total LRRK2 protein, providing additional insight into how pathogenic mutations may alter normal enzymatic regulation. Targeting and tracking LRRK2 dimerization may provide a clear way to observe LRRK2 kinase activity in living cells, and disruption of dimeric LRRK2 through kinase inhibition or other means may attenuate pathogenic increases in LRRK2 enzymatic output.

https://openalex.org/W2066419835,"A hallmark of a group of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease is the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, which are principally composed of bundles of filaments formed by microtubule-associated protein Tau. Clarifying how natively unstructured Tau protein forms abnormal aggregates is of central importance for elucidating the etiology of these diseases. There is considerable evidence showing that zinc, as an essential element that is highly concentrated in brain, is linked to the development or progression of these diseases. Herein, by using recombinant human Tau fragment Tau244–372 and its mutants, we have investigated the effect of zinc on the aggregation of Tau. Low micromolar concentrations of Zn2+ dramatically accelerate fibril formation of wild-type Tau244–372 under reducing conditions, compared with no Zn2+. Higher concentrations of Zn2+, however, induce wild-type Tau244–372 to form granular aggregates in reducing conditions. Moreover, these non-fibrillar aggregates assemble into mature Tau filaments when Zn2+ has been chelated by EDTA. Unlike wild-type Tau244–372, low micromolar concentrations of Zn2+ have no obvious effects on fibrillization kinetics of single mutants C291A and C322A and double mutant C291A/C322A under reducing conditions. The results from isothermal titration calorimetry show that one Zn2+ binds to one Tau molecule via tetrahedral coordination to Cys-291 and Cys-322 as well as two histidines, with moderate, micromolar affinity. Our data demonstrate that low micromolar zinc accelerates the fibrillization of human Tau protein via bridging Cys-291 and Cys-322 in physiological reducing conditions, providing clues to understanding the relationship between zinc dyshomeostasis and the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases.

IntroductionTau, a microtubule-associated protein, is the major protein subunit of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), 2The abbreviations used are: NFTneurofibrillary tanglesAFMatomic force microscopyDMdouble mutant C291A/C322A of Tau244–372DTTdithiothreitolITCisothermal titration calorimetryPHFpaired helical filamentsTEMtransmission electron microscopyThTthioflavin TWTwild-type Tau244–372. which are found in a group of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (1.Kuret J. Chirita C.N. Congdon E.E. Kannanayakal T. Li G. Necula M. Yin H. Zhong Q. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1739: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 2.Skovronsky D.M. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2006; 1: 151-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). NFTs are mainly composed of bundles of Tau in the form of paired helical filaments (PHFs), straight filaments, or twisted ribbons. It is generally believed that the neuron degeneration in such diseases is very likely to be contributed by the accumulation of these aggregates (3.Braak H. Braak E. Neurobiol. Aging. 1997; 18: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar). Thus the characterization of factors involved in abnormal Tau aggregation is of great importance to clarify the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases and assist in the establishment of medical treatment.Tau is one of the largest proteins without recognizable secondary structure and adopts a natively unfolded structure in solution (4.Mandelkow E. Song Y.H. Schweers O. Marx A. Mandelkow E.M. Neurobiol. Aging. 1995; 16: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). There are two distinct domains of Tau protein, the projection domain and the microtubule binding domain. The microtubule binding domain mainly contains either three or four imperfect repeats (18 amino acids in length) separated from one another by inter repeats (13–14 amino acids in length) (5.Rosenberg K.J. Ross J.L. Feinstein H.E. Feinstein S.C. Israelachvili J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 7445-7450Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In its normal state, Tau facilitates and stabilizes the assembly of microtubules. But under certain pathological conditions, it will detach from microtubules. Some of its small segments adopt a β-conformation, and further interactions convert them toward formation of aggregates that are rich in β-sheet structures. These aggregates undergo filament nucleation and elongation and form NFTs eventually (1.Kuret J. Chirita C.N. Congdon E.E. Kannanayakal T. Li G. Necula M. Yin H. Zhong Q. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1739: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 2.Skovronsky D.M. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Annu. Rev.

The microtubule binding repeat region forms the core of filaments while the rest of the protein retains its largely unfolded structure, which forms the fuzzy coat of the filaments (7.Mandelkow E. von Bergen M. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Brain Pathol. 2007; 17: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 8.Wille H. Drewes G. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. J.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1988; 85: 4506-4510Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar).Although the mechanism by which Tau protein aggregates is not fully understood, there are increasing evidences showing that a disturbance of brain zinc homeostasis during aging plays a role in the etiology of Alzheimer disease (10.Bush A.I. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 184-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 11.Barnham K.J. Bush A.I. Curr. Opin. Chem.

Zinc is an integral component of numerous enzymes, transcription factors, and structural proteins. Furthermore, zinc is one of the most abundant transition metals in the brain and is in particularly large concentrations in the mammalian brain with an overall concentration of ∼150 μm (13.Weiss J.H. Sensi S.L. Koh J.Y. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 395-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). The distribution of zinc is not uniform, and up to 15% of brain zinc is located inside presynaptic vesicles (13.Weiss J.H. Sensi S.L. Koh J.Y. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 395-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 14.Koh J.Y. Mol. Neurobiol. 2001; 24: 99-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the cytosolic free concentration of Zn2+ in cultured neurons is generally subnanomolar, in pathological conditions the free concentration of Zn2+ is altered via several pathways such as presynaptic zinc translocation (15.Frederickson C.J. Koh J.Y. Bush A.I. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 449-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar).There is current evidence for a relative increase in intracellular zinc in vulnerable regions of the Alzheimer disease brain (16.Thompson C.M. Markesbery W.R. Ehmann W.D. Mao Y.X. Vance D.E. Neurotoxicology. 1988; 9: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar), and abnormally high levels of zinc at millimolar concentrations have been found in NFTs and senile plaque cores (17.Assaf S.Y. Chung S.H. Nature. 1984; 308: 734-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar, 18.Hutchinson R.W. Cox A.G. McLeod C.W. Marshall P.S. Harper A. Dawson E.L. Howlett D.R. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 346: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). It is estimated that strong activation of Zn2+-containing presynaptic terminals results in transient local synaptic Zn2+ concentrations in the 100–300 μm range (13.Weiss J.H. Sensi S.L. Koh J.Y. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 395-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 17.Assaf S.Y. Chung S.H. Nature. 1984; 308: 734-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). Histochemically reactive zinc deposits are also found specifically localized to cerebral amyloid angiopathy deposits and NFT-bearing neurons (19.Adlard P.A. Bush A.I. J. Alzheimers Dis. 2006; 10: 145-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). It has been reported that there are 3- to 5-fold increases in zinc in the cortical and accessory basal nuclei of the amygdala and in the neuropil of Alzheimer disease patients, as compared with age-matched controls (20.Lovell M.A. Robertson J.D. Teesdale W.J. Campbell J.L. Markesbery W.R. J. Neurol. Sci. 1998; 158: 47-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar).Zinc has been shown to accelerate the aggregation of amyloid β peptides (21.Bush A.I. Pettingell W.H.

Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 3253-3260Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). There are also results indicating that Ca2+ and Mg2+ can selectively induce the formation of PHF-Tau aggregation (25.Yang L.S. Ksiezak-Reding H. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 55: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), whereas Al3+, Cu2+, and Fe2+/Fe3+ can bind to Tau (26.Shin R.W. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. J.

Neurochem. 2000; 74: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). However, whether Zn2+ has an effect on the aggregation of Tau has not been reported so far, which leaves us to answer the physiological question whether the alteration of zinc can affect Tau aggregation and thus play a role in the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease.In the present study, by using several biophysical methods, such as thioflavin T binding, atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we investigated the impact of zinc on the aggregation of human Tau fragment Tau244–372. Our results indicated that low micromolar zinc dramatically accelerated fibril formation of wild-type Tau244–372 in the presence of dithiothreitol (DTT), but had no obvious effects on fibrillization kinetics of single mutants C291A and C322A and double mutant C291A/C322A.

NFTs are mainly composed of bundles of Tau in the form of paired helical filaments (PHFs), straight filaments, or twisted ribbons. It is generally believed that the neuron degeneration in such diseases is very likely to be contributed by the accumulation of these aggregates (3.Braak H. Braak E. Neurobiol. Aging. 1997; 18: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar).

Tau is one of the largest proteins without recognizable secondary structure and adopts a natively unfolded structure in solution (4.Mandelkow E. Song Y.H. Schweers O. Marx A. Mandelkow E.M. Neurobiol. Aging. 1995; 16: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). There are two distinct domains of Tau protein, the projection domain and the microtubule binding domain. The microtubule binding domain mainly contains either three or four imperfect repeats (18 amino acids in length) separated from one another by inter repeats (13–14 amino acids in length) (5.Rosenberg K.J. Ross J.L. Feinstein H.E. Feinstein S.C. Israelachvili J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 7445-7450Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In its normal state, Tau facilitates and stabilizes the assembly of microtubules. But under certain pathological conditions, it will detach from microtubules. Some of its small segments adopt a β-conformation, and further interactions convert them toward formation of aggregates that are rich in β-sheet structures. These aggregates undergo filament nucleation and elongation and form NFTs eventually (1.Kuret J. Chirita C.N. Congdon E.E. Kannanayakal T. Li G. Necula M. Yin H. Zhong Q. Biochim. Biophys.

The microtubule binding repeat region forms the core of filaments while the rest of the protein retains its largely unfolded structure, which forms the fuzzy coat of the filaments (7.Mandelkow E. von Bergen M.

Although the mechanism by which Tau protein aggregates is not fully understood, there are increasing evidences showing that a disturbance of brain zinc homeostasis during aging plays a role in the etiology of Alzheimer disease (10.Bush A.I.

Zinc is an integral component of numerous enzymes, transcription factors, and structural proteins. Furthermore, zinc is one of the most abundant transition metals in the brain and is in particularly large concentrations in the mammalian brain with an overall concentration of ∼150 μm (13.Weiss J.H. Sensi S.L. Koh J.Y. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 395-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). The distribution of zinc is not uniform, and up to 15% of brain zinc is located inside presynaptic vesicles (13.Weiss J.H. Sensi S.L. Koh J.Y. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 395-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 14.Koh J.Y. Mol. Neurobiol. 2001; 24: 99-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the cytosolic free concentration of Zn2+ in cultured neurons is generally subnanomolar, in pathological conditions the free concentration of Zn2+ is altered via several pathways such as presynaptic zinc translocation (15.Frederickson C.J. Koh J.Y. Bush A.I. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 449-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar). There is current evidence for a relative increase in intracellular zinc in vulnerable regions of the Alzheimer disease brain (16.Thompson C.M. Markesbery W.R. Ehmann W.D. Mao Y.X. Vance D.E. Neurotoxicology. 1988; 9: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar), and abnormally high levels of zinc at millimolar concentrations have been found in NFTs and senile plaque cores (17.Assaf S.Y. Chung S.H.

Biochem. 2005; 346: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). It is estimated that strong activation of Zn2+-containing presynaptic terminals results in transient local synaptic Zn2+ concentrations in the 100–300 μm range (13.Weiss J.H. Sensi S.L. Koh J.Y. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 395-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 17.Assaf S.Y. Chung S.H. Nature. 1984; 308: 734-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). Histochemically reactive zinc deposits are also found specifically localized to cerebral amyloid angiopathy deposits and NFT-bearing neurons (19.Adlard P.A. Bush A.I. J. Alzheimers Dis. 2006; 10: 145-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). It has been reported that there are 3- to 5-fold increases in zinc in the cortical and accessory basal nuclei of the amygdala and in the neuropil of Alzheimer disease patients, as compared with age-matched controls (20.Lovell M.A. Robertson J.D. Teesdale W.J. Campbell J.L. Markesbery W.R. J. Neurol. Sci. 1998; 158: 47-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar). Zinc has been shown to accelerate the aggregation of amyloid β peptides (21.Bush A.I. Pettingell W.H. Multhaup G. d Paradis M. Vonsattel J.P. Gusella J.F. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Tanzi R.E.

There are also results indicating that Ca2+ and Mg2+ can selectively induce the formation of PHF-Tau aggregation (25.Yang L.S. Ksiezak-Reding H. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 55: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), whereas Al3+, Cu2+, and Fe2+/Fe3+ can bind to Tau (26.Shin R.W. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. J.

However, whether Zn2+ has an effect on the aggregation of Tau has not been reported so far, which leaves us to answer the physiological question whether the alteration of zinc can affect Tau aggregation and thus play a role in the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease. In the present study, by using several biophysical methods, such as thioflavin T binding, atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we investigated the impact of zinc on the aggregation of human Tau fragment Tau244–372. Our results indicated that low micromolar zinc dramatically accelerated fibril formation of wild-type Tau244–372 in the presence of dithiothreitol (DTT), but had no obvious effects on fibrillization kinetics of single mutants C291A and C322A and double mutant C291A/C322A. Further, we demonstrated that Zn2+ bound to Tau molecules via tetrahedral coordination to Cys-291, Cys-322, and two histidines with moderate, micromolar affinity, and thus concluded that low micromolar zinc promoted the fibrillization of human Tau protein via bridging of Cys-291 and Cys-322 in physiological reducing conditions.

https://openalex.org/W2047392757,"LKB1 encodes a serine/threonine kinase, which functions upstream of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) superfamily. To clarify the role of LKB1 in heart, we generated and characterized cardiac myocyte-specific LKB1 knock-out (KO) mice using alpha-myosin heavy chain-Cre deletor strain. LKB1-KO mice displayed biatrial enlargement with atrial fibrillation and cardiac dysfunction at 4 weeks of age. Left ventricular hypertrophy was observed in LKB1-KO mice at 12 weeks but not 4 weeks of age. Collagen I and III mRNA expression was elevated in atria at 4 weeks, and atrial fibrosis was seen at 12 weeks. LKB1-KO mice displayed cardiac dysfunction and atrial fibrillation and died within 6 months of age. Indicative of a prohypertrophic environment, the phosphorylation of AMPK and eEF2 was reduced, whereas mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) phosphorylation and p70S6 kinase phosphorylation were increased in both the atria and ventricles of LKB1-deficient mice. Consistent with vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA and protein levels being significantly reduced in LKB1-KO mice, these mice also exhibited a reduction in capillary density of both atria and ventricles. In cultured cardiac myocytes, LKB1 silencing induced hypertrophy, which was ameliorated by the expression of a constitutively active form AMPK or by treatment with the inhibitor of mTOR, rapamycin. These findings indicate that LKB1 signaling in cardiac myocytes is essential for normal development of the atria and ventricles. Cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction in LKB1-deficient hearts are associated with alterations in AMPK and mTOR/p70S6 kinase/eEF2 signaling and with a reduction in vascular endothelial growth factor expression and vessel rarefaction."

However, few studies have measured the direct effect of new energy production infrastructure on species persistence.We propose a systematic way to forecast patterns of future energy development and calculate impacts to species using spatially-explicit predictive modeling techniques to estimate oil and gas potential and create development build-out scenarios by seeding the landscape with oil and gas wells based on underlying potential. We illustrate our approach for the greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) in the western US and translate the build-out scenarios into estimated impacts on sage-grouse. We project that future oil and gas development will cause a 7-19 percent decline from 2007 sage-grouse lek population counts and impact 3.7 million ha of sagebrush shrublands and 1.1 million ha of grasslands in the study area.Maps of where oil and gas development is anticipated in the US Intermountain West can be used by decision-makers intent on minimizing impacts to sage-grouse. This analysis also provides a general framework for using predictive models and build-out scenarios to anticipate impacts to species. These predictive models and build-out scenarios allow tradeoffs to be considered between species conservation and energy development prior to implementation."
https://openalex.org/W2100988103,"Background The evolution of altruism has been explained mainly from ultimate perspectives. However, it remains to be investigated from a proximate point of view how and in which situations such social propensity is achieved. We investigated chimpanzees' targeted helping in a tool transfer paradigm, and discuss the similarities and differences in altruism between humans and chimpanzees. Previously it has been suggested that chimpanzees help human experimenters by retrieving an object which the experimenter is trying to reach. In the present study, we investigated the importance of communicative interactions between chimpanzees themselves and the influence of conspecific partner's request on chimpanzees' targeted helping. Methodology/Principal Findings We presented two tool-use situations (a stick-use situation and a straw-use situation) in two adjacent booths, and supplied non-corresponding tools to paired chimpanzees in the two booths. For example, a chimpanzee in the stick-use situation was supplied with a straw, and the partner in the straw-use situation possessed a stick. Spontaneous tool transfer was observed between paired chimpanzees. The tool transfer events occurred predominantly following recipients' request. Even without any hope of reciprocation from the partner, the chimpanzees continued to help the partner as long as the partner required help. Conclusions/Significance These results provide further evidence for altruistic helping in chimpanzees in the absence of direct personal gain or even immediate reciprocation. Our findings additionally highlight the importance of request as a proximate mechanism motivating prosocial behavior in chimpanzees whether between kin or non-kin individuals and the possible confounding effect of dominance on the symmetry of such interactions. Finally, in contrast to humans, our study suggests that chimpanzees rarely perform acts of voluntary altruism. Voluntary altruism in chimpanzees is not necessarily prompted by simple observation of another's struggle to attain a goal and therefore an accurate understanding of others' desires in the absence of communicative signals."
https://openalex.org/W2008290284,"Brd4 is a member of the bromodomains and extra terminal domain (BET) family of proteins that recognize acetylated chromatin structures through their bromodomains and act as transcriptional activators. Brd4 functions as an associated factor and positive regulator of P-TEFb, a Cdk9-cyclin T heterodimer that stimulates transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase II. Here, the crystal structures of the two bromodomains of Brd4 (BD1 and BD2) were determined at 1.5 and 1.2 A resolution, respectively. Complex formation of BD1 with a histone H3 tail polypeptide encompassing residues 12-19 showed binding of the Nzeta-acetylated lysine 14 to the conserved asparagine 140 of Brd4. In contrast, in BD2 the N-terminal linker sequence was found to interact with the binding site for acetylated lysines of the adjacent molecule to form continuous strings in the crystal lattice. This assembly shows for the first time a different binding ligand than acetylated lysine indicating that also other sequence compositions may be able to form similar interaction networks. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed best binding of BD1 to H3 and of BD2 to H4 acetylated lysine sequences, suggesting alternating histone recognition specificities. Intriguingly, an acetylated lysine motif from cyclin T1 bound similarly well to BD2. Whereas the structure of Brd2 BD1 suggested its dimer formation, both Brd4 bromodomains appeared monomeric in solution as shown by size exclusion chromatography and mutational analyses."
https://openalex.org/W1967566515,"Microplusin, a Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus antimicrobial peptide (AMP) is the first fully characterized member of a new family of cysteine-rich AMPs with histidine-rich regions at the N and C termini. In the tick, microplusin belongs to the arsenal of innate defense molecules active against bacteria and fungi. Here we describe the NMR solution structure of microplusin and demonstrate that the protein binds copper II and iron II. Structured as a single alpha-helical globular domain, microplusin consists of five alpha-helices: alpha1 (residues Gly-9 to Arg-21), alpha2 (residues Glu-27 to Asn-40), alpha3 (residues Arg-44 to Thr-54), alpha4 (residues Leu-57 to Tyr-64), and alpha5 (residues Asn-67 to Cys-80). The N and C termini are disordered. This structure is unlike any other AMP structures described to date. We also used NMR spectroscopy to map the copper binding region on microplusin. Finally, using the Gram-positive bacteria Micrococcus luteus as a model, we studied of mode of action of microplusin. Microplusin has a bacteriostatic effect and does not permeabilize the bacterial membrane. Because microplusin binds metals, we tested whether this was related to its antimicrobial activity. We found that the bacteriostatic effect of microplusin was fully reversed by supplementation of culture media with copper II but not iron II. We also demonstrated that microplusin affects M. luteus respiration, a copper-dependent process. Thus, we conclude that the antibacterial effect of microplusin is due to its ability to bind and sequester copper II."
https://openalex.org/W2093873926,"The actin-binding protein filamin links membrane receptors to the underlying cytoskeleton. The cytoplasmic domains of these membrane receptors have been shown to bind to various filamin immunoglobulin repeats. Notably, among 24 human filamin repeats, repeat 17 was reported to specifically bind to platelet receptor glycoprotein Ibalpha and repeat 21 to integrins. However, a complete sequence alignment of all 24 human filamin repeats reveals that repeats 17 and 21 actually belong to a distinct filamin repeat subgroup (containing repeats 4, 9, 12, 17, 19, 21, and 23) that shares a conserved ligand-binding site. Using isothermal calorimetry and NMR analyses, we show that all repeats in this subgroup can actually bind glycoprotein Ibalpha, integrins, and a cytoskeleton regulator migfilin in similar manners. These data provide a new view on the ligand specificity of the filamin repeats. They also suggest a multiple ligand binding mechanism where similar repeats within a filamin monomer may promote receptor clustering or receptor cross-talking for regulation of the cytoskeleton organization and diverse filamin-mediated cellular activities."

https://openalex.org/W1997300107,"In plants, iron homeostasis is tightly regulated to supply sufficient amounts of this metal for an optimal growth while preventing excess accumulation to avoid oxidative stress.

Mutants in the TIC gene exhibited a chlorotic phenotype rescued by exogenous iron addition and are hypersensitive to iron during the early stages of development. We showed that iron overload-responsive genes are regulated by TIC and by the central oscillator of the circadian clock. TIC represses their expression under low iron conditions, and its activity requires light and light/dark cycles.

These results showed that the regulation of iron homeostasis in plants is a major output of the TIC- and central oscillator-dependent signaling pathways. IntroductionIron is an essential element for all organisms. However, its physiological concentration needs to be tightly regulated because of its high reactivity with oxygen (1.Cadenas E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 79-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). The regulatory mechanisms controlling iron homeostasis in bacteria and animals are well documented (2.Andrews N.C. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2000; 1: 208-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 3.Andrews S.C. Robinson A.K. Rodriguez-Quinones F. FEMS Microbiology Reviews. 2003; 27: 215-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar), in contrast with the lack of knowledge in plants.This last decade, a wealth of information has been obtained on the molecular characterization of genes involved in iron acquisition by roots, in iron allocation to various organs, and in subcellular compartmentalization of iron in plants (reviewed in Refs. 4.Kim S.A. Guerinot M.L. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 2273-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar and 5.Briat J.F. Curie C. Gaymard F. Curr. Opin. Plant. Biol. 2007; 10: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The present challenge in this field concerns our understanding of the integration of these functions at the whole plant level and the signaling networks and regulatory molecules responsible for the control of iron dynamics in plants. Although the iron regulation of genes involved in uptake and storage has been widely studied, only a few components of the iron signaling pathway are known. Furthermore, studies regarding this aspect have, up until now, focused on the identification of regulatory proteins that function in the iron deficiency signaling pathway (reviewed in Refs. 6.Briat J. Cellier F. Gaymard F. Ferritins and iron accumulation in plant tissues..in: Barton L. Abadia J. Iron Nutrition in Plants and Rhizospheric Microorganisms. Kluwer Academic, 2005Google Scholar and 7.Pilon M. Cohu C.M. Ravet K. Abdel-Ghany S.E. Gaymard F. Curr. Opin. Plant. Biol. 2009; 12: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Hence, genes involved in iron excess signaling pathways have yet to be identified in plants. One of the primary responses to iron excess is a quick accumulation of a large amount of ferritins in plastids (reviewed in Ref. 6.Briat J. Cellier F. Gaymard F. Ferritins and iron accumulation in plant tissues..in: Barton L. Abadia J. Iron Nutrition in Plants and Rhizospheric Microorganisms. Kluwer Academic, 2005Google Scholar). Ferritins play an essential role in iron homeostasis by sequestering iron in a bio-available and nontoxic form, thus preventing oxidative stress (8.Ravet K. Touraine B. Boucherez J. Briat J.F. Gaymard F. Cellier F. Plant J. 2009; 57: 400-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Among the four ferritin genes of Arabidopsis thaliana, AtFer1 is the most highly expressed in response to iron excess (8.Ravet K. Touraine B. Boucherez J. Briat J.F. Gaymard F. Cellier F. Plant J. 2009; 57: 400-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), making it an ideal model for studying iron homeostasis regulation. Furthermore, AtFer1-transcriptional regulation by the iron status occurs through a repression/derepression mechanism. Experiments based on serial deletions and site-directed mutagenesis of the AtFer1 ferritin promoter region allowed the identification of a 15-bp cis-acting element necessary for the iron-dependent regulation of the AtFer1 transcription (9.Petit J.M. van Wuytswinkel O. Briat J.F. Lobréaux S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5584-5590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This sequence, named iron-dependent regulatory sequence (IDRS), 3The abbreviations used are: IDRSiron-dependent regulatory sequenceQ-PCRquantitative PCRRTLrelative transcript levelLUCluciferaseLDlight/darkLLcontinuous lightEMSethylmethane sulfonate. is involved in the repression of AtFer1 expression under iron deficiency (9.Petit J.M. van Wuytswinkel O.

Planta. 2003; 217: 709-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, iron addition leads to the derepression of AtFer1 rather than to its induction. To identify components of the iron signaling pathway, we screened for mutants impaired in the AtFer1 repression/derepression in response to iron status. We used a pAtFer1::LUC reporter line to identify ethyl methanesulfonate (11.Patton E.E. Willems A.R. Tyers M. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 236-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) mutants in Arabidopsis harboring a high LUC activity under repressive conditions, i.e. low iron. Two mutants, exhibiting a high LUC activity and a 10-fold increase in AtFer1 mRNA accumulation compared with wild type plants, were isolated and named dif3 and dif6 (deregulated in ferritin). They were allelic and mutated in the TIC (Time for Coffee) gene, which encodes a nuclear regulator of the circadian clock (12.Ding Z. Millar A.J. Davis A.M. Davis S.J. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 1522-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 13.Hall A. Bastow R.M. Davis S.J. Hanano S. McWatters H.G. Hibberd V. Doyle M.R. Sung S. Halliday K.J. Amasino R.M. Millar A.J. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 2719-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We showed that the mutation in TIC led to the derepression of AtFer1 under repressive conditions. The TIC-mediated AtFer1 regulation was circadian clock-dependent and did not occur through the cis-element IDRS. Our results showed that TIC and a functional central oscillator of the circadian clock are required for the expression of iron-regulated genes. This work points out that when plants do not experience iron excess, iron homeostasis is regulated through a circadian clock-dependent pathway, leading to the modulation of iron-responsive genes.DISCUSSIONA LUC-based genetic screen using the AtFer1 iron-responsive promoter was initiated to identify regulators of iron homeostasis. This genetic screen led to the identification of TIME FOR COFFE as a new regulator of the AtFer1 gene expression. We investigated the function of TIC and of the central oscillator of the circadian clock on the expression of AtFer1 and of other iron overload-responsive genes. We showed that iron overload-expressed genes are regulated by TIC and by the central oscillator of the circadian clock. TIC represses their expression under low iron conditions, and its activity requires light and LD cycles. For AtFer1, this repression is independent of the previously characterized cis-acting element IDRS, known to be involved in AtFer1 repression. Finally, mutants in the TIC gene exhibited a chlorotic phenotype rescued by exogenous iron addition and are hypersensitive to iron during the early stages of development. These results showed that the regulation of iron homeostasis in plants is a major output of TIC-dependent and central oscillator-dependent signaling pathways.TIC-, Circadian Clock-, and Light-mediated AtFer1 RegulationThe circadian clock generates endogenous 24-h rhythms and allows the anticipation of light and temperature changes in plants (31.Mas P. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2005; 49: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 38.Dunlap J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 271-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar). TIC was previously described as a nuclear regulator of the circadian clock in Arabidopsis and is specific to plants (12.Ding Z. Millar A.J. Davis A.M. Davis S.J. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 1522-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 13.Hall A. Bastow R.M. Davis S.J. Hanano S. McWatters H.G. Hibberd V. Doyle M.R. Sung S. Halliday K.J. Amasino R.M. Millar A.J. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 2719-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Because TIC is involved in a circadian network, we first investigated whether the TIC-mediated AtFer1 regulation occurs through a circadian mechanism. Our data showed that AtFer1 mRNA accumulation follows a 24-h rhythm in LD conditions (Fig. 3B). Surprisingly, in LL conditions, AtFer1 mRNA accumulation showed a 8-h phase advance compared with LD (19 h Zeitgeber time instead of 27 h Zeitgeber time) (Fig. 3B). It was previously shown that CAB expression peaked 6 h earlier in tic-1 than in the wild type and that the oscillator was arrested in this mutant after 19 h of light (13.Hall A. Bastow R.M. Davis S.J. Hanano S. McWatters H.G. Hibberd V. Doyle M.R. Sung S. Halliday K.J. Amasino R.M. Millar A.J. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 2719-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The use of mutants impaired in the morning (lhy-21 and cca1-11) and in the evening (elf4-1) loops of the central oscillator confirmed that the TIC-mediated AtFer1 expression occurs through the clock, because AtFer1 mRNA accumulation was not rhythmic in these mutants under LD conditions (Fig. 3D). Put together, these results suggested that TIC regulates AtFer1 expression through a circadian pathway.The rhythm of AtFer1 mRNA accumulation was lost in tic-2, and the transcript amount was systematically higher when compared with Col (Fig. 3D). This result showed that TIC represses AtFer1 expression in low iron condition and that the repressed state of AtFer1 is clock-regulated. The IDRS cis-element, located in the proximal region of the AtFer1 promoter, has already been shown to be involved in AtFer1 repression (9.Petit J.M. van Wuytswinkel O. Briat J.F. Lobréaux S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5584-5590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). A regulating pathway involving the trans-element TIC and the cis-element IDRS was therefore an attractive hypothesis to test. The analysis of Arabidopsis transgenic lines, carrying either a mutation in the TIC gene and/or in the IDRS, demonstrated that the effects of both mutations were additive and, thus, that the TIC-mediated AtFer1 regulation is independent of the IDRS (Fig. 5). It has been reported that, when plants carrying a pIDRS::GUS construct were subjected to a prolonged dark treatment, an increase of GUS activity was observed and that this phenomenon is IDRS-dependent (10.Tarantino D. Petit J.M. Lobréaux S. Briat J.F. Soave C. Murgia I. Planta. 2003; 217: 709-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In our study, AtFer1 transcript accumulation and ferritin protein accumulation occurred similarly in Col and tic-2 exposed to prolonged darkness (Fig. 6, C and D), showing that the dark-induced expression of AtFer1 is independent of the TIC regulator, which is consistent with the IDRS independence of the TIC-mediated AtFer1 regulation (Fig. 5). Thus, AtFer1 expression is under the control of two independent repressive pathways: one involving the IDRS cis-element and controlling the dark-induced transcriptional activation and one involving TIC and controlling the circadian-dependent AtFer1 regulation.AtFer1 expression is rhythmic, and the transcript amount peaks at dawn (Fig. 3B). Dawn is a time favorable for light-induced oxidative stress in leaves, and ferritins were shown to be involved in the protection against oxidative stress (8.Ravet K. Touraine B. Boucherez J. Briat J.F. Gaymard F. Cellier F. Plant J. 2009; 57: 400-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Thus, it was consistent that the maximum level of AtFer1 mRNA abundance was observed at this time. We showed that the TIC-mediated AtFer1 regulation requires light and LD cycles (Fig. 6). TIC and ELF3 were reported to transduce the light signal to the central oscillator and to affect the circadian clock via the gating mechanism (12.Ding Z. Millar A.J. Davis A.M. Davis S.J. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 1522-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 13.Hall A. Bastow R.M. Davis S.J. Hanano S. McWatters H.G. Hibberd V. Doyle M.R. Sung S. Halliday K.J. Amasino R.M.

Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1293-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The tic and the elf3 mutations seem to show an epistatic interaction, and phenotypes in the double mutant tic elf3 were additive or intermediate between the single mutants (12.Ding Z. Millar A.J. Davis A.M. Davis S.J. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 1522-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 13.Hall A. Bastow R.M. Davis S.J. Hanano S. McWatters H.G. Hibberd V. Doyle M.R. Sung S. Halliday K.J. Amasino R.M. Millar A.J. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 2719-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Thus, it should be interesting to analyze AtFer1 expression in elf3 and tic elf3 mutants to determine whether the rhythm and the dawn-induced transcript accumulation are affected. This will allow us to know whether ELF3, like TIC, is necessary for the regulation of AtFer1 expression, and whether they act redundantly.TIC Controls Iron HomeostasisMost of the studies regarding the regulation of ferritin expression focused on the transcriptional activation by iron (reviewed in Ref. 42.Briat J.F. Ravet K. Arnaud N. Duc C. Boucherez J. Touraine B. Cellier F. Gaymard F. Ann. Bot. (Lond). 2009; (doi: mcp128 [pii])10.1093/aob/mcp128PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated whether a link between the TIC-mediated regulation and the iron-signaling pathway exists, especially if TIC could affect other iron-responsive gene expression (Fig. 4). Indeed, AtFer3, AtFer4, and AtAPX1 expression was up-regulated in tic-2. The analysis of an AtFer1 overexpressing line clearly demonstrated that the increase of AtFer3, AtFer4, and AtAPX1 mRNA levels in tic-2 was not a secondary effect of the AtFer1 overexpression but resulted from the tic mutation itself. Consequently, besides AtFer1, TIC is also a repressor of AtFer3, AtFer4, and AtAPX1 expression. Interestingly, in contrast to AtFer1, which is derepressed by iron through the IDRS box (9.Petit J.M. van Wuytswinkel O. Briat J.F. Lobréaux S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5584-5590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), AtAPX1 is transcriptionally activated by iron (35.Fourcroy P. Vansuyt G. Kushnir S. Inze D. Briat J.F. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, TIC acts as a repressor of both iron derepressed, i.e. AtFer1, and iron activated, i.e. AtAPX1, genes. By contrast, TIC did not affect the expression of iron deficiency-regulated genes such as AtIRT1 or AtFRO2, and that was independent of the iron supply conditions (Fig. 4, E and F). Interestingly, whereas ferritin overexpression increases root ferric reductase activity and leaf iron concentration in tobacco plants (43.Van Wuytswinkel O. Vansuyt G. Grignon N. Fourcroy P. Briat J.F. Plant J. 1999; 17: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), the root iron uptake system was not activated in tic-2. This result suggested that overexpression of ferritin protein and a high ferritin gene expression arising from a TIC-mediated regulation defect did not lead to the same effect on the root iron uptake system.Analysis of the tic-2 mutant showed that the mutation in the TIC gene led to phenotypes related to iron (Fig. 2). When grown on soil, tic-2 exhibited an iron chlorosis, but because the total iron content was not changed in the mutant, this suggested that tic-2 was plausibly affected in iron use or location at the cellular or at the subcellular level rather than in iron uptake or translocation from roots to shoots (Fig. 4) (44.Ravet K. Touraine B. Kim S.A. Cellier F. Thomine S. Guerinot M.L. Briat J.-F. Gaymard F. Molecular Plant. 2009; doi: 10.1093/mp/ssp041PubMed Google Scholar). When grown in vitro, tic-2 plantlets were affected in their early development on both iron-sufficient or excess media. Thus, TIC appears to be a central regulator of iron homeostasis in plants. This study made, for the first time, the link between the iron nutrition and the circadian clock and showed that the control of iron homeostasis appears to be a new output of the light/circadian clock pathways. In arable soil, iron is poorly available for plants (45.Guerinot M.L. Yi Y. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 815-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), and iron starvation is commonly encountered. Iron is a limiting factor for plant productivity and biomass production (8.Ravet K. Touraine B. Boucherez J. Briat J.F. Gaymard F. Cellier F. Plant J. 2009; 57: 400-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 46.Blain S. Queguiner B. Armand L. Belviso S. Bombled B. Bopp L. Bowie A. Brunet C. Brussaard C. Carlotti F. Christaki U.

Science. 2007; 317: 1067-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Thus, plants do probably not often experience iron overload. Therefore, in natural conditions where iron is poorly available, light, circadian clock, and TIC are likely to constitute the major signaling pathway of iron homeostasis regulation.The next challenge will be to identify additional factors and components in this pathway, with special emphasis on the elements specific for the regulation of iron homeostasis. TIC is constitutively present among the circadian time (12.Ding Z. Millar A.J. Davis A.M. Davis S.J. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 1522-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and AtFer1 expression is not all the time repressed by TIC. This raises the question of the regulation of TIC activity during circadian time. A putative P-loop motif, common to numbers of ATP/GTP-binding proteins, was identified in the TIC protein (12.Ding Z. Millar A.J. Davis A.M. Davis S.J. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 1522-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It was suggested that this P-loop could bind to and be phosphorylated by a protein kinase (12.Ding Z. Millar A.J. Davis A.M. Davis S.J. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 1522-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). TIC activity could be regulated by (de)phosphorylation events (12.Ding Z. Millar A.J. Davis A.M. Davis S.J. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 1522-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and interestingly, a PP2A-type phosphatase promotes an increase of AtFer1 mRNA level (33.Arnaud N. Murgia I. Boucherez J. Briat J.F. Cellier F. Gaymard F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23579-23588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Hence, TIC could regulate AtFer1 expression according to its phosphorylation state. The phosphorylated form could repress AtFer1 expression all the time, except at dawn when the unphosphorylated form would allow the increase of AtFer1 expression.Recently, the Davis group screened for interactors of TIC and isolated the SNF1 stress-related kinase AKIN10 (48.Sanchez Villarreal, A., Davis, S. J., (2009) TIME FOR COFFEE sets the circadian clock at dawn by integrating metabolic signals. In 20th International Conference on Arabidopsis Research, Edinburgh, UK.Google Scholar). AKIN10 is homologous to two members of the conserved energy sensor protein kinase family, SNF1 (sucrose nonfermenting 1) in yeast and AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) in mammals, and was proposed as a master metabolic sensor (49.Baena-Gonzalez E. Rolland F. Thevelein J.M. Sheen J. Nature. 2007; 448: 938-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar, 50.Baena-Gonzalez E. Sheen J. Trends Plant Sci. 2008; 13: 474-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The SnRK1 (Snf1-related kinase) members AKIN10 and its homologue AKIN11 were shown to interact with SKP1/ASK1 (S phase kinase-associated protein 1/Arabidopsis SKP1-like 1) that mediates proteasomal binding of an ubiquitin ligase (51.Farras R. Ferrando A. Jasik J. Kleinow T. Okresz L. Tiburcio A. Salchert K. del Pozo C. Schell J. Koncz C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2742-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). This interaction is inhibited by PRL1 (pleiotropic response locus 1) that seemed to compete with SKP1 for binding to the C-terminal regulatory domain of AKIN10 and AKIN11. A recent genetic screen for identifying genes involved in the singlet oxygen signaling pathway (52.Baruah A. Simkova K. Apel K. Laloi C. Plant Mol. Biol. 2009; 70: 547-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) led to the isolation of a mutant in the PRL1 gene. Interestingly, the characterization of the prl1-5 mutant showed that the expression of AtFer1 and AtAPX1 was constitutively repressed in this mutant when compared with Col (53.Baruah A. Simkova K. Hincha D.K. Apel K. Laloi C. Plant J. 2009; (doi: TPJ3935 [pii])10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03935.xGoogle Scholar). This result suggested that PRL1 could be a positive regulator of the TIC activity. Thus, a regulatory network involving TIC, AKIN10, and PRL1 could be hypothesized for regulating iron homeostasis. TIC would be active when phosphorylated and would repress the AtFer and AtAPX1 genes. This active state would be (directly or indirectly) promoted by the AKIN10 kinase, and dawn favors the dephosphorylation of TIC, leading to the activation of the target gene expression. Because AKIN10 is negatively regulated by PRL1, AKIN10 could so constitutively activate TIC in prl1 mutants, leading to a lack of AtFer and AtAPX1 derepression at dawn and to a constitutive repression (53.Baruah A. Simkova K. Hincha D.K. Apel K. Laloi C. Plant J. 2009; (doi: TPJ3935 [pii])10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03935.xGoogle Scholar).Input Signal IntegrationOur study identified TIC as a major regulator of iron homeostasis in plants. Interestingly, two integrators of stress and energy signaling, AKIN10 (49.Baena-Gonzalez E. Rolland F. Thevelein J.M. Sheen J. Nature. 2007; 448: 938-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar) and PRL1 (53.Baruah A. Simkova K. Hincha D.K. Apel K. Laloi C.

U.S.A. 1999; 96: 5322-5327Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), were recently shown to be connected to TIC and/or involved in the regulation of some iron-responsive gene expression. In response to energy deficit associated with stresses, the SnRK1 kinases seem to initiate genome-wide transcriptional changes that allow to restore homeostasis and to develop long term responses contributing to adaptation and preservation of growth and development. Regulatory mechanisms were evidenced to coordinate several inputs, such as light, circadian clock, or nutrient signals, into a complex signaling network in which only some insights have started to be understood (49.Baena-Gonzalez E.

Considering the essential functions of iron and iron-containing proteins in central metabolic processes such as photosynthesis, respiration, nitrogen, and sulfur assimilation (reviewed in Ref. 42.Briat J.F. Ravet K. Arnaud N. Duc C. Boucherez J. Touraine B. Cellier F. Gaymard F. Ann. Bot. (Lond). 2009; (doi: mcp128 [pii])10.1093/aob/mcp128PubMed Google Scholar), interplays regulating iron homeostasis should be assessed and elucidated to understand how the cellular energy signaling is fully integrated into whole plant adaptation and regulation of growth and development. IntroductionIron is an essential element for all organisms. However, its physiological concentration needs to be tightly regulated because of its high reactivity with oxygen (1.Cadenas E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 79-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). The regulatory mechanisms controlling iron homeostasis in bacteria and animals are well documented (2.Andrews N.C. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2000; 1: 208-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 3.Andrews S.C. Robinson A.K. Rodriguez-Quinones F. FEMS Microbiology Reviews. 2003; 27: 215-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar), in contrast with the lack of knowledge in plants.This last decade, a wealth of information has been obtained on the molecular characterization of genes involved in iron acquisition by roots, in iron allocation to various organs, and in subcellular compartmentalization of iron in plants (reviewed in Refs. 4.Kim S.A. Guerinot M.L. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 2273-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar and 5.Briat J.F. Curie C. Gaymard F. Curr. Opin. Plant. Biol. 2007; 10: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The present challenge in this field concerns our understanding of the integration of these functions at the whole plant level and the signaling networks and regulatory molecules responsible for the control of iron dynamics in plants. Although the iron regulation of genes involved in uptake and storage has been widely studied, only a few components of the iron signaling pathway are known. Furthermore, studies regarding this aspect have, up until now, focused on the identification of regulatory proteins that function in the iron deficiency signaling pathway (reviewed in Refs. 6.Briat J. Cellier F. Gaymard F. Ferritins and iron accumulation in plant tissues..in: Barton L. Abadia J. Iron Nutrition in Plants and Rhizospheric Microorganisms. Kluwer Academic, 2005Google Scholar and 7.Pilon M. Cohu C.M. Ravet K. Abdel-Ghany S.E. Gaymard F. Curr. Opin. Plant. Biol. 2009; 12: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Hence, genes involved in iron excess signaling pathways have yet to be identified in plants. One of the primary responses to iron excess is a quick accumulation of a large amount of ferritins in plastids (reviewed in Ref. 6.Briat J. Cellier F. Gaymard F. Ferritins and iron accumulation in plant tissues..in: Barton L. Abadia J. Iron Nutrition in Plants and Rhizospheric Microorganisms. Kluwer Academic, 2005Google Scholar). Ferritins play an essential role in iron homeostasis by sequestering iron in a bio-available and nontoxic form, thus preventing oxidative stress (8.Ravet K. Touraine B. Boucherez J. Briat J.F. Gaymard F. Cellier F. Plant J. 2009; 57: 400-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Among the four ferritin genes of Arabidopsis tha"
https://openalex.org/W2168000927,"Background The enhancement of cell motility is a critical event during tumor cell spreading. Since myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) regulates cell behavior, it is regarded as a promising target in terms of preventing tumor invasion and metastasis. Since MLCK was identified to be associated with human arrest defective-1 (hARD1) through yeast two-hybrid screening, we here tested the possibility that hARD1 acts as a regulator of MLCK and by so doing controls tumor cell motility. Methodology/Principal Findings The physical interaction between MLCK and hARD1 was confirmed both in vivo and in vitro by immunoprecipitation assay and affinity chromatography. hARD1, which is known to have the activity of protein lysine ε-acetylation, bound to and acetylated MLCK activated by Ca2+ signaling, and by so doing deactivated MLCK, which led to a reduction in the phosphorylation of MLC. Furthermore, hARD1 inhibited tumor cell migration and invasion MLCK-dependently. Our mutation study revealed that hARD1 associated with an IgG motif of MLCK and acetylated the Lys608 residue in this motif. The K608A-mutated MLCK was neither acetylated nor inactivated by hARD1, and its stimulatory effect on cell motility was not inhibited by hARD1. Conclusion/Significance These results indicate that hARD1 is a bona fide regulator of MLCK, and that hARD1 plays a crucial role in the balance between tumor cell migration and stasis. Thus, hARD1 could be a therapeutic target in the context of preventing tumor invasion and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2017350087,"Apoptosis and proliferation are two dynamically and tightly regulated processes that together maintain the homeostasis of renewable tissues. Anoikis is a subtype of apoptosis induced by detachment of adherent cells from the extracellular matrix. By using the defined mTeSR1 medium and collecting freshly detached cells, we found here that human pluripotent stem (PS) cells including embryonic stem (ES) cells and induced pluripotent stem cells are subject to constant anoikis in culture, which is escalated in the absence of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). Withdrawal of bFGF also promotes apoptosis and differentiation of the remaining adherent cells without affecting their cell cycle progression. Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) has previously been reported to act downstream of FGF signaling to support self-renewal of human ES cells. However, we found that IGF2 cannot substitute bFGF in the TeSR1-supported culture, although endogenous IGF signaling is required to sustain self-renewal of human ES cells. On the other hand, all of the bFGF withdrawal effects observed here can be markedly prevented by the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK. We further demonstrated that the bFGF-repressed anoikis is dependent on activation of ERK and AKT and associated with inhibition of Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death and the caspase-ROCK1-myosin signaling. Anoikis is independent of pre-detachment apoptosis and differentiation of the cells. Because previous studies of human PS cells have been focused on attached cells, our findings revealed a neglected role of bFGF in sustaining self-renewal of human PS cells: preventing them from anoikis via inhibition of caspase activation."
https://openalex.org/W2078193456,"Gram-negative bacteria use the sophisticated type II secretion system (T2SS) to secrete a large number of exoproteins into the extracellular environment. Five proteins of the T2SS, the pseudopilins GspG-H-I-J-K, are proposed to assemble into a pseudopilus involved in the extrusion of the substrate through the outer membrane channel. Recent structural data have suggested that the three pseudopilins GspI-J-K are organized in a trimeric complex located at the tip of the GspG-containing pseudopilus. In the present work we combined two biochemical techniques to investigate the protein-protein interaction network between the five Pseudomonas aeruginosa Xcp pseudopilins. The soluble domains of XcpT-U-V-W-X (respectively homologous to GspG-H-I-J-K) were purified, and the interactions were tested by surface plasmon resonance and affinity co-purification in all possible combinations. We found an XcpV(I)-W(J)-X(K) complex, which demonstrates that the crystallized trimeric complex also exists in the P. aeruginosa T2SS. Interestingly, our systematic approach revealed an additional and yet uncharacterized interaction between XcpU(H) and XcpW(J). This observation suggested the existence of a quaternary, rather than ternary, complex (XcpU(H)-V(I)-W(J)-X(K)) at the tip of the pseudopilus. The assembly of this quaternary complex was further demonstrated by co-purification using affinity chromatography. Moreover, by testing various combinations of pseudopilins by surface plasmon resonance and affinity chromatography, we were able to dissect the different possible successive steps occurring during the formation of the quaternary complex. We propose a model in which XcpV(I) is the nucleator that first binds XcpX(K) and XcpW(J) at different sites. Then the ternary complex recruits XcpU(H) through a direct interaction with XcpW(J)."
https://openalex.org/W1990122826,"Background Reconstructing the dispersal patterns of extinct hominins remains a challenging but essential goal. One means of supplementing fossil evidence is to utilize archaeological evidence in the form of stone tools. Based on broad dating patterns, it has long been thought that the appearance of Acheulean handaxe technologies outside of Africa was the result of hominin dispersals, yet independent tests of this hypothesis remain rare. Cultural transmission theory leads to a prediction of a strong African versus non-African phylogeographic pattern in handaxe datasets, if the African Acheulean hypothesis is to be supported. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, this prediction is tested using an intercontinental dataset of Acheulean handaxes and a biological phylogenetic method (maximum parsimony). The analyses produce a tree consistent with the phylogeographic prediction. Moreover, a bootstrap analysis provides evidence that this pattern is robust, and the maximum parsimony tree is also shown to be statistically different from a tree constrained by stone raw materials. Conclusions/Significance These results demonstrate that nested analyses of behavioural data, utilizing methods drawn from biology, have the potential to shed light on ancient hominin dispersals. This is an encouraging prospect for human palaeobiology since sample sizes for lithic artefacts are many orders of magnitude higher than those of fossil data. These analyses also suggest that the sustained occurrence of Acheulean handaxe technologies in regions such as Europe and the Indian subcontinent resulted from dispersals by African hominin populations."
https://openalex.org/W1991442409,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis profoundly exploits protein phosphorylation events carried out by serine/threonine protein kinases (STPKs) for its survival and pathogenicity. Forkhead-associated domains (FHA), the phosphorylation-responsive modules, have emerged as prominent players in STPK mediated signaling. In this study, we demonstrate the association of the previously uncharacterized FHA domain-containing protein Rv0019c with cognate STPK PknB. The consequent phosphorylation of Rv0019c is shown to be dependent on the conserved residues in the Rv0019c FHA domain and activation loop of PknB. Furthermore, by creating deletion mutants we identify Thr(36) as the primary phosphorylation site in Rv0019c. During purification of Rv0019c from Escherichia coli, the E. coli protein chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) specifically and reproducibly copurifies with Rv0019c in a FHA domain-dependent manner. On the basis of structural similarity of E. coli CAT with M. tuberculosis PapA5, a protein involved in phthiocerol dimycocerosate biosynthesis, PapA5 is identified as an interaction partner of Rv0019c. The interaction studies on PapA5, purified as an unphosphorylated protein from E. coli, with Rv0019c deletion mutants reveal that the residues N-terminal to the functional FHA domain of Rv0019c are critical for formation of the Rv0019c-PapA5 complex and thus constitute a previously unidentified phosphoindependent binding motif. Finally, PapA5 is shown to be phosphorylated on threonine residue(s) by PknB, whereas serine/threonine phosphatase Mstp completely reverses the phosphorylation. Thus, our data provides initial clues for a possible regulation of PapA5 and hence the phthiocerol dimycocerosate biosynthesis by PknB, either by direct phosphorylation of PapA5 or indirectly through Rv0019c."
https://openalex.org/W2105437226,"ATR (ATM and Rad3-related) initiates a DNA damage signaling pathway in human cells upon DNA damage induced by UV and UV-mimetic agents and in response to inhibition of DNA replication. Genetic data with human cells and in vitro data with Xenopus egg extracts have led to the conclusion that the kinase activity of ATR toward the signal-transducing kinase Chk1 depends on the mediator protein Claspin. Here we have reconstituted a Claspin-mediated checkpoint system with purified human proteins. We find that the ATR-dependent phosphorylation of Chk1, but not p53, is strongly stimulated by Claspin. Similarly, DNA containing bulky base adducts stimulates ATR kinase activity, and Claspin acts synergistically with damaged DNA to increase phosphorylation of Chk1 by ATR. Mutations in putative phosphorylation sites in the Chk1-binding domain of Claspin abolish its ability to mediate ATR phosphorylation of Chk1. We also find that a fragment of Claspin containing the Chk1-binding domain together with a domain conserved in the yeast Mrc1 orthologs of Claspin is sufficient for its mediator activity.

https://openalex.org/W1997703895,"Brain amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide accumulation and aggregation are critical events in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that LRP1 is involved in Alzheimer disease pathogenesis. The physiological ligands of LRP1, including apoE, play significant roles in the cellular clearance of Abeta. The receptor-associated protein (RAP) is a specialized chaperone for members of the low density lipoprotein receptor family. RAP shares structural and receptor-binding properties with apoE. Here, we show that RAP binds to both Abeta40 and Abeta42 in a concentration-dependent manner and forms complexes with them. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis showed that RAP significantly enhances the cellular internalization of Abeta in different cell types, including brain vascular smooth muscle, neuroblastoma, glioblastoma, and Chinese hamster ovary cells. This effect of RAP was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RAP binds to both LRP1 and heparin; however, the ability of RAP to enhance Abeta cellular uptake was blocked by heparin and heparinase treatment but not by LRP1 deficiency. Furthermore, the effects of RAP were significantly decreased in heparan sulfate proteoglycan-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells. Our findings reveal that RAP is a novel Abeta-binding protein that promotes cellular internalization of Abeta."
https://openalex.org/W2050281373,"Tensin is a family of multidomain scaffold proteins that bind the cytoplasmic tail of beta-integrins and localize to adhesions that anchor stress fibers in cells. Tensin expression is suppressed in cancer, especially metastatic cancer. The N-terminal domain of tensin1 associates with protein phosphatase-1alpha (PP1alpha) and mediates PP1alpha localization to adhesions. Here, we show F302A mutation in a KVXF motif of tensin1 abrogates binding to PP1alpha. The SH2 domain in tensin family member c-ten requires R474 to bind a RhoGAP called DLC-1 (deleted in liver cancer). We mutated the corresponding residue in tensin1, R1488A, and showed this reduces association with DLC-1. Unexpectedly, tensin1 F302A also had reduced association with DLC-1. Expression of tensin1 F302A or R1488A showed similar dominant phenotypes, with reduced cell polarization, lowered MLC20 phosphorylation and reduced levels of RhoA(GTP) compared with cells expressing tensin1 WT. However, migration and invasion of metastatic MDA MB 231 breast cancer cells were differentially affected by tensin1 mutated at F302A or R1488A. Cancer cells stably expressing F302A tensin1 showed increased migration and invasion compared with cells stably expressing either R1488A tensin1 or WT tensin1. This suggests that PP1alpha bound to tensin1 has additional effects in reducing migration and invasion that are not mediated through DLC-1. Our results show the importance of PP1alpha binding to tensin1 for the regulation of cell polarization, migration, and invasion."

In humans and other primates, melanoma antigen gene protein-A11 (MAGE-11) is an AR selective coregulator that increases AR transcriptional activity. Here we show that the interaction between AR and MAGE-11 is mediated by AR NH2-terminal FXXLF motif binding to a highly conserved MAGE-11 F-box in the MAGE homology domain, and is modulated by serum stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation of MAGE-11 Ser-174. The MAGE-11-dependent increase in AR transcriptional activity is mediated by a direct interaction between MAGE-11 and transcriptional intermediary factor 2 (TIF2) through the NH2-terminal region of TIF2, and by a MAGE-11 FXXIF motif interaction with an F-box-like region in activation domain 1 of TIF2.

Chem. 2001; 276: 42293-42301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The AR N/C interaction coordinates transcriptional activity between AF1 and AF2, in part by competitively inhibiting the SRC/p160 coactivator LXXLL motif binding to AF2 (15.He B. Bowen N.T. Minges J.T. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42293-42301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The regulatory effect of the AR N/C interaction is modulated by melanoma antigen gene protein-A11 (MAGE-11), a MAGE gene family member and AR coregulator that binds the AR NH2-terminal FXXLF motif, competes with the AR N/C interaction, and enhances AR transcriptional activity by increasing accessibility of AF2 for SRC/p160 coactivator recruitment (16.Bai S. He B. Wilson E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1238-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). MAGE-11 expression is limited to human and nonhuman primates (17.Chomez P. De Backer O. Bertrand M. De Plaen E. Boon T. Lucas S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5544-5551PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Rogner U.C. Wilke K. Steck E. Korn B. Poustka A. Genomics. 1995; 29: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), suggesting it arose during mammalian evolution as an additional control mechanism in the AR signaling network. Post-translational modification of MAGE-11 by phosphorylation of Thr-360, and subsequent monoubiquitinylation of Lys-240 and Lys-245 within the MAGE homology domain, a highly conserved region of the MAGE gene family, is induced by epidermal growth factor (EGF) and stabilizes the interaction with AR (19.Bai S. Wilson E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 1947-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The increase in MAGE-11 levels in castration-recurrent prostate cancer during androgen deprivation therapy by DNA hypomethylation at the transcriptional start site supports the concept that MAGE-11 increases AR signaling in prostate cancer (20.Karpf A.R. Bai S. James S.R. Mohler J.L. Wilson E.M. Mol. Cancer Res. 2009; 7: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular mechanisms whereby MAGE-11 enhances AR transactivation, we pursued observations that MAGE-11 acts coordinately with transcriptional intermediary factor 2 (TIF2), one of the SRC/p160 coactivators implicated in AR signaling (16.Bai S. He B. Wilson E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1238-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 19.Bai S. Wilson E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 1947-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that TIF2 can associate with the NH2-terminal region of AR, although the sites of interaction were not well defined (8.Lavery D.N. McEwan I.J. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 3352-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 10.He B. Kemppainen J.A. Voegel J.J. Gronemeyer H. Wilson E.M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 19: 8383-8392Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). We considered the possibility that MAGE-11 enhances AR activity from AF1 through a direct interaction between MAGE-11 and TIF2. The present study provides evidence that the AR NH2-terminal FXXLF motif interacts with a highly conserved MAGE-11 F-box (residues 329–369) in the MAGE homology domain, and that the interaction is modulated by mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphorylation of MAGE-11 Ser-174 in response to serum stimulation. MAGE-11 also interacts directly with the NH2-terminal region of TIF2, and with the TIF2 AD1 region through a MAGE-11 FXXIF motif (260FPEIF264). The results suggest AR-mediated gene transcription involves a novel protein interaction paradigm of the FXX(L/I)F motif binding to the F-box. Expression plasmids include pCMV-AR (22.Lubahn D.B.

FLAG-TIF2 vectors were constructed by a triple ligation: TIF2-(1–569) was PCR amplified from pSG5-TIF2 and digested with EcoRI/NdeI to obtain TIF2-(1–370); TIF2-(370–1464) was obtained by digesting the parent template with NdeI/XbaI; both fragments were ligated into EcoRI/XbaI sites of pCMV5-FLAG-b.

Additional MAGE-11 F-box deletion mutants were created by double PCR mutagenesis to create an EcoRI/XhoI MAGEΔ329–369 fragment that was inserted into the same sites of pSG5-HA to make pSG5-HA-MAGEΔ329–369, and into EcoRI/SalI sites of FLAG-b to make FLAG-MAGEΔ329–369. GAL-MAGE-(85–205) and –(112–205) were created by PCR amplifying pSG5-MAGE and inserting EcoRI/XhoI-digested fragments into GAL0 digested with EcoRI and SalI. GAL-MAGE-(112–170) was created by PCR amplifying the parent template and ligating the EcoRI/SalI-digested fragment into the same sites of GAL0.

https://openalex.org/W2046348382,"Human mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1 (hMDC1) is an essential component of the cellular response to DNA double strand breaks. Recently, hMDC1 has been shown to associate with a subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) (Coster, G., Hayouka, Z., Argaman, L., Strauss, C., Friedler, A., Brandeis, M., and Goldberg, M. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 32053-32064), a key regulator of mitosis, suggesting a possible role for hMDC1 in controlling normal cell cycle progression. Here, we extend this work to show that hMDC1 regulates normal metaphase-to-anaphase transition through its ability to bind directly to the APC/C and modulate its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. In support of a role for hMDC1 in controlling mitotic progression, depletion of hMDC1 by small interfering RNA results in a metaphase arrest that appears to be independent of both BubR1-dependent signaling pathways and ATM/ATR activation. Mitotic cells lacking hMDC1 exhibit markedly reduced levels of APC/C activity characterized by reduced levels of Cdc20, and a failure of Cdc20 to bind the APC/C and CREB-binding protein. We suggest therefore that hMDC1 functionally regulates the normal metaphase-to-anaphase transition by modulating the Cdc20-dependent activation of the APC/C."
https://openalex.org/W1965778360,"Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) is a Ca(2+)-releasing messenger. Biological data suggest that its receptor has two binding sites: one high-affinity locking site and one low-affinity opening site. To directly address the presence and function of these putative binding sites, we synthesized and tested analogues of the NAADP antagonist Ned-19. Ned-19 itself inhibits both NAADP-mediated Ca(2+) release and NAADP binding. A fluorometry bioassay was used to assess NAADP-mediated Ca(2+) release, whereas a radioreceptor assay was used to assess binding to the NAADP receptor (only at the high-affinity site). In Ned-20, the fluorine is para rather than ortho as in Ned-19. Ned-20 does not inhibit NAADP-mediated Ca(2+) release but inhibits NAADP binding. Conversely, Ned-19.4 (a methyl ester of Ned-19) inhibits NAADP-mediated Ca(2+) release but cannot inhibit NAADP binding. Furthermore, Ned-20 prevents the self-desensitization response characteristic of NAADP in sea urchin eggs, confirming that this response is mediated by a high-affinity allosteric site to which NAADP binds in the radioreceptor assay. Collectively, these data provide the first direct evidence for two binding sites (one high- and one low-affinity) on the NAADP receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2072554910,"Inactivation of U19/EAF2 has been shown previously to lead to tumorigenesis in multiple organs; however, the mechanism of U19/EAF2 tumor suppression remains unclear. In this paper, we report that the expression of an anti-angiogenic protein, thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is down-regulated in the prostate and liver of U19/EAF2 knockout mouse. The U19/EAF2 knockout liver displayed increased CD31-positive blood vessels, suggesting that the TSP-1 down-regulation can contribute to increased angiogenesis. TSP-1 is reported to be a p53-target gene and p53 is a known binding partner of ELL, which binds to U19/EAF2. Here, we show that U19/EAF2 can co-localize and co-immunoprecipitate with p53 in transfected cells. In a TSP-1 promoter-driven luciferase reporter assay, p53 transfection suppressed the TSP-1 promoter activity and U19/EAF2 co-transfection blocked the p53 suppression of TSP-1 promoter. However, U19/EAF2 transfection alone had little or no effect on the TSP-1 promoter. The above observations together suggest that U19/EAF2 regulates the expression of TSP-1 via blocking p53 repression of the TSP-1 promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2146675662,"Previous studies showed that the understanding of others' basic emotional experiences is based on a “resonant” mechanism, i.e., on the reactivation, in the observer's brain, of the cerebral areas associated with those experiences. The present study aimed to investigate whether the same neural mechanism is activated both when experiencing and attending complex, cognitively-generated, emotions. A gambling task and functional-Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging (fMRI) were used to test this hypothesis using regret, the negative cognitively-based emotion resulting from an unfavorable counterfactual comparison between the outcomes of chosen and discarded options. Do the same brain structures that mediate the experience of regret become active in the observation of situations eliciting regret in another individual? Here we show that observing the regretful outcomes of someone else's choices activates the same regions that are activated during a first-person experience of regret, i.e. the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and hippocampus. These results extend the possible role of a mirror-like mechanism beyond basic emotions."
https://openalex.org/W2158998808,"Parasitic nematodes cause serious diseases in humans, animals, and plants. They have limited lipid metabolism and are reliant on lipid-binding proteins to acquire these metabolites from their hosts. Several structurally novel families of lipid-binding proteins in nematodes have been described, including the fatty acid- and retinoid-binding protein family (FAR). In Caenorhabditis elegans, used as a model for studying parasitic nematodes, eight C. elegans FAR proteins have been described. The crystal structure of C. elegans FAR-7 is the first structure of a FAR protein, and it exhibits a novel fold. It differs radically from the mammalian fatty acid-binding proteins and has two ligand binding pockets joined by a surface groove. The first can accommodate the aliphatic chain of fatty acids, whereas the second can accommodate the bulkier retinoids. In addition to demonstrating lipid binding by fluorescence spectroscopy, we present evidence that retinol binding is positively regulated by casein kinase II phosphorylation at a conserved site near the bottom of the second pocket. far-7::GFP (green fluorescent protein) expression shows that it is localized in the head hypodermal syncytia and the excretory cell but that this localization changes under starvation conditions. In conclusion, our study provides the basic structural and functional information for investigation of inhibitors of lipid binding by FAR proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2058884753,"Presentation of peptides on Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules is the cornerstone in immune system activation and increased knowledge of the characteristics of MHC ligands and their source proteins is highly desirable.In the present large-scale study, we used a large data set of proteins containing experimentally identified MHC class I or II ligands and examined the proteins according to their expression profiles at the mRNA level and their Gene Ontology (GO) classification within the cellular component ontology. Proteins encoded by highly abundant mRNA were found to be much more likely to be the source of MHC ligands. Of the 2.5% most abundant mRNAs as much as 41% of the proteins encoded by these mRNAs contained MHC class I ligands. For proteins containing MHC class II ligands, the corresponding percentage was 11%. Furthermore, we found that most proteins containing MHC class I ligands were localised to the intracellular parts of the cell including the cytoplasm and nucleus. MHC class II ligand donors were, on the other hand, mostly membrane proteins.The results contribute to the ongoing debate concerning the nature of MHC ligand-containing proteins and can be used to extend the existing methods for MHC ligand predictions by including the source protein's localisation and expression profile. Improving the current methods is important in the growing quest for epitopes that can be used for vaccine or diagnostic purposes, especially when it comes to large DNA viruses and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2048307014,"Background Human Papillomavirus (HPV)-16 is a paradigm for “high-risk” HPVs, the causative agents of virtually all cervical carcinomas. HPV E6 and E7 viral genes are usually expressed in these tumors, suggesting key roles for their gene products, the E6 and E7 oncoproteins, in inducing malignant transformation. Methodology/Principal Findings By protein-protein interaction analysis, using mass spectrometry, we identified glutathione S-transferase P1-1 (GSTP1) as a novel cellular partner of the HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein. Following mapping of the region in the HPV-16 E7 sequence that is involved in the interaction, we generated a three-dimensional molecular model of the complex between HPV-16 E7 and GSTP1, and used this to engineer a mutant molecule of HPV-16 E7 with strongly reduced affinity for GSTP1.When expressed in HaCaT human keratinocytes, HPV-16 E7 modified the equilibrium between the oxidized and reduced forms of GSTP1, thereby inhibiting JNK phosphorylation and its ability to induce apoptosis. Using GSTP1-deficient MCF-7 cancer cells and siRNA interference targeting GSTP1 in HaCaT keratinocytes expressing either wild-type or mutant HPV-16 E7, we uncovered a pivotal role for GSTP1 in the pro-survival program elicited by its binding with HPV-16 E7. Conclusions/Significance This study provides further evidence of the transforming abilities of this oncoprotein, setting the groundwork for devising unique molecular tools that can both interfere with the interaction between HPV-16 E7 and GSTP1 and minimize the survival of HPV-16 E7-expressing cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2056426058,"Obesity invokes a range of metabolic disturbances, but the transition from a poor to excessive nutritional environment may exacerbate adult metabolic dysfunction. The current study investigated global maternal nutrient restriction during early or late gestation on glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in the adult offspring when lean and obese.Pregnant sheep received adequate (1.0M; CE, n = 6) or energy restricted (0.7M) diet during early (1-65 days; LEE, n = 6) or late (65-128 days; LEL, n = 7) gestation (term approximately 147 days). Subsequent offspring remained on pasture until 1.5 years when all received glucose and insulin tolerance tests (GTT & ITT) and body composition determination by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). All animals were then exposed to an obesogenic environment for 6-7 months and all protocols repeated. Prenatal dietary treatment had no effect on birth weight or on metabolic endpoints when animals were 'lean' (1.5 years). Obesity revealed generalised metabolic 'inflexibility' and insulin resistance; characterised by blunted excursions of plasma NEFA and increased insulin(AUC) (from 133 to 341 [s.e.d. 26] ng.ml(-1).120 mins) during a GTT, respectively. For LEL vs. CE, the peak in plasma insulin when obese was greater (7.8 vs. 4.7 [s.e.d. 1.1] ng.ml(-1)) and was exacerbated by offspring sex (i.e. 9.8 vs. 4.4 [s.e.d. 1.16] ng.ml(-1); LEL male vs. CE male, respectively). Acquisition of obesity also significantly influenced the plasma lipid and protein profile to suggest, overall, greater net lipogenesis and reduced protein metabolism.This study indicates generalised metabolic dysfunction with adult-onset obesity which also exacerbates and 'reveals' programming of glucose-insulin sensitivity in male offspring prenatally exposed to maternal undernutrition during late gestation. Taken together, the data suggest that metabolic function appears little compromised in young prenatally 'programmed' animals so long as weight is adequately controlled. Nutritional excess in adulthood exacerbates any programmed phenotype, indicating greater vigilance over weight control is required for those individuals exposed to nutritional thrift during gestation."

Tetrodotoxin (TTX) 2The abbreviations used are: TTXtetrodotoxinSSshort segment. is a specific and potent blocker of voltage-gated sodium channels, which are essential for the initiation and propagation of action potentials in almost all excitable cells (1.Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes.in: Hille B. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992: 59-82Google Scholar). TTX physically occludes the pore of sodium channels and blocks action potential conduction in nerve and muscle (1.Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes.in: Hille B. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992: 59-82Google Scholar). The blocking effect of TTX on the sodium channel was first discovered in lobster giant axons (2.Narahashi T. Moore J.W. Scott W.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1964; 47: 965-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). However, not all sodium channels are equally sensitive to TTX. For example, among the nine sodium channel isoforms (rNav1.1 to rNav1.9) from rats, TTX has high affinity for rNav1.1–1.4, rNav1.6, and rNav1.7, blocking these channels (TTX-S) at nanomolar concentrations. In contrast, micromolar concentrations of TTX are required to block rNav1.5, rNav1.8, and rNav1.9, the TTX-resistant (TTX-R) sodium channels (3.Goldin A.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

In this regard, TTX is an effective pharmacological agent that has been used to distinguish different mammalian sodium channel isoforms. tetrodotoxin short segment. The pore-forming α-subunit of mammalian voltage-gated sodium channels consists of four homologous domains (I–IV), each of which contains six transmembrane segments (S1–S6) and one reentrant P-region connecting S5–S6 (5.Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 26: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar)(Fig. 1A). In each P-region, the short segments, SS1 and SS2, span the membrane as a hairpin and form the lining of the transmembrane pore (5.Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 26: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). Because TTX physically blocks the pore and prevents sodium conductance, elucidation of the TTX receptor site on sodium channels has been invaluable in elucidating the pore structure of sodium channels. In particular, site-directed mutagenesis of the SS1 and SS2 loops of domains I–IV revealed two motifs, DEKA (Asp-384, Glu-942, Lys-1422, and Ala-1714, located in domains I, II, III, and IV, respectively, of rNav1.2) and EEMD (Glu-387, Glu-945, Met-1425, and Asp-1717, located in domains I, II, III, and IV, respectively, of rNav1.2) as major determinants of the TTX receptor site (6.Noda M.

FEBS Lett. 1991; 293: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Predominantly negatively charged, the residues in the DEKA and EEMD motifs are equivalently positioned in each of the four domains. In combination, the DEKA and EEMD motifs form inner and outer rings of the sodium channel pore, respectively. The DEKA motif also forms the ion selectivity filter (8.Heinemann S.H. Terlau H. Stühmer W. Imoto K. Numa S. Nature. 1992; 356: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, these two motifs are conserved in both TTX-sensitive and TTX-resistant sodium channels. Instead, a non-aromatic residue, cysteine or serine, immediately downstream of the first Glu in the EEMD motif of rNav1.5, rNav1.8, and rNav1.9 channels is responsible for TTX resistance (9.Satin J.

In contrast to the presence of multiple sodium channel genes in vertebrates, invertebrates, such as jellyfish, flatworms, sea anemones, squid, mites, and insects, generally have fewer sodium channel-encoding genes (12.Goldin A.L. J. Exp. Biol. 2002; 205: 575-584PubMed Google Scholar). For example, only one sodium channel gene, para, is found in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (13.Loughney K. Kreber R. Ganetzky B.

Nevertheless, recent studies show that insects, such as D. melanogaster and the German cockroach (Blattella germanica), generate functional diversity of sodium channels by alternative splicing and RNA editing of a single sodium channel gene transcript (16.Dong K.

Characterization of more than 60 sodium channel variants from both D. melanogaster and B. germanica in Xenopus oocytes shows that all of these variants are highly sensitive to TTX (19.Song W. Liu Z.

TTX-insensitive sodium currents, however, have been reported in neurons of two jellyfish species (Cyanea capillata and Polyorchis penicillatus), which are the earliest extant organisms to incorporate a nervous system (21.Anderson P.A. J. Exp. Biol. 1987; 133: 231-248Google Scholar, 22.Meech R.W. Mackie G.O. J. Neurophysiol. 1993; 69: 884-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23.Spafford J. Grigoriev N. Spencer A. J. Exp. Biol. 1996; 199: 941-948PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, TTX-resistant sodium currents have also been detected in neurons of flatworms (Bdelloura candida) (24.Blair K.L. Anderson P.A. J. Exp. Biol. 1993; 185: 267-286Google Scholar) and leeches (Hirudo medicinalis) (25.Kleinhaus A.L. Angstadt J.D. J. Neurobiol. 1995; 27: 419-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Alignment of the SS2 regions from sequenced invertebrate sodium channels reveals that the outer EEMD motif contains intriguing sequence polymorphisms in domains III and IV, but not in domains I and II (Fig. 1B). For instance, the residue corresponding to Met is a phenylalanine (Phe) in the two jellyfish sodium channels, and a threonine (Thr) in several other invertebrate sodium channels including flatworms and leeches (Fig. 1B). It is not known, however, whether the sequence polymorphisms in the EEMD motif of domains III and IV contribute to TTX insensitivity in invertebrate sodium channels. To date, insect voltage-gated sodium channels are the only invertebrate sodium channels that have been functionally expressed in an in vitro expression system, despite reported attempts (26.Spafford J.D. Spencer A.N. Gallin W.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 772-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Robust functional expression of insect sodium channels in Xenopus oocytes requires an accessory subunit, TipE (14.Feng G. Deák P. Chopra M. Hall L.M. Cell. 1995; 82: 1001-1011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been generally assumed that an unidentified accessory subunit like TipE may be required for functional expression of non-insect invertebrate sodium channels in vitro (26.Spafford J.D. Spencer A.N. Gallin W.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 772-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Here, we report the functional expression and characterization of an arachnid sodium channel from the varroa mite (Varroa destructor), an ecto-parasite of the honeybee, in Xenopus oocytes. Interestingly, we found that this arachnid sodium channel is highly resistant to TTX. Site-directed mutagenesis enabled us to identify Thr-1674 and Ser-1967 as the molecular basis of TTX resistance of this sodium channel. Furthermore, sequence comparison and additional amino acid substitutions suggested that sequence polymorphisms in the EEMD motif of domains III and IV may be a widespread mechanism for modulating TTX resistance of sodium channels in invertebrates and possibly also in some vertebrates. We previously reported the cloning and sequencing of the coding region of a sodium channel (VdNav1; formerly called VmNav1) from the varroa mite (V. destructor) (27.Wang R. Huang Z.Y. Dong K. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 33: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To isolate a full-length cDNA clone for functional expression in Xenopus oocytes, the entire coding region was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR using total RNA isolated from a pool of about 1000 adult mites. The primers used in reverse transcription-PCR were oligo(dT)12–18(RT), tagccggaattcgccaccatggcaccggcgcccgccgag (forward primer) and atgtgctctagatttccacagcatcgtctgagc (reverse primer). The PCR product was cloned into pGH19, a Xenopus oocyte expression vector. A full-length clone was isolated and sequenced in the Research Technology Support Facility at Michigan State University. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by PCR using appropriate mutant primers and Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). VdNav1a was generated by deleting a stretch of 24 nucleotides encoding VSIYYFST, homologous to exon B in a cockroach sodium channel, BgNav1-1a (19.Song W. Liu Z. Tan J. Nomura Y. Dong K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32554-32561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), using the same PCR mutagenesis method. All mutagenesis results were verified by DNA sequencing. Procedures for oocyte preparation and cRNA injection were identical to those described previously (28.Tan J. Liu Z. Tsai T.D. Valles S.M. Goldin A.L. Dong K. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The injected oocytes were incubated at 19 °C for 3–7 days before recording. The maximal peak current was limited to <2.0 μA to achieve better voltage control. Methods for electrophysiological recording and data analysis were similar to those described previously (28.Tan J. Liu Z. Tsai T.D. Valles S.M. Goldin A.L. Dong K. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 29.Tan J. Liu Z. Nomura Y. Goldin A.L. Dong K. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5300-5309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The stock solution of TTX (1 mm) was dissolved in distilled water and working solutions were made in ND-96. The effect of TTX on sodium channel peak currents was measured 10 min after toxin application. Sodium currents were recorded by using a standard two-electrode voltage clamp technique. The voltage dependence of activation and fast inactivation were determined using protocols as described previously (28.Tan J. Liu Z. Tsai T.D. Valles S.M. Goldin A.L. Dong K. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 29.Tan J. Liu Z. Nomura Y. Goldin A.L. Dong K. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5300-5309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The data were fitted with a Boltzmann equation to generate V½, the midpoint of the activation or inactivation curves, and k, the slope factor. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test, and significant values were set at p < 0.05 or as indicated in the table and figure legends. Because there is no known accessory subunit identified in arachnids that is equivalent to β-subunits in mammals and TipE in insects, we attempted expression of the mite VdNav1 sodium channel alone by injecting cRNA of VdNav1 (10 ng/oocyte) into Xenopus oocytes. Sodium currents were detected 5–7 days after injection, even though the amplitude of peak current was small (less than 1 μA after 7 days of cRNA injection). Nevertheless, the detected sodium currents were sufficient for functional characterization. The VdNav1 channel activated and inactivated rapidly; a 20-ms depolarization to −10 mV from the holding potential of −120 mV almost completely inactivated the VdNav1 channel with a 5–10% non-inactivating current (Fig. 2A). The sodium channel exhibited steep voltage dependence of activation and fast inactivation (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, a significant overlap between the voltage dependence of activation and inactivation was observed (Fig. 2B and Table 1). At −26 mV, the crossing point of the two curves, about 20% of channels were not inactivated, indicating that these channels have the potential to produce window currents.TABLE 1Voltage dependence of activation and inactivation of wild-type and mutant sodium channelsNa+ channel typeActivationInactivationnV½kV½kmVmVVdNav1−18.23 ± 3.333.58 ± 0.57−29.16 ± 1.724.98 ± 0.575VdNav1a−19.78 ± 2.852.97 ± 0.69−30.58 ± 2.084.47 ± 0.3115VdNav1a + TipE−20.34 ± 1.003.97 ± 0.31−30.04 ± 1.414.52 ± 0.328 Open table in a new tab We previously showed that deletion of an optional exon, exon B, in the first linker connecting domains I and II of the cockroach sodium channel, BgNav1-1, greatly increased the amplitude of peak current (19.Song W. Liu Z. Tan J. Nomura Y. Dong K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32554-32561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The sequence corresponding to exon B is present in VdNav1, although it is not known whether this exon-B-like sequence is also an optional exon in VdNav1. We deleted the exon-B-like sequence from VdNav1, creating the recombinant channel VdNav1a. As shown in Fig. 2C, deletion of the exon-B-like sequence greatly enhanced the peak current amplitude of VdNav1a by nearly 50-fold. However, it did not alter the channel gating properties (see Table 1). Furthermore, we co-expressed VdNav1a with the D. melanogaster tipE cRNA, which facilitates robust expression of insect sodium channels. Unexpectedly, addition of tipE cRNA reduced the expression of VdNav1a currents (Fig. 2C). The concentration of TTX required to completely block the VdNav1 channel was 50 μm, whereas 10 nm TTX was sufficient to block all current from the BgNav1-1a and the Drosophila sodium channel, DmNav1-1 (Fig. 3A). To determine the IC50 of the VdNav1 channel to TTX, we generated a dose-response curve (Fig. 3A). VdNav1 channels are ∼2,000-fold more resistant to TTX than the two insect sodium channels tested (Fig. 3A, Table 2). No difference was observed between VdNav1 and VdNav1a channels in response to TTX (Table 2). Because sodium current expression from VdNav1 was poor, and deletion of the exon B-like sequence did not affect the TTX activity and channel gating properties, we used VdNav1a for all subsequent experiments as presented below. We cannot rule out the possibility that deletion of the exon-B-like sequence has an unknown confounding effect with mutations in the pore-forming regions. However, the exon-B-like sequence is located in the second intracellular loop connecting domains II and III. The possibility of TTX sensitivity modulated by deletion of exon-B seems unlikely.TABLE 2Sensitivity of wild-type and mutant sodium channels to TTXNa+ channel typeIC50, TTXnan, number of oocytes used.μmVdNav11.05 ± 0.285VdNav1a1.45 ± 0.5019T1674I0.12 ± 0.03bStatistically significant difference compared with VdNav1a.

Open table in a new tab To elucidate the molecular basis of TTX resistance, we examined amino acid sequences of the P-regions, including TTX-interacting DEKA and EEMD motifs (see Fig. 1). The DEKA motif is conserved in the VdNav1 channel. However, the EEMD motif is not. Specifically, Met in domain III and Asp in domain IV are substituted with Thr and Ser, respectively. These two substitutions result in an EETS variant motif in the VdNav1 channel, instead of the canonical EEMD motif in mammalian sodium channels or the EEID variant motif in insect sodium channels (see Fig. 1). To determine whether these two amino acid substitutions are responsible for TTX resistance of the VdNav channel, we replaced these residues with the corresponding residues in insect or mammalian sodium channels to produce three single mutation channels, T1674I (insect), T1674M (mammal), and S1967D (both insect and mammal), as well as a double mutant channel T1674I/S1967D. All three single substitutions significantly enhanced mutant channel sensitivity to TTX by about 10-fold (Table 2, Fig. 3B). Furthermore, the double mutant channel was about 400-fold more sensitive to TTX than the VdNav1a channel (Table 2, Fig. 3B). In fact, the level of TTX sensitivity of the double mutant channel is comparable with that of BgNav1-1a and DmNav1-1 (Table 2). These results provide strong evidence that substitution of the TTX-binding residues, methionine (isoleucine in insect sodium channels) and aspartic acid, in the mammalian EEMD motif with threonine and serine, respectively, renders the VdNav channel extremely resistant to TTX. Like VdNav1, jellyfish (CcNav1) and flatworm (BcNav1) sodium channels possess sequence polymorphisms in the EEMD motif (Fig. 1). Specifically, the CcNav1 has a phenylalanine residue instead of methionine in domain III and an asparagine residue instead of aspartic acid in domain IV, resulting in an EEFN variant motif. The flatworm BcNav1 channel also has a threonine in domain III as in VdNav, but a histidine residue instead of aspartic acid in domain IV, giving rise to an EETH variant motif. In addition, an alanine instead of an aspartic acid is found in an ascidian sodium channel (HrNav of Halocynthia roretzi) (30.Nagahora H. Okada T. Yahagi N. Chong J.A. Mandel G. Okamura Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 558-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Our experimental demonstration of TTX resistance in VdNav1a channels caused by sequence polymorphisms in the EEMD motif spurred our interest in examining the role in TTX sensitivity of the sequence polymorphisms identified in other invertebrate sodium channels. The species-specific residues in the EEMD motif variants were introduced into VdNav1a channels by site-directed mutagenesis and the resultant mutant channels were examined for TTX sensitivity. The Thr to Phe substitution at position 1674 (T1674F), as identified in two jellyfish sodium channels, caused a 5-fold increase in TTX resistance compared with the VdNav1a channel (Fig. 3C, Table 2). The Ser to His substitution at position 1967 (S1967H), as present in the flatworm sodium channel, resulted in an extreme level of resistance to TTX. Only 40% of the peak current was inhibited by 100 μm TTX (Fig. 3D), the highest resistance observed in this study. The Ala substitution at position Ser-1967 (S1967A), as found in the ascidian sodium channel, did not alter TTX sensitivity of the VdNav1a channel (Fig. 3D). Finally, the Ser to Asn substitution at position 1967 (S1967N), as in jellyfish sodium channels, increased TTX sensitivity of the VdNav1a channel (Fig. 3D). Most of the amino acid substitutions used in these experiments reduced the amplitude of sodium current, but did not alter sodium channel gating properties (data not shown). Prior to this study, insect sodium channels were the only invertebrate sodium channels that had been successfully expressed in Xenopus oocytes for functional characterization. Functional expression of insect sodium channels in Xenopus oocytes relies largely on co-expression of tipE, which encodes a small transmembrane accessory subunit protein (14.Feng G. Deák P. Chopra M. Hall L.M. Cell. 1995; 82: 1001-1011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). It is generally believed that the inability to functionally express other invertebrate sodium channels in Xenopus oocytes is likely because an unknown accessory subunit that is functionally equivalent to TipE is required. Here, we successfully expressed a non-insect invertebrate sodium channel from the varroa mite in Xenopus oocytes. We found that functional expression of the VdNav1 sodium channel in Xenopus oocytes does not require co-expression of any accessory subunit. Surprisingly, co-expression of the Drosophila TipE with VdNav1 or VdNav1a reduced the amplitude of sodium currents. The possibility that varroa mites express an accessory protein in vivo capable of positively or negatively modulating VdNav expression cannot be ruled out. Our analyses showed that VdNav1 sodium currents exhibited fast activation and inactivation kinetics that are typical of a voltage-gated sodium channel (Fig. 2A). This is not surprising considering that all essential sequences critical for sodium channel function are conserved in VdNav1, including the ion selectivity motif, the positively charged residues in S4 that form the voltage sensors, and the inactivation particle (27.Wang R. Huang Z.Y. Dong K. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 33: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A particularly striking feature of this channel is the apparent potential for window currents due to a significant overlap between the voltage dependence of activation and inactivation. Consequently, VdNav1 channels may generate a sustained sodium flux when the membrane potential is close to −26 mV. Similar window currents have been reported for the rNav1.9 channel (4.Dib-Hajj S. Black J.A. Cummins T.R. Waxman S.G. Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 253-259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and several DmNav variants (20.Olson R.O. Liu Z. Nomura Y. Song W. Dong K. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2008; 38: 604-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition, the VdNav1 channel also exhibits a 5–10% non-inactivating current. Although some invertebrates are well known to possess TTX-R sodium currents (21.Anderson P.A. J. Exp. Biol. 1987; 133: 231-248Google Scholar, 22.Meech R.W. Mackie G.O. J. Neurophysiol. 1993; 69: 884-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23.Spafford J. Grigoriev N. Spencer A. J. Exp. Biol. 1996; 199: 941-948PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Blair K.L. Anderson P.A. J. Exp. Biol. 1993; 185: 267-286Google Scholar, 25.Kleinhaus A.L. Angstadt J.D. J. Neurobiol. 1995; 27: 419-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the molecular bases of TTX resistance are not well understood. This lack of knowledge can be attributed largely to the inability to express invertebrate sodium channels in an in vitro system, such as Xenopus oocytes, for functional characterization. As discussed above, the only functionally characterized invertebrate sodium channels, prior to this study, are insect sodium channels (16.Dong K. Invert. Neurosci. 2007; 7: 17-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 31.Soderlund D.M. Sodium Channel, Comprehensive Molecular Insect Science: Pharmacology.in: Lawrence G. Kostas I. Gillo S. Vol. 5. Elsevier Science Publishers, New York2006: 1-24Google Scholar). However, no TTX-resistant insect sodium channels have been reported. The marked resistance of the VdNav1 channel to TTX therefore offers the first opportunity to investigate the molecular basis of TTX resistance in an invertebrate sodium channel. It appears that specific amino acid substitutions in domains III and IV of the EEMD motif represent a major route of evolution toward TTX resistance in invertebrate species. In particular, a Thr or Phe substitution of Met in the EEMD motif is present in sodium channels from phylogenetically diverse invertebrates: jellyfish, flatworm, slug, leech, tick, and mite. Substitution of Asp with serine in the EEMD motif is found in sodium channels from the varroa mite and the sea slug (Aplysia californica), and an alanine substitution is found in ascidians (30.Nagahora H. Okada T. Yahagi N. Chong J.A. Mandel G. Okamura Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 558-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although it remains to be further verified whether these substitutions affect TTX sensitivity of endogenous sodium channels from the respective invertebrate species, our functional assays using recombinant VdNav1a constructs strongly suggest that sodium channels from these invertebrate species possess various degrees of TTX resistance. Accordingly, characterization of molecular determinants of TTX resistance of the VdNav1a channel likely has uncovered a widespread mechanism for modulating TTX sensitivity in invertebrates. Jellyfish are known to contain TTX-insensitive sodium currents (21.Anderson P.A. J. Exp. Biol. 1987; 133: 231-248Google Scholar, 22.Meech R.W. Mackie G.O. J. Neurophysiol. 1993; 69: 884-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23.Spafford J. Grigoriev N. Spencer A. J. Exp. Biol. 1996; 199: 941-948PubMed Google Scholar). Our analysis of VdNav1a channels incorporating a methionine to phenylalanine substitution in the EEMD motif, as in jellyfish sodium channels, only reduced, but did not abolish, TTX sensitivity. The methionine to phenylalanine substitution does not entirely account for the TTX insensitivity of jellyfish sodium channels, however, suggesting that other amino acid changes or other mechanisms exist for TTX insensitivity. In mammalian sodium channels, the DEKA motif, which forms the selectivity filter, is also important for modulating TTX sensitivity (5.Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 26: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). Neutralization of the Glu residue, charge reversal of Lys, or swapping of Glu and Lys in domains II and III in the DEKA motif renders the rNav1.2 channel extremely resistant to TTX (7.Terlau H. Heinemann S.H. Stühmer W. Pusch M. Conti F. Imoto K. Numa S. FEBS Lett. 1991; 293: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 32.Schlief T. Schönherr R. Imoto K. Heinemann S.H. Eur. Biophys. J. 1996; 25: 75-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Interestingly, two jellyfish sodium channels possess a DKEA motif, instead of the canonical DEKA motif (see Fig. 1). Therefore, it is possible that a combination of the unique DKEA motif and the methionine to phenylalanine substitution in the EEMD motif results in TTX insensitivity of sodium currents in these species. Intriguingly, substitution of Met by Thr in the EEMD motif is also found in several vertebrate sodium channels including two pufferfish sodium channels, fuguNav1.4b and tetNav1.4a, and a human skeletal sodium channel, hNav1.7 (Fig. 4). Previous studies predicted that FuguNav1.4b channels would be TTX sensitive because these channels lack the previously identified TTX-resistant residues in domains I or II, which are found in fuguNav1.4a and tetNav1.4b (33.Venkatesh B. Lu S.Q. Dandona N. See S.L. Brenner S. Soong T.W. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 2069-2072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that fuguNav1.4b and tetNav1.4a sodium channels may be TTX resistant as well. The hNav1.7 channel may be TTX resistant, although rat rNav1.7 channels (the counterpart of hNav1.7) contain a canonical EEMD motif and have been shown to be TTX sensitive. In light of our findings, the TTX sensitivity of fuguNav1.4b, tetNav1.4a, and hNav1.7 need to be examined experimentally. TTX, first isolated from pufferfish species, is found in animals of diverse taxa (34.Soong T.W. Venkatesh B. Trends Genet. 2006; 22: 621-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The widespread detection of TTX-resistant sodium currents and sodium channels in phylogenetically diverse vertebrates and invertebrates suggests the biological and evolutionary importance of TTX resistance. For example, if TTX evolved as a chemical defense against potential predators, we could expect development of TTX resistance in organisms that feed on TTX-bearing food sources. Recent studies of sodium channels in garter snakes, which feed on TTX-bearing newts, illustrate such a scenario (34.Soong T.W. Venkatesh B. Trends Genet. 2006; 22: 621-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 35.Geffeney S. Brodie Jr., E.D. Ruben P.C. Brodie 3rd, E.D.

Nature. 2005; 434: 759-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Several species of newts were found to use TTX to defend against predacious garter snakes. As expected, certain populations of garter snakes that feed on TTX-possessing newts have developed TTX resistance as a result of mutations in the SS2 of domain IV in the outer pore of their skeletal muscle sodium channels (34.Soong T.W. Venkatesh B. Trends Genet. 2006; 22: 621-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 35.Geffeney S. Brodie Jr., E.D. Ruben P.C. Brodie 3rd, E.D. Science. 2002; 297: 1336-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Whereas attractive, the universality of this scenario remains to be determined in other species. Our identification and functional confirmation of additional amino acid substitutions in the EEMD motif associated with TTX resistance should facilitate future studies of potential evolutionary prey-predator relationships in diverse natural populations.

Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6788) Google Scholar). Different Ub modifications serve as signaling-dependent regulators of protein interaction networks (2.Haglund K. Dikic I. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3353-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Substrates that are polyubiquitinated via Lys48 are recognized by the 19 S regulatory particle of the proteasome that consists of a lid and a base complex. Upon recognition, substrates are unfolded by the base complex and hydrolyzed within the 20 S proteolytic chamber (3.Pickart C.M. Cohen R.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar).The COP9 signalosome (CSN) plays an essential role as mediator between signaling pathways and downstream mechanisms controlling developmental processes. This involves ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation of key regulatory molecules like the cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip1, the tumor suppressor p53, and IkBα. The CSN is a highly conserved complex found in all higher eukaryotes (4.Wei N. Deng X.W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 261-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Like the proteasome lid, it contains eight core subunits (CSN1–8), and for each of them exists a paralogous subunit in the proteasome lid. CSN5 (also known as Jab1) and CSN6 possess a MOV34/PAD N-terminal (MPN) domain (5.Huang X. Hetfeld B.K. Seifert U. Kähne T. Kloetzel P.M. Naumann M. Bech-Otschir D. Dubiel W. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 3909-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The MPN domain of CSN5 harbors a metalloprotease motif referred to as the Jab1/MPN domain-associated metallopeptidase (JAMM) motif that regulates the activity of E3 Ub-ligases by deneddylation of the cullin component (6.Ambroggio X.I. Rees D.C. Deshaies R.J. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E2Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar).The chaperone p97 or valosin-containing protein (p97/VCP) has been recognized as another key player within the ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS). p97/VCP extracts mono- or oligoubiquitinated substrates from complexes and presents them to the UPS. It is a member of the family of ATPases associated with various cellular activities (AAA+) and forms a homohexamer. Two AAA cassettes of each monomer build two consecutive stacked rings (D1 and D2 domain) in the hexamer underneath a ring of flexible N-terminal domains (7.Jentsch S. Rumpf S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 6-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Its structure is reminiscent of the proteasome base complex that contains a heterohexameric ring of the AAA+ ATPases Rpt1–6. After extraction of ubiquitinated substrates from larger complexes with the aid of substrate-recruiting cofactors, the segregated proteins can suffer three different fates depending on the involvement of a number of substrate-processing cofactors. They can (i) be polyubiquitinated promoting proteasomal degradation, (ii) stably maintain their ubiquitination status, or (iii) be deubiquitinated and released from the complex (7.Jentsch S. Rumpf S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 6-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar).While investigating the interactome of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) by using stably transfected NIH 3T3 cells expressing MIF that is endogenously tagged with biotin (8.Filip A.M.

To clarify the role of MIF in the UPS, we at first explored the interaction of p97/VCP and CSN5. We discovered that both complexes form an ATP-dependent supercomplex resembling the proteasome-regulatory particle that could serve as a key UPS substrate-processing machine determining substrate fate.DISCUSSIONSpecific interaction of the homohexameric ATPase p97/VCP with subunit CSN5 of the COP9 signalosome and the whole CSN complex was demonstrated by five independent lines of evidence comprising (i) an in vivo interactome screen with biotin-tagged MIF, (ii) in vitro pulldown studies with overexpressed wild type and mutant proteins, (iii) in vivo FRET analyses with ectopically expressed proteins, (iv) biochemical demonstration of an ATP-dependent CSN·p97/VCP complex in composite native gels, and (v) reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous CSN5 and p97/VCP, i.e. without overexpression in vivo. Mapping the interface between CSN5 and p97/VCP by overexpression of wild type and mutant proteins revealed that the ND1 domains of p97/VCP are sufficient for specific binding, but that residues in the second ATPase domain D2 are contributing to binding affinity, which explains why binding of CSN5 to the ND1 protein is weaker than to the wild type protein. Weak binding to the D1D2 protein also shows that direct contacts with both ATPase cassettes are involved.A plethora of cofactors have been described to interact with p97/VCP. Based on their domain structure they can be grouped into proteins with UBX domain and non-UBX proteins (29.Dreveny I. Pye V.E. Beuron F. Briggs L.C. Isaacson R.L. Matthews S.J. McKeown C. Yuan X. Zhang X. Freemont P.S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) or functionally into substrate-recruiting and -processing cofactors of different pathways (7.Jentsch S. Rumpf S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 6-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 30.Schuberth C. Buchberger A. Cell Mol Life Sci. 2008; 65: 2360-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Many cofactors bind to p97/VCP in homo- or heterooligomeric form and use the N domain of p97/VCP as interaction interface (7.Jentsch S. Rumpf S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 6-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Examples are the trimeric ubiquitin regulatory X (UBX)-protein p47 (31.Beuron F. Dreveny I. Yuan X. Pye V.E. McKeown C. Briggs L.C. Cliff M.J. Kaneko Y. Wallis R. Isaacson R.L. Ladbury J.E. Matthews S.J. Kondo H. Zhang X. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1967-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and the ubiquitin fusion degradation1 (Ufd1)-nuclear protein localization 4 (Npl4) heterodimer (32.Bruderer R.M. Brasseur C. Meyer H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49609-49616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the UBX domain containing cofactor UBXD1 binds to the C terminus of p97/VCP with its peptide N-glycanase UBA/UBX (PUB) domain (33.Kern M. Fernandez-Sáiz V. Schäfer Z. Buchberger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 380: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), similar to peptide N-glycanase that binds with its PUB domain (34.Allen M.D. Buchberger A. Bycroft M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25502-25508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) to the C-terminal 10 amino acids of p97/VCP (35.Zhao G. Zhou X. Wang L. Li G. Schindelin H. Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 8785-8790Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).As an ATPase, p97/VCP passes through cycles of ATP binding and hydrolysis. A number of results indicate that ATPase domain D2 is considerably more active in ATP hydrolysis than the D1 domain. Conformational changes caused by ATP hydrolysis mainly in domain D2 are subsequently transmitted to cofactors and substrate molecules (36.Pye V.E. Dreveny I. Briggs L.C. Sands C. Beuron F. Zhang X. Freemont P.S. J Struct Biol. 2006; 156: 12-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). From at least one cofactor, Werner syndrome protein, it is also known that it binds to p97/VCP in an ATP-dependent fashion (37.Indig F.E. Partridge J.J. von Kobbe C. Aladjem M.I. Latterich M. Bohr V.A. J Struct Biol. 2004; 146: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, we conclude that conformational changes in p97/VCP originating from ATP binding and/or hydrolysis are required to enable CSN binding. This also explains why in addition to the important N domain, both ATPase domains are required for efficient binding.Most p97/VCP cofactors use a UBX domain, which folds like ubiquitin, for binding to p97/VCP and a ubiquitin-associated domain that binds to ubiquitin for recruiting ubiquitinated proteins (7.Jentsch S. Rumpf S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 6-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 30.Schuberth C. Buchberger A. Cell Mol Life Sci. 2008; 65: 2360-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Structural analysis of the p97 ND1 domains complexed with the p47 C-terminal domain revealed that the p47 UBX domain interacts with the p97/VCP N domain via a loop that is highly conserved in UBX domains, but is absent in ubiquitin (7.Jentsch S. Rumpf S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 6-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Other cofactors like the peptide N-glycanase use UBX-related domains such as the PUB-domain (35.Zhao G. Zhou X. Wang L. Li G. Schindelin H. Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 8785-8790Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Interestingly, valosin-containing protein/p47 complex-interacting protein p135 (VCIP135), a deubiquitinase (38.Wang Y. Satoh A. Warren G. Meyer H.H. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 973-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), was also shown to interact with p97/VCP (39.Uchiyama K. Jokitalo E. Kano F. Murata M. Zhang X. Canas B. Newman R. Rabouille C. Pappin D. Freemont P. Kondo H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 855-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar).For CSN5, we identified a region containing an MPN domain responsible for interaction with p97/VCP. Part of the MPN domain is the JAMM motif that confers deneddylase activity to the signalosome (6.Ambroggio X.I. Rees D.C. Deshaies R.J. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E2Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Our results show that for binding to p97/VCP, the C-terminal half of the MPN domain (amino acids 110–191) including the catalytic metalloprotease center (JAMM motif) is not sufficient. Also, four amino acid point mutations (CSN5 mutant) that abrogate isopeptidase activity do not interfere with binding. Therefore, the N-terminal half of the MPN domain, the so-called MPN core, and/or the N-terminal 54 residues of CSN5 are mediating binding to p97/VCP.Because at least a large fraction of CSN5 is found in the signalosome (for a detailed discussion, see reference 40.Chamovitz D.A. EMBO Rep. 2009; 10: 352-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and ectopically expressed CSN5 variants and mutants replace the wild type CSN5 within the signalosome (27.Groisman R. Polanowska J. Kuraoka I. Sawada J. Saijo M. Drapkin R. Kisselev A.F. Tanaka K. Nakatani Y. Cell. 2003; 113: 357-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), it cannot be excluded that signalosome subunits other than CSN5 contribute to CSN-p97/VCP interaction.It is known that JAMM motifs can have diverse functions. Whereas the JAMM motif of CSN5 acts as a NEDD8 isopeptidase, the motifs of RPN11 and AMSH function as ubiquitin isopeptidases (41.McCullough J. Clague M.J. Urbé S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Contrary to these enzymatic activities, the JAMM motif of MOV34 is unable to complex a zinc ion and is thought to have primarily a structural role (42.Alves B.S. Oyama Jr., S. Gozzo F.C. Sanches M. Guimarães B.G. Zanchin N.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 347: 608-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) similar to the pre-mRNA splicing factor Prp8p, whose inactive JAMM motif acts as a new ubiquitin binding domain (25.Bellare P. Kutach A.K. Rines A.K. Guthrie C. Sontheimer E.J. RNA. 2006; 12: 292-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).Experiments described by Groisman et al. (27.Groisman R. Polanowska J. Kuraoka I. Sawada J. Saijo M. Drapkin R. Kisselev A.F. Tanaka K. Nakatani Y. Cell. 2003; 113: 357-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar) indicated that in addition to its isopeptidase activity that deconjugates NEDD8 from neddylated cullins, CSN5 could possess an isopetidase activity that deconjugates ubiquitin. Hetfeld et al. (28.Hetfeld B.K. Helfrich A. Kapelari B. Scheel H. Hofmann K. Guterman A. Glickman M. Schade R. Kloetzel P.M. Dubiel W. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1217-1221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) reported that CSN purified from erythrocytes binds gold-Ub(4) particles. But it remained unclear whether binding is mediated by the metalloprotease subunit CSN5 or the associated deubiquitinase USP15. Because CSN5 accumulates in insoluble form when expressed in different systems, we developed a strategy to renature denatured CSN5. Using this approach, we were able to show specific binding of oligoubiquitin to recombinant CSN5, but we could not observe any depolymerizing activity. Thus, our data are in agreement with the results of Groisman et al. (27.Groisman R. Polanowska J. Kuraoka I. Sawada J. Saijo M. Drapkin R. Kisselev A.F. Tanaka K. Nakatani Y. Cell. 2003; 113: 357-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar) and Hetfeld et al. (28.Hetfeld B.K. Helfrich A. Kapelari B. Scheel H. Hofmann K. Guterman A. Glickman M. Schade R. Kloetzel P.M. Dubiel W. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1217-1221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and strengthen the hypothesis that CSN5 binds ubiquitin and could possess deconjugating activity.p97/VCP controls the degree of ubiquitination of bound substrates that are either bound directly or indirectly via a plethora of cofactors. Here, we could show that the CSN interacts with p97/VCP and regulates the amount of polyubiquitinated proteins bound to p97/VCP. When the CSN was inactivated by knock-down of CSN1 or CSN5, the amount of polyubiquitinated proteins bound to p97/VCP increased, indicating that the CSN is required for proper processing of substrate proteins bound to p97/VCP. Because the same effect could be observed when a CSN5 mutant with defective JAMM motif was transfected, we further conclude that a functional isopeptidase activity of CSN5 is required for substrate processing by p97/VCP. Increasing amounts of cullin 1-NEDD8 following CSN5 knock-down revealed that the inactivation of CSN5 was functional and showed expected consequences. By inactivation of the CSN-associated deubiquitinase USP15 (28.Hetfeld B.K. Helfrich A. Kapelari B. Scheel H. Hofmann K. Guterman A. Glickman M. Schade R. Kloetzel P.M. Dubiel W. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1217-1221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), we could demonstrate that USP15 is also involved in the processing of polyubiquitinated substrates bound to p97/VCP.Based on the newly established interaction of CSN and p97/VCP, we propose that CSN and p97/VCP could form a large ATP-dependent oligomeric complex we name CSN regulatory particle in analogy to the proteasome regulatory particle (RP). The analogy is based on pairwise sequence homologies between all CSN and RP lid subunits on the one hand (43.Wei N. Serino G. Deng X.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33: 592-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) and structural homologies between the homohexameric AAA+ ATPase p97/VCP and the AAA+ ATPases Rp1–6 of the RP base that form a heterohexamer on the other hand (44.Elsasser S. Finley D. Nat Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 742-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). This implies that the proteasomal proteins RPN1, 2, and 10 or paralogous proteins could be part of the CSN RP as well. Until recently, p97/VCP was known mainly for its role in endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation. Together with new results showing that p97/VCP associates with all mammalian UBX domain proteins linking it to dozens of E3 ligases and their cytoplasmic substrates (45.Alexandru G. Graumann J. Smith G.T. Kolawa N.J. Fang R. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 2008; 134: 804-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), our results further suggest that not only p97/VCP itself, but the CSN RP plays a global regulatory role in protein turnover. p97/VCP was termed a molecular “gearbox” that in conjunction with substrate-processing cofactors is regulating the ubiquitination status of substrates (7.Jentsch S. Rumpf S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 6-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Based on our findings that the deneddylase activity of CSN5 and the deubiquitinase USP15 are involved in regulating the ubiquitination status of proteins recruited to p97/VCP, we suggest that both activities are decisive for “switching gears.” Other deubiquitinases could also be involved because the CSN is associated with at least two different enzymatic deubiquitinase activities (27.Groisman R. Polanowska J. Kuraoka I. Sawada J. Saijo M. Drapkin R. Kisselev A.F. Tanaka K. Nakatani Y. Cell. 2003; 113: 357-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 28.Hetfeld B.K. Helfrich A. Kapelari B. Scheel H. Hofmann K. Guterman A. Glickman M. Schade R. Kloetzel P.M. Dubiel W. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1217-1221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A further level of control originates from the association of protein kinases CK2 and D with the CSN that potentially could regulate the association of substrate-processing cofactors with p97/VCP through phosphorylation. Therefore, what emerges is the picture of a molecular machine that extracts ubiquitinated and abnormal folded proteins from larger protein complexes or membranes and determines their fate by using the N-terminal domain of p97/VCP and the CSN as a hub for substrate-processing cofactors and regulatory enzymes. Because the interaction of p97/VCP with the CSN originated from an interactome screen for the cytokine MIF, our results also suggest that MIF may not only be involved in regulating the deneddylase activity of CSN5 (46.Nemajerova A. Moll U.M. Petrenko O. Fingerle-Rowson G. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 1030-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), but appears to control the UPS on a much broader scale.

Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6788) Google Scholar). Different Ub modifications serve as signaling-dependent regulators of protein interaction networks (2.Haglund K. Dikic I. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3353-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Substrates that are polyubiquitinated via Lys48 are recognized by the 19 S regulatory particle of the proteasome that consists of a lid and a base complex. Upon recognition, substrates are unfolded by the base complex and hydrolyzed within the 20 S proteolytic chamber (3.Pickart C.M. Cohen R.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar).The COP9 signalosome (CSN) plays an essential role as mediator between signaling pathways and downstream mechanisms controlling developmental processes. This involves ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation of key regulatory molecules like the cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip1, the tumor suppressor p53, and IkBα. The CSN is a highly conserved complex found in all higher eukaryotes (4.Wei N. Deng X.W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 261-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Like the proteasome lid, it contains eight core subunits (CSN1–8), and for each of them exists a paralogous subunit in the proteasome lid. CSN5 (also known as Jab1) and CSN6 possess a MOV34/PAD N-terminal (MPN) domain (5.Huang X. Hetfeld B.K. Seifert U. Kähne T. Kloetzel P.M. Naumann M. Bech-Otschir D. Dubiel W. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 3909-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The MPN domain of CSN5 harbors a metalloprotease motif referred to as the Jab1/MPN domain-associated metallopeptidase (JAMM) motif that regulates the activity of E3 Ub-ligases by deneddylation of the cullin component (6.Ambroggio X.I. Rees D.C. Deshaies R.J. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E2Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar).The chaperone p97 or valosin-containing protein (p97/VCP) has been recognized as another key player within the ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS). p97/VCP extracts mono- or oligoubiquitinated substrates from complexes and presents them to the UPS. It is a member of the family of ATPases associated with various cellular activities (AAA+) and forms a homohexamer. Two AAA cassettes of each monomer build two consecutive stacked rings (D1 and D2 domain) in the hexamer underneath a ring of flexible N-terminal domains (7.Jentsch S. Rumpf S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 6-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Its structure is reminiscent of the proteasome base complex that contains a heterohexameric ring of the AAA+ ATPases Rpt1–6. After extraction of ubiquitinated substrates from larger complexes with the aid of substrate-recruiting cofactors, the segregated proteins can suffer three different fates depending on the involvement of a number of substrate-processing cofactors. They can (i) be polyubiquitinated promoting proteasomal degradation, (ii) stably maintain their ubiquitination status, or (iii) be deubiquitinated and released from the complex (7.Jentsch S. Rumpf S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 6-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar).While investigating the interactome of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) by using stably transfected NIH 3T3 cells expressing MIF that is endogenously tagged with biotin (8.Filip A.M.

Rho GTPases are thought to play important roles in regulating epithelial cell-cell junctions, but their contributions to acinar morphogenesis remain unclear. Here we report that the activity of Rho GTPases is down-regulated in non-malignant MECs in three-dimensional culture with particular suppression of Rac1 and Cdc42. Inducible expression of a constitutively active form of Vav2, a Rho GTPase guanine nucleotide exchange factor activated by receptor tyrosine kinases, in three-dimensional MEC culture activated Rac1 and Cdc42; Vav2 induction from early stages of culture impaired acinar morphogenesis, and induction in preformed acini disrupted the pre-established acinar architecture and led to cellular outgrowths. Knockdown studies demonstrated that Rac1 and Cdc42 mediate the constitutively active Vav2 phenotype, whereas in contrast, RhoA knockdown intensified the Vav2-induced disruption of acini, leading to more aggressive cell outgrowth and branching morphogenesis.

Differentiated epithelia display a polarized architecture that is essential for their functional role as protective barriers and secretory or absorptive surfaces. The polarized epithelial cells associate with each other through lateral cell-cell junctions, which functionally and biochemically segregate the apical surface from the extracellular matrix-contacting basal surface (1Nelson W.J.

Zegers M.M. Mostov K.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). However, linkage of polarity and morphogenesis to oncogenicity has increasingly led to the use of immortalized, non-tumorigenic human epithelial cells. For example, immortalized, non-tumorigenic human mammary epithelial cells (MECs) form basolaterally polarized acinar structures in three-dimensional culture on reconstituted matrices, such as Matrigel (5Bissell M.J. Weaver V.M. Lelievre S.A. Wang F. Petersen O.W. Schmeichel K.L. Cancer Res. 1999; 59 (discussion 1763s–1764s): 1757s-1763sPubMed Google Scholar, 6Debnath J. Brugge J.S. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 675-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). These acini consist of a monolayer of cells surrounding a hollow lumen, which is formed during morphogenesis through the elimination of central cells (6Debnath J. Brugge J.S. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 675-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar, 7Barcellos-Hoff M.H. Aggeler J. Ram T.G. Bissell M.J. Development. 1989; 105: 223-235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MECs in mature acini exhibit basolateral polarity with an integrin-enriched basal surface contacting the extracellular matrix, basolateral E-cadherin-enriched adherens junctions (AJs), and an apical surface enriched in proteins, such as GM130 or Muc1 (7Barcellos-Hoff M.H.

Although the available immortalized and non-tumorigenic MEC lines, such as MCF10A, do not exhibit clear tight junctions, the ease of visualizing MEC architecture in three-dimensional culture has led to their extensive use in analyzing mechanisms of MEC morphogenesis and alterations of these processes during oncogenic transformation. When grown on Matrigel, non-tumorigenic MECs usually cease to proliferate by approximately day 14 to form quiescent, regular acinar structures (10Muthuswamy S.K. Li D. Lelievre S. Bissell M.J. Brugge J.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 785-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 11Debnath J. Muthuswamy S.K. Brugge J.S. Methods. 2003; 30: 256-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar). In contrast, both oncogenically transformed MECs and breast cancer cells fail to form monolayer structures in Matrigel but proliferate continuously to form larger, irregular structures without hollow lumina (5Bissell M.J. Weaver V.M. Lelievre S.A. Wang F. Petersen O.W. Schmeichel K.L. Cancer Res. 1999; 59 (discussion 1763s–1764s): 1757s-1763sPubMed Google Scholar, 12Shaw K.R. Wrobel C.N. Brugge J.S. J.

The transition from acinar to irregular structures provides a relatively easy means of visualizing perturbations in polarity and morphogenesis as a result of alterations in specific biochemical pathways (6Debnath J.

Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family play critical roles in breast cancer tumorigenesis. EGFR overexpression is found in a significant proportion of breast cancers and correlates with increased aggressiveness and poor prognosis (15Nicholson R.I. Gee J.M. Harper M.E. Eur. J.

Chen G. Goswami R. Fernandes N. Gao Q. Dimri G.P. Band V. Band H. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 4164-4172Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), implying that EGFR levels need to be tightly controlled to maintain MEC homeostasis. Notably, EGFR levels are down-regulated during MEC acinar morphogenesis (19Wang F. Weaver V.M. Petersen O.W. Larabell C.A. Dedhar S. Briand P. Lupu R. Bissell M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 14821-14826Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Another EGFR family receptor, ErbB2, also induces irregular acinar structures when overexpressed in MECs (10Muthuswamy S.K. Li D. Lelievre S. Bissell M.J. Brugge J.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 785-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Rho, Rac1, and Cdc42 are small GTPases that cycle between the GTP-bound active form and the GDP-bound inactive form, which are regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins, respectively (20Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). These GTPases control epithelial cell polarity, as demonstrated in both two- and three-dimensional cell culture systems (1Nelson W.J. Nature. 2003; 422: 766-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 21Bryant D.M. Mostov K.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 887-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 22Van Aelst L. Symons M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1032-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Previous work has shown that RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 are required for the establishment of AJs and participate in tight junction formation in model epithelial cells (1Nelson W.J. Nature. 2003; 422: 766-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 23Fujita Y. Braga V. Novartis Found. Symp. 2005; 269 (discussion 155–148, 223–130): 144-155PubMed Google Scholar). In three-dimensional culture, Rac1 and Cdc42 play essential roles in the establishment of apicobasal polarity of MDCK cells (24Martin-Belmonte F. Gassama A. Datta A. Yu W. Rescher U. Gerke V.

Paradoxically, these GTPases also disrupt cell-cell junctions and cell polarity when their constitutively active forms are expressed (26Braga V.M. Betson M. Li X. Lamarche-Vane N. Mol. Biol.

Activation of these GTPases by RTKs is also known to regulate cell-cell junctions (30Takaishi K. Sasaki T. Kotani H. Nishioka H. Takai Y. J.

For example, hepatocyte growth factor stimulation of the c-Met receptor activates Rho and Rac1, which in turn are critical for hepatocyte growth factor-induced loss of cell-cell adhesion and disruption of polarity in MDCK cells (34Takaishi K.

Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In addition, transforming growth factor-β can induce loss of epithelial cell polarity through the ubiquitination and degradation of RhoA (38Ozdamar B. Bose R. Barrios-Rodiles M. Wang H.R. Zhang Y. Wrana J.L. Science. 2005; 307: 1603-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar), and overexpression of constitutively active Rac1 can disrupt AJs (26Braga V.M. Betson M. Li X. Lamarche-Vane N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3703-3721Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Notably, Rho, Rac1, and Cdc42 have been found to be overexpressed in breast cancer tissues, and their overexpression correlates with breast cancer progression (39Fritz G. Brachetti C. Bahlmann F. Schmidt M. Kaina B. Br. J. Cancer. 2002; 87: 635-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Understanding how Rho GTPases are regulated and how they function in controlling mammary epithelial architecture and morphogenesis, especially downstream of RTKs, is of considerable biological importance. Rac1 and Cdc42 activation is associated with the disruption of epithelial polarity downstream of PI3K (27Liu H. Radisky D.C. Wang F. Bissell M.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 28Keely P.J. Westwick J.K. Whitehead I.P. Der C.J. Parise L.V. Nature. 1997; 390: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). RTKs, such as EGFR, activate PI3K in MECs and are often overexpressed in breast cancer cells (40Rajkumar T. Gullick W.J. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1994; 29: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 41Magkou C. Nakopoulou L. Zoubouli C. Karali K. Theohari I. Bakarakos P. Giannopoulou I. Breast Cancer Res. 2008; 10: R49Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 42Khazaie K. Schirrmacher V. Lichtner R.B. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1993; 12: 255-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results imply a role for Rac1- and Cdc42-directed GEFs in the loss of cell polarity in epithelial cells. Among the known Rac1 and Cdc42 GEFs, the Vav family of proteins (Vav1 to -3) are unique in that they directly couple to EGFR and undergo activation through phosphorylation of tyrosine residues located in their N-terminal acidic region (43Hornstein I. Alcover A. Katzav S. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Vav2 is a ubiquitously expressed member of the Vav family. Studies in transfected cells have shown that Vav2 interacts with phosphorylated tyrosine residues on EGFR and is subsequently activated by tyrosine phosphorylation and interaction with PIP3, which is generated by PI3K (44Tamás P. Solti Z. Bauer P. Illés A. Sipeki S. Bauer A. Faragó A. Downward J. Buday L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5163-5171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Although Vav2 was initially characterized as a GEF for Rho, Rac1, and Cdc42 (45Abe K. Rossman K.L. Liu B. Ritola K.D. Chiang D. Campbell S.L. Burridge K. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10141-10149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 46Liu B.P. Burridge K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 7160-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), recent findings suggest that it may predominantly activate Rac1 (47Fernandez-Zapico M.E. Gonzalez-Paz N.C. Weiss E. Savoy D.N. Molina J.R. Fonseca R. Smyrk T.C. Chari S.T. Urrutia R. Billadeau D.D. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 39-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Therefore, Vav2 is a likely candidate to be the Rac1-directed GEF downstream of EGFR and PI3K and a potential participant in the disruption of cell polarity in MECs and breast cancer cells. Although stimulation of EGFR in model cells activates Vav2 and Rho GTPases (46Liu B.P. Burridge K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 7160-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 48Pandey A. Podtelejnikov A.V. Blagoev B. Bustelo X.R. Mann M. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), our previous studies show that MEC lines, such as 16A5 and MCF10A (18Dimri M. Naramura M. Duan L. Chen J. Ortega-Cava C. Chen G. Goswami R. Fernandes N. Gao Q. Dimri G.P. Band V. Band H. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 4164-4172Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), when grown in three-dimensional Matrigel cultures, retain their polarity despite the use of EGF-containing media. Because of this, we considered the possibility that alterations in Rho GTPase signaling machinery during three-dimensional culture may preserve MEC polarity. Because our preliminary data showed that Vav2 is the only Vav family member detected in a number of MECs, we investigated how Vav2 functions within MECs during three-dimensional culture. We found that growing 16A5 MECs in three-dimensional culture results in EGFR down-regulation. The three-dimensional cultured cells showed reduced Vav2 phosphorylation and a decrease in RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 activation in response to EGF stimulation. To test whether or not Vav2 and its downstream Rho GTPases affect MEC morphogenesis and architecture, we created a tetracycline-inducible (Tet-On) 16A5 MEC line in which the expression of a constitutively active Vav2 mutant (Y172F) is under the control of doxycycline (DOX). By inducing active Vav2 expression in combination with shRNA-mediated knockdown of RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42 at different stages of acinar morphogenesis, we show that RhoA and Rac1/Cdc42 play distinct and seemingly opposite roles in the regulation of MEC polarity and morphogenesis. Rabbit anti-Vav2 peptide sera were generated against Vav2 amino acids 208–222 (QETEAKYYRTLEDIE) through a commercial vendor (Animal Pharma Inc.). The monoclonal anti-EGFR (528, ATCC) and anti-E-cadherin (clone E4.6) (49Cepek K.L. Shaw S.K. Parker C.M. Russell G.J. Morrow J.S. Rimm D.L. Brenner M.B.

Michael Brenner and Jonathan Higgins, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA) antibodies were purified from mouse hybridoma supernatants. Purified anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (50Druker B.J.

The following antibodies were commercially obtained: monoclonal anti-RhoA, anti-Rac1, and anti-GM130 (BD Biosciences); anti-Rac1 (Cytoskeleton); anti-β-actin (Sigma); anti-α6 integrin (Chemicon Inc.); and anti-Cdc42 (Cell Signaling). Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated phalloidin used to stain polymerized actin was from Invitrogen. The shRNA sequences specific for the genes of interest were identified using the online S-fold software, subjected to a BLAST search against the NCBI data base to minimize off-target possibilities, and cloned into the pSuper.retro vector (OligoEngine Inc.). The scrambled control nucleotide sequence is AAGAGCATCTCCACCTCTA. The shRNA sequences are as follows: for RhoA, GCAGGTAGAGTTGGCTTTG (sequence 1) and CGACAGCCCTGATAGTTTA (sequence 2); for Rac1, GACACGATCGAGAAACTGA (sequence 1) and GTGAAGAAGAGGAAGAGAA (sequence 2); and for Cdc42, GATAACTCACCACTGTCCA (sequence 3) and ACACAGAAAGGCCTAAAGA (sequence 5). The C-terminally YFP-tagged murine Vav2 cDNA was obtained from the Signaling Consortium (The Signaling Gateway) and subcloned into the pRevTRE vector (Invitrogen) through an engineered SalI site. The 16A5 cell line is an HPV E6/E7-immortalized derivative of the primary MEC line 76N obtained from a normal human mammoplasty specimen (51Band V. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 1249-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). These cells were routinely maintained in two-dimensional culture as described (51Band V. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 1249-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Standard procedures were used to introduce pSuper.retro-based retroviruses into 16A5 cells to generate stable shRNA-expressing lines (18Dimri M. Naramura M. Duan L. Chen J. Ortega-Cava C. Chen G. Goswami R. Fernandes N. Gao Q. Dimri G.P. Band V. Band H. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 4164-4172Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The transductants were selected and maintained in DFCI-1 medium (51Band V. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 1249-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) supplemented with puromycin (0.5 μg/ml) or G418 (500 μg/ml) and used as polyclonal cell lines. The 16A5-Tet-On cell line is a clone of the 16A5 cell line infected with pRev-Tet-On vector (Invitrogen) and selected in G418 for maximal induction of transfected genes. For three-dimensional Matrigel culture, 2.5 × 103 cells in 0.4 ml of 2% reduced growth factor Matrigel (BD Biosciences) were added to DFCI-1 medium containing 3 ng/ml EGF and plated in a 60-mm plate onto a polymerized layer of 100% Matrigel, as described previously (11Debnath J. Muthuswamy S.K. Brugge J.S. Methods. 2003; 30: 256-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar). Fresh medium was added to the cells every 2 days. Phase-contrast images were obtained at the indicated time points. For EGF stimulation, cells were grown for 3 days in DFCI-1 medium without EGF; EGF was then added at 100 ng/ml at the indicated time points before cell lysis. Bacterially expressed and purified GST-RBD (Rho-binding domain of rhotekin; interacts with activated GTP-bound RhoA) or GST-PBD (p21-binding domain of Pak1; interacts with activated GTP-bound Rac1 and Cdc42) was used to pull-down GTP-bound forms of RhoA or Rac1 and Cdc42, respectively, as described previously (52Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar, 53Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional cultured 16A5 MECs were washed with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 μg each of leupeptin and aprotinin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Three-dimensional cultured cells were lysed in the same buffer by scraping the Matrigel-cell mixture from the plates. Cell lysates were rocked at 4 °C for 10 min and cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min to remove the insoluble fraction and Matrigel. Equal aliquots of lysates were incubated with 20–30 μg of purified GST-RBD or GST-PBD immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 45 min. The beads were washed four times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Bound RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42 protein was detected by Western blotting for RhoA (catalog number 26C4, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA)), Rac1 (catalog number ARC03, Cytoskeleton), or Cdc42 (catalog number 2462, Cell Signaling). For immunofluorescence analysis, the three-dimensional cultures were prepared in 8-well chamber slides (BD Biosciences). The acinar structures were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, phosphate-buffered saline on the indicated days, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and stained with anti-E-cadherin, anti-GM130, or anti-α6 integrin primary antibodies. This was followed either with Alexa Fluor 488- or Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibodies and DAPI or Topro-3 (Molecular Probes) or with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated phalloidin. The slides were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Images were acquired with a Nikon C1 or a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope under ×400 or ×600 magnification. All images represent the central plane of the acini using 0.5-μm-thick optical sections. One-way analysis of variance and Student's t test were used to determine the statistical significance of differences in loss of polarity between 16A5-Tet-On-172F cells expressing control shRNA versus RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42 shRNAs. We have previously shown that the immortalized, non-malignant 16A5 MEC line resembles the MCF10A MEC line in forming basolaterally polarized acini in three-dimensional Matrigel culture (18Dimri M. Naramura M. Duan L. Chen J. Ortega-Cava C. Chen G. Goswami R. Fernandes N. Gao Q. Dimri G.P. Band V. Band H. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 4164-4172Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) with relatively nondescript tight junctions, as observed with zona occludens-1 staining (data not shown). However, these structures are sensitive to the levels of EGFR; overexpression of EGFR induced abnormal structures in a significant proportion of acini (18Dimri M. Naramura M. Duan L. Chen J. Ortega-Cava C. Chen G. Goswami R. Fernandes N. Gao Q. Dimri G.P. Band V. Band H. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 4164-4172Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that controlled EGFR signaling via downstream activation of Rho GTPases may be critical for the maintenance of acinar integrity. EGF stimulation indeed activated Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA in two-dimensional culture, but surprisingly we found that EGF stimulation did not result in Rac1 and Cdc42 activation, whereas RhoA was weakly activated in three-dimensional as compared with two-dimensional cultures (Fig. 1, A–D). This result was confirmed in three independent experiments. We reasoned that differential EGFR levels in two-dimensional versus three-dimensional may account for this difference. To test if EGFR was indeed down-regulated in three-dimensional cultures of 16A5 cells, we compared EGFR protein levels in 16A5 MECs grown in two-dimensional versus three-dimensional culture. Western blotting (Fig. 1E, top) and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis (25–30% lower mean fluorescence intensity; data not shown) showed that EGFR was indeed substantially down-regulated in three-dimensional culture (the latter was assessed when acini were fully formed; day 14). Furthermore, EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR was markedly decreased in three-dimensional compared with two-dimensional cultured cells (Fig. 1E, middle). These results reveal that the EGFR-signaling pathway is differentially regulated in two-dimensional versus three-dimensional cultures (19Wang F. Weaver V.M. Petersen O.W. Larabell C.A. Dedhar S.

Because EGFR is known to activate Rac1 and Cdc42 through Vav2 (44Tamás P. Solti Z. Bauer P. Illés A. Sipeki S. Bauer A. Faragó A. Downward J. Buday L. J. Biol.

Radisky D.C. Wang F. Bissell M.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), we examined Vav2 phosphorylation in response to EGF stimulation in two-dimensional versus three-dimensional cultured cells. Consistent with reduced EGFR activation, Vav2 phosphorylation in response to EGF was significantly lower in three-dimensional versus two-dimensional cultured cells despite similar protein levels (Fig. 1E). Thus, attainment of polarity in three-dimensional MEC culture is associated with EGFR down-regulation and reduced Vav2 activation, which is accompanied by a relatively selective blunting of EGF-induced Rac/Cdc42 but not RhoA activation. The correlative findings above suggested that Vav2, whose phosphorylation was reduced in three-dimensional culture in conjunction with reduced Rac/Cdc42 activity, could serve as an important driver of Rac1 and Cdc42 activation in MECs. To assess if this was indeed the case, we generated a Tet-On 16A5 cell line (16A5-Tet-On-172F) in which the expression of YFP-tagged, constitutively active Vav2 mutant (Vav2-Y172F) is DOX-inducible. DOX-induced expression of Vav2-Y172F in 16A5-Tet-On-172F cells grown in two-dimensional culture for 3 days led to increased levels of active Rac1 and Cdc42 but not of RhoA ("
https://openalex.org/W1970499039,"Background Dengue virus infection is a growing global public health concern in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Dengue vaccine development has been hampered by concerns that cross-reactive immunological memory elicited by a candidate vaccine could increase the risk of development of more severe clinical forms. One possible strategy to reduce risks associated with a dengue vaccine is the development of a vaccine composed of selected critical epitopes of each of the serotypes. Methodology/Principal Findings Synthetic peptides were used to identify B-cell epitopes in the envelope (E) glycoprotein of dengue virus type 3 (DENV-3). Eleven linear, immunodominant epitopes distributed in five regions at amino acid (aa) positions: 51–65, 71–90, 131–170, 196–210 and 246–260 were identified by employing an enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using a pool of human sera from dengue type 3 infected individuals. Peptides 11 (aa51–65), 27 and 28 (aa131–150) also reacted with dengue 1 (DENV-1) and dengue 2 (DENV-2) patient sera as analyzed through the ROC curves generated for each peptide by ELISA and might have serotype specific diagnostic potential. Mice immunized against each one of the five immunogenic regions showed epitopes 51–65, 131–170, 196–210 and 246–260 elicited the highest antibody response and epitopes131–170, 196–210 and 246–260, elicited IFN-γ production and T CD4+ cell response, as evaluated by ELISA and ELISPOT assays respectively. Conclusions/Significance Our study identified several useful immunodominant IgG-specific epitopes on the envelope of DENV-3. They are important tools for understanding the mechanisms involved in antibody dependent enhancement and immunity. If proven protective and safe, in conjunction with others well-documented epitopes, they might be included into a candidate epitope-based vaccine."

KL28 and belongs to the superfamily of type I extradiol dioxygenases. In this study, the crystal structures of substrate-free LapB and its complexes with a substrate or product were determined, along with a functional analysis of the active site residues. Structural features of the homotetramer are similar to those of other type I extradiol dioxygenases. In particular, the active site is located in the C-domain of each monomer, with a 2-His-1-carboxylate motif as the first coordination shell to iron ion. A comparison of three different structures in the catalytic cycle indicated catalysis-related local conformational changes in the active site. Specifically, the active site loop containing His-248 exhibits positional changes upon binding of the substrate and establishes a hydrogen-bonding network with Tyr-257, which is near the hydroxyl group of the substrate. Kinetic analysis of the mutant enzymes H248A, H248N, and Y257F showed that these three mutant enzymes are inactive, suggesting that this hydrogen-bonding network plays a crucial role in catalysis by deprotonating the incoming substrate and leaving it in a monoanionic state. Additional functional analysis of His-201, by using H201A and H201N mutants, near the dioxygen-binding site also supports its role as base and acid catalyst in the late stage of catalysis. We also noticed a disordered-to-ordered structural transition in the C-terminal region, resulting in the opening or closing of the active site.

These results provide detailed insights into the structural and functional features of an extradiol dioxygenase that can accommodate a wide range of alkylcatechols. Non-heme iron-dependent dioxygenases constitute one group of enzymes involved in bacterial biodegradation pathways of aromatic compounds (1.Vaillancourt F.H. Bolin J.T. Eltis L.D. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2006; 41: 241-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In general, chemically stable aromatic compounds are initially subject to hydroxylation by enzymes in the pathway, producing aromatic compounds with vicinal diols. Subsequently, under aerobic conditions, dioxygenase catalyzes a ring cleavage of the catecholic compound by activating and incorporating molecular dioxygen into the substrate. The ring-opened product is further degraded in the pathway, and the resulting final compound is used as the nutrition source for microorganisms via the citric acid cycle. Enzymes are classified according to their mode of ring cleavage as intradiol and extradiol dioxygenases, which are distinct both in their sequences and structures as well as in their reaction mechanisms (1.Vaillancourt F.H. Bolin J.T. Eltis L.D. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2006; 41: 241-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 2.Bugg T.D. Ramaswamy S. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2008; 12: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Although some enzymes utilize Mn(II), extradiol dioxygenases primarily utilize Fe(II) as a cofactor without changes in its redox state during catalysis (3.Emerson J.P. Kovaleva E.G. Farquhar E.R. Lipscomb J.D. Que Jr., L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 7347-7352Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and cleave the meta-position to the hydroxyl groups to produce muconic semialdehyde adducts (Scheme 1) (4.Lipscomb J.D. Curr.

Structural classification indicates that extradiol dioxygenases comprise three superfamilies (2.Bugg T.D. Ramaswamy S. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2008; 12: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Among these, type I enzymes contain a common structural domain that is composed of two repeated βαβββ motifs; structural analysis revealed that these enzymes exhibit various oligomeric states (1.Vaillancourt F.H. Bolin J.T. Eltis L.D. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2006; 41: 241-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In addition, type I enzymes share similar structural features in the active site, with two histidines and one glutamate conserved in the metal-binding site. Various spectroscopic and computational analyses have suggested the identity of the putative intermediates in the catalytic cycle (6.Siegbahn P.E. Haeffner F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 8919-8932Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 7.Kovaleva E.G. Neibergall M.B. Chakrabarty S. Lipscomb J.D. Acc. Chem. Res. 2007; 40: 475-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In particular, an alkylperoxo intermediate was proposed to yield a lactone intermediate via Criegee rearrangement, but previous crystallographic studies of extradiol dioxygenases revealed only the binding mode of a substrate and/or O2 molecule in the active site. Only recently, the first structural evidence for the long searched for alkylperoxo intermediate (8.Kovaleva E.G. Lipscomb J.D. Science. 2007; 316: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), the O–O bond cleavage (9.Kovaleva E.G. Lipscomb J.D.

In this homotetrameric dioxygenase, four independent subunits form one asymmetric unit of crystal and thus have different crystal packings in each subunit. Due to these unique crystalline environments, each subunit contains different intermediates in the reaction mechanism when a slow substrate and a limiting amount of O2 are introduced into a crystalline enzyme. homoprotocatechuate 2,3-dioxygenase long-chain alkylphenol 4-methylcatechol 3-methylcatechol root mean square deviation. LapB is a catechol 2,3-dioxygenase that catalyzes the second step of a long-chain alkylphenol (lap) degradation pathway in Pseudomonas sp. KL28, which can utilize 4-n-alkylphenols (C1–C5) as growth substrates (10.Jeong J.J. Kim J.H. Kim C.K. Hwang I. Lee K. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 3265-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Phenols with bulky alkyl group(s) are commonly found in aquatic environments and have been known to cause adverse effects such as developmental and reproductive toxicity in animals (11.Giger W. Brunner P.H. Schaffner C. Science. 1984; 225: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 12.Sharpe R.M. Fisher J.S. Millar M.M. Jobling S. Sumpter J.P. Environ. Health Perspect. 1995; 103: 1136-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The product analysis of LapB and its sequence alignment with other dioxygenases (see Fig. 1A) suggest that LapB belongs to the type I superfamily of extradiol dioxygenases, with a substrate preference for 4- or 3-methylcatechol (4MC and 3MC, respectively) (2.Bugg T.D. Ramaswamy S. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2008; 12: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 10.Jeong J.J. Kim J.H. Kim C.K. Hwang I. Lee K. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 3265-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To better understand the structural and functional features of LapB, we determined the crystal structure of LapB in a substrate-free form, a substrate-bound form, and a product-bound form, and we conducted a functional analysis of the active site residues. These results provide insight into the ligand-induced conformational changes in the active site and the functional role of the hydrogen-bonding networks involving Tyr-257 and His-248, which are conserved among type I enzymes, in the active site. For the expression of the C-terminal His-tagged LapB protein, the gene for LapB (927 bp) from Pseudomonas sp. KL28 (Korean Collection for Type Cultures 22206) was generated by PCR using a pair of primers (forward primer, 5′-GCAGATATACATATGGCGATGACAGGTGTATTGCG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-AATTCGGATCCGGTCACAACGGTCATGAAGG-3′) including an NdeI site in the forward primer and a BamHI site in the reverse primer (underlined). The resulting amplified PCR product was subcloned into the corresponding restriction sites of the pET28 vector (Novagen) containing six histidine residues at the C terminus, and the construct verified by DNA sequencing was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (Stratagene). Transformed cells were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 50 μm kanamycin to an A600 of 0.8–1.0 and induced for 7 h at 28 °C with the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and sonicated in buffer A (50 mm NaH2PO4, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.5). The resulting His-tagged LapB protein was purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography with a solution of buffer A plus 500 mm imidazole. The eluted protein was pooled based on SDS-PAGE analysis and dialyzed against buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) was subsequently performed with buffer B. In this step, LapB was estimated to form a tetramer in solution and concentrated to ∼10 mg/ml for crystallization screening. Initial crystallization using the purified C-terminal His-tagged LapB was carried out using a sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method at 22 °C. Typically, each drop was prepared by mixing 2 μl of the protein solution containing an additional 1 mm Fe(II)(NH4)2(SO4)2 with 2 μl of the reservoir solution. Crystals of LapB with a long rod-like appearance were produced in a crystallization buffer of 0.2 m ammonium fluoride and 20% polyethylene glycol 3350. Subsequently, crystallization conditions were optimized to 0.2 m ammonium fluoride and 12–14% polyethylene glycol 3350. The complex of LapB with substrate was achieved by a soaking experiment, in which crystals of LapB were soaked with 5 mm concentrations of the ligands 3MC or 4MC. Although the presence of Fe(II) is crucial to forming the crystal, we were not able to assess the redox state of the iron ion in the crystal structures. Given that crystallization and soaking experiments were carried out under aerobic conditions, iron ion is likely to be substantially oxidized into the ferric state. Single wavelength data for the native crystal of LapB and its complexes with 3MC and 4MC were collected at resolutions of 2.3, 2.0, and 1.94 Å, respectively, at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (Pohang, Korea) on beamlines 4A and 6C. Crystals were soaked in a cryoprotectant solution containing a crystallization solution, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and if necessary, additional 3MC or 4MC for formation of the complex. The collected data were indexed and scaled using HKL2000 (13.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38430) Google Scholar). Detailed data for the native crystal and the complexes are shown in Table 1. The space groups of the native and complex structures were P212121, with four monomers in an asymmetric unit.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement for LapB and its complex with a substrate or productLapBaResidue ranges: substrate-free LapB, subunit A (Ala-2–Arg-298) and subunits B, C and D (Ala-2–Phe-289); LapB-4-methylcatechol, subunits A and B (Ala-2–Phe-289), and subunits C and D (Ala-2–Gln-297); LapB-3-methylcatechol, subunit A (Ala-2–Arg-298), subunits B and D (Ala-2–Phe-289), and subunit C (Ala-2–Gln-297).LapB-4-methylcatecholaResidue ranges: substrate-free LapB, subunit A (Ala-2–Arg-298) and subunits B, C and D (Ala-2–Phe-289); LapB-4-methylcatechol, subunits A and B (Ala-2–Phe-289), and subunits C and D (Ala-2–Gln-297); LapB-3-methylcatechol, subunit A (Ala-2–Arg-298), subunits B and D (Ala-2–Phe-289), and subunit C (Ala-2–Gln-297).LapB-3-methylcatecholaResidue ranges: substrate-free LapB, subunit A (Ala-2–Arg-298) and subunits B, C and D (Ala-2–Phe-289); LapB-4-methylcatechol, subunits A and B (Ala-2–Phe-289), and subunits C and D (Ala-2–Gln-297); LapB-3-methylcatechol, subunit A (Ala-2–Arg-298), subunits B and D (Ala-2–Phe-289), and subunit C (Ala-2–Gln-297).Data collectionWavelength (Å)1.239831.239851.00000Ligand (mm)55Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)94.9, 97.0, 133.496.1, 97.6, 133.795.9, 97.4, 133.5α, β, γ (deg)90.0, 90.0, 90.090.0, 90.0, 90.090.0, 90.0, 90.0Resolution (Å)50.0-2.3 (2.38-2.30)bNumbers in parentheses refer to data in the highest resolution shell.50.0-1.94 (2.01-1.94)50.0-2.0 (2.07-2.00)Unique reflections55,66093,77485,226Completeness (%)99.9 (99.4)99.9 (100.0)100.0 (100.0)Redundancy13.011.57.7I/σ (I)23.2 (3.6)35.9 (2.7)18.8 (3.2)Rsym (%)cRsym = Σ|Ih − <Ih>|/ΣIh, where Ih is the observed intensity and <Ih> is the average intensity.11.9 (65.2)7.1 (75.4)11.1 (57.6)RefinementResolution (Å)50.0-2.350.0-1.9450.0-2.0No. of reflectionsWorking set/test set42,020/4,72173,387/8,16964,010/7,191Rwork (%)dRwork = Σ‖Fobs|-k|Fcal‖/Σ|Fobs|; Rfree was calculated using 10% of the data excluded from refinement.20.124.422.2Rfree (%)dRwork = Σ‖Fobs|-k|Fcal‖/Σ|Fobs|; Rfree was calculated using 10% of the data excluded from refinement.26.927.826.9r.m.s.d. from ideal geometryBond lengths (Å)0.0093050.0121340.006015Bond angles (degrees)1.610741.885041.39185Average B-factor (Å2)30.430.426.9No. of moleculesProtein atoms9,2779,3289,399Water atoms332351409Ligand atoms3833Ramachandran analysisMost favored/allowed (%)85.2/14.887.3/12.787.8/12.2Disallowed (%)000a Residue ranges: substrate-free LapB, subunit A (Ala-2–Arg-298) and subunits B, C and D (Ala-2–Phe-289); LapB-4-methylcatechol, subunits A and B (Ala-2–Phe-289), and subunits C and D (Ala-2–Gln-297); LapB-3-methylcatechol, subunit A (Ala-2–Arg-298), subunits B and D (Ala-2–Phe-289), and subunit C (Ala-2–Gln-297).b Numbers in parentheses refer to data in the highest resolution shell.c Rsym = Σ|Ih − <Ih>|/ΣIh, where Ih is the observed intensity and <Ih> is the average intensity.d Rwork = Σ‖Fobs|-k|Fcal‖/Σ|Fobs|; Rfree was calculated using 10% of the data excluded from refinement.

Ishida T. Horiike K. Nozaki M. Miki K. Structure. 1999; 7: 25-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar)) from Pseudomonas putida as a search model. The initial model generated through molecular replacement was further improved by a series of simulated annealing omit maps using CNS, and the resulting map was sufficiently clear to trace most of the residues in four monomers except for those in the disordered C-terminal region (Table 1). Manual model building was accomplished using the model-building program O (16.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13005) Google Scholar), and refinement was carried out with CNS. During refinement, we noticed in each subunit a single outstanding density in the Fo − Fc map greater than 5 σ. Based on the distance and geometry of this density relative to the nearby residues, we concluded that this density corresponds to the binding site for the iron ion. The structures of LapB complexed with a ligand were determined using the final model of native LapB as the starting model and subjecting it to refinement with CNS. For the complex with 4MC, a density for 4MC was observed in three subunits (subunits A, B, and C); a model for 4MC was not included in subunit D due to its highly disordered density. In the structure of the 3MC complex, its product, 2-hydroxy-6-oxohepta-2,4-dienoic acid, was observed in the active site of three subunits (subunits B, C, and D), whereas no density was observed in subunit A. Therefore, LapB complexed with 4MC or 3MC represents a substrate- or product-bound enzyme, respectively. An additional structural feature of the complex is the structural transition of the C-terminal residues from a disordered to an ordered state. In particular, residues 290–298, which were disordered in the substrate-free form, became ordered in subunits C and D of the LapB-4MC complex and in subunit C of the LapB-product complex (Table 1). The stereochemistry of each final model was checked using the PROCHECK program (17.Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19726) Google Scholar). Neither the native LapB nor its complexes had residues in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot. The figures were prepared using PyMOL (27.DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific LLC, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar), and the structural analysis was executed using the CCP4 program suite (17.Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19726) Google Scholar). To investigate the functional role of the active site residues, three residues, His-201, His-248, and Tyr-257 (see below), were mutated by site-directed mutagenesis. Five mutant enzymes, H201A, H201N, H248A, H248N, and Y257F, were generated using two rounds of PCR. In the first round of PCR, the mutagenic oligonucleotide for the forward primer was 5′- CTCGCACAAGGTTGCTGACATCGCCTTCG-3′ for the mutant H201A, 5′-CTCGCACAAGGTTAATGACATCGCCTTCG-3′ for the mutant H201N, 5′-CGGTCCAACCCGTGCCGGCGTGACTCGCG-3′ for the mutant H248A, 5′- AACGTGGACATCGGTCCAACCCGTAATGGCGTG-3′ for the mutant H248N, and 5′-GGCGTGACTCGCGGTTGCACCATCTTTGCGTGG-3′ for the mutant Y257F. The underlined sequence indicates the mutation site. These forward primers for each mutation were used with the reverse primer (5′-CGCGGATCCGGTCACAACGGTCATGAAGG-3′) for the C terminus, which included a BamHI site (underlined). The resulting PCR product from the first round of PCR was used as the reverse primer in the second round of PCR, in which an oligonucleotide of 5′-GGAATTCCATATGGCGATGACAGGTGTATTG-3′ for the N terminus, which included an NdeI site (underlined), was used as a forward primer. Each mutant LapB was expressed as described above for the wild-type enzyme, and the purified enzyme was concentrated to ∼1.0 mg/ml in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5). All mutant enzymes were essentially identical with the wild-type enzyme in their folding and tetramerization (data not shown). Enzyme assays were performed at 25 °C using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Jasco V-560). The 2-ml reaction mixture contained 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 80 mm NaCl, 4 μm dithiothreitol, 0.4 μm Fe(II)(NH4)2(SO4)2, 0.114 μm LapB protein, and the substrate 4MC or 3MC (0.5–100 μm). Specifically, enzymes were first incubated for 3 min in the absence of substrate, and the reaction was then initiated by the addition of the substrate. Product formation was monitored as a function of time at its characteristic absorption wavelength of 382 nm with its molar extinction coefficient of 28,100 m−1cm−1 for 4MC as a substrate and of 384 nm with its molar extinction coefficient 13,400 m−1cm−1 for 3MC as a substrate (18.Viggiani A.

Kitamura C. Kato D. Negoro S. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2007; 104: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The initial velocity of the reaction was measured during the first 30 s, and kinetic parameters were determined using a Lineweaver-Burk plot constructed using SigmaPlot. The kcat was calculated using a monomer of 35,080 daltons as the molecular mass of the enzyme. The catechol 2,3-dioxygenase LapB is composed of 309 amino acids. The overall structure of LapB in the absence of ligand shows a tetrameric arrangement into an asymmetric unit with non-crystallographic 222 symmetry (Fig. 1B), which is consistent with the chromatographic observation that LapB exists as a tetramer in solution. Therefore, this arrangement of tetramers forming an asymmetric unit is likely to be the functional tetrameric unit in solution. Superposition of all Cα atoms between monomers exhibits root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) less than 0.5 Å, suggesting that the four subunits are structurally identical to one another. Each subunit consists of six α-helices and 16 β-strands that fold into the four repeated βαβββ motifs (Fig. 1, A and C). A short helix α3 and the C-terminal helix α6 are the exception to this motif. From a structural perspective, the monomeric structure can be divided into two domains that are highly homologous in structure: an N-domain (residues 1–149) and a C-domain (residues 150–309). Specifically, there are two repeated βαβββ motifs in each domain: β1-α1-β2-β3-β4 and β5-α2-β6-β7-β8 in the N-domain and β9-α4-β10-β11-β12 and β13-α5-β14-β15-β16 in the C-domain. The two motifs in each domain are arranged in a manner such that the first β-strands in each βαβββ motif (β1 and β5 in the N-domain, β9 and β13 in the C-domain) are antiparallel to each other, resulting in an extended eight-stranded, concave β-sheet. These structural features are observed in both domains, which are related by a r.m.s.d. of 1.61 Å for 116 matched Cα atoms. The eight β-strands and nearby loops are arranged in such a way that they generate a funnel-like cavity in the concave side of each domain (Fig. 1C). Unlike the N-domain, in which the funnel is sealed off by the side chains, there are two openings in the C-domain. Specifically, one end of the funnel remains open toward the intersubunit interface, but the tetramerization of four subunits essentially blocks this opening. The other end of the funnel connects the active site (see below) to the surface of the molecule. This putative substrate-binding channel adopts a closed conformation in subunit A and an open conformation in the other three subunits. These different structural features are due to the orientation of nine extra residues, Ala-290 to Arg-298, in the C terminus, which are ordered only in subunit A (Fig. 1B). Crystal contact analysis using the program CONTACT in the CCP4 suite indicated that residues Tyr-295, Pro-296, and Gln-297 in the C-terminal region of subunit A are involved in intermolecular crystal packing with residues Glu-210, Pro-209, and Tyr-208 in a loop between β12 and β13 of the crystallographic symmetry-related subunit C, at a distance of 3.5–5.0 Å, whereas no crystal contacts were observed in the C-terminal residues of the other three subunits. Therefore, the closed conformation of the active site in subunit A in substrate-free LapB is mainly due to crystal packing. The location of the active site was unambiguously suggested by the presence of a metal-binding site in the C-domain (Fig. 1, C and D). The active site is situated deep in the interior of the cavity of the C-domain. Specifically, the metal-binding site possibly occupied by the iron ion was located at the concave β-sheet and ligated with His-154, His-216 (not shown in this orientation of Fig. 1D), Glu-267, and a water molecule, all within a distance of 2.3 Å. Each subunit contacts the other three subunits via two different interfaces, the dimeric and the tetrameric (Fig. 2). Interface residues are identified as those interacting with each other within 4.0 Å via hydrogen bonds or van der Waals interactions using the program CONTACT, and their surface area was calculated using the AREAIMOL program within the CCP4 suite (17.Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19726) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows the dimeric interface between subunits A and D, which are related by a non-crystallographic two-fold symmetry. Dimerization of A and D or B and C resulted in buried surface areas of 3,967 and 4,090 Å2, respectively. Most of the residues in the dimeric interface are located in the loop regions (Fig. 1A, filled triangles) and mediate a total of 27 hydrogen bonds and a number of van der Waals interactions at each interface. In particular, the protruding long loop between β8 and α3 in the N-domain has extensive intersubunit interactions with the loop connecting the last β-strand β16 and α6 of the C-domain in the adjacent subunit. Specifically, those contacts are mediated by the main-chain carbonyl oxygen atoms and side chains of Glu-133, Asn-135, and Ala-137 in the protruding loop of one particular subunit and the backbone nitrogen atoms and side chains of Ser-283, Thr-285, and Arg-252 in the interacting subunit. The His-198 residues from both subunits are located at the center of the dimeric interface, with their side chains stacked against each other. The structural environment of the dimeric interface between B and C is essentially identical to those described here for the dimer A and D. The tetrameric interface, which is defined as the interface formed by the two dimers A-D and B-C, exhibits more extensive interactions. Its buried surface area was calculated to be about 11,786 Å2, providing the structural stability of the tetrameric LapB. Fig. 2B shows the tetrameric interface, along with the interacting residues. For example, the residues participating in tetrameric interactions are those in α5, including residues Ser-223, Trp-224, Glu-225, Arg-229, and Asp-232, and additional residues Trp-139, Glu-144, and Arg-247 (Fig. 1A, asterisks). These residues interact by hydrogen bonds with Asp-232 and Arg-229 in another dimer. None of the dimeric or tetrameric interface residues had dual roles. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” the substrate 4MC was bound in the active site of the LapB-4MC complex, whereas 2-hydroxy-6-oxohepta-2,4-dienoic acid, a 3MC product generated via a proximal cleavage by LapB, was identified in the active site of the complex with 3MC. Therefore, three different intermediates in the catalytic cycle of extradiol dioxygenation are described in this work, including a substrate-free LapB, the LapB-substrate complex, and the LapB-product complex. Structural superposition using CCP4 Molecular Graphics (17.Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19726) Google Scholar) indicated that the tetrameric structures of the substrate-free form and the complex are essentially identical, with r.m.s.d. values of 0.43 and 0.32 Å for all Cα atoms in the complex with 4MC and product, respectively. Even in the absence of large scale structural changes, some noticeable structural changes in the vicinity of the active site occur with the binding of a substrate or a product. Fig. 3 shows structural features of the active site for the substrate-free LapB and its complexes. In the absence of substrate, cofactor iron ion forms a square pyramidal coordination with two histidine residues (His-154 and His-216), one glutamate (Glu-267), and 2–3 water molecules, depending on subunit (Fig. 3A). In particular, all of the coordinating ligands in the first coordination shell are within 2.2 Å of iron ion, with Glu-267 in the axial position. The possible sixth coordination site at the axial position across from Glu-267 remains vacant or occupied with water molecules in substrate-free LapB and is likely the dioxygen-binding site. These metal-ligating residues (i.e. His-154 and Glu-267) also form hydrogen bonds to adjacent residues, including Asp-153, Ser-218, and Thr-255. In the"

A deeper understanding of pathways downstream of ErbB2 signaling that are required for the transformation of human mammary epithelial cells will identify novel strategies for therapeutic intervention in breast cancer. Using an inducible activation of ErbB2 autophosphorylation qsite mutants and the MCF-10A three-dimensional (3D) culture system, we investigated pathways used by ErbB2 to transform the epithelia. We report that ErbB2 induces cell proliferation and loss of 3D organization by redundant mechanisms, whereas it disrupts apical basal polarity and inhibits apoptosis using Tyr 1201 and Tyr 1226/7, respectively. Signals downstream of Tyr 1226/7 were also sufficient to confer paclitaxel resistance. The Tyr 1226/7 binds Shc, and the knockdown of Shc blocks the ability of ErbB2 to inhibit apoptosis and mediate paclitaxel resistance. Tyr 1226/7 is known to activate the Ras/Erk pathway; however, paclitaxel resistance did not correlate with the activation of Erk or Akt, suggesting the presence of a novel mechanism. Thus, our results show that targeting pathways used by ErbB2 to inhibit cell death is a better option than targeting cell proliferation pathways. Furthermore, we identify a novel function for Shc as a regulator of apoptosis and drug resistance in human mammary epithelial cells transformed by ErbB2."
https://openalex.org/W1996516512,"Many but not all species of Streptomyces species harbour a bicistronic melC operon, in which melC2 encodes an extracellular tyrosinase (a polyphenol oxidase) and melC1 encodes a helper protein. On the other hand, a melC-homologous operon (melD) is present in all sequenced Streptomyces chromosomes and could be isolated by PCR from six other species tested. Bioinformatic analysis showed that melC and melD have divergently evolved toward different functions. MelD2, unlike tyrosinase (MelC2), is not secreted, and has a narrower substrate spectrum. Deletion of melD caused an increased sensitivity to several phenolics that are substrates of MelD2. Intracellularly, MelD2 presumably oxidizes the phenolics, thus bypassing spontaneous copper-dependent oxidation that generates DNA-damaging reactive oxygen species. Surprisingly, melC(+) strains were more sensitive rather than less sensitive to phenolics than melC(-) strains. This appeared to be due to conversion of the phenolics by MelC2 to more hydrophobic and membrane-permeable quinones. We propose that the conserved melD operon is involved in defense against phenolics produced by plants, and the sporadically present melC operon probably plays an aggressive role in converting the phenolics to the more permeable quinones, thus fending off less tolerant competing microbes (lacking melD) in the phenolic-rich rhizosphere."
https://openalex.org/W1971756495,"Tec1 is a transcription factor in the yeast mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway that controls invasive growth. Previously we reported that a fraction of Tec1 protein is sumoylated on residue lysine 54 in normally growing cells. Here we describe regulation and functional consequences of Tec1 sumoylation. We found that activation of Kss1, the MAPK that directly activates Tec1, results in a decrease in Tec1 sumoylation and a concurrent increase of Tec1 transcriptional activity. Consistent with a role of sumoylation in inhibiting Tec1 activity, specifically increasing sumoylation of Tec1 by fusing it to the sumoylating enzyme Ubc9 leads to a dramatic decrease of Tec1 transcriptional activity. Invasive growth is also compromised in Tec1-Ubc9. In contrast, fusing sumoylation-site mutant Tec1, i.e., Tec1(K54R), to Ubc9 did not significantly alter transcriptional activation and had a less effect on invasive growth. Taken together, these findings provide evidence for regulated sumoylation as a mechanism to modulate the activity of Tec1 and validate Ubc9 fusion-directed sumoylation as a useful approach for studying protein sumoylation."
https://openalex.org/W2053027820,"Although involved in processes leading to the emergence and development of hormone-dependent breast cancers, the estrogen receptor α (ERα) also prevents transformed cells from progressing toward a more aggressive phenotype. The transcriptional activity of ERα is mediated through two transactivation functions, called activation function 1 and 2, whose respective involvement varies in a cell-specific manner. Here, we identify the Rho/megakaryoblastic leukemia 1 (MKL1) signaling pathway as a main actor in controlling the cell-specific activity of both transactivation functions of ERα. Notably, we show that, when the coregulator MKL1 is sequestered in an inactive form by unpolymerized actin, the transcriptional activity of ERα mainly relies on the activation function 1. The activation of MKL1, which results from its dissociation from unpolymerized actin, promoted by the ability of Rho to support polymeric actin accumulation, silences the activation function 1 of ERα and allows the receptor to mainly act through its activation function 2. Importantly, this switch in the respective contribution exerted by both transactivation functions is correlated with an impaired ability of ERα to efficiently transactivate estrogen-regulated reporter genes. MKL1 is further shown to be present on estrogen-responsive genes in vivo. Interestingly, the Rho/MKL1 signaling pathway is activated during the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. A reduced transactivation efficiency of ERα, resulting from the activation of this pathway, may therefore suppress the protective role exerted by ERα toward tumor progression and invasiveness.

ERα regulates the transcription of specific genes upon binding to regulatory sequences, either directly through the association of its DNA-binding domain to specific sequences called estrogen-responsive elements (EREs), or indirectly through protein-protein interactions with activator protein 1 or Sp1 factors (1.Schultz J.R. Petz L.N. Nardulli A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 347-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). ERα comprises an N-terminal transcriptional activation function, the activation function 1 (AF1), and a ligand-dependent transactivation function, the AF2, which is part of the C-terminal ligand-binding domain. Hormone binding to ERα triggers conformational changes that make these AFs available for interaction with transcriptional coregulators that, in turn, allow the regulation of target genes transcriptional activity. Several subclasses of NR coactivators have been identified, including members of the p160 family, the integrators CBP and p300, arginine methyltransferases, or components of the Mediator complex (2.Nilsson S. Mäkelä S. Treuter E. Tujague M. Thomsen J. Andersson G. Enmark E. Pettersson K. Warner M. Gustafsson J.A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1535-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar, 3.Perissi V. Rosenfeld M.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 542-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar).Mediating estrogenic signaling, ERα plays critical roles in many physiological processes such as the development and function of the reproductive system, bone metabolism, and cardiovascular activity (4.Deroo B.J. Korach K.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 561-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). It is also associated with major human pathologies, and notably estrogen-dependent cancers developed from reproductive organs. For instance, ERα mediates the mitogenic effects that estradiol (E2) exerts on ∼70% of primary breast tumors. However, contrasting with this harmful promotion of tumor growth during initial stages of carcinogenesis, ERα also has protective effects. ERα-positive breast tumors are indeed generally more differentiated and less invasive than ERα-negative cancers and, therefore, display a better prognosis (5.Platet N. Cathiard A.M. Gleizes M. Garcia M. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2004; 51: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, ERα-positive tumors frequently acquire a resistance to steroid hormones-positive influence, which is accompanied with an amplification of growth factor receptor signaling. Notably, the overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor HER2 in ERα-positive breast cancer cells results in a down-regulation of ERα transcriptional activity and expression, both in vitro and in vivo (6.Mazumdar A. Wang R.A. Mishra S.K. Adam L. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Mandal M. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The molecular basis of the loss of sensitivity of ERα-positive breast cancer cells to estrogens still remains elusive.The relative contribution exerted by AF1 and AF2 on the transcriptional activity of ERα varies depending upon the promoter, but also upon the cell considered (7.Berry M. Metzger D. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2811-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 8.Tora L. White J. Brou C. Tasset D. Webster N. Scheer E. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 59: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). For instance, AF2 is the only active AF in cells that have achieved their epithelial-mesenchymal transition (9.Mérot Y. Métivier R. Penot G. Manu D. Saligaut C. Gannon F. Pakdel F. Kah O. Flouriot G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26184-26191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Importantly, the loss of E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell junctions, a key process that occurs during the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, dramatically affects ERα functions by attenuating its transactivation efficiency. This occurs through the silencing of the activity of an AF1 subregion termed box 1, which forces the receptor to mainly act only via its AF2 (10.Huet G. Mérot Y. Le Dily F. Kern L. Ferrière F. Saligaut C. Boujrad N. Pakdel F. Métivier R. Flouriot G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 365: 304-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Disruption of cadherin-mediated intercellular adhesion, migration, and metastasis has been correlated with high activities of RhoA or of its target Rho kinase (or ROCK) (11.Sahai E. Marshall C.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar). According to recent work, RhoA signaling influences the activity of the myocardin-related transcription factor MKL1 (megakaryoblastic leukemia 1, also termed MAL, BSAC, or MRTF-A), which is a coactivator of the serum response factor (SRF) (12.Miralles F. Posern G. Zaromytidou A.I. Treisman R. Cell. 2003; 113: 329-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, 13.Pipes G.C. Creemers E.E. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1545-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The activity of MKL1 depends upon the integrity of epithelial cell junctions (14.Busche S. Descot A. Julien S. Genth H. Posern G. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 1025-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 15.Fan L. Sebe A. Péterfi Z. Masszi A. Thirone A.C. Rotstein O.D. Nakano H. McCulloch C.A. Szászi K. Mucsi I. Kapus A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 1083-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and is regulated by changes in actin dynamics. In serum-starved cells, MKL1 binds to unpolymerized actin (“globular” actin or G-actin) through its RPEL motifs and is thus sequestered in an inactive form. Upon Rho activation, accumulation of fibrillar actin (“fibrillar” actin or F-actin) leads to a G-actin depletion and release of MKL1, which then coactivate SRF transcriptional activities (12.Miralles F. Posern G. Zaromytidou A.I. Treisman R. Cell. 2003; 113: 329-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, 16.Vartiainen M.K. Guettler S. Larijani B. Treisman R. Science. 2007; 316: 1749-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar).We demonstrate in this report that the activation of the Rho/Actin/MKL1 signaling pathway impairs ERα-dependent transcriptional activation, mainly through the inhibition of the activity of the AF1 box 1. Our data thus provide important and novel insights into how actin-dependent processes such as cell shape changes or adhesion may deeply influence estrogenic signaling.DISCUSSIONTransactivation efficiency of ERα results in part from the respective contribution exerted by its two activation functions, whose activity are tightly regulated in a cell-specific manner (7.Berry M. Metzger D. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2811-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). For instance, we and others frequently use HeLa and HepG2 cell lines, which represent strict AF2- and AF1-permissive contexts, respectively. The relative sensitivity of a cell line to AF1 and AF2 can be defined by a comparison of the transcriptional activity of transfected wild-type ERα protein with that of an AF1-deleted form (ERα CF). A similar activity of both receptors defines a strict AF2-permissive cell context, whereas a lower transcriptional activity of ERα CF is inherent to a cell context permissive to AF1. However, differences observed in the expression level of some of the variants used in a given cell line (for instance in HeLa cell line (Ref. 10.Huet G. Mérot Y. Le Dily F. Kern L. Ferrière F. Saligaut C. Boujrad N. Pakdel F. Métivier R. Flouriot G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 365: 304-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar and Fig. 2C)) might weaken the interpretation of the results. Nevertheless, the use of a second approach, based on the strict dependence of the partial agonistic activity of 4-OHT on the human complement C3 promoter toward a cell context sensitive to AF1 (precisely to AF1 box 1 (Refs. 9.Mérot Y.

Commun. 2008; 365: 304-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar and Fig. 4B)), allowed us to confirm the respective contributions exerted by the two activation functions in a given cell line.Through these approaches, we have shown that a high transactivation potency of ERα is correlated with an AF1-permissive cell context generally found in most differentiated epithelial-like cell lines (10.Huet G. Mérot Y. Le Dily F. Kern L. Ferrière F. Saligaut C. Boujrad N. Pakdel F. Métivier R. Flouriot G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 365: 304-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Accordingly, AF2 is the only active AF in cells that have achieved their epithelial-mesenchymal transition (9.Mérot Y. Métivier R. Penot G. Manu D. Saligaut C. Gannon F. Pakdel F. Kah O. Flouriot G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26184-26191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A main step in epithelial-mesenchymal transition is the loss of E-cadherin-mediated cell contacts, which is also associated with tumor dedifferentiation and metastasis (27.Peinado H. Portillo F. Cano A. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2004; 48: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 28.Guarino M. Rubino B. Ballabio G. Pathology. 2007; 39: 305-318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that the existence of intercellular junctions is required for a cell line to be permissive to AF1 (10.Huet G. Mérot Y. Le Dily F. Kern L. Ferrière F. Saligaut C. Boujrad N.

Rho proteins and the actin/MKL1 effector pathway, which are also reported to be involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (15.Fan L. Sebe A. Péterfi Z. Masszi A. Thirone A.C. Rotstein O.D.

Int. 2007; 31: 1225-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), were shown in this study to have a dramatic impact on ERα transcriptional activity.High activities of Rho or of its target ROCK have been correlated with the disruption of cadherin-mediated intercellular adhesion, cell migration, and metastasis (11.Sahai E. Marshall C.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar, 31.Itoh K. Yoshioka K. Akedo H. Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). In accordance with previous work (32.Su L.F. Knoblauch R. Garabedian M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3231-3237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the expression of constitutively active forms of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 reduced ERα transactivation efficiency in a cell-specific manner, whereas dominant negative forms of the Rho GTPases enhanced ERα activity. Because the overexpression of such specific proteins might result in a multiplicity of effects that may indirectly influence ERα transcriptional activity, specific inhibitors of RhoA and ROCK were used to confirm the regulation. This effect involves a modulation of the activity of the AF1 box 1 activity, which was previously identified as the main domain involved in the cell context-dependent contribution of the AF1 (10.Huet G. Mérot Y. Le Dily F. Kern L. Ferrière F. Saligaut C. Boujrad N. Pakdel F. Métivier R. Flouriot G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 365: 304-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Rho GTPases control cellular processes that are connected with actin cytoskeleton, such as changes in cell shape, adhesion, and migration (22.Burridge K. Wennerberg K. Cell. 2004; 116: 167-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar, 23.Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar). A direct impact of such processes on gene expression has been recently illustrated by the control exerted by RhoA on SRF-regulated genes, such as the immediate early gene c-fos. This process involves Rho GTPases promoting F-actin accumulation, thereby changing the cellular levels of actin monomers (G-actin) (25.Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) and inducing the activity of the transcription factor MKL1 (12.Miralles F. Posern G. Zaromytidou A.I. Treisman R. Cell. 2003; 113: 329-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, 16.Vartiainen M.K. Guettler S. Larijani B. Treisman R. Science. 2007; 316: 1749-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that this actin/MKL1 pathway influences ERα transactivation efficiency by controlling the respective contributions of AF1 and AF2 toward ERα transcriptional activity (integrative model illustrated in Fig. 6). This was evidenced through (i) changing the amount of cellular G-actin through cell treatment with an actin-capping drug, or by overexpressing wild-type or unpolymerizable β-actin, and (ii) the use of dominant positive and negative forms of MKL1. In all conditions leading to MKL1 activation, the cellular context became refractory to ERα AF1. The physiological function of this AF is therefore likely to require low or no MKL1 activity.According to our model, MKL1 adopts distinct functional states in HeLa and HepG2 cell lines, which exhibit a differential permissiveness for each of ERα AF. Therefore, how might MKL1 control the transcriptional activity of ERα and act to modify the relative contribution of AF1 and AF2? Differences in the expression of MKL1, or its subcellular localization, which is supposed to regulate its activity (12.Miralles F. Posern G. Zaromytidou A.I. Treisman R. Cell. 2003; 113: 329-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar), were not observed between both cell lines. Post-translational modifications of MKL1 may thus provide additional cell-specific mechanisms controlling its activity, such as phosphorylation (12.Miralles F. Posern G. Zaromytidou A.I. Treisman R. Cell. 2003; 113: 329-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar), or sumoylation (33.Nakagawa K. Kuzumaki N. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 835-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Results obtained through ChIP experiments show that MKL1 is associated with the promoter region of estrogen-responsive genes in the ERα-positive MCF-7 cells and the MDA-MB 231 cells manipulated to stably express ERα (MDA-ERα). Interestingly, both cell lines were demonstrated to be mainly permissive to AF1 transactivation. Following our model, we therefore hypothesize that MKL1 is recruited to the promoters of E2-responsive genes in AF1 contexts which, by definition, would require low or no MKL1 activity. In these conditions, MKL1 is expected to be co-recruited with ERα, as demonstrated by our sequential ChIPs on given promoters. This may support a direct action of MKL1 on ERα activity by modulating the mobilization of coactivators and/or corepressors. For instance, one possible mechanism relies on the fact that the target of the Rho/actin/MKL1 pathway is the ERα AF1 box 1, located between amino acids 38 and 79, which is also involved in the control of ERα activity through E-cadherin-mediated cell contacts (10.Huet G. Mérot Y. Le Dily F. Kern L. Ferrière F. Saligaut C. Boujrad N. Pakdel F. Métivier R. Flouriot G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 365: 304-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This AF1 subregion constitutes an interaction surface for cofactors of the p160 and p300 families and synergistically bridges AF1 and AF2 activities (18.Métivier R. Penot G. Flouriot G. Pakdel F. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1953-1970PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Kobayashi Y. Kitamoto T. Masuhiro Y. Watanabe M. Kase T. Metzger D. Yanagisawa J. Kato S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15645-15651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 35.Webb P. Nguyen P. Valentine C. Lopez G.N. Kwok G.R. McInerney E. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Enmark E. Gustafsson J.A. Nilsson S. Kushner P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1672-1685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, the overexpression of Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor potentiates the action of CBP/p300 on ERα transcriptional activity (36.Su L.F. Wang Z. Garabedian M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37037-37044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Therefore, upon activation by Rho, MKL1 might inhibit the coactivation of ERα by CBP/p300. Rather than having an impact on cofactor recruitment, MKL1 action could also involve corepressors. Indeed, in HeLa cells, the dominant positive form of MKL1 allowed 4-OHT-bound ERα to repress the activity of the C3-LUC reporter gene. A high activity of MKL1 might therefore allow ligand-bound ERα to recruit corepressors such as the nuclear receptor corepressor or the silencing mediator of retinoic acid and the thyroid hormone receptor, which are known actors of the antagonistic actions of selective estrogen receptor mediators such as 4-OHT (37.Lavinsky R.M. Jepsen K. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Mullen T.M. Schiff R. Del-Rio A.L. Ricote M. Ngo S. Gemsch J. Hilsenbeck S.G. Osborne C.K. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Rose D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 2920-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Finally, MKL1 might act alternatively through a mechanism that is independent of its interaction with ERα. Such a hypothesis is strengthened by the fact that the association of MKL1 with the promoters of endogenous E2-target genes appears to be mainly constitutive. In the absence of estradiol, MKL1 is always recruited to the tested promoters, whereas this is not systematically the case for ERα. Furthermore, the sequential ChIP experiments performed on the PRA promoter indicate that MKL1 is likely to be recruited onto a subset of regulatory elements independently of ERα. Thus, MKL1 might regulate epigenetic marks such as histone acetylation or methylation, which indirectly could have an impact on ERα activity. Corroborating this hypothesis, we observed important variations in the basal activity of the luciferase reporter genes following overexpression of MKL1 and its deleted variants. Notably, ERE-driven (ERE-tk-LUC) and ERE-less reporter genes (c-fos-LUC and pTAL-LUC) behaved in a similar manner in response to MKL1 mutants while displaying totally different plasmid backbones. Only the amplitude of the responses differed. Accordingly, MKL1 might directly or indirectly affect the folding of the chromatin-like structure adopted by plasmids in the nucleus. Nevertheless, the correlation between a reduced transactivation potency of ERα and an increased basal activity of the reporter gene is not systematic. For instance, both ΔB- and ΔQ-deleted MKL1 forms reduced ERα activity but exerted opposite effects on the basal activity of some reporter genes. Consequently, the mechanisms underlying the MKL1 influence on ERα activity are likely different from those responsible for the variations of the basal activity of reporter genes. Studying more extensively the combinatorial recruitments of coactivators and corepressors on natural ERα target promoters as well as epigenetic regulations, in conditions where MKL1 exhibits distinct functional state, is now awaited to obtain further insights into the cell-specific mechanisms engaged by MKL1 to influence ERα transcriptional activity.In conclusion, we provide evidence that the respective contribution exerted by AF1 and AF2 toward ERα transcriptional activity is controlled by the Rho/actin/MKL1 pathway. This implies that the transcriptional activity of ERα is greatly modified during the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, through a switch from a dominant AF1- to an AF2-permissive cell context. Changes in actin-dependent cell process, which occur during cell transformation and tumorigenesis, are thus likely to have broad impacts on the transcriptional activity of estrogen receptors. IntroductionThe estrogen receptor α (ERα) 2The abbreviations used are: ERαestrogen receptor αCBPCREB-binding proteinEREestrogen-responsive elementAF1,-2activation functions 1 and 2E2estradiolMKL1megakaryoblastic leukemia 1SRFserum response factorCMVcytomegalovirusGFPgreen fluorescent proteinEGFPenhanced GFP4-OHT4-hydroxytamoxifenChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationROCKRho kinaseANOVAanalysis of varianceHAhemagglutinin. belongs to a class of structurally conserved transcription factors, the nuclear receptor superfamily. ERα regulates the transcription of specific genes upon binding to regulatory sequences, either directly through the association of its DNA-binding domain to specific sequences called estrogen-responsive elements (EREs), or indirectly through protein-protein interactions with activator protein 1 or Sp1 factors (1.Schultz J.R. Petz L.N. Nardulli A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 347-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). ERα comprises an N-terminal transcriptional activation function, the activation function 1 (AF1), and a ligand-dependent transactivation function, the AF2, which is part of the C-terminal ligand-binding domain. Hormone binding to ERα triggers conformational changes that make these AFs available for interaction with transcriptional coregulators that, in turn, allow the regulation of target genes transcriptional activity. Several subclasses of NR coactivators have been identified, including members of the p160 family, the integrators CBP and p300, arginine methyltransferases, or components of the Mediator complex (2.Nilsson S. Mäkelä S. Treuter E. Tujague M. Thomsen J. Andersson G. Enmark E. Pettersson K. Warner M. Gustafsson J.A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1535-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar, 3.Perissi V. Rosenfeld M.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 542-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar).Mediating estrogenic signaling, ERα plays critical roles in many physiological processes such as the development and function of the reproductive system, bone metabolism, and cardiovascular activity (4.Deroo B.J. Korach K.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 561-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). It is also associated with major human pathologies, and notably estrogen-dependent cancers developed from reproductive organs. For instance, ERα mediates the mitogenic effects that estradiol (E2) exerts on ∼70% of primary breast tumors. However, contrasting with this harmful promotion of tumor growth during initial stages of carcinogenesis, ERα also has protective effects. ERα-positive breast tumors are indeed generally more differentiated and less invasive than ERα-negative cancers and, therefore, display a better prognosis (5.Platet N. Cathiard A.M. Gleizes M. Garcia M. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2004; 51: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, ERα-positive tumors frequently acquire a resistance to steroid hormones-positive influence, which is accompanied with an amplification of growth factor receptor signaling. Notably, the overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor HER2 in ERα-positive breast cancer cells results in a down-regulation of ERα transcriptional activity and expression, both in vitro and in vivo (6.Mazumdar A. Wang R.A. Mishra S.K. Adam L. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Mandal M. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The molecular basis of the loss of sensitivity of ERα-positive breast cancer cells to estrogens still remains elusive.The relative contribution exerted by AF1 and AF2 on the transcriptional activity of ERα varies depending upon the promoter, but also upon the cell considered (7.Berry M. Metzger D. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2811-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 8.Tora L. White J. Brou C. Tasset D. Webster N. Scheer E. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 59: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). For instance, AF2 is the only active AF in cells that have achieved their epithelial-mesenchymal transition (9.Mérot Y. Métivier R. Penot G. Manu D. Saligaut C. Gannon F. Pakdel F. Kah O. Flouriot G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26184-26191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Importantly, the loss of E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell junctions, a key process that occurs during the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, dramatically affects ERα functions by attenuating its transactivation efficiency. This occurs through the silencing of the activity of an AF1 subregion termed box 1, which forces the receptor to mainly act only via its AF2 (10.Huet G. Mérot Y. Le Dily F. Kern L. Ferrière F. Saligaut C. Boujrad N. Pakdel F. Métivier R. Flouriot G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 365: 304-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Disruption of cadherin-mediated intercellular adhesion, migration, and metastasis has been correlated with high activities of RhoA or of its target Rho kinase (or ROCK) (11.Sahai E. Marshall C.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar). According to recent work, RhoA signaling influences the activity of the myocardin-related transcription factor MKL1 (megakaryoblastic leukemia 1, also termed MAL, BSAC, or MRTF-A), which is a coactivator of the serum response factor (SRF) (12.Miralles F.

https://openalex.org/W2007039430,"Opioids display ligand-specific differences in the time course of ERK1/2 signaling. Whereas full agonists, like etorphine, induce only transient activation of ERK1/2, the partial agonist morphine mediates persistent stimulation of mitogenic signaling. Here we report that in stably δ-opioid receptor (DOR)-expressing HEK293 (HEK/DOR) cells, the transient nature of etorphine-induced ERK1/2 signaling is due to desensitization of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor-mediated activation of the Ras/Raf-1/ERK1/2 cascade. Desensitization of ERK1/2 activity by etorphine is associated with down-regulation of EGF receptors, an effect mediated by the ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl. In contrast, chronic morphine treatment failed to desensitize EGF receptors, resulting in unimpeded ERK1/2 signaling. The failure of morphine to desensitize ERK1/2 signaling is mediated by persistent activation of c-Src, which induces degradation of c-Cbl. The role of c-Src in opioid-specific ERK1/2 signaling is further demonstrated by pretreatment of the cells with PP2 and SKI-I as well as overexpression of a dominant negative c-Src mutant (c-Src(dn)) or a c-Src-resistant c-Cbl mutant (CblY3F), both of which facilitate desensitization of ERK1/2 signaling by morphine. Conversely, overexpression of c-Src as well as down-regulation of c-Cbl by small interfering RNA results in persistent etorphine-induced stimulation of ERK1/2 activity. Subcellular fractionation experiments finally attributed the ability of morphine to persistently activate c-Src to its redistribution from Triton X-100-insensitive membrane rafts to DOR and EGF receptor containing high density membrane compartments implicated in ERK1/2 signaling. These results demonstrate that agonist-specific differences in the temporal and spatial pattern of c-Src activation determine the kinetics of DOR-mediated regulation of ERK1/2 signaling.

Seger R. Growth Factors. 2006; 24: 21-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The intracellular pathways mediating ERK1/2 stimulation include transactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), e.g. the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, which integrates a number of different GPCR-derived signals to activation of the well conserved Ras/Raf-1/ERK1/2 signal transduction module (2.Pierce K.L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1532-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Generally, the duration of ERK1/2 signaling by GPCRs is transient and desensitizes rapidly within minutes after receptor stimulation (3.Gurevich V.V. Gurevich E.V. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 74: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This time course is best demonstrated for δ-opioid receptor (DOR) carrying cell lines and tissues, in which a number of full opioid agonists, like the alkaloid etorphine and the opioid peptide [d-Pen2,5]enkephalin, produce short term stimulation of ERK1/2 signaling that peaks after 5 min and completely reverts to control levels within 60 min of receptor stimulation (4.Eisinger D.A. Schulz R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 309: 776-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 5.Audet N. Paquin-Gobeil M. Landry-Paquet O. Schiller P.W. Piñeyro G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7808-7816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Desensitization of GPCR-induced mitogenic signaling is mediated by degradation rather than phosphorylation and internalization of transactivated RTKs, because endocytosed EGF receptors are still able to mediate ERK1/2 activation (6.Xue L. Lucocq J. Cell Signal. 1998; 10: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 7.Grewal J.S. Luttrell L.M. Raymond J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27335-27344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Besides the induction of transient mitogenic signaling, the DOR system is also characterized by the ability of morphine to induce long lasting stimulation of the ERK1/2 pathway (8.Eisinger D.A. Ammer H. Schulz R. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10192-10200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because stimulation of ERK1/2 activity by morphine is also mediated by transactivation of EGF receptors (4.Eisinger D.A. Schulz R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 309: 776-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), it might be speculated that the ligand-specific property of morphine to produce persistent ERK1/2 stimulation is mediated by its failure to desensitize RTK signaling.

Morphine, a partial alkaloid agonist, differs from other opioids because it fails to induce opioid receptor desensitization and internalization (9.Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C.

As a consequence, chronic morphine treatment is associated with a number of compensatory adaptations on a post-receptor level, including quantitative and qualitative changes in G proteins (10.Ammer H. Schulz R. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), effectors (11.Chakrabarti S. Liu N.J. Gintzler A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 13686-13691Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and regulators of GPCR sensitivity (12.Chakrabarti S. Oppermann M. Gintzler A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 4209-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13.Ferrer-Alcón M. La Harpe R. García-Sevilla J.A. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2004; 121: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Among the latter, protein kinase A- and protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation of Gβ subunits, adenylyl cyclase type II, and G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) has been shown to enhance opioid receptor signaling (12.Chakrabarti S. Oppermann M. Gintzler A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 4209-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 14.Chakrabarti S. Gintzler A.R. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2003; 119: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition, chronic morphine treatment also results in inhibition of β-arrestin1 function, an adapter protein that plays a central role in receptor sequestration and endocytosis. Because the β-arrestin1-dependent pathway is not specific for a certain receptor, chronic morphine treatment not only results in attenuation of homologous desensitization but also of heterologous desensitization of other inhibitory GPCRs, like the CB1 cannabinoid and M4 muscarinic receptor (8.Eisinger D.A. Ammer H. Schulz R. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10192-10200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Besides their role in GPCR signaling, β-arrestin1, GRK2, and Gβγ subunits have also been shown to regulate the function of diverse RTKs, like the insulin-like growth factor I receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and the EGF receptor (15.Lin F.T. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31640-31643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 16.Kim J. Ahn S. Guo R. Daaka Y.

Chem. 2002; 277: 48261-48269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, it is tempting to speculate whether chronic opioid treatment might also interfere with the regulation of RTK function. Indeed, chronic morphine treatment has been recently shown to promote insulin receptor signaling by increasing receptor abundance (18.Sood A. Thakur V.S. Karmarkar M.G. Ahuja M.M. Endocr. Res. 2001; 27: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The function of EGF receptors is regulated by c-Cbl, an adaptor protein of the family of casitas B-lineage lymphoma proteins (19.Swaminathan G. Tsygankov A.Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 209: 21-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In response to receptor activation, the primarily cytosolic protein is targeted to the autophosphorylated EGF receptor (Tyr1045) where it transfers ubiquitin to the C terminus and directs the receptor to proteasomal degradation (20.Duan L. Miura Y. Dimri M. Majumder B. Dodge I.L. Reddi A.L. Ghosh A. Fernandes N. Zhou P. Mullane-Robinson K. Rao N. Donoghue S. Rogers R.A. Bowtell D. Naramura M. Gu H. Band V. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28950-28960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The activity of c-Cbl in turn is subject to regulation by the Src kinase family (19.Swaminathan G. Tsygankov A.Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 209: 21-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Besides their role in regulation of EGF receptor activity, Src kinases are also involved in a number of different GPCR mechanisms (21.Zhang L. Zhao H. Qiu Y. Loh H.H. Law P.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 1990-2000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 22.Zimmerman B. Simaan M. Lee M.H. Luttrell L.M. Laporte S.A. Cell Signal. 2009; 21: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), providing a potential target for cross-regulation of c-Cbl function by GPCRs (23.Jacob C. Cottrell G.S. Gehringer D. Schmidlin F. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16076-16087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In this respect, c-Src has been implicated in many aspects of DOR function, including the duration of opioid-stimulated ERK1/2 signaling (5.Audet N. Paquin-Gobeil M. Landry-Paquet O. Schiller P.W. Piñeyro G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7808-7816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether c-Src-regulated c-Cbl is involved in the termination of DOR-stimulated ERK1/2 signaling by full opioid agonists and whether morphine differs in this aspect. Our results demonstrate that in stably DOR-expressing HEK293 cells, chronic morphine treatment is associated with subcellular redistribution and persistent activation of c-Src, a ligand-specific property that prevents EGF receptor down-regulation and enables persistent ERK1/2 signaling by degradation of c-Cbl. HEK293 cells stably expressing the wild type or HA-tagged form of the mouse DOR (HEK/DOR and HEK/HA-DOR; 1.4 ± 0.2 and 1.7 ± 0.1 pmol receptors/mg membrane of protein, respectively) were generated as described (8.Eisinger D.A. Ammer H. Schulz R. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10192-10200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were cultured under standard conditions in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C. Where indicated, the cells were transfected to transiently overexpress c-Cbl, a c-Src-resistant mutant of c-Cbl (CblY3F), c-Src, and a dominant negative mutant of c-Src (c-Src(dn)), using the Metafectene ProTM transfection reagent (Biontex Laboratories, Martinsried, Germany). All of the cDNAs were subcloned into plasmid pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), and the cells were used for experimentation 24 h after transfection. The cells transfected with empty vector served as controls throughout. Knockdown of c-Cbl expression was achieved by transfection of HEK/DOR cells with three target-specific siRNAs (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells transfected with control siRNA-A from the same company were used as the control. Naive or transiently transfected HEK/DOR cells were seeded onto 12-well tissue culture plates and allowed to grow overnight. Subconfluent monolayers were then washed and equilibrated to serum-reduced conditions (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% fetal calf serum) for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were treated with etorphine, morphine HCl, EGF, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for the times and concentrations indicated in the text. In some experiments, the function of EGF receptors and c-Src was inhibited by preincubation of the cells for 15 min with 4-(3-chloroanillino)-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline (AG1478) (34.Rozengurt E. J.

All of the reactions were stopped by aspiration of the incubation medium and subsequent solubilization of the cells using 150 μl of ice-cold Laemmli sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% phenol red). The cell lysates were centrifuged (10 min; 15,000 × g) before the supernatants were heated for 5 min to 95 °C. HEK/DOR cells were plated on 22-mm coverslips and transfected with c-Cbl subcloned into pEGFP-C3 (BD Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany). The next day, the cells were washed and then cultured for 2 h in the absence of serum before redistribution of c-Cbl was initiated by the addition of 100 nm etorphine and 1 μm morphine for 5 min at 37 °C. Subsequently the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, mounted on glass slides, and analyzed by confocal microscopy (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The images shown were acquired using a 63×/1.4 oil immersion objective. HEK/HA-DOR cells were grown to confluence in 10-cm2 dishes, washed twice, and incubated for 1 h under serum-free conditions. The cells were kept for an additional hour in the absence (control) or presence of 100 nm etorphine and 1 μm morphine, before they were scraped into ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, washed twice by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min, and subjected to subcellular fractionation after solubilization with 1% Triton X-100 as previously reported (26.de Diesbach P. Medts T. Carpentier S. D'Auria L. Van Der Smissen P. Platek A. Mettlen M. Caplanusi A. van den Hove M.F. Tyteca D. Courtoy P.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 1465-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). All of the steps were performed at 4 °C. The cells were homogenized in 0.6 ml of TME lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and Complete® protease inhibitors), containing 40% (m/v) sucrose, by 10 passages through a 22-gauge needle. The homogenate was placed on the bottom of a 2.2-ml ultracentrifuge tube and overlaid with of 0.8 ml of 30% sucrose and 0.8 ml of 5% sucrose in TME lysis buffer to form a discontinuous gradient. The samples were centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 18 h using a S-55S swinging bucket rotor in a Sorvall RC M120GX ultracentrifuge (Sorvall Deutschland GmbH, Bad Homburg, Germany). Twelve fractions (∼183 μl each) were collected from the top and analyzed for the presence of the membrane raft marker caveolin (fractions 5–7) and the non-raft marker transferrin receptor (fractions 11 and 12) by Western blot. These fractions were pooled, mixed with 5× Laemmli sample buffer, and designated as low density membrane rafts or high density membranes. Whole cell proteins or sucrose density gradient samples were resolved by electrophoresis over 8 (EGF receptor), 10 (c-Cbl, c-Src, ERK1/2, HA-DOR, transferrin receptor), or 12% (caveolin, H-Ras) SDS-polyacrylamide gels, before proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The blots were blocked for 1 h with 5% casein in Tris-buffered saline, containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS/T) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies recognizing the following proteins: caveolin, EGF receptor, H-Ras, ERK1/2, phospho(Thr202/Tyr204)ERK1/2, phospho(Tyr527)c-Src (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), c-Cbl, c-Src (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), transferrin receptor (BD Transduction Laboratories, San Jose, CA), and HA tag (generated in our own laboratory). All of the antibodies were diluted in TBS/T containing 0.1% casein and used at the concentrations recommended by the supplier. The membranes were washed three times, and bound antibodies were labeled by incubation for 1 h with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse-IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). After extensive washing with TBS/T, the blots were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences ECL, GE Healthcare Lifescience, Munich, Germany), and the density of the immunoreactive bands was quantified by video densitometry. The data are presented as the means ± S.D. and were tested for statistical significance by an unpaired Student's t test. Treatment of HEK/DOR cells with a maximal effective concentration of etorphine (100 nm) results in transient stimulation of ERK1/2 activity, which is maximal after 5 min and rapidly desensitizes within 60 min of receptor activation (Fig. 1A). Morphine (1 μm) displays a fundamental different kinetics, because it produces persistent ERK1/2 stimulation, which is still maximal even after 60 min of cell treatment. The failure of morphine to desensitize DOR-stimulated ERK1/2 signaling is further demonstrated by the ability of etorphine (5 min at 100 nm) to fully stimulate ERK1/2 activation in cells pretreated for 60 min with morphine but not with etorphine (Fig. 1A). Because opioid-induced stimulation of ERK1/2 signaling is mediated by transactivation of EGF receptors (Fig. 1B), we investigated next whether the differences in ERK1/2 signaling observed might be possibly because of opioid-specific regulation of RTK activity. For this, HEK/DOR cells were pretreated for 60 min with etorphine or morphine before the effect of EGF on MAPK stimulation was determined. As shown in Fig. 1C (lower panel), the addition of EGF (10 ng/ml for 5 min) to naïve cells results in strong stimulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Most interestingly, pretreatment of the cells with a maximum effective concentration of etorphine (100 nm) obtained in preliminary dose-response experiments (not shown) completely abolished this effect without affecting the overall abundance of these MAPKs (Fig. 1C, upper panel). On the other hand, exposure of HEK/DOR cells for 60 min to morphine (1 μm) fails to interfere with EGF-induced ERK1/2 activation. These findings indicate that in HEK/DOR cells, chronic etorphine treatment results in rapid desensitization of EGF-stimulated ERK1/2 signaling, whereas morphine does not. To elucidate whether attenuation of EGF-stimulated ERK1/2 signaling is because of desensitization of EGF receptor activity or to downstream adaptations within the Ras/Raf-1/ERK1/2 signaling pathway, the effect of opioid pretreatment on protein kinase C-stimulated ERK1/2 activity was tested. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (100 nm; 5 min) is an activator of protein kinase C, which directly stimulates Raf-1 (27.Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marmé D. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar) and thus may be used as a tool to investigate EGF receptor-independent stimulation of the ERK1/2 pathway (28.Rubio I. Rennert K. Wittig U. Beer K. Dürst M. Stang S.L. Stone J. Wetzker R. Biochem. J. 2006; 398: 243-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1D, both chronic etorphine and morphine failed to affect the ability of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate to activate ERK1/2. This finding indicates that chronic etorphine pretreatment attenuates EGF-induced ERK1/2 stimulation by desensitization of EGF receptor function. Desensitization of GPCR-stimulated ERK1/2 signaling is mediated by EGF receptor degradation (7.Grewal J.S. Luttrell L.M. Raymond J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27335-27344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This mechanism is associated with agonist-induced redistribution of c-Cbl to the plasma membrane, a cytosolic adaptor protein directing activated RTKs from lipid rafts to proteasomal degradation (20.Duan L. Miura Y. Dimri M. Majumder B. Dodge I.L. Reddi A.L. Ghosh A. Fernandes N. Zhou P. Mullane-Robinson K. Rao N. Donoghue S. Rogers R.A. Bowtell D. Naramura M. Gu H. Band V. Band H. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2167-2178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In HEK/DOR cells transiently overexpressing an EGFP-tagged form of c-Cbl, only etorphine (100 nm), but not morphine (1 μm) treatment is able to induce a punctuate accumulation of the construct at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2A). This observation raises the possibility as to whether in HEK/DOR cells etorphine treatment might possibly cross-regulate EGF receptor function. Because functional desensitization of EGF receptor activity occurs before their degradation in the endosomal compartment (30.Burke P. Schooler K. Wiley H.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1897-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), the overall abundance of EGF receptors in whole cell preparations was determined as a measure for chronic opioid-induced RTK down-regulation. As shown in Fig. 2B, exposure of HEK/DOR cells to etorphine (100 nm) results in a time-dependent loss of EGF receptor immunoreactivity in whole cell preparations, which is complete after 90 min of cell exposure. In contrast, chronic morphine treatment for up to 90 min had no effect on EGF receptor abundance. These results demonstrate that sustained DOR activation by etorphine, but not morphine, results in substantial EGF receptor down-regulation within 60 min of drug exposure. We next investigated whether the failure of morphine to down-regulate the EGF receptor is because of regulatory changes at the level of c-Cbl. For this, HEK/DOR cells were exposed for up to 60 min to maximum effective concentrations of either etorphine or morphine and were subsequently analyzed for c-Cbl abundance. Immunoblot analysis of whole cell lysates obtained from morphine-treated cells revealed a time-dependent decrease in c-Cbl immunoreactivity. In contrast, the relative amount of c-Cbl remained unchanged after etorphine treatment (Fig. 2B). Thus, long term exposure of HEK/DOR cells to morphine, but not to etorphine, is associated with down-regulation of c-Cbl. The duration of EGF receptor-stimulated ERK1/2 signaling is prolonged in c-Cbl-deficient HeLa cells (31.Timpson P. Lynch D.K. Schramek D. Walker F. Daly R.J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3273-3280Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To determine whether down-regulation of c-Cbl might be responsible for the ability of morphine to induce persistent ERK1/2 stimulation, morphine-stimulated MAPK signaling was analyzed in transiently c-Cbl-overexpressing HEK/DOR cells. In control cells carrying endogenous levels of this adaptor protein, exposure to morphine for both 5 and 60 min results in a pronounced stimulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. After moderate overexpression of c-Cbl, morphine gains the ability to desensitize ERK1/2 signaling after 60 min of treatment, an effect that is accompanied by down-regulation of EGF receptor abundance (Fig. 3). Heterologous expression of higher c-Cbl concentrations results in the reduction of basal levels of EGF receptor abundance and further decreases ERK1/2 phosphorylation after 5 min of morphine treatment. Under these conditions, MAPK signaling is completely desensitized after 60 min of morphine exposure (Fig. 3). These results illustrate that overexpression of c-Cbl converts morphine into an opioid agonist that is now able to down-regulate EGF receptors and to desensitize ERK1/2 signaling. Because proteasomal destruction of c-Cbl is under the control of c-Src (32.Bao J. Gur G. Yarden Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 2438-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), regulation of this tyrosine kinase by the opioids was investigated next. Under basal conditions, c-Src is inactivated by constitutive phosphorylation at Tyr527 (33.Cooper J.A. King C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4467-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Stimulation of the cells for 5–60 min with morphine (1 μm) results in rapid and sustained dephosphorylation of Tyr527, without affecting total c-Src abundance. In contrast, exposure of the cells to etorphine (100 nm) failed to affect the phosphorylation state of c-Src. These findings demonstrate that morphine is able to mediate prolonged activation of c-Src, whereas etorphine does not (Fig. 4A). To further evaluate whether morphine-specific regulation of c-Src activity possibly contributes to sustained MAPK activation by this opiate, the effect of the Src inhibitors PP2 and SKI-I on chronic morphine-induced ERK1/2 signaling was examined. At concentrations specific for inhibition of c-Src, pretreatment of the cells with both inhibitors completely blocked chronic morphine-induced down-regulation of c-Cbl. As a consequence, both c-Src inhibitors facilitated down-regulation of EGF receptors and desensitization of ERK1/2 signaling by chronic morphine. A similar observation is made in morphine-treated cells after overexpression of c-Src(dn), a dominate negative mutant that competes with endogenous c-Src (Fig. 4B). These results demonstrate that persistent activation of c-Src by chronic morphine results in down-regulation of c-Cbl, which prevents desensitization of EGF receptors and ERK1/2 signaling. Besides its regulatory role on c-Cbl stability, c-Src also interferes with a number of additional steps in GPCR-stimulated ERK1/2 signaling (34.Rozengurt E. J. Cell. Physiol. 2007; 213: 589-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). To exclude such a possibility, HEK/DOR cells were transiently transfected with a c-Src-resistant mutant of c-Cbl (CblY3F) (31.Timpson P. Lynch D.K. Schramek D. Walker F. Daly R.J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3273-3280Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and subsequently analyzed for chronic morphine-induced regulation of ERK1/2 signaling. Indeed, CblY3F is able to bind to and ubiquitinate the EGF receptor (35.Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lavi S. Iwai K. Reiss Y. Ciechanover A. Lipkowitz S.

Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 2438-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In cells overexpressing this c-Src resistant mutant, chronic morphine treatment results in time-dependent degradation of EGF receptors (Fig. 4C), indicating that c-Src-mediated activation and degradation of c-Cbl indeed prevent"
https://openalex.org/W2024652850,"A high prevalence (50-80%) of Tuberculin Skin Test Positivity (TST+ >or=10 mm indurations) has been reported in TB endemic countries. This pool forms a huge reservoir for new incident TB cases. However, immune biomarkers associated with TST conversion are largely unknown. The objective of this study was to identify immune biomarkers associated with TST conversion after acute Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) exposure.A 24 month longitudinal study was carried out in a recently MTB exposed cohort of household contacts (HC = 93; 75% TST+). Control group consisted of unexposed community controls (EC = 59; 46%TST+). Cytokine secretion was assessed in whole blood cultures in response to either mycobacterial culture filtrate (CF) antigens or mitogens (PHA or LPS) using Elisa methodology. Compared to the EC group, the HC group at recruitment (Kruskal-Wallis Test) showed significantly suppressed IFN gamma (p = 0.0001), raised IL-10 (p = 0.0005) and raised TNF alpha (p = 0.001) in response to CF irrespective of their TST status. Seventeen TST-HC, showed TST conversion when retested at 6 months. Post TST conversion (paired t tests) significant increases were observed for CF induced IFN gamma (p = 0.038), IL-10 (p = 0.001) and IL-6 (p = 0.006). Cytokine responses were also compared in the exposed HC group with either recent infection [(TST converters (N = 17)] or previous infection [TST+ HC (N = 54)] at 0, 6, 12 and 24 months using ANOVA on repeated measures. Significant differences between the exposed HC groups were noted only at 6 months. CF induced IFN gamma was higher in previously infected HC group (p = 0.038) while IL-10 was higher in recently infected HC group (p = 0.041). Mitogen induced cytokine secretion showed similar differences for different group.Our results suggest that TST conversion is associated with early increases in IFN gamma and IL-10 responses and precedes latency by several months post exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2038616046,"The germinal center kinases (GCK) constitute a large, highly conserved family of proteins that has been implicated in a wide variety of cellular processes including cell growth and proliferation, polarity, migration, and stress responses. Although diverse, these functions have been attributed to an evolutionarily conserved role for GCKs in the activation of ERK, JNK, and p38 MAP kinase pathways. In addition, multiple GCKs from different species promote apoptotic cell death. In contrast to these paradigms, we found that a C. elegans GCK, GCK-1, functions to inhibit MAP kinase activation and apoptosis in the C. elegans germline. In the absence of GCK-1, a specific MAP kinase isoform is ectopically activated and oocytes undergo abnormal development. Moreover, GCK-1- deficient animals display a significant increase in germ cell death. Our results suggest that individual germinal center kinases act in mechanistically distinct ways and that these functions are likely to depend on organ- and developmental-specific contexts."
https://openalex.org/W1975032714,"Giardiavirus (GLV) utilizes an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) for translation initiation in the early branching eukaryote Giardia lamblia. Unlike most of the viral IRESs among higher eukaryotes, which localize primarily within the 5'-untranslated region (UTR), the GLV IRES comprises 253 nts of 5'UTR and the initial 264 nts in the open-reading-frame (ORF). To test if GLV IRES also functions in higher eukaryotic systems, we examined it in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) and found that it functions much less efficiently than the IRES from the Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) or Cricket paralysis virus (CrPV). In contrast, both EMCV-IRES and CrPV-IRESs were inactive in transfected Giardia cells. Structure-function analysis indicated that only the stem-loop U5 from the 5'UTR and the stem-loop I plus the downstream box (Dbox) from the ORF of GLV IRES are required for limited IRES function in RRL. Edeine, a translation initiation inhibitor, did not significantly affect the function of GLV IRES in either RRL or Giardia, indicating that a pre-initiation complex is not required for GLV IRES-mediated translation initiation. However, the small ribosomal subunit purified from Giardia did not bind to GLV IRES, indicating that additional protein factors may be necessary. A member of the helicase family IBP1 and two known viral IRES binding proteins La autoantigen and SRp20 have been identified in Giardia that bind to GLV IRES in vitro. These three proteins could be involved in facilitating small ribosome recruitment for initiating translation."
