https://openalex.org/W2113526393,"The mechanisms by which circadian pacemaker systems transmit timing information to control behavior are largely unknown. Here, we define two critical features of that mechanism in Drosophila. We first describe animals mutant for the pdf neuropeptide gene, which is expressed by most of the candidate pacemakers (LNv neurons). Next, we describe animals in which pdf neurons were selectively ablated. Both sets of animals produced similar behavioral phenotypes. Both sets entrained to light, but both were largely arrhythmic under constant conditions. A minority of each pdf variant exhibited weak to moderate free-running rhythmicity. These results confirm the assignment of LNv neurons as the principal circadian pacemakers controlling daily locomotion in Drosophila. They also implicate PDF as the principal circadian transmitter."

https://openalex.org/W1982824007,"Members of the Hedgehog (Hh) family of secreted signaling proteins function as potent short-range organizers in animal development. Their range of action is limited by a C-terminal cholesterol tether and the upregulation of Patched (Ptc) receptor levels. Here we identify a novel segment-polarity gene in Drosophila, dispatched (disp), and demonstrate that its product is required in sending cells for normal Hh function. In the absence of Disp, cholesterol-modified but not cholesterol-free Hh is retained in these cells, indicating that Disp functions to release cholesterol-anchored Hh. Despite their opposite roles, Disp and Ptc share structural homology in the form of a sterol-sensing domain, suggesting that release and sequestration of cholesterol-modified Hh may be based on related molecular pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1985844089,"Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) is the etiologic agent of exanthema subitum, causes opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients, and has been implicated in multiple sclerosis and in the progression of AIDS. Here, we show that the two major HHV-6 subgroups (A and B) use human CD46 as a cellular receptor. Downregulation of surface CD46 was documented during the course of HHV-6 infection. Both acute infection and cell fusion mediated by HHV-6 were specifically inhibited by a monoclonal antibody to CD46; fusion was also blocked by soluble CD46. Nonhuman cells that were resistant to HHV-6 fusion and entry became susceptible upon expression of recombinant human CD46. The use of a ubiquitous immunoregulatory receptor opens novel perspectives for understanding the tropism and pathogenicity of HHV-6."
https://openalex.org/W2157618233,"Mutant ataxin-1, the expanded polyglutamine protein causing spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), aggregates in ubiquitin-positive nuclear inclusions (NI) that alter proteasome distribution in affected SCA1 patient neurons. Here, we observed that ataxin-1 is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. While ataxin-1 [2Q] and mutant ataxin-1 [92Q] are polyubiquitinated equally well in vitro, the mutant form is three times more resistant to degradation. Inhibiting proteasomal degradation promotes ataxin-1 aggregation in transfected cells. And in mice, Purkinje cells that express mutant ataxin-1 but not a ubiquitin-protein ligase have significantly fewer NIs. Nonetheless, the Purkinje cell pathology is markedly worse than that of SCA1 mice. Taken together, NIs are not necessary to induce neurodegeneration, but impaired proteasomal degradation of mutant ataxin-1 may contribute to SCA1 pathogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2069974281,"Despite its conservation in organisms from bacteria to human and its general requirement for transcriptional silencing in yeast, the function of the Sir2 protein is unknown. Here we show that Sir2 can transfer labeled phosphate from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide to itself and histones in vitro. A modified form of Sir2, which results from its automodification activity, is specifically recognized by anti-mono-ADP-ribose antibodies, suggesting that Sir2 is an ADP-ribosyltransferase. Mutation of a phylogenetically invariant histidine residue in Sir2 abolishes both its enzymatic activity in vitro and its silencing functions in vivo. However, the mutant protein is associated with chromatin and other silencing factors in a manner similar to wild-type Sir2. These findings suggest that Sir2 contains an ADP-ribosyltransferase activity that is essential for its silencing function."
https://openalex.org/W1986108211,"To better understand the requirements for telomerase-mediated telomere addition in vivo, we developed an assay in S. cerevisiae that creates a chromosome end immediately adjacent to a short telomeric DNA tract. The de novo end acts as a telomere: it is protected from degradation in a CDC13-dependent manner, telomeric sequences are added efficiently, and addition occurs at a faster rate in mutant strains that have long telomeres. Telomere addition was detected in M phase arrested cells, which permitted us to determine that the essential DNA polymerases α and δ and DNA primase were required. This indicates that telomeric DNA synthesis by telomerase is tightly coregulated with the production of the opposite strand. Such coordination prevents telomerase from generating excessively long single-stranded tails, which may be deleterious to chromosome stability in S. cerevisiae."
https://openalex.org/W2054411617,"Conventional imaging techniques have provided high-resolution imaging either in the spatial domain or in the temporal domain. Optical imaging utilizing voltage-sensitive dyes has long had the unrealized potential to achieve high resolution in both domains simultaneously, providing subcolumnar spatial detail with millisecond precision. Here, we present a series of developments in voltage-sensitive dyes and instrumentation that make functional imaging of cortical dynamics practical, in both anesthetized and awake behaving preparations, greatly facilitating exploration of the cortex. We illustrate this advance by analyzing the millisecond-by-millisecond emergence of orientation maps in cat visual cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2003338471,"SV2 proteins are abundant synaptic vesicle proteins expressed in two major (SV2A and SV2B) and one minor isoform (SV2C) that resemble transporter proteins. We now show that SV2B knockout mice are phenotypically normal while SV2A- and SV2A/SV2B double knockout mice exhibit severe seizures and die postnatally. In electrophysiological recordings from cultured hippocampal neurons, SV2A- or SV2B-deficient cells exhibited no detectable abnormalities. Neurons lacking both SV2 isoforms, however, experienced sustained increases in Ca2+-dependent synaptic transmission when two or more action potentials were triggered in succession. These increases could be reversed by EGTA-AM. Our data suggest that without SV2 proteins, presynaptic Ca2+ accumulation during consecutive action potentials causes abnormal increases in neurotransmitter release that destabilize synaptic circuits and induce epilepsy."
https://openalex.org/W2107370312,"Orexin (hypocretin) appears to play a role in the regulation of energy balances. Previous reports have indicated that orexin-containing neurons are found only in the lateral hypothalamic (LH) area. We show that a subset of neurons in the gut which also express leptin receptors display orexin-like immunoreactivity and express functional orexin receptors. Orexin excites secretomotor neurons in the guinea pig submucosal plexus and increases motility. Moreover, fasting upregulates the phosphorylated form of cAMP response element–binding protein (pCREB) in orexin-immunoreactive neurons, indicating a functional response to food status in these cells. Together, these data suggest that orexin in the gut may play an even more intimate role in regulating energy homeostasis than it does in the CNS."
https://openalex.org/W2150463050,"Microtubules are dynamic polymers that move stochastically between periods of growth and shrinkage, a property known as dynamic instability. Here, to investigate the mechanisms regulating microtubule dynamics in Xenopus egg extracts, we have cloned the complementary DNA encoding the microtubule-associated protein XMAP215 and investigated the function of the XMAP215 protein. Immunodepletion of XMAP215 indicated that it is a major microtubule-stabilizing factor in Xenopus egg extracts. During interphase, XMAP215 stabilizes microtubules primarily by opposing the activity of the destabilizing factor XKCM1, a member of the kinesin superfamily. These results indicate that microtubule dynamics in Xenopus egg extracts are regulated by a balance between a stabilizing factor, XMAP215, and a destabilizing factor, XKCM1."
https://openalex.org/W2015747402,"The amino acid glutamine has a central role in nitrogen metabolism. Although the molecular mechanisms responsible for its transport across cell membranes remain poorly understood, classical amino acid transport system N appears particularly important. Using intracellular pH measurements, we have now identified an orphan protein related to a vesicular neurotransmitter transporter as system N. Functional analysis shows that this protein (SN1) involves H+ exchange as well as Na+ cotransport and, under physiological conditions, mediates glutamine efflux as well as uptake. Together with the pattern of SN1 expression, these unusual properties suggest novel physiological roles for system N in nitrogen metabolism and synaptic transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2086465672,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) induce autonomic neurogenesis in neural crest cultures and stimulate sympathetic neuron development when overexpressed in vivo. We demonstrate that inhibition of BMPs in the chick embryo bythe BMP antagonist Noggin prevents sympathetic neuron generation. In Noggin-treated embryos, the noradrenergic marker genes tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH), panneuronal neurofilament 160 (NF160) and SCG10 genes, and the transcriptional regulators Phox2b and Phox2a are not expressed in sympathetic ganglia. Whereas initial ganglion development is not affected, the expression of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Cash-1 is strongly reduced. These results demonstrate that BMPs are essential for sympathetic neuron development and establish Cash-1 and Phox2 genes as downstream effectors of BMPs in this lineage."

https://openalex.org/W2047529879,"We have evaluated the role of the Drosophila mushroom bodies (MBs) in courtship conditioning, in which experience with mated females causes males to reduce their courtship toward virgins (Siegel and Hall, 1979). Whereas previous studies indicated that MB ablation abolished learning in an olfactory conditioning paradigm (deBelle and Heisenberg, 1994), MB-ablated males were able to learn in the courtship paradigm. They resumed courting at naive levels within 30 min after training, however, while the courtship of control males remained depressed 1 hr after training. We also describe a novel courtship conditioning paradigm that established long-term memory, lasting 9 days. In MB-ablated males, memory dissipated completely within 1 day. Our results indicate that the MBs are not required for learning and immediate recall of courtship conditioning but are required for consolidation of short-term and long-term associative memories."
https://openalex.org/W2039486080,"The chaperonin GroEL is a double toriodal assembly that with its cochaperonin GroES facilitates protein folding with an ATP-dependent mechanism. Nonnative conformations of diverse protein substrates bind to the apical domains surrounding the opening of the double toroid's central cavity. Using phage display, we have selected peptides with high affinity for the isolated apical domain. We have determined the crystal structures of the complexes formed by the most strongly bound peptide with the isolated apical domain, and with GroEL. The peptide interacts with the groove between paired alpha helices in a manner similar to that of the GroES mobile loop. Our structural analysis, combined with other results, suggests that various modes of molecular plasticity are responsible for tight promiscuous binding of nonnative substrates and their release into the shielded cis assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2169633541,"Microtubule assembly in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is initiated from sites within spindle pole bodies (SPBs) in the nuclear envelope. Microtubule plus ends are thought to be organized distal to the SPBs, while minus ends are proximal. Several hypotheses for the function of microtubule motor proteins in force generation and regulation of microtubule assembly propose that assembly and disassembly occur at minus ends as well as at plus ends. Here we analyse microtubule assembly relative to the SPBs in haploid yeast cells expressing green fluorescent protein fused to alpha-tubulin, a microtubule subunit. Throughout the cell cycle, analysis of fluorescent speckle marks on cytoplasmic astral microtubules reveals that there is no detectable assembly or disassembly at minus ends. After laser-photobleaching, metaphase spindles recover about 63% of the bleached fluorescence, with a half-life of about 1 minute. After anaphase onset, photobleached marks in the interpolar spindle are persistent and do not move relative to the SPBs. In late anaphase, the elongated spindles disassemble at the microtubule plus ends. These results show for astral and anaphase interpolar spindle microtubules, and possibly for metaphase spindle microtubules, that microtubule assembly and disassembly occur at plus, and not minus, ends."
https://openalex.org/W1982763652,"Information processing in the nervous system depends on the creation of specific synaptic connections between neurons and targets during development. The homeodomain transcription factor Otx1 is expressed in early-generated neurons of the developing cerebral cortex. Within layer 5, Otx1 is expressed by neurons with subcortical axonal projections to the midbrain and spinal cord. Otx1 is also expressed in the precursors of these neurons, but is localized to the cytoplasm. Nuclear translocation of Otx1 occurs when layer 5 neurons enter a period of axonal refinement and eliminate a subset of their long-distance projections. Otx1 mutant mice are defective in the refinement of these exuberant projections, suggesting that Otx1 is required for the development of normal axonal connectivity and the generation of coordinated motor behavior."

https://openalex.org/W2009338139,"We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate brain regions involved in extracting three-dimensional structure from motion. A factorial design included two-dimensional and three-dimensional structures undergoing rigid and nonrigid motions. As predicted from monkey data, the human homolog of MT/V5 was significantly more active when subjects viewed three-dimensional (as opposed to two-dimensional) displays, irrespective of their rigidity. Human MT/V5+ (hMT/V5+) is part of a network with right hemisphere dominance involved in extracting depth from motion, including a lateral occipital region, five sites along the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and two ventral occipital regions. Control experiments confirmed that this pattern of activation is most strongly correlated with perceived three-dimensional structure, in as much as it arises from motion and cannot be attributed to numerous two-dimensional image properties or to saliency."
https://openalex.org/W2023588410,"Chicken ovalbumin upstream promotor-transcription factor I (COUP-TFI), an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is highly expressed in the developing nervous systems. In the cerebral cortex of Coup-tfl mutants, cortical layer IV was absent due to excessive cell death, a consequence of the failure of thalamocortical projections. Moreover, subplate neurons underwent improper differentiation and premature cell death during corticogenesis. Our results indicate that the subplate neuron defects lead to the failure of guidance and innervation of thalamocortical projections. Thus, our findings demonstrate a critical role of the subplate in early corticothalamic connectivity and confirm the importance of afferent innervation for the survival of layer IV neurons. These results also substantiate COUP-TFI as an important regulator of neuronal development and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2000814069,"The Eph receptor VAB-1 is required in neurons for epidermal morphogenesis during C. elegans embryogenesis. Two models were proposed for the non-autonomous role of VAB-1: neuronal VAB-1 might signal directly to epidermis, or VAB-1 signaling between neurons might be required for epidermal development. We show that the ephrin VAB-2 (also known as EFN-1) is a ligand for VAB-1 and can function in neurons to regulate epidermal morphogenesis. In the absence of VAB-1 signaling, ephrin-expressing neurons are disorganized. vab-2/efn-1 mutations synergize with vab-1 kinase alleles, suggesting that VAB-2/EFN-1 may partly function in a kinase-independent VAB-1 pathway. Our data indicate that ephrin signaling between neurons is required nonautonomously for epidermal morphogenesis in C. elegans."
https://openalex.org/W2020246535,"The fluorescent probe FM1-43 has been used extensively for imaging vesicle recycling; however, high nonspecific adsorption resulting in elevated background levels has precluded its use in certain tissues, notably brain slices. We have found that a sulfobutylated derivative of beta-cyclodextrin (ADVASEP-7) has a higher affinity for FM1-43 than the plasma membrane. ADVASEP-7 was used as a carrier to remove FM1-43 nonspecifically bound to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane or extracellular molecules, significantly reducing background staining. This has enabled us to visualize synaptic vesicle recycling in the nematode C. elegans, intact lamprey spinal cord, and rat brain slices."
https://openalex.org/W1976800670,"During the metamorphosis of the Xenopus laevis retina, thyroid hormone (TH) preferentially induces ventral ciliary marginal zone (CMZ) cells to both increase their proliferation and give rise to ipsilaterally projecting ganglion cells. Here we show that dorsal CMZ cells express type III deiodinase (D3), an enzyme that inactivates TH. The dorsal CMZ cells can be induced to proliferate if deiodinase activity is inhibited. D3 or dominant-negative thyroid hormone receptor transgenes inhibit both TH-induced proliferation of the ventral CMZ cells and the formation of the ipsilateral projection. Thus, the localized expression of D3 in the dorsal CMZ cells accounts for the asymmetric growth of the frog retina."

https://openalex.org/W2026456841,"Endogenous high-affinity Ca2+ buffering and its roles were investigated in mouse cerebellar Purkinje cells with the use of a low-affinity Ca2+ indicator and a high-affinity caged Ca2+ compound. Increases in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) were markedly facilitated during repetitive depolarization, resulting in the generation of steep micromolar Ca2+ gradients along dendrites. Such supralinear Ca2+ responses were attributed to the saturation of a large concentration (0.36 mM) of a mobile, high-affinity (dissociation constant, 0.37 μM) Ca2+ buffer with cooperative Ca2+ binding sites, resembling calbindin-D28K, and to an immobile, low-affinity Ca2+ buffer. These data suggest that the high-affinity Ca2+ buffer operates as the neuronal computational element that enables efficient coincidence detection of the Ca2+ signal and that facilitates spatiotemporal integration of the Ca2+ signal at submicromolar [Ca2+]i."
https://openalex.org/W1992679778,"GABAergic, somatostatin-containing bitufted interneurons in layer 2/3 of rat neocortex are excited via glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) by pyramidal neurons located in the same cortical layer. Pair recordings showed that short bursts of backpropagating dendritic action potentials (APs) reduced the amplitude of unitary EPSPs. EPSP depression was dependent on a rise in dendritic [Ca2+]. The effect was blocked by the GABA(B) receptor (GABA(B)-R) antagonist CGP55845A and was mimicked by the GABA(B)-R agonist baclofen. As presynaptic GABA(B)-Rs were activated neither by somatostatin nor by GABA released from axon collaterals of the bitufted cell, we conclude that GABA(B)-Rs were activated by a retrograde messenger, most likely GABA, released from the dendrite. Because synaptic depression was prevented by loading bitufted neurons with GDP-beta-S, it is likely to be caused by exocytotic GABA release from dendrites."
https://openalex.org/W2123200809,"The neural basis for the effects of color and contrast on perceived speed was examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Responses to S cone (blue–yellow) and L + M cone (luminance) patterns were measured in area V1 and in the motion area MT+. The MT+ responses were quantitatively similar to perceptual speed judgments of color patterns but not to color detection measures. We also measured cortical motion responses in individuals lacking L and M cone function (S cone monochromats). The S cone monochromats have clear motion-responsive regions in the conventional MT+ position, and their contrast–response functions there have twice the responsivity of S cone contrast–response functions in normal controls. But, their responsivity is far lower than the normals' responsivity to luminance contrast. Thus, the powerful magnocellular input to MT+ is either weak or silent during photopic vision in S cone monochromats."
https://openalex.org/W1994265088,"The formation of the cerebellar circuitry depends on the outgrowth of connections between the two principal classes of neurons, granule neurons and Purkinje neurons. To identify genes that function in axon outgrowth, we have isolated a mouse homolog of C. elegans UNC51, which is required for axon formation, and tested its function in cerebellar granule neurons. Murine Unc51.1 encodes a novel serine/threonine kinase and is expressed in granule cells in the cerebellar cortex. Retroviral infection of immature granule cells with a dominant negative Unc51.1 results in inhibition of neurite outgrowth in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, infected neurons fail to express TAG-1 or neuron-specific beta-tubulin, suggesting that development is arrested prior to this initial step of differentiation. Thus, Unc51.1 signals the program of gene expression leading to the formation of granule cell axons."

https://openalex.org/W2165656610,"The relationship between the neural processing of color and motion information has been a contentious issue in visual neuroscience. We examined this relationship directly by measuring neural responses to isoluminant S cone signals in extrastriate area MT of the macaque monkey. S cone stimuli produced robust, direction-selective responses at most recording sites, indicating that color signals are present in MT. While these responses were unequivocal, S cone contrast sensitivity was, on average, 1.0–1.3 log units lower than luminance contrast sensitivity. The presence of S cone responses and the relative sensitivity of MT neurons to S cone and luminance signals agree with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements in human MT+. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that color signals in MT influence behavior in speed judgment tasks."

https://openalex.org/W2088976329,"During intense presynaptic activity, the readily releasable pool (RRP) of synaptic vesicles empties more quickly than it can be refilled, and short-term depression results. Ordinarily, the pool refills within 20 s, but long, high-frequency trains of action potentials often induce a form of short-term depression that persists for a much longer time. Here, we report that replenishment of the RRP is governed by two simple processes: the previously identified mechanism termed refilling, and another process that appears after extensive exocytosis and produces a transient decrease in the capacity of the pool, lasting for several minutes. The data presented here place stringent constraints on the types of kinetic models that can be used to describe synaptic vesicular cycling and are inconsistent with the traditional multipool models of vesicular mobilization."
https://openalex.org/W2160001275,"Fluorescence imaging of presynaptic uptake and release of styryl dyes such as FM1-43 has provided valuable insights into synaptic function. However, in studies of CNS neurons, the utility of these dyes has been severely limited by nonsynaptic background fluorescence. This has thwarted the use of FM dyes in systems more intact than dissociated neuronal cultures. Here, we describe an approach to selectively reduce undesired fluorescence through quenching of the surface-bound FM1-43 signal. The introduction of sulforhodamine, a fluorophore that is not taken up by synaptic vesicles, selectively reduced the nonsynaptic fluorescence in FM1-43-labeled hippocampal cultures. When applied to rat hippocampal slices, this procedure allowed us to observe activity-dependent staining and destaining of functional synapses. Extending the usefulness of styryl dyes to slice preparations may help make functional synaptic networks amenable to optical measurements."
https://openalex.org/W2002967827,"The influence of contrast and color on perceived motion was measured using a speed-matching task. Observers adjusted the speed of an L cone contrast pattern to match that of a variety of colored test patterns. The dependence of speed on test contrast was the same for all test colors measured, differing only by a sensitivity factor. This result suggests that the reduced apparent speed of low contrast targets and certain colored targets is caused by a common cortical mechanism. The cone contrast levels that equate perceived speed differ substantially from those that equate visibility. This result suggests that the neural mechanisms governing speed perception and visibility differ. Perceived speed differences caused by variations in color can be explained by color responses that are characteristic of motion-selective cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2131314031,"Physiological, computational, and psychophysical studies of stereopsis have assumed that the perceived surface structure of binocularly viewed images is primarily specified by the pattern of binocular disparities in the two eyes' views. A novel set of stereoscopic phenomena are reported that demonstrate the insufficiency of this view. It is shown that the visual system computes the contrast relationships along depth discontinuities to infer the depth, lightness, and opacity of stereoscopically viewed surfaces. A novel theoretical framework is introduced to explain these results. It is argued that the visual system contains mechanisms that enforce two principles of scene interpretation: a generic view principle that determines qualitative scene geometry, and anchoring principles that determine how image data are quantitatively partitioned between different surface attributes."
https://openalex.org/W2060774141,"Regulation of the period (per) gene is a critical feature of circadian clock function in insects. Here, we show that per is sex-linked in the silkmoth, Antheraea per-nyi. The previously described silkmoth per gene is found on the Z chromosome. Silkmoth per is not dosage compensated at either the RNA or the protein level. Although earlier studies showed the presence of an oscillating endogenous antisense per transcript, we show that this transcript comes from a locus on the female-specific W chromosome. We further demonstrate the presence of a homolog of per on W that encodes a truncated protein. Rhythmicity of male (ZZ) moths demonstrates that neither of the W-linked per-like genes is essential for clock function. The presence of a per allele with duplications on W provides insight into the evolution of the sex chromosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1990579148,"Neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NIs) are ubiquitin-positive protein aggregates that have recently been described as a common ultrastructural feature of several neurodegenerative polyglutamine repeat expansion disorders, including Huntington's disease and the spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). Some early reports speculated that formation of such inclusions might be the key toxic event in this group of disorders. However, the pathological role of NIs has been controversial. Are these inclusions a proximate cause of cellular pathology, a protective reaction to it, or entirely beside the point? New work, including a paper by 1Cummings C.J. Reinstein E. Sun Y. Antalffy B. Jiang Y.-H. Ciechanover A. Orr H.T. Beaudet A.L. Zoghbi H.Y Neuron. 1999; 24 (this issue,): 879-892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar in this issue of Neuron, shows that large inclusions are at least not required for expanded polyglutamine pathology and raise new questions about pathological mechanisms in this group of disorders. Recent evidence suggests that large inclusions are not required for toxicity in polyglutamine repeat expansions. First, cells from SCA2 patients reportedly lack such inclusions (3Huynh D.P. Del Bigio M.R. Ho D.H. Pulst S.M Ann. Neurol. 1999; 45: 232-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Second, preventing inclusions through protein engineering does not block polyglutamine-dependent pathology induced by expanded ataxin-1 in mice (6Klement I.A. Skinner P.A. Kaytor M.D. Yi H.

Greenberg M.E Cell. 1998; 95: 55-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). Both normal huntingtin and ataxin-1 are degraded by a ubiquitin–proteasome pathway, in which addition of ubiquitin by specific ligases marks the protein for degradation by proteasome. NIs from both patient materials and animal models show high ubiquitin content and colocalization of proteasomes. 1Cummings C.J. Reinstein E. Sun Y. Antalffy B. Jiang Y.-H. Ciechanover A. Orr H.T. Beaudet A.L. Zoghbi H.Y Neuron. 1999; 24 (this issue,): 879-892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar show that although wild-type and expanded ataxin-1 are similarly ubiquitinated, the expanded protein is selectively resistant to degradation and forms ubiquitin-positive, detergent-insoluble aggregates. Inhibition of proteasome activity with β-lactone increases the frequency of ubiquitin-positive NIs in HeLa cells transfected with expanded ataxin-1, suggesting that proteasomes either degrade the expanded ataxin-1 monomers before they form large aggregates or degrade the inclusions themselves. Strikingly, genetic loss of an E3 ubiquitin ligase (E6-AP) blocks formation of NIs but accelerates the pathology associated with expanded ataxin-1. The genetic interaction between expanded ataxin-1 and E6-AP raises interesting questions and places new constraints on models for the mechanism of polyglutamine-induced neurodegeneration. E6-AP is encoded by an imprinted gene, Ube3a, implicated in the mental retardation and other neurological features of Angelman syndrome. Loss of the maternal copy of Ube3a in mice results in developmental and cognitive defects reminiscent of some features of Angelman syndrome and altered turnover of p53 protein, but no overt cellular pathology (4Jiang Y.H. Armstrong D. Albrecht U. Atkins C.M. Noebels J.L. Eichele G. Sweatt J.D. Beaudet A.L Neuron. 1998; 21: 799-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). In 1Cummings C.J.

Zoghbi H.Y Neuron. 1999; 24 (this issue,): 879-892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, transgenic mice expressing an expanded allele of ataxin-1 (line B05) that lack maternal Ube3a expression (Ube3a(m−/p+)) show much more rapid onset of SCA1-like pathology than transgenic mice that express Ube3a. However, it is unclear whether ataxin-1 is a direct target of E6-AP. Indeed, ataxin-1 is polyubiquitinated in Ube3a(m−/p+) mice. These results could be interpreted several ways. The least interesting interpretation is that E6-AP deficiency may simply lower the threshold for cellular pathology initiated by the expanded ataxin-1 in a relatively nonspecific manner: sick plus sick equals sicker. Alternatively, E6-AP may directly ubiquitinate ataxin-1 or an essential cofactor for initiating pathology. Ataxin-1 or its cofactor may be ubiquitinated by alternative ligases in the absence of E6-AP, but the alternative use of isozymes may alter the kinetics of ubiquitination or its coupling (by spatial or association constraints) to proteasomal degradation. Most of the recent data, including those in 1Cummings C.J. Reinstein E. Sun Y. Antalffy B. Jiang Y.-H. Ciechanover A. Orr H.T. Beaudet A.L. Zoghbi H.Y Neuron. 1999; 24 (this issue,): 879-892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, argue that formation of large intranuclear inclusions is not the main cellular insult in expanded polyglutamine repeat diseases. Rather, the expanded polyglutamine tracts themselves are toxic and their incorporation into inclusions may, if anything, reduce the cellular impact by sequestering them away from other cellular components. However, a role for smaller, submicroscopic aggregates remains possible. This leaves open the question of how polyglutamine repeat expansions cause disease. Two general models now seem the most plausible (however, this riddle may have more than one right answer!). A synthetic framework encompassing both models is shown in the figure. In Model 1, expanded polyglutamine-containing protein (working alone or in aggregates) associates with the proteasome but resists degradation; this may tie up proteasome activity nonproductively, decreasing its availability to degrade other key targets and thus disrupting the normal catabolism of one or more important regulatory proteins. For example, the best-characterized target of E6-AP is p53. p53 is proapoptotic, and cell death in several polyglutamine expansion models is caspase dependent (7Ona V.O. Li M. Vonsattel J.P.G. Andrews L.J. Khan S.Q. Chung W.M. Frey A.S. Menon A.S. Li X. Stieg P.E. et al.Nature. 1999; 399: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 9Sánchez I. Xu C. Juo P. Akira A. Bienis J. Yuan J Neuron. 1999; 22: 623-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In Model 2, expanded polyglutamine proteins bind other proteins necessary for cell function into a nonproductive complex, disrupting the balance of key cell regulators. Polyglutamine has been described as a transcriptional modulator (2Gerber H.P. Seipel K. Georgiev O. Höfferer M. Hug M. Rusconi S. Schaffner W Science. 1994; 263: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar), and several nuclear proteins with regulatory functions (CBP, TATA-BP, and EYA) have been observed in coaggregates with expanded polyglutamines in model systems (8Perez M.K. Paulson H.L. Pendse S.J. Saionz S.J. Bonini N.M. Pittman R.N J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 5Kazantsev A. Preisinger E. Dranovsky A. Goldgaber D. Housman D Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 11404-11409Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin-mediated degradation (or self-aggregation) of expanded ataxin-1 could limit its ability to bind such proteins. A feature of both models is that neurotoxicity should roughly correspond to the available surface area of the misfolded and/or aggregated protein. This agrees well with the observation that disruption of NIs can increase toxicity. Thus, any treatment that partially disrupts the formation or maintenance of inclusions without reducing the mass of constituent protein would be expected to exacerbate the disease. The most promising therapeutic targets might therefore be misfolded protein or components of regulatory pathways disrupted by expanded polyglutamine repeats rather than the protein aggregates themselves. However, it remains to be seen whether such regulatory pathways can be identified and whether this kettle of herring will at last satisfy the palate."

Due to the ideal biochemical accessibility of synaptic vesicles, most of their protein components have been purified and cloned during the last 15 years; one of the first such components biochemically identified was SV2 (4Buckley K. Kelly R.B J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1284-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). However, in the case of many synaptic vesicle proteins, including SV2, scientific progress beyond the identification of structures, localizations, and interaction partners was slow; functions for synaptic vesicle proteins remained elusive. As of today, this is no longer true for SV2 proteins. SV2 is a component of all synaptic vesicles in all vertebrates (10Lowe A.W. Madeddu L. Kelly R.B J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The elucidation of the primary structure of SV2 gave rise to great hopes for a swift determination of SV2 function in the central nervous system. Vertebrates express a family of three SV2 isoforms, SV2A, SV2B, and SV2C (2Bajjalieh S.M. Peterson K. Shingal R. Scheller R.H Science. 1992; 257: 1271-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 3Bajjalieh S.M. Peterson K. Linial M. Scheller R.H Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Caron M.G FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 115-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Their primary structure and—more strikingly—their common domain structure, with 12 potential transmembrane segments and cytoplasmic N and C termini, is reminiscent of bacterial and eukaryotic transporters (2Bajjalieh S.M. Peterson K. Shingal R. Scheller R.H Science. 1992; 257: 1271-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 6Faeny M.B. Lee S. Edwards R.H. Buckley K.M Cell. 1992; 70: 861-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 8Janz R. Hofmann K. Südhof T.C J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9269-9281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, there are no invertebrate orthologs of SV2, leading to the suggestion that SV2s represent an evolutionarily late aquisition of vertebrates that may originate from a distantly related ancestor, SVOP, that is also expressed in C. elegans and Drosophila (8Janz R. Hofmann K. Südhof T.C J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9269-9281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). But what—if anything—do SV2s transport? SV2s do not represent classical neurotransmitter transporters. Rather, they are most closely related to prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins involved in facilitated ion transport (8Janz R. Hofmann K. Südhof T.C J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9269-9281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of ion transporters on synaptic vesicles has long been postulated as necessary to guarantee osmotic balance and compensatory ion fluxes during neurotransmitter sequestration. However, transport substrates of SV2s have yet to be identified. Indeed, SV2s may not be transporters after all. Alternative hypotheses of SV2 function include a role for their highly glycosylated intravesicular domains in trapping soluble neurotransmitter molecules to diminish the intravesicular osmotic pressure, as has been observed in large dense-core vesicles (1Alvarez de Toledo G. Fernandez-Chacon R. Fernandez J.M Nature. 1993; 363: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar); a role in modifying synaptic vesicle exocytosis by binding to synaptotagmin I (12Schivell A.E. Batchelor R.H. Bajjalieh S.M J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27770-27775Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar); and a role as scaffold proteins that regulate vesicle shape or steps in vesicle trafficking (8Janz R. Hofmann K. Südhof T.C J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9269-9281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In many cases where conventional biochemical and cell biological attempts to determine the function of a protein have failed, genetic analyses in model organisms have proven useful. Two studies on deletion mutant mice now demonstrate that this is also true for SV2s. In a systematic mouse genetic approach, 9Janz R. Goda Y. Geppert M. Missler M. Südhof T.C Neuron, this issue. 1999; 1003–1016Google Scholar( [this issue of Neuron]) generated knockouts of SV2A and SV2B, as well as SV2A/SV2B double knockouts, and performed a detailed electrophysiological analysis in microdot cultures of individual primary hippocampal neurons. 5Crowder K.M. Gunther J.M. Jones T.A. Hale B.D. Zhang H.Z. Peterson M.R. Scheller R.H. Chavkin C. Bajjalieh S.M Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 15268-15273Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar studied the phenotype of their own line of SV2A knockouts in hippocampal slices. The respective results are striking, and the differences between the two experimental paradigms result in intriguing discrepancies between the two studies. Mice lacking the most widely expressed SV2A isoform suffer from strong epileptic seizures and die within 3 weeks after birth (5Crowder K.M. Gunther J.M. Jones T.A. Hale B.D. Zhang H.Z. Peterson M.R. Scheller R.H. Chavkin C. Bajjalieh S.M Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 15268-15273Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 9Janz R. Goda Y. Geppert M. Missler M. Südhof T.C Neuron, this issue. 1999; 1003–1016Google Scholar). In contrast, mutants lacking SV2B, which is expressed in a subset of SV2A-expressing neurons, show no obvious phenotypic changes, and the epileptic phenotype of SV2A mutants is not aggravated by additional loss of SV2B (9Janz R. Goda Y. Geppert M. Missler M. Südhof T.C Neuron, this issue. 1999; 1003–1016Google Scholar). While both studies agree on the epileptic behavorial phenotype of the SV2A knockout (and in the case of Janz et al., the double SV2A/SV2B knockout as well), electrophysiological analyses of synaptic transmission in the two preparations point to conflicting theories for the underlying mechanism. One seemingly straightforward explanation for the epileptic phenotype of SV2A knockouts emerges from analyses of spontaneous events in mutant hippocampal slices (5Crowder K.M. Gunther J.M. Jones T.A. Hale B.D. Zhang H.Z. Peterson M.R. Scheller R.H. Chavkin C. Bajjalieh S.M Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 15268-15273Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). In this preparation, spontaneous action potential–dependent inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) measured in CA3 pyramidal cells from 9- to 12-day-old SV2A mutants are drastically reduced in frequency and amplitude, whereas action potential–independent miniature IPSCs are normal (5Crowder K.M. Gunther J.M. Jones T.A. Hale B.D. Zhang H.Z. Peterson M.R. Scheller R.H. Chavkin C. Bajjalieh S.M Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 15268-15273Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). This would indicate that loss of SV2A leads to a reduced efficacy of release, which then causes the observed seizures. However, the whole story is more complicated, as an equally straightforward but different mechanistic interpretation arises from the analysis of synaptic transmission in cultured hippocampal neurons. Detailed analyses of glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission in cultures from SV2A and SV2B knockout mice found no differences in evoked responses or short-term depression compared to wild-type controls. Only when both isoforms are deleted are mutant synapses affected, and even in this case it is only glutamatergic and not GABAergic synapses that are altered. (9Janz R. Goda Y. Geppert M. Missler M. Südhof T.C Neuron, this issue. 1999; 1003–1016Google Scholar). Despite the lack of any observable ultrastructural changes in the glutamatergic synapses in the SV2A/SV2B double knockout mice, synaptic trains from these glutamatergic cells show transient facilitation and less depression during repetitive stimulation at 2–10 Hz compared to wild-type controls (9Janz R. Goda Y. Geppert M. Missler M. Südhof T.C Neuron, this issue. 1999; 1003–1016Google Scholar). This effect is reversed by EGTA-AM pretreatment, suggesting a role for Ca2+. 9Janz R. Goda Y. Geppert M. Missler M. Südhof T.C Neuron, this issue. 1999; 1003–1016Google Scholar suggest that presynaptic terminals of double mutant neurons accumulate abnormally high Ca2+ levels during repetitive stimulation that can not be removed at normal rates. Thus, while the analysis of transmission in slices from SV2A knockout mice suggests that seizures result from a selective deficit in inhibitory synaptic transmission (5Crowder K.M. Gunther J.M. Jones T.A. Hale B.D. Zhang H.Z. Peterson M.R. Scheller R.H. Chavkin C. Bajjalieh S.M Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 15268-15273Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), the analysis of synaptic transmission in culture suggests that they arise from transiently increased excitatory activity (9Janz R. Goda Y. Geppert M. Missler M. Südhof T.C Neuron, this issue. 1999; 1003–1016Google Scholar). The above survey of key data from the two studies on SV2 mutant mice leaves us with one major problem: why is GABAergic transmission in hippocampal slices from SV2A knockouts strongly reduced, while individual GABAergic neurons in hippocampal primary cultures are normal? With the available data, this problem cannot be resolved. The two sets of data could, in principle, be reconciled by assuming that the reduction in GABAergic transmission observed in slices is secondary to an altered network activity. However, the decreases in spontaneous IPSCs were measured in the presence of glutamate receptor blockers, indicating that the reduced GABAergic activity may result from an intrinsic reduction of release from GABAergic neurons. Other possible explanations for the discrepancy between the slice and culture experiments would be that the GABAergic neurons that are affected in slices do not develop in culture, or that cultured neurons are simply different from those in slices. Assuming that the somewhat contradictory findings in slices and cultures can some day be reconciled, what then is the mechanism by which SV2 proteins alter neurotransmitter release? SV2s are not essential for synaptic transmission and do not regulate the basic vesicular transmitter loading and fusion machinery (5Crowder K.M. Gunther J.M. Jones T.A. Hale B.D. Zhang H.Z. Peterson M.R. Scheller R.H. Chavkin C. Bajjalieh S.M Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 15268-15273Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 9Janz R. Goda Y. Geppert M. Missler M. Südhof T.C Neuron, this issue. 1999; 1003–1016Google Scholar). 9Janz R. Goda Y. Geppert M. Missler M. Südhof T.C Neuron, this issue. 1999; 1003–1016Google Scholar suggest that SV2s act by binding Ca2+ or, more likely, by pumping excess presynaptic Ca2+ into vesicles. The conserved presence of negatively charged residues in the first transmembrane domain of SV2s would agree with such a function. This hypothesis is fascinating, because it implies that synaptic vesicle SV2 acts in parallel with other presynaptic Ca2+ buffers and plasma membrane pumps to control Ca2+ levels in presynaptic terminals during stimulation. Indeed, the idea of synaptic vesicles being able to sequester Ca2+ is not altogether new. In several studies from the premolecular era of synaptic vesicle research, the presence of a Ca2+ uptake system and high Ca2+ concentrations in the vesicle lumen were reported (reviewed by 11Oorschot D.E. Jones D.G In Current Topics in Research on Synapses. John Wiley and Sons, New York1987Google Scholar). However, subsequent work suggested that the observed vesicular Ca2+ uptake activity resulted—at least in part—from membrane contaminations of nonvesicular origin. To date, evidence for the dynamic regulation of presynaptic Ca2+ levels by synaptic vesicles is sparse. On the other hand, a nerve terminal is packed with synaptic vesicles, each of which carries one to three copies of SV2. These could, in principle, contribute significantly to Ca2+ clearance during/after an action potential. Fortunately, the idea of SV2s being Ca2+ transporters or Ca2+ binding proteins is readily testable, and future experiments will most likely resolve this issue. Apart from the Ca2+ transporter model, other models of SV2 function are compatible with aspects of the SV2A and SV2A/SV2B knockout phenotype. As one alternative, both 9Janz R. Goda Y. Geppert M. Missler M. Südhof T.C Neuron, this issue. 1999; 1003–1016Google Scholar and 5Crowder K.M. Gunther J.M. Jones T.A. Hale B.D. Zhang H.Z. Peterson M.R. Scheller R.H. Chavkin C. Bajjalieh S.M Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 15268-15273Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar suggest a role of SV2s as Ca2+-dependent regulators of the release machinery. In one version of this model, SV2A binds synaptotagmin I, a synaptic vesicle protein that is thought to act as the exocytotic Ca2+ sensor (12Schivell A.E. Batchelor R.H. Bajjalieh S.M J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27770-27775Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, even within the domain of a speculative model, the data from slice and culture point to different signs for the proposed interactions between SVs and synaptotagmin I. 5Crowder K.M. Gunther J.M. Jones T.A. Hale B.D. Zhang H.Z. Peterson M.R. Scheller R.H. Chavkin C. Bajjalieh S.M Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 15268-15273Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar suggest that SV2A participates in the Ca2+ triggering of exocytosis by positively regulating the Ca2+ sensor synaptotagmin I. Lack of SV2A in the affected GABAergic neurons would therefore result in a less efficient/sensitive Ca2+ sensor, which in turn would lead to decreases in action potential–dependent GABA release. To interpret the data from hippocampal cultures in terms of SV2/synaptotagmin I interactions, one would have to propose that SV2s act as negative regulators of synaptotagmin I, since glutamatergic release is enhanced. The two new papers on SV2 deletion mutant mice make an important step toward the elucidation of SV2 function. They show that SV2A is an essential protein (in contrast to several other synaptic vesicle components): if you don't have it, you'll die. More importantly, fascinating models of SV2 function are presented. Clearly, additional studies are needed to test the proposed hypotheses. The studies by 9Janz R. Goda Y. Geppert M. Missler M. Südhof T.C Neuron, this issue. 1999; 1003–1016Google Scholar on mutant primary neurons suggest a novel mechanism to control Ca2+ levels in presynaptic terminals. Their idea of SV2s serving as vesicular Ca2+ transporters or Ca2+ binding proteins should and can be tested directly. Also, a quantitative analysis of absolute evoked response amplitudes to detect subtle changes in transmitter release for both glutamatergic and GABAergic cells would provide a helpful complement to the present culture data. On the other hand, in order to definitively conclude a neurotransmitter-specific effect of the SV2A knockout, it would be important to complement the data by 5Crowder K.M. Gunther J.M. Jones T.A. Hale B.D. Zhang H.Z. Peterson M.R. Scheller R.H. Chavkin C. Bajjalieh S.M Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

You would be confused to see the sky in front of you and would worry that if you took a step to the rear you would smash into the ground. This could never happen unless you lived in a Kafka-esque story and had been transformed into a giant clawed frog. Xenopus really do experience such a change in the position of their eyes during their Metamorphosis, but they have an antidote to this disorienting morphogenetic movement.In Xenopus, the laterally positioned eyes of the filter-feeding tadpole move dorsally and frontally during metamorphosis, which results in the predatory frog's binocular overlapping visual field (4xGrobstein, P. and Comer, C. Nature. 1977; 269: 54–56Crossref | PubMed | Scopus (18)See all References, 3xGrant, S. and Keating, M.J. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1986; 92: 43–69PubMedSee all References). Unlike the retina in mammals or birds, the frog retina continues to grow throughout life by adding newly born cells to the ciliary marginal zone (CMZ) at the periphery (2xGlucksmann, A. Brit. J. Ophthalmol. 1940; 24: 153–178Crossref | PubMedSee all References, 9xPerron, M., Kanekar, S., Vetter, M.L., and Harris, W.A. Dev. Biol. 1998; 199: 185–200Crossref | PubMed | Scopus (237)See all References). It has long been known that retinal growth in the ventral CMZ is much greater than in the dorsal CMZ during and after metamorphosis (5xHollyfield, J.G. Dev. Biol. 1971; 24: 264–286Crossref | PubMed | Scopus (54)See all References, 10xStraznicky, K. and Tay, D. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1977; 40: 175–185PubMedSee all References, 1xBeach, D.H. and Jacobson, M. J. Comp. Neurol. 1979; 183: 603–613Crossref | PubMedSee all References). This asymmetrical growth pattern displaces the “old” retina dorsally and compensates for the dorsal movement of the eyes (see figure). Thus, a particular locus in the “old” retina continues to represent a similar location in the space in relation to the body, reducing the mismatch between the “interocular” and “visuosomatic” map (Grant and Keating 1986xGrant, S. and Keating, M.J. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1986; 92: 43–69PubMedSee all ReferencesGrant and Keating 1986). Thyroid hormone is a key molecule during metamorphosis and is involved in a variety of processes, including the generation of an ipsilateral retinal projection that serves binocular vision (Hoskins 1986xHoskins, S.G. J. Neurobiol. 1986; 17: 203–229Crossref | PubMedSee all ReferencesHoskins 1986). Thyroxine can cause the asymmetrical growth pattern precociously in premetamorphic tadpoles, and an inhibitor of thyroid hormone synthesis can block the differential growth pattern, suggesting that thyroid hormone is sufficient and necessary for the changes in retinal growth during metamorphosis (Hoskins 1986xHoskins, S.G. J. Neurobiol. 1986; 17: 203–229Crossref | PubMedSee all ReferencesHoskins 1986). However, the molecular mechanism by which the hormone elicits differential growth in the dorsal and ventral CMZ has been an open question, since the receptors for thyroid hormone are expressed ubiquitously in the nervous system and equally in the dorsal and ventral CMZ (Kawahara et al. 1991xKawahara, A., Baker, B.S., and Tata, J.R. Development. 1991; 112: 933–943PubMedSee all ReferencesKawahara et al. 1991). In this issue of Neuron, Marsh-Armstrong et al. 1999xMarsh-Armstrong, N., Huang, H., Remo, B.F., Liu, T.T., and Brown, D.D. Neuron. 1999; 24: 871–878Abstract | Full Text | Full Text PDF | PubMedSee all ReferencesMarsh-Armstrong et al. 1999 give a final answer to this long unsolved problem by analyzing the function of D3, an enzyme that inactivates thyroid hormone, in the metamorphosing retina.Earlier work from the same lab (Wang and Brown 1993xWang, Z. and Brown, D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16270–16278PubMedSee all ReferencesWang and Brown 1993) characterized a number of genes that are induced in response to thyroid hormone. In the present paper, by screening hormone-responsive genes in the metamorphosing retina, Marsh-Armstrong et al. found that D3 was expressed highly in the dorsal CMZ but not in the ventral CMZ. D3 is a member of a class of enzymes called deiodinases, which inactivate thyroid hormone by catalyzing the removal of iodine from the inner ring. When the function of D3 was inactivated by iopanoic acid (IOPA), a specific inhibitor of the enzyme, the asymmetric growth pattern in response to thyroid hormone was lost, and both dorsal and ventral CMZ grew equally. In complementary experiments, they introduced a D3 transgene under the control of a ubiquitous or neuron-specific promotor, which resulted in the inhibition of the growth burst in the ventral retina during metamorphosis. These results clearly show that the expression of D3 in the dorsal CMZ inactivates thyroid hormone locally, which prevents the cells from responding to the high level of circulating thyroid hormone during the metamorphic climax.The steroid hormones are known to regulate various aspects of nervous system development, and there are several cellular mechanisms to regulate the region-specific responses. The first mechanism, commonly found in other endocrine systems, is the expression of the receptor only in target tissues. The second is the expression of different receptor subtypes in each target organ. A striking example of this strategy is found in insect metamorphosis. In Drosophila, it has been established that the differential responses to ecdysone, a steroid hormone that induces metamorphosis in insects, are regulated by the discrete expression of specific receptor subtypes (Talbot et al. 1993xTalbot, W.S., Swyryd, E.A., and Hogness, D.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 1323–1337Abstract | Full Text PDF | PubMed | Scopus (404)See all ReferencesTalbot et al. 1993). The tissues that follow the same fate (proliferation, differentiation, cell death) during metamorphosis have the same expression patterns of ecdysone receptor A and ecdysone receptor B. The third mechanism, as shown by Marsh-Armstrong et al. in this issue, is the inactivation of the ligand in a region-specific manner. It would be intriguing to know if similar regulatory mechanisms are involved in other regions of the brain or in other animals.In addition to the effect on the retinal growth, Marsh-Armstrong et al. showed a reduction in the number of ipsilaterally projecting retinal ganglion cells in the D3 transgenic frog. Since D3 reduces the proliferation in the CMZ, it is not clear if D3 overexpression directly affects the fate of the ipsilaterally projecting cells or just decreases the number of ventral ganglion cells generated during metamorphosis. Whichever the case, further study of frog metamorphosis will possibly open a door to another long-unanswered question, the differential decussation of retinal axons at the chiasm.Figure 101Image Constancy in a Metamorphosing FrogDuring metamorphosis, the tadpole retina moves dorsally to the top of the frog's head. The ventral growth of the retina (dark shadow) exceeds dorsal growth and compensates the movement of the eyes. Consequently, the same region in the retina (asterisk) can receive visual information from an object (fish) that is located “lateral” to the body.View Large Image | View Hi-Res Image | Download PowerPoint Slide"
