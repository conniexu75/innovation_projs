https://openalex.org/W2091002434,"ALTHOUGH at least ten pheromone compounds have been reported for lepidopterous species, only three1â€“3 have proved to be true sex attractants in natural field conditions. We now report that the structure of the sex attractant of the oblique-banded leaf roller Choristoneura rosaceana (Lepidoptera, Tortricidae), one of the most widely distributed North American tortricids, is cis-11-tetradecenyl acetate (I)."

Some tentative support for this hypothesis has come from a presentation by Kraushaar at the thirty-seventh IAU symposium in Rome showing that the spectrum of the OSO-3 gamma rays closely matches the gamma ray spectrum of the horizon albedo from the Earth which arises mainly from the decay of neutral pions produced by the interaction of cosmic rays with the Earth's atmosphere."
