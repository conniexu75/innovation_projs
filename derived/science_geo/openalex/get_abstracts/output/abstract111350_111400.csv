https://openalex.org/W1562615854,"Over 40 mutations in the rhodopsin gene have been identified in patients with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. Twenty-one of these mutations have been introduced into a human rhodopsin cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis, and the encoded proteins have been produced by transfection of a human embryonic kidney cell line (293S). Three of the mutant proteins (G51V, V345M, and P347S) resemble the wild type in yield, regenerability with 11-cis-retinal, and accumulation in the plasma membrane (class I). The remaining 18 mutant proteins are produced at lower levels, regenerate variably or not at all with 11-cis-retinal, and accumulate partially or predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum (class II). Together with an earlier analysis of 13 mutant rhodopsins (Sung, C.-H., Schneider, B., Agarwal, N., Papermaster, D.S., and Nathans, J. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 88, 8840-8844), these experiments define distinct classes of biochemical defects in human rhodopsin and further show that amino acid substitutions in class II reside within the transmembrane and extracellular domains, whereas class I mutants cluster in the first transmembrane domain and at the extreme carboxyl terminus."
https://openalex.org/W2107574924,"A functional cDNA clone coding for the human prostaglandin E receptor EP1 subtype has been isolated from a human erythroleukemia cell cDNA library probed by low-stringency hybridization using a polymerase chain reaction fragment of the human thromboxane receptor. The human EP1 receptor is comprised of 402 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 41,858 and has the topography common to all G-protein-coupled receptors with seven predicted transmembrane spanning domains. Prostaglandin (PG) E2 challenge of Xenopus oocytes injected with EP1 cDNA resulted in an increase in intracellular Ca2+. In addition, the rank order of potency for prostaglandins in competition for [3H]PGE2 specific binding to membranes prepared from EP1 cDNA transfected COS cells was PGE2 > PGE1 > PGF2 alpha > PGD2. Furthermore, the EP1 receptor-selective antagonists AH 6809 and SC19220 were more potent than the EP2 receptor-selective agonist butaprost in these competition binding assays. In summary, therefore, we have cloned the human EP1 receptor subtype which is functionally coupled to an increase in intracellular Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1629887654,"We have isolated complementary DNA clones coding for a novel member of the insulin-like hormone super-family from a boar testis cDNA library. Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization revealed that the gene is expressed exclusively in prenatal and postnatal Leydig cells. We have tentatively proposed the name Leydig insulin-like (Ley I-L) for the gene and its encoded protein. The Leydig insulin-like protein is synthesized as a 131-amino acid preproprotein, which contains a 24-amino acid signal peptide. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of pro-Leydig insulin-like protein with members of the insulin-like hormone superfamily predicts that the biologically active protein, after proteolytic processing of the C-peptide, consists of a 32-residue-long B-chain and a 26-residue-long A-chain and has a molecular size of 6.25 kDa."
https://openalex.org/W1595020114,"The binding affinities of 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA) and all-trans-retinoic acid (t-RA) for retinoic acid receptors (RAR) alpha, beta, and gamma and for retinoid X receptors (RXR) alpha, beta, and gamma were determined using the recombinant receptor proteins and were compared with each hormone's ability to activate transcription through the receptors in mammalian and yeast cell systems. 9-cis-RA bound to both the RXRs (Kd values = 1.4-2.4 nM) and the RARs (Kd values = 0.2-0.8 nM). The ability of 9-cis-RA to bind to the RARs and RXRs correlated with its ability to produce similar transactivation profiles with these receptors in mammalian and yeast cell assays. t-RA bound to the RARs (Kd values = 0.2-0.4 nM) and activated transcription through the RARs in mammalian and yeast cells. In contrast, while t-RA did not bind to the RXRs, it did activate the RXRs, albeit less potently than 9-cis-RA, in mammalian cells. In yeast, however, the RXRs activated transcription only in the presence of 9-cis-RA, not with t-RA. While RAR gamma is activated in yeast by either t-RA or 9-cis-RA, the overall level of transcription was increased upon the addition of hormone-occupied RXR. Metabolism studies suggest that while there was no cell-dependent interconversion between t-RA and 9-cis-RA in yeast, there was cell-dependent conversion of 9-cis-RA to t-RA in mammalian cells [corrected]."
https://openalex.org/W1676079444,"In cytochrome c oxidase the C-terminal part of subunit II is outside the membrane and contains a copper center called CuA. We have expressed this domain of the Paracoccus denitrificans oxidase in a soluble form. Data obtained by quantitative copper-to-protein measurements, electrospray mass spectrometry, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy show that the center contains two copper atoms probably in a mixed valence configuration. Its absorbance spectrum is similar to that of the copper center A in nitrous oxide reductase. The EPR spectrum suggests that the center in the soluble protein is closely related to the native CuA site in the cytochrome oxidase complex. However, it seems likely that the copper center in the soluble domain is more exposed to the aqueous milieu than in the intact complex because its absorbance and EPR spectra are sensitive to pH. At alkaline pH one of the coppers in the site acquires type-2 character, indicating that it may be coordinated to a new ligand. The pK of this reversible change is about 8.2. The CuA-binding fragment is able to oxidize cytochrome c."
https://openalex.org/W1559531158,"To address the possibility that electron transport is a biologically significant source of superoxide anion (O2-.) during exposure to hyperoxia in vivo, we constructed Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains with selective disruptions in the gene encoding the mitochondrial manganese-containing superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) and/or genes encoding proteins critical for complexes in electron transport. We hypothesized that complete absence of electron transport would restore growth in hyperoxia to a Mn-SOD-deficient yeast. We found that yeast deficient in Mn-SOD activity failed to grow normally in hyperoxia (95% O2, 5% CO2). In contrast, Mn-SOD-deficient yeast with complete absence of electron transport (the Rho 0 state) grew normally in hyperoxia. By comparison, Mn-SOD-deficient yeast which were deficient only in cytochrome-c-oxidase, the terminal step in electron transport, had only partially restored growth in hyperoxia. Our results indicate that electron transport is a major source of O2-. in vivo, and that the principal site of this O2-. production is proximal to the cytochrome-c-oxidase complex."
https://openalex.org/W1516230454,"The cell adhesion regulating extracellular matrix glycoprotein, thrombospondin (TSP), causes a loss of focal adhesion plaques from spread endothelial cells and fibroblasts. To localize the site on TSP that has focal adhesion-labilizing activity, we initially tested proteolytic fragments of TSP for activity. The heparin-binding fragment has significant focal adhesion-labilizing activity, whereas the nonheparin-binding 140-kDa fragment had no significant activity. These results were consistent with previous data that showed that both a monoclonal antibody to the heparin-binding domain of TSP (A2.5) and heparin neutralized TSP activity. Peptides from putative heparin binding sequences of the amino-terminal heparin-binding domain of TSP were synthesized and tested for their ability to cause loss of focal adhesions. The hep I peptide (amino acids 17-35) caused maximal loss of focal adhesions and was active at 0.1 microM, whereas peptide hep II (74-95) and peptide hep III (170-189) were inactive. The activity of the hep I peptide was neutralized by the addition of heparin and heparan sulfate but not by chondroitin sulfate. The basic amino acids in the hep I sequence appear to be required for focal adhesion-labilizing activity, because modification of the lysine residues at amino acids 24 and 32 rendered the peptide completely inactive. In addition, a peptide from the analogous sequence of mouse TSP 2, in which basic residues are conserved, was nearly as active as hep I from TSP1. These data show that the anti-adhesive activity of TSP is conserved in both TSP1 and TSP2 and that the active site is located in a 19-amino acid sequence in the heparin-binding domain of TSPs."
https://openalex.org/W1917323404,"Examination of cDNAs for the laminin-binding alpha 7 integrin subunit identified two different sequences (designated X1 and X2) coding for the variable region between the III and IV homology repeat domains near the putative ligand-binding site. Sequencing of a mouse alpha 7 genomic clone established that the X1 and X2 regions are derived by mutually exclusive alternative mRNA splicing. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of alpha 7 mRNA indicated that the X1 and X2 isoforms were present in equal amounts in mouse skeletal myoblasts and adult heart. However, in adult skeletal muscle, the X2 variant was exclusively expressed. Amino acid sequence homologies in the III/IV segment suggest that alpha 3 and alpha 6 are also alternatively spliced at this site. We identified alternatively spliced exons in a human alpha 6 genomic clone that encode X1- and X2-like segments. Analysis of the alpha 7 cytoplasmic domain indicated that this region was also alternatively spliced and like alpha 3 and alpha 6 could exist as the A or B form. In mouse skeletal and cardiac muscle the B form of alpha 7 was strongly expressed. However, we identified alpha 7A in neonate and adult skeletal muscle but not in cardiac tissue. High levels of alpha 7A were detected in differentiating myotubes, but in proliferating myoblasts only the alpha 7B isoform was present. These results indicate that alternative splicing of alpha 7 mRNA is differentially regulated during development and generates variant integrin chains with structurally and presumably functionally unique ligand-binding and cytoplasmic domains."
https://openalex.org/W1489146268,"We recently reported molecular cloning of the branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase, the first mitochondrial protein kinase to be cloned (Popov, K. M., Zhao, Y., Shimomura, Y., Kuntz, M. J., and Harris, R. A. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 13127-13130). From a search for proteins related to the branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase, a cDNA encoding the 434 amino acid residues corresponding to pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase has been cloned from a rat heart cDNA library. Evidence that the clone codes for pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase includes: (a) the deduced amino acid sequence is identical to the partial sequence of the kinase determined by direct sequencing; (b) expression of the cDNA in Escherichia coli resulted in synthesis of a protein that phosphorylated and inactivated the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; (c) kinase activity of the recombinant protein is sensitive to inhibition by a specific inhibitor of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase; and (d) antiserum raised against the recombinant protein recognized the protein subunit known to correspond to pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase in a highly purified preparation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Like the branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase lacks motifs usually associated with eukaryotic Ser/Thr-protein kinases. Considerable sequence similarity exists between these mitochondrial protein kinases and members of the prokaryotic histidine kinase family, a diverse set of sensing and response systems important in the regulation of bacterial processes. Thus, molecular cloning of these proteins establishes a new eukaryotic family of protein kinases that is related to a prokaryotic family of protein kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1497042513,"A chemically charged amber suppressor tRNA was used to introduce the photoactivatable amino acid (Tmd)Phe at a selected position within the signal sequence of the secretory protein preprolactin. This allowed the interactions of the NH2-terminal, the central, and the COOH-terminal regions of the signal sequence to be investigated during insertion into the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We found that different regions of the nascent chains were photocross-linked to different ER proteins. The TRAM protein (translocating chain-associating membrane protein) contacts the NH2-terminal region of the signal sequence while the mammalian Sec61p contacts the hydrophobic core of the signal sequence and regions COOH-terminal of this. These results suggest that the ER translocation complex is composed of heterologous protein subunits which contact distinct regions of nascent polypeptides during their membrane insertion."
https://openalex.org/W1523863377,"An enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of big endothelin-1 to endothelin-1, designated as endothelin-converting enzyme, was solubilized with Lubrol PX from the membrane fraction of porcine aortic endothelium and was purified by sequential chromatography on DEAE-agarose, Ricinus communis agglutinin 120-agarose, peanut agglutinin-agarose, Mono Q, and TSK G3000SWXL columns. Approximately 12,000-fold purification of the membrane fraction enzyme was achieved. The purified enzyme had a very narrow neutral pH optimum and was inhibited by EDTA, 1,10-phenanthroline, phosphoramidon, and low concentrations of some divalent cations (Cu2+,Zn2+,Co2+,Fe2+) but not by thiorphan. Addition of Zn2+ was most effective for the restoration of the EDTA-inactivated enzyme. The purified enzyme showed the highest affinity for big endothelin-1 among big endothelin isopeptides, and the Km for big endothelin-1 and the corresponding Vmax for endothelin-1 formation were 3.3 +/- 0.3 microM and 0.41 +/- 0.02 mumol/min/mg of protein, respectively. The carboxyl-terminal sequence from His27 to Gly34 and Trp21 was essential for recognition by this enzyme, while the presence of the amino-terminal loop structure reduced the hydrolysis rate. The purified enzyme showed an isoelectric point of 4.1. The molecular mass was estimated to be 131 kDa by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and a value of 120 kDa was obtained by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, indicating that endothelin-converting enzyme is a monomeric glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1568523124,"Proteolytic cleavage (nicking) of diphtheria toxin (DT) in the 14-amino acid loop subtended by the disulfide bond between Cys186 and Cys201 is required for the cytotoxic action of DT. The loop includes the consensus motif for cleavage by a membrane-anchored protease, furin. We found that a soluble form of furin cleaves intact DT between Arg103 and Ser194 in vitro. LoVo cells, a human colon carcinoma cell line, do not produce functional furin. We show here that intact DT is not cleaved by LoVo cells. The cells are resistant to intact DT, although they are sensitive to DT nicked by furin before it is added to the medium. When intact DT is added to LoVo/Fur1 cells, a stable transfectant of LoVo cells expressing mouse furin, nicked DT associated with the cells is observed. LoVo/Fur1 cells are sensitive to both intact and nicked DT. These results indicate that furin is involved in the toxicity of intact DT. Bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of intracellular vesicle acidification, did not inhibit cleavage of intact DT by LoVo/Fur1 or Vero cells, indicating that cleavage can proceed in a neutral environment. Inhibitors of endocytosis decreased DT cleavage but did not eliminate it. We also found a small amount of nicked DT in the culture medium. These results may indicate that intact DT is cleaved age by cell-associated furin on the cell surface as well as in endocytotic vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W1511576402,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1, ACE) is a transmembrane protein with a short carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a 17-amino acid hydrophobic anchor domain, and a large N-terminal extracellular region containing two catalytically homologous domains. An active soluble form of ACE circulates in human plasma and is produced in culture medium of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with the full-length human ACE cDNA. The mechanism of ACE release in CHO cells involves a post-translational proteolytic cleavage occurring in the carboxyl-terminal region. The carboxyl terminus of the secreted recombinant ACE, AGQR, was established by carboxyl-terminal microsequencing and corresponds to a cleavage site between Arg-1137 and Leu-1138. Two independent studies confirmed this proposed cleavage site: amino acid analysis of a carboxyl-terminal peptide derived from soluble ACE and immunocharacterization of membrane-bound and soluble ACE with antibodies raised against three peptides located along the carboxyl-terminal ACE sequence. In order to assess the importance of Arg-1137, this amino acid was mutated to a glutamine residue. This mutation did not prevent the secretion of ACE, suggesting that the solubilizing enzyme can accommodate this change or can use an alternative cleavage site. Finally, the production of soluble ACE in CHO cells appears to be proportional to the level of cellular ACE, implying that the solubilizing enzyme is not a limiting factor. In addition, the carboxyl-terminal sequence of the human plasma ACE was identified as AGQR, thus supporting the fact that a similar mechanism could operate in human vascular cells."
https://openalex.org/W1591439195,"We have synthesized 8-azido-cyclic ADP-ribose (8N3-cADPR) and [32P]8-azido-cyclic ADP-ribose ([32P]8N3-cADPR) in order to characterize cyclic ADP-ribose-(cADPR) binding sites in sea urchin egg homogenates. 8N3-cADPR was an antagonist of cADPR since it did not induce Ca2+ release from egg microsomes but did inhibit the ability of cADPR to do so. The effect of 8N3-cADPR was reversible and could be overcome by high concentrations of cADPR, suggesting that both were acting on the same site. This was supported by the fact that 8N3-cADPR effectively competed for [32P]cADPR binding to microsomes. Reciprocally, binding of [32P]8N3-cADPR could also be selectively displaced by cADPR and 8N3-cADPR, but not by ADP-ribose. These results indicate that 8N3-cADPR binds specifically to the cADPR-binding sites and inhibits cADPR from releasing Ca2+. Photolysis of microsomes preincubated with [32P]8N3-cADPR resulted in specific labeling of proteins of 140 and 100 kDa, which could be prevented by 8N3-cADPR or nanomolar concentrations of cADPR, but not by micromolar concentrations of ADP-ribose, AMP, ADP, ATP, cyclic AMP or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Caffeine, an agonist of Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release, preferentially inhibited the labeling of the 100 kDa as compared to the 140-kDa protein. These results suggest that cADPR may not interact directly with the ryanodine receptor, but may instead, exert its effect through intermediate proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1504320681,"We have isolated a cDNA clone encoding the cytosolic sialidase of rat skeletal muscle. Degenerate oligonucleotides, based on amino acid sequence data for the purified enzyme, were used as primers to amplify fragments of the gene from rat skeletal muscle cDNA by the polymerase chain reaction. The amplified cDNA fragment was then applied as probe to screen a rat skeletal muscle cDNA library. The longest cDNA clone thus isolated was incomplete at the 5'-end, and therefore an amplified cDNA from the 5'-end portion of the gene was further generated by polymerase chain reaction. These two cDNAs were used to construct a cDNA encoding the entire sequence of rat sialidase. The composite sequence encodes an open reading frame of 379 amino acids that include all sequenced peptides. Although the deduced amino acid sequence is not largely similar to those of bacterial and parasite sialidases, it contains two Asp blocks, the conserved sequence of the sialidases from these microorganisms. When the cDNA was inserted into an expression vector followed by transformation in Escherichia coli, sialidase activity appeared in the cell extract. The sialidase could be completely immunoprecipitated by antiserum against the cytosolic sialidase of rat skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1566749908,"The role of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase in the regulation of glucose metabolism has been investigated by comparing the effects of insulin and epidermal growth factor (EGF) on MAP kinase activation, glucose transport, and glycogen synthase in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Insulin or EGF treatment for 5 min increased p42mapk and p44mapk activity to the same extent as determined by myelin basic protein kinase activity measurements and phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. The profiles of myelin basic protein kinase activity following MonoQ chromatography of extracts obtained from cells incubated with insulin or EGF were almost identical. Insulin increased glucose transport and GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface by 15- and 7-fold, respectively. EGF had no significant effect on these processes. Insulin increased the glycogen synthase ratio (-Glc-6-P/+Glc-6-P) by 7.5- and 3.5-fold in the presence and absence of glucose, respectively. EGF increased the ratios by only 2- and 1.3-fold, respectively. EGF did not appear to inhibit downstream of MAP kinase, because when adipocytes were incubated with insulin plus EGF, the stimulation of glucose transport and glycogen synthase was similar to that observed with insulin alone. These findings indicate that activation of the MAP kinase isoforms p42mapk and p44mapk is not sufficient for the activation of glucose transport and glycogen synthase in 3T3-L1 adipocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1487549050,"L-29, a mammalian soluble lactose-binding lectin, was previously shown to be phosphorylated in confluent 3T3 fibroblasts (Cowles, E. A., Agrwal, N., Anderson, R. L., and Wang, J. L. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 17706-17712), which contain a small amount of this protein. We have determined the site of phosphorylation on L-29, taking advantage of the abundance of L-29 (about 1% of total soluble cell protein) in confluent polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Approximately 15-20% of the L-29 is phosphorylated in these cells. Phosphoamino acid analysis showed phosphate incorporation only at serine. Analysis of chymotryptic and endoproteinase Asp-N-generated NH2-terminal fragments by Edman degradation showed that 90% of the phosphate was at Ser6 and 10% at Ser12. The sequence surrounding Ser6, which is conserved in all known L-29 sequences, indicated that this serine might be phosphorylated by casein kinase I or casein kinase II. Reaction of human recombinant L-29 with [gamma-32P]ATP and each of these casein kinases showed that only casein kinase I catalyzed significant incorporation of 32P into L-29; and, as with the L-29 from the MDCK cell extracts, most of the phosphate was incorporated at Ser6 and a small amount was incorporated at Ser12."
https://openalex.org/W1620043643,"The transcript of Kv1.5, a Shaker-like delayed rectifier K+ channel cloned in our laboratory, is regulated in both tissue and developmentally specific manners. In this study we characterized the 5'-flanking region of the Kv1.5 gene. The gene lacks a canonical TATA box, has several transcription start sites, and the 5'-noncoding sequence is intronless. A cAMP response element (CRE) consensus signal was identified in the 5'-noncoding region. cAMP regulates the expression of Kv1.5 gene in a cell-specific manner. In primary cardiac cells, cAMP induces a 6-fold increase in the steady state levels of Kv1.5 transcript. However, in GH3 cells cAMP induces a 5-6-fold decrease in steady state levels of Kv1.5 transcript. The half-life of Kv1.5 transcript is 37 min and is not affected by cAMP. Nuclear run-on experiments show that in GH3 cells, cAMP reduces the transcription rate of Kv1.5 gene. Transient transfection assays using 5'-deletion mutations of Kv1.5 5'-flanking sequences revealed that the CRE located at +636 can confer the cAMP inducibility to Kv1.5 reporter gene constructs and binds to CRE-binding protein (CREB) and CRE modulator protein (CREM) in electromobility gel shift assays. Furthermore, KCl-induced depolarization can increase the steady state levels of Kv1.5 transcript in primary atrial cells and decrease it in GH3 cells. We conclude that cAMP and depolarization play an important role in regulating K+ channel expression and thus may induce long term effects on the pattern of electrical activity of excitable cells."
https://openalex.org/W1487054855,"Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I (CaM kinase I) was previously purified from bovine brain (Nairn, A. C., and Greengard, P. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 7273-7281) based on its ability to phosphorylate the synaptic vesicle protein, synapsin I at site 1. The cDNA for this protein kinase has now been cloned from both a rat and a bovine brain cDNA library and the complete amino acid sequence of rat CaM kinase I determined. The rat cDNA encoded a protein of 331 amino acids with a calculated M(r) of 37,545, and the encoded kinase was expressed in bacteria as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. The resulting fusion protein was purified by Sepharose-CaM affinity chromatography and shown to be totally dependent on Ca2+ and CaM for activity. Furthermore, the purified kinase phosphorylates synapsin I at the same site (site 1) as the endogenous brain enzyme. CaM kinase I is homologous to other known protein kinases and contains all nine invariant amino acids conserved in the catalytic domain of this class of enzymes. CaM kinase I was most identical to CaM kinase II both in the catalytic domain and in a short region at the COOH-terminal that is predicted to be the calmodulin-binding domain. CaM kinase I appeared to be encoded by a single gene. RNase protection assays detected the mRNA encoding CaM kinase I in all tissues examined. High concentrations of the kinase mRNA were found in all regions of the brain with frontal cortex showing the greatest level. CaM kinase I was autophosphorylated in a Ca2+/CaM-dependent manner at a threonyl residue (Thr-177) which is located at a position equivalent to that of the threonyl residue (Thr-197) autophosphorylated in cAMP-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1562563314,"In cultured rat cardiac myocytes, a 20-base pair sequence (-215/-196) of the rat beta-myosin heavy chain (MHC) promoter mediates induction by both alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation and a constitutively activated beta-protein kinase C (PKC), and binds cardiac myocyte nuclear factor(s) through an element (5'-TGTGG-TATG-3') (Kariya, K., Karns, L. R., and Simpson, P. C. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, in press). Here, we report identification of this enhancer core binding factor as the rat homologue of transcriptional enhancer factor-1 (TEF-1), a human transcription factor for viral enhancers. In gel mobility shift and immunoblot analyses, the myocyte factor and human TEF-1 were indistinguishable in terms of sequence recognition, mobility, and immunoreactivity. Furthermore, DNA binding activity for the beta-MHC enhancer core and TEF-1 immunoreactivity correlated closely. These results are the first to suggest a role for TEF-1 in transcriptional regulation by PKC. The data also provide direct evidence for interaction of TEF-1 with the beta-MHC promoter, supporting a function for TEF-1 in regulation of cellular gene expression, as well as viral, and outline a pathway for alpha 1-adrenergic regulation of beta-MHC gene transcription in cardiac myocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1523714793,"A lactose-binding lectin from rat lung (RL-29) and a related lectin from Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells have been analyzed with the primary goal of identifying post-translational modifications. The sequences show that RL-29 and the dog lectin are homologues of a lectin designated here as L-29 and elsewhere as CBP-35, epsilon BP, Mac-2, or L-34. RL-29 has a 140-amino-acid COOH-terminal carbohydrate-binding domain, a 20-amino-acid NH2-terminal domain, and an intervening domain consisting of 11 repeating elements rich in Pro, Gly, and Tyr (R-domain). The dog homologue has 14 repeating elements in its R-domain explaining its larger size. The sensitivity of the R-domain to bacterial collagenase allowed us to isolate the NH2-terminal domain and show that the NH2 terminus was blocked by acetylation and, in the accompanying paper (Huflejt, M. E., Turck, C. W., Lindstedt, R., Barondes, S. H., and Leffler, H. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 26712-26718), that the NH2-terminal domain is phosphorylated. In addition, we unexpectedly found an endogenous component, resembling 92-kDa type IV collagenase, that co-purified with L-29 and slowly digested the R-domain. Hence, L-29 is a substrate for bacterial and tissue collagenases even though the R-domain is non-collagenous. Moreover, the co-purification suggests a non-enzymatic interaction between 92-kDa collagenase and L-29."
https://openalex.org/W2159434963,"Fpg protein of Escherichia coli cleaves duplex DNA containing the oxidatively damaged base 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (Tchou, J., Kasai, H., Shibutani, S., Chung, M.-H., Laval, J., Grollman, A. P., and Nishimura, S. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 88, 4690-4694). This DNA repair enzyme contains one zinc atom/protein molecule (Boiteux, S., O'Connor, T. R., Lederer, F., Gougette, A., and Laval, J. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 3916-3922); its N-glycosylase and apurinic/apyrimidinic lyase activities are physically associated. Amino acid sequence analysis reveals a putative single zinc finger motif of the CC/CC type located near the carboxyl terminus. A gel mobility shift assay was used to assay binding of Fpg protein to a noncleavable substrate analog, namely an oligodeoxynucleotide duplex containing a single tetrahydrofuran residue. High resolution hydroxyl radical DNA footprinting showed protection centered around the tetrahydrofuran residue. No footprint was observed on the complementary strand. To establish the role of COOH-terminal zinc finger in DNA binding and/or DNA cleavage, amino acid substitutions and an amber mutation were introduced at Cys-244 (C244S, C244H, C244A, and C244amber). In addition, a double amino acid substitution was generated at Cys-244 and Cys-247 (C244S/C247S). These mutant Fpg proteins lack DNA binding or cleavage activity, as tested in crude lysates of Escherichia coli. Wild type Fpg protein contains one zinc/protein molecule, whereas the mutant Fpg protein (C244S/C247S) lacks zinc, as measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy. This mutation did not significantly alter secondary structure, as assessed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Our results suggest that Fpg protein utilizes its single COOH-terminal zinc finger motif in DNA binding."
https://openalex.org/W1552321587,"The expression of the synapsin I gene is neuron-specific and developmentally regulated. As a step toward characterizing the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for its transcriptional regulation in vivo, we have generated transgenic mice that carry the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) receptor gene under the control of approximately 4,300 nucleotides of 5'-flanking sequence of the rat synapsin I gene. In four independent transgenic mouse lines, high level CAT expression is observed specifically in the brain and other neural tissues. Two of these lines also exhibit notable CAT expression in testis. The transgene is expressed at similar levels in many different regions of the central nervous system. Immunohistochemical staining detects the CAT marker protein in various cell populations of neuronal morphology within the brain and the spinal cord. Transgene expression is developmentally regulated in a way that correlates well with the expression of the endogenous synapsin I gene. Both follow a characteristic, biphasic postnatal time course with a maximum around day 20. We conclude that the DNA region investigated contains cis-regulatory elements sufficient to drive the expression of a reporter gene in a spatial and temporal pattern that resembles the expression of the endogenous synapsin I gene."
https://openalex.org/W2115610944,"Most vir genes of Agrobacterium, which are required for tumorigenicity of the bacterium, are expressed in response to plant phenolics. The induction of vir is markedly enhanced by specific monosaccharides. Signals generated by both types of compound are transduced into Agrobacterium cells via the functions of the VirA membrane-bound sensor protein. A putative sugar-binding protein, known as ChvE, also functions at a step of the enhancement of vir induction by monosaccharides. To investigate the signal pathway of the enhancement by the sugars, we first isolated a virA mutant of Agrobacterium with a base substitution mutation that caused a single amino acid change in the periplasmic domain. The mutant exhibited no enhancement of vir induction by sugar and had severely attenuated tumorigenicity on Kalanchoe leaves. We then isolated two chvE mutants that restored sugar enhancement on the background of this virA mutation. One chvE mutant, which exhibited a higher level of sugar enhancement, restored the tumorigenicity of the virA mutant. Wild-type and suppressor ChvE proteins were localized in the periplasmic space. These results provide genetic evidence for the physical interaction between VirA and ChvE proteins in the periplasmic space of Agrobacterium, which enhances the cytoplasmic signal generated by phenolics. We also discuss the molecular architecture of the operon to which the chvE gene belongs."
https://openalex.org/W1530519259,"Rat liver mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation multienzyme complex consists of 4 mol of the alpha-subunit and 4 mol of the beta-subunit, and has three enzyme activities of long chain enoyl-CoA hydratase, long chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and long chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase. The following cDNA clones for the rat enzyme complex were isolated, sequenced, and expressed: 1) the 2,789-base pair (bp) cDNA clone had a 2,289-bp open reading frame encoding a 82,511-Da precursor and a 78,637-Da mature subunit. The deduced amino acid sequence of this subunit revealed that this cDNA encodes the alpha-subunit and had regions similar to the structure of rat mitochondrial enoyl-CoA hydratase and rat mitochondrial enoyl-CoA isomerase on the amino-terminal side, and a part similar to that of pig mitochondrial 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase on the carboxyl-terminal side. Expression of this cDNA in COS-1 cells yielded a protein with long chain enoyl-CoA hydratase and long chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities. 2) The 1,943-bp cDNA clone had a 1,425-bp open reading frame encoding a 51,413-Da precursor and a 47,583-Da mature subunit. A high similarity of the structure to 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolases and acetoacetyl-CoA thiolases from various sources suggests that this clone encodes the beta-subunits. Expression of this cDNA in COS-1 cells yielded a protein with long chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase activity. By phylogenetic analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences of the alpha- and beta-subunits with those of other beta-oxidation enzymes, it was suggested that the alpha-subunit is a descendant of short chain enoyl-CoA hydratase and short chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase while the beta-subunit first diverged from a common ancestor gene of the thiolase family."
https://openalex.org/W1480687250,"Human milk bile salt-stimulated lipase ensures efficient utilization of triacylglycerol by breast-fed infants. Cloning and sequencing of cDNA have revealed that the peptide chain consists of 722 amino acid residues showing only little homology to typical lipases. The sequence is identical to that of pancreatic carboxylic-ester hydrolase. The COOH-terminal part contains 16 proline-rich repeats of 11 residues with O-linked carbohydrate. The only N-linked sugar chain is situated close to the active-site serine. Using C127 cells and a bovine papilloma virus vector, high and stable expression of full-length lipase and of several variants, obtained by site-directed mutagenesis, was achieved. The produced proteins were purified and further characterized. Variants lacking all, or all but two, repeats were active with similar specific activity and the same bile salt dependence as the native milk enzyme. Changing the asparagine necessary for N-glycosylation gave the same principal results. Active recombinant full-length lipase was also produced in a bacterial system. We conclude that neither glycosylation (N- or O-linked) nor the proline-rich repeats are essential for catalytic activity or bile salt activation of human milk bile salt-stimulated lipase."
https://openalex.org/W1667958142,"Abstract Pulmonary surfactant protein C (SP-C) is a small hydrophobic peptide that is palmitoylated on 2 adjacent cysteine residues. SP-C enhances the adsorption of phospholipids into a monolayer. The function of the acylation is not clear yet. The experiments described in this article were carried out in order to investigate the function of SP-C acylation in (protein-catalyzed) lipid monolayer formation, and in bilayer interactions. Palmitoylated and nonpalmitoylated human recombinant SP-C were used. In addition, a nonacylated SP-C with a Cys-->Ser mutations was included in these studies. In Wilhelmy plate experiments using negatively charged, protein-containing phospholipid monolayers and negatively charged vesicles, CaCl2 was required to obtain a maximal insertion rate of lipids into the monolayer. If the negatively charged phospholipids in the monolayer were replaced by neutral phospholipids, CaCl2 was only required to show a maximal SP-C-catalyzed insertion rate (if the molecule is palmitoylated, but not if nonpalmitoylated proteins were added). In pressure area measurements, the palmitoylated protein showed a different change in pressure as a function of the surface area, as compared with the nonpalmitoylated proteins. Circular dichroism experiments showed that all three proteins had a high content of alpha-helix. All three proteins showed a preferential orientation at the air-water interface, but the palmitoylated protein has an orientation which is more parallel to the monolayer than that of the nonpalmitoylated proteins. It is concluded that acylation of SP-C alters structural and physical properties of this protein."
https://openalex.org/W1559281939,"Abstract The mechanisms that regulate cell lineage-specific and differentiation-dependent patterns of gene expression in the gastric units of the stomach are largely unknown. Transgenic mice were generated in order to identify cis-acting sequences that determine the zymogenic cell-specific pattern of expression of the mouse intrinsic factor (InF) gene and the parietal cell-specific pattern of expression of the mouse H+/K(+)-ATPase beta-subunit gene. Portions of the 5'-nontranscribed domains of each gene were linked to the human growth hormone (hGH) gene beginning at its nucleotide +3. RNA blot hybridization studies combined with multilabel immunocytochemical surveys using a panel of lineage-specific antibodies and lectins indicated that nucleotides -1035 to +24 of the mouse H+/K(+)-ATPase beta-subunit gene direct a pattern of reporter production which recapitulates the parietal cell-specific and developmental patterns of expression of the endogenous gene. Analysis of three mosaic founders containing H+/K(+)-ATPase beta-subunit-1035 to +24/hGH+3 revealed that they had monophenotypic gastric units: a given unit contained either a wholly hGH-positive or a wholly hGH-negative population of parietal cells. These latter findings provide very strong evidence that gastric units are monoclonal, i.e. they are supplied by stem cells having one genotype. Although some, but not all, parietal cells are apparently derived from the same committed progenitor as zymogenic cells, virtually all parietal cells in a given gastric unit, but none of its zymogenic cells, express InF-1029 to +55/hGH+3. This suggests that InF-1029 to +55 may contain cis-acting sequences which allow parietal cell expression in other species (e.g. humans) but lack additional elements which normally function in mice to suppress InF expression in this lineage. The absence of hGH in zymogenic cells also means that the transcriptional regulatory environments of parietal and zymogenic cells derived from the same precursor are distinguishable by InF-1029 to +55. H+/K(+)-ATPase beta-subunit-1035 to +24 and InF-1029 to +55 are the only two sequences reported to date that are able to direct foreign gene expression exclusively to a gastric epithelial cell lineage in transgenic mice. This ability to deliver gene products to parietal cells can now be exploited to identify factors that control their normal proliferation and differentiation programs and/or to specifically alter their biological properties."
https://openalex.org/W1546686895,"The influence of 5'-secondary structure formation and 5'-leader length upon mRNA translation in yeast has been analyzed using a closely related set of cat mRNAs (Vega Laso, M. R., Zhu, D., Sagliocco, F. A., Brown, A. J. P., Tuite, M. F., and McCarthy, J. E. G. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 6453-6462). A cat mRNA with a relatively short unstructured 5'-leader (22 bases) had a ribosome loading about half that of a cat mRNA with an unstructured 5'-leader of 77 bases. The introduction of 5'-secondary structures at various positions throughout the 5'-leader of the cat mRNA inhibited translation initiation, the degree of inhibition being largely dependent upon the thermodynamic stability of the structure. Each mRNA carrying a 5'-secondary structure had a biphasic polysome distribution, indicating that the mRNA molecules were distributed between untranslated and well translated subpopulations. This suggests that once 5'-secondary structures are unwound, they reform slowly relative to the rate of translation initiation in yeast. Untranslated mRNA accumulated in 43 S preinitiation complexes, even when there were only 5 bases between the 5'-cap and the base of the hairpin. The data are consistent with the scanning hypothesis (Kozak, M. (1989) J. Cell. Biol. 108, 229-241) and suggest that 40 S ribosomal subunits bind to mRNA early in the scanning process, probably before mRNA unwinding has taken place."
https://openalex.org/W1574436604,"Receptor-linked tyrosine phosphatases regulate cell growth by dephosphorylating proteins involved in tyrosine kinase signal transduction. Within this gene family, the leukocyte common antigen-related (LAR) gene is of particular interest with respect to the nervous system because it has sequence similarity to the neural cell adhesion molecule N-CAM and is located in a chromosomal region (1p32-33) frequently deleted in neuroectodermal tumors. However, immunostaining has detected LAR in non-neural tissues, but not in the central nervous system, peripheral neurons, or adrenal medulla. In this study, rat brain cDNA library LAR clones corresponding to cytoplasmic and 3'-untranslated regions of human LAR were identified. Using probes derived from these clones, high stringency Northern blots revealed approximately 8 kilobase and variable length tissue- and cell-specific LAR transcripts in cortex, brainstem, cerebellum, spinal cord, peripheral tissues, and cultured neural, glial, and pheochromocytoma cells. In situ hybridization showed expression by brain and dorsal root ganglion neurons. LAR expression was developmentally regulated in a region-dependent manner. Changes in LAR expression were also found during nerve growth factor-induced PC12 pheochromocytoma cell differentiation and with contact-mediated inhibition of fibroblast growth. These observations and studies demonstrating neurotrophins functioning via tyrosine kinase receptors suggest that LAR represents an additional mechanism regulating neural development."
https://openalex.org/W1509770379,"It is postulated that basic residues within the inhibitory region of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) bind acidic residues within the catalytic core to maintain the kinase in an inactive form. In this study, we identified residues within the catalytic cores of the skeletal and smooth muscle MLCKs that may bind basic residues in inhibitory region. Acidic residues within the catalytic core of the rabbit skeletal and smooth muscle MLCKs were mutated and the kinetic properties of the mutant kinases determined. Mutation of 6 and 8 acidic residues in the skeletal and smooth muscle MLCKs, respectively, result in mutant MLCKs with decreases in KCaM (the concentration of calmodulin required for half-maximal activation of myosin light chain kinase) value ranging from 2- to 100-fold. Two inhibitory domain binding residues identified in each kinase also bind a basic residue in light chain substrate. The remaining mutants all have wild-type Km values for light chain. The predicted inhibitory domain binding residues are distributed in a linear fashion across the surface of the lower lobe of the proposed molecular model of the smooth muscle MLCK catalytic core. As 6 of the inhibitory domain binding residues in the smooth muscle MLCK are conserved in other Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, the structural basis for autoinhibition and activation may be similar."
https://openalex.org/W1524331994,"A rat brain opioid receptor protein was isolated by binding [epsilon-biotinyl-Lys32] beta-endorphin to membranes, solubilizing the receptor-ligand (R.L) complex with deoxycholate-lysophosphatidylcholine and purifying on immobilized streptavidin and wheat germ agglutinin. The purified glycoprotein had a molecular mass of 60-70 kDa. Recovery of this protein was blocked by the nonselective opioid antagonist naloxone and the highly mu-selective agonist [D-Ala2,N-methyl-Phe4,Glyol5]-enkephalin but not by the highly delta-selective agonist [D-Pen2,4'-Cl-Phe4,D-Pen5]enkephalin when these compounds were added as competitors at the binding step. The 60-70-kDa receptor protein co-purified through the streptavidin column with 40-kDa protein recognized by anti-Gi alpha antibodies. GTP and Na+ influenced dissociation of the solubilized R.125I-L complex and elution of the receptor and G protein from streptavidin in fashions consistent with the pharmacology of mu-opioid receptors. A 23-amino acid residue sequence from the purified receptor differs at 4 positions from a similar sequence in the murine delta-opioid receptor and is encoded within a novel rat brain cDNA isolated by polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotide primers related to the murine delta-opioid receptor gene."
https://openalex.org/W1715134778,"Previous studies have shown that CD8 can be present at the cell surface either as a disulfide-linked homodimer of CD8 alpha or as a disulfide-linked heterodimer of CD8 alpha and CD8 beta. Here we analyzed the assembly and intracellular transport of CD8 with particular emphasis on the role of the transmembrane domains. A chimeric protein (alpha T alpha) made by replacing the transmembrane domain of CD8 alpha with that of the interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain (Tac) exhibited reduced ability to form homodimers, while a mutant of Tac containing the CD8 alpha transmembrane domain (T alpha alpha) dimerized efficiently. Contrary to CD8 alpha, CD8 beta expressed alone was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Only a small amount of CD8 beta formed homodimers, and these also remained in the ER. A mutant of CD8 beta that dimerized efficiently was also retained in the ER, thus proving that ER retention of CD8 beta is not due to its poor homodimerization. Rather, the extracellular domain of CD8 beta requires interaction with that of CD8 alpha to exit the ER. The transmembrane domain of CD8 beta was also shown to participate in ER retention by preventing exit of monomeric CD8 beta out of the ER. These findings demonstrate the role of transmembrane domains in assembly and intracellular transport of the CD8 molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1551407204,"The ovine binucleate cell-specific glycoproteins recognized by the monoclonal antibody SBU-3 first appear at the initiation of placentation, and their expression continues throughout gestation. These placenta-specific proteins have not been detected in any other adult or fetal sheep tissues and are specific to the materno-fetal interface. The SBU-3 monoclonal antibody recognizes the carbohydrate epitope common to a group of proteins ranging in molecular mass from 30 to 200 kDa whose function during pregnancy remains undefined. The biochemical properties of these uniquely expressed glycoproteins were investigated by analyzing both the carbohydrate and protein portion of the molecules. Analysis of phytohemagglutinin and concanavalin A binding to electrophoretically separated SBU-3 proteins revealed that the major proteins between 40 and 70 kDa bind phytohemagglutinin. In contrast, concanavalin A bound only to minor proteins in the SBU-3 glycoprotein preparation. Analysis of the carbohydrate conjugated to the SBU-3 glycoproteins revealed that the major chains are sialylated O-linked and complex partially sialylated multiple antennary N-linked chains. The presence of N-glycolylneuraminic acid in an N-linked structure indicates the unique nature of this carbohydrate epitope. The differential binding to phytohemagglutinin and concanavalin A provided a method for further purification and characterization of the major protein components with monoclonal antibody immunoaffinity-purified SBU-3 proteins being further separated by concanavalin A-Sepharose chromatography. Microsequence analysis of the major non-concanavalin A-binding proteins (69, 62, and 57 kDa) revealed partial homology to ovine and bovine pregnancy-associated glycoprotein and rabbit pepsinogen F. Immunoblot analysis of the SBU-3 proteins showed cross-reactivity with polyclonal antisera directed against ovine placental-associated glycoprotein and pregnancy-specific glycoprotein B. These results suggest that together these glycoproteins represent members of a binucleate cell-derived family of pregnancy-associated molecules in the ruminant placenta."
https://openalex.org/W1596044300,"Superactivity of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase (PRS) is an X chromosome-linked disorder of purine metabolism, characterized by gout with uric acid overproduction and, in some families, neurodevelopmental impairment. Two highly homologous isoforms of PRS (PRS1 and PRS2), each encoded by a distinct X chromosome-linked locus, have been identified, and PRS1 and 2 cDNAs have been cloned. The entire 954-base pair translated regions of PRS1 and 2 cDNAs derived from cultured lymphoblasts and fibroblasts from two patients in whom purine nucleotide feedback resistance of PRS is associated with enzyme superactivity and neurodevelopmental defects were examined by direct sequencing after polymerase chain reaction amplification of PRS transcripts. Nucleotide sequences of PRS2 cDNAs from the patients and normal individuals were identical. In contrast, PRS1 cDNAs from the patients differ from normal PRS1 cDNA, each by a single base substitution. PRS1 cDNA from patient N. B. showed an A to G transition at nucleotide 341, corresponding to an asparagine to serine change at amino acid residue 113 of mature PRS1. A G to C transversion at nucleotide 547, indicating an aspartic acid to histidine change at amino acid 182, was found for PRS1 cDNA from patient S. M. Point mutations at the sites identified in the PRS1 cDNAs of the two patients were confirmed by the results of RNase mapping analysis. Normal, N. B., and S. M. PRS1 cDNAs were introduced into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3)/pLyS, and recombinant N. B. and S. M. PRS1s showed the purine nucleotide feedback resistance phenotypes characteristic of PRS from patients' cells."
https://openalex.org/W110108617,"The NH2-terminal epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like module of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors IX and X and protein C each has one calcium binding site. This module (residues 45-86) from factor X has been isolated previously and found to bind calcium with a Kd of 2.2 mM at physiological pH and ionic strength. We have now demonstrated that it binds calcium with a Kd of 120 microM in a fragment that consists of the Gla module and the NH2-terminal EGF-like module. The presence of the Gla module (residues 1-44) increases the calcium affinity of the site in the EGF-like module approximately 20-fold, thus making it essentially saturated in vivo. Decarboxylation of the Gla residues to Glu has no significant effect on the calcium affinity of the EGF-like module. A proteolytic fragment of factor X (residues 29-86) and a synthetic peptide (residues 34-86), folded to a native conformation, were used to demonstrate that the contribution of the Gla module to the calcium affinity of the site in the EGF-like module is mediated by its 17 COOH-terminal residues, 12 of which form an alpha-helix in the intact Gla module. In the NMR structure of the NH2-terminal EGF-like module in factor X, five calcium ligating groups have been identified (Selander-Sunnerhagen, M., Ullner, M., Persson, E., Teleman, O., Stenflo, J., and Drakenberg, T. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 19642-19649). As calcium usually requires seven to eight oxygen ligands, there is reason to believe that the Gla module contributes ligands, or negative charge, to increase the calcium affinity. Our findings suggest that the calcium affinity of EGF-like modules in other proteins may also be influenced by neighboring modules."
https://openalex.org/W1577905564,"We have isolated and characterized cDNA clones derived from a developmentally regulated neonatal rat submandibular gland salivary protein gene called salivary protein 1 (CSP1). Identical clones were also identified in cDNA libraries from adult male parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands. CSP1 transcripts are at least 10-fold more abundant in the sublingual gland than in the submandibular or parotid glands. In situ hybridization and immunocytochemical localization demonstrated the presence of CSP1 transcripts and proteins in sublingual gland serous demilune cells, parotid and submandibular gland intercalated duct cells, and in the type III (proacinar) cells of the neonatal submandibular gland. This cell-type distribution is similar to that described by Ball and colleagues (Ball, W. D., Hand, A. R., and Johnson, A. O. (1988) Dev. Biol. 125, 265-279) for the developmentally regulated submandibular gland B1-immunoreactive proteins. Immunoblotting of salivary secretion identified proteins of M(r) 20,000 in sublingual, 16,000 in submandibular and 22,000 and 16,000 in parotid gland. The M(r) 20,000 sublingual and 22,000 parotid proteins represent N-glycosylated forms of a M(r) 16,000 apoprotein, suggesting that these salivary proteins arise by post-translational modification of a common precursor."
https://openalex.org/W1542840309,"Both high molecular weight kininogen (HK) and low molecular weight kininogens (LK) are potent tight binding inhibitors of platelet calpain (Ki = 2 nM), but the molecular basis for the inhibitory function is not well delineated. The amino acid sequences of the calpain inhibitory domain 2 from human and rat HK were compared for homology with the noninhibitory domains from human and rat domain 3 and from domain 2 of rat T-kininogen, and two areas of nonconserved differences were detected. Computer three-dimensional models were constructed on a template built using the x-ray crystallographic data for cystatin, an evolutionary precursor of HK. Two nonconserved regions in the calpain inhibitory domains flank the highly conserved motif QVVAG to form a continuous surface for interaction with cysteine proteases. Three peptide sequences, components of the modeled surface, were chosen for synthesis from HK D-2: VHPISTQSPDLE (peptide 146-156, NH2-terminal), CTDNAYIDIQLRIASFSQNC (peptide 229-248, COOH-terminal), and CQRQVVAGLNFRIC (185-189, central) containing QVVAG. This last peptide differs from the natural sequence by substitutions of A185C and T195C. Peptides 185-198 and 229-248 were folded by air oxidation of their cysteine residues and then tested for their ability to inhibit calpain and papain. The folded peptide 229-248 inhibited calpain with an IC50 35 microM and unfolding reduced this effect. The folded peptide 185-198 did not inhibit calpain, but when preincubated with calpain, could block the inhibition by HK indicating a probable enzyme binding site. Peptide 146-157 did not inhibit calpain but could inhibit papain with an IC50 of 20 microM. We have thus defined separate binding and inhibitory sequences on HK which form a contiguous surface for thiol protease interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1581311605,"Expression of the transmembrane phosphotyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) CD45 has been shown to inhibit hormone-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation and mitogenesis (Mooney, R. A., Freund, G. G., Way, B. A., and Bordwell, K. L. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 23443-23446). Here the impact of PTPase expression on insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and platelet-derived growth factor- (PDGF) dependent activation of PI-3-K was investigated. In PTPase+ cells, IGF-1 and PDGF-dependent PI-3-K activity in antiphosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates was decreased by 62 +/- 13 and 46 +/- 17%, respectively, compared to control cells. Similar decreases in PI-3-K activity associated with anti-PDGF receptor and anti-insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) immunoprecipitates were also observed. Association of PI-3-K with the hormone-activated PDGF receptor decreased approximately 55%, paralleling its loss of activation in PTPase+ cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the 85-kDa subunit of PI-3-K was also inhibited. Similarly, IGF-1 dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 was decreased by 45%, and its association with PI-3-K was decreased by 65% in PTPase+ cells. Finally, PDGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma 1 and GTPase-activating protein was reduced by 60-70% in the PTPase+ cells as was tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGF receptor associated with these proteins. In summary, expression of a transmembrane PTPase decreased hormone-dependent PI-3-K activation, tyrosine phosphorylation of receptor substrates, and their association with signaling complexes. These data support a role for transmembrane PTPases in the regulation of receptor signal transduction pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1522761271,"Aldosterone treatment of A6 cultured renal epithelial cells methylates the apical membrane, and we examined the aldosterone-induced carboxymethylation of the apical membrane of these cells to determine the targeted polypeptides. Methionine-deprived A6 cells were incubated with aldosterone and [3H]methionine. Homogenates and apical membranes were solubilized and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Label incorporation in a 90-kDa polypeptide was more intense (4-fold) in membranes after aldosterone compared to control. For in vitro methylation, membranes were isolated, incubated with S-adenosyl-L-[methyl-3H]methionine, and analyzed for 3H-methyl uptake. Label incorporation was low in control membranes but markedly stimulated (4-fold) in membrane preparations from aldosterone-treated cells. Guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) increased in vitro methylation of a 90-kDa polypeptide 5-fold in control membranes but after aldosterone, where methylation was already stimulated, little change was observed. We conclude that aldosterone induces methylation of an apical membrane 90-kDa polypeptide, possibly a subunit of the epithelial Na+ channel, in a GTP-dependent manner, and this may be one of the final steps in a cascade of reactions leading to the natriferic action of this hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1569705402,"To explore the roles of active-site Glu48 of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase from Rhodospirillum rubrum, the E48Q mutant has been characterized with respect to kinetics and product distribution. Although the kcat for carboxylase activity is only 0.6% of the wild-type value, the mutant retains full activity in catalyzing the conversion of the carboxylated reaction intermediate to 3-phosphoglycerate and retains 10% of the normal activity in catalyzing the enolization of ribulose bisphosphate. Thus, the mutant is preferentially impaired in the carboxylation step. Partitioning of the enediol(ate) intermediate during turnover of ribulose bisphosphate is perturbed dramatically in the case of the mutant protein. Whereas the wild-type enzyme displays a CO2/O2 specificity factor of 11, the corresponding parameter of the mutant is only 0.3, thereby signifying a shift of the relative reactivity of the enediol(ate) in favor of O2. The mutant protein is also unable to protect the enediol(ate) against misprotonation with consequential conversion of ribulose bisphosphate to xylulose bisphosphate. This side reaction, undetected with wild-type R. rubrum enzyme, proceeds as rapidly as carboxylation of D-ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate by the E48Q mutant. Formation of xylulose bisphosphate by the mutant does not appear to account for the decline in carboxylase activity that occurs during the course of an assay. These studies demonstrate the multiple functionalities of Glu48 in the facilitation of catalysis and in directing intermediate partitioning in the preferred direction."
https://openalex.org/W1493676496,"The cartilage matrix glycoprotein fibromodulin contains four N-linked glycosylation sites which act as acceptors for the addition of sulfated polylactosamine (keratan sulfate). In the present study we examined the biosynthetic processing of these N-linked oligosaccharides for subsequent addition of polylactosamine. Chondrocytes were treated with castanospermine, 1-(+)deoxymannojirimycin, and swainsonine, radiolabeled with [3,4,5-3H]leucine, [2-3H]mannose, or [6-3H]glucosamine, and newly synthesized fibromodulin was immunoprecipitated for analysis. Castanospermine and 1-(+)deoxymannojirimycin inhibited polylactosamine addition, whereas swainsonine was not effective. This indicated that the linkage regions must be processed to GlcNAc(Man)5(GlcNAc)2Asn but do not require further modification to GlcNAc(Man)3(GlcNAc)2Asn. In both control and swainsonine-treated cells one or two N-linked oligosaccharides per molecule were modified with polylactosamine containing 4-6 repeating disaccharide units. Moreover, a single short chain was added either to the C-3 or the C-6 branch in control cultures, whereas only the C-3 branch was substituted in the presence of swainsonine. Analysis of endo-beta-galactosidase and keratanase II digestion products of the polylactosamine chains synthesized in both culture conditions showed that only about 25% of the hexosamine residues and less than 5% of the adjacent galactose residues were substituted with sulfate. These findings are discussed in relation to the regulation of fibromodulin glycosylation and the likely influence of polylactosamine structure on the extracellular interactions and turnover of fibromodulin."

The PACAP receptor was solubilized from bovine brain membranes with digitonin and purified 30-fold by the combination of DEAE-Toyopearl and hydroxylapatite chromatographic analyses. The partially purified PACAP receptors were mixed with biotinylated PACAP27 to form receptor-ligand complexes and then adsorbed onto avidin-agarose. The adsorbed PACAP receptors were eluted with an acidic buffer containing 1.0 M NaCl (pH 4.0). The eluted receptors were purified further by hydroxylapatite and gel filtration chromatography. A single protein band with a M(r) = 55,000-60,000 was found in the final preparation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining. Affinity labeling of the purified receptors with 125I-PACAP27 labeled the M(r) 55,000-60,000 protein specifically. The dissociation constant and the specific activity of the purified receptors were 25.8 pM and 17.2 nmol of ligand binding per mg of protein, respectively. Inhibitory constants determined by competitive binding experiments were 30.0 pM for PACAP27, 4.6 pM for PACAP38, and 37.3 nM for vasoactive intestinal peptide. Therefore, the purified PACAP receptor retained high affinity and ligand specificity. The sequence of the amino-terminal 29 residues was derived from the purified receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1480565696,"The region of the genome of Mycoplasma capricolum encompassing the gene (ptsH) encoding HPr, a general energy-coupling protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system, was cloned and sequenced. Examination of the sequence revealed a unique arrangement of the ptsH gene. In all other bacterial species characterized thus far, the ptsH gene is part of a polycistronic operon that includes the gene (ptsI) encoding Enzyme I of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system; the M. capricolum ptsH gene is part of a monocistronic operon that is situated between two open reading frames unrelated to phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system function. The gene immediately upstream of ptsH codes for a helicase, and the open reading frame immediately downstream of ptsH, although not homologous to any previously identified protein, contains a signature sequence characteristic of [C-5] cytosine-specific DNA methylases. The product of the ptsH gene has characteristics similar to the HPr protein produced by Gram-positive organisms: it has a greater sequence similarity to HPrs of Gram-positive bacteria than to those of Gram-negative organisms, it is phosphorylated by a protein kinase derived from Gram-positive organisms, and it complements sugar phosphorylation activity in Gram-positive extracts. The high calculated isoelectric point (pI = 9.18) and the absence of glutamate residues in the C-terminal region distinguish the M. capricolum HPr from all previously described HPrs."
https://openalex.org/W1552281474,"Recent findings have suggested that certain ligand-dependent responses to EGF may be propagated in a manner that is not dependent on the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R, Campos-Gonzalez, R., and Glenney, J. R., Jr. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 14535-14538) or, alternatively, that these responses may occur through the interaction of the human tyrosine kinase-deficient EGF-R with an as yet unidentified kinase (Selva, E., Raden, D. L., and Davis, R. J. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 2250-2254). These conclusions represent a significant departure from our current understanding of signal transduction by receptor tyrosine kinases. Therefore we examined the effect of expression of tyrosine kinase-negative human EGF receptor in murine NIH-3T3-2.2 cells on the EGF-dependent phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP-2) kinase. In parental cells (NIH-3T3-2.2) that express low levels of endogenous murine EGF-R, there was no demonstrable EGF-dependent coupling to MAP-2 kinase. In NIH-3T3-2.2 cells transfected with tyrosine kinase-negative human EGF-R, there was unexpected EGF-dependent phosphorylation of MAP-2 kinase. Analysis of the tyrosine kinase-negative human EGF-R in these cells revealed significant tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF-R. A low level of endogenous murine EGF-R present in these cells were also phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and displayed autokinase activity. Similar results were obtained using an unrelated cell line (B82L cells), in which EGF-dependent phosphorylation of MAP-2 kinase was previously attributed to signal propagation through a tyrosine kinase-negative human EGF-R (Campos-Gonzalez, R., and Glenney, J. R., Jr. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 14535-14538). Taken together, these results suggest that the tyrosine kinase-negative human EGF-R are able to amplify the response to activation of low levels of endogenous murine EGF-R, thus leading to EGF-dependent phosphorylation of MAP-2 kinase in cells expressing tyrosine kinase-negative human EGF-R."
https://openalex.org/W1570553255,"Activated T-cell extracts contain an activity (T-AP1) composed of at least two dissociable protein components which bind to the AP1 consensus sequence in the enhancer of the gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV)-LTR (GALV-TRE). This activity is inducible by 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-14-acetate (TPA) even in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors. Although one component of this complex (CORE) is related immunologically and biochemically to junD, it nevertheless displays significant biochemical properties which distinguish CORE from recombinant junD. The second component of the complex, flowthrough, interacts more efficiently with CORE than with recombinant junD. GALV-TRE enhancer activity is increased within 2 h in vivo with T cells treated with TPA in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors; this increase in enhancer activity is paralleled by the increased GALV-TRE-mediated transcriptional activity present in extracts of these cells. Purified T-cell junD activates GALV-TRE-driven RNA synthesis in vitro. The rapidity and the protein synthesis-independent nature of TPA-induced T-AP1 activation suggests that this complex is involved in the earliest stages of T-cell activation."

G-74-2) and then purified by affinity chromatography on a column of an immobilized monoclonal antibody, MSW 113. Structural studies, involving 600-MHz 1H NMR spectrometry, indicated the structures of these compounds to be as follows. [formula: see text] Three of these oligosaccharides, 2, 3, and 4, are novel as to ganglioside sugar chains and contain both lacto series types 1 and 2 chains. Oligosaccharides 3 and 4 are unique in that they contain the sialyl-Le(a)-X structure in linear and branched structures. Gangliosides with the oligosaccharide structures presented above might be new potential tumor markers."
https://openalex.org/W1528281043,"Abstract The activation of the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) by the DNA alkylating agents ethyl methanesulfonate, methyl methanesulfonate, and mitomycin C was observed in human B lymphocytes transiently transfected with plasmids in which the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) directed the expression of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. Deletion of the two NF-kappa B-binding sites of LTR abolished the HIV-1 activation induced by the three mutagens, while deletion of the three Sp1-binding sites slightly reduced it. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed an increased binding to the kappa B sites of HIV-1 LTR in the nuclear extracts of human B lymphocytes upon mutagen treatment, while binding to Sp1 sites was unaffected. The TAR region was also involved in the mutagen-mediated activation of HIV-1 LTR inasmuch as a small deletion in the TAR sequence (nucleotides +34 to +37) greatly decreased the induction of HIV-1 expression. Moreover, an enhanced binding activity to the TAR DNA sequence (nucleotides +24 to +47) was observed in nuclear extracts of mutagen-treated lymphocytes. Thus, both the enhancer and the 5'-untranslated region of HIV-1 functionally cooperate in the mutagen-mediated induction of HIV-1 expression."
https://openalex.org/W1552742541,"A histone-DNA transcription template has been assembled, by dialysis against decreasing salt concentrations, from pGEMEX-1 (4 kilobases), a plasmid containing a promoter for bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase, and from isolated histone (H3.H4)2 tetramers. Electron microscopy after psoralen cross-linking shows that each histone tetramer protects approximately 80 base pairs of DNA from psoralen action and that, under the employed conditions, an average of 15 tetramer particles are assembled per DNA molecule. This (H3.H4)2-DNA template is efficiently transcribed in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase as compared to naked DNA. The presence of (H3.H4)2 tetramers does not affect initiation, in contrast with the complete histone octamer, (H2A.H2B.H3.H4)2, assembled with the complementary addition of H2A.H2B dimers, which causes transcriptional inhibition mainly by blocking initiation."
https://openalex.org/W1521976861,"Calf DNA helicase E (hel E) is a moderately processive, 3' to 5' helicase, active on nicked DNA, that we have proposed to have a role in DNA repair (Turchi, J. J., Murante, R. S., and Bambara, R. A. (1992) Nucleic Acids Res. 20, 6075-6080). Here we have examined its activity on a series of cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) (cis-DDP)-modified DNA substrates. Hel E was capable of efficiently displacing a primer strand containing, in an internal position, a cis-DDP-modified dGG. In a two-primer model system, calf DNA polymerase epsilon could successfully extend an upstream primer through a cis-DDP-modified down-stream primer, to the end of the complementary template strand, in a reaction dependent on hel E. However, the translocation of hel E was blocked by cis-DDP modification of the template strand. Primer displacement was completely prevented if the modified site was located just upstream of the primer. The DNA-dependent ATPase activity of helicase E was also reduced by cis-DDP modification of the template DNA. Substrate competition experiments indicated that cis-DDP-modified DNA templates did not sequester hel E. Substrate titration experiments suggested that there is a short delay without ATP hydrolysis before dissociation of helicase E from cis-DDP-modified template sites. Interestingly, hel E could displace a primer if the cis-DDP modification was on the template within the annealed region. Possible explanations for this are discussed. Taken together, these results are consistent with the proposal that hel E participates in DNA repair by displacing segments of damaged DNA."
