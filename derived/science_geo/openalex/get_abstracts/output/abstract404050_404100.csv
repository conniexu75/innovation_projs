https://openalex.org/W2154463966,"Background The estimated number of new HIV infections in the United States reflects the leading edge of the epidemic. Previously, CDC estimated HIV incidence in the United States in 2006 as 56,300 (95% CI: 48,200–64,500). We updated the 2006 estimate and calculated incidence for 2007–2009 using improved methodology. Methodology We estimated incidence using incidence surveillance data from 16 states and 2 cities and a modification of our previously described stratified extrapolation method based on a sample survey approach with multiple imputation, stratification, and extrapolation to account for missing data and heterogeneity of HIV testing behavior among population groups. Principal Findings Estimated HIV incidence among persons aged 13 years and older was 48,600 (95% CI: 42,400–54,700) in 2006, 56,000 (95% CI: 49,100–62,900) in 2007, 47,800 (95% CI: 41,800–53,800) in 2008 and 48,100 (95% CI: 42,200–54,000) in 2009. From 2006 to 2009 incidence did not change significantly overall or among specific race/ethnicity or risk groups. However, there was a 21% (95% CI:1.9%–39.8%; p = 0.017) increase in incidence for people aged 13–29 years, driven by a 34% (95% CI: 8.4%–60.4%) increase in young men who have sex with men (MSM). There was a 48% increase among young black/African American MSM (12.3%–83.0%; p<0.001). Among people aged 13–29, only MSM experienced significant increases in incidence, and among 13–29 year-old MSM, incidence increased significantly among young, black/African American MSM. In 2009, MSM accounted for 61% of new infections, heterosexual contact 27%, injection drug use (IDU) 9%, and MSM/IDU 3%. Conclusions/Significance Overall, HIV incidence in the United States was relatively stable 2006–2009; however, among young MSM, particularly black/African American MSM, incidence increased. HIV continues to be a major public health burden, disproportionately affecting several populations in the United States, especially MSM and racial and ethnic minorities. Expanded, improved, and targeted prevention is necessary to reduce HIV incidence."
https://openalex.org/W2138885372,"Although the role of miR-200s in regulating E-cadherin expression and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition is well established, their influence on metastatic colonization remains controversial. Here we have used clinical and experimental models of breast cancer metastasis to discover a pro-metastatic role of miR-200s that goes beyond their regulation of E-cadherin and epithelial phenotype. Overexpression of miR-200s is associated with increased risk of metastasis in breast cancer and promotes metastatic colonization in mouse models, phenotypes that cannot be recapitulated by E-cadherin expression alone. Genomic and proteomic analyses revealed global shifts in gene expression upon miR-200 overexpression toward that of highly metastatic cells. miR-200s promote metastatic colonization partly through direct targeting of Sec23a, which mediates secretion of metastasis-suppressive proteins, including Igfbp4 and Tinagl1, as validated by functional and clinical correlation studies. Overall, these findings suggest a pleiotropic role of miR-200s in promoting metastatic colonization by influencing E-cadherin-dependent epithelial traits and Sec23a-mediated tumor cell secretome."
https://openalex.org/W1928223220,"Microblogging and mobile devices appear to augment human social capabilities, which raises the question whether they remove cognitive or biological constraints on human communication. In this paper we analyze a dataset of Twitter conversations collected across six months involving 1.7 million individuals and test the theoretical cognitive limit on the number of stable social relationships known as Dunbar's number. We find that the data are in agreement with Dunbar's result; users can entertain a maximum of 100-200 stable relationships. Thus, the 'economy of attention' is limited in the online world by cognitive and biological constraints as predicted by Dunbar's theory. We propose a simple model for users' behavior that includes finite priority queuing and time resources that reproduces the observed social behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2079777624,"The cancer stem cell (CSC) model does not imply that tumours are generated from transformed tissue stem cells. The target of transformation could be a tissue stem cell, a progenitor cell, or a differentiated cell that acquires self-renewal ability. The observation that induced pluripotency reprogramming and cancer are related has lead to the speculation that CSCs may arise through a reprogramming-like mechanism. Expression of pluripotency genes (Oct4, Nanog and Sox2) was tested in breast tumours by immunohistochemistry and it was found that Sox2 is expressed in early stage breast tumours. However, expression of Oct4 or Nanog was not found. Mammosphere formation in culture was used to reveal stem cell properties, where expression of Sox2, but not Oct4 or Nanog, was induced. Over-expression of Sox2 increased mammosphere formation, effect dependent on continuous Sox2 expression; furthermore, Sox2 knockdown prevented mammosphere formation and delayed tumour formation in xenograft tumour initiation models. Induction of Sox2 expression was achieved through activation of the distal enhancer of Sox2 promoter upon sphere formation, the same element that controls Sox2 transcription in pluripotent stem cells. These findings suggest that reactivation of Sox2 represents an early step in breast tumour initiation, explaining tumour heterogeneity by placing the tumour-initiating event in any cell along the axis of mammary differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2048513224,"Background The exact overall incidence of sarcoma and sarcoma subtypes is not known. The objective of the present population-based study was to determine this incidence in a European region (Rhone-Alpes) of six million inhabitants, based on a central pathological review of the cases. Methodology/Principal Findings From March 2005 to February 2007, pathology reports and tumor blocks were prospectively collected from the 158 pathologists of the Rhone-Alpes region. All diagnosed or suspected cases of sarcoma were collected, reviewed centrally, examined for molecular alterations and classified according to the 2002 World Health Organization classification. Of the 1287 patients screened during the study period, 748 met the criteria for inclusion in the study. The overall crude and world age-standardized incidence rates were respectively 6.2 and 4.8 per 100,000/year. Incidence rates for soft tissue, visceral and bone sarcomas were respectively 3.6, 2.0 and 0.6 per 100,000. The most frequent histological subtypes were gastrointestinal stromal tumor (18%; 1.1/100,000), unclassified sarcoma (16%; 1/100,000), liposarcoma (15%; 0.9/100,000) and leiomyosarcoma (11%; 0.7/100,000). Conclusions/Significance The observed incidence of sarcomas was higher than expected. This study is the first detailed investigation of the crude incidence of histological and molecular subtypes of sarcomas."

https://openalex.org/W2068876164,"Mitotic mitochondrial fission requires CDK1-mediated phosphorylation of DRP1. The Aurora A substrate RALA is found to concentrate DRP1 and RALBP1 at mitochondria to promote DRP1 phosphorylation and fission. Mitochondria exist as dynamic interconnected networks that are maintained through a balance of fusion and fission1. Equal distribution of mitochondria to daughter cells during mitosis requires fission2. Mitotic mitochondrial fission depends on both the relocalization of the large GTPase DRP1 to the outer mitochondrial membrane and phosphorylation of Ser 616 on DRP1 by the mitotic kinase cyclin B–CDK1 (ref. 2). We now report that these processes are mediated by the small Ras-like GTPase RALA and its effector RALBP1 (also known as RLIP76, RLIP1 or RIP1; refs 3, 4). Specifically, the mitotic kinase Aurora A phosphorylates Ser 194 of RALA, relocalizing it to the mitochondria, where it concentrates RALBP1 and DRP1. Furthermore, RALBP1 is associated with cyclin B–CDK1 kinase activity that leads to phosphorylation of DRP1 on Ser 616. Disrupting either RALA or RALBP1 leads to a loss of mitochondrial fission at mitosis, improper segregation of mitochondria during cytokinesis and a decrease in ATP levels and cell number. Thus, the two mitotic kinases Aurora A and cyclin B–CDK1 converge on RALA and RALBP1 to promote mitochondrial fission, the appropriate distribution of mitochondria to daughter cells and ultimately proper mitochondrial function."
https://openalex.org/W2011747741,"The intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila modulates the activity of host GTPases to direct the transport and assembly of the membrane-bound compartment in which it resides. In vitro studies have indicated that the Legionella protein DrrA post-translationally modifies the GTPase Rab1 by a process called AMPylation. Here we used mass spectrometry to investigate post-translational modifications to Rab1 that occur during infection of host cells by Legionella. Consistent with in vitro studies, DrrA-mediated AMPylation of a conserved tyrosine residue in the switch II region of Rab1 was detected during infection. In addition, a modification to an adjacent serine residue in Rab1 was discovered, which was independent of DrrA. The Legionella effector protein AnkX was required for this modification. Biochemical studies determined that AnkX directly mediates the covalent attachment of a phosphocholine moiety to Rab1. This phosphocholine transferase activity used CDP-choline as a substrate and required a conserved histidine residue located in the FIC domain of the AnkX protein. During infection, AnkX modified both Rab1 and Rab35, which explains how this protein modulates membrane transport through both the endocytic and exocytic pathways of the host cell. Thus, phosphocholination of Rab GTPases represents a mechanism by which bacterial FIC-domain-containing proteins can alter host-cell functions."
https://openalex.org/W2059256620,"PI3K alterations are well-established drivers of breast cancer. However, PI3K-targeted therapy often results in treatment resistance and recurrence. By modeling PI3K tumorigenesis and inactivation in mice, this report shows that resistance may arise from alternative activation of the PI3K signaling pathway or by acquired alterations in other oncogenic drivers. As these mechanisms are also present in human tumors, they could be useful indicators to monitor and improve treatment responses. PIK3CA gain-of-function mutations are a common oncogenic event in human malignancy1,2,3,4, making phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) a target for cancer therapy. Despite the promise of targeted therapy, resistance often develops, leading to treatment failure. To elucidate mechanisms of resistance to PI3K-targeted therapy, we constructed a mouse model of breast cancer conditionally expressing human PIK3CAH1047R. Notably, most PIK3CAH1047R-driven mammary tumors recurred after PIK3CAH1047R inactivation. Genomic analyses of recurrent tumors revealed multiple lesions, including focal amplification of Met or Myc (also known as c-Met and c-Myc, respectively). Whereas Met amplification led to tumor survival dependent on activation of endogenous PI3K, tumors with Myc amplification became independent of the PI3K pathway. Functional analyses showed that Myc contributed to oncogene independence and resistance to PI3K inhibition. Notably, PIK3CA mutations and c-MYC elevation co-occur in a substantial fraction of human breast tumors. Together, these data suggest that c-MYC elevation represents a potential mechanism by which tumors develop resistance to current PI3K-targeted therapies."
https://openalex.org/W1996878278,"Cephalostatin 1, OSW-1, ritterazine B and schweinfurthin A are natural products that potently, and in some cases selectively, inhibit the growth of cultured human cancer cell lines. The cellular targets of these small molecules have yet to be identified. We have discovered that these molecules target oxysterol binding protein (OSBP) and its closest paralog, OSBP-related protein 4L (ORP4L)--proteins not known to be involved in cancer cell survival. OSBP and the ORPs constitute an evolutionarily conserved protein superfamily, members of which have been implicated in signal transduction, lipid transport and lipid metabolism. The functions of OSBP and the ORPs, however, remain largely enigmatic. Based on our findings, we have named the aforementioned natural products ORPphilins. Here we used ORPphilins to reveal new cellular activities of OSBP. The ORPphilins are powerful probes of OSBP and ORP4L that will be useful in uncovering their cellular functions and their roles in human diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2008005638,"Instructive programmes guiding cell-fate decisions in the developing mouse embryo are controlled by a few so-termed master regulators. Genetic studies demonstrate that the T-box transcription factor Eomesodermin (Eomes) is essential for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, mesoderm migration and specification of definitive endoderm during gastrulation. Here we report that Eomes expression within the primitive streak marks the earliest cardiac mesoderm and promotes formation of cardiovascular progenitors by directly activating the bHLH (basic-helix-loop-helix) transcription factor gene Mesp1 upstream of the core cardiac transcriptional machinery. In marked contrast to Eomes/Nodal signalling interactions that cooperatively regulate anterior-posterior axis patterning and allocation of the definitive endoderm cell lineage, formation of cardiac progenitors requires only low levels of Nodal activity accomplished through a Foxh1/Smad4-independent mechanism. Collectively, our experiments demonstrate that Eomes governs discrete context-dependent transcriptional programmes that sequentially specify cardiac and definitive endoderm progenitors during gastrulation."
https://openalex.org/W2121948672,"VCP (also called p97) recognizes and interacts with ubiquitylated cargo molecules that are destined for proteasomal degradation. Meyer and colleagues show that VCP, together with its cofactor UBXD1, sorts ubiquitylated caveolin-1 to the endolysosome system. Mutations in VCP that are associated with human degenerative diseases lack this ability. The AAA-ATPase VCP (also known as p97) cooperates with distinct cofactors to process ubiquitylated proteins in different cellular pathways1,2,3. VCP missense mutations cause a systemic degenerative disease in humans, but the molecular pathogenesis is unclear4,5. We used an unbiased mass spectrometry approach and identified a VCP complex with the UBXD1 cofactor, which binds to the plasma membrane protein caveolin-1 (CAV1) and whose formation is specifically disrupted by disease-associated mutations. We show that VCP–UBXD1 targets mono-ubiquitylated CAV1 in SDS-resistant high-molecular-weight complexes on endosomes, which are en route to degradation in endolysosomes6. Expression of VCP mutant proteins, chemical inhibition of VCP, or siRNA-mediated depletion of UBXD1 leads to a block of CAV1 transport at the limiting membrane of enlarged endosomes in cultured cells. In patient muscle, muscle-specific caveolin-3 accumulates in sarcoplasmic pools and specifically delocalizes from the sarcolemma. These results extend the cellular functions of VCP to mediating sorting of ubiquitylated cargo in the endocytic pathway and indicate that impaired trafficking of caveolin may contribute to pathogenesis in individuals with VCP mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2003569663,"P21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) is associated with colon cancer progression and metastasis, whereas the molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here, we show that downregulation of PAK1 in colon cancer cells reduces total β-catenin level, as well as cell proliferation. Mechanistically, PAK1 directly phosphorylates β-catenin proteins at Ser675 site and this leads to more stable and transcriptional active β-catenin. Corroborating these results, PAK1 is required for full Wnt signaling, and superactivation of β-catenin is achieved by simultaneous knockdown of adenomatous polyposis coli protein and activation of PAK1. Moreover, we show that Rac1 functions upstream of PAK1 in colon cancer cells and contributes to β-catenin phosphorylation and accumulation. We conclude that a Rac1/PAK1 cascade controls β-catenin S675 phosphorylation and full activation in colon cancer cells. Supporting this conclusion, overexpression of PAK1 is observed in 70% of colon cancer samples and is correlated with massive β-catenin accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W1973329326,"Aberrant expression of miR-335 has been frequently reported in cancer studies, suggesting that there is a close correlation between miR-335 and cancer during its development, progression, metastasis and prognosis. The expression of miR-335 in gastric cancer and its effects are not known. Relative expression of miR-335 in 4 gastric cancer cell lines and in 70 gastric cancer tissues was confirmed by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR compared with controls. Transwell cell migration and Matrigel invasion assay in vitro and metastasis formation assay in vivo were used to examine the effects of miR-335 expression on gastric cancer cell invasion and metastasis. The effect of miR-335 expression on gastric cancer cell proliferation was estimated by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Luciferase reporter assay and western blot were used to examine the potential target genes and related pathways. Gene silencing with small-interfering RNA was used to examine the effects of target genes on gastric cancer cell invasion. miR-335 was dramatically downregulated in gastric cancer cell lines than in the normal gastric cell line GES-1. Low expression of miR-335 was significantly associated with lymph-node metastasis, poor pT stage, poor pN stage and invasion of lymphatic vessels. Overexpression of miR-335 suppressed gastric cancer cell invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo, but has no significant effects on cell proliferation. Furthermore, miR-335 might suppress gastric cancer invasion and metastasis by targeting Bcl-w and specificity protein 1 (SP1). Taken together, our results provide evidence that miR-335 might function as a metastasis suppressor in gastric cancer by targeting SP1 directly and indirectly through the Bcl-w-induced phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt-Sp1 pathway. miR-335 showing altered expression at different stages of gastric cancer could be a target for gastric cancer therapies and could be further developed as a potential prognostic factor."
https://openalex.org/W1965466877,"A previously determined crystal structure of the ternary complex of trehalose-6-phosphate synthase identified a putative transition state-like arrangement based on validoxylamine A 6'-O-phosphate and uridine diphosphate in the active site. Here linear free energy relationships confirm that these inhibitors are synergistic transition state mimics, supporting front-face nucleophilic attack involving hydrogen bonding between leaving group and nucleophile. Kinetic isotope effects indicate a highly dissociative oxocarbenium ion-like transition state. Leaving group (18)O effects identified isotopically sensitive bond cleavages and support the existence of a hydrogen bond between the nucleophile and departing group. Brønsted analysis of nucleophiles and Taft analysis highlight participation of the nucleophile in the transition state, also consistent with a front-face mechanism. Together, these comprehensive, quantitative data substantiate this unusual enzymatic reaction mechanism. Its discovery should prompt useful reassessment of many biocatalysts and their substrates and inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2058736264,"The subjective sense of space may result in part from the combined activity of place cells in the hippocampus and grid cells in posterior cortical regions such as the entorhinal cortex and pre- and parasubiculum. In horizontal planar environments, place cells provide focal positional information, whereas grid cells supply odometric (distance measuring) information. How these cells operate in three dimensions is unknown, even though the real world is three-dimensional. We investigated this issue in rats exploring two different kinds of apparatus: a climbing wall (the 'pegboard') and a helix. Place and grid cell firing fields had normal horizontal characteristics but were elongated vertically, with grid fields forming stripes. It seems that grid cell odometry (and by implication path integration) is impaired or absent in the vertical domain, at least when the rat itself remains horizontal. These findings suggest that the mammalian encoding of three-dimensional space is anisotropic."
https://openalex.org/W2112864129,"Incorrect beliefs about the properties of memory have broad implications: The media conflate normal forgetting and inadvertent memory distortion with intentional deceit, juries issue verdicts based on flawed intuitions about the accuracy and confidence of testimony, and students misunderstand the role of memory in learning. We conducted a large representative telephone survey of the U.S. population to assess common beliefs about the properties of memory. Substantial numbers of respondents agreed with propositions that conflict with expert consensus: Amnesia results in the inability to remember one's own identity (83% of respondents agreed), unexpected objects generally grab attention (78%), memory works like a video camera (63%), memory can be enhanced through hypnosis (55%), memory is permanent (48%), and the testimony of a single confident eyewitness should be enough to convict a criminal defendant (37%). This discrepancy between popular belief and scientific consensus has implications from the classroom to the courtroom."
https://openalex.org/W2056403357,"Tumor-associated macrophages have recently emerged as a key regulatory cell type during cancer progression, and have been found to promote tumor malignancy in the majority of studies performed to date. We show in this study that CD68+ macrophages positively correlate with tumor grade and liver metastasis in human pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs). To investigate the potential mechanisms whereby macrophages can promote PNET progression, we crossed the RIP1-Tag2 (RT2) mouse model of pancreatic islet cancer to colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1)-deficient Csf1op/op mice, which have reduced numbers of tissue macrophages. Csf1op/op RT2 mice had a substantial reduction in cumulative tumor burden, which interestingly resulted from a significant decrease in angiogenic switching and tumor number, rather than an evident effect on tumor growth. In the tumors that did develop in CSF-1-deficient animals, however, there were no significant differences in tumor cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis or invasion. CSF-1 deficiency decreased macrophage infiltration by approximately 50% during all stages of RT2 tumor progression. Interestingly, several cytokines were upregulated in CSF-1-deficient RT2 tumors, and neutrophil infiltration was increased. These results show that macrophages are important for promoting PNET development and suggest that additional factors contribute to the recruitment and survival of myeloid cells in RT2 tumors in the absence of CSF-1."

https://openalex.org/W2032018384,"People show autonomic responses when they empathize with the suffering of another person. However, little is known about how these autonomic changes are related to prosocial behavior. We measured skin conductance responses (SCRs) and affect ratings in participants while either receiving painful stimulation themselves, or observing pain being inflicted on another person. In a later session, they could prevent the infliction of pain in the other by choosing to endure pain themselves. Our results show that the strength of empathy-related vicarious skin conductance responses predicts later costly helping. Moreover, the higher the match between SCR magnitudes during the observation of pain in others and SCR magnitude during self pain, the more likely a person is to engage in costly helping. We conclude that prosocial motivation is fostered by the strength of the vicarious autonomic response as well as its match with first-hand autonomic experience."
https://openalex.org/W1975057042,"DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in repetitive sequences are a potent source of genomic instability, owing to the possibility of non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR). Repetitive sequences are especially at risk during meiosis, when numerous programmed DSBs are introduced into the genome to initiate meiotic recombination. In the repetitive ribosomal DNA (rDNA) array of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, meiotic DSB formation is prevented in part through Sir2-dependent heterochromatin formation. Here we show that the edges of the rDNA array are exceptionally susceptible to meiotic DSBs, revealing an inherent heterogeneity in the rDNA array. We find that this localized DSB susceptibility necessitates a border-specific protection system consisting of the meiotic ATPase Pch2 and the origin recognition complex subunit Orc1. Upon disruption of these factors, DSB formation and recombination increased specifically in the outermost rDNA repeats, leading to NAHR and rDNA instability. Notably, the Sir2-dependent heterochromatin of the rDNA itself was responsible for the induction of DSBs at the rDNA borders in pch2Δ cells. Thus, although the activity of Sir2 globally prevents meiotic DSBs in the rDNA, it creates a highly permissive environment for DSB formation at the junctions between heterochromatin and euchromatin. Heterochromatinized repetitive DNA arrays are abundant in most eukaryotic genomes. Our data define the borders of such chromatin domains as distinct high-risk regions for meiotic NAHR, the protection of which may be a universal requirement to prevent meiotic genome rearrangements that are associated with genomic diseases and birth defects."
https://openalex.org/W2068019570,"Although predominantly expressed on lymphocytic and hematopoietic cells, the role of sphingosine-1-phospate receptor 4 (S1P(4)) in immune homeostasis is still poorly understood. In this report, we used a S1P(4)-deficient murine model to characterize the biological role of S1P(4)-mediated S1P signaling in the immune system. S1p(4)(-/-) animals showed normal peripheral lymphocyte numbers and a regular architecture of secondary lymphoid organs. Interestingly, S1P(4) only marginally affects T-cell function in vivo. In contrast, dendritic cell (DC) migration and cytokine secretion are profoundly affected by S1P(4) deficiency. Lack of S1P(4) expression on DCs significantly reduces T(H)17 differentiation of T(H) cells. Furthermore, in various in vivo models of T(H)1- or T(H)2-dominated immune reactions, S1P(4) deficiency consistently increased the amplitude of T(H)2-dominated immune responses, while those depending on T(H)1-dominated mechanisms were diminished. Finally, S1p(4)(-/-) mice showed decreased pathology in a model of dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. In summary, for the first time, we show that S1P(4) signaling is involved in the regulation of DC function and T(H)17 T-cell differentiation. S1P(4)-mediated S1P signaling also modifies the course of various immune diseases in a murine model. We propose that S1P(4) may constitute an interesting target to influence the course of various autoimmune pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W2121541306,"Abnormal tau accumulation can lead to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. P301S mice overexpress the human tau mutated gene, resulting in tau hyperphosphorylation and tangle formation. Mice also develop synaptic deficits and microglial activation prior to any neurodegeneration and tangles. Oxidative stress can also affect tauopathy. We studied the role of oxidative stress in relationship to behavioral abnormalities and disease progression in P301S mice at 2, 7, and 10 mo of age. At 7 mo of age, P301S mice had behavioral abnormalities, such as hyperactivity and disinhibition. At the same age, we observed increased carbonyls in P301S mitochondria (∼215 and 55% increase, males/females), and deregulation in the activity and content of mitochondrial enzymes involved in reactive oxygen species formation and energy metabolism, such as citrate synthase (∼19 and ∼5% decrease, males/females), MnSOD (∼16% decrease, males only), cytochrome C (∼19% decrease, females only), and cytochrome C oxidase (∼20% increase, females only). These changes in mitochondria proteome appeared before tau hyperphosphorylation and tangle formation, which were observed at 10 mo and were associated with GSK3β activation. At that age, mitochondria proteome deregulation became more apparent in male P301S mitochondria. The data strongly suggest that oxidative stress and mitochondrial abnormalities appear prior to tau pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2131005104,"Nicotinamide (Nam) phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is the rate-limiting enzyme in mammalian NAD synthesis, catalyzing nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) formation from Nam and 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate (PRPP). NAMPT has also been described as an adipocytokine visfatin with a variety of actions, although physiological significance of this protein remains unclear. It has been proposed that possible actions of visfatin are mediated through the extracellular formation of NMN. However, we did not detect NMN in mouse blood plasma, even with a highly specific and sensitive liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Furthermore, there is no or little ATP, the activator of NAMPT, in extracellular spaces. We thus questioned whether visfatin catalyzes the in situ formation of NMN under such extracellular milieus. To address this question, we here determined Km values for the substrates Nam and PRPP in the NAMPT reaction without or with ATP using a recombinant human enzyme and found that 1 mM ATP dramatically decreases Km values for the substrates, in particular PRPP to its intracellular concentration. Consistent with the kinetic data, only when ATP is present at millimolar levels, NAMPT efficiently catalyzed the NMN formation at the intracellular concentrations of the substrates. Much lower concentrations of Nam and almost the absence of PRPP and ATP in the blood plasma suggest that NAMPT should not efficiently catalyze its reaction under the extracellular milieu. Indeed, NAMPT did not form NMN in the blood plasma. From these kinetic analyses of the enzyme and quantitative determination of its substrates, activator, and product, we conclude that visfatin does not participate in NMN formation under the extracellular milieus. Together with the absence of NMN in the blood plasma, our conclusion does not support the concept of “NAMPT-mediated systemic NAD biosynthesis.” Our study would advance current understanding of visfatin physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2023239354,"Background Structural and biochemical studies of mammalian membrane proteins remain hampered by inefficient production of pure protein. We explored codon optimization based on highly expressed Pichia pastoris genes to enhance co-translational folding and production of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), an ATP-dependent drug efflux pump involved in multidrug resistance of cancers. Methodology/Principal Findings Codon-optimized “Opti-Pgp” and wild-type Pgp, identical in primary protein sequence, were rigorously analyzed for differences in function or solution structure. Yeast expression levels and yield of purified protein from P. pastoris (∼130 mg per kg cells) were about three-fold higher for Opti-Pgp than for wild-type protein. Opti-Pgp conveyed full in vivo drug resistance against multiple anticancer and fungicidal drugs. ATP hydrolysis by purified Opti-Pgp was strongly stimulated ∼15-fold by verapamil and inhibited by cyclosporine A with binding constants of 4.2±2.2 µM and 1.1±0.26 µM, indistinguishable from wild-type Pgp. Maximum turnover number was 2.1±0.28 µmol/min/mg and was enhanced by 1.2-fold over wild-type Pgp, likely due to higher purity of Opti-Pgp preparations. Analysis of purified wild-type and Opti-Pgp by CD, DSC and limited proteolysis suggested similar secondary and ternary structure. Addition of lipid increased the thermal stability from Tm ∼40°C to 49°C, and the total unfolding enthalpy. The increase in folded state may account for the increase in drug-stimulated ATPase activity seen in presence of lipids. Conclusion The significantly higher yields of protein in the native folded state, higher purity and improved function establish the value of our gene optimization approach, and provide a basis to improve production of other membrane proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2069785213,"Fos-related antigen 1 (Fra-1) is a Fos family member overexpressed in several types of human cancers. Here, we report that Fra-1 is highly expressed in the muscle-invasive form of the carcinoma of the bladder (80%) and to a lesser extent in superficial bladder cancer (42%). We demonstrate that in this type of cancer Fra-1 is regulated via a C-terminal instability signal and C-terminal phosphorylation. We show that manipulation of Fra-1 expression levels in bladder cancer cell lines affects cell morphology, motility and proliferation. The gene coding for AXL tyrosine kinase is directly upregulated by Fra-1 in bladder cancer and in other cell lines. Importantly, our data demonstrate that AXL mediates the effect of Fra-1 on tumour cell motility but not on cell proliferation. We suggest that AXL may represent an attractive therapeutic target in cancers expressing high Fra-1 levels."
https://openalex.org/W2069926873,"Despite extensive characterization of the role of the EWS-ETS fusions, little is known about secondary genetic alterations and their clinical contribution to Ewing sarcoma (ES). It has been demonstrated that the molecular structure of EWS-ETS lacks prognostic value. Moreover, CDKN2A deletion and TP53 mutation, despite carrying a poor prognosis, are infrequent. In this scenario identifying secondary genetic alterations with a significant prevalence could contribute to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the most aggressive forms of ES. We screened a 67 ES tumor set for copy number alterations by array comparative genomic hybridization. 1q gain (1qG), detected in 31% of tumor samples, was found markedly associated with relapse and poor overall and disease-free survival and demonstrated a prognostic value independent of classical clinical parameters. Reanalysis of an expression dataset belonging to an independent tumor set (n=37) not only validated this finding but also led us to identify a transcriptomic profile of severe cell cycle deregulation in 1qG ES tumors. Consistently, a higher proliferation rate was detected in this tumor subset by Ki-67 immunohistochemistry. CDT2, a 1q-located candidate gene encoding a protein involved in ubiquitin ligase activity and significantly overexpressed in 1qG ES tumors, was validated in vitro and in vivo proving its major contribution to this molecular and clinical phenotype. This integrative genomic study of 105 ES tumors in overall renders the potential value of 1qG and CDT2 overexpression as prognostic biomarkers and also affords a rationale for the application of already available new therapeutic compounds selectively targeting the protein-ubiquitin machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2032918836,"Follistatin-like 1 (Fstl1) is a secreted protein of the BMP inhibitor class. During development, expression of Fstl1 is already found in cleavage stage embryos and becomes gradually restricted to mesenchymal elements of most organs during subsequent development. Knock down experiments in chicken and zebrafish demonstrated a role as a BMP antagonist in early development. To investigate the role of Fstl1 during mouse development, a conditional Fstl1 KO allele as well as a Fstl1-GFP reporter mouse were created. KO mice die at birth from respiratory distress and show multiple defects in lung development. Also, skeletal development is affected. Endochondral bone development, limb patterning as well as patterning of the axial skeleton are perturbed in the absence of Fstl1. Taken together, these observations show that Fstl1 is a crucial regulator in BMP signalling during mouse development."
https://openalex.org/W2158166500,"Alterations in nucleoli, including increased numbers, increased size, altered architecture and increased function are hallmarks of prostate cancer cells. The mechanisms that result in increased nucleolar size, number and function in prostate cancer have not been fully elucidated. The nucleolus is formed around repeats of a transcriptional unit encoding a 45S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) precursor that is then processed to yield the mature 18S, 5.8S and 28S RNA species. Although it has been generally accepted that tumor cells overexpress rRNA species, this has not been examined in clinical prostate cancer. We find that indeed levels of the 45S rRNA, 28S, 18S and 5.8S are overexpressed in the majority of human primary prostate cancer specimens as compared with matched benign tissues. One mechanism that can alter nucleolar function and structure in cancer cells is hypomethylation of CpG dinucleotides of the upstream rDNA promoter region. However, this mechanism has not been examined in prostate cancer. To determine whether rRNA overexpression could be explained by hypomethylation of these CpG sites, we also evaluated the DNA methylation status of the rDNA promoter in prostate cancer cell lines and the clinical specimens. Bisulfite sequencing of genomic DNA revealed two roughly equal populations of loci in cell lines consisting of those that contained densely methylated deoxycytidine residues within CpGs and those that were largely unmethylated. All clinical specimens also contained two populations with no marked changes in methylation of this region in cancer as compared with normal. We recently reported that MYC can regulate rRNA levels in human prostate cancer; here we show that MYC mRNA levels are correlated with 45S, 18S and 5.8S rRNA levels. Further, as a surrogate for nucleolar size and number, we examined the expression of fibrillarin, which did not correlate with rRNA levels. We conclude that rRNA levels are increased in human prostate cancer, but that hypomethylation of the rDNA promoter does not explain this increase, nor does hypomethylation explain alterations in nucleolar number and structure in prostate cancer cells. Rather, rRNA levels and nucleolar size and number relate more closely to MYC overexpression."
https://openalex.org/W2055614532,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family members and c-Src are co-overexpressed in many cancers. The synergistic effect of EGFR and c-Src has been shown in the tumorigenesis of breast and other cancers. Reported mechanisms of synergy include transcriptional regulation by STAT5b and the regulation of cellular ATP production by mitochondrial protein COX II. Here, we report a new mechanism of EGFR-c-Src synergy through choline kinase α (CHKA). The first enzyme of the phosphatidyl choline production pathway, CHKA, is overexpressed in many cancers, and the product of the enzyme, phosphocholine, is also increased in tumor cells. In this report, we find that CHKA forms a complex with EGFR in a c-Src-dependent manner. Endogenous CHKA and EGFR co-immunoprecipitated from a variety of breast cancer cell lines and immortalized mammary epithelial cells. CHKA interacted with the EGFR kinase domain upon c-Src co-overexpression and was phosphorylated in a c-Src-dependent manner on Y197 and Y333. Overexpression of EGFR and c-Src increased total cellular activity and protein levels of CHKA. Mutation of CHKA Y197 and Y333 reduced complex formation, EGFR-dependent activation of CHKA enzyme activity and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-dependent DNA synthesis. Furthermore, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of CHKA in MCF-7 and MCF-10A cells reduced EGF-dependent cell proliferation. Together, these results strongly implicate a new c-Src-dependent link between CHKA and EGFR, which contributes to the regulation of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2009135994,"The Escherichia coli B strain BL21(DE3) has had a profound impact on biotechnology through its use in the production of recombinant proteins. Little is understood, however, regarding the physiology of this important E. coli strain. We show here that BL21(DE3) totally lacks activity of the four [NiFe]-hydrogenases, the three molybdenum- and selenium-containing formate dehydrogenases and molybdenum-dependent nitrate reductase. Nevertheless, all of the structural genes necessary for the synthesis of the respective anaerobic metalloenzymes are present in the genome. However, the genes encoding the high-affinity molybdate transport system and the molybdenum-responsive transcriptional regulator ModE are absent from the genome. Moreover, BL21(DE3) has a nonsense mutation in the gene encoding the global oxygen-responsive transcriptional regulator FNR. The activities of the two hydrogen-oxidizing hydrogenases, therefore, could be restored to BL21(DE3) by supplementing the growth medium with high concentrations of Ni2+ (Ni2+-transport is FNR-dependent) or by introducing a wild-type copy of the fnr gene. Only combined addition of plasmid-encoded fnr and high concentrations of MoO42− ions could restore hydrogen production to BL21(DE3); however, to only 25–30% of a K-12 wildtype. We could show that limited hydrogen production from the enzyme complex responsible for formate-dependent hydrogen evolution was due solely to reduced activity of the formate dehydrogenase (FDH-H), not the hydrogenase component. The activity of the FNR-dependent formate dehydrogenase, FDH-N, could not be restored, even when the fnr gene and MoO42− were supplied; however, nitrate reductase activity could be recovered by combined addition of MoO42− and the fnr gene. This suggested that a further component specific for biosynthesis or activity of formate dehydrogenases H and N was missing. Re-introduction of the gene encoding ModE could only partially restore the activities of both enzymes. Taken together these results demonstrate that BL21(DE3) has major defects in anaerobic metabolism, metal ion transport and metalloprotein biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2069748842,"IL-17 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine implicated in autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. The development/survival of IL-17-producing CD4 T cells (Th17) share critical cues with B-cell differentiation and the circulating follicular T helper subset was recently shown to be enriched in Th17 cells able to help B-cell differentiation. We investigated a putative link between Th17-cell homeostasis and B cells by studying the Th17-cell compartment in primary B-cell immunodeficiencies. Common Variable Immunodeficiency Disorders (CVID), defined by defects in B-cell differentiation into plasma and memory B cells, are frequently associated with autoimmune and inflammatory manifestations but we found no relationship between these and Th17-cell frequency. In fact, CVID patients showed a decrease in Th17-cell frequency in parallel with the expansion of activated non-differentiated B cells (CD21lowCD38low). Moreover, Congenital Agammaglobulinemia patients, lacking B cells due to impaired early B-cell development, had a severe reduction of circulating Th17 cells. Finally, we found a direct correlation in healthy individuals between circulating Th17-cell frequency and both switched-memory B cells and serum BAFF levels, a crucial cytokine for B-cell survival. Overall, our data support a relationship between Th17-cell homeostasis and B-cell maturation, with implications for the understanding of the pathogenesis of inflammatory/autoimmune diseases and the physiology of B-cell depleting therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2063454608,"Malignant gliomas are one of the most devastating and incurable tumors. Sustained excessive angiogenesis by glioma cells is the major reason for their uncontrolled growth and resistance toward conventional therapies resulting in high mortality. Therefore, targeting angiogenesis should be a logical strategy to prevent or control glioma cell growth. Earlier studies have shown that Asiatic Acid (AsA), a pentacyclic triterpenoid, is effective against glioma and other cancer cells; however, its efficacy against angiogenesis remains unknown. In the present study, we examined the anti-angiogenic efficacy of AsA using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC). Our results showed that AsA (5–20 µM) inhibits HUVEC growth and induces apoptotic cell death by activating caspases (3 and 9) and modulating the expression of apoptosis regulators Bad, survivin and pAkt-ser473. Further, AsA showed a dose-dependent inhibition of HUVEC migration, invasion and capillary tube formation, and disintegrated preformed capillary network. AsA also inhibited the VEGF-stimulated growth and capillary tube formation by HUVEC and HBMEC. Next, we analyzed the angiogenic potential of conditioned media collected from human glioma LN18 and U87-MG cells treated with either DMSO (control conditioned media, CCM) or AsA 20 µM (AsA20 conditioned media, AsA20CM). CCM from glioma cells significantly enhanced the capillary tube formation in both HUVEC and HBMEC, while capillary tube formation in both endothelial cell lines was greatly compromised in the presence of AsA20CM. Consistent with these results, VEGF expression was lesser in AsA20CM compared to CCM, and indeed AsA strongly inhibited VEGF level (both cellular and secreted) in glioma cells. AsA also showed dose-dependent anti-angiogenic efficacy in Matrigel plug assay, and inhibited the glioma cells potential to attract HUVEC/HBMEC. Overall, the present study clearly showed the strong anti-angiogenic potential of AsA and suggests its usefulness against malignant gliomas."

Here I show how disciplines with a high likelihood of nepotism can be detected using standard statistical techniques based on shared last names among professors. As an example, I analyze the set of all 61,340 Italian academics. I find that nepotism is prominent in Italy, with particular disciplinary sectors being detected as especially problematic. Out of 28 disciplines, 9 - accounting for more than half of Italian professors - display a significant paucity of last names. Moreover, in most disciplines a clear north-south trend emerges, with likelihood of nepotism increasing with latitude. Even accounting for the geographic clustering of last names, I find that for many disciplines the probability of name-sharing is boosted when professors work in the same institution or sub-discipline. Using these techniques policy makers can target cuts and funding in order to promote fair practices."
https://openalex.org/W1966524607,"The MYCN gene has a critical role in determining the clinical behavior of neuroblastoma. Although it is known that genomic amplification occurs in high-risk subsets, it remains unclear how MYCN expression is regulated in the pathogenesis of neuroblastomas. Here, we report that MYCN expression was regulated by the oncoprotein MDM2 at the post-transcriptional level and was associated with neuroblastoma cell growth. Increasing MDM2 by ectopic overexpression in the cytoplasm enhanced both mRNA and protein expression of MYCN. Mechanistic studies found that the C-terminal RING domain of the MDM2 protein bound to the MYCN mRNA's AREs within the 3′UTR and increased MYCN 3′UTR-mediated mRNA stability and translation. Conversely, MDM2 silencing by specific siRNA rendered the MYCN mRNA unstable and reduced the abundance of the MYCN protein in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines. Importantly, this MDM2 silencing resulted in a remarkable inhibition of neuroblastoma cell growth and induction of cell death through a p53-independent pathway. Our results indicate that MDM2 has a p53-independent role in the regulation of both MYCN mRNA stabilization and its translation, suggesting that MDM2-mediated MYCN expression is one mechanism associated with growth of MYCN-associated neuroblastoma and disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2020233785,"The dopamine transporter (DAT) is a principal regulator of dopaminergic neurotransmission and its gene (the SLC6A3) is a strong biological candidate gene for various behavioral- and neurological disorders. Intense investigation of the link between the SLC6A3 polymorphisms and behavioral phenotypes yielded inconsistent and even contradictory results. Reliance on objective brain phenotype measures, for example, those afforded by brain imaging, might critically improve detection of DAT genotype-phenotype association. Here, we tested the relationship between the DAT brain availability and the SLC6A3 genotypes using an aggregate sample of 95 healthy participants of several imaging studies. These studies employed positron emission tomography (PET) with [11C]cocaine wherein the DAT availability was estimated as Bmax/Kd; while the genotype values were obtained on two repeat polymorphisms - 3-UTR- and intron 8- VNTRs. The main findings are the following: 1) both polymorphisms analyzed as single genetic markers and in combination (haplotype) modulate DAT density in midbrain; 2) ethnic background and age influence the strength of these associations; and 3) age-related changes in DAT availability differ in the 3-UTR and intron8 – genotype groups."
https://openalex.org/W1991256030,"Scaffold proteins form multiprotein complexes that are central to the regulation of intracellular signaling. The scaffold protein ezrin–radixin–moesin-binding phosphoprotein 50 (EBP50) is highly expressed at the plasma membrane of normal biliary epithelial cells and binds epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a tyrosine kinase receptor with oncogenic properties. This study investigated EBP50–EGFR interplay in biliary cancer. We report that in a collection of 106 cholangiocarcinomas, EBP50 was delocalized to the cytoplasm of tumor cells in 66% of the cases. Ectopic expression of EBP50 was correlated with the presence of satellite nodules and with the expression of EGFR, which was at the plasma membrane, implying a loss of interaction with EBP50 in these cases. In vitro, loss of interaction between EBP50 and EGFR was mimicked by EBP50 depletion using a small interfering RNA approach in human biliary carcinoma cells co-expressing the two proteins at their plasma membrane, and in which interaction between EBP50 and EGFR was validated. EBP50 depletion caused an increase in EGFR expression at their surface, and a sustained activation of the receptor and of its downstream effectors (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) in both basal and EGF-stimulated conditions. Cells lacking EBP50 showed epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-associated features, including reduction in E-cadherin and cytokeratin-19 expression, induction of S100A4 and of the E-cadherin transcriptional repressor, Slug, and loss of cell polarity. Accordingly, depletion of EBP50 induced the disruption of adherens junctional complexes, the development of lamellipodia structures and the subsequent acquisition of motility properties. All these phenotypic changes were prevented upon inhibition of EGFR tyrosine kinase by gefitinib. These findings indicate that loss of EBP50 at the plasma membrane in tumor cells may contribute to biliary carcinogenesis through EGFR activation."
https://openalex.org/W2032267604,"Elevated expression of the prostaglandin synthase cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is commonly observed in many chronic inflammatory diseases and cancer. However, the mechanisms allowing for pathogenic COX-2 overexpression are largely unknown. The gene for COX-2 (PTGS2) carries a common single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at position 8473 (T8473C), in exon 10 that is associated with diseases in which COX-2 overexpression is a contributing factor. We demonstrate that the T8473C SNP resides within a region that targets COX-2 mRNA for degradation through microRNA-mediated regulation. miR-542-3p was identified to bind transcripts derived from the 8473T allele and promote mRNA decay. By contrast, the presence of the variant 8473C allele interfered with miR-542-3p binding, allowing for mRNA stabilization, and this effect was rescued using a mutated miR-542-3p at the respective 8473 site. Colon cancer cells and tissue displayed COX-2 mRNA levels that were dependent on T8473C allele dosage, and allele-specific expression of COX-2 was observed to be a contributing factor promoting COX-2 overexpression. These findings provide a novel molecular explanation underlying disease susceptibility associated with COX-2 T8473C SNP, and identify it as a potential marker for identifying cancer patients best served through selective COX-2 inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2029527327,"Data from several previous studies examining heart-rate and cardiovascular risk have hinted at a possible relationship between heart-rate and non-cardiac mortality. We thus systematically examined the predictive value of heart-rate variables on the subsequent risk of death from cancer.In the Paris Prospective Study I, 6101 asymptomatic French working men aged 42 to 53 years, free of clinically detectable cardiovascular disease and cancer, underwent a standardized graded exercise test between 1967 and 1972. Resting heart-rate, heart-rate increase during exercise, and decrease during recovery were measured. Change in resting heart-rate over 5 years was also available in 5139 men. Mortality including 758 cancer deaths was assessed over the 25 years of follow-up.There were strong, graded and significant relationships between all heart-rate parameters and subsequent cancer deaths. After adjustment for age and tobacco consumption and, compared with the lowest quartile, those with the highest quartile for resting heart-rate had a relative risk of 2.4 for cancer deaths (95% confidence interval: 1.9-2.9, p<0.0001) This was similar after adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors and was observed for the commonest malignancies (respiratory and gastrointestinal). Similarly, significant relationships with cancer death were observed between poor heart rate increase during exercise, poor decrease during recovery and greater heart-rate increase over time (p<0.0001 for all).Resting and exercise heart rate had consistent, graded and highly significant associations with subsequent cancer mortality in men."
https://openalex.org/W2149930394,"The angiogenic switch is a fundamental process for many diseases and for tumor growth. The main proangiogenic stimulus is hypoxia, through activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α pathway in endothelial cells (ECs). We have previously shown that the vasostatin-1 (VS-1) fragment of chromogranin A inhibits TNF-α-induced vessel permeability and VEGF-induced EC proliferation, together with migration and matrix invasion, which are all critical steps in angiogenesis. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of VS-1 on tumor angiogenesis. We found mouse mammary adenocarcinomas (TS/A), genetically engineered to secrete VS-1 (TS/A 1B8), to be characterized by reduced vascular density and more regular vessels, compared with nontransfected tumors [TS/A wild type (WT)]. Supernatants from TS/A WT cells, but not those from TS/A 1B8, generated tip cells and promoted the permeability of primary human umbilical vein ECs, via VE-cadherin redistribution and cytoskeletal disorganization. These effects were abrogated by mAb 5A8, a VS-1-blocking antibody. Furthermore, VS-1 inhibited hypoxia-driven EC morphological changes, VE-cadherin redistribution, intercellular gap formation, tube morphogenesis, and HIF-1α nuclear translocation in vitro.

https://openalex.org/W1971345156,"Oncoprotein C-MYC is overexpressed in human metastatic melanomas and melanoma-derived cells where it is required for the suppression of oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). The genetic events that maintain high levels of C-MYC in melanoma cells and their role in OIS are unknown. Here we report that C-MYC in cells from several randomly chosen melanoma lines was upregulated at the protein level, and largely because of the increased protein stability. Of all known regulators of C-MYC stability, levels of B56α subunit of the PP2A tumor suppressor complex were substantially suppressed in all human melanoma cells compared with normal melanocytes. Accordingly, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the lowest and the highest amounts of PP2A-B56α were predominantly detected in metastatic melanoma tissues and in primary melanomas from patients with good clinical outcome, respectively. Importantly, PP2A-B56α overexpression suppressed C-MYC in melanoma cells and induced OIS, whereas depletion of PP2A-B56α in normal human melanocytes upregulated C-MYC protein levels and suppressed BRAF(V600E)- and, less efficiently, NRAS(Q61R)-induced senescence. Our data reveal a mechanism of C-MYC overexpression in melanoma cells and identify a functional role for PP2A-B56α in OIS of melanocytic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2070240402,"Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) represent an interesting candidate for cell therapy and could be obtained from olfactory mucosa (OM-OECs) or olfactory bulbs (OB-OECs). Recent reports suggest that, depending on their origin, OECs display different functional properties. We show here the complementary and additive effects of co-transplanting OM-OECs and OB-OECs after lesion of a peripheral nerve. For this, a selective motor denervation of the laryngeal muscles was performed by a section/anastomosis of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN). Two months after surgery, recovery of the laryngeal movements and synkinesis phenonema were analyzed by videolaryngoscopy. To complete these assessments, measure of latency and potential duration were determined by electrophysiological recordings and myelinated nerve fiber profiles were defined based on toluidine blue staining. To explain some of the mechanisms involved, tracking of GFP positive OECs was performed. It appears that transplantation of OM-OECs or OB-OECs displayed opposite abilities to improve functional recovery. Indeed, OM-OECs increased recuperation of laryngeal muscles activities without appropriate functional recovery. In contrast, OB-OECs induced some functional recovery by enhancing axonal regrowth. Importantly, co-transplantation of OM-OECs and OB-OECs supported a major functional recovery, with reduction of synkinesis phenomena. This study is the first which clearly demonstrates the complementary and additive properties of OECs obtained from olfactory mucosa and olfactory bulb to improve functional recovery after transplantation in a nerve lesion model."
https://openalex.org/W2213828346,"The ErbB receptors, such as ErbB-1 and ErbB-2, have been intensely pursued as targets for cancer therapeutics. Although initially efficacious in a subset of patients, drugs targeting these receptors led invariably to resistance, which is often associated with reactivation of the ErbB-3-PI3K-Akt signaling. This may be overcome by an ErbB-3 ligand that abrogates receptor-mediated signaling. Toward this end, we have generated a mouse monoclonal antibody, MP-RM-1, against the extracellular domain (ECD) of ErbB-3 receptor. Assessment of human tumor cell lines, as well as early passage tumor cells revealed that MP-RM-1 effectively inhibited both NRG-1β-dependent and -independent ErbB-3 activation. The antagonizing effect of MP-RM-1 was of non-competitive type, as binding of [125I]-labeled NRG-1β to ErbB-3 was not influenced by the antibody. MP-RM-1 treatment led, in most instances, to decreased ErbB-3 expression. In addition, MP-RM-1 was able to inhibit the colony formation ability of tumor cells and tumor growth in two human tumor xenograft nude mouse models. Treatment with the antibody was associated with a decreased ErbB-3 and Akt phosphorylation and ErbB-3 expression in the excised tumor tissue. Collectively, these results indicate that MP-RM-1 has the potential to interfere with signaling by ErbB-3 and reinforce the notion that ErbB-3 could be a key target in cancer-drug design."

We developed a mAb to CAPC and used it to characterize the protein and study its function. CAPC protein was detected in normal prostate and salivary gland, in several human breast cancer cell lines and in the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. Knockdown of CAPC by siRNA in LNCaP cells enhanced anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. Conversely, overexpression of CAPC in MDA-231 breast cancer cells and A431 epidermoid cancer cells inhibited growth in soft agar and tumorigenesis in nude mice, and suppressed the metastasis of MDA-231 cells to the lung. Overexpression of CAPC downregulated NF-κB activity and its target genes, including GM-CSF (CSF2), CXCL1, IL8 and LTB1. It also suppressed genes encoding the serine protease mesotrypsin (PRSS3) and cystatin SN (CST1). CAPC expressing tumors showed a decrease in the number of proliferating cells and a large increase in ECM. The role of CAPC in the suppression of tumor growth and metastasis may be through its alteration of the tumor microenvironment."

Since recent research has identified the anti-inflammatory properties of statins (besides their lipid-lowering effects), we investigated the effect of fluvastatin on the production of the potent neutrophil chemoattractant chemokine, IL-8, in whole blood from CF patients, stimulated by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (LPS) and Aspergillus fumigatus (AFA) antigens.Whole blood from adult patients with CF and from healthy volunteers was collected at the Rennes University Hospital (France). Blood was pretreated for 1 h with fluvastatin (0-300 µM) and incubated for 24 h with LPS (10 µg/mL) and/or AFA (diluted 1/200). IL-8 protein levels, quantified by ELISA, were increased in a concentration-dependent manner when cells were stimulated by LPS or AFA. Fluvastatin strongly decreased the levels of IL-8, in a concentration-dependent manner, in whole blood from CF patients. However, its inhibitory effect was decreased or absent in whole blood from healthy subjects. Furthermore, the inhibition induced by fluvastatin in CF whole blood was reversed in the presence of intermediates within the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, mevalonate, farnesyl pyprophosphate or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate that activate small GTPases by isoprenylation.For the first time, the inhibitory effects of fluvastatin on CF systemic inflammation may reveal the important therapeutic potential of statins in pathological conditions associated with the over-production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines as observed during the manifestation of CF. The anti-inflammatory effect could be related to the modulation of the prenylation of signalling proteins."

Here we demonstrate that combining deletion of ICP8 and vhs with virus-based expression of B7 costimulation molecules created a vaccine strain that enhanced T cell responses to HSV-1 compared with the ICP8−vhs− parental strain, and reduced the incidence of keratitis and acute infection of the nervous system after corneal challenge. Post-challenge T cell infiltration of the trigeminal ganglia and antigen-specific recall responses in local lymph nodes correlated with protection.

https://openalex.org/W2084414466,"One of the two X chromosomes in female mammalian cells is subject to inactivation (XCI) initiated by the Xist gene. In this study, we examined in rodents (voles and rat) the conservation of the microsatellite region DXPas34, the Tsix gene (antisense counterpart of Xist), and enhancer Xite that have been shown to flank Xist and regulate XCI in mouse. We have found that mouse regions of the Tsix gene major promoter and minisatellite repeat DXPas34 are conserved among rodents. We have also shown that in voles and rat the region homologous to the mouse Tsix major promoter, initiates antisense to Xist transcription and terminates around the Xist gene start site as is observed with mouse Tsix. A conservation of Tsix expression pattern in voles, rat and mice suggests a crucial role of the antisense transcription in regulation of Xist and XIC in rodents. Most surprisingly, we have found that voles lack the regions homologous to the regulatory element Xite, which is instead replaced with the Slc7a3 gene that is unassociated with the X-inactivation centre in any other eutherians studied. Furthermore, we have not identified any transcription that could have the same functions as murine Xite in voles. Overall, our data show that not all the functional elements surrounding Xist in mice are well conserved even within rodents, thereby suggesting that the regulation of XCI may be at least partially taxon-specific."

Both the breadth and magnitude of the CTL response, particularly against the p24 region, positively correlated with CD4+ T cell count and inversely correlated with HIV viral load. The breadth of OLP response was also associated with slower progression to antiretroviral therapy initiation. Statistical analysis and single peptide ELISpot assay identified at least 17 significant associations between reactive OLP and HLA in 12 OLP regions; 6 OLP-HLA associations (35.3%) were not compatible with previously reported CTL epitopes, suggesting that these contained new CTL Gag epitopes.
