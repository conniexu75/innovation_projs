The polarization is out-of-plane and has opposite sign for the two edges, consistent with the predictions of the spin Hall effect. Measurements of unstrained gallium arsenide and strained indium gallium arsenide samples reveal that strain modifies spin accumulation at zero magnetic field. A weak dependence on crystal orientation for the strained samples suggests that the mechanism is the extrinsic spin Hall effect."

Our recent work demonstrates that depletion of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) constitutes one of the key molecular events for HSC activation and that ectopic expression of this nuclear receptor achieves the phenotypic reversal of activated HSC to the quiescent cells. The present study extends these findings to test a novel hypothesis that adipogenic transcriptional regulation is required for the maintenance of HSC quiescence. Comparative analysis of quiescent and activated HSC in culture reveals higher expression of putative adipogenic transcription factors such as CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) α, C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, PPARγ, liver X receptor α, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c and of adipocyte-specific genes in the quiescent cells. Conversely, activated HSC have increased expression of PPARβ, a transcription factor known to promote fatty acid oxidation. A treatment of activated HSC with the adipocyte differentiation mixture (isobutylmethylxanthine, dexamethasone, and insulin) or ectopic expression of PPARγ or SREBP-1c in these cells, induces a panel of adipogenic transcription factors, reduces PPARβ, and causes the phenotypic reversal to quiescent HSC. These results support the importance of adipogenic transcriptional regulation in HSC quiescence and provide a new framework for identifying novel molecular targets for the treatment of liver cirrhosis.

Transdifferentiated (activated) HSC are proliferative, proinflammatory, and fibrogenic with induced ability to synthesize and deposit extracellular matrices (1Friedman S.L. J. Hepatol. 2003; 38: S38-S53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, better understanding of the mechanism underlying HSC transdifferentiation is the pivotal step toward identification of molecular targets for new and effective treatments for the disease. The most fundamental prerequisite for the understanding of HSC transdifferentiation is defining the cell type of differentiated HSC. This question relates to the origin of HSC that continues to puzzle the field. HSC are believed to serve as pericytes for hepatic capillaries called sinusoids. They represent 5–8% of total liver cells and 15–23% of nonparenchymal cells in the normal liver (2Geerts A. Semin. Liver Dis. 2001; 21: 311-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). HSC are positive for a mesenchymal marker such as vimentin. Rodent HSC express desmin (3Yokoi Y. Namihisa T. Kuroda H. Komatsu I. Miyazaki A. Watanabe S. Usui K. Hepatology. 1984; 4: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (4Gard A.L. White F.P. Dutton G.R. J. Neuroimmunol. 1985; 8: 359-375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), suggesting smooth muscle cell and glial cell lineage, respectively. Upon activation, both rodent and human HSC lose vitamin A and begin to express α-smooth muscle actin (5Ramadori G. Veit T. Schwogler S. Dienes H.P. Knittel T. Meyer zum Rieder H. Buschenfelde K.H. Virchows Arch. B Cell Pathol. Incl. Mol. Pathol. 1990; 59: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 6Enzan H. Himeno H. Iwamura S. Saibara T. Onishi S. Yamamoto Y. Hara H. Virchows Arch. 1994; 424: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Interestingly, undifferentiated HSC in fetal livers that do not yet exhibit vitamin A storage also express α-smooth muscle actin (7Suskind D.L. Muench M.O. J. Hepatol. 2004; 40: 261-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), supporting a smooth muscle cell lineage. Synaptophysin, which controls exocytosis and the release of neurotransmitters in neurons and neuroendocrine cells, is also expressed in both rodent and human HSC (8Cassiman D. van Pelt J. De Vos R. Lommel VanF. Desmet V. Yap S.H. Roskams T. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 1831-1839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Neurotrophins such as nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neutrophin NT-3, and NT-4/5 are also expressed (9Cassiman D. Denef C. Desmet V.J. Roskams T. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 148-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and so are their receptors, Trk-A, B, and C (9Cassiman D. Denef C. Desmet V.J. Roskams T.

Pathol. 2000; 156: 1235-1243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), further supporting the neural and glial lineage. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) has been proposed as a potential molecular target for inhibition of HSC transdifferentiation (11Miyahara T. Schrum L. Rippe R. Xiong S.

Surrenti C. Casini A. Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 1924-1940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). PPARγ level and activity are reduced in activated HSC, and the treatment of HSC with synthetic ligands for PPARγ such as thiazolidinediones effectively suppresses fibrogenic activity of HSC in vitro (11Miyahara T. Schrum L. Rippe R. Xiong S. Yee Jr., H.F. Motomura K. Anania F.A. Willson T.M. Tsukamoto H. J. Biol.

Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 1924-1940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) and in vivo in experimental animals (13Galli A. Crabb D.W. Ceni E. Salzano R. Mello T. Svegliati-Baroni G. Ridolfi F. Trozzi L. Surrenti C. Casini A. Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 1924-1940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). However, these ligands are known to have PPARγ-independent effects (14Chawla A. Barak Y. Nagy L. Liao D. Tontonoz P. Evans R.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar), and it was yet to be tested whether PPARγ per se had a direct effect to suppress activation of HSC. To address this question, our laboratory has recently expressed PPARγ1 by an adenoviral vector in culture-activated HSC. This manipulation reversed their phenotype to that of quiescent HSC with reduced expression of activation markers such as TGFβ1 or α1(I) procollagen and restored the ability to accumulate retinyl esters (15Hazra S. Xiong S. Wang J. Rippe R.A. Krishna V. Chatterjee K. Tsukamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11392-11401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). More importantly, the fact that PPARγ is required for the maintenance of differentiated HSC highlights an analogy between differentiation of adipocytes and that of HSC (Fig. 1). PPARγ is considered as a master transcriptional regulator for adipogenesis, and along with other putative transcription factors such as C/EBPα, β, and δ and SREBP-1, it induces adipocyte-specific genes to promote adipocytic differentiation as demonstrated in preadipocytes such as 3T3L1 cells exposed to the adipocyte differentiation mixture (16MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 345-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar, 17Morrison R.F. Farmer S.R. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 3116S-3121SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). If these cells are treated with mediators such as cytokines (tumor necrosis factor α and leptin) or growth factors (platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor/TGFα, and TGFβ) that suppress the activity of PPARγ and adipogenic transcriptional regulation, adipocyte differentiation is inhibited and preadipocyte differentiation ensues (18Zhang B. Berger J. Hu E. Szalkowski D. White-Carrington S. Spiegelman B.M. Moller D.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1457-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 19Camp H.S. Tafuri S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10811-10816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 20Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 377-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Interestingly, these are the same mediators that are also implicated in activation/transdifferentiation of HSC (21Pinzani M. Marra F. Semin. Liver Dis. 2001; 21: 397-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In fact, our recent work demonstrates that PPARγ activity is inhibited in HSC in a manner similar to that previously observed in adipocytes by the treatment with tumor necrosis factor α (22Sung C.K. She H. Xiong S. Tsukamoto H. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: G722-G729Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) that is known to cause early activation of HSC (21Pinzani M. Marra F. Semin. Liver Dis. 2001; 21: 397-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Indeed, HSC was once called “fat-storing cells” because of their lipid content (23Ito T. Nemoto M. Okajima. Folia Anat. Jpn. 1952; 24: 243-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and they do store neutral lipids besides retinyl esters (24Yamada M. Blaner W.S. Soprano D.R. Dixon J.L. Kjeldbye H.M. Goodman D.S. Hepatology. 1987; 7: 1224-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Upon activation, HSC lose lipid content and become myofibroblastic with induced expression of type I and III collagen. Preadipocytes also have a fibroblastic phenotype with expression of these interstitial collagens. During adipocyte differentiation, this matrix expression shifts to that of basement membrane components including type IV collagen, laminin, entactin, and glycosaminoglycans (25Weiner F.R. Shah A. Smith P.J. Rubin C.S. Zern M.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4094-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This is also a profile of extracellular matrices expressed by quiescent HSC in the perisinusoidal space of the liver. Based on these analogies, we proposed that the maintenance of the quiescent HSC phenotype requires transcriptional regulation similar if not identical to that known for adipocyte differentiation. To test this hypothesis, the present study examined the expression of putative adipogenic transcription factors in quiescent and culture-activated HSC, as well as PPARγ-transduced HSC. We also tested the effects of the adipocyte differentiation mixture (isobutylmethylxanthine, dexamethazone, and insulin (MDI)) on activated HSC. Finally, we transduced SREBP-1c via an adenoviral vector in activated HSC to restore its expression and to determine its effects on HSC phenotype. Our results indeed reveal that the expression of adipogenic transcription factors are high in quiescent rat HSC, and their levels rapidly decline during culture-induced transdifferentiation to myofibroblastic cells. Further, the MDI treatment or ectopic expression of PPARγ or SREBP-1c restores expression of the adipogenic transcription factors and reverses fully activated HSC to quiescent HSC. Materials—3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, dexamethasone, insulin, and Oil Red O were purchased from Sigma. Rhodamine phalloidin (R-415) was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Antibodies against C/EBPβ (C-19), C/EBPδ (M-17), SREBP-1 (2A4), PPARγ (H-100), PPARβ (H-74), Kruppel-like factor 6/Zf9 (R-173), and β-tubulin (H-235) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Type I collagen antibody was purchased from Rockland Inc. (Gilbertsville, PA). Primary Hepatic Stellate Cell Isolation and Culture—HSC were isolated from normal Wistar rats by in situ digestion of the liver and arabinogalactan gradient ultracentrifugation as described previously (26Tsukamoto H. Cheng S. Blaner W.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G581-G586PubMed Google Scholar). The purity of the cells was determined by phase contrast microscopy and ultraviolet-excited fluorescence microscopy, and the viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion (purity > 96%, viability > 94%). In vitro activation of HSC was achieved by culturing HSC on in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1.0 g/liter glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum on a plastic dish for 3 or 7 days. They were treated with the adipogenic differentiation mixture (MDI, 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 1 μm insulin) and incubated for 24 or 72 h. Infection with Adenoviral Expression Vectors—Adenoviral vector for PPARγ1 was constructed as described before (15Hazra S. Xiong S. Wang J. Rippe R.A. Krishna V. Chatterjee K. Tsukamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11392-11401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 27Gurnell M. Wentworth J.M. Agostini M. Adams M. Collingwood T.N. Provenzano C. Browne P.O.

Adenoviral vector for SREBP-1c (28Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1096-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar) was provided by Dr. Bruce M. Spiegelman of Harvard University. These vectors facilitated efficient transduction of PPARγ1 or SREBP-1c in activated HSC for examination of their effects on the HSC phenotype and expression of other adipogenic transcription factors. These vectors also expressed GFP for assessment of the transduction, and the vector expressing GFP only was used as a control. Typically, HSC cultured on plastic for 7 days were infected by the vector with a MOI of 25 (SREBP-1c) or 50 (PPARγ) for 2–4 days depending on the cellular parameter to be examined. Generally, more than 75% of HSC were GFP positive at 24 h following the addition of viruses. Stress Fiber and Lipid Staining—HSC cultured in 24-well plates or slide chambers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde. The cells were then washed and stained with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (R-415, 1:50 v/v, 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) in the dark. After washing with PBS, stress fiber fluorescence images were viewed by a confocal microscope (Nikon PCM 2000) equipped with Compix Imaging systems. For lipid staining, HSC were fixed with 10% formalin in PBS. Oil Red O (0.5% (w/v) in isopropanol) was diluted with 67% volume of water, filtered, and added to the fixed HSC. HSC were then washed, and the stained lipid droplets were visualized and photographed. RNA Extraction and Real Time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent by Invitrogen. For real time PCR analysis for PPARγ, liver X receptor α (LXRα), α1(I) procollagen, TGFβ1, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (15Hazra S. Xiong S. Wang J. Rippe R.A. Krishna V. Chatterjee K. Tsukamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11392-11401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), 5 ng of total RNA were reverse transcribed and amplified by 40 cycles using the TaqMan Gold reverse transcriptase-PCR kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Each Ct value was first normalized to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase Ct value of a sample and subsequently to a control sample. For real time PCR for C/EBPα, Insig-1, ACC, FAS, and 36B4, the SyBer Green technique was used. The sequences of the primers and the probes used for real time PCR are listed in Table I. For validation of adipocyte-specific genes, reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis was performed for adipsin and resistin. The PCR primers used for these genes are as follows: 5′-ATGAGCAGTGGGTGCTGAG and 5′-AGAACGTTTTCAATCCACGG (adipsin); 5′-GAACCTTTCATTTCTCCTC and 5′-GTGACACATTGTATCCTCAC (resistin).Table IPrimers and probes used for real time PCRGeneAccession numberForward/reverse primersProbesPPARγNM_0131245′-CCTGAAGCTCCAAGAATACCAAA5′-CGATCAAAGTAGAGCCTGCGTCCCC5′-AGAGTTGGGTTTTTTCAGAATAATAAGGLXRαQ626855′-GGCCCTGCATGCCTATGT5′-CATCAACCACCCCCACGACCGA5′-CATTAGCATCCGTGGGAACAα1(I) collagenXM_2134405′-TCGATTCACCTACAGCACGC5′-TGTGGATGGCTGCACGAGTCACAC5′-GACTGTCTTGCCCCAAGTTCCTGFβ1NM_0215785′-AGAAGTCACCCGCGTGCTA5′-TGGTGGACCGCAACAACGCAAT5′-TGTGTGATGTCTTTGGTTTTGTCAGAPDHaGAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseM177015′-TGCACCACCAACTGCTTAG5′-CAGAAGACTGTGGATGGCCCCAC5′-GGATGCAGGGATGATGTTCC/EBPαbSYBR primersNM_0125245′-AAGAAGTCGGTGGATAAGAACAG5′-GTTGCGCTGTTTGGCTTTATCTCACCbSYBR primersNM_0221935′-CCCAACAGAATAAAGCTACTCTGG5′-TCCTTTTGTGCAACTAGGAACGTFASbSYBR primersNM_0173325′-CCTGGACAGCATTCCAAACCT5′-AGCACATCTCGAAGGCTACACAInsig-1bSYBR primersQ087555′-TGCAGATCCAGCGGAATGT5′-CCAGGCGGAGGAGAAGATG36B4bSYBR primersNM_0224025′-TTCCCACTGGCTGAAAAGGT5′-CGCAGCCGCAAATGCa GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseb SYBR primers Open table in a new tab Preparation of Cellular Protein and Immunoblot Analysis—Total cell lysates were prepared with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitor mixture). The protein extracts were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated with primary antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by the ECL detection system (Pierce). Gene Expression Array Analysis—The GEArray pathway-specific expression array kit (SuperArray Inc., Bethesda, MD) was used for gene profiling of adipogenesis-related genes in HSC cultured on plastic for 1 or 7 days. Total RNA was extracted as above and reverse-transcribed for the preparation of 32P-labeled cDNA. The probes were hybridized to a cDNA expression array membrane consisting of 96 genes related to adipogenesis. The relative expression level of a given mRNA was assessed by normalizing to a housekeeping gene (cyclophilin A) and comparing with a control value. Lipid Synthesis—Day 3 HSC were treated with MDI or Me2SO (vehicle) for 5 days and then incubated with [14C]acetic acid (1 μCi/ml) for 3 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The cells were lysed with ethanol followed by the addition of chloroform and vortexing. After mixing gently with HCl (0.1 n) and centrifugation (500 × g for 30 min), the isolated organic phase was dried under N2 (45Lawler Jr., J.F. Yin M. Diehl A.M. Roberts E. Chatterjee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5053-5059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and the lipid extracts were separated by TLC with dichloroethane-acetic acid (100:1, v/v) on silica gel plates. Cellular 14C-labeled triacylglycerol spots were exposed in a phosphorus imager and quantitated with Kodak one-dimensional image analysis software (EDAS 290). Data Analysis—The numerical data were expressed as the means ± S.D. Student's t test was performed to assess the statistical significance between the two sets of data, and p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. Putative adipogenic transcription factors are expressed in quiescent HSC. Freshly isolated rat HSC retain their quiescent phenotype with distinct stellate morphology and intracellular storage of vitamin A when cultured on plastic for 1–2 days. They begin to be activated by day 3 in culture and become fully activated by day 7 as morphologically characterized by a large, spread out, polygonal cell shape with large nuclei and lost vitamin A storage (29Friedman S.L. Wei S. Blaner W.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G947-G952PubMed Google Scholar). We first analyzed the expression of transcription factors known to be involved in adipocyte differentiation in day 1 (quiescent), day 3 (activating), and day 7 (fully activated) HSC by immunoblot or real time PCR analysis. Among the transcription factors examined, C/EBPβ (liver-enriched transcriptional activator protein) and an active, nuclear form of SREBP-1c (nSREBP-1c) were abundant in quiescent HSC as easily detected by immunoblot analysis, and their expression declined in day 3 and day 7 cells (Fig. 2A). C/EBPβ is known to be involved in a clonal expansion of preadipocytes following adipogenic stimulation (16MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 345-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar, 17Morrison R.F. Farmer S.R. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 3116S-3121SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas SREBP-1c causes transcriptional induction of genes involved in fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis (30Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3632) Google Scholar). C/EBPβ also has a splice variant (liver-enriched transcriptional inhibitor protein) that acts as a negative regulator (31Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Indeed, our immunoblotting detected liver-enriched transcriptional inhibitor protein in quiescent HSC but with less intensity, and its level also diminished in culture activation (data not shown). We detected mostly nSREBP-1 (molecular mass = 68 kDa) (Fig. 2A) but a minimal if not undetectable level of precursor form of SREBP-1 (molecular mass = 125 kDa) in quiescent HSC (data not shown). PPARγ, LXRα, and C/EBPα were difficult to be detected by immunoblotting because of either the lack of optimal antibodies or low levels of expression. Thus, their expression were analyzed by real time PCR, and the data were normalized to those on day 1 (Fig. 2B). The mRNA levels of all three genes were also high in day 1 HSC and declined coordinately in day 3 and 7 cells. In particular, the PPARγ level was severely depleted in day 7 HSC. Because the levels of all these adipogenic transcription factors decreased in activating or activated HSC, the expression of Kruppel-like factor 6 increased in day 3 and 7 cells (Fig. 2A), confirming the previously described differential expression of this zinc finger protein in activated HSC in vitro and in vivo (32Kim Y. Ratziu V. Choi S.G. Lalazar A. Theiss G. Dang Q. Kim S.J. Friedman S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33750-33758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Further, the level of PPARβ was also increased in day 3 and 7 HSC (Fig. 2A) as previously reported (33Hellemans K. Rombouts K. Quartier E. Dittie A.S. Knorr A. Michalik L. Rogiers V. Schuit F. Wahli W. Geerts A. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 280-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The reciprocal induction of PPARβ to the declined expression of adipogenic transcription factors is intriguing in light of its known stimulatory effects on fatty acid oxidation and energy dissipation (34Wang Y.X. Lee C.H. Tiep S. Yu R.T. Ham J. Kang H. Evans R.M.

In fact, quiescent HSC are loaded with lipids besides vitamin A (24Yamada M. Blaner W.S. Soprano D.R. Dixon J.L. Kjeldbye H.M. Goodman D.S. Hepatology. 1987; 7: 1224-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) as evident by Oil Red O staining, and activated day 7 cells are devoid of lipids (Fig. 2C). Further, a microarray analysis of RNA samples obtained from day 1 versus day 7 HSC consistently demonstrated higher levels of expression in day 1 HSC of adipocyte-specific genes that are under the positive control of PPARγ and SREBP-1 (Table II). Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis also confirmed the expression of adipocyte-specific genes such as adipsin and resistin in day 1 HSC as compared with day 7 cells (Fig. 2D).Table IIAdipogenic gene expression during HSC culture activationGenesmRNA ratio (HSC day 1/day 7)aThe mRNA ratio of each gene was calculated by dividing the mRNA level of day 1 HSC by that of day 7 HSC following standardization by a housekeeping gene (cyclophlin A)Target genes for PPARγ Acyl CoA oxidase3.44 Adipsin8.48 C/EBPβ2.54 C/EBPδ1.87 Glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase 1 Cytoplasmic2.77 Mitochondrial2.37 Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (mitochondrial)2.75 Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (Pck2-Rik, PEPCK-M) PPARγ1.96 Resistin4.24 Solute carrier family 27 (fatty acid transporter) member 43.39 Uncoupling protein 2 (mitochondrial)2.06Target genes for SREBP-1 Acetyl-CoA carboxylase Acac a2.48 Acac b3.03 Fatty acid synthase3.10 Fructose bisphosphatase 15.83 Glucose-6-phosphatase1.58 Glucokinase2.40 Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (mitochondrial)2.75 Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (Pck2-Rik, PEPCK-M) Pyruvate kinase 34.47 Pyruvate kinase (liver and red blood cells)2.39a The mRNA ratio of each gene was calculated by dividing the mRNA level of day 1 HSC by that of day 7 HSC following standardization by a housekeeping gene (cyclophlin A) Open table in a new tab PPARγ Transduction Induces Other Adipogenic Factors— Our previous study demonstrated that ectopic expression of PPARγ by an adenoviral vector caused a phenotypic reversal from activated to quiescent HSC (15Hazra S.

We wanted to examine next whether this reversal is associated with restoration of other adipogenic transcription factors whose expression are all reduced in activation. As shown in Fig. 3, the protein levels of nSREBP-1c and C/EBPβ and the mRNA levels of LXRα and C/EBPα were increased in PPARγ-transduced HSC as compared with GFP-transduced cells (control). These results demonstrate that adipogenic transcriptional regulation is restored by PPARγ transduction and confirm the known cross-regulatory induction among them (35Repa J.J. Liang G. Ou J.

Based on the overgrowth phenotype of the Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome patients and the key role played by the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling system in regulating embryonic growth, it was speculated that GPC3 regulates IGF signaling. In order to test the validity of this hypothesis, we mated GPC3 knockout mice with insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) nullizygous mice. We found that GPC3 regulates organism growth independent of IRS-1, suggesting that GPC3 does not modulate IGF signaling. Instead, we found that GPC3 knockout mice exhibit alterations in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is also associated with the regulation of cell proliferation. In particular, the loss of GPC3 led to the inhibition of the non-canonical Wnt/JNK signaling pathway, while concomitantly causing the activation of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling. These in vivo findings were confirmed in vitro upon the ectopic overexpression of GPC3 in mesothelioma cells. In these cells, the GPC3-induced increase in JNK activity was associated with an enhanced response to Wnt5a. Most interestingly, the heparan sulfate chains of GPC3 were not required for its stimulatory activity on Wnt5a signaling and for the formation of GPC3-Wnt5a complexes. We propose that at least in some cell types GPC3 serves as a selective regulator of Wnt signaling, by potentiating non-canonical Wnt signaling, while inhibiting the canonical Wnt signaling pathway.

Glypicans are cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans that are bound to the exoplasmic surface by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (1David G. Lories V. Decock B. Marynen P. Cassiman J.

All glypicans have similar structural domains, including a large, N-terminal globular cysteine-rich domain and a cluster of C-terminal heparan sulfate glycanation sites, near the point of membrane attachment (11Song H.H. Filmus J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Glypicans have been postulated to bind to numerous extracellular ligands through their heparan sulfate (HS) 1The abbreviations used are: HS, heparan sulfate; GPC3, glypican-3; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; IRS-1, insulin receptor substrate-1; HA, hemagglutinin A; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PKB, protein kinase B; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; PCP, planar cell polarity; Dsh, disheveled; CEA, carcinoembryonic antigen; TGFα, transforming growth factor-α. 1The abbreviations used are: HS, heparan sulfate; GPC3, glypican-3; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; IRS-1, insulin receptor substrate-1; HA, hemagglutinin A; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PKB, protein kinase B; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; PCP, planar cell polarity; Dsh, disheveled; CEA, carcinoembryonic antigen; TGFα, transforming growth factor-α. chains (13Bernfield M.

Given that the fine structure of HS chains can vary temporally and in a cell type-dependent manner (14Nakato H. Kimata K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), glypicans may regulate different signaling pathways depending on the cellular context. In Drosophila, glypicans have been shown to regulate Wnt, bone morphogenetic protein, and Hedgehog signaling and movement (15Jackson S.M. Nakato H. Sugiura M. Jannuzi A. Oakes R. Kaluza V. Golden C.

The involvement of glypicans in Wnt signaling has also been recently corroborated in Zebrafish and Xenopus. Specifically, glypicans appear necessary for cellular movements during gastrulation, which are known to be regulated by non-canonical Wnt signaling (21Topczewsky J. Sepich D.S. Myers D.C. Walker C.

Peers B. David G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism by which glypicans regulate Wnt activity is still under study, but there is experimental evidence to suggest that glypicans work at the level of signal reception by facilitating the interaction between Wnts and their signaling receptors Frizzleds (16Baeg G.H. Perrimon N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In addition, it has also been proposed that glypicans can regulate extracellular transport of Wnt, bone morphogenetic protein, and Hedgehog required for the formation of morphogen gradients (24Fujise M.

Cell. 2004; 7: 513-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Most surprisingly, in the case of glypican-3 (GPC3), it has been speculated that GPC3 may regulate insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling (28Pilia G. Hughes-Benzie R.M. MacKenzie A. Baybayan P. Chen E.Y. Huber R. Neri G. Cao A. Forabosco A. Schlessinger D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). This was largely based on the observation that loss-of-function mutations of GPC3 can lead to enhanced organism growth in utero. In particular, the loss of GPC3 has been causally associated with the Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome, a pediatric condition characterized by somatic overgrowth (28Pilia G. Hughes-Benzie R.M. MacKenzie A. Baybayan P. Chen E.Y. Huber R. Neri G. Cao A. Forabosco A. Schlessinger D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Similarly, mice nullizygous for GPC3 display significant embryonic overgrowth, compared with wild-type littermates (29Cano-Gauci D.F. Song H. Yang H. McKerlie C. Choo B. Shi W. Pullano R. Piscione T.D. Grisaru S. Soon S. Sedlackova L. Tanswell A.K. Mak T.W. Yeger H. Lockwood G.A. Rosenblum N. Filmus J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Given that the IGF signaling pathway is a critical determinant of organism size (30Baker J. Liu J.P. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1993; 75: 73-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2046) Google Scholar), it was proposed that GPC3 serves as a negative regulator of this pathway by competing for IGF binding with the IGF receptor (31Weksberg R. Squire J.A. Templeton D.M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 225-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This hypothesis, however, has been strongly challenged by other studies in mammalian systems, showing that GPC3 does not interact physically or genetically with the IGFs or their receptors (18Paine-Saunders S. Viviano B.L. Zupicich J. Skarnes W.C. Saunders S. Dev. Biol. 2000; 225: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 29Cano-Gauci D.F. Song H. Yang H. McKerlie C. Choo B. Shi W. Pullano R.

Biol. 2002; 243: 185-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Although the evidence to date suggests that GPC3 does not directly regulate IGF signal transduction at the level of ligand-receptor interactions, it still remains possible that GPC3 could stimulate a pathway that interacts with components of the IGF signaling system downstream of the receptors. In particular, the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), a key component of the IGF signaling pathway, can be activated by molecules that are not considered intrinsic components of such a signaling pathway (34Hotamisligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budavari A. Ellis R. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 271: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (2188) Google Scholar, 35Yenush L. White M.F. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Here we provide genetic and molecular data that demonstrate that GPC3 regulates organism size by a mechanism that is independent of IRS-1. Instead, we report that GPC3 regulates Wnt signaling by potentiating non-canonical Wnt signaling, both in vivo and in vitro, while concomitantly inhibiting canonical Wnt signaling. Mouse Strains, Genetic Crosses, and Tissue Collection—The generation of mice carrying targeted deletions in either GPC3 or IRS-1 was described previously (29Cano-Gauci D.F. Song H. Yang H. McKerlie C. Choo B. Shi W. Pullano R. Piscione T.D. Grisaru S. Soon S. Sedlackova L. Tanswell A.K. Mak T.W. Yeger H. Lockwood G.A. Rosenblum N. Filmus J. J.

Nature. 1994; 372: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). All mice were maintained in a C57Bl/6 background from at least the 5th backcross. To assess the effect of the lack of GPC3 on the body size of IRS-1-null mice, at least five newborn mice of each genotype were compared. For tissue collection, whole embryos were decapitated prior to snap-freezing on dry ice. All tissues were then stored at -80 °C until use. Newborn pups were collected prior to noon of the day of parturition and weighed. Unless otherwise indicated, at least two embryos with the same genotype were pooled for Western blot analysis or for the measurement of enzymatic activity. Experiments were performed at least twice, and a representative blot is shown. Expression Vectors—The pEF-BOSGPC3 and pEF-BOSΔGAG constructs were generated from a GPC3 cDNA, as described previously (37Duenas Gonzales A. Kaya M. Shi W. Song H. Testa J.R. Penn L.Z. Filmus J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1407-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The pGPC3IRES2EGFP and pΔGAGIRES2EGFP constructs were subsequently created by subcloning the EcoRI-AccI fragment containing the human GPC3 cDNA from pEFGPC3 and the EcoRI-SacII fragment containing the GPC3ΔGAG cDNA from pEFΔGAG into the EcoRI-AccI and EcoRI-SacII sites of pIRES2EGFP (Clontech), respectively. The placZIRES2EGFP plasmid was created by sub-cloning the galactosidase cDNA from pINDlacz (Invitrogen) into the EcoRI site of pIRES2EGFP. The pLNCXWnt5a(HA) plasmid containing an hemagglutinin A (HA)-tagged Wnt5a cDNA was a kind gift from Dr. J. Kitajewski. The pRC/CMVTGFα plasmid was generated by subcloning the HindIII-XbaI TGFα cDNA from pRC/CMVTGFα(as) (kindly provided by Dr. B. Ziober) into the HindIII site of pRC/CMV (Invitrogen) by using HindIII linkers. Cell Culture—II14 cells and II14 cells stably expressing rat GPC3 (37Duenas Gonzales A. Kaya M. Shi W. Song H. Testa J.R. Penn L.Z. Filmus J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1407-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% glutamine/penicillin/streptomycin, and hydrocortisone, insulin, holotransferrin, selenium (HITS), whereas 293T cells, L cells overexpressing Wnt3a and Wnt5a (ATCC), and Rat-2 cells overexpressing Wnt-1 (kind gift from Dr. M. Semënov) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% glutamine/penicillin/streptomycin. All cells were grown in a 37 °C incubator in the presence of 5% CO2. The pooled population of II14 cells stably expressing LacZ, GPC3, and ΔGAG were generated by transfecting II14 cells with placZIRES2EGFP, pGPC3IRES2EGFP, and pΔGAGIRES2EGFP respectively, using Lipofectin, as described previously (37Duenas Gonzales A. Kaya M. Shi W. Song H. Testa J.R. Penn L.Z. Filmus J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1407-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). After 3 weeks of selection with 600 μg/ml of geneticin (Invitrogen), colonies were pooled together and subjected to two rounds of fluorescence-activated cell sorting based on green fluorescent protein (GFP) fluorescence. Expression of GPC3 was confirmed by Western blotting with the 1G12 antibody (38Capurro M. Wanless I.R. Sherman M. Deboer G. Shi W. Miyoshi E. Filmus J. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 81-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Wnt-containing conditioned media from L and Rat-1 cells were collected from cultures grown to confluence, centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 10 min, snap-frozen on dry ice, and stored at -80 °C until use. To stimulate cells with Wnt-containing conditioned media, cells were incubated in serum-free media for 1 h prior to the addition of the media for up to 3 h at 37 °C. Stimulated cells were quickly washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed for β-catenin and phosphoprotein analyses, as described below. Analysis of Cytoplasmic β-Catenin Levels—E11.5 decapitated embryos were suspended in a hypotonic buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 1.5 mm MgCl, 10 mm KCl, 5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 25 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm okadaic acid, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 mm benzamidine hydrochloride) for 10 min. Embryos were then briefly centrifuged, resuspended in 800 μl of homogenizing buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 1.5 mm MgCl, 10 mm KCl, protease inhibitors) per embryo, and homogenized with 40 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. A fraction of the crude homogenate was quickly resuspended in an equal volume of 2× detergent lysis buffer (2% Triton X-100, 0.2% SDS, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors, phosphatase inhibitors) and incubated on ice for 30 min. Any insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected (total fraction) and protein concentration determined. The remainder of the crude homogenate was centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Cytoplasmic fractions were obtained by ultracentrifugation of the cleared homogenates at 28,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was then collected and protein concentration determined. In experiments with tissue culture cell lines, cytoplasmic extracts were obtained using saponin, as described previously (39Soriano S. Kang D.E. Fu M. Pestell R. Chevallier N. Zheng H. Koo E.H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 152: 785-794Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed on the dish with 250 μl of saponin lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes, 75 mm potassium acetate, 0.1% saponin, phosphatase inhibitors, and protease inhibitors). Cells were extracted twice, pooled, and then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble materials. The resulting supernatants were collected, and their protein concentration was determined. All samples were resuspended with an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, transferred, and then analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-β-catenin antibody (Signal Transduction Laboratories), followed by an anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (StressGen). Protein bands were detected using the ECL Reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Protein loading was determined by probing membranes with either an anti-actin (Sigma) or an anti-protein kinase B (PKB) antibody (Cell Signaling). Analysis of Phosphoproteins—Due to the limited amount of tissue available for analysis, embryonic extracts were made using the Trizol reagent, as per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, an E11.5 embryo was homogenized with 20 strokes of a tight-fitting pestle in 1 ml of Trizol (Invitrogen), and incubated on ice for 15 min. Following the addition of 200 μl of chloroform and the separation of the aqueous phase by centrifugation, the organic phase was extracted with 300 μl of ethanol and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Proteins were then precipitated from the supernatant with 3 volumes of pre-cooled acetone (-20 °C) and stored at -20 °C for 15 min. Following centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, the protein pellet was washed twice with an 80% ethanol/water mixture at room temperature for 10 min. Pellets were air-dried at room temperature and redissolved in a resuspension buffer (1% SDS, 1 mm dithiothreitol) prior to protein quantification. Protein extracts from tissue culture cell lines were obtained by lysing cells directly on dishes with 1× detergent lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 199 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, proteinase inhibitors, phosphatase inhibitors) for 30 min on ice. Crude lysates were collected by scraping and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min to remove insoluble material. The supernatants were then collected, and protein concentration was determined. All protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a membrane, and then subjected to Western blotting with either an anti-phospho-Jun kinase (JNK) antibody (Cell Signaling), an antibody against phospho-protein kinase C (PKC) (Cell Signaling), or an antibody directed against phospho-c-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protein bands were detected using a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (StressGen) and the ECL Reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Total JNK, total PKC, and c-Jun levels were determined by stripping and reprobing the membranes with anti-JNK (Cell Signaling), anti-pan-PKC (Cell Signaling), or anti-c-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies. Immunostaining—II14 cells were grown on coverslips for 2 days. Coverslips were then washed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS at room temperature. After rinsing the coverslips with PBS and permeabilizing the cells with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS plus 100 mm glycine for 15 min at room temperature, nonspecific sites were blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for an additional 15 min at room temperature. The actin cytoskeleton was then stained with phalloidin-rhodamine. For Disheveled (Dsh) staining, cells were fixed for 10 min at room temperature with a 1:1 methanol/acetone mixture. After extensive washings in PBS, nonspecific sites were blocked using a 5% normal rabbit serum solution in PBS. The coverslips were then incubated for 2 h with 4 μg/ml of a goat anti-Dsh antibody (C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by a 1-h incubation with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-goat antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Nuclei were counterstained with 300 nm 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 2 min prior to mounting with anti-fade (Dako). Analysis of Wnt Expression in II14 Cells—RNA was extracted using Trizol, and cDNA was generated using reverse transcriptase. For assessment of Wnt5a expression, the following primers were employed: 5′-CTTCCGCAAGGTGGGCGATGC-3′ and 5′-TTGCACAGGCGTCCCTGCGTG-3′. PCRs were completed in the presence of 150 nm MgCl and 200 nm dNTP using the following conditions: denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min; 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min; and elongation at 72 °C for 10 min. The expected size of the Wnt5a PCR product was 204 bp. Co-immunoprecipitation—1 million 293T cells were plated on 35-mm dishes. The next day cells were transfected with 2 μg of each of the indicated expression vectors using Lipofectamine 2000. 48 h following transfection, cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin. For immunoprecipitation studies, 500 μg of protein lysates were diluted to 1 μg/μl protein and pre-cleaned by incubating with protein G beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein complexes were immunoprecipitated from cleared lysates with either 2.5 μg/ml of anti-GPC3 1G12 antibody or 10 μg/ml of the anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) J22.4.4 antibody (kind gift from Dr. C. Stanners) overnight at 4 °C, followed by a 1-h incubation at 4 °C with protein G. Immune complexes were then collected and washed three times with lysis buffer, prior to resuspension in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Proteins from immunoprecipitated samples or 30 μg of crude cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a membrane, and subjected to Western blotting using antibodies against either GPC3 (1G12), HA (3F10, Roche Applied Science), CEA (J22.4.4), or transforming growth factor-α (TGFα) (Ab-1, Oncogene Research). All protein bands were detected using an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and chemiluminescence reagents. GPC3 Regulates Organism Size by a Mechanism That Is Independent of IRS-1—To determine whether GPC3 regulates embryonic growth through IRS-1, we first investigated whether the level of IRS-1 phosphorylation is altered in GPC3-null mice. Analysis of embryos at day 12.5 post-coitum, the earliest developmental stage at which overgrowth can be detected (29Cano-Gauci D.F. Song H. Yang H. McKerlie C. Choo B. Shi W. Pullano R. Piscione T.D. Grisaru S. Soon S. Sedlackova L. Tanswell A.K. Mak T.W. Yeger H. Lockwood G.A. Rosenblum N. Filmus J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), showed no change in IRS-1 phosphorylation in the mutant mice compared with wild-type littermates (Fig. 1A). As expected from the IRS-1 results, the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGF receptor-1 was not altered in the GPC3-null mice (Fig. 1A). As a complement to the molecular analyses of the GPC3 knockout mice, we also performed genetic studies in which GPC3 knockout mice were mated with IRS-1 knockout mice. We speculated that if GPC3 regulates organism size through the IGF signaling pathway, then mice deficient for both GPC3 and IRS-1 should exhibit less overgrowth than that observed in GPC3 knockout mice. By measuring newborn weights, however, we found that the loss of GPC3 results in similar overgrowth irrespective of IRS-1 levels, because GPC3-null mice displayed a 31% overgrowth over wild-type mice and a 38% overgrowth in an IRS-1-null background. Similar results were obtained when E12.5 embryos were weighed (data not shown). These results indicate that GPC3 regulates organism growth independent of IGF signaling through IRS-1. PKB and GSK-3 Activities Are Not Altered in GPC3-null Mice—Given that GPC3 appears to regulate organism size independent of IRS-1, we decided to investigate whether GPC3 acts through molecules that are further downstream of this signaling molecule, particularly along the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/PKB pathway. This signaling pathway has been implicated in organism growth regulation (40Yang Z.Z. Tschopp O. Hemmings-Mieszczak M. Feng J. Brodbeck D. Perentes E. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2203-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). In order to assess the degree of activation of this pathway in GPC3 knockout mice, we first determined the levels of PKB phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 1B, GPC3 knockout mice do not appear to exhibit altered levels of PKB phosphorylation relative to wild-type littermates. An alternative method for assessing the activity of PKB is to determine the levels of GSK-3 phosphorylation, one of the known targets of PKB (43Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (4337) Google Scholar). Similar to what it was found with PKB, the GPC3-null mice did not display any obvious changes in the levels of GSK-3 phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). This result was confirmed by direct measurement of GSK-3 activity, which was similar in both the GPC3 knockouts and the normal littermates (data not shown). GPC3 Knockout Mice Exhibit Alterations in Wnt Signaling— Cyclin D1 is a critical component of the cell cycle machinery necessary for the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase. Consequently, mice deficient for cyclin D1 are smaller than their wild-type littermates (44Fantl V. Stamp G. Andrews A. Rosewell I. Dickson C. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2364-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). We therefore speculated that GPC3 knockout mice could express higher levels of cyclin D1. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 1C, the levels of cyclin D1 in the GPC3 knockout mice are about 50% higher than those of wild-type littermates. Given that this increase in cyclin D1 levels is not associated with alterations in either PKB or GSK-3 activities, and in light of the experimental evidence indicating that glypicans can regulate Wnt signaling (16Baeg G.H.

In MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cultures, dexamethasone (DEX) activates glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) and inhibits a differentiation-related cell cycle that occurs at a commitment stage immediately after confluence. Here we show that DEX inhibition of the differentiation-related cell cycle is associated with a decrease in β-catenin levels and inhibition of LEF/TCF-mediated transcription. These inhibitory activities are no longer observed in the presence of lithium, a GSK3β inhibitor. DEX decreased the serum-responsive phosphorylation of protein kinase B/Akt-Ser473 within minutes, and this inhibition was also observed after 12 h. When the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway was inhibited by wortmannin, DEX no longer inhibited β-catenin levels. Furthermore, DEX-mediated inhibition of LEF/TCF transcriptional activity was attenuated in the presence of dominant negative forms of either PI3K or protein kinase B/Akt. These results suggest cross-talk between the PI3K/Akt and Wnt signaling pathways. Consistent with a role for Wnt signaling in the osteoblast differentiation-related cell cycle, wortmannin partially negated the DEX inhibition of this cell cycle. DEX also induced histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1, which is known to inhibit LEF/TCF transcriptional activity. Overexpression of HDAC1 negated the inhibitory effect of DEX on LEF/TCF transcriptional activity. In the presence of trichostatin A, a deacetylase inhibitor, DEX-mediated inhibition of the differentiation-related cell cycle was partially negated. When administered together, wortmannin and trichostatin A completely negated the inhibitory effect of DEX on the differentiation-related cell cycle. These results suggest that inhibition of a PI3K/Akt/GSK3β/β-catenin/LEF axis and stimulation of HDAC1 cooperate to mediate the inhibitory effect of DEX on Wnt signaling and the osteoblast differentiation-related cell cycle.

In addition, GCs are used in combination with other drugs to reduce inflammation associated with hematologic and other cancers and to prevent implant rejection. A major side effect of GC treatment is rapid bone loss and increased risk of fracture (1Van Staa T.P. Leufkens H.G. Abenhaim L. Zhang B. Cooper C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). Although bone resorption has been suggested to contribute to GC-induced osteoporosis (2Lukert B. Markus R. Feldman D. Kelsey J. Osteoporosis. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1997: 801-820Google Scholar), it is now clear that the main mechanism underlying long-term GC-induced bone loss is the impairment of osteoblast function and bone formation (3Canalis E. Bilezikian J.P. Angeli A. Giustina A. Bone. 2004; 34: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 4Rubin M.R. Bilezikian J.P. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

One of the most effective culture systems for the investigation of inhibitory effects of GCs on osteoblasts is the MC3T3-E1 model. In fact, this is the only reported culture system in which GCs strongly inhibit mineralization (6Lian J.B. Shalhoub V. Aslam F. Frenkel B. Green J. Hamrah M. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2117-2127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Smith E. Redman R.A. Logg C.R. Coetzee G.A. Kasahara N. Frenkel B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19992-20001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We have refined a commitment stage during osteoblast differentiation in MC3T3-E1 cultures, during which the cells are susceptible to GC inhibition (8Leclerc N. Luppen C.A. Ho V.V. Nagpal S. Hacia J.G. Smith E. Frenkel B. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 33: 175-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). At the commitment stage, unique cell cycle machinery is activated. Unlike cell cycle progression in preconfluent cultures, the differentiation-related cell cycle is inhibited by GCs, concomitant with the abandonment of the differentiation program (7Smith E. Redman R.A. Logg C.R. Coetzee G.A. Kasahara N. Frenkel B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19992-20001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In our pursuit of mechanisms driving the differentiation-related post-confluent cell cycle, we concentrated on the Wnt signaling pathway. The second messenger engaged by the Wnt signaling pathway to activate cell cycle-regulatory genes such as c-myc (9He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1509-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (4084) Google Scholar) is β-catenin, which also plays a role in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions (10Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar, 11Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. Cell Regul. 1989; 1: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Wnt signaling may therefore link cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions occurring in postconfluent cultures and the cell cycle. Importantly, Wnt proteins have been shown to promote post-confluent proliferation in cultured cells (12Young C.S. Kitamura M. Hardy S. Kitajewski J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2474-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the Wnt signaling pathway plays a critical role in the osteoblast differentiation-related cell cycle and in the aforementioned inhibitory effects of GCs (13Smith E. Coetzee G.A. Frenkel B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18191-18197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A key negative regulator in the Wnt signaling pathway is the serine/threonine kinase GSK3β, which phosphorylates and promotes the degradation of β-catenin in quiescent cells. The tumor suppressors APC and axin form complexes with GSK3β and β-catenin, thus promoting the activity of GSK3β on β-catenin (14Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A.

Science. 1996; 272: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). In addition to the phosphorylation of β-catenin, GSK3β may also impede cell cycle progression by phosphorylating and marking for degradation substrates outside the Wnt signaling pathway, including the proto-oncogenes c-Myc and cyclin D1 (18Sears R. Nuckolls F. Haura E. Taya Y. Tamai K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2501-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 19Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar). These substrates must first undergo priming by another kinase in order to correctly associate with GSK3β (20Doble B.W. Woodgett J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar). Stimulation of the cell cycle with growth factors that activate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway results in phosphorylation of GSK3β on Ser9 (21Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Vandenheede J.R. McDowell H.E. Hundal H.S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 22Saito Y. Vandenheede J.R. Cohen P. Biochem.

Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar). [pSer9]GSK3β is unable to correctly associate with substrates that had been phosphorylated by the priming kinase and is thus inactive with respect to these substrates (24Dajani R. Fraser E. Roe S.M. Young N. Good V. Dale T.C. Pearl L.H. Cell. 2001; 105: 721-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that, similar to substrates outside the Wnt signaling pathway, β-catenin also undergoes priming before it is phosphorylated by GSK3β (25Liu C. Li Y. Semenov M. Han C. Baeg G.H. Tan Y. Zhang Z. Lin X. He X. Cell. 2002; 108: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar). The inhibition of the differentiation-related cell cycle in GC-treated MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cultures is associated with activation of GSK3β, inhibition of its Ser9 phosphorylation, and accelerated degradation of c-Myc (13Smith E. Coetzee G.A. Frenkel B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18191-18197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Furthermore, administration of lithium, a specific inhibitor of GSK3β, to GC-treated MC3T3-E1 cultures rescued c-Myc and the differentiation-related cell cycle (13Smith E. Coetzee G.A. Frenkel B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18191-18197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Here we show that the GC-mediated activation of GSK3β also results in inhibition of the Wnt signaling pathway and LEF/TCF transcriptional activity. We demonstrate that GCs inhibit phosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt on Ser473 and thus disrupt input from the PI3K/Akt pathway into the Wnt signaling pathway at the level of GSK3β. Cell Culture—Three culture models were employed in this study. A highly osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 subclone was isolated previously (7Smith E. Redman R.A. Logg C.R. Coetzee G.A. Kasahara N. Frenkel B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19992-20001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and used between passage 7 and 11. The results did not depend on the passage number within this range. Newborn mouse calvarial osteoblast (NeMCO) cultures were prepared from 6-day-old mice by successive collagenase digestion (26Kato M. Patel M.S. Levasseur R. Lobov I. Chang B.H. Glass II, D.A.

Human osteoblast cultures were obtained previously from vertebrae of subjects undergoing neurosurgical procedures (27Linkhart T.A. Linkhart S.G. MacCharles D.C. Long D.L. Strong D.D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1991; 6: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and frozen cell stocks were thawed for the present study. All cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Omega, Tarzana, CA). At confluence, 50 μm ascorbic acid and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate were added to promote differentiation (7Smith E. Redman R.A. Logg C.R. Coetzee G.A. Kasahara N. Frenkel B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19992-20001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Dexamethasone (DEX; 1 μm), wortmannin (230 nm), and trichostatin A (TSA; 50 nm) were administered with the last medium change. Transfection and Luciferase Assays—Cells were plated in 6-well plates (80,000 cells/well) and transiently transfected with a total of 5 μg of plasmid DNA using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method of Chen and Okayama (28Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested 20–48 h after feeding and lysed in “reporter lysis buffer” (Promega). Luciferase activity was determined using a microtiter plate luminometer (MLX Dynex Technologies), and effects of DEX were tested for statistical significance using Student's t test. Protein Extracts—Proteins were extracted using the following procedures. High salt extraction was performed according to the method of Ito et al. (29Ito K. Barnes P.J. Adcock I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6891-6903Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were suspended in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 0.25 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm NaF, and 0.1 mm Na3VO4. Suspensions were homogenized and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 1 h to remove cell debris, and the supernatant was used for Western analysis. Triton extraction was performed according to the method of Su et al. (30Su F. Overholtzer M. Besser D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Cells were suspended in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 mm EDTA, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors as described above. Suspensions were homogenized, and extracts were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min to remove cell debris. Nuclear extracts were prepared essentially according to Verona et al. (31Verona R. Moberg K. Estes S. Starz M. Vernon J.P. Lees J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7268-7282Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Cell pellets were suspended in two packed cell volumes of hypotonic buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), and protease and phosphatase inhibitors as described above. Cells were left to swell on ice for 10 min and then vortexed for 10 s and spun at 500 × g for 5 min. The nuclear pellet was washed twice with hypotonic buffer and lysed in two nuclear pellet volumes of lysis buffer containing 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.5 m KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 28% glycerol, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors as described above. The nuclear suspension was homogenized and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 1 h to remove cell debris. Protein concentrations were determined using the micro BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Western Analysis—Protein (60–100 μg) was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membrane using a Mini Trans-Blot Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad). Immunodetection was performed using ECL (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's recommendations, followed by exposure of the membrane to x-ray film. Results were quantitated by photodensitometry using an AlphaImager 2000 system (Alpha Innotech Corp.). For each experiment, the control value was set at 1 to calculate the relative signal in DEX-treated cells. Effects of DEX were tested for statistical significance using the Mann-Whitney test. Flow Cytometry—Cell cycle analysis was performed according to the method of Darzynkiewicz et al. (32Darzynkiewicz Z. Li X. Gong J. Darzynkiewicz Z. Robinson J.P. Crissman H.A. Flow Cytometry. 41. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 15-38Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lightly trypsinized, resuspended in Hanks' buffer, fixed in cold 70% ethanol, washed with Hanks' buffer, and suspended in 1 ml of Hanks' buffer containing 20 μg/ml propidium iodide and 5 Kunitz units of DNase-free RNase A. Cell cycle profiles were determined using an EPICS® Profile Analyzer, and effects of DEX were tested for statistical significance using Student's t test. Reagents—Tissue culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. DEX, wortmannin, and trichostatin A were from Sigma. Anti-β-catenin antibodies (C19220) were from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-Akt antibodies (catalog no. 9272) and anti-[pSer473]Akt (catalog no. 4051) were from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-HDAC1 antibodies (sc-8410) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The following constructs were used in transient transfection assays: LEF/TCF reporter constructs (9He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B.

GCs Inhibit LEF/TCF-mediated Transcription via GSK3β— We have shown previously that GC-mediated inhibition of the osteoblast differentiation-related cell cycle occurs via activation of GSK3β and proteasomal degradation of c-myc (13Smith E. Coetzee G.A. Frenkel B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18191-18197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Because GSK3β is also a negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway, we decided to test whether GCs inhibit LEF/TCF-mediated activity, the transcriptional outcome of the Wnt signaling pathway. MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts were transfected with TBE4-luc, which contains four LEF/TCF binding sites that control transcription of a luciferase reporter gene (9He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1509-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (4084) Google Scholar). Post-confluent proliferating cells undergoing commitment were treated with DEX and subjected to luciferase assay. As shown in Fig. 1A, DEX inhibited LEF/TCF-mediated transcription by 2-fold, whereas TBEm4-luc, which contains four mutated LEF/TCF sites, was not inhibited (Fig. 1C). Unlike cultures undergoing commitment, administration of DEX to pre-confluent proliferating MC3T3-E1 cells did not inhibit LEF/TCF-mediated transcription (Fig. 1B). It has been shown that GSK3β facilitates the transcriptional activity of p65-NFκB (35Hoeflich K.P. Luo J. Rubie E.A. Tsao M.S. Jin O. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 2000; 406: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). If DEX inhibition of LEF/TCF-mediated activity were a result of GSK3β activation, one would expect that under the same conditions DEX would increase the transcriptional activity of p65-NFκB. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 1E, DEX stimulated p65-NFκB-responsive luciferase activity by 2.4-fold, whereas no significant effect was observed in preconfluent cultures (Fig. 1F). To confirm the role of GSK3β in the DEX-mediated inhibition of LEF/TCF in differentiating osteoblasts, MC3T3-E1 cells transfected with TBE4-luc were treated with DEX in the presence of lithium, a specific inhibitor of GSK3β. Indeed, in seven independent experiments, one of which is shown in Fig. 1G, the inhibition of LEF/TCF transcription by DEX was reduced by an average of 5-fold in the presence of lithium as compared with potassium, which was used as control. These results suggest that GSK3β mediates the inhibition of LEF/TCF transcriptional activity in GC-treated differentiating osteoblasts. GCs Inhibit PKB/Akt Phosphorylation in Differentiating Osteoblasts—We have shown previously that GC activation of GSK3β is associated with a decrease in the inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3β-Ser9 (13Smith E. Coetzee G.A. Frenkel B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18191-18197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The primary enzyme that phosphorylates GSK3β on Ser9 is PKB/Akt, which is stimulated in response to serum and PI3K activation (23Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar, 36Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar, 37Stokoe D.

Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of PKB/Akt on serine 473 is a hallmark of enzyme activation (39Scheid M.P. Marignani P.A. Woodgett J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6247-6260Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). We therefore measured Akt-Ser473 phosphorylation in DEX-inhibited osteoblast cultures. In MC3T3-E1 cells, the only reported osteoblast culture system in which GCs inhibit terminal differentiation, DEX decreased the phosphorylation of Akt on Ser473 by 2.3-fold (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, serum stimulation of Akt Ser473 phosphorylation was attenuated within minutes of DEX treatment (Fig. 2B). DEX also decreased Akt Ser473 phosphorylation in newborn mouse calvarial osteoblast (NeMCO) and human osteoblast cultures (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that in differentiating osteoblasts, the target of GCs upstream of GSK3β is the PI3K/Akt pathway. GC Inhibition of LEF/TCF Transcriptional Activity Is Mediated through PKB/Akt—Taken together, the results described above led us to test whether the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway contributes to the observed decrease in LEF/TCF transcriptional activity in GC-treated osteoblast cultures. Cells were transfected with TBE4-luc, along with expression plasmids encoding dominant negative forms of either PKB/Akt or PI3K. As shown in Fig. 2C, the DEX-mediated inhibition of LEF/TCF transcriptional activity in the differentiating osteoblasts was reduced from 3.6-fold to 2.4-fold when a dominant negative PKB/Akt was present. In the presence of dominant negative PI3K, the inhibitory factor was reduced to 1.9-fold (Fig. 2C, top panel). Specificity to LEF/TCF transcriptional activity is indicated by the results obtained in cells transfected with the TBEm4-luc reporter (Fig. 2C, bottom panel). Thus, inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway compromises, albeit partially, the inhibitory effect of DEX on LEF/TCF, indicating that the PI3K/Akt pathway mediates in part the inhibitory effect of DEX on LEF/TCF transcriptional activity. The PI3K/Akt Pathway Mediates DEX-induced Decrease in β-Catenin—The observation that DEX inhibition of LEF/TCF transcriptional activity is counteracted by lithium (Fig. 1G) suggests that DEX may have abrogated Wnt signaling through activation of GSK3β. To confirm this interpretation, we measured the effect of DEX on β-catenin levels in post-confluent MC3T3-E1 proliferating cultures. As shown in the left panels of Fig. 3, A and B, β-catenin levels were indeed reduced in response to DEX. Furthermore, β-catenin levels were not decreased by DEX in the presence of lithium (Fig. 3A, right panel), indicating that GCs indeed reduce β catenin via GSK3β activation. The destructive activity of GSK3β on β-catenin is thought to be primarily regulated by Wnt ligands and disheveled, which destabilize the β-catenin destruction complex (14Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar, 15de los Hart M.J. Santos R. Albert I.N. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Curr.

Science. 1996; 272: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). Here, we propose that the action of PKB/Akt on GSK3β-Ser9 also contributes to the regulation of β-catenin levels and would therefore mediate the inhibitory effect of GCs on the Wnt signaling pathway. To examine the interaction between the PI3K/Akt and Wnt signaling pathways, we tested whether DEX could still inhibit β-catenin levels in the presence of wortmannin, an inhibitor of the PI3K/Akt pathway. DEX no longer reduced β-catenin levels in the presence of wortamnnin, whereas inhibition was preserved in the presence of Me2SO used as vehicle (Fig. 3B, DMSO). These results demonstrate cross-talk between the PI3K/Akt and the Wnt signaling pathways, placing GSK3β at an intersection through which extracellular signals upstream of PI3K/Akt would cooperate with Wnt signaling. In differentiating osteoblasts, this intersection is blocked by GCs (see Fig. 7). DEX Targets the Wnt Signaling Pathway in Primary Osteoblast Cultures—Although the MC3T3-E1 cell culture model is ideal for the investigation of adverse effects of GCs in osteoblasts, we also tested whether DEX reduces β-catenin levels in NeMCO cultures under conditions established by Noh and Frenkel. 2T. Noh and B. Frenkel, manuscript in preparation. DEX decreased β-catenin levels in NeMCO cultures (Fig. 3C) and in differentiating bone marrow-derived human mesenchymal stem cell cultures (data not shown) in a manner comparable with that seen in the MC3T3-E1 model (Fig. 3, A and B). Furthermore, GSK3β mediated DEX attenuation of cell cycle progression in NeMCO cultures: after 9 h of treatment, the percentage of S-phase cells was insignificantly reduced by only 10%, followed by a 27% inhibition at the 15 h time point and a 7-fold inhibition after 5 days of treatment (Fig. 3D). When the NeMCO cultures were co-treated with lithium, a GSK3β inhibitor, DEX no longer attenuated cell cycle progression (Fig. 3D). Thus, the Wnt signaling pathway is intercepted by DEX in both MC3T3-E1 and NeMCO cultures. Histone Deacetylase I Contributes to GC Inhibition of LEF/TCF Transcriptional Activity—Although our data suggest that GCs inhibit LEF/TCF transcriptional activity through a PI3K/Akt/GSK3β/β-catenin axis, an additional mechanism of GC action is suggested by the fact that DEX still has some inhibitory activity on LEF/TCF in cells treated with lithium (Fig. 1G) or transfected with dominant negative forms of PI3K or PKB/Akt (Fig. 2C). Such a mechanism could involve acetylases and deacetylases, which directly activate and inactivate LEF/TCF transcriptional activity, respectively (40Takemaru K.I. Moon R.T. J.

Initially, we tested the effect of the acetyltransferase CBP on DEX-mediated repression of LEF/TCF transcriptional activity. As shown in Fig. 4A, co-transfection of CBP did not influence the DEX-mediated repression of TBE4-luc. We also tested whether the DEX-mediated repression would be compromised when endogenous CBP is unable to co-activate LEF/TCF. To this end, cells were co-transfected with TBE4-luc along with p53, which has been shown to sequester CBP from interaction with LEF/TCF transcription factors (46Miyagishi M. Fujii R. Hatta M.

In contrast, specifically reducing IRS-2 expression in INS-1 cells, using adenoviral-mediated expression of IRS-2 antisense, causes spontaneous apoptosis and decreased β-cell survival (9Lingohr M.K.

Likewise, IRS-2-/- mice have a marked decreased β-cell mass and consequently become diabetic (4Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.M. Previs S. Zhang Y. Bernal D. Pons S.

Thus, both in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that regulation of IRS-2 expression levels in β-cells is critical for control of β-cell mass (10Dickson L.M. Rhodes C.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: E192-E198Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Regulation of β-cell mass has important implications for the pathogenesis of obesity-linked type 2 diabetes (1Lingohr M.K. Buettner R. Rhodes C.J. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 375-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Obesity is linked to an increase in peripheral insulin resistance, but this can be compensated by an increase in β-cell function and mass so that the onset of type 2 diabetes is avoided (10Dickson L.M. Rhodes C.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: E192-E198Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, with time and/or increased insulin resistance, β-cell mass eventually becomes insufficient to cope with the increased insulin demand and type 2 diabetes ensues (1Lingohr M.K. Buettner R.

In skeletal muscle, FFA-induced inhibition of insulin-mediated PI3K/PKB activation has been suggested to be via FFA-induced activation of novel PKC isoforms that increase Ser/Thr phosphorylation of IRS-1 that, in turn, has a negative effect of dampening downstream IRS-1 signal transduction (24Griffin M.E. Marcucci M.J. Cline G.W. Bell K. Barucci N. Lee D. Goodyear L.J. Kraegen E.W. White M.F. Shulman G.I. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1270-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar, 25Ikeda Y. Olsen G.S.

This is thought to make a significant contribution to the mechanism of insulin resistance. In β-cells, FFA also activate novel PKC isoforms that could increase the IRS-2 Ser/Thr phosphorylation status (22Wrede C.E. Dickson L.M. Lingohr M.K. Briaud I. Rhodes C.J. J. Biol.

However, it has been shown that other protein kinases, not just certain PKC isoforms, are capable of Ser/Thr phosphorylating IRS proteins, including mTOR (26Zick Y.

However, it is possible that prolonged activation of mTOR by chronically elevated glucose concentrations could be detrimental to IRS-mediated signaling in β-cells. It has been described in insulin target tissues that chronically activated mTOR increased the Ser/Thr phosphorylation state of IRS-1 and IRS-2 (27Pederson T.M. Kramer D.L. Rondinone C.M. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 28Haruta T. Uno T. Kawahara J. Takano A. Egawa K. Sharma P.M. Olefsky J.M. Kobayashi M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 783-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). This increased Ser/Thr phosphorylation of IRS-1 or IRS-2 via mTOR subsequently leads to increased degradation of IRS-1/2 proteins and a consequential down-regulation of insulin signaling transduction pathways, which also contributes to insulin resistance in peripheral tissues (27Pederson T.M. Kramer D.L. Rondinone C.M. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 28Haruta T. Uno T. Kawahara J. Takano A. Egawa K. Sharma P.M. Olefsky J.M. Kobayashi M. Mol.

If chronic activation of mTOR leads to Ser/Thr phosphorylation of IRS-2 in β-cells, then this would decrease IRS-2 protein levels and be detrimental for β-cell survival. Indeed, in this present study we present experimental evidence to indicate that this might well be the case, and in turn may be a contributing mechanism as to how chronic hyperglycemia eventually leads to a decrease in β-cell mass in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.

Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). In general, INS-1 cells were subcultured on 6-well plates to ∼80% confluence and then incubated 16 h at 37 °C in serum-free modified RPMI 1640 medium containing 3 mm glucose and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin as described (7Lingohr M.K.

After the quiescent period the cells were incubated at 37 °C with fresh serum-free RPMI 1640 medium with 3 or 15 mm glucose ± 5 nm IGF-1 ± inhibitors for 8 or 24 h as indicated. Adenovirus Infection—All mTOR constructs have an NH2-terminal AU1 epitope tag. The “kinase-dead” mTOR KD variant contains an Asp2338 to Ala mutation that renders it catalytically inactive (39Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L.

The intrinsic kinase activity of mTORΔ is ∼5-fold higher than that of wild type mTOR when assayed in vitro (43McMahon L.P. Choi K.M. Lin T.A. Abraham R.T. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Mol. Cell.

Adenoviruses expressing wild type (AdV-mTOR-WT), constitutively activated (AdV-mTORΔ), and kinase-dead mTOR (AdV-mTOR-KD) were generated, amplified, and purified as previously described (7Lingohr M.K.

Adenovirus expressing GFP (AdV-GFP) and luciferase (AdV-Luc) were used as control viruses.

Immunoblot Analysis—Cell lysates were prepared as previously described first and assayed for total protein levels as determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Equivalent protein sample aliquots were then subjected to immunoblot analysis as previously described (7Lingohr M.K. Dickson L.M. McCuaig J.F. Hugl S.R. Twardzik D.R. Rhodes C.J.

For alkaline phosphatase treatment, INS-1 cells were lysed in phosphatase inhibitor-free lysis buffer. These lysates were then treated with 1.725 DEA units/100 μl of alkaline phosphatase attached to agarose beads with shaking at 37 °C for 1 h. The alkaline phosphatase was removed by microcentrifugation prior to the immunoblot analysis. Immunofluorescence—AdV-infected INS-1 cells were subcultured on glass coverslips within 6-well plates to 60-70% confluence, and after incubation were washed with ice-cold PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, washed with 0.1% Triton/PBS, and then re-washed with PBS. Fixed cells were first incubated for 1 h with 5% donkey serum in 5% bovine serum albumin/PBS prior to incubation with primary antibody against activated caspase-9 overnight at a 1:100 dilution in 5% bovine serum albumin/PBS at 4 °C. The cells were then washed 3 times with PBS and incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:500 in 5% bovine serum albumin/PBS) (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 25 °C. The cells were then washed 3 times in PBS and mounted onto glass slides with mounting media (Molecular Probes). Activated caspase-9 was visualized using an Olympus FV500 confocal microscope. Expression of Data and Statistics—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistically significant differences between groups were analyzed using Student's t test, where p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Chronic Exposure to Glucose and/or IGF-1 Induces Ser/Thr Phosphorylation of IRS-2 in Pancreatic β-Cells—Quiescent INS-1 cells were incubated for 8 h in the presence of basal 3 mm glucose or stimulatory 15 mm glucose ± 5 nm IGF-1. Immunoblot analysis of IRS-2 indicated different stages of a decreased electrophoretic mobility of IRS-2 protein on a 7% polyacrylamide gel analysis (Fig. 1A). A stimulatory 15 mm glucose induced an upward mobility shift in IRS-2 protein migration compared with that at basal 3 mm glucose (Fig. 1A). IGF-1 added at 3 mm basal glucose also induced a slight upward shift in IRS-2 migration, which was further increased when IGF-1 was added together with a stimulatory 15 mm glucose concentration (Fig. 1A). IRS-2 immunoblot analysis by the 10% polyacrylamide gel was used to more tightly resolve IRS-2 electrophoretic migration and better evaluate total IRS-2 protein levels. Intriguingly, IRS-2 protein levels were increased 2-3-fold at 15 mm glucose compared with basal 3 mm glucose (Fig. 1A). The addition of IGF-1 at basal 3 mm glucose had no effect on IRS-2 protein levels, and addition of IGF-1 at a stimulatory 15 mm glucose tended to reduce IRS-2 protein levels compared with that at 15 mm glucose alone (Fig. 1A). Immunoblot analysis of the p85 subunit of PI3K was used as a loading control and its protein expression levels were unchanged under all conditions emphasizing the specific effect on IRS-2 (Fig. 1A). The time course of this glucose-induced IRS-2 gel mobility shift was examined. Quiescent INS-1 cells were incubated in the presence of basal 3 mm or stimulatory 15 mm glucose for 1, 4, 8, and 24 h. There was little change in IRS-2 electrophoretic mobility at basal 3 mm glucose during early time points, although IRS-2 protein levels were decreased by ∼50% at 24 h compared with that at the preceding 8-h time point (Fig. 1B). At 15 mm glucose there was an increased IRS-2 gel mobility shift apparent by 4 h and remained up to 24 h (Fig. 1B). Stimulatory 15 mm glucose increased IRS-2 protein levels, which reached a maximum 2-3-fold increase at 8 h (Fig. 1B). IRS-2 expression levels"

The level of fatty acids has to be tightly controlled in the adipocyte, as they can act as detergents that rapidly dissolve the plasma membrane, causing cell lysis if allowed to accumulate. Fatty acids therefore have to be efficiently converted to TG and stored in the central lipid droplet. We report that in intact primary adipocytes exogenous oleic acid was taken up and directly converted to TG in the plasma membrane, in a novel subclass of caveolae that specifically contains the protein perilipin. Isolated caveolae catalyzed de novo TG synthesis from oleic acid and glycerol 3-phosphate. Electron microscopy revealed the presence of caveolin and perilipin in caveolae and in lipid-laden bulbs in the plasma membrane, and fluorescence microscopy demonstrated colocalization of fatty acids/TG with caveolin and perilipin at the plasma membrane. A second caveolae fraction was isolated, which lacked perilipin and the triacylglycerol synthesizing enzymes. Both caveolae fractions contained caveolin-1 and the insulin receptor. The findings demonstrate that specific subclasses of caveolae carry out specific functions in cell metabolism.

To gain knowledge of the biochemical pathways of fat metabolism in human physiology is central to understanding the derangements and pathology in the adipocyte handling of fatty acids associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes. The adipocyte stores large amounts of triacylglycerol (TG), 1The abbreviations used are: TG, triacylglycerol; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: TG, triacylglycerol; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. which continually turn over during lipolytic hydrolysis and reacylation of exogenous fatty acids. Human adipocytes do not have the capacity to synthesize significant amounts of fatty acids de novo (1Goldrick R.B. J. Lipid Res. 1967; 8: 581-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The large part of triacylglycerol synthesis comes from fatty acids provided by lipoprotein lipase hydrolysis of chylomicron or very low density lipoprotein TG in the capillary blood vessels. Fatty acids act as detergents that rapidly dissolve the plasma membrane, causing cell lysis if allowed to accumulate (2Strålfors P. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 153-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The flow of fatty acids into the adipocyte can be high and these fatty acids have to be efficiently and rapidly converted to TG and stored away in the central lipid droplet. Several fatty acid-binding proteins that may mediate transfer of fatty acids have been identified (3Czech M.P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 695-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Caveolae invaginations of the plasma membrane are typically 50-100 nm in diameter and are very abundant in adipocytes (4Thorn H. Stenkula K.G. Karlsson M. Örtegren U. Nystrom F.H. Gustavsson J.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4179-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and the major structural protein of caveolae, caveolin, and the caveolae-localized protein, CD36, both bind fatty acids (13Trigatti B.L.

Caveolae membranes are rich in cholesterol and sphingomyelin and are much more resistant to solubilization by detergents than are other parts of the plasma membrane and other cellular membranes. The adipocyte plasma membrane is covered by caveolae invaginations that enlarge the membrane area by 50% and potentially provide relatively detergent-resistant ports for fatty acid entry and exit (4Thorn H.

Caveolin-1-/- mice that are deficient in caveolin, and caveolae have, moreover, been found to have deranged lipid metabolism and atrophied adipose tissue (19Cohen A.W. Razani B. Wang X.B. Combs T.P.

We now report that in primary adipocytes exogenous fatty acids are taken up and directly converted to triacylglycerol at the plasma membrane in a novel subclass of caveolae. Isolation and Incubation of Adipocytes—Adipocytes were isolated by collagenase digestion from Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (130-160 g, B&K Universal, Sollentuna, Sweden) as described (21Strålfors P. Honnor R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Cells were preincubated with 5 nm insulin for 10 min. [3H]Oleic acid (Amersham Biosciences) or the fluorescent fatty acid analogue C1-BODIPY 500/510 dodecanoic acid (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 100 μm was added for 40 or 120 s. Incubations were terminated with 2 mm KCN. Cells incubated with [3H]oleic acid were homogenized and caveolae isolated from purified plasma membranes (22Örtegren U. Karlsson M. Blazic N. Blomqvist M. Nystrom F.H. Gustavsson J. Fredman P. Strålfors P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2028-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Isolation of Caveolae—To prepare caveolae fractions without detergent adipocytes were homogenized, and plasma membranes were isolated and disrupted by sonication in 0.5 m Na2CO3, pH 11 (22Örtegren U. Karlsson M. Blazic N. Blomqvist M. Nystrom F.H. Gustavsson J. Fredman P. Strålfors P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2028-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This was then adjusted to 45% sucrose in 15 mm Mes, pH 6.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.3 m Na2CO3, with protease inhibitors, loaded under a continuous 10-40% sucrose density gradient, and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 18 h. Fractions of 1 ml were collected from the bottom of the tube and membranes pelleted by centrifugation. Caveolae purity has been documented (22Örtegren U. Karlsson M. Blazic N. Blomqvist M.

Fredman P. Strålfors P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2028-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). For analysis of TG synthesis in isolated membrane fractions, as indicated, isolated caveolae, plasma membranes, or microsomal membrane fractions were transferred to 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 100 μm [3H]oleic acid or 100 μm [14C]glycerol 3-phosphate (Amersham Biosciences) with 200 μm CoA, 5 mm ATP were added. The mixtures were briefly sonicated with a probe-type sonifier and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Incubations were terminated by membrane pelleting and lipid extraction. Lipid Analyses—Membrane fractions were extracted with CHCl3/CH3OH/150 mm NaCl (1:1:0.9). The CHCl3 phase was applied to thin-layer chromatography (high performance TLC, silicic acid, 10 × 10 cm, Merck). For neutral lipids the plate was developed in CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (65:35:2.5, by volume) for 2 cm and, after drying, in hexane/diethylether/CH3COOH (70:30:1, by volume) to the top of the plate (24Gustavsson J. Parpal S. Strålfors P. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Polar lipids were developed in CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (65:25:4, by volume) (25Kates M. Burdon R.H. Knippenberg H.v.P Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. 3. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1986: 326-425Google Scholar). Genuine marker molecules (from Larodan, Malmo, Sweden) were added as internal standards. Silicic acid was scraped off plates, suspended in 0.2 ml of methanol, and analyzed for radioactivity by liquid scintillation in 2,5-diphenyloxazole/1,4-bis[2-(5-phenyloxazolyl)]benzene in toluene. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Separated proteins were detected with anti-caveolin-1, anti-insulin receptor β-subunit (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), anti-perilipin (generous gift of Dr. C. Londos, National Institutes of Health), or anti-fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (generous gift of Dr. J. E. Schaffer, Washington School of Medicine) antibodies. Bound antibodies were detected using ECL-plus with horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG as secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were quantitated by chemiluminiscence imaging (Las1000, Fuji). Electron Microscopy—Adipocytes were attached to poly-l-lysine-Formvar-coated nickel grids, which were flushed with ice-cold 150 mm KCl, 1.9 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4. Plasma membranes remaining on the grids were washed, fixed, and treated for immunogold labeling as described (4Thorn H. Stenkula K.G. Karlsson M. Örtegren U. Nystrom F.H. Gustavsson J. Strålfors P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3967-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) using primary antibodies against caveolin-1 or perilipin. Secondary IgG were conjugated with colloidal gold (Aurion, Wageningen, The Netherlands). Grids were lyophilized and coated with 2-nm-thick tungsten in the freeze dryer (26Lindroth M. Fredriksson B-A. Bell P.B. J. Microsc. (Oxf.). 1991; 161: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Transmission electron microscopy was with Jeol EX1200 TEM-SCAN (Jeol, Tokyo, Japan). Fluorescence Microscopy—Adipocytes were preincubated with 5 nm insulin for 10 min and the fluorescent fatty acid analogue C1-BODIPY 500/510 dodecanoic acid was added for 40 s when incubations were terminated with 2 mm KCN. Cells were rinsed and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and attached to poly-l-lysine coated coverslips. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% saponin, or plasma membrane sheets were prepared by flushing as described above (9Karlsson M. Thorn H. Danielsson A. Stenkula K.G. Öst A. Gustavsson J. Nystrom F.H. Strålfors P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2471-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). After blocking with bovine serum albumin cells were incubated with indicated primary antibody (anti-caveolin or anti-perilipin) and then fluorescent secondary antibodies (Alexa fluor 594 or 633). Confocal scanning microscopy was performed with a Nikon D-Eclipse CI (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). To examine uptake of fatty acids and their conversion to TG by intact cells we incubated primary rat adipocytes with radiolabeled oleic acid, isolated the plasma membranes, and separated caveolae by gradient ultracentrifugation. Caveolae fractions were then analyzed for radiolabel incorporation into TG and other lipids. Caveolae were obtained as two separate milky bands after ultracentrifugation, both of which contained caveolin and the insulin receptor (fractions 6 and 8, Fig. 1a). A shoulder of caveolin suggested also a third caveolae fraction (fraction 4, Fig. 1a), which was not further analyzed herein. The pattern of major proteins was very similar in the two major caveolae fractions (Fig. 1c), demonstrating their close relation. The protein perilipin, which regulates lipolysis (27Clifford G.M. Londos C. Kraemer F.B. Vernon R.G. Yeaman S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5011-5015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), and the fatty acyl-CoA synthetase, which catalyzes the first step in the TG synthesis pathway (28Gargiulo C.E. Stuhlsatz-Krouper S.M. Schaffer J.E. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 881-892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were, however, confined to the higher density caveolae fraction (fraction 6, Fig. 1a). We extracted lipids and analyzed for metabolic conversion products of the [3H]oleic acid by thin-layer chromatography. A substantial fraction of the cellular radioactive fatty acid was recovered in the high density perilipin-containing caveolae as TG but also as diacylglycerol and as fatty acid (Fig. 1b). We did not detect accumulated oleoyl-CoA, phosphatidic acid, or lysophosphatidic acid. It should be noted that larger TG-containing caveolae/lipid bulbs (see below) would have been lost to the large floating lipid fraction during homogenization and the following ultracentrifugation. This fraction contained about 2000- and 3000-fold more radiolabeled TG than the isolated plasma membrane after 40 and 120 s, respectively. When TG accumulates within the caveolae membrane the membrane has to expand to accommodate increasing amounts of TG and a coordinated synthesis of glycerophospholipids may be required. We analyzed for conversion of the [3H]oleic to glycerophospholipids and found significant amounts of radioactivity as phosphatidylcholine (Fig. 1b) and as an unidentified peak that was neither phosphatidylethanolamine nor phosphatidylinositol in the high density caveolae. Evidently, in intact adipocytes fatty acids are entering the cells and are converted to TG in a specific caveolar fraction. We also detected some TG, diacylglycerol, fatty acid, and phosphatidylcholine in the microsomal fraction, but the total amount of newly synthesized (radioactive) TG in the microsomal fraction was only about half of that in the plasma membrane fraction. The overall rate of [3H]oleic acid conversion to TG in the cells was about 100 nmol/min/ml of cells, which is about one-seventh the maximal rate of catecholamine-stimulated lipolytic hydrolysis of TG (4Thorn H. Stenkula K.G. Karlsson M. Örtegren U. Nystrom F.H. Gustavsson J. Strålfors P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3967-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 29Belfrage P. Fredriksson G. Strålfors P. Tornqvist H. Borgström B. Brockman H.L. Lipases. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1984: 365-416Google Scholar). It was not possible to directly determine how much of the TG synthesis of the adipocytes is localized to caveolae and therefore the plasma membrane, as newly synthesized TG was continually transferred to the central lipid droplet. We therefore determined the amount of the fatty acyl-CoA synthetase protein present in a purified plasma membrane fraction (including caveolae) compared with a whole-cell fat-free homogenate, using SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting; about 20% of the enzyme protein was recovered in the purified plasma membrane fraction (data not shown), indicating a substantial potential for TG synthesis in the plasma membrane with its caveolae (28Gargiulo C.E. Stuhlsatz-Krouper S.M. Schaffer J.E. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 881-892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To ascertain that de novo TG synthesis took place in caveolae and exclude any possibility of TG associating with caveolae during isolation of the organelles or of fatty acid exchange with preexisting TG, we isolated the two caveolae fractions (high and low density caveolae) and examined their ability to synthesize TG from the two precursors of TG synthesis: [3H]oleic acid and glycerol 3-phosphate or oleic acid and [14C]glycerol 3-phosphate, in the presence of CoA and ATP-Mg2+. Adipocytes were preincubated with insulin for 10 min before homogenization and isolation of plasma membrane, caveolae, and microsomal fractions. Isolated membrane fractions were incubated with the indicated TG precursors for 30 min at 37 °C when caveolae were pelleted and lipids extracted and analyzed by thin-layer chromatography. [3H]Oleic acid and [14C]glycerol 3-phosphate radioactivity was converted to TG by the high density caveolae and to a smaller extent by the low density caveolae fraction (Fig. 2a). To compare the TG-synthesizing capacity of caveolae in the plasma membrane with that of the endoplasmic reticulum, we compared the purified plasma membrane fraction with the microsomal fraction. The microsomal fraction synthesized TG to a similar extent as the plasma membrane with its caveolae (Fig. 2b). It should be noted that the TG synthetic capacity was compromised by the necessity to provide reagent access to the inside of plasma membrane vesicles by sonication and by the procedure used to isolate caveolae, which involves sonication in 0.5 mCO32− at pH 11. These procedures therefore introduced large variability from preparation to preparation. Recovery of both the oleic acid and glycerol 3-phosphate precursors in TG demonstrated de novo TG synthesis in the isolated caveolae.Fig. 2De novo TG synthesis in isolated caveolae, plasma membrane, and microsomal fractions.a and b, high (hd-cav) and low density (ld-cav) caveolae (corresponding to fractions 6 and 8, respectively, in Fig. 1) (a) or plasma membrane with its caveolae (pm) and microsomal (micr) fractions (b) were incubated with [3H]oleic acid (filled bars)or[14C]glycerol 3-phosphate (open bars) for 30 min.

Carozzi A. Luetterforst R. Enrich C. Parton R.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). As described here, in primary adipocytes, they are plasma membrane-associated, caveolae-derived structures and do not originate in the endoplasmic reticulum. It remains to determine whether these TG-containing caveolae should be classified as lipid bodies and if in fact different classes of lipid bodies exist. By electron microscopy of plasma membrane sheets stained with OsO4 we identified large, variously sized, lipid-laden bulbs scattered over the membrane (Fig. 3). Immunogold labeling showed that both caveolin (Fig. 3, a and b) and perilipin (Fig. 3, c and d) were associated with caveolae and with these lipid bulbs, thus demonstrating their caveolar nature and relation to the isolated TG-synthesizing caveolae identified above. Examination of plasma membrane sheets by electron microscopy relies on flushing the membranes to wash away cell debris and loosely attached cell material to reveal membrane structures. Too zealous flushing of the membranes will inevitably wash away the larger lipid bulbs, which may explain why they have previously remained uncharacterized. The actual accumulation of fatty acid in the caveolin/perilipin-associated bulbs was confirmed by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. In cells stimulated with insulin fluorescent fatty acids accumulated in caveolin-containing spots scattered over the cell periphery (Fig. 4, a and b). These amphiphilic molecules cannot accumulate or dissolve in the large lipid droplet unless they are converted to a non-polar form. They are therefore most likely in the form of triacylglycerol in the fluorescent-laden bulbs and in the lipid droplet (30Kasurinen J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1594-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Larger and indeed very large (>1 μm) fluorescent bulbs also appeared at the plasma membrane. These large bulbs were not covered with caveolin and appeared to penetrate and dissolve into the large central lipid droplet of the cell (Fig. 4, a and b). The same microscopic examination of plasma membrane sheets, prepared from the cells incubated with fluorescent fatty acid, demonstrated scattered fluorescent fatty acid-laden bulbs enclosed in perilipin at the caveolin-containing membrane (Fig. 4, c-h). Adipocyte cytosol constitutes a thin film between the plasma membrane and the lipid droplet. Except in the perinuclear region the thickness of the cytosol rarely exceeds 0.5 μm of the up to 100-μm diameter of the cell. It is obvious from the microscopic images and from the size of the bulbs that they exceeded the depth of the cytosol and that when TG accrues in the bulbs these may physically make contact with the central lipid droplet. It therefore is possible that the TG can be transferred from their site of synthesis in caveolae at the plasma membrane to their site of storage by establishing a physical connection. This would allow for a direct flow of TG from the plasma membrane/caveolae to the lipid droplet, as can indeed be inferred from the fluorescence microscopy. These findings are in agreement with the recently reported structural role for caveolin/caveolae in the lipid droplet formation inferred from studies of adipocytes from caveolin-1-/- mice (31Cohen A.W. Razani B. Schubert W. Williams T.M. Wang X.B. Iyengar P. Brasaemle D.L. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 1261-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). It should be possible to use electron microscopy and thin sections of adipocytes to examine for the presence of such bridges between the plasma membrane and the central lipid droplet. This report shows that caveolae are sites of fatty acid entry and sites of TG synthesis and may suggest a novel non-vesicular transport mechanism for TG transfer to the central lipid storage droplet in primary adipocytes. Triacylglycerol synthesis has been considered to take place in the endoplasmic reticulum (32Wilgram G.F. Kennedy E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 2615-2619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is appropriate for TG synthesis in enterocytes and hepatocytes where TG synthesis is coordinated with production of chylomicron and very low density lipoprotein particles, respectively. Adipocytes, on the other hand, are faced with a massive influx of potentially lethal fatty acids from lipoprotein lipase catalyzed hydrolysis of lipoprotein TG in the circulation. If these fatty acids are not immediately reacylated they will cause cell lysis (2Strålfors P. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 153-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this context it is interesting that caveolin-1-/- mice that lack caveolae exhibit a general adipose tissue derangement and atrophy, which increase with age (20Razani B. Combs T.P. Wang X.B. Frank P.G. Park D.S. Russel R.G. Li M. Tang B. Jelicks L.A. Scherer P.E. Lisant M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8635-8647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Our findings now demonstrate that all enzymes involved in the de novo synthesis of triacylglycerol from fatty acids and glycerol 3-phosphate are localized and functional in a novel specific subclass of caveolae in the plasma membrane of primary adipocytes. We are grateful to Dr. C. Londos and Dr. J. E. Schaffer for their generous sharing of antibodies."

Apoptosis of neurons is tightly regulated by extrinsic signals including growth factors and neuronal activity, but the intracellular mechanisms by which these signals promote neuronal survival are incompletely understood. We report that the transcription factor NFAT3 plays a critical role in mediating survival of granule neurons of the developing cerebellum. NFAT3 accumulated in the nucleus of primary granule neurons under survival conditions of serum growth factors and neuronal activity that was elicited by depolarization with high K+. In contrast, deprivation of serum and K+, which leads to neuronal apoptosis, triggered NFAT3 nuclear export. Treatment of granule neurons with Li+, an inhibitor of the NFAT export kinase GSK3, prevented the nuclear export of NFAT3 and increased granule cell survival even under pro-apoptotic conditions. Thus, the nuclear localization of NFAT3 correlated tightly with granule neuron survival.

Taken together, these results reveal an essential function for NFAT3-mediated transcription in neuronal survival that may play important roles in the developing and mature brain. The study of neuronal survival and apoptosis is a central focus in neurobiology and neurology. Neurons are generated in excess during the development of the nervous system, and therefore their numbers need to be controlled by programmed cell death or apoptosis to ensure the proper wiring of the nervous system (1Lewin G.R. Barde Y-A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 289-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1788) Google Scholar). In the developing mammalian brain, a number of extrinsic factors tightly control apoptosis. Polypeptide growth factors and neuronal activity are all thought to play critical roles in suppressing apoptosis and promoting neuronal survival (1Lewin G.R. Barde Y-A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 289-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1788) Google Scholar, 2Franklin J.L. Johnson Jr., E.M Trends Neurosci. 1992; 15: 501-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In the adult brain, apoptosis of neurons occurs under pathological conditions in response to a variety of insults including ischemia and neurodegenerative processes (3Choi D.W. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 667-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 4Lowenstein D.H. Shimosaka S. So Y.T. Simon R.P.

Because of the importance of neuronal survival and apoptosis in brain development and disease, there is tremendous interest in characterizing the intracellular mechanisms by which extrinsic factors control neuronal apoptosis. A model system that has been widely used in studies of neuronal survival is the primary cerebellar granule neuron culture system (6D'Mello S.R. Galli C. Ciotti T. Calissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10989-10993Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 7Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar). In the developing rodent cerebellum, granule neurons undergo developmentally regulated apoptosis peaking at the end of the first week of postnatal life (8Wood K.A. Dipasquale B. Youle R.J. Neuron. 1993; 11: 621-632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Granule neurons cultured from rats or mice around this time of development undergo cell death in culture unless they are provided with extrinsic survival factors. Maximal survival is provided by a combination of growth factors typically provided by serum together with neuronal activity and mimicked by high extracellular concentrations of potassium chloride that depolarize the membrane and induce activation of voltage-sensitive calcium channels (9D'Mello S.R. Borodezt K. Soltoff S.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1548-1560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Padmanabhan J. Park D. Greene L.A. Shelanski M.L. J.

The signaling mechanisms by which growth factors and neuronal activity promote the survival of cerebellar granule neurons are beginning to be characterized. Protein kinase cascades figure prominently in the control of neuronal survival. The ERK1/2-Rsk, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt, and ERK5 protein kinase signaling pathways play critical roles in mediating the survival of granule neurons upon exposure to the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (13Bonni A. Brunet A. West A. Datta S.R. Takasu M. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1358-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar, 14Shalizi A. Lehtinen M. Gaudilliere B. Donovan N. Han J. Konishi Y. Bonni A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7326-7336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt signaling pathway plays a central role in mediating insulin-like growth factor 1-mediated neuronal survival (15Brunet A. Datta S.R. Greenberg M.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). The influx of calcium via voltage-sensitive calcium channels promotes neuronal survival through activation of the protein kinases p38MAPK and calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) (16Mao Z. Bonni A. Xia F. Nadal-Vicens M. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 17See V. Boutillier A.L. Bito H. Loeffler J.P. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 134-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Removal of survival factors promotes neuronal apoptosis in part because of inactivity of pro-survival protein kinases. However, deprivation of survival factors also leads to stimulation of other protein kinases that impart an apoptotic signal in neurons.

Although the mechanisms by which pro-survival and pro-apoptotic kinases regulate neuronal survival remain to be elucidated, a common theme that has emerged from studies of neuronal apoptosis and survival is that many of these kinases act via transcription factors. For instance, the ERK1/2-Rsk and CaMKIV protein kinase pathways activate CREB 1The abbreviations used are: CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T cells; RNAi, RNA interference; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TBS, Tris-buffered saline. to promote survival (13Bonni A.

FASEB J. 2001; 15: 134-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), whereas the p38MAPK and ERK5 signaling pathways activate the transcription factor MEF2 (14Shalizi A. Lehtinen M. Gaudilliere B.

Akt, which is activated via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, promotes neuronal survival in part by phosphorylating and thereby inhibiting FOXO3-mediated transcription (15Brunet A. Datta S.R. Greenberg M.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar); it may also act by inactivating GSK3 and therefore activating the transcription factor NFAT as discussed later. Among the apoptotic kinases, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase induces transcription of apoptotic genes via the transcription factor c-Jun (18Estus S. Zaks W.J. Freeman R.S. Gruda M. Bravo R.

NFAT is a family of highly phosphorylated transcription factors that undergo shuttling between the cytoplasm and nucleus (27Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev.

The nuclear import of NFAT proteins requires dephosphorylation by the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin, whereas their nuclear export requires rephosphorylation, which can be mediated by a variety of kinases including GSK3 (30Crabtree G.R.

Nature. 1999; 401: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar); conversely, treatment of cells with the GSK3 inhibitor LiCl slows the rate of NFAT nuclear export, thus prolonging the nuclear residence time of NFAT (35Klemm J.D. Beals C.R. Crabtree G.R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 638-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). GSK3 is a downstream target of Akt, which promotes an inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3 on a serine residue near the amino terminus (36Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar). Thus conditions that activate Akt concurrently inhibit GSK3, prolonging the nuclear residence of NFAT (37Diehn M. Alizadeh A.A. Rando O.J. Liu C.L. Stankunas K. Botstein D. Crabtree G.R. Brown P.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11796-11801Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In neurons, GSK3 has been demonstrated to inhibit the transcriptional activity of the NFAT family member NFAT3 (34Graef I.A. Mermelstein P.G. Stankunas K. Neilson J.R. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1999; 401: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar).

However, the role of endogenous NFAT3 in mediating cell survival responses has not yet been characterized. In this study, we report that NFAT3 plays a critical role in mediating growth factor and activity-dependent survival of cerebellar granule neurons. Both endogenous NFAT3 and exogenously expressed NFAT3 in granule neurons were found in the nucleus under standard culture conditions in which the combination of serum and high K+ promotes neuronal survival. By contrast, serum withdrawal and low K+ conditions triggered the nuclear export of both endogenous and exogenous NFAT3 to the cytoplasm, and this process was tightly correlated with subsequent neuronal cell death. Both NFAT3 nuclear export and granule cell apoptosis were blocked by the GSK3 inhibitor LiCl. Furthermore, genetic knockdown of NFAT3 by RNA interference triggered apoptosis of granule neurons even under survival conditions of serum growth factors and neuronal activity, whereas expression of a constitutively active form of NFAT protected granule neurons against apoptosis induced by serum/K+ withdrawal. Together, these findings suggest that NFAT3-dependent transcription plays a critical role in promoting the survival of neurons and that GSK3 may promote neuronal apoptosis by inhibiting NFAT3-mediated neuronal survival in the developing brain. Because GSK3 is thought to contribute to neuronal loss in the adult brain in response to neurodegenerative insults (39Kaytor M.D. Orr H.T. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2002; 12: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), NFAT3-promoted neuronal survival may also play important roles in the mature brain. Antibodies—For immunocytochemistry to detect endogenous NFAT3, we used commercial anti-NFAT3 (Affinity Bioreagents). For Western blot experiments to detect exogenous NFAT3, we used anti-NFAT3 polyclonal antibody from an immunization of New Zealand rabbits against a carboxyl-terminal peptide of mouse NFAT3. Unfortunately none of these antibodies were effective in detecting endogenous NFAT3 in Western blotting of protein lysates from cerebellar granule neurons. Plasmids—FLAG-tagged NFAT3 and Rep4-NFAT3 constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Chi-Wing Chow (Albert Einstein College of Medicine). The RNAi constructs targeting NFAT3 were designed following the method of Gaudillière et al. (40Gaudillière B. Shi Y. Bonni A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46442-46446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The NFAT3-C RNAi targets the mouse/human sequence 564 gggacggctctcctagagatt 584, and the NFAT3-N RNAi targets the rat sequence 2305 gggcggaggagcgcagtccc 2326. The RNAi construct for cdk2 was a gift from Dr. Yang Shi (Harvard Medical School). Culture and Treatment of Cerebellar Granule Neurons—Cerebellar granule neurons were isolated from cerebellum of 6-day-old Long Evans rat pups and cultured as described by (14Shalizi A. Lehtinen M. Gaudilliere B. Donovan N. Han J. Konishi Y. Bonni A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7326-7336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After 3 days, 35 mm glucose was added to the culture medium. After 2–5 days in vitro, cultures were washed three times in basal medium (basal medium eagle (Sigma) containing penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine and 17.5 mm glucose) followed by incubation either in basal medium or in depolarizing/survival medium (basal medium eagle supplemented with 10% calf serum + 25 mm KCl). The incubation time was 6 h for the NFAT3 localization assay or 24 h for apoptosis assays. Where indicated, 10 mm LiCl (or the same volume of 10 mm NaCl as control) was added 1 h prior to the washes with basal medium eagle and then included in the subsequent culture with basal medium or KCl/serum medium. Cerebellar granule neurons were transfected with CsCl gradient-purified plasmid DNA using a modified calcium phosphate method (23Konishi Y. Lehtinen M. Donovan N. Bonni A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1005-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Briefly, granule neurons cultured for 4 days in vitro were transfected with 1 μg of the test plasmid per well of a 24-well plate. For the RNAi experiments, granule neurons cultured for 2 days in vitro were transfected with 2 μg of the RNAi construct or control plasmids as modified by Konishi et al. (23Konishi Y. Lehtinen M. Donovan N. Bonni A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1005-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) together with 0.25 μg of expression plasmids encoding β-galactosidase or green fluorescent protein (GFP) to identify the transfected cells. Immunocytochemistry—Cells were fixed in 24-well plates with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 4% sucrose. After 20 min at room temperature, the fixed cells were washed three times with 0.5 ml of PBS. Then they were permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min and washed three times with 0.5 ml of PBS per well. Incubation with blocking solution (10% dry milk, 1–2% goat serum (Sigma), 0.02% Tween in Tris-buffered saline (TBS)) was performed for 1 h. The coverslips were transferred to a bed of parafilm and incubated overnight at 4 °C in 50 μl of primary antibody diluted in 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% Tween in TBS. The primary antibodies used were NFAT3 polyclonal antibody (Affinity Bioreagents), Tuj1 monoclonal antibody (Covance) or M2 FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma) in 1% goat serum. After washes, 1:500 of Cy3- or Cy2-conjugated goat secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) in 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% Tween in TBS was added. After incubation for 1 h and three washes of 10 min each, the cell nuclei were stained as described below (see “Apoptosis Assay”). The cells were imaged using an Eclipse TE2000-U Nikon microscope using a ×60 oil immersion lens. For the peptide blocking experiment, the commercial rabbit NFAT3 antibody (Affinity Bioreagents) was preincubated with control peptide or buffer and then centrifuged in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at 4 °C. The supernatant was carefully transferred to a fresh tube and diluted for the immunocytochemistry procedure. Apoptosis Assay—For this assay, cells were fixed and permeabilized as described above, and their nuclei were stained by adding 50 μl of 0.2 μg/ml DNA dye bisbenzimide (Hoechst 33258) in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. After 5 min, the cells were washed three times with PBS, and the coverslips were mounted on slides containing 6 μlof5% n-propyl gallate in 1:1 (v/v) glycerol:10× PBS. The cells were imaged as described above (see “Immunocytochemistry”). ∼200 cells or ∼100 transfected β-galactosidase or GFP-positive cells were counted per condition. They were classified according to the appearance of their nuclei and the integrity of their neurites. Cells showing a condensed nucleus and disintegrated neurites were classified as apoptotic. Quantifying Nuclear-Cytoplasmic Distribution of NFAT3—Images were acquired with a fully motorized wide field epifluorescence microscope (Axiovert 200M, Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) under control of SlideBook (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Denver, CO). The microscope was equipped with phase contrast optics, motorized filter turret, and lens holder, and a ×60 oil immersion lens (Pan Apochromat, NA 1.3; Carl Zeiss, Inc.). Samples were illuminated with a 175-watt xenon lamp source (Sutter Instruments Co., Novato, CA) optically coupled to the microscope with a liquid guide. Three-dimensional image stacks were recorded by sequential acquisition of optical sections recorded along the z axis every 0.25 μm (step size) by varying the position of the lens holder. Then images were restored in three dimensions by constrained iterative deconvolution (41Agard D.A. Hiraoka Y. Shaw P. Sedat J.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 30: 353-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar) with Slidebook using experimentally determined point-spread functions corresponding to 0.17 μm beads labeled with fluorescent dyes (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) compatible with the 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and Cy3 filter sets. Three-dimensional surface rendering of the restored images was obtained with Velocity (Improvision, Inc., Lexington, MA). ∼150 cells were analyzed blinded for NFAT3 localization. Transfection of HEK 293T Cells—293T cells were maintained in 60-mm plates (Corning) in 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine (Invitrogen) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro). Confluent cultures were dissociated by incubation with 0.3 ml of trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen) for 3 min before passaging. Cells were transfected 1 day after passaging using the calcium phosphate method described in Ref. 23Konishi Y. Lehtinen M. Donovan N. Bonni A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1005-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar. For each well of a 6-well plate, 0.18 ml of CaCl2/Hanks' buffered salt solution precipitate was added to the cells. The cells were co-transfected with either 0.5 μg of cdk2 RNAi, NFAT3-N RNAi, or NFAT3-C RNAi constructs together with 0.5 μg of FLAG-tagged NFAT3 or Rep4-NFAT3. For an internal control of transfection efficiency, 0.25 μg of FLAG-tagged 14.3.3 protein was used. Negative controls were performed with 0.5 μg of empty pU6, pcDNA3, or Rep4 vectors. Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell lysates of 293T cells were prepared after 4 or 5 days of transfection as indicated. Protein amounts were measured by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad), and 10 μg of each lysate was analyzed by electrophoresis on 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) at 250 mA for 1 h. The membrane was blocked in 5% dry milk in TBS for 2 h, washed with 0.05% Tween 20 in TBS, and incubated for 2 h with the primary antibody diluted in 5% milk, 0.05% Tween 20 in TBS and then washed again and incubated with the secondary antibody. The dilutions utilized were 1:7500 for the NFAT3 antibody produced in a New Zealand rabbit, 1:500 for M2 FLAG antibody (Sigma), and 1:20,000 for anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma). LiCl Inhibits Apoptosis Induced by Serum and K+ Deprivation—Cerebellar granule neurons were obtained from 6-day-old rats and cultured in 10% calf serum and 30 mm KCl (depolarizing conditions) for 5 days in vitro. These concentrations of KCl lead to depolarization of the neuronal membrane and mimic neuronal activity, an extrinsic cue that promotes survival of neurons in the developing brain (2Franklin J.L. Johnson Jr., E.M Trends Neurosci. 1992; 15: 501-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Membrane depolarization induces activation of voltage-sensitive calcium channels and consequent entry of calcium into the neurons (12Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1958) Google Scholar). Serum is provided as a source of pro-survival growth factors. We tested whether LiCl was protective against apoptosis under our culture conditions (Fig. 1). When granule neurons that had been cultured for 4 days in vitro were incubated with basal medium for 24 h, 88% of the neurons showed apoptosis as judged by Hoechst staining for apoptotic nuclei, whereas neurons that were maintained in full survival medium were viable (<10% apoptosis) (compare first and fourth bars). However if the neurons were pretreated with 10 mm LiCl for 1 h before transfer into basal medium, fewer than 30% were apoptotic at the end of 24 h (compare first and third bars). Control treatment with 10 mm NaCl was much less effective in protecting against apoptosis (70% apoptosis; compare first and second bars). Neither NaCl nor LiCl had a significant effect on survival of the neurons in medium containing KCl and serum (fifth and sixth bars). These results confirmed previous studies showing that LiCl promotes survival of mature cerebellar granule neurons (25Mora A. Sabio G. Gonzalez-Polo R.A. Cuenda A. Alessi D.R. Alonso J.C. Fuentes J.M. Soler G. Centeno F. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Because LiCl is a known inhibitor of GSK3 (42Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar), an NFAT kinase that deactivates NFAT and promotes its export from the nucleus, we asked whether NFAT3 had a role in the survival of cerebellar granule neurons. NFAT3 Is Expressed in Cerebellar Granule Neurons—First we asked which of the four members of the NFAT family were expressed in cerebellar granule neurons. Although NFAT1 and NFAT2 were present by immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis, respectively, NFAT2 was expressed at low levels, and NFAT1 was cytoplasmic in complete medium containing KCl and serum (data not shown), leading us to focus on NFAT3. We demonstrated the presence of NFAT3 in granule neurons by immunocytochemistry with a polyclonal antiserum against a peptide of NFAT3 (Fig. 2). Cerebellar granule neurons maintained in survival medium with serum and high K+ were co-stained with anti-NFAT3 and a monoclonal antibody for the neurofilament marker Tuj1, a marker for postmitotic neuronal cells (Fig. 2A). Under these conditions, endogenous NFAT3 can be detected in Tuj1-positive neurons where it is localized to the nucleus. The specificity of the NFAT3 antibody was confirmed by peptide competition experiments; the immunofluorescence signal in neurons stained with the antibody/peptide complex was greatly reduced compared with the staining observed using antibody incubated with buffer alone (Fig. 2B). Serum and K+ Deprivation Promotes the Nuclear Export of NFAT3—As shown above (Fig. 2), endogenous NFAT3 was nuclear in most cerebellar granule neurons under depolarizing conditions. However in basal media lacking KCl and serum, NFAT3 appeared largely cytoplasmic (Fig. 3). To quantify this effect, we performed immunocytochemistry for NFAT3, concurrently staining the nuclei with Hoechst dye. Then we acquired images in diverse planes of a random field and analyzed NFAT3 localization in a stack of images that were overlaid. This procedure allowed us to determine the specific nuclear signal. Fig. 3A shows examples of the three-dimensional reconstruction in two neurons showing nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of NFAT3, respectively. In several such experiments, 66 + 5% of cerebellar granule neurons maintained in full survival medium showed nuclear NFAT3 consistent with the fact that KCl treatment activates an increase in intracellular calcium levels, thus promoting the nuclear localization of NFAT (Fig. 3B). In contrast after 6 h of serum deprivation and KCl deprivation, just 11 + 6% of neurons showed nuclear NFAT3 (Fig. 3B). Thus, KCl and serum withdrawal triggers the nuclear export of NFAT3. To confirm the differential localization of NFAT3 in full survival media compared with basal media, FLAG-tagged NFAT3 was expressed in cerebellar granule"
https://openalex.org/W2095069794,"The first galaxies to appear in the universe at redshifts z>20 created ionized bubbles in the intergalactic medium of neutral hydrogen left over from the Big-Bang. It is thought that the ionized bubbles grew with time, surrounded clusters of dwarf galaxies and eventually overlapped quickly throughout the universe over a narrow redshift interval near z~6. This event signaled the end of the reionization epoch when the universe was a billion years old. Measuring the hitherto unknown size distribution of the bubbles at their final overlap phase is a focus of forthcoming observational programs aimed at highly redshifted 21cm emission from atomic hydrogen. Here we show that the combined constraints of cosmic variance and causality imply an observed bubble size at the end of the overlap epoch of ~10 physical Mpc, and a scatter in the observed redshift of overlap along different lines-of-sight of ~0.15. This scatter is consistent with observational constraints from recent spectroscopic data on the farthest known quasars. Our novel result implies that future radio experiments should be tuned to a characteristic angular scale of ~0.5 degrees and have a minimum frequency band-width of ~8 MHz for an optimal detection of 21cm flux fluctuations near the end of reionization."
https://openalex.org/W2092790345,"In pancreatic beta cells, insulin granule exocytosis is regulated by SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor protein (SNAP) receptor) proteins, and this is coupled to cortical F-actin reorganization via the Rho family GTPase Cdc42 by an unknown mechanism. We investigated interactions among the target SNARE protein Syntaxin 1A and the vesicle-associated membrane SNARE protein (VAMP2) with Cdc42 and compared these structural interactions with their functional importance to glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in MIN6 beta cells. Subcellular fractionation analyses revealed a parallel redistribution of Cdc42 and VAMP2 from the granule fraction to the plasma membrane in response to glucose that temporally corresponded with the glucose-induced activation of Cdc42. Moreover, within these fractions Cdc42 and VAMP2 were found to co-immunoprecipitate under basal and glucose-stimulated conditions, suggesting that they moved as a complex. Furthermore, VAMP2 bound both GST-Cdc42-GTPγS and GST-Cdc42-GDP, indicating that the Cdc42-VAMP2 complex could form under both cytosolic GDP-bound Cdc42 and plasma membrane GTP-bound Cdc42 conformational conditions. In vitro binding analyses showed that VAMP2 bound directly to Cdc42 and that a heterotrimeric complex with Syntaxin 1A could also be formed. Deletion analyses of VAMP2 revealed that only the N-terminal 28 residues were required for Cdc42 binding. Expression of this 28-residue VAMP2 peptide in MIN6 beta cells resulted in the specific impairment of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, indicating a functional importance for the Cdc42-VAMP2 interaction. Taken together, these data suggest a mechanism whereby glucose activates Cdc42 to induce the targeting of intracellular Cdc42-VAMP2-insulin granule complexes to Syntaxin 1A at the plasma membrane.

Taken together, these data suggest a mechanism whereby glucose activates Cdc42 to induce the targeting of intracellular Cdc42-VAMP2-insulin granule complexes to Syntaxin 1A at the plasma membrane. Glucose stimulates insulin exocytosis by inducing fusion of a readily releasable pool of plasma membrane-localized insulin granules (primed) and through the mobilization and trafficking of insulin granules to the cell surface from intracellular storage pools (1Rorsman P.

Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2000: 20-38Google Scholar). Increased glucose flux into pancreatic beta cells results in increased glycolysis and elevation of the intracellular ATP/ADP ratio, which in turn induces closure of the ATP-sensitive K+ channels and cell depolarization (3Meglasson M.D. Matschinsky F.M.

Like many other regulated vesicle exocytosis events, fusion of granules with the plasma membrane is achieved by the specific pairing of the target membrane soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein (SNAP) 1The abbreviations used are: SNAP, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein; SNARE, SNAP receptor; t-SNARE, target SNARE; v-SNARE; vesicle membrane SNARE; MKRBB, modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)-triphosphate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; PM, plasma membrane; TM, transmembrane; GDI, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; VAMP2, vesicle-associated membrane protein 2. receptor (t-SNARE) proteins with the vesicle membrane SNAP receptor (v-SNARE) (10Jahn R.

While this provides a mechanism for fusion in cellular pathways using SNARE proteins to mediate vesicular exocytosis, the pathway involved in the regulated targeting of granules/vesicles to their cognate t-SNAREs at the plasma membrane fusion sites remains unclear. Filamentous actin (F-actin) is known to be important to the process of insulin secretion (19Wilson J.R. Ludowyke R.I. Biden T.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 20Li G. Rungger-Brandle E. Just I. Jonas J.C. Aktories K. Wollheim C.B. Mol. Biol.

Our recent studies in MIN6 beta cells and isolated rat islets demonstrate that glucose transiently modulates cortical actin organization and disrupts the interaction of F-actin with the t-SNARE complex at the plasma membrane to facilitate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (22Thurmond D.C. Gonelle-Gispert C. Furukawa M. Halban P.A. Pessin J.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Further evidence indicates that the cortical actin reorganization induced by glucose occurs at a proximal step in the stimulus-secretion pathway perhaps at a step concurrent with the ATP-sensitive K+ channel closure (23Nevins A.K. Thurmond D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C698-C710Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, our understanding of the coupling of SNARE-mediated exocytosis to F-actin reorganization remains incomplete. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the F-actin effector protein Cdc42, a Rho family small GTPase, is a downstream target of glucose signaling in beta cells. For example, we have recently shown that stimulation with glucose results in alterations in the cycling of Cdc42 between the GTP-bound activated and GDP-bound inactivated states (23Nevins A.K. Thurmond D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C698-C710Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Cdc42 has also been demonstrated to co-localize with VAMP2-containing insulin secretory granules in pancreatic beta cells (24Kowluru A. Metz S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1222: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 25Kowluru A. Seavey S.E. Li G. Sorenson R.L. Weinhaus A.J. Nesher R. Rabaglia M.E. Vadakekalam J. Metz S.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 540-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Moreover Cdc42 has been shown to interact indirectly with the t-SNARE Syntaxin 1A, linking Cdc42 and the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane exocytotic machinery (26Daniel S. Noda M. Cerione R.A. Sharp G.W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9663-9671Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, given that Cdc42 and VAMP2 are both present on insulin secretory granules and that both interact with Syntaxin 1A, we hypothesized that VAMP2 bridged the interaction between Cdc42 and Syntaxin 1A and that the interactions were functionally important for SNARE-dependent insulin exocytosis. In this study, we describe a novel mechanism by which Cdc42 regulates SNARE-mediated exocytosis through vesicle targeting. We show that Cdc42 directly interacts with VAMP2 in the insulin granule compartment and that both proteins traffic in parallel to the plasma membrane in response to glucose stimulation at an early step in the stimulus-secretion pathway. This interaction is mediated through the N terminus of VAMP2 and is important for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Taken together, these data suggest a mechanism whereby glucose induces the activation of Cdc42 to facilitate the localization of intracellular Cdc42-VAMP2-bound vesicles to the Syntaxin 1A-SNAP25 complexes at the plasma membrane for subsequent fusion. Importantly the Cdc42-VAMP2 interaction may represent a more general mechanism by which vesicles are targeted to the SNARE machinery in other cell types as well.

The pGEX-Cdc42 construct was a gift from Lawrence Quilliam (Indiana University School of Medicine). The full-length pcDNA3-VAMP2-(1–116) construct was obtained as reported previously (27Thurmond D.C.

Nucleotide sequences encoding VAMP2 amino acids 1–94, deletion of the transmembrane domain, were amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides that were designed to contain EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. This PCR product was subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector. Nucleotide sequences encoding VAMP2 amino acids 1–56 and amino acids 1–28, deletions of the C-terminal half and the N-terminal half of the SNARE motif, respectively, were amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides that were designed to contain BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, and subcloned into pcDNA3. PCR products were also designed with EcoRI and SalI restriction sites for insertion into the enhanced green fluorescent protein (pEGFP-N3) expression vector from BD Biosciences to generate VAMP2-(1–56)-EGFP and VAMP2-(1–28)-EGFP. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—CHO-K1 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 292 μg/ml l-glutamine. At 80–90% confluency cells were electroporated with 40 μg of DNA as described previously (27Thurmond D.C. Ceresa B.P. Okada S. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33876-33883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Under these conditions ∼70–80% of cells were transfected. After 48 h of incubation in medium, cells were harvested in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 50 μm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 137 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin), and lysates were cleared by microcentrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C for subsequent use in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. MIN6 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (25 mm glucose) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 292 μg/ml l-glutamine, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol as described previously (22Thurmond D.C.

MIN6 cells plated in 10-cm tissue culture dishes at 40–60% confluency were electroporated with 300 μg of plasmid DNA/cuvette (one 10-cm dish/cuvette) to obtain ∼50–70% transfection efficiency using a procedure described previously (29Saito T.

After 48 h of incubation, cells were washed twice with and incubated for 2 h in 1 ml of modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (MKRBB) (22Thurmond D.C. Gonelle-Gispert C. Furukawa M. Halban P.A.

Physiol. 2003; 285: C698-C710Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and stimulated with glucose (20 mm) or KCl (50 mm). Insulin secreted into the MKRBB was quantitated by an insulin immunoassay kit (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO). Cells were subsequently lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer to generate whole-cell detergent homogenates for quantitation of insulin content by insulin radioimmunoassay and for co-immunoprecipitation assays. For measurement of human C-peptide release, MIN6 cells were transiently co-transfected with the human proinsulin expression vector (pCB6/INS), a kind gift from Chris Newgard (Duke University), using Tfx-50 (Promega) with 2.5 μg of DNA/construct/35-mm dish. Forty-eight hours following transfection, cells were stimulated with the secretagogue (20 mm glucose or 50 mm KCl), and MKRBB was collected for quantitation of human C-peptide released using a human C-peptide immunoassay kit (Linco Research). Recombinant Proteins and Interaction Assays—GST-Cdc42 and GST-VAMP2-(1–94) fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography as described previously (30Min J. Okada S. Kanzaki M. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K.J. Ceresa B.P. Syu L.J. Noda Y. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 751-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Recombinant VAMP2 was obtained following thrombin cleavage of GST-VAMP2 (Novagen kit). GST-Cdc42 linked to glutathione-Sepharose beads was loaded with GTPγS or GDP as described previously (31Zong H. Raman N. Mickelson-Young L.A. Atkinson S.J. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4551-4560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly 10 μg of GST-Cdc42 linked to Sepharose beads was incubated in buffer (0.1 m Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 m NaCl) at a final concentration of 0.1 mm GTPγS or GDP for 10 min at 30 °C and then combined with 50 mm MgCl2. GTPγS- or GDP-loaded GST-Cdc42-Sepharose was incubated with cleared detergent lysates (1 mg) for 2 h at 37 °C. Following three washes with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 2.5 mm MgCl2, proteins were eluted from the Sepharose beads and subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to PVDF membrane for immunoblotting. Co-immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—CHO-K1 and MIN6 cell cleared detergent homogenates (1–2 mg) were combined with 5 μg of mouse VAMP2 (Sy Sy) antibody for 2 h at 4 °C followed by a second incubation with protein G Plus-agarose for 2 h. The resultant immunoprecipitates were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to PVDF membranes for immunoblotting. Primary antibodies were used at 1:1000 dilutions, and secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were diluted at 1:10,000 for visualization by enhanced chemiluminescence. Immunoprecipitation experiments using recombinant proteins were performed similarly using 10 μg of the VAMP2 (Sy Sy) antibody using a mixture of Syntaxin 1A (10 μm), Cdc42-His (10 μm), and VAMP2-(1–94) (50 μm) proteins in 0.25% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Subcellular Fractionation—Subcellular fractions were isolated as described previously (32Kowluru A. Seavey S.E. Rhodes C.J. Metz S.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly MIN6 cells at 70–80% confluence were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested into 1 ml of homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 250 mm sucrose, and 1 mm dithiothreitol containing the following protease inhibitors: leupeptin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (4 μg/ml), pepstatin (2 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 μm)). Cells were disrupted by 10 strokes through a 27-gauge needle, and homogenates were centrifuged at 900 × g for 10 min. Postnuclear supernatants were centrifuged at 5,500 × g for 15 min, and the subsequent supernatant was centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min to obtain the secretory granule fraction in the pellet. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain the cytosolic fraction. All steps were performed at 4 °C. Plasma membrane fractions were obtained using a protocol by Hubbard et al. (33Hubbard A.L. Ma A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly the postnuclear pellet was mixed with 1 ml of Buffer A (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and 2 volumes of Buffer B (2 m sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). The mixture was overlaid with Buffer A and centrifuged at 113,000 × g for 1 h to obtain an interface containing the plasma membrane. The interface was collected and diluted to 2 ml with homogenization buffer for centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting pellet was collected as the plasma membrane fraction. Fractions were assayed for soluble protein content as described previously (34Sedmak J.J. Grossberg S.E. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 79: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (2502) Google Scholar). Cdc42 and VAMP2 Cycle to the Plasma Membrane upon Stimulation with Glucose—We have recently reported that glucose-stimulated insulin secretion requires the cycling of Cdc42 activation states and that glucose induces peak activation of Cdc42 within 3 min of stimulation (23Nevins A.K. Thurmond D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C698-C710Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To determine whether the alterations in Cdc42 activation state also affected the cellular localization of Cdc42 during stimulation by glucose, MIN6 beta cell extracts were partitioned into fractions enriched for plasma membrane, cytosolic, and granule components using differential centrifugation. Consistent with previous studies (35Li G. Kowluru A. Metz S.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 36Mitchell K.J. Tsuboi T. Rutter G.A. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the granule fraction had the highest insulin content with lesser amounts present in the plasma membrane (PM) and cytosolic fractions (Fig. 1A). Immunoblot analysis demonstrated the presence of Cdc42 in the PM, cytosol, and granule fractions (Fig. 1B). VAMP2 was localized to the particulate PM and granule fractions and was absent from the cytosol (Fig. 1B) as was the other transmembrane-containing SNARE protein Syntaxin 1A (data not shown). Glucose stimulation for 3 min resulted in an increase in the amount of Cdc42 protein in the plasma membrane fraction (Fig. 1B, lane 2) with a concomitant reduction of Cdc42 in the cytosol and granule fractions when compared with basal levels (Fig. 1B, lanes 3–6). Similarly glucose stimulated an increase in the amount of VAMP2 protein in the PM (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2) with a parallel reduction in the granule fraction (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6). Quantitation of immunoblots using optical density scanning revealed a 30% increase of VAMP2 in the plasma membrane following 3 min of glucose stimulation and a parallel loss in the granule fraction (Fig. 1C). Cdc42 abundance in the plasma membrane was increased by 2.4-fold with a simultaneous reduction in both the granule and cytosolic fractions after glucose stimulation (Fig. 1D). An independent analysis of Cdc42 and VAMP2 localization using immunofluorescent confocal microscopy showed a similar redistribution to the cell periphery upon glucose stimulation for 3 min (data not shown). Therefore, these data indicated that Cdc42 and VAMP2 co-localized in the insulin-enriched granule fraction and that glucose stimulated recruitment of Cdc42 from the cytosolic and granule compartment to the plasma membrane along with the mobilization of VAMP2-containing granules to the plasma membrane. In addition, these data implicate a coordinated spatial and temporal movement of Cdc42 with the VAMP2-bound insulin secretory granules in response to glucose stimulation. Cdc42 Associates with VAMP2-bound Insulin Granules— Since both Cdc42 and VAMP2 were found to co-localize in a similar spatial and temporal manner in response to glucose, we next asked whether Cdc42 and VAMP2 interacted and whether such an interaction could be modulated in a glucose-dependent manner. To determine this, VAMP2 was immunoprecipitated from detergent lysates made from MIN6 cells either unstimulated or stimulated with 20 mm glucose for 3 or 5 min (Fig. 2A), the same time points in which we have previously shown that Cdc42 becomes activated and deactivated, respectively, in MIN6 beta cells (23Nevins A.K. Thurmond D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C698-C710Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of VAMP2 from unstimulated cells resulted in the co-immunoprecipitation of Cdc42, indicating that the two proteins associate under basal conditions. Furthermore Cdc42 was similarly co-immunoprecipitated from lysates prepared from cells stimulated with glucose for 3 and 5 min, suggesting that VAMP2 and Cdc42 complexes formed both on the granules and at the plasma membrane in both basal and glucose-stimulated states. To determine whether VAMP2-Cdc42 complexes redistributed in parallel from the granule to the plasma membrane fraction, VAMP2 was immunoprecipitated from each fraction isolated in the subcellular fractionation experiments for immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2B). In each fraction, VAMP2 and Cdc42 co-immunoprecipitated under both the basal and glucose-stimulated conditions. Moreover the amount of Cdc42 interacting with VAMP2 in each fraction under basal conditions remained relatively unchanged after stimulation with glucose for 3 min. Taken together, these data suggested that Cdc42 and VAMP2 interacted under basal conditions on intracellular pools of insulin granules and were recruited as a complex to the plasma membrane upon glucose-induced activation of Cdc42. We have previously demonstrated that glucose activates Cdc42 within 3 min of stimulation, but by 5 min Cdc42 cycles to a deactivated state (23Nevins A.K. Thurmond D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C698-C710Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Since we observed similar amounts of Cdc42 interacting with VAMP2 throughout this time course, we questioned whether the activation state of Cdc42 would affect its interaction with VAMP2. GST-Cdc42 bound to Sepharose beads was loaded with either GDP or GTPγS, a non-hydrolyzable analogue of GTP, and immediately incubated with MIN6 cell lysates (Fig. 3). Precipitation of GST-Cdc42-GTPγS or GST-Cdc42-GDP beads resulted in the co-precipitation of similar amounts of VAMP2 (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2). p21-activated kinase 1, a downstream effector of Cdc42, coprecipitated with GST-Cdc42 loaded with GTPγS and not GDP, confirming the efficiency of GTPγS and GDP loading (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2). Similar results were obtained from either unstimulated or stimulated (3-min glucose) cell lysates (data not shown). In addition, GST alone failed to associate with VAMP2, indicating that the interaction between Cdc42 and VAMP2 was specific (Fig. 3, lane 3). Consistent with this, both the Cdc42-T17N (dominant negative mutation that confers predominantly GDP binding) and Cdc42-Q61L (constitutively active mutation that confers predominantly GTP binding) proteins co-immunoprecipitated with VAMP2 from MIN6 cell lysates prepared from T17N- or Q61L-expressing cells (data not shown). Thus, these data demonstrate that the interaction between Cdc42 and VAMP2 occurred independently of Cdc42 activation state and further suggested that Cdc42 could interact with VAMP2-bound insulin secretory granules in the intracellular storage pool(s) and at the plasma membrane. Cdc42 Interacts Directly with the N Terminus of VAMP2—To first determine whether the binding interaction between Cdc42 and VAMP2 was direct or indirect, recombinant Cdc42 and recombinant soluble VAMP2-(1–94) were combined in detergent lysis buffer (0.25% Nonidet P-40) and immunoprecipitated with either anti-VAMP2 antibody or an IgG control (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 2). The anti-VAMP2 antibody specifically immunoprecipitated Cdc42, while the IgG control failed to immunoprecipitate either protein. These data indicated that Cdc42 bound directly to VAMP2. It should be noted that, unlike endogenous VAMP2, the recombinant VAMP2 migrated as a doublet likely due to partial proteolysis during purification and thrombinmediated cleavage from GST. A recent study has demonstrated that Cdc42 interacts with Syntaxin 1A in the βHC9 line of pancreatic beta cells (26Daniel S. Noda M. Cerione R.A. Sharp G.W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9663-9671Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), although it was demonstrated that the interaction was not direct. However, since Syntaxin 1A does bind to VAMP2 directly (37Pevsner J. Hsu S-C. Braun J.E. Calakos N. Ting A.E. Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1994; 13: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), we investigated the possibility that interaction between Cdc42 and Syntaxin 1A could be mediated by VAMP2. To test this, we combined recombinant forms of Cdc42, soluble VAMP2-(1–94), and soluble Syntaxin 1A (ΔTM domain) in detergent lysis buffer for immunoprecipitation with anti-VAMP2 antibody or IgG control (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 4). Anti-VAMP2 co-immunoprecipitated VAMP2 plus both Cdc42 and Syntaxin"

Our previous results have suggested that low (subnanomolar) concentrations of orexin-A activate Ca2+ entry, whereas higher concentrations activate phospholipase C, Ca2+ release, and capacitative Ca2+ entry. As shown here, the Ca2+ response to subnanomolar orexin-A concentrations was blocked by activation of protein kinase C by using different approaches (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol acetate, dioctanoylglycerol, and diacylglycerol kinase inhibition) and protein phosphatase inhibition by calyculin A. The Ca2+ response to subnanomolar orexin-A concentrations was also blocked by Mg2+, dextromethorphan, and tetraethylammonium. These treatments neither affected the response to high concentrations of orexin-A nor the thapsigargin-stimulated capacitative entry. The capacitative entry was instead strongly suppressed by SKF96365. An inward membrane current activated by subnanomolar concentrations of orexin-A and the currents activated upon transient expression of trpc3 channels were also sensitive to Mg2+, dextromethorphan, and tetraethylammonium. Responses to subnanomolar concentrations of orexin-A (Ca2+ elevation, inward current, and membrane depolarization) were voltage-dependent with a loss of the response around –15 mV. By using reverse transcription-PCR, mRNA for the trpc1–4 channel isoforms were detected in the CHO-hOX1-C1 cells. The expression of truncated TRPC channel isoforms, in particular trpc1 and trpc3, reduced the response to subnanomolar concentrations of orexin-A but did not affect the response to higher concentrations of orexin-A. The results suggest that activation of the OX1 receptor leads to opening of a Ca2+-permeable channel, involving trpc1 and -3, which is controlled by protein kinase C. The orexins are peptide transmitters/hormones, which exert stimulatory actions in many types of cells via the G-protein-coupled OX1 and OX2 receptors.

An inward membrane current activated by subnanomolar concentrations of orexin-A and the currents activated upon transient expression of trpc3 channels were also sensitive to Mg2+, dextromethorphan, and tetraethylammonium. Responses to subnanomolar concentrations of orexin-A (Ca2+ elevation, inward current, and membrane depolarization) were voltage-dependent with a loss of the response around –15 mV. By using reverse transcription-PCR, mRNA for the trpc1–4 channel isoforms were detected in the CHO-hOX1-C1 cells. The expression of truncated TRPC channel isoforms, in particular trpc1 and trpc3, reduced the response to subnanomolar concentrations of orexin-A but did not affect the response to higher concentrations of orexin-A. The results suggest that activation of the OX1 receptor leads to opening of a Ca2+-permeable channel, involving trpc1 and -3, which is controlled by protein kinase C. Orexins act via two G-protein-coupled receptors called OX1R and OX2R (1Sakurai T. Amemiya A. Ishii M. Matsuzaki I. Chemelli R.M. Tanaka H. Williams S.C. Richardson J.A. Kozlowski G.P. Wilson S.

The most typical responses to orexins in neurons include increased excitability, membrane depolarization (5–10 mV), and Ca2+ elevation (3Kukkonen J.P. Holmqvist T. Ammoun S. Akerman K.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C1567-C1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 4Ferguson A.V. Samson W.K. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 2003; 24: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Evidence for several different mechanisms have been proposed to explain these responses, including activation of a nonselective cation current, a decrease in K+ conductance, and activation of Na+/Ca2+ exchange. The orexin-stimulated Ca2+ elevation in neurons shows an explicit dependence on extracellular Ca2+ and is therefore likely to be due to Ca2+ entry into cells (5van den Pol. A.N. Gao X.B. Obrietan K.

High concentrations (>10 nm) of orexins induce intracellular Ca2+ release (9Lund P.E. Shariatmadari R. Uustare A. Detheux M. Parmentier M. Kukkonen J.P. Akerman K.E. J. Biol.

Parmentier M. Kukkonen J.P. Akerman K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30806-30812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Similar results are observed upon recombinant expression of orexin receptors in neuron-like excitable cells (PC12 and Neuro2A). Activation of a novel Ca2+ influx pathway was thus suggested. The existence of such a pathway is also indirectly suggested by the dependence of the Ca2+ response on a negative internal membrane potential and the activation of a robust influx of Mn2+ ions in the absence of store discharge (9Lund P.E. Shariatmadari R. Uustare A. Detheux M. Parmentier M. Kukkonen J.P. Akerman K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30806-30812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The identity of this Ca2+ influx pathway and the mechanisms involved in its activation remain unresolved. Because the orexin-stimulated [Ca2+]e-dependent Ca2+ elevation is relatively insensitive to blockers of capacitative Ca2+ entry, such as lanthanides and 2-APB, but blocked by Ni2+, a different molecular entity was proposed (10Holmqvist T. Akerman K.E. Kukkonen J.P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 526: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Several different pathways for receptor-activated Ca2+ entry have also been suggested based on functional studies with other receptors. These include store-operated Ca2+ channels and second messenger-operated channels as well as Ca2+-activated Ca2+ channels (reviewed in Ref. 12Barritt G.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 153-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). A large family of potential receptor-activated channels called transient receptor potential channels (TRP channels) has been identified (reviewed in Refs. 13Minke B. Cook B. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 429-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 14Zitt C. Halaszovich C.R. Luckhoff A. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 243-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 15Clapham D.E. Nature. 2003; 426: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (2081) Google Scholar). When recombinantly expressed, the different TRP channel subtypes produce currents that are, to various extents, dependent on extracellular Ca2+ and Na+. The mechanism by which receptors couple to activate these channels has not been clarified, but recombinantly expressed TRP channels have been shown to modify receptor-activated Ca2+ influx, and it has thus been suggested that they represent the molecular entities of receptor-activated pathways (13Minke B. Cook B. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 429-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). It has been shown by using single cell RT-PCR that both orexin receptors are co-expressed with several members of the TRPC channel family in e.g. rat aminergic neurons, but the expression profile varies significantly between different cells (16Sergeeva O.A. Korotkova T.M. Scherer A. Brown R.E. Haas H.L. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 1547-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Some TRP channel subtypes are regulated by lipid products such as diacylglycerol, i.e. exogenously applied diacylglycerol analogs activate trpc3 (17Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar, 18Tesfai Y. Brereton H.M. Barritt G.J. Biochem.

J. 2002; 364: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), although endogenously produced diacylglycerol appears to suppress the activation of some of these channels through a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent mechanisms (21Venkatachalam K. Zheng F. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29031-29040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 22Trebak M. Vazquez G. Bird G.S. Putney J.W.

Calyculin A, a protein phosphatase inhibitor, strongly suppresses the activity of TRP and TRPL channels in Drosophila (23Agam K. Frechter S. Minke B. Cell Calcium. 2004; 35: 87-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and causes internalization of trpc1, -3, and -4 in human neutrophils and overexpressed trpc3 in HEK293 (24Itagaki K.

The TRP channels are widely distributed in different cells and the subtypes appear to represent subunits of larger channel complexes (26Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 28: 7461-7466Crossref Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 27Strubing C. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39014-39019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Interaction of expressed channels with endogenous channel complexes and constitutive activation further complicates the assessment of the functional properties of individual TRP channels (13Minke B. Cook B. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 429-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 14Zitt C. Halaszovich C.R. Luckhoff A. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 243-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), whereas the identification of the specific function of endogenous TRP channels has, especially in neurons and endocrine cells, been hampered by the lack of specific pharmacological blockers. The goal of this study was to investigate whether the primary orexin-A-activated Ca2+ entry (mediated by OX1 receptor) involves TRPC channels using the CHO-hOX1-C1 cell line as an experimental system. Because excitable and nonexcitable cells express the same G-proteins and TRP channel subtypes (with the exception of TRPC5), their basic signaling mechanisms are expected to be the same or quite similar. A panel of channel blockers was used to distinguish the orexin-activated Ca2+ influx from store-operated influx, and patch clamp recordings were used to define the properties of the pathway. TRPC channel mRNA profiling was used to determine the best targets for interference with the function of the endogenous TRPC channel by using transient expression of truncated TRPC constructs and thus to assess their involvement in the orexin-stimulated Ca2+ entry. In addition the regulation of the orexin-activated pathway by PKC was tested by using PKC activation and inhibition. The generation of CHO-hOX1-C1 cells stably expressing the human OX1R, has been described earlier (9Lund P.E. Shariatmadari R. Uustare A. Detheux M. Parmentier M. Kukkonen J.P. Akerman K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30806-30812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Nutrient Mixture (Ham's F-12) medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin G (Sigma), 80 units/ml streptomycin (Sigma), 400 μg/ml geneticin (G418; Invitrogen), and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in an air-ventilated humidified incubator in 260-ml culture flasks (Nunc A/S, Roskilde, Denmark). For Ca2+ measurements in suspension, the cells were grown in 800-ml culture flasks (Nunc) in order to obtain a larger quantity of cells. Materials—2-Aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), GF109203X (bisindolylmaleimide), R59022 (diacylglycerol kinase inhibitor), and SKF96365 (1-[β-(3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propoxy)-4-methoxyphenethyl]-1H-imidazole-hydrochloride) were from Calbiochem. BzATP (2′,3′-O-(4-benzoyl-benzoyl)-ATP), calyculin A, dextromethorphan, dioctanoyl glycerol (DOG), 1,2-dicapryloyl-sn-glycerol, EDTA, EGTA, probenecid (p-[dipropylsulfamoyl]benzoic acid), ATP (Mg2+ salt), and GTP (Na+ salt), NiCl2, TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate), and TEA (tetraethylammonium) were from Sigma. Digitonin was from Merck. Fura-2-acetoxymethyl ester and fura-2-penta-potassium salt were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Thapsigargin was from RBI (Natick, MA). Human orexin-A was from Peninsula Laboratories Europe Ltd. (St. Helens, UK). Media—The HEPES-buffered Na+ medium (HBM) consisted of the following (in mm): 137 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 0.44 KH2PO4, 4.2 NaHCO3, 10 glucose, 1 probenecid, 20 HEPES, and 1.2 MgCl2; and the pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. TEA was used by replacing the Na+ in HBM. The desired TEA concentration was prepared by mixing the TEA-based HBM with Na+-based HBM. In HBM prepared for electrophysiology, unless otherwise specified, MgCl2 was in general excluded. The intracellular electrode solution used in the whole-cell voltage clamp recordings consisted of the following (in mm): 136 Cs+ aspartate, 30 HEPES, 10 NaCl, 4 ATP, and 0.6 GTP. In current clamp recordings a similar intracellular solution was used but with 136 K+ aspartate. The [Ca2+] in the intracellular electrode solution was optically measured with fura-2-pentapotassium salt and calibrated to ∼140 nm by addition of 50 μm EGTA and 25 μm fura-2. The effect of a high intracellular Ca2+ buffer capacity was tested in some experiments by increasing the concentrations of EGTA and Ca2+ to 4 and 1 mm, respectively, or 10 and 2.8 mm, respectively. Finally, the pH was set to 7.25 with CsOH or KOH. Ca2+ Measurements in Suspension—The fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fura-2 (28Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) was used to monitor changes in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) as described previously (9Lund P.E. Shariatmadari R. Uustare A. Detheux M. Parmentier M. Kukkonen J.P. Akerman K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30806-30812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were harvested using phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2 g/liter EDTA, spun down, and loaded at 37 °C in HBM, 1 mm probenecid, and 4 μm fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester for 20 min. The cells were washed once with Ca2+-free HBM and stored on ice as pellets (medium removed). The measurement of [Ca2+]i was carried out as follows: 1 pellet was resuspended in HBM at 37 °C and placed in a stirred quartz microcuvette in a thermostated cell-holder within a fluorescence spectrophotometer. Fluorescence was monitored with a PTI QuantaMaster fluorescence spectrophotometer at the wavelengths 340/360/380 (excitation) and 505 nm (emission). The experiments were calibrated by using 60 μg/ml digitonin, which gives the maximum value of fluorescence (Fmax), and 10 mm EGTA, which gives the minimum value of fluorescence (Fmin). Combined Patch Clamp and Ca2+ Imaging—Orexin-A-evoked Ca2+ currents were studied in voltage clamp mode at 28 °C by using the standard whole-cell configuration (29Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15066) Google Scholar) while concurrently monitoring the [Ca2+]i by fura-2 imaging. The [Ca2+]i in cells in the vicinity of the patched cell was monitored as controls. Cells were harvested from 260-ml cell flasks and replated on the day of use on 22 × 22-mm coverglasses (Warner Instruments Inc.) to a confluence of ∼50–70% and rested for a minimum of 3 h before use. Cells on a coverglass were loaded with 2 μm fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester and 1 mm probenecid for 20 min at 37 °C in HBM. The coverglass was then attached to the bottom of an RC-24 fast exchange chamber (Warner Instruments Inc.) and positioned on top of the microscope. Cells were perfused with HBM (2.5 ml/min giving an exchange time of ∼3 s) by a gravity-controlled drug delivery system. The perfusates were converging in a perfusion manifold and funneled through an SH-27B in-line heater (Warner Instruments Inc.) located just before the chamber inlet to obtain the desired temperature. Patch pipettes (model PG150T, Harvard Apparatus, UK) were prepared with a PC-10 puller and flame-polished with microforge MF-900 (Narishige, UK) to a resistance of 3.6–3.8 megohms measured in the bath solution. The patch clamp amplifier Axopatch 200A was connected to a computer via the AD/DA Digidata1320E SCSI interface (Axon Instruments). Voltage protocols and data acquisition were controlled with pClamp 8.1 (Axon Instruments). Cells were compensated for the pipette capacitance, whereas following whole-cell access the series resistance was analogically compensated to 60–70%. Liquid junction potential was calculated in pClamp 8.1 and subtracted from the recordings giving a more accurate clamping potential of –60 mV. In general, voltage ramps (–80 to +80 mV; 320 ms) were applied every 5 or 7.5 s. Data were digitally sampled at 3.8 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz by using the low pass Bessel filter on the recording amplifier. In current clamp experiments, data were digitally sampled at 5 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz. Combined fluorescence recordings were obtained with a second computer running the TILLvisION Multi-Color Ratio ImagingSystem (TILL Photonics GmbH, Gräfelfing, Germany), and saved for later analysis. The system consisted of a polychrome IV and a 12-bit IMAGO CCD camera under control of an external control unit. An inverted microscope (Nikon) was used to visualize the fluorescence. UV light was guided through an epifluorescence condenser, and cells were excited through a dichroic mirror (DM430, Nikon). The emission was measured through a 510 nm cut-off filter (Nikon). The imaging protocol was designed to acquire images at 340 and 380 nm every 1–3 s. A TTL trigger pulse synchronized the patch clamp and imaging recordings; the TTL pulse was controlled by TILLvisION 4.0 to trigger the voltage clamp data acquisition by using the “digitizer start input” option in the pClamp 8.1. After ending the recordings, fluorescence from 340 and 380 nm of selected regions of interest were analyzed and converted into [Ca2+]i as described previously (9Lund P.E. Shariatmadari R. Uustare A.

Voltage clamp and image data were then combined in Microcal Origin™ 6.0 for visualization and final analysis. Identification of TRP Channel mRNA—For primer design, nucleotide sequences, retrieved from the GenBank™ data base, were aligned with MacMolly Tetra (version 3.10, align ppc program, Soft Gene GmbH). 0.5 μg of total RNA were reverse-transcribed using SuperscriptII cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) and then amplified by using general trpc-specific degenerate primers 5′-nggvmchytgcagathtc-3′ and 5′-nckhgcaaayttccaytc-3′; the PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 5 min, 50 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and 94 °C for 30 s, 30 cycles. Amplified DNA was gel-purified and inserted into PgemTeasy plasmid (Promega) and sequenced. PCR product identification was done using Blast program (30Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58760) Google Scholar). For expression/comparison analysis, specific primers for each trpc mRNA subtype were designed and tested, PCR conditions were optimized (Table I). 1 or 0.5 μl (trpc1/trpc2) of the 20-μl cDNA reaction were amplified with channel-specific primers using optimized conditions. Identical amounts of PCRs were run on a 1.5% agarose TBE gel, stained with SYBRgreenI (Molecular Probes) according to manufacturer's instructions, and scanned on Storm 860 (Amersham Biosciences). Quantification of signal was done using ImageQuant program.Fig. 4Orexin A-activated Ca2+ elevation and membrane current: effects of extracellular Ca2+, Mg2+, dextromethorphan, and tetraethylammonium. The membrane potential was clamped in the whole-cell mode to –60 mV. Cs+-based intracellular solution was used. The currents in unchallenged conditions ranged from 9 to 22 pA. Scale bars indicate 25 pA and 25 s, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2021383335,"Abstract Homologous gene recombination is crucial for the repair of DNA. A superfamily of recombinases facilitate a central strand exchange reaction in the repair process. This reaction is initiated by coating single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with recombinases in the presence of ATP and Mg2+ co-factors to form helical nucleoprotein filaments with elevated ATPase and strand invasion activities (1). At the amino acid sequence level, archaeal RadA and Rad51 and eukaryal Rad51 and meiosis-specific DMC1 form a closely related group of recombinases distinct from bacterial RecA (2). Unlike the extensively studied Escherichia coli RecA (EcRecA), increasing evidences on yeast and human recombinases imply that their optimal activities are dependent on the presence of a monovalent cation, particularly potassium (3-5). Here we present the finding that archaeal RadA from Methanococcus voltae (MvRadA) is a stringent potassium-dependent ATPase, and the crystal structure of this protein in complex with the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog adenosine 5′-(β,γ-iminotriphosphate), Mg2+, and K+ at 2.4 A resolution. Potassium triggered an in situ conformational change in the ssDNA-binding L2 region concerted with incorporation of two potassium ions at the ATPase site in the RadA crystals preformed in K+-free medium. Both potassium ions were observed in contact with the γ-phosphate of the ATP analog, implying a direct role by the monovalent cations in stimulating the ATPase activity. Cross-talk between the ATPase site and the ssDNA-binding L2 region visualized in the MvRadA structure provides an explanation to the co-factor-induced allosteric effect on RecA-like recombinases."
https://openalex.org/W2151465611,"Artificial transcription factors can be engineered to interact with specific DNA sequences to modulate endogenous gene expression within cells. A significant hurdle to implementation of this approach is the selection of the appropriate DNA sequence for targeting. We reasoned that a good target site should be located in chromatin, where it is accessible to DNA-binding proteins, and it should be in the close vicinity of known transcriptional regulators of the gene. Here we have explored the efficacy of these criteria to guide our selection of potential regulators of γ-globin expression. Several zinc finger-based transcriptional activators were designed to target the sites proximal to the -117-position of the γ-globin promoter. This region is proximal to the binding sites of known and potential natural transcription factors. Design and study of three transcription factors identified the potent transcriptional activator, gg1-VP64-HA. This transcription factor was able to interact directly with the γ-globin promoter and up-regulate expression of reporter gene constructs as well as the endogenous gene in a selective manner. Transfection of a gg1-VP64-HA expression vector or retroviral delivery of this transcription factor into the erythroleukemia cell line K562 resulted in an increase of fetal hemoglobin. The γ-globin content of cells expressing gg1-vp64-HA showed up to 16-fold higher levels of fetal hemoglobin than the native K562 cell line. These transcriptional activators constitute a novel class of regulators of the globin locus that may be suitable for treatment of diseases arising from mutations in this locus such as sickle cell disease and thalassemic diseases.

These transcriptional activators constitute a novel class of regulators of the globin locus that may be suitable for treatment of diseases arising from mutations in this locus such as sickle cell disease and thalassemic diseases. The human β-globin locus is located on chromosome 11 and contains five homologous globin genes that are differentially expressed during development (Fig. 1). In the embryonic stage of development, the ϵ-gene is predominantly expressed. Its expression is replaced with γ-globin during the fetal stage; γ-globin forms tetrameric fetal hemoglobin (HbF), 1The abbreviations used are: HbF, fetal hemoglobin; DBD, DNA-binding domain; MBP, maltose-binding protein; TF, transcription factor; LCR, locus control region; HPFH, hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin; SCD, sickle cell disease; HA, hemagglutinin; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; KRAB, Krüppel-associated box; ICAM, intercellular adhesion molecule; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein. 1The abbreviations used are: HbF, fetal hemoglobin; DBD, DNA-binding domain; MBP, maltose-binding protein; TF, transcription factor; LCR, locus control region; HPFH, hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin; SCD, sickle cell disease; HA, hemagglutinin; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; KRAB, Krüppel-associated box; ICAM, intercellular adhesion molecule; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein. consisting of two γ- and two α-chains. Shortly after birth, the expression of γ-globin starts to decline, and it is gradually replaced by β-globin, which forms α2β2, the adult version of hemoglobin (HbA). Transcriptional control of these genes is mediated by silencers and enhancers both within and flanking the genes in the locus (1Kollias G. Wrighton N. Hurst J. Grosveld F.

Situated upstream of the genes is a locus control region (LCR) that is necessary for activation of the entire locus. The differential expression of the globin genes is thought to depend on physical competition of the genes for association with the LCR. This association is mediated by different transcription factors (6Wijgerde M. Grosveld F. Fraser P. Nature. 1995; 377: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 7Li Q. Peterson K.R. Fang X.

Several genetic diseases are associated with defective β-globin expression, the most common being β-thalassemias and sickle cell disease.Fig. 1A (top), the 80-kb β-globin locus located on chromosome 11.

The DBD is at the N terminus followed by VP64, and the HA tag is located at the C terminus.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A feature common to both sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia is that disease can be mitigated by the production of the fetal globin chain γ that can serve to form α2γ2 or fetal hemoglobin HbF. One example of such protection from disease is the benign condition known as `hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin' (HPFH), which is characterized by an increase in the level of fetal hemoglobin. Fetal hemoglobin is normally 1-2% of the globin level, but in HPFH it can be increased up to 20%. Patients that have both SCD and HPFH typically have minimal symptoms of disease (8Stamatoyannopoulos G. Grosveld F. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Majerus P. Perlmutter R. Varmus H.

Haematol. 1988; 69: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These observations have spurred studies to induce HbF expression for the treatment of SCD, and several potent compounds have been identified including hydroxyurea, butyrate, ribavirin, activin A, and 5-azacytidine (10Swank R.A. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Treatment with these compounds, however, produces a range of side effects. Another possible therapeutic intervention for patients suffering from SCD or thalassemia is to deliver globin genes directly (11Blouin M-J. Beauchemin H. Wright A. De Paepe M. Sorette M. Bleau A.-M.

Sadelain M. Nature. 2000; 406: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) or to impart continuous transcriptional activation of the endogenous HbF gene through gene therapy approaches. In contrast to treatment with blood transfusions or with compounds like hydroxyurea, these approaches would potentially allow for treatment of the diseases only once or rarely.In this study, we have investigated the use of artificial transcription factors as a means of inducing γ-globin expression. Phage-based selection and rational design have shown that Cys2-His2 zinc fingers can be adapted to bind a wide variety of DNA sequences (13Desjarlais J.R. Berg J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2000; 303: 489-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Typically, a zinc finger domain recognizes three base pairs of DNA, and recognition of all possible DNA triplets therefore requires an alphabet of 64 different domains. Many such specific DNA-binding domains are now available (16Segal D.J. Dreier B. Beerli R.R. Barbas C.F. II I Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2758-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 17Dreier B. Beerli R.R. Segal D.J. Flippin J.D. Barbas C.F. II I J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 303: 489-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In contrast to most transcription factors that rely on dimerization of protein domains for extending protein-DNA contacts to longer DNA sequences, or addresses, simple covalent linkage of tandem repeats of the zinc finger domain allow for the recognition of longer asymmetric sequences of DNA. Three to six domains are typically fused to yield a DNA-binding domain (DBD) recognizing 9-18 bases of DNA. These polydactyl zinc finger proteins typically target DNA sequences with high affinity and specificity. When fused to activation or repression domains, these proteins become potent regulators of the transcriptional activity of the target gene. One activation domain that has shown promise as a potent activator when fused to zinc finger protein is the VP64 domain. The VP64 domain consists of a tetrameric repeat of the minimal activation domain (amino acids 437-447) of the herpes simplex protein VP16 (19Seipel K. Georgiev O. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4961-4968Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar).Artificial transcription factors have been applied to regulate endogenous gene expression in a number of instances (20Beerli R.R.

Blancafort P. Barbas C.F. II I J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 635-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A significant obstacle to creating productive artificial transcription factors is the selection of the DNA site to be targeted. We reasoned that a good target site should be located in chromatin, where it is accessible to DNA-binding proteins and it should be in the close vicinity of known transcriptional regulators of the gene. There have been reports correlating the ability of designed three-finger proteins in regulating gene expression to the location of their target sites in accessible chromatin structures (26Zhang L. Spratt S.K. Liu Q. Johnstone B. Qi H. Raschke E.E. Jamieson A.C. Rebar E.J. Wolffe A.P. Case C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33850-33860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 27Liu P.Q. Rebar E.J. Zhang L. Liu Q. Jamieson A.C. Liang Y. Qi H. Li P.X. Chen B. Mendel M.C.

Accessible target sites may be located in the linker region between positioned nucleosomes and are sensitive to micrococcal nuclease digestion or are hypersensitive to DNase I. In the promoter region of the human γ-globin genes, no DNase I-hypersensitive sites have been found; nor have the positions of nucleosomes been determined. However, the promoter sequences required for the γ-globin expression have been studied extensively. These sequences may represent the binding sites for transcriptional regulators and thus are probably located in accessible chromatin regions. Therefore, we chose target sequences next to known cis-regulatory sites with our zinc finger proteins. Target sites immediately adjacent to the known cis-regulatory sites may be advantageous in gene regulation as well. It has become clear that in a gene regulation event, both transcriptional activation functions and repression functions are imposed on the promoter, and the regulatory outcome depends on the relative strengths of these opposing functions (28Mannervik M. Nibu Y. Zhang H. Levine M. Science. 1999; 284: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Closely positioned activators on the promoter often act synergistically to boost transcription. Therefore, by following these guidelines, it may be possible to effectively select target sites that are both accessible and supportive of synergism within activators.Here we have studied the potential of these design selection criteria for the development of artificial transcription factors for the targeted up-regulation of γ-globin expression. We have analyzed the ability of our designed transcription factors to activate transcription of reporter constructs and the endogenous γ-globin gene in the human erythroleukemia cell line K562.MATERIALS AND METHODSAssembly of the DNA-binding Domains and Construction of Expression Vectors for the Transcription Factors—Recognition helices for fingers recognizing 5′-GNN-3′ or 5′-ANN-3′ triplets of DNA have been reported (16Segal D.J.

Assembly of DBDs, each consisting of six zinc finger domains fused head-to-tail, were performed as previously described (17Dreier B. Beerli R.R. Segal D.J. Flippin J.D. Barbas C.F. II I J. Biol.

The DBDs were subsequently subcloned into pcDNA3-VP64-HA, as described elsewhere (29Beerli R.R. Segal D.J. Dreier B. Barbas C.F. II I Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14628-14633Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), using the two SfiI restriction sites. The resulting plasmids each express a fusion protein with an N-terminal DBD followed by the transcriptional activator domain VP64 and a C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) decapeptide tag.Expression, Purification, and DNA Binding Characterization of the DBD—The DBD were expressed as maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion proteins from the pMAL-CSS constructs. The proteins could be purified to >90% purity using the Protein and Fusion purification system (New England Biolabs) as per the manufacturer's protocol, except that the running buffer in the column purification was zinc buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 90 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 90 μm ZnCl2) supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin and 5 mm dithiothreitol. Protein purity was analyzed by separating eluted proteins on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay and was compared with a bovine serum albumin standard. The dissociation constant for the DBD and its target sequence was determined using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) essentially as described (31Laniel M.A. Beliveau A. Guerin S.L. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 148: 13-30PubMed Google Scholar).Construction of a Dual Luciferase Reporter Plasmid—The γβ-2luc plasmid was constructed by fusing the γ- and β-globin promoters to the firefly and Renilla luciferase genes, respectively. Others have reported a similar reporter vector (32Skarpidi E. Vassilopoulos G. Li Q. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Blood. 2000; 96: 321-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Firefly luciferase was isolated from the pGL3-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI) by digestion with HindIII and SalI. It was inserted into pRL-null (Promega) that had been cut with the same enzymes, resulting in the plasmid p-2luc. The β-globin promoter from position -206 to +47 relative to the start of transcription was PCR-amplified using the primers β-3b (5′-GAACTGCAGTCTGTTTGAGGTTGCTAGTGAACACAG-3′) and β-5f (5′-GGAATTCAAGAGATATATCTTAGAGGGAGGGCTG-3′). The resulting PCR product and the vector p-2luc were cut with EcoRI and PstI and ligated to give the vector βR-2luc. The γ-globin promoter from position -206 to +47 relative to the start of transcription was PCR-amplified using the primers γ-3b (5′-CCCAAGCTTGGACTAGGAGCTTATTGATAATCTCAG-3′) and γ-5f (5′-TCACCGCGGGCCCCTTCCCCACACTATCTCAATG-3′) and was cut with SacII and HindIII. The DNase I-hypersensitive sites 2 and 3 (LCRHS3 and LCRHS2) comprise bases 8489-8865 and 4425-4823 of the human β-globin locus. LCRHS2 was PCR-amplified using LCRHS2-3b (5′-TCCCCGCGGCTAGAATATGTCACATTCTGTCTCAGG-3′) and LCRHS2-5f (5′-GAGGGTACCGCTTCAGTTTTTCCTTAGTTCCTGTTAC-3′), and was cut using KpnI and SacII. LCRHS3 was PCR-amplified using LCRHS3-3b (5′-CGGGGTACCCTGGGGGTATAGGGGAGCAGTCCCATG-3′) and LCRHS3-5f (5′-CCGCTCGAGCTGTGGATAAAGGAGACAGCCATGAAG-3′) and was cut using XhoI and KpnI. The vector βR-2luc was cut using XhoI and HindIII. Cut fragments corresponding to βR-2luc, LCRHS2, LCRHS3, and γ-globin promoter were ligated, resulting in the vector γβ-2Luc.Cell Lines—All cell culture experiments were performed using the erythroleukemia cell line K562 (ATCC number CCL-243). Cells were maintained at a density of <4 × 105/ml in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 1% antibiotic antimycotic mixture (Invitrogen). Transfection of DNA constructs to the cells was mediated by PLUS Reagent and Lipofectamine™ (Invitrogen).Analysis of the Transcription Factors (TFs) Using a Reporter Assay— For each sample, different amounts of the pcDNA-DBD-VP64-HA construct (2-50 ng) was mixed with 50 ng of the reporter plasmid γβ-2luc and 50 ng of the CMV-LacZ reporter plasmid. The amount of plasmid in each sample was adjusted to a total of 150 ng by the addition of the starting pcDNA3.1 plasmid. Each sample was then transfected into 50 × 103 K562 cells in a 96-well plate format. As a control, hemin (Sigma) was used in different concentrations to treat K562 cells that had been transfected with 50 ng of γβ-2luc and 50 ng of CMV-LacZ. Extracts from cells transfected with TFs were prepared ∼72 h post-transfection, and extracts from cells treated with hemin were prepared ∼96 h post-transfection. Growth medium was changed on hemin treated cells 48 and 72 h after transfection. The cell lysates were analyzed for their content of firefly and Renilla luciferase by the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). The cell lysates were also analyzed for their content of β-galactosidase using the Galacto-Light Plus™ reporter system (Tropix, Bedford, MA). The luciferase values could subsequently be normalized to the β-galactosidase activity.Theoretical Analysis of gg1 Specificity—The programs used for the theoretical analysis of the β-globin locus were BLASTN with the option, `Search for short, nearly exact matches' (available on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) and Fuzznuc, written by Alan Bleasby (available on the World Wide Web at www.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk/Software/EMBOSS/Apps/fuzznuc.html).Regulation of Endogenous γ-Globin Expression—K562 cells (1.2 × 107) were co-transfected with 12 μg of pcDNA-gg1-VP64-HA or 12 μg of pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) and 3 μg of pLEGFP (BD Biosciences) and grown for 72 h with one exchange of growth medium after 48 h. The cells were subsequently sorted in a FACSvantage DiVa (BD Biosciences), and 10% of the cells with the highest enhanced green fluorescent protein signal were collected and analyzed by Western blotting. Retroviral expression of gg1 transcription factors was accomplished by subcloning gg1 into pMX-effector vectors. Virus was prepared and delivered as described (20Beerli R.R. Dreier B. Barbas C.F.

Biol. 2004; 341: 635-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Selection of cell lines with stable expression of gg1-VP64-HA was performed by growing cells transfected with pcDNA-gg1-VP64-HA for 5 days, after which Geneticin G418 (Invitrogen) was added to a concentration of 250 μg/ml. Cells were maintained for an additional 14 days, after which individual surviving cells were allowed to expand in the presence of 250 μg/ml Geneticin, and the resulting clonal populations were analyzed.Analysis of HbF Content by Western Blotting—Samples were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Cells were incubated on ice for 20 min followed by freezing at -80 °C. Cells were thawed on ice, and solid material was removed by centrifugation. Cell lysate containing 10 μg of protein was separated on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by blotting to a nitrocellulose filter. The filter was probed with a mouse monoclonal anti-HbF antibody (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) at 0.5 μg/ml in Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20. The filters were developed using the ECL+plus kit (Amersham Biosciences).DNase I Footprinting—For DNase I footprinting, 100 pmol of the oligonucleotide fp-1 (5′-TGTCTGAAACGGTCCCTGGCTAA-3′) was end-labeled with 32P by incubation with 1 μl[γ-32P]ATP (8000 Ci/mmol) and 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche Applied Science) in T4 polynucleotide kinase buffer for 60 min at 37 °C. Fp-1 was subsequently used with the oligonucleotide fp-2 (5′-ACTGCTGAAGGGTGCTTCCTT-3′) in a PCR. The PCR mixture was separated on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, and the band corresponding to the 180-bp fragment encompassing the gg1-binding site was recovered. For each footprinting reaction, the following was mixed: ∼1 ng of 32P-labeled PCR product and from 100 nm to 1 pm MBP-gg1 in 390 μl of zinc buffer A supplemented with 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. The reactions were equilibrated overnight at 4 °C and then digested with DNase I. The digested samples were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 8.3 m urea, 88 mm Tris borate (pH 8.3), and 2 mm EDTA. The gel was developed using a phosphor imager screen and subsequently visualized in a Molecular Dynamics SF phosphor imager.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP assays were performed as described with the following modifications (25Magnenat L. Blancafort P. Barbas C.F. II I J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 635-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 33Boyd K.E. Wells J. Gutman J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13887-13892Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Nuclei from a minimum of 107 cells/immunoprecipitation were cross-linked, isolated, and sonicated to produce 500-bp chromatin fragments. TFZF-chromatin complexes were captured by centrifugation using 10 μl of ZF antibody or no antibody and lyophilized StaphA cells (Calbio-chem), washed extensively and analyzed by PCR for 35 cycles using the forward 5′-GACTGAATCGGAACAAGGCAAAG-3′ and reverse 5′-TGTCCTCCTCTGTGAAATGACCC-3′ primers producing a 338-bp PCR fragment containing the gg1 target site in the human γ-globin gene locus. As negative control, PCR primers amplifying the ICAM-1 promoter were used as described (25Magnenat L. Blancafort P. Barbas C.F. II I J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 635-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).Analysis of HbF Content by Flow Cytometry—Samples of ∼5 × 105 cells were collected and washed with 100 μl PBS supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (PBS-B). Cells were fixed by incubation for 10 min in 0.05% glutaraldehyde (Sigma) in PBS-B followed by washing with PBS-B. After fixation, cells were permeabilized by incubation with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS-B for 3 min followed by washing with PBS-B. Samples were stained by incubation with R-phycoerythrin-conjugated mouse monoclonal antibody against fetal hemoglobin (PE-HbF) (Caltag Laboratories) for 45 min at a working concentration of 2.5 μg/ml in PBS-B followed by washing with PBS-B. Cells stained for HbF content were analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScalibur instrument (BD Biosciences).Analysis of mRNA Levels of gg1-VP64 Using RT-PCR and Real Time PCR—Samples containing 106 cells were collected followed by RNA extraction using the TriReagent kit (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH). After the last precipitation step, the pellet containing pure RNA was resuspended in 150 μl of water and frozen at -80 °C until analyzed. For RT-PCR analysis of gg1-VP64-HA, 2.5 μg of RNA was annealed with an oligo(dT) primer and then reverse transcribed with the Superscript kit (Invitrogen). For each RT-PCR analysis, 5% of the synthesized cDNA was used as a template in a nested PCR. The first PCR was with the outer primers TF-1 (5′-ACTGCCGCGACCTTGCT-3′) and TF-2 (5′-CGGAACGTCGTACGGGTAGTT-3′) using the following program: denaturation (94 °C, 30 s) followed by 25 cycles of amplification (94 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 60 s) and ending with a final extension step (72 °C, 7 min). 1 μl of the outer PCR was used as a template for the inner PCR with the primers TF-3 (5′-TTCTCCCGCAGCGATCAC-3′) and TF-4 (5′-CCAAAGCACCTGGGTCTGA-3′). The PCR program for the inner PCR was the same as for the outer, except that the 72 °C extension step in each amplification cycle was for 30 s instead of 60 s. RT-PCR of GADPH was performed using gadph-f (5′-CCATGTTCGTCATGGGTGTGA-3′) and gadph-r (5′-CATGGACTGTGGTCATGAGT-3′). The PCR program used was the same as the inner PCR of gg1-VP64-HA.The amount of γ-globin was quantified by a real time PCR analysis of the synthesized cDNA. The analysis was carried out on an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocols, using SYBR Green dye for detection of synthesized amplicons. The primers used for γ-globin were ggrt-f (5′-GACAAGCTGCATGTGGATCCT-3′) and ggrt-r (5′-CCGAAATGGATTGCCAAAAC-3′). This primer pair gave an amplicon that extended over the splice junction between exon 2 and exon 3. The primers used for GADPH were gadph-f and gadph-r. All values for the γ-globin mRNA were normalized against the amount of GADPH mRNA.Immunocytochemical Cellular Localization of gg1-VP64-HA and HbF—Cells were seeded on poly-l-lysine-coated Lab-Tek cover glasses and incubated for 30 min. Cells were washed with copious amounts of PBS, incubated with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed again, and incubated in a humidifying chamber at room temperature for 1 h with primary antibody mixture of biotinylated rat anti-HA monoclonal antibody (5 μg/ml) (Roche Applied Science) and mouse anti-human HbF monoclonal antibody (Caltag Labo"

It could also be involved in the differential association of the human major histocompatibility subtypes HLA-B*2705 and HLA-B*2709 with ankylosing spondylitis. These two subtypes differ only in residue 116 of the heavy chain (Asp in B*2705 and His in B*2709), but the reason for the differential disease association is not understood. Using x-ray crystallography, we show here that the viral peptide pLMP2 (RRRWRRLTV, derived from latent membrane protein 2 (residues 236–244) of Epstein-Barr virus) is presented by the B*2705 and B*2709 molecules in two drastically deviating conformations. Extensive structural similarity between pLMP2 and the self-peptide pVIPR (RRKWRRWHL, derived from vasoactive intestinal peptide type 1 receptor (residues 400–408)) is observed only when the peptides are presented by B*2705 because of a salt bridge between Arg5 of both peptides and the subtype-specific heavy chain residue Asp116. Combined with functional studies using pLMP2/pVIPR-cross-reactive cytotoxic T cell lines and clones, together with target cells presenting these peptides or a modified peptide analogue, our results reveal that a pathogen-derived peptide can exhibit major histocompatibility complex class I subtype-dependent, drastically distinct binding modes. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that molecular mimicry between pLMP2 and pVIPR in the HLA-B27 context is an allele-dependent property.

Furthermore, the results demonstrate that molecular mimicry between pLMP2 and pVIPR in the HLA-B27 context is an allele-dependent property. Not all HLA-B27 subtypes are equally associated with the autoimmune disease ankylosing spondylitis (AS). 1The abbreviations used are: AS, ankylosing spondylitis; EBV, Epstein-Barr virus; HLA, human leukocyte antigen; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; HC, heavy chain; CTL, cytotoxic T lymphocyte(s); HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; TCR, T cell receptor.1The abbreviations used are: AS, ankylosing spondylitis; EBV, Epstein-Barr virus; HLA, human leukocyte antigen; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; HC, heavy chain; CTL, cytotoxic T lymphocyte(s); HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; TCR, T cell receptor. The frequent, prototypical subtype B*2705 is AS-associated, independent of ethnic origin, whereas B*2706 and B*2709, which exhibit geographically restricted distribution, are not (1Ramos M. López de Castro J.A. Tissue Antigens. 2002; 60: 191-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The products of the B*2705 and B*2709 alleles differ only in residue 116 of the HLA-B27 heavy chain (HC; Asp in B*2705 and His in B*2709) (2D'Amato M. Fiorillo M.T. Carcassi C. Mathieu A. Zuccarelli A. Bitti P.P. Tosi R. Sorrentino R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3199-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This residue is located at the floor of the peptide-binding groove, forms part of the F-pocket, and is buried upon binding of a peptide. Despite the close structural similarities, the subtypes give rise to distinct repertoires of bound peptides (3Ramos M. Paradela A. Vazquez M. Marina A. Vazquez J. López de Castro J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28749-28756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) (4Fiorillo M.T. Maragno M. Butler R. Dupuis M.L. Sorrentino R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). B*2705-positive but not B*2709-positive individuals possess CTL that recognize the HLA-B27-bound self-peptide pVIPR (RRK-WRRWHL). pVIPR is derived from vasoactive intestinal peptide type 1 receptor (residues 400–408) and is presented by B*2709 molecules in the common canonical conformation, whereas B*2705 presents the peptide in an unusual dual binding mode (5Hülsmeyer M.

Med. 2004; 199: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). pVIPR exhibits sequence homology with the peptide pLMP2 (RRRWRRLTV), derived from latent membrane protein 2 (residues 236–244) of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The existence of CTL reacting with both peptides in the context of B*2705 suggests a relationship between infection with EBV and an expansion of the pool of pLMP2/pVIPR-cross-reactive CTL (4Fiorillo M.T. Maragno M. Butler R. Dupuis M.L. Sorrentino R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar).

A principal difficulty is related to the fact that a host-derived epitope is expected to share antigenic but not necessarily also extensive sequence homology with a foreign antigen (15Wucherpfennig K.W. Strominger J.L. Cell. 1995; 80: 695-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). We have now determined the structures of both HLA-B27 subtypes in complex with pLMP2 and compare them here with the corresponding pVIPR complexes. Together with functional data, this comparison suggests that structural similarity and CTL cross-reactivity between pLMP2 and pVIPR in the context of HLA-B27 antigens are allele-dependent properties. HLA-B27-positive Donors, CTL Lines, and Clones—Seven patients with AS (with the exception of one B*2702-positive individual, all typed as B*2705) and two healthy individuals (one B*2705-positive and one B*2709-positive) were enrolled for this study (see Tables III, IV, and V). HLA-B27 typing and generation of pLMP2- and pVIPR-specific CTL lines were carried out as described (4Fiorillo M.T. Maragno M. Butler R. Dupuis M.L. Sorrentino R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The CTL line MP VPAC7 was cloned by limiting dilution at 0.5–1 cell/well in 96-well U-bottom microplates in the presence of phytohemagglutinin (0.5 μg/ml), 3 × 104 allogeneic γ-irradiated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and 20 units/ml recombinant interleukin-2 (Roche Applied Science). After 12 days, the growing cells were restimulated with pVIPR-pulsed, γ-irradiated autologous B-LCL and further expanded in the presence of recombinant interleukin-2 (20–50 units/ml).Fig. 1pLMP2 topographies, electron densities, and B factors when bound to B*2705 and B*2709. a and b, conformation of pLMP2 in B*2705 and B*2709, viewed from the side of the α2-helix together with a ribbon representation of the α1-helix and the floor (β-sheet) of the binding groove.

Target cells (B*2705 or B*2709 T2 transfectants) were incubated overnight with the pLMP2 or pVIPR peptides at 70 μm or at lower concentrations (see “Results” and Fig. 4 for details) or in medium alone. One day later, the cells were labeled with sodium chromate and extensively washed before being mixed with effector T cells at 3 × 103 target cells/well. Analysis of TCR Gene Usage—Total RNA was extracted from 2 × 105 T cells, and cDNA was synthesized using oligo(dT) primer and SuperScript™ II RNase H- Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the analysis of TCR α chain usage, cDNA was amplified using primers and PCR conditions as already described (16Lombardi G. Germain C. Uren J. du Fiorillo M.T. Bois R.M. Jones-Williams W.

Additional oligonucleotides for Vα families 18–29 were designed as detailed previously (17Kalams S.A. Johnson R.P. Trocha A.K. Dynan M.J. Ngo H.S. D'Aquila R.T. Kurnick J.T. Walker B.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). PCR products were loaded on a 1.5% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. Specific DNA bands were cut from the gel and purified using a gel band purification kit (Amersham Biosciences). Direct sequencing was performed using an internal primer upstream of the TCR Cα reverse primer. Protein Preparation and Structure Determination—The peptide pLMP2 was purified by high pressure liquid chromatography (Alta Bioscience), and HLA-B27·peptide complexes were produced as described (5Hülsmeyer M.

Purified complexes (15–20 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% sodium azide, pH 7.5) were used for crystallization using hanging drop vapor diffusion and streak-seeding. Crystals suitable for x-ray diffraction experiments were grown in drops made of 1.5 μl of protein solution and 1.5 μl of precipitant solution (for B*2705, 15% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and for B*2709, 21% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.5). Using glycerol as cryoprotectant, data sets were obtained from cryo-cooled (100 K) crystals at the BL2 beam line of BESSY-II.

As the two HLA-B27·pLMP2 complexes crystallized isomorphously, initial phases for B*2705·pLMP2 were calculated from peptide-stripped B*2709·pLMP2 with His116 replaced by alanine. This initial model was subjected to rigid body refinement, simulated annealing, and energy minimization using CNS, improved by manual intervention using O and water molecule inclusion as described for the B*2709-data processing. Because of the higher resolution of B*2705·pLMP2, restrained maximum-likelihood refinement (Refmac) included anisotropic B-factor refinement.

Structural Features of pLMP2 in Complex with HLA-B27 Subtypes—The B*2705·pLMP2 and B*2709·pLMP2 complexes crystallized isomorphously in space group P21 (Table I). Both show the typical MHC class I topography (31Madden D.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 587-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, a–c) and were refined at high resolution: 1.55 Å for B*2705·pLMP2 and 1.72 Å for B*2709·pLMP2. The HLA-B27 HC and β2-microglobulin are highly similar in the two subtypes (except for the D116H exchange) with a Cα root mean square deviation of only 0.2 Å. For each complex, the peptide could be modeled unambiguously to the electron density (Fig. 1, d and e). When complexed to B*2709, pLMP2 is bound in the conventional p4α conformation (main chain φ/Ψ torsion angles in α-helical conformation at p4), with the solvent-exposed pArg5 side chain pointing away from the binding groove (Fig. 1b) (5Hülsmeyer M. Fiorillo M.T. Bettosini F. Sorrentino R. Saenger W. Ziegler A. Uchanska-Ziegler B. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In contrast, pLMP2 displays the drastically different p6α conformation (main chain φ/Ψ torsion angles in α-helical conformation at p6) when bound to B*2705 (Fig. 1a), with the side chain of pArg5 pointing toward the interior of the binding groove, where it forms a salt bridge with HC Asp116 (5Hülsmeyer M. Fiorillo M.T. Bettosini F. Sorrentino R. Saenger W. Ziegler A. Uchanska-Ziegler B. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These subtype-dependent pArg5 orientations force the middle portion (residues p4–p7) of the peptide backbones and the corresponding amino acid side chains into grossly different conformations in the two subtypes (Fig. 1c). Because these regions of the two complexes do not participate in extensive crystal contacts, the observed conformational differences must be a direct consequence of the D116H polymorphism. The N-terminal pLMP2 residues pArg1, pArg2, and pArg3 occupy identical positions in both subtypes (Fig. 1c and Table II). Both subtypes exhibit also closely related interactions between HC atoms and C-terminal peptide residues pThr8 and pVal9. In B*2709, however, p8 and p9 are located slightly deeper in the binding groove than in B*2705 (Fig. 1, a–c), possibly as a consequence of altered p4–p7 conformations. To account for these changes, the binding groove residues in contact with pThr8 and pVal9 (Table II) exhibit small side chain variations.Table IIComparison of pLMP2 peptide coordination in the B*2705 and B*2709 subtypesa Intrapeptide contactb Helix α1c β–Sheet floord Helix α2 a Intrapeptide contact b Helix α1 c β–Sheet floor d Helix α2 pTrp4 is the first pLMP2 residue with substantially different positioning in the two subtypes (Fig. 1, a–e, and Table II). In p4α conformation found in complex with B*2709, the pTrp4, pArg5, and pArg6 side chains are fully solvent-exposed, with few HC contacts, whereas pLeu7 projects into the E-pocket (Fig. 1, b, c, and e, and Table II). A very different situation is found in the p6α conformation seen in B*2705 (Fig. 1, a, c, and d). Here, the pTrp4 side chain is packed against the α1-helix, and pArg5 forms a salt bridge with Asp116 that leads to deeper insertion of the middle section of the peptide into the binding groove (Fig. 1a and Table II). At pArg6, the peptide backbone bends upward (associated with the p6α conformation), so that the side chain can engage in van der Waals' contact with pTrp4 (Table II). Finally, pLeu7 is solvent-exposed in B*2705, and its side chain exhibits the highest flexibility of all pLMP2 residues in either conformation as shown by temperature (B) factors (Fig. 1, f and g, and Table I). A comparison of the B factors of the peptide reveals that pLMP2 is more flexibly bound in B*2705 despite the anchoring of its middle through the pArg5-Asp116 interaction. This differential peptide flexibility is most likely a consequence of a network of solvent molecules that is tighter in B*2709 than in B*2705, where the hydrophobic section of the pArg5 side chain prevents its formation. Structural Comparison of pLMP2 and pVIPR in Complexes with B*2705 and B*2709—The four complexes of B*2705 and B*2709 with pLMP2 and pVIPR, respectively, crystallized isomorphously (Ref. 5Hülsmeyer M. Fiorillo M.T. Bettosini F. Sorrentino R. Saenger W. Ziegler A. Uchanska-Ziegler B. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar and Table I), indicating that the same crystallographic restraints (intermolecular interactions associated with crystal packing) apply to all of them. Comparison of pVIPR complexed with B*2705 and with B*2709 has already been carried out, with the dual p4α/p6α conformation found in B*2705 but not in B*2709, where only p4α occurs (5Hülsmeyer M. Fiorillo M.T. Bettosini F. Sorrentino R. Saenger W. Ziegler A. Uchanska-Ziegler B. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Therefore, if molecular mimicry were to play a role in the context of the pLMP2/pVIPR structures, as suggested by CTL cross-reactivity (4Fiorillo M.T. Maragno M. Butler R. Dupuis M.L. Sorrentino R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), a comparison of side chain orientations (Fig. 2) and surface properties (Fig. 3) between the two pLMP2 complexes and the two pVIPR complexes should provide a structure-based explanation. The structures of the two peptides in B*2705 immediately reveal that pLMP2 (Fig. 3a) is much more similar to pVIPR-p6α (Cα root mean square deviation of 0.3 Å; Fig. 3c) than to pVIPR-p4α (Cα root mean square deviation of 1.6 Å; Fig. 3d). pArg1 as well as the anchor residues pArg2 and pVal9/pLeu9 occupy virtually identical positions (Fig. 2, a and b). As expected from the peptide sequences, the similarity of pVIPR and pLMP2 is most pronounced in the N-terminal half, extending to pArg6. In addition to the amino acid exchange at p7, the solvent-exposed pHis8 in pVIPR and pThr8 in pLMP2 lead to a marked topographical change near the peptide C termini (Figs. 2, a and b, and 3, a and c). The similarity between B*2705·pLMP2 (p6α binding mode) and B*2705·pVIPR-p6α extends beyond conformational (Figs. 2, a and b, and 3, a and c) to electrostatic properties of their surfaces (Fig. 3, e and g), particularly in the N-terminal halves of the peptides. In contrast, pLMP2 and pVIPR-p4α in B*2705 are less equivalent at residues p4–p8 (Figs. 2, c and d, and 3, a and d). The electrostatic surfaces of the two complexes in p4α/p6α conformation diverge considerably as well (Fig. 3, e and h). It seems therefore plausible to conclude that pLMP2/pVIPR CTL cross-reactivity is more likely to occur when pVIPR is displayed in p6α than in p4α conformation. Surprisingly, the p4α conformations of the two peptides found in B*2709 differ much more (Cα root mean square deviation of 0.9 Å; Figs. 2, e and f, and 3, b, d, f, and h) than the two p6α conformations in B*2705 (Figs. 2, a and b, and 3, a, c, e, and g). Again, residues p1, p2, p4, and p9 show negligible variations, and pLys3 (pVIPR) also occupies a similar position as pArg3 (pLMP2). However, the side chain guanidinium moieties of both pArg5 residues are solvent-exposed and point to opposite directions (Figs. 2, e and f, and 3, b and d), whereas those in p6α conformation (Figs. 2, a and b, and 3, a and c) are buried. pArg6 displays a substantial difference as well; in pLMP2, this side chain is completely solvent-accessible with only a few contacts to the α1-helix, whereas it wedges between the peptide backbone and the α1-helix in the complex with pVIPR (5Hülsmeyer M. Fiorillo M.T. Bettosini F. Sorrentino R. Saenger W. Ziegler A. Uchanska-Ziegler B. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The Cα atoms of pArg6 deviate by 2.3 Å, and the disparity between the guanidinium groups is even larger. Although more similarly positioned, the p7-Cα atoms still differ by 1.6 Å. The side chain of pTrp7 (pVIPR) occupies the front part of the large E-pocket, an impossible location for pLeu7 (pLMP2) because of steric hindrance exerted by the large pArg3 located in the neighboring D-pocket. As a consequence, pLeu7 occupies the back part of the E-pocket, toward the peptide C terminus, is inserted deeper than pTrp7 in pVIPR, and is shifted toward the α1-helix. The peptides deviate only by 1.1 Å at Cα of p8, but the side chains display different shapes (Fig. 3, b and d)"

Breast tumor kinase (Brk) is a soluble protein-tyrosine kinase overexpressed in the majority of breast cancers and also in normal skin and gut epithelium, but not in normal breast epithelial cells. Herein, we show that Brk interacts with protein kinase B/Akt, a serine/threonine kinase involved in cell growth and survival. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) treatment of human keratinocytes or Brk-transfected COS-1 cells leads to the dissociation of the Brk·Akt complex, whereas a constitutively active Brk mutant containing a point mutation at Tyr-447 (YF-Brk) failed to dissociate from Akt upon EGF treatment. In addition, Brk·Akt dissociation was blocked by the inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Similar to ectopic Brk, endogenous Brk in T47D breast cancer cells was less phosphorylated upon EGF treatment, but it remained constitutively associated with Akt in the presence of EGF. Overexpression of wild-type (wt)-Brk, kinase-inactive (KM)-Brk, or YF-Brk increased the Tyr phosphorylation of multiple signaling molecules including EGF receptor. However, only wt- and YF-Brk, but not KM-Brk, induced phosphorylation of Akt and inhibited the kinase activity of Akt in unstimulated cells. Similarly, overexpression of wt- or YF-, but not KM-Brk, blocked the phosphorylation of the forkhead transcription factor, a downstream Akt target. These results suggest that Brk may function as a signaling molecule whose kinase activity normally limits the activity of Akt in unstimulated cells. Additionally, these results suggest that in breast cancer cells Brk behaves similarly to a constitutively active Brk mutant (YF-Brk) and associates with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in deregulated signaling complexes. Together these data provide clues to the possible proto-oncogenic and oncogenic functions of Brk.

Brk expression is low or undetectable in normal mammary tissue and benign lesions; however, roughly 65% of breast tumors express appreciable Brk levels, and 27% of Brk-positive tumors overexpress Brk by 5-fold or more (2Barker K.T. Jackson L.E. Crompton M.R. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 799-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Brk partially transforms human mammary epithelial cells (3Kamalati T. Jolin H.E. Mitchell P.J. Barker K.T. Jackson L.E. Dean C.J. Page M.J. Gusterson B.A. Crompton M.R. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5006-5010Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Additionally, Brk has been shown to associate with the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) and confers increased sensitivity to the mitogenic effects of EGF (3Kamalati T. Jolin H.E. Mitchell P.J. Barker K.T. Jackson L.E. Dean C.J. Page M.J. Gusterson B.A. Crompton M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30956-30963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These results suggest that inappropriate overexpression of Brk may contribute to breast cancer development or progression toward a more malignant phenotype. Brk is considered to be a member of a unique family of intracellular soluble Src-like tyrosine kinases that includes Srm, Frk, and Src42A/Dsrc41 (5Serfas M.S. Tyner A.L. Oncol. Res. 2003; 13: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Brk family kinases are defined by a highly conserved exon structure that is distinct from other major tyrosine kinase families including c-Src (6Lee H. Kim M. Lee K.H. Kang K.N. Lee S.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 8: 401-407Google Scholar). For example, Brk contains single SH3, SH2, and tyrosine kinase domains but shares only 46% amino acid identity with c-Src and lacks an N-terminal consensus sequence for myristoylation and membrane association. In contrast to c-Src, several Brk family kinases have been shown to have an inhibitory effect on Ras pathway signaling from receptor tyrosine kinases (5Serfas M.S. Tyner A.L. Oncol. Res. 2003; 13: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and in mouse keratinocytes, the mouse homolog of Brk (Sik) functions as an intermediate in calcium-induced differentiation (7Vasioukhin V. Tyner A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14477-14482Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Only a few substrates for Brk phosphorylation in vivo have been identified. Sam68 is a 68-kDa RNA-binding protein that can substitute for the human immunodeficiency virus Rev protein in mediating nuclear export of sequence-specific RNAs (8Reddy T.R. Xu W.D. Wong-Staal F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4071-4074Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) as well as alter the fate of selected RNAs in the cytoplasm (9Coyle J.H. Guzik B.W. Bor Y.C. Jin L. Eisner-Smerage L. Taylor S.J. Rekosh D. Hammarskjold M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 92-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Recently, the Sam68-like proteins, SLM-1 and SLM-2, have been shown to be Brk substrates (10Haegebarth A. Heap D. Bie W. Derry J.J. Richard S. Tyner A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54398-54404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Similar to Sam68, phosphorylation of SLM-1 and SLM-2 by Brk leads to inhibition of their RNA binding function. Additionally, two related Brk substrate proteins of 45 and 50 kDa appear to be novel adaptor-like molecules with unknown function (11Mitchell P.J. Sara E.A. Crompton M.R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4273-4282Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It is now well accepted that ligand-activated receptor protein-tyrosine kinases transduce their signals through association with a growing number of specific cytoplasmic target proteins, many of which contain SH2 and/or SH3 domains that bind to phosphotyrosine-containing and proline-rich sequences, respectively. Some receptor-associated proteins possess enzyme activity, such as phospholipase C-γ1, whereas others lack apparent enzyme activity, such as Grb2, Nck, or Shc isoforms. Nonreceptor protein or lipid kinases, such as c-Src or PI3K, clearly rely on both the ability to form appropriate protein-protein complexes and kinase activity for proper function. Perhaps not surprising, given its SH2/SH3 domain structure, Brk has been shown to interact with EGFRs (3Kamalati T. Jolin H.E. Mitchell P.J. Barker K.T. Jackson L.E. Dean C.J. Page M.J. Gusterson B.A. Crompton M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30956-30963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and Brk overexpression in mammary epithelial cells resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of EGFR-related c-erbB3 receptors and potentiated c-erbB3-associated signaling to the PI3K/Akt pathway in response to EGF treatment of cells (12Kamalati T. Jolin H.E. Fry M.J. Crompton M.R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5471-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, the ability of Brk to increase cell growth in response to EGF was independent of its kinase activity (4Harvey A.J. Crompton M.R. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5006-5010Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), suggesting that Brk-induced changes in complex formation are sufficient to alter proliferative signaling. Aside from these important initial studies (3Kamalati T. Jolin H.E. Mitchell P.J. Barker K.T. Jackson L.E. Dean C.J. Page M.J. Gusterson B.A. Crompton M.R. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5471-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), Brk function and interacting partners remain largely undefined. In this report, we sought to understand better the contribution of Brk kinase activity and protein interactions to altered signal transduction pathways. We found that independent of its kinase activity, Brk associates with Akt and other tyrosine-phosphorylated molecules in signaling complexes that dissociate upon stimulation of cells with EGF. In unstimulated cells, Brk kinase activity mediates Tyr phosphorylation and inhibition of Akt in the Brk·Akt complex and blocks downstream signaling to the forkhead transcriptional repressor (FKHR). Our findings shed new light on the possible mechanisms of regulated “protooncogenic” Brk function in nontransformed cells and the possible involvement of inappropriately overexpressed “oncogenic” Brk in breast cancer cells.

The resulting immune complexes were washed four times in immunoprecipitation buffer and subjected to in vitro Akt kinase assay using the Akt kinase assay kit (Cell Signaling Technologies, Beverly, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. In Vitro Brk Kinase Assay—Endogenous Brk was immunoprecipitated from 1-mg lysates of serum-starved T47D breast cancer cells incubated for 10 min in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml EGF using Brk-specific antibodies pr-conjugated to protein A/G Plus-agarose beads. Prior to activity assays, Brk immunoprecipitates were washed twice with 1 ml each in buffer EB (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 200 μm Na3VO4, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin), twice in PAN Nonidet P-40 buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin), and twice in PAN buffer minus Nonidet P-40. Autophosphorylation of Brk was measured by incubating Brk immunoprecipitates with 40 μm [γ32P]ATP (100 cpm/fmol) in 50 μl of kinase buffer (4 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 200 μm Na3VO4, 200 μm dithiothreitol, 200 μm CaCl2, 12 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ATP, 12 mm MnCl2) for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 10 μl 6× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 12% polyacrylamide gels followed by autoradiography. Brk Associates with Akt in Immune Complexes—Previous reports suggest that Brk can potentiate the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway via association with erbB family members (3Kamalati T. Jolin H.E.

To examine further how Brk may alter the function of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, we examined Brk immunoprecipitates for the presence of Akt molecules (Fig. 1). COS-1 cells were transfected with either RcCMV-Brk or the RcCMV parent vector as a control, and Brk was immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates using Brk-specific antibodies. Brk immunoprecipitates were then subjected to Western blotting with Akt-specific antibodies (Fig. 1A). Endogenous Akt was present in Brk immunoprecipitates, but it was not found in vector or nonspecific IgG control immunoprecipitates. The specific interaction of Brk with Akt in COS-1 cells was confirmed by reverse immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged Akt followed by Western blotting with Brk-specific antibodies (Fig. 1B). Importantly, the Brk-Akt interaction between endogenously expressed molecules was also specifically detected in Akt-immunoprecipitates from Brk-positive T47D human breast cancer cells (Fig. 1C). Additionally, the p85 subunit of PI3K was weakly detectable relative to Akt in Brk immunoprecipitates from Brk-positive T47D cells, but not from Brk-null MDA-MB-468 cells (not shown).Fig. 1Coimmunoprecipitation of Brk and Akt. A, Brk immunoprecipitation (IP) in COS cells. Expression vectors encoding Brk or parent vector (V) control DNA were transiently transfected into COS cells. Brk protein was immunoprecipitated using Brk-specific antibodies and protein G-agarose beads. Endogenous Akt was visualized by Western blotting in Brk immunoprecipitates and COS cell lysates using Akt-specific antibodies. Controls using nonspecific IgG and protein G-agarose beads (IgG) or lysates from vector-transfected cells demonstrated the specificity of the Brk-Akt interaction. B, Akt immunoprecipitation in COS cells. The above experiments in A were repeated after transient transfection of HA-tagged Akt and either control parent vector or Brk into COS cells. HA-tagged Akt was immunoprecipitated using an HA-specific monoclonal antibody, and Akt and Brk were visualized in immunoprecipitations by Western blotting (WB). C, Brk and Akt interact in T47D human breast cancer cells. Endogenous Akt was immunoprecipitated from Brk-positive T47D cell lysates using an Akt-specific antibody-bead conjugate, and Brk and Akt were visualized in immunoprecipitations by Western blotting. Controls using nonspecific antibodies and protein G-agarose beads (IgG) demonstrated the specificity of the Brk-Akt interaction. D, Brk interacts with Akt PXXP motif mutant. Wt-Brk was expressed with either vector control, wt-, KM-, a PXXP mutant, or ΔN-Akt. Brk or IgG control immunoprecipitates were then Western blotted with anti-HA and anti-Brk antibodies. Lysates were also Western blotted with anti-HA and anti-Brk antibodies as controls for Akt and Brk expression.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The interaction between Akt and c-Src has been shown to require the PXXP domain in the C-terminal portion of Akt and the SH3 domain of c-Src. To determine whether the PXXP motif in Akt, located at amino acids 424–427, is also required for the Brk-Akt interaction, Brk was coexpressed with vector control, or HA-tagged wt-Akt, or PXXP Akt mutant containing proline to alanine mutations at positions 424 and 427. We also included kinase-inactive KM-Akt and an Akt N-terminal deletion mutant (ΔN) lacking amino acids 4–129 of Akt, a region that contains the N-terminal pleckstrin homology (AH/PH) domain of Akt. After immunoprecipitation with antibodies to Brk, the presence of the Akt mutants was observed by Western blotting with an anti-HA antibody. As seen in Fig. 1D, wt-Akt and both the PXXP and KM mutants of Akt were able to interact with wt-Brk, suggesting that Brk does not interact with the PXXP domain of Akt in the same manner as c-Src and that Akt kinase activity is not required for this interaction. Furthermore, the interaction does not require the N terminus of Akt, although binding to this region is diminished relative to full-length Akt, suggesting that the AH/PH region of Akt may participate in the Brk interaction and that multiple regions of the full-length Akt molecule contribute to Brk interactions. Wild-type and Kinase-dead Brk, but Not Constitutively Active Brk, Dissociate from Akt upon EGF Treatment—Akt association with protein kinase C (18Mao M. Fang X. Lu Y. Lapushin R. Bast Jr., R.C. Mills G.B. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and with c-Src (19Jiang T. Qiu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15789-15793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) increases in response to acute EGF treatment of epithelial cells. To examine the potential for EGF regulation of Brk·Akt complexes, we repeated the above coimmunoprecipitation experiments in serum-starved cells either left untreated or treated with EGF for 10 min. Because overexpression of Brk may alter its regulatory properties, we first examined human keratinocytes, which normally express Brk as a key kinase mediator of calcium-induced differentiation (7Vasioukhin V. Tyner A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14477-14482Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Endogenous Akt was immunoprecipitated from serum-starved normal HaCat keratinocyte cells and probed using Brk-specific antibodies (Fig. 2A). Cell lysates served as loading controls and a measure of input protein relative to each immunoprecipitation reaction. Again, Brk was present in Akt immunoprecipitates from unstimulated HaCat cells but was not found in nonspecific IgG control immunoprecipitates. Interestingly, in contrast to studies with other signaling molecules (18Mao M. Fang X. Lu Y. Lapushin R. Bast Jr., R.C. Mills G.B. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 19Jiang T. Qiu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15789-15793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), EGF treatment resulted in the dissociation of Brk and Akt. Dissociation of the Brk·Akt complex in response to EGFR activation suggested a role for the kinase activities of either Brk or Akt in this event (Fig. 2A). To address this question, COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with parent RcCMV control vector, or RcCMV expression vectors encoding either wt-Brk, a KM-Brk, or a mutant Brk with its regulatory C-terminal Tyr-447 mutated to Phe (YF-Brk). This mutation is analogous to the activating mutation in c-Src kinase (20Piwnica-Worms H. Saunders K.B. Roberts T.M. Smith A.E. Cheng S.H. Cell. 1987; 49: 75-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 21Courtneidge S.A. Fumagalli S. Koegl M. Superti-Furga G. Twamley-Stein G.M. Dev.

Cell. 1987; 49: 65-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) and creates a Brk protein with increased kinase activity (23Qiu H. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34634-34641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), consistent with a role for Tyr-447 in Brk autoinhibition (23Qiu H. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34634-34641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 24Hong E. Shin J. Kim H-I. Lee S.-T. Lee W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29700-29708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). After transient Brk expression in COS-1 cells, serum starvation (24 h), and EGF treatment (10 min), Akt immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blotting with Brk-specific antibodies (Fig. 2B). The results clearly show that endogenous Akt associates with each Brk protein (wt, KM, and YF) in duplicate cultures of serum-starved COS-1 cells. Interestingly, as in human keratinocytes (Fig. 2A), both KM-Brk and wt-Brk dissociated entirely from Akt in EGF-stimulated cells, whereas YF-Brk did not fully dissociate with Akt after EGF treatment. As an internal control for regulation of Akt protein-protein interactions, we were able to detect a similar weak interaction between endogenous Akt and c-Src molecules in serum-starved COS-1 cells (not shown). However, in contrast to the Brk-Akt interaction, the association between c-Src and Akt increased upon EGF treatment, as reported by Jiang and Qiu (19Jiang T. Qiu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15789-15793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), indicating that Brk and c-Src are likely to have distinct functions in signaling complexes. These results suggest that Brk and Akt interact in unstimulated cells as part of a regulated signaling complex that undergoes EGF-induced dissociation. Interestingly, the kinase activity of Brk is not required for complex association or dissociation. Rather, Tyr-447, an autoinhibitory site on Brk (23Qiu H. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34634-34641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), appears to be involved in Brk-Akt dissociation in response to EGF (Fig. 2 and see below). Next, to determine whether Akt kinase activity is required for the regulated Brk-Akt interaction, the experiment shown in Fig. 2B was repeated, except each Brk construct was cotransfected with HA-tagged KM-Akt prior to serum starvation (24 h) and EGF treatment (10 min). HA-KM-Akt was immunoprecipitated with HA-specific monoclonal antibodies, and Brk was visualized by Western blotting using Brk-specific antibodies (Fig. 2C). Each Brk protein associated with HA-tagged KM-Akt, indicating that the kinase activities of either Brk or Akt are not required for this interaction. Rather, we routinely observed the strongest association between KM-Brk and Akt molecules relative to their active counterparts (Fig. 2 and see below). Similar to the interaction of wt-Akt with KM-Brk (Fig. 2B), KM-Brk dissociated entirely from KM-Akt upon EGF treatment of COS-1 cells (Fig. 2C). However, a much reduced but weak interaction between KM-Akt and wt-Brk was detected after EGF simulation of starved cells, whereas YF-Brk failed to dissociate from KM-Akt as shown above for the interaction of YF-Brk with wt-Akt (Fig. 2B). To examine whether activation of Akt by EGF-induced PI3K activity is required for the disruption of the Brk·Akt complex, experiments were repeated in which wt-Brk was transiently transfected into COS-1 cells. Endogenous Akt was then immunoprecipitated from serum-starved cells and treated without or with EGF (10 min) in the presence or absence of LY294002 (Fig. 2D). Again, wt-Brk coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous Akt in starved, but not in EGF-stimulated cells, and Akt was present in each immunoprecipitation reaction. Surprisingly however, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 fully blocked Brk-Akt dissociation in the presence of EGF. Western blots of cell lysates using specific phospho- and total Akt antibodies showed that EGF treatment activated Akt well, whereas the LY inhibitor compound blocked activation of Akt by EGF (Fig. 2D, bottom panel). These results indicate that PI3K activation, an upstream event leading to activation of Akt, can trigger the release of Brk·Akt complexes. Thus, although the kinase activity of Akt is not required (Fig. 2C), the Brk·Akt complex is predicted to dissociate upon stimulation of cells with growth factors that lead to activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Wt- and KM-Brk, but Not YF-Brk, Form Signaling Complexes That Dissociate upon EGF Treatment—The above results suggest that additional phosphoproteins may participate in the regulation of the Brk·Akt complex. We therefore examined Brk protein complexes using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 3A). COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with either RcCMV control vector or constructs encoding wt-Brk, KM-Brk, or YF-Brk. Transfected cells were serum-starved for 18–24 h and then treated without or with EGF for 10 min. Brk was immunoprecipitated using Brk-specific antibodies, and Western blots were probed with 4G10 monoclonal anti-phospho-Tyr antibodies. Although roughly equal amount"

APOBEC3G localized throughout the cytoplasm and co-localized with γ-tubulin, 20 S proteasome subunit, and ubiquitin at punctate cytoplasmic bodies that can be used to monitor the Vif-APOBEC3G interaction in the cell. Through immunostaining and live imaging, we showed that a substantial fraction of Vif localized to the nucleus, and this localization was impaired by deletion of amino acids 12-23. When co-expressed, Vif exhibited more pronounced localization to the cytoplasm and reduced the total cellular levels of APOBEC3G but rarely co-localized with APOBEC3G at cytoplasmic bodies. On the contrary, VifC114S, which is inactive but continues to interact with APOBEC3G, stably associated with APOBEC3G in the cytoplasm, resulting in complete co-localization at cytoplasmic bodies and a dose-dependent exclusion of VifC114S from the nucleus. Following proteasome inhibition, cytoplasmic APOBEC3G levels increased, and both proteins co-accumulated nonspecifically into a vimentin-encaged aggresome. Furthermore in the presence or absence of APOBEC3G, Vif localization was significantly altered by proteasome inhibition, suggesting that aberrant localization may also contribute to the loss of Vif function. Finally mutations at Vif Ile9 disrupted the ability of Vif or VifC114S to coimmunoprecipitate and to co-localize with APOBEC3G, suggesting that the N terminus of Vif mediates interactions with APOBEC3G. Taken together, these results demonstrate that cytoplasmic Vif-APOBEC3G interactions are required but are not sufficient for Vif to modulate APOBEC3G and can be monitored by co-localization in vivo.

In addition, mutational analyses have uncovered some of the regions required for Vif-APOBEC3G functional interactions. Vif mutants lacking the conserved SLQ(Y/F)LA motif can coimmunoprecipitate with APOBEC3G but are not functional (19Marin M. Rose K.M. Kozak S.L. Kabat D. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1398-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 26Simon J.H. Sheehy A.M. Carpenter E.A. Fouchier R.A. Malim M.H. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2675-2681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations at conserved Cys114 or Cys133 that abolish Vif effector functions also render Vif inactive toward APOBEC3G in the context of virus (27Kao S. Khan M.A. Miyagi E. Plishka R. Buckler-White A. Strebel K. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 11398-11407Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), but whether these mutations affect interactions with APOBEC3G is unknown. In this study, we correlated Vif-mediated, proteasome-dependent degradation of APOBEC3G with the subcellular localization of the Vif-APOBEC3G interaction. Through the analysis of functional and nonfunctional Vif-APOBEC3G interactions, we demonstrated that APOBEC3G influenced the subcellular distribution of Vif, that Vif-APOBEC3G interactions were required but were not sufficient for Vif to modulate APOBEC3G protein levels, and that Vif Ile9 was critical for Vif to interact with APOBEC3G. Reagents—The HIV-1 subgenomic proviral vector pNL-A1, which harbors HXB2 strain Vif; the corresponding pNL-A1Δvif vector; and pNL-A1C1, which harbors the VifC114S mutant, were all generous gifts of Dr. Klaus Strebel (27Kao S.

Single cycle HIV-1 luciferase reporter virus pNL-Luc-E-R- was used as a source for NL4-3 strain Vif and was a generous gift of Dr. Nathaniel Landau. A series of HIV-1 NL4-3 strain Vif deletion mutants, Δ2 (Δ12-23), Δ5 (Δ43-59), Δ6 (Δ58-74), Δ7 (Δ73-87), Δ9 (Δ97-112), Δ10 (Δ111-128), and Δ12 (Δ140-148) (26Simon J.H. Sheehy A.M. Carpenter E.A. Fouchier R.A. Malim M.H. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2675-2681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were generous gifts of Dr. Michael Malim through Dr. David Kabat. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. DNA Manipulations—To generate yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) epitope-tagged versions of Vif or Vif mutants, the Vif coding region was PCR amplified and cloned into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pEYFP-C1 (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA). The APOBEC3G coding region was amplified from cDNA derived from frozen human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (a generous gift from Dr. Mario Stevenson). To generate pCFP-APO, the APOBEC3G coding sequence was cloned into the HindIII and SacII sites of pECFP-C1 (BD Biosciences). For expression of APOBEC3G with a C-terminal epitope tag, a Kozak ribosome recognition sequence (ccacc) was placed directly upstream of the APOBEC3G start codon during PCR amplification. APOBEC3G with a C-terminal 3× hemagglutinin (HA) tag (pAPO-HA) and pAPO-CFP were engineered by cloning APOBEC3G into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pIRES-hrGFP-2a (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and the HindIII and SacII sites of pECFP-N1 (BD Biosciences), respectively. Tat-red fluorescent protein (RFP) was generated by cloning HIV-1 Tat into the HindIII and BamHI sites of pDsRED-N1 (BD Biosciences). To induce random mutations within the VifC114S coding sequence, pNL-A1VifC114S was used as a template for low fidelity PCR, and the resulting products were cloned into pEYFP-C1 as described above. DNA from random colonies was prepared (Promega, Madison, WI) and used to transfect 293T cells. Cell Culture and Transfection Procedures—293T cells were maintained in a humidified incubator (5% CO2) at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Qiagen-purified plasmid DNA (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was transfected into 293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For Western blot and immunoprecipitation experiments, 293T cells were transfected in either 6- or 12-well plates when the cells were ∼60% confluent. The amount of vector used and the molar ratio of vector for co-transfection experiments are described under “Results” and in the figure legends. When necessary, final DNA amounts were made equal by the addition of pGEM (Promega). For live imaging and immunolocalization, 293T cells were seeded into poly-d-lysine-coated 35-mm glass bottom culture dishes and transfected when the cells were ∼50% confluent. For proteasome inhibition studies, culture medium containing 100 μm of N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucine-CHO (ALLN, Calbiochem) or the equivalent volume of Me2SO was added to cells 12 h prior to harvesting or imaging 36 h post-transfection. Preparation of Total Cell Lysates, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot Analysis—To prepare total protein lysates, each well of a 6- or 12-well plate was washed one time in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Invitrogen) and then lysed in either 400 or 200 μl, respectively, of Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (M-PER, Pierce) supplemented with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Pierce), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and a 1:100 (v/v) dilution of a protease inhibitor mixture for mammalian tissue for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle rotation. Lysates were harvested from the well, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 5 min at full speed in a microcentrifuge. Protein concentration was determined by DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). For immunoprecipitation, 0.5 mg of lysate was diluted to 0.5 mg/ml in 1 ml of lysis buffer. APO-HA was precipitated by incubation with agarose-conjugated rabbit α-HA (20 μg of IgG, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). To immunoprecipitate CFP-APO, lysates were first precleared with a 50-μl bed volume of Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. CFP-APO was then precipitated from precleared lysates by incubation with 5 μg of an α-GFP rabbit polyclonal (BD Biosciences) for 3 h at 4 °C. Antibody was captured by incubation with a 50-μl bed volume of Protein G-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C followed by four washes in 1 ml of lysis buffer for 10 min each time. Protein was eluted by boiling for 5 min at 100 °C in sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 10% (v/v) glycerol). For SDS-PAGE of protein lysates, samples were denatured and reduced by adding 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer followed by boiling at 100 °C for 5 min. Protein was resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) using a Semi-Dry Electroblotter (Bio-Rad). Following transfer, the membrane was blocked overnight in 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in TBS-T (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) and washed three times for 10 min each in TBS-T before and after the addition of antibody. All antibodies were diluted in 2.5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in TBS-T. CFP, YFP, and GFP were detected using a mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) against GFP diluted to 1 μg/ml (BD Biosciences). RFP was detected with a rabbit polyclonal (BD Biosciences) diluted to 0.1 μg/ml. Human CycT1 was detected with a goat anti-CycT1 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) diluted to 0.1 μg/ml. HA was detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) diluted to 0.02 μg/ml. Vif and Vif mutants were detected using a Vif mAb diluted 1:5000 (This reagent was obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health: HIV-1 Vif monoclonal antibody (no. 319) from Dr. Michael H. Malim (28Simon J.H. Southerling T.E. Peterson J.C. Meyer B.E. Malim M.H. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4166-4172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Simon J.H. Fouchier R.A. Southerling T.E. Guerra C.B.

All horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used at a dilution of 0.05 μg/ml (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Blots were developed with the BM Chemiluminescence Blotting kit (Roche Applied Science) and exposed to Kodak BioMax MR x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Immunolocalization and Live Imaging—Cells were fixed in 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) in PBS for 20 min followed by permeabilization with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Pierce) for 20 min. Alternatively, cells were fixed and permeabilized using -20 °C methanol for 10 min. Samples were blocked for 30 min in PBS containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA/PBS). All primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in BSA/PBS. Primary antibodies α-Vif mAb (1:500 dilution), α-HA rabbit polyclonal (0.2 μg/ml), α-γ-tubulin mAb (1:500 dilution), α-vimentin mAb (0.4 μg/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), α-20 S proteasome subunit rabbit polyclonal (1 μg/ml, Calbiochem), and α-ubiquitin mAb (2 μg/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were diluted in BSA/PBS and incubated with sample for 1 h. α-Mouse and α-rabbit secondary antibodies directly conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 568 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) were diluted to 5 μg/ml in BSA/PBS and incubated with sample for 45 min. To stain nuclei, Hoechst 33258 was used at a concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. For live imaging, cells were visualized without changing the culture medium. Samples were visualized with a Leica confocal imaging spectrophotometer system (TCS-SP2) (Leica, Exton, PA) attached to a Leica DMIRE inverted fluorescence microscope and equipped with an argon laser (458, 476, 488, and 514 nm lines), two HeNe lasers (543 and 633 nm lines), an acousto-optic tunable filter to attenuate individual visible laser lines, and a tunable acousto-optical beam splitter. All images were acquired from a 63×, 1.32 numerical aperture oil immersion objective, and image analysis was performed using Leica Confocal Software and Adobe Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA). Analysis of the Proteasome-dependent Depletion of APOBEC3G by Vif—The level of Vif-mediated depletion of APOBEC3G was determined over a broad range of Vif (pNL-A1):APOBEC3G (pCFP-APO) vector ratios ranging from 1:1 to 1:0.0625 where 1 refers to 130 fmol of vector. The level of depletion was determined by comparing the steady-state levels of CFP-APO when co-expressed with Vif to the equivalent Δvif control (pNL-A1Δvif). CFP-APO depletion by Vif was most significant between the 1:0.25 and 1:0.0625 ratios (Fig. 1A). Recovery of CFP-APO levels by proteasome inhibition (ALLN) was most dramatic at the 1:0.25 ratio (Fig. 1A). Despite significant depletion by Vif, only modest recovery of CFP-APO was observed at the 1:0.125 and 1:0.0625 ratios following proteasome inhibition (Fig. 1A). In the absence of Vif, CFP-APO levels were not significantly affected by proteasome inhibition except at the lowest level of pCFP-APO input (1:0.0625 ratio) for which a modest reduction in expression was observed (Fig. 1A). Identical expression profiles were also observed with pAPO-CFP or pAPO-HA in the presence and absence of Vif (data not shown). In the presence (Fig. 1A) or absence (data not shown) of CFP-APO, proteasome inhibition elevated the steady-state levels of Vif and resulted in the appearance of higher molecular weight species (Fig. 1A, arrow). The pNL-A1:pCFP-APO ratio of 1:0.25 was also visualized by confocal microscopy. In cells expressing Vif, CFP-APO was either not visible or was detected at a significantly reduced level relative to the Δvif control (Fig. 1B, DMSO, arrows). Consistent with our immunoblot analysis, CFP-APO levels were elevated by proteasome inhibition, and the number of cells visibly co-expressing the two proteins increased (Fig. 1B, ALLN). Subcellular Localization of APOBEC3G—To examine the subcellular localization of APOBEC3G in 293T cells, APO-HA was immunolocalized and CFP-APO and APO-CFP were visualized directly in live cells. APOBEC3G localized throughout the cytoplasm and was largely excluded from the nucleus (Fig. 2A). APOBEC3G was also concentrated at punctate bodies that were often in close proximity to the nucleus but were not necessarily restricted from other regions in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2A). Titration of pCFP-APO revealed that transfection of as little as 4 fmol (31 ng) was sufficient to visualize the protein by live imaging. At this level of expression, CFP-APO continued to localize to cytoplasmic bodies in ∼30% of cells. When co-expressed, APO-HA and CFP-APO, which also coimmunoprecipitated (data not shown), always co-localized to the same cytoplasmic bodies (Fig. 2B). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis of APO-CFP and APO-YFP co-localized at cytoplasmic bodies showed that donor (APO-CFP) signal intensity typically increased 10-20% following acceptor (APO-YFP) photobleaching. Taken together, these results indicated that cytoplasmic bodies contained APOBEC3G multimers that may represent the functional form of the protein (31Jarmuz A. Chester A. Bayliss J. Gisbourne J. Dunham I. Scott J. Navaratnam N. Genomics. 2002; 79: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 32Shindo K. Takaori-Kondo A. Kobayashi M. Abudu A. Fukunaga K. Uchiyama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44412-44416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic bodies did not co-localize with markers for the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, or endosomes (data not shown). Since they were often located in the vicinity of the nucleus, we also analyzed whether cytoplasmic bodies were associated with the centrosome. In the absence of APOBEC3G, γ-tubulin immunolocalizes diffusely throughout the cytoplasm and in the majority of cells to a single centrosome (date not shown). In the presence of APOBEC3G, γ-tubulin was always concentrated at cytoplasmic bodies (Fig. 2C, circles), but CFP-APO did not co-localize with the centrosome (Fig. 2C, arrows). γ-Tubulin could not be coimmunoprecipitated with CFP-APO using standard protocols for protein solubilization (Fig. 4A), suggesting that these proteins may be part of an insoluble complex. Immunolocalization of 20 S proteasome subunit and ubiquitin revealed that both proteins were sometimes associated with cytoplasmic bodies (Fig. 2, D and E, circles); however, significant detection of either protein at cytoplasmic bodies was infrequent and limited to the relatively larger bodies. Cytoplasmic bodies were also not surrounded by a cage of the intermediate filament vimentin (Fig. 2F, circles), suggesting that these structures were different from an aggresome (Ref. 33Kopito R.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 524-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar and see below). Subcellular Localization of Vif—To establish where Vif localizes in 293T cells, Vif was immunolocalized in fixed cells using two different fixation methods and was localized in live cells using YFP-Vif. After fixation with paraformaldehyde, Vif localized predominantly to the nucleus in ∼40% of cells and predominantly to the cytoplasm in ∼60% of cells (Fig. 3A, Pf). In contrast, after fixation with methanol, Vif localized almost exclusively to the cytoplasm in >98% of cells (Fig. 3A, MeOH). In live cells, a YFP-tagged version of Vif (YFP-Vif) exhibited a localization pattern more closely resembling Vif immunolocalization following paraformaldehyde fixation. However, their respective patterns were also different in that YFP-Vif exhibited more predominant nuclear localization in >90% of cells (Fig. 3A, Live, YFP-Vif). YFP-Vif imaged in living cells showed a similar localization pattern in HeLa cells and in non-permissive Hut78 T-cells, and this pattern was the same for either HXB2 or NL4-3 strain Vif (data not shown). To analyze the effects of fixation on YFP-Vif localization, YFP-Vif visualized directly by YFP fluorescence was compared with YFP-Vif visualized by indirect immunostaining with α-Vif and α-GFP. Following methanol fixation, YFP-Vif localized almost exclusively to the cytoplasm, and the localization patterns observed using either YFP fluorescence or immunolocalization (α-Vif and α-GFP) were indistinguishable (Fig. 3B, Methanol). Following paraformaldehyde fixation, YFP fluorescence showed YFP-Vif localized largely to the nucleus, but after immunolocalization with either α-Vif or α-GFP, more YFP-Vif appeared to be in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3B, Paraformaldehyde). These results demonstrated that the method of fixation can significantly affect the localization of Vif and suggested that cytoplasmic Vif may be more amenable to immunostaining. To determine whether a particular region of Vif influences nuclear localization, YFP-tagged versions of a limited series of NL4-3 Vif deletion mutants (Δ12-23, Δ43-59, Δ58-74, Δ73-87, Δ97-112, Δ111-128, and Δ140-148) and HXB2 strain VifC114S were examined. The majority of mutants exhibited a localization pattern similar to YFP-Vif (represented by YFP-VifC114S, YFP-VifΔ43-59, and YFP-VifΔ140-148 in Fig. 5, B, E, and C, respectively) with the exception of YFP-VifΔ12-23, which was largely restricted to the cytoplasm (Fig. 5D). This analysis indicated that a specific region of Vif targets YFP-Vif to the nucleus. Analysis of the Vif-APOBEC3G Interaction in Live Cells—To avoid the variability associated with immunolocalization, the Vif-APOBEC3G relationship was characterized using live imaging with YFP-VifC114S serving as a nonfunctional control. As previously reported (27Kao S. Khan M.A. Miyagi E. Plishka R. Buckler-White A. Strebel K. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 11398-11407Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), VifC114S was inactive against CFP-APO (Fig. 4A, Total lysate); however, VifC114S coimmunoprecipitated with CFP-APO (Fig. 4A, IP: α-GFP), indicating that the loss of function associated with the C114S mutation was not due to an inability to interact with APOBEC3G. Interestingly Vif also coimmunoprecipitated with CF"

We found that co-expression of a lipid raft-excluded transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase, PTPα, suppresses Lyn kinase activity and markedly reduces the level of spontaneous phosphorylation of FcϵRI, while facilitating its antigen-stimulated phosphorylation. Other tyrosine phosphatases, including SHP-1, CD45, and a lipid raft-preferring chimeric version of PTPα fail to reconstitute antigen-dependent FcϵRI phosphorylation. We concluded that both substrate specificity and submembrane location are critical to phosphatase-mediated regulation of Lyn kinase activity that supports activation of FcϵRI.

We concluded that both substrate specificity and submembrane location are critical to phosphatase-mediated regulation of Lyn kinase activity that supports activation of FcϵRI. FcϵRI, the high affinity receptor for IgE, is a member of the family of multichain immune recognition receptors including T and B cell receptors for antigen, certain NK cell receptors, and other Fc receptors on various hematopoietic cells. All of these receptors contain at least one ITAM 1The abbreviations used are: ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif; ITIM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif; SH, Src homology; RBL, rat basophilic leukemia; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DNP, 2,4-dinitrophenyl; mAb, monoclonal antibody; wt, wild type. or ITIM sequence in the cytoplasmic segment of one or more subunit (1Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3281-3285PubMed Google Scholar, 2Moretta A. Biassoni R. Bottino C. Moretta L. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In every case, receptor-mediated signaling is initiated when tyrosine residues in these sequences are phosphorylated by a Src family tyrosine kinase. For FcϵRI in mast cells, ITAM phosphorylation of both its β and γ2 subunits is catalyzed principally by the Src kinase Lyn, and this is stimulated by antigen-mediated cross-linking of two or more IgE-receptor complexes (3Metzger H. Eglite S. Haleem-Smith H. Reischl I. Torigoe C. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 38: 1207-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 4Kinet J.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 931-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). ITAM phosphorylation of this and other multichain immune recognition receptor family members recruits and activates the tyrosine kinase Syk (or Zap70 in T cells) leading to a cascade of downstream signaling and cell activation processes (5Siraganian R.P. Zhang J. Suzuki K. Sada K. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 38: 1229-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 6Rivera J. Cordero J.R. Furumoto Y. Luciano-Montalvo C. Gonzalez-Espinosa C. Kovarova M. Odom S. Parravicini V. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 38: 1253-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which IgE-FcϵRI cross-linking initiates receptor tyrosine phosphorylation has been extensively studied. The β subunit of FcϵRI has been shown to bind Lyn weakly in the absence of ITAM phosphorylation (7Vonakis B.M. Haleem-Smith H. Benjamin P. Metzger H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and a transphosphorylation model has been developed from this and other studies (3Metzger H. Eglite S. Haleem-Smith H. Reischl I. Torigoe C. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 38: 1207-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In addition, FcϵRI β has been shown to serve an amplifying role for FcϵRI γ2 ITAM phosphorylation and consequent Syk activation, most probably by the binding of the SH2 domain of Lyn to phosphorylated FcϵRI β (4Kinet J.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 931-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). However, FcϵRI β is dispensable for signal initiation and downstream cell activation (8Alber G. Miller L.

Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4276-4280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 11Sheets E.D. Holowka D. Baird B. J.

Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 457-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). To understand the role of lipid rafts in FcϵRI phosphorylation by Lyn, we investigated the effects of this ordered lipid environment on Lyn tyrosine kinase activity in RBL mast cells. We found that rafts protect the active site tyrosine residue of Lyn from dephosphorylation, thereby enhancing the specific activity of Lyn kinase in lipid rafts relative to that in more disordered regions of the plasma membrane (13Young R.M. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20746-20752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). As cross-linking of IgE-FcϵRI causes association of these receptors with lipids rafts (10Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4276-4280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 14Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9201-9205Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), we postulated that the raft environment serves principally to permit receptor phosphorylation by active Lyn in the same environment and to protect these proteins from dephosphorylation by a phosphatase that is excluded from lipid rafts (13Young R.M. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20746-20752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we utilized FcϵRI stably expressed in a CHO cell line that exhibits an unusually high level of basal (unstimulated) FcϵRI tyrosine phosphorylation because of co-expressed Lyn (15Torigoe C. Metzger H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4016-4025Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We compared the capacity of different tyrosine phosphatases to regulate both basal and stimulated FcϵRI tyrosine phosphorylation in this situation. We find that the expression of the transmembrane phosphatase PTPα is highly effective in this role. Furthermore, we showed that the conversion of PTPα to a lipid-anchored, raft-preferring phosphatase abolishes its capacity to facilitate antigen-stimulated FcϵRI tyrosine phosphorylation. Our results are consistent with a general role for protein segregation by lipid rafts in the regulation of enzymatic and other signaling processes. DNA Constructs—Lyn was amplified by PCR from Lyn-pcDM8, provided by Dr. Henry Metzger (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) with primers (forward sequence) 5′-TATTGTGGATCCGCCACCATGGGATGTATTAAATCAAA-3′ and (reverse sequence) 5′-ATTGTTCTCGAGCTATGGCTGCTGCTGATACTG-3′ and subcloned into pcDNA3 with BamHI and XhoI. Tyr to Phe Lyn mutants were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). PTPα-pcDNA3 was supplied by Dr. David Shalloway (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY) and SHP-1-pRc-CMV by Dr. Katherine Siminovitch (University of Toronto, Toronto, ON). PM-PTPα is a construct of the first 21 amino acids of Lyn attached to the cytoplasmic portion of PTPα with a 2 amino acid linker (KL), created using PCR to generate a fragment containing the first 63 nucleotides of Lyn with a 5′ BamHI and a 3′-Hind III site using the same forward primer as above and (reverse sequence) 5′-TGTATTAAGCTTAGTCTTCATATCTACTCCATC-3′ for the Lyn fragment. The cytoplasmic portion of PTPα with a 5′-Hind III and a 3′-XhoI site was created by PCR with primers (forward sequence) 5′-TATGTAAAGCTTAGGTTTAAGAAATACAAGC-3′ and (reverse sequence) 5′-ATTGTTCTCGAGTTACTTGAAGTTGGCATAATC-3′. The fragments were ligated together in pcDNA3. Human CD45RO-Neo3 was provided by Dr. Arthur Weiss (University of California, San Francisco, CA). Transfections—CHO cells stably transfected with FcϵRI (CHO-FcϵRI cells) (16Vonakis B.M. Chen H. Haleem-Smith H. Metzger H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24072-24080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) were transiently transfected in 6-well plates using Geneporter (GTS, San Diego, CA). For each well, 10 μl of Geneporter and 1 μg of Lyn-pcDNA3 and 1 μg of phosphatase construct DNA (or 0.5 μgof PM-PTPα and 0.5 μg of pcDNA3), or equivalent amounts of empty pcDNA3 vector for controls, were added to 100 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen), incubated for 15 min, and added to cells plated over with 1 ml of Opti-MEM. The mixture was then incubated for 6 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and, finally, washed and plated with CHO medium containing 1 μg/ml mouse IgE. Antibodies—Mouse IgE specific for DNP-BSA was prepared as previously described (43Posner R.G. Lee B. Conrad D.H. Holowka D. Baird B. Goldstein B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5350-5356Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Antibodies used include mouse anti-Lyn H6 mAb and polyclonal rabbit anti-Lyn 44 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), mouse anti-phospho-tyrosine mAb (4G10) and rabbit anti-SHP-1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), mouse anti-CD45 mAb (GAP8.3 (ATCC)), rabbit anti-Tyr(P)-508 (anti-phospho-Lyn (Tyr-507)) (Cell Signaling Technologies, Beverly, MA), rabbit anti-IgE (17Menon A.K.

Isersky C. Petrino M.G. Siraganian R.P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1981; 11: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) were suspended at 2 × 106 cells/ml in buffered saline solution (11Sheets E.D. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 877-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) containing bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and equilibrated to 37 °C. Cells were lysed with non-reducing SDS sample buffer before and after 2 or 5 min of stimulation with 0.9 μg/ml DNP-BSA (14Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9201-9205Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Samples were separated by electrophoresis on 12% acrylamide SDS gels, and quantitative immunoblotting was performed as previously described (13Young R.M. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20746-20752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation of FcϵRI, cells were suspended at 8 × 106 cells/ml and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (0.5% TX-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.05% SDS), which has been shown to solubilize all membrane components (13Young R.M. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20746-20752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Anti-IgE immunoprecipitations used 10 μg of anti-IgE for 0.5 ml of cell lysate, and immune complexes were pulled down with 35 μl of protein A beads (Pierce). A determination of Lyn in vitro kinase activity from Lyn was immunoprecipitated with mouse anti-Lyn mAb from radioimmune precipitation assay buffer or TX-100 post nuclear supernatants of CHO-FcϵRI cells using α casein as the substrate was carried out as described previously (13Young R.M. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20746-20752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The measurement of in vitro phosphatase activity for expressed PTPα and PM-PTPα, anti-hemagglutinin immunoprecipitated from CHO cell lysates, was carried out as described previously (41Zheng X.M. Resnick R.J. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 964-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). CHO Cells Expressing FcϵRI and Lyn Exhibit Poorly Regulated Lyn Kinase Activity—Torigoe and Metzger (15Torigoe C. Metzger H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4016-4025Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) reported high levels of spontaneous FcϵRI tyrosine phosphorylation in CHO cells stably expressing FcϵRI and the Src family kinase Lyn. In their study, spontaneous FcϵRI β subunit phosphorylation was ∼17 times greater than in RBL-2H3 mast cells. Antigen stimulation only modestly increased FcϵRI phosphorylation in CHO cells. Similarly, we find high levels of basal tyrosine phosphorylation on FcϵRI stably expressed in CHO cells when Lyn kinase is transiently expressed. As shown in Fig. 1A (left panel) anti-phosphotyrosine Western blotting of whole cell lysates (WCL) reveals high levels of spontaneous FcϵRI β and γ2 subunit phosphorylation for these transfected CHO cells. Additionally, there are elevated levels of phosphorylation of Lyn and several other proteins. In contrast, the same number of RBL cell equivalents exhibit no detectable tyrosine phosphorylation in the absence of antigen stimulation, but there is a robust increase in phosphorylation on multiple proteins, including FcϵRI, in response to antigen. We verified that the bands of ∼35 and ∼25–30 kDa on anti-phosphotyrosine Western blots of CHO-FcϵRI whole cell lysates are FcϵRI β and γ2, respectively, by confirming their co-migration with those bands precipitated by anti-IgE antibody (Fig. 1A, right panel), and by selective immunodepletion of these bands from whole cell lysates (data not shown). Note that the lower level of stimulated phosphorylation of FcϵRI β and γ2 in CHO-FcϵRI cells, compared with that in RBL cells, is expected because of lower levels of FcϵRI expression in the CHO cells (Ref. 15Torigoe C. Metzger H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4016-4025Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar and data not shown). To investigate the basis for the high basal tyrosine phosphorylation observed in Lyn-transfected CHO cells, we more closely examined Lyn kinase. As a first step we immunoprecipitated Lyn kinase from these cells and from RBL cells and compared their specific activities using α casein as described previously (13Young R.M. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20746-20752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows that Lyn kinase expressed in CHO cells has an ∼3-fold higher specific activity than Lyn from RBL cells, consistent with the higher levels of basal phosphorylation in the CHO-FcϵRI cells. Lyn kinase activity is positively regulated by phosphorylation near its active site, Tyr-397 (Lyn A notation), and negatively regulated by phosphorylation on its C-terminal tail, Tyr-508. Our previous study in RBL cells showed that Lyn activity is largely determined by phosphorylation at Tyr-397, whereas C-terminal phosphorylation is very low in resting cells (13Young R.M. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20746-20752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To assess the relative phosphorylation of these sites for Lyn in the CHO cells, we compared various Lyn mutants, using both 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine and an antibody specific for the phosphorylated C terminus of Lyn (anti-Tyr(P)-508) by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1C, we found that wt Lyn expressed in CHO cells has several times more net tyrosine phosphorylation than Lyn from RBL-2H3 cells (top panel), whereas C-terminal phosphorylation of Lyn from these two different cell types is more similar (middle panel). The mutation of Tyr-397 to Phe results in a dramatic reduction of tyrosine phosphorylation detected by 4G10 on Lyn expressed in CHO cells (Fig. 1C, top panel). Conversely, the mutation of Tyr-508 to Phe results in only a modest reduction in 4G10-detected phosphorylation (Fig. 1C, top panel) and complete elimination of the anti-Tyr(P)-508 phosphorylation (middle panel). Taken together, these results indicate that Lyn expressed in CHO cells is hyperphosphorylated at Tyr-397, and this is likely to account for its high specific activity. Co-expression of Protein-tyrosine Phosphatase PTPα with Lyn in CHO Cells Reconstitutes Antigen-dependent FcϵRI Phosphorylation—The large amount of Lyn-dependent basal phosphorylation in CHO cells suggests that these cells lack sufficient phosphatase activity to regulate exogenously expressed Lyn kinase. PTPα is a ubiquitously expressed transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase that has been found to regulate Src kinase activity (19Pallen C.J. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2003; 3: 821-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows that transient co-expression of this phosphatase with Lyn in CHO-FcϵRI cells dramatically reduces basal levels of Lyn phosphorylation and the accompanying spontaneous phosphorylation of FcϵRI β and γ2 subunits. Notably, co-expression of PTPα permits antigen-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of both receptor subunits, which is maximal between 2 and 5 min and declines thereafter, as observed for stimulation in RBL-2H3 cells (20Holowka D. Sheets E.D. Baird B. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1009-1019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As reported by Vonakis et al. (16Vonakis B.M. Chen H. Haleem-Smith H. Metzger H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24072-24080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), CHO-FcϵRI cells have a poorly detectable endogenous Src-family kinase activity, which mediates variable amounts of FcϵRI β and γ2 phosphorylation in response to antigen, and this is apparent in the vector control in Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2. The quantification of basal and stimulated FcϵRI β and γ2 phosphorylation from multiple experiments is summarized in Fig. 2B. For FcϵRI β, Lyn expression causes a significant increase in both basal and stimulated phosphorylation. Co-expression of PTPα reduces basal phosphorylation of FcϵRI β to very low levels while maintaining elevated levels of stimulated phosphorylation. For FcϵRI γ2, Lyn expression causes substantial increases in basal and stimulated phosphorylation. Co-expression of PTPα reduces basal phosphorylation by ∼10-fold while reducing stimulated phosphorylation by <3-fold. These results demonstrate that co-expression of PTPα with Lyn in CHO-FcϵRI cells controls spontaneous phosphorylation while permitting antigen-stimulated phosphorylation of FcϵRI by Lyn. Reconstitution of Signaling in CHO Cells Is Dependent on the Location of PTP Activity—We showed in Fig. 1 that Lyn expressed in CHO cells is highly active, most likely because it is strongly phosphorylated at its active site. Likewise, the activity of endogenous Lyn in RBL cells is controlled by phosphorylation at the active site (13Young R.M. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20746-20752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In that study, we found that Lyn-specific activity is substantially higher in lipid rafts than in disordered regions of the plasma membrane. We hypothesized that the rafts exclude transmembrane phosphatases that dephosphorylate and thereby inactivate Lyn located outside of lipid rafts. In Fig. 3A, a sucrose gradient analysis of TX-100-lysed CHO-FcϵRI cells transfected with PTPα shows that greater than 99% of this transmembrane protein is found in the soluble, non-raft portion of the gradient. To test the role of raft exclusion in the reconstitution of stimulated phosphorylation, we created a raft-associating form of PTPα, named PM-PTPα, by fusing the cytoplasmic portion of PTPα with the N-terminal 21 amino acids of Lyn, which target Lyn to rafts by virtue of post-translationally added palmitoylation and myristoylation (21Pyenta P.S. Holowka D. Baird B. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2120-2132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). PM-PTPα and Lyn have a similar localization to lipid rafts in transfected CHO cells, with >60% of these proteins in the low density raft fractions (Fig. 3A). To evaluate the role of this differential raft targeting for PTPα and PM-PTPα, we compared the effects of similar co-expression of each phosphatase with Lyn. As shown in Fig. 3B (top panel), co-expression of PM-PTPα leads to a further decrease in Lyn phosphorylation than for PTPα co-expression. Importantly, little antigen-stimulated phosphorylation of FcϵRI is detected in the presence of PM-PTPα in this and in three other experiments of similar design. In contrast, PTPα suppresses spontaneous FcϵRI phosphorylation but allows stimulated FcϵRI phosphorylation, similar to results in Fig. 2. In these experiments, quantitative analysis of anti-PTPα blots indicates that PM-PTPα was expressed at 1.9 ± 0.3-fold (S.E., n = 6) higher levels than PTPα. To attempt to evaluate whether this modest difference in expression could account for the more profound suppression of stimulated FcϵRI phosphorylation because of PM-PTPα, we compared in vitro phosphatase activities of PTPα and PM-PTPα immunoprecipitated from equal numbers of transfected CHO cells. In two separate experiments, the ratios of PM-PTPα/PTPα phosphatase activities were 1.22 and 0.67. These results suggest that net phosphatase activity/cell equivalent due to PM-PTPα is not significantly different from that due to PTPα, and this is not likely to account for their qualitatively different effects on stimulated FcϵRI phosphorylation. Lyn expressed in CHO cells is highly active (Fig. 1B), and we next examined whether the effects of PTPα on whole cell phosphorylation are mediated through control of Lyn activity. Fig. 3C compares the specific activities of Lyn solubilized and immunoprecipitated from CHO cells with or without PTPα or PM-PTPα co-expressed. PTPα causes a substantial decrease in specific activity of Lyn. This reduction in Lyn kinase activity may be sufficient to account for the control of basal FcϵRI phosphorylation in CHO cells expressing exogenous Lyn. The specific activity of Lyn solubilized from CHO-FcϵRI cells co-expressing Lyn and PM-PTPα is more severely reduced than that with PTPα (Fig. 3C). This further reduction in activity correlates with a reduction of Lyn activity regardless of its raft environment in PM-PTPα transfected cells, consistent with the dephosphorylation of Lyn at its active site tyrosine by PM-PTPα in both the raft and non-raft environment. Because PM-PTPα co-localizes with Lyn in lipid rafts, it has continual access to this substrate, whereas transmembrane PTPα is restricted to non-raft portions of the plasma membrane and is unable to inactivate raft-associated Lyn. Effects of Other PTPs on FcϵRI Phosphorylation by Lyn in CHO Cells—To ascertain the selectivity of PTPα regulation of FcϵRI phosphorylation by Lyn, we compared its effects to those of two other tyrosine phosphatases, SHP-1 and CD45. SHP-1 is a hematopoietic phosphatase shown to negatively regulate multichain immune recognition receptor signaling, including FcϵRI signaling in mast cells (22Siminovitch K.A. Lamhonwah A.M. Somani A.K. Cardiff R. Mills G.B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1999; 246: 291-297PubMed Google Scholar, 23Xie Z.H. Zhang J. Siraganian R.P. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1521-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It is located primarily in the cytoplasm, but it is recruited to the plasma membrane during antigen stimulation (22Siminovitch K.A. Lamhonwah A.M. Somani A.K. Cardiff R. Mills G.B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1999; 246: 291-297PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 4A shows a representative experiment in which co-expression of SHP-1 with Lyn in CHO-FcϵRI cells is compared with co-expression of PTPα. SHP-1 efficiently inhibits Lyn autophosphorylation and suppresses FcϵRI stimulation, both before and after stimulation, reminiscent of the effects of PM-PTPα (Fig. 3B). Active SHP-1 binds to protein substrates via its SH2 domains and is probably not restricted from Lyn in lipid rafts. In contrast, expression of CD45 in CHO cells causes small increases in tyrosine phosphorylation levels of multiple cellular proteins, including Lyn and FcϵRI, both before and after stimulation (Fig. 4B). Because CD45 is difficult to detect by immunoblotting, we used flow cytometry analysis that showed relatively low levels of CD45 in transfected CHO cells compared with the highly abundant expression of this phosphatase on Jurkat T cells (data not shown). Like PTPα, CD45 is a type 1 transmembrane protein that is excluded from lipid rafts (24Rodgers W. Rose J.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1515-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), so it is unlikely that its plasma membrane location distinguishes its effects from those of PTPα. CD45 is often implicated in the positive regulation of immune cell signaling by dephosphorylation of the C-terminal negative regulatory tyrosine of Src family kinases such as Lck (25Hermiston M.L. Xu Z. Weiss A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 107-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar), and our results are consistent with this role. To investigate the mechanism by which CD45 expression leads to an increase in basal phosphorylation in CHO-FcϵRI cells we compared tyrosine phosphorylation of Lyn expressed in the presence or absence of PTPα, SHP-1, or CD45. Fig. 4C summarizes the quantitative comparisons for both total tyrosine phosphorylation and Tyr-508 phosphorylation normalized separately to equivalent amounts of Lyn. We found that PTPα and SHP-1 both dephosphorylate Lyn exclusively at Tyr-397 and that SHP-1 expression actually leads to an increase in Tyr-508 phosphorylation through an unknown mechanism. In contrast, CD45 expression results in a small net dephosphorylation of Lyn at Tyr-508 that can account for the modest increase in cellular tyrosine phosphorylation we observe in CD45 expressing CHO cells (Fig. 4B). Thus, among these three phosphatases, only PTPα has the necessary combination of plasma membrane location (exclusion from lipid rafts) and substrate specificity (Lyn Tyr-397) that allow it to reconstitute effective regulation of Lyn kinase activity and the early events of FcϵRI signaling in CHO cells. Our present findings showed that a transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase, PTPα, plays an essential role in the regulation of FcϵRI phosphorylation by Lyn when this kinase and receptor are co-expressed in CHO cells. Lyn expressed in CHO cells has a substantially higher specific activity than Lyn in RBL cells because of high levels of phosphorylation at its active site Tyr-397 (Fig. 1). Enhanced Lyn kinase activity in the CHO cells leads to spontaneous phosphorylation of multiple cellular proteins, including FcϵRI (Fig. 1). Co-expression of PTPα results in marked dephosphorylation of Lyn in these cells, thereby suppressing basal phosphorylation of several substrates while enabling stimulated phosphorylation of FcϵRI (Fig. 2). Our previous studies reveal that active Lyn in RBL mast cells is largely sequestered in lipid rafts, and this Lyn is active because of phosphorylation at its active site (13Young R.M. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20746-20752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In light of this, we investigated whether segregation of Lyn from a transmembrane phosphatase by lipid rafts is important for the regulation of Lyn activity. CHO-FcϵRI cells provide a useful vehicle to test this possibility, because Lyn in these cells is less effectively regulated than in RBL cells. We determined that PTPα is excluded from lipid rafts, and thus is unable to gain access to and inactivate Lyn within the ordered raft environment. In clear contrast, targeting chimeric PM-PTPα to lipid rafts abolishes stimulation-dependent FcϵRI phosphorylation by inactivating Lyn both within and outside of the raft environment (Fig. 3). These results support a model in which lipid rafts act both to protect Lyn from phosphatases, which keeps raft-associated Lyn active, and to inhibit productive interactions of FcϵRI with active Lyn until cross-linking by multivalent antigen brings them together by driving raft association of FcϵRI. Cross-linking FcϵRI in this manner may also serve to stabilize ordered membrane domains containing active Lyn. Metzger and colleagues (26Mao S.Y. Metzger H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14067-14073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 27Peirce M. Metzger H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34976-34982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) have argued against a role for lipid rafts in protecting FcϵRI from dephosphorylation in studies that utilized the reversal of antigen cross-linking by a monovalent hapten to observe rapid dephosphorylation of FcϵRI and other phosphorylation substrates. However, the reversal of cross-linking causes a rapid reversal of FcϵRI lateral immobilization (28Menon A.K. Holowka D. Webb W.W. Baird B. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 541-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and the loss of its lipid raft association (10Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4276-4280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), so that the dephosphorylation of FcϵRI due to hapten addition probably occurs outside of the lipid rafts and leads to dephosphorylation of more downstream substrates. Furthermore, the role of lipid rafts in protecting Lyn kinase from dephosphorylation was not evaluated by Metzger and colleagues (26Mao S.Y. Metzger H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14067-14073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 27Peirce M. Metzger H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34976-34982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and this is probably at least as important as protection of FcϵRI from dephosphorylation based on the current results. Torigoe and Metzger (15Torigoe C. Metzger H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4016-4025Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) originally described spontaneous phosphorylation of stably expressed FcϵRI by stably co-expressed Lyn in CHO cells. These authors attributed this to differential glycosylation of FcϵRI between CHO and RBL cells after detecting no other differences in physical and biochemical properties of FcϵRI or Lyn in these two cell types. Using a different assay for Lyn kinase activity, we found substantial differences in immunoprecipitated Lyn activity (Fig. 1B). In addition, we have characterized tyrosine phosphorylation in whole cell lysates, which shows high basal phosphorylation of multiple proteins independent of FcϵRI expression (Figs. 1A, 2A, and data not shown). Previous studies on PTPα largely focused on its positive regulation of Src kinase activity in fibroblasts because of dephosphorylation of Src C-terminal tyrosine (19Pallen C.J. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2003; 3: 821-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Our present findings demonstrating negative regulation of Lyn kinase activity by dephosphorylation of its active site tyrosine were unanticipated by these studies. Ng et al. (29Ng D.H. Jabali M.D. Maiti A. Borodchak P. Harder K.W. Brocker T. Malissen B. Jirik F.R. Johnson P. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) reported little phosphatase activity of PTPα relative to CD45 toward a phosphorylated peptide mimic of the C terminus of Fyn in vitro. They found that PTPα had a lower Km toward phosphorylated peptide mimics of the active site versus the C terminus of Src in vitro, suggesting that PTPα is not generally restricted to the dephosphorylation of the negative regulatory site. Our preliminary results indicated that PTPϵ, which is highly homologous to PTPα, also reconstitutes antigen-stimulated signaling in CHO cells by negatively regulating Lyn (data not shown). Other transmembrane phosphatases may likewise negatively regulate Lyn kinase outside of lipid rafts in a redundant fashion, suppressing spontaneous signaling and complementing the negative role of C-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation in different cell types and for different Src family members (30Veillette A. Latour S. Davidson D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 669-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). SHP-1 and CD45, two common hematopoietic phosphatases, do not reconstitute regulated FcϵRI phosphorylation in CHO cells (Fig. 4). Both phosphatases are often implicated for regulating signaling through FcϵRI and other members of the multichain immune recognition receptor family, and SHP-1 is reported to negatively regulate FcϵRI signaling in RBL mast cells (23Xie Z.H. Zhang J. Siraganian R.P. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1521-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Similar to PTPα, we found that SHP-1 dephosphorylates the active site tyrosine of Lyn expressed in CHO-FcϵRI cells (Fig. 4) consistent with results previously reported in B cells (31Somani A.K. Yuen K. Xu F. Zhang J. Branch D.R. Siminovitch K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1938-1944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Unlike PTPα, SHP-1 is a cytosolic phosphatase and is not excluded from lipid rafts, allowing it to dephosphorylate Lyn regardless of its membrane environment, thus preventing stimulated FcϵRI phosphorylation in the CHO-FcϵRI cells, similar to results with raft-targeted PM-PTPα (Fig. 3). These results are consistent with a model in which SHP-1 generally suppresses spontaneous receptor phosphorylation by Lyn in resting cells (32Coggeshall K.M. Nakamura K. Phee H. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 39: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Following cell activation, SHP-1 is recruited to phosphorylated ITIM sequences by its SH2 domains, where it has a more targeted role in dephosphorylating ITAMs on FcϵRI or at the active site of Lyn (33Wang L.L. Blasioli J. Plas D.R. Thomas M.L. Yokoyama W.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1318-1323PubMed Google Scholar). Its strong suppression of stimulated FcϵRI phosphorylation in the present experiments may be the result of relatively high expression levels, but reduced expression of this phosphatase also did not confer a differential effect on stimulated versus unstimulated FcϵRI phosphorylation as seen with PTPα (data not shown). In contrast, CD45 is largely excluded from lipid rafts (24Rodgers W. Rose J.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1515-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), like PTPα, but its expression in CHO cells causes small increases in spontaneous and stimulated FcϵRI phosphorylation (Fig. 4). We found that CD45 preferentially dephosphorylates Lyn at its negative regulatory site, Tyr-508, which likely leads to an increase in Lyn activity, causing enhanced FcϵRI phosphorylation. This suggests that CD45 is primarily a positive regulator of Lyn activity, in agreement with evidence showing that high levels of CD45 expression in RBL cells leads to increased degranulation following antigen stimulation (34Murakami K. Sato S. Nagasawa S. Yamashita T. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that CD45 is not required for FcϵRI signaling in RBL mast cells (35Swieter M. Berenstein E.H. Siraganian R.P. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5330-5336PubMed Google Scholar, 36Schneider H. Korn M. Haustein D. Immunol. Investig. 1993; 22: 503-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and our results are consistent with these findings. In other studies, the expression of lipid raft-targeted chimeric phosphatases from either SHP-1 or CD45 were used to investigate the role of tyrosine phosphatase segregation from lipid rafts in T cell receptor signaling (37He X. Woodford-Thomas T.A. Johnson K.G. Shah D.D. Thomas M.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 2578-2587Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 38Kosugi A. Sakakura J. Yasuda K. Ogata M. Hamaoka T. Immunity. 2001; 14: 669-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 39Su M.W. Yu C.L. Burakoff S.J. Jin Y.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3975-3982Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). All of these studies reported inhibition of downstream signaling because of the raft-targeted chimeric phosphatases, and, in one study, an inhibition of stimulated receptor phosphorylation was observed (39Su M.W.

These studies, together with our results, suggest that the exclusion of membrane-associated tyrosine phosphatases from the ordered lipid environment of lipid rafts may be a general mechanism for the regulation of immunoreceptor signaling. Scharenberg et al. (40Scharenberg A.M. Lin S. Cuenod B. Yamamura H. Kinet J.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3385-3394Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) showed that regulated FcϵRI phosphorylation could be reconstituted in NIH3T3 cells upon co-expression of Lyn. These authors concluded that non-hematopoietic phosphatases present in NIH3T3 cells sufficiently regulate FcϵRI signaling. PTPα is ubiquitously expressed and may be relevant to this regulation in NIH3T3 cells (41Zheng X.M. Resnick R.J. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 964-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). We have detected endogenous PTPα in both the CHO-FcϵRI and RBL-2H3 cells by immunoblotting; its endogenous expression in the CHO-FcϵRI cells is generally less than that in RBL cells or when this phosphatase is transfected into CHO cells (Fig. 3B, and data not shown). Although it is possible that transfected PTPα is expressed to levels that overcome normal limits to its substrate specificity, we found that transfected PTPα functions consistently in reconstituting regulated FcϵRI phosphorylation over a wide range of expression levels in the CHO-FcϵRI cells, including levels approaching those of endogenous PTPα in these cells (data not shown). Regulation of PTPα activity by dimerization (42den Jiang G. Hertog J. Su J. Noel J. Sap J. Hunter T. Nature. 1999; 401: 606-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) or other mechanisms may also influence its functional capacity in addition to effects of differential expression. The role of PTPα, or related transmembrane tyrosine phosphatases, in FcϵRI signaling in mast cells remains to be established. From this study it is clear that PTPα can regulate Lyn kinase in a manner that enables robust tyrosine phosphorylation of FcϵRI in response to cross-linking by an antigen. Our results demonstrate that phosphatase location in the plasma membrane and its substrate specificity are both important to the control of signal initiation via FcϵRI. Unlike SHP-1 and CD45, PTPα fulfills both criteria, but it may be only one of several such phosphatases responsible for regulating Lyn kinase activity in mast cells and other hematopoietic cells in which Lyn plays important physiological roles.

https://openalex.org/W2075889889,"Dentin sialoprotein (DSP) is a glycoprotein that is critical for proper tooth dentin formation, but little is known about the nature of its carbohydrate attachments and other post-translational modifications. We have isolated DSP from pig dentin and demonstrate that it is a proteoglycan. Polyclonal antibodies were raised in chicken against recombinant pig DSP, and used to identify native DSP in fractions of tooth dentin proteins extracted from developing pig molars. Amino acid analyses and characterization of lysylendopeptidase cleavage products confirmed that the purified protein was DSP, and that Arg391 is at the DSP C terminus. On SDS-PAGE and on urea gels, DSP appeared as a smear extending from 280 to 100 kDa, but in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol the top of the DSP smear disappeared. The high molecular weight material was likely comprised of covalent DSP dimers connected by a disulfide bridge at Cys205. Oligosaccharides were released from DSP following N- and O-linked glycosidase digestions, but these digestions had little effect on the apparent molecular weight of DSP on SDS-PAGE, when compared with the significant reduction following chondroitinase ABC digestion. Glycosaminoglycanases with assorted glycosaminoglycan (GAG) cleavage specificities coupled with Western analyses of the cleaved GAG “stubs” demonstrated that the DSP GAG attachments contain chondroitin 6-sulfate, but not keratan sulfate, heparan sulfate, chondroitin, or chondroitin 4-sulfate. DSP binds biotin-labeled hyaluronic acid, and such binding is inhibited by the addition of unlabeled hyaluronic acid. We conclude that DSP is a proteoglycan and that GAG attachments are the predominant structural feature of porcine DSP.

As of this writing, eight mutations have been identified in the human DSPP gene that cause hereditary dentin defects (3Malmgren B. Lindskog S. Elgadi A. Norgren S. Hum.

Occasionally the condition is associated with progressive neurosensory high frequency hearing loss (DFNA39/DGI1, MIM 605594). In addition, DSPP-null mice developed dentin defects in the absence of other symptoms (8Sreenath T. Thyagarajan T. Hall B. Longenecker G. D'Souza R. Hong S. Wright J.T. MacDougall M. Sauk J. Kulkarni A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24874-24880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Whereas it is known that DSPP gene products are essential for normal dentin biomineralization, DSP structural features are only partially characterized, and its functions are unknown.Much of our current understanding of the structure and function of dentin sialoprotein comes from studies of the rat protein (9Ritchie H.H. Hou H. Veis A. Butler W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3698-3702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Butler W.T. Brunn J.C. Qin C. McKee M.D. Connect.

Rat DSP is the N-terminal portion of DSPP and is generated by proteolytic cleavages, primarily after Tyr421 but also following His406 (12Qin C. Cook R.G. Orkiszewski R.S. Butler W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 904-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of the major rat DSP component, which contains 29.6% carbohydrate, was determined by sedimentation equilibrium analysis to be 52.57 kDa (13Butler W.T. Bhown M. Brunn J.C. D'souza R.N. Farach-Carson M.C. Happonen R-P. Schrohenloher R.E. Seyer J.M. Somerman M.J. Foster R.A. Tomana M. van Dijk S. Matrix. 1992; 12: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), although the glycoprotein has an apparent molecular mass of 95 kDa on SDS-PAGE (14Butler W.T. Bhown M. Dimuzio M.T. Linde A. Coll. Relat. Res. 1981; 1: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Most recently, higher molecular mass forms of rat DSP (designated HMW-DSP) have been detected. Rat HMW-DSP has 10.3 phosphates per molecule whereas DSP has 6.2. The majority of the carbohydrates attached to the protein backbone are by N-linked glycosylations (15Qin C. Brunn J.C. Baba O. Wygant J.N. McIntyre B.W. Butler W.T. Eur. J. Oral Sci. 2003; 111: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the rat HMW-DSP may contain GAG chains and/or considerable amounts of sulfate, but these ideas have not been tested experimentally (16Qin C. Baba O. Butler W.T. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 2004; 15: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar).DSPP is expressed primarily during dentin formation (17Butler W.T. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 145: 290-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 18Butler W.T. Oper. Dent. 1992; 5: 18-23PubMed Google Scholar), and in bone (19Qin C. Brunn J.C. Cadena E. Ridall A.

The extracellular matrices of dentin and bone share a similar inventory of noncollagenous proteins, but show differences in the relative quantities of specific protein components and in the way they are processed by proteases. DSP and DPP are the only extracellular constituents that appear to be more abundant in dentin than in bone (22Qin C. Brunn J.C. Jones J. George A. Ramachandran A. Gorski J.P. Butler W.T. Eur. J. Oral Sci. 2001; 109: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). DSPP mRNA has also been detected in the inner ear. The finding of progressive neurosensory hearing loss in some DGI patients suggests that DSPP gene products may play an important role in processes not yet identified (5Xiao S. Yu C. Chou X. Yuan W. Wang Y. Bu L. Fu G. Qian M. Yang J. Shi Y. Hu L. Han B. Wang Z. Huang W. Liu J. Chen Z. Zhao G. Kong X. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), and these processes may or may not involve biomineralization. Rat DSP is not an effective nucleator of hydroxyapatite (HA) formation in vitro, and has low affinity for seed crystals (23Boskey A. Spevak L. Tan M. Doty S.B. Butler W.T. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2000; 67: 472-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), suggesting that DSP is unlikely to regulate mineralization directly. Given the fact that the function of dentin sialophosphoprotein is currently unknown, isolating DSP from other organisms besides rat and characterizing its structural properties might highlight conserved structural features and provide insights into its potential functions.Previously we cloned and characterized a cDNA encoding porcine DSP (24Yamakoshi Y. Hu J.C. Liu S. Zhang C. Oida S. Fukae M. Simmer J.P. Eur. J. Oral Sci. 2003; 111: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This provided us with the entire porcine DSP-derived amino acid sequence, and the mRNA code needed for the expression of recombinant protein. Here we report the expression of recombinant porcine DSP in bacteria and the generation of a polyclonal antibody (Ab) able to specifically detect DSP in dentin extracts. We have used this Ab to devise methods to isolate native DSP from developing pig teeth. Finally, we have performed a number of procedures to characterize the post-translational modifications of porcine DSP, and prove that porcine DSP is proteoglycan, with chondroitin 6-sulfate being the predominant glycan attachment. We provide evidence that DSP forms covalent dimers, connected by a disulfide bridge. We have identified the proteolytic cleavage site that releases DSP from the parent protein and show that porcine DSP can bind hyaluronic acid.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAll experimental procedures involving the use of animals were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Program at the University of Michigan.Expression of DSP in Bacteria Using the pGEX4T-1 Vector—The pig DSP cDNA (24Yamakoshi Y. Hu J.C. Liu S. Zhang C. Oida S. Fukae M. Simmer J.P. Eur. J. Oral Sci. 2003; 111: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-AGTCGACTCATTCCAGTTCCTCAAATCAAG (forward) and 5′-AGCGGCCGCTTCATAAACTAACCTTATCTT (reverse), which introduced unique SalI and NotI restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the DSP coding region. The amplification product was purified from an agarose gel, ligated into the TA cloning vector (pCR2.1-TOPO, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and transfected into bacteria. The recombinant plasmid was isolated and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The pig DSP coding sequence was excised with SalI and NotI, and subcloned into the pGEX4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) restricted with the same enzymes. The expression construct was transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The bacteria were cultured in NZCYM/Amp medium, and DSP expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalatopyranoside to a final concentration of 1.0 mm. The bacteria were cultured for 5 additional hours, and the cell pellet was collected by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in BugBuster reagent (Novagen, Madison, WI) and Protease Inhibitor Mixture Set II (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) using 5 ml of reagent and 120 μl of mixture per gram of wet cell paste at room temperature. The resupension was mixed with 25 units of benzonase per ml of BugBuster regent and was incubated for 20 min at the room temperature. Insoluble cell material was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was directly mixed into GST-Bind Resin, which was equilibrated with GST Bind/Wash buffer.Purification of Recombinant DSP—The GST-Bind Resin was suspended and transferred to a column. The column was washed with 10 volumes of GST Bind/Wash buffer, and the bound protein (i.e. GST-DSP) was eluted with 3 volumes of GST Elute buffer. The eluate was dialyzed against the distilled water and lyophilized. The lyophilized sample (14.5 mg) was dissolved in 5 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2 buffer (pH 8.4) and was incubated with 15 units of thrombin (Novagen) for 16 h at room temperature. The reaction mixture was fractionated on a TSK-gel phenyl-5PW RP-HPLC column (TOSOH, Tokyo, Jpn) using a flow rate of 1 ml/min of 0–100% buffer B over 40 min (buffer A; 50 mm ammonia water, and buffer B; A+80% acetonitrile). The recombinant DSP eluted in the third peak, was lyophilized, and stored at -80 °C.Production of DSP Antibody—Porcine recombinant DSP antibody was produced by Lampire Biological Laboratories (Pipersville, PA). The purified recombinant DSP (1.5 mg) was emulsified with Freund's complete adjuvant (first injection) or incomplete adjuvant (booster injections) and used to immunize a chicken. After two injections, eggs were collected and specific IgY antibodies were purified by the affinity chromatography. The titer of this purified Ab, as estimated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), was 1:17,000. This polyclonal antibody was used in subsequent Western blot analyses to identify DSP-containing fractions from developing porcine molars.Teeth Preparation—Tooth germs of permanent molars were surgically extracted with a hammer and chisel from the maxillae and mandibles of 16 six-month-old pigs, within minutes of each animal's termination at the Michigan State University Meat Laboratory (East Lansing, MI). The soft tissue was removed, and the hard tissue was quickly frozen in dry ice. All subsequent preparation steps were carried out at 4 °C or on ice or on dry ice. Dental enamel was removed by scraping 55 molars with a curette. Each molar crown was separately embedded in paraffin with the dentin side facing up.Extraction of Porcine DSP from Developing Pig Teeth—All extraction steps were carried out at 4 °C or on ice and Protease Inhibitor Mixture Set III (1 mm AEBSF, 0.8 μm aprotinin, 50 μm bestatin, 15 μm E-64, 20 μm leupeptin, and 10 μm pepstatin) (Calbiochem) and 1 mm 1,10-phenanthroline (Sigma) were added into the buffer during the extraction. Dentin was first washed with Milli-Q water for 1 day. Dentin protein “G extract” was obtained by sequential extraction with 50 mm Tris-HCl/4 M guanidine buffer (pH 7.4) for each of 5 days and then combined. Then “E extract” was obtained by sequential extraction with 50 mm Tris-HCl/4 m guanidine/0.5 M EDTA buffer (pH 7.4) for 7 days, changing the buffer everyday, and then combined. The G and E extracts were centrifuged at 7,000 × g, and then desalted and concentrated using the combination of a Spectra/Por 3 membrane (Spectrum Laboratories Inc., Rancho Dominguez, CA) with a YM-3 membrane (Amicon, Beverly, MA), and were lyophilized and stored at -80 °C.Isolation and Purification of Porcine DSP—The lyophilized E extract (100 mg) was dissolved in 10 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl/6 M urea buffer (pH 7.4), and fractionated by an anion exchange chromatography with a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (1.6 cm × 20 cm, Amersham Biosciences). The column was equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 6 m urea buffer (pH 7.4) and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0–0.5 m) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 6 m urea buffer (pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/minute at 4 °C. Protein was detected by monitoring the absorbance at 280 nm. Both DSP and DPP eluted in the third peak, which was concentrated with a YM-3 membrane, and further fractionated by hydroxyapatite affinity HPLC using a Beckman System Gold HPLC system equipped with a Bio-Scale CHT5 Ceramic Hydroxyapatite, Type I column (column volume, 5 ml) (Bio-Rad). The column was equilibrated with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) and eluted with a linear gradient of 1.0 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) at flow rate of 1.5 ml/minute at the room temperature. DSP eluted in the second peak, which was concentrated and separated by size exclusion chromatography with a Superdex 200 column (1.6 cm × 60 cm, Amersham Biosciences). The column was equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl/4 m guanidine buffer (pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/minute at 4 °C. DSP eluted in the first peak, was dialyzed and finally purified by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) using the Beckman System Gold HPLC system equipped with a TSK-gel phenyl 5PW-RP column (4.6 mm ID × 7.5 cm, TOSOH). The column was equilibrated with 0.05% ammonia and eluted with linear acetonitrile gradient (5–95%) containing 0.05% ammonia at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/minute at room temperature. DSP eluted in the first and second peaks, was lyophilized and stored at -80 °C.SDS-PAGE—SDS-PAGE was performed using PAGEr® Gold Precast Gels (4–20% gradient, 10% or 7.5% Tris-glycine gels) (Cambrex Bio Science Rockland Inc., Rockland, ME). SDS-PAGE-urea gels contained 10% polyacrylamide and 8 m urea. Samples were dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) with or without 2% β-mercaptoethanol and electrophoresis was carried out using a current of 20 mA for 1.5 h. The gels were stained with Bio-Safe Coomassie (Bio-Rad), Silver Stain Plus (Bio-Rad), or Stains-all (Sigma). The apparent molecular masses of protein bands were estimated by comparison with SeeBlue® Plus2 Pre-Stained standards (Invitrogen).Western Immunoblots—The proteins on electrophoresed gels were electrotransferred onto Hybond-P membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Polyclonal for porcine DSP and monoclonal for each of glycosaminoglycan antibodies were used at dilution of 1:50,000. In the Far-Western analysis of hyaluronic acid binding, biotin-labeled hyaluronic acid (1: 1000) was detected using a horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin conjugate (1:5000, Sigma). The membranes were immunostained by the chemiluminescent detection with ECL Advance™ Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences).Release of N-linked Oligosaccharide Chains by Glycopeptidase A Digestion—Purified DSP (∼0.2 mg) in 0.1 m citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 5.0) was incubated with 1 milliunits of glycopeptidase A (Seikagaku America, East Falmouth, MA) containing Protease Inhibitor Mixture Set II (0.08 mm AEBSF, 6.8 μm of Bestatin, 0.8 μm E-64, 0.35 mm EDTA, and 8 μm pepstatin A) (Calbiochem) at 37 °C for 48 h. At the end of the incubation period, three volumes of ice-cold ethanol were added to the reaction mixture, which was then centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g. Both supernatant and pellet were evaporated to dryness, and the dried samples were stored at -80 °C. An aliquot (20 μg) of the pellet was electrophoresed on 4–20% Tris-glycine gradient gel, and the degradation pattern was confirmed by Stains-all staining and Western immunoblots using the polyclonal anti-DSP antibody.Release of O-linked Oligosaccharide Chains by O-Glycosidase Digestion—The pellet (∼0.2 mg) after the glycopeptidase A digestion in 250 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 5.0) was incubated with 5 milliunits of sialidase Au, 0.5 milliunits of α-(1,3,4)-fucosidase and 2.5 milliunits of O-glycosidase (QA-bio, San Mateo, CA) at 37 °C for 20 h. At the end of the incubation period the reaction was treated as described for the glycopeptidase A digestion.The fluorescence labeling for both N- and O-linked oligosaccharides after glycopeptidase A and O-glycanase digestions was previously described (25Yamakoshi Y. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1995; 56: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The sample was applied to a column of Sephadex G-15 (1.5 × 35 cm, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 10 mm ammonium acetate buffer (pH 6.0) and was eluted with the same buffer. The effluent was continuously monitored by a fluorescence monitor (FP-2020, JASCO, Tokyo, Jpn) using an excitation wavelength of 315 nm and an emission wavelength of 400 nm.Glycosaminoglycanase Digestion of DSP—Four glycosaminoglycanases (protease-free chondroitinase ABC, heparitinase I, keratanase, and keratanase II) and six monoclonal antibodies raised against dermatan sulfate (DS), keratan sulfate (KS), and the stubs formed by partial digestion of chondroitin (ΔCh), chondroitin 4-sulfate (ΔCh-4S), chondroitin 6-sulfate (ΔCh-6S), and heparan sulfate (ΔHS) glycosaminoglycan chains were purchased from Seikagaku America. Each glycosaminoglycanase digestion of glycopeptidase A and O-glycanase-treated DSP (∼50 μg) was separately carried out with 0.2 unit of protease-free chondroitinase ABC in 0.1 ml of 40 mm Tris-HCl/40 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 8.0), 0.005 units of the heparitinase I in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 5 mm CaCl2, 0.05 units of the keratanase in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) or 0.001 units of the keratanase II in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.0) at 37 °C for 24 h, respectively. At the end of each glycosaminoglycanase digestion, an aliquot (10 μg) of the digest was electrophoresed on a 4–20% Trisglycine gradient gel, and the degradation patterns were confirmed by Stains-all staining and/or Western immunoblots using the polyclonal anti-DSP Ab and each of monoclonal anti-proteoglycan antibodies.Digestion of Chondroitinase ABC-treated DSP by Endoproteinase LysC—Digestion of the chondroitinase ABC-treated DSP (0.2 mg) was carried out in 30 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.8) with an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:100 (w/w) at 37 °C for 18 h. After the reaction, the digests were applied to a Discovery C18 column (10 mm ID × 25 cm, SUPELCO, Bellefonte, PA) and fractionated. The column was equilibrated with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid and eluted with a linear acetonitrile gradient (5–95%) containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/minute.Amino Acid Analysis—The purified DSP samples (0.2 mg) were hydrolyzed with 6 n HCl at 115 °C for 16 h. The amino acid analyses were performed using a Beckman Model 7300 automatic amino acid analyzer.Hyaluronic Acid (HyA) Binding Assay—HyA binding assay determined the amount of biotin-labeled hyaluronic acid (bHyA) binding to DSP protein immobilized on a microtiter plate in the presence of competing unlabeled HyA. All dilutions, incubations, and washes for the HyA binding assay were performed in 10 mm sodium acetate, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (pH 5.8) at room temperature unless otherwise stated. Wells of plastic microtiter plates (Linbro/Titertek, ICN FLOW, Bucks, UK) were coated overnight either with 200 μl per well of protein solution in 20 mm carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) or with buffer alone. The coating solution was removed and the plates were washed three times. The plates were blocked by incubation for 90 min at 37 °C with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk (Bio-Rad). The plates were washed three times and 200 μl of 1:1000 diluted bHyA (Sigma), which either contained no HyA or various amounts of human umbilical cord HyA (39 ng to 10 μg) (Sigma), was added to the wells and incubated overnight at room temperature. The plates were washed three times and 200 μl of 1:1000 diluted alkaline phosphatase conjugated ExtrAvidin (Sigma) was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature, followed by three washes. A 10 mg/ml solution of disodium p-nitrophenylphosphate in 100 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2 (pH 9.3)(200 μl) was added to all wells, incubated for 15 min, and the reaction terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 0.2 m NaOH. The absorbance at 405 nm was determined, and all absorbances were corrected against blank wells, which contained substrate solution alone.Optimum amounts of RP2, rpDSP or recombinant pig amelogenin (rP172) used in this assay were determined by coating with a range of protein concentrations (5–800 pmol per well) and binding bHyA in the absence of competitor. On this basis, 600 pmol per well of RP2, 250 pmol per well of rpDSP or 800 pmol per well of rP172 were used in the competition assay.Automated Edman Degradation—Automated Edman degradation was performed with an Applied Biosystems Procise 494 cLC protein sequencer. The purified peptide samples were suspended in 20 μl of 100% trifluoroacetic acid and loaded 100% on the precycled cartridge filter.RESULTSExpression of Recombinant Pig DSP—The first goal in the characterization of porcine dentin sialoprotein was to isolate the protein from developing teeth. Polyclonal antibodies were raised against recombinant pig DSP and used to identify DSP in the various dentin fractions. Recombinant porcine DSP was expressed as a GST-fusion protein in bacteria (Fig. 1). The intact GST-DSP fusion protein was purified by HPLC and affinity chromatography (Fig. 1A). Recombinant DSP was excised from the GST domain by thrombin and purified (Fig. 1, B and C). The final recombinant porcine DSP product had an apparent molecular mass of 65 kDa (Fig. 1B, lane 2). The identity of the purified protein was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing, which gave the sequence GSPEFPGRLIPVPQI (the DSP N-terminal sequence is underlined), as expected. 2 mg of recombinant pig DSP were used to generate specific DSP polyclonal antibodies in chicken.Isolation of Porcine DSP from Developing Molars—Dentin proteins were extracted from developing porcine molars (Fig. 2A) using sequential guanidine (G extract) and guanidine/EDTA (E extract) extractions (26Termine J.D. Belcourt A.B. Miyamoto M.S. Conn K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9769-9772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DSP was identified as a wide band above 250 kDa by Western blot analyses in the E extract (Fig. 2B, lane E). The E extract was first fractionated by anion exchange chromatography using a Q-Sepharose column, which sorted the E extract into 3 well-defined chromatographic peaks (Fig. 2C). DSP was identified in the third peak (Fig. 2D, lane Q3), the contents of which were further fractionated over an HA column. The HA column divided the Q3 component into 3 parts (Fig. 3B, left). After passing the HA2 fraction over with a protein G column to remove immunoglobulins, the three HA fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunostained with the DSP Ab (Fig. 3A). Two major DSP components were detected on the Western blot at ∼280 and 140 kDa. We associated the appearance of the lower DSP band at 140 kDa with the removal of immunoglobulins, which may have blocked immunodetection of this band in previous fractions. This band was not prominent in the previous fractions (compare lanes E and Q3 in Fig. 2, B and C with lane HA2 in Fig. 3A). The smaller immunostained bands, having apparent molecular masses in the 25–30 kDa range (Fig. 3A, HA2), also immunostained in negative controls in which only the secondary antibody was included (Fig. 3D, S2–S3). Fraction HA2 was further separated by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 3, C and D) into four parts. The DSP components were in the first fraction (S1). Several Stains-all-positive proteins, which were not detected by the DSP Ab, were now sufficiently concentrated by the fractionation procedures to be detected in each of the four size exclusion fractions. Stains-all is a cationic carbocyanine dye that stains most proteins red or pink, while Ca2+-binding proteins stain dark blue or purple (27Campbell K.P. MacLennan D.H. Jorgensen A.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11267-11273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Fig. 2Sequential extraction of pig proteins from dentin and anion exchange chromatography.Panel A, hard tissue of a developing pig molar embedded in paraffin.

We present here the crystal structure (at 2.15 Å resolution) of the recombinant, affinity-matured human antibody fragment Fab-Hyb3 bound to the tumor-associated human leukocyte antigen (HLA)/peptide complex HLA-A1·MAGE-A1. Fab-Hyb3 employs a diagonal docking mode resembling that of T cell receptors. However, other than these natural ligands, the antibody uses only four of its six complementarity-determining regions for direct interactions with the target. It recognizes the C-terminal half of the MAGE-A1 peptide, the HLA-A1 α1-helix, and N-terminal residues of the α2-helix, accompanied by a large tilting angle between the two types of molecules within the complex. Interestingly, only a single hydrogen bond between a peptide side chain and Fab-Hyb3 contributes to the interaction, but large buried surface areas with pronounced shape complementarity assure high affinity and specificity for MAGE-A1.

The HLA-A1·MAGE-A1·antibody structure is discussed in comparison with those of natural ligands recognizing HLA·peptide complexes. The adaptive immune system employs two principally different defense mechanisms in response to pathogens. Cell-mediated immune responses involve T cell receptors (TCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: TCR, T cell receptor; HLA, human leukocyte antigen; KIR, killer inhibitory immunoglobulin-like receptor; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; pMHC, major histocompatibility antigen complexed with a peptide; CDR, complementarity determining region; H, antibody heavy chain; L, antibody light chain; MAGE, melanoma-associated antigen; AMF complex, HLA-A1·MAGE-A1·Hyb3 complex; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: TCR, T cell receptor; HLA, human leukocyte antigen; KIR, killer inhibitory immunoglobulin-like receptor; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; pMHC, major histocompatibility antigen complexed with a peptide; CDR, complementarity determining region; H, antibody heavy chain; L, antibody light chain; MAGE, melanoma-associated antigen; AMF complex, HLA-A1·MAGE-A1·Hyb3 complex; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. that recognize proteolytic fragments processed from antigenic proteins in the context of class I or class II major histocompatibility (MHC) molecules (pMHC complexes) expressed on target cells. In contrast, humoral responses are characterized by the production of antibodies that react with individual, usually unprocessed foreign antigens, mostly glycoproteins and polysaccharides. Soluble proteins endowed with a TCR-like specificity have a wide range of potentially useful applications, including direct visualization and quantification of pMHC complexes, and targeted delivery of toxins and drugs (1Engberg J. Krogsgaard M. Fugger L. Immunotechnology. 1999; 4: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Engineering of recombinant TCRs has not been very successful because of the low affinity (in the micromolar range) typically displayed by these molecules toward their targets, as well as a certain incompatibility with regard to manipulation of specificity and affinity (2Wülfing C.

Milstein C. Nature. 1991; 349: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar), it has been exceptionally difficult to identify antibodies with “TCR-like” specificity following immunization procedures (5van Leeuwen A.

However, in vitro selection of antibody fragments from large libraries displayed on the surface of filamentous phage has been shown to overcome the problems associated with the production of pMHC-restricted antibodies through immunization procedures (14Chames P.

Uchanska-Ziegler B. Hoogenboom H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7969-7974Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) capable of binding specifically to a pMHC complex of considerable clinical interest, the tumor-associated HLA-A1·melanoma-associated antigen (MAGE)-A1 complex (17van der Bruggen P. Traversari C. Chomez P. Lurquin C. De Plaen E. van den Eynde B. Knuth A. Boon T. Science. 1991; 254: 1643-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (3104) Google Scholar, 18Maeurer M.J. Storkus W.J. Kirkwood J.M. Lotze M.T. Melanoma Res. 1996; 6: 11-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The initially isolated antibody, Fab-G8, displayed specificity for this pMHC but only moderate affinity. It was therefore subjected to phage display-based affinity maturation and screening to identify clones with a higher affinity and the same specificity (19Chames P. Willemsen R.A. Rojas G. Dieckmann D. Rem L. Schuler G. Bolhuis R.L. Hoogenboom H.R. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 1110-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The best variant of Fab-G8, Fab-Hyb3 (or short, Hyb3), exhibited a much higher affinity (Kd = 14 nm) as compared with G8 (Kd = 250 nm), yet maintained its peptide selectivity according to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests and flow cytometry with phage-bound Fab and in T cell retargeting experiments (19Chames P.

The structural basis of MHC-restricted peptide specificity has been well illustrated for TCRs (21Rudolph M.G. Wilson I.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 52-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), but thus far it remained unclear whether pMHC-specific antibodies would utilize a structurally similar or very different solution to achieve such specificity, in particular in light of their typically higher affinity for pMHC complexes as compared with TCRs. The plethora of different structural modalities described for antibody-antigen interactions (19Chames P. Willemsen R.A. Rojas G. Dieckmann D. Rem L. Schuler G. Bolhuis R.L. Hoogenboom H.R. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 1110-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 22Wilson I.A. Stanfield R.L. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Therefore, we decided to determine the structure of such a high affinity pMHC-restricted antibody in complex with its antigen. In this paper we describe the crystal structure of Hyb3 complexed with its target and discuss the similarities and differences in pMHC binding modes between this reagent and cellular ligands such as TCRs. Protein Production—The MAGE-A1 peptide (EADPTGHSY) was solid phase synthesized and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography or purchased (Alta Bioscience, Birmingham, UK). HLA-A*010101·MAGE-A1 complexes were produced by refolding from Escherichia coli inclusion bodies (25Garboczi D.N. Hung D.T. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3429-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) and purified by gel filtration using a Superdex 75HR column (Amersham Biosciences) as detailed previously (14Chames P. Hufton S.E. Coulie P.G. Uchanska-Ziegler B. Hoogenboom H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7969-7974Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Fab-Hyb3 was expressed as described for Fab-G8 (14Chames P. Hufton S.E. Coulie P.G. Uchanska-Ziegler B. Hoogenboom H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7969-7974Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and recovered from the E. coli cell pellet without the need for mechanical cell disruption by treatment with the mild protein extraction reagent B-PER (Pierce) and DNase I. It was then purified by affinity chromatography and gel filtration on Superdex 75 10/300 GL columns. Purified aliquots of HLA-A1·MAGE-A1 and Hyb3 were mixed at mass ratio 1:0.8, respectively, incubated at room temperature for 30 min, concentrated 4-fold using Millipore Ultrafree ultrafiltration units (Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany), and applied on a Superdex 75HR gel filtration column to remove excessive pMHC. The HLA-A1·MAGE-A1·Fab-Hyb3 (AMF) complex eluted as a symmetric peak with an apparent molecular mass of 94 kDa. SDS-PAGE confirmed the purity of the sample and the presence of all protein chains. The complex was concentrated to 15–20 mg/ml using a Millipore Ultrafree ultrafiltration device and employed for crystallization. Crystallization and Data Collection—All of the crystallization experiments were performed by vapor diffusion using the hanging drop technique at 18 °C. Initially, needle clusters were obtained from a polyethylene glycol 4000-based screen (JBScreen3; Jena Biosciences, Jena, Germany). The crystals were very difficult to reproduce and responded strongly to small changes of the precipitant composition. After optimization, large rod-like clusters with individual rods up to 200 × 40 × 40 μm grew from drops of 0.7 μl of protein and 0.7 μl of precipitant (0.1 m MES, pH 6.5, 19% w/v polyethylene glycol 3350, 600 mm NaCl, 0.5% v/v dioxane). For data collection a suitable crystal was isolated from a cluster, soaked briefly in cryobuffer (precipitant solution plus 10% glycerol), and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. A native data set at 2.15 Å resolution was collected at beam line ID29 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France; λ = 0.9762 Å, MAR CCD detector). All of the measurements were performed at 100 K. The data were processed with the program DENZO and scaled with SCALE-PACK (see Table I) (26Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38446) Google Scholar).Fig. 3Water molecules at the HLA-Fab interface. a shows an enlarged view of the interface region of HLA-A1·MAGE-A1 (binding groove area with the peptide in place) and Hyb3 (variable domains) together with interfacial waters depicted as blue spheres. The color code of the protein complex is given in the legend. All of the residues that changed during the maturation process from G8 to Hyb3 are highlighted with red dots. The box marks the region that is depicted in close-up view in Fig. 4b. b, two-dimensional projection of interface properties of the HLA-A1·MAGE-A1·Hyb3 complex illustrating the atom-to-atom distance between HLA and Fab as small (red) and large (blue) (see legend).

In c the residue polarity similarity is mapped on the two-dimensional surface projection. The interface is characterized mainly by polar interactions.

As assessed from the Matthews coefficient, two complexes (I and II) were expected in the asymmetric unit (VM = 2.1 Da/Å3). HLA molecule (I) was unequivocally localized with a peptide-stripped HLA-A2 model (Protein Data Bank code 1duz) using Molrep from the CCP4 program suite (27Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19733) Google Scholar). With molecule (I) fixed, HLA molecule (II) could be localized. After rigid body refinement (Refmac (27Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19733) Google Scholar)), the R/Rfree was 0.49/0.50. Hyb3 was located using a data base of 125 intact Fabs as search models. With AmoRe (27Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19733) Google Scholar) Fab (I) was localized (with the two HLA molecules fixed) with Protein Data Bank code 7fab as search model. Because Fab (II) could not be unambiguously localized, the search was carried out with all Fab search models split into their variable and constant domains. Now the variable domain of Protein Data Bank code 2gfb was located, and subsequently a solution for the constant domain of Protein Data Bank code 2fb4 was found. This initial model was subjected to simulated annealing and energy minimization using CNS (28Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J.

Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 173-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), and restrained maximum-likelihood refinement with Refmac. Noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were not applied at any time during refinement. Water molecules were included on the basis of peak heights (>2.5 σ in Fo - Fc density maps) with ARP/wARP and manual fitting. After translation, libration, screw rotation refinement (31Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar), the R value converged at 0.183 (Rfree = 0.248) at 2.15 Å resolution. During structure determination, Rfree served to control the process of convergence. The final model comprises 1632 protein and peptide residues, 653 water molecules, and 4 glycerol molecules. The stereochemistry of the refined structure was validated with Procheck (32Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and Whatcheck (33Hooft R.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1798) Google Scholar).

General Features of the HLA-A1·MAGE-A1·Hyb3 Complex— Crystals of the AMF complex diffracted synchrotron radiation to 2.15 Å resolution. The structure was determined by molecular replacement and refined to R/Rfree values of 0.18/0.25 (Table I). There are two AMF complexes (I and II) per asymmetric unit, related by 2-fold noncrystallographic symmetry, and unless otherwise stated, the description and discussion will focus on complex I. The HLA-A*010101 (or short, HLA-A1) heavy chain, β2-microglobulin, peptide, and Hyb3 heavy and light chains will be designated with chain identifiers A, B, P, H, L, respectively. Hyb3 H and L chains are numbered following the standard Kabat convention. Most parts of the structure are well ordered with only two HLA-A1 loops (Ala15–Ala20 and Ala223–Ala228), the N-terminal Met of β2-microglobulin, and Hyb3 residues His196–His200 displaying substantial flexibility. The overall topography of the HLA-A1·MAGE-A1 complex (Fig. 1, a and b) corresponds to previously determined pMHC structures (36Madden D.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 587-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). The MAGE-A1 peptide (EADPTGHSY, P1–P9) was modeled into the electron density without ambiguity (Fig. 1c). Its middle section (P4–P7) is only loosely bound to the peptide-binding groove of HLA-A1, a feature shared with most but not all pMHC class I complexes (36Madden D.R. Annu. Rev.

A substantial amount of stabilization comes from water molecules in the proximity of the peptide that mediate additional contacts to the HLA-A1 heavy chain and the peptide. The HLA-A1·MAGE-A1 complex presents a relatively flat antigenic surface, because only one side chain (SerP8) points directly into the solvent (Fig. 1), whereas ProP4 and HisP7, although solvent-accessible, hardly protrude above the binding groove. The Interface of HLA-A1·MAGE-A1 and Hyb3—The contribution to the binding interface is not distributed equally among the H and L chains of Hyb3 but in a 2-1 ratio. The complementarity determining region (CDR) loop CDR-H1 recognizes residues of the α1-helix and CDR-L3 interacts with both α-helices of HLA-A1·MAGE-A1, whereas CDR-H2 and CDR-H3 exhibit an intermediate position in that they contact both the peptide and the α1-helix. Marginal contributions come from CDR-L1 and CDR-L2 (in each case, distances >3.8 Å). The most important interactions between Fab and pMHC are mediated by CDR-H3. This loop is rich in aromatic amino acids (98FHYYYY100C) (Fig. 2, a and b) and forms a clamp over the α1-helix with PheH98, TyrH100B, and TyrH100C on the external and HisH99 and TyrH100A on the internal side of the peptide binding groove (Fig. 2b). Solvent molecules are absent from this part of the interface, indicating strict shape complementarity. Residues with a buried surface area of >60 Å2 are PheH98, HisH99, TyrH100A, TyrH100B, and TyrH100C from CDR-H3, as well as ArgA65 and GlnA72 from HLA-A1 (Fig. 2a and Tables II, III, and IV). In addition, HisH99 and TyrH100A are not only in contact with the α1-helix but are also hydrogen-bonded to the peptide, either directly or via buried water molecules (Fig. 2, b and c). The conformation of the CDR-H3 loop is further stabilized by an interaction between CDR-H1 and the HLA-A1 heavy chain, because AspH30 and AspH31 form hydrogen bonds with ArgA65 (Table II), thereby positioning it such that PheH98 of CDR-H3 can pack hydrophobically against the aliphatic section of the ArgA65 side chain. These interactions bury more than 100 Å2 of ArgA65 surface area (Fig. 2a) and can be expected to provide a substantial contribution to the affinity of Hyb3 toward the HLA-A1·MAGE-A1 complex. A number of hydrogen bonds to the MAGE-A1 peptide are formed by the CDR-H2 loop (Fig. 2, a and c, and Table III), mostly to the peptide backbone, either directly or mediated by interconnecting water molecules. Furthermore, this loop provides the sole contact to the central region of the α2-helix (Fig. 2c and Table II). Another important component contributing to the interaction of HLA-A1·MAGE-A1 and Hyb3 is CDR-L3, which spans across the end of the binding groove where the peptide C terminus is located (Fig. 2, a and d, and Table II). It includes a salt bridge from AspL95A to LysA146.Table IIDirect contacts (≤3.5 Å) between Hyb3 and HLA-A1 heavy chainHyb3 elementHyb3 contact atomHLA-A1 contact atomDistanceÅHydrogen bonds CDR-H1AspH30 OArgA65 NH12.9AspH30 OD1ArgA65 NH13.4AspH31 OD1ArgA65 NH13.0 CDR-H2GlyH55 OGlnA155 NE23.1 CDR-H3PheH98 NGlnA72 OE13.0HisH99 NE2AlaA69 O2.6HisH99 NE2ThrA73 OG12.9TyrH100A OHThrA73 OG12.7TyrH100C OHGlnA72 O2.6 CDR-L3SerL93 OGThrA80 OG12.5SerL93 OLysA146 NZ2.7ArgL94 OArgA145 NH23.2AspL95A OD1LysA146 NZ3.1van der Waals' interactions CDR-H3TyrH100B CGAlaA76 CB3.5 CDR-L3SerL93 CBTyr80A CG23.5AspL95A CGLysA146 CE3.5 Open table in a new tab Table IIIHydrogen bonds (≤3.5 Å) between Hyb3 and MAGE-A1 peptideHyb3 elementHyb3 contact atomPeptide contact atomDistanceÅCDR-H2AsnH53 ND2ProP4 O2.8GlyH55 OHisP7 NE23.3CDR-H3TyrH100A OHGlyP6 O3.1TyrH100A OHHisP7 N3.2 Open table in a new tab Table IVWater-bridged contacts (≤3.5 Å) between Hyb3 and HLA-A1·MAGE-A1 complexHyb3 elementHyb3 contact atomWater moleculepMHC contact atomDistancesÅCDR-H2TrpH52A NE1Wat X4ProP4 O3.3/2.7AsnH53 OD1Wat S37GlyP6 N2.8/2.9SerH56 OGWat S40SerP8 N2.8/3.0CDR-H3HisH99 ND2Wat S36GlyP6 O2.8/2.8HisH99 NE2Wat Z43Ala69 O3.4/3.2CDR-L2GlyL68 NWat Z55GluA89 OD13.0/2.6 Open table in a new tab The resolution of the AMF data set was sufficient to permit the identification of 653 water molecules, of which six are completely buried in the AMF interface (Table IV) and contribute substantially to the high shape complementarity. The median value of the shape complementarity statistic (Sc) is a measure of the geometric match at protein-protein interfaces (40Lawrence M.C. Coleman P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 946-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). For the AMF complex, Sc is 0.69 excluding and 0.72 including water molecules in the interface. These values are very close to those from the two structures of killer inhibitory immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) complexed with HLA-C (0.69 and 0.71, respectively) (41Boyington J.C. Motyka S.A.

Additional water molecules in clefts and crevices near the interacting surfaces mediate further hydrogen bonds and extend the protein·protein interface (Fig. 3a). The importance of the bound water molecules is also evident from a two-dimensional projection of the atom-to-atom distance (Fig. 3b) and the polarity (Fig. 3c) of the interface. Hyb3 is the outcome of a complex in vitro affinity maturation process (19Chames P. Willemsen R.A. Rojas G. Dieckmann D. Rem L. Schuler G. Bolhuis R.L. Hoogenboom H.R. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 1110-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), starting from the lower affinity Fab-G8 (14Chames P. Hufton S.E. Coulie P.G. Uchanska-Ziegler B. Hoogenboom H.R. Proc. Natl.

In the absence of a structure for Fab-G8, it is difficult to assess which individual mutations contribute most to the affinity increase of Hyb3. There are only two amino acid substitutions between the H chains of G8 and Hyb3 (both in the CDR-H3 region; Fig. 4a), but neither of them is directly involved in contacting the HLA-A1·MAGE-A1 complex (Fig. 2a and Tab"
https://openalex.org/W1998453609,"In Crithidia fasciculata the biosynthesis of trypanothione (N1,N8-bis(glutathionyl)spermidine; reduced trypanothione), a redox mediator unique to and essential for pathogenic trypanosomatids, was assumed to be achieved by two distinct enzymes, glutathionylspermidine synthetase and trypanothione synthetase (TryS), and only the first one was adequately characterized. We here report that the TryS of C. fasciculata, like that of Trypanosoma species, catalyzes the entire synthesis of trypanothione, whereas its glutathionylspermidine synthetase appears to be specialized for Gsp synthesis. A gene (GenBank™ accession number AY603101) implicated in reduced trypanothione synthesis of C. fasciculata was isolated from genomic DNA and expressed in Escherichia coli as His-tagged or Nus fusion proteins. The expression product proved to be a trypanothione synthetase (Cf-TryS) that also displayed a glutathionylspermidine synthetase, an amidase, and marginal ATPase activity. The dual specificity of the Cf-TryS preparations was not altered by removal of the tags. Steady-state kinetic analysis of Cf-TryS yielded a pattern that was compatible with a concerted substitution mechanism, wherein the enzyme forms a ternary complex with Mg2+-ATP and GSH to phosphorylate GSH and then ligates the glutathionyl residue to glutathionylspermidine. Limiting Km values for GSH, Mg2+-ATP, and glutathionylspermidine were 407, 222, and 480 μm, respectively, and the kcat was 8.7 s-1 for the TryS reaction. Mutating Arg-553 or Arg-613 to Lys, Leu, Gln, or Glu resulted in marked reduction or abrogation (R553E) of activity. Limited proteolysis with factor Xa or trypsin resulted in cleavage at Arg-556 that was accompanied by loss of activity. The presence of substrates, in particular of ATP and GSH alone or in combination, delayed proteolysis of wild-type Cf-TryS and Cf-TryS R553Q but not in Cf-TryS R613Q, which suggests dynamic interactions of remote domains in substrate binding and catalysis.

Crithidia fasciculata has been the most convenient model organism to work out the metabolic pathways that are typical of human pathogens such as Trypanosoma and Leishmania species. The latter comprise the causative agents of African sleeping sickness, Chagas disease, Kala Azar, oriental sore, which, despite causing more than half a million annual fatalities, are considered the most neglected diseases in terms of affordable, safe, and efficient therapy (www.accessmed-msf.org). A common feature of trypanosomatids is their ability to transform glutathione into trypanothione (T(SH)2), 1The abbreviations used are: T(SH)2, reduced trypanothione; TXN, tryparedoxin; TXN-Px, tryparedoxin peroxidase; TryS, trypanothione synthetase; Gsp, glutathionylspermidine; GspS, glutathionylspermidine synthetase; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; RT, room temperature. 1The abbreviations used are: T(SH)2, reduced trypanothione; TXN, tryparedoxin; TXN-Px, tryparedoxin peroxidase; TryS, trypanothione synthetase; Gsp, glutathionylspermidine; GspS, glutathionylspermidine synthetase; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; RT, room temperature. which is the bisglutathionyl derivative of spermidine. T(SH)2 has been shown to be of pivotal importance for the vitality and virulence of Trypanosoma brucei brucei and Leishmania donovani by knock-out or knock-down of trypanothione reductase, the enzyme regenerating T(SH)2 from its oxidized cyclic disulfide form (1Krieger S.

Fairlamb A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5311-5316Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). More recently, the significance of T(SH)2 in the defense against oxidative stress and for the maintenance of viability and proliferation in T. brucei was corroborated by knocking down trypanothione synthetase (TryS) by double strand RNA interference (3Comini M. Guerrero S.A. Haile S. Menge U. Lu ̈nsdorf H. Flohé L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 1289-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The indispensability of T(SH)2 is, in part at least, explained by its specific action on tryparedoxins (TXN), which are multipurpose oxidoreductases related to thioredoxin. T(SH)2-reduced TXN is the reducing substrate of a peroxiredoxin-type peroxidase (TXN-Px) in all trypanosomatids (4Nogoceke E. Gommel D.U. Kiess M. Kalisz H.M. Flohé L. Biol.

In trypanosomatids the T(SH)2/TXN/TXN-Px system is evidently the functional substitute for the GSH/glutathione peroxidase system (10Flohé L. Brigelius-Flohé R. Hatfield D.L. Selenium. Its Molecular Biology and Role in Human Health. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA2001: 157-178Crossref Google Scholar) that is characteristic of the mammalian hosts. Accordingly, also knock-down of TXN and TXN-Px by double strand RNA interference leads to impaired viability and peroxide resistance of T. brucei (11Wilkinson S.R. Horn D. Radhika Prathalingam S. Kelly J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31640-31646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Although trypanosomatids are also equipped with a typical thioredoxin (12Reckenfelderba ̈umer N. Lu ̈demann H. Schmidt H. Steverding D. Krauth-Siegel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7547-7552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), TXN appears to substitute for thioredoxin in ribonucleotide reduction (13Dormeyer M.

Haile S. Menge U. Lu ̈nsdorf H. Flohé L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 1289-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) or trypanothione reductase (1Krieger S. Schwarz W. Ariyanayagam M.R. Fairlamb A.H. Krauth-Siegel R.L. Clayton C. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 542-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Although the metabolic pathways using T(SH)2 are being elucidated at considerable speed, the equally important biosynthesis of T(SH)2 has remained a matter of debate and confusion since its discovery (14Fairlamb A.H. Cerami A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 14: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The building blocks of trypanothione were soon clarified (15Fairlamb A.H. Blackburn P. Ulrich P. Chait B.T. Cerami A. Science. 1985; 227: 1485-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar); it is formed from spermidine and two molecules of GSH with consumption of two ATP (Fig. 1). The source of spermidine, however, differs between species. In T. brucei, it is derived from endogenous ornithine, which is decarboxylated to putrescine and further processed to spermidine by aminopropyl transfer from S-adenosylmethionine. Accordingly, the ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor dl-α-difluoromethylornithine proved to be efficacious in African trypanosomiasis (18Schechter P.J. Sjoerdsma A. Parasitol. Today. 1986; 2: 223-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) but not in the Latin American T. cruzi and the fish pathogen Trypanosoma granulosum, which lack ornithine decarboxylase and depend on polyamine uptake (19Ariyanayagam M.R. Fairlamb A.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 20Mastri C. Thorborn D.E. Davies A.J. Ariyanayagam M.R. Hunter K.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 1177-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Species differences are also being discussed for the consecutive glutathionylations of spermidine. A TryS catalyzing both steps of T(SH)2 synthesis was recently identified in T. cruzi (21Oza S.L. Tetaud E. Ariyanayagam M.R. Warnon S.S. Fairlamb A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35853-35861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and the homologous enzyme of T. brucei brucei was also shown to synthesize T(SH)2 from spermidine and GSH (22Comini M. Menge U. Flohé L. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 23Oza S.L. Ariyanayagam M.R. Aitcheson N. Fairlamb A.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 131: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Moreover, knock-down of T. brucei-TryS by means of RNAi verified the hypothesis that this enzyme is responsible for the entire synthesis of the spermidine-conjugated thiols, glutathionylspermidine (Gsp), and T(SH)2 (3Comini M. Guerrero S.A. Haile S. Menge U. Lu ̈nsdorf H. Flohé L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 1289-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Originally T(SH)2 synthesis in C. fasciculata was also reported to be catalyzed by a single protein (16Henderson G.B. Yamaguchi M. Novoa L. Fairlamb A.H. Cerami A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3924-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Later, however, two distinct enzymes, a glutathionylspermidine synthetase (GspS) and a TryS, could be separated by Smith et al. (17Smith K. Nadeau K. Bradley M. Walsh C. Fairlamb A.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 874-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A GspS devoid of TryS activity was also purified from C. fasciculata by Koenig et al. (24Koenig K. Menge U. Kiess M. Wray V.

These apparent discrepancies between T(SH)2 biosynthesis of Crithidia and Trypanosoma species raised concerns whether C. fasciculata was an adequate model organism if the ultimate goal is the design of trypanocidal GspS or TryS inhibitors (21Oza S.L. Tetaud E. Ariyanayagam M.R. Warnon S.S. Fairlamb A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35853-35861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Here we report that the putative TryS gene of C. fasciculata indeed encodes a TryS that, like that of the Trypanosoma species, catalyzes both steps of trypanothione synthesis. Moreover, the yields obtained by heterologous expression of this gene for the first time enabled an in-depth analysis of such prototype of trypanothione synthetase. Isolation of the TryS-encoding Gene from C. fasciculata—Oligonucleotides (see Table I) were designed from the DNA sequence available on the NCBI data base for Cf-TryS (GenBank™ accession number AF006615). In order to isolate and amplify the corresponding gene, PCR (50 μl) was prepared as follows: 5 units of ProofStart DNA Polymerase (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), 1× ProofStart PCR buffer (MgSO4 at a final concentration of 1.5 mm), 300 μm dNTPs, 0.5 μg of chromosomal DNA from C. fasciculata (kindly provided by S. A. Guerrero, Universidad Nacional del Litoral, Argentina), and 3 μm of each primer (Fo Cf-TryS and Re Cf-TryS). The PCR conditions were as follows: 5 min at 95 °C, 35 cycles (95 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 4 min), and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were separated in a 1% agarose gel, purified with MinElute gel extraction kit (Qiagen), and cloned into pCR4-TOPO (TOPO TA cloning kit, Invitrogen). The plasmid thus obtained, pMCTS 1–7, harbors the Cf-TryS coding sequence. Both DNA strands of the insert were sequenced and analyzed by means of the program Vector NTI Suite 6.0 (InforMax Inc., Oxford, UK). The sequence was submitted to NCBI data base (GenBank™ accession number AY603101).Table IOligonucleotides used for isolation, cloning, or generation of mutants of Cf-TryS geneOligonucleotidesSequencesa,Underlined sequences show the restriction sites added bSequences in parentheses denote the codon change performed to obtain the different mutantsRestriction sitesFo CfTryS5′-GCGCGAATTCATGGCGTCCGCTGAGCGTGTG-3′EcoRIRe CfTryS5′-GCGCAAGCTTCTACTCATCCTCGGCGAGCTT-3′HindIIIFo CfTryS N5′-CCCCCCCATATGGCGTCCGCTGAGCGT-3′NdeIRe CfTryS B/H5′-CCCCCCAAGCTTGGATCCCTACTCATCCTCGGCGAG-3′BamHI and HindIIIFo CfTryS (+G)5′-CCCCCCGAATTCGATGGCGTCCGCTGAGCGT-3′EcoRIRe CfTryS B/H 6×H5′-CCCCCCAAGCTTGGATCCCTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGCTCATCCTCGGCGAGCTT-3′BamHI and HindIIIFo TryS R553K, R553L, R553Q, or R553E5′-ATTGTCGGC (AAG) GTCGGCCGC-3′, (CTG), (CAG), or (GAG)Re TryS R553K, R553L, R553Q, or R553E5′-GCGGCCGACC (TTG) CCGACAAT-3′, (AGG), (TGG), or (TCG)Fo TryS R556K, R556L, R556Q, or R556E5′-CGTGTCGGC (AAG) AACGTCACC-3′, (CTG), (CAG), or (GAG)Re TryS R556K, R556L, R556Q, or R556E5′-GGTGACGTTC (TTG) CCGACACG-3′, (AGG), (TGG), or (TCG)Fo TryS R613K, R613L, R613Q, or R613E5′-ACAGGCATT (AAG) GAGGACAAG-3′, (CTG), (CAG), or (GAG)Fo CfTryS-SalI5′-CCCCCCGTCGACGCTGCTGGAGTGT-3′SalIa Underlined sequences show the restriction sites addedb Sequences in parentheses denote the codon change performed to obtain the different mutants Open table in a new tab Construction of Expression Vectors—Plasmids of the pET series (15b, 19b and 43b; Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) were used for heterologous expression. The Cf-TryS gene was engineered by PCR to add suitable restriction sites and tag regions (see Table I). The Cf-TryS gene was cloned into pET 15b and 19b, and NdeI (5′ end) and BamHI (3′end) sites were added. For cloning of Cf-TryS into pET 43b, an EcoRI site (5′ end) and a His6 tag followed by a HindIII site (3′ end) were added. PCR were performed with pMCTS 1–7 as template, proper primer pairs, and TaqPCR Master Mix kit (Qiagen) according to the protocol of the supplier. The PCR program consisted of 5 min at 95 °C, 30 cycles (95 °C for 1 min, 52 °C for 1 min and 72 °C for 4 min), and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Products were separated on a 1% agarose gel and purified by the gel extraction kit (Qiagen). Using T4-DNA ligase (Roche Applied Science), the Cf-TryS gene was ligated to pET 15b, 19b, and 43b, generating pMC10c15, pMC12c1, and pMC8c5, respectively. For all cloning and subcloning steps, Escherichia coli strain DH5-α was used. Heterologous Expression and Purification of Recombinant Cf-TryS— The plasmids pMC10c15, pMC12c1, and pMC8c5 were heterologously expressed in the E. coli strain Tuner-DE3 grown aerobically in Terrific Broth medium supplemented with 20 g·liter-1 glucose and 200 μg·ml-1 ampicillin, at 180 rpm and 37 °C. At A600 nm of 1–1.5, cultures were chilled at 4 °C for 15 min and expression of recombinant proteins was induced by addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cultivation was resumed at 25 °C and 100 rpm for an additional 16 h. For large scale production, 5 liters of Biostat B fermentor (Braun Biotech, Melsungen, Germany) was used, applying the conditions described above. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8 (buffer A), at a ratio of 1 g of wet weight pellet per 10 ml of buffer. Cell lysis was achieved by gently shaking with Lysozyme (30 mg % w/v, Fluka, Neu-Ulm, Germany) in the presence of a 1× Complete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Mixture (cefpi mixture; Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at 4 °C. To accomplish complete cell extraction, the suspension was subjected to two cycles of sonification on ice for 1 min with a Sonoplus Ultrasonic Homogenizer HD 2200 (Bandelin, Berlin, Germany). The lysate was centrifuged twice at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove debris. The His-tagged proteins were purified by chromatography using XK-16/20 columns (Amersham Biosciences) packed with 10 or 25 ml of Ni-NTA Superflow resin (Qiagen). Supernatants were applied to the column pre-equilibrated in buffer A at a flow rate of 0.5 ml·min-1, the columns were washed with 10 volumes of buffer A containing 10 mm imidazole and eluted with a gradient of 0–100% of buffer A containing 0.5 m imidazole at a flow rate of 1 ml·min-1. Ni-NTA fractions containing purified proteins were pooled, concentrated with a Vivaspin 20 PES 50,000 or 100,000 molecular weight cut-off concentrator (Vivascience, Hannover, Germany), dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, by means of a Sephadex G-25 column (Amersham Biosciences), and concentrated again. In case of the NusA-tagged TryS (expressed from pMC8c5), an additional gel filtration chromatography was necessary (15 mg of protein from concentrated Ni-NTA fractions were applied to an Ultrogel AcA 54 (Chipergen, Biosepra Process Division) column of 2.5 × 85 cm; 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2; flow rate 0.75 ml·min-1). Chromatography was performed by means of a BioLogic System (Bio-Rad). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad Protein Assay with bovine serum albumin as standard. The yields of purified proteins from pMC8c5, pMC10c15, and pMC12c1 were 25, 65, and 160 mg per liter of culture medium, respectively. Proteins were sterile-filtered (0.22 μm; Millipore) and stored at 4 °C until use. Loss of activity was not observed over a period of 6 months. Cleavage of N-terminal Tags with Enterokinase or Thrombin—Cleavage of N-terminal His or NusA tags was performed by means of thrombin or enterokinase cleavage capture kits (Novagen), respectively. Routinely, 1 unit of the corresponding proteases was used per 0.1 mg of protein at room temperature (RT) overnight. Proteases were removed according to the protocols of the supplier. Cleavage was confirmed by denaturing SDS-PAGE, matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF), and N-terminal Edman degradation. Determination of Molecular Masses of Heterologously Expressed Cf-TryS—Recombinant proteins prepared as described above were separated in a 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Gels were stained with ruthenium II tris-bathophenanthroline disulfonate and processed for tandem mass spectrometry analysis according to Rabilloud et al. (26Rabilloud T. Strub J.M. Luche S. van Dorsselaer A. Lunardi J. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Molecular weights of recombinant Cf-TryS were estimated from mobilities in a 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel stained with Coomassie Blue (Amersham Biosciences). Accurate molecular masses were obtained by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Brucker GmbH, Bremen, Germany). The identity of the recombinant proteins was further assessed by N-terminal Edman degradation and MALDI-TOF analysis of tryptic digests. Nano-electrospray MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was applied to rule out critical contaminants, if necessary. Site-directed Mutagenesis of Recombinant Cf-TryS—Point mutations of Cf-TryS were generated to replace three different arginine residues (Arg-553, Arg-556, and Arg-613) with Lys, Leu, Gln, or Glu, respectively. For the mutants R613K, R613L, R613Q, R613E, and R553Q a first PCR (35 cycles at 95 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min and 72 °C for 1 min) was performed with Re CfTS B/H and one of the following modified forward primers: Fo TryS R613K, Fo TryS R613L, Fo TryS R613Q, Fo TryS R613E, and Fo TryS R553Q, respectively (Table I). For the second PCR (identical cycling conditions), the fragments obtained from the first PCR were used as reverse megaprimers, and FoCfTryS-SalI was included as forward primer. To generate mutants R553K, R553L, and R553E and R556K, R556L, R556Q, and R556E, forward and reverse megaprimers were first synthesized by means of two separated PCR (same cycling conditions as above), one with FoCfTryS-SalI and Re TryS R553K, Re TryS R553L, Re TryS R553E, Re TryS R556K, Re TryS R556L, Re TryS R556Q, and Re TryS R556E; the other one using Re CfTS B/H and Fo TryS R553K, Fo TryS R553L, Fo TryS R553E, Fo TryS R556K, Fo TryS R556L, Fo TryS R556Q, and Fo TryS R556E, respectively (Table I). These products were used as primers and as templates for a new PCR (cycling conditions as above but at 55 °C annealing temperature) that also contained primers FoCfTryS-SalI and Re CfTS B/H. pMC12c1 was always used as DNA template. All PCRs were performed with Proof Start DNA polymerase (Qiagen). PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose gel and purified using a MinElute Gel extraction kit (Qiagen). Final PCR products were digested with SalI and BamHI and, after renewed purification (QIAquick PCR purification kit from Qiagen), cloned into SalI-BamHI-digested pMC12c1. Ligations were performed with T4-DNA ligase (Roche Applied Science). E. coli Tuner-DE3 cells were transformed with the plasmids by electroporation (E. coli Pulser; Bio-Rad). Correctness of directed mutations was verified by DNA sequencing of the plasmids. Heterologous expression and purification of mutants was performed as described above for the wild-type reCf-TryS. Substrate Specificity of Wild-type or Mutant reCf-TryS—Specificity was investigated by HPLC analysis of products (24Koenig K. Menge U. Kiess M. Wray V. Flohé L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11908-11915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Enzymatic activities of recombinant proteins (1–10 μg of protein for wild-type sequences or 0.05–1 mg of protein for mutant proteins) were incubated at 25 °C in a volume of 0.9 ml containing 50 mm bis-Tris-propane, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm Mg2+-ATP, 2–5 mm GSH, and 1–10 mm spermidine, 1–10 mmN8-acetylspermidine, or 2 mm Gsp, depending on the substrate specificity to be determined. The thiols were reacted with monobrobimane and methansulfonic acid at different time points and stored for 24 h at RT before application to a 92 Nucleosil 300–5C8 HPLC column. Bimane derivatives of thiols were detected fluorometrically as described (24Koenig K. Menge U. Kiess M. Wray V. Flohé L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11908-11915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). GSH, Gsp, and T(SH)2 were used for calibration (a differentiation between N1- and N8-glutathionylspermidine was not achieved). Amidase activity was analyzed accordingly by omitting ATP, MgSO4, and spermidine and adaptation of the concentrations of Gsp and T(SH)2. Steady-state Kinetics Characterization of reCf-TryS—Kinetic studies of the enzymes were carried out by a continuous spectrophotometric assay monitoring NADH consumption at 340nm. Therein, ATP hydrolysis is coupled to oxidation of NADH through pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. Reactions were performed at 25 °C in 100 mm HEPES-K+, pH 7.2, in a final volume of 0.9 ml. Each reaction contained 0.2 mm NADH, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgSO4, 2 units·ml-1 pyruvate kinase (Sigma), 2 units·ml-1 lactate dehydrogenase (Sigma), 250 nm reCf-TryS, and varying amounts of ATP, GSH, and either spermidine or N1-glutathionylspermidine (Bachem AG, Weil am Rhein, Germany). For the GspS activity, the apparent Michaelis constants (Km) and maximum initial velocities (Vmax) values for each substrate were determined at five different substrate concentrations under fixed concentrations of the co-substrates involved (2.5 mm ATP, 1 mm GSH, or 10 mm spermidine). For TryS activity measurements, the concentrations of each substrate were varied between 0.1, 0.15, 0.3, and 5 mm for ATP; 0.18, 0.22, 0.29, 0.42, and 0.75 mm for GSH; and 0.15, 0.18, 0.22, 0.29, and 0.42 mm for N1-glutathionylspermidine. Each of the measurements at the respective combinations of substrates was performed in triplicate. All reactions were preincubated for 10 min at 25 °C and started by the addition of spermidine or N1-glutathionylspermidine. Substrate consumption curves were collected with a UV-mc2 SAFAS spectrophotometer (SAFAS, Monaco) and analyzed with the program Sigma-Plot 8. The set of primary data was used to deduce Km and Vmax values and Dalziel coefficients (27Dalziel K. Biochem. J. 1969; 114: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) as follows. Apparent Km and Vmax values for substrate A were obtained from conventional double-reciprocal plots at five fixed concentrations of B or C, respectively (“primary plots,” see Fig. 5, B and C). The apparent 1/Vmax values for [A] = ∞ were then replotted against the reciprocal concentrations of B or C to yield a new set of apparent Km and Vmax values for infinite concentrations of two substrates (“secondary plots”). Replotting of the ordinate intercepts against the reciprocal third substrate concentration (“tertiary plot”) yields the limiting kinetic constants (see Fig. 5D). If these plots are normalized for enzyme molarity ([E]/v instead of 1/v), the Dalziel coefficients φ can directly be read from slopes or intercepts, as described in detail by Dalziel (27Dalziel K. Biochem. J. 1969; 114: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Limited Proteolysis of Wild-type or Mutant reCf-TryS—Limited proteolysis by trypsin (0.22 units per 100 μg of protein, Sigma) or factor Xa (2 units per 100 μg of protein, Novagen) was carried out in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.2, at RT. At the given times, proteolysis was stopped by adding an equal volume of 2× SDS loading buffer and heating for 5 min at 95 °C. Alternatively, proteolysis was terminated by addition of 1× cefpi mixture (Roche Applied Science), if samples were to be analyzed for enzymatic activities. The extent of proteolysis was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For control, samples were processed identically but without adding factor Xa or trypsin to rule out any effects of potential proteolytic contaminants of the preparations (“mock digestion”). The cleavage sites of trypsin and factor Xa were verified by N-terminal sequencing, MALDI-TOF, and tandem mass spectrometry of fragments. In substrate protection experiments, MgSO4, ATP, GSH, spermidine, and Gsp were added separately or in combination at concentrations of 5, 1, 5, 0.5, and 0.5 mm, respectively, and incubated for 60 min at RT.

https://openalex.org/W2165927567,"Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling is mediated by the cell surface TGF-β type I (ALK5), type II, and the accessory type III receptors endoglin and betaglycan. Hepatic stellate cells (HSC), the most profibrogenic cell type in the liver, express ALK5, TβRII, and betaglycan. To monitor the expression of betaglycan in HSC, we used the commercially available antibody sc-6199 in Western blot analysis. This antibody, raised against a peptide mapping at the carboxyl terminus of the human betaglycan, is claimed to be specific for betaglycan, although it is known that the C-terminal domain is highly conserved in type III receptors. Proteins recognized in HSC by sc-6199 did not match the characteristic migration pattern of betaglycan. Moreover, the determined molecular weight (Mr 160) and the observed reductant sensitivity after treatment with dithiothreitol resemble those of a closely related type III receptor, endoglin (CD105). Endoglin, a disulfide-linked homodimer, is an accessory component of the TGF-β receptor complex and mainly expressed on endothelial cells. The presence of endoglin in HSC of rat liver was confirmed by molecular cloning of the endoglin cDNA and immunocytochemistry. The reactivity of sc-6199 with both auxiliary TGF-β receptors (betaglycan and endoglin) from rats was demonstrated by Western blot and immunocytochemical analysis of cells heterologously expressing these proteins. Furthermore, Northern and Western blotting revealed that both betaglycan and endoglin genes are differentially regulated in HSC and in transdifferentiated myofibroblasts (MFB). By surface labeling and immunoprecipitation experiments, we show that endoglin is found in significant amounts exposed at the plasma membrane of HSC and MFB, which is a pivotal prerequisite for binding of and signaling in response to TGF-β. In conclusion, we hypothesize that TGF-β signals in HSC and MFB are tuned by two different interconnected signaling pathways, as it was previously demonstrated for endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2155722284,"The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) is an integral membrane protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) which functions as a ligand-gated Ca2+ release channel. InsP3-mediated Ca2+ release modulates the cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), providing a ubiquitous intracellular signal with high temporal and spatial specificity. Precise localization of the InsP3R is believed to be important for providing local [Ca2+] regulation and for ensuring efficient functional coupling between Ca2+ release sites by enabling graded recruitment of channels with increasing stimulus strength in the face of the intrinsically unstable regenerative process of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. Highly localized Ca2+ release has been attributed to the ability of the InsP3R channels to cluster and to be localized to discrete areas, suggesting that mechanisms may exist to restrict their movement. Here, we examined the lateral mobility of the type 3 isoform of the InsP3R (InsP3R3) in the ER membrane by performing confocal fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of an InsP3R3 with green fluorescent protein fused to its N terminus. In Chinese hamster ovary and COS-7 cells, the diffusion coefficient D was ∼4 × 10-10 cm2/s at room temperature, a value similar to that determined for other ER-localized integral membrane proteins, with a high fraction (∼75%) of channels mobile. D was modestly increased at 37 °C, and it as well as the mobile fraction were reversibly reduced by ATP depletion. Although disruption of the actin cytoskeleton (latrunculin) was without effect, disruption of microtubules (nocodazole) reduced D by half without affecting the mobile fraction. We conclude that the entire ER is continuous in these cells, with the large majority of InsP3R3 channels free to diffuse throughout it, at rates that are comparable with those measured for other polytopic ER integral membrane proteins. The observed InsP3R3 mobility may be higher than its intrinsic diffusional mobility because of additional ATP- and microtubule-facilitated motility of the channel.

The inositol trisphosphate signaling pathway is present in nearly all cells. Activation of phospholipase C by G protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases results in the hydrolysis of the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to two products, diacylglycerol and the water-soluble inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) 1The abbreviations used are: InsP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; [Ca2+]i, cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; GFP, green fluorescent protein; InsP3R, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: InsP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; [Ca2+]i, cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; GFP, green fluorescent protein; InsP3R, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6164) Google Scholar). InsP3 diffuses in the cytoplasm and binds to a receptor, the InsP3R, a polytopic integral membrane protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), activating it as a Ca2+ channel to liberate stored Ca2+ from the ER lumen into the cytoplasm. This rapid release of Ca2+ modulates the cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), providing a ubiquitous intracellular signal with complex features that endow it with high temporal and spatial specificity (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6164) Google Scholar, 2Berridge M.J. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 315-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The InsP3-mediated [Ca2+]i signaling system regulates a diversity of cellular processes, including gene transcription, membrane transport, secretion, contraction, intercellular communication, and synaptic plasticity (1Berridge M.J.

The InsP3 signaling pathway is expressed ubiquitously, but it nevertheless provides highly spatially and temporally specific [Ca2+]i signals. This has been attributed to the diversity of InsP3R isoform expression (a family of three InsP3R isoforms exists with different primary sequences derived from different genes with alternatively spliced forms (4Taylor C.W.

Importantly, Ca2+ binding to specific sites associated with the channel is necessary for InsP3 to activate it. The requirement for both InsP3 as well as Ca2+ binding enables the channel to function as a coincidence detector, which is believed to be important in determining the fidelity of signaling in physiological processes. Furthermore, the requirement for Ca2+ binding enables the InsP3R to participate in Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release, believed to be the fundamental feature that determines the spatial extent and magnitude of InsP3-induced [Ca2+]i signals (2Berridge M.J.

Such highly localized signals can exist in cells because Ca2+ diffusion is limited by high concentrations of mobile and immobile Ca2+ buffers. Localized [Ca2+]i signals afford the cell the opportunity to regulate physiological processes in discrete environments, with effectors limited to those with appropriate spatial proximity and Ca2+ affinity. It has been proposed that global signals are produced by the temporally and spatially coordinated recruitment of individual localized release events (17Marchant J.S. Parker I. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 18Bootman M. Niggli E. Berridge M. Lipp P. J. Physiol.

Increased stimulus strength recruits more release sites more frequently with enhanced Ca2+ release amplitudes (18Bootman M. Niggli E. Berridge M. Lipp P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 499: 307-314Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 21Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Berridge M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2213-2222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Marchant J. Callamaras N.

Global Ca2+ release manifested as [Ca2+]i waves ensue when the individual release sites become coordinated through the process of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. The ability of localized Ca2+ release events to remain autonomous until cells are maximally stimulated suggests that the spatial separation of Ca2+ release clusters are important to provide stability in the face of the intrinsically unstable regenerative process of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. Furthermore, the activity of one or a few spatially stable active release sites, which are consistently recruited by repetitive stimulation, determines the initiation sites for [Ca2+]i waves as well as the probability that a global wave will be triggered (19Thomas D.

These observations suggest that the spatial organization of Ca2+ signaling molecules is critical in creating the observed diversity of [Ca2+]i signals. The channel permeation and gating properties of the InsP3R are of fundamental importance in generating complex Ca2+ release events, but the subcellular organization of the channels, including their localization and density, have also been invoked to account for the characteristics of [Ca2+]i signals in cells (6Hirose K. Iino M. Nature. 1994; 372: 791-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 29Vermassen E. Parys J.B. Mauger J.P. Biol. Cell. 2004; 96: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 30Delmas P.

In addition to local channel density, other factors have also been proposed to account for spatially restricted [Ca2+]i signals, including the presence of mitochondria (21Bootman M.D. Lipp P.

Science. 1997; 275: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, immunolocalization of InsP3Rs may provide only limited insights because of isoform nonspecificity of antibodies, weakness or cross-reactivity with other proteins of some of the antibodies used, or low level expression of InsP3Rs and the use of fixed cells. Furthermore, whether the entire ER or only specialized regions are involved in Ca2+ sequestration and/or release is debated (37Petersen O.H. Tepikin A. Park M.K. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 271-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 38Golovina V.A. Blaustein M.P. Science. 1997; 275: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Imaging experiments have suggested that the InsP3-sensitive stores are usually continuous (see Ref. 37Petersen O.H. Tepikin A. Park M.K. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 271-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), but the possibility of functionally discrete stores, created perhaps by restricted intraluminal Ca2+ diffusion, or patchy localization of release and/or uptake sites or Ca2+ binding proteins, is possible. Thus, the relationship between the localization of InsP3Rs and [Ca2+]i signaling properties in cells is an important unresolved issue. Here we have examined the localization of the InsP3R in living cells by imaging GFP fluorescence of a GFP-InsP3R fusion protein in which GFP was fused to the N terminus of the rat type 3 InsP3R. This methodology ensures absolute specificity of the signal, enabling unambiguous localization of the channel in living cells. In addition, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments of live cells expressing GFP-InsP3R3. The major questions we addressed are the following. First, is the InsP3R mobile in the ER membrane? We hypothesized that mechanisms involved in localizing InsP3R would constrain its mobility in the ER membrane. What fraction of the InsP3R molecules is immobile? We hypothesized that if the ER was physically discontinuous, a large fraction of the InsP3R channels would appear in FRAP to be immobile. Alternately, channels in clusters or in protein complexes may not be free to diffuse in the ER membrane. Finally, we asked whether the translational mobility of the InsP3R channel changes after disruption of cytoskeletal elements. The InsP3R has been proposed to associate with various cytoskeletal elements, particularly molecules linked to the actin cytoskeleton (39Walker D.S. Ly S. Lockwood K.C. Baylis H.A. Curr.

Our results indicate that the ER is continuous with most of the GFP-InsP3R3 mobile in the ER membrane with a translational diffusion coefficient that, although low, is nevertheless similar to those of other ER-localized polytopic integral membrane proteins of comparable mass. Surprisingly, the relatively low mobility was independent of the actin cytoskeleton, but it was reduced by ATP depletion and disruption of microtubules, suggesting that InsP3R mobility in the ER membrane is facilitated by active processes involving the microtubule cytoskeleton. Cell Culture and Transfection—CHO-K1 (Cricetulus griseus ovary) cells were grown in minimal essential medium without nucleosides (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. COS-7 (Cercopithecus aethiops kidney) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Both cell types were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were plated onto 25-mm diameter round glass coverslips in 60 × 35-mm Petri dishes. 24 h after seeding, the cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions, with 3–5 μg of plasmid DNA of either GFP-KDEL (a gift from Dr. Alan Verkman, University of California, San Francisco) or pEGFP-InsP3R3. The cDNA encoding pEGFP-InsP3R3 was constructed by inserting the rat InsP3R3 sequence into BspEI/XhoI and XhoI/EcoRI sites of the pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech) downstream of EGFP. Three days after transfection, growth medium was replaced with medium containing 250 μg/μl Geneticin (Invitrogen). The medium was then replaced every 2–3 days. Cells were cultured for 1–18 days after transfection. Cell Treatments—Cells on glass coverslips were incubated in a bath solution containing (mm): NaCl (140), KCl (5), MgCl2 (1), CaCl2 (2.5), and HEPES (10) during experiments, unless otherwise noted. Photobleaching measurements were carried out at both room temperature and 37 °C. In some experiments, cells were preincubated with the metabolic inhibitors 2-deoxy-d-glucose (Sigma) (50 mm) and sodium azide (Sigma) (0.02%) (1 h, 37°C, for ATP depletion) or nocodazole (Fluka) (100 μm) or latrunculin B (Biomol) (2 μm) for 15 min on ice, and then returned to 37 °C bath. For recovery of ATP levels, 10 mm glucose was added to the bath solution, and cells were incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Transfected cells were also incubated with ER Tracker Blue-White DPX (Molecular Probes) in growth medium (1 μm, 30 min, 37°C). Western Blotting—CHO and COS-7 cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 48 h after transfection, scraped from culture flasks, and pelleted. The supernatant was removed, and 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 (w/v), 5 mm EDTA) with protease inhibitors (1 mm benzamidine, 10 μm E-64, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Sigma) was added to the pellet. After 2 min of vortexing, the homogenate was centrifuged at top speed for 20 min (4 °C) on a bench-top centrifuge (Eppendorf). The supernatant was removed, and protein concentration was measured so that 50 μg of total protein was separated on a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, analyzed with an InsP3R3-specific antibody (Ab-3; Transduction Laboratories) or a GFP-specific antibody (Chemicon International) and, detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Immunostaining—CHO and COS-7 cells were seeded onto glass coverslips. The next day they were washed with ice-cold PBS and fixed overnight in -20 °C methanol. The cells were washed in ice-cold PBS-TB (0.3% Triton X-100 and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and incubated with an InsP3R3 antibody in 1% bovine serum albumin and PBS (1:100) for 2 h at room temperature. After incubation with the primary antibody the cells were washed in ice-cold PBS-TB and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes) in 1% bovine serum albumin and PBS (1:500). After a final wash in ice-cold PBS-TB, the coverslips were mounted on slides with a drop of Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Inc.). Cells were visualized with a Zeiss Axiovert 100M 63×/numerical aperture 1.2 water immersion lens, and images were collected using LSM510 software. For phalloidin staining, CHO cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, permeabilized in blocking buffer (0.1% saponin, 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature, and then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin (Molecular Probes) diluted to 1 unit/200 μl in blocking buffer for 20 min. The cells were washed three times in PBS and mounted for microscopy in PBS-buffered 50% glycerol. Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching (FRAP)—Photobleaching measurements and images of transfected or stained cells were collected on a Zeiss Axiovert 100M confocal microscope using Zeiss LSM510 software. Cells were visualized with a 63×/numerical aperture 1.2 apochromat water immersion lens. Cells transfected with a GFP fusion protein were illuminated with an argon ion laser (488 nm) (Lasos); ER Tracker Blue-White DPX-stained cells were visualized at 364 nm (Fertigung Gmb H Lasermodule UV). Cells chosen for experiments displayed a wide range of fluorescence intensities, which always demonstrated a reticular pattern of fluorescence. Experiments were carried out at room temperature or at 37 °C. A temperature-controlled chamber was placed around the microscope for experiments performed at 37 °C. A circular region (2–8 μm diameter) in the peripheral part of the cell was photobleached with the 488 nm laser line (25% power, 100% transmission, ∼30 s). The prebleach intensity (average of 10 scans) and recovery of fluorescence were monitored by scanning the whole cell at low laser intensity (25% power, 1% transmission, 0.3–2 s) that minimized further photobleaching. Analysis of FRAP—To generate fluorescence recovery curves and determine the time to half-maximum recovery of fluorescence t1/2, fluorescence intensities were obtained from three locations: the bleach spot circular region;, a region of the same size which was not photobleached (control), on the same cell; and a region off the cell (background). The background intensities were subtracted from the bleach and control intensities, and the results were plotted using the Igor analysis program (Wavemetrics). A first order exponential fit was performed on the bleach curve to determine t1/2. D was calculated by D = r2γ/4t1/2 (46Reits E.A. Neefjes J.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E145-E147Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) where r was the radius of the bleach spot, γ was a correction factor for the amount of bleaching, and t1/2 was obtained from Igor analysis. According to Axelrod et al. (47Axelrod D. Koppel D.E. Schlessinger J. Elson E. Webb W.W. Biophys. J. 1976; 16: 1055-1069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2027) Google Scholar) γ is approximately 1 for our experiments. Monte Carlo simulations of translational diffusion in the ER modeled as a reticulum indicated that the ER geometry had only a small (∼50%) effect on the apparent D calculated assuming two-dimensional diffusion (48Dayel M.J. Hom E.F. Verkman A.S. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2843-2851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 49Olveczky B.P. Verkman A.S. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2722-2730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We have therefore not applied a correction factor to account for ER geometry. The mobile fraction (MF) was calculated using Equation 1, MF=(F∞−F0(C∞/C0)/(Fi(C∞/C0)−F0(C∞/C0))(Eq. 1) where Fi is the fluorescence of the bleach spot before bleaching, F0 is the fluorescence of the bleach spot after bleaching, F∞ is the fluorescence of the bleach spot at infinite time, C0 is the fluorescence of the control spot before bleaching, and C∞ is the fluorescence of the control spot at infinite time. The loss of fluorescence caused by photobleaching from scanning during the duration of the experiment, the fractional bleach by scanning, is C∞/C0; and (Fi - F0) is the loss of fluorescence caused by spot photobleaching. F0 (C∞/C0) is the expected intensity of the bleach spot assuming no recovery, Fi (C∞/C0) is the expected intensity of the bleach spot assuming full recovery. MF > 1 if F∞ > Fi(C∞/C0). Statistics were computed using a two-tailed Student t test. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. GFP was fused to the N terminus of the rat type 3 InsP3R (rGFP-InsP3R3) (Fig. 1A), and the diffusion of the InsP3R in the ER of living cells was determined by confocal imaging of the fusion protein. CHO and COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with either GFP-InsP3R3 or GFP-KDEL, and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) was measured to determine translational diffusion coefficients. GFP-KDEL FRAP provided a measure of small soluble molecule translational diffusional mobility in the ER lumen because the KDEL ER retrieval/retention sequence targets GFP there (48Dayel M.J. Hom E.F. Verkman A.S. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2843-2851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). CHO and COS-7 cells were used because they have been employed in previous studies of ER-localized diffusional mobilities and because InsP3R3 is normally expressed in these cells (50Hattori M.

We recently found that UVB induces phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 or serine 28 through MAP kinases or mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1) (15Zhong S. Zhang Y. Jansen C.

However, much less is known about the UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3, especially the upstream mediators in the signal transduction pathway of UVB irradiation. Modification of histones is an important element in the regulation of gene expression, and histone H3 phosphorylation at serine 10 has traditionally been regarded as a marker for mitosis (17Bradbury E.M. BioEssays. 1992; 14: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 18Gurley L.R. D'Anna J.A. Barham S.S. Deaven L.L. Tobey R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 84: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Increased phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 was found in mitogen-stimulated and oncogene-transformed mouse fibroblasts (19Chadee D.N. Hendzel M.J. Tylipski C.P. Allis C.D. Bazett-Jones D.P. Wright J.A. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24914-24920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10 corresponds with chromatin relaxation and gene expression in interphase, whereas in mitosis it is associated with chromosome condensation (20Prigent C. Dimitrov S. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3677-3685Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Thus to identify the responsible kinases and the circumstances under which histone H3 at serine 10 becomes phosphorylated is important. Fyn kinase is a member of the Src family of nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases and is associated with outgrowth during development and regeneration of the central and peripheral nervous systems (21Maness P.F. Dev. Neurosci. 1992; 14: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 22Bhat N.R. Dev. Neurosci. 1995; 17: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Fyn kinase can interact with numerous other signal molecules, and it has diverse biological functions including signaling via the T cell receptor, regulation of brain function, and adhesion-mediated signaling (23Resh M.D. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 1159-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Recent research indicates that Fyn kinase is expressed in T cells, and it is the first signaling molecule to be activated downstream of the T cell receptor (24Zamoyska R. Basson A. Filby A. Legname G. Lovatt M. Seddon B. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 191: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Fyn kinase is also involved in epidermal growth factor receptor signaling and disrupts the function of the integrin α6β4 at hemidesmosomes and regulates normal keratinocyte migration and squamous carcinoma invasion (25Mariotti A. Kedeshian P.A. Dans M. Curatola A.M. Gagnoux-Palacios L. Giancotti F.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In fact, more and more evidence shows that Src kinase family members interact with MAP kinases in response to various stimuli. For example, activation of MAP kinase by cAMP requires an Src family kinase (SRC, YES, and FYN) that lies downstream of protein kinase A in the murine fibroblast cell line SYF (26Klinger M. Kudlacek O. Seidel M.G. Freissmuth M. Sexl V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32490-32497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species-induced JNKs activation is mediated by Src kinase (27Yoshizumi M. Abe J. Haendeler J. Huang Q. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11706-11712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and reactive oxygen species activate p90 ribosomal S6 kinase via Fyn kinase (28Abe J. Okuda M. Huang Q. Yoshizumi M. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1739-1748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Overall, Src kinases interact widely with serine/threonine kinases when cells are exposed to a variety of stimuli. To explore further the mechanism of UVB-induced carcinogenesis, we used UVB to induce phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10. We found that UVB induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 in a time- and dose-dependent manner and dramatically increased Fyn kinase activity. Fyn kinase inhibitors, PP2 and leflunomide, an Src kinase inhibitor, inhibited UVB-induced Fyn kinase activity and phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 in a dose-dependent manner. Dominant-negative (DNM) Fyn kinase and siRNA Fyn kinase interrupted UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10. DNM-Fyn kinase inhibited UVB-induced ERKs and Akt1 activities and phosphorylation. This study indicates that Fyn kinase plays a key role in UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 through regulation of Akt1 and ERKs. Materials—Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM), l-glutamine, and Lipofectamine™ 2000 reagent were from Invitrogen. Plasmids of pCMV5-wild type-huFyn and pCMV5-huFyn-K299M mutant vector were kindly provided by Dr. Marilyn D. Resh (Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, New York). Antibodies to detect phosphorylation of histone 3 at serine 10 and total histone H3 protein, phosphorylation of ERKs, p38 MAP kinase, and JNKs antibodies and nonphospho-Fyn kinase antibody were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Phospho-Fyn (Thr-12) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was from Gemini Bio-Product (Calabasas, CA). Gentamicin sulfate was from BioWhittaker, Inc. (Walkersville, MD). The Akt kinase assay kit and ERKs kinase assay kit were from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. Polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane was from Millipore (Bedford, MA). The Folin and Ciocalteus phenol reagent and modified Lowry protein assay kit were from Pierce. The sense and antisense oligonucleotides for siRNA of Fyn kinase were synthesized by Sigma. Cell Culture—The JB6 Cl41 mouse epidermal cell line, dominant-negative (DN)-Fyn kinase, and wild type (WT) Fyn stably transfected JB6 cells were cultured as adherent monolayers in MEM supplemented with 5% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS and glutamine (2 mm) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. HaCaT cells were cultured in 10% DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and glutamine (2 mm) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Extraction of Acid-soluble Proteins—After UVB treatment, cells were harvested and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Extraction of the acid-soluble proteins was performed according to the protocol described by Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Briefly, cells were scraped from the plates after treatment and centrifuged at 1000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. Cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and resuspended with 10 volumes of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol), and sulfuric acid was then added to a final concentration of 0.2 n, and extractions were left on ice for 45 min. Extraction solutions were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge, and the acid-insoluble pellets were discarded. Supernatant fractions were transferred to fresh tubes and precipitated on ice for 45 min at a final concentration of 20% trichloroacetic acid. Samples were then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the pellets were washed once with 0.1% acidic acetone and once with pure acetone. Acid-soluble proteins were dissolved in 0.1 n NaOH solution and stored at –20 °C. Protein quantity was determined according to the instructions provided in the modified Lowry protein assay kit. Assay of Phosphorylated H3 at Serine 10—Phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 was detected as described previously (29He Z. Ma W.Y. Liu G. Zhang Y. Bode A.M. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10588-10593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In brief, a specific antibody against phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 or total histone H3 was employed to detect the UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 using a Western blot assay. Membrane-bound proteins were detected with enzyme-catalyzed fluorescence (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed using the Storm 840 Scanner (Amersham Biosciences). Establishing the Stably Transfected DNM-Fyn-JB6 Cells—By using plasmids pCMV5-wild type-huFyn and pCMV5-huFyn-K299M mutant vector, we established these stable transfections according to the protocol from Invitrogen. All of these cells were selected in media containing 500 μg/ml G418 for 2 weeks, and the G418 concentration was then decreased to 250 μg/ml and maintained. G418-selected cells were tested for phosphorylation and activity of Fyn kinase. Akt Kinase Assay—The ability of DNM-Fyn kinase to inhibit the UVB-induced phosphorylation of Akt was tested by using an Akt kinase assay kit (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.). In brief, cells were treated with UVB at various doses for the desired times. Cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS after removing the media, and then 0.5 ml of 1× ice-cold cell lysis buffer plus 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to each plate, and the cells were scraped and transferred to fresh tubes. Cells were sonicated on ice four times for 5 s each and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant fractions were transferred to other fresh tubes. Cell lysate protein (200 μg) and beads (20 μl) with immobilized Akt1 1G1 monoclonal antibody were added together by gently rocking for 3 h at 4 °C. These tubes were centrifuged for 1 min at 4 °C and washed twice with 500 μl of cell lysis buffer and then washed with 500 μl of 1× kinase buffer. The pellets were suspended in 20 μl of 1× kinase buffer supplemented with 200 μm ATP and 2 μg of GSK-3 fusion protein and incubated for 45 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated with 10 μl of 3× SDS sample buffer. The samples were denatured at 95–100 °C for 5 min before they were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes, and Akt1 kinase activity was analyzed by Western blotting using a phospho-GSK-3α/β (serine 21/9) antibody. ERKs MAP Kinase Assay—The ability of DNM-Fyn kinase to inhibit UVB-induced phosphorylation of ERKs was tested using a p44/42 MAP kinase assay kit (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.). The treatment and lysis of cells were performed as described above. Cell lysate protein (200 μg) and immobilized phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase (Thr-202/Tyr-204) antibody beads (20 μl) were added together by gently rocking for 3 h at 4 °C. These tubes were centrifuged and washed twice. The pellets were suspended in 20 μlof1× kinase buffer supplemented with 200 μm ATP and 2 μg Elk-1 fusion protein and incubated for 45 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated with 10 μl of 3× SDS sample buffer. The samples were denatured at 95–100 °C for 5 min before they were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes, and ERK kinases activity was analyzed by Western blotting using a phospho-Elk-1 (serine 383) antibody. Fyn Kinase Assay—UVB-induced activation of Fyn kinase was detected by a 32P-labeled radioactive method. In brief, 200 μg of cell lysate protein were mixed with protein-A/G beads (20 μl) in advance for 1 h at 4 °C. The mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant fraction was added to phospho-Fyn (Thr-12) antibody (20 μl) and gently rocked for 3 h at 4 °C. These tubes were centrifuged and washed twice. The pellets were suspended in 20 μl of 1× kinase buffer supplemented with 10 μl of diluted [γ-32P]ATP solution and 2.5 μl of Src substrate peptide (250 μm) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. A 20-μl aliquot was transferred onto P81 paper and washed tree times with 0.75% phosphoric acid for 5 min per wash and one time with acetone for 2 min. Radioactive incorporation was determined by scintillation counter. The same experiments were repeated three times. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Against Fyn Kinase and Establishing the Stable Expression Cell Line—To study further the role of Fyn kinase in the regulation of phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10, we successfully”knocked down“Fyn kinase expression levels by the siRNA method. The sense oligonucleotide of Fyn kinase used for siRNA was 5′-TTTGCAGCTCGGAAGGAGATTGGTTCAAGAGACAATCTCCTTCCGAGCTGTTT TT-3′, and the antisense is 5′-CTAGAAAAACAGCTC GGAAGGAGATTGGTCTCTTGAACCAATCTCCTTCCGAGCTG-3′. In the sense sequence, the boldface letters indicate a Bbs1 endonuclease site, and italic underlined letters show the RNA loop. In the antisense sequence, the boldface letters show an XbaI endonuclease site. The ligated pair of oligonucleotides was inserted into the mU6pro vector. Annealing, ligation, and colony screening were done as described previously (30Yu J.Y. DeRuiter S.L. Turner D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6047-6052Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide synthesis and sequencing of the inserted sequences in the mU6pro vector were performed by Sigma. The reconstructed plasmid with mU6pro vector contained the siRNA Fyn kinase sequence and is named siRNA-Fyn-mU6pro. The plasmid siR-NA-Fyn-mU6pro and pcDNA3.1 were stably transfected into JB6 Cl41 cells using the Lipofectamine™ 2000 reagent. The transfected cells were selected with G418 as described previously, and Fyn kinase expression level was confirmed by a Western blot assay using an anti-Fyn kinase antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Active Fyn Kinase Phosphorylated Histone H3 at Serine 10 in Vitro— Phosphorylation of pure histone H3 by active Fyn kinase was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). In brief, 8 μg of pure histone H3 was incubated for 1 h at 30 °C with the active Fyn kinase and 200 μm ATP in 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2). The samples were added to 10 μl of 4× SDS sample buffer and separated by 15% SDS-PAGE. The phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 and total histone H3 protein were detected by Western blotting with specific antibodies from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Phosphorylated Fyn Kinase Translocation Assay—HaCaT cells were seeded and cultured in 100-mm dishes for 24 h. Cells were starved in serum-free DMEM for 48 h after cells reached 85–90% confluence. At various times (15, 30, or 60 min) after UVB irradiation (4 kJ/m2), nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins were extracted according to manufacturer's instructions (NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents; Pierce). The protein concentration was determined by the modified Lowry protein assay kit (Pierce). Phosphorylated Fyn kinase was detected by Western blot using a phospho-specific Fyn (Thr-12) antibody. To show that the nuclear proteins did not mix with cytoplasmic proteins, the specific cytoplasmic protein, α-tubulin, was also detected by Western blot using an anti-α-tubulin antibody. Equal protein loading was monitored by the level of β-actin. UVB Induces Phosphorylation of Histone H3 at Serine 10 in a Time- and Dose-dependent Manner—HaCaT keratinocytes were derived from adult human skin, and although spontaneously immortalized, they remain highly related to their normal cell counterparts, and it is an ideal cell line for studying the effects of UVB on human skin (31Gonzales M. Bowden G.T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2721-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 32Mildner M. Eckhart L. Lengauer B. Tschachler E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14146-14152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this study, HaCaT cells were used to analyze the UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10. The time response study indicated that phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 gradually increases from 15 to 30 min following treatment with UVB (4 kJ/m2) (Fig. 1A). The level of total histone H3 protein did not change (Fig. 1B). The dose-response study indicated that phosphorylation of histone H3 gradually increases after treatment with increasing doses of UVB (1, 2, or 4 kJ/m2) (Fig. 1C) with no effect on total histone H3 protein levels (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 is induced by UVB in a dose- and time-dependent manner. UVB Strongly Increases Fyn Kinase Activity and Phosphorylation of Fyn Kinase at Thr-12—Our results also showed that UVB induced Fyn kinase activity in a time-(Fig. 2A) and dose-dependent (Fig. 2B) manner. We found that a 21-fold increase in Fyn kinase activity occurred in UVB-treated cells compared with untreated control cells (Fig. 2A). Fyn kinase activity reached a maximum level when cells were treated with 1 kJ/m2 of UVB, and doses up to 4 kJ/m2 produced a similar induction of activity. Because we already reported that 4 kJ/m2 of UVB distinctly induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 or serine 10 in JB6 cells (15Zhong S. Zhang Y. Jansen C. Goto H. Inagaki M. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12932-12937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 16Zhong S.P. Ma W.Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20980-20984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), a dose of 4 kJ/m2 of UVB was used to further study the stress function of UVB. UVB induced phosphorylation of Fyn kinase (Thr-12) also in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3, A and C), and non-phospho-Fyn kinase was unchanged (Fig. 3, B and D).Fig. 3UVB-induced phosphorylation of Fyn kinase in a time- and dose-dependent manner. HaCaT cells were treated with UVB (4 kJ/m2) and harvested after 5, 15, 30, or 60 min. Cells were lysed, and the phosphorylation of Fyn kinase was analyzed by using a Western blot assay with a specific phospho-Fyn kinase (Thr-12) antibody (A). HaCaT cells were harvested 30 min after treatment with the indicated dose of UVB, and phosphorylation of Fyn kinase at Thr-12 was detected by Western blot assay as described previously (C). The level of total Fyn kinase protein was detected by Western blot using a nonphospho-Fyn kinase antibody (B and D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fyn Kinase Inhibitors Greatly Suppress UVB-induced Phosphorylation of Histone H3 at Serine 10—The above data indicate that UVB induces phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 and simultaneously induces Fyn kinase activity. Therefore, we hypothesized that Fyn kinase would play a key role in the UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10, and H3 phosphorylation would be changed by inhibition of Fyn kinase. In this study, we found that PP2, a Fyn kinase inhibitor (33Paitel E. Fahraeus R. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10061-10066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and leflunomide, an Src kinase inhibitor (34Xu X. Williams J.W. Bremer E.G. Finnegan A. Chong A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12398-12403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), markedly inhibited the UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4, A and C, respectively) but did not change the total histone H3 protein level (Fig. 4, B and D). This result not only confirms our hypothesis but also indicates that Fyn kinase plays an important role in UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10. Fyn Kinase Inhibitors Suppress Fyn Kinase Activity and Phosphorylation—Because Fyn kinase inhibitors markedly suppressed UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10, we determined whether these inhibitors can affect Fyn kinase activity and phosphorylation under the same conditions. We found that either PP2 or lefunomide decisively inhibited UVB-induced Fyn kinase activity (Fig. 5A) and phosphorylation (Fig. 5B) in a dose-dependent manner. Dominant-negative (DNM) Mutant Fyn Kinase Inhibits UVB-induced Phosphorylation of Histone H3 at Serine 10—To explore further the role of Fyn kinase in UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10, we used DNM-Fyn and WT-Fyn plasmids to establish stably expressed DNM-Fyn and WT-Fyn transfected JB6 cells. Our data show that phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 induced by UVB was obviously inhibited in DNM-Fyn-transfected cells (Fig. 6C), but the total histone H3 protein level did not change (Fig. 6D). Meanwhile, DNM-Fyn also distinctly inhibited UVB-induced phosphorylation of Fyn kinase (Fig. 6A), but the total Fyn kinase protein level was also unchanged (Fig. 6B). These results indicate that Fyn kinase plays a very important role in mediating the phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 induced by UVB. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Fyn Kinase Inhibits UVB-induced Phosphorylation of Histone H3 at Serine 10—We also used the siRNA method to knock down the Fyn kinase expression level, and we then determined the effects on UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10. First, we confirmed the efficiency of siRNA for knocking down Fyn kinase level using Western blotting and an anti-Fyn antibody. Our results indicated that the Fyn kinase protein level decreased to 5% of that observed in control cells (Fig. 7A). β-Actin protein level was used to monitor equal protein loading in each well (Fig. 7B). These results indicate that the siRNA-Fyn kinase works well in vivo. Further results indicated that UVB increased phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 in the “mock” mU6pro vector plus pcDNA3.1 vector-transfected cells but not in the siRNA-Fyn (mU6pro plus pcDNA3.1 vector) stably transfected cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7, C and E). Total histone H3 levels were unchanged (Fig. 7, D and F). DNM Fyn Kinase Inhibits UVB-induced Phosphorylation of Akt (Serine 473) and ERKs (Thr-203/Tyr-204)—Fyn kinase is involved in UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10; however, the signal transduction components mediated by Fyn kinase leading to that phosphorylation are unknown. We hypothesized that Fyn kinase is located upstream of the known UVB-stimulated signal transduction pathway, and Fyn kinase can regulate several downstream kinases, which are then translocated into the nucleus where they phosphorylate histone H3 in vivo. We assessed the status of several MAP kinases and Akt phosphorylation in WT-Fyn cells and DNM-Fyn cells. We found that UVB only stimulated ERKs (Thr-202/Tyr-204) and Akt (serine 473) phosphorylation (Fig. 8"
https://openalex.org/W2075040473,"Pollen from cedar and cypress trees is a major cause of seasonal hypersensitivity in humans in several regions of the Northern Hemisphere. We report the first crystal structure of a cedar allergen, Jun a 1, from the pollen of the mountain cedar Juniperus ashei (Cupressaceae). The core of the structure consists primarily of a parallel β-helix, which is nearly identical to that found in the pectin/pectate lyases from several plant pathogenic microorganisms. Four IgE epitopes mapped to the surface of the protein are accessible to the solvent. The conserved vWiDH sequence is covered by the first 30 residues of the N terminus. The potential reactive arginine, analogous to the pectin/pectate lyase reaction site, is accessible to the solvent, but the substrate binding groove is blocked by a histidine-aspartate salt bridge, a glutamine, and an α-helix, all of which are unique to Jun a 1. These observations suggest that steric hindrance in Jun a 1 precludes enzyme activity. The overall results suggest that it is the structure of Jun a 1 that makes it a potent allergen.

Common allergic reactions, including allergic rhinitis and asthma, are initiated when protein or glycoprotein allergens cross-link specific IgE antibody molecules on the surface of mast cells or basophils. However, our understanding of the structural basis of this process is incomplete. For instance, the structures of the receptors that anchor the IgE molecules to cells and the signaling process that ensues after cross-linking are known in some detail. On the other hand, our understanding of the structural requirements for proteins to function as allergens is very limited. It is well known that not all proteins are naturally allergenic, and those that are allergenic belong to a relatively small number of protein families. This suggests that certain structural features or biochemical activities are required for proteins to promote an allergenic response. We have performed studies of the extremely allergenic glycoproteins from the pollen of the mountain cedar tree, Juniperus ashei, a major cause of seasonal hypersensitivity in the central United States (1Schwietz L.A. Goetz D.W. Whisman B.A. Reid M.J. Ann. Allergy Asthma Immunol. 2000; 84: 87-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The propensity for cedar allergens to induce IgE antibody responses and mediate allergic reactions is indicated by the finding that approximately half of those who suffer from mountain cedar pollinosis do not have reactions to any other allergens. The pollen of related species are responsible for severe, seasonal allergic diseases in Japan (Cryptomeria japonica (2Sato K. Nakazawa T. Sahashi N. Kochibe N. Ann.

One of the unresolved questions in immunology is whether the propensity of allergens to induce pathological responses is due to their unique structural features or biochemical activities. Resolving the three-dimensional structures of the cedar allergens and defining their relationship with their biochemical activity and binding to IgE antibodies to form a pathogenic complex on the surface of cells should advance our understanding of the allergic process. In 1999, we isolated and characterized a major mountain cedar allergen, Jun a 1 1The abbreviations used are: Jun a 1, major allergen from pollen of mountain cedar Juniperus ashei; PB, parallel β-helical sheet; Pel, pectate lyase; BsPel, Pnl, pectin lyase.

This high percentage of sequence identity implies that the group 1 cedar allergens have similar tertiary structures that may be responsible for their allergenicity and the extensive cross-reactivities between the cedar pollen allergens. Jun a 1 has less extensive sequence identity (20–50%) with the Pel and Pnl of microorganisms. The Pels and Pnls depolymerize the cell walls of plants in the presence of Ca2+ ions in a process classically called “maceration” (9Barras F. Vangijsegem F. Chatterjee A.K. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1994; 32: 201-234Crossref Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 10Collmer A. Keen N.T. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1986; 24: 383-409Crossref Google Scholar). These enzymes injure or destroy fruits by cleaving the α-1,4 glycosidic bond of pectate and pectin, the major components of plant cell walls (11Pilnik W. Rombouts F.M. Birch G.G. Blakebrough N. Parker K.J. Enzymes and Food Processing. Applied Science Publishers Ltd., London1981: 105-128Google Scholar). However, Pnl and Pel are also produced by higher plants where they are thought to promote germination by pollen grains and the ripening (softening) of fruits (12Carpita N. McCann M. Buchanan B.B.

Despite the relatively low degree of overall sequence identity between the microbial and plant Pel, the residue sequences vWiDH and RXPXXR (uppercase letters indicate identity residues between enzymes, the v and i indicate conserved residues, and X represents any residue) are highly conserved (14Midoro-Horiuti T.

None of the crystal structures of the Pnl and Pel have unequivocally identified the vWiDH and RXPXXR sequences as being the active sites of the lyases. Scavetta et al. (20Scavetta R.D. Herron S.R.

All except the first arginine in the RXPXXR sequence (Arg218) had normal values. The crystal structure of the Pel C indicated that the Arg218 was oriented in such a manner to suggest a catalytic role. Scavetta et al. (20Scavetta R.D. Herron S.R. Hotchkiss A.T. Kita N. Keen N.T.

When this mutant Pel C was complexed with a galacturonopentaose oligosaccharide substrate, the crystal structure showed that the substrate bound in a cleft encompassing the RXPXXR sequence as well as the postulated Ca2+ binding sites (21Yoder M.D. Keen N.T. Jurnak F. Science. 1993; 260: 1503-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The relationship between the three-dimensional structures of the group 1 cedar pollen allergens and the microbial Pnl and Pel has not been established, because none of the tertiary structures of the cedar pollen allergens had been determined. Our homology modeling studies have suggested that their tertiary structures may be similar (22Midoro-Horiuti T. Mathura V. Schein C.H. Braun W. Yu S. Watanabe M. Lee J.C. Brooks E.G. Goldblum R.M. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 40: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, our pectolytic assays of Jun a 1 and the Jun a 1 homologue from the Japanese cedar pollen, Cry j 1, indicate that there are functional differences. We have not been able to demonstrate pectolytic activity in Jun a 1, and the pectolytic activity of Cry j 1 was very low relative to the Pels from microbial sources. 2E. Czerwinski, T. Midoro-Horuti, M. White, E. Brooks, and R. Goldblum, unpublished observations. As part of our efforts to explain these observations, we initiated a structural investigation. We recently reported the crystallization of the Jun a 1 allergen (23Liu D. Midoro-Horiuti T. White M.A. Brooks E.G. Goldblum R.M. Czerwinski E.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1052-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We report here the three-dimensional crystal structure of Jun a 1, the first for a cedar pollen allergen and the first putative plant Pel to be determined. Analysis of the crystal structure revealed that the predominate conformation of Jun a 1 is fundamentally identical to that of the microbial Pnl and Pel. The lack of Pel or Pnl activity of purified Jun a 1 provides an opportunity to investigate the structural requirements for the activity of these enzymes. Furthermore, this is the first report of the structure of a protein isolated from a non-microbial source that contains the parallel β-helical motif. Crystallization and Native Data Collection—The Jun a 1 allergen was isolated from mountain cedar pollen (J. ashei) collected in north-western Bexar County, Texas. The allergen was purified using concanavalin A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) chromatography as described previously (7Midoro-Horiuti T. Goldblum R.M. Kurosky A. Goetz D.W. Brooks E.G. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1999; 104: 608-612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A preliminary description of the crystallization and preliminary x-ray diffraction data has been published elsewhere (23Liu D. Midoro-Horiuti T. White M.A. Brooks E.G. Goldblum R.M. Czerwinski E.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1052-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In summary, crystals were obtained after 6–7 weeks at 277 K from solutions containing sodium acetate, ammonium acetate, and 23% polyethylene glycol 4000, pH 5.5. The crystals are monoclinic (space group P21) with four molecules in the unit cell (Table I). All native and heavy atom derivative data were collected from crystals cryoprotected with glycerol and rapidly cooled to 100 K in liquid nitrogen for storage and data collection. A 2.5-Å resolution native data set and heavy atom derivative data sets were collected on a MAC-Science DIP 2030 Image Plate or a Bruker SMART2K charge-coupled device using copper Kα x-rays produced by MacScience M06HF rotating anode generators equipped with Bruker Göbel optics. Image processing and data reduction were performed using DENZO and SCALEPACK from the HKL package (24Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38702) Google Scholar). A 1.7-Å resolution native data set was collected at the Advanced Photon Source 14-BM-C beamline, λ = 0.9 Å.

Data to 2.5-Å resolution from the PtCl42- and UO2(NO2)2 derivatives were collected as described above for the native 2.5-Å resolution data. The three 2.5-Å resolution data sets were used to solve the structure using the multiple isomorphous replacement procedure in the program SOLVE (25Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). Four PtCl42- sites and four UO22+ sites were found with a figure of merit of 0.45. Solvent flattening and non-crystallographic symmetry averaging in RESOLVE (25Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar) increased the figure of merit to 0.66. Phase Improvement and Refinement—The initial Fourier map showed clearly the two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Many of the side chains were readily identifiable. The preponderance of β-structure was clearly visible, thereby establishing the directionality of the coils. However, the connectivity was not evident, and only about one-third of the residues of the two molecules could be built into the model. The high resolution synchrotron data was not isomorphous with the low resolution data. The phases obtained from the 2.5-Å data were extended to 1.7 Å using the SOLVE/RESOLVE programs after rigid body, positional, and B-factor refinements of the 2.5-Å model were made using the program CNS (26Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16991) Google Scholar). This was followed by several cycles of REFMAC (27No Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19825) Google Scholar)/RESOLVE refinement and automated model building with the figure of merit at each stage being 0.33, 0.59, and 0.74, respectively. A nearly complete model of the Jun a 1 structure was built using XTALVIEW (28McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). Several cycles of molecular dynamics refinement with simulated annealing using the program CNS were performed and interspersed with model building using XTALVIEW. Further refinement was performed using SHELXL (29Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Carter J. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology: Macromoecular Crystallography, Part B. 277. Academic Press, San Diego1997: 319-343Google Scholar) interspersed with model building. The refinement converged at a final R of 0.193 and an Rfree of 0.242 for all data. The final structure consists of 692 amino acid residues in two molecules with 701 water molecules. The refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. Model Quality—The amino acid geometries, as determined using PROCHECK (30Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4507) Google Scholar), are normal in each molecule in the asymmetric unit with three exceptions. In each molecule there are two cis-proline residues (224 and 231). One tyrosine residue (235) has φΨ angles (∼67,-48) that place the residue in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot (30Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4507) Google Scholar). The electron density corresponding to the Pro224, Pro231, and Tyr235 residues is unequivocal in each molecule in the asymmetric unit. All figures were drawn using PyMOL. 3www.pymol.org. Solvent accessibility calculations were performed using WhatIF (31Rodriguez R. Chinea G. Lopez N. Pons T. Vriend G. Comput. Appl.

Overall Structure—Jun a 1 crystallized in the P21 space group with two molecules of Jun a 1 in the asymmetric unit. The structures of both molecules were refined independently and are virtually identical. The root mean square deviation between 311 (90%) of the Cα atoms of the two molecules is 0.2 Å, whereas 35 residues grouped in the various loops have a root mean square deviation of >1.6 Å. The results and discussion which follow apply equally to both molecules, unless stated otherwise. Jun a 1 is a single chain polypeptide. The right-handed parallel β-helix is the predominant structural motif (Fig. 1). The parallel β-helix conformation of the Jun a 1 is very similar to those of the Pel and Pnl, for which crystal structures have been published and whose coordinates are available from the Protein Data Bank (16Mayans O.

Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). The three parallel β-sheets, PB1 (Fig. 2, green), PB2 (red), and PB3 (yellow), are separated by turns, i.e. sequences of residues in random coil conformations of variable lengths. Secondary structural elements are identified as described by Yoder et al. (15Yoder M.D. Lietzke S.E. Jurnak F. Structure. 1993; 1: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Turn T1, usually two residues long, connects PB1 with PB2. T2 (connects PB2 to PB3) and T3 (connects PB3 to PB1 of the next coil) are variable in length. The coils are numbered from the N-terminal end of the parallel β-helix (Fig. 1). The Jun a 1 β-helix is shaped much like the two sheet β-helix but with a short β-strand instead of random coils connecting the two β-sheets (36Brèandāen C-I. Tooze J. Introduction to Protein Structure. 2nd Ed. Garland Publishing, New York1999: 84-86Google Scholar), giving the cross-sectional shape of the β-helical core the appearance of an isosceles triangle with PB1 anti-parallel to PB3. PB1, T1, and PB2 are regular in length. The average φΨ angles of the first, (54° and 33°) and second (-91° and 156°) residues in T1 are similar to that of the Pel and Pnl. The result is that the PB2 sheet is pointed in a direction nearly perpendicular to the PB1 sheet. T2 and T3 are less regular in length and planarity and contain all but one of the intra-coil loops. Furthermore, the φΨ angles in PB3 vary widely from coil to coil. Loops—There are five loops of various types (ζ and Ω) (37Ring C.S. Kneller D.G. Langridge R. Cohen F.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 685-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), motifs, and lengths extending from the β-helical core. Except for the N- and C-terminal loops, the loops invariably begin and end within T2 (Fig. 1). The Thr44-Ala67 loop is an exception, as it begins on coil 1 and ends on coil 2. The closeness of the Cα to Cα distances indicates that the loops do not alter the spatial continuity of the β-helical core. One loop (Thr44-Ala67) traverses the N-terminal, and one (Ala270-Val279) covers the C-terminal end of the β-helix. These loops preclude the end-to-end binding of other Jun a 1 molecules to the β-helix in the manner described by Richardson and Richardson (38Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2754-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Salt Bridges—There are 10 salt bridges in each of the two molecules of Jun a 1 (Fig. 1). Most of these salt bridges are between residues in the parallel β-helix coils and residues in the various loops. Two of the salt bridges are unique to Jun a 1. The salt bridge between Asp5 in the N-terminal helix-turnhelix loop and His165 on T1.5 of the β-helix aids in holding the N-terminal helix-turn-helix loop in place and shields the vWiDH sequence, which is always present in the Pnl and Pel and proposed to be an enzymatically active site (20Scavetta R.D. Herron S.R. Hotchkiss A.T. Kita N. Keen N.T. Benen J.A. Kester H.C. Visser J. Jurnak F. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1081-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), from the solvent (Table II). In addition, the salt bridge between Asp177 and His203 traverses the presumed substrate binding groove in the vicinity of the putative active site Arg229.Table IISolvent accessibilities (Å2) of the vWiDH sequence side chains of Jun a 1 and the pectate lyasesPDB identifierTypeAla, Ile, or ValTrpIle or ValAspHis1PXZJun a 1aSource organism, Juniperus ashei0.170.000.5200.171BN8BsPelbSource organism, Bacillus subtilis05.5900.425.271IDKPnl AcSource organism, Aspergillus niger02.7800.674.331JTAPel AdSource organism, Erwinia chrysanthemi03.490.870.173.291QCXPnl BcSource organism, Aspergillus niger03.480.170.9812.531AIRPel CdSource organism, Erwinia chrysanthemi014.8500.630.871PCLPel EdSource organism, Erwinia chrysanthemi,e1PCL Pel E structure is Cα only13.9813.8014.6811.718.04a Source organism, Juniperus asheib Source organism, Bacillus subtilisc Source organism, Aspergillus nigerd Source organism, Erwinia chrysanthemie 1PCL Pel E structure is Cα only Open table in a new tab Stacks—The Pnl and Pel structures are also characterized by their unique stacks of asparagine, aliphatic, and aromatic residues in the interior of the β-helical core. Similar stacks are found in Juna1inthe same relative locations in the interior of the β-helical core (Fig. 1). The aromatic stack of Jun a 1 has a tyrosine in the middle; however, the non-polar character of the interior is maintained by a hydrogen bond between the Oη of Tyr245 and the oxygen of Met230 (Fig. 3). The significance of this unique interaction for any potential Pel and Pnl activity of Jun a 1 is discussed below. The asparagine and aliphatic stacks are very similar to those found in the Pel and Pnl. However, there are two serines (Ser263 and Ser298) on the C-terminal end of the aliphatic stack with their side chains inside the β-helical core. These two serines interact with the asparagine stack, which is formed by the asparagine usually present as the second residue of T1.4 through T1.10. The second residue in T1 is invariably an Asn, which forms a stack in the interior of the β-helix. The one exception is Asp301 of T1.10, which forms a hydrogen bond with the Oγ of Ser298. This arrangement, along with the hydrogen bond between Asn266 and the Ser263 Oγ, maintains the hydrophobic character of the interior of the β-helical core. Cysteine—The Jun a 1 structure differs from those of the Pnl and Pel structures in the number and placement of the cysteine residues. Jun a 1 has three disulfide bonds and a free sulfhydryl group, whereas the microbial Pels and Pnls have only one or two disulfide bonds in locations different from those in Jun a 1. Furthermore, the Pels and Pnls do not have a free sulfhydryl. cis-Proline—There are two cis-prolines in the Jun a 1 structure, Pro224 and Pro231. The cis-Pro224 residue is in the same locale as the cis-Pro231 but does not seem to have any unusual interactions as a result of the cis configuration. On the other hand, cis-Pro231 is invariant in the Pnl and Pel. This residue positions the carbonyl oxygen of Met230 to form a hydrogen bond wit"
https://openalex.org/W2157196485,"Production of insoluble elastin, the major component of elastic fibers, can be modulated by numerous intrinsic and exogenous factors. Because patients with hemolytic disorders characterized with fluctuations in iron concentration demonstrate defective elastic fibers, we speculated that iron might also modulate elastogenesis. In the present report we demonstrate that treatment of cultured human skin fibroblasts with low concentration of iron 2–20 μm (ferric ammonium citrate) induced a significant increase in the synthesis of tropoelastin and deposition of insoluble elastin. Northern blot and real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed that treatment with 20 μm iron led to an increase of ∼3-fold in elastin mRNA levels. Because treatment with an intracellular iron chelator, desferrioxamine, caused a significant decrease in elastin mRNA level and consequent inhibition of elastin deposition, we conclude that iron facilitates elastin gene expression. Our experimental evidence also demonstrates the existence of an opposite effect, in which higher, but not cytotoxic concentrations of iron (100–400 μm) induced the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species that coincided with a significant decrease in elastin message stability and the disappearance of iron-dependent stimulatory effect on elastogenesis. This stimulatory elastogenic effect was reversed, however, in cultures simultaneously treated with high iron concentration (200 μm) and the intracellular hydroxyl radical scavenger, dimethylthiourea. Thus, presented data, for the first time, demonstrate the existence of two opposite iron-dependent mechanisms that may affect the steady state of elastin message. We speculate that extreme fluctuations in intracellular iron levels result in impaired elastic fiber production as observed in hemolytic diseases. Production of insoluble elastin, the major component of elastic fibers, can be modulated by numerous intrinsic and exogenous factors.

We speculate that extreme fluctuations in intracellular iron levels result in impaired elastic fiber production as observed in hemolytic diseases. Mature elastic fibers and laminae provide extensibility and elastic recoil to vascular walls and ligaments and form a connective tissue framework of lungs, elastic cartilage, and skin (1Uitto J.

Elastic fiber formation (elastogenesis) is a complex process involving several intracellular and extracellular events. Cells (fibroblasts, endothelial cells, chondroblasts, or vascular smooth muscle cells) must first synthesize and secrete numerous glycoproteins to form a microfibrillar scaffold upon which tropoelastin, the precursor peptides, are properly assembled and covalently cross-linked by lysyl oxidase into a resilient polymer, insoluble elastin (7Christiano A.M.

Production of elastin reaches its highest levels in the third trimester of the fetal life and steadily decreases during early postnatal development (11Parks W.C. Secrist H. Wu L.C. Mecham R.P. J.

There are also several other post-transcriptional events, which control secretion of tropoelastin monomers and their proper extracellular assembly (20Hinek A. Wrenn D.S. Mecham R.P. Barondes S.H. Science. 1988; 239: 1539-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 21Hinek A. Rabinovitch M. J.

Laurneier I. Collins M.J. Br. J. Dermatol. 2003; 149: 951-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In addition to primary elastinopathies that have been directly linked to alterations in the elastin gene (supravalvular aortic stenosis, Williams-Beuren syndrome, and cutis laxa (22Davidson J.M.

Diffuse elastic fiber defects, resembling those reported in inherited pseudoxanthoma elasticum, have also been detected in patients with β-thalassaemia and sickle cell anemia (30Aessopos A. Farmakis D. Loukopoulos D. Blood. 2002; 99: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and in other hemolytic anemias (31McLane N.J. Grizzard W.S. Kousseff B.G. Hartmann R.C. Sever R.J. Am.

The genetic basis for these diseases cannot be directly linked to any structural or regulatory components involved in elastic fiber production (30Aessopos A. Farmakis D. Loukopoulos D. Blood. 2002; 99: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 33Cianciulli P. Sorrentino F. Maffei L. Amadori S. Cappabianca E. Foglietta E. Carnevali E. Pasquali-Ronchetti I. Eur. J. Clin.

Hematol. 2003; 122: 852-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, it has been suggested that the accumulation of iron in these patients, resulting from hemolysis, increased iron absorption, and multiple blood transfusions may lead to acquired elastic tissue defects (30Aessopos A. Farmakis D. Loukopoulos D. Blood. 2002; 99: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Iron is a physiologically essential nutritional element for all life forms (35Fraga C.G. Oteiza P.I. Toxicology. 2002; 180: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). It plays critical roles in electron transport and cellular respiration, oxygen transport by hemoglobin, cell proliferation, and differentiation (36Boldt D.H. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1999; 318: 207-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that modulating intracellular iron levels may also affect expression of numerous genes that are not directly involved in iron metabolism, such as protein kinase C-β, an important component of intracellular signaling pathways (37Alcantara O. Obeid L. Hannun Y. Ponka P. Boldt D.H. Blood. 1994; 84: 3510-3517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or those encoding extracellular matrix (ECM) 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; ROS, reactive oxygen species; DFO, desferrioxamine; DRB, dichlorobenzimidazole riboside; DMTU, dimethylthiourea; FAC, ferric ammonium citrate; CM-H2DCFDA, 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester; LIP, labile iron pool; NF-1, nuclear factor-1. 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; ROS, reactive oxygen species; DFO, desferrioxamine; DRB, dichlorobenzimidazole riboside; DMTU, dimethylthiourea; FAC, ferric ammonium citrate; CM-H2DCFDA, 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester; LIP, labile iron pool; NF-1, nuclear factor-1. components (36Boldt D.H.

It has been demonstrated that dietary iron overload in rats resulted in an increase in the steady-state level of pro-α2(I)-collagen in hepatocytes (39Pietrangelo A. Rocchi E. Schiaffonati L. Ventura E. Cairo G. Hepatology. 1990; 11: 798-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and that 50 μm iron treatment stimulated collagen gene expression in cultured stromal hepatic cells by inducing the synthesis and binding of Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors to two regulatory elements located in the collagen α1 (I) promoter region (40Ruiz I.G. De Torre LaP. Diaz T. Esteban E. Morrilas J.D. Munoz-Yague T. Solis-Herruzo J.A. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). On the other hand, iron loading in cultured cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts decreased the expression of transforming growth factor-β, biglycan, and collagen type I mRNA, whereas it facilitated the expression of decorin mRNA. Interestingly, iron deprivation exerted a similar effect, suggesting that the expression of these genes involved in extracellular matrix production is regulated by certain iron-dependent mechanisms (41Parkes J.G. Liu Y. Sirna J.B. Templeton D.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2000; 32: 233-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The molecular basis of iron-dependent mechanism(s) regulating the expression of ECM-encoding genes is not well understood. Because raising levels of iron may overwhelm the iron binding capacity of transferrin, resulting in the appearance of non-transferrin bound iron (42Hershko T.E. Konijn A.M. Link G. Br. J. Hematol. 1998; 101: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), which is capable of catalyzing the formation of the hydroxyl radicals (through the Fenton and Haber-Weiss reactions) (43Pietrangelo A. J. Hepatol. 2000; 32: 862-864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that iron-dependent induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) may modulate the transcription of these genes (36Boldt D.H. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1999; 318: 207-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Brenneisen P. Wenk J. Klotz O. Wlaschek M. Briviba K. Krieg T. Scharffetter-Kochanek.Sies H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5279-5287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The possibility of iron-dependent oxidative damage to elastic fibers has also been suggested, but not proven (30Aessopos A. Farmakis D. Loukopoulos D. Blood. 2002; 99: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The present study was designed to elucidate the mechanisms by which iron might modulate elastogenesis. We utilized normal human skin fibroblasts that are capable of elastic fiber production in vitro to explore whether changes in concentrations of iron would affect elastin gene expression and the subsequent deposition of elastic fibers. We also tested the influence of different iron concentrations on generation of intracellular ROS, and attempted to identify on which level these iron-induced ROS affect elastogenesis. Materials—All chemical-grade reagents, catalase, desferrioxamine (DFO), dichlorobenzimidazole riboside (DRB), dimethylthiourea (DMTU), ferric ammonium citrate (FAC), superoxide dismutase, and tempol were all obtained from Sigma, and Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.2% trypsine-0.02% EDTA, and other cell culture products from Invitrogen. We obtained 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate and acetyl ester (CM-H2DCFDA) from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Polyclonal antibody to tropoelastin was purchased from Elastin Products (Owensville, MI). Secondary antibody fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit was purchased from Sigma. DNeasy Tissue system for DNA assay and RNeasy Mini Kit for isolation of total RNA were purchased from Qiagen (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). A OneStep RT-PCR kit was purchased from Qiagen. A SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR was purchased from Invitrogen. TaqMan Universal PCR master mix, TaqMan GAPDH control, and Assays-on-Demand Gene Expression probe for elastin were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). The radiolabeled reagents, [3H]valine and [3H]thymidine, and Rediprime (II) Random Primer labeling system were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Hybridization solution Miracle Hyb was purchased from Stratagene (Cedar Creek, TX), and the human GAPDH control was purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Cultures of Normal Human Skin Fibroblasts—Fibroblasts grown from skin biopsy explants of six normal subjects, aged from 2 months to 10 years, were obtained from the cell repository at The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto with the permission of the Institutional Ethics Committee. Fibroblasts were routinely passaged by trypsinization and maintained in Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium supplemented with 1% antibiotics/antimycotics, and 10% FBS. In all described experiments passages 2–6 were used. In experiments aimed at assessing ECM production, fibroblasts were initially plated (100,000 cells/dish) and maintained in normal medium until confluency at which point they produce abundant ECM. Confluent cultures were then treated for 72 h with or without FAC producing iron concentrations from 2 to 200 μm. The low iron concentration (2 and 20 μm) of iron utilized in the present study remained in the range that did not induce any disturbances in cellular metabolism when tested by other investigators (45Breuer W. Epsztein S. Cabantchik I. FEBS Lett. 1997; 382: 304-308Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The high iron concentration (200 μm) was comparable to concentrations used in studies of iron overload (41Parkes J.G. Liu Y. Sirna J.B. Templeton D.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2000; 32: 233-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 46Traore H.N. Meyer D. Met. Cell Sci. 2002; 23: 175-184Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In some experiments the membrane permeable ferric iron chelator, DFO, was added 30 min prior to FAC treatment. For the experiments conducted in the presence of various antioxidants, the antioxidants were applied 1 h prior to FAC treatment. For experiments conducted in serum-free conditions, 7-day-old confluent fibroblast cultures were starved for 12 h in serum-free medium and incubated with various concentrations of iron (as FAC) for additional 72 h in serum-free medium. Immunostaining—At the end of the incubation period confluent cultures were fixed in cold 100% methanol at -20 °C for 30 min and blocked with 1% normal goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. Cultures were then incubated for 1 h with 10 μg/ml polyclonal antibody to tropoelastin followed by a 1-h incubation with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit. Nuclei were counterstained with propidium iodide. Secondary antibody alone was used as a control. All of the cultures were then mounted in ELVANOL, and examined with an Nikon Eclipse E1000 microscope attached to a cooled charge-coupled device camera (QImaging, Retiga EX) and a computer-generated video analysis system (Image-Pro Plus software, Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Quantitative Assays of Tropoelastin and Insoluble Elastin—Normal human skin fibroblasts were grown to confluency in 35-mm culture dishes (100,000 cells/dish) in quadruplicates. Then, 2 μCi of [3H]valine/ml of fresh media was added to each dish, along with or without 2, 20, 100, and 200 μm FAC. Cultures were incubated for 72 h, and the soluble and insoluble elastin was assessed separately in each dish. The cells were extensively washed with PBS, and the soluble proteins present in the intracellular compartments were extracted overnight at 4 °C with 0.1 m acetic acid in the presence of proteinase inhibitors. After centrifugation, the supernatants were pre-cleaned by 30-min incubation with 50 μl of 4% protein A-beaded agarose, then 500 μl of the supernatant was incubated with 5 μg of polyclonal antibody to tropoelastin for 2 h and subsequently with 50 μl of 4% protein A-beaded agarose for 3 h at 4 °C. The protein A-containing beads were sedimented by centrifugation, washed with immunoprecipitation buffer, mixed with scintillation fluid, and counted (21Hinek A. Rabinovitch M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The remaining cultures containing cell remnants and deposited insoluble extracellular matrix were scraped and boiled in 500 μl of 0.1 n NaOH for 45 min to solubilize all matrix components except elastin. The resulting pellets containing the insoluble elastin were then solubilized by boiling in 200 μl of 5.7 n HCl for 1 h, and the aliquots were mixed in scintillation fluid and counted (21Hinek A. Rabinovitch M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Aliquots taken from each culture were also used for DNA determination according to Ref. 47Rodems S.M. Clark C.L. Spector D.H. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2697-2704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, using the DNeasy Tissue System from Qiagen. Final results reflecting amounts of metabolically labeled insoluble elastin in individual cultures were normalized per their DNA content and expressed as cpm/μg of DNA. In separate experiments, the specified treatment described in the figure legends was added along with 2 μCi of [3H]valine/ml media to confluent cultures of normal human skin fibroblasts in 35-mm culture dishes (100,000 cells/dish) in quadruplicates for 72 h. The conditioned media was then removed, the cell layers were washed, and incorporation of [3H]valine into the insoluble elastin was assessed as described above. Assessment of Cell Proliferation—Normal human skin fibroblasts were suspended in Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium containing 10% FBS and plated in 35-mm culture dishes (100,000 cells/dish) in quadruplicates. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were transferred to the serum-free medium for synchronization of their cell cycle and then maintained in the presence or absence of FAC (2–200 μm) and 2 μCi of [3H]thymidine/ml in media with 10% FBS for 72 h. These cultures were then washed in PBS and treated with cold 5% trichloroacetic acid twice for 10 min at 4 °C. One-half milliliter of 0.3 n NaOH was added to all dishes, incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and 200-μl aliquots of each culture mixed with scintillation fluid were counted. Assays of Intracellular ROS Levels—The ROS-sensitive fluorescent probe, CM-H2DCFDA has been used to detect oxidative activity in cultured fibroblasts (48Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). This probe passively diffuses into the cell interior, and only upon oxidation is a fluorescent product released that can be visualized under fluorescent microscope or captured by flow cytophotometry, when it is excited at 480 nm. To measure intracellular ROS production, normal human skin fibroblasts were plated on glass coverslips in 35-mm dishes (50,000 cells/dish) and grown to confluency. The cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with or without 10 μm CM-H2DCFDA for 30 min in fresh media. The cells were then washed again in PBS and incubated with new media in the presence or absence of FAC (2–400 μm) for three additional hours. The cells were then washed twice with PBS before being mounted to the glass slides, and the images were captured using a fluorescence microscope under identical parameters of contrast and brightness. In addition, the quantification of this reaction was performed by flow cytometry (λ excitation, 480 nm; λ emission, 520 nm). Quadruplicate cultures of fibroblasts were preincubated with CM-H2DCFDA and maintained in the presence or absence of FAC as described above. To reduce stress-induced oxidant activation, the cells were cooled and harvested by trypsinization at 4 °C. They were then collected by centrifugation (4 °C, 1000 rpm for 3 min), washed in cold PBS, and fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min in the dark and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences). Northern Blots—Normal human skin fibroblasts were grown to confluency in 100-mm culture dishes. Fresh media was added along with or without 2, 20, and 200 μm of FAC for 24 h. Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini Kit according to manufacturer's instructions, and 10 μg were resolved by electrophoresis on formaldehyde-1% agarose gels. Recovery of 18 S and 28 S rRNA was analyzed using ethidium-bromide staining and image analysis on a Gel Doc 1000 optical-system (Bio-Rad). RNA was transferred onto Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by capillary transfer in 10× SSC and immobilized by UV cross-linking. Human elastin cDNA recombinant probe H-11 (49Olson T.M.

The membrane was washed to high stringency, and the bound radioactivity was visualized by autoradiography and quantified by scanning densitometry (Gel Doc 1000). RNA loading and transfer were evaluated by probing with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA probe to which relative elastin mRNA values were normalized. Quantitative TaqMan RT-PCR—To confirm the expression level of elastin mRNA in the presence of 2, 20, and 200 μm FAC obtained by Northern blot analysis, we also conducted quantitative RT-PCR. To assess the effect of iron on elastin mRNA stability, parallel quadruplicate cultures were grown to confluency in 100-mm dishes. Media were then changed, supplemented with 60 μm transcription blocker, DRB (51Zhang M-C. Giro M.G. Quaglino D. Davidson J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 986-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and cultures were maintained in the presence or absence of 20 and 200 μm FAC for 0, 6, 12, and 24 h. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit, according to manufacturer's instructions, at indicated time points. The reverse transcriptase reaction was performed using 1.5 μg of total RNA, oligo(dT)s, and the SuperScript First-Strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Elastin mRNA levels were measured by real-time quantitative PCR method performed on the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). For each treatment two distinct amplifications were carried out in parallel to amplify elastin cDNA and GAPDH cDNA. The amplification reactions were performed in 25-μl volumes containing 30 ng of cDNA per treatment in triplicate, 12.5 μlof 2× TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), and 1.25 μl of 20x Assays-on-Demand Gene Expression probe for elastin (Applied Biosystems) or TaqMan GAPDH probe (Applied Biosystems). Elastin mRNA levels from each treatment were normalized to the corresponding amount of GAPDH mRNA levels. Water controls and samples without PCR mixtures were set up to eliminate the possibility of significant DNA contamination. Final results were expressed as the mean of two independent experiments. One-step RT-PCR—To further confirm the effect of iron on elastin mRNA levels, confluent normal human skin fibroblast cultures were treated with or without intracellular ferric iron chelator, 20 μm DFO in the presence or absence of 20 μm FAC for 24 h. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions, and 1 μg of total RNA was added to each one-step RT-PCR (Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR kit), and reactions were set up according to the manufacturer's instructions in a total volume of 25 μl. The reverse transcription step was performed for elastin and β-actin reactions at 50 °C for 30 min followed by 15 min at 95 °C. The elastin PCR reaction (sense primer: 5′-GGTGCGGTGGTTCCTCAGCCTGG-3′, antisense primer: 5′-GGGCCTTGAGATACCCCAGTG-3′; designed to produce a 255-bp product) was performed under the following conditions: 25 cycles at 94 °C denaturation for 20 s, 63 °C annealing for 20 s, and 72 °C extension for 1 min, then 1 cycle at 72 °C with a final extension for 10 min. The β-actin PCR reaction (sense primer: 5′-GGTCAGAAGGATTCCCTATGTG-3′; antisense primer: 5′-ATTGCCCAATGGTGATGACCTG-3′; designed to produce a 615-bp product) was performed under the following conditions: 25 cycles at 94 °C denaturation for 60 s, 60 °C annealing for 60 s, and 72 °C extension for 120 s, the 1 cycle at 72 °C with a final extension for"
https://openalex.org/W2008331711,"dCTP deaminase (EC 3.5.4.13) catalyzes the deamination of dCTP forming dUTP that via dUTPase is the main pathway providing substrate for thymidylate synthase in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. dCTP deaminase is unique among nucleoside and nucleotide deaminases as it functions without aid from a catalytic metal ion that facilitates preparation of a water molecule for nucleophilic attack on the substrate. Two active site amino acid residues, Arg115 and Glu138, were identified by mutational analysis as important for activity in E. coli dCTP deaminase. None of the mutant enzymes R115A, E138A, or E138Q had any detectable activity but circular dichroism spectra for all mutant enzymes were similar to wild type suggesting that the overall structure was not changed. The crystal structures of wild-type E. coli dCTP deaminase and the E138A mutant enzyme have been determined in complex with dUTP and Mg2+, and the mutant enzyme also with the substrate dCTP and Mg2+. The enzyme is a third member of the family of the structurally related trimeric dUTPases and the bifunctional dCTP deaminase-dUTPase from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii. However, the C-terminal fold is completely different from dUTPases resulting in an active site built from residues from two of the trimer subunits, and not from three subunits as in dUTPases. The nucleotides are well defined as well as Mg2+ that is tridentately coordinated to the nucleotide phosphate chains. We suggest a catalytic mechanism for the dCTP deaminase and identify structural differences to dUTPases that prevent hydrolysis of the dCTP triphosphate. dCTP deaminase (EC 3.5.4.13) catalyzes the deamination of dCTP forming dUTP that via dUTPase is the main pathway providing substrate for thymidylate synthase in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. dCTP deaminase is unique among nucleoside and nucleotide deaminases as it functions without aid from a catalytic metal ion that facilitates preparation of a water molecule for nucleophilic attack on the substrate.

The main source of dUMP, the precursor for dTTP in the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, is obtained via a pathway where dCTP is deaminated by dCTP deaminase (EC 3.5.4.13) to yield ammonia and dUTP that subsequently is hydrolyzed by dUTPase to generate dUMP and pyrophosphate (1Neuhard J. Nygaard P. Neidhart F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaecter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. Cellular and Molecular Biology. Vol. 1: Purines and Pyrimidines. ASM, Washington, D. C.1987: 445-473Google Scholar). In contrast, Gram-positive bacteria and eukaryotic organisms synthesize dTTP from dUMP obtained by deamination of dCMP by the zinc-containing enzyme dCMP deaminase (2Weiner K.X. Weiner R.S. Maley F. Maley G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12983-12989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a bifunctional enzyme from the archaeon Methanocaldococcus jannaschii has been identified (3Li H. Xu H. Graham D.E. White R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11100-11106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 4Bjornberg O. Neuhard J. Nyman P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20667-20672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) that possesses both the dCTP deaminase and dUTPase activities in one polypeptide suggesting that at least in some Archaea, dCTP serves as a source for dUMP. The structure of this archaeal enzyme is now known and the subunit shares an overall fold with dUTPases as well as the organization of subunits in a trimer (5Johansson E. Bjornberg O. Nyman P.O. Larsen S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27916-27922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the present work we demonstrate that dCTP deaminase from E. coli is yet another member of this family of enzymes, even though significant differences are found in the C-terminal stretch that closes the active site upon catalysis. One very interesting feature of the dCTP deaminase is that the deamination reaction proceeds without aid from a metal cofactor. Other nucleobase or nucleoside deaminases such as cytosine deaminase (6Porter D.J. Austin E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24005-24011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ko T.P. Lin J.J.

Short S.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4168-4174Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), adenosine deaminase, (9Cooper B.F. Sideraki V. Wilson D.K. Dominguez D.Y. Clark S.W. Quiocho F.A. Rudolph F.B. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1031-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and adenine deaminase (10Nygaard P. Duckert P. Saxild H.H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 846-853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) all require a catalytic metal ion, Zn2+,Mn2+,Fe2+, which is either tightly bound in the active site or has to be added together with the substrate to the enzyme. Here, we report the identification of catalytically important amino acid residues of E. coli dCTP deaminase. Furthermore we present the first structure of a monofunctional dCTP deaminase in a distinct complex with the reaction product dUTP and Mg2+ (dUTP·Mg2+) and also the structures of a mutant enzyme (E138A) in complex with bound substrate dCTP and Mg2+ (dCTP·Mg2+) as well as the same mutant enzyme in complex with dUTP·Mg2+. The structures of these complexes of enzyme and nucleotides allow us to suggest a plausible mechanism for the deamination reaction in the absence of a metal cofactor, involving conserved amino acid residues. Finally, also based on these new structures of dCTP deaminase and the previously determined structures of dUTPase and the bifunctional dCTP deaminase-dUTPase we identify amino acid residues that determine the bi- or monofunctionality of dCTP deaminases with respect to dUTPase activity. Construction of an Overexpression Vector for the E. coli dcd Gene and Mutant Alleles—Manipulation of DNA and the preparation and transformation of CaCl2 competent E. coli cells was performed using standard procedures (11Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The dcd (12Wang L. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5647-5653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) gene was obtained by PCR using the Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) according to the suppliers manual with chromosomal DNA from a E. coli K12 strain as a template and the deoxy-oligonucleotides; DCD-5: GAAAATCATATGCGTCTGTGTGACCG and DCD-3: GCGGATCCTTAGTCTTTATCGATTCGGC. Lettering in italics indicate the restriction sites incorporated by the primers in the PCR product; NdeI in DCD-5 and BamHI in DCD-3. The PCR product, comprising the reading frame of the dcd gene, and plasmid pET11a (Novagen) were digested with the restriction enzymes NdeI and BamHI, ligated, and the ligation mix was subsequently transformed into BL21(DE3) cells. This yielded a strain, SØ5352, harboring the plasmid pETDCD that allows for overexpression of the dcd gene upon induction with IPTG. Mutant alleles of the dcd gene encoding the R115A, E138A, and E138Q enzymes were constructed using the QuikChange method (Stratagene) with pET11DCD as the template and the complementary deoxyoligonucleotides 5R115A, TCCTCACTGGCGGCTCTGGGGCTGATG; 3R115A, CATCAGCCCCAGAGCCGCCAGTGAGGA; 5E138A, TGCATTGTGCTGGCGTTCTACAACTCC; 3E138A, GGAGTTGTAGAACGCCAGCACAATGCA; 5E138Q, TGCATTGTGCTGCAGTTCTACAACTCC and 3E138Q, GGAGTTGTAGAACTGCAGCACAATGCA. The entire coding region for wild-type and mutant alleles of the dcd gene were verified by sequencing using an ABI PRISM 310 DNA Sequencer as recommended by the supplier (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Purification of E. coli Wild Type and Mutant dCTP Deaminases—An overnight culture of BL21(DE3) derivatives harboring a plasmid encoding either wild type (SØ5352) or mutant dCTP deaminases constructed as described above were grown in LB medium at 37 °C supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg ml-1). These overnight cultures were then used to inoculate 300 ml of the same media as above, and growth was continued at 37 °C to an OD600 of 1 when IPTG 1The abbreviations used are: IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside; NCS, non-crystallographic symmetry; CD, circular dichroism. was added to a final concentration of 0.3 mm. After three hours of induction the cells were harvested by centrifugation in a Sorvall centrifuge in SLA3000 rotor at 5000 rpm for 8 min. All subsequent steps were conducted at 4 °C. The cell paste was suspended in 20 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, and centrifugation was repeated as above. Subsequently, the cell paste was suspended in 5 ml of the same buffer, and the cells were disrupted using a Sonics Vibra-Cell ultrasonic processor. Cell debris was sedimented by centrifugation in a Sorvall centrifuge using an SS34 rotor at 14,000 rpm for 20 min. A freshly prepared 10% (w/w) streptomycin sulfate solution was added to the extract to a final concentration of 1% (w/w). The precipitate was cleared by centrifugation as above, and the supernatant was dialyzed against several changes of washing buffer. The dialyzed protein was loaded on to a DEAE 52 column (38 ml) equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, which was mounted on a Gradifrac (Amersham Biosciences). The column was eluted with a gradient from 0 to 0.4 m KCl in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8 of a total of 240 ml. The protein eluted at ∼0.1 m KCl and fractions containing dCTP deaminase were diluted 3-fold with 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, and a second run of the DEAE 52 column as above was performed. The fractions eluted from the column were pooled and made 60% saturated (40 g/100 ml) with ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was recovered by centrifugation as above and dissolved in 5 ml of 50 mm Hepes, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 6.8 and dialyzed against several changes of the same buffer. This protocol yielded 10–15 mg of dCTP deaminase that migrated as a single protein band in SDS-PAGE (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) of ∼20 kDa corresponding to the dCTP deaminase monomer with a purity of more than 95%. For crystallization the enzyme was stored at 4 °C whereas for enzymological studies it was stored in aliquots of 100 μl at -20 °C where the enzyme was stable for several months. All mutant enzymes were purified and stored by the same procedure as above. Enzyme concentration was determined using a calculated ϵ280 = 22,190 cm-1 m-1 giving an A280 (0.1%) of 1.044. Preparation of Selenomethionine-substituted E138A dCTP Deaminase—Selenomethionine substituted E138A enzyme was produced from BL21(DE3) harboring the plasmid encoding this mutant enzyme by regulation of the normal methionine biosynthesis as described by Van Duyne et al. (14Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). Shortly, 2.5 ml of an overnight culture grown in M9 minimal medium with the addition of 0.4% (w/v) glucose and 100 μg/ml ampicillin was used to inoculate 200 ml of the same medium, and growth was continued at 37 °C. At an OD600 of 0.4, 6 ml of a sterile filtered aqueous solution of 20 mg d,l-selenomethionine, 20 mg l-lysine, 20 mg l-threonine, 20 mg l-phenylalanine, 10 mg l-leucine, 10 mg l-valine, and 10 mg l-proline was added. After 15 min, IPTG to a final concentration of 0.5 mm was added. After three hours of induction cells were harvested, and the selenomethionine-substituted E138A enzyme was purified as described above. Enzyme Kinetics and Recording of CD Spectra—Assays were conducted at 37 °C in 50 mm Hepes, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 6.8 by measuring the decrease in absorbance from the deamination of dCTP to dUTP at 284 nm (for dCTP concentrations in the range of 0–0.2 mm) or 291 nm (for dCTP concentrations exceeding 0.2 mm) with the extinction coefficients of Δϵ284 = 3,800 cm-1 m-1 or Δϵ291 = 1,340 cm-1 m-1, respectively. For dCTP concentrations above 1 mm cuvettes with a light path of 2 mm was used. The concentration of dCTP and potassium phosphate varied as described under “Results and Discussion.” Magnesium chloride was added in an excess of 2 mm above dCTP concentration. CD spectra of wild-type and mutant dCTP deaminases were recorded at 25 °C as 5 overlaid scans on a Jasco J-810 instrument with a light path of 2 mm. The samples contained ∼0.1 mg ml-1 of protein in 50 mm potassium phosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 6.8. The analysis of initial velocity data were performed using Equation 1 for cooperative substrate binding, v=V[S] n/(S0.5n+[S] n)(Eq. 1) where v is the initial velocity, V is the maximal velocity, S represents substrate, S0.5 is the concentration of S for half-maximal velocity and n is the Hill-coefficient. Crystallization—Solubility screening (15Stura E.A. Nemerow G.R. Wilson I.A. J. Crystallogr. Growth. 1992; 122: 273-285Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and crystal screen I from Hampton Research (16Jancarik J. Kim S.H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 409-411Crossref Scopus (2076) Google Scholar) were used for initial crystallization screening using the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique. Small, irregular crystals of the E138A inactive mutant enzyme cocrystallized with dCTP and Mg2+ were obtained in both polyethylene glycol and salt conditions in the solubility screen and large crystals with sharp edges appeared in crystal screen I condition 23 (30% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 400, 0.2 m magnesium chloride, 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.5). The crystals used for structure determinations were grown at room temperature with a hanging drop of 2 μl of 5–8 mg/ml enzyme, 5 mm nucleotide (dCTP or dUTP, respectively), and 20 mm magnesium chloride in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5 mixed with 2 μl of mother liquor (28–30% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 400, 0.2 m magnesium chloride, 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.5) equilibrated over 1 ml of mother liquor. The crystals grew to a size of 0.2 × 0.1 × 0.05 mm in 4 days. Diffraction Data Collection—Diffraction data for the E138A crystals in complex with dCTP·Mg2+ and wild-type crystals in complex with dUTP·Mg2+ were collected under cryogenic conditions (100 K) at beamline I711, MAX-lab, Lund University, Sweden (17Cerenius Y. Stahl K. Svensson L.A. Ursby T. Oskarsson A. Albertsson J. Liljas A. J. Synchrotron Rad. 2000; 7: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) on a MAR Research CCD detector. A copper rotating anode from Rigaku (RU300) operating at 46 kV/70 mA equipped with a MAR345 image plate was used for diffraction data collection on cryocooled (120 K) crystals of E138A in complex with dUTP·Mg2+. The mother liquor was used as cryoprotectant for all three crystals. Auto indexing, data reduction, and scaling were performed with programs from the HKL suite (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The crystals of E138A in complex with dCTP·Mg2+ and wild-type enzyme in complex with dUTP·Mg2+ belong to space group P21, with six protein chains in the asymmetric unit having a Matthews coefficient of 2.18 Å3/Da, corresponding to ∼44% solvent content. The crystals of E138A in complex with dUTP·Mg2+ belong to space group C2, also with six protein chains in the asymmetric unit (Matthews coefficient 2.10 Å3/Da, solvent content ∼41%). This crystal was nonmerohedrally twinned which made auto indexing of the data nontrivial and as consequence the quality of the data was not as good as for the other two data sets reported here. Structure Determination and Refinement—The three-dimensional structure of E. coli dCTP deaminase in complex with dCTP·Mg2+ was determined by a combination of molecular replacement and single wavelength anomalous dispersion methods. First, molecular replacement as implemented in AMoRe (19Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar) was applied using a trimmed polyalanine trimer of the bifunctional dCTP deaminase-dUTPase from M. jannaschii (Protein Data Bank code 1OGH; chain A, residues 1–45 and 86–164) as search model. Diffraction data in the 15–4.5 Å range from a crystal of E138A mutant enzyme not including selenomethionine protein were used (data not shown), and all translational searches were performed using the centered correlation function (20Navaza J. Vernoslova E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1995; 51: 445-449Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A solution with high contrast of the correlation coefficient and R-value placed two trimers in the asymmetric unit. Introduction of correct amino acid side chains, refinement using REFMAC5 (21Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar), and rounds of prime and switch in RESOLVE (22Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2003; 59: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) utilizing the 6-fold NCS of the crystal did not improve the electron density maps significantly and large parts (∼35%) were missing. An anomalous difference electron density map with phases from the present model and diffraction data from the selenomethionine substituted protein revealed the positions of 24 selenium sites, four for each protein chain. The selenium sites were refined with SHARP (23Bricogne G. Vonrhein C. Flensburg C. Schiltz M. Paciorek W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2003; 59: 2023-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar), DM (24Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar) was subsequently used for density modification and 166 of the 193 amino acids in one of the six protein chains could be automatically traced by ARP-wARP (25Lamzin V.S. Perrakis A. Wilson K.S. Rossman M.G. Arnols E. International Tables for Crystallography. Vol. F: Crystallography of Biological Macromolecules. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Netherlands2001: 720-722Google Scholar). The remaining residues were manually built using O (26Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) and the five other protein chains were generated by NCS. After one cycle of positional refinement with REFMAC5 (21Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar), dCTP, and a magnesium ion could be introduced in each of the active sites. Cycles of refinement with REFMAC5 using NCS restrains, manual rebuilding in O and water picking with ARP-wARP were performed. The structure of the wild-type enzyme in complex with dUTP·Mg2+ was determined using the first model, free from water molecules as well as dCTP and Mg2+, as starting point since the crystals both belonged to the same crystal form. After rigid body refinement allowing the six protein chains in the asymmetric unit to move separately, clear electron density was seen for dUTP, Mg2+, and the side chain of residue Glu138 and these were model built in O. Further rounds of refinement in REFMAC5, rebuilding in O and water picking using ARP-wARP were performed. Despite electron density maps of high quality, the Rfree value did not reach below 28%. Closer examination of the cumulative intensity distribution of the diffraction data suggested presence of merohedral twinning. Therefore a twinning operator ((h,k,l) → (h,k,-h,-l)) was introduced and refinement was recaptured using SHELXL (27Sheldrick G.M. SHELXL97. University of Göttingen, Germany1997Google Scholar) resulting in considerably improved refinement statistics. The crystals of E138A in complex with dUTP crystallized in another space group (C2), and the structure was determined using the trimer of the wild-type product complex free from ligands as search model resulting in one clear molecular replacement solution with the program AMoRe (19Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar). Rigid body refinement, addition of dUTP, Mg2+, and water, as well as positional refinement with REFMAC5 and model building was performed similarly to the wild-type structure in complex with dUTP·Mg2+. Details from structure refinement are found in Table I. The quality of the models was checked with PROCHECK (28Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl.

Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). However, during our studies of the enzyme from E. coli we discovered that this cooperativity was caused by the presence of phosphate in the assay buffer. Omission of phosphate in the assay incubations gave nearly hyperbolic saturation curves for dCTP binding to E. coli dCTP deaminase (Fig. 1). From Fig. 1A it can be seen that the inhibition by inorganic phosphate of the dCTP deaminase activity does not affect the maximal velocity of the enzyme, but only has an effect on the half-saturation with dCTP (S0.5) and the cooperativity of dCTP binding. Apparently, phosphate is a competitive inhibitor of dCTP binding but at the same time phosphate induces an increase in cooperativity of dCTP binding. Fig. 1B shows a linear correlation between increasing fixed concentrations of phosphate present in the incubation and a resulting increase in S0.5 for dCTP, as well as concomitant increases in the Hill coefficient for dCTP binding. The specific mechanism by which phosphate acts on dCTP deaminase is not yet understood. Analysis of Mutant dCTP Deaminases—None of the mutant dCTP deaminases prepared displayed any detectable activity (less than 1000-fold the wild-type activity) indicating that both side chains Arg115 and Glu138 are obligatory for the deamination reaction. As it will be discussed below an important function in catalysis of both residues can be deduced from the structure of the enzyme. Glu138 corresponds to Glu145 in the bifunctional Archaean enzyme for which it was also shown that the E145Q enzyme had lost the deaminase activity (3Li H. Xu H. Graham D.E. White R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11100-11106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The structural integrity of the mutant enzymes was verified by comparing the CD spectra of wild-type and mutant enzymes. The CD spectra of wild-type enzyme and the R115A and E138A enzymes were virtually superimposable (data not shown). Crystal Structure Determination—The structure of the mutant enzyme E138A in complex with dCTP·Mg2+ was determined by a combination of molecular replacement, using the bifunctional dCTP deaminase-dUTPase from M. jannaschii as search model, and single wavelength anomalous dispersion using selenomethionine-substituted enzyme. The experimental phases obtained from the single wavelength anomalous dispersion experiment gave a high quality electron density map sufficient for automatic model building of a large part of the final model. The structure of the wild-type enzyme in complex with dUTP·Mg2+ was determined by difference Fourier methods, and the structure of the mutant enzyme E138A in complex with dUTP·Mg2+ was determined using the molecular replacement method. The statistics of the diffraction data, and the refinement for the three structures are summarized in Table I. The subunit of E. coli dCTP deaminase is composed of 193 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 21.2 kDa. The asymmetric unit in the crystals contains six subunits (chains A–F) that form two independent homotrimers (chains A–C and D–E, respectively), and has clear electron density for all amino acid residues. The Cα atoms of the subunits may be superimposed with root mean square deviation values ranging from 0.128 Å (chains A and F, E138A·dCTP·Mg2+) to 0.296 Å (chains A and C, E138A·dCTP·Mg2+) using default parameters in the program O (26Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). In the Ramachandran plots there are no non-glycine residues in disfavored regions except for residues Asn20 and Pro21, which form a cis-peptide bond. In the three structures, every active site (three per trimer) binds a well defined dCTP·Mg2+ or dUTP·Mg2+ complex. Overall Fold—The dCTP deaminase subunit is composed of 14 β-strands (β1–14), three α-helices (α1–3), and four 310-helices (γ1–4) (Fig. 2A). The β-strands form three antiparallel β-sheets: S1 (β1, β8, β12, and β10), S2 (β2, β3, β14, β9, and β11), and S3 (β4 and β6), and one mixed β-sheet, S4 (β5 and β13 from one subunit of the homotrimer and β7 from another subunit), illustrated with different shades of blue in Fig. 2A. S2 pack on top of S1 and in this manner a distorted β-barrel is created. The subunits assemble, forming a compact homotrimer related by a 3-fold rotational NCS with one nucleotide-Mg2+ complex bound between pairs of subunits, resulting in three active sites per trimer as illustrated in Fig. 2B. The homotrimer has an equilateral (∼55 Å long side) triangular face perpendicular to the 3-fold axis. The height along the 3-fold axis is ∼45 Å.

To study the roles of these isoforms in bone regeneration, we applied an adenoviral vector carrying their genes to transduce primary osteoprogenitor cells in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of the two isoforms induced rapid and marked osteoblast differentiation, with Til-1 being more effective in vitro, by examination of the alkaline phosphatase activity, calcium content, and Alizarin red staining. Til-1 overexpressing cells/porous ceramic composites were transplanted into subcutaneous and bone defect sites in Fischer rats (cultured bone transplantation model) and markedly affected in vivo bone formation and osteoblast markers. The results demonstrated that the reconstitution of bone tissues, such as cortical bone and trabecular bone was accelerated by implantation of Til-1 overexpressing cells/porous ceramic composites. Moreover, the new bone formation by Til-1 overexpression appeared to reflect replacement of new bone within the implant boundaries. To ascertain whether implanted Cbfa1 overexpressing cells could differentiate into osteogenic cells to create bone or whether it stimulated the surrounding recipient tissue to regenerate bone, implanted male donor cells were visualized by fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis. The proportion of implanted cells in the presumptive bone forming region was over 80% and did not change throughout from 3 days to 8 weeks after implantation. These findings suggested that the newly formed bone in the porous area of the scaffold is mostly produced by the implanted donor cells or their derived cells, effectively by Til-1 overexpression.

In addition to the study of Cbfa1 function in osteoblasts by the analysis of Cbfa1 knock-out mice, the effect of Cbfa1 overexpression in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and preosteoblasts has attracted much attention not only from basic biologists but also from clinicians. Because transplantation of genetically engineered non-osteogenic cells with Cbfa1 overexpression into bone defects is expected to be a powerful tool in bone tissue engineering with gene therapy for repair of large bone defects. As a means of bone regeneration, a technique for the transplantation of cultured bone (8Caplan A.I. J. Orthop. Res. 1991; 9: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (3369) Google Scholar, 9Caplan A.I.

A representative model of cultured bone transplantation was reviewed by Ohgushi et al. (11Ohgushi H. Caplan A.I. J. Biomed. Mater.

Briefly, rat bone marrow-derived osteoprogenitor cells and porous ceramic composite were cultured in vitro with osteogenic supplements: dexamethasone, β-glycerophosphate, and ascorbic acid. This was followed by a subcutaneous transplantation resulting in new bone forming porous internal areas in vivo. Before this system can be applied clinically, however, several tasks need to be performed, such as elucidation of the mechanism of in vivo bone formation, improvement of ceramic scaffolds, and the advancement of culture techniques of MSC-derived cells. Above all, it is necessary to shorten the culture period for MSCs in vitro because long-term culture causes MSC-derived cells to cease their lineage progression or to become cancerous. One approach to accelerating the process of differentiation involves the use of gene therapy in which viral or non-viral vectors are utilized to overexpress osteogenic factors for transplantation. Non-viral vectors are comparatively easy to make, however, they are usually less efficient as delivery vehicles. They also lack the ability to target specific cell types and tissues (18Wu N. Ataai M.M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2000; 11: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Among them, adenovirus is a relatively safe vector compared with human immunodeficiency virus-based vectors including retroviral vectors. The rate of infection with adenovirus is also known to be almost 100% for adherent cells, such as osteoblasts. Osteogenic cytokines like bone morphgenetic protein (19Cheng S.L. Lou J. Wright N.M.

Cbfa1 is a key osteogenic transcription factor and was found to be indispensable for osteoblast differentiation. Some reports have been published regarding the effect of Cbfa1 overexpression on differentiation of an osteoblast cell line (28Byers B.A. Pavlath G.K. Murphy T.J. Karsenty G. Garcia A.J. J.

Res. 2003; 18: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), however, several basic research studies using primary cells in vitro and in vivo are needed before its clinical application. First of all, there exist two major N-terminal isoforms of Cbfa1, Pebp2αA (starting with the sequence MRIPV) (30Ogawa E. Maruyama M. Kagoshima H. Inuzuka M. Liu J. Satake M. Shigesada K. Ito Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6859-6863Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar) and Til-1 (starting with the sequence MASNS) (31Stewart M. Terry A. Hu M. O'Hara M. Blyth K. Baxter E.

Benerjee et al. (33Banerjee C. Javed A. Choi J.Y. Green J. Rosen V. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4026-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) reported a clear difference between the two N-terminal isoforms, Pebp2αA and Til-1, in response to bone morphgenetic protein-2 during development of the osteoblast phenotype. Previous reports regarding the effects of Cbfa1 overexpression on osteoblast differentiation focused only on Pebp2αA, however, no examination of the difference between the two N-terminal isoforms has been performed. We hypothesized that overexpression of the Cbfa1 gene promotes the rapid differentiation of osteoblasts in vitro and in vivo and have explored the use of adenoviral vectors carrying the two Cbfa1 isoforms (Pebp2αA and Til-1, as shown in Fig. 1A) to transduce MSC-derived osteoprogenitor cells. Results suggested that the adenoviral vector induced the transfer of the Cbfa1 gene, markedly stimulating the differentiation of osteoblasts in vitro. Til-1 proved to be more effective than Pebp2αA in vitro by biochemical assay. For confirming the availability of Til-1 overexpression, we transplanted Til-1-overexpressing osteoprogenitor cells/porous ceramic composites into ectopic (subcutaneous) and orthotopic (bone defect) sites in Fischer rats (cultured bone transplantation model). The formation of bone was markedly increased by the overexpression, with negligible risk of tumorigenesis during the experimental period. Moreover, for investigating the mechanism of bone formation, we examined the in vivo bone formation in this model by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of the Y-chromosome of the osteoblastic cells from male Fischer rats transplanted into female rats. Cells and Culture—Experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Japanese Government for the care and use of laboratory animals. Rat bone marrow-derived osteoprogenitor cells were obtained from the femora of male Fischer 344 (7-week-old) rats using the method of Maniatopoulos et al. (34Maniatopoulos C. Sodek J. Melcher A.H. Cell Tissue Res. 1988; 254: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). The epiphyses of both bone sides were removed and the marrow cavity was flushed out with medium A (minimal essential medium (Nakarai Tescue, Kyoto, Japan) containing 15% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and antibiotic-antimycotic (Invitrogen) using a syringe. The primary cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air with 5% CO2 until nearly confluent. Subsequently, cells were treated with 0.1% trypsin including 0.02% EDTA, and subcultured under the appropriate conditions for the following experiments. Construction of a Recombinant Adenoviral Vector Carrying the Cbfa1 Gene—The plasmids/pSG5/IT (mPebp2aA) and pSG5/KS (mTil-1) carrying Cbfa1 cDNA were kindly provided by Sumitomo Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. Two kinds of cDNA encoding mouse Cbfa1/Pebp2αA (GenBank™ accession number D14636) and mouse Cbfa1/Til-1 (GenBank accession number AF010284) were obtained by digestion with the BamHI and BglII restriction enzymes, respectively. Recombinant adenoviral vectors that carried an expression cassette containing the cytomegalovirus IE enhancer, chicken β-actin promoter, mouse Cbfa1 (Cbfa1/Pebp2αA or Cbfa1/Til-1) cDNA, and rabbit β-globin poly(A) signal were constructed using an Adenovirus Cre/loxP kit (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan). The ends of these cDNAs were blunted for subcloning into the SwaI site of the pAxCALNLw cosmid. Each cosmid and adenoviral DNA-terminal protein complex was co-transfected into the E1-transcomplemental cell line 293. The recombinant adenoviruses (Adv-pebp2αA and Adv-til-1) generated by homologous recombination were isolated, and the insertion of each cDNA was confirmed by digestion using restriction enzymes. Two adenoviral vectors, Adv-cre (Cre recombinase) and Adv-β-galactosidase, attached to an Adenovirus Cre/loxP kit, were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Adv-cre was co-transfected with the vector of interest to induce the gene expression. Alkaline Phosphatase Activity—The cells were seeded at 3 × 105 cells/well on φ3.5-cm dishes (three dishes for each group) in medium B (medium A containing an osteoblastic supplement (10 mm β-glycerophosphate (Sigma), 50 μg/ml l-ascorbic acid phosphate (Wako, Osaka, Japan), and 10 nm dexamethasone (Sigma)). Twenty four hours later (day 0), the cells were exposed to Adv-pebp2αA or Adv-til-1 at a multiplicity of infection of 400 and Adv-cre at a multiplicity of infection of 400 in 100 μl of minimal essential medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum for 1 h. Then, 3 ml of medium B was added to dilute the viruses. On the days indicated after infection, cells were harvested by low speed centrifugation, and disrupted in 0.1 m Tris (pH 7.4) containing 1% Triton X-100 and 5 mm MgCl2 by sonication. After centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 10 min, supernatants were collected. Aliquots of 2.5 μl from each sample were added to 250 μl of alkaline phosphatase substrate buffer containing 0.056 m 2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propandiol (pH 9.0), 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and 2 mm MgCl2 and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The enzymatic activity of alkaline phosphatase was calculated after measuring the absorbance of the p-nitrophenol product at 405 nm on a microplate reader (Bio-Rad). The activity was expressed as millimolar of p-nitrophenol/10,000 cells. Calcium Content—Ten, 14, and 21 days after infection, cells were fixed with 10% formalin-neutralized buffer for 15 min and extracted with 0.6 m HCl at 4 °C overnight. The calcium content of each sample was determined with a calcium assay kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Alizarin Red Staining—Fourteen and 21 days after infection, cells were fixed with 10% formalin-neutralized buffer for 15 min, stained with 1% Alizarin red (pH 4.0) for 2 min, and then washed with deionized water. For control experiment, the uninfected cells and the cells infected only with Adv-cre were stained. Northern Blotting—On the days indicated after infection, total RNA was isolated from osteoblast cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Aliquots (30 μg) of total RNA were separated on a 1% agarose, 5.5% formaldehyde gel and blotted onto Hybond™-XL membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Probes for cDNA encoding mouse Cbfa1 (GenBank accession number AF010284), rat osteocalcin (GenBank accession number X04141), and human GAPDH (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) using Rediprime™ (Amersham Biosciences). After hybridization at 68 °C for 3 h in PerfectHyb™ Plus Hybridization Buffer (Sigma) with the labeled cDNA probe (2 × 106 cpm/ml), the membrane was washed with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, and then twice with 0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS. The washed blot was exposed to Kodak X-AR film for 1 day. Cultured Bone Transplantation Model—β-Tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) cubic blocks (5 × 5 × 5 mm3 and 2 × 2 × 2 mm3) were kindly provided by Olympus Optical Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). The solid and porous components of the microstructure are well interconnected. The average pore is 200 μm in diameter. After 10 days of primary culture, the cells were treated with 0.25% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA, harvested by low speed centrifugation, and resuspended in fresh medium at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml. β-TCP blocks were soaked in the cell suspension and incubated for 2 h in a CO2 incubator. The blocks were transferred to 24-well plates (single block per well) and cultured in medium B for 24 h. The cells/β-TCP composites were incubated in minimal essential medium with 5% fetal bovine serum containing Adv-til-1 (2 × 108 plaque-forming units/ml) and Adv-cre (2 × 108 plaque-forming units/ml) for 2 h. Then the composites were transferred to fresh plates and cultured for 24 h. Uninfected cells/β-TCP composites were used as a control. As shown in Fig. 3, the composites (5 × 5 × 5 mm3) were implanted subcutaneously in the back of Fischer rats; three infected cells composites were implanted separately on the right side, and control composites were implanted separately on the left side. As an in vivo bone defect model, the lateral side of the distal end of the rat femur shaft was exposed and incised surgically. Bilateral bone defects were created by making a hole 2 mm in diameter and 3 mm deep on the coronal face at the distal end of each femur. The composites (2 × 2 × 2 mm3) were implanted into these holes (right side; Adv-til-1-infected group, left side; control group), and then the wounds were sutured. Histological Analysis—The cells/β-TCP composites and bone tissues were collected, at 3 days, 3, 5, and 8 weeks after implantation. Samples were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 1% glutaraldehyde, decalcified with 0.1 m Tris (pH 7.4), 0.5 m EDTA, and embedded in paraffin. Serial sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunostained as described below. Sections were observed by an Olympus IX-70 microscope (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a cooled CCD camera (CoolSNAP HQ, ROPER Scientific, Tucson, AZ) and digital images were analyzed by MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging Corporation, Downingtown, PA). The bone-regenerated area in the composites was determined by both H&E staining and immunostaining of osteocalcin. For the analysis of the subcutaneous implantation experiment, the full images of three different depth sections from the same composite (n = 6) were analyzed. The average percentage of bone area relative to the pores area of each implant was calculated. For the analysis of the bone defect model, different depth sections (3–5 sections, n = 3) were chosen from cortical bone area. The average percentage of the bone-regenerated area relative to the implanted composite area of each implant was calculated. Immunohistochemistry—5-μm thick paraffin-embedded tissue sections were deparaffinized, and digested with proteinase K solution (DakoCytomation, Inc., Glostrup, Denmark), followed by incubating with Peroxidase Blocking Reagent (DakoCytomation). Sections were incubated with Blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics), and immunostained with mouse monoclonal anti-osteocalcin antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA), monoclonal anti-human/mouse/rat alkaline phosphatase antibody (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN), or anti-rat osteopontin antibody (MPIIIB10, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa, IA). A horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) was applied, and color was developed by incubation with DAKO Liquid 3,3′-diaminobenzidene substrate-chromogen (DakoCytomation). 3,3′-Diaminobenzidene-stained sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Digital images were taken using a microscope (IX-70, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a CCD camera (CoolSNAP cf, ROPER Scientific) and analyzed by MetaMorph software. For immunofluorecence staining, the DakoCytomation CSA II kit (DakoCytomation) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions, and 1 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole was used for counterstaining of nuclei. Double stained images were taken using a Axioplan2 imaging microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) equipped with a cooled CCD camera (CoolSNAP HQ, ROPER Scientific) and analyzed by MetaMorph software. FISH Analysis for the Y-chromosomes of Donor Cells from Male Fischer Rats Transplanted into Female Rats—For visualizing the male donor cells and their derived cells transplanted in female recipient rats, FISH for the Y-chromosome was performed according to a previous report (35Krause D.S. Theise N.D. Collector M.I. Henegariu O. Hwang S. Gardner R. Neutzel S. Sharkis S.J. Cell. 2001; 105: 369-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2448) Google Scholar). The Y-chromosome probe was generated by PCR amplification from a male rat bone marrow genomic DNA template. Primer pairs were 5′-GTGGAGAGAGGCGCAAGTT-3′ (60–80)/5′-AGGGTCGGTCACCAGTGATA-3′ (569–549) and 5′-TGCAATGGGACAACAACCTA-3′ (315–335)/5′-TAGTGGAACTGGTGCTGCTG-3′ (519–499) in the rat sry sequence (sry3, GenBank accession number AF275682), and the probe was labeled by incorporation of digoxigenin-dUTP. Slides containing 3-μm thick tissue sections were deparaffinized and digested with 10 μg/ml proteinase K for 45 min at 37 °C. Slides were denatured and hybridized overnight at 37 °C with 25 ng of digoxigenin-labeled probe in hybridization buffer (50% formamide) for each slide. Detection was performed using anti-digoxigenin-rhodamine (Roche), and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole was used for nuclear counterstaining. Double-stained images were taken using an Olympus IX-70 microscope (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a cooled CCD camera (CoolSNAP HQ, ROPER Scientific, USA) and analyzed by MetaMorph software. Biochemical Analysis of Implanted Blocks—The composites were collected and used for biochemical analysis at 0, 3, and 5 weeks after implantation. They were homogenized in 0.5 ml of 0.1 m Tris (pH 7.4) containing 1% Triton X-100 and 5 mm MgCl2, and centrifuged at 6,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was assayed for alkaline phosphatase activity as described above. Osteocalcin was extracted from the sediment with 20% formic acid over a period of 1 week at 4 °C. The extract was desalted with a Sephadex G-25 column, and protein fractions were used to determine the concentration of osteocalcin with a Rat Osteocalcin EIA Kit (Biomedical Technologies Inc., Stoughton, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from collected composites using TRIzol reagent. For reverse transcription, the reaction mixture contained 2 μg of RNA, 2.5 μm oligo(dT) primer, and 5 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (TaKaRa) in a total volume of 20 μl. The reaction was run for 1 h at 42 °C and stopped by heating for 5 min at 99 °C. Aliquots (0.5 μl) of the reverse transcriptase products were amplified in a reaction mixture (20 μl) containing Light-Cycler™-FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I, 0.5 μm of each primer, and 3 mm MgCl2 using a LightCycler™ (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After preincubation at 95 °C for 10 min, a PCR was performed with 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing at 60 °C for 5 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 10 s. A single fluorescence reading was taken in each cycle following the elongation step. The primers used were as follows: total Cbfa1/Til-1 (exogenous and endogenous Cbfa1 expression, GenBank accession number AF010284), 5′-TGCCACTCAGAAGACTGTGG-3′ and 5′-TTCAGCTCTGGGATGACCTT-3′: c-jun (rat c-jun mRNA, GenBank accession number X17163), 5′-AGTCTCAGGAGCGGATCAAG-3′ and 5′-TTTTGCGCTTTCAAGGTTTT-3′; c-myc (rat c-myc mRNA, GenBank accession number Y00396), 5′-GACCAGATCCCTGAGTTGGA-3′ and 5′-CTCGCCGTTTCCTCAGTAAG-3′; c-fos (rat c-fos mRNA, GenBank accession number X06769), 5′-GGAGCCGGTCAAGAACATTA-3′ and 5′-GAAGGAACCAGACAGGTCCA-3′ and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GenBank accession number BC059110) as an internal standard, 5′-TGGCCTCCAAGGAGTAAGAA-3′ and 5′-TGTGAGGGAGATGCTCAGTG-3′. To amplify only the Adv-derived exogenous Cbfa1 transcript, Adv-derived Cbfa1/Til-1 primers (5′-AATGATGGTGTTGACGCTGA-3′ and 5′-CCAGCCACCACCTTCTGATA-3′) were constructed against the vector-specific 3′-untranslated region (rabbit β-globin, GenBank accession number V00878) and the Cbfa1 cDNA (GenBank number AF010284) internal region. The relative mRNA levels for each condition were determined by performing quantitative RT-PCR three times for each of the two independent batches. Statistical Analysis—Average values of ALP activity, calcium content, OCN expression, mRNA expressions of Cbfa1/Til-1, c-fos, c-myc, c-jun, and regenerated bone area were calculated, expressed as the arithmetic mean ± S.E., and plotted in the graphs. Paired t test was used for statistical evaluation. The statistical significant differences between the experimental and control groups were established at the p < 0.05 (*) and p < 0.01 (**) levels. In Vitro Effect of Cbfa1 Overexpression in Primary Osteoprogenitor Cells—First, we examined the effect that the overexpression of Cbfa1 has on the differentiation of rat bone marrow-derived primary osteoprogenitor cells, cultured by the methods of Maniatopoulos et al. (34Maniatopoulos C. Sodek J. Melcher A.H. Cell Tissue Res. 1988; 254: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). Adenovirus-mediated Gene Expression in Primary Osteoblasts—Rat bone marrow-derived osteoprogenitor cells were infected with a recombinant adenovirus encoding the two Cbfa1 isoforms (mouse Pebp2αA and mouse Til-1) (Fig. 1A).

During folding, Gas3/PMP22 associates with the lectin chaperone calnexin. Here, we show that calnexin interacts with the misfolded transmembrane domains of Gas3/PMP22, fused to green fluorescent protein, in a glycan-independent manner. In addition, photobleaching experiments in living cells revealed that Gas3/PMP22-green fluorescent protein mutants are mobile but diffuse at almost half the diffusion coefficient of wild type protein.

Gas3/PMP22 encodes a tetraspan protein component of the compact myelin that is highly expressed in Schwann cells (1Spreyer P. Kuhn G. Hanemann C.O. Gillen C. Schaal H. Kuhn R. Lemke G. Muller H.W.

Different genetic alterations in Gas3/PMP22 are responsible for a group of inherited neuropathies of the peripheral nervous system characterized by myelin dysfunction (4Patel P.I. Lupski J.R.

Point mutations causing hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies result in either a premature termination of the translation or the synthesis of a longer altered protein (inherited peripheral mutation database IPNMDB, molgen-www.uia.ac.be/CMTMutations/). Other mutations are predicted to alter the splicing process and generate a nonfunctional protein. Overall, Gas3/PMP22 point mutations responsible for hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies cause a loss of function (8Meuleman J. Pou-Serradell A. Lofgren A. Ceuterick C.

Missense mutations localized in the transmembrane domains of the protein have been found in patients with the more severe forms of CMT1A and the Dejerine Sottas syndrome (6Naef R. Suter U. Res. Tech. 1998; 41: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Dejerine Sottas syndrome is characterized by an earlier age of onset and a more severe phenotype than CMT1A (9Nelis E. Haites N. Van Broeckhoven C. Hum. Mutat. 1999; 13: 11-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The disease mechanism of the missense mutations is well established. These mutants are dominant gain of function mutations that impair the normal intracellular trafficking of the protein, causing intracellular accumulation of the protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or in the intermediate compartment. Moreover, Gas3/PMP22 mutants tend to form cytosolic aggresomes that may be protective (10D'Urso D. Prior R. Greiner-Petter R. Gabreels-Festen A.A. Muller H.W. J.

However, whether these misfolding mutations result in disease because of the oligomerization-dependent intracellular sequestration of the wild type (wt) form or by affecting the integrity and function of the ER is still debated (12Tobler A.R. Notterpek L. Naef R. Taylor V. Suter U. Shooter E.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2027-2036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Tobler A.R. Liu N. Mueller L. Shooter E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Incorrect assembly targets proteins for degradation (19Cabral C.M. Liu Y. Sifers R.N. Trends Biochem.

The lectins calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT) are critical elements of ER quality control for glycoproteins. These lectins interact with glycoproteins in the presence of monoglucosylated N-glycans (21Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). During maturation, glucosidase II removes the remaining glucose from the glycan, and interaction with lectin is terminated (20Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 22Trombetta E.S. Parodi A.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

If not, re-addition of a glucose to the N-linked glycan occurs by the action of a folding sensor: the UDP-glucose glycoprotein glucosyltransferase. Next, the glycoprotein is again recognized by CNX and CRT (20Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 21Ellgaard L. Helenius A.

The CNX/CRT cycle prevents premature oligomeric assembly and export of misfolded glycoproteins from the ER (21Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). Recently, it has demonstrated that Gas3/PMP22 interacts with CNX in sciatic nerves and that this interaction is prolonged in the case of mutant Gas3/PMP22 (18Dickson K.M. Bergeron J.J. Shames I. Colby J. Nguyen D.T. Chevet E. Thomas D.Y. Snipes G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9852-9857Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This result suggested that sequestration by CNX may be relevant for CMT1A-related neuropathies. In this study, we have demonstrated that Gas3/PMP22 interacts with CNX in a glycan-dependent manner, whereas the CMT1A mutant Gas3/PMP22-L16P interacts with CNX in a glycan-independent manner. The glycan-independent interaction of CNX with Gas3/PMP22 occurs via the first transmembrane domain of the tetraspan. In addition, we also demonstrate that the L16P mutant fails to associate with membrane rafts and instead forms high molecular weight oligomers by intermolecular disulfide bonds. Our results provide new insight into the mechanisms responsible for the intracellular retention of Gas3/PMP22 missense mutants. Cell Culture—U2OS osteosarcoma cells, 293, and IMR90-E1A cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. Transfection of cells was performed using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. U2OS cells stably expressing Gas3/PMP22, Gas3/PMP22-L16P, Gas3/PMP22-N41Q, and Gas3/PMP22-L16P/N41Q were selected for resistance to G418. Microinjection and Time Lapse—Nuclear microinjection was performed using the Automated Injection System (Zeiss-Germany) as described previously (26Chies R. Nobbio L. Edomi P. Schenone A. Schneider C. Brancolini C. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 987-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Different expression vectors were injected into the nuclei of cells for 0.5 s at a constant pressure of 50 hectopascals. For time-lapse analysis, cells were plated directly onto Petri dishes and observed shortly after microinjection. Time-lapse analysis was performed with a Leica TCS SP laser scanning microscope in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Plasmid Construction—Fig. 1 schematically depicts the computer-predicted topology of Gas3/PMP22 and the different point mutants used in this study. For expression in eukaryotic cells, human gas3/PMP22 and its point-mutated derivatives (13Brancolini C. Edomi P. Marzinotto S. Schneider C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2901-2914Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech). A sense primer (5′-GAGTGAATTCAACTCCGCTGAGCAGAACTT-3′) containing an EcoRI site and a reverse primer (5′-CGAGGATCCTCGCGTTTCCGCAAGATCA-3′) containing a BamHI site were used. The first transmembrane (TM) domains (TM1) of Gas3/PMP22 and Gas3/PMP22-L16P including four juxtamembrane amino acids (amino acids 1–34) were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pEGFP-N1 vector by using TM1up primer (5′-GAGTGAATTCAACTCCGCTGAGCAGAACTT-3′) containing an EcoRI primer and TM1down primer (5′-CATGTCGACGCGTGTCCATTGCCCAC-3′) containing a SalI site. All constructs generated were sequenced using an automated system (ABI PRISM 310) to check the fidelity of the inserted PCR fragments. The construction of mGF-PSec61γ has been described previously (27Snapp E.L. Hegde R.S. Francolini M. Lombardo F. Colombo S. Pedrazzini E. Borgese N. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Detergent Solubilization—Cells expressing wt or L16P were lysed on ice with 1% Triton X-100 (TX-100), 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin at 4 °C for 30 min. The lysates were scraped from the dishes with a rubber policeman and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 min into a pellet and supernatant. To remove cholesterol before TX-100 extraction, cells were pretreated with 10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C for 60 min. Sucrose Gradient Fractionation—Sucrose gradient fractionation was performed as described previously (28Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar). Monolayers of cells were lysed for 20 min in TNE/TX-100 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% TX-100). Lysates were scraped from the dish and brought to 40% sucrose using 80% sucrose in TNE (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA) without TX-100. A linear sucrose gradient (5–30% in TNE without TX-100) was layered over the lysates in an ultracentrifuge tube. Gradients were centrifuged for 18 h at 40,000 rpm at 4 °C in a TST 35.5 Beckman rotor. Fractions were precipitated in 80% acetone, and pellets were solubilized in SDS buffer. The pellet from the bottom of the tube was solubilized by SDS buffer and loaded as insoluble pellet. Immunoprecipitation—Cells were extracted in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1% CHAPS containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin), and after centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, the anti-GFP antibody (29Paroni G. Mizzau M. Henderson C. Sal DelG. Schneider C. Brancolini C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2804-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) was added. After 3 h on ice, protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was added, and incubation was prolonged for 1 h on ice. After a brief centrifugation in an Eppendorf centrifuge, immunoprecipitates were washed four times with lysis buffer. Immunocomplexes were released by boiling for 5 min in SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel. Immunofluorescence and Photobleaching Experiments—For immunofluorescence microscopy, cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.1% TX-100. Coverslips were labeled with either anticalnexin (Transduction Laboratories) or anti-calreticulin (StressGen) followed by TRITC-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Sigma). Cells were imaged with a Leica TCS SP microscope with a 488–534 λ Ar laser and a 633 λ HeNe laser. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments were performed on a temperature- and CO2-controlled stage with a Leica TCS SP confocal microscope using the 488 nm and 518 nm lines of the Ar laser with a 63 × 1.4 NA oil objective. FRAP experiments were performed by photobleaching a 12.5 × 12.5-μm region of interest (ROI) at full laser power. Deff was determined using an inhomogeneous diffusion simulation (30Siggia E.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Bekiranov S. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1761-1770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The mobile fraction (Mf) was calculated as described previously (31Snapp E.L. Altan N. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Bonifacino J. Dasso M. Harford J.B. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yamada K.M. Current Protocols in Cell Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York2003: 21.1.1-21.1.23Google Scholar). Image analysis was performed using Metamorph 6.04 (Universal Imaging Corp.). Immunoblotting and Enzymatic Treatments—Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (pore size, 0.2 μm; Schleicher and Schuell) using a semidry blotting apparatus (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were incubated overnight at room temperature with anti-GFP, anti-calnexin (Transduction Laboratories), anti-ERp44 (32Anelli T. Alessio M. Mezghrani A. Simmen T. Talamo F. Bachi A. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 835-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), anti-ERp57 (Stressgen), anti-N-cadherin (Sigma), anti-PDI (Transduction Laboratories), or anti-p62 (Transduction Laboratories) primary antibodies followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit (Sigma) or goat anti-mouse (Euroclone) secondary antibodies. Blots were developed with Super Signal West Pico or Dura, as recommended by the vendor (Pierce). PNGaseF treatment of cellular lysates and immunoblotting analyses were performed as described previously (33Fabbretti E. Edomi P. Brancolini C. Schneider C. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1846-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). For endoglycosidase H treatment, the cellular lysates were prepared in 0.5% SDS and 1% β-mercaptoethanol and denatured by boiling for 10 min, and then 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, and 1% Nonidet P-40 were added. After the addition of 1 milliunit of endoglycosidase H (EndoH; Roche Applied Science), samples were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. CNX Interacts with Gas3/PMP22 and Gas3/PMP22-L16P— CNX is a non-glycosylated type I membrane resident ER protein, and it represents a major component of the molecular chaperone system, which ensures exit from the ER of correctly folded proteins (34Helenius A. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar). CNX contains a lectin site with specificity for the oligosaccharide-processing intermediate Glc1Man9GlcNAc2. Unlike classical chaperones, CNX is proposed to retain the unfolded glycoproteins and to coordinate the activities of other ER chaperones such as ERp57. Recent studies have demonstrated that CNX can interact with both wt and misfolded Gas3/PMP22 in sciatic nerves (18Dickson K.M. Bergeron J.J. Shames I. Colby J. Nguyen D.T. Chevet E. Thomas D.Y. Snipes G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9852-9857Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To investigate the ability of CNX to interact with Gas3/PMP22 and the point mutant L16P responsible for CMT1A, we employed co-immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments. Cells stably expressing wt or L16P were lysed, and the same amounts of proteins were immunoprecipitated using an anti-GFP antibody. Immunoblots of the IP eluates were probed with an anti-CNX antibody. Fig. 2A reveals that, at steady state, the misfolded mutant L16P strongly interacts with CNX, whereas Gas3/PMP22 only weakly interacts with this lectin. As expected, in total lysates loaded to verify transfection efficiency, the wt was present as a doublet representing the pre-Golgi and post-Golgi forms, whereas L16P was detected solely as the pre-Golgi form (see Fig. 4A for a detailed characterization). Immunofluorescence studies confirmed that in stably transfected cells, the vast majority of wt was exposed on the cell surface, whereas the L16P mutant was retained in the ER (data not shown).Fig. 4L16P fails to associate with lipid rafts. A, characterization of the GFP-tagged wt, N41Q, and L16P in cells stably expressing them. Immunoblots were performed using an anti-GFP antibody. Cellular lysates were treated with PNGaseF or endoglycosidase H. B, cells stably expressing wt or L16P were lysed in TX-100 buffer to fractionate soluble (SN) and insoluble (P) proteins as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Immunoblots were performed using the indicated antibodies. C, cells stably expressing wt or L16P were lysed in TNE/TX100 buffer. Lysates were adjusted to 40% sucrose, and sucrose gradients (5–30%) were formed over them (28Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar). P, sucrose gradient pellet. Fraction 9 is from the bottom of the gradient. Cells were treated with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) as indicated. Immunoblots were performed using the indicated antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because the majority of wt Gas3/PMP22 in stably transfected cells trafficked to the cell surface, we investigated whether newly synthesized wt protein was able to interact with CNX, similarly to the misfolded mutants when present in the ER. To this end, we performed anti-CNX co-IPs of lysates of transiently transfected cells expressing wt or L16P constructs, 30 h after transfection. Under these conditions, consistent amounts of wt could be detected as a pre-Golgi form (Fig. 2B), similar to the L16P mutant. The same amounts of cellular lysates were immunoprecipitated using an antibody against GFP. After electrophoretic separation, the immunoblots were probed with anti-CNX antibody. Fig. 2B demonstrates that both wt and L16P interact with CNX. The same blot was also probed with an antibody against GFP to demonstrate that wt and L16P were immunoprecipitated with similar efficiencies. In total lysates, wt was present as a doublet of bands representing the pre- and post-Golgi forms. These results suggest that wt only transiently associates with CNX, whereas the misfolded ER-retained mutant L16P forms a stable complex with CNX. CNX Interacts with Gas3/PMP22 in a Glycan-dependent Manner and with Gas3/PMP22-L16P in a Glycan-independent Manner—Folding substrates interact with CNX via their monoglucosylated N-linked glycans (23Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 35Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). However, some reports have indicated that CNX can bind to polypeptide segments of both glycosylated and non-glycosylated proteins (36Cannon K.S. Hebert D.N. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14280-14284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 37Ihara Y. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Saito Y. Williams D.B. Mol.

To investigate whether Gas3/PMP22-CNX interactions are glycan-independent or -dependent, we utilized the glycosylation-defective mutants N41Q and L16P/N41Q. Cells transiently transfected with wt, the single mutants L16P and N41Q, or the double mutant L16P/N41Q were lysed and immunoprecipitated using an anti-GFP antibody. After electrophoretic separation, the immunoblots were probed with anti-CNX antibody. Surprisingly, Fig. 2C shows that only the glycosylation-defective mutant N41Q was unable to interact with CNX, whereas the double mutant L16P/N41Q efficiently formed a complex with CNX. The same blot was also analyzed with anti-GFP antibody to confirm that the pre-Golgi forms of wt and L16P, L16P/N41Q, and N41Q mutants were similarly immunoprecipitated. We observed similar results in stably transfected cells. The double mutant L16P/N41Q was recognized by anti-CNX, similar to L16P (Fig. 2D). In stably transfected cells, a reduced amount of pre-Golgi wt protein was detected by co-IP, and therefore, interaction with CNX was barely detectable. The interaction between L16P/N41Q and CNX was consistently observed in 10 different co-IP experiments and by using different detergents such as CHAPS and Triton X-100. Furthermore, binding to CNX was similarly observed when L16P/N41Q was fused to the shorter FLAG tag instead of the GFP, and IPs were performed with the anti-FLAG antibody (data not shown). Next, we investigated whether the double mutant L16P/N41Q was able to interact with CNX in other cell lines. IMR90-E1A and 293 cells transiently transfected with wt, single mutants L16P and N41Q, or the double mutant L16P/N41Q were lysed and immunoprecipitated using the anti-GFP antibody. After electrophoretic separation, the immunoblots were probed with anti-CNX antibody. Fig. 2, E and F, reveals that the double mutant L16P/N41Q efficiently formed a complex with CNX in 293 and IMR90-E1A cells. Curiously, in 293 cells, it seems that the L16P/N41Q mutant was less efficient in binding CNX than the L16P mutant. The same blot was also analyzed with anti-GFP antibody to confirm that the pre-Golgi forms of wt and L16P, L16P/N41Q, and N41Q mutants were similarly immunoprecipitated. N-Glycosylation Is Not Required for Intracellular Retention and Aggresome Formation by Misfolded Gas3/PMP22 Mutants—Gas3/PMP22-L16P exhibits trafficking defects (10D'Urso D. Prior R.

Therefore, we asked whether N-glycosylation plays a role in the ER retention and aggresome formation of Gas3/PMP22 mutants. Immunofluorescence analysis for GFP and CNX was performed in U2OS cells transiently expressing wt, the single mutant L16P, or the double mutant L16/N41Q (Fig. 3). The wt protein was exported to the cell surface and triggered the formation of endocytotic vacuoles that did not co-localize with CNX, similar to previous results (26Chies R. Nobbio L. Edomi P. Schenone A. Schneider C. Brancolini C. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 987-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Both of the mutated proteins were retained in the ER and formed aggresome structures. This result confirmed that N-glycosylation is not required for the formation of aggresomes by ER-retained proteins (42Shames I. Fraser A. Colby J. Orfali W. Snipes G.J. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2003; 62: 751-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Interestingly, not all of the aggresomes induced by L16P were positive for CNX (Fig. 3, arrowheads). This heterogeneous pattern of CNX localization within the aggresomes was more evident for the glycan-defective mutant L16/N41Q. The heterogeneity may reflect differences in aggresome maturity. Similar results were obtained when immunofluorescence studies were performed in IMR90-E1A and 293 cells (data not shown). Gas3/PMP22-L16P Fails to Associate with Membrane Rafts— At steady state, wt is present as three distinct bands on an immunoblot (Fig. 4A). Enzymatic treatments with PNGaseF and endoglycosidase H demonstrate that the faster migrating band is a deglycosylated form, whereas the intermediate band represents the pre-Golgi form, and the slow migrating band is the post-Golgi, mature form of Gas3/PMP22. Surprisingly, the co-IP studies in Fig. 2 suggest that wt, immunoprecipitated under native conditions, is present primarily as an immature form with the same electrophoretic profile as the pre-Golgi mutant L16P (see Fig. 2). Given that the wt protein reaches the cell surface, we considered the possibility that the post-Golgi form of wt was not immunoprecipitated under our experimental conditions. Recent studies have indicated an association of Gas3/PMP22 with glycosphingolipid/cholesterol-enriched membranes, also known as lipid rafts (43Erne B. Sansano S. Frank M. Schaeren-Wiemers N. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 550-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 44Hasse B. Bosse F. Muller H.W. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 69: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We postulated that the failure to immunoprecipitate the mature form of wt under non-denaturing conditions could be dependent"

In this study, the spectroscopic and redox properties of a new CooA homologue from Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans (Ch-CooA) were studied. Spectroscopic and mutagenesis studies revealed that His-82 and the N-terminal α-amino group were the axial ligands of the Fe(III) and Fe(II) hemes in Ch-CooA and that the N-terminal α-amino group was replaced by CO upon CO binding. Two neutral ligands, His-82 and the N-terminal α-amino group, are coordinated to the Fe(III) heme in Ch-CooA, whereas two negatively charged ligands, a thiolate from Cys-75 and the nitrogen atom of the N-terminal Pro, are the axial ligands of the Fe(III) heme in Rr-CooA. The difference in the coordination structure of the Fe(III) heme resulted in a large positive shift of redox potentials of Ch-CooA compared with Rr-CooA. Comparing the properties of Ch-CooA and Rr-CooA demonstrates that the essential elements for CooA function will be: (i) the heme is six-coordinate in the Fe(III), Fe(II), and Fe(II)–CO forms; (ii) the N-terminal is coordinated to the heme as an axial ligand, and (iii) CO replaces the N-terminal bound to the heme upon CO binding.

The amino acid sequence and the crystal structure of Rr-CooA are homologous to those of CRP, cAMP receptor protein from Escherichia coli, revealing that CooA belongs to the CRP/FNR family of transcriptional regulators (7Shelver D.

Although these properties have been characterized in detail, it is not clear if they are essential for CooA function. Recently, some genes have been discovered as possible candidates for CooA homologues by a homology search on DNA databases (12Voordouw G. J.

However, detailed properties of these CooA homologues have not yet been clarified. C. hydrogenoformans is a CO-utilizing thermophilic anaerobic bacterium that utilizes CO as the sole energy and carbon source (14Svetlichny V.A. Sokolova T.G. Gerhardt M. Ringpfeil N.A.

The amino acid sequence of Ch-CooA, which is deduced from the DNA sequence, shows significant identity (31%) and similarity (55%) to that of Rr-CooA (13Youn H. Kerby R.L. Conrad M. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1320-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cys and His, which are the fifth ligand of the Fe(III) and Fe(II) hemes (Cys-75 and His-77 in Rr-CooA), are conserved in Ch-CooA at the corresponding positions (Cys-80 and His-82 in Ch-CooA). However, the sixth ligand of the Fe(III) and Fe(II) hemes, Pro-2 in Rr-CooA, is not conserved in Ch-CooA. This suggests that the coordination structure of the heme will be different between Rr-CooA and Ch-CooA. Therefore, elucidating the detailed properties of Ch-CooA and comparing between Ch-CooA and Rr-CooA will provide useful information of what is essential for CooA function among the unique properties of Rr-CooA described above. In this study, we carried out spectroscopic and mutagenesis studies of Ch-CooA and found that Ch-CooA has a different coordination structure of the heme, which results in a different redox property of Ch-CooA compared with Rr-CooA. We propose essential factors for CooA function based on the comparison of Ch-CooA and Rr-CooA. C. hydrogenoformans (DMS 6008) was obtained from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures. The sequence data of the ch-cooA gene were obtained from The Institute for Genomic Research website at www.tigr.org. The ch-cooA gene was prepared by PCR with the chromosomal DNA of C. hydrogenoformans and two synthetic deoxyoligonucleotides (5′-AGGAGAGGACTATGGCCACCCAAATGAGATTAACCGAC-3′ and 5′-TTACTAAACGCCTGAGGAAAACTC-3′) as the template, a sense primer, and an antisense primer, respectively. The PCR product was cloned into a pCR™2.1 vector by using a TOPO TA Cloning kit (Invitrogen) to obtain pCR-Ch-CooA. For the following manipulation, an EcoRI site (GAATTC, 36–41) in the ch-cooA gene was changed to GAACTC by using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to obtain pCR-Ch-CooA (ΔEcoRI). The encoding amino acid is not changed by this mutation. The DNA fragment, containing the ch-cooA gene excised from pCR-Ch-CooA (ΔEcoRI) by digestion with EcoRI, was ligated with EcoRI-treated pKK223–3 to construct pKK-Ch-CooA. The DNA sequence was analyzed using a ABI PRISM® 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). E. coli JM109 was used as a host for the expression of Ch-CooA. pKK-Ch-CooA/E. coli JM109 was pre-cultured for 5 h at 37 °C in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. The pre-cultured cells (0.4 ml) were inoculated into 400 ml of TB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin in a 2-liter cultivation flask, which was then cultured for 14 h at 37 °C with a rotary shaker. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5 mm in final concentration) was then added, and the culture continued for 4 h at 37 °C. After the harvested cells were washed once with 20 mm MES-NaOH buffer (pH 6.0) (buffer A), they were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until use. The frozen cells were suspended in buffer A containing 1 mm of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, which was sonicated on ice. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 75,600 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer A. After loading the supernatant, the column was washed with buffer A. The adsorbed proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 1 m in buffer A. The eluted fractions containing Ch-CooA were combined, and ammonium sulfate fractionation was carried out. The precipitate obtained at 40–65% saturation of ammonium sulfate was collected by centrifugation and dissolved in buffer A. To remove the ammonium sulfate, the resulting solution was applied to a Sephadex G-25 column pre-equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.15 m NaCl. The fractions containing Ch-CooA were combined and then applied to a HiTrap heparin column pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 5 bed-volumes of buffer A, and then adsorbed proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 1 m in buffer A. The fractions containing Ch-CooA were combined and concentrated by ultrafiltration. The purified protein was stored at 4 °C. The type of heme in Ch-CooA was determined by the pyridine ferrohemochrome method (16Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The heme concentration was determined by means of the molar extinction coefficient for the α band of pyridine ferrohemochrome derived from a b-type heme (34 mm–1 cm–1). A molecular mass of Ch-CooA in native conditions was estimated by gel filtration with a Sephacryl S-100 column. The buffer used for gel filtration was 20 mm MOPS-NaOH (pH 7.0) containing 0.1 m NaCl. The N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined using a protein sequencer (ABI Procise 494HT). The electronic absorption spectra were recorded on a Type 8453 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies) at 20 °C. Ch-CooA was dissolved in 100 mm MES-NaOH buffer (pH 6.0) containing 0.1 m NaCl for the measurement of absorption spectra. Electrochemical redox titrations were carried out as previously reported (9Nakajima H. Honma Y. Tawara T. Kato T. Park S-Y. Miyatake H. Shiro Y. Aono S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7055-7061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Resonance Raman spectra were measured as previously reported (17Uchida T. Ishikawa H. Takahashi S.

Morishima I. Nakajima H. Aono S. Mizutani Y. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12747-12752Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, the spectra were obtained with laser excitation at 413.1 nm using a Kr+ laser (Spectra Physics, model 2016) and at 428.7 nm using a diode laser. The scattered light was collected at right angles using a collecting lens and dispersed with a single monochromator (Ritsu Oyokogaku, DG100). A charge-coupled device detector (Astromed) cooled with liquid nitrogen was used for signal detection. Raman shift was calibrated using indene as a frequency standard, providing an accuracy of ±1 cm–1 for intense isolated lines. Expression and Purification of Ch-CooA—Ch-CooA was expressed as a hemeprotein in cytosolic fraction in E. coli as is Rr-CooA. Purified Ch-CooA migrated as a single band of 26.0-kDa molecular mass on a SDS-PAGE gel, which is consistent with the calculated value (25.1 kDa) based on the amino acid sequence of Ch-CooA. Gel filtration column chromatography revealed that the molecular mass of Ch-CooA was about 46.0 kDa (data not shown). These results indicate that Ch-CooA is a homo-dimer of an identical subunit as is Rr-CooA. The pyridine hemochromogen prepared from Ch-CooA showed the Soret, α, and β bands at 417.5, 556.0, and 524.0 nm, respectively, indicating that Ch-CooA contains a b-type heme as a prosthetic group. Quantitative analysis of the heme content by pyridine hemochromogen analysis revealed that the Ch-CooA monomer contained one protoheme. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of Ch-CooA was determined to be ATQMRLTDTN, which is identical to the N-terminal amino acid sequence deduced from the DNA sequence except for the first Met. The N-terminal Met was removed by post-translational modification. The Electronic Absorption Spectra of Ch-CooA—The electronic absorption spectra of the Fe(III), Fe(II), and Fe(II)–CO forms of Ch-CooA are shown in Fig. 1. Fe(III) Ch-CooA showed the Soret, α, and β bands at 415, 559, and 529 nm, respectively. Fe(II) Ch-CooA, formed by reducing the Fe(III) form with sodium dithionite, showed the Soret, α, and β bands at 424, 559, and 529 nm, respectively. Upon the reaction of Fe(II) Ch-CooA with CO, Fe(II)–CO Ch-CooA was formed. Fe(II)–CO Ch-CooA showed the Soret, α, and β bands at 421, 569, and 538 nm, respectively. These spectra of Ch-CooA are typical of six-coordinate, low spin heme proteins. The absorption peaks are summarized in Table I compared with those of Rr-CooA. Although the spectra of Fe(II) and Fe(II)–CO Ch-CooA were nearly identical to those of Rr-CooA, the spectrum of Fe(III) Ch-CooA was different from that of Rr-CooA. The Soret peak of Fe(III) Ch-CooA was blue-shifted by 9 nm compared with that of Fe(III) Rr-CooA. Fe(III) Rr-CooA shows clear δ and CT bands at 363 and 760 nm (11Aono S. Ohkubo K. Matsuo T. Nakajima H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25757-25764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), respectively, typical of a thiolate-bound hemeprotein (19Dawson J.H. Sono M. Chem. Rev. 1987; 87: 1255-1276Crossref Scopus (483) Google Scholar). In Fe(III) Ch-CooA, however, neither the clear δ band nor the CT band due to the Fe(III)-S charge transfer was observed. These results suggest that the coordination structure of the heme iron in Fe(II) and Fe(II)–CO Ch-CooA is similar to that of Rr-CooA, whereas Fe(III) Ch-CooA has a different coordination structure from that of Rr-CooA.Table IElectronic absorption peaks of Ch-CooA and Rr-CooAProteinδSoretβαnmCh-CooA Fe(III)415529559 Fe(II)424529559 Fe(II)—CO421538569Rr-CooA Fe(III)363424539570 Fe(II)425529558 Fe(II)—CO422541569 Open table in a new tab The Resonance Raman Spectra of Ch-CooA—The resonance Raman spectra in the high frequency region are shown in Fig. 2, and the frequencies of selected marker bands are summarized in Table II. In this frequency region, ν2, ν3, and ν4 can be used as sensitive markers of the oxidation state (ν4) and spin and coordination states (ν2 and ν3) of the heme iron (20Spiro T.G. Li X.-Y. Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. III. John Wiley & Sons, New York1988: 1-37Google Scholar). The ν2, ν3, and ν4 of Fe(III) Ch-CooA were observed at 1581, 1505, and 1371 cm–1, respectively, indicating that Fe(III) Ch-CooA has a six-coordinate, low spin heme. The ν2 and ν4 frequencies of Fe(III) Ch-CooA were 4 cm–1 lower than those of Fe(III) Rr-CooA. These results of electronic absorption and resonance Raman spectroscopy suggest that the heme environmental structure of Fe(III) Ch-CooA is obviously different from that of Fe(III) Rr-CooA.Table IIRaman frequencies of WT and C80A Ch-CooA compared with those of Rr-CooAProteinVibrational modeRef.ν2ν3ν4cm-1Fe(III) Ch-CooA WT158115051371This study Ch-CooA C80A158115051371This study Rr-CooA15851504137517Uchida T.

Fe(II)–CO Ch-CooA showed the ν2, ν3, and ν4 bands at 1581, 1497, and 1371 cm–1, respectively. These frequencies of ν2, ν3, and ν4 bands for Fe(II) and Fe(II)–CO Ch-CooA were also typical of six-coordinate, low spin state hemeproteins. The resonance Raman spectra are consistent with the conclusions drawn from electronic absorption spectroscopy. Fig. 3 shows the resonance Raman spectra in the Fe–CO stretching (νFe–CO) and the C=O stretching (νC=O) frequency regions of 12CO (Fig. 3a) and 13CO-labeled CO (Fig. 3b) adducts of Fe(II) Ch-CooA. A line at 483 cm–1 (12CO) was shifted to 480 cm–1 upon the 13CO substitution. The isotope shift of 3 cm–1 is consistent with the assignment of the band at 483 cm–1 to the Fe–CO-stretching mode. The other CO isotope-sensitive band appeared at 1977 cm–1 for Fe(II)-12CO Ch-CooA and at 1934 cm–1 for Fe(II)-13CO Ch-CooA. The isotope difference spectra are delineated in Fig. 3c. Based on the frequency shift, the 1977 cm–1 band is assigned to the C=O stretching mode (νC=O). It is well known that νFe–CO and νC=O display an inverse linear correlation (21Hu S. Smith K.M. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 12638-12646Crossref Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 22Yu N.-T. Kerr E.A. Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. III.

Soc. 1991; 113: 7537-7541Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and this relationship is a useful tool for analyzing the heme ligand. The νFe–CO versus νC=O correlation depends on the nature of the proximal ligand, i.e. the CO-bound hemes with an imidazole/histidine as a trans ligand exhibit a correlation line different from those with a thiolate ligand. The νFe–CO and νC=O frequencies of Fe(II)–CO Ch-CooA are plotted in Fig. 4 together with those of His-coordinated hemeproteins. The data point for Ch-CooA fell on the imidazole/histidine correlation line. This indicates that the axial heme ligand trans to the bound CO is a histidine residue in Ch-CooA. The νFe–CO and νC-O frequencies suggest that the environment around the oxygen atom of the heme-bound CO is less hydrophobic than that of Rr-CooA. Properties of C80A and H82A Mutants—The axial ligands of the heme in Fe(III), Fe(II), and Fe(II)–CO Rr-CooA are Cys-75 and Pro-2, His-77and Pro-2, and His-77 and CO, respectively. The Cys and His are conserved in Ch-CooA at positions 80 and 82 corresponding to the positions of Cys-75 and His-77, respectively, in Rr-CooA. To elucidate if Cys-80 and His-82 are axial ligands of the heme in Ch-CooA, C80A and H82A mutants were prepared. H82A Ch-CooA, in which His-82 is replaced by Ala, was expressed as an apo-form that did not contain a heme, suggesting that His-82 is an axial ligand of the heme in Ch-CooA. On the other hand, C80A Ch-CooA, in which Cys-80 is replaced by Ala, was expressed as a holo-form containing a heme. The electronic absorption and resonance Raman spectra of C80A Ch-CooA were identical to those of wild-type (WT) Ch-CooA, as shown in Fig. 5 and Table II, respectively. In the resonance Raman spectra of Fe(III), Fe(II), and Fe(II)–CO forms of C80A Ch-CooA, the ν2, ν3, and ν4 bands appeared at the same frequencies as in the case of WT Ch-CooA. These results indicate that the Cys-80 mutation did not change the coordination structure of the heme in Ch-CooA, indicating that Cys-80 is not coordinated to the heme iron in WT Ch-CooA. Redox Titrations of Ch-CooA—Electrochemical redox titration revealed that the redox property of Ch-CooA was completely different from that of Rr-CooA. Fig. 6 shows the Nernst plots of the electrochemical redox titrations of Ch-CooA. The apparent oxidation and reduction midpoint potentials of Ch-CooA were determined to be +230 and +150 mV (versus NHE), respectively, which were positively shifted by ∼500 mV compared with those of Rr-CooA. Although the redox potentials were completely different between Ch-CooA and Rr-CooA, similar hysteresis was observed in the redox titrations of Ch-CooA as observed in the case of Rr-CooA. The apparent oxidation potential was shifted toward the positive side by +80 mV compared with the apparent reduction potential in the case of Ch-CooA. A similar positive shift of the oxidation potential is observed in Rr-CooA, where the apparent oxidation and reduction potentials were –260 and –320 mV (versus NHE), respectively (9Nakajima H.

We have characterized Ch-CooA, a CooA homologue from C. hydrogenoformans, by spectroscopic and mutagenesis studies. Ch-CooA contains a protoheme as a prosthetic group, as does Rr-CooA, and the heme in Ch-CooA is in a six-coordinate, low spin state in the Fe(III), Fe(II), and Fe(II)–CO forms. Although these properties are the same as those of Rr-CooA, the electronic absorption spectrum of the Fe(III) form and the redox potential of Ch-CooA were different from those of Rr-CooA. These differences are caused by a different coordination structure of the heme in Ch-CooA from that of Rr-CooA (8Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L.

Cys is conserved in Ch-CooA at position 80 that corresponds to the position of Cys-75 in Rr-CooA, and is predicted to be a fifth ligand of Fe(III) Ch-CooA. However, electronic absorption and resonance Raman studies of wild-type and C80A Ch-CooA reveal that Cys-80 is not coordinated to the Fe(III) heme in Ch-CooA. Instead, the mutation on His-82 in Ch-CooA results in the formation of an apo-form of Ch-CooA. The position of His-82 corresponds to that of His-77 in Rr-CooA, which is the axial ligand of the Fe(II) and Fe(II)–CO forms. Resonance Raman spectroscopy reveals that histidine is the proximal ligand of CO-bound Ch-CooA. These results indicate that His-82 is the fifth ligand of Fe(III), Fe(II), and Fe(II)–CO hemes in Ch-CooA. We examined the sixth ligand of Ch-CooA by comparing 1H NMR of Ch-CooA with that of Rr-CooA. Ch-CooA showed similar 1H NMR signals to Fe(II) Rr-CooA ΔN5 mutant, in which the first four amino acid residues were deleted from the N terminus in the upfield region (data not shown). In the case of Rr-CooA ΔN5, the N-terminal α-amino group is thought to be the sixth ligand of the Fe(III) and Fe(II) hemes (10Yamamoto K. Ishikawa H. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Nakajima H. Aono S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11473-11476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the N-terminal α-amino group will be the sixth ligand of the heme in Ch-CooA. Based on the results discussed above, we propose here a coordination structure of the heme in Ch-CooA, as shown in Fig. 7. The coordination structure of the heme is not fully conserved between Ch-CooA and Rr-CooA. His-82 is the fifth ligand of the Fe(III) heme in Ch-CooA, whereas Cys-75 as the fifth ligand is coordinated to the Fe(III) heme in Rr-CooA. The sixth ligand of the Fe(III) and Fe(II) hemes in Rr-CooA and Ch-CooA is the nitrogen atom of the N-terminal Pro and the N-terminal α-amino group, respectively (Fig. 7). Although the N-terminal amino acid residue is not conserved between Rr-CooA and Ch-CooA, it is conserved between them: the nitrogen atom of the main chain at the N terminus is coordinated to the Fe(III) and Fe(II) hemes. The coordination of the N terminus is therefore essential for CooA function. In the case of Rr-CooA, the replacement of Pro-2 by CO is a trigger for Rr-CooA to gain specific DNA-binding activity via conformational change. Rr-CooA mutants with a deletion of several amino acid residues from the N terminus retain the coordination of the N terminus to the heme and CO-dependent activity (9Nakajima H. Honma Y. Tawara T. Kato T. Park S-Y. Miyatake H. Shiro Y. Aono S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7055-7061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the release of the N terminus from the heme upon CO binding is a trigger of the activation of CooA by CO. Ch-CooA does not show redox-controlled ligand exchange as does Rr-CooA between Cys-75 and His-77, because the coordination of His-82 is retained among the Fe(III), Fe(II), and Fe(II)–CO forms. The physiological significance of this difference between Ch-CooA and Rr-CooA is discussed below. Ch-CooA shows elevated reduction and oxidation midpoint potentials of +150 and +230 mV (versus NHE), respectively, in contrast with those of Rr-CooA (oxidation potential, –260 mV (versus NHE); reduction potential, –320 mV (versus NHE) (9Nakajima H.

Although Rr-CooA shows very low oxidation and reduction potentials, the oxidation and reduction potentials of Ch-CooA were higher by ∼500 mV than those of Rr-CooA. The difference of the redox potential between Ch-CooA and Rr-CooA can be explained by the different coordination structure of the Fe(III) heme. In the case of Rr-CooA, both of the axial ligands of Fe(III) heme are negatively charged, i.e. Cys-75 and Pro-2 are deprotonated to coordinate to the heme (9Nakajima H. Honma Y. Tawara T. Kato T. Park S-Y. Miyatake H. Shiro Y. Aono S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7055-7061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 10Yamamoto K. Ishikawa H. Takahashi S. Ishimori K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 25757-25764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These negative charges stabilize the Fe(III) form to decrease the redox potential by an electron-push effect caused by the electron-donating capability of axial ligands. In contrast, the axial ligands of Fe(III) Ch-CooA are His-82 and the N-terminal α-amino group, both of which are electrically neutral. A neutral histidine and α-amino group have lower electron-donating capability than deprotonated cysteine and proline. Therefore, Ch-CooA shows more positive reduction and oxidation potentials than those of Rr-CooA. The large difference of the redox potential between Ch-CooA and Rr-CooA is related to the difference in phenotype of their original host strains (C. hydrogenoformans and R. rubrum). R. rubrum can grow aerobically and anaerobically. CooA activates the expression of coo operons only in the presence of CO under anaerobic conditions to gain the energy for growth on CO (1Aono S. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 825-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 2Aono S. Nakajima H. Prog. React. Kinet. Mech. 2000; 25: 65-107Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 3Aono S. Nakajima H. Coord.

Biol. 2001; 67: 35-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of O2, the CO metabolism pathway is shut off and the oxygen respiratory chain starts to work. Rr-CooA is deactivated under aerobic conditions to stop the expression of coo operons. Therefore, the redox potential of Rr-CooA is thought to be very low so that it can detect oxygen in the cell via autoxidation of the heme. Redox-controlled ligand exchange between Cys-75 and His-77 in Rr-CooA is responsible for tuning the redox potential of the heme suitable for oxygen detection. On the other hand, because C. hydrogenoformans is a strict anaerobic bacterium (14Svetlichny V.A. Sokolova T.G. Gerhardt M. Ringpfeil N.A. Kostrikina N.A. Navarzin G.A. System. Appl. Microbiol. 1991; 14: 254-260Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar), Ch-CooA is not required to detect the presence of oxygen in the cell and should sense only CO under anaerobic conditions. Therefore, the redox potential of Ch-CooA is +150 and +230 mV, and Ch-CooA is maintained to take the Fe(II) form ready to bind CO in the cell. In summary, we have characterized a CooA homologue from C. hydrogenoformans, Ch-CooA. The comparison of Ch-CooA and Rr-CooA properties elucidates what is essential for sensing CO by CooA protein. The essential factors for CooA function are (i) the heme is six-coordinate in the Fe(III), Fe(II), and Fe(II)–CO forms; (ii) the N terminus is coordinated to the heme as an axial ligand; and (iii) CO replaces the N terminus bound to the heme upon CO binding. Redox potentials of Ch-CooA are higher by ∼500 mV than those of Rr-CooA, whose difference is caused by the different axial ligands of the heme. The difference of redox potentials is concerned with a different phenotype of R. rubrum and C. hydrogenoformans, which are the original host strains of Rr-CooA and Ch-CooA, respectively. We thank Prof. Y. Yamamoto (Tsukuba University) for the measurement of NMR spectra of Ch-CooA. Preliminary sequence data was obtained from The Institute for Genomic Research website at www.tigr.org. The sequencing of C. hydrogenoformans was accomplished with support from the United States Department of Energy."

In contrast to CYP2C11 and other male-specific, plasma GH pulse-inducible liver genes, CYP2A2 is highly expressed in hypophysectomized rat liver, despite the absence of GH stimulation. CYP2A2 promoter fragments 0.9–6.2 kb long exhibited unusually high basal promoter activity when transfected into the liver cell line HepG2. A further ∼2.5-fold increase in activity was obtained by cotransfection of hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 3γ or HNF4α. CYP2A2 promoter activity was inhibited ∼85% by transfection of HNF3β or HNF6, both of which are more highly expressed in female than male liver and can strongly trans-activate the female-specific CYP2C12 promoter. The male GH pulse-activated transcription factor STAT5b had no effect on CYP2A2 promoter activity, either alone or in combination with HNF3γ and HNF4α, consistent with the GH pulse-independence of CYP2A2 expression. By contrast, STAT5b synergistically enhanced the transcriptional activity of HNF4α toward two other male-specific liver target genes, Cyp2d9 and CYP8B1. Furthermore, STAT5b in combination with the HNF4α coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α strongly enhanced the transcriptional activity of HNF4α toward CYP8B1 but not toward CYP2A2. These findings support the hypothesis that sex-dependent HNFs contribute to the sexually dimorphic expression of CYP2A2 and other liver CYPs and highlight the ability of STAT5b to act in concert with HNF4α to regulate select male-specific liver CYP genes.

Growth hormone (GH) 1The abbreviations used are: GH, growth hormone; CYP, cytochrome P450; HNF, hepatocyte nuclear factor; Luc, luciferase; nts, nucleotides; PGC-1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1; STAT5b, signal transducer and activator of transcription 5b. 1The abbreviations used are: GH, growth hormone; CYP, cytochrome P450; HNF, hepatocyte nuclear factor; Luc, luciferase; nts, nucleotides; PGC-1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1; STAT5b, signal transducer and activator of transcription 5b. is secreted by the pituitary gland in a highly pulsatile manner. In the adult male rat, regular plasma GH pulses of 200–300 ng/ml occur every ∼3.5 h, separated by periods during which GH is virtually absent from circulation. Pituitary GH release is more frequent in the adult female rat and results in a nearly continuous presence of GH in circulation at concentrations typically ranging from ∼15 to 40 ng/ml (1Jansson J.O. Eden S. Isaksson O. Endocr. Rev. 1985; 6: 128-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). These sexually dimorphic plasma GH profiles, in turn, dictate the sex-dependent effects that GH imparts to body growth rates at puberty and to the sex-dependent expression of several hepatic cytochromes P450 (CYPs) (2Waxman D.J. Chang T.K.H. Ortiz de Mantellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism and Biochemistry. 3rd Ed. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York2004: 347-376Google Scholar, 3Shapiro B.H. Agrawal A.K.

Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 747-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In the rat, sex-specific liver CYPs include the male-specific testosterone 16α- and 2α-hydroxylase CYP2C11, which is induced at puberty in male but not female rat liver, and the steroid sulfate 15β-hydroxylase CYP2C12, which is induced in female rat liver at a similar developmental stage. Notable sex differences have also been reported for mouse (5Noshiro M. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15923-15927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Sueyoshi T. Yokomori N.

Mode A. Wells T. Robinson I. Gustafsson J.A. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Continuous exposure to GH, mimicking the adult female plasma GH profile, induces the expression of female-specific CYPs, such as CYP2C12, and concomitantly inhibits the expression of male-specific CYPs, such as 2C11, 2A2, and 4A2 (10Pampori N.A. Shapiro B.H. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1245-1254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, intermittent plasma GH pulses, characteristic of adult male rats, stimulate the expression of CYP2C11 in male rat liver (11Waxman D.J. Pampori N.A. Ram P.A. Agrawal A.K. Shapiro B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6868-6872Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). CYP2C11 is a “class I” male-specific liver CYP gene, i.e. one whose high level expression requires repeated stimulation by male plasma GH pulses. CYPs 2A2, 3A2, and 4A2 belong to a second, distinct class of male-specific P450s. In contrast to the class I genes, expression of these class II CYPs remains at a high level in hypophysectomized male rat liver and is induced to nearly normal male levels after hypophysectomy of females. Thus, hepatic expression of class II male CYPs is independent of plasma GH pulses (12Agrawal A.K. Shapiro B.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 292: 228-237PubMed Google Scholar).STAT5b is a latent cytoplasmic transcription factor that is uniquely responsive to the male pulsatile GH pattern and is proposed to be a key mediator of the sexually dimorphic response of liver CYPs to GH stimulation (13Waxman D.J. Novartis Found. Symp. 2000; 227: 61-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of STAT5b in GH pulse-stimulated, sex-specific liver gene expression is consistent with the GH pulse-induced, intermittent high levels of active, nuclear STAT5b found in adult male but not female rat liver (14Waxman D.J.

Korach K.S. Negishi M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 473-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). STAT5b binding sites have been localized in the promoters of several male-specific genes, including rat CYP genes 2C11, 2A2, and 4A2 (21Park S.H. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43031-43039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), hamster CYP3A10 (22Subramanian A. Teixeira J. Wang J. Gil G. Mol. Cell.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8750-8755Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, STAT5b by itself is not sufficient to induce the adult male pattern of liver CYP expression, as demonstrated by the precocious activation of STAT5b, but not male CYPs, in prepubertal rats given periodic (pulsatile) injections of GH (15Choi H.K. Waxman D.J. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3245-3255Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).Analysis of CYP promoter sequences has revealed consensus binding sites for multiple hepatocyte-enriched nuclear factors (HNFs) (25Akiyama T.E. Gonzalez F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1619: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These liver transcription factors are characterized by structurally diverse DNA binding domains and include the variant homeodomain containing protein HNF1α, CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins, HNF3 winged helix factors, the orphan nuclear receptor HNF4α, and the one-cut homeoprotein HNF6 (26Gonzalez F.J. Lee Y.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1112-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The class I male-specific CYP2C11 promoter is strongly trans-activated by HNF1α and HNF3β (21Park S.H. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43031-43039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), whereas the female-specific CYP2C12 gene is in part regulated by HNF3β and HNF6 acting together in a highly synergistic manner (27Delesque-Touchard N.

Moreover, the nuclear receptor HNF4α plays a central role in regulating sex-dependent mouse liver Cyp gene expression in vivo, as demonstrated in an HNF4α-deficient mouse liver model (29Wiwi C.A. Gupte M. Waxman D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1975-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) (for review, see Ref. 30Wiwi C.A. Waxman D.J. Growth Factors. 2004; 22: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).Here we investigate the role of HNFs in regulating the CYP2A2 promoter. We demonstrate that CYP2A2 is responsive to multiple HNFs, with HNF4α and HNF3γ stimulating gene expression and HNF3β and HNF6 inhibiting gene expression. Furthermore, CYP2A2 is shown to be unresponsive to GH pulse-activated STAT5b, which we show can synergize with HNF4α to activate two other male-specific HNF4α-responsive promoters, CYP8B1 (31Zhang M. Chiang J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41690-41699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and Cyp2d9 (32Yokomori N. Kobayashi R. Moore R. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5355-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), but not CYP2A2. These findings are discussed in the context of a model whereby STAT5b cooperates with HNF4α to regulate select sex-specific liver CYP genes.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodies—Rabbit polyclonal anti-STAT5b antibody, raised against STAT5b residues 776–786, was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse polyclonal anti-V5 antibody, which detects a 14-amino acid epitope derived from the P and V proteins of the paramyxovirus SV5, was purchased from Invitrogen. Rabbit polyclonal anti-STAT5b-pY694 which is cross-reactive with STAT5b-Y694, was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA).Expression and Reporter Plasmids—Expression plasmids for mouse STAT5b (Dr. A. Mui, DNAX Corp., Palo Alto, CA), rat GH receptor (Dr. N. Billestrup, Hagedorn Research Institute, Gentofe, Denmark), mouse STAT5b-Y699F (Dr. H. Rui, Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Georgetown University, Washington, D. C.), and human peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) (Dr. B. Spiegelman, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA) were obtained from the indicated individuals. HNF factors were subcloned into pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen) as follows. Expression plasmids for rat HNF1α (Dr. F. Gonzalez, NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda MD), rat HNF3β (Dr. E. Lai, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York), mouse HNF3γ (Dr. K. H. Kaestner, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia), rat HNF4α (Dr. F. Sladek, University of California, Riverside), and rat HNF6 (Drs. F. Lemaigre and G. Rousseau, University of Louvain Medical School, Brussels, Belgium) were obtained from the indicated individuals. PCR was carried out in a Stratagene RoboCycler (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for 30 cycles consisting of 94 °C for 1 min, 48 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) to generate blunt end PCR products. PCRs used HNF plasmids as template and the following PCR primers: HNF1α sense, 5′-CAC CCA CAG GGC TTG ACT AGT GGG ATT T-3′; HNF1α antisense, 5′-CTG GGA GGA GGA GGC CAT CTG GG-3′; HNF3β sense, 5′-CAC CAG TAT GCT GGG AGC CGT GAA G-3′; HNF3β antisense, 5′-GGA CGA GTT CAT AAT AGG CCT-3′; HNF3γ sense, 5′-CAC CAT GCT GGG CTC AGT GAA GAT GG-3′; HNF3γ antisense, 5′-GGA TGC ATT GAG CAG AGA GCG-3′; HNF4α sense, 5′-CAC CGC CGA CAT GGA CAT GGC TGA C-3′; HNF4α antisense, 5′-GAT GGC TTC CTG CTT GGT GAT CG-3′; HNF6 sense, 5′-CAC CAG CCC GCT CAC CCG CAT C-3′; and HNF6 antisense, 5′-TGC TTT GGT ACA AGT GCT TG-3′. The 4-nt sequence CACC was incorporated at the 5′-end of all sense PCR primers (see above) to facilitate the Directional TOPO cloning reaction. Resultant PCR products were subcloned into pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO using the pcDNA3.1 Directional TOPO Expression Kit (Invitrogen). In short, blunt end PCR products for each cDNA of interest (4 μl of fresh PCR product) were incubated for 5 min at 27 °C together with 1 μl of pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO vector and 1 μl of salt solution (1.2 m NaCl, 0.06 m MgCl2). The total Directional TOPO reaction was then transformed using One Shot TOP10 Escherichia coli (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Correct pcDNA3.1-HNF-V5-His expression plasmid construction was confirmed by DNA sequencing, and protein size was verified by anti-V5 Western blot.The STAT5 ntcp luciferase reporter plasmid 4x-pT109-Luc, containing four copies of a naturally occurring STAT5 response element, was obtained from Dr. M. Vore (University of Kentucky, Lexington). The HNF4α-activated luciferase reporter plasmids Cyp2d9-Luc (32Yokomori N. Kobayashi R. Moore R. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5355-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), containing 112 nts of the natural promoter of the mouse Cyp2d9 gene (Dr. M. Negishi, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, NC), and CYP8B1-Luc (31Zhang M. Chiang J.Y. J. Biol.

Chiang, Northeastern Ohio University College of Medicine, Rootstown, OH), were obtained from the indicated individuals. Promoter-luciferase reporter constructs for CYP2C11 (–1800/CYP2C11-Luc) (21Park S.H. Waxman D.J. J. Biol.

Nomoto M. Kozak C.A. Gonzalez F.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1329-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. F. J. Gonzalez (NCI, National Institutes of Health) and used to construct the CYP2A2 promoter-luciferase reporter plasmids –6232/2A2-Luc, –2311/2A2-Luc, and –933/2A2-Luc, as follows. Plasmid –933/2A2-Luc was constructed by subcloning a 955-bp DNA fragment corresponding to nts –933 to +22 of the rat CYP2A2 gene (nucleotide numbering relative to the 2A2 transcriptional start site) (accession number M33313; GenBank/EBI Data Bank). The fragment was amplified by PCR using cloned pUC19/2A2 as the template and synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to nts –933 to –910 (upstream primer containing a 5′-end BglII restriction site) and +22 to +5 (downstream primer containing a 5′-end HindIII restriction site). Likewise, –2311/2A2-Luc was constructed by generating a 2333-bp DNA fragment spanning nts –2311 to +22 using oligonucleotides corresponding to nt –2311 to –2292 (upstream primer containing a 5′-end MluI restriction site) and +22 to +5 (downstream primer containing a 5′-end XhoI restriction site). PCRs were carried out at 94 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min for 30 cycles in a Stratagene RoboCycler. The resultant DNA fragments were double digested with BglII and HindIII (–933/2A2-Luc) or MluI and XhoI (–2311/2A2-Luc) and ligated into a similarly digested pGL3-Basic (Promega) cloning vector, which encodes a modified firefly luciferase reporter. –6232/2A2-Luc was constructed by directly ligating into –933/2A2-Luc a 5.5-kb fragment excised from pUC19/2A2 by digestion with SalI and EcoRV. All three CYP2A2 promoter-luciferase reporter constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. DNA sequencing revealed that the cloned –6232/2A2 promoter fragment contained 623 bp of previously unsequenced DNA at the 5′-end (33Matsunaga T. Nomoto M. Kozak C.A. Gonzalez F.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1329-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Reporter plasmids –2458/4A2-Luc and –1944/4A2-Luc were constructed as follows. The cloned genomic DNA fragment p246/4A2, obtained from Dr. F. J. Gonzalez (NCI, National Institutes of Health) (34Kimura S. Hanioka N. Matsunaga E. Gonzalez F.J. DNA (N. Y.). 1989; 8: 503-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), was used as a template in PCRs to generate CYP4A2 promoter fragments. Upstream primers corresponding to CYP4A2 nts –2458 to –2437 and nts –1944 to –1920 (containing 5′-end MluI restriction sites) (accession number M57719; GenBank/EBI Data Bank) were, respectively, paired with a common downstream primer corresponding to CYP4A2 nts +28 to +6 (containing a 5′-end XhoI restriction site). These PCRs generated a 2486-bp PCR product, corresponding to nts –2458 to +28, and a 1972-bp fragment, corresponding to nts –1944 to +28 of the rat CYP4A2 gene. The resultant DNA fragments were double digested with MluI and XhoI and ligated into MluI/XhoI-digested pGL3-Basic, generating reporter plasmids –2458/4A2-Luc and –1944/4A2-Luc. Correct CYP4A2 promoter-firefly luciferase reporter plasmid construction was confirmed by DNA sequencing.Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—HepG2 human hepatoma and COS-1 African green monkey kidney cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. For transient transfections, HepG2 cells were seeded at a density of 1.8 × 105 cells/well (in 24-well plates) or 8 × 104 cells/well (in 48-well plates). COS-1 cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 104 cells/well in 48-well plates. Cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). FuGENE 6-DNA complexes were prepared as described in the manufacturer's protocol at a ratio of 1.3:1 (FuGENE 6:DNA, v/w). Typically, each well of a 48-well tissue culture plate received a total of 350 ng of DNA, including 20–50 ng of firefly luciferase reporter plasmid: 20 ng of CYP2A2 promoter-Luc, 20 ng of CYP4A2 promoter-Luc, 50 ng 4x-pT109-Luc, 50 ng of Cyp2d9-Luc or 50 ng CYP8B1-Luc. Where indicated, transfections also contained the following expression plasmids: 25 ng of rat GH receptor, 100 ng of STAT5b or STAT5b-Y699F, 40 ng of PGC-1α, and 100 ng HNF expression plasmid. In all cases, 25 ng of pRL-tk-Luc (Renilla luciferase) reporter plasmid was included as an internal control for transfection efficiency. 24 h after the addition of the FuGENE 6-DNA complex, cells were stimulated for 18 h with 200 ng/ml GH in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum or were left untreated. Cell lysates were then prepared using 80 μl of 1% SDS gel sample buffer (0.07 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 10.6% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and a trace of pyronin Y)/well of a 48-well plate. Samples were boiled for 10 min, and 20 μl was loaded directly onto a 7.5% Laemmli SDS gel for Western blot analysis. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities of samples lysed in 100 μl of 1 × lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI)/well of a 48-well plate were determined using a dual reporter assay system (Promega) and a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego). Firefly luciferase activity values were divided by Renilla luciferase activity values to obtain normalized luciferase activities (mean ± S.D. values for n = 3 independent transfections). Relative luciferase activities were then calculated to facilitate comparisons between samples within a given experiment.Western Blotting—HepG2 cell extract (30 μg of protein/sample) was electrophoresed for 5 h through 7.5% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and transferred overnight onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at 37 °C in blocking solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 5% nonfat dry milk and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-V5 antibody (diluted 1:5,000 in blocking solution) or with anti-STAT5b-pY694 antibody (1:1,000 dilution). Antibody binding was visualized on x-ray film by enhanced chemiluminescence using the ECL kit from Amersham Biosciences. Nitrocellulose membranes were reprobed, as indicated, after incubation in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2% SDS, 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) for 20 min at 50 °C. Membranes were then blocked for 1 h at 37 °C in blocking solution containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 2% nonfat dry milk followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with anti-STAT5b antibody (diluted 1:2,000 in blocking solution). X-ray films were scanned using a Microtech Scanmaker V6USL scanner (Hauppauge, NY) and ScanWizard version 5.12 scanning software (Microteck, Inc.).Promoter Analysis and Identification of HNF and STAT5 Binding Sites—The Web-based program PromoSer (biowulf.bu.edu/zlab/promoser) (35Halees A.S.

GenBank accession numbers, used by PromoSer to identify the genes of interest, are shown in Table I (see “Results”). The promoter sequences retrieved were evaluated for correct genomic location and orientation using the NCBI Blast program. Proximal promoters were then analyzed using the Web-based program Cluster Buster (zlab.bu.edu/cluster-buster) (36Frith M.C. Li M.C. Weng Z.

HNF3, HNF4, HNF6, and STAT5b binding sites present within these clusters which have a DNA binding motif score threshold of 4.0 are reported in Table I.Table IHNF and STAT5b binding sites localized within clustered DNA binding motif regions in the 5′-flank of CYP2A2, CYP4A2, and CYP8B1a This sequence corresponds to the core STAT5b sequence previously described as nts -1872 to -1864 (21Park S.H. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43031-43039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).RESULTSHigh Basal Activity of CYP2A2 Promoter—The transcriptional regulation of the class II male CYP2A2 and CYP4A2 promoters was investigated in cells transfected with luciferase reporter plasmids containing up to 6,232 nts of CYP2A2 or 2,458 nts of CYP4A2 5′-flanking DNA. These CYP promoter constructs were transfected individually into HepG2 cells, a liver-derived cell line, or into COS-1 cells, which are kidney-derived. The CYP2A2 promoter constructs displayed unusually high basal expression in both cell lines (Fig. 1), with activity significantly higher in HepG2 cells (left panels) than COS-1 cells (right panels). The basal activity of –6232/2A2-Luc was substantially lower than that of –2311/2A2-Luc or –933/2A2-Luc (Fig. 1B), suggesting the presence of an upstream negative regulatory element between –2311 and –6232. The –2548/4A2-Luc and –1944/4A2-Luc promoter constructs both exhibited very low basal expression in HepG2 cells (activity ≤2-fold higher than that of the empty pGL3-Basic control plasmid), similar to the male-specific –1800/CYP2C11 and female-specific –1632/CYP2C12 promoters (Fig. 1A).Fig. 1CYP promoter activity in transfected HepG2 and COS-1 cells. A and B, HepG2 (left panels) and COS-1 cells (right panels) were transfected with 20 ng each of the indicated 5′-deleted CYP promoter-Luc reporter constructs. Normalized firefly luciferase activities were determined (mean ± S.D., n = 3 separate transfections) and are shown as -fold activation relative to the activity of the empty pGL3-Basic-Luc plasmid transfected in parallel (first bar in each data set). Relative CYP2A2 promoter activities were ∼7–8-fold higher in HepG2 compared with COS-1 cells (cf. y axis values). Fold activation values are shown above each bar in panel A. Transfections were carried out using equal amounts of DNA for each CYP promoter plasmid.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Liver Transcription Factors HNF4α and HNF3γ Stimulate CYP2A2 Promoter Activity—Next, we investigated the effects of eight individual HNFs on the promoter activities of CYP2A2 and CYP4A2 in HepG2 cotransfection studies. Of the eight HNFs tested (HNF1α, HNF3α, HNF3β, HNF3γ, HNF4α, HNF6, and CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins α and β), only HNF4α and HNF3γ stimulated CYP2A2 promoter activity, by ∼2.5-fold each (Fig. 2A). Cotransfection of HNF4α and HNF3γ generally resulted in a small further increase in activity under conditions where both HNFs were expressed at similar protein levels (Fig. 2A). None of the HNFs stimulated CYP2A2 promoter activity in COS-1 cells when transfected individually (Fig. 2B and data not shown), suggesting a requirement for a liver cell factor that is present in HepG2 cells but absent in COS-1 cells. Indeed, CYP2A2 promoter activity was stimulated, by ∼3-fold, in COS-1 cells after cotransfection of HNF4α and HNF3γ (Fig. 2B). In contrast to CYP2A2, CYP4A2 promoter constructs up to 2.5 kb in length were unresponsive to transfection of any of the HNFs in either cell line (data not shown).Fig. 2Liver transcription factors HNF4α and HNF3γ stimulate CYP2A2 promoter activity.

We show here that, for synthetic peptides corresponding to sequences of CFTR TM6 segments, circular dichroism spectra of wild type and R347P TM6 in membrane mimetic environments are virtually identical, but L346P loses ∼50% helicity, implying a membrane insertion defect in the latter mutant. A similar defect was observed in the corresponding double-spanning (“hairpin”) TM5/6-L346P synthetic peptide. Examination of the biogenesis of CFTR revealed that the full-length protein harboring the L346P mutation is rapidly degraded at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whereas the wild type and the R347P protein process normally. Furthermore, a second site mutation (R347I) that restores in vitro membrane insertion and folding of the TM5/6-L346P peptide also rescues the folding and cell surface chloride channel function of full-length L346P CFTR. The correlated in vitro/in vivo results demonstrate that destabilizing local hydrophobic character represents a sufficient signal for marking CFTR as a non-native protein by the ER quality control, with accompanying deleterious consequences to global protein folding events.

Polytopic membrane proteins may be particularly susceptible to folding defects when non-native residues of high hydrophilicity are introduced into transmembrane positions (1Zhou F.X. Cocco M.J. Russ W. Brunger A.T. Engelman D.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). These phenomena are epitomized by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) 1The abbreviations used are: CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; BHK, baby hamster kidney; CD, circular dichroism; CF, cystic fibrosis; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; LPC, 1-myristoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; TM, transmembrane; Tris, tris(hydroxymethy)aminomethane; WT, wild type; HA, hemagglutinin; Ab, antibody., a chloride channel protein that becomes dysfunctional in cystic fibrosis, the most common lethal autosomal recessive genetic disease in the Caucasian population (2Ramsey B.W.

Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 401: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Established as the CF gene product (4Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J.

The two halves are linked by a cytoplasmic regulatory R-domain. Deletion of Phe-508 (ΔF508) in NBD1, the most common mutation among CF patients (67% among all the CF patients) (6Sheppard D.N.

However, of the more than 1000 CF-phenotypic mutations in CFTR that have now been reported, over 100 occur in membrane-spanning regions. Critical components of the channel pore have been identified in CFTR TM helices 5 and 6 (TM5/6, residues 308–350). TM6 has been shown to have a role in the determination of the permeation properties of CFTR (7Gong X. Burbridge S.M. Cowley E.A. Linsdell P. J. Physiol. 2002; 540: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar); several residues in TM6 have been proposed to contribute to the anion binding sites, including Arg-334, Lys-335, Phe-337, Thr-338, Ser-341, Arg-347, and Arg-352, whereas the central region of TM6 has been localized as a main determinant of both anion binding and anion selectivity in CFTR (6Sheppard D.N.

Evol. 2001; 18: 1771-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A number of mutations occurring in TM5/6 have been found to cause mild (usually pancreatic sufficient) forms of CF, two of which involve introduction of a proline residue: L346P, a mutation that was identified in two unrelated Cypriot patients in 1994 (10Boteva K. Papageorgiou E. Georgiou C. Angastiniotis M. Middleton L.T. Constantinou-Deltas C.D. Hum. Genet. 1994; 93: 529-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar); and a second sequentially adjacent CF-phenotypic mutant, R347P (11Tector M. Hartl F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6290-6298Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that Arg-347 in TM6 forms a salt bridge with an aspartate (Asp-979) located in TM9 (12Smith S.S. Liu X. Zhang Z.R. Sun F. Kriewall T.E. McCarty N.A. Dawson D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 407-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), an interaction that would be abrogated by the loss of the native TM6 Arg residue. Arg-347 has also been proposed to contribute to the pore of the CFTR Cl- channel and anion conduction (8Anderson M.P. Gregory R.J. Thompson S. Souza D.W. Paul S. Mulligan R.C. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Science. 1991; 253: 202-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar), and the pore properties of the channel have been observed to be altered in various Arg-347 mutants (6Sheppard D.N. Rich D.P. Ostedgaard L.S. Gregory R.J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1993; 362: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 8Anderson M.P. Gregory R.J. Thompson S. Souza D.W. Paul S. Mulligan R.C. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Science. 1991; 253: 202-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Pro residues have typically been implicated in channel gating when they occur in poreforming helices (13von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 14Woolfson D.N. Williams D.H. FEBS Lett. 1990; 277: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Gain of Pro in a TM helix can have several consequences. The Pro pyrolidine ring is bulky, which causes steric constraints on the conformation of the preceding residue in the helix (15Hurley J.H. Mason D.A. Matthews B.W. Biopolymers. 1992; 32: 1443-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). As well, Pro residues may introduce a kink in the helix structure (16Williams K.A. Deber C.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8919-8923Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 17Yohannan S. Yang D. Faham S. Boulting G. Whitelegge J. Bowie J.U. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). And, as an imino acid, Pro lacks an amide proton on the X-Pro bond for participation in helix-stabilizing intramolecular H-bonds (18Deber C.M. Therien A.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 318-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As such, the introduction of Pro into a TM helix increases the net hydrophilicity of the segment, because it results in a non-H-bonded backbone carbonyl group in the preceding turn of the helix. Furthermore, in CFTR mutant L346P, the loss of Leu significantly increases the local hydrophilicity of this TM segment, i.e. on the Liu-Deber hydropathy index where values are scaled between +5 and -5, Leu ranks third (+4.76), whereas Pro ranks 19th (-4.92) out of the 20 commonly occurring amino acids (19Liu L-P. Deber C.M. Biopolymers (Peptide Sci.). 1998; 47: 41-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the case of R347P, the Arg positive charge is lost, but this mutation exchanges a polar residue (Arg ranks 14th, at -2.77) with one of comparable hydrophilicity. In the present work, we have used solid-phase peptide synthesis to prepare sequences corresponding to TM6 segments of wild type (WT) and mutants L346P and R347P of CFTR, along with some corresponding double-spanning TM5/6 peptides for comparative structural analyses. In parallel, we examined the relative effects of L346P versus R347P on cellular processing of full-length CFTR. The results provide striking in vivo/in vitro correlates of the consequences of a missense mutation located in the predicted TM6 segment and demonstrate that destabilizing local hydrophobic character may represent a sufficient signal for recognizing CFTR as a non-native protein by the ER quality control. Peptide Synthesis and Purification—Peptides were synthesized using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry on a PerSeptive Biosystems Pioneer peptide synthesizer (20Melnyk R.A. Partridge A.W. Deber C.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11106-11113Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Synthesis employed the use of the Pioneer's extended cycle for TM5/6 peptides or single-spanning TM6 peptides. In a typical synthesis, 0.22 mmol/g PAL-PEG-PS resin (Applied Biosystems) was used to produce amidated C terminus. The peptides were then cleaved with a mixture of 88% trifluoroacetic acid/5% phenol/5% ultrapure water/2% triisopropylsilane. The cleaved peptides were precipitated with ice-cold diethyl ether. Centrifuged pellets were redissolved in 5% acetonitrile and lyophilized. The crude peptide powder was dissolved in 30% acetonitrile, and 10 mg of the crude peptide was loaded onto a C4 preparative reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography column and then eluted with a water/acetonitrile gradient (30–75% acetonitrile over 60 min). The major peak was collected and lyophilized. Mass spectrometry was used to confirm the molecular weight of the purified peptide. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—CD spectra were collected using a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter. Lyophilized peptide was added to a buffer containing 50 mm LPC and 25 mm Tris at pH 8.0, and the mixture was vortexed to ensure complete peptide solubilization. Samples were measured at peptide concentrations between 25 and 50 μm. Measurements were taken using a quartz cuvette with a path length of 0.1 mm at room temperature. Spectral scans were performed from 250 to 190 nm with a step resolution of 0.4 nm, a speed of 20 nm/min, and a bandwidth of 1.0 nm. Spectra are reported as the average of three scans. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer Analysis—FRET measurements were performed using peptides labeled with dansyl chloride as the acceptor fluorophore at the N terminus, with the Trp residue in TM6 (C terminus) serving as the donor fluorophore. Dansyl chloride labeling was carried out at room temperature by mixing 2 mg of dansyl chloride with 100 mg of dry peptide resin (before cleavage) in 7% N,N-diisopropylethylamine/93% dimethylformamide solution (v/v) overnight. Emission spectra were measured at room temperature in an LPS-220B fluorescence spectrometer. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm, with a step size of 1 s, and an integration time of 0.5 s. Spectra are reported as the average of three separate measurements. Construction and Expression of CFTR Variants in Mammalian Cells—The L346P, R347P, and R347H CFTR mutants were constructed by overlapping PCR using the appropriate mutagenic primers. The PCR products were subcloned into the BspEI/Bst1107I sites of CFTR. Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells were stably transfected with the pNUT expression plasmids, containing the wild type (WT), L346P, or R347P CFTR, harboring an HA-epitope in the C-terminal tail of CFTR (CFTR-CintHA) (21Benharouga M. Sharma M. So J. Haardt M. Drzymala L. Popov M. Schwapach B. Grinstein S. Du K. Lukacs G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22079-22089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Following clonal selection in the presence of methotrexate (500 μm), 50–100 individual colonies were pooled and expanded for experiments. Transient expression of COS-1 cells was carried out as described previously (22Haardt M. Benharouga M. Lechardeur D. Kartner N. Lukacs G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21873-21877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting and Metabolic Pulse-chase Studies—CFTR immunoblotting was performed with the mouse monoclonal anti-HA Ab (Covance) using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection, and immunoblots were quantified with densitometry, as described previously (23Sharma M. Benharouga M. Hu W. Lukacs G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8942-8950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The Na+/K+-ATPase was visualized by the a6F Ab (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa). The stability of CFTR variants was monitored by the pulse-chase technique. First, the cellular methionine and cysteine content was depleted in Met- and Cys-free medium (37 °C, 30 min) and then pulse-labeled for 15 min in the presence of 0.1 mCi of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (Amersham Biosciences) at 37 °C. Following the indicated chase period in complete medium, membrane proteins were solubilized in 1 ml radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, pH 8.0) supplemented with protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm iodoacetamide). Immunoprecipitates, obtained with anti-HA Ab, were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. The radioactivity incorporated into CFTR was quantified using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) with the Image-QuaNT software (Molecular Dynamics) as described (24Lukacs G.L. Mohamed A. Kartner N. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6076-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Iodide Efflux Assay—The plasma membrane cAMP-dependent halide conductance of stably transfected BHK cells was determined by the iodide efflux assay (25Mohamed A. Ferguson D. Seibert F.S. Cai H.M. Kartner N. Grinstein S. Riordan J.R. Lukacs G.L. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Iodide efflux was initiated by replacing the loading buffer with efflux medium (composed of 136 mm nitrate in place of iodide). The extracellular medium was replaced every minute with efflux medium (1 ml). After a steady state was reached, the intracellular cAMP level was raised by agonists (10 μm forskolin, 0.2 mm CPT-cAMP, and 0.2 mm isobutylmethyl xanthane) to achieve maximal phosphorylation of CFTR. The collection of the efflux medium was resumed for an additional 6–9 min. The amount of iodide in each sample was determined with an iodide selective electrode (Orion). Hydrophobicity Threshold of CF-phenotypic Mutant TM Segments—Although both L346P and R347P represent a gain of a Pro residue in CFTR TM6, the resulting local 346/347 diads (PR and LP, respectively) differ significantly in hydrophobic character. This situation is highlighted using TM Finder, a web-based program that reliably predicts whether a stretch of amino acids has sufficient hydrophobicity to exist as a stably inserted transmembrane helix (26Deber C.M. Wang C. Liu L.P. Prior A.S. Agrawal S. Muskat B.L. Cuticchia A.J. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The outputs for the wild type (WT) and L346P CFTR sequences support an initial hypothesis that the L346P mutation decreases the average net hydrophobicity of the original TM6 segment sufficiently to prevent the proper membrane insertion of the full TM6 segment (Fig. 1, A and B). Specifically, the program identifies a 20-amino acid stretch (residues 330–349) in the WT CFTR sequence that likely corresponds to the membrane-embedded residues of TM6. In contrast, the output for the L346P mutant sequence (residues 330–341) fails to predict a sufficiently long stretch of amino acids that are above the threshold hydrophobicity required for a TM helix (27Liu L-P. Deber C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23645-23648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 28Liu L-P. Deber C.M. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1999; 7: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, unlike L346P, the R347P mutation doesn't involve a significant change in hydrophobicity, and TM Finder predicts that the R347P mutant has the same membrane-inserted amino acid stretch (residues 330–349) as the WT TM6 sequence (Fig. 1C). It may be noted that programs such as TM Finder may underpredict the actual total of membrane-inserted residues in a given TM segment, because interfacial residues at both termini of the segment tend to be rich in hydrophilic residues, such as Lys and Arg, which strongly drive the local average hydropathy down (26Deber C.M. Wang C. Liu L.P. Prior A.S. Agrawal S. Muskat B.L. Cuticchia A.J. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Synthesis and Circular Dichroism Spectra of CFTR TM6 Peptides—To experimentally test the TM-Finder prediction, we synthesized Lys-tagged versions of the TM6-WT and the two mutant (L346P and R347P) sequences (Table I). The Lys-tagged methodology involves adding several Lys residues (in the present case, three Lys) to both the N and C termini, a strategy that greatly facilitates peptide purification and characterization while maintaining the native-like structural properties of the TM segment they flank (20Melnyk R.A. Partridge A.W. Deber C.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11106-11113Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The circular dichroism (CD) spectra of these two peptides are shown in Fig. 2A. Although the TM6-WT peptide adopted an α-helical structure in the presence of LPC micelles, the TM6-L346P peptide displays only ∼50% of the helicity observed for the TM6-WT sequence. In contrast, the CD spectra of TM6-R347P and the TM6-WT peptides are virtually superimposable.Table ISequences of CFTR TM6 and TM5/6 peptides prepared in this work TM6 peptides contain residues 330–354 of the CFTR sequence; TM5/6 peptides correspond to residues 300–354 of the CFTR sequence; those designated (W) extend to residue 356.

As “helical hairpins” when folded, these constructs constitute the minimal tertiary contact systems representative of the CFTR TM domain (29Therien A.G. Grant F.E. Deber C.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). CD spectra indicate that the TM5/6-L346P construct exhibits a 25% decrease in helicity when compared with the TM5/6-WT construct in SDS micelles, consistent with a 50% decrease in one TM helix (Fig. 2B). Fluorescence Studies of CFTR Single TM6 and Double TM5/6 Peptides—The proposition that the L346P TM segment is only partially inserted into micellar membranes was further examined by fluorescence experiments. To this end, we synthesized two additional peptides containing a TM-embedded fluorescent probe introduced through the conservative F342W mutation (TM6-WT(F342W) and TM6-L346P(F342W), respectively) (Table I). Characteristic Trp fluorescence spectra of these two peptides in detergent micelles are presented in Fig. 2C. Noting that a membrane-embedded Trp residue will typically display increased fluorescence intensity with a blue-shifted position versus an aqueous-located counterpart, the data indicate that the Trp residue in the WT species resides in an apolar environment (maximum near 320 nm) whereas the Trp in the L346P peptide is largely aqueous exposed (shoulder near 340 nm), supporting the notion that the apolar-to-polar mutation prevents proper TM6 insertion. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), the transfer of the excited-state energy from the initially excited donor to an acceptor, can provide further information as to the proximity of donor and acceptor chromophores (30Adair B.D. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5539-5544Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The donor-acceptor distance can be determined from the efficiency of energy transfer, which can be derived from steady-state measurements of the extent of donor quenching due to the acceptor. We exploited this phenomenon to detect differences in the distance between the N and C termini in TM5/6 peptides. To perform this analysis, we modified the sequences of the peptides through insertion of a Trp residue (donor moiety) near the peptide C terminus (Table I) and subsequently labeled the WT and mutant peptides with a dansyl (acceptor moiety, N-terminal) group. The FRET spectra obtained indicate a significant decrease in the donor quench in case of mutant TM5/6-L346P(W) peptide as compared with its WT counterpart (Fig. 2D). Note that the diagram depicts the quench in donor (Trp) intensity near 338 nm; a corresponding increase is observed in dansyl fluorescence intensity near 550 nm (not shown). The FRET results suggest that (i) the WT sequence is likely folded into a helical hairpin and (ii) a substantial increase in fluorophore separation occurs between the N and C termini of the L346P mutant hairpin compared with the WT sequence. The L346P Mutation Impairs the Folding of CFTR in Vivo— ER-retained, core-glycosylated (or incompletely folded) CFTR can be readily distinguished from the mature, complex-glycosylated (or folded) CFTR by immunoblot analysis, based on the faster electrophoretic mobility of the core-glycosylated form compared with the complex-glycosylated CFTR. Because impaired post-translational folding of the CFTR usually causes its biosynthetic processing arrest, we examined the processing of full-length L346P- and R347P-CFTR by immunoblotting and pulse-chase analysis of BHK cells, which stably express CFTR. To facilitate the detection of CFTR, an HA-epitope tag was inserted at the C terminus of the channel (CFTR-CintHA) (21Benharouga M. Sharma M. So J. Haardt M. Drzymala L. Popov M. Schwapach B. Grinstein S. Du K. Lukacs G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22079-22089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, immunoblot analysis of equal amounts of cell extracts demonstrated that the L346P, but not the R347P, mutation, prevented the expression of the complex-glycosylated CFTR. The R347H missense mutation, associated with a mild functional defect of CFTR channel activity, was also expressed at the same level as the WT CFTR, confirming previous reports (31Clain J. Fritsch J. Lehmann-Che J. Bali M. Arous N. Goossens M. Edelman A. Fanen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9045-9049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained in transiently transfected COS-1 cells, indicating that the cellular phenotype of the L346P CFTR is independent of the expression system used (Fig. 3B). Impaired steady-state expression of L346P-CFTR could be a consequence of its rapid degradation at the ER and/or of accelerated removal of the channel from post-Golgi compartments (32Sharma M. Pampinella F. Nemes C. Benharouga M. So J. Du K. Bache K.G. Papsin B. Zerangue N. Stenmark H. Lukacs G.L. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). To distinguish between these scenarios, the biogenesis of L346P CFTR was monitored in BHK cells by the metabolic pulse-chase technique. Although the accumulation of the complex-glycosylated WT-CFTR was obvious after 2 h of chase, the L346P mutation prevented the appearance of the complex-glycosylated form as shown by autoradiography (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that the L346P mutation imposes a folding defect on CFTR, leading to the retention and degradation of the mutant at the ER. On the other hand, the L346P mutation does not appear to cause premature translational termination or failure of the TM5–6 or TM7–8 segments to insert into the ER, because similar amounts of radioactively labeled core-glycosylated WT and L346P CFTR were accumulated during a 10-min radioactive labeling (Fig. 3D). A Second Site Mutation in TM6 Restores Biosynthetic Processing of CFTR—To test the assumption that destabilization of local TM5/6 hairpin formation may inhibit post-translational folding in the context of full-length CFTR, we searched for a second site mutation that could re-establish the stability of the L346P TM5/6. Consideration of amino acid replacements in the vicinity of the L346P mutation identified a second site mutation (R347I) that restored the hydrophobicity of the TM6 L346P-containing segment to the threshold level that ensured membrane insertion according to TM Finder (Fig. 1D) (26Deber C.M. Wang C. Liu L.P. Prior A.S. Agrawal S. Muskat B.L. Cuticchia A.J. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The L346P/R347I single spanning TM6 peptide was first synthesized, and analysis of its CD spectrum confirmed that this mutation restored the α-helical content of this TM6 double mutant to its WT counterpart (Fig. 4A). We then assessed whether the R347I mutation could restore hairpin formation of the TM5/6-L346P polypeptide by the FRET assay. Using a TM5/6-L346P/R347I peptide in which a Trp residue was inserted near the C terminus (Table I), and in which the N terminus was labeled with a dansyl group, we found that the donor fluorescence quench in the double mutant was now similar to that of the WT TM5/6 (Fig. 4B). If destabilization of the TM5/6 hairpin accounts for the processing defect of the L346P CFTR, introducing the second site mutation should correspondingly restore the folding"
