https://openalex.org/W2140732424,"Mice devoid of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an intermediate filament protein specifically expressed in astrocytes, develop normally and do not show any detectable abnormalities in the anatomy of the brain. In the cerebellum, excitatory synaptic transmission from parallel fibers (PFs) or climbing fibers (CFs) to Purkinje cells is unaltered, and these synapses display normal short-term synaptic plasticity to paired stimuli in GFAP mutant mice. In contrast, long-term depression (LTD) at PFâ€“Purkinje cell synapses is clearly deficient. Furthermore, GFAP mutant mice exhibited a significant impairment of eyeblink conditioning without any detectable deficits in motor coordination tasks. These results suggest that GFAP is required for communications between Bergmann glia and Purkinje cells during LTD induction and maintenance. The data support the notion that cerebellar LTD is a cellular mechanism closely associated with eyeblink conditioning, but is not essential for motor coordination tasks tested."

https://openalex.org/W2034137241,"Gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) switches from enhancing to repressing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA synthesis during the maturation of hippocampal neurons in vitro. Interneurons do not produce BDNF themselves, but BDNF enhances their differentiation. Therefore, the question arose whether hippocampal interneurons regulate their phenotype by regulating BDNF expression and release from adjacent cells. The GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol and BDNF increased the size and neuropeptide Y (NPY) immunoreactivity of hippocampal interneurons. However, GABAergic stimulation failed to increase NPY immunoreactivity in cultures from BDNF knockout embryos. At later developmental stages, when GABA represses BDNF synthesis, treatment with muscimol induced a decrease in cell size and NPY immunoreactivity of interneurons. Interneurons might thus control their phenotype through the regulation of BDNF synthesis in, and release from, their target neurons."

https://openalex.org/W2152190286,"The commissureless (comm) gene was identified previously in a large-scale screen for mutations that disrupt CNS axon pathways in Drosophila. The comm gene has a unique mutant phenotype: the complete absence of most axon commissures, while midline cells and other aspects of CNS fate and patterning are left unchanged. Here, we report on the molecular cloning, characterization, and expression of the comm gene. comm encodes a novel protein of 370 amino acids that lacks a signal sequence, has a transmembrane domain, and biochemically copurifies with membranes. COMM mRNA and COMM protein are dynamically expressed during embryogenesis, including by CNS midline glia during the formation of the axon commissures. Anti-COMM antibodies reveal strong staining of organelles likely to include the Golgi complex and endosomes and weaker staining of the cell surface. As commissural growth cones contact and traverse the CNS midline, COMM protein is apparently transferred from midline glia to commissural axons."
https://openalex.org/W1997830187,"MITF (microphthalmia-associated transcription factor) encodes a transcription factor with a basic-helix-loop-helix-zipper (bHLH-Zip) motif. MITF mutations occur in patients with Waardenburg syndrome type 2, a disorder associated with melanocyte abnormalities. Here we show that ectopic expression of MITF converts NIH/3T3 fibroblasts into cells with characteristics of melanocytes. MITF transfectants formed foci of morphologically altered cells, which resemble those induced by oncogenes, but did not exhibit malignant phenotypes. Instead, they contained dendritic cells that express melanogenic marker proteins such as tyrosinase and tyrosinase-related protein 1. Most cloned cells of MITF transfectants exhibited dendritic morphology and expressed melanogenic markers, but such properties were not observed in cells transfected with closely related TFE3 cDNA. Our findings indicate that MITF is critically involved in melanocyte differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W2030288942,"The mesolimbic system is known to play a role in self-administration of opioids and psychostimulants. Although morphine and cocaine act by separate cellular mechanisms initially, the present study describes a common change in synaptic regulation of dopamine cells in the ventral tegmental area 1 week after termination of chronic treatment with either drug. Normally, D1 receptor activation augmented the amplitude of a gamma-aminobutyric acid type B (GABA(B)) inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP), but in drug-experienced animals, D1 receptor activation caused an inhibition of the GABA(B) IPSP. The inhibition was blocked by adenosine A1 receptor antagonists and by agents that disrupted the metabolism of cAMP. This long-lasting dopamine-adenosine interaction may be one mechanism involved in dopamine-mediated craving and relapse to drug-seeking behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2168497421,"Nitric oxide has been shown to be implicated in neural plasticity that underlies processes of learning and memory. In the honeybee, studies on the role of nitric oxide in associative olfactory learning reveal its specific function in memory formation. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase during olfactory conditioning impairs a distinct long-term memory that is formed as a consequence of multiple learning trials. Acquisition or retrieval of memory or memory formation induced by a single learning trial is not affected by blocking of nitric oxide synthase. This finding provides a first step toward dissection of molecular mechanisms involved in memory formation, in general, and the special function of nitric oxide synthase, in particular."

https://openalex.org/W2003106844,"cAMP and the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) are required in the mossy fiber pathway for both the early and the late phase of long-term potentiation (LTP). Since the CA3 region, which is the target of the mossy fibers, receives extensive noradrenergic innervation, we examined the role of beta-adrenergic receptors in mossy fiber LTP. We found that we could induce an early phase of LTP by pairing isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic receptor agonist, with a weak train, subthreshold for LTP. This LTP was specific to the mossy fiber pathway, was blocked by inhibitors of PKA, and occluded paired-pulse facilitation, suggesting that isoproterenol was acting presynaptically. When isoproterenol was paired with a train that induced only the early phase of LTP, it gave rise to a protein synthesis-dependent late phase. Consistent with these findings, beta-adrenergic antagonists blocked both the late and the early phase of LTP induced by mossy fiber stimulation. Thus, beta-adrenergic receptor modulation is important for both phases of mossy fiber LTP."
https://openalex.org/W2168553595,"Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in CA1 pyramidal neurons are both triggered by a postsynaptic rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). We used photolysis of postsynaptic caged Ca2+ compounds to search for differential thresholds for activation of these processes. Long-lasting potentiation (LLP) resembling LTP, and long-lasting depression (LLD) resembling LTD, were evoked by [Ca2+]i elevations of comparable magnitude and duration in different cells. No distinctions in threshold for these processes were detectable. LLP was occluded by tetanically induced LTP and blocked by calmodulin inhibition, and LLD was occluded by electrically induced LTD and blocked by phosphatase inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2017511420,"The developing vertebrate hindbrain consists of segments known as rhombomeres, which express combinations of Hox genes implicated in specifying segmental identity. Using chick-chick and chick-transgenic mouse graftings, we show that anterior to posterior rhombomere transpositions result in a progressive posterior transformation and coordinate induction of new Hox expression. This shows that hindbrain plasticity is evolutionarily conserved and implies rhombomeres may be undergoing continual assessment of their identities. The nature of the changes is dependent on both the anteroposterior position of the graft and its origin. Transposed somites from specific axial levels and developmental stages have a graded ability to induce changes in Hox expression, indicating that paraxial mesoderm is a source of the environmental signal responsible for the plasticity."

https://openalex.org/W2000851970,"The temporal and spatial changes in intracellular calcium levels during separate activation of parallel fiber (PF) and climbing fiber (CF) inputs to cerebellar Purkinje cells were studied. PF stimulation (1 Hz), at relatively high stimulus strengths, led to accumulations of calcium that were similar in peak levels to those following CF stimulation but that remained spatially localized. Such stimuli consistently induced a durable depression of PF synaptic transmission that partially occluded further depression by conventional conjunctive stimuli and that was independent of nitric oxide. This depression was accompanied by a reduction of synaptic efficacy in spatially isolated PF inputs to the same cell that was independent of postsynaptic calcium but that was mediated by nitric oxide. These data indicate that LTD comprises at least two separate processes and that parameters of PF stimulation that are capable of raising calcium levels in Purkinje cell dendrites are also able to induce long-term changes in synaptic efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2130274176,"Neurotrophin 3 (NT-3) can support the survival of some embryonic sympathetic neuroblasts before they become nerve growth factor dependent. We show that NT-3 is produced in vivo by nonneuronal cells neighboring embryonic sympathetic ganglia. NT-3 mRNA is produced by these nonneuronal cells in vitro and is up-regulated by platelet-derived growth factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and glial growth factor 2 (a neuregulin). Nonneuronal cellâ€“conditioned medium promotes survival and induces TrkA expression in isolated sympathetic neuroblasts, and this activity is blocked by anti-NT-3 antibody. Neuroblasts also enhance NT-3 production by nonneuronal cells. Neuroblasts synthesize several forms of neuregulin, and antibodies to neuregulin attenuate the effect of the neuroblasts on the nonneuronal cells. These data suggest a reciprocal cellâ€“cell interaction, in which neuroblast-derived neuregulins promote NT-3 production by neighboring nonneuronal cells, which in turn promotes neuroblast survival and further differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2005389490,"MinK has neither the P region nor signature sequence that characterizes pore-forming subunits of all known K+ channels. A specific minK region has now been identified that affects external blockade by 2 common probes of K+ channel pores. When mutated to cysteine, residues in this region render minK susceptible to covalent blockade by methanethiosulfonate ethylsulfonate and alter reversible inhibition by tetraethylammonium. The 2 blockers are found to share overlapping binding site determinants and to interact. Since inhibition by external tetraethylammonium is sensitive to voltage and to the internal concentration of permeant ions, we argue that tetraethylammonium blocks by occluding the external end of a water-filled transmembrane pore. These findings support the view that minK is directly involved in forming a K+-selective ion conduction pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2039140920,"We asked whether specifications of different regions of the rodent and avian telencephalon during development involved the acquisition of differential adhesive properties. Cells from different regions were aggregated in a short-term aggregation assay, and their segregation was analyzed. Both neurons and precursor cells from cortex segregate from striatal cells at early, but not later, stages, whereas cells from rodent neocortex and hippocampus segregated only during later stages. Segregation was abolished when Ca2+-dependent but not Ca2+-independent adhesion molecules were selectively removed. Thus, selective adhesion appears to be a conserved mechanism that restricts cellular mixing and might serve to maintain positional information during forebrain development. A candidate for mediating the Ca2+-dependent segregation is the CD15 (Lewis(x)) carbohydrate epitope, which is selectively expressed by mammalian cortex but not striatum."
https://openalex.org/W1963551424,"Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) can be regulated by synaptic activity and could therefore be involved in activity-dependent control of neuronal growth. We tested whether increased CaMKII activity in postsynaptic optic tectal neurons can modify the development of retinotectal axons in Xenopus. The elaboration of individual presynaptic retinal axons was observed in vivo before and up to 3 days after infecting the tectal cells with vaccinia virus carrying the gene for constitutively active truncated CaMKII (tCaMKII). Elevated postsynaptic CaMKII activity prevented the axons from developing the complexity of normal arbors by increasing the normal rate of branch retractions. Some effects of tCaMKII on arbor morphology were seen 1 day after infection, but they became more dramatic by the third day. The results suggest that postsynaptic CaMKII plays a role in the development of presynaptic arbor structure."
https://openalex.org/W2021635705,"G protein-coupled receptors are essential signaling molecules at sites of synaptic transmission. Here, we explore the mechanisms responsible for the use-dependent termination of metabotropic receptor signaling in embryonic sensory neurons. We report that the inhibition of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels mediated by alpha2-adrenergic receptors desensitizes slowly with prolonged exposure to the transmitter and that the desensitization is mediated by a G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK). Intracellular introduction of recombinant, purified kinases or synthetic blocking peptides into individual neurons demonstrates the specific involvement of a GRK3-like protein. These results suggest that GRK-mediated termination of receptor-G protein coupling is likely to regulate synaptic strength and, as such, may provide one effective mechanism for depression of synaptic transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2011374609,"To test the molecular nature of the NGF receptor responsible for the ability of NGF to rescue septal cholinergic neurons following axotomy, we infused polyclonal antibodies that act as specific agonists of trkA (RTA) into the lateral ventricle of fimbria-fornix lesioned animals. Rats receiving chronic intraventricular infusions of RTA showed significantly more low affinity NGF receptor immunoreactive (p75NGFR-IR) neurons on the lesioned side than did control animals 2 weeks following unilateral fimbria-fornix lesion. RTA also initiated cholinergic sprouting. Infusions of RTA in combination with an antibody that blocks p75NGFR (REX) did not reduce the cell savings effect observed with RTA alone. However, animals infused with RTA plus REX demonstrated significantly less sprouting. These findings suggest that antibody-induced trkA activation is sufficient to mediate NGF-promoted survival of axotomized cholinergic neurons in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2042328801,"The rapid transition of a stationary axon into a motile growth cone requires the recruitment of membrane and its strategic insertion into the neurolemma. The source of membrane to support the initial rapid growth postaxotomy is not known. Using membrane capacitance measurements, we examined quantitative aspects of membrane dynamics following axotomy of cultured Aplysia neurons. Axotomy activates two processes in parallel: membrane retrieval and exocytosis. Unexpectedly, membrane retrieval is the dominant process in the majority of the experiments. Thus, while a growth cone is vigorously extending, the total neuronal surface area decreases. We suggest that the initial rapid extension phase of the newly formed growth cone postaxotomy is supported by a pool of intracellular membrane that is rapidly retrieved from the neurolemma."
