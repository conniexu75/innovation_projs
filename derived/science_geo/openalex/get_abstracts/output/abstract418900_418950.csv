https://openalex.org/W1988706813,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), primarily ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, are inflammatory disorders caused by multiple factors. Research on IBD has often used the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model. DSS induces in vivo but not in vitro intestinal inflammation. In addition, no DSS-associated molecule (free glucose, sodium sulfate solution, free dextran) induces in vitro or in vivo intestinal inflammation. We find that DSS but not dextran associated molecules established linkages with medium-chain-length fatty acids (MCFAs), such as dodecanoate, that are present in the colonic lumen. DSS complexed to MCFAs forms nanometer-sized vesicles ∼200 nm in diameter that can fuse with colonocyte membranes. The arrival of nanometer-sized DSS/MCFA vesicles in the cytoplasm may activate intestinal inflammatory signaling pathways. We also show that the inflammatory activity of DSS is mediated by the dextran moieties. The deleterious effect of DSS is localized principally in the distal colon, therefore it will be important to chemically modify DSS to develop materials beneficial to the colon without affecting colon-targeting specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2004268432,In-vivo whole brain mapping of the radio frequency transmit field B1+ is a key aspect of recent method developments in ultra high field MRI. We present an optimized method for fast and robust in-vivo whole-brain B1+ mapping at 7T. The method is based on the acquisition of stimulated and spin echo 3D EPI images and was originally developed at 3T. We further optimized the method for use at 7T. Our optimization significantly improved the robustness of the method against large B1+ deviations and off-resonance effects present at 7T. The mean accuracy and precision of the optimized method across the brain was high with a bias less than 2.6 percent unit (p.u.) and random error less than 0.7 p.u. respectively.
https://openalex.org/W1965988311,"The tumor suppressor, PTEN is key to the regulation of diverse cellular processes, making it a prime candidate to be tightly regulated. The PTEN level is controlled in a major way by E3 ligase-mediated degradation through the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS). Nedd 4-1, XIAP, and WWP2 have been shown to maintain PTEN turnover. Here, we report that CHIP, the chaperone-associated E3 ligase, induces ubiquitination and regulates the proteasomal turnover of PTEN. It was apparent from our findings that PTEN transiently associates with the molecular chaperones and thereby gets diverted to the degradation pathway through its interaction with CHIP. The TPR domain of CHIP and parts of the N-terminal domain of PTEN are required for their interaction. Overexpression of CHIP leads to elevated ubiquitination and a shortened half-life of endogenous PTEN. On the other hand, depletion of endogenous CHIP stabilizes PTEN. CHIP is also shown to regulate PTEN-dependent transcription presumably through its down-regulation. PTEN shared an inverse correlation with CHIP in human prostate cancer patient samples, thereby triggering the prospects of a more complex mode of PTEN regulation in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2089506765,"Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death among men worldwide. In this study, using transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice, the effect of diet enriched with 1% w/w ursolic acid (UA) was investigated to evaluate the stage specific chemopreventive activity against prostate cancer. We found that TRAMP mice fed with UA diet for 8 weeks (weeks 4 to 12) delayed formation of prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). Similarly, mice fed with UA diet for 6 weeks (weeks 12 to 18) inhibited progression of PIN to adenocarcinoma as determined by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Finally, TRAMP mice fed with UA diet for 12 weeks (weeks 24 to 36) demonstrated markedly reduced tumor growth without any significant effects on total body weight and prolonged overall survival. With respect to the molecular mechanism, we found that UA down-regulated activation of various pro-inflammatory mediators including, NF-κB, STAT3, AKT and IKKα/β phosphorylation in the dorsolateral prostate (DLP) tissues that correlated with the reduction in serum levels of TNF-α and IL-6. In addition, UA significantly down-regulated the expression levels of cyclin D1 and COX-2 but up-regulated the levels of caspase-3 as revealed by immunohistochemical analysis of tumor tissue sections. Finally, UA was detected in serum samples obtained from various mice groups fed with enriched diet in nanogram quantity indicating that it is well absorbed in the GI tract. Overall, our findings provide strong evidence that UA can be an excellent agent for both the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1973866184,"The need for policy makers to understand science and for scientists to understand policy processes is widely recognised. However, the science-policy relationship is sometimes difficult and occasionally dysfunctional; it is also increasingly visible, because it must deal with contentious issues, or itself becomes a matter of public controversy, or both. We suggest that identifying key unanswered questions on the relationship between science and policy will catalyse and focus research in this field. To identify these questions, a collaborative procedure was employed with 52 participants selected to cover a wide range of experience in both science and policy, including people from government, non-governmental organisations, academia and industry. These participants consulted with colleagues and submitted 239 questions. An initial round of voting was followed by a workshop in which 40 of the most important questions were identified by further discussion and voting. The resulting list includes questions about the effectiveness of science-based decision-making structures; the nature and legitimacy of expertise; the consequences of changes such as increasing transparency; choices among different sources of evidence; the implications of new means of characterising and representing uncertainties; and ways in which policy and political processes affect what counts as authoritative evidence. We expect this exercise to identify important theoretical questions and to help improve the mutual understanding and effectiveness of those working at the interface of science and policy."
https://openalex.org/W2047299480,"We introduce a graph-theoretic approach to extract clusters and hierarchies in complex data-sets in an unsupervised and deterministic manner, without the use of any prior information. This is achieved by building topologically embedded networks containing the subset of most significant links and analyzing the network structure. For a planar embedding, this method provides both the intra-cluster hierarchy, which describes the way clusters are composed, and the inter-cluster hierarchy which describes how clusters gather together. We discuss performance, robustness and reliability of this method by first investigating several artificial data-sets, finding that it can outperform significantly other established approaches. Then we show that our method can successfully differentiate meaningful clusters and hierarchies in a variety of real data-sets. In particular, we find that the application to gene expression patterns of lymphoma samples uncovers biologically significant groups of genes which play key-roles in diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of some of the most relevant human lymphoid malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2031045624,"Exposure to toxic metals during the prenatal period carries the potential for adverse developmental effects to the fetus, yet such exposure remains largely unmonitored in the United States. The aim of this study was to assess maternal exposure to four toxic metals (arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), and lead (Pb)) in a cohort of pregnant women in North Carolina. We analyzed blood samples submitted to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services for blood typing to assess toxic metal levels in pregnant women (n = 211) across six North Carolina counties. Whole blood metal concentrations were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The association between maternal characteristics, including county of residence, age, and race, and metal exposure was analyzed using multiple linear regression analysis. A large fraction of the blood samples showed detectable levels for each of the four metals. Specifically, As (65.7%), Cd (57.3%), Hg (63.8%), and Pb (100%) were detected in blood samples. Moreover, compared with adult females participating in the Fourth National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals and guidelines for pregnant women, some women in the sample population exceeded benchmark levels of Cd, Hg, and Pb. Evidence from this pilot study indicates that pregnant women in North Carolina are exposed to As, Cd, Hg, and Pb and suggests that factors related to maternal county of residence and race may impact maternal exposure levels. As increased levels of one or more of these metals in utero have been associated with detrimental developmental and reproductive outcomes, further study is clearly warranted to establish the impacts to newborns."
https://openalex.org/W1973001247,"During their transit through the female genital tract, sperm have to recognize and discriminate numerous chemical compounds. However, our current knowledge of the molecular identity of appropriate chemosensory receptor proteins in sperm is still rudimentary. Considering that members of the Tas1r family of taste receptors are able to discriminate between a broad diversity of hydrophilic chemosensory substances, the expression of taste receptors in mammalian spermatozoa was examined.The present manuscript documents that Tas1r1 and Tas1r3, which form the functional receptor for monosodium glutamate (umami) in taste buds on the tongue, are expressed in murine and human spermatozoa, where their localization is restricted to distinct segments of the flagellum and the acrosomal cap of the sperm head. Employing a Tas1r1-deficient mCherry reporter mouse strain, we found that Tas1r1 gene deletion resulted in spermatogenic abnormalities. In addition, a significant increase in spontaneous acrosomal reaction was observed in Tas1r1 null mutant sperm whereas acrosomal secretion triggered by isolated zona pellucida or the Ca²⁺ ionophore A23187 was not different from wild-type spermatozoa. Remarkably, cytosolic Ca²⁺ levels in freshly isolated Tas1r1-deficient sperm were significantly higher compared to wild-type cells. Moreover, a significantly higher basal cAMP concentration was detected in freshly isolated Tas1r1-deficient epididymal spermatozoa, whereas upon inhibition of phosphodiesterase or sperm capacitation, the amount of cAMP was not different between both genotypes.Since Ca²⁺ and cAMP control fundamental processes during the sequential process of fertilization, we propose that the identified taste receptors and coupled signaling cascades keep sperm in a chronically quiescent state until they arrive in the vicinity of the egg - either by constitutive receptor activity and/or by tonic receptor activation by gradients of diverse chemical compounds in different compartments of the female reproductive tract."
https://openalex.org/W2039838339,"Background We investigated the prevalence of wild-type virus (no major drug resistance) and drug resistance mutations at second-line antiretroviral treatment (ART) failure in a large HIV treatment program in South Africa. Methodology/ Principal Findings HIV-infected patients ≥15 years of age who had failed protease inhibitor (PI)-based second-line ART (2 consecutive HIV RNA tests >1000 copies/ml on lopinavir/ritonavir, didanosine, and zidovudine) were identified retrospectively. Patients with virologic failure were continued on second-line ART. Genotypic testing for drug resistance was performed on frozen plasma samples obtained closest to and after the date of laboratory confirmed second-line ART failure. Of 322 HIV-infected patients on second-line ART, 43 were adults with confirmed virologic failure, and 33 had available plasma for viral sequencing. HIV-1 RNA subtype C predominated (n = 32, 97%). Mean duration on ART (SD) prior to initiation of second-line ART was 23 (17) months, and time from second-line ART initiation to failure was 10 (9) months. Plasma samples were obtained 7(9) months from confirmed failure. At second-line failure, 22 patients (67%) had wild-type virus. There was no major resistance to PIs found. Eleven of 33 patients had a second plasma sample taken 8 (5.5) months after the first. Median HIV-1 RNA and the genotypic resistance profile were unchanged. Conclusions/ Significance Most patients who failed second-line ART had wild-type virus. We did not observe evolution of resistance despite continuation of PI-based ART after failure. Interventions that successfully improve adherence could allow patients to continue to benefit from second-line ART therapy even after initial failure."

It is known from other cation channels that introducing pore mutations even if they largely affect their conductivity and permeability can evoke considerably different phenotypes compared with the deletion of the corresponding protein. Therefore, we generated TRPV6-deficient mice (Trpv6−/−) by deleting exons encoding transmembrane domains with the pore-forming region and the complete cytosolic C terminus harboring binding sites for TRPV6-associated proteins that regulate its activity and plasma membrane anchoring. Using this strategy, we aimed to determine whether the TRPV6D541A pore mutant still contributes to residual channel activity and/or channel-independent functions in vivo. Trpv6−/− males reveal severe defects in fertility and motility and viability of sperm and a significant increase in epididymal luminal Ca2+ concentration that is mirrored by a lack of Ca2+ uptake by the epididymal epithelium. Therewith, Trpv6 excision affects epididymal Ca2+ handling and male fertility to the same extent as the introduction of the D541A pore mutation, arguing against residual functions of the TRPV6D541A pore mutant in epididymal epithelial cells.

The maintenance of body Ca2+ homeostasis is essential for many vital functions including neuronal excitability, muscle contraction, and bone formation. Ca2+ acquisition in the body occurs via trans- and paracellular transport processes across the continuous layer of epithelial cells. About 10 years ago, transcripts of the structurally closely related TRPV6 and TRPV5 were identified in the epithelia of the kidney (2.Hoenderop J.G. van der Kemp A.W.

These channels exhibit many features possessed by Ca2+ transporters in epithelial cells (6.Hoenderop J.G. Nilius B. Bindels R.J.

Accordingly, they were assumed to be epithelial Ca2+ uptake channels. Crucial for Ca2+ permeation through TRPV6 and TRPV5 channels is a single aspartate residue within the pore-forming loop of both proteins; replacing this aspartate residue at position 541 in mouse TRPV6 or at position 542 in rabbit TRPV5 by an alanine residue renders the channels impermeable to Ca2+ (9.Voets T. Janssens A. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Mg2+-dependent gating and strong inward rectification of the cation channel TRPV6.J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 121: 245-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We studied the impact of this mutation in vivo with a mouse model in which the D541A mutation of TRPV6 was introduced in the germ line by a gene targeting approach (1.Weissgerber P. Kriebs U. Tsvilovskyy V. Olausson J. Kretz O. Stoerger C. Vennekens R. Wissenbach U. Middendorff R. Flockerzi V. Freichel M. Male fertility depends on Ca2+ absorption by TRPV6 in epididymal epithelia.Sci. Signal. 2011; 4: ra27Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Males homozygous for this single amino acid substitution (TRPV6D541A/D541A) exhibited a severely impaired fertility and a large reduction of motility and fertilization capacity of sperm despite intact spermatogenesis. An increase in Ca2+ in spermatozoa is an important signal to promote their motility, capacitation, and the acrosome reaction (10.Darszon A. Acevedo J.J. Galindo B.E. Hernández-González E.O.

Florman H.M. The state of the union: the cell biology of fertilization.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: s57-s63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but Trpv6 transcripts were not detectable in spermatozoa or in the germinal epithelium, and there was no evidence for a cell-autonomous impairment of sperm Ca2+ signaling (1.Weissgerber P. Kriebs U. Tsvilovskyy V. Olausson J. Kretz O. Stoerger C. Vennekens R. Wissenbach U. Middendorff R. Flockerzi V. Freichel M. Male fertility depends on Ca2+ absorption by TRPV6 in epididymal epithelia.Sci. Signal. 2011; 4: ra27Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, we identified Trpv6 transcripts in the epididymal epithelium and TRPV6 proteins in the apical membrane of this epithelium and showed that the luminal Ca2+ concentration is increased by 10-fold in the caudal epididymal fluid of Trpv6D541A/D541A males compared with that of wild-type mice. Additional measurements of Ca2+ uptake from the epididymal fluid from Trpv6D541A/D541A mice into the epididymis revealed a reduction of uptake by 7–8-fold compared with fluid from wild-type animals (1.Weissgerber P. Kriebs U. Tsvilovskyy V. Olausson J. Kretz O. Stoerger C. Vennekens R. Wissenbach U. Middendorff R. Flockerzi V. Freichel M. Male fertility depends on Ca2+ absorption by TRPV6 in epididymal epithelia.Sci. Signal. 2011; 4: ra27Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Apparently, the intact TRPV6 proteins are essential components of Ca2+ uptake channels in the epididymal epithelium that are responsible for the decrease of the Ca2+ concentration in the epididymal fluid along the epididymal duct, generating a luminal Ca2+ gradient with higher Ca2+ concentration in the caput portion (proximal segments) of the epididymal duct and lower Ca2+ concentrations in its caudal (distal) segments. It is well known that the composition of the epididymal fluid differs considerably among separate epididymal segments. This is caused by differences in secretory and absorptive activities of the epididymal epithelium (12.Levine N. Kelly H. Measurement of pH in the rat epididymis in vivo.J. Reprod.

Notably, the Ca2+ concentration decreases markedly in the epididymal fluid along the epididymal duct toward its distal segments, the cauda epididymis (14.Jenkins A.D. Lechene C.P. Howards S.S. Concentrations of seven elements in the intraluminal fluids of the rat seminiferous tubules, rate testis, and epididymis.Biol. Reprod. 1980; 23: 981-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It is this luminal Ca2+ gradient that is severely compromised by the TRPV6D541A mutation, resulting in a dramatic but incomplete loss of sperm motility and fertilization capacity. The direct electrophysiological recording of channel activity was not possible either from wild-type or from D541A mutant epididymal cells. Our own results and a survey of the literature on TRPV6 and its closest relative, TRPV5, revealed that direct recordings of TRPV6 and TRPV5 currents from acutely prepared primary cells expressing Trpv6 or Trpv5 transcripts have not been described. Instead, Ca2+ uptake measurements similar to those we performed (17.Freichel M. Wissenbach U. Philipp S. Flockerzi V. Alternative splicing and tissue specific expression of the 5′ truncated bCCE 1 variant bCCE 1Δ514.FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 354-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) have been used to identify (10.Darszon A. Acevedo J.J. Galindo B.E. Hernández-González E.O. Nishigaki T. Treviño C.L. Wood C. Beltrán C. Sperm channel diversity and functional multiplicity.Reproduction. 2006; 131: 977-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 18.Farley F.W. Soriano P. Steffen L.S. Dymecki S.M. Widespread recombinase expression using FLPeR (flipper) mice.Genesis. 2000; 28: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) and characterize these channels in primary cells. Although Ca2+ uptake was reduced by 7–8-fold in Trpv6D541A/D541A mice, we could not exclude residual channel activity of the properly expressed and trafficked, yet mutated TRPV6D541A proteins, which might in addition serve channel-independent functions as structural and/or scaffolding components (19.van de Graaf S.F. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. Regulation of TRPV5 and TRPV6 by associated proteins.Am. J. Physiol. Renal. Physiol. 2006; 290: F1295-F1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) of the epithelial plasma membrane. Thus, the TRPV6D541A mutation might not be sufficient to identify all TRPV6-related functions, and it is conceivable that a complete loss of TRPV6 proteins leads to additional phenotypes. Similarly, the GluRδ2Q618R pore mutation, although rendering GluRδ2 channels nominally impermeable to Ca2+ (20.Wollmuth L.P. Kuner T. Jatzke C. Seeburg P.H. Heintz N. Zuo J. The Lurcher mutation identifies δ2 as an AMPA/kainate receptor-like channel that is potentiated by Ca2+.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5973-5980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), did not cause the defects in synaptic plasticity of hippocampal neurons and motor coordination that were evoked by the complete inactivation of the GluRδ2 gene in mice (21.Kakegawa W. Miyazaki T. Hirai H. Motohashi J. Mishina M. Watanabe M. Yuzaki M. Ca2+ permeability of the channel pore is not essential for the δ2 glutamate receptor to regulate synaptic plasticity and motor coordination.J. Physiol. 2007; 579: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We therefore generated a second mouse line using a Cre-loxP-based gene targeting strategy to delete exons 13, 14, and 15 of the Trpv6 gene that encode part of the fifth and sixth transmembrane-spanning domains, the pore linker in between, and the complete cytosolic C terminus. By deleting almost one-third of the protein-encoding DNA, we not only eliminated an essential part of the ion-conducting pore but also disrupted essentially the predicted structure of the protein. We now show that mice homozygous for this gene excision were viable, and our analysis reveals that the Ca2+ concentration in the caudal epididymal fluid and the motility, fertilization capacity, and viability of Trpv6−/− sperm are affected to the same extent as in Trpv6D541A/D541A mice. These results indicate that the TRPV6 deletion occurring in Trpv6−/− mice does not further aggravate the phenotype observed in Trpv6D541A/D541A mice, arguing against residual channel activity and against channel-independent scaffolding functions of the TRPV6D541A protein that may influence epididymal Ca2+ absorption or fertilization capacity indirectly. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with German legislation on the protection of animals and were approved by the local ethics committee. The generation of TRPV6−/− mice and the maintenance of the mouse line as well as the experiments performed were approved (reference number K110/180-07; approved on December 10, 2002, December 28, 2004, and January 17, 2007) by the “Kreispolizeibehörde des Saarpfalz-Kreises, Deutschland” and was performed by M.

All these people got permission to perform the experiments described by the local ethics committee and “Kreispolizeibehörde des Saarpfalz-Kreises, Deutschland.” They all have a long-standing experience and authorization in the generation and phenotypic analysis of transgenic mice (e.g. Ref. 1.Weissgerber P.

The 5′ and 3′ homology arms of the targeting vector were amplified from genomic DNA of R1 ES cells using Pfu polymerase. The 5′ homology arm was cloned 5′ of a loxP site followed by the genomic sequence containing exons 13, 14, and 15; an FRT 3The abbreviation used are:FRTFlp recombinase target sitePGKphosphoglycerol kinase. sequence-flanked PGK promotor-driven neomycin resistance gene cassette (neo), and a second loxP site. The sequence of the loxP site was inserted in the 16th intron of the Ephb6 gene, which is oriented tail to tail with Trpv6 in the mouse genome separated by 120 bp only. Accordingly, Cre-mediated excision of exons 13, 14, and 15 of the Trpv6 gene leads to deletion of exons 17 and 18 of the adjacent Ephb6 gene. The herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase cassette (HSVtk) and an eGFP cassette were introduced for negative selection. Gene targeting in R1 ES cells was performed as described (1.Weissgerber P. Kriebs U. Tsvilovskyy V. Olausson J. Kretz O. Stoerger C. Vennekens R. Wissenbach U. Middendorff R. Flockerzi V. Freichel M. Male fertility depends on Ca2+ absorption by TRPV6 in epididymal epithelia.Sci. Signal. 2011; 4: ra27Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). One of 327 double resistant colonies showed homologous recombination at the Trpv6 locus as confirmed by Southern blot hybridization with a 5′ and 3′ probe external to the targeting vector and a neo probe. Germ line chimeras were obtained by injection of correctly targeted ES cell clone 6F11 into C57Bl/6 blastocysts. Trpv6−/− mice on the mixed (129/SvJ × C57Bl/6N) background were compared with F1 offspring of 129SvJ × C57Bl/6N matings unless stated otherwise. Routinely, mice were genotyped using PCR. Additionally, an independent Trpv6−/− mouse line was generated from Trpv6+/D541A mice (ES cell clone 8E11b) by Cre-mediated excision of genomic sequences containing exons 13–15 and analyzed via computer-assisted sperm analysis. All animal experiments were performed according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the United States National Institutes of Health and were approved by the local ethics committee. Flp recombinase target site phosphoglycerol kinase. Poly(A)+ RNA (10 μg) from epididymis and testis of wild-type and Trpv6−/− mice was used for Northern blot analysis as described (17.Freichel M. Wissenbach U. Philipp S. Flockerzi V. Alternative splicing and tissue specific expression of the 5′ truncated bCCE 1 variant bCCE 1Δ514.FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 354-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Blots were hybridized with a randomly labeled cDNA probe comprising exons 13, 14, and 15 of the mTrpv6 cDNA (nucleotides 1741–2849; GenBankTM accession number AJ542487), and filters were exposed to x-ray films for 19 h. To analyze expression of Trpv6 transcripts in prostate, we prepared RNA from prostate using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) and performed one-step reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR; Invitrogen) using 20 ng of total RNA/reaction. The following intron-spanning primers were used: for amplification of a specific Trpv6 fragment comprising 258 bp: UK_V6_16 (5′-GTC TGG CAT CAG CCT CAG C-3′; exon 1) and UK_V6_33 (5′-CTC ACA TCC TTC AAA CTT GAG C-3′; exon 2); for amplification of full-length Trpv6 cDNA comprising 2312 bp: UK_V6_17 (5′-CAG GGT CGA GCC CAG TTG G-3′; located in the 5′-untranslated region of exon 1) and UK_V6_14 (5′-CTC GCA GGA TGA CCT TAG CTG-3′; located in the 3′-untranslated region of exon 15). RNA isolated from epididymis was used as a positive control. Fertility analysis was done basically as described in Weissgerber et al. (1.Weissgerber P. Kriebs U. Tsvilovskyy V. Olausson J. Kretz O. Stoerger C. Vennekens R. Wissenbach U. Middendorff R. Flockerzi V. Freichel M. Male fertility depends on Ca2+ absorption by TRPV6 in epididymal epithelia.Sci. Signal. 2011; 4: ra27Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In brief, adult male Trpv6+/− and Trpv6−/− mice were continuously housed with adult Trpv6+/− and Trpv6−/− females over a period of 16 weeks, and the number and size of litters as well as the genotype of offspring were recorded. Considering 3 weeks per pregnancy and assuming that the adult female mouse gets pregnant within the 1st week after the birth of the litter, four litters can be expected per mating under optimal conditions during this time period of 16 weeks. In reality, we observed that each wild-type/wild-type mating produced slightly fewer numbers of litters, that is 3.375 litters in 16 weeks (27 litters per eight matings; see Ref. 1.Weissgerber P.

Signal. 2011; 4: ra27Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) were performed in our animal facility under identical conditions. For copulatory behavior analysis, the ratio of plug-positive females per mating was evaluated. After flushing of the oviduct of plug-positive females, collected embryos were distinguished from non-fertilized eggs by Hoechst 33258 staining of DNA. Body weight was analyzed weekly in wild-type, Trpv6+/−, and Trpv6−/− littermates from Trpv6+/− intercrosses until the age of 21 weeks. To compare body weight development between Trpv6−/− and Trpv6D541A/D541A mice, body weight at the age of 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks was divided by the body weight of the same mouse at the age of 1 week and normalized to the corresponding body weight ratio obtained from wild-type littermates. Isolation of spermatozoa, computer-assisted sperm analysis, in vitro fertilization, and sperm viability analysis were performed as described in detail (1.Weissgerber P. Kriebs U. Tsvilovskyy V. Olausson J. Kretz O. Stoerger C. Vennekens R. Wissenbach U. Middendorff R. Flockerzi V. Freichel M. Male fertility depends on Ca2+ absorption by TRPV6 in epididymal epithelia.Sci. Signal. 2011; 4: ra27Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To analyze whether the Trpv6− allele was inherited in a mendelian ratio, Trpv6+/− males and females at the age of 3–4 months were intercrossed, and offspring were analyzed with respect to the Trpv6 genotype. Capacitated spermatozoa were placed in a 100-μm chamber at 37 °C temperature on a slide warmer and videotaped using a DCR-SR90 Handycam (Sony) connected to an inverted microscope (AxioVision 40 CFL, Zeiss). Selected sequences were processed using Adobe PREMIERE software. Whole organ preparation, histological analysis, and Ca2+ measurements in the epididymal fluid were done as described (1.Weissgerber P. Kriebs U. Tsvilovskyy V. Olausson J. Kretz O. Stoerger C. Vennekens R. Wissenbach U. Middendorff R. Flockerzi V. Freichel M.

Data are presented as mean ± S.E. of n independent experiments unless otherwise stated. The Origin 7.0 software (OriginLab) was used for statistical analysis. Significance was assessed with the two-sample Student's t test (p < 0.05 for significance) unless stated otherwise. Offspring frequency in the mating analysis and weight gain were analyzed using analysis of variance. The occurrence of different genotypes in the inheritance analysis of the Trpv6− allele was analyzed using a two-tailed χ2 test (GraphPad Software). We used a Cre-loxP-mediated gene targeting strategy in embryonic stem cells to generate Trpv6-deficient mice (Fig. 1, a and b). We confirmed homologous recombination in Trpv6+/L2F2 ES cells and Cre-mediated excision of exons 13, 14, and 15, which encode part of transmembrane domain 5, transmembrane domain 6, the pore-forming region in between, and the adjacent amino acids forming the complete intracellular C terminus of TRPV6, in Trpv6+/− and Trpv6−/− mice by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 1, c and d). In parallel, mice heterozygous for the Trpv6L2F2 allele (Trpv6+/L2F2) were bred with FlpeR (129S4/SvJaeSor-Gt (ROSA)26Sortm1(FLP1) Dym/J) mice (18.Farley F.W. Soriano P. Steffen L.S. Dymecki S.M. Widespread recombinase expression using FLPeR (flipper) mice.Genesis. 2000; 28: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) to remove the neor cassette and to produce mice with a conditional Trpv6+/L2F1 allele (Fig. 1, e and f). Northern blot analysis revealed specific 2.9-kb Trpv6 transcripts expressed in placenta and epididymis but not in testis from wild-type mice (Fig. 1g), supporting our previous finding that TRPV6 is not expressed in testes. After Cre-mediated excision, Trpv6 transcripts were no longer detectable in epididymis of the resulting Trpv6−/− mice (Fig. 1g), confirming effective excision of the Trpv6 gene. However, this lack of TRPV6 expression is in contrast to the results obtained from epididymis of Trpv6D541A/D541A mice where the identical probe hybridized to Trpv6 transcripts indistinguishable from the transcripts observed in wild type (1.Weissgerber P.

Trpv6−/− mice were viable and showed no obvious anatomical abnormalities, and the Trpv6− allele was segregated with the expected Mendelian frequency (Fig. 2a). Analysis of the weight gain of Trpv6+/− males and females revealed no growth defects during development and adulthood up to 21 weeks after birth (Fig. 2, b and c).FIGURE 2Segregation of Trpv6− allele is normal, but Trpv6−/− males are hypofertile despite normal copulatory behavior. a, segregation analysis from 477 offspring derived from 62 litters and 16 Trpv6+/− × Trpv6+/− matings. b and c, weight gain analysis in wild-type (black), Trpv6+/− (green), and Trpv6−/− (red) male (b) and female (c) mice.

Altered glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA and protein expression in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in psychiatric illness have also been reported, but the cause of these abnormalities is not known. We quantified expression of GR mRNA transcript variants which employ different 5′ promoters, in 35 schizophrenia cases, 31 bipolar disorder cases and 34 controls. We also explored whether sequence variation within the NR3C1 (GR) gene is related to GR mRNA variant expression. Total GR mRNA was decreased in the DLPFC in schizophrenia cases relative to controls (15.1%, p<0.0005) and also relative to bipolar disorder cases (8.9%, p<0.05). GR-1B mRNA was decreased in schizophrenia cases relative to controls (20.2%, p<0.05), while GR-1C mRNA was decreased in both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder cases relative to controls (16.1% and 17.2% respectively, both p<0.005). A dose-dependent effect of rs10052957 genotype on GR-1B mRNA expression was observed, where CC homozygotes displayed 18.4% lower expression than TC heterozygotes (p<0.05), and 31.8% lower expression than TT homozygotes (p<0.005). Similarly, a relationship between rs6190 (R23K) genotype and GR-1C expression was seen, with 24.8% lower expression in GG homozygotes than GA heterozygotes (p<0.01). We also observed an effect of rs41423247 (Bcl1) SNP on expression of 67 kDa GRα isoform, the most abundant GRα isoform in the DLPFC. These findings suggest possible roles for the GR-1B and GR-1C promoter regions in mediating GR gene expression changes in psychotic illness, and highlight the potential importance of sequence variation within the NR3C1 gene in modulating GR mRNA expression in the DLPFC."
https://openalex.org/W1967229972,"Four cellobiohydrolase I (CBHI) glycoforms, namely, CBHI-A, CBHI-B, CBHI-C, and CBHI-D, were purified from the cultured broth of Penicillium decumbens JU-A10. All glycoforms had the same amino acid sequence but displayed different characteristics and biological functions. The effects of the N-glycans of the glycoforms on CBH activity were analyzed using mass spectrum data. Longer N-glycan chains at the Asn-137 of CBHI increased CBH activity. After the N-glycans were removed using site-directed mutagenesis and homologous expression in P. decumbens, the specific CBH activity of the recombinant CBHI without N-glycosylation increased by 65% compared with the wild-type CBHI with the highest specific activity. However, the activity was not stable. Only the N-glycosylation at Asn-137 can improve CBH activity by 40%. rCBHI with N-glycosylation only at Asn-470 exhibited no enzymatic activity. CBH activity was affected whether or not the protein was glycosylated, together with the N-glycosylation site and N-glycan structure. N-Glycosylation not only affects CBH activity but may also bring a new feature to a nonhydrolytic CBHI glycoform (CBHI-A). By supplementing CBHI-A to different commercial cellulase preparations, the glucose yield of lignocellulose hydrolysis increased by >20%. After treatment with a low dose (5 mg/g substrate) of CBHI-A at 50 °C for 7 days, the hydrogen-bond intensity and crystalline degree of cotton fibers decreased by 17 and 34%, respectively. These results may provide new guidelines for cellulase engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2007633603,"The anti-inflammatory properties associated with intravenous immunoglobulin therapy require the sialic acid modification of the N-glycan of the Fc domain of IgG. Sialylation of the Fc fragment is mediated by β-galactoside α2,6-sialyltransferase 1 (ST6Gal-1), acting on the Gal(β4)GlcNAc terminal structure of the biantennary N-glycans on the Fc domain. However, little is known regarding the in vivo regulation of Fc sialylation and its role in the progression of inflammatory processes. Here, we report that decreased Fc sialylation of circulatory IgG accompanies the acute phase response elicited by turpentine exposure or upon acute exposure to either nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae or ovalbumin. However, Fc sialylation was increased 3-fold from the base line upon transition to chronic inflammation by repeated exposure to challenge. The P1 promoter of the ST6Gal-1 gene is critical for Fc sialylation, but P1 does not drive ST6Gal-1 expression in B cells. The Siat1ΔP1 mouse, with a dysfunctional P1 promoter, was unable to produce sialylated Fc in the systemic circulation, despite the presence of Gal(β4)GlcNAc termini on the Fc glycans. The major contribution of P1 action is to synthesize ST6Gal-1 enzymes that are deposited into the systemic circulation. The data strongly indicate that this pool of extracellular ST6Gal-1 in the blood impacts the sialylation of IgG Fc and that defective Fc sialylation is likely a major contributing mechanism for the proinflammatory tendencies previously noted in Siat1ΔP1 animals."

ApoE4 is the major genetic risk factor for the age-dependent form of AD, which accounts for 95% of cases. Here we show that in synaptic networks formed from primary hippocampal neurons in culture, apoE3, but not apoE4, prevents the loss of synaptic networks produced by amyloid β oligomers (amylospheroids). Specific activators of PKCϵ, such as 8-(2-(2-pentyl-cyclopropylmethyl)-cyclopropyl)-octanoic acid methyl ester and bryostatin 1, protected against synaptic loss by amylospheroids, whereas PKCϵ inhibitors blocked this synaptic protection and also blocked the protection by apoE3. Blocking LRP1, an apoE receptor on the neuronal membrane, also blocked the protection by apoE. ApoE3, but not apoE4, induced the synthesis of PKCϵ mRNA and expression of the PKCϵ protein. Amyloid β specifically blocked the expression of PKCϵ but had no effect on other isoforms. These results suggest that protection against synaptic loss by apoE is mediated by a novel intracellular PKCϵ pathway. This apoE pathway may account for much of the protective effect of apoE and reduced risk for the age-dependent form of AD.

Latitudinal and temporal variations in mean temperatures force ectotherms to adapt to these complex environmental conditions. Studies investigating current patterns of thermal adaptation among populations of different latitudes allow a prediction of the potential impact of prospective increases in environmental temperatures on their fitness.In this study, temperature reaction norms were ascertained among 18 genetically defined, natural clones of the microbial eukaryote Paramecium caudatum. These different clones have been isolated from 12 freshwater habitats along a latitudinal transect in Europe and from 3 tropical habitats (Indonesia). The sensitivity to increasing temperatures was estimated through the analysis of clone specific thermal tolerances and by relating those to current and predicted temperature data of their natural habitats. All investigated European clones seem to be thermal generalists with a broad thermal tolerance and similar optimum temperatures. The weak or missing co-variation of thermal tolerance with latitude does not imply local adaptation to thermal gradients; it rather suggests adaptive phenotypic plasticity among the whole European subpopulation. The tested Indonesian clones appear to be locally adapted to the less variable, tropical temperature regime and show higher tolerance limits, but lower tolerance breadths.Due to the lack of local temperature adaptation within the European subpopulation, P. caudatum genotypes at the most southern edge of their geographic range seem to suffer from the predicted increase in magnitude and frequency of summer heat waves caused by climate change."

The import of cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial membrane, the rate-limiting step in steroid biosynthesis, relies on the formation of a protein complex that assembles at the outer mitochondrial membrane called the transduceosome. The transduceosome contains several mitochondrial and cytosolic components, including the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR). Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) induces de novo synthesis of STAR, a process shown to parallel maximal steroid production. In the hCG-dependent steroidogenic MA-10 mouse Leydig cell line, the 14-3-3γ protein was identified in native mitochondrial complexes by mass spectrometry and immunoblotting, and its levels increased in response to hCG treatment. The 14-3-3 proteins bind and regulate the activity of many proteins, acting via target protein activation, modification and localization.

Rectal instillation of the chemical irritant trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) provoked a dramatic acute inflammation in the colon of 7–9 weeks old mice. Coincident subcutaneous application of 100 µg/kg XG-102 significantly reduced the loss of body weight, rectal bleeding and diarrhoea. After 72 h, the end of the study, the colon was removed and immuno-histochemically analysed. XG-102 significantly reduced (i) pathological changes such as ulceration or crypt deformation, (ii) immune cell pathology such as infiltration and presence of CD3- and CD68-positive cells, (iii) the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in colon tissue cultures from TNBS-treated mice, (iv) expression of Bim, Bax, FasL, p53, and activation of caspase 3, (v) complexation of JNK2 and Bim, and (vi) expression and activation of the JNK substrate and transcription factor c-Jun. A single application of subcutaneous XG-102 was at least as effective or even better depending on the outcome parameter as the daily oral application of sulfasalazine used for treatment of IBD.

https://openalex.org/W2117423650,Background Down regulation of genes coding for nucleoside transporters and drug metabolism responsible for uptake and metabolic activation of the nucleoside gemcitabine is related with acquired tumor resistance against this agent. Hydralazine has been shown to reverse doxorubicin resistance in a model of breast cancer. Here we wanted to investigate whether epigenetic mechanisms are responsible for acquiring resistance to gemcitabine and if hydralazine could restore gemcitabine sensitivity in cervical cancer cells. Methodology/Principal Findings The cervical cancer cell line CaLo cell line was cultured in the presence of increasing concentrations of gemcitabine. Down-regulation of hENT1 & dCK genes was observed in the resistant cells (CaLoGR) which was not associated with promoter methylation. Treatment with hydralazine reversed gemcitabine resistance and led to hENT1 and dCK gene reactivation in a DNA promoter methylation-independent manner. No changes in HDAC total activity nor in H3 and H4 acetylation at these promoters were observed. ChIP analysis showed H3K9m2 at hENT1 and dCK gene promoters which correlated with hyper-expression of G9A histone methyltransferase at RNA and protein level in the resistant cells. Hydralazine inhibited G9A methyltransferase activity in vitro and depletion of the G9A gene by iRNA restored gemcitabine sensitivity. Conclusions/Significance Our results demonstrate that acquired gemcitabine resistance is associated with DNA promoter methylation-independent hENT1 and dCK gene down-regulation and hyper-expression of G9A methyltransferase. Hydralazine reverts gemcitabine resistance in cervical cancer cells via inhibition of G9A histone methyltransferase.
https://openalex.org/W1965331945,"The neural retinal leucine zipper (Nrl) knockout mouse is a widely used model to study cone photoreceptor development, physiology, and molecular biology in the absence of rods. In the Nrl−/− retina, rods are converted into functional cone-like cells. The Nrl−/− retina is characterized by large undulations of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) commonly known as rosettes. Here we explore the mechanism of rosette development in the Nrl−/− retina. We report that rosettes first appear at postnatal day (P)8, and that the structure of nascent rosettes is morphologically distinct from what is seen in the adult retina. The lumen of these nascent rosettes contains a population of aberrant cells protruding into the subretinal space that induce infolding of the ONL. Morphologically adult rosettes do not contain any cell bodies and are first detected at P15. The cells found in nascent rosettes are photoreceptors in origin but lack inner and outer segments. We show that the adherens junctions between photoreceptors and Müller glia which comprise the retinal outer limiting membrane (OLM) are not uniformly formed in the Nrl−/− retina and thus allow protrusion of a population of developing photoreceptors into the subretinal space where their maturation becomes delayed. These data suggest that the rosettes of the Nrl−/− retina arise due to defects in the OLM and delayed maturation of a subset of photoreceptors, and that rods may play an important role in the proper formation of the OLM."
https://openalex.org/W1990110377,"Each year, millions of monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) migrate up to 3000 km from their overwintering grounds in central Mexico to breed in eastern North America. Malcolm et al. (1993) articulated two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses to explain how Monarchs re-colonize North America each spring. The ‘successive brood’ hypothesis proposes that monarchs migrate from Mexico to the Gulf Coast, lay eggs and die, leaving northern re-colonization of the breeding range to subsequent generations. The ‘single sweep’ hypothesis proposes that overwintering monarchs continue to migrate northward after arriving on the Gulf coast and may reach the northern portion of the breeding range, laying eggs along the way. To examine these hypotheses, we sampled monarchs throughout the northern breeding range and combined stable-hydrogen isotopes (δD) to estimate natal origin with wing wear scores to differentiate between individuals born in the current vs. previous year. Similar to Malcolm et al. (1993), we found that the majority of the northern breeding range was re-colonized by the first generation of monarchs (90%). We also estimated that a small number of individuals (10%) originated directly from Mexico and, therefore adopted a sweep strategy. Contrary to Malcolm et al. (1993), we found that 62% of monarchs sampled in the Great Lakes originated from the Central U.S., suggesting that this region is important for sustaining production in the northern breeding areas. Our results provide new evidence of re-colonization patterns in monarchs and contribute important information towards identifying productive breeding regions of this unique migratory insect."
https://openalex.org/W1969412188,"Introduction Tackling health inequities both within and between countries remains high on the agenda of international organizations including the World Health Organization and local, regional and national governments. Systematic reviews can be a useful tool to assess effects on equity in health status because they include studies conducted in a variety of settings and populations. This study aims to describe the extent to which the impacts of health interventions on equity in health status are considered in systematic reviews, describe methods used, and assess the implications of their equity related findings for policy, practice and research. Methods We conducted a methodology study of equity assessment in systematic reviews. Two independent reviewers extracted information on the reporting and analysis of impacts of health interventions on equity in health status in a group of 300 systematic reviews collected from all systematic reviews indexed in one month of MEDLINE, using a pre-tested data collection form. Any differences in data extraction were resolved by discussion. Results Of the 300 systematic reviews, 224 assessed the effectiveness of interventions on health outcomes. Of these 224 reviews, 29 systematic reviews assessed effects on equity in health status using subgroup analysis or targeted analyses of vulnerable populations. Of these, seven conducted subgroup analyses related to health equity which were reported in insufficient detail to judge their credibility. Of these 29 reviews, 18 described implications for policy and practice based on assessment of effects on health equity. Conclusion The quality and completeness of reporting should be enhanced as a priority, because without this policymakers and practitioners will continue lack the evidence base they need to inform decision-making about health inequity. Furthermore, there is a need to develop methods to systematically consider impacts on equity in health status that is currently lacking in systematic reviews."
https://openalex.org/W2004818660,"Detecting the factors that determine the interruption of gene flow between populations is key to understanding how speciation occurs. In this context, caves are an excellent system for studying processes of colonization, differentiation and speciation, since they represent discrete geographical units often with known geological histories. Here, we asked whether discontinuous calcareous areas and cave systems represent major barriers to gene flow within and among the five species of Sardinian cave salamanders (genus Hydromantes) and whether intraspecific genetic structure parallels geographic distance within and among caves. We generated mitochondrial cytochrome b gene sequences from 184 individuals representing 48 populations, and used a Bayesian phylogeographic approach to infer possible areas of cladogenesis for these species and reconstruct historical and current dispersal routes among distinct populations. Our results show deep genetic divergence within and among all Sardinian cave salamander species, which can mostly be attributed to the effects of mountains and discontinuities in major calcareous areas and cave systems acting as barriers to gene flow. While these salamander species can also occur outside caves, our results indicate that there is a very poor dispersal of these species between separate cave systems."
https://openalex.org/W2042051919,"Protein-protein interactions are thought to modulate the efficiency and specificity of Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) signaling in specific subcellular compartments. Here we show that the F-actin-binding protein α-actinin targets CaMKIIα to F-actin in cells by binding to the CaMKII regulatory domain, mimicking CaM. The interaction with α-actinin is blocked by CaMKII autophosphorylation at Thr-306, but not by autophosphorylation at Thr-305, whereas autophosphorylation at either site blocks Ca2+/CaM binding. The binding of α-actinin to CaMKII is Ca2+-independent and activates the phosphorylation of a subset of substrates in vitro. In intact cells, α-actinin selectively stabilizes CaMKII association with GluN2B-containing glutamate receptors and enhances phosphorylation of Ser-1303 in GluN2B, but inhibits CaMKII phosphorylation of Ser-831 in glutamate receptor GluA1 subunits by competing for activation by Ca2+/CaM. These data show that Ca2+-independent binding of α-actinin to CaMKII differentially modulates the phosphorylation of physiological targets that play key roles in long-term synaptic plasticity.

Binding of Ca2+/CaM activates CaMKII and Thr-286 autophosphorylation, creating an autonomously active form of CaMKII that is a molecular memory of transient Ca2+ signals. Dissociation of Ca2+/CaM allows for rapid autophosphorylation at Thr-305 or Thr-306 (Thr-305/6), blocking re-association of Ca2+/CaM such that CaMKII is desensitized to subsequent Ca2+ signals (reviewed in Refs. 1Colbran R.J.

Neuronal Ca2+ signals can be tightly compartmentalized in dendritic spines (11Yuste R. Majewska A. Holthoff K. From form to function: calcium compartmentalization in dendritic spines.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), F-actin-rich synaptic structures that contain postsynaptic densities (PSDs) enriched in glutamate receptors and other signaling proteins, including CaMKIIα. CaMKIIα appears to be initially cytosolic, but Ca2+/CaM binding initiates translocation to dendritic spines; a recent study suggests that only a small fraction of CaMKII in spines is tightly associated with PSDs (12Feng B. Raghavachari S. Lisman J. Quantitative estimates of the cytoplasmic, PSD, and NMDAR-bound pools of CaMKII in dendritic spines.Brain Res. 2011; 1419: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Retention of CaMKII in the spines is modulated by autophosphorylation; Thr-286 autophosphorylation stabilizes spine localization, whereas Thr-305/6 autophosphorylation promotes CaMKII dissociation from spines (13Shen K. Meyer T. Dynamic control of CaMKII translocation and localization in hippocampal neurons by NMDA receptor stimulation.Science. 1999; 284: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). N-Methyl-d-Aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptor (NMDAR) GluN2B subunits are the most widely recognized binding partner for CaMKII; this interaction modulates CaMKII activity and is important for synaptic plasticity and memory (14Zhou Y.

GluN2B selectively binds activated CaMKII, perhaps contributing to CaMKII translocation and retention in spines. However, PSDs contain ∼20-fold more CaMKII holoenzymes than NMDAR subunits (20Cheng D. Hoogenraad C.C. Rush J. Ramm E. Schlager M.A. Duong D.M. Xu P. Wijayawardana S.R. Hanfelt J. Nakagawa T. Sheng M. Peng J.

Thus, the overall dynamics of CaMKII targeting presumably reflect integration of NMDAR interactions with CaMKII binding to several other proteins (1Colbran R.J. Targeting of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II.Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Indeed, CaMKII can simultaneously interact with α-actinin, GluN2B, and densin (21Robison A.J. Bass M.A. Jiao Y. MacMillan L.B. Carmody L.C. Bartlett R.K. Colbran R.J. Multivalent interactions of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II with the postsynaptic density proteins NR2B, densin-180, and α-actinin-2.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35329-35336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Importantly, pharmacological disruption of F-actin interferes with synaptic clustering of CaMKIIα and actin-binding proteins such as α-actinin without changes in NMDAR localization (22Allison D.W. Gelfand V.I. Spector I. Craig A.M. Role of actin in anchoring postsynaptic receptors in cultured hippocampal neurons: differential attachment of NMDA versus AMPA receptors.J.

Our previous studies defined the CTD of α-actinin-2 (A2-CTD; residues 819–894) as the minimal CaMKII binding domain (21Robison A.J. Bass M.A. Jiao Y. MacMillan L.B. Carmody L.C. Bartlett R.K.

In vitro, A2-CTD interaction with CaMKII is Ca2+-independent, competitive with Ca2+/CaM, and disrupted by Thr-305/6 autophosphorylation (18Robison A.J. Bartlett R.K. Bass M.A. Colbran R.J.

However, the mechanism and functional consequences of CaMKII interaction with full-length α-actinin are poorly understood. Here, we show that α-actinin-2 mimics CaM in binding to the CaMKII regulatory domain, and targets CaMKII to the actin cytoskeleton. In vitro and intact cell studies show that α-actinin-2 is a Ca2+-independent, substrate-selective CaMKII activator, which also enhances CaMKII interaction with NMDARs containing GluN2B subunits.

All constructs were purified using Maxi-Prep kits (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The structure of CaM bound to CaMKII regulatory domain (PDB:1CM1) was aligned with that of α-actinin-2 bound to the titin z-repeat (1H8B) using the align command of PyMOL (DeLano Scientific LLC). CaMKIIα (WT, T305A, or T306A) were purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells and sequentially autophosphorylated essentially as described (37Colbran R.J. Inactivation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II by basal autophosphorylation.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7163-7170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, CaMKIIα (5 μm subunit) was incubated on ice for 90 s with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 10 μm CaM, 2 mm DTT, and 500 μm ATP. After 90 s, 4 mm EGTA was added and reaction continued for 2 min at 30 °C before termination using 25 mm EDTA. The efficacy of autophosphorylation of each protein was verified by assessing the impact on Ca2+/CaM binding (see “Results”). Purified GST-fusion proteins or GST alone (≈250 nm full-length protein), CaMKII (WT or mutated) (≈250 nm subunit: sequentially autophosphorylated, or non-phosphorylated, as indicated) and glutathione-agarose (Sigma; 30 μl packed resin) were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h in 0.5 ml of PD buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100). After centrifugation, beads were washed with PD buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting. CaMKII bound to GST proteins was quantified using Image J from scans of Ponceau-S-stained membranes, immunoblotted membranes, or linearly exposed x-ray films, and normalized to the amount of recovered GST fusion protein (detected by Ponceau-S stain). Any background binding to GST alone was subtracted. Purified CaMKIIα (10 nm) was incubated with indicated concentrations of CaM or His6-A2-CTD in presence of 50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT and a model peptide substrate (AC-2, syntide-2, or NR2B; 100 μm each).

Data were analyzed by one-way or two-way ANOVA with the specified post-hoc tests. CaMKII activation curves were fitted to one-site binding curves using GraphPad Prism. The minimal CaMKII-binding A2-CTD (residues 819–894) (21Robison A.J. Bass M.A. Jiao Y. MacMillan L.B. Carmody L.C. Bartlett R.K. Colbran R.J.

Since the C-terminal lobe of CaM is sufficient to partially activate CaMKII in the presence of Ca2+ (39Shifman J.M. Choi M.H. Mihalas S. Mayo S.L. Kennedy M.B. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is activated by calmodulin with two bound calciums.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 13968-13973Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we tested the effects of a His6-tagged A2-CTD on CaMKII activity. We detected a concentration-dependent activation of purified CaMKIIα using a model peptide substrate, autocamtide-2 (AC-2). This activation was Ca2+-independent (−Ca2+: Vmax 1.5 ± 0.2 μmol/min/mg, Ka 8.6 ± 1.6 μm; +Ca2+: Vmax 1.3 ± 0.2 μmol/min/mg, Ka 6.7 ± 1.7 μm), whereas CaM is a Ca2+-dependent activator (+Ca2+: Vmax 6.1 ± 0.1 μmol/min/mg, Ka 97 ± 17 nm) (Fig. 1B). Moreover, Ca2+/CaM stimulated the phosphorylation of all substrates tested, whereas CaMKII activation by the A2-CTD was detected with AC-2 and GluN2B-1290–1309, but not with syntide-2 (Fig. 1C). Thus, the A2-CTD is a Ca2+-independent and substrate-selective activator of CaMKII. We hypothesized that the different affinities and maximal activation by CaM and A2-CTD reflect distinct interactions with the α-helical CaMKII regulatory domain (residues 293–310). The N- and C-terminal lobes of full-length CaM interact with both sides of this helix (40Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Modulation of calmodulin plasticity in molecular recognition on the basis of x-ray structures.Science. 1993; 262: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S2A). Interestingly, the A2-CTD interacts with a single face of a regulatory domain helix in the giant muscle protein kinase, titin (41Atkinson R.A. Joseph C. Kelly G. Muskett F.W. Frenkiel T.A. Nietlispach D. Pastore A. Ca2+-independent binding of an EF-hand domain to a novel motif in the α-actinin-titin complex.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 853-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S2B). Given the amino acid sequence similarity between the A2-CTD and the C-lobe of CaM (Fig. 1A), we aligned these two structures (supplemental Fig. S2C). The alignment (RMS 2.97 Å) predicts a hydrophobic interface between one face of the CaMKII regulatory domain helix and a concave binding “pocket” in A2-CTD formed by Ser-834, Leu-854, Tyr-861, Leu-888, and other residues (Fig. 2¶A). To test this alignment as a model for CaMKII-binding to the A2-CTD, we introduced charge in the predicted hydrophobic binding pocket. S834R, L854R, and Y861R mutations completely abrogated CaMKII binding to GST-A2-CTD, and the L888R mutation reduced binding by ≈70% (Fig. 2B). However, none of these mutations affected binding of GST-A2-CTD to the densin PDZ domain in parallel experiments (supplemental Fig. S3A). Additional mutations reduced hydrophobicity without introducing charge; L854A and Y861A mutations completely abrogated CaMKII binding (like L854R and Y861R mutations), but S834A mutation had a minimal effect (supplemental Fig. S3B). In combination, these findings support our model for CaMKII interaction with the hydrophobic binding pocket in the CTD of α-actinin-2. Ca2+-independent autophosphorylation blocks CaMKII binding to both GST-A2-CTD and Ca2+/CaM, and this loss of binding can be prevented by mutation of both Thr-305 and Thr-306 in CaMKIIα to Ala (21Robison A.J.

Our alignment model indicates that the Thr-306 side chain is buried in the A2-CTD interaction site, whereas the Thr-305 side chain is solvent exposed (Fig. 2C), suggesting that phosphorylation at Thr-306, but not Thr-305, should disrupt binding. Autophosphorylation of wild type (WT) CaMKIIα can occur at both Thr-305 and Thr-306, whereas T305A- and T306A-CaMKIIα mutants can be autophosphorylated at only one residue (Thr-306 and Thr-305, respectively) (37Colbran R.J.

https://openalex.org/W2063859000,"Uba6 is a homolog of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme, Uba1, and activates two ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs), ubiquitin and FAT10. In this study, biochemical and biophysical experiments were performed to understand the mechanisms of how Uba6 recognizes two distinct UBLs and catalyzes their activation and transfer. Uba6 is shown to undergo a three-step activation process and form a ternary complex with both UBLs, similar to what has been observed for Uba1. The catalytic mechanism of Uba6 is further supported by inhibition studies using a mechanism-based E1 inhibitor, Compound 1, which forms covalent adducts with both ubiquitin and FAT10. In addition, pre-steady state kinetic analysis revealed that the rates of UBL-adenylate (step 1) and thioester (step 2) formation are similar between ubiquitin and FAT10. However, distinct kinetic behaviors were also observed for ubiquitin and FAT10. FAT10 binds Uba6 with much higher affinity than ubiquitin while demonstrating lower catalytic activity in both ATP-PP(i) exchange and E1-E2 transthiolation assays. Also, Compound 1 is less potent with FAT10 as the UBL compared with ubiquitin in ATP-PP(i) exchange assays, and both a slow rate of covalent adduct formation and weak adduct binding to Uba6 contribute to the diminished potency observed for FAT10. Together with expression level analysis in IM-9 cells, this study sheds light on the potential role of cytokine-induced FAT10 expression in regulating Uba6 pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2089040237,"The Drosophila male accessory gland has functions similar to those of the mammalian prostate gland and the seminal vesicle, and secretes accessory gland proteins into the seminal fluid. Each of the two lobes of the accessory gland is composed of two types of binucleate cell: about 1,000 main cells and 40 secondary cells. A well-known accessory gland protein, sex peptide, is secreted from the main cells and induces female postmating response to increase progeny production, whereas little is known about physiological significance of the secondary cells. The homeodomain transcriptional repressor Defective proventriculus (Dve) is strongly expressed in adult secondary cells, and its mutation resulted in loss of secondary cells, mononucleation of main cells, and reduced size of the accessory gland. dve mutant males had low fecundity despite the presence of sex peptide, and failed to induce the female postmating responses of increased egg laying and reduced sexual receptivity. RNAi-mediated dve knockdown males also had low fecundity with normally binucleate main cells. We provide the first evidence that secondary cells are crucial for male fecundity, and also that Dve activity is required for survival of the secondary cells. These findings provide new insights into a mechanism of fertility/fecundity."
https://openalex.org/W2082170266,"Cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage are shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The occurrence of HIV type 1 (HIV-1) infection is found to be accelerated in people infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but the mechanism by which mycobacterial protein(s) induces HIV-1 LTR trans-activation is not clearly understood. We show here that the M. tuberculosis proline-proline-glutamic acid (PPE) protein Rv1168c (PPE17) can augment transcription from HIV-1 LTR in monocyte/macrophage cells. Rv1168c interacts specifically with Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2) resulting in downstream activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) resulting in HIV-1 LTR trans-activation. Another PPE protein, Rv1196 (PPE18), was also found to interact with TLR2 but had no effect on HIV-1 LTR trans-activation because of its inability to activate the NF-κB signaling pathway. In silico docking analyses and mutation experiments have revealed that the N-terminal domain of Rv1168c specifically interacts with LRR motifs 15-20 of TLR2, and this site of interaction is different from that of Rv1196 protein (LRR motifs 11-15), indicating that the site of interaction on TLR2 dictates the downstream signaling events leading to activation of NF-κB. This information may help in understanding the mechanism of pathogenesis of HIV-1 during M. tuberculosis co-infection."

In the present study, the gene expression profiles both in the GMC stimulated by sublytic C5b-9 and the rat renal tissue of Thy-1N were detected using microarrays. Among the co-up-regulated genes, the up-regulation of interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) was further confirmed. Increased caspase 8 and caspase 3 expression and caspase 8 promoter activity in the GMC were also identified. Meanwhile, overexpression or knockdown of IRF-1 not only enhanced or inhibited GMC apoptosis and caspase 8 and 3 induction but also increased or decreased caspase 8 promoter activity, respectively. The element of IRF-1 binding to the caspase 8 promoter was first revealed. Furthermore, silencing IRF-1 or repressing the activation of caspases 8 and 3 significantly reduced GMC apoptosis, including other pathologic changes of Thy-1N. These novel findings indicate that GMC apoptosis of Thy-1N is associated with the IRF-1-activated caspase 8 pathway."

We designed SVM models by selecting the variables from 38 tissue molecular biomarkers, which represent 6 tumorigenesis signaling pathways, and 3 EBV-related serological biomarkers. We designed 3 SVM models to refine prognosis of NPC with 5-year follow-up. The SVM1 displayed highly predictive sensitivity (sensitivity, specificity were 88.0% and 81.9%, respectively) by integrating the expression of 7 molecular biomarkers. The SVM2 model showed highly predictive specificity (sensitivity, specificity were 84.0% and 94.5%, respectively) by grouping the expression level of 12 molecular biomarkers and 3 EBV-related serological biomarkers. The SVM3 model, constructed by combination SVM1 with SVM2, displayed a high predictive capacity (sensitivity, specificity were 88.0% and 90.3%, respectively). We found that 3 SVM models had strong power in classification of prognosis.

Here we investigated how UCP4 affects mitochondrial bioenergetics in SH-SY5Y cells. Cells stably overexpressing UCP4 exhibited higher oxygen consumption (10.1%, p<0.01), with 20% greater proton leak than vector controls (p<0.01). Increased ATP supply was observed in UCP4-overexpressing cells compared to controls (p<0.05). Although state 4 and state 3 respiration rates of UCP4-overexpressing and control cells were similar, Complex II activity in UCP4-overexpressing cells was 30% higher (p<0.05), associated with protein binding between UCP4 and Complex II, but not that of either Complex I or IV. Mitochondrial ADP consumption by succinate-induced respiration was 26% higher in UCP4-overexpressing cells, with 20% higher ADP:O ratio (p<0.05). ADP/ATP exchange rate was not altered by UCP4 overexpression, as shown by unchanged mitochondrial ADP uptake activity. UCP4 overexpression retained normal mitochondrial morphology in situ, with similar mitochondrial membrane potential compared to controls. Our findings elucidate how UCP4 overexpression increases ATP synthesis by specifically interacting with Complex II. This highlights a unique role of UCP4 as a potential regulatory target to modulate mitochondrial Complex II and ATP output in preserving existing neurons against energy crisis."

These infections are incriminated for almost all cervical cancers. In France, 3,068 new cases of cervical cancer and 1,067 deaths from cervical cancer occurred in 2005. Two vaccines against HPV infections are currently available and vaccination policies aim to decrease the incidence of HPV infections and of cervical cancers. In France, vaccine coverage has been reported to be low. Methods We developed a dynamic model for the heterosexual transmission of Human Papillomavirus types 16 and 18, which are covered by available vaccines. A deterministic model was used with stratification on gender, age and sexual behavior. Immunity obtained from vaccination was taken into account. The model was calibrated using French data of cervical cancer incidence. Results In view of current vaccine coverage and screening, we expected a 32% and 83% reduction in the incidence of cervical cancers due to HPV 16/18, after 20 years and 50 years of vaccine introduction respectively. Vaccine coverage and screening rates were assumed to be constant. However, increasing vaccine coverage in women or vaccinating girls before 14 showed a better impact on cervical cancer incidence. On the other hand, performing vaccination in men improves the effect on cervical cancer incidence only moderately, compared to strategies in females only. Conclusion While current vaccination policies may significantly decrease cervical cancer incidence, other supplementary strategies in females could be considered in order to improve vaccination efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2153094374,"Cryptochromes are conserved flavoprotein receptors found throughout the biological kingdom with diversified roles in plant development and entrainment of the circadian clock in animals. Light perception is proposed to occur through flavin radical formation that correlates with biological activity in vivo in both plants and Drosophila. By contrast, mammalian (Type II) cryptochromes regulate the circadian clock independently of light, raising the fundamental question of whether mammalian cryptochromes have evolved entirely distinct signaling mechanisms. Here we show by developmental and transcriptome analysis that Homo sapiens cryptochrome--1 (HsCRY1) confers biological activity in transgenic expressing Drosophila in darkness, that can in some cases be further stimulated by light. In contrast to all other cryptochromes, purified recombinant HsCRY1 protein was stably isolated in the anionic radical flavin state, containing only a small proportion of oxidized flavin which could be reduced by illumination. We conclude that animal Type I and Type II cryptochromes may both have signaling mechanisms involving formation of a flavin radical signaling state, and that light independent activity of Type II cryptochromes is a consequence of dark accumulation of this redox form in vivo rather than of a fundamental difference in signaling mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2034859202,"The prediction of the correct β-sheet topology for pure β and mixed α/β proteins is a critical intermediate step toward the three dimensional protein structure prediction. The predicted beta sheet topology provides distance constraints between sequentially separated residues, which reduces the three dimensional search space for a protein structure prediction algorithm. Here, we present a novel mixed integer linear optimization based framework for the prediction of β-sheet topology in β and mixed α/β proteins. The objective is to maximize the total strand-to-strand contact potential of the protein. A large number of physical constraints are applied to provide biologically meaningful topology results. The formulation permits the creation of a rank-ordered list of preferred β-sheet arrangements. Finally, the generated topologies are re-ranked using a fully atomistic approach involving torsion angle dynamics and clustering. For a large, non-redundant data set of 2102 β and mixed α/β proteins with at least 3 strands taken from the PDB, the proposed approach provides the top 5 solutions with average precision and recall greater than 78%. Consistent results are obtained in the β-sheet topology prediction for blind targets provided during the CASP8 and CASP9 experiments, as well as for actual and predicted secondary structures.

https://openalex.org/W2068145360,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune inflammatory and destructive joint disorder that affects tens of millions of people worldwide. Normal healthy joints maintain a balance between the synthesis of extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules and the proteolytic degradation of damaged ones. In the case of RA, this balance is shifted toward matrix destruction due to increased production of cleavage enzymes and the presence of (autoimmune) immunoglobulins resulting from an inflammation induced immune response. Herein we demonstrate that a polyclonal antibody against the proteoglycan biglycan (BG) causes tissue destruction that may be analogous to that of RA affected tissues. The effect of the antibody is more potent than harsh chemical and/or enzymatic treatments designed to mimic arthritis-like fibril de-polymerization. In RA cases, the immune response to inflammation causes synovial fibroblasts, monocytes and macrophages to produce cytokines and secrete matrix remodeling enzymes, whereas B cells are stimulated to produce immunoglobulins. The specific antigen that causes the RA immune response has not yet been identified, although possible candidates have been proposed, including collagen types I and II, and proteoglycans (PG's) such as biglycan. We speculate that the initiation of RA associated tissue destruction in vivo may involve a similar non-enzymatic decomposition of collagen fibrils via the immunoglobulins themselves that we observe here ex vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2087227971,"Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) plays a dual role in hepatocytes, mediating both tumor suppressor and promoter effects. The suppressor effects of the cytokine can be negatively regulated by activation of survival signals, mostly dependent on tyrosine kinase activity. The aim of our work was to study the role of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) on the cellular responses to TGF-β, using for this purpose immortalized neonatal hepatocytes isolated from both PTP1B(+/+) and PTP1B(-/-) mice. We have found that PTP1B deficiency conferred resistance to TGF-β suppressor effects, such as apoptosis and growth inhibition, correlating with lower Smad2/Smad3 activation. Both responses were recovered in the presence of the general tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. PTP1B(-/-) cells showed elevated NF-κB activation in response to TGF-β. Knockdown of the NF-κB p65 subunit increased cell response in terms of Smads phosphorylation and apoptosis. Interestingly, these effects were accompanied by inhibition of Smad7 up-regulation. In addition, lack of PTP1B promoted an altered NADPH oxidase (NOX) expression pattern in response to TGF-β, strongly increasing the NOX1/NOX4 ratio, which was reverted by genistein and p65 knockdown. Importantly, NOX1 knockdown inhibited nuclear translocation of p65, promoted Smad phosphorylation, and decreased Smad7 levels. In summary, our results suggest that PTP1B deficiency confers resistance to TGF-β through Smad inhibition, an effect that is mediated by NOX1-dependent NF-κB activation, which in turn, increases the level of the Smad inhibitor Smad7 and participates in a positive feedback loop on NOX1 up-regulation."

Prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated in association with Pf-malaria exposure, defined at the district-level (Kisumu: holoendemic; Nandi: hypoendemic) and the individual-level. We observed a 46% decrease in positive EBV lytic antigen IFN-γ responses among 5-9 year olds residing in Kisumu compared to Nandi (PR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.30-0.99). Individual-level analysis in Kisumu revealed further impairment of EBV lytic antigen responses among 5-9 year olds consistently infected with Pf-malaria compared to those never infected. There were no observed district- or individual-level differences between Pf-malaria exposure and EBV latent antigen IFN-γ response. The gradual decrease of EBV lytic antigen but not latent antigen IFN-γ responses after primary infection suggests a specific loss in immunological control over the lytic cycle in children residing in malaria holoendemic areas, further refining our understanding of eBL etiology."
https://openalex.org/W2062480771,"Apicomplexan parasites secrete and inject into the host cell the content of specialized secretory organelles called rhoptries, which take part into critical processes such as host cell invasion and modulation of the host cell immune response. The rhoptries are structurally and functionally divided into two compartments. The apical duct contains rhoptry neck (RON) proteins that are conserved in Apicomplexa and are involved in formation of the moving junction (MJ) driving parasite invasion. The posterior bulb contains rhoptry proteins (ROPs) unique to an individual genus and, once injected in the host cell act as effector proteins to co-opt host processes and modulate parasite growth and virulence. We describe here two new RON proteins of Toxoplasma gondii, RON9 and RON10, which form a high molecular mass complex. In contrast to the other RONs described to date, this complex was not detected at the MJ during invasion and therefore was not associated to the MJ complex RON2/4/5/8. Disruptions of either RON9 or RON10 gene leads to the retention of the partner in the ER followed by subsequent degradation, suggesting that the RON9/RON10 complex formation is required for proper sorting to the rhoptries. Finally, we show that the absence of RON9/RON10 has no significant impact on the morphology of rhoptry, on the invasion and growth in fibroblasts in vitro or on virulence in vivo. The conservation of RON9 and RON10 in Coccidia and Cryptosporidia suggests a specific relation with development in intestinal epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2073561537,"A growing body of evidence demonstrates a correlation between Th2 cytokines and the development of focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Therefore, we hypothesized that GSL-1, a monoglycosylceramide from Sphingomonas ssp. with pro-Th1 activity on invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) lymphocytes, could counterbalance the Th2 profile and modulate glomerulosclerosis. Using an adriamycin(ADM)-based model of FSGS, we found that BALB/c mice presented albuminuria and glomerular degeneration in association with a Th2-like pro-fibrogenic profile; these mice also expressed a combination of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-17, TNF-α, and chemokines, such as RANTES and eotaxin. In addition, we observed a decrease in the mRNA levels of GD3 synthase, the enzyme responsible for GD3 metabolism, a glycolipid associated with podocyte physiology. GSL-1 treatment inhibited ADM-induced renal dysfunction and preserved kidney architecture, a phenomenon associated with the induction of a Th1-like response, increased levels of GD3 synthase transcripts and inhibition of pro-fibrotic transcripts and inflammatory cytokines. TGF-β analysis revealed increased levels of circulating protein and tissue transcripts in both ADM- and GSL-1-treated mice, suggesting that TGF-β could be associated with both FSGS pathology and iNKT-mediated immunosuppression; therefore, we analyzed the kidney expression of phosphorylated SMAD2/3 and SMAD7 proteins, molecules associated with the deleterious and protective effects of TGF-β, respectively. We found high levels of phosphoSMAD2/3 in ADM mice in contrast to the GSL-1 treated group in which SMAD7 expression increased. These data suggest that GSL-1 treatment modulates the downstream signaling of TGF-β through a renoprotective pathway. Finally, GSL-1 treatment at day 4, a period when proteinuria was already established, was still able to improve renal function, preserve renal structure and inhibit fibrogenic transcripts. In conclusion, our work demonstrates that the iNKT agonist GSL-1 modulates the pathogenesis of ADM-induced glomerulosclerosis and may provide an alternative approach to disease management."

We recently showed that a complex containing E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF31 and the known SF-1 corepressor DAX-1 (NR0B1) interacts with SF-1 on target promoters and represses transcription of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and aromatase (CYP19) genes. To further evaluate the role of SF-1 in the adrenal cortex and the involvement of RNF31 in SF-1-dependent pathways, we performed genome-wide gene-expression analysis of adrenocortical NCI-H295R cells where SF-1 or RNF31 had been knocked down using RNA interference. We find RNF31 to be deeply connected to cholesterol metabolism and steroid hormone synthesis, strengthening its role as an SF-1 coregulator. We also find intriguing evidence of negative crosstalk between SF-1 and both transforming growth factor (TGF) β and Wnt/β-catenin signaling. This crosstalk could be of importance for adrenogonadal development, maintenance of adrenocortical progenitor cells and the development of adrenocortical carcinoma. Finally, the SF-1 gene profile can be used to distinguish malignant from benign adrenocortical tumors, a finding that implicates SF-1 in the development of malignant adrenocortical carcinoma."

https://openalex.org/W2063175121,"Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) are human-adapted commensal bacteria that can cause a number of chronic mucosal infections, including otitis media and bronchitis. One way for these organisms to survive antibiotic therapy and cause recurrent disease is to stop replicating, as most antimicrobials target essential biosynthetic pathways. Toxin-antitoxin (TA) gene pairs have been shown to facilitate entry into a reversible bacteriostatic state. Characteristically, these operons encode a protein toxin and an antitoxin that associate following translation to form a nontoxic complex, which then binds to and regulates the cognate TA promoter. Under stressful conditions, the labile antitoxin is degraded and the complex disintegrates, freeing the stable toxin to facilitate growth arrest. How these events affected the regulation of the TA locus, as well as how the transcription of the operon was subsequently returned to its normal state upon resumption of growth, was not fully understood. Here we show that expression of the NTHi vapBC-1 TA locus is repressed by a complex of VapB-1 and VapC-1 under conditions favorable for growth, and activated by the global transactivator Factor for Inversion Stimulation (Fis) upon nutrient upshift from stationary phase. Further, we demonstrate for the first time that the VapC-1 toxin alone can bind to its cognate TA locus control region and that the presence of VapB-1 directs the binding of the VapBC-1 complex in the transcriptional regulation of vapBC-1."
https://openalex.org/W2020248837,"Leaf area index (LAI) is an important variable in the study of forest ecosystem processes, but very few studies are designed to monitor LAI and the seasonal variability in a mixed forest using non-destructive sampling. In this study, first, true LAI from May 1(st) and November 15(th) was estimated by making several calibrations to LAI as measured from the WinSCANOPY 2006 Plant Canopy Analyzer. These calibrations include a foliage element (shoot, that is considered to be a collection of needles) clumping index measured directly from the optical instrument, TRAC (Tracing Radiation and Architecture of Canopies); a needle-to-shoot area ratio obtained from shoot samples; and a woody-to-total area ratio. Second, by periodically combining true LAI (May 1(st)) with the seasonality of LAI for deciduous and coniferous species throughout the leaf-expansion season (from May to August), we estimated LAI of each investigation period in the leaf-expansion season. Third, by combining true LAI (November 15(th)) with litter trap data (both deciduous and coniferous species), we estimated LAI of each investigation period during the leaf-fall season (from September to mid-November). Finally, LAI for the entire canopy then was derived from the initial leaf expansion to the leaf fall. The results showed that LAI reached its peak with a value of 6.53 m(2) m(-2) (a corresponding value of 3.83 m(2) m(-2) from optical instrument) in early August, and the mean LAI was 4.97 m(2) m(-2) from May to November using the proposed method. The optical instrument method underestimated LAI by an average of 41.64% (SD = 6.54) throughout the whole study period compared to that estimated by the proposed method. The result of the present work implied that our method would be suitable for measuring LAI, for detecting the seasonality of LAI in a mixed forest, and for measuring LAI seasonality for each species."
https://openalex.org/W2074548762,"The present study aimed to elucidate whether the type of feedback influences the performance and the motor cortical activity when executing identical visuomotor tasks. For this purpose, time to task failure was measured during position- and force-controlled muscular contractions. Subjects received either visual feedback about the force produced by pressing a force transducer or about the actual position between thumb and index finger. Participants were instructed to either match the force level of 30% MVC or the finger position corresponding to the thumb and index finger angle at this contraction intensity. Subjects demonstrated a shorter time to task failure when they were provided with feedback about their joint position (11.5 ± 6.2 min) instead of force feedback (19.2 ± 12.8 min; P = 0.01). To test differences in motor cortical activity between position- and force-controlled contractions, subthreshold transcranial magnetic stimulation (subTMS) was applied while executing submaximal (20% MVC) contractions. SubTMS resulted in a suppression of the first dorsal interosseus muscle (FDI) EMG in both tasks. However, the mean suppression for the position-controlled task was significantly greater (18.6 ± 9.4% vs. 13.3 ± 7.5%; P = 0.025) and lasted longer (13.9 ± 7.5 ms vs. 9.3 ± 4.3 ms; P = 0.024) compared to the force-controlled task. The FDI background EMG obtained without stimulation was comparable in all conditions. The present results demonstrate that the presentation of different feedback modalities influences the time to task failure as well as the cortical activity. As only the feedback was altered but not the mechanics of the task, the present results add to the body of evidence that suggests that the central nervous system processes force and position information in different ways."
https://openalex.org/W2092657915,"The mitotic spindle is an essential molecular machine involved in cell division, whose composition has been studied extensively by detailed cellular biology, high-throughput proteomics, and RNA interference experiments. However, because of its dynamic organization and complex regulation it is difficult to obtain a complete description of its molecular composition. We have implemented an integrated computational approach to characterize novel human spindle components and have analysed in detail the individual candidates predicted to be spindle proteins, as well as the network of predicted relations connecting known and putative spindle proteins. The subsequent experimental validation of a number of predicted novel proteins confirmed not only their association with the spindle apparatus but also their role in mitosis. We found that 75% of our tested proteins are localizing to the spindle apparatus compared to a success rate of 35% when expert knowledge alone was used. We compare our results to the previously published MitoCheck study and see that our approach does validate some findings by this consortium. Further, we predict so-called “hidden spindle hub”, proteins whose network of interactions is still poorly characterised by experimental means and which are thought to influence the functionality of the mitotic spindle on a large scale. Our analyses suggest that we are still far from knowing the complete repertoire of functionally important components of the human spindle network. Combining integrated bio-computational approaches and single gene experimental follow-ups could be key to exploring the still hidden regions of the human spindle system."
https://openalex.org/W2007200931,"Our previous study has recently shown that plasma heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a stress-responsive protein, is elevated in individuals with type 2 diabetes. The current study aimed to examine the association between plasma HO-1 concentration and impaired glucose regulation (IGR) in non-diabetic individuals.We conducted a case-control study including a total of 865 subjects (262 IGR individuals and 603 healthy controls) in a Chinese population. Basic characteristics were collected by questionnaire and standardized anthropometric measurements. Plasma HO-1 concentration was determined by ELISA.Plasma HO-1 concentration was significantly increased in IGR individuals compared with healthy controls (1.34 (0.81-2.29) ng/ml vs 0.98 (0.56-1.55) ng/ml, P<0.001). After adjustment for age, sex, and BMI, the ORs for IGR in the highest quartile of plasma HO-1 concentrations, compared with the lowest, was 3.42 (95% CI 2.11-5.54; P for trend <0.001). The trend remained significant even after additional adjustment for smoking, alcohol drinking, hypertension, family history of diabetes, lipid profiles and C-reactive protein. In the receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis, addition of plasma HO-1 concentration to a model with known risk factors yielded significantly improved discriminative value for IGR (area under the curves 0.75 (95% CI 0.71-0.78) vs. 0.72 (95% CI 0.69-0.76); P for difference = 0.026).Elevated plasma HO-1 concentration is significantly associated with increased ORs for IGR. However, its clinical utility should be validated in further studies, especially in prospective cohort studies."
https://openalex.org/W2065079946,"Background Wolbachia are maternally inherited endosymbionts that infect a diverse range of invertebrates, including insects, arachnids, crustaceans and filarial nematodes. Wolbachia are responsible for causing diverse reproductive alterations in their invertebrate hosts that maximize their transmission to the next generation. Evolutionary theory suggests that due to maternal inheritance, Wolbachia should evolve toward mutualism in infected females, but strict maternal inheritance means there is no corresponding force to select for Wolbachia strains that are mutualistic in males. Methodology/Principal findings Using cohort life-table analysis, we demonstrate that in the mosquito Culex pipiens (LIN strain), Wolbachia-infected females show no fitness costs due to infection. However, Wolbachia induces up to a 30% reduction in male lifespan. Conclusions/significance These results indicate that the Wolbachia infection of the Culex pipiens LIN strain is virulent in a sex-specific manner. Under laboratory situations where mosquitoes generally mate at young ages, Wolbachia strains that reduce male survival could evolve by drift because increased mortality in older males is not a significant selective force."
https://openalex.org/W1982978891,"Serine protease inhibitors, or serpins, are a group of widely distributed proteins with similar structures that use conformational change to inhibit proteases. Antithrombin (AT) is a member of the serine protease inhibitor superfamily and a major coagulation inhibitor in all vertebrates, but its evolutionary origin remains elusive. In this study we isolated for the first time a cDNA encoding an antithrombin homolog, BjATl, from the protochordate Branchiostoma japonicum. The deduced protein BjATl consisted of 338 amino acids sharing 36.7% to 41.1% identity to known vertebrate ATs. BjATl contains a potential N-linked glycosylation site, two potential heparin binding sites and the reactive center loop with the absolutely conserved sequence Gly-Arg-Ser; all of these are features characteristic of ATs. All three phylogenetic trees constructed using Neighbor-Joining, Maximum-Likelihood and Bayesian-Inference methods also placed BjATl together with ATs. Moreover, BjATl expressed in yeast cells was able to inhibit bovine thrombin activity by forming a SDS-stable BjATl-thrombin complex. It also displays a concentration-dependent inhibition of thrombin that is accelerated by heparin. Furthermore, BjATl was predominantly expressed in the hepatic caecum and hind-gut, agreeing with the expression pattern of AT in mammalian species. All these data clearly demonstrate that BjATl is an ortholog of vertebrate ATs, suggesting that a primitive coagulation system emerged in the protochordate."
https://openalex.org/W2032210717,"The response of thin polymer gel cassettes (called NIPAM gels) to ionizing radiation was investigated in this study. The NIPAM gels were prepared from gelatin, N-isopropyl acrylamide, tetrakis (hydroxymethyl) phosphoniumchloride, and N,N′-methylene-bis-acrylamide. Gel cassettes were irradiated in a phantom using a linear accelerator, and the polymerization morphology of irradiated NIPAM gel was characterized using scanning electron microscopy. The dose-response sensitivity of the NIPAM gels was evaluated using the differences in optical densities. The optical densities were obtained using a computer-controlled CCD camera that was connected to a planar illumination source for acquisition of optical transmission images. The central axis depth dose profiles of the phantom were extracted, and a comparison with ionization chamber measurements demonstrated similarities in profiles. The sensitivity, linearity of the response, accuracy, and reproducibility of the polymer gel cassettes were acceptable. However, the profiles of the half-blocked field irradiation showed no significant dispersion in the visible region. This study also extensively investigated the spatial stability of the NIPAM gel. The results showed that the gel cassette response remains stable for up to three months after irradiation."
https://openalex.org/W2073169954,"Glycerol kinase plays a critical role in metabolism by converting glycerol to glycerol 3-phosphate in an ATP dependent reaction. In humans, glycerol kinase deficiency results in a wide range of phenotypic variability; patients can have severe metabolic and CNS abnormalities, while others possess hyperglycerolemia and glyceroluria with no other apparent phenotype. In an effort to help understand the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the phenotypic variation, we have created a Drosophila model for glycerol kinase deficiency by RNAi targeting of dGyk (CG18374) and dGK (CG7995). As expected, RNAi flies have reduced glycerol kinase RNA expression, reduced phosphorylation activity and elevated glycerol levels. Further investigation revealed these flies to be hypersensitive to fly food supplemented with glycerol. Due to the hygroscopic nature of glycerol, we predict glycerol hypersensitivity is a result of greater susceptibility to desiccation, suggesting glycerol kinase to play an important role in desiccation resistance in insects. To evaluate a role for genetic modifier loci in determining severity of the glycerol hypersensitivity observed in knockdown flies, we performed a preliminary screen of lethal transposon insertion mutant flies using a glycerol hypersensitive survivorship assay. We demonstrate that this type of screen can identify both enhancer and suppressor genetic loci of glycerol hypersensitivity. Furthermore, we found that the glycerol hypersensitivity phenotype can be enhanced or suppressed by null mutations in eye pigmentation genes. Taken together, our data suggest proteins encoded by eye pigmentation genes play an important role in desiccation resistance and that eye pigmentation genes are strong modifiers of the glycerol hypersensitive phenotype identified in our Drosophila model for glycerol kinase deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2070426400,"In Positron Emission Tomography (PET), an optimal estimate of the radioactivity concentration is obtained from the measured emission data under certain criteria. So far, all the well-known statistical reconstruction algorithms require exactly known system probability matrix a priori, and the quality of such system model largely determines the quality of the reconstructed images. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for PET image reconstruction for the real world case where the PET system model is subject to uncertainties. The method counts PET reconstruction as a regularization problem and the image estimation is achieved by means of an uncertainty weighted least squares framework. The performance of our work is evaluated with the Shepp-Logan simulated and real phantom data, which demonstrates significant improvements in image quality over the least squares reconstruction efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2077372100,"Efficient DNA replication involves coordinated interactions among DNA polymerase, multiple factors, and the DNA. From bacteriophage T4 to eukaryotes, these factors include a helicase to unwind the DNA ahead of the replication fork, a single-stranded binding protein (SSB) to bind to the ssDNA on the lagging strand, and a helicase loader that associates with the fork, helicase, and SSB. The previously reported structure of the helicase loader in the T4 system, gene product (gp)59, has revealed an N-terminal domain, which shares structural homology with the high mobility group (HMG) proteins from eukaryotic organisms. Modeling of this structure with fork DNA has suggested that the HMG-like domain could bind to the duplex DNA ahead of the fork, whereas the C-terminal portion of gp59 would provide the docking sites for helicase (T4 gp41), SSB (T4 gp32), and the ssDNA fork arms. To test this model, we have used random and targeted mutagenesis to generate mutations throughout gp59. We have assayed the ability of the mutant proteins to bind to fork, primed fork, and ssDNAs, to interact with SSB, to stimulate helicase activity, and to function in leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis. Our results provide strong biochemical support for the role of the N-terminal gp59 HMG motif in fork binding and the interaction of the C-terminal portion of gp59 with helicase and SSB. Our results also suggest that processive replication may involve the switching of gp59 between its interactions with helicase and SSB."
