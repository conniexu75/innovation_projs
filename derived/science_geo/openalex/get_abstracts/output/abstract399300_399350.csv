https://openalex.org/W2128551987,"Gene expression is a multistep process that involves the transcription, translation and turnover of messenger RNAs and proteins. Although it is one of the most fundamental processes of life, the entire cascade has never been quantified on a genome-wide scale. Here we simultaneously measured absolute mRNA and protein abundance and turnover by parallel metabolic pulse labelling for more than 5,000 genes in mammalian cells. Whereas mRNA and protein levels correlated better than previously thought, corresponding half-lives showed no correlation. Using a quantitative model we have obtained the first genome-scale prediction of synthesis rates of mRNAs and proteins. We find that the cellular abundance of proteins is predominantly controlled at the level of translation. Genes with similar combinations of mRNA and protein stability shared functional properties, indicating that half-lives evolved under energetic and dynamic constraints. Quantitative information about all stages of gene expression provides a rich resource and helps to provide a greater understanding of the underlying design principles."
https://openalex.org/W2102513649,"Adenosine receptors are G protein-coupled receptors that are found in the heart and the brain, and adenosine is the endogenous ligand for this class of transmembrane receptor. Lebon et al. present two X-ray crystal structures of a thermostabilized human adenosine A2A receptor bound to its endogenous agonist adenosine and the synthetic agonist NECA. Comparison of the agonist-bound structures of A2A receptor with the agonist-bound structures of β-adrenoceptors suggests that the contraction of the ligand binding pocket caused by the inward motion of several helices may be a common feature in the activation of all G protein-coupled receptors. Adenosine receptors and β-adrenoceptors are G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that activate intracellular G proteins on binding the agonists adenosine1 or noradrenaline2, respectively. GPCRs have similar structures consisting of seven transmembrane helices that contain well-conserved sequence motifs, indicating that they are probably activated by a common mechanism3,4. Recent structures of β-adrenoceptors highlight residues in transmembrane region 5 that initially bind specifically to agonists rather than to antagonists, indicating that these residues have an important role in agonist-induced activation of receptors5,6,7. Here we present two crystal structures of the thermostabilized human adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR-GL31) bound to its endogenous agonist adenosine and the synthetic agonist NECA. The structures represent an intermediate conformation between the inactive and active states, because they share all the features of GPCRs that are thought to be in a fully activated state, except that the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane helix 6 partially occludes the G-protein-binding site. The adenine substituent of the agonists binds in a similar fashion to the chemically related region of the inverse agonist ZM241385 (ref. 8). Both agonists contain a ribose group, not found in ZM241385, which extends deep into the ligand-binding pocket where it makes polar interactions with conserved residues in H7 (Ser 2777.42 and His 2787.43; superscripts refer to Ballesteros–Weinstein numbering9) and non-polar interactions with residues in H3. In contrast, the inverse agonist ZM241385 does not interact with any of these residues and comparison with the agonist-bound structures indicates that ZM241385 sterically prevents the conformational change in H5 and therefore it acts as an inverse agonist. Comparison of the agonist-bound structures of A2AR with the agonist-bound structures of β-adrenoceptors indicates that the contraction of the ligand-binding pocket caused by the inward motion of helices 3, 5 and 7 may be a common feature in the activation of all GPCRs."
https://openalex.org/W2056968313,"Since 1995, more than 500 exoplanets have been detected using different techniques, of which 11 were detected with gravitational microlensing. Most of these are gravitationally bound to their host stars. There is some evidence of free-floating planetary mass objects in young star-forming regions, but these objects are limited to massive objects of 3 to 15 Jupiter masses with large uncertainties in photometric mass estimates and their abundance. Here, we report the discovery of a population of unbound or distant Jupiter-mass objects, which are almost twice (1.8_{-0.8}^{+1.7}) as common as main-sequence stars, based on two years of gravitational microlensing survey observations toward the Galactic Bulge. These planetary-mass objects have no host stars that can be detected within about ten astronomical units by gravitational microlensing. However a comparison with constraints from direct imaging suggests that most of these planetary-mass objects are not bound to any host star. An abrupt change in the mass function at about a Jupiter mass favours the idea that their formation process is different from that of stars and brown dwarfs. They may have formed in proto-planetary disks and subsequently scattered into unbound or very distant orbits."

It is well documented that inflammation is an important part of the tumor microenvironment, so we investigated whether stimulation of MSCs by inflammatory cytokines would contribute to their ability to promote tumor growth. We first showed that MSCs could increase C26 colon cancer growth in mice. This growth-promoting effect was further accelerated when the MSCs were pre-stimulated by inflammatory factors IFN-γ and TNF-α. At the same time, we demonstrated that MSCs pre-stimulated by both inflammatory factors could promote tumor angiogenesis in vivo to a greater degree than untreated MSCs or MSCs pre-stimulated by either IFN-γ or TNF-α alone. A hen egg test-chorioallantoic membrane (HET-CAM) assay showed that treatment of MSC-conditioned medium can promote chorioallantoic membrane angiogenesis in vitro, especially treatment with conditioned medium of MSCs pretreated with IFN-γ and TNF-α together. This mechanism of promoting angiogenesis appears to take place via an increase in the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which itself takes place through an increase in signaling in the hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α)-dependent pathway. Inhibition of HIF-1α in MSCs by siRNA was found to effectively reduce the ability of MSC to affect the growth of colon cancer in vivo in the inflammatory microenviroment. These results indicate that MSCs stimulated by inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ and TNF-α in the tumor microenvironment express higher levels of VEGF via the HIF-1α signaling pathway and that these MSCs then enhance tumor angiogenesis, finally leading to colon cancer growth in mice.

Worldwide, more than 1 million new cases of colorectal cancer are diagnosed each year (1Tenesa A. Dunlop M.G. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2009; 10: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Colorectal cancer is the third most common malignancy and the fourth most common cause of cancer mortality (1Tenesa A. Dunlop M.G. Nat. Rev.

Inflammation is also likely to be involved in other forms of sporadic and heritable colon cancer. The molecular mechanisms by which inflammation promotes cancer development, however, are still being uncovered and may differ between colitis-associated and other forms of colorectal cancer (2Atreya I.

For these reasons (10Eriksson F. Culp W.D. Massey R. Egevad L. Garland D. Persson M.A. Pisa P. Cancer Immunol.

In contrast, newer studies have proposed that stem cells may be the direct cellular targets of the genetic alterations that lead to tumor formation and important contributors to the maintenance of human cancers (13Reya T.

The tumor microenvironment is very important with regard to the preservation and promotion of tumor growth and development. Indeed, changes occurring in the microenvironment of the progressing tumor resemble the process of chronic inflammation, which begins with ischemia followed by interstitial and cellular edema, the appearance of immune cells, and finally the growth of blood vessels (17Balkwill F. Mantovani A. Lancet. 2001; 357: 539-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6130) Google Scholar). Chronic inflammation is clearly involved in shaping the tumor microenvironment and is an important constituent thereof (18Aller M.A. Arias J.L. Nava M.P. Arias J. Exp. Biol. Med. 2004; 229: 170-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It has been well documented that tumors are generally infiltrated by inflammatory cells and inflammatory cytokines (19Chiou S.H. Sheu B.C. Chang W.C. Huang S.C. Hong-Nerng H. J. Reprod. Immunol. 2005; 67: 35-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 20Taylor R.C. Patel A. Panageas K.S. Busam K.J. Brady M.S. J. Clin. Oncol. 2007; 25: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In response to these pro-inflammatory cytokine cascades, tumor and stromal cells produce a variety of soluble mediators with wide-ranging biologic effects. Thus, cell proliferation and differentiation, matrix remodeling, blood vessel growth, and cell migration and recruitment can all be re-programmed to benefit the tumor. IFN-γ and TNF-α are important inflammatory cytokines. The role of TNF-α in driving tumor progression has been emphasized by Balkwill and co-workers (21Balkwill F.R. Ward B.G. Moodie E. Fiers W. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 4755-4758PubMed Google Scholar). Their work provides an example of how tumors usurp the normal process of inflammation to promote their own progression. It also suggests that blocking TNF-α, such as by anti-TNF-α antibodies, might be therapeutically useful (22Harrison M.L. Obermueller E. Maisey N.R. Hoare S. Edmonds K. Li N.F. Chao D. Hall K. Lee C. Timotheadou E. Charles K. Ahern R. King D.M. Eisen T. Corringham R. DeWitte M. Balkwill F. Gore M. J. Clin. Oncol. 2007; 25: 4542-4549Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).

VEGF and HIF-1α are angiogenic cytokines that regulate angiogenesis in the tumor environment. The expression of these two pro-angiogenic cytokines can indicate the ability of the tumor to form new blood vessels in cancerous tissue. In this study, we found that after being stimulated by inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α, MSCs showed a remarkable ability to accelerate tumor growth by up-regulating the expression of VEGF and significantly increasing the production of the VEGF protein, which promotes angiogenesis, providing nutrition for tumor cells. In addition, we observed that the mRNA and protein expression of HIF-1α became raised when MSCs were stimulated by the two inflammatory cytokines. The mechanism by which MSCs promote angiogenesis appears to be the increase in VEGF expression, which itself takes place through an increase in signaling in the HIF1α-dependent pathway within MSCs. Inhibition of HIF1α by siRNA in MSCs could effectively reduce the ability of MSC to affect the growth of colon cancer in vivo in the inflammatory microenviroment. Overall, this study supports the conclusion that MSCs promote tumor growth by contributing to angiogenesis in the colon cancer microenvironment. For this reason, medical practitioners should be cautious when using MSCs as part of cancer therapy. Male BALB/c mice, 9–10 weeks old, were purchased from the Shanghai Experimental Animal Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China. All mice used in this study were housed in pathogen-free conditions, and all procedures were performed in accordance with guidelines established by the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Committee on Animals. Mouse colon carcinoma cell line C26 was obtained from the Chinese Academy of Sciences Cell Bank and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin (all from Invitrogen). Cultures were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. MSCs were generated from bone marrow flushed out of the tibias and femurs of 4–6-week-old BALB/c mice. Cells were cultured in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 mg/ml of streptomycin (all from Invitrogen). Non-adherent cells were removed after 72 h, and adherent cells were maintained in media replenished every 3 days. Cells were used at the 5th to 20th passage (47Alhadlaq A. Mao J.J. Stem Cells Dev. 2004; 13: 436-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The MSCs were divided into groups and exposed to the following: 1) control MSCs: pretreated with no inflammatory cytokines; 2) IFN-γ group: pretreated with IFN-γ (20 ng/ml, PeproTech) alone; 3) TNF-α group: pretreated with TNF-α (20 ng/ml; PeproTech) alone; 4) I+T group: pretreated with TNF-α and IFN-γ together (20 ng/ml each). After incubation for 12 h, we collected MSCs for in vitro and in vivo experiments. C26 colon cancer cells and MSCs were prepared either as single-cell type suspensions (1 × 106 cells in 100 μl of PBS) or as mixtures of cells (1 × 106 C26 cells and 1 × 105 MSCs in 100 μl of PBS). Subcutaneous administration of C26 cells (alone or mixed with MSCs) was performed in the armpit areas of Balb/c mice. Mice were examined three times per week and tumor growth was evaluated by measuring the length and width of the tumor mass. The animals were euthanized and the tumors were removed at the end of the experiment. Tumor masses were weighed and analyzed by histology. MSCs were stimulated with IFN-γ (20 ng/ml) and TNF-α (20 ng/ml) for 12 h. Then the culture medium was replaced with fresh DMEM F-12. After being cultured for a further 24 h, the conditioned medium was obtained by collection and 0.22 μm filtration of the supernatant media from MSCs. Tumor tissue sections (4 μm thick) were cut and mounted on 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane-coated slides. Incubation with monoclonal anti-mouse CD34 antibody (Abbiotec, La Jolla, CA) was performed at room temperature for 1 h, after blocking endogenous peroxidase activity. Detection of the primary antibody was performed using rabbit anti-mouse antibody (DAKO A/S, Denmark) and streptavidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase complex (SABC/HRP, DAKO A/S, Denmark). The peroxidase reaction was visualized using diaminobenzidine/H2O2 (0.05% (w/v)/0.03% (v/v)). Chicken embryos hatched for 8 days were randomly divided into five groups (10 chick embryos per group). The air chambers were opened under sterile conditions, and the crust endomembrane was exposed. The normal medium (control group) and MSC-conditioned medium were daubed onto the chicken embryonic allantois. The holes were then sealed with adhesive tape sterilized by Co-60 irradiation. The air chambers were reopened when these chicken embryos had hatched until the 11th day. The allantoides were then fixed on cover slides (48Auerbach R. Kubai L. Knighton D. Folkman J. Dev. Biol. 1974; 41: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Blood vessels (BVs) were divided into two classes: bole vessels and branches on the bole vessels with vessel diameters not less than 1 mm were defined as class I BVs; branches on the bole vessels with vessel diameters less than 1 mm were defined as class II BVs (49DeFouw D.O. Rizzo V.J. Steinfeld R. Feinberg R.N. Microvasc. Res. 1989; 38: 136-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 50Rizzo V. DeFouw D.O. Microvasc. Res. 1996; 52: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The number of each order of BVs was double blindly determined by three investigators. Cells were collected to extract the total cellular mRNA using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) and 2 μg of total RNA and oligo(dT)18 primers. Two-microliter aliquots of cDNA were used for PCR amplification. Real-time PCR was performed in triplicate using the SYBR PrimeScript RT-PCR Kit (Takara, Dalian, China) and the sequence of primers listed in Table 1. Total sample RNA was normalized to endogenous β-actin mRNA. Thermocycler conditions included an initial hold at 50 °C for 2 min and then 95 °C for 10 min; this was followed by a two-step PCR program of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s repeated for 40 cycles on an Mx4000 system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), on which data were collected and quantitatively analyzed. The expression level of mRNA was presented as fold-change relative to an untreated control.TABLE 1Oligonucleotide sequences used in real-time PCR and siRNA assaysAssayGeneSequence (5′ → 3′)Real-time PCRVEGFFGGAGATCCTTCGAGGAGCACTTRGGCGATTTAGCAGCAGATATAAGAAHIF-1αFCGGCGAAGCAAAGAGTCTGAAGTRTCGCCGTCATATGTTAGCACCATβ-ActinFCTCCATCCTGGCCTCGCTGTRGCTGTCACCTTCACCGTTCCVEGF siRNASequence 1SenseCGAGATAGAGTACATCTTCAAAntisenseTTGAAGATGTACTCTATCTCGSequence 2SenseTGCGGATCAAACCTCACCAAAAntisenseTTTGGTGAGGTTTGATCCGCASequence 3SenseGATCAAGTTCATGGATGTCTAAntisenseTAGACATCCATGAACTTGATCControlSenseUUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTTAntisenseACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAATTHIF-1α siRNASequence 1SenseCCCATTCCTCATCCGTCAAATAntisenseATTTGACGGATGAGGAATGGGSequence 2SenseAGTCGACACAGCCTCGATATGAntisenseCATATCGAGGCTGTGTCGACTSequence 3SenseTGGATAGCGATATGGTCAATGAntisenseCATTGACCATATCGCTATCCAControlSenseUUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTTAntisenseACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAATT Open table in a new tab ELISA assays were performed using a commercial VEGF ELISA kit (R&D Systems). MSC- conditioned medium was collected and stored at −80 °C for further experiments. Assays were performed in duplicate, and readings were compared with standard curves obtained with standard proteins provided with the kits. Mean ± S.D. of concentrations in triplicate samples were compared by t test. Cells were washed in PBS solution, and protein was extracted according to an established protocol. Nuclear extract proteins were quantified using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Proteins were then mixed with Laemmli sample buffer, heated at 65 °C for 10 min, loaded (20 μg/sample), separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel (7.5%) electrophoresis under denaturing conditions, and electroblotted on nitrocellulose membranes. The nitrocellulose membranes were blocked by incubation in blocking buffer (1% BSA in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20), incubated with anti-HIF-1α antibody (1:500 polyclonal; Bethyl), washed, and incubated with anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000; Sigma). Signals were visualized by chemiluminescent detection. Blots were quantified using Quantity One software from Bio-Rad, and HIF-1α expression (peak intensity) was normalized to values in the control group. Equal loading of samples was verified by Coomassie Blue staining of simultaneously run gels. Gels were run four times, and the images shown are representative. Statistical analysis of the data were performed using GraphPad Prism 4 software. Student's t test was used to compare the mean values of the two groups. Data from three or more groups were compared using the one-way analysis of variance, followed by the Dunnett's post hoc test. Final values are expressed as mean ± S.E. A difference of at least p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. MSCs were isolated from mouse bone marrow and expanded. The resulting cells exhibited spindle-shaped morphology and continuous proliferation (supplemental Fig. S1A). The MSCs generated were capable of differentiating into adipocytes and osteoblast-like cells (supplemental Fig. S1, B and C). We used MSCs from the 8th passage (propagated for 6 weeks) to analyze the expression of cell surface molecules by flow cytometry and found these cells to be positive for CD90, CD105, CD166, CD44, and CD29 and negative for CD34, CD14, and CD45 (supplemental Fig. S1D). The pro-tumorigenic effects of MSCs have been demonstrated in multiple systems. Recent studies have shown that MSCs contribute to the growth of breast and ovarian cancer (25Sun B. Roh K.H. Park J.R.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 3806-3811Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The specific mechanisms by which this occurs have not yet been elucidated. To determine the effects of MSCs stimulated by inflammatory cytokines on tumor growth in mice, C26 colon cancer cells mixed with MSCs were injected subcutaneously into BALB/c mice, which served as the allograft tumor model. Subcutaneous C26 tumor-bearing mice that had not been exposed to MSCs were used as controls. The other groups were treatment groups. Tumor growth was measured after the mice were euthanized on day 18. Relative to controls, C26 cells administrated with MSCs were found to increase colon cancer growth in vivo, with MSCs pretreated by both IFN-γ and TNF-α showing the greatest tumor-promoting effects (Fig. 1A). Tumor weight was higher in all four treatment groups than in the control group (p < 0.05). No statistical difference in tumor weight was observed between the groups exposed to MSCs pretreated with IFN-γ or TNF-α and the MSC control group (p > 0.05). However, the tumors of the IFN-γ + TNF-α group were significantly more massive than those of other groups (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1B). The same results were seen for tumor volumes (Fig. 1C). Tumor progression is closely linked with microvessel formation, which is usually associated with the inflammatory microenvironment. Inflammation is an essential element in tumor microenvironment, but the role of inflammation in angiogenesis and the underlying mechanism by which it influences the process have yet to be established. Thus, we assessed the density of newly formed microvessels in tumor tissue sections via immunohistochemistry for CD34, a marker for vascular endothelial cells. Our study demonstrated that MSCs could enhance microvessel formation in tumor tissues, with MSCs pretreated with two inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IFN-γ) showing the most marked effects. As shown in Fig. 2, whereas there is no significant difference in microvessel-stimulating effect among non-treated MSCs and MSCs pretreated with single inflammatory cytokine, TNF-α, or IFN-γ (p > 0.05), the three groups showed stronger CD34 staining than the control group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, MSCs pre-stimulated by both inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α and IFN-γ, showed a striking ability to promote angiogenesis, showing three times as many new vessels than any other treatment group (p < 0.01). All the above results demonstrate that MSCs stimulated by exogenous inflammatory cytokines and MSCs in the inflammatory microenvironment have remarkable stimulating effects on tumor angiogenesis. Three days after hatching, the allantoides were fixed on cover slides, and the BVs on the slides were counted. As shown in Fig. 3, relative to the control group, the conditioned medium of MSCs pretreated with no or single inflammatory cytokines had no stimulating effects in the formation of class I BVs, but conditioned medium of MSCs pretreated with both inflammatory cytokines could significantly enhance class I BV formation (p < 0.05). All treatment groups had higher density of class II BVs than the control group (p < 0.05), with the group with both inflammatory cytokines showing the most striking effects (p < 0.01). These results indicate that, after stimulation with both TNF-α and IFN-γ, MSCs promoted angiogenesis in chicken embryonic allantois in vitro by secreting certain angiogenesis-related cytokines. As shown above, angiogenesis can be enhanced by MSCs that have been pretreated with inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α. VEGF and HIF-1α were chosen and investigated because of their known pro-angiogenic functions. The levels of mRNA expression of VEGF and HIF-1α were higher in MSCs pretreated with IFN-γ and TNF-α, either alone (p < 0.05) or in combination (p < 0.01) than in the MSC control group. mRNA levels of the double pretreatment group were almost three times higher than those of either single pretreatment group (Fig. 4, A and C). VEGF protein expression in conditioned medium of MSCs pretreated with both inflammatory cytokines was significantly elevated over that of other groups (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4B). Western blot results showed that pre-stimulation with inflammatory cytokines promoted the expression of HIF-1α in MSCs, especially in MSCs pre-stimulated with both IFN-γ and TNF-α (Fig. 4D). These findings demonstrate that, in the tumor inflammation microenvironment, MSCs might secrete VEGF and so enhance angiogenesis and accelerated tumor growth. The mechanism by which VEGF levels increase in response to inflammatory cytokines is not clear. Because HIF-1α activity and levels are influenced by cellular glucose availability and metabolism, we hypothesized that the increase in VEGF in response to IFN-γ and TNF-α might take place through a HIF-1α-dependent pathway. The above results show that IFN-γ and TNF-α can increase levels of HIF-1α. To further test this hypothesis, we measured VEGF protein levels in control or HIF-1α siRNA-transfected MSCs, which were in advance pretreated with both inflammatory cytokines. The levels of VEGF were significantly lower (Fig. 5B) when the expression of HIF-1α was inhibited by siRNA (Fig. 5A). However, HIF-1α expression did not change significantly when VEGF expression was inhibited by siRNA (Fig. 5, C and D). Overall, these results suggest that IFN-γ and TNF-α increase VEGF levels through a HIF-1α-dependent pathway. As has been shown above, the growth of C26 cells can be enhanced by MSCs pretreated with inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α. This enhancement might be correlated with angiogenesis associated with VEGF and HIF1α expressed by MSCs. The pro-angiogenic capabilities of MSC are dependent upon the expression of VEGF, which can be induced by inflammatory cytokines via a HIF-1α-dependent pathway. Therefore, we demonstrated that the stimulating effect of MSCs induced by inflammatory cytokines on C26 cancer cell growth could be inhibited by VEGF siRNA and HIF-1α siRNA (Fig. 6A). Similar results were found for tumor volume (Fig. 6, B and C). We also assessed the density of newly formed microvessels in tumor tissue sections via immunohistochemistry for CD34. Our data demonstrate that suppression of VEGF and HIF-1α expression in MSCs can reduce microvessel formation in tumor tissues (Fig. 6, D and E). These data support the idea that angiogenesis mediated by MSCs via the HIF1α-VEGF pathway play an important role in the growth of C26 colon cancer cells in vivo. It has recently been recognized that MSCs contribute to the regeneration of a wide variety of organs and to the healing of some diseases (27D'Agostino B. Sullo N. Siniscalco D. De Angelis A. Rossi F.

To clarify the utility of MSCs and avoid inappropriate use of MSCs in clinical therapy, we must fully understand the role of MSCs in the tumor microenviroment. In this study, we observed that MSCs produced and secreted pro-angiogenic cytokines such as VEGF, promoting angiogenesis and thereby contributing to colon cancer growth. In the meantime, our studies showed that the pro-angiogenic effects of MSCs were not innate but rather induced by inflammatory cytokines INF-γ and TNF-α. MSCs may be the mediators that form a link between inflammatory cytokines and cancer. INF-γ has been reported to be an important agonist to MSCs (30Krampera M. Cosmi L. Angeli R. Pasini A. Liotta F. Andreini A. Santarlasci V. Mazzinghi B. Pizzolo G. Vinante F. Romagnani P. Maggi E. Romagnani S. Annunziato F. Stem Cells. 2006; 24: 386-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). However, we found that INF-γ alone was insufficient to increase the cancer-promoting effects of MSC. TNF-α or perhaps other cytokines are required to cause MSCs to produce and secrete cytokines. It has been reported previously that IFN-γ and TNF-α synergize in the induction of gene expression in various cells (31Hattori A. Iwasaki S. Murase K. Tsujimoto M. Sato M. Hayashi K. Kohno M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 32Sekine N. Ishikawa T. Okazaki T. Hayashi M. Wollheim C.B. Fujita T. J. Cell.

Lett. 2007; 110: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), but little is known about the expression of VEGF and other pro-angiogenic factors. The mechanism of this synergy between these two cytokines is not fully understood. Only Xu (35Xu G. Zhang Y. Zhang L. Roberts A.I. Shi Y. Stem Cells. 2009; 27: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) reported that C/EBPβ is likely to be a major transcription factor for regulating this synergy. As shown under supplemental Fig. S2, the synergy of IFN-γ and TNF-α can lead to up-regulation of C/EBPβ in MSCs. But inhibition of C/EBPβ in MSCs by siRNA does not effectively down-regulate the expression of HIF-1α relative to control groups. Certainly MSCs are also activated by other pro-inflammatory cytokines. Wang et al. (36Wang Y. Crisostomo P.R. Wang M. Markel T.A. Novotny N.M. Meldrum D.R. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2008; 295: R1115-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) showed TGF-α to cause human MSCs to secrete VEGF by MEK- and PI3K- but not JNK- or ERK-dependent mechanisms. Tang et al.

Surg. 2009; 36: 644-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) discovered that MSCs overexpressing SDF-1α could promote angiogenesis. Tumor angiogenesis is a key step in tumor growth and cancer development. VEGF is one of the important angiogenic cytokines, which have not only angiogenic properties but also an autocrine ability to regulate the synthesis of multiple angiogenic proteins, including angiogenin, IL-6, IL-8, TGF-β1, and MCP-1 in multiple cells (38McClintock J.Y.

In the tumor microenvironment, hypoxia can cause some effector cells to produce HIF-1α, which is the upstream regulatory gene of VEGF (42Forooghian F. Das B. Am. J. Ophthalmol. 2007; 144: 761-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). VEGF also has been demonstrated to interact with the HIF-1α via an autocrine loop (43Takata K.

The level of VEGF and HIF-1α could directly and indirectly indicate the ability of a tumor to cause angiogenesis. In conclusion, in contrast with recent studies demonstrating that certain stem cell populations can promote or give rise to neoplastic growth (45Bhowmick N.A. Chytil A. Plieth D. Gorska A.E.

Squire J. Dirks P.B. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5821-5828PubMed Google Scholar), our findings highlight the pro-angiogenic effects of MSCs in tumor tissues. Furthermore, our studies suggest that MSCs represent a unique stromal cell population that can directly contribute to tumorigenesis, in contrast to the reported indirect effects of normal or carcinoma-associated fibroblasts. Some reports have shown that MSCs can also suppress the immune reaction and tumor cells the chance to evade immune monitoring, resulting in proliferation of tumor cells and leading to tumor metastasis and recurrence. Therefore, the pro-angiogenic effects of MSCs may not be the only but are undoubtedly one of the important ways in which cancer growth is regulated in the inflammatory environment. Overall, MSCs may exert adverse effects in certain microenvironments that involve inflammation, such as the tumor microenvironment. Thus, MSCs should be incorporated into clinical applications only with great caution. Download .doc (1.09 MB) Help with doc files"

To protect breeding adults, we require knowledge of animal movements, how movement relates to political boundaries, and our confidence in spatial analyses of movement. We used satellite tracking and a switching state-space model to determine the internesting movements of olive ridley sea turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea) (n = 18) in Central Africa during two breeding seasons (2007-08, 2008-09). These movements were analyzed in relation to current park boundaries and a proposed transboundary park between Gabon and the Republic of Congo, both created to reduce unintentional bycatch of sea turtles in marine fisheries. We additionally determined confidence intervals surrounding home range calculations. Turtles remained largely within a 30 km radius from the original nesting site before departing for distant foraging grounds. Only 44.6 percent of high-density areas were found within the current park but the proposed transboundary park would incorporate 97.6 percent of high-density areas. Though tagged individuals originated in Gabon, turtles were found in Congolese waters during greater than half of the internesting period (53.7 percent), highlighting the need for international cooperation and offering scientific support for a proposed transboundary park. This is the first comprehensive study on the internesting movements of solitary nesting olive ridley sea turtles, and it suggests the opportunity for tractable conservation measures for female nesting olive ridleys at this and other solitary nesting sites around the world. We draw from our results a framework for cost-effective protection of long-lived species using satellite telemetry as a primary tool."

https://openalex.org/W2106107652,"Sampling bias in small populations can result in a non-adaptive evolutionary phenomenon called genetic drift. By comparing the protein-coding genomes of many species, Ariel Fernández and Michael Lynch show that population-size bottlenecks allow for the appearance of mildly destabilized proteins that can subsequently be re-stabilized through new protein–protein interactions. These interactions can then evolve into meaningful biochemical pathways. Thus, although complex protein architectures and interactions may be essential contributors to phenotypic complexity, such features may initially emerge through non-adaptive mechanisms. The boundaries between prokaryotes, unicellular eukaryotes and multicellular eukaryotes are accompanied by orders-of-magnitude reductions in effective population size, with concurrent amplifications of the effects of random genetic drift and mutation1. The resultant decline in the efficiency of selection seems to be sufficient to influence a wide range of attributes at the genomic level in a non-adaptive manner2. A key remaining question concerns the extent to which variation in the power of random genetic drift is capable of influencing phylogenetic diversity at the subcellular and cellular levels2,3,4. Should this be the case, population size would have to be considered as a potential determinant of the mechanistic pathways underlying long-term phenotypic evolution. Here we demonstrate a phylogenetically broad inverse relation between the power of drift and the structural integrity of protein subunits. This leads to the hypothesis that the accumulation of mildly deleterious mutations in populations of small size induces secondary selection for protein–protein interactions that stabilize key gene functions. By this means, the complex protein architectures and interactions essential to the genesis of phenotypic diversity may initially emerge by non-adaptive mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1996241810,"The purpose of this work was to test whether brain-penetrating angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (e.g., perindopril), as opposed to non-brain-penetrating ACE inhibitors (e.g., enalapril and imidapril), may reduce the cognitive decline and brain injury in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We first compared the effect of perindopril, enalapril, and imidapril on cognitive impairment and brain injury in a mouse model of AD induced by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of amyloid-β (Aβ)₁₋₄₀. Perindopril, with significant inhibition of hippocampal ACE, significantly prevented cognitive impairment in this AD mouse model. This beneficial effect was attributed to the suppression of microglia/astrocyte activation and the attenuation of oxidative stress caused by iNOS induction and extracellular superoxide dismutase down-regulation. In contrast, neither enalapril nor imidapril prevented cognitive impairment and brain injury in this AD mouse. We next examined the protective effects of perindopril on cognitive impairment in PS2APP-transgenic mice overexpressing Aβ in the brain. Perindopril, without affecting brain Aβ deposition, significantly suppressed the increase in hippocampal ACE activity and improved cognition in PS2APP-transgenic mice, being associated with the suppression of hippocampal astrocyte activation and attenuation of superoxide. Our data demonstrated that the brain-penetrating ACE inhibitor perindopril, as compared to non-brain-penetrating ACE inhibitors, protected against cognitive impairment and brain injury in experimental AD models."

As PACAP peptides and their specific receptor PAC1 are localized in central nervous system areas affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD), this study aims to examine the role of the natural peptide PACAP as a valuable approach in AD therapy. We investigated the effect of PACAP in the brain of an AD transgenic mouse model. The long-term intranasal daily PACAP application stimulated the nonamyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and increased expression of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor and of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein. In addition, it caused a strong reduction of the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) transporter receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) mRNA level. PACAP, by activation of the somatostatin-neprilysin cascade, also enhanced expression of the Aβ-degrading enzyme neprilysin in the mouse brain. Furthermore, daily PAC1-receptor activation via PACAP resulted in an increased mRNA level of both the PAC1 receptor and its ligand PACAP. Our behavioral studies showed that long-term PACAP treatment of APP[V717I]-transgenic mice improved cognitive function in animals. Thus, nasal application of PACAP was effective, and our results indicate that PACAP could be of therapeutic value in treating AD.—Rat, D., Schmitt, U., Tippmann, F., Dewachter, I., Theunis, C., Wieczerzak, E, Postina, R., van Leuven, F., Fahrenholz, F., Kojro, E.

https://openalex.org/W2145520366,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive age-related movement disorder that results primarily from the selective loss of midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Symptoms of PD can be induced by genetic mutations or by DA neuron-specific toxins. A specific ablation of an essential factor controlling ribosomal RNA transcription, TifIa, in adult mouse DA neurons represses mTOR signaling and leads to progressive neurodegeneration and PD-like phenotype. Using an inducible Cre system in adult mice, we show here that the specific ablation of Pten in adult mouse DA neurons leads to activation of mTOR pathway and is neuroprotective in genetic (TifIa deletion) and neurotoxin-induced (MPTP or 6OHDA) mouse models of PD. Adult mice with DA neuron-specific Pten deletion exhibit elevated expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the dopamine biosynthesis pathway, associated with increased striatal dopamine content, and increased mRNA levels of Foxa2, Pitx3, En1, Nurr1, and Lmx1b—the essential factors for maintaining physiological functions of adult DA neurons. Pten deletion attenuates the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells after 6OHDA treatment, restores striatal dopamine in TifIa-knockout and MPTP-treated mice, and rescues locomotor impairments caused by TifIa loss.

https://openalex.org/W1998704567,"Iron homeostasis is highly regulated in organisms across evolutionary time scale as iron is essential for various cellular processes. In a computational screen, we identified the Yap/bZIP domain family in Candida clade genomes. Cap2/Hap43 is essential for C. albicans growth under iron-deprivation conditions and for virulence in mouse. Cap2 has an amino-terminal bipartite domain comprising a fungal-specific Hap4-like domain and a bZIP domain. Our mutational analyses showed that both the bZIP and Hap4-like domains perform critical and independent functions for growth under iron-deprivation conditions. Transcriptome analysis conducted under iron-deprivation conditions identified about 16% of the C. albicans ORFs that were differentially regulated in a Cap2-dependent manner. Microarray data also suggested that Cap2 is required to mobilize iron through multiple mechanisms; chiefly by activation of genes in three iron uptake pathways and repression of iron utilizing and iron storage genes. The expression of HAP2, HAP32, and HAP5, core components of the HAP regulatory complex was induced in a Cap2-dependent manner indicating a feed-forward loop. In a feed-back loop, Cap2 repressed the expression of Sfu1, a negative regulator of iron uptake genes. Cap2 was coimmunoprecipitated with Hap5 from cell extracts prepared from iron-deprivation conditions indicating an in vivo association. ChIP assays demonstrated Hap32-dependent recruitment of Hap5 to the promoters of FRP1 (Cap2-induced) and ACO1 (Cap2-repressed). Together our data indicates that the Cap2-HAP complex functions both as a positive and a negative regulator to maintain iron homeostasis in C. albicans."

It plays a contributory role to platelet function, although little is known about its regulation. In this study, we investigated the role of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex (mTORC)-2 in Akt regulation using the recently identified small molecule ATP competitive mTOR inhibitors PP242 and Torin1. Both PP242 and Torin1 blocked thrombin and insulin-like growth factor 1-mediated Akt Ser473 phosphorylation with an IC50 between 1 and 5 nm, whereas the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin had no effect. Interestingly, PP242 and Torin1 had no effect on Akt Thr308 phosphorylation, Akt1 activity, and phosphorylation of the Akt substrate glycogen synthase kinase 3β, indicating that Ser473 phosphorylation is not necessary for Thr308 phosphorylation and maximal Akt1 activity. In contrast, Akt2 activity was significantly reduced, concurrent with inhibition of PRAS40 phosphorylation, in the presence of PP242 and Torin1. Other signaling pathways, including phospholipase C/PKC and the MAPK pathway, were unaffected by PP242 and Torin1. Together, these results demonstrate that mTORC2 is the kinase that phosphorylates Akt Ser473 in human platelets but that this phosphorylation is dispensable for Thr308 phosphorylation and Akt1 activity."

Successful recruitment of new colonies is important for the recovery of degraded reefs following mortality events. Coral larvae require relatively uncontaminated substratum on which to metamorphose into sessile polyps, and the increasing pollution of coastal waters therefore constitutes an additional threat to reef resilience. Here we develop and analyse a model of larval metamorphosis success for two common coral species to quantify the interactive effects of water pollution (copper contamination) and SST. We identify thresholds of temperature and pollution that prevent larval metamorphosis, and evaluate synergistic interactions between these stressors. Our analyses show that halving the concentration of Cu can protect corals from the negative effects of a 2-3°C increase in SST. These results demonstrate that effective mitigation of local impacts can reduce negative effects of global stressors."
https://openalex.org/W2038103745,"Tropical Atlantic climate variability, in particular the strength and location of rainfall in the countries surrounding the tropical Atlantic, is very sensitive to changes in sea surface temperatures. New observations from the equatorial Atlantic link variations in sea surface temperature, wind and rainfall to variations in the velocity of deep equatorial jets. Cycles in the behaviour of the jets are propagated from the deep ocean to surface waters with a characteristic variability of about 4.5 years. The cyclic variability is not present at all times, but nonetheless reveals an important influence of intrinsic ocean variability on surface ocean climate, and points towards possible improvements in forecasting the state of the equatorial Atlantic Ocean. Climate variability in the tropical Atlantic Ocean is determined by large-scale ocean–atmosphere interactions, which particularly affect deep atmospheric convection over the ocean and surrounding continents1. Apart from influences from the Pacific El Niño/Southern Oscillation2 and the North Atlantic Oscillation3, the tropical Atlantic variability is thought to be dominated by two distinct ocean–atmosphere coupled modes of variability that are characterized by meridional4,5 and zonal6,7 sea-surface-temperature gradients and are mainly active on decadal and interannual timescales, respectively8,9. Here we report evidence that the intrinsic ocean dynamics of the deep equatorial Atlantic can also affect sea surface temperature, wind and rainfall in the tropical Atlantic region and constitutes a 4.5-yr climate cycle. Specifically, vertically alternating deep zonal jets of short vertical wavelength with a period of about 4.5 yr and amplitudes of more than 10 cm s−1 are observed, in the deep Atlantic, to propagate their energy upwards, towards the surface10,11. They are linked, at the sea surface, to equatorial zonal current anomalies and eastern Atlantic temperature anomalies that have amplitudes of about 6 cm s−1 and 0.4 °C, respectively, and are associated with distinct wind and rainfall patterns. Although deep jets are also observed in the Pacific12 and Indian13 oceans, only the Atlantic deep jets seem to oscillate on interannual timescales. Our knowledge of the persistence and regularity of these jets is limited by the availability of high-quality data. Despite this caveat, the oscillatory behaviour can still be used to improve predictions of sea surface temperature in the tropical Atlantic. Deep-jet generation and upward energy transmission through the Equatorial Undercurrent warrant further theoretical study."

Neonatal diabetes mellitus is a monogenic disorder with primary alterations in insulin secretion. We here describe a key biochemical mechanism that underlies neonatal diabetes mellitus insulin biosynthesis impairment, namely a homozygous mutation within the insulin gene (INS) promoter, c.-331C>G, which affects a novel KLF-binding site. The combination of careful expression profiling, electromobility shift assays, reporter experiments, and chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrates that, among 16 different KLF proteins tested, KLF11 is the most reliable activator of this site. Congruently, the c.-331C>G INS mutation fails to bind KLF11, thus inhibiting activation by this transcription factor. Klf11(-/-) mice recapitulate the disruption in insulin production and blood levels observed in patients. Thus, these data demonstrate an important role for KLF11 in the regulation of INS transcription via the novel c.-331 KLF site. Lastly, our screening data raised the possibility that other members of the KLF family may also regulate this promoter under distinct, yet unidentified, cellular contexts. Collectively, this study underscores a key role for KLF proteins in biochemical mechanisms of human diseases, in particular, early infancy onset diabetes mellitus."

We found that Usp18 depletion elevates miR-7 levels in several cancer cell lines because of a transcriptional activation and/or mRNA stabilization of miR-7 host genes and that miR-7 acts downstream of Usp18 to regulate EGFR mRNA translation via the 3'-UTR. Also, depletion of Usp18 led to a decrease in protein levels of other known oncogenic targets of miR-7, reduced cell proliferation and soft agar colony formation, and increased apoptosis. Notably, all of these phenotypes were reversed by a specific inhibitor of miR-7. Thus, our findings support a model in which Usp18 inhibition promotes up-regulation of miR-7, which in turn inhibits EGFR expression and the tumorigenic activity of cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2165821704,"Background The pathogenesis of insulin resistance in the absence of obesity is unknown. In obesity, multiple stress kinases have been identified that impair the insulin signaling pathway via serine phosphorylation of key second messenger proteins. These stress kinases are activated through various mechanisms related to lipid oversupply locally in insulin target tissues and in various adipose depots. Methodology/Principal Findings To explore whether specific stress kinases that have been implicated in the insulin resistance of obesity are potentially contributing to insulin resistance in non-obese individuals, twenty healthy, non-obese, normoglycemic subjects identified as insulin sensitive or resistant were studied. Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies obtained during euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic clamp were evaluated for insulin signaling and for activation of stress kinase pathways. Total and regional adipose stores and intramyocellular lipids (IMCL) were assessed by DXA, MRI and 1H-MRS. In muscle of resistant subjects, phosphorylation of JNK was increased (1.36±0.23 vs. 0.78±0.10 OD units, P<0.05), while there was no evidence for activation of p38 MAPK or IKKβ. IRS-1 serine phosphorylation was increased (1.30±0.09 vs. 0.22±0.03 OD units, P<0.005) while insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation decreased (10.97±0.95 vs. 0.89±0.50 OD units, P<0.005). IMCL levels were twice as high in insulin resistant subjects (3.26±0.48 vs. 1.58±0.35% H2O peak, P<0.05), who also displayed increased total fat and abdominal fat when compared to insulin sensitive controls. Conclusions This is the first report demonstrating that insulin resistance in non-obese, normoglycemic subjects is associated with activation of the JNK pathway related to increased IMCL and higher total body and abdominal adipose stores. While JNK activation is consistent with a primary impact of muscle lipid accumulation on metabolic stress, further work is necessary to determine the relative contributions of the various mediators of impaired insulin signaling in this population."
https://openalex.org/W2014991904,"Eukaryotic H ferritins move iron through protein cages to form biologically required, iron mineral concentrates. The biominerals are synthesized during protein-based Fe²⁺/O₂ oxidoreduction and formation of [Fe³⁺O](n) multimers within the protein cage, en route to the cavity, at sites distributed over ~50 Å. Recent NMR and Co²⁺-protein x-ray diffraction (XRD) studies identified the entire iron path and new metal-protein interactions: (i) lines of metal ions in 8 Fe²⁺ ion entry channels with three-way metal distribution points at channel exits and (ii) interior Fe³⁺O nucleation channels. To obtain functional information on the newly identified metal-protein interactions, we analyzed effects of amino acid substitution on formation of the earliest catalytic intermediate (diferric peroxo-A(650 nm)) and on mineral growth (Fe³⁺O-A(350 nm)), in A26S, V42G, D127A, E130A, and T149C. The results show that all of the residues influenced catalysis significantly (p < 0.01), with effects on four functions: (i) Fe²⁺ access/selectivity to the active sites (Glu¹³⁰), (ii) distribution of Fe²⁺ to each of the three active sites near each ion channel (Asp¹²⁷), (iii) product (diferric oxo) release into the Fe³⁺O nucleation channels (Ala²⁶), and (iv) [Fe³⁺O](n) transit through subunits (Val⁴², Thr¹⁴⁹). Synthesis of ferritin biominerals depends on residues along the entire length of H subunits from Fe²⁺ substrate entry at 3-fold cage axes at one subunit end through active sites and nucleation channels, at the other subunit end, inside the cage at 4-fold cage axes. Ferritin subunit-subunit geometry contributes to mineral order and explains the physiological impact of ferritin H and L subunits."

The treatment of a hemocyte cell line with a recombinant Trol protein containing the amino acid sequence RGD augmented the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase, a hallmark of integrin activation. A loss of integrin βν, one of the two β subunits of Drosophila integrin, brought about a reduction in the level of apoptotic cell clearance in embryos. The presence of integrin βν at the surface of embryonic hemocytes was confirmed, and forced expression of integrin βν in hemocytes of an integrin βν-lacking fly line recovered the defective phenotype of phagocytosis. Finally, the level of phagocytosis in a fly line that lacks both integrin βν and Draper, another receptor required for the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, was lower than that in a fly line lacking either protein.

However, the other receptor presumably conserved among species remains to be identified. Recently, two membrane proteins, Frizzled (16Cabello J. Neukomm L.J. Günesdogan U. Burkart K. Charette S.J.

Biol. 2010; 20: 477-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), were reported to be involved in phagocytosis in C. elegans, and they are strong candidates for the “second” receptor.We and other investigators previously showed that Draper, a Drosophila homologue of CED-1, is responsible for the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by hemocytes and glia (12Freeman M.R.

Science. 1999; 284: 1991-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) has identified a phagocytosis receptor called Croquemort, but this receptor has no structural similarity to Frizzled or INA-1. To search for the second receptor in Drosophila, we decided to employ a comprehensive strategy. In the present study, we screened a series of monoclonal antibodies that had been raised against larval hemocytes for effects on phagocytosis and found integrin as a likely candidate.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we identified Trol, a core protein of proteoglycan, and integrin βν, a β subunit of integrin, as components required for Drosophila phagocytes to achieve effective phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. The involvement of integrin in the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells has been known for mammals; integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5 serve as a receptor for milk fat globule EGF factor 8, which binds on one side to integrin via the RGD motif and on the other side to phosphatidylserine exposed at the surface of apoptotic cells (37Hanayama R. Tanaka M. Miwa K. Shinohara A. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 2002; 417: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). Trol or Trol-containing proteoglycan might serve to connect apoptotic cells and Drosophila hemocytes, although the binding of Trol to apoptotic cells remains to be shown. Recently, INA-1, an α subunit of C. elegans integrin, was reported to be responsible for the phagocytosis of cell corpses (17Hsu T.Y. Wu Y.C. Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 477-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It is thus most probable that integrin is an evolutionally conserved receptor for the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, and our finding has filled in a blank for insects.The two partly overlapping pathways for the induction of phagocytosis in C. elegans are presumably conserved among species (9Lettre G. Hengartner M.O. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 38Kinchen J.M. Ravichandran K.S. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Mammalian integrin αvβ5 (39Akakura S. Singh S. Spataro M. Akakura R. Kim J.I. Albert M.L. Birge R.B. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 292: 403-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and nematode INA-1 (17Hsu T.Y. Wu Y.C. Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 477-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) were shown to connect with a pathway consisting of CrkII-DOCK180-ELMO-Rac1 for mammals and CED-2-CED-5-CED-12-CED-10 for C. elegans. Our data indicated an independent action of integrin βν from Draper that activates the pathway Ced-6-Rac1/Rac2 corresponding to CED-6-CED-10 of C. elegans (18Kuraishi T. Nakagawa Y. Nagaosa K. Hashimoto Y. Ishimoto T. Moki T. Fujita Y. Nakayama H. Dohmae N. Shiratsuchi A. Yamamoto N. Ueda K. Yamaguchi M. Awasaki T. Nakanishi Y. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 3868-3878Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), suggesting that integrin βν is located upstream of the other pathway. However, it is unclear whether a presumed pathway in Drosophila, Crk-Mbc-Elmo-Rac1/Rac2, lies downstream of integrin βν because the involvement of this pathway itself in the phagocytosis by Drosophila phagocytes still remains ambiguous. The situation becomes more complicated when we consider how phagocytes recognize apoptotic cells through the actions of the two presumed receptors. In mammals, milk fat globule EGF factor 8 is simultaneously bound by integrin and phosphatidylserine to connect phagocytes and apoptotic cells. A similar bridging protein was recently found in C. elegans (40Wang X. Li W. Zhao D. Liu B. Shi Y. Chen B. Yang H. Guo P. Geng X. Shang Z. Peden E. Kage-Nakadai E. Mitani S. Xue D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This protein, called TTR-52, binds to phosphatidylserine but seemingly serves as a ligand for CED-1, not INA-1. In addition, phosphatidylserine-binding phagocytosis receptors in mammals seem to activate either of the two conserved pathways (41Park S.Y. Kang K.B. Thapa N. Kim S.Y. Lee S.J. Kim I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10593-10600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 42Park D. Tosello-Trampont A.C. Elliott M.R. Lu M. Haney L.B. Ma Z. Klibanov A.L. Mandell J.W. Ravichandran K.S. Nature. 2007; 450: 430-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). It is thus likely that utilization of the two pathways is defined not by markers but by receptors for phagocytosis. On the other hand, the binding of Trol seemed to activate integrin and increase the level of FAK phosphorylation. The requirement of FAK has been shown for mammals in the integrin αvβ5-mediated phagocytosis of apoptotic cells (43Wu Y. Singh S. Georgescu M.M. Birge R.B. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 539-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) or spent photoreceptor outer segment fragments (44Finnemann S.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4143-4154Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and for insects in the integrin-mediated phagocytosis of bacteria (45Metheniti A. Paraskevopoulou N. Lambropoulou M. Marmaras V.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 496: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that phosphorylated FAK is included in a signaling pathway activated by integrin βν, although INA-1 does not seem to need FAK to induce phagocytosis (17Hsu T.Y. Wu Y.C. Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 477-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The intracellular region of β subunits contains the amino acid sequence NPXY that is bound by the cytoskeleton protein talin (46Dupuy A.G. Caron E. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 1773-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and this binding is believed essential for the activation of integrin. It is therefore worth knowing whether talin interacts with signal mediators of the engulfment pathways, although there is a report that the activation of integrin β5 in the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells occurs independent of the NPXY motif (47Singh S. D'mello V. van Bergen en Henegouwen P. Birge R.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 364: 540-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).More issues remain to be clarified regarding how integrin βν acts to induce the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by Drosophila hemocytes. A Trol protein containing the RGD motif bound to the surface of l(2)mbn cells (Fig. 2B), but direct interaction between this protein and a protein corresponding to the extracellular region of integrin βν was not observed (data not shown). This suggests that integrin βν needs to form a heterodimer with an α subunit to bind Trol. It is necessary to find which of five Drosophila α subunits forms a complex and cooperates with integrin βν. In addition, the fact that a significant level of phagocytosis exists in embryos lacking both Draper and integrin βν indicates the presence of other mechanisms for the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells in Drosophila. Finally, our data showed that a loss of both Draper and integrin βν caused a delay in eclosion. This suggests the involvement of the phagocytic removal of apoptotic cells in the development of Drosophila.

However, the other receptor presumably conserved among species remains to be identified. Recently, two membrane proteins, Frizzled (16Cabello J. Neukomm L.J. Günesdogan U. Burkart K. Charette S.J.

Biol. 2010; 20: 477-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), were reported to be involved in phagocytosis in C. elegans, and they are strong candidates for the “second” receptor. We and other investigators previously showed that Draper, a Drosophila homologue of CED-1, is responsible for the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by hemocytes and glia (12Freeman M.R. Delrow J. Kim J. Johnson E. Doe C.Q. Neuron. 2003; 38: 567-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 13Manaka J. Kuraishi T. Shiratsuchi A. Nakai Y. Higashida H. Henson P.

A loss of Draper expression decreased the level of phagocytosis in embryos by only about one-third (18Kuraishi T. Nakagawa Y. Nagaosa K. Hashimoto Y. Ishimoto T. Moki T. Fujita Y. Nakayama H.

EMBO J. 2009; 28: 3868-3878Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of another mechanism of phagocytosis, presumably one involving the second receptor. A pioneer study of Franc et al. (19Franc N.C. Dimarcq J.L. Lagueux M. Hoffmann J. Ezekowitz R.A.

Science. 1999; 284: 1991-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) has identified a phagocytosis receptor called Croquemort, but this receptor has no structural similarity to Frizzled or INA-1. To search for the second receptor in Drosophila, we decided to employ a comprehensive strategy. In the present study, we screened a series of monoclonal antibodies that had been raised against larval hemocytes for effects on phagocytosis and found integrin as a likely candidate. DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we identified Trol, a core protein of proteoglycan, and integrin βν, a β subunit of integrin, as components required for Drosophila phagocytes to achieve effective phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. The involvement of integrin in the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells has been known for mammals; integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5 serve as a receptor for milk fat globule EGF factor 8, which binds on one side to integrin via the RGD motif and on the other side to phosphatidylserine exposed at the surface of apoptotic cells (37Hanayama R. Tanaka M. Miwa K. Shinohara A. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 2002; 417: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). Trol or Trol-containing proteoglycan might serve to connect apoptotic cells and Drosophila hemocytes, although the binding of Trol to apoptotic cells remains to be shown. Recently, INA-1, an α subunit of C. elegans integrin, was reported to be responsible for the phagocytosis of cell corpses (17Hsu T.Y. Wu Y.C. Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 477-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It is thus most probable that integrin is an evolutionally conserved receptor for the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, and our finding has filled in a blank for insects.The two partly overlapping pathways for the induction of phagocytosis in C. elegans are presumably conserved among species (9Lettre G. Hengartner M.O. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 38Kinchen J.M. Ravichandran K.S. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Mammalian integrin αvβ5 (39Akakura S. Singh S. Spataro M. Akakura R. Kim J.I. Albert M.L. Birge R.B. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 292: 403-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and nematode INA-1 (17Hsu T.Y. Wu Y.C. Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 477-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) were shown to connect with a pathway consisting of CrkII-DOCK180-ELMO-Rac1 for mammals and CED-2-CED-5-CED-12-CED-10 for C. elegans. Our data indicated an independent action of integrin βν from Draper that activates the pathway Ced-6-Rac1/Rac2 corresponding to CED-6-CED-10 of C. elegans (18Kuraishi T. Nakagawa Y. Nagaosa K. Hashimoto Y. Ishimoto T. Moki T. Fujita Y. Nakayama H. Dohmae N. Shiratsuchi A. Yamamoto N. Ueda K. Yamaguchi M. Awasaki T. Nakanishi Y. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 3868-3878Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), suggesting that integrin βν is located upstream of the other pathway. However, it is unclear whether a presumed pathway in Drosophila, Crk-Mbc-Elmo-Rac1/Rac2, lies downstream of integrin βν because the involvement of this pathway itself in the phagocytosis by Drosophila phagocytes still remains ambiguous. The situation becomes more complicated when we consider how phagocytes recognize apoptotic cells through the actions of the two presumed receptors. In mammals, milk fat globule EGF factor 8 is simultaneously bound by integrin and phosphatidylserine to connect phagocytes and apoptotic cells. A similar bridging protein was recently found in C. elegans (40Wang X. Li W. Zhao D. Liu B. Shi Y. Chen B. Yang H. Guo P. Geng X. Shang Z. Peden E. Kage-Nakadai E. Mitani S. Xue D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This protein, called TTR-52, binds to phosphatidylserine but seemingly serves as a ligand for CED-1, not INA-1. In addition, phosphatidylserine-binding phagocytosis receptors in mammals seem to activate either of the two conserved pathways (41Park S.Y. Kang K.B. Thapa N. Kim S.Y. Lee S.J. Kim I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10593-10600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 42Park D. Tosello-Trampont A.C. Elliott M.R. Lu M. Haney L.B. Ma Z. Klibanov A.L. Mandell J.W. Ravichandran K.S. Nature. 2007; 450: 430-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). It is thus likely that utilization of the two pathways is defined not by markers but by receptors for phagocytosis. On the other hand, the binding of Trol seemed to activate integrin and increase the level of FAK phosphorylation. The requirement of FAK has been shown for mammals in the integrin αvβ5-mediated phagocytosis of apoptotic cells (43Wu Y. Singh S. Georgescu M.M. Birge R.B. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 539-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) or spent photoreceptor outer segment fragments (44Finnemann S.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4143-4154Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and for insects in the integrin-mediated phagocytosis of bacteria (45Metheniti A. Paraskevopoulou N. Lambropoulou M. Marmaras V.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 496: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that phosphorylated FAK is included in a signaling pathway activated by integrin βν, although INA-1 does not seem to need FAK to induce phagocytosis (17Hsu T.Y. Wu Y.C. Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 477-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The intracellular region of β subunits contains the amino acid sequence NPXY that is bound by the cytoskeleton protein talin (46Dupuy A.G. Caron E. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 1773-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and this binding is believed essential for the activation of integrin. It is therefore worth knowing whether talin interacts with signal mediators of the engulfment pathways, although there is a report that the activation of integrin β5 in the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells occurs independent of the NPXY motif (47Singh S. D'mello V. van Bergen en Henegouwen P. Birge R.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 364: 540-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).More issues remain to be clarified regarding how integrin βν acts to induce the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by Drosophila hemocytes. A Trol protein containing the RGD motif bound to the surface of l(2)mbn cells (Fig. 2B), but direct interaction between this protein and a protein corresponding to the extracellular region of integrin βν was not observed (data not shown). This suggests that integrin βν needs to form a heterodimer with an α subunit to bind Trol. It is necessary to find which of five Drosophila α subunits forms a complex and cooperates with integrin βν. In addition, the fact that a significant level of phagocytosis exists in embryos lacking both Draper and integrin βν indicates the presence of other mechanisms for the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells in Drosophila. Finally, our data showed that a loss of both Draper and integrin βν caused a delay in eclosion. This suggests the involvement of the phagocytic removal of apoptotic cells in the development of Drosophila.

https://openalex.org/W1971164195,"Photosystem II (PSII) is a large membrane bound molecular machine that catalyzes light-driven oxygen evolution from water. PSII constantly undergoes assembly and disassembly because of the unavoidable damage that results from its normal photochemistry. Thus, under physiological conditions, in addition to the active PSII complexes, there are always PSII subpopulations incompetent of oxygen evolution, but are in the process of undergoing elaborate biogenesis and repair. These transient complexes are difficult to characterize because of their low abundance, structural heterogeneity, and thermodynamic instability. In this study, we show that a genetically tagged Psb27 protein allows for the biochemical purification of two monomeric PSII assembly intermediates, one with an unprocessed form of D1 (His27ΔctpAPSII) and a second one with a mature form of D1 (His27PSII). Both forms were capable of light-induced charge separation, but unable to photooxidize water, largely because of the absence of a functional tetramanganese cluster. Unexpectedly, there was a significant amount of the extrinsic lumenal PsbO protein in the His27PSII, but not in the His27ΔctpAPSII complex. In contrast, two other lumenal proteins, PsbU and PsbV, were absent in both of these PSII intermediate complexes. Additionally, the only cytoplasmic extrinsic protein, Psb28 was detected in His27PSII complex. Based on these data, we have presented a refined model of PSII biogenesis, illustrating an important role of Psb27 as a gate-keeper during the complex assembly process of the oxygen-evolving centers in PSII."

PDIMs and PGLs are important effectors of virulence. Elucidation of the biosynthesis of these complex lipids will not only expand our understanding of mycobacterial cell wall biosynthesis, but it may also illuminate potential routes to novel therapeutics against mycobacterial infections. We report the construction of an in-frame deletion mutant of tesA (encoding a type II thioesterase) in the opportunistic human pathogen Mycobacterium marinum and the characterization of this mutant and its corresponding complemented strain control in terms of PDIM and PGL production. The growth and antibiotic susceptibility of these strains were also probed and compared with the parental wild-type strain. We show that deletion of tesA leads to a mutant that produces only traces of PDIMs and PGLs, has a slight growth yield increase and displays a substantial hypersusceptibility to several antibiotics. We also provide a robust model for the three-dimensional structure of M. marinum TesA (TesAmm) and demonstrate that a Ser-to-Ala substitution in the predicted catalytic Ser of TesAmm renders a mutant that recapitulates the phenotype of the tesA deletion mutant. Overall, our studies demonstrate a critical role for tesA in mycobacterial biology, advance our understanding of the biosynthesis of an important group of polyketide synthase-derived mycobacterial lipids, and suggest that drugs aimed at blocking PDIM and/or PGL production might synergize with antibiotic therapy in the control of mycobacterial infections.

https://openalex.org/W2153124929,"As next-generation sequence (NGS) production continues to increase, analysis is becoming a significant bottleneck. However, in situations where information is required only for specific sequence variants, it is not necessary to assemble or align whole genome data sets in their entirety. Rather, NGS data sets can be mined for the presence of sequence variants of interest by localized assembly, which is a faster, easier, and more accurate approach. We present TASR, a streamlined assembler that interrogates very large NGS data sets for the presence of specific variants by only considering reads within the sequence space of input target sequences provided by the user. The NGS data set is searched for reads with an exact match to all possible short words within the target sequence, and these reads are then assembled stringently to generate a consensus of the target and flanking sequence. Typically, variants of a particular locus are provided as different target sequences, and the presence of the variant in the data set being interrogated is revealed by a successful assembly outcome. However, TASR can also be used to find unknown sequences that flank a given target. We demonstrate that TASR has utility in finding or confirming genomic mutations, polymorphisms, fusions and integration events. Targeted assembly is a powerful method for interrogating large data sets for the presence of sequence variants of interest. TASR is a fast, flexible and easy to use tool for targeted assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2146561813,"The disease-associated prion protein (PrPTSE), the probable etiological agent of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), is resistant to degradation and can persist in the environment. Lichens, mutualistic symbioses containing fungi, algae, bacteria and occasionally cyanobacteria, are ubiquitous in the environment and have evolved unique biological activities allowing their survival in challenging ecological niches. We investigated PrPTSE inactivation by lichens and found acetone extracts of three lichen species (Parmelia sulcata, Cladonia rangiferina and Lobaria pulmonaria) have the ability to degrade prion protein (PrP) from TSE-infected hamsters, mice and deer. Immunoblots measuring PrP levels and protein misfolding cyclic amplification indicated at least two logs of reductions in PrPTSE. Degradative activity was not found in closely related lichen species or in algae or a cyanobacterium that inhabit lichens. Degradation was blocked by Pefabloc SC, a serine protease inhibitor, but not inhibitors of other proteases or enzymes. Additionally, we found that PrP levels in PrPTSE-enriched preps or infected brain homogenates are also reduced following exposure to freshly-collected P. sulcata or an aqueous extract of the lichen. Our findings indicate that these lichen extracts efficiently degrade PrPTSE and suggest that some lichens could have potential to inactivate TSE infectivity on the landscape or be a source for agents to degrade prions. Further work to clone and characterize the protease, assess its effect on TSE infectivity and determine which organism or organisms present in lichens produce or influence the protease activity is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2114167187,"Recent research on ecological networks suggests that mutualistic networks are more nested than antagonistic ones and, as a result, they are more robust against chains of extinctions caused by disturbances. We evaluate whether mutualistic networks are more nested than comensalistic and antagonistic networks, and whether highly nested, host-epiphyte comensalistic networks fit the prediction of high robustness against disturbance. A review of 59 networks including mutualistic, antagonistic and comensalistic relationships showed that comensalistic networks are significantly more nested than antagonistic and mutualistic networks, which did not differ between themselves. Epiphyte-host networks from old-growth forests differed from those from disturbed forest in several topological parameters based on both qualitative and quantitative matrices. Network robustness increased with network size, but the slope of this relationship varied with nestedness and connectance. Our results indicate that interaction networks show complex responses to disturbances, which influence their topology and indirectly affect their robustness against species extinctions."
https://openalex.org/W2131643056,"Somatic hypermutation diversifies antibody binding sites by introducing point mutations in the variable domains of rearranged immunoglobulin genes. In this study, we analyzed somatic hypermutation in variable heavy-chain (VH) domains of specific IgM antibodies of the urodele amphibian Pleurodeles waltl, immunized either on Earth or onboard the Mir space station. To detect somatic hypermutation, we aligned the variable domains of IgM heavy-chain transcripts with the corresponding VH gene. We also quantified NF-κB and activation-induced cytidine deaminase transcripts. Results were compared with those obtained using control animals immunized on Earth. Our data show that, as in most species of ectotherms, somatic hypermutation in P. waltl exhibits a mutational bias toward G and C bases. Furthermore, we show for the first time that somatic hypermutation occurs in space following immunization but at a lower frequency. This decrease is not due to a decrease in food intake or of the B-cell receptor/antigen interaction or to the absence of the germinal center-associated nuclear protein. It likely results from the combination of several spaceflight-associated changes, such as the severe reduction in T-cell activation, important perturbations of the cytoskeleton, and changes in the distribution of lymphocyte subpopulations and adhesion molecule expression."
https://openalex.org/W2073374655,"Growth hormone (GH) stimulates growth plate chondrogenesis and longitudinal bone growth with its stimulatory effects primarily mediated by insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) both systemically and locally in the growth plate. It has been shown that the transcription factor Stat5b mediates the GH promoting effect on IGF-1 expression and on chondrogenesis, yet it is not known whether other signaling molecules are activated by GH in growth plate chondrocytes. We have previously demonstrated that nuclear factor-κB p65 is a transcription factor expressed in growth plate chondrocytes where it facilitates chondrogenesis. We have also shown that fibroblasts isolated from a patient with growth failure and a heterozygous mutation of inhibitor-κBα (IκB; component of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway) exhibit GH insensitivity. In this study, we cultured rat metatarsal bones in the presence of GH and/or pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), a known NF-κB inhibitor. The GH-mediated stimulation of metatarsal longitudinal growth and growth plate chondrogenesis was neutralized by PDTC. In cultured chondrocytes isolated from rat metatarsal growth plates, GH induced NF-κB-DNA binding and chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation and prevented chondrocyte apoptosis. The inhibition of NF-κB p65 expression and activity (by NF-κB p65 siRNA and PDTC, respectively) in chondrocytes reversed the GH-mediated effects on chondrocyte proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Lastly, the inhibition of Stat5b expression in chondrocytes prevented the GH promoting effects on NF-κB-DNA binding, whereas the inhibition of NF-κB p65 expression or activity prevented the GH-dependent activation of IGF-1 and bone morphogenetic protein-2 expression.

In cultured chondrocytes isolated from rat metatarsal growth plates, GH induced NF-κB-DNA binding and chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation and prevented chondrocyte apoptosis. The inhibition of NF-κB p65 expression and activity (by NF-κB p65 siRNA and PDTC, respectively) in chondrocytes reversed the GH-mediated effects on chondrocyte proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Lastly, the inhibition of Stat5b expression in chondrocytes prevented the GH promoting effects on NF-κB-DNA binding, whereas the inhibition of NF-κB p65 expression or activity prevented the GH-dependent activation of IGF-1 and bone morphogenetic protein-2 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2147182901,"NAD+ is both a co-enzyme for hydride transfer enzymes and a substrate of sirtuins and other NAD+ consuming enzymes. NAD+ biosynthesis is required for two different regimens that extend lifespan in yeast. NAD+ is synthesized from tryptophan and the three vitamin precursors of NAD+: nicotinic acid, nicotinamide and nicotinamide riboside. Supplementation of yeast cells with NAD+ precursors increases intracellular NAD+ levels and extends replicative lifespan. Here we show that both nicotinamide riboside and nicotinic acid are not only vitamins but are also exported metabolites. We found that the deletion of the nicotinamide riboside transporter, Nrt1, leads to increased export of nicotinamide riboside. This discovery was exploited to engineer a strain to produce high levels of extracellular nicotinamide riboside, which was recovered in purified form. We further demonstrate that extracellular nicotinamide is readily converted to extracellular nicotinic acid in a manner that requires intracellular nicotinamidase activity. Like nicotinamide riboside, export of nicotinic acid is elevated by the deletion of the nicotinic acid transporter, Tna1. The data indicate that NAD+ metabolism has a critical extracellular element in the yeast system and suggest that cells regulate intracellular NAD+ metabolism by balancing import and export of NAD+ precursor vitamins."
https://openalex.org/W1964865928,"Some pathological conditions with feeding pattern alterations, including obesity and Huntington disease (HD) are associated with hypothalamic dysfunction and neuronal cell death. Additionally, the hypothalamus is a neurogenic region with the constitutive capacity to generate new cells of neuronal lineage, in adult rodents. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the expression of feeding-related neuropeptides in hypothalamic progenitor cells and their capacity to differentiate to functional neurons which have been described to be affected by hypothalamic dysfunction. Our study shows that hypothalamic progenitor cells from rat embryos grow as floating neurospheres and express the feeding-related neuropeptides Neuropeptide Y (NPY), Agouti-related Protein (AGRP), Pro-OpioMelanocortin (POMC), Cocaine-and-Amphetamine Responsive Transcript (CART) and Orexin-A/Hypocretin-1. Moreover the relative mRNA expression of NPY and POMC increases during the expansion of hypothalamic neurospheres in proliferative conditions.Mature neurons were obtained from the differentiation of hypothalamic progenitor cells including NPY, AGRP, POMC, CART and Orexin-A positive neurons. Furthermore the relative mRNA expression of NPY, CART and Orexin-A increases after the differentiation of hypothalamic neurospheres. Similarly to the adult hypothalamic neurons the neurospheres-derived neurons express the glutamate transporter EAAT3. The orexigenic and anorexigenic phenotype of these neurons was identified by functional response to ghrelin and leptin hormones, respectively. This work demonstrates the presence of appetite-related neuropeptides in hypothalamic progenitor cells and neurons obtained from the differentiation of hypothalamic neurospheres, including the neuronal phenotypes that have been described by others as being affected by hypothalamic neurodegeneration. These in vitro models can be used to study hypothalamic progenitor cells aiming a therapeutic intervention to mitigate feeding dysfunction that are associated with hypothalamic neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2037638635,"von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a multimeric plasma protein that mediates platelet adhesion to sites of vascular injury. The hemostatic function of VWF depends upon the formation of disulfide-linked multimers, which requires the VWF propeptide (D1D2 domains) and adjacent D′D3 domains. VWF multimer assembly occurs in the trans-Golgi at pH ∼6.2 but not at pH 7.4, which suggests that protonation of one or more His residues (pKa ∼6.0) mediates the pH dependence of multimerization. Alignment of 30 vertebrate VWF sequences identified 13 highly conserved His residues in the D1D2D′D3 domains, and His-to-Ala mutagenesis identified His395 and His460 in the D2 domain as critical for VWF multimerization. Replacement of His395 with Lys or Arg prevented multimer assembly, suggesting that reversible protonation of this His residue is essential. In contrast, replacement of His460 with Lys or Arg preserved normal multimer assembly, whereas Leu, Met, and Gln did not, indicating that the function of His460 depends primarily upon the presence of a positive charge. These results suggest that pH sensing by evolutionarily conserved His residues facilitates the assembly and packaging of VWF multimers upon arrival in the trans-Golgi. von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a multimeric plasma protein that mediates platelet adhesion to sites of vascular injury.

VWF is assembled from identical 350-kDa precursors consisting of multiple structural domains in the order D1-D2-D′-D3-A1-A2-A3-D4-B1-B2-B3-C1-C2-CK (where CK indicates the cystine knot domain). The hemostatic function of VWF depends upon its assembly into multimers, and defects in VWF multimer formation are common causes of von Willebrand disease, the most prevalent inherited bleeding disorder (1Sadler J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 395-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar). von Willebrand factor endoplasmic reticulum baby hamster kidney. The assembly of VWF multimers begins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of endothelial cells, where pro-VWF monomers form homodimers through “tail-to-tail” intersubunit disulfide bonds between C-terminal cystine knot domains. After transport to the Golgi, pro-VWF dimers assemble into large multimers through “head-to-head” N-terminal interchain disulfide bonds between D3 domains. Subsequent cleavage of VWF propeptide (D1D2) by furin yields mature, multimeric VWF that is packed into tubular arrays and stored in rod-shaped granules called Weibel-Palade bodies (2Wagner D.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 217-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The completion of VWF multimer assembly in the Golgi apparatus poses several challenges to the cell. Disulfide bonds typically form in the ER, where disulfide oxidoreductases and chaperones are devoted to this function. However, the Golgi is relatively hostile to disulfide rearrangement because the lower pH inhibits deprotonation of the sulfhydryl moiety of Cys residues, which is necessary for disulfide rearrangement. In addition, suitable oxidoreductases and chaperones are thought to be absent from the Golgi. To facilitate disulfide bond formation under these circumstances, the N-terminal D1D2D′D3 domains of the VWF precursor act as an endogenous pH-dependent oxidoreductase. Deletion of the VWF propeptide prevents multimerization, but expression of the propeptide and mature subunit on separate plasmids (in trans) restores efficient multimer assembly (3Wise R.J. Pittman D.D. Handin R.I. Kaufman R.J. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1988; 52: 229-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In the ER, the VWF propeptide forms a transient intrachain disulfide-linked intermediate with the D3 domain that rearranges in the Golgi to yield interchain disulfide bonds linking VWF subunits into multimers (4Purvis A.R. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49982-49988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, the D1 and D2 domains both contain vicinal cysteines in a CGLC motif similar to the active site of disulfide isomerases, and insertion of an additional Gly into either motif inhibits VWF multimerization (5Mayadas T.N. Wagner D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 3531-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the VWF propeptide and protein disulfide isomerases employ similar mechanisms to facilitate disulfide bond formation. VWF multimer assembly and packaging into Weibel-Palade bodies are both regulated by pH differences between the ER and relatively acidic Golgi. Neutralizing the pH of the Golgi by treating cells with ammonium chloride or chloroquine blocks VWF multimer assembly (6Wagner D.D. Mayadas T. Marder V.J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In a cell-free system, VWF multimer assembly does not occur at pH 7.4, which is typical of the ER, but proceeds to some extent at pH 6.2 and is optimal at pH 5.8, conditions typical of the trans-Golgi and Weibel-Palade body, respectively (7Mayadas T.N. Wagner D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13497-13503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Erent M. Meli A. Moisoi N. Babich V. Hannah M.J. Skehel P. Knipe L. Zupancic G. Ogden D. Carter T. J. Physiol. 2007; 583: 195-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition, neutralizing the intracellular pH disrupts the tubular packing of VWF multimers and causes rod-shaped Weibel-Palade bodies to become spherical, which prevents the orderly secretion of VWF filaments in response to secretagogues (9Michaux G. Abbitt K.B. Collinson L.M. Haberichter S.L. Norman K.E. Cutler D.F. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 223-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In vitro, the VWF propeptide forms noncovalent homodimers that bind tightly to multimeric VWF at pH 6.4 but dissociate at pH 7.4 (10Huang R.H. Wang Y. Roth R. Yu X. Purvis A.R. Heuser J.E. Egelman E.H. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 482-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Purified VWF propeptide and dimers of N-terminal D′D3 fragments self-assemble into tubules at pH 6.2 and disassemble at pH 7.4 (10Huang R.H. Wang Y. Roth R. Yu X. Purvis A.R. Heuser J.E. Egelman E.H. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 482-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus, low pH is necessary to form intersubunit disulfide bonds during multimer assembly, after which low pH is also necessary for multimers to condense into tubules. These findings suggest that the two processes, multimer assembly and tubular packing, may be regulated by distinct sets of pH-sensing residues. Several proteins employ His residues as pH sensors to regulate their function upon transport to the Golgi. For example, His69 in the autoinhibitory propeptide of furin becomes protonated in the trans-Golgi, after which the propeptide dissociates and furin can cleave other substrates (11Feliciangeli S.F.

The recycling mannose lectin ERGIC-53 binds cargo in the ER and releases it in the slightly more acidic ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), and cargo release requires protonation of conserved His178 (12Appenzeller-Herzog C.

A recent His-to-Ala mutagenesis study of the ligand-receptor binding interface showed that the evolutionarily conserved residues His180 in human prolactin and His188 in the prolactin receptor are critical for pH-dependent ligand binding at the cell surface and release in acidic endosomes (13Kulkarni M.V.

We have used phylogenetic comparisons to identify candidate pH-sensing His residues in VWF and homologous gel-forming mucins, which were functionally evaluated by mutagenesis. The results indicate that at least two His residues in the D2 domain of the VWF propeptide are critical for pH-dependent multimer assembly in the Golgi.

Gaps were assigned lengths based on the conserved length of the corresponding exons in VWF genes of other species. Sequences encoding the D1D2D′D3 segment of the mucins MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC5B, MUC6, MUC19, and FIMB1 were identified by methods similar to those used for VWF. The sequences, supporting evidence, and methods for phylogenetic analyses are described in detail in the supplemental material. All sequences have been scanned against these databases, and accession numbers for sequences with significant relatedness to the deposited sequences are included. Mutations were constructed utilizing a QuikChange XL kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with oligonucleotides from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Mutations were prepared in pSVHVWF1.1, which encodes full-length human VWF (21Matsushita T. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13406-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), in plasmid pSVH-propeptide-FLAGNT, which encodes the VWF propeptide (amino acid residues 1–763) with an N-terminal FLAG tag between the signal peptide and domain D1 (4Purvis A.R. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49982-49988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), or in plasmid pSVH-D3-FLAGNT/cMycCT, which encodes the VWF D1D2D′D3 domains (residues 1–1241) with an N-terminal FLAG tag and a C-terminal c-Myc tag (4Purvis A.R. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49982-49988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Plasmid pSVH-KSDR-D3-FLAGNT/cMycCT is similar to pSVH-D3-FLAGNT/cMycCT except that amino acid residues 760RSKR763 were mutated to 760KSDR763, which prevents cleavage by furin (22Rehemtulla A. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1992; 79: 2349-2355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pSVH-D′D3Δpro-c-Myc encodes the VWF signal peptide (residues 1–22) followed by domains D′D3 (residues 764–1220) and a c-Myc tag (4Purvis A.R. Sadler J.E. J. Biol.

Plasmid pSVH-Δpro encodes the VWF signal peptide (residues 1–22) followed by the mature VWF subunit (residues 764–2813). BHK-fur4 cells that express human furin (23Bodó I. Katsumi A. Tuley E.A. Eikenboom J.C. Dong Z. Sadler J.E. Blood. 2001; 98: 2973-2979Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine. BHK-fur4-D1D2D′D3-FLAGNT-c-MycCT cells were described previously (4Purvis A.R. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49982-49988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). BHK-fur4-D1D2-KSDR-D′D3-FLAGNT-c-MycCT cells, stably transfected with pSVH-KSDR-D3-FLAGNT/cMycCT, were prepared similarly. BHK cells were transiently transfected with pSVH-propeptide-FLAGNT and pSVH-D′D3Δpro-c-Myc constructs, pSVH-VWF constructs, or pSVH-D3-FLAGNT/cMycCT constructs, using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Conditioned medium was collected after 48 h and treated with 40 mm N-ethylmaleimide and 144 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The concentration of VWF was determined by ELISA (24Tuley E.A. Gaucher C. Jorieux S. Worrall N.K. Sadler J.E. Mazurier C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 6377-6381Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Falcon Pro-bind ELISA plates (BD Biosciences) were coated with a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-VWF antibody (082; DAKO, Carpinteria, CA). Bound VWF was detected with a 1:5000 dilution of HRP-conjugated rabbit polyclonal anti-VWF antibody (P226; DAKO) and tetramethyl-benzidine (Pierce). Plates were read by a Spectra MaxPLUS microplate reader with the SoftMaxPro 4.7.1 software (Molecular Devices, Silicon Valley, CA). D′D3 samples were heated to 100 °C for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE on 4–15% gradient gels (Bio-Rad). VWF multimer gel electrophoresis was performed as described previously (25Raines G. Aumann H. Sykes S. Street A. Thromb. Res. 1990; 60: 201-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Multimer gels were incubated in 1.34 mm mercaptoethanol in PBS for 15 min to increase the efficiency of protein transfer by electroblotting onto polyvinylidene (PVDF) membranes (Whatman). Blots were blocked for 1 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 0.5% casein and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in a 1:1000 dilution of HRP-conjugated rabbit polyclonal anti-VWF (P226; DAKO) and developed using the ECL Plus kit (GE Healthcare). Coding sequences for VWF were assembled for 30 vertebrates including 20 placental mammals, a marsupial, two birds, a reptile, an amphibian, and five fish (supplemental material and supplemental Fig. S1). Exon 2 encodes a signal peptide and was identified or could be proposed with a high degree of confidence for all amniotes except dolphin because of a gap in the dolphin genome assembly. The proposed second exons for frog and fish VWF are relatively uncertain because they lack support from cDNA sequences or from similarity to signal peptides for VWF genes of other species. Exon 1 is noncoding and could not be identified for 10 species. The remaining coding sequences are complete except for portions of six exons (0.4% of 1530 total exons) encoding 199 amino acid residues (0.08% of total amino acids). The VWF gene structure varies relatively little among the species studied. All 52 exons present in human VWF are conserved, and exon length is invariant for 23 exons. Among 1504 total exons (excluding exons 1–2), only 113 (0.7%) deviate from the length of the corresponding human exon, and in 63 instances, the difference is one codon. All splice junctions are standard except for eight (0.53%) that are predicted to employ a GC splice donor (supplemental Table S1), which is similar to the 0.56% prevalence of noncanonical GC-AG splice sites reported for a dataset of more than 22,000 mammalian introns (26Burset M. Seledtsov I.A. Solovyev V.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The use of these noncanonical splice sites in anole VWF intron 26 and zebrafish VWF intron 44 was verified by comparison of genomic DNA and cDNA sequences (supplemental Table S1). Exon 28 exhibits more extreme variation in structure. In tetrapods and zebrafish, exon 28 varies in length from 1346 to 1436 nucleotides and encodes VWF domains A1 and A2. However, exon 28 is split into exons 28a (304–310 nucleotides) and 28b (1066–1162 nucleotides) in the three-spined stickleback, Japanese medaka, spotted green pufferfish, and fugu. These four fish are closely related when compared with zebrafish (supplemental Fig. S1), which suggests that a single exon 28 is ancestral and the split exon 28 is a derived character. The amino acid sequence of VWF is also highly conserved. Human VWF (amino acid residues 23–2813) is at least 78% identical to VWF of other placental mammals, 73% identical to opossum VWF, 55–56% identical to bird, reptile, and amphibian VWF, and 45–46% identical to fish VWF (supplemental Fig. S2). Human VWF has 233 Cys residues (not including one Cys in the signal peptide), and all are conserved in other vertebrates with two kinds of exceptions that involve four Cys residues. VWF of the Western clawed frog lacks two Cys residues corresponding to Cys418 and Cys521 in the D2 domain of human VWF. The simultaneous absence of these two Cys residues suggests that they form a disulfide bond in frog VWF, which is supported by the identification of a Cys898–Cys993 disulfide bond between the corresponding residues in the homologous D3 domain of human VWF (19Mancuso D.J. Tuley E.A. Westfield L.A. Worrall N.K. Shelton-Inloes B.B. Sorace J.M. Alevy Y.G. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19514-19527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Marti T. Rösselet S.J. Titani K. Walsh K.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8099-8109Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). VWF of all five fish studied is missing two Cys residues that correspond to Cys1669 and Cys1670 of human VWF and are conserved in other species. These residues are located at the C-terminal end of the VWF A2 domain, where they form an unusual vicinal disulfide bond (27Marti T. Rösselet S.J. Titani K. Walsh K.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8099-8109Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The A2 domain unfolds in response to hydrodynamic shear stress to expose a cleavage site for ADAMTS13, a regulatory metalloprotease that is specific for VWF. The rigid Cys1669–Cys1670 disulfide bond is tightly buried in a hydrophobic pocket and resists the force-dependent unfolding of the A2 domain (28Zhang Q. Zhou Y.F. Zhang C.Z. Zhang X. Lu C. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 9226-9231Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The absence of the Cys1669–Cys1670 disulfide bond would be expected to decrease the stability of the A2 domain and decrease the force required to initiate unfolding. Therefore, the lack of this disulfide bond in fish VWF may reflect adaptation to distinct hemostatic requirements. For example, blood circulates in fish at relatively low velocities that are likely to generate low shear forces, which may require a reduced threshold for shear-induced unfolding of VWF to allow proteolytic cleavage by ADAMTS13. The relationship between structure and force sensing could be evaluated directly by comparing the unfolding of fish and mammalian A2 domains with laser tweezers (29Zhang X. Halvorsen K. Zhang C.Z. Wong W.P. Springer T.A. Science. 2009; 324: 1330-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Histidine has a pKa value suitable for detecting the difference in pH between ER (pH 7.4) and the trans-Golgi (pH 6.2) and is likely to perform this function during the assembly and storage of VWF multimers in Weibel-Palade bodies. Intracellular multimerization and storage of VWF are conserved among vertebrates, which suggests that pH-sensing His residues could be identified by phylogenetic comparison of VWF sequences. The D1D2D′D3 segment of VWF is sufficient for pH-dependent oligomerization and tubular storage, and relevant His residues should reside in these domains. Of the 32 His residues in the D1D2D′D3 domains of human VWF, 9 are conserved in all 30 species studied, and 4 others are conserved in at least 28 of 30 species (supplemental Fig. S3 and Fig. 1A). VWF and gel-forming mucins belong to a family of evolutionarily related vertebrate proteins that form large polymers (30Lang T. Hansson G.C. Samuelsson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

As in the case of VWF, these mucins form dimers in the ER that assemble into disulfide-linked multimers in the Golgi (31Perez-Vilar J. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31751-31754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), suggesting a conserved role for mucin D1D2D′D3 domains in the pH-dependent assembly of multimers. Alignment of human VWF with representative gel-forming mucins (supplemental Fig. S4) shows that a subset of His residues conserved in VWF is also conserved in mucins (Fig. 1B). His596 is present in all mucins, and His874 is present in all mucins except FIMB1. His395 and His831 occur in all MUC2, MUC5AC, and MUC5B sequences, but not in MUC6, MUC19, or FIMB1. Conservation across VWF and gel-forming mucins suggests that some of these His residues might participate in pH-sensitive biosynthetic steps that are shared by all of these proteins. However, VWF and mucins have structural differences that may reflect significant differences in the mechanism of biosynthesis and intracellular storage. For example, the D1D2 domains of VWF comprise a propeptide that is separated from the D′D3 domains by a conserved furin cleavage site, but this cleavage site is not present in gel-forming mucins (supplemental Fig. S4). Consequently, the D1D2 domains are likely to remain covalently attached to multimeric mucins, as demonstrated for recombinant MUC19 (35Perez-Vilar J. Eckhardt A.E. DeLuca A. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14442-14449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The pH-dependent binding of the VWF propeptide to the mature VWF subunit is important for storage in Weibel-Palade bodies, but any His residues that mediate this noncovalent binding in VWF may be unnecessary for mucins if the D1D2 domains and D′D3 domains remain covalently linked. The formation of intersubunit disulfide bonds between D3 domains of VWF subunits occurs in the Golgi and is blocked by raising the intracellular pH with ammonium chloride, chloroquine, or monensin (6Wagner D.D. Mayadas T. Marder V.J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This pH-dependent assembly process can be studied conveniently with constructs of VWF that are truncated after the D3 domain (4Purvis A.R. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49982-49988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 36Voorberg J. Fontijn R. van Mourik J.A. Pannekoek H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 797-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For example, the expression of VWF D1D2D′D3 domains in BHK cells results in the secretion of D′D3 55-kDa monomers and 110-kDa dimers, as well as cleaved 85-kDa VWF propeptide (domains D1D2) (4Purvis A.R. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49982-49988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and treatment of cells expressing this construct with chloroquine prevented D′D3 dimerization (Fig. 2A). Chloroquine concentrations of 30 μm or greater also inhibited cleavage of VWF propeptide, probably because furin is inactive at elevated pH (11Feliciangeli S.F. Thomas L. Scott G.K. Subbian E. Hung C.H. Molloy S.S. Jean F. Shinde U. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16108-16116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), which resulted in secretion of monomeric 140-kDa D1D2D′D3 that has the same electrophoretic mobility as D′D3 dimers. Similar effects were observed upon treatment of cells with increasing concentrations of ammonium chloride, which progressively inhibited the dimerization of D′D3. At 100 mm ammonium chloride, propeptide cleavage was inhibited, and the predominant secreted product appeared to be monomeric D1D2D′D3 (Fig. 2B). This interpretation was confirmed by expressing a variant of D1D2D′D3 in which the furin recognition site was mutated to KSDR to prevent cleavage. For this construct, dimerization was completely inhibited at 100 mm ammonium chloride, and the secreted product consisted entirely of monomeric 140-kDa D1D2D′D3 (Fig. 2C). These results show that the formation of intersubunit disulfide bonds by VWF D1D2D′D3 exhibits the expected dependence on Golgi pH. This system was employed to evaluate the role of conserved His residues on pH-dependent disulfide bond formation. The decrease in pH between ER and Golgi would facilitate the reversible protonation of a pH-sensing His residue. To prevent the acquisition of positive charge at acidic pH, His residues were replaced by Ala, and the effect of charge removal on D′D3 dimerization was assessed in BHK-fur4 cells transiently transfected with the corresponding D1D2D′D3 constructs (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained by expressing D1D2 and D′D3 domains on separate plasmids (supplemental Fig. S5). All constructs were expressed efficiently except H1159A, for which secretion was severely impaired. Dimerization was prevented by the substitutions H395A and H460A, whereas decreased but detectable dimerization was observed for H95A, H596A, and H737A. The remaining constructs assembled dimers with approximately normal efficiency, indicating that the corresponding His residues are not essential for intersubunit disulfide bond formation. Replacement by Ala at five of eight conserved His residues in the VWF propeptide impaired D′D3 dimerization; one is in domain D1 (His95), and four are in domain D2 (His395, His460, His596, His737). These results suggest that the VWF propeptide contains pH-sensing His residues, which is consistent with the observation that recombinant D1D2 exhibits increased noncovalent self-association at pH 6.2 when compared with pH 7.4 (10Huang R.H. Wang Y. Roth R. Yu X. Purvis A.R. Heuser J.E. Egelman E.H. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 482-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Conversely, none of five evaluable His residues in the D′D3 domains was required to form D′D3 dimers. D′D3 monomers do not self-associate at low pH (10Huang R.H. Wang Y. Roth R. Yu X. Purvis A.R. Heuser J.E. Egelman E.H. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 482-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), which might suggest that D′D3 domains lack pH-sensing His residues. However, low pH does promote the binding of D′D3 monomers to D1D2. Low pH also induces D′D3 dimers to bind D1D2 domains and form large helical tubules similar to the VWF tubules within Weibel-Palade bodies of endothelial cells (10Huang R.H. Wang Y. Roth R. Yu X. Purvis A.R. Heuser J.E. Egelman E.H. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 482-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus, it remains possible that pH-sensing residues on D′D3 domains mediate interactions with D1D2 that contribute to intersubunit disulfide bond formation, tubular packing in Weibel-Palade bodies, or both processes. For selected His-to-Ala substitutions that impaired dimerization, the His residue was replaced by Arg to prevent the loss of positive charge at neutral pH, and the effect of this charge stabilization was assessed (Fig. 3A). D′D3 dimerization was not preserved in constructs H395R, H596R, or H737R. However, H460R formed dimers approximately as efficiently as the wild type construct. Mutagenesis of His460 was extended to include replacement with nonpolar amino acids of varying sizes (Ala, Leu, Met), positively charged amino acids (Arg, Lys), and the polar amino acid Gln. Only Lys and Arg restored D′D3 dimerization, suggesting that formation of disulfide bonds between D3 domains depends on a positive charge at this position (Fig. 3B). Conserved His residues within the D1D2D′D3 domains were also changed to Ala in the context of full-length VWF. When expressed in BHK cells, VWF assembles into disulfide-linked multimers with more than 20 bands visible upon SDS-agarose gel electrophoresis. Bands correspond to multimers with even numbers of subunits ranging from dimers to larger than 40-mers. Whether VWF is encoded by a single plasmid (cis) or by separate plasmids for the VWF propeptide and mature subunit (trans), multimers assemble with similar efficiency (Fig. 4). We took advantage of this property by constructing most D1D2 mutations in the smaller propeptide construct, which was coexpressed with the mature subunit. Mutations located in the D′D3 domains were constructed and expressed in a single full-length VWF plasmid. In most cases, mutations at His residues behaved similarly whether expressed in truncated D1D2D′D3 (Fig. 3) or in full-length VWF (Fig. 4). Multimers composed of VWF H1159A were not secreted (data not shown), which is comparable with the results obtained for the same mutation in the truncated D1D2D′D3 construct. As expected, His residues that were not required for dimerization of D1D2D′D3 (Fig. 3) were not essential in full-length VWF (Fig. 4). In particular, none of five evaluable His-to-Ala substitutions in the D′D3 domains had a pronounced effect upon multimer assembly: H831A, H874A, H1174A, H1221A, and H1226A. Three His-to-Ala mutations produced somewhat different results when expressed in truncated or full-length VWF. H95A and H596A allowed the secretion of trace amounts of D′D3 dimer (Fig. 3A) but were compatible with the secretion of a range of VWF multimers, although the size distribution was skewed toward smaller species (Fig. 4). Conversely, the mutation H725A did not reduce the production of D′D3 dimer (Fig. 3A) but was associated with the secretion of relatively small VWF multimers when compared with wild type VWF (Fig. 4). This variation suggests that sequences C-terminal to the critical D1D2D′D3 region can influence the efficiency of VWF multimer assembly. Alternatively, the intermediate and variable phenotype caused by the substitution H725A may reflect the presence of the adjacent His726, which is found in VWF from 24 of 30 species sequenced (supplemental Fig. S3). If both His725 and His726 contribute to pH-dependent changes in the D2 domain, then loss of one may cause a partial loss of function. Ala substitutions at His395 and His737 markedly decreased D′D3 dimer formation (Fig. 3A) and VWF multimer assembly (Fig. 4). In addition, neither H395A nor H395R formed multimers when expressed in full-length VWF. H737A and H737R also had similar defects in D′D3 dimer formation (Fig. 3A) and multimer assembly (Fig. 4), although less severe than associated with mutations at His395. These results indicate that the fixed positive charge of a guanidinium group in Arg cannot substitute functionally for His395 or His737. Amino acid substitutions at His460 had congruent effects on D′D3 dimerization (Fig. 3) and VWF multimer assembly (Fig. 5). As observed for the truncated D1D2D′D3 construct, mutation of His460 to Ala, Leu, Met, or Gln profoundly impaired multimerization, but replacement by Arg or Lys restored multimerization at least to the level of wild type VWF. H460K and H460R constructs formed multimers with equal efficiency (Fig. 5), indicating that intersubunit disulfide bond formation depends on the presence of a positive charge at this position. Results were consistent with the proposed function of conserved His residues as pH sensors. The conserved His395 and His460 located in the propeptide play an essential role in VWF multimerization. Among the residues examined, replacement of His395 or His460 by Ala (that is H395A or H460A, respectively) caused the most profound defect in intersubunit disulfide bond formation, which suggests that these residues contribute to the pH-dependent regulation of VWF multimer assembly. Both residues are highly conserved in VWF (Fig. 1A), but His460 is not conserved in gel-forming mucins (Fig. 1B). The significance of this distinction is unknown at present but may be related to the absence of a furin site between the D1D2 and D′D3 domains of mucins (supplemental Fig. S4); His460 may be required for pH-dependent interactions between the D1D2 propeptide and mature VWF subunit after cleavage by furin but dispensable for mucins. In addition, VWF is stored intracellularly in densely packed helical tubules, whereas gel-forming mucins do not appear to undergo a similar process of highly ordered condensation in secretory granules. Therefore, the pH-dependent tubular packing of VWF may well depend on His residues that would not need to be conserved in mucins. Multimer assembly and tubular packing are critical for the hemostatic function of VWF. Both events depend on low pH in the trans-Golgi but can be dissociated by appropriately targeted mutations. For example, the von Willebrand disease mutation Y87S impairs both processes, preventing multimer assembly and disrupting tubular packing; VWF Y87S dimers are stored in spherical, disorganized Weibel-Palade bodies (9Michaux G.

However, insertion of an extra Gly into the CGLC motif of domain D1 blocks multimer assembly without affecting storage in rod-shaped Weibel-Palade bodies (5Mayadas T.N. Wagner D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 3531-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Whether specific pH-sensing His residues participate in one or both of these processes will be established by additional analyses that discriminate between the noncovalent dimerization of the VWF propeptide (D1D2), binding of propeptide to D′D3 domains, disulfide-mediated multimerization, and packing of VWF into tubules (4Purvis A.R.

In addition, there is no treatment, and there is a lack of knowledge why disparities among populations exist. Research studies suggest that fat tissue may participate in body's immune responses, and the impact of obesity on susceptibility to HSV1 infection is not clear. The purpose of this study was to examine whether obesity is a risk factor for HSV1 infection using a large sample from the general population.This cross-sectional study used data from the National Health and Examination and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2007-2008. Variables, gender, age, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, poverty level, and diabetes represented potential confounders and were included in analyses. The two-tailed Pearson's chi square, student's t test, and a multiple logistic regression analysis were applied to evaluate associations using a significance value of p≤0.05. Adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence interval represented the degree of these associations. The prevalence of HSV1 infection in US population between 20 and 49 years old was 60.3% (n = 1,536). In this study, having a BMI classified as the obese group (BMI 30-39.9) was significantly associated with HSV1 infection before [unadjusted OR = 1.74 (95% CI 1.20-2.51), p = 0.006] and after controlling for socio-demographic factors [adjusted OR = 1.50 (95%CI 1.06-2.13)], p = 0.026]. This association was stronger than three already established risk factors of age, female gender, and poverty level.This study provides evidence that obesity may play a role in the susceptibility to HSV1 infection. Findings from this study suggest that obesity should be considered when designing preventive measures for HSV1 infection. These results may also explain why some people acquire HSV1 infections and some do not. Further, these findings may justify an increased emphasis on the control and prevention of HSV1 transmission and other pathogens in overweight and obese populations."

We evaluated the effects of exogenous apoA-I expression on cardiac differentiation of ESCs and maturation of ESC-derived cardiomyocytes. We stably over-expressed full-length human apoA-I cDNA with lentivirus (LV)-mediated gene transfer in undifferentiated mouse ESCs and human induced pluripotent stem cells. Upon cardiac differentiation, we observed a significantly higher percentage of beating embryoid bodies, an increased number of cardiomyocytes as determined by flow cytometry, and expression of cardiac markers including α-myosin heavy chain, β-myosin heavy chain and myosin light chain 2 ventricular transcripts in LV-apoA-I transduced ESCs compared with control (LV-GFP). In the presence of noggin, a BMP4 antagonist, activation of BMP4-SMAD signaling cascade in apoA-I transduced ESCs completely abolished the apoA-I stimulated cardiac differentiation. Furthermore, co-application of recombinant apoA-I and BMP4 synergistically increased the percentage of beating EBs derived from untransduced D3 ESCs. These together suggests that that pro-cardiogenic apoA-I is mediated via the BMP4-SMAD signaling pathway. Functionally, cardiomyocytes derived from the apoA-I-transduced cells exhibited improved calcium handling properties in both non-caffeine and caffeine-induced calcium transient, suggesting that apoA-I plays a role in enhancing cardiac maturation. This increased cardiac differentiation and maturation has also been observed in human iPSCs, providing further evidence of the beneficial effects of apoA-I in promoting cardiac differentiation. In Conclusion, we present novel experimental evidence that apoA-I enhances cardiac differentiation of ESCs and iPSCs and promotes maturation of the calcium handling property of ESC-derived cardiomyocytes via the BMP4/SMAD signaling pathway."

Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar). There are nine members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases, which include Src, Lck, Hck, Blk, Fyn, Lyn, Yes, Fgr, and Yrk (1Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar, 2Boggon T.J. Eck M.J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7918-7927Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Earlier studies reported that both human and rodent platelets contain high levels of Src as well as Fyn, Lyn, Hck, Yes, Lck, and Fgr (3Golden A. Nemeth S.P. Brugge J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1986; 83: 852-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 4Huang M.M. Bolen J.B. Barnwell J.W. Shattil S.J. Brugge J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Among these, c-Src kinase is present in the most abundant amounts and represents about 0.2–0.4% of the total platelet protein (6Clark E.A. Shattil S.J. Brugge J.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 464-469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Although platelets contain high levels of SFKs, suggesting an important role for these enzymes in platelet function, the role of SFKs in platelet function has been complex and not fully understood. In platelets, SFKs, particularly Lyn and Fyn, play a crucial role downstream of collagen receptors (7Quek L.S. Pasquet J.M. Hers I. Cornall R. Knight G. Barnes M. Hibbs M.L. Dunn A.R. Lowell C.A. Watson S.P. Blood. 2000; 96: 4246-4253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, platelets from Fyn−/− mice exhibit delayed spreading on immobilized fibrinogen (8Reddy K.B. Smith D.M. Plow E.F. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 1641-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), whereas platelets from Lyn−/− mice spread poorly on von Willebrand factor (9Yin H. Liu J. Li Z. Berndt M.C. Lowell C.A. Du X. Blood. 2008; 112: 1139-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Moreover, c-Src has been shown to play an important role in integrin αIIbβ3-dependent outside-in signaling (10Obergfell A. Eto K. Mocsai A. Buensuceso C. Moores S.L. Brugge J.S. Lowell C.A.

It is also known that SFKs play a role in thromboxane generation (13Garcia A. Quinton T.M. Dorsam R.T. Kunapuli S.P. Blood. 2005; 106: 3410-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), shape change (14Bauer M. Maschberger P. Quek L. Briddon S.J. Dash D. Weiss M. Watson S.P. Siess W. Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 85: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), as well as regulation of phosphorylation of Akt (15Kim S. Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. Blood. 2006; 107: 947-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and ERK (16Garcia A. Shankar H. Murugappan S. Kim S. Kunapuli S.P. Biochem.

Haemost. 2006; 4: 638-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).An important mechanism for regulation of c-Src tyrosine kinase activity is through control of its phosphorylation status. There are two major phosphorylation sites present on human c-Src, Tyr416 and Tyr527. A short C-terminal tail of SFKs contains an autoinhibitory phosphorylation site, Tyr527 (18Cooper J.A. Gould K.L. Cartwright C.A. Hunter T. Science. 1986; 231: 1431-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 19Smart J.E. Oppermann H. Czernilofsky A.P. Purchio A.F. Erikson R.L. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1981; 78: 6013-6017Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), whereas Tyr416 is a target for intermolecular autophosphorylation (19Smart J.E. Oppermann H. Czernilofsky A.P. Purchio A.F. Erikson R.L. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1981; 78: 6013-6017Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). When Tyr416 is phosphorylated, it is displaced from the substrate binding pocket, allowing the kinase access to substrates. Thus, when Tyr416 is phosphorylated, it is a positive regulator of Src activity.Shape change is considered to be the first measurable physiological response produced by platelets following exposure to an agonist. ADP-induced platelet shape change is involved in Gq-coupled calcium mobilization and the activation of RhoA (20Paul B.Z. Daniel J.L. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28293-28300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). A number of receptors can couple to G12/13 including thrombin and thromboxane A2, and platelet shape change induced by these agonists is mediated by both calcium-dependent and -independent mechanisms that occur through Gq and G12/13 pathways, respectively (20Paul B.Z. Daniel J.L. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28293-28300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). G12/13 has been shown to regulate Rho-dependent response (21Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol.

Haemost. 1997; 78: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Upon activation of PLC, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in the plasma membrane inner leaflet is hydrolyzed to diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (24Brass L.F. Hoxie J.A.

Although diacylglycerol serves as a stimulatory cofactor for the activation of protein kinase C (PKC), inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate induces a rapid rise in intracellular calcium (23Brass L.F.

Calcium regulates various platelet functions, including secretion, integrin activation, annexin V binding, thromboxane A2 generation, and thrombin generation (27Trotter P.J. Orchard M.A. Walker J.H.

Various PKC- and calcium-dependent events ensue, two of which are the secretion of contents stored in the dense granules of the platelet and the phosphorylation of pleckstrin, a 47-kDa substrate of PKC.In the current study, we have investigated the regulation of platelet function by SFKs downstream of G12/13 pathways. Our studies indicate that inhibition of SFKs leads to potentiation of platelet aggregation and secretion mediated by PAR agonists, whereas ADP-induced platelet aggregation is not affected by SFK inhibitors. Moreover, inhibiting SFKs downstream of G12/13 led to the potentiation of intracellular calcium mobilization and PKC activation. Interestingly, we have found that platelet aggregation and PKC activation mediated by AYPGKF are potentiated in Fyn-deficient mouse platelets compared with the wild-type mouse platelets. These studies demonstrate that Fyn downstream of G12/13 negatively regulate platelet responses by inhibiting intracellular Ca2+ and PKC through modulation of Gq pathways. These studies clearly demonstrate the intricate signaling pathways that negatively regulate Gq activation in platelets.DISCUSSIONAlthough SFKs are known to be expressed abundantly in platelets, their role in platelet activation has not been fully elucidated. We have previously shown that AYPGKF and thrombin were able to induce an increase in Src phosphorylation in Gαq-deficient mouse platelets, indicating that selective G12/13 activation results in activation of SFKs (15Kim S. Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. Blood. 2006; 107: 947-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In this study, we have further elucidated the contribution of SFKs selectively activated downstream of G12/13 pathways in platelet functional responses.To determine the role of SFKs downstream of G12/13, we first evaluated the effect of inhibition of SFKs on G12/13-induced shape change. It is known that platelet shape change involves both calcium-dependent and calcium-independent mechanisms as evidenced by the prevention of shape change in both the absence of calcium mobilization and RhoA/p160ROCK activity (20Paul B.Z. Daniel J.L. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28293-28300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 42Paul B.Z. Kim S. Dangelmaier C. Nagaswami C. Jin J. Hartwig J.H. Weisel J.W. Daniel J.L. Kunapuli S.P. Platelets. 2003; 14: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Platelet shape change induced by selective stimulation of G12/13 is mediated by RhoA/p160ROCK activity without the contribution of calcium mobilization (33Klages B. Brandt U. Simon M.I. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 34Offermanns S. Toombs C.F. Hu Y.H. Simon M.I. Nature. 1997; 389: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Our results show that inhibition of SFK converts platelet shape change induced by selective G12/13 stimulation with YFLLRNP from a RhoA/p160ROCK-dependent event to a both RhoA/p160ROCK-dependent and calcium-dependent event, indicating the contribution of intracellular calcium mobilization in the presence of SFK inhibitors. Thus, it appears that SFKs downstream of G12/13 negatively regulates platelet responses with the contribution of calcium-dependent component.If G12/13-mediated SFKs negatively regulate platelet function, we would expect that SFK inhibition leads to the potentiation of platelet responses induced by only those agonists that activate G12/13 pathways. It is known that PARs couple to Gq and G12/13 pathways (49Offermanns S. Laugwitz K.L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 504-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), but 2-MeSADP cannot couple to G12/13 signaling pathways (47Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 8070-8074Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that PP1 or PP2 caused a potentiation of platelet aggregation and secretion induced by low concentrations of PAR agonists, but not by 2-MeSADP, suggesting that SFKs downstream of G12/13, but not Gq/Gi, pathways are involved in the negative regulation of platelet responses. Moreover, platelet aggregation and secretion caused by co-stimulation of G12/13 and Gi/Gz (YFLLRNP + 2-MeSADP with P2Y1 antagonist/epinephrine) were potentiated in the presence of PP1 or PP2. Previous work has also shown that SFK inhibitors have no effect on calcium mobilization in response to ADP (46Hardy A.R. Jones M.L. Mundell S.J. Poole A.W. Blood. 2004; 104: 1745-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), confirming the role of SFKs downstream of G12/13, not Gq/Gi, as negative regulators of platelet activation.It has been shown that G13-deficient platelets display the defective platelet shape change and aggregation in response to thrombin (50Moers A. Nieswandt B. Massberg S. Wettschureck N. Grüner S. Konrad I. Schulte V. Aktas B. Gratacap M.P. Simon M.I. Gawaz M. Offermanns S. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1418-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). It is well known that G12/13-mediated shape change is mediated by Rho kinase (22Bauer M. Retzer M. Wilde J.I. Maschberger P. Essler M. Aepfelbacher M. Watson S.P. Siess W. Blood. 1999; 94: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Klages B. Brandt U. Simon M.I. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and RhoA downstream of G12/13 contributes to platelet aggregation and secretion (51Gong H. Shen B. Flevaris P. Chow C. Lam S.C. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Kozasa T. Du X. Science. 2010; 327: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 52Jin J. Mao Y. Thomas D. Kim S. Daniel J.L. Kunapuli S.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2009; 77: 835-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, we postulate that the positive contribution of RhoA downstream of G12/13 pathways might be more than the negative contribution of Fyn, which resulted in the observed defects in platelet shape change and aggregation in G13−/− mice.We next sought to identify the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of platelet function by SFKs downstream of G12/13. It is known that Gq-mediated PLCβ activation leads to the generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, which further promote mobilization of intracellular calcium and activation of PKC, respectively (23Brass L.F. Manning D.R. Cichowski K. Abrams C.S. Thromb. Haemost. 1997; 78: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We observed the potentiation of calcium mobilization induced by PAR agonist in the presence of PP2 and not by 2-MeSADP. In addition, PP2 caused an increase in PAR-induced phosphorylation of PKC substrate pleckstrin, indicating the possible involvement of PKCs. These results indicate that SFKs downstream of G12/13 might negatively regulate PLCβ activation, resulting in the regulation of PKC activation as well as calcium mobilization. Moreover, PP2 failed to potentiate platelet aggregation in the presence of 5,5′-dimethyl-BAPTA, whereas PP2 was still able to partially potentiate platelet aggregation in the presence of GF109203X, suggesting the minor role of PKCs in this potentiating effect. These data confirm that the potentiation of cytosolic calcium in the presence of SFK inhibitors is essential for the enhanced platelet aggregation and secretion and indicate that platelets have the overriding need for calcium to secrete their granule contents or to aggregate.In our study, PP1 or PP2 failed to potentiate platelet responses in the presence of Gq-selective inhibitor YM254890 in human platelets or in Gq-deficient mouse platelets. Thus, it is possible that the SFKs downstream of G12/13 negatively regulate PLC through the modulation of Gq pathways which results in the PLC-dependent production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-mediated calcium mobilization. When platelets are stimulated with low concentrations of thrombin, PARs initially couple to G12/13 pathways which results in platelet shape change without aggregation. Thus, at low doses, there might be weak Gq activation, although PARs predominantly couple to G12/13 pathways. It is also possible that Gq pathways are masked by the SFK-sensitive signal mediated by G12/13 pathways at these low doses. Thus, it appears that low concentrations of PAR-activating peptides, including YFLLRNP, stimulate Gq as well as G12/13 pathways when SFK, especially Fyn, is inhibited. Therefore under normal physiological conditions when platelets are exposed to low concentrations of thrombin, we can speculate that SFKs downstream of G12/13 negatively regulate Gq pathways and hence prevent platelets from aggregating and keep the platelets quiescent.Because the pharmacological inhibitors do not distinguish various SFKs, we evaluated the contribution of individual SFKs in regulation of platelet function using knock-out mice. In this study, we used Fyn and Lyn knock-out mice. It is well known that the SFKs Fyn and Lyn play an important role in glycoprotein VI-mediated platelet activation (7Quek L.S. Pasquet J.M. Hers I. Cornall R. Knight G. Barnes M. Hibbs M.L. Dunn A.R. Lowell C.A. Watson S.P. Blood. 2000; 96: 4246-4253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we have also shown that Fyn, but not Lyn, regulates glycoprotein VI-mediated Akt phosphorylation (53Kim S. Mangin P. Dangelmaier C. Lillian R. Jackson S.P. Daniel J.L. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 33763-33772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). As evidenced by the results in Fig. 7A, our study clearly demonstrates that Fyn and Lyn differentially regulate platelet responses downstream of PARs and GPVI receptors. There are conflicting data in the literature regarding the role of Lyn in thrombin-induced GPCR signaling mostly likely due to the different platelet preparation conditions and agonists used. Quek et al. (7Quek L.S. Pasquet J.M. Hers I. Cornall R. Knight G. Barnes M. Hibbs M.L. Dunn A.R. Lowell C.A. Watson S.P. Blood. 2000; 96: 4246-4253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that aggregation in Lyn−/− platelets in response to α-thrombin is similar to control responses, whereas others have reported that Lyn is required for irreversible aggregation induced by γ-thrombin in platelet-rich plasma (54Cho M.J. Pestina T.I. Steward S.A. Lowell C.A. Jackson C.W. Gartner T.K. Blood. 2002; 99: 2442-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Recently, Li et al. (40Li Z. Zhang G. Liu J. Stojanovic A. Ruan C. Lowell C.A. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 12559-12570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have shown that Lyn−/− platelets have little effect on primary platelet aggregation induced by thrombin but have inhibitory effect on granule secretion and thus the secretion-dependent second wave of platelet aggregation. We have found that platelet aggregation and PKC activation induced by low concentrations of AYPGKF were potentiated in Fyn-, but not in Lyn-deficient platelets compared with the wild-type platelets, whereas 2-MeSADP-induced platelet aggregation was not affected in these platelets (data not shown). Moreover, potentiation of AYPGKF-induced platelet aggregation in Fyn-deficient platelets was not significantly affected by SFK inhibitors. In addition, selective activation of G12/13 resulted in the phosphorylation of Fyn, but not Lyn. Thus, we have identified that Fyn downstream of G12/13 plays a major role in the negative regulation of platelet function, whereas Lyn is not involved in this process. However, we cannot exclude that other SFKs such as Lck, Src, Yes, Fgr, or Hck might also be involved.In conclusion, we demonstrate that SFKs downstream of G12/13, but not Gq/Gi, pathways negatively regulate platelet responses by inhibiting intracellular Ca2+ and PKC activation through the modulation of Gq signaling pathways. Specifically, we demonstrate that Fyn plays a major role in this negatively regulatory pathway. IntroductionSrc family kinases (SFKs) 2The abbreviations used are: SFKSrc family kinase5,5′-dimethyl-BAPTA5,5′-dimethyl-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acidDMSOdimethyl sulfoxide2-MeSADP2-methylthio-ADPPARprotease-activated receptorPLCphospholipase C. are nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases that are involved in the control of a variety of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, motility, and adhesion (1Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar). There are nine members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases, which include Src, Lck, Hck, Blk, Fyn, Lyn, Yes, Fgr, and Yrk (1Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar, 2Boggon T.J. Eck M.J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7918-7927Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Earlier studies reported that both human and rodent platelets contain high levels of Src as well as Fyn, Lyn, Hck, Yes, Lck, and Fgr (3Golden A. Nemeth S.P. Brugge J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1986; 83: 852-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 4Huang M.M. Bolen J.B. Barnwell J.W. Shattil S.J. Brugge J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Among these, c-Src kinase is present in the most abundant amounts and represents about 0.2–0.4% of the total platelet protein (6Clark E.A. Shattil S.J. Brugge J.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 464-469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Although platelets contain high levels of SFKs, suggesting an important role for these enzymes in platelet function, the role of SFKs in platelet function has been complex and not fully understood. In platelets, SFKs, particularly Lyn and Fyn, play a crucial role downstream of collagen receptors (7Quek L.S. Pasquet J.M. Hers I. Cornall R. Knight G. Barnes M. Hibbs M.L. Dunn A.R. Lowell C.A. Watson S.P. Blood. 2000; 96: 4246-4253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, platelets from Fyn−/− mice exhibit delayed spreading on immobilized fibrinogen (8Reddy K.B. Smith D.M. Plow E.F. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 1641-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), whereas platelets from Lyn−/− mice spread poorly on von Willebrand factor (9Yin H. Liu J. Li Z. Berndt M.C. Lowell C.A. Du X. Blood. 2008; 112: 1139-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Moreover, c-Src has been shown to play an important role in integrin αIIbβ3-dependent outside-in signaling (10Obergfell A. Eto K. Mocsai A. Buensuceso C. Moores S.L. Brugge J.S. Lowell C.A. Shattil S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 11Shattil S.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 399-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), but Lyn has been reported to regulate integrin αIIbβ3-mediated signaling in platelets negatively (12Maxwell M.J.

It is also known that SFKs play a role in thromboxane generation (13Garcia A. Quinton T.M. Dorsam R.T. Kunapuli S.P. Blood. 2005; 106: 3410-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), shape change (14Bauer M. Maschberger P. Quek L. Briddon S.J. Dash D. Weiss M. Watson S.P. Siess W. Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 85: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), as well as regulation of phosphorylation of Akt (15Kim S. Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. Blood. 2006; 107: 947-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and ERK (16Garcia A. Shankar H. Murugappan S. Kim S. Kunapuli S.P. Biochem. J. 2007; 404: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 17Shankar H. Garcia A. Prabhakar J. Kim S. Kunapuli S.P. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2006; 4: 638-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).An important mechanism for regulation of c-Src tyrosine kinase activity is through control of its phosphorylation status. There are two major phosphorylation sites present on human c-Src, Tyr416 and Tyr527. A short C-terminal tail of SFKs contains an autoinhibitory phosphorylation site, Tyr527 (18Cooper J.A. Gould K.L. Cartwright C.A. Hunter T. Science. 1986; 231: 1431-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 19Smart J.E. Oppermann H. Czernilofsky A.P. Purchio A.F. Erikson R.L. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1981; 78: 6013-6017Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), whereas Tyr416 is a target for intermolecular autophosphorylation (19Smart J.E. Oppermann H. Czernilofsky A.P. Purchio A.F. Erikson R.L. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1981; 78: 6013-6017Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). When Tyr416 is phosphorylated, it is displaced from the substrate binding pocket, allowing the kinase access to substrates. Thus, when Tyr416 is phosphorylated, it is a positive regulator of Src activity.Shape change is considered to be the first measurable physiological response produced by platelets following exposure to an agonist. ADP-induced platelet shape change is involved in Gq-coupled calcium mobilization and the activation of RhoA (20Paul B.Z. Daniel J.L. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28293-28300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). A number of receptors can couple to G12/13 including thrombin and thromboxane A2, and platelet shape change induced by these agonists is mediated by both calcium-dependent and -independent mechanisms that occur through Gq and G12/13 pathways, respectively (20Paul B.Z. Daniel J.L. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28293-28300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). G12/13 has been shown to regulate Rho-dependent response (21Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), and G12/13-mediated shape change is abolished in the presence of the Rho kinase p160ROCK inhibitor Y27632 (22Bauer M.

Activation of phospholipase C (PLC) β2 is essential for agonist-induced physiological responses in platelets (23Brass L.F. Manning D.R. Cichowski K. Abrams C.S. Thromb. Haemost. 1997; 78: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Upon activation of PLC, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in the plasma membrane inner leaflet is hydrolyzed to diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (24Brass L.F. Hoxie J.A.

The workers, which hunt solitarily only around dusk, are able to capture a wide range of prey, including termites and agile, nocturnal insects as well as diurnal insects that are inactive at that moment of the Nyctemeron, resting on tree branches or under leaves. Prey are captured very rapidly, and the antennal palpation used by ground-dwelling ponerine species is reduced to a simple contact; stinging occurs immediately thereafter. The venom has an instant, violent effect as even large prey (up to 30 times the weight of a worker) never struggled after being stung. Only small prey are not stung. Workers retrieve their prey, even large items, singly. To capture termite workers and soldiers defending their nest entrances, ant workers crouch and fold their antennae backward. In their role as guards, the termites face the crouching ants and end up by rolling onto their backs, their legs batting the air. This is likely due to volatile secretions produced by the ants' mandibular gland. The same behavior is used against competing ants, including territorially-dominant arboreal species that retreat further and further away, so that the P. conradti finally drive them from large, sugary food sources."
https://openalex.org/W2018712739,"Background Rasburicase (Fasturtec® or Elitek®, Sanofi-Aventis), the recombinant form of urate oxidase from Aspergillus flavus, is a therapeutic enzyme used to prevent or decrease the high levels of uric acid in blood that can occur as a result of chemotherapy. It is produced by Sanofi-Aventis and currently purified via several standard steps of chromatography. This work explores the feasibility of replacing one or more chromatography steps in the downstream process by a crystallization step. It compares the efficacy of two crystallization techniques that have proven successful on pure urate oxidase, testing them on impure urate oxidase solutions. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we investigate the possibility of purifying urate oxidase directly by crystallization from the fermentation broth. Based on attractive interaction potentials which are known to drive urate oxidase crystallization, two crystallization routes are compared: a) by increased polymer concentration, which induces a depletion attraction and b) by decreased salt concentration, which induces attractive interactions via a salting-in effect. We observe that adding polymer, a very efficient way to crystallize pure urate oxidase through the depletion effect, is not an efficient way to grow crystals from impure solution. On the other hand, we show that dialysis, which decreases salt concentration through its strong salting-in effect, makes purification of urate oxidase from the fermentation broth possible. Conclusions The aim of this study is to compare purification efficacy of two crystallization methods. Our findings show that crystallization of urate oxidase from the fermentation broth provides purity comparable to what can be achieved with one chromatography step. This suggests that, in the case of urate oxidase, crystallization could be implemented not only for polishing or concentration during the last steps of purification, but also as an initial capture step, with minimal changes to the current process."
https://openalex.org/W2021060147,"Biotin carboxylase (BC) activity is shared among biotin-dependent carboxylases and catalyzes the Mg-ATP-dependent carboxylation of biotin using bicarbonate as the CO2 donor. BC has been studied extensively over the years by structural, kinetic, and mutagenesis analyses. Here we report three new crystal structures of Escherichia coli BC at up to 1.9 Å resolution, complexed with different ligands. Two structures are wild-type BC in complex with two ADP molecules and two Ca2+ ions or two ADP molecules and one Mg2+ ion. One ADP molecule is in the position normally taken by the ATP substrate, whereas the other ADP molecule occupies the binding sites of bicarbonate and biotin. One Ca2+ ion and the Mg2+ ion are associated with the ADP molecule in the active site, and the other Ca2+ ion is coordinated by Glu-87, Glu-288, and Asn-290. Our kinetic studies confirm that ATP shows substrate inhibition and that this inhibition is competitive against bicarbonate. The third structure is on the R16E mutant in complex with bicarbonate and Mg-ADP. Arg-16 is located near the dimer interface. The R16E mutant has only a 2-fold loss in catalytic activity compared with the wild-type enzyme. Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments showed that the mutation significantly destabilized the dimer, although the presence of substrates can induce dimer formation. The binding modes of bicarbonate and Mg-ADP are essentially the same as those to the wild-type enzyme. However, the mutation greatly disrupted the dimer interface and caused a large re-organization of the dimer. The structures of these new complexes have implications for the catalysis by BC.

https://openalex.org/W2160893936,"The peptide hormone somatostatin (SST) and its five G protein-coupled receptors (SSTR1-5) were described to be present in the skin, but their cutaneous function(s) and skin-specific signalling mechanisms are widely unknown. By using receptor specific agonists we show here that the SSTRs expressed in keratinocytes are functionally coupled to the inhibition of adenylate cyclase. In addition, treatment with SSTR4 and SSTR5/1 specific agonists significantly influences the MAP kinase signalling pathway. As epidermal hormone receptors in general are known to regulate re-epithelialization following skin injury, we investigated the effect of SST on cell counts and migration of human keratinocytes. Our results demonstrate a significant inhibition of cell migration and reduction of cell counts by SST. We do not observe an effect on apoptosis and necrosis. Analysis of signalling pathways showed that somatostatin inhibits cell migration independent of its effect on cAMP. Migrating keratinocytes treated with SST show altered cytoskeleton dynamics with delayed lamellipodia formation. Furthermore, the activity of the small GTPase Rac1 is diminished, providing evidence for the control of the actin cytoskeleton by somatostatin receptors in keratinocytes. While activation of all receptors leads to redundant effects on cell migration, only treatment with a SSTR5/1 specific agonist resulted in decreased cell counts. In accordance with reduced cell counts and impaired migration we observe delayed re-epithelialization in an ex vivo wound healing model. Consequently, our experiments suggest SST as a negative regulator of epidermal wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W2086156836,"Aurora-A, a centrosomal serine-threonine kinase, orchestrates several key aspects of cell division. However, the regulatory pathways for the protein stability and kinase activity of Aurora-A are still not completely understood. In this study, PUM2, an RNA-binding protein, is identified as a novel substrate and interacting protein of Aurora-A. Overexpression of the PUM2 mutant which fails to interact with Aurora-A, and depletion of PUM2 result in a decrease in the amount of Aurora-A. PUM2 physically binds to the D-box of Aurora-A, which is recognized by APC/CCdh1. Overexpression of PUM2 prevents ubiquitination and enhances the protein stability of Aurora-A, suggesting that PUM2 protects Aurora-A from APC/CCdh1-mediated degradation. Moreover, association of PUM2 with Aurora-A not only makes Aurora-A more stable but also enhances the kinase activity of Aurora-A. Our study suggests that PUM2 plays two different but important roles during cell cycle progression. In interphase, PUM2 localizes in cytoplasm and plays as translational repressor through its RNA binding domain. However, in mitosis, PUM2 physically associates with Aurora-A to ensure enough active Aurora-A at centrosomes for mitotic entry. This is the first time to reveal the moonlight role of PUM2 in mitosis."

To date, high resolution structural information about gp120 in complex with gp41 has proven intractable. In this study, we characterize the structural properties of gp120 in the presence and absence of gp41 domains by NMR. Using the peptide probe 12p1 (sequence, RINNIPWSEAMM), which was identified previously as an entry inhibitor that binds to gp120, we identify atoms of 12p1 in close contact with gp120 in the monomeric and trimeric states. Interestingly, the binding mode of 12p1 with gp120 is similar for clades B and C. In addition, we show a subtle difference in the binding mode of 12p1 in the presence of gp41 domains, i.e. the trimeric state, which we interpret as small differences in the gp120 structure in the presence of gp41."
https://openalex.org/W2037312310,"KvAP is a voltage-gated tetrameric K(+) channel with six transmembrane (S1-S6) segments in each monomer from the archaeon Aeropyrum pernix. The objective of the present investigation was to understand the plausible role of the S6 segment, which has been proposed to form the inner lining of the pore, in the membrane assembly and functional properties of KvAP channel. For this purpose, a 22-residue peptide, corresponding to the S6 transmembrane segment of KvAP (amino acids 218-239), and a scrambled peptide (S6-SCR) with rearrangement of only hydrophobic amino acids but without changing its composition were synthesized and characterized structurally and functionally. Although both peptides bound to the negatively charged phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylglycerol model membrane with comparable affinity, significant differences were observed between these peptides in their localization, self-assembly, and aggregation properties onto this membrane. S6-SCR also exhibited reduced helical structures in SDS micelles and phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylglycerol lipid vesicles as compared with the S6 peptide. Furthermore, the S6 peptide showed significant membrane-permeabilizing capability as evidenced by the release of calcein from the calcein-entrapped lipid vesicles, whereas S6-SCR showed much weaker efficacy. Interestingly, although the S6 peptide showed ion channel activity in the bilayer lipid membrane, despite having the same amino acid composition, S6-SCR was significantly inactive. The results demonstrated sequence-specific structural and functional properties of the S6 wild type peptide. The selected S6 segment is probably an important structural element that could play an important role in the membrane interaction, membrane assembly, and functional property of the KvAP channel."

Essential in pregnancy and detectable within a few days of fertilization, it has become one of the most frequently assayed hormones, and simple, one-step, antibody-based measurements of hCG are now standard in pregnancy testing. At this early stage of pregnancy, the trophoblast cells of the preimplantation embryo produce a hyperglycosylated form of the hormone, which drives embryonic implantation in the uterine wall (2Cole L.A. Placenta. 2007; 28: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Subsequently, hCG regulation by syncytiotrophoblast cells of the placenta promotes and maintains progesterone secretion from the corpus luteum.

The role of hCG as a tumor marker in a variety of cancers is of great clinical significance (3O'Connor J.F. Birken S. Lustbader J.W. Krichevsky A. Chen Y. Canfield R.E. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 650-683PubMed Google Scholar, 4Sturgeon C.M. McAllister E.J. Ann. Clin. Biochem. 1998; 35: 460-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and quantitative, specific hCG tests are important in the diagnosis and management of hCG-secreting cancers (5Gronowski A.M. Grenache D.G. Clin. Chem. 2009; 55: 1447-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, the design criteria of hCG cancer assays differ from those required for pregnancy tests. Specifically, different sensitivity ranges are involved, and, for oncology applications, the antibodies used must be able to detect various modified forms of hCG with equal affinity (6Stenman U.H. Clin. Chem. 2001; 47: 815-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The role of hCG assays in the diagnosis and management of malignant trophoblastic disease (choriocarcinoma) is one of the great success stories of oncology (7Ozturk M. Bellet D. Manil L. Hennen G. Frydman R. Wands J.R. Endocrinology. 1987; 120: 549-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 8Ozturk M. Berkowitz R. Goldstein D. Bellet D. Wands J.R. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1988; 158: 193-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar); it is the ideal tumor marker, always present when choriocarcinoma cells exist, and in quantities directly related to the number of those cells. The correct use of hCG assays in combination with appropriate therapy has led to a survival rate approaching 100% in this otherwise aggressive cancer. All hCG diagnostic tests are carried out as immunoassays, based on specific antibodies that are able to distinguish hCG from three other, closely related, members of the glycoprotein hormone family (luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)) (9Pierce J.G. Endocrinology. 1971; 89: 1331-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The α-chains of these four hormones are identical, each comprising 92 amino acids. The β-chains are hormone-specific and determine the particular activity of each hormone (10Pierce J.G. Parsons T.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 465-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1905) Google Scholar) but exhibit significant sequence homology among all four β-chains, with LH having 86%, TSH 46%, and FSH 36% commonality with the first 114 amino acids of hCG (11Lund T. Delves P.J. Rev. Reprod. 1998; 3: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Both the α- and β-chains are composed as three loops held in place by a “cysteine knot” of three disulfide bonds (1Lapthorn A.J. Harris D.C. Littlejohn A. Lustbader J.W. Canfield R.E. Machin K.J. Morgan F.J. Isaacs N.W. Nature. 1994; 369: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, 12Wu H. Lustbader J.W. Liu Y. Canfield R.E. Hendrickson W.A. Structure. 1994; 2: 545-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). These similarities in sequence and structure, especially within the quartet of the glycoprotein protein hormones (hCG, LH, TSH, FSH), make stringent demands of antibody specificity when immunoassays are used to distinguish among the different molecules. To ensure high fidelity in hCG detection and quantification, rigorous antibody characterization and selection are essential and, for this reason, much attention has been paid to hCG epitope structure as it relates to the specificity of antibody binding to the various hCG isoforms. The diagnostic value of any hCG immunoassay depends totally on the properties of the antibody around which the assay is built. Previous analysis of the hCG epitope structure (13Berger P. Sturgeon C. Bidart J.M. Paus E. Gerth R. Niang M. Bristow A. Birken S. Stenman U.H. Tumor Biol. 2002; 23: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) focused on the assignment of epitopes to the three-dimensional structure of hCG, together with a clear linkage to identified monoclonal antibodies. However, a wide range of hCG variants exists, differing both in glycosylation state and fragment size (3O'Connor J.F. Birken S. Lustbader J.W. Krichevsky A. Chen Y. Canfield R.E. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 650-683PubMed Google Scholar, 14Elliott M.M. Kardana A. Lustbader J.W. Cole L.A. Endocrine. 1997; 7: 15-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Birken S. Armstrong E.G. Kolks M.A.G. Cole L.A. Agosto G.M. Krichevsky A. Vaitukaitis J.L. Canfield R.E. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 572-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This heterogeneity poses a major obstacle to the development of a quantitative universal immunoassay for hCG (16Sturgeon C.M. Berger P. Bidart J.M. Birken S. Burns C. Norman R.J. Stenmanm U.H. Clin. Chem. 2009; 55: 1484-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), especially because many hCG epitopes depend on the molecule being intact and/or in its native conformation (11Lund T. Delves P.J. Rev. Reprod. 1998; 3: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). An assay architecture built around a single epitope site is preferred because a two-site assay (double antibody sandwich) could result in more false negative results due to the doubled risk of one of the necessary epitopes being absent in a hCG variant (17Mitchell H. Seckl M.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2007; 260–262: 310-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, the performance of a single site assay depends on the identity and nature of the chosen epitope, and it is crucial that it is present, intact and correctly folded in every hCG variant encountered. It is against this background that the β3-loop of hCGβ66–80 (Fig. 1b) has been identified as a potentially ideal epitope on which to base universal, single site hCG assays. This loop is present in all known variants of hCG, and we postulate that it might have its own, self-contained secondary structural features that are retained, regardless of the conformation or fragmentation state of the rest of the molecule. It is suggested here that this local structure provides the basis for antibodies against this epitope to bind with similar affinity to any known hCG variant, as long as the relevant linear sequence remains accessible. Peptides were synthesized with Fmoc chemistry on TGA resin (Merck Chemicals) using a Liberty Microwave Synthesizer (CEM). Completed peptide resins were cleaved in 95% TFA (Rathburn), 2.5% water, and 2.5% trisopropylsilane (Sigma) for 2 h, and recovered TFA liquors were dried by rotary evaporation and precipitated in cold tert-butyl methyl ether (Sigma) to afford a white solid. Freeze-dried crude peptides were purified using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC system with an Onyx C18 column (Phenomenex) and a mobile phase gradient of 5% acetonitrile/water (0.1% TFA) to 100% acetonitrile (0.1% TFA) over 8 min. Pure peptide fractions were reduced by rotary evaporation and freeze-dried from 50% acetonitrile. Purified peptides were analyzed using a C18 kinetix column (Phenomenex). Integrated peak areas typically indicated purity of 95% or above. Peptides were positively identified by electrospray mass spectrometry (Waters ZMD MK II). A range of peptide arrays were synthesized on polypropylene 455-well PEPSCAN cards using standard Fmoc chemistry. Initially, to determine which linear sequential epitopes were recognized by various antibody preparations, a library of overlapping 12-mer peptides representing the entire sequence of hCGβ was created (18Meloen R.H. Puijk W.C. Schaaper W.M.M. Lefkovits I. Immunology Methods Manual. Academic Press, San Diego1997: 982-988Google Scholar); the first well was endowed with an array of identical immobilized peptides consisting of amino acids 1–12, the second well carried peptides consisting of amino acids 2–13, the third 3–14, etc. In conjunction with further libraries constructed with longer peptides (up to 20-mer), these libraries were used to determine which host species (mouse, rabbit, or sheep) were able to produce antibodies that recognized the linear sequence of the β3-loop. From these findings a panel of candidate monoclonal antibodies with binding specificity for the β3-region was selected. These monoclonal antibodies were prepared by hybridoma techniques in the laboratories of Bioventix Ltd. (Farnham, UK). Subsequently, once the recognition of the correct sequential epitope (hCGβ66–80) had been confirmed, a positional scanning library incorporating all single natural amino acid changes across the peptide sequence SIRLPGCPRGVNPVV (of hCGβ66–80) was used. After deprotection with TFA and scavengers, the cards were washed extensively with an excess of H2O and sonicated in disrupt-buffer containing 1% SDS/0.1% β-mercaptoethanol in PBS (pH 7.2) at 70 °C for 30 min, followed by sonication in H2O for another 45 min. The binding of antibody to each peptide was tested in a PEPSCAN-based ELISA. The polypropylene cards containing the covalently linked peptides were incubated with primary antibody 8G5 (obtained from sheep) diluted in blocking solution, 4% horse serum, 5% ovalbumin (w/v) in PBS/1% Tween. After the wells had been washed, the peptides were incubated with a 1/1000 dilution of secondary antibody peroxidase conjugate for 1 h at 25 °C to detect and quantify the binding of 8G5 antibodies. After a further washing step, the peroxidase substrate 2,2′-azino-di-3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate (ABTS) and 2 μl of 3% H2O2 were added. Color development was then measured by means of a charge-coupled device camera and an image processing system, after a 1-h incubation (19Slootstra J. Puijk W.C. Ligtvoet G. Langeveld J. Meloen R.H. Mol. Divers. 1996; 1: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The peptides were dissolved directly in 10 mm phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.8), with a final concentration of 0.11 mm (0.177 mg ml−1). The peptides stock concentration was confirmed by UV-visible spectroscopy using a calculated extinction coefficient of ∈214 = 21,807 m−1 cm−1 (20Kuipers B.J.H. Gruppen H. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2007; 55: 5445-5451Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). For the samples with the fluorinated alcohol HFIP, water and 0.2 m buffer solutions were used to ensure the overall buffer concentration remained 10 mm. Far-ultraviolet CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscopic Co., Tokyo) fitted with a Peltier unit for temperature control. The spectra are the average of three accumulations in step mode (data pitch of 1 nm, response time of 8 s, bandwidth of 1 nm) acquired in rectangular cuvettes of 0.1 cm path length (Hellma GmbH, Germany) at 20 °C. For every sample, an appropriate solvent spectrum was recorded under identical conditions and subtracted from the corresponding sample spectrum. The data collected was expressed in molar ellipticity (m−1 cm−1). FTIR-attenuated total reflectance spectra were collected using a Tensor-37 FTIR spectrophotometer (Bruker Optics) equipped with a thermostatted BioATR II unit and a liquid nitrogen-cooled photovoltaic mercury cadmium tellurium detector. The spectra were analyzed using the OPUS software (Bruker Optics). Five acquisitions (128 scans, 4-cm−1 resolution) were done at different peptide concentrations. The contribution from atmospheric gases was eliminated using an algorithm provided by the OPUS software. The contribution of liquid water was subtracted from the peptide spectrum using the combination band of water, centered at 2125 cm−1, by flattening the region from 1906 to 1740 cm−1. FTIR spectra of synthetic peptides should be analyzed carefully due to the possibility of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) being present as an impurity in the sample, resulting from the reverse phase-HPLC purification step. It is important to consider TFA because it is known to absorb in the Amide I region at 1673–1680 cm−1 and can result in an overestimation of certain secondary structural elements (e.g. turns). To compensate for this, the TFA contribution is subtracted if the spectrum of a synthetic peptide presents a peak centered around 1200 cm−1 (21Valenti L.E. Paci M.B. De Pauli C.P. Giacomelli C.E. Anal. Biochem. 2011; 410: 118-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). An array of peptides was generated by performing point mutations on the structure of hCGβ66–80 obtained from Protein Data Bank ID code 1HRP (supplemental Fig. 1), varying only the coordinates of the side chain and not the backbone. From theses, unit cells were set up, which comprised a peptide sequence, 1853 water molecules and counterions to ensure charge neutrality (Table 1). The molecules were arrayed on a cubic lattice with random molecular orientations in a cubic box of length 38.2 Å. The rigid, nonpolarizable, three-site TIP3P empirical force field was used to describe the water molecules, the peptide was described by the CHARMM22 force field (22MacKerell A. Bashford D.

The system was then run for 300 ps with a time step of 0.5 fs in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble to allow for spatial relaxation. The system was then run for a further 150 ps in the canonical ensemble with a time step of 1 fs being employed before a production run of 15 ns using a time step of 2.5 fs from which all data were collected. Periodic boundary conditions were employed, and long range interactions were evaluated via Ewald summation. To analyze the structure of the peptide using molecular dynamics simulations, we have made use of Ramachandran plots and bond probability distribution functions, as used by Samuelson et al. (24Samuelson S.O. Tobias D.J. Martyna G.J. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1997; 101: 7592-7603Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The former allows for the assignment of secondary structure motifs based on dihedral angles while providing a clear illustration of the conformational space explored during the course of the simulation. The latter, on the other hand, allows for the probability distribution of selected atomic contacts as a function of interatomic separation to be assessed. Of the three species tested, only sheep were found to produce antibodies to the β3-loop, with the loop appearing to constitute an immunodominant epitope. The sequence of the β3-loop is highly conserved with hCGβ66–80 and LHβ86–100 differing by only one amino acid; asparagine (Asn) in hCG cf. aspartate (Asp) in LH (Fig. 2a). Utilizing a particular sheep monoclonal antibody designated 8G5, point mutations in peptide arrays were introduced in the sequence SIRLPGCPRGVNPVV (hCGβ66–80) to determine whether substitution of the asparagine (Asn77) residue (Fig. 2b) had an impact on the antigen-antibody binding. We found that this single amino acid difference between LH and hCG confers a substantial specificity bias to the antigen-antibody interaction (Fig. 2), in favor of hCG with all five of the monoclonal antibodies binding to this region. Careful calibration of the LH cross-reactivity (with intact LHβ and hCGβ) revealed this to be 2.5% for 8G5 (additional antibodies were tested, and this cross-reactivity was found to range between approximately 0.27% and 2.5%). Substitution involving histidine (His) was the only other mutation found to retain significant binding. In view of the potential usefulness of this particular epitope-antibody combination, we explored the structure of the β3 epitope recognized so strongly by the ovine immune system by means of a combination of experimental techniques and computer simulation in the free peptide. Additional point mutations were investigated, involving substitution of a proline (Pro78) residue (supplemental Table 2). The results revealed that binding to the monoclonal antibody 8G5 was lost. In the crystal structure of hCGβ, hCGβ66–80 is defined by two turns with β-sheet structure over the N and C termini (Fig. 1b) of the peptide. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to reveal the structure of hCGβ66–80 under aqueous conditions (supplemental Fig. 2), to establish whether the structural features found in the crystalline subunit are retained in the free peptide. The secondary structure of each residue as a function of time was analyzed utilizing the STRIDE assignment algorithms (25Heinig M. Frishman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W500-W502Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). The simulation predicted a stable turn spanning the residues Pro73–Val76, persisting over the course of the 15-ns simulation. This was consistent with the separation of the Cα (α-carbons) of these residues, for which the distributions fell within the assumed 7-Å cutoff for a turn (Fig. 4). Furthermore, bond probability distributions revealed a peak below 2.5 Å for the backbone carbonyl group of Pro73 and the backbone amine group of Val76 (Fig. 4). This distance is assumed to define a hydrogen bond that contributes to the stability of the turn.FIGURE 4Solid red line, separation of Cα in Pro73 and Val76. Dashed green line, separation between backbone carbonyl (Pro73) and amine (Val76) groups.

The STRIDE assignments were consistent with the separation of the Cα of Leu and Cys (supplemental Fig. 3a), with a notable portion of the distribution below the 7-Å cutoff. However, the corresponding hydrogen bond probability had a maximum at 3.66 Å (supplemental Fig. 3a), well above the 2.5-Å cutoff. This therefore ruled out the presence of a stabilizing hydrogen bond and may explain why the turn was only detected sporadically. Similarly, although the Cα separation between Asn77 and Val80 was below 7 Å, the corresponding donor and acceptor atoms were not within range for hydrogen bonding (supplemental Fig. 3b). No evidence for other turn types such as γ-turns (supplemental Fig. 4), α-turns (supplemental Fig. 5), and π-turns (supplemental Fig. 6) in hCGβ66–80 was found. Specifically, no atom pair presented a peak below both the 7-Å and 2.5-Å cutoffs for Cα separation and hydrogen bond, respectively. Finally, evidence of β-sheet character in the full protein (present as an initial condition in the free peptide between Arg68 and Val79) was found to anneal away very quickly. This aspect of the full protein was therefore not retained in the isolated peptide. The simulation therefore leads to a model of the free peptide in which a single stable turn coexists with other transient structures; more open and less structured than the sequence in the full β-chain. Direct experimental confirmation of such a dynamic situation is challenging, yet it is important to establish whether the simulations capture the general secondary structure of the free peptide. The measured FTIR spectra of hCGβ66–80 exhibited a broad Amide I band, indicative of the co-existence of different conformations in solution (Fig. 5a). Over the replicate measurements, the second derivative spectrum revealed bands consistent with the presence of a fractional population of turns in solution (26Byler D.M. Susi H. Biopolymers. 1986; 25: 469-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2720) Google Scholar). The position of the Amide II band (maximum at 1551 cm−1) also suggested that β-turns were present because the band was positioned at a higher frequency compared with other structural elements (27Bandekar J. Krimm S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1979; 76: 774-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The evidence for turns in the CD data is more equivocal; turns can give a variety of signatures with bands of positive or negative ellipticity at wavelengths of ∼200 nm. In particular, type II β-turns should exhibit a weak negative band at 220–230 nm, with a stronger positive band between 200 and 210 nm. Type I β-turns give CD spectra that are similar to those of an α-helix, characterized by positive ellipticity near 190 nm and two bands of negative ellipticity at longer wavelengths (28Perczel A. Fasman G.D. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 378-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). None of these typical turn signatures was observed in the far-ultraviolet CD spectra of hCGβ66–80 (Fig. 5b). Instead, the single negative ellipticity band near 200 nm was more indicative of a disordered structure, and if turns were present they occurred as a minority component of an ensemble of open conformations. To examine whether the conformational bias of the ensemble could be altered to enhance the population of a particular fold type, experiments were performed in fluorinated alcohol HFIP-water mixtures. Fluorinated co-solvents exclude water from the peptide environment, favoring the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Therefore, if a hydrogen bond is responsible for the stabilization of a particular conformation, a change in solvent conditions may shift the relative population of conformers. Far-ultraviolet CD spectra of hCGβ66–80 in 50% HFIP (v/v) were recorded (Fig. 5b). The presence of the Pro residues in the sequence of hCGβ66–80 would be expected to strongly disfavor the formation of a helical motif. Coupled with the structural preferences predicted by molecular dynamics, this observed change in the spectrum could be indicative of the stabilization of a turn motif. On the basis of these spectra, it was concluded that the secondary structure of hCGβ66–80 comprised an ensemble of open structures and turn motifs and that the simulated configurations (supplemental Fig. 2) were consistent with the experimental measurements. Experimentally, the FTIR spectra of LHβ86–100 were similar to those observed in hCGβ66–80; namely, a broad Amide I band (Fig. 5a) was found from which the second derivative spectra were consistent with turns coexisting among other motifs (26Byler D.M. Susi H. Biopolymers. 1986; 25: 469-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2720) Google Scholar). The Amide II band (maximum at 1553 cm−1) also suggested that β-turns were present (27Bandekar J. Krimm S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1979; 76: 774-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The recorded far-ultraviolet CD spectra of LHβ86–100 (Fig. 5b) also revealed a predominantly disordered structure. There were, however, detectable differences between the hCG and LH spectra (∼220 nm) implying that the single point mutation had influenced the conformational equilibrium. Far-ultraviolet CD spectra of LHβ86–100 in 50% HFIP (v/v) also suggested the stabilization of a turn motif (Fig. 5b), although potentially to a lesser degree than observed for hCGβ66–80. The weaker shoulder of negative ellipticity at 220–230 nm may be due to LHβ86–100 presenting weaker intensity than hCGβ66–80 at these wavelengths in aqueous buffer. This may be indicative of hCGβ66–80 comprising more stable turn motifs than the LHβ86–100 mutant under such conditions. Unsurprisingly, the main structural features of LHβ86–100 and hCGβ66–80 peptides were found to be similar, with each peptide comprising an ensemble of open structures and turn motifs. The experimental data, however, also revealed evidence of subtle differences arising from the point mutation, but precise secondary structure interpretation was beyond the resolution of the techniques employed. Because the molecular dynamics simulations and experiments of hCGβ66–80 were within the resolution limits of the measurements, further emphasis was placed on a secondary structure comparison based on the simulation evidence. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed (Fig. 6) on the sequence found in the LH β3-subunit peptide (Fig. 2a) to identify whether the mAb 8G5 molecular recognition mechanism and selectivity between hCG and LH were due to a structural variation induced by the single amino acid mutation. Two main differences were found: First, although both peptides were defined by a β-turn over the PRGV span; Cα separation of Pro93–Val96 distributed around 5.365 Å, and bond probability analysis for stabilizing hydrogen bond revealed a peak positioned at 2.146 Å (Fig. 7a); the type of β-turn was different for each peptide. Ramachandran angles of Pro73–Val76 (hCGβ66–80) were calculated over the last 5 ns of the simulation (Fig. 8a). The two central amino acids were found to have angles (Arg: ϕ = −75, ψ = −30; Gly: ϕ = −85, ψ = −10) that indicated a type I β-turn, defined by the two central amino acids presenting angles of −60°,−30° and −90°,0°, respectively. The torsional angles of Pro93–Val96 (Fig. 8b), however, revealed that the two central amino acids (Arg: ϕ = −60, ψ = 120; Gly: ϕ = 90, ψ = 0) represented a type II β-turn (known to present torsional angles of −60°,120° and 80°,0°, respectively).FIGURE 7Solid red line, Cα separation.

Visualization of the crystallographic structure of the hCGβ subunit (supplemental Fig. 7) reveals a hydrogen bond between the carbonyl group of the Asn77 side chain and the backbone amine group of Val79 (Fig. 9a). It is known that asparagine can form hydrogen bonds with the polypeptide backbone, for example at the start or end of an α-helix or in turn motifs in β-sheets, and such a hydrogen bond could stabilize a hairpin loop whereby the peptide is “zipped” together at each end. The substitution involving histidine would also result in a similar orientation allowing for this hydrogen bond (Fig. 9b). It is also believed that although aspartate (native in LH) is very similar to asparagine (native in hCG), such a stabilizing hydrogen bond would only be present if Asp were protonated (Fig. 9c). This seemed surprising because one would have expected the deprotonated carboxylate anion to be a prime hydrogen bond acceptor. However, due to the deprotonation, the carbon and oxygens of the carboxylate anion would be partially sp and sp2 hybridized, respectively. This would lead to the formation of two partially double bonded C-O bonds, which could be spatially locked in an orientation disfavoring such an interaction. Bond probability distributions (Fig. 9d) revealed that irrespective of the chosen time frame, hCGβ66–80 presented two peaks at 2.158 Å and 5.852 Å, indicating only transient presence of this proposed hydrogen bond. Over the entirety of the LHβ86–100 simulation, bond probability distributions revealed a peak positioned at 5.662 Å for the O−A pairing (Fig. 10a), and a peak at 5.365 Å, with a shoulder at 3.357 Å for the O−B pair (Fig. 10b). These separations fluctuated to a greater degree over the last 5 ns, with the OA− pairing presenting a double peak at 5.662 Å and 4.367 Å (Fig. 10a), whereas the O−B pairing resulted in a peak at 5.365 Å accompanied by two (more pronounced) shoulders at 4.319 Å and 3.405 Å (Fig. 10b). The transient presence and separately, absence of such a hydrogen bond in these two systems would indicate that such a structural feature might be important in rationalizing the 8G5 discrimination between hCG and LH. Other structural features of LHβ86–100 were the increase in span of the turn motif (Fig. 6), extended to include residues Asp97 and Pro98. Of potential β-turn Cα pairs that presented a peak below the assumed 7 Å threshold (supplemental Fig. 8), only Asp97–Val100 coincided with a stabilizing hydrogen bond (Fig. 7b). Visualization of the secondary structure (supplemental Fig. 9a) revealed that the sequence Pro93–Val100 appeared to comprise sequential β-turns forming an “S-bend ” motif. This second β-turn was found to present Ramachandran angles that indicated a type I β-turn (supplemental Fig. 9b). Of all other potential turns, only the Pro93–Asp97 pairing presented peaks below the 7-Å and 2.5-Å thresholds for the Cα separation and hydrogen bond, respectively (supplemental Figs. 10–12). However, the strong evidence of two β-turns spanning this sequence precludes the presence of an α-turn. Finally, evidence of β-sheet character between residues Arg88 and Val99 was found to anneal away more quickly than in hCG (Arg68 and Val79). However, it did return sporadically during the initial 3 ns of the simulation. Because the substitution involving histidine was the only such mutation found to retain significant binding to the mAb 8G5 (Fig. 2), a molecular dynamics simulation was performed on a sequence incorporating such a mutation (supplemental Fig. 13). The obvious major differences between the secondary structures was in the stability of the turn motif spanning residues Leu-Pro-Gly-Cys and in the β-sheet character between residues Arg and Val, with both structural motifs being more stable over the course of the 15-ns simulation. The Ramachandran angles of the amino acids belonging to the sequence Pro73–Val76 (supplemental Fig. 14a) indicated a type I β-turn (Arg: ϕ = −75°, ψ = −30°; Gly: ϕ = −85°, ψ = −10°). As in the hCG model, analysis of the bond probability distributions of the suspected stabilizing hydrogen bond (supplemental Fig. 14b) revealed the presence of two peaks which persisted over the simulation, suggesting that the hydrogen bond was relatively stable. Analysis of the models representative of the sequences SIRLPGCPRGVLPVV and SIRLPGCPRGVGPVV revealed the former to present a type II β-turn over the Pro-Arg-Gly-Val sequence (supplemental Fig. 15). SIRLPGCPRGVGPVV, however, was found to differ substantially from the other peptide sequences, displaying 310-helical structure over the sequence RGVGPV (supplemental Fig. 16). Further analysis also revealed that substitution of the Pro residue resulted in loss in binding for all amino acids (supplemental Table 2). If the proposed hydrogen bond was indeed functionally important, then this would suggest that the Ramachandran angles of the Pro78 residue were crucial in sustaining such a geometry. Because these mutations did not correspond to any biologically relevant systems, rationalization of this particular phenomenon will be the basis of future work. The monoclonal antibody 8G5 was found to be able to discriminate between peptides representative of the β3 loops of hCGβ and LHβ (namely hCGβ66–80 and LHβ86–100, respectively), which differ by only a single amino acid. Such a strong change in affinity resulting from a point mutation, with such a small change in chemical structure, aminocarbonyl group (Asn) for a carboxyl group (Asp), was remarkable. We therefore sought to determine whether there were structural differences between these two peptides because such variations might give insights into explaining the substantially weaker binding of the LH version of the epitope with the paratope. Over the residues Pro-Arg-Gly-Val, the type of β-turn varied; type I and II β-turn were observed in hCGβ66–80 and LHβ86–100, respectively. Compared with the results obtained experimentally, the secondary structures are consistent with an ensemble of open structures and turn motifs. The simulations of these peptides also revealed the presence of a proposed hydrogen bond clasp, present in hCGβ66–80. Because this feature is present in the crystallographic structure of the hCGβ subunit, it would suggest that such a feature is important in the stabilization of a particular turn type and thus, the molecular recognition mechanism that endows mAb 8G5 with a strong binding preference for hCGβ. In the case of LHβ86–100, neither carboxylate oxygen was found to present a peak below the assumed 2.5-Å threshold, which therefore appeared to support the hypothesis that the stabilizing hydrogen bond was not favored in the presence of the deprotonated Asp97 residue. The lack of a hydrogen bond clasp, coupled with the difference in turn type spanning the residues Pro-Arg-Gly-Val, suggests that these structural features are important in the differential molecular recognition mechanism of the mAb 8G5 between the different β subunits of hCG and LH. The presence of the hydrogen bond and type I β-turn in SIRLPGCPRGVHPVV, would appear to support the notion that the ability of 8G5 to discriminate between the β subunits of hCG and LH was due to a well defined structural difference between the two peptides. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations of SIRLPGCPRGVLPVV and SIRLPGCPRGVGPVV revealed stark contrasts in the predicted secondary structures. Because both peptide sequences showed diminished affinity for 8G5, the models suggest that any deviation from the structure shared by hCGβ66–80 and the histidine mutant would result in significant loss in binding.
