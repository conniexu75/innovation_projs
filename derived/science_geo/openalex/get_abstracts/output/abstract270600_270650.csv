https://openalex.org/W2081908598,"An experiment in an oil field at Rangely, Colorado, has demonstrated the feasibility of earthquake control. Variations in seismicity were produced by controlled variations in the fluid pressure in a seismically active zone. Precise earthquake locations revealed that the earthquakes clustered about a fault trending through a zone of high pore pressure produced by secondary recovery operations. Laboratory measurements of the frictional properties of the reservoir rocks and an in situ stress measurement made near the earthquake zone were used to predict the fluid pressure required to trigger earthquakes on preexisting fractures. Fluid pressure was controlled by alternately injecting and recovering water from wells that penetrated the seismic zone. Fluid pressure was monitored in observation wells, and a computer model of the reservoir was used to infer the fluid pressure distributions in the vicinity of the injection wells. The results of this experiment confirm the predicted effect of fluid pressure on earthquake activity and indicate that earthquakes can be controlled wherever we can control the fluid pressure in a fault zone."

It was discovered that for the past 6 years at least, aluminum oxide spheres have been the major stratospheric particulate in the size range 3 to 8 micrometers. The most probable source of the spheres is the exhaust from solid-fuel rockets."
https://openalex.org/W2080689226,The vapor pressure of water at its triple point was measured with greatly increased accuracy. The triple point was realized with newly designed equipment that enhanced the stability of the pressure and permitted any air released from solution to be removed by pumping. A diaphragm pressure transducer separated the water vapor from the helium used to transmit the pressure to the manometer. The pressure was measured with the National Bureau of Standards precision mercury manometer. The vapor pressure at the triple point was found to be 611.657 pascals with random uncertainties at the 99 percent confidence level of +/- 0.010 pascal. The systematic errors are estimated to be relatively insignificant.

The latter arise from artifacts in parts of the red image data. Among the presumably reliable features are some mare-like objects (perhaps with some internal structure), and a few rather large, bright rings. Whether the latter are ice, or arise from near-specular reflection from smooth surface features, is left for future investigation."

https://openalex.org/W2148436978,"The increase in temperature outward from the surface of a stellar photosphere can be understood by looking at the local energy balance. The relatively high-density stellar photosphere is cooled effectively by radiative energy loss penetrating the optically thin corona. For the low-density chromosphere and corona, if the energy input cannot be balanced by radiative energy losses, the temperature will rise steeply, possibly up to 1 million degrees or more. Coronal heating and emission appear to be strongly influenced by magnetic fields, leading to large differences in x-ray emission for otherwise similar stars. Comparatively small variations are seen in the overall chromospheric emission of stars. Chromospheres are probably mainly heated by shock-wave energy dissipation, modified by magnetic fields."

This experiment may be a useful model of plate tectonics driven by horizontal temperature gradients. Measurements of the spreading rate are made to establish the feasibility of this model."

https://openalex.org/W4210810660,"The Pittsburgh Conference on Analytical Chemistry and Applied Spectroscopy is the largest meeting devoted to chemical instrumentation in the United States, and probably the largest in the world. From 1 to 5 March, more than 7500 scientists gathered at the Cleveland Convention Center to listen to some 497 papers and to visit the booths of 324 instrument manufacturers and distributors. Another 3000 visited only the instrument exhibition. Because so many manufacturers exhibit their established instruments and introduce new ones at the Pittsburgh Conference (which is so named because it is sponsored by the Society for Analytical Chemists of Pittsburgh and the Spectroscopy Society of Pittsburgh even though it has been held in Cleveland for the past 9 years), it is an ideal place to examine trends in instrumentation and, thereby, current trends in chemistry. Many of those trends are discussed in the following stories. Other trends include the growing number of women participants. As recently as 5 years ago, there was only one woman among the manufacturer's representatives at the meeting. No figures are available this year, but women probably accounted for at least 5 percent of the sales force. Also the number of professional women visiting the exhibition was much greater than ever before. Another important trend was the enthusiasm of the visitors to the exhibition. Many of them seemed to have money in their pockets and to be ready to spend it, an indication that the instrument business-and, therefore, the physical sciences-will enjoy a year of healthy growth."
