https://openalex.org/W2069310031,"In the course of 71 days in lunar orbit, from 19 February to 3 May 1994, the Clementine spacecraft acquired just under two million digital images of the moon at visible and infrared wavelengths. These data are enabling the global mapping of the rock types of the lunar crust and the first detailed investigation of the geology of the lunar polar regions and the lunar far side. In addition, laser-ranging measurements provided the first view of the global topographic figure of the moon. The topography of many ancient impact basins has been measured, and a global map of the thickness of the lunar crust has been derived from the topography and gravity."
https://openalex.org/W2053257020,"Global topographic and gravitational field models derived from data collected by the Clementine spacecraft reveal a new picture of the shape and internal structure of the moon. The moon exhibits a 16-kilometer range of elevation, with the greatest topographic excursions occurring on the far side. Lunar highlands are in a state of near-isostatic compensation, whereas impact basins display a wide range of compensation states that do not correlate simply with basin size or age. A global crustal thickness map reveals crustal thinning under all resolvable lunar basins. The results indicate that the structure and thermal history of the moon are more complex than was previously believed."
https://openalex.org/W2089798246,"Analysis of laser altimetry data from Clementine has confirmed and extended our knowledge of nearly obliterated multiring basins on the moon. These basins were formed during the early bombardment phase of lunar history, have been filled to varying degrees by mare lavas and regional ejecta blankets, and have been degraded by the superposition of large impact craters. The Mendel-Rydberg Basin, a degraded three-ring feature over 600 kilometers in diameter on the lunar western limb, is about 6 kilometers deep from rim to floor, only slightly less deep than the nearby younger and much better preserved Orientale Basin (8 kilometers deep). The South Pole-Aitken Basin, the oldest discernible impact feature on the moon, is revealed as a basin 2500 kilometers in diameter with an average depth of more than 13 kilometers, rim crest to floor. This feature is the largest, deepest impact crater yet discovered in the solar system. Several additional depressions seen in the data may represent previously unmapped ancient impact basins."
https://openalex.org/W2092194227,"The ultraviolet-visible camera on the Clementine spacecraft obtained high-spatial resolution images of the moon in five spectral channels. Impact craters mapped with these multispectral images show a scale of lithologic diversity that varies with crater size and target stratigraphy. Prominent lithologic variations (feldspathic versus basaltic) occur within the south wall of Copernicus (93 kilometers in diameter) on the scale of 1 to 2 kilometers. Lithologic diversity at Tycho (85 kilometers in diameter) is less apparent at this scale, although the impact melt of these two large craters is remarkably similar in this spectral range. The lunar surface within and around the smaller crater Giordano Bruno (22 kilometers in diameter) is largely dominated by the mixing of freshly excavated material with surrounding older soils derived from a generally similar feldspathic lithology."
https://openalex.org/W2091250268,"This is a commentary on global circulation model experiments of moisture source changes in Greenland, urging caution in how they are applied because they have important implications for paleoclimate reconstruction from ice cores. The work comes from preliminary find is of a ice core (GISP2) of the authors. The authors conclude that at present anomalies in Greenland ice core records should not be interpreted solely in terms of source region variations. The combined use of oxygen 18, D and ionic species in the new Summit, Greenland cores should make it possible to answer empirically some of the questions raised by the GCM experiments as to the interpretation of oxygen 18 records in terms of temperature. 4 refs., 1 fig."
https://openalex.org/W2082653137,"When high pressure (250 to 300 kilobars) was applied suddenly (shock-loading) to gabbro, the plagioclase was transformed to a noncrystalline phase (maskelynite) by a solid-state reaction at a low temperature, while the proxene remained crystalline. The shock-loaded gabbro resembles meteorites of the shergottite class; this suggests that the latter formed as a result of shock. The shock-loading of gabbro at 600 to 800 kilobars raised the temperature above the melting range of the plagioclase."
https://openalex.org/W2088436981,"Multispectral and topographic data acquired by the Clementine spacecraft provide information on the composition and geologic history of the Aristarchus region of the moon. Altimetry profiles show the Aristarchus plateau dipping about 1° to the north-northwest and rising about 2 kilometers above the surrounding lavas of Oceanus Procellarum to the south. Dark, reddish pyroclastic glass covers the plateau to average depths of 10 to 30 meters, as determined from the estimated excavation depths of 100- to 1000-meter-diameter craters that have exposed materials below the pyroclastics. These craters and the walls of sinuous rilles also show that mare basalts underlie the pyroclastics across much of the plateau. Near-infrared images of Aristarchus crater reveal olivine-rich materials and two kilometer-sized outcrops of anorthosite in the central peaks. The anorthosite could be either a derivative of local magnesium-suite magmatism or a remnant of the ferroan anorthosite crust that formed over the primordial magma ocean."

https://openalex.org/W2023621027,"The Clementine mission has provided the first comprehensive set of high-resolution images of the south pole region of the moon. Within 5 degrees of latitude of the pole, an area of an estimated 30,000 square kilometers remained in shadow during a full lunar rotation and is a promising target for future exploration for ice deposits. The Schrödinger Basin (320 kilometers in diameter), centered at 75 degrees S, is one of the two youngest, least modified, great multiring impact basins on the moon. A large maar-type volcano localized along a graben within the Schrödinger Basin probably erupted between 1 and 2 billion years ago."

https://openalex.org/W2033198034,"The distribution of elevations on the moon determined by Clementine deviates strongly from a normal distribution, suggesting that several geologic processes have influenced the topography. The hypsograms for the near side and far side of the moon are distinctly different, and these differences correlate with differences in composition as determined by Apollo orbital geochemistry, Clementine global multispectral imaging, and ground-based spectroscopy. The hypsograms and compositional data indicate the presence of at least five compositional-altimetric units. The lack of fill of the South Pole-Aitken Basin by mare basalts suggests poor production efficiency of mare basalt in the mantle of this area of the moon."
https://openalex.org/W1966851256,"Planarians show long-lasting reversible decrease of responses to a photic stimulus repeated 25 times each day. This habituation was found to be significantly faster in regenerated offspring of previously habituated planarians, and was also transferred by cannibalization, thus resembling light-shock conditioning. Habituation provides a new situation in which to study the somatic inheritance of learning in planarians."
https://openalex.org/W2058508147,"In natural populations of the African land snail, Limicolaria martensiana, the degree of polymorphism in color and pattern may vary with the density of the population. This could occur because predators eat the snails selectively and use past experience as a guide in finding further prey. Hence contrasting color forms may be at an advantage in dense populations where predators would have ample opportunity to learn to recognize prey."
https://openalex.org/W2070010179,"Brown and varying lemmings of the central Canadian arctic showed changes in reproduction, mortality, and the properties of the individuals over a 4-year period of fluctuating population. These changes were not due to starvation or malnutrition, nor were there any obvious symptoms of stress. They may have been associated with changes in the behavior of the animals."
https://openalex.org/W2015608361,"The beta-activity of fission products in surface air are analyzed in a diagram, with latitude and time as coordinates. Spring-season maxima and spread of new debris are readily discerned. Debris from 1961 Soviet testing, traveling by way of the upper troposphere or the stratosphere, arrived at 16 degrees to 35 degrees S more than a month before debris transported through the troposphere. A maximum lateral-diffusion coefficient of about 4 x 10(5) m(2) sec(-1) is implied for the tropical troposphere, and a much larger value in middle and high latitudes. Debris in the troposphere from United States testing at 2 degrees N spread mostly into the southern hemisphere."

That this properly and necessarily involves it deeply in the publication of the results of research, government and non-government, is underlined in the following pair of paragraphs from a recently issued report of the President's Science Advisory Committee."

https://openalex.org/W2033563305,"American university presses, despite a narrow view of their duties and serious undercapitalization, have survived and have grown significantly in performance and in number. Their future development rests heavily on their capacity for making changes in policy and for implementing these changes. Therefore, let us hope, (i) that university presses will serve all fields of scholarly inquiry, including science and technology, responsively and equitably, (ii) that university presses will recognize their responsibilities for encouraging pedagogical, as well as scholarly, experimentation; (iii) that university presses, with the support of their universities, will establish a firm policy of increasing their capitalization through earned surplus; and (iv) that university presses will maintain their strong affiliation with other educational publishers but will base their associational relationships on a clearly defined view of their own mission and then proudly defend their progress toward its achievement."
