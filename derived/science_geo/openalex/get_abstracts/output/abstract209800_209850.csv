https://openalex.org/W2078249001,"The macroscopically steady flow of human blood at varying hematocrit values and flow rates through small glass capillaries has been studied by following in detail the motion of individual erythrocytes. At the microscopic level the flow was found to be nonuniform and unsteady. The shape of the average velocity profile of the erythrocytes was found to be in general more blunt than the Newtonian profile, and to be affected by concentration and flow rate, particularly in the capillaries of smaller diameter."

After lesions had been made in the medial surface of the prefrontal cortex, errors of disinhibition occurred in both schedules and in association with an increased ""drive"" for food. In contrast, lesions of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex produced the disinhibition syndrome only in the group which was tested at short intertrial intervals, and no increase in food-directed activity was noticed. In each instance the postoperative recovery was very rapid. It is suggested that the quality of disinhibition in prefrontal animals is different, depending on the placement of the lesion."

https://openalex.org/W1990023233,"Amin and Mehta have claimed1 that vasicinone (I), which they obtained by aerial oxidation in sunlight of crude extracts of Adhatoda vasica or of pure vasicine (II), the shrub's main alkaloid, has a bronchodilating action. They suggested that this property is attributable to the quinazol-4-one ring system for they found it to be common to the parent substance (III) and various simple derivatives2. Vasicine, on the other hand, proved to have a bronchoconstricting action, and the bronchodilator effects variously attributed3 to preparations containing it they ascribed to contamination by small amounts of vasicinone."

https://openalex.org/W2003081119,"Lesions which interrupt the ascending limb of the midbrain-limbic circuit in the cat at different levels, or which even destroy it completely, do not prevent electroencephalographic desynchronization at the beginning of periods of deep sleep, nor do they affect the maintenance of desynchronization throughout the sleep episodes. The pontine mechanisms responsible for these electroencephalographic patterns can apparently exert their influence through ascending pathways other than those directly impinging on the hypothalamus and the limbic system."

https://openalex.org/W1968943481,"MORE than half a century has elapsed since Sir Henry Dale first described the oxytocic activity of posterior pituitary extracts1. Since that time the biological effects of the oxytocic principle have been widely investigated and well established2. Moreover, oxytocin, vasopressin, and their analogues have been characterized chemically and prepared synthetically3. Despite almost universal use of posterior pituitary preparations in clinical obstetrics few investigations have been directed toward the metabolic effects of either natural or synthetic oxytocin. Consequently, the preliminary observations presented here are of interest because they show pronounced changes in blood sugar and plasma non-esterified fatty acids after administration of oxytocin to puerperal women."

https://openalex.org/W2081539357,"BLOOD oxygen tension (Po2) may be measured polarographically by shielding the cathode with a membrane1. Existing electrodes have two types of cathode, large and small. The large cathode of 1–2 mm diameter passes a current of 1–2 µamp at a Po2of 150 mm mercury. Unfortunately reduction at the cathode produces a local zone of oxygen depletion and a steady reading can only be obtained by vigorous stirring2. Stirring inevitably requires a rather large cuvette and a blood sample which is too large for repeated estimations on the infant and small experimental animal."
