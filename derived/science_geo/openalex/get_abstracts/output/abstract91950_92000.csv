https://openalex.org/W2051353156,"A current hypothesis links the neuroexcitatory properties of certain acidic amino acids to their ability to cause selective neuronal lesions. Intracerebral injection of the neuroexcitatory tryptophan metabolite, quinolinic acid, has behavioral, neurochemical, and neuropathological consequences reminiscent of those of exogenous excitotoxins, such as kainic and ibotenic acids. Its qualities as a neurotoxic agent suggest that quinolinic acid should be considered as a possible pathogenic factor in neurodegenerative disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1997732080,"Highly purified preparations of insulin receptor catalyzed the phosphorylation of the 95,000-dalton subunit of the insulin receptor. This subunit of the insulin receptor was also labeled with [alpha-32P]8-azidoadenosine 5'-triphosphate, a photoaffinity label for adenosine triphosphate binding sites. The identity of the 95,000-dalton band was confirmed in both cases by precipitation with a monoclonal antibody to the insulin receptor. These results suggest that the insulin receptor is itself a protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1602571347,"The nonheme, or pseudo, catalase of Lactobacillus plantarum has been purified to homogeneity. This enzyme is pink in concentrated solutions and has a molecular weight of 172,000 +/- 4,000. It is composed of six noncovalently associated subunits of molecular weight 28,300 +/- 600. This pseudocatalase contains 1.12 +/- 0.37 atoms of manganese per subunit. Fe, Co, Cu, and Zn, if present at all, were at less than 0.1 atom per subunit. At pH 7.0 and at 25 degrees C the Km for H2O2 is 250 mM and the turnover number at Vm was 3.9 x 10(5) mol of H2O2 per mol of enzyme per s. The optical spectrum of pseudocatalase is similar to that of the manganese superoxide dismutase and indicates the presence of Mn(III) in the resting enzyme. Pseudocatalase does not exhibit superoxide dismutase activity nor does the manganese-containing superoxide dismutase exhibit catalase activity. This pseudocatalase is stable to freezing and thawing and lost only 40% of its activity when heated to 80 degrees C for 5 min. Strains of L. plantarum which contain pseudocatalase did not accumulate H2O2 in the growth medium."
https://openalex.org/W1575563617,"We have determined the major site of nonenzymatic glycosylation of human serum albumin in vivo. This was accomplished by reacting freshly purified human serum albumin with sodium [3H]borohydride followed by aminoethylation and tryptic digestion. The tryptic peptides were separated into a soluble fraction which contained 88% of the total 3H radioactivity and an insoluble fraction. In order to isolate the 3H-labeled glycosylated peptides, the soluble tryptic peptide fraction was first subjected to boronic acid affinity chromatography. Cation exchange chromatography then separated the soluble glycosylated peptides into a major peak which contained 48% of the total recovered 3H radioactivity and a number of minor peptide fractions. The amino acid composition of the major peptide was: Thr, Glu2, Ala, Val2, Leu2, Lys, lysino-1-deoxysorbitol. In accord with the primary structure of human serum albumin, this amino acid composition corresponds precisely to residues 525-534. Glucitol-lysine, the NH2-terminal residue of this peptide, is totally resistant to cleavage by trypsin. Thus, lysine-525 is the predominant site of nonenzymatic glycosylation of human serum albumin in vivo. Chromatography on GlycoGel B boronic acid affinity gel indicates that 10-12% of normal serum albumin is glycosylated. The rate of nonenzymatic glycosylation of this protein in vivo is approximately 9 times that of human hemoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W2091047378,"The immediate induction of the full complement of maternal behavior in nonpregnant ewes primed with estrogen and progesterone has been obtained after 5 minutes of vaginal-cervical stimulation. A similar period of such stimulation given to recently parturient ewes, after the development of selective bonding to their own lambs, reversed their rejection behavior of alien lambs and produced a state of plasticity in maternal behavior, such that ewes receiving vaginal stimulation would accept and adopt alien lambs. These findings implicate vaginal-cervical stimulation as playing a role in the onset of maternal behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1533358314,"Ornithine decarboxylase was purified from kidneys of androgen-treated mice to a greater than 95% purity. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed charge heterogeneity in the enzyme (pI 4.7-4.9) which was observed both by protein staining and by covalent labeling with [3H]alpha-difluoromethylornithine. Antibodies raised in rabbits inhibited the activity of the enzyme, formed a single rocket in crossed immunoelectrophoresis, and bound [3H]alpha-difluoromethylornithine-labeled enzyme as well as [125I]iodoornithine decarboxylase. A sensitive radioimmunoassay for the enzyme was established; the minimal detectable enzyme concentration was 0.1 ng/assay tube that corresponded to about 0.1-0.2 ng/mg of cytosol protein. The antiserum cross-reacted with enzymes from different tissues from mouse, rat, hamster, and human. Immunoreactive ornithine decarboxylase concentration in renal cytosol of male mice was 13-fold higher than that in the females (36.2 +/- 2.7 versus 2.8 +/- 0.2 ng/mg of cytosol protein; mean +/- S.E.); treatment with testosterone implants for 5-7 days increased the concentration to 522 +/- 66 ng/mg of protein. After administration of a single dose of testosterone (10 mg) to female mice, an increased immunoreactive ornithine decarboxylase concentration was detected as soon as 2 h, and rose sharply between 8 and 24 h after steroid administration. These changes were similar to those seen by assays of the catalytically active enzyme. The half-life of immunoreactive ornithine decarboxylase in mouse kidney, as measured after inhibition of protein synthesis in vivo by cycloheximide administration, was 16 min in nontreated and 140 min in androgen-treated male animals, while the corresponding values for the catalytically active enzyme were 9 and 90 min."
https://openalex.org/W1570288165,"In cells exposed to glucocorticoids at 37 degrees C activated glucocorticoid-receptor complexes (complexes with affinity for nuclei and DNA) are formed after nonactivated complexes. Activation thus appears to be an obligatory physiological process. To investigate this process we have characterized cytoplasmic complexes formed in rat thymocytes at 0 and 37 degrees C. Complexes in cytosols stabilized with molybdate were analyzed by sucrose gradient centrifugation and by chromatography on DNA-cellulose, DEAE-cellulose, and agarose gels. Two major complexes were observed: the nonactivated complex, eluted from DEAE at approximately 200 mM KCl, was formed at 0 and 37 degrees C, gave S20,w = 9.2 S, Stokes radius = 8.3 nm, and calculated Mr = 330,000; the activated complex, eluted from DEAE at approximately 50 mM KCl, appeared only at 37 degrees C, gave S20,w = 4.8 S, Stokes radius = 5.0 nm, and Mr = 100,000. A third, minor complex, probably mero-receptor, which appeared mainly at 37 degrees C, bound to neither DNA nor DEAE, and gave S20,w = 2.9 S, Stokes radius = 2.3 nm, and Mr = 27,000. With three small columns in series (DNA-cellulose, DEAE-cellulose and hydroxylapatite), the three complexes can be separated in 5-10 min. By this method we have examined the stability of complexes under our conditions. We conclude that in intact thymus cells glucocorticoid-receptor complexes occur principally in two forms, nonactivated and activated, and that activation is accompanied by a large reduction in size. The origin of the mero-receptor complex remains uncertain."
https://openalex.org/W2053059003,Activation of adenylate cyclase by a stable guanosine 5'-triphosphate analog was augmented in brain membrane preparations from rats treated on a long-term basis with tricyclic antidepressants or electroconvulsive shock. These treatments may facilitate cyclase activation by promoting the interaction of the regulatory and catalytic subunits of the enzyme. This finding suggests a possible mechanism for the changes in sensitivity to various neurotransmitters seen after antidepressant administration.
https://openalex.org/W1628915423,"A higher molecular weight precursor (Mr = 39,000) to the liver mitochondrial matrix enzyme, ornithine carbamyltransferase (Mr = 36,000), is imported and processed by heart mitochondria in vitro in a manner similar to liver mitochondria. In both systems, however, an additional 37-kDa ornithine carbamyltransferase polypeptide appears, but this arises from nonspecific events and, therefore, does not represent a bona fide intermediate in the overall processing sequence. Our experiments demonstrate that the outer mitochondrial membrane of mitochondria contains a protease-sensitive (5 micrograms of trypsin or chymotrypsin/ml, 15 min at 2 degrees C), salt-resistant (1.0 M KCl) protein which is required to maintain import functions. In addition, functional post-translational import requires a component of the reticulocyte lysate (i.e. cytosol) that is used for initially synthesizing precursor enzyme. The component is retained by Sephadex G-25. Import of Sephadex G-25-excluded precursor is restored by fresh reticulocyte lysate but not by a combination of other additives, including Mg2+, K+, ATP, ADP, Pi, succinate, and total translation mixture (minus lysate)."

No emission was observed when heat-inactivated enzyme was used or when Br- or H2O2 was deleted from the system. The chemiluminescence was increased by a factor of 42 +/- 5 (mean +/- S.E.) in 98% 2H2O. These results are strong evidence for the production of 1O2 in this system."

Under various states of adaptation, the spectral sensitivity of the chromatic mechanism detecting middle- and long-wavelength lights corresponds with that deduced from suprathreshold red/green hue equilibriums."
https://openalex.org/W1976019783,"Our concept of intelligence has been heavily influenced by the development of intelligence tests as screening devices in education and personnel selection. An alternative approach is to begin with a theory of the process of cognition and identify those aspects of individual mental performance that should be important on theoretical grounds. Three classes of performance have been identified. These deal with a person's choice of an internal representation for a problem, strategies for manipulating the representation, and abilities to execute elementary information processing steps required by the strategy."
https://openalex.org/W1549306478,"The monomeric form of the acetylcholine receptor from torpedo is composed of five, membrane-spanning chains with the stoichiometry alpha 2 beta gamma delta. The native receptor is predominantly a dimer cross-linked by a disulfide bridge between delta chains. We reduced native dimer to monomer and generated a different dimer by diamide-induced disulfide formation specifically between beta chains. Purified beta-beta cross-linked dimer, when adsorbed to a carbon film and negatively stained, appears in the electron microscope as two contiguous disks, frequently with central, stain-filled pits; i.e. it looks like native receptor in situ viewed normal to the plane of the membrane. We take the region of closest approach of the disks to mark the portions of the beta chains involved in the cross-link. In addition, we tagged the acetylcholine binding sites (one on each alpha chain) for electron microscopic identification, using a complex of monobiotinylated cobratoxin and avidin. Based on the locations of avidins bound to the beta-beta cross-linked dimer, the two toxin binding sites/monomer appear to be separated on the average by 110 degrees, as measured between lines from the center of the monomer to the centers of the avidins. One toxin binding site appears close to the beta-beta cross-link and the other close to the end of the monomer opposite to the cross-link; these locations are similar to the locations of the toxin binding sites relative to the delta-delta cross-link in native dimer. On the assumptions that the chains are compact units and are arranged in a unique order around the central pit, we interpret these results as indicating that the alpha chains are not contiguous and that neither the beta chain nor the delta chain lies between them. Therefore, the arrangement of the chains most easily reconciled with our assumptions and observations is alpha gamma alpha beta delta."
https://openalex.org/W1555039664,"1-O-[3H]Alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-acetyl-GPC) incubated with rabbit polymorphonuclear leukocytes was metabolized to 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-GPC containing long chain groups at the 2 position. Within 5 min, 60% of the total label added to the cell suspension was found in the 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-acyl-GPC. At earlier time points, 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-lyso-GPC was present. No metabolites were detected that would indicate the ether bond had been cleaved or the polar head group had been altered by the cells. At subaggregating and subdegranulating concentrations of labeled 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-acyl-GPC, the same pattern of product formation was observed. Furthermore, when 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-lyso-GPC was added to the cells, it was taken up and acylated in the same manner as that from 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-GPC. The nature of the long chain acyl residues incorporated into the 2 position was then examined by argentation chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography. Argentation chromatography of 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-acyl-3-acetylglycerols obtained from 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-acyl-GPC after acetolysis indicated that mono-, di-, and tetraenoic fatty acids were the predominant molecular species being incorporated into the 2 position of the molecule (18, 55, and 18%, respectively). Furthermore, high performance liquid chromatographic analysis using synthetic 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-GPC standards indicated that three fatty acids, linoleic, arachidonic, and oleic (50, 15, and 12%, respectively), were the major chains being incorporated into the 1-O-hexadecyl-linked species. Analysis of 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-acyl-GPC derived from exogenously added 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-lyso-GPC revealed the same distribution of acyl groups linked to the 2 position. The findings are consistent with a pathway in which two enzymatic activities are responsible for the metabolism of exogenous platelet-activating factor in the rabbit neutrophils: one that hydrolyzes the acetyl residue (acetylhydrolase) and another that transfers a fatty acyl chain to the 1-O-alkyl-2-lyso-GPC formed (possibly acyl-CoA:1-O-alkyl-2-lyso-GPC acyltransferase). These events appear to play an important role in inactivating this potentially lethal phospholipid."
https://openalex.org/W1993500239,"The mouse liver microsomal mixed-function oxidase system converts several phosphorothiolate pesticides with S-ethyl, S-propyl, or S-butyl groups to more potent inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase. This activation is stereospecific for the chiral isomers of O-(4-bromo-2-chlorophenyl) O-ethyl S-propyl phosphorothiolate (profenofos insecticide); the more toxic (-) isomer becomes a 34-fold better inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase in vitro, whereas the less toxic (+) isomer is deactivated by a factor of 2. Prior treatment of the microsomes with piperonyl butoxide or another mixed-function oxidase inhibitor markedly decreases the activation. Piperonyl butoxide also protects against brain acetylcholinesterase inhibition and cholinergic symptoms in chicks resulting from (-)-profenofos administration, thus establishing the importance of the oxidative bioactivation of S-alkyl phosphorothiolate pesticides in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1542855652,"The platelet plasma membrane serotonin transporter requires Na+ for two reactions, serotonin transport and imipramine binding. Although imipramine binding has been thought to reflect the same process required for serotonin binding prior to transport (Talvenheimo, J., Nelson, P.J., and Rudnick, G. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 4631-4635), binding and transport display markedly different responses to Na+. Imipramine binding (and competitive inhibition of transport) apparently requires two sodium ions which bind with a KD of 300 +/- 70 meq/liter. The total number of sites (Bmax) is the same at all Na+ concentrations, but the affinity for imipramine increases from 7.3 x 10(6) M-1 at 20 meq/liter to 110 x 10(6) M-1 at 200 meq/liter. Na+ acts, at least in part, by decreasing the rate of imipramine dissociation from its binding site. Serotonin binding displaces imipramine from its site on the membrane. In contrast to imipramine binding, this displacement is a simple, hyperbolic function of Na+ concentration with a KD for Na+ of 400 +/- 100 meq/liter, which suggests that only one Na+ is required. Serotonin transport is also much less responsive to Na+ concentration. Over the same concentration range in which the affinity for imipramine increases 15-fold, the affinity for serotonin increases only 2-fold. Despite the lack of Na+ effect on the Bmax for imipramine binding, the Vmax for serotonin transport increases as a simple saturable function of Na+ with a KM (Na+) of 52 meq/liter. Thus, substrate translocation as well as binding requires Na+. Since serotonin is cotransported with Na+, the serotonin gradient accumulated depends on the coupling stoichiometry and the magnitude of the Na+ gradient imposed. From the response of the serotonin gradient to imposed Na+ gradients, we calculated a serotonin:Na+ cotransport stoichiometry of 0.9. Taken together, the results suggest that serotonin and imipramine bind either to the same site or to mutually exclusive sites, but maximal imipramine binding requires two sodium ions, while maximal serotonin binding and translocation requires only one."
https://openalex.org/W1552278273,"The substrate specificity of chalcone synthase, the key enzyme of flavonoid biosynthesis, was investigated. A purified enzyme preparation from cell suspension cultures of parsley (Petroselinum hortense) catalyzed chain elongations with acetate units from malonyl-CoA, using various aromatic and aliphatic CoA esters as starter molecules. Malonyl-CoA could not be replaced by malonyl acyl carrier protein in the standard chalcone synthase assay. Butyryl-CoA, hexanoyl-CoA, and benzoyl-CoA served as substrates for the condensation reaction with similar efficiency as 4-coumaroyl-CoA, the natural substrate of the enzyme. Acetyl-CoA and octanoyl-CoA were relatively poor substrates. Among the products formed with the two most efficient aliphatic substrates tested, butyryl-CoA and hexanoyl-CoA, were the respective chalcone analogues, phlorobutyrophenone and phlorocaprophenone. The possibility is discussed that chalcone synthase and the corresponding enzyme of fatty acid synthesis in higher plants, beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase, have a common evolutionary origin."
https://openalex.org/W1605414655,"The kinetic parameters for inorganic phosphate and inorganic arsenate as substrates for the synthesis of ATP and ADP-arsenate, respectively, by beef heart submitochondrial particles have been determined. The Vm and Km values for arsenate and phosphate, as well as the Km values for ADP in the two reactions, are the same within experimental error of the measurements. These data are consistent with covalent bond formation not being the rate-limiting step for either ATP or ADP-arsenate synthesis. The hydrolysis of ATP and of ADP-arsenate was studied under conditions of net synthesis of ATP or ADP-arsenate. The apparent first order rate constant for ATP hydrolysis increased with submitochondrial particle concentration, indicating that hydrolysis of ATP was catalyzed by the submitochondrial particle preparation. Nonenzymic hydrolysis of ATP was negligible compared to enzymic hydrolysis. The apparent first order rate constant for ADP-arsenate hydrolysis did not vary with submitochondrial particle concentration, indicating that ADP-arsenate hydrolysis was nonenzymic. Enzymic hydrolysis of ADP-arsenate was too slow, compared with its rapid nonenzymic hydrolysis, to be detected. The first order rate constant for ADP-arsenate hydrolysis at pH 7.5, 30 degrees C, was determined to be greater than 5 min-1 and was estimated to be 70 min-1. These data confirm previous suggestions that arsenate uncouples oxidative phosphorylation by a mechanism involving synthesis of ADP-arsenate, followed by its rapid nonenzymic hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W105110622,"The precursor of rat liver ornithine carbamoyltransferase (EC 2.1.3.3) synthesized in vitro was taken up and processed to the mature enzyme by isolated rat liver mitochondria. Potassium ion, magnesium ion, and a reticulocyte cytosolic protein(s), in addition to the precursor and the mitochondria, were required for maximal transport and processing of the precursor. The concentrations of potassium and magnesium ions required for maximal transport and processing were about 120 and 0.8-1.6 mM, respectively. Dialyzed postribosomal supernatant of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (36 mg of protein/ml), in combination with potassium and magnesium ions, stimulated the transport and processing severalfold. The stimulatory activity of the dialyzed lysate was inactivated by trypsin treatment or heating at 100 degrees C for 2 min. No significant amount of the precursor was associated with the mitochondria when incubation was performed in the absence of these components. These results suggest that potassium ion, magnesium ion, and a reticulocyte cytosolic protein(s) stimulate the binding and transport of the ornithine carbamoyltransferase precursor to the mitochondria. Dialyzed supernatant of rabbit erythrocyte lysate was equally effective in stimulating the precursor transport and processing, and a dialyzed cytosol fraction of Ehrlich ascites cells was partly stimulatory. On the other hand, dialyzed cytosol fractions of rat liver and rat kidney, and dialyzed supernatant of wheat germ extracts did not stimulate the precursor transport and processing but rather inhibited it."
https://openalex.org/W2096510653,"Speract (Gly-Phe-Asp-Leu-Asn-Gly-Gly-Gly-Val-Gly), a Tyr analogue (Tyr-Asp-Leu-Asn-Gly-Gly-Gly-Val-Gly), carboxyl-terminal fragment (Gly-Gly-Gly-Val-Gly), and an NH2-terminal fragment (Gly-Phe-Asp-Leu-Asn-Gly-Gly-Gly) were tested for their effects on sea urchin sperm respiration and net H+ efflux. The stimulation of net H+ efflux by these peptides was highly correlated with their ability to stimulate cell respiration rates. At an extracellular pH of 6.6, the release of approximately 2.5 ng ions of H+/mg of sperm caused a 1.3 ng atoms of O/min/mg of sperm increase in the respiration rate, independent of the peptide used. As the extracellular pH was raised toward pH 7.5, a much larger stimulation of respiration occurred with a given amount of H+ efflux. The converse was true when the pH was lowered to pH 6.0. Narasin caused a net H+ influx or net H+ efflux dependent on the extracellular pH; respiration rates were increased under conditions of narasin-induced net H+ efflux and were decreased under conditions of net H+ influx. Weak bases (NH3 or Tris) stimulated sperm respiration, whereas a weak acid (acetic) inhibited sperm respiration rates at constant extracellular pH. Ammonia or speract counteracted the acetic acid inhibition, but speract failed to further stimulate spermatozoa in the presence of ammonia. Raising the extracellular pH also stimulated spermatozoa, and such elevations were shown to increase the intracellular pH. These data suggest that sea urchin sperm respiration rates can be regulated by the intracellular pH and that speract (and analogues) stimulate sperm respiration by primary effects on H+ efflux."
https://openalex.org/W1617067402,"A family of proline-rich proteins which contain over 40% proline and a glycoprotein were isolated from submandibular glands of isoproterenol-treated rats by extraction with 10% trichloroacetic acid and fractionation of the acid-soluble portion on Bio-Gel A-1.5m. The proline-rich proteins were subsequently separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were detected by formaldehyde fixation and Coomassie staining. After elution from the gels, amino acid compositions were determined. The family of proline-rich proteins (about six) appears to be qualitatively identical with a family of proteins from parotid glands of isoproterenol-treated rats (Muenzer J., Bildstein, C., Gleason, M., and Carlson, D. M. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 5623-5628, 5629-5634), except for a substantial change in the relative amount of each protein. An acid-soluble glycoprotein (GP-158) was not detected in extracts of submandibular glands of normal rats, but GP-158 was highly induced by isoproterenol treatment. This glycoprotein has an apparent Mr = 158,000 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The major amino acids were Asx, 13%; Glx, 18%; Pro, 29% and Gly, 11%. GP-158 contained about 37% carbohydrate, and its sugar composition on a molar basis was mannose, 3.0; galactose, 2.1; N-acetylglucosamine, 3.5; fucose, 1.2; and sialic acid (N-glycolyl(4-O-acetyl)neuraminic acid), 0.9. N-Acetylgalactosamine was not detected. A glycopeptide isolated from GP-158 had the same sugar composition as GP-158. The amino acid sequence of the glycopeptide was shown to be Asp-Gly-(Asn)-Gln-Thr-Gln-Pro-Arg-Pro-(Gly-Pro). Only the parotid and submandibular glands of rats responded in this dramatic fashion to isoproterenol. The isoproterenol-treated rat is considered an appropriate model system for studying the overall effects of catecholamine beta-agonists on gene expression in these secretory tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2082802597,"A model for studying the growth of primary tumors of human endometrium and its regulation by 17 beta-estradiol has been developed in which ovariectomized nude mice are used as recipients. The receptors for sex steroids are maintained during serial transplantation of the tumor in this system. Although the rate of growth of receptor-negative endometrial tumors transplanted into ovariectomized nude mice is unaffected by the sustained presence or absence of estradiol, the growth of receptor-positive tumors is significantly increased by estradiol. Receptor-positive tumors treated with estradiol produced elevated concentrations of progesterone receptor. That the progesterone receptor is functional in this tumor is evident from the induction of estradiol 17 beta-dehydrogenase activity upon progestin administration. These findings are consistent with receptor-mediated regulation of growth of endometrial carcinoma."

https://openalex.org/W1574614093,"5'-S-Methylthioadenosine is converted to methionine in mammalian systems, microorganisms and plants. 5'-S-Methylthioadenosine is first converted to 1-phospho-5-S-methylthioribofuranoside (1-PMTR) which is then converted to 2-keto-4-S-methylthiobutyrate, the precursor of methionine. We have now investigated the conversion of 1-PMTR to the keto acid. This conversion requires at least three protein fractions designated A, B, and C. Fraction A catalyzes an isomerization of 1-PMTR to form 1-phospho-5-S-methylthioribulose. The identification of this compound is based in part on the products obtained after NaIO4 oxidation, i.e. S-methylthioacetaldehyde, formate, and phosphoglycolic acid. When fractions A and B are added to 1-PMTR, two additional compounds, designated II and III, were detected. No O2 was consumed in the formation of compounds II and III. These compounds are, therefore, at the oxidation state of 5-S-methylthioribose. Compound II is phosphorylated as evidenced by its electrophoretic behavior before and after alkaline phosphatase treatment. Addition of fraction C to compounds II and III leads to O2 consumption and to the conversion of these compounds to 2-keto-4-S-methylthiobutyrate. Thus, compounds II and III are precursors of the keto acid. These compounds have not been fully characterized."

https://openalex.org/W1524821930,"Sulfite oxidase from Thiobacillus novellus has been purified 206-fold. The enzyme reduced both ferricyanide and cytochrome c. The ferricyanide activity was 3-5% of the cytochrome c activity. During purification, the absorbance ratio of A413 nm/A280 nm showed a continual increase, suggesting the presence of heme in the T. novellus sulfite oxidase molecule. The absorption spectrum of the enzyme is very similar to that of rat liver sulfite oxidase which contains cytochrome b5 type heme. Gel electrophoresis of the purified protein in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate revealed a protein staining band of approximately 41,000 Da. Gel filtration chromatography of the enzyme in aqueous media indicated a molecular weight of 38,000. These results suggest that T. novellus sulfite oxidase is a monomer of approximately 40,000 Da. Moreover, analysis of the visible absorption spectrum of the purified enzyme and the co-elution of 413 and 280 nm absorbing material during high pressure liquid chromatography gel chromatography provided clear evidence for the presence of heme in T. novellus sulfite oxidase. EPR spectroscopy of the enzyme revealed a characteristic molybdenum spectrum, which was observed only in the presence of sulfite. Analysis of the T. novellus sulfite oxidase molybdenum cofactor showed a fluorescence spectrum indistinguishable from that displayed by the molybdenum cofactor of chicken liver sulfite oxidase. Therefore, it is concluded that T. novellus sulfite oxidase is a monomeric (Mr approximately 40,000) molybdohemoprotein."

https://openalex.org/W105178807,"In order to develop a molecular approach of the thermogenesis mechanism in brown adipose tissue, cell-free translation was performed with mRNA obtained from control or thermoactive brown adipose tissue. Alterations were observed on analysis of the newly synthesized proteins and in particular at the 32,000 dalton level. Experiments using antibodies against the purified characteristic 32,000-dalton uncoupling protein of brown fat mitochondria were carried out. They indicated that the uncoupling protein was synthesized in the reticulocyte lysate with the same apparent molecular weight as the mature form. It is suggested that the development of the thermogenic capacity of brown fat cells is accompanied by an increase in specific mRNA coding for the uncoupling mitochondrial protein and that such a system could be an interesting one for study of mitochondrial membrane biogenesis."

After this treatment, an increase in extracellular calcium resulted in a transient net outward sodium flux against its electrochemical gradient and in net cellular uptake of calcium. It is concluded that the free energy for the net outward sodium movement was derived from the increased calcium gradient and that these ion movements took place through the sodium-calcium exchange. While in the normal physiological state the sodium-calcium exchange produces calcium extrusion from the cell, these experiments demonstrate its reversibility."

Intact nuclei showed a fourth thermal transition at a lower temperature and different melting enthalpies for the other three transitions still present at temperatures similar to those obtained in isolated chromatin. The data are discussed in terms of the tertiary, quaternary, and quinternary structures of chromatin DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1510701081,"The fatty acyl substrate specificity for de novo diglyceride, triglyceride, and phospholipid synthesis in cultured hepatocytes was evaluated. The fatty acyl availability for diglyceride and phospholipid synthesis is restricted to fatty acids longer than myristic acid with octanoic and decanoic acids being excluded. On the other hand, octanoic and decanoic acids may serve as substrates for the diglyceride acyltransferase. Dodecanoic acid appears to occupy an intermediate position between medium and long chain fatty acids with respect to its availability as substrate for the esterification sites concerned. The availability of octanoate as a specific substrate for the diglyceride acyltransferase reaction in cultured hepatocytes enables the measurement of this activity in situ under conditions of overall triglyceride synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1706953487,"Abstract A new protein kinase of the cAMP independent type was found to be bound to the outer envelope membrane of spinach chloroplasts. While stimulated by Mg2+ and inhibited by ADP, the enzyme showed no response to conventional protein substrates and was essentially independent of pH in the physiological (pH 7 to 8) range. The new protein kinase phosphorylated the mature form of the small subunit of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase and, to a lesser extent, an unidentified 24-kDa polypeptide, both of which were bound to the outer envelope membrane. The results suggest that phosphorylation of cytoplasmically synthesized protein constituents of chloroplasts is involved in their transport through the chloroplast envelope membrane barrier."
https://openalex.org/W1533620304,"Incorporation of labeled precursors (glycerol, glucose, or 32Pi) into phosphatidylinositol (PI) was 2-3-fold higher in rat retinas incubated in light compared to those in dark. During brief (30 min) incubations with labeled glycerol, there was a selective increase in the radioactivity associated with PI and phosphatidic acid, whereas, upon longer (60 min) incubations, synthesis of other lipids was also enhanced in light. Accumulation of the precursors was similar in light or dark throughout 60 min of incubation. Phosphorylation of PI to triphosphoinositide (TPI) was also enhanced in light, and, in both light and dark, up to 40-50% of the total 32Pi incorporated was associated with TPI. A model is proposed for PI metabolism based on two pathways: 1) a PI cycle representing synthesis and turnover of PI, and 2) phosphorylation of PI to TPI and possible hydrolysis of TPI. Light stimulation was shown to enhance the synthesis of PI within the photoreceptor cell layer and truncated rods and to increase the phosphorylation of PI to TPI within the inner retina and synaptosomes. Parallel studies with retinas from Royal College of Surgeons rats with advanced photoreceptor cell degeneration and intact inner retina showed that loss of the photoreceptor cells did not affect the capacity for phosphorylation of PI to TPI, but was associated with reduced capacity for PI synthesis. These results provide evidence that light stimulation affects different pathways of PI metabolism within different cells of the retina."
https://openalex.org/W1214191767,"The following acetylenic steroids appear to be the first reported mechanism-based inhibitors of cytochrome P-450scc: 20-(1-propynyl)-5-pregnen-3 beta, 20 alpha-diol, 20-(1-hexynyl)-5-pregnen-3 beta, 20 alpha-diol, and 20-(1,5-hexadiynyl)5-pregnen-3 beta, 20 alpha-diol. Oxygen and NADPH are required for enzymatic oxidation and all three steroids yield pregnenolone as a major product. Incubation of P-450scc with 20-(1,5-hexadiynyl)-5-pregnen-3 beta, 20 alpha-diol under turnover conditions completely inactivates the enzyme with a half-time of 11 min. The partition ratio for inactivation by the steroid was determined to be about 6 molecules of the steroid processed per molecule of P-450scc inactivated."

https://openalex.org/W1539599326,"Secretory component (SC), synthesized as a transmembrane protein, acts as the receptor that binds IgA dimers and mediates their transepithelial transport. Cleavage of the receptor (membrane SC) apparently occurs during transport and a fragment, the secreted form, is generated, which remains tightly bound to the IgA dimer. In the rabbit, variation in the size of membrane SC is observed with both a high and a low molecular weight family, each composed either of two or of four distinct polypeptides depending on the individual rabbit. The same degree of size heterogeneity is observed for secreted SC. Part of this size heterogeneity is related to genetic polymorphism. The milk of individual rabbits typed with anti-SC-allotype sera reveals three different banding patterns. The simplest pattern, found in t61/t61 and t62/t62 homozygotes, consists of an upper and a lower doublet. Since each band of these two doublets in the t62 allotype migrates slightly faster than its counterpart in the t61 allotype, a composite pattern is observed in the heterozygotes (t61/t62). Within a given allotypic group, all SC polypeptide chains expressed the identical allotypic specificity. The 2000 to 4000 difference in molecular weight between the two forms of a doublet probably reflects differences in the number of glycosylated asparagine residues, since individual bands of a doublet show identical peptide maps. High and low molecular weight families are also structurally related to each other as shown by one-dimensional peptide maps and identical NH2- and COOH-terminal amino acid sequences. These results indicate that the 25-kDa size difference between SC from the high and low molecular weight families reflects an intramolecular deletion."
https://openalex.org/W1515899710,"A proline dipeptidase (EC 3.4.13.9) from guinea pig brain was purified to over 90% homogeneity by a combination of ammonium sulfate fractionation, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, calcium phosphate-cellulose chromatography, chromatofocusing, and gel filtration on Sephadex G-200. A purification factor of 2718-fold was obtained with a yield of 7%. The purified enzyme was found to have an apparent molecular weight of 132,000 and to consist of two dissimilar subunits of molecular weights 64,000 and 68,000. The substrate specificity of the enzyme is not that of a strict proline dipeptidase. Although it preferentially hydrolyzes proline dipeptides (Leu-Pro) it also hydrolyzes prolyl dipeptides (Pro-Leu) and dipeptides not containing proline (Leu-Leu). The purified enzyme preparation exhibited weak aminoacylproline aminopeptidase activity against Arg-Pro-Pro but it did not exhibit any post-proline dipeptidyl aminopeptidase, post-proline cleaving endopeptidase, proline iminopeptidase, prolyl carboxypeptidase or carboxypeptidase P activities when tested with a large variety of peptides and arylamides. With all of the proline and prolyl dipeptides examined the enzyme exhibited biphasic kinetics (two distinct slopes on Lineweaver-Burk plots). However, with Leu-Leu as substrate normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics were obeyed."

https://openalex.org/W3098986320,A mutant form of human hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRTToronto) was isolated from erythrocytes of a male patient with gout due to a partial deficiency of enzyme activity. The tryptic peptides of HPRTToronto were mapped by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography in an attempt to define the precise abnormality in its primary structure. Sequence analysis of the single aberrant peptide in HPRTToronto revealed an arginine to glycine amino acid substitution at position 50. A single nucleotide change in the codon for arginine 50 (CGA leads to GGA) could explain this substitution.

https://openalex.org/W1608099500,"Canine prostatic fluid, analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions, is characterized by the presence of a single diffuse band (Mr approximately 30,000) which accounts for over 90% of the total protein. The biosynthesis of this protein is under androgen control. Castration results in the disappearance of this protein, whereas its presence in the prostate can be maintained in the castrated animal with exogenous androgen. Analysis of the native protein by isoelectric focusing revealed the presence of 10-13 charged variants with pI values in the range of 6.5 to 8.4. Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions revealed that each isoform is constructed of two dissimilar polypeptide subunits covalently linked through disulfide bonds. One subunit has a molecular weight of 15,000 (H chain); the second subunit (L chain) has a variable molecular weight in the 12,000-14,000 range. The H and L subunits have been purified by preparative isoelectric focusing and chemically characterized. Based on tryptic peptide mapping, NH2-terminal analysis, amino acid and carbohydrate composition, the H and L subunits are structurally unrelated and consequently appear to be unique gene products. Furthermore, the L subunit is glycosylated which potentially accounts for its size heterogeneity. Quantitative NH2-terminal analysis indicated that the H and L subunits are present in the native molecule in a ratio of 2:1, suggesting that the native molecule is a trimer with an apparent molecular weight of 43,000. Based on electrophoretic data, the glycoprotein also constitutes the major fraction of the soluble protein in canine prostatic tissue; its presence is organ specific. This glycoprotein should prove useful as a marker for prostatic function under varying hormonal and environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1593951634,"ATP stimulates the activity of the A and C forms of calf thymus DNA alpha-polymerase on several natural and synthetic primer-templates. Stimulations ranging from 1.5- to 8-fold were observed on gapped bacteriophage fd replicative form DNA, poly(dA) x oligo(dT)10, and poly(dT) x oligo(A)10, at ATP concentrations of 1-5 mM. CTP, dATP, and dCTP can substitute for ATP but are less effective. The nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs, adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate and adenosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate), and other deoxy- and ribonucleoside triphosphates are essentially inactive for stimulation. Stimulation does not result from polymerase-associated DNA primase activity. The size of products synthesized processively by each enzyme on the two homopolymer templates was determined by gel filtration of primers extended under conditions where the enzyme did not react with a given 3'-OH terminus more than once. The size of products synthesized by the A and D forms on poly(dA) x oligo(dT)10 increased by a factor of 3-6 in the presence of ATP. This suggests a direct effect of ATP on the primer elongation reaction. Finally, presynthesis incubation of enzyme plus template at 37 degrees C in the presence or absence of ATP demonstrates that ATP stabilizes the enzyme against breakdown."
https://openalex.org/W2047949733,"The sugar methyl 4,6-dichloro-4,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-galactopyranoside (DiCl-gal) is a new type of inhibitor of the gerbil's electrophysiological taste response to sucrose or saccharin. Saturated solutions of this compound alone barely stimulate the gerbil's taste nerve. But, when mixed with sucrose or saccharin, DiCl-gal suppresses the gerbil's taste response to these two sweeteners. In contrast, when mixed with sodium chloride or hydrochloric acid, DiCl-gal does not affect the taste responses to these compounds. However, unlike other inhibitors of sweet taste, the DiCl-gal taste suppression is short-lived and occurs only when the inhibitor is combined with the sweetener."
https://openalex.org/W1966313692,"After administration of tyrosine, total concentration of biopterin, the cofactor for tyrosine hydroxylase, was increased in the striatum, adrenal glands, and serum of rats, and in the serum of humans. Serum biopterin is lower in patients with Parkinson's disease than in normal controls. After oral administration of tyrosine, the increase in serum biopterin concentration was smaller in patients with Parkinson's disease (less than twofold) than in healthy controls (three-to sevenfold). These results suggest that tyrosine may have a regulatory role in biopterin biosynthesis and that patients with Parkinson's disease may have some abnormality in the regulation of biopterin biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1498244301,"Multivalent cations were tested for their ability to replace the Ca2+ requirements of aggregation factor (AF) complex in activity, stability, and integrity assays. The ability of each cation to replace the Ca2+ required for the cell aggregation-enhancing activity of AF was examined by replacing the usual 10 mM Ca2+ with the test cation at various concentrations in the serial dilution assay of the AF. The other alkaline earth cations, Mg2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+, could not replace Ca2+; two transition elements, Mn2+ and Cd2+, partially replaced calcium. All 15 of the available lanthanides (including La3+ and Y3+) produced normal activity but only at 10-400-fold lower cation concentrations than Ca2+. An AF preparation is stable and remains active for months in 1 mM Ca2+ but decays rapidly when Ca2+ is lowered. Sr2+ and Ba2+ at 20 mM but not at 1 mM could replace 1 mM Ca2+ and give long term stability. AF was not stable in the presence of Mg2+, even at 100 mM. High Mn2+ concentrations did not stabilize AF even though AF was partially active in Mn2+. Cd2+ gave full stability at 75 mM and La3+ at about 0.1 mM. When Ca2+ is chelated, the macromolecular subunits of the AF slowly dissociate. Permeation chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation showed that the cations that stabilized activity maintained the integrity of AF complex while those that failed to stabilize activity allowed the complex to dissociate into subunits, indicating that these two Ca2+ requirements are related. The cation specificities for activity and for stability-integrity are different indicating that these are separate Ca2+-dependent functions."
https://openalex.org/W1486036167,"The paramagnetic effects of Mn2+ . glyoxalase I on the 13C relaxation rates of the reaction product, S-(D-lactoyl)glutathione, separately enriched in the lactoyl carbonyl (C-1) and hydroxymethylene (C-2) carbons, have been measured at 62.8 MHz. The 1/fT1p values of C-1 (1100 +/- 120 s-1) and C-2 (712 +/- 290 s-1) and the previously determined tau c (0.74 ns) yield Mn2+ to carbon distances of 5.7 +/- 0.3 and 6.1 +/- 0.5 A, respectively. These distances, together with previously determined Mn2+-proton distances (Sellin, S., Rosevear, P.R., Mannervik, B., and Mildvan, A.S. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 10023-10029) constrain the thioester carbonyl group of the product to point toward the metal, with the oxygen positioned to accept a hydrogen bond from a water ligand, in a kinetically competent, second sphere complex. Model-building studies indicate that any averaging of multiple second sphere complexes would require as a major contributor at least one conformation with the lactoyl carbonyl oxygen within hydrogen-bonding distance of an intervening water ligand. Such a structure would facilitate polarization of the carbonyl group in the reverse glyoxalase reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1735706741,"Steric interactions between bound ligand molecules and the valine E11 methyl groups of human hemoglobin and sperm whale myoglobin have been examined directly by high resolution NMR techniques. The methyl proton resonances of this amino acid are shifted markedly upfield and away from the bulk of the protein resonances by the shielding effect of circulating pi electrons in the porphyrin ring. We have monitored the valine resonance in the presence of CO and a series of isonitriles and found considerable shifts in its position, both between the various protein complexes and among the different liganded states. The ring current shifts of the gamma 1-methyl group of Val E11 in the CO forms of isolated alpha and beta chains and myoglobin are -2.70, -2.91, and -3.30 ppm, respectively. In all the proteins, these positions show little change in going from bound CO to bound methyl and ethyl isocyanide. In alpha subunits and myoglobin, n-propyl and n-butyl isocyanide binding produces marked decreases in the magnitude of these shifts, indicating that the valine residue has been forced away from the center of ring by the presence of these large ligand molecules. In the case of beta subunits, however, only tert-butyl isocyanide produces a marked decrease (from -2.91 to -1.99 ppm) in the ring current shift of the valine methyl protons. New peaks were observed in the isonitrile-protein spectra and identified as ligand proton resonances by comparing the spectra of normal and totally deuterated isonitrile complexes. The magnitudes of the ring current shifts for the terminal methyl protons of ethyl isocyanide suggest a linear geometry for the Fe equal to C equal to N - C bonds in beta chains and a bent geometry for alpha chains. The bent geometry in alpha subunits appears to be dictated by the position of the Val E11 methyl group which is located further up from the heme plane but closer to the heme center than the corresponding position of the beta subunit residue. The free energy changes for ethyl isocyanide binding to the two chains are nearly identical, suggesting that the linear and bent geometries are energetically equivalent. Myoglobin ethyl isocyanide complexes exhibit ligand ring current shifts intermediate to those observed for the hemoglobin subunits. Assignment of resonances and positions to the alkyl protons of the longer isonitriles is more difficult."

Both the clustered and diffuse acetylcholine receptors are potentially removable from the membrane. Treatment of myotubes with globulin from patients with myasthenia gravis causes the loss of acetylcholine receptor clusters and the concomitant appearance of acetylcholine receptor microaggregates. The rate of acetylcholine receptor cluster loss is greater than the rate of acetylcholine receptor degradation, indicating that acetylcholine receptors are disrupted from clusters to form microaggregates before being removed from the plasma membrane."
