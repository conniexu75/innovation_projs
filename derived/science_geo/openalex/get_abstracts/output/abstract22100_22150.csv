https://openalex.org/W2038816853,"Src homology (SH) regions 2 and 3 are noncatalytic domains that are conserved among a series of cytoplasmic signaling proteins regulated by receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, including phospholipase C-gamma, Ras GTPase (guanosine triphosphatase)-activating protein, and Src-like tyrosine kinases. The SH2 domains of these signaling proteins bind tyrosine phosphorylated polypeptides, implicated in normal signaling and cellular transformation. Tyrosine phosphorylation acts as a switch to induce the binding of SH2 domains, thereby mediating the formation of heteromeric protein complexes at or near the plasma membrane. The formation of these complexes is likely to control the activation of signal transduction pathways by tyrosine kinases. The SH3 domain is a distinct motif that, together with SH2, may modulate interactions with the cytoskeleton and membrane. Some signaling and transforming proteins contain SH2 and SH3 domains unattached to any known catalytic element. These noncatalytic proteins may serve as adaptors to link tyrosine kinases to specific target proteins. These observations suggest that SH2 and SH3 domains participate in the control of intracellular responses to growth factor stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1985585224,"Using a monoclonal antibody (MAb1.1ASML) raised against a surface glycoprotein of the metastasizing rat pancreatic carcinoma cell line BSp73ASML, cDNA clones have been isolated that encode glycoproteins with partial homology to CD44, a presumed adhesion molecule. In one of the clones, pMeta-1, the epitope marks an additional extracellular domain of 162 amino acids inserted into the rat CD44 protein between amino acid positions 223 and 247 (by analogy to human and murine CD44). The new variants are expressed only in the metastasizing cell lines of two rat tumors, the pancreatic carcinoma BSp73 and the mammary adenocarcinoma 13762NF; they are not expressed in the non-metastasizing tumor cell lines nor in most normal rat tissues. Overexpression of pMeta-1 in the nonmetastasizing BSp73AS cells suffices to establish full metastatic behavior."

https://openalex.org/W2161316513,"Affinity-purified bovine brain phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) contains two major proteins of 85 and 110 kd. Amino acid sequence analysis and cDNA cloning reveals two related 85 kd proteins (p85 alpha and p85 beta), which both contain one SH3 and two SH2 regions (src homology regions). When expressed, these 85 kd proteins bind to and are substrates for tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor kinases and the polyoma virus middle-T antigen/pp60c-src complex, but lack PI3-kinase activity. However, an antiserum raised against p85 beta immunoprecipitates PI3-kinase activity. The active PI3-kinase complex containing p85 alpha or p85 beta and the 110 kd protein binds to PDGF but not EGF receptors. p85 alpha and p85 beta may mediate specific PI3-kinase interactions with a subset of tyrosine kinases."
https://openalex.org/W2047174875,"The structure of the human FK506 binding protein (FKBP), complexed with the immunosuppressant FK506, has been determined to 1.7 angstroms resolution by x-ray crystallography. The conformation of the protein changes little upon complexation, but the conformation of FK506 is markedly different in the bound and unbound forms. The drug's association with the protein involves five hydrogen bonds, a hydrophobic binding pocket lined with conserved aromatic residues, and an unusual carbonyl binding pocket. The nature of this complex has implications for the mechanism of rotamase catalysis and for the biological actions of FK506 and rapamycin."
https://openalex.org/W1966018982,"PDGF binding to its receptor promotes the association with and stimulates the phosphorylation of PLC-gamma 1 at tyrosine and serine residues. Also, PDGF induces an increase in the hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids by PLC. How PDGF activates PLC was investigated by substituting phenylalanine for tyrosine at PLC-gamma 1 phosphorylation sites 771, 783, and 1254 and expressing the mutant enzymes in NIH 3T3 cells. Phenylalanine substitution at Tyr-783 completely blocked the activation of PLC by PDGF, whereas mutation at Try-1254 inhibited and mutation at Tyr-771 enhanced the response. Like the wild type, PLC-gamma 1 substituted with phenylalanine at Tyr-783 became associated with the PDGF receptor and underwent phosphorylation at serine residues in response to PDGF. These results suggest that PLC-gamma 1 is the PLC isozyme that mediates PDGF-induced inositol phospholipid hydrolysis, that phosphorylation on Tyr-783 is essential for PLC-gamma 1 activation. These results provide direct evidence that growth factor receptors activate the function of intracellular protein by tyrosine phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1557519226,The enzyme sterol 27-hydroxylase catalyzes the first step in the oxidation of the side chain of sterol intermediates in the bile acid synthesis pathway. Human sterol 27-hydroxylase cDNAs were isolated from a liver cDNA library by cross-hybridization with a previously cloned rabbit cDNA probe. DNA sequence analysis of hybridization-positive clones predicted a human sterol 27-hydroxylase consisting of a 33-amino-acid mitochondrial signal sequence followed by a mature protein of 498 amino acids. RNA blotting experiments demonstrated sterol 27-hydroxylase mRNAs of approximately 1.8 to 2.2 kilobases in liver and fibroblast cells. The steady state levels of the mRNA did not change when cultured cells were grown in the presence or absence of sterols. Introduction of the sterol 27-hydroxylase cDNA into Simian COS cells resulted in the expression of active enzyme capable of catalyzing multiple oxidation reactions (R-CH3—-R-CH2OH—-R-COOH) at carbon 27 of sterol intermediates of the bile acid synthesis pathway.
https://openalex.org/W1979044784,"The Drosophila homeobox segmentation gene fushi tarazu (ftz) is expressed in a seven-stripe pattern during early embryogenesis. This characteristic pattern is largely specified by the zebra element located immediately upstream of the ftz transcriptional start site. The FTZ-F1 protein, one of multiple DNA binding factors that interacts with the zebra element, is implicated in the activation of ftz transcription, especially in stripes 1, 2, 3, and 6. An FTZ-F1 complementary DNA has been cloned by recognition site screening of a Drosophila expression library. The identity of the FTZ-F1 complementary DNA clone was confirmed by immunological cross-reaction with antibodies to FTZ-F1 and by sequence analysis of peptides from purified FTZ-F1 protein. The predicted amino acid sequence of FTZ-F1 revealed that the protein is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. This finding raises the possibility that a hormonal ligand affects the expression of a homeobox segmentation gene early in embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W1990664560,"Immunophilins, when complexed to immunosuppressive ligands, appear to inhibit signal transduction pathways that result in exocytosis and transcription. The solution structure of one of these, the human FK506 and rapamycin binding protein (FKBP), has been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). FKBP has a previously unobserved antiparallel beta-sheet folding topology that results in a novel loop crossing and produces a large cavity lined by a conserved array of aromatic residues; this cavity serves as the rotamase active site and drug-binding pocket. There are other significant structural features (such as a protruding positively charged loop and an apparently flexible loop) that may be involved in the biological activity of FKBP."

https://openalex.org/W2085154580,"The molecular cloning of the complementary DNA coding for a 90-kilodalton fragment of tensin, an actin-binding component of focal contacts and other submembraneous cytoskeletal structures, is reported. The derived amino acid sequence revealed the presence of a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain. This domain is shared by a number of signal transduction proteins including nonreceptor tyrosine kinases such as Abl, Fps, Src, and Src family members, the transforming protein Crk, phospholipase C-gamma 1, PI-3 (phosphatidylinositol) kinase, and guanosine triphosphatase-activating protein (GAP). Like the SH2 domain found in Src, Crk, and Abl, the SH2 domain of tensin bound specifically to a number of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins from v-src-transformed cells. Tensin was also found to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. These findings suggest that by possessing both actin-binding and phosphotyrosine-binding activities and being itself a target for tyrosine kinases, tensin may link signal transduction pathways with the cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W1573490865,"Syndecan is a cell surface heparan sulfate-rich proteoglycan found on various epithelial cells but also in some embryonic mesenchymal tissues. We have immunoisolated syndecan from embryonic tooth mesenchyme that appeared as a 250-300-kDa molecule (Kav = 0.3 in Sepharose 4B), containing only heparan sulfate side chains (Mr = 35,000). Northern analysis of whole tooth germs and tooth mesenchymes also revealed high expression of syndecan mRNAs (2.6 and 3.4 kilobases). In the binding assay utilizing nitrocellulose as a solid phase to immobilize matrix molecules, syndecan immunoisolated from tooth mesenchyme revealed binding to tenascin, and this interaction was shown to be mediated via heparan sulfate side chains. In contrast, syndecan from mouse mammary epithelial cells showed only weak interaction with tenascin. We propose that syndecan and tenascin may represent interactions of a cell surface receptor and a matrix ligand involved in mesenchymal cell condensation and differentiation during early organogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2045880901,"In C. reinhardtii, the mature psaA mRNA is assembled by a process involving trans-splicing of three separate transcripts encoded at three widely scattered loci of the chloroplast genome. At least one additional chloroplast locus (tscA) is required for trans-splicing of exons 1 and 2. We have mapped this gene by transformation of a deletion mutant with a particle gun. The 0.7 kb region of the chloroplast genome that is sufficient to rescue tscA function has been subjected to insertion mutagenesis, showing that it does not contain significant open reading frames. We suggest from these experiments that the product of the tscA gene may be a small chloroplast RNA that acts in trans in the first trans-splicing reaction of psaA. A model for the mode of action of this RNA is presented, in which the characteristic structure of group II introns is assembled from three separate transcripts."
https://openalex.org/W1673016819,"Abstract High affinity binding of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) has been proposed to involve the interaction of the dimeric PDGF ligand with two receptor subunits, designated alpha and beta. We have cloned and expressed a human PDGF receptor cDNA which differs in sequence from the beta-subunit and which has the PDGF binding properties and monoclonal antibody recognition, predicted for the alpha-subunit. Scatchard analysis indicated that PDGF-AA and PDGF-AB bound to transfected alpha-subunits with affinities of Kd = 0.06 and 0.05 nM, respectively. PDGF-BB bound with a significantly lower affinity (Kd = 0.4 nM). Nevertheless, this affinity is still great enough to mediate substantial PDGF-BB binding at physiological concentrations and would be considered to be high affinity. We have used wild-type and kinase-inactive human beta-subunits to show that PDGF binding promotes receptor subunit dimerization in intact cells. In addition, we found that PDGF stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of the kinase-inactive beta-subunit when it is expressed with alpha-subunits. The kinase-inactive beta-subunits were phosphorylated at tyrosine 857 and 751, the major phosphorylation sites of the wild-type beta-subunit, indicating either that intra- and intermolecular phosphorylation occurs on the same sites, or that a significant fraction of receptor tyrosine phosphorylation is intermolecular."
https://openalex.org/W1628140159,"Extracellular ATP4- opens pores in the plasma membrane of mouse macrophages and the J774 macrophage-like cell line that allow molecules as large as fura-2 (831 daltons) to enter the cytoplasmic matrix of the cells. The functional similarity of the ATP-induced pores to gap led us to examine whether these pores were related to members of the connexin family of gap junction proteins. Under conditions of high stringency, RNA isolated from J774 cells hybridized with cDNA for connexin-43 but not with cDNA for connexin-32, -26, or -46. RNA isolated from several variant J774 cell lines that do not permeabilize in response to extracellular ATP (ATPR cells) did not hybridize with connexin-43 cDNA. Immunoblots demonstrated that J774 cells, but not the variant ATPR B2 cell line, expressed connexin-43 protein. These studies demonstrate that mouse macrophages express the connexin-43 gap junction mRNA and protein and strongly suggest that in these cells connexin-43 forms half-gap junctions in response to extracellular ATP4-."
https://openalex.org/W1995318204,"Olfactory receptor neurons respond to odor stimulation with an inward cationic current. Under whole-cell patch clamp, individual, isolated olfactory receptors were exposed to pharmacological agents known to interact with distinct enzymes in a putative second messenger cascade, and their response to odors was measured. IBMX prolonged the odor-evoked current and also reduced its amplitude. cAMP and cGMP induced a current electrically identical to the odor current, but the current showed desensitization only with cAMP. GTP-gamma-s prolonged and GDP-beta-s interfered with the odor-evoked current. The long latency seen in the odor response appears to be mainly due to the loading of the G protein and secondarily to the requirement for cAMP accumulation. The main source of the response decay appears to be cyclic nucleotide hydrolysis."

https://openalex.org/W1550521303,"Evaluation of the expression of the fibrosis (CF) gene in human epithelial cell lines demonstrated active, but low level, transcription of the gene. Analysis of 3.8 kilobases of genomic sequences 5' to exon 1 of the CF gene demonstrated no TATA promoter element, but a high G + C content, multiple transcription start sites, and several potential Sp1 binding sites. Fragments of 5'-flanking sequences from 2.2 kilobases to as small as 102 base pairs 5' to the major transcription start site supported constitutive reporter gene expression in epithelial cells, but at low levels, and independent of the length of the 5' fragment. CF gene transcription was down-regulated by phorbol myristate acetate. Importantly, evaluation of freshly isolated normal human bronchial cells also demonstrated CF gene transcription at a relatively low rate. Together, these observations suggest that although the normal CF gene promoter has characteristics of a housekeeping-type gene, and the gene is expressed at low levels in cells of organs that manifest the clinical disorder cystic fibrosis, its expression can be modulated transcriptionally, implying a possible therapeutic approach for the disease."
https://openalex.org/W1693107265,"The functional interaction between the RNA-dependent DNA polymerase and the RNase H activities of reverse transcriptases (RTs) were examined using a 272 nucleotide long plasmid-derived RNA transcript primed in a specific location. Properties of the avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) RT, the human immunodeficiency virus RT and the Moloney murine leukemia virus RT were examined. All three enzymes formed stable complexes with the primer-template with half-lives ranging from about 16 to 41 s. Each enzyme synthesized full-length primer extension products and cleaved the RNA template at least once during DNA synthesis. Polymerization was then assayed in the presence of challenger RNA that effectively sequestered RTs after one round of processive DNA synthesis. This assay allowed measurement of the number of endonucleolytic cleavages catalyzed by the RT during one encounter with the primer-template. Results indicated that each of the three RTs cut the transcript before dissociating from the primer-template, whether or not deoxynucleoside triphosphates were present to allow synthesis. During synthesis, the extent of RNA degradation differed among the RTs, with AMV-RT generating mostly large segments of RNA-DNA hybrid, and virtually no small RNA cleavage products. Human immunodeficiency virus and Moloney murine leukemia virus-RT generated more small degradation products than AMV-RT, but still left much of the potentially degradable hybrid undigested. Results demonstrate that the RNase H function is much less active than the polymerization function during processive DNA synthesis and that the activities are not strictly coupled."
https://openalex.org/W1558844847,"In this paper we show that tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and interferon gamma (IFN gamma) alter the expression of extracellular matrix receptors (integrins) in cultured human endothelial cells. Endothelial cells express at their surface integrins of the beta 1 and beta 3 groups that include receptors for fibronectin, collagen, laminin, and vitronectin. After treatment for 72 h with a combination of TNF alpha and IFN gamma, the level of the vitronectin receptor (alpha v beta 3) at the cell surface decreases by 70%, whereas the amounts of the beta 1 integrins remain unchanged. The decreased expression of the alpha v beta 3 complex at the cell surface is due to a selective effect of TNF alpha and IFN gamma on the regulation of the beta 3 subunit synthesis at the translational level. In fact, although the steady state levels of the mRNA for the beta 3 subunit are comparable in control and treated cells, the overall synthesis of the beta 3 subunit is decreased by a factor of 70%. No significant alteration of the synthesis of the companion alpha v subunit is detectable in cytokine-treated cells. As a consequence of the decreased expression of the receptor, cytokine-treated cells show decreased ability to adhere to vitronectin but adhere normally to fibronectin. These data show that two important inflammatory mediators, TNF alpha and IFN gamma, can modify the interaction of endothelial cells with the extracellular matrix by selectively altering the expression of specific cell surface integrin complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1997020728,"Highly purified and SDS-soluble paired helical filaments (PHFs) were immunogold labeled and immunoblotted with antibodies to tau: Tau 14 (N-terminal half), AH-1 (microtubule-binding domain), and Tau 46 (C-terminal end). The main component of PHFs was modified tau of 68, 64, and 60 kd, also called A68 or PHF-tau. Trypsin digestion reduced the maximum width of PHFs by 10%-20%, increased aggregation of filaments, and abolished the binding of Tau 14, but had no effect on the binding of AH-1. The smallest tau-reactive tryptic fragments were 13 and 7-8 kd, positive with AH-1, and negative with Tau 46. Our results and the model of Crowther and Wischik suggest that by self-association and anti-parallel arrangement of the microtubule-binding domains, PHF-tau forms the backbone of PHFs."
https://openalex.org/W2091262537,"The developmental determination of primary motoneurons was investigated by transplanting identified motoneurons in embryonic zebrafish to new spinal cord positions. Some cells moved from the new positions in which they were placed back to their original positions, thus it was difficult to evaluate whether they were determined. Among cells that remained in their new positions, those transplanted about 1 hour before axogenesis developed axonal trajectories that were appropriate for their original soma positions, whereas those transplanted 2 to 3 hours before axogenesis developed morphologies appropriate for their new soma positions. These results suggest that motoneuronal identity is determined before axogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1604138526,"The amplification of genomic Alu elements by retroposition, i.e. by reintegration of reverse-transcribed RNA, suggests that Alu RNA plays an important role in this process. We report enzymatic studies of the secondary structure of Alu RNAs transcribed in vitro from two recently retroposed Alu elements. These experiments show that the dimeric organization of an Alu sequence is reflected in its RNA folding. Alu subunits fold independently, conserving secondary structure motifs of their progenitor 7 SL RNA molecule. Energy minimization analysis indicates that this folding pattern is also characteristic of different Alu and Alu-like sequences and has been conserved since primate divergence. By analogy to 7 SL RNA, the Alu RNA folding may be important for specific interactions with proteins. This could indicate a physiological function for Alu transcripts. However, this can be also seen as a structural adaptation leading to efficient retroposition of these sequence elements."
https://openalex.org/W1507132539,"We show here that the alpha-fetoprotein gene (AFP) promoter can be regulated by AP-1 activity using transient transfection assays. AFP promoter activity induced by c-jun/c-fos can be repressed by cotransfected glucocorticoid receptor. The DNA sequence conferring AP-1 activity was located in the proximal promoter region. Gel retardation assays using the AFP proximal promoter identified an AP-1-like sequence which can bind to bacterially expressed c-jun protein. This AP-1-like element, when cloned into the tk promoter, responds to the AP-1 activity of c-jun/c-fos products in both CV-1 and F-9 cells. The element overlaps with a consensus glucocorticoid-responsive element which was shown to confer negative modulation of AFP promoter activity. A 23-base pair DNA element containing the overlapping glucocorticoid-responsive element and AP-1 sites can be positively regulated by glucocorticoid receptor in the absence of c-jun/c-fos products. When plasmids expressing glucocorticoid receptor, c-jun and c-fos are cotransfected together, they repress each other. Thus, these data demonstrate that negative regulation of the AFP gene by glucocorticoid may be due to the interference of AP-1 activity by glucocorticoid receptor either by direct competition for DNA binding or via protein-protein interaction. They provide another example of transcriptional regulation of developing-associated genes between two major signal transduction pathways in response to extracellular stimuli. This supports the model that expression of alpha-fetoprotein is regulated during development by the effect on transcription of antagonism between glucocorticoid receptor and fos/jun."
https://openalex.org/W2030242831,"Evidence indicates that cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) may be important in containing the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the infected host. Although the use of recombinant viruses has been proposed as an approach to elicit protective immunity against HIV, the ability of recombinant viral constructs to elicit CD8+ CTL responses in higher primates has never been demonstrated. A live recombinant virus, vaccinia-simian immunodeficiency virus of macaques (SIVmac), was used to determine whether such a genetically restricted, T lymphocyte-mediated antiviral response could be generated in a primate. Vaccinia-SIVmac vaccination elicited an SIVmac Gag-specific, CD8+ CTL response in rhesus monkeys. These CTLs recognized a peptide fragment that spans residues 171 to 195 of the Gag protein. The rhesus monkey major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I gene product restricting this CTL response was defined. Both the vaccinated and SIVmac-infected monkeys that shared this MHC class I gene product developed CTLs with the same Gag epitope specificity. These findings support the use of recombinant virus vaccines for the prevention of HIV infections in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1527891330,"We have characterized two high affinity acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) receptors in a rat parathyroid cell line (PT-r). Affinity labeling with 125I-aFGF showed that these two receptors, apparent molecular masses, 150 and 130 kDa, respectively, display higher affinity for aFGF than for bFGF. The 150-kDa receptor bears a heparan sulfate chain(s), demonstrated by a decrease in size of 15-20 kDa with heparitinase digestion after affinity labeling. Heparitinase digestion before affinity labeling markedly reduced the intensity of the 150 kDa species. Scatchard analysis showed two different high affinity binding sites (Kd of 3.9 pM with 180 sites/cell and Kd of 110 pM with 5800 sites/cell). The higher affinity site was completely eliminated by digestion with heparitinase before adding labeled aFGF; the lower affinity site was unaffected. In ion exchange chromatography after metabolic labeling of the cells with [3H]glucosamine and affinity labeling with 125I-aFGF, the larger receptor-ligand complex, 165 kDa, eluted with approximately 0.5 M NaCl, typical eluting conditions for heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Both of the receptor-ligand complexes were smaller on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis than two major heparan sulfate proteoglycans, HSPG I and II, which we characterized in this cell line previously (Yanagishita, M., Brandi, M. L., and Sakaguchi, K. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 15714-15720). Both receptors have similar N-linked oligosaccharide and sialic acid contents, shown by analysis of affinity-labeled receptors upon digestion with glycopeptidase F and with neuraminidase. All together, these results suggest that PT-r cells bear two distinct high affinity receptors for aFGF, a 150-kDa receptor which is a heparan sulfate proteoglycan and another that is a glycoprotein. The heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan moiety of the 150- kDa receptor is critical for high affinity binding of aFGF. These findings contrast with current concepts derived from other systems, suggesting that heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans/proteoglycans function as a reservoir source for FGF or as a group of low affinity binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W1575274046,"Stem cell factor (SCF) isolated from culture medium conditioned by Buffalo rat liver cells was subjected to detailed structural analysis. Attempts at direct N-terminal sequencing of the factor indicated that its N terminus is blocked as pyroglutamic acid (Zsebo, K. M., Wypych, J., McNiece, I. K., Lu, H. S., Smith, K. A., Karkare, S. B., Sachdev, R. K., Yuschenkoff, V. N., Birkett, N. C., Williams, L. R., Satyagal, V. N., Bosselman, R. A., Mendiaz, E. A., and Langley, K. E. (1990) Cell 63, 195-201). The removal of the blocking pyroglutamate by pyroglutamate aminopeptidase allowed sequencing of the polypeptide chain to position 47. Stem cell factor was also digested with CNBr, trypsin, Staphylococcus aureus protease (strain V8), and AspN peptidase to generate different sets of peptides that were then separated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and sequenced. Sequence of an internal peptide fragment obtained by cleavage of stem cell factor at a single tryptophanyl peptide bond was also obtained. From these analyses, the complete amino acid sequence could be constructed. The factor as isolated is a single polypeptide of 164 or 165 amino acids. The sequence is confirmatory to a sequence deduced from a cDNA sequence and provides important evidence for C-terminal processing of the polypeptide encoded by cDNA. There are four potential N-linked glycosylation sites. Asn65, Asn72, Asn109, and Asn120. Sequence determination of isolated peptides suggested that Asn120 is glycosylated, Asn65 and Asn109 glycosylated in some molecules but not in others, and Asn72 not glycosylated. Amino acids at three positions, i.e. 142, 143, and 155, could not be detected during sequence analysis. Since the gene sequence codes for Ser, Thr, and Thr at these positions (Martin, F. H., Suggs, S. V., Langley, K. E., Lu, H. S., Ting, J., Okino, K. H., Morris, C. F., McNiece, I. K., Jacobsen, F. W., Mendiaz, E. A., Birkett, N. C., Smith, K. C., Johnson, M. J., Parker, V.

(1990) Cell 63, 203-211), they could be sites of O-linked carbohydrate attachment. The four cysteines form two intramolecular disulfide bonds, Cys4-Cys89 and Cys43-Cys138."
https://openalex.org/W1594857663,"The largest subunit of eukaryotic RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) has a serine- and threonine-rich C-terminal domain (CTD) that may interact both with DNA and with the activating region of transcription factors. It has been proposed, in one model, that a protein kinase phosphorylates the promoter-associated CTD, facilitating the transition between promoter-binding and RNA-elongating forms of RNAP II. An immobilized template transcription system was used to test the predictions of this model directly. A protein kinase that phosphorylated the CTD at multiple sites was detected. This activity was tightly bound to the template, as evidenced by continued association after multiple rounds of washing. Phosphorylation was promoter sequence-dependent and exhibited the same nucleotide substrate specificity as the previously characterized ATP-requiring step in initiation. It was necessary for [gamma-32P]ATP and initiating rNTPs to be present simultaneously in the reaction in order to efficiently chase-radiolabel into elongating RNAP II-containing complexes, consistent with the idea that initiation and phosphorylation are temporally associated reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1573974516,"A vast array of cellular signal transduction processes arise from combinations of many different types of agonists, receptors, effectors, and coupling molecules such as heterotrimeric G proteins or protein kinases that connect receptors to effectors. Receptors, effectors, G proteins, and kinases are being newly identified at bewildering speeds and in the process it seems that our understanding of how cells respond to specific stimuli may have diminished just as we lose sight of the forest when we are buried in the trees. Evolution would suggest that there may be a logic to the response provoked by a given stimulus and, using our recently acquired knowledge of G protein pathways between receptors and ion channel effectors, I will attempt to decipher what the underlying logic might be."
https://openalex.org/W1487993287,"Recently identified epitopes in apoA-I define a distinct N-terminal region with a complex tertiary structure, characterized by multiple discontinuous epitopes. Other epitopes are constituted of short domains centered either on beta-turns or random coils or on the 22-mer amphipathic alpha-helices (Marcel, Y. L., Provost, P. R., Koa, H., Raffai, E., Vu Dac, N., Fruchart, J.-C., and Rassart, E. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 3644-3653). The compared immunoreactivity of seven epitopes studies here in response first to delipidation of high density lipoprotein (HDL) apoA-I by detergents, and second to modifications of HDL lipid composition by phospholipase A2 or by enrichment in surface lipids demonstrates that apoA-I has a flexible conformation which is readily responsive to the nature and concentration of bound lipids and that the structure of lipid-free apoA-I is significantly different from that of HDL-bound apoA-I, possibly representing a condensed molecule with several masked domains. In HDL apoA-I, these epitopes define five distinct domains which are characterized by particular responses to lipid modifications. However, two domains, each starting at the N-terminal beta-turn of an amphipathic alpha-helical repeat (residues 99-121 and 186-209, respectively) have almost identical immunoreactivity whether after detergent treatment or after changes in cholesterol and phospholipid levels, a property which probably reflects the known periodicity of apoA-I structural 22-mers. The immunoreactivity of a discontinuous epitope, representative of the N-terminal domain, is inversely related to the concentration of phospholipids, a unique characteristic among the epitopes tested here which indicates that the complex N-terminal region interacts with phospholipids, either directly or indirectly. These studies demonstrate that the conformation of multiple domains of HDL apoA-I is dependent on lipid phase composition and differentially affected by cholesterol and phospholipids."
https://openalex.org/W2109538334,"The cellular uptake of cobalamin (Cbl, vitamin B12) is mediated by transcobalamin II (TCII), a plasma protein that binds Cbl and is secreted by human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cells. These cells synthesize and secrete TCII and, therefore, served as the source of the complementary DNA (cDNA) library from which the TCII cDNA was isolated. This full-length cDNA consists of 1866 nucleotides that code for a leader peptide of 18 amino acids, a secreted protein of 409 amino acids, a 5'-untranslated segment of 37 nucleotides, and a 3'-untranslated region of 548 nucleotides. A single 1.9-kilobase species of mRNA corresponding to the size of the cDNA was identified by Northern blot analysis of the RNA isolated from HUVE cells. TCII has 20% amino acid homology and greater than 50% nucleotide homology with human transcobalamin I (TCI) and with rat intrinsic factor (R-IF). TCII has no homology with the amino-terminal region of R-IF that has been reported to have significant primary as well as secondary structural homology with the nucleotide-binding domain of NAD-dependent oxidoreductases. The regions of homology that are common to all three proteins are located in seven domains of the amino acid sequence. One or more of these conserved domains is likely to be involved in Cbl binding, a function that is common to all three proteins. However, the difference in the affinity of TCII, TCI, and R-IF for Cbl and Cbl analogues indicates, a priori, that structural differences in the ligand-binding site of these proteins exist and these probably resulted from divergence of a common ancestral gene."
https://openalex.org/W1508788566,"Insulin is thought to exert its effects on cellular function through the phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of specific regulatory substrates. We have analyzed the effects of okadaic acid, a potent inhibitor of type 1 and 2A protein phosphatases, on the ability of insulin to stimulate glucose transport in rat adipocytes. Insulin and okadaic acid caused a 20-25- and a 3-6-fold increase, respectively, in the rate of 2-deoxyglucose accumulation by adipose cells. When added to cells previously treated with okadaic acid, insulin failed to stimulate 2-deoxyglucose accumulation beyond the levels observed with okadaic acid alone. Treatment of cells with okadaic acid did not inhibit the effect of insulin to stimulate tyrosine autophosphorylation of its receptor. These results indicate that okadaic acid potently inhibits the effects of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake and/or utilization at a step after receptor activation. To clarify the mechanism of inhibition by okadaic acid, the intrinsic activity of the plasma membrane glucose transporters was analyzed by measuring the rate of uptake of 3-O-methylglucose by adipose cells, and the concentration of adipocyte/skeletal muscle isoform of the glucose transporter (GLUT-4) in plasma membranes isolated from these cells. Insulin caused a 15-20-fold stimulation of 3-O-methylglucose uptake and a 2-3-fold increase in the levels of GLUT-4 detected by immunoblotting of isolated plasma membranes; okadaic acid caused a 2-fold increase in 3-O-methylglucose uptake, and a 1.5-fold increase in plasma membrane GLUT-4. Pretreatment of cells with okadaic acid blocked the effect of insulin to stimulate 3-O-methylglucose uptake and to increase the plasma membrane concentration of GLUT-4 beyond the levels observed with okadaic acid alone. These results indicate that the effect of okadaic acid to inhibit the effect of insulin on glucose uptake is exerted at a step prior to the recruitment of glucose transporters to the cell surface, and suggest that a phosphatase activity may be critical for this process."
https://openalex.org/W1964606095,"It is generally assumed that the machinery that transcribes genes is composed entirely of polypeptides. However, in vitro transcription by silkworm RNA polymerase III requires a transcription factor that is not a polypeptide. This component, TFIIIR, is distinct from the previously identified transcription components: RNA polymerase III, and the accessory factors TFIIIA, TFIIIB, TFIIIC, and TFIIID. The newly discovered TFIIIR is a macromolecule that appears to be composed of RNA. It is resistant to heat, detergent, phenol, protease, and deoxyribonuclease, but it is sensitive to alkali and ribonuclease."
https://openalex.org/W2022420247,"Compared with N-methyl-D-aspartate-activated channels, the interaction of Ca2+ with kainate-activated or with quisqualate-activated channels is not well understood. We have studied the effect of Ca2+ on kainate-activated currents in isolated trigeminal neurons and found that Ca2+ inhibits kainate responses. This inhibition occurs not because Ca2+ changes the affinity of kainate to its receptor, but because Ca2+ blocks monovalent cation permeation through kainate-activated channels. This Ca2+ block gives rise to the outward rectification of the kainate responses."
https://openalex.org/W1642525803,"Annexins are structurally related proteins that bind phospholipids in a Ca2(+)-dependent manner and possess at least four conserved 70-amino acid repeat domains. The ability of certain annexins to promote contact between vesicle membranes in vitro has prompted the suggestion that these proteins regulate membrane traffic in exocytosis. We have previously found that annexins I and II promote contact between vesicles whereas annexin V does not. In order to understand the mechanism of annexin I-mediated vesicle-vesicle contact, we prepared a monoclonal antibody that specifically inhibits annexin I-mediated vesicle aggregation. We identified the domain of annexin I recognized by this monoclonal antibody by using it to screen an expression library containing random fragments of annexin I cDNA. The antibody identified a fragment encoding amino acids 41-118 (the first repeat plus 8 residues of the amino-terminal tail). We constructed a chimeric protein containing these amino acids of annexin I fused to the second, third, and fourth repeats of annexin V. Transfer of this domain conferred the ability to promote vesicle aggregation, confirming that this domain participates directly in mediating contact between vesicle membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1591029240,"Protein tyrosine phosphorylation was studied in macrophages and fibroblasts to identify putative components of post-receptor mitogenic pathways that might be functionally conserved in different cell types. Nondenaturing conditions were established for the approximately quantitative recovery of anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (alpha PY)-reactive proteins from cells. A common, 57-kDa alpha PY-reactive protein was identified by V8 protease peptide mapping in colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1)- or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-stimulated BAC1.2F5 macrophages, in platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated NIH-3T3 cells, and in CSF-1-stimulated NIH-3T3 cells expressing the c-fms/CSF-1 receptor. The 57-kDa protein was phosphorylated on serine and tyrosine and was the only alpha PY-reactive protein band whose phosphorylation was reproducibly increased in GM-CSF-stimulated cells. The effect of the growth factors on the tyrosine phosphorylation of the 57-kDa protein could be mimicked by treatment of the cells with orthovanadate, a phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase inhibitor. In the absence of growth factors, tyrosine phosphorylation of the 57-kDa protein was higher in v-fms or c-fms (F969, S301)-transformed NIH-3T3 cells than in untransformed NIH-3T3 (c-fms) and NIH-3T3 (c-fms, F969) cells. These data indicate that the 57-kDa protein is a common target for growth factor-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation and potentially important for growth factor mitogenic signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1839088367,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) exposure of human B lymphocytes induces rapid, Ca(2+)-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of two cytosolic proteins, one likely the CD21 EBV receptor and another unknown species of 55-60 kDa. We now identify the latter protein as the tyrosine kinase lck (p56lck). In T cells many activation events reduce the high constitutive p56lck expression levels typical for that lineage, and they induce the appearance of a 60-kDa lck species. We now demonstrate that in B cells exposed to EBV the at best low constitutive p56lck expression levels are rapidly and transiently up-regulated without generation of 60-kDa lck. lck-specific antisense oligonucleotides block p56lck induction and prevent subsequent B cell activation and immortalization whereas B cell activation by nononcogenic agents was unaffected. We propose that p56lck superinduction is a transformation prerequisite which signals entry into the oncogenic growth transformation process."
https://openalex.org/W1578898144,"The choriogonadotropin beta subunit is unique in the human glycoprotein hormone family in containing a carboxyl-terminal extension, with four sites of O-glycosylation, that is not present in the other beta subunits. We have used site-directed mutagenesis to define boundaries on the extent to which truncations can be made at the COOH terminus without abolishing subunit assembly and biological activity. Two COOH-terminal deletion mutant chains of human choriogonadotropin beta, des(93-145) and des(101-145), were prepared and expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells containing a stably integrated gene for bovine alpha. The heterologous gonadotropin, bovine alpha-human choriogonadotropin des(101-145) beta, formed a heterodimer and, when assayed with transformed murine Leydig cells in vitro, competed with the binding of standard human choriogonadotropin and stimulated both cAMP and progesterone production, albeit with a reduced potency relative to bovine alpha-human choriogonadotropin beta wild type. In contrast, human choriogonadotropin des(93-145) beta, expressed under identical conditions in the presence of bovine alpha, failed to form heterodimer and thus exhibited no competitive binding and was without effect on cAMP and progesterone levels. Consequently, removal of the putative determinant loop region of the beta subunit (residues 93-100), which is believed to be important in determining receptor specificity, abolishes association with alpha. Hence, in addition to its possible role as a receptor determinant, this region of the molecule appears to be critical for proper folding or subunit interaction. The truncated form of human choriogonadotropin beta lacking residues 101-145 is the shortest form of the subunit yet described that retains biological activity. Moreover, these results demonstrate that the proposed disulfide between Cys-26 and Cys-110 is not required for subunit assembly or for receptor binding and subsequent intracellular signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1489809204,"Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) regulates fibrinolysis by inhibiting tissue type plasminogen activator (t-PA). Fibrinogen, heparin, and vitronectin enhance the rate of inhibition of t-PA by PAI-1. Kinetic studies indicate that both fibrinogen and heparin increase the second-order inhibition constant by a maximum of approximately 4-fold, whereas vitronectin increases the rate constant by a maximum of approximately 6-fold. The dissociation constants of fibrinogen, heparin, and vitronectin for the inhibition reaction were 200 nM, 20 nM, and 600 pM, respectively. In addition, PAI-1 inhibition of t-PA may be regulated by the presence of lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)). Previous studies demonstrated that Lp(a) competes with plasminogen for the active site of fibrinogen- and heparin-bound t-PA. Kinetic studies described here demonstrate that Lp(a) prevents the inhibition of t-PA by PAI-1 in the presence of fibrinogen and heparin, but has no effect on the reaction in the presence of vitronectin or in the absence of either fibrinogen or heparin. The data suggest that fibrinogen and heparin may enhance the rate of inhibition through an interaction with t-PA, and that vitronectin may enhance the inhibition through an interaction with PAI-1. In addition, these experiments indicate that Lp(a) may regulate fibrinolysis by competing with PAI-1 and plasminogen for fibrinogen- and heparin-bound t-PA. These data suggest that PAI-1 inhibition of t-PA in vivo is primarily mediated via interaction with fibrinogen, heparin, vitronectin, and Lp(a), and therefore, the functional levels of PAI-1 activity in the vasculature may be regulated by the presence of these components."
https://openalex.org/W1495563488,"Sequence similarity between the reovirus type 3 hemagglutinin (HA3) and a anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibody (87.92.6) has been shown to define the site of interaction with a neutralizing (idiotypic) monoclonal antibody (9B.G5) and the cellular receptor for the virus. A synthetic peptide (VL peptide) derived from the anti-idiotypic sequence inhibits viral binding to the receptor. In this study, variants of the VL peptide were utilized to probe specific amino acid residues involved in binding the neutralizing antibody and the receptor. These studies indicate that the--OH groups of several residues are involved in contacting the reovirus type 3 receptor, including Tyr49, Ser50, Ser52, and Thr53 in the anti-idiotypic sequence, corresponding to Tyr326, Ser327, Ser329, and Ser325 in HA3, respectively. In contrast, only Ser50 of the anti-idiotypic sequence, corresponding to Ser327 of HA3, significantly altered neutralizing antibody binding. Additional studies implicate sialic acid as a potential reovirus type 3 receptor on some cells. This includes inhibition of binding of reovirus type 3 and 87.92.6 to L cells by heavily sialylated glycoproteins. Sialic acid was therefore utilized as a candidate receptor to analyze potential interaction schemes with HA3/87.92.6. Sequence similarity to other immunoglobulin structures with similar sequences allowed modeling of the three-dimensional structure of these epitopes. These structures, in combination with peptide studies, allow the development of a model of the interaction of these epitopes with sialic acid, which serves as a reovirus type 3 receptor. These models reveal that similar amino acid residues and side-chain geometries may be utilized by the reovirus type 3 and influenza hemagglutinins in their interactions with cell-surface receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1583346252,"By screening of a lambda gt11 library from Plasmodium falciparum genomic DNA with an antiserum raised against a 41-kDa protein band, which was shown to confer protective immunity to monkeys, the phage clone 41-3 was identified. The entire 41-3 gene was isolated, and its coding regions were determined by amplification and sequencing of 41-3 specific mRNA fragments. The 41-3 gene has a complex structure consisting of nine exons, encoding 375 amino acids in total with a calculated molecular weight of 43,400. Provided that the N-terminal hydrophobic residues function as signal sequence which is cleaved off, the molecular weight of the 41-3 protein decreases to 41,200 and could therefore be considered to be a component of the protective Mr = 41,000 protein band. Indeed, a 41-kDa protein could be detected by Western blot analysis using antisera raised against different recombinant expression products of the 41-3 gene. We furthermore demonstrate an alternative splice process for the mRNA precursor transcribed from the 41-3 gene to yield at least three distinct mRNAs. The major splice product carries all exons E1 to E9, whereas at least two minor 41-3 mRNA species can be identified which show deletions in the region between exons E5 and E7. The possible role of this differential splice process for the parasite is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1484346750,"To investigate the potentials of DNA methylation and H1 histone in regulating the action of DNA binding proteins, well ordered complexes were formed by slow salt gradient dialysis of mixtures of H1 histone with either methylated or nonmethylated DNA. The sites methylated in the plasmids were CCGG. Methylation of cytosine in this site protects the DNA against HpaII endonuclease but not against MspI. However, when the methylated DNA was complexed to H1, it was protected against MspI. The protection was only effective for a subset of the MspI restriction sites. The protection of DNA afforded by the combination of H1 binding and DNA methylation did not apply to EcoRI, PstI, or BamHI sites and so did not seem to be due to aggregation of the DNA by H1 histone. Gel retardation assays indicated that the affinity of H1 for methylated DNA was not detectably different from its affinity for nonmethylated DNA. Probably methylated DNA when bound to H1 is in a conformation that is resistant to MspI endonuclease. Such conformational changes induced by DNA methylation and H1 binding might affect the action of other DNA binding proteins, perhaps in chromatin as well as in H1.DNA complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1525952986,"Alkalinization-induced Ca2+ release from isolated frog or rabbit sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles appears to consist of two distinct components: 1) a direct activation of ruthenium red-sensitive Ca2+ release channels in terminal cisternae and 2) an increased ruthenium red-insensitive Ca2+ efflux through some other efflux pathway distributed throughout the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The first of these releases exhibits an alkalinization-induced inactivation process and does not depend on the ruthenium red-insensitive form of Ca2+ release as a triggering agent for secondary Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release. Both releases are inhibited when the extravesicular (i.e. cytoplasmic) free [Ca2+] is reduced. This may reflect an increased sensitivity of the Ca2+ release channels to Ca2+ at alkaline pH. The pH sensitivity of the ruthenium red-sensitive Ca2+ release channels could be of significance during excitation-contraction coupling. The ruthenium red-insensitive form of Ca2+ release is less likely to be physiologically relevant, but it probably has contributed greatly to reports of alkalinization-induced decreases in net sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ uptake, particularly under conditions where oxalate supported Ca2+ uptake is much less affected, as here."
https://openalex.org/W1539104560,"Past evidence has suggested that the lysosomal pathway is an important site of cytoplasmic RNA degradation in the hepatic parenchymal cell (Lardeux, B. R., Heydrick, S. J., and Mortimore, G. E. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 14507-14519). We now provide additional support for this notion by quantitating degradable RNA in lysosomes and correlating its pool size with hepatic RNA degradation. Rat livers, previously labeled with [6-14C]orotic acid, were perfused with graded levels of amino acids over the full range of induced autophagy; RNA degradation was determined from [14C]cytidine release. Close correspondence between the marker beta-acetylglucosaminidase and the breakdown of RNA to cytidine in subcellular fractions indicated that the lysosome was the main site of catabolism, a conclusion supported by the fact that degradation was enhanced when external pH was lowered from 7 to 6. Although [14C]cytidine was also released in homogenates by the action of natural ribonucleases on cytosolic RNA, this source was eliminated by unlabeled exogenous RNA. The size of the degradable RNA pool in lysosomes, determined from the total release of cytidine in homogenates, correlated directly with rates of hepatic RNA degradation over the full range of basal and induced degradation. A direct correlation was also seen between RNA degradation and cytidine pools within lysosomal particles. Because cytosolic cytidine was not taken up by lysosomes under these conditions, the pool could only have arisen from the breakdown of intralysosomal RNA. As determined by cytidine production, these findings support the view that the lysosomal-vacuolar system is the main, if not sole, site of induced and basal RNA degradation in liver."
https://openalex.org/W1520139069,"The predominant autolytic form of human kallikrein, beta-kallikrein, was used to localize the high molecular weight kininogen (HK) binding site on kallikrein as well as the substrate recognition site for activated factor XII on prekallikrein. beta-Kallikrein is formed by autolysis of the kallikrein heavy chain to give two fragments of approximately 18 and 28 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A ligand binding technique established that the HK binding site on kallikrein residues on the 28-kDa fragment of the heavy chain. Limited NH2-terminal sequencing of this portion of beta-kallikrein showed that this fragment of the heavy chain consists of the COOH-terminal 231 amino acids of the heavy chain. A panel of five murine monoclonal antibodies to human prekallikrein (PK) were found to have epitopes on this same fragment of the heavy chain. None of the monoclonal antibodies were able to block binding of HK to PK. Three of the monoclonal antibodies (13G11, 13H11, and 6A6) were able to inhibit the activation of PK to kallikrein in both a plasma system and a purified system. The 28-kDa fragment of the PK heavy chain was purified and was able to compete with HK for binding to PK. The HK binding site and the site of recognition of factor XII are separate and distinct on PK, and both are contained in the COOH-terminal 231 amino acids of the PK heavy chain."
https://openalex.org/W1574411945,"The pathway of degradation of human interferon-beta (IFN-beta) mRNA was examined in murine C127 cells that carry an expression vector for this mRNA. The IFN-beta mRNA decayed with a half-life of approximately 45 min in actinomycin D-treated cells and became gradually shorter. This mRNA was superinduced in cycloheximide-treated cells, but it also became gradually shorter. However, apparently full-length species of IFN-beta mRNA accumulated after prolonged incubation with cycloheximide. The shortened IFN-beta mRNA species were partially deadenylated and less stable than full-length species. These findings suggest that at least two nuclease activities are involved in degrading IFN-beta mRNA; one deadenylates this mRNA and decays in cycloheximide-treated cells, while the other apparently breaks down deadenylated mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1589438928,"The cytoplasmic injection of mRNA synthesized in vitro into Xenopus oocytes is widely used for heterologous expression of ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors. We report two new methods for expression of ion channels and receptors in oocytes using vaccinia virus (VV). 1) A recombinant VV carrying the Shaker H4 K+ channel cDNA driven by the VV P7.5 early promoter was injected into oocytes. 2) A recombinant VV containing the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase driven by the P7.5 promoter was coinjected along with plasmids containing a T7 promoter and cDNAs for channels and receptors. The functionally expressed proteins include a) voltage-gated ion channels: the Shaker H4 K+ channel and the rat brain HA Na+ channel, b) a ligandgated ion channel: the mouse muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR), and c) a G protein-coupled receptor: the rat brain 5HT1C receptor. After virus/cDNA injection into oocytes, these channels and receptors generally showed characteristics and expression levels similar to those observed in mRNA-injected oocytes. However, the AChR expressed at lower levels in virus/cDNA-injected oocytes than in mRNA-injected oocytes. Because our methods bypass mRNA synthesis, they are more rapid and convenient than the mRNA injection method. Potential applications to structure-function studies and expression cloning are discussed.—Yang, X.-C. Karschin, A.; Labarca, C.; Elroy-Stein, O.; Moss, B.; Davidson, N.; Lester, H. A.

https://openalex.org/W1569220994,"A rat islet tumor subclone, RIN-5AH-T2-B, was cultured with 2 mmol/liter of the proliferation-arresting compound sodium butyrate (NaB). Insulin gene expression and glucose-stimulated insulin release were analyzed and compared with logarithmically proliferating and confluent control cells cultured without NaB. Logarithmically proliferating control cells revealed high insulin gene expression. In the presence of amino acids, these cells showed a dose-dependent insulin response to glucose with a half-maximal and maximal 6.5-fold stimulation by 0.8 and 5.6 mmol/liter D-glucose, respectively. However, as the control cells approached growth arrest, insulin gene expression subsided to below detectability, an occurrence that is associated with decreased insulin release and accumulation of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. In contrast, NaB-arrested cells showed continuous insulin gene expression throughout the experiment. Despite this, insulin release in response to glucose was lost. NaB revealed a biphasic effect on the cell-cycle: after an initial leaky G1 arrest during the first 24 h, the 5AH-B cells were arrested in G2 during the following 3 days. These data suggest that insulin gene expression and glucose-stimulated insulin release are affected by the cell cycle. These glucose-sensitive RIN-5AH-T2-B cells may be useful in studies of insulin secretion and gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1576471654,"Chick skin slices were incubated with [35S]methionine and labeled apoA-I was immunoprecipitated from incubation medium and tissue homogenate. ApoA-I accounted for approximately 13 and 2.5% of radioactive medium and cell proteins, respectively. After ultracentrifugation of the medium, 55% of labeled apoA-I was found as a constituent of lipoproteins (d less than 1.210 g/ml) and 45% in a lipid-poor form (1.210-1.260 g/ml). To ascertain whether this large proportion of lipid-poor apoA-I was due to a dissociation of this peptide from medium lipoproteins during ultracentrifugation, labeled incubation medium was applied to an anti-chick apoA-I immunoaffinity column. The material bound to the column was analyzed by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis and found to contain three subpopulations of lipoproteins with a particle size of 12, 11, and 9 nm, respectively. The radioactivity of these subpopulations accounted for 82% of total radioactive medium apoA-I. ApoA-I was localized by immunohistochemistry in the viable cells of the epidermis and in the stratum corneum. Rat skin slices were found to synthesize and secrete apoE but no apoA-I. ApoA-I and apoE secreted by chick and rat skin, respectively, may play a role in the secretion of lipids from the differentiating keratinocytes and thus contribute to the formation of the hydrophobic barrier of the skin."
https://openalex.org/W1563979192,"Vinculin is a 1066-amino acid protein found at several types of actin-membrane junction. To locate sites of interest in the primary structure, a map was derived using partial cleavage reactions. Of several different types of cleavage tested, the most useful was the 5-5'-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) reaction which cuts at cysteine residues. About 30 well defined fragments were obtained from vinculin, and several methods were used to locate these products in the sequence. Comparison of the peptides generated from whole vinculin with those from the 90-kDa amino-terminal proteolytic fragment revealed which originated there. The use of [14C]cyanide in conjunction with DTNB showed which peptides contained the original amino terminus. Secondary cleavage with N-chlorosuccinimide, a tryptophan-specific reagent, helped locate fragments, although it led to apparent increases in molecular weight of the products. These experiments revealed the location of 10 of the major DTNB fragments on the sequence. This map was used to locate binding sites. The site of interaction between vinculin and the focal contact protein talin was mapped by binding labeled talin to the separated fragments. The binding site was found to be in the amino-terminal 325 amino acids. The binding site of a commercially obtained monoclonal antivinculin antibody was mapped using Western blotting of cleaved vinculin. It proved to bind in the central area of the molecule between amino acid residues 545 and 737. Thus the cysteine cleavage reaction products provide a map of general utility for locating features on the vinculin molecule."
