https://openalex.org/W1898130445,"Unused CPU time on desktop computers could be put to good use, if distributed computing succeeds in capturing people's imagination. In their Perspective, Shirts and Pande describe existing distributed computing projects and recent efforts to overcome parallelization problems. This vast underused resource could raise biological and other scientific computation to fundamentally new predictive levels."

https://openalex.org/W2006808369,"Fireflies can duplicate both faster and slower rhythms of artificial light. Since the interval between the pacer signal and the firefly's flash of the next cycle approximates the firefly's normal free-run period, it is suggested that the pacer signal resets the flash-timing oscillator in the brain, thus providing a mechanism for synchronization."

https://openalex.org/W1506321102,"Throughout the last glacial period, rapid climatic changes called Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) events occurred in the Northern Hemisphere. As Labeyrie discusses in his Perspective, these events are ideal targets for testing our understanding of climate change and developing climatic change models. Important steps toward understanding D-O events, particularly regarding the role of the low latitudes, are now reported by Hughen et al. and Peterson et al."

Exposures of Eocene volcanic rocks in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic may represent layer A interbedded with coarser volcanic debris and preserved near early Tertiary volcanic centers."
https://openalex.org/W2074208492,"A small cluster of polio cases in the Dominican Republic and Haiti marks both the first polio outbreak in the Western Hemisphere in more than 9 years and the first reliable report that a vaccine-derived polio strain may have reverted to a virulent form and spread contagiously. Although a massive vaccination campaign already in the works is expected to contain the outbreak, the unusual incident raises troubling questions about a vaccine that has been in widespread use for nearly 40 years."

https://openalex.org/W2071848349,"This fall, genetically modified corn that had not been approved for human consumption was found in taco shells in the United States. Last week, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) convened a scientific panel to review evidence on whether this StarLink corn could harm sensitive people by causing allergic reactions. The panel found that the overall probability is ""low,"" but the EPA appears intent on investigating further before allowing the corn in foods, as its manufacturer has requested."

https://openalex.org/W1986059881,"In this month's essay, the last in the Pathways of Discovery series, Martin J. Rees celebrates the way astronomers and cosmologists have systematically uncovered the biography of the universe. Rife with neutron stars, black holes, and multiple universes that emerge from quantum fluctuation, it's a story as grand as it is strange."
https://openalex.org/W1592431166,"By exploiting the symmetry of randomness, three mathematicians have revealed the geometric underpinnings of the frenetic random dance called Brownian motion. The methods they used seem likely to apply to other random processes, some as familiar as the flow of water through a filter. The proof was presented at the recent Current Developments in Mathematics 2000 conference sponsored by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology."
https://openalex.org/W1606351725,"For more than a year since the September 1999 death of a teenager in a gene-therapy clinical trial that had industry connections, scientists, ethicists, and government and university officials have been fretting about conflict of interest. But no one could say just how the nation's universities are policing such conflicts. Now, three recently published studies show that requirements for disclosure of outside financial interests vary widely from university to university, as do penalties for violations."

https://openalex.org/W1652693472,"Eighth graders from the United States are still running in the middle of the global pack when it comes to science and math achievement, according to the latest results from the Third International Mathematics and Science Study. And Asian nations continue to lead the way, with Singapore and Taiwan emerging as the star performers among the 38 participating countries. The news is not good for U.S. science and math educators, who have spent much of the decade pursuing reforms aimed at raising student achievement."
https://openalex.org/W2001525685,"In the presidential election, United States citizens encountered a scientific reality—error attends all quantitative measurements. All quantitative observations are to some extent inaccurate, and proper treatment of experimental error has become an important field of science. Yet, in deciding election winners, the United States clings to the notion that a single vote can be decisive, that, for example, a candidate may legitimately win by a vote count of 1,000,001 to 1,000,000. The uncertainty of measurement is much greater than one vote. Within experimental error, that vote count is a tie.

Scientific realities are widely recognized in other aspects of our lives, so why not in something so fundamental to the United States as the election process? This matter should be studied by statisticians, perhaps as a National Research Council committee, and their recommendation should be considered seriously by Congress. What is needed is a system that is clear and simple, yet scientifically sound. One option, for example, would be to declare a tie if the number of votes for the two top candidates differed by less than 0.1% of total votes cast. In a presidential election, a state's electoral votes might then be split between the candidates, with any odd electoral vote directed by the state's governor."

Now, a team has elevated this control to an art form, enabling them to make nanosized versions of a variety of shapes including rods, arrows, teardrops, and even four-armed tetrapods shaped like a child's jack."

At the core of the new technology lies the vertical cavity surface emitting laser."
