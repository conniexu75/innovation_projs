The pressures required to disrupt the mutant cells (150 p.s.i.) similarly were less than for the wild type (350 p.s.i.) or revertant (300 p.s.i.) cells indicating an increased fragility of the drug-re- sistant mutants. In all three cases, however, the final plasma membrane preparations consisted of homoge- neous populations of vesicles ranging between 0.1 and 0.7 pm in diameter and were enriched lo-fold in 5’- nucleotidase and (Na+ + K’)-Mti+ATPase. An integral membrane glycoprotein with a molecular weight of approximately 170,000 (“P-glycoprotein”) was present in vesicles from the drug-resistant cells but not the others. The amount of this protein was related to the degree of drug resistance. The protein was purified by the following procedure: removal of peripheral mem- brane proteins with 35 lll~ lithium diiodosalicylate, solubilization in 0.5% N-dodecylsarcosinate, and frac- tionation by lectin-agarose affinity chromatography using Ricinus communis-I which bound the P-glycopro- tein and Lens culinaris and Pisum sativum lectins which bound other membrane glycoproteins. The amount of purified P-glycoprotein thus obtained ac- counted for approximately 3 to 4% of the total plasma membrane protein in one colchicine-resistant mutant line."

https://openalex.org/W1516181901,"The hepatic concentration of a low molecular weight, metal-binding protein in 1- to 4-day-old rats is 20 times that in 70-day-old adults. Biochemical purifications were performed to characterize this metal-binding protein in the liver of 1- to 4-day-old rats. Gel filtration of hepatic cytosol on Sephadex G-75 demonstrated that the major Zn-containing fraction of newborns had a relative elution volume and low absorbance at 280 nm, similar to the metallothionein fraction of Zn-treated adult rats. These fractions were further purified by DEAE-Sephadex A-25 chromatography and two major subfractions (MT-A and MT-B) were obtained from both the newborns and Zn-treated adults, with the corresponding subfractions eluted in buffer of similar conductivity. MT-A and MT-B of newborns also exhibited mobilities on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis similar to the corresponding subfractions from Zn-treated adults. Both subfractions from the newborns had an abundance of half-cystine and a deficiency in most aromatic amino acids which are characteristics of metallothionein. Therefore, according to all of the criteria commonly used for the indentification of metallothionein, these data demonstrate that the metal-binding protein which is highly concentrated in newborn liver is metallothionein. The variation of the concentration of hepatic and renal metallothionein with age was also determined.The hepatic concentrationmore » peaks at 1 to 4 days of age and falls rapidly after that, reaching the adult level at 28 days of age. However, the renal concentration showed no variation with age.« less"

The two glycoproteins used as model acceptor substrates in this study were human asialotransferrin, which contains the nonreducing terminal oligosaccharide sequence Gal beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 2Man, and antifreeze glycoprotein, which contains oligosaccarides with the structure, Gal beta 1 leads to 3GalNAc alph 1 leads O-Thr. Sequential action of the six glycosyltransferases on these model substrates led to the formation of previously described oligosaccharide structures. The studies reported here indicate that the substrate specificities of the individual enzymes dictate the structures that can be synthesized and the pathways by which they may be formed. The actions of a number of the transferasesare mutually exclusive, thereby prohibiting the formation of theoretically possible oligosaccharide structures. Oligosaccharides with the terminal sequence NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 3(Fuc alpha 1 leads to 2)Gal beta 1 leads to 3GalNAc and NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 6Gal beta 1 leads to 4(Fuc alpha 1 leads to 3)GlcNAc cannot be formed because the prior incorporation of sialic acid by the sialyltransferases yields products that are not acceptor substrates for the fucosyltransferases, and vice versa. Synthesis of other products requires that the enzymes act sequentially in a specific order. The structures NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 6(Fuc alpha 1 leads to 2)Gal beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc, Fuc alpha 1 leads to 2Gal beta 1 leads to 4(Fuc alpha 1 leads to 3)GlcNAc, GalNAc alpha 1 leads to 3(Fuc alpha 1 leads to 2)Gal beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc, and GalNAc alpha 1 leads to 3(Fuc alpha 1 leads to 2)Gal beta 1 leads to 3GalNAc can only be synthesized if the fucosyl alpha 1 leads to 2 galactose linkage is formed first. Synthesis of the pentasaccharide sequences GalNAc alpha 1 leads to 3(Fuc alpha 1 leads to 2)Gal beta 1 leads to 3(NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 6)GalNAc and GalNAc alpha 1 leads to 3(Fuc alpha 1 leads to 2)Gal beta 1 leads to 4(Fuc alpha 1 leads to 3)GlcNAc requires that the N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase act last on the former structure and that the alpha 1 leads to 3 fucosyltransferase act last on the latter. In those instances where a product can be formed by one of two possible pathways, the comparisons of reaction rates indicate that one pathway is usually preferred..."

https://openalex.org/W1551862023,"The ribonuclease inhibitor from human placenta may be isolated in 65% yield (2.5 mg per placenta) in 2 days. The performance of the affinity chromatography on Sepharose-RNase A has been expedited through adaption of the spectrophotometric assay of ribonuclease toward 2',3'-cyclic cytidine monophosphate to determination of the inhibitor activity. The result of these improvements in procedure is increased availability of the ribonuclease inhibitor for study of its chemical properties (Blackburn, P., and Jailkhani, B.L. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 12488-12493) and for its inclusion into in vitro systems in which inhibition of mammalian neutral ribonucleases is desired."

https://openalex.org/W1521659179,"The metal binding sites of a gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-rich fragment derived from bovine prothrombin were examined using paramagnetic lanthanide ions to evaluate the role of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid resideus in metal binding. A gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-rich peptide, fragment 12-44, was isolated from a tryptic digest of prothrombin. Using 153Gd(III), fragment 12-44 was found to contain one high affinity metal binding site (KD = 0.55 microM) and four to six lower affinity metal binding sites (KD approximately 4 to 8 microM). The S-carboxymethyl derivative of fragment 12-44, in which the disulfide bond in fragment 12-44 was reduced and alkylated, contained no high affinity metal binding site and four or five lower affinity sites (KD = 8 microM). The effects of paramagnetic lanthanide ions on fragment 12-44 and its S-carboxymethyl derivative were studied by natural abundance 13C NMR spectroscopy. The 13C NMR spectrum of fragment 12-44 was recorded at 67.88 MHz and the resonances were assigned by comparison to the chemical shift of carbon resonances of amino acids and peptides previously studied. The proximity between bound metal ions and carbon atoms in fragment 12-44 was estimated using Gd(III), based upon the strategy that the magnitude of the change in the transverse relaxation rate of resonances of carbon nuclei induced by bound metal ions is related in part to the interatomic distances between bound metal and carbon nuclei. Titration of fragment 12-44 with Gd(III) resulted in the selective broadening of the gamma-carboxyl carbon, C gamma, C beta, and C alpha resonances of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid, and the C epsilon of the arginines. S-Carboxymethyl fragment 12-44, which lacked the high affinity metal binding site, showed markedly decreased perturbation of the C epsilon of the arginine residues upon titration with Gd(III). These studies indicate that gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues in prothrombin fragment 12-44 participate in metal liganding. A high affinity metal binding site in fragment 12-44 is in close proximity of Arg 16 and Arg 25 and is stabilized by the disulfide bond. On the basis of these data, a model of the metal binding sites is proposed in which the high affinity site is composed of two gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues which participate in intramolecular metal-dependent bridging of two regions of the polypeptide chain. The lower affinity metal binding sites, formed by single or paired adjacent gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues, then may participate in intermolecular metal-dependent protein . protein or protein . membrane complex formation."

https://openalex.org/W1566093865,"Using mass spectrometric, radioisotopic, chromatographic and chemical techniques, five fatty acid esters of 3 beta-hydroxy-5-pregnen-20-one (pregnenolone) have been identified as components of the lipoidal derivatives biosynthesized in vitro with bovine adrenal mitochondria. The five compounds are: pregnenolone arachidonate, pregnenolone linoleate, pregnenolone oleate, pregnenolone palmitate, and pregnenolone stearate. The distribution of the fatty acids among these five esters is different from the previously reported (Cmelik, S.H.W., and Ley, H. (1977) Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 56B, 267-270) fatty acid composition of these organelles."
