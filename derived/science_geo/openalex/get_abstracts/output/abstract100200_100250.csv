The assay used a fractionated cell extract and measured acetylation of a peptide corresponding to amino acids 1-28 of H4. There are at least two activities in this fraction that acetylate the peptide. A mutation, hat1-1, that eliminates one of the activities was identified and mapped to a locus near the centromere of chromosome XVI. The HAT1 gene was cloned and found to encode a protein of 374 amino acids. Analysis of the peptide used in the assay demonstrated that the HAT1 enzyme acetylates lysine 12 of histone H4. hat1 mutants have no obvious growth defects or phenotypes other than the enzyme defect itself.

The N-terminal tails of all four core histones are subject to several post-translational modifications including the reversible acetylation-deacetylation of ∈-amino groups of specific lysine residues. Three distinct roles have been proposed for histone acetylation. One is in gene activation and the regulation of transcription(1Allfrey V.G. Chromatin and Chromosome Structure. Academic Press, New York1977Google Scholar, 2Perry M. Chalkley R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7336-7387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A clear correlation exists between a high degree of acetylation and a high level of transcription (3Allegra P. Sterner R. Clayton D.F. Allfrey V.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) but whether the acetylation is a cause or an effect of gene activation is unclear. Another role proposed for histone acetylation is during histone synthesis and deposition. It is thought that a specific transient acetylation of histones may be necessary for their deposition during DNA replication(4Ruiz-Carillo A. Wangh L.J. Allfrey V.G. Science. 1975; 190: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 5Allis C.D. Chicoine L.G. Richman R. Schulman I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8048-8052Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Finally, histone acetylation appears to play a role in histone replacement during germ cell maturation(6Christensen M.E. Dixon G.H. Dev. Biol. 1982; 93: 404-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Histone acetyltransferases have been purified and characterized from a number of mammalian sources (7Belikoff E. Wong L.-J. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11448-11453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Attisano L. Lewis P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3949-3955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as yeast(9Travis G.H. Colavito-Shepanski M. Grunstein M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14406-14412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lopez-Rodas G. Tordera V. Sanchez del Pino M.M. Franco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19028-19033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractionation studies suggest that there are at least two such enzymes, one cytoplasmic that acetylates free histones, and one nuclear that perhaps acetylates histones in chromatin(11Garcea R.L. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11454-11463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is still not clear, however, whether different enzymes exist for each histone or even for specific lysine residues on a given histone. To date, no histone acetyltransferase genes or mutants have been reported. In order to learn more about the in vivo roles of histone acetylation and about the specificities of the enzymes, we looked for a yeast mutant defective in this process. A collection of yeast temperature-sensitive mutants was screened by an in vitro enzymatic assay that measured acetylation of an H4 peptide corresponding to amino acids 1-28. In this report, we describe the identification of a mutant specifically defective in the acetylation of lysine 12 in this peptide. The cloning of the wild type gene is also described. The following yeast strains were used: W303-1a: MATaade2 ura3 leu2 trp1 his3 can1; W303-1b: MATα, otherwise isogenic to W303-1a; W303: diploid from W303-1a and W303-1b; SK56: isogenic to W303-1a plus hat1-2::TRP1; SK57: isogenic to W303-1b plus hat1-2::TRP1; A364a: MATaade1 ade2 ura1 tyr1 lys2 his7 gal1. (This is the parent strain for the collection of temperature-sensitive mutants.) The four centromere mapping strains CSH87L, CSH89L, X3144-11A, and X3382-3A have been described(12Kleff S. Kemper B. Sternglanz R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown at 30°C in YPD or SC medium (13Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar) plus appropriate supplements unless otherwise stated. Strain constructions, genomic DNA isolation, sporulation, tetrad dissection, and analysis were performed as described(13Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). The hat1-1 mutation was followed through genetic crosses by the HAT 1The abbreviations used are: HAThistone acetyltransferasekbkilobase(s)bpbase pair(s). enzyme assay. Yeast transformations were carried out by the lithium acetate method(14Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar). histone acetyltransferase kilobase(s) base pair(s). Yeast cells were grown at 23°C in 20-40 ml of liquid medium to a cell density of 2-8 × 107 cells/ml, shifted to 37°C for 1 h, spun down, washed with 5 ml of H2O, and resuspended in 200 μl of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 500 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell suspensions were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes containing 100 μl glass beads (300-μm diameter), chilled, and sonicated for 12 s three times using a Heat Systems Ultrasonics cell disrupter with a microtip at 2.0 output. After centrifugation for 15 min at 30,000 × g, the supernatants were dialyzed into buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 100 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) using a microdialysis chamber (Bethesda Research Laboratories). The dialyzed extracts were fractionated in small batches in microcentrifuge tubes by loading 175 μl of extract on 200 μl of Q-Sepharose FF resin (Pharmacia), equilibrated with buffer A, and mixed gently for 15 min at 4°C. After the resin had settled, the supernatant was discarded, washed with 400 μl of buffer A, and eluted with 200 μl of buffer B (same as buffer A but 625 mM NaCl). The supernatant, referred to as the Q380 fraction, was used in the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) assays. Protein concentrations were determined by a microassay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard; ~5 μg of protein were used per assay. The assays were carried out in 50 μl of 75 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.7, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, and a final concentration of 150 mM NaCl. The peptide concentration in the assay was 50 μM, and [3H]acetyl coenzyme A was added to a final concentration of 3.0 μM at 2.3 Ci/mmol. The reaction mixture was preincubated for 30 s at 37°C, the Q380 fraction was added, and the incubation continued at 37°C for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1.5 ml of cold 20% trichloroacetic acid. Precipitated peptide and proteins were collected on glass fiber filters (Schleicher & Schuell), washed twice with 5% trichloroacetic acid, once with methanol, dried, and counted in a scintillation counter. In order to obtain enough peptide for sequence analysis, several HAT assays of an extract were pooled. Reactions were terminated by incubating them at 65°C for 5 min instead of by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The samples were bound to Immobilon PVDF membranes (Millipore) and sequenced on an automatic protein Sequencer. The eluates from each cycle were collected, dried, and counted for 10 min in a scintillation counter. The preparation of λ-DNA and cloning of the genomic inserts from the λ-DNA into the shuttle vector pBM2384 were done as described(15Erickson J.R. Johnston M. Genetics. 1993; 134: 151-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subclones from the initial plasmid, p5538, were cloned into YEp352 or M13mp18 using standard protocols(16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequence was determined from M13 single-stranded DNA by the dideoxy method. The hat1-2::TRP1 null mutant plasmid was generated by cloning the EcoRI-BglII fragment from the upstream region of the HAT1 gene into the EcoRI and BamHI of the disruption vector pRS304(17Sikorski R. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the StuI-NruI fragment from the 3′ end of the gene into a blunt-ended XhoI site of the same vector. The resulting plasmid, pSK2, was linearized with SalI, transformed into a wild type diploid (W303), which after sporulation and dissection gave rise to strains SK56 and SK57. The same plasmid was also used to transform strain MX1-4c, which resulted in strain SK55. The correct gene replacements were verified by Southern blot. The hat1-2::TRP1 null mutation deletes 50 bp upstream of the HAT1 open reading frame (ORF) as well as amino acids 1-266. The HAT1 gene was cloned into the T7 expression vector pET3b (18Rosenberg A.H. Lade B.N. Chui D. Lin S.-W. Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 56: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar) to yield pSTT21. This plasmid encoded a fusion protein consisting of the first 11 amino acids of T7 gene 10 protein, 4 linker amino acids, and the entire 374 amino acids of HAT1, all downstream of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. E. coli strain BL21-DE3 containing pSTT21 was grown in LB plus ampicillin medium, induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside for 2 h, and harvested. Cells were resuspended in 200 μl of cold buffer B, sonicated, and centrifuged for 1 min in a desk top centrifuge. The supernatant was used directly for HAT assays. The hat1-1 mutant was found by screening a collection of temperature-sensitive (ts) yeast mutants (19Hartwell L.H. J. Bacteriol. 1967; 93: 1662-1670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Klyce H.R. McLaughlin C. Exp. Cell Res. 1973; 82: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) for histone H4 acetyltransferase activity in vitro. Previous studies in our laboratory (21Mullen J.R. Kayne P.S. Moerschell R.P. Tsunasawa S. Gribskov M. Colavito-Shepanski M. Grunstein M. Sherman F. Sternglanz R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2067-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) as well as published partial purification protocols for acetyltransferases from yeast suggested the presence of more than one such activity in yeast (10Lopez-Rodas G. Tordera V. Sanchez del Pino M.M. Franco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19028-19033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since multiple activities contributing to an in vitro assay might obscure the identification of a mutation in only one activity, we attempted to gain specificity by making two improvements: first, instead of detecting the acetyltransferase activity in crude extracts, we fractionated the extracts over a Q-Sepharose anion exchange resin and assayed a high salt eluate (this fraction is referred to as Q380); second, we used as a specific substrate a peptide corresponding to amino acids 1-28 of yeast histone H4 (a gift from B. Alberts, University of California, San Francisco). This peptide was incubated in the presence of [3H]acetyl coenzyme A with the Q380 fractions made from the temperature-sensitive strains, and incorporation of 3H into the peptide was measured. In order to check that the assay was not measuring N-terminal acetylation, known yeast N-terminal acetyltransferase mutants, including nat1, ard1, nat2, and mak3 strains (21Mullen J.R. Kayne P.S. Moerschell R.P. Tsunasawa S. Gribskov M. Colavito-Shepanski M. Grunstein M. Sherman F. Sternglanz R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2067-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 22Kulkarni M.S. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13141-13147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Tercero J.C. Wickner R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20277-20281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were assayed and found to have the same level of activity as a wild type strain. Additional evidence that the assay is measuring acetylation of ∈-amino groups of lysine residues on the peptide is described below. After screening about 250 mutants, a strain was found which reproducibly showed a 40% reduction in histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity (see Table 1 for typical results). When this mutant was outcrossed to a wild type strain, the resulting tetrads segregated 2+:2- for the decreased HAT activity, indicating that the decrease was caused by a single nuclear mutation, which we called hat1-1. We also noticed that the decrease did not cosegregate with the ts phenotype of the original strain. Strains carrying the hat1-1 mutation alone are not ts and show no obvious phenotypes.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab A wild type strain and the identified hat1-1 mutant were compared using an N-terminally blocked peptide as the substrate. This peptide corresponds to amino acids 1-20 of histone H4 and contains a tertiary butoxycarbonyl group at its N terminus (H4 aa B1-20 in Table 1). Both strains exhibit a slight reduction in activity compared to the longer, unblocked H4 aa 1-28 peptide, but the hat1-1 mutant still exhibits a 40% reduction in activity compared to wild type with this substrate. We attribute the overall reduction in HAT activity in both strains with the blocked peptide substrate to a lower affinity of the HAT enzyme(s) for this substrate. As another test for the specificity of the assay, we used as a substrate a 21-amino acid peptide, corresponding to the N terminus of histone H3 (kindly provided by D. Allis, Syracuse University). The wild type and hat1-1 strains showed the same amount of activity with this substrate (Table 1), but this amount corresponds to only 15% of the activity found with the 28-amino acid H4 substrate. Apparently, the Q380 fraction of the yeast extract contains only a minor activity that recognizes the H3 substrate, but this activity is not affected by the hat1-1 mutation. A different fraction of the yeast extract, containing much more acetylation activity specific for H3, also is unaffected by the hat1-1 mutation. 2S. Tafrov and R. Sternglanz, unpublished data. The Q380 subfraction used here seems enriched for an H4 specific activity. The hat1-1 mutant still showed 60% HAT activity when compared to a wild type strain (Table 1). This remaining activity could be attributed either to a leaky phenotype of the hat1-1 allele or to a second activity that is not affected by the mutation. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we examined the heat inactivation profile of the HAT activity by subjecting the Q380 fraction to 45°C for various periods of time. Fig. 1 shows that the wild type activity has a biphasic heat inactivation profile, with about 25% of the activity being rapidly inactivated and the remaining 75% being inactivated much more slowly. On the other hand, all the activity remaining in the mutant (60% of the initial wild type activity) is very heat-resistant. Reproducibly, the activity remaining in the mutant after heating is always lower than that remaining in the wild type fraction (Fig. 1). We interpret these data to show that the Q380 fraction has at least two HAT activities, one heat-sensitive and one or more heat-resistant. The hat1 mutant lacks the heat-sensitive activity and also appears to have partially lost the heat-resistant activity. Perhaps the HAT1 protein is a component of two different HAT enzymes, one heat-sensitive and one heat-resistant. The Q380 fraction clearly contains a significant heat-resistant HAT activity unaffected by the hat1 mutation. In order to determine which lysine residues of the H4 peptide were being acetylated, a standard assay with [3H]acetyl coenzyme A was done using the Q380 fraction from both wild type and the hat1-1 mutant. The peptide substrate was then subjected to amino acid sequence analysis, and the amount of radioactivity at each position was determined. As is shown in Fig. 2, the wild type fraction incorporates 3H mainly into lysines at positions 5, 8, and 12 with a small amount into lysine 16. The majority of acetylation by the Q380 fraction is clearly on lysine 12. The hat1 mutant-labeled peptide exhibits a strikingly different pattern (Fig. 2). The amount of 3H incorporated into lysines 5, 8, and 16 is approximately the same as seen for the wild type extract, but the amount of label in lysine 12 is greatly reduced. Thus it appears that the hat1 mutation affects a histone acetyltransferase activity specific for lysine 12 of H4. Analysis of the initial crosses between the hat1-1 mutant and a HAT1+ strain indicated that the hat1-1 mutation was centromere-linked. This conclusion was based on the observation that there was a paucity of tetratype tetrads between hat1-1 and trp1, a centromere-linked marker on chromosome IV. In order to localize the hat1-1 mutation to a particular chromosome, we crossed the hat1-1 mutant with several mapping strains carrying many centromere-linked markers. In these crosses, the hat1-1 mutation was followed by the enzymatic assay. The results showed linkage of hat1-1 to aro7, a marker near the centromere and on the right arm of chromosome XVI. A three-factor cross involving hat1, aro7, and rad1, a centromere-linked marker on the left arm of chromosome XVI, mapped the hat1 mutation to the interval between rad1 and aro7, close to the centromere (data not shown). Next, we obtained three overlapping λ phages containing yeast genomic DNA from the region spanning centromere XVI(24Riles L. Dutchik J.E. Baktha A. McCauley B.K. Thayer E.C. Leckie M.P. Braden V.V. Depke J.D. Olson M.V. Genetics. 1993; 134: 81-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The genomic inserts from these phages were introduced into a specialized yeast shuttle vector developed for this purpose(15Erickson J.R. Johnston M. Genetics. 1993; 134: 151-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used the 2μ plasmid pBM2384 for these constructions to avoid generating a plasmid with two centromeres, since one of the phages contained centromere XVI. Q380 fractions from a hat1-1 mutant carrying a plasmid containing the genomic insert from λ phage 5538 (p5538) restored activity to the mutant to about 90% of the wild type level (data not shown). A 6-kb SalI subclone from p5538 also restored activity to the mutant. We determined the DNA sequence of short stretches from this subclone and aligned them to a stretch of 10 kb of preliminary chromosome XVI DNA sequence, kindly provided to us by H. Bussey, McGill University. ORFs within the 6-kb SalI fragment were identified and used to direct further subcloning. A subclone with a 2.3-kb StuI-EcoRI fragment (p16ORF4), containing only one ORF, was found to restore HAT activity to the mutant. We named the gene corresponding to this ORF HAT1. The DNA sequence of HAT1 and the surrounding region has recently been deposited in GenBankTM as part of the yeast genome sequencing project (accession number Z48483). Analysis of the DNA sequence near HAT1 revealed that the gene is immediately adjacent to the centromere on the left arm of chromosome XVI, with its direction of transcription toward the centromere. The 374-amino acid sequence predicted for the HAT1 protein is shown in Fig. 3. The protein has an unusually large number (23Tercero J.C. Wickner R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20277-20281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of phenylalanine residues and a molecular mass of 44 kDa. A search of the GenBankTM data base using the Blast algorithm revealed no significant homology between HAT1 and other proteins. Further analysis revealed that HAT1 does show homology to a bipartite consensus sequence found previously in a group of N-terminal acetyltransferases(23Tercero J.C. Wickner R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20277-20281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two regions of homology to the consensus are underlined in the HAT1 sequence shown in Fig. 3. We speculate that these regions of homology may constitute an acetyl coenzyme A binding site. A hat1-2 null mutant was constructed by deleting the ORF from amino acids 1-266 plus an additional upstream 50 bp of 5′-untranslated region and replacing it with the selectable marker TRP1. Strains carrying the hat1-2::TRP1 allele are viable and show the same amount of HAT activity (60% of wild type) as the originally identified hat1-1 allele (data not shown). This result confirmed that the residual activity seen in hat1-1 mutants is caused by a second activity and is not due to a leaky allele. The hat1-2 null mutant has no obvious phenotype; thus far, we have not found any differences between the two hat1 alleles in in vitro assays or in other phenotype studies. The HAT1 gene was cloned into a T7 expression vector (18Rosenberg A.H. Lade B.N. Chui D. Lin S.-W. Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 56: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar) and transformed into a suitable E. coli strain (see “Materials and Methods”). After induction, a large amount of soluble HAT1 protein was produced, as judged by the appearance of a band of the expected mobility on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (data not shown). Extracts prepared from these cells had very high levels of HAT activity (Fig. 4). Even a 1:1000 dilution of the extract had detectable activity. A control extract from an E. coli strain without the HAT1 plasmid had no activity. These results show that HAT1 is the structural gene for the enzyme and that no other subunits are required for activity. In summary, we have identified a mutant and cloned the gene (HAT1) for a histone acetyltransferase that acetylates lysine 12 of H4. It remains to be seen whether other enzymes exist in yeast with the same or overlapping specificity. The fact that the hat1 mutant has no obvious growth defect makes the latter possibility quite likely.

To determine if 4PS is the alternative substrate of the insulin receptor in IRS-1-deficient mice, we performed immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase assays using specific antibodies to 4PS. Following insulin stimulation, 4PS is rapidly phosphorylated in liver and muscle, binds to the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, and activates the enzyme. Insulin stimulation also results in the association of 4PS with Grb 2 in both liver and muscle. In IRS-1-deficient mice, both the phosphorylation of 4PS and associated PI 3-kinase activity are enhanced, without an increase in protein expression. Immunodepletion of 4PS from liver and muscle homogenates removes most of the phosphotyrosine-associated PI 3-kinase activity in IRS-1-deficient mice. Thus, 4PS is the primary alternative substrate, i.e. IRS-2, which plays a major role in physiologic insulin signal transduction via both PI 3-kinase activation and Grb 2/Sos association. In IRS-1-deficient mice, 4PS/IRS-2 provides signal transduction to these two major pathways of insulin signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2059247616,"The β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) belongs to the large family of G protein-coupled receptors. Mutation of tyrosine residue 326 to an alanine resulted in a β2AR mutant (β2AR-Y326A) that was defective in its ability to sequester and was less well coupled to adenylyl cyclase than the wild-type β2AR. However, this mutant receptor not only desensitized in response to agonist stimulation but down-regulated normally. In an attempt to understand the basis for the properties of this mutant, we have examined the ability of this regulation-defective mutant to undergo agonist-mediated phosphorylation. When expressed in 293 cells, the maximal response for phosphorylation of the β2AR-Y326A mutant was impaired by 75%. Further characterization of this phosphorylation, using either forskolin stimulation or phosphorylation site-deficient β2AR-Y326A mutants, demonstrated that the β2AR-Y326A mutant can be phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) but does not serve as a substrate for the β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 (βARK1). However, overexpression of βARK1 led to the agonist-dependent phosphorylation of the β2AR-Y326A mutant and rescue of its sequestration. βARK1-mediated rescue of β2AR-Y326A sequestration could be prevented by mutating putative βARK phosphorylation sites, but not PKA phosphorylation sites. In addition, both sequestration and phosphorylation of the wild-type β2AR could be attenuated by overexpressing a dominant-negative mutant of βARK1 (C20βARK1-K220M). These findings implicate a role for βARK1-mediated phosphorylation in facilitating wild-type β2AR sequestration.

Homologs of Escherichia coli ACP exist throughout nature in two forms: either as an integral domain of a much larger multifunctional enzyme (type I) or as a discrete protein capable of associating with several other enzymes constituting a multienzyme synthase complex (type II). In these two forms ACPs play central roles in a broad range of other biosynthetic pathways that depend on iterative acyl transfer steps, including polyketide(4Shen B. Summers R.G. Gramajo H. Bibb M.J. Hutchinson C.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3818-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), non-ribosomal peptide(5Baldwin J.E. Bird J.W. Field R.A. O'Callaghan N.M. Schofield C.J. Willis A.C. J.

A definitive feature of ACP is the 4′-PP prosthetic group (Fig. 1)(9Majerus P.W. Alberts A.W. Vagelos P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 53: 410-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). 4′-PP is attached through a phosphodiester linkage to a conserved serine residue found in all ACPs. Acyl groups of the many substrates recognized by type I and type II ACPs are activated for acyl transfer through a thioester linkage to the terminal cysteamine thiol of the 4′-PP moiety. The β-alanyl and pantothenate portions of the 4′-PP structure are believed to serve as a tether between the phosphodiester-ACP linkage and the terminal thioester, suggesting that 4′-PP may function as a swinging arm, shuttling growing acyl chains between various active sites, e.g. as in the sequential addition of 11 amino acids by the 1.4-MDa cyclosporin synthetase(10Schmidt B. Riesner D. Lawen A. Kleinkauf H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Holo-ACP synthase (ACPS) transfers the 4′-PP moiety from CoA to Ser-36 of apo-ACP to produce holo-ACP and 3′,5′-ADP in a Mg2+-dependent reaction. The ACPS from E. coli was partially purified 780-fold from crude extracts 27 years ago(11Elovson J. Vagelos P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3603-3611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the ACPS from spinach has been partially purified(12Elhussein S.A. Miernyk J.A. Ohlrogge J.B. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), but remarkably little has been shown about the mechanism or specificity of this post-translational phosphopantetheinylation process. A mutant of E. coli conditionally defective in the synthesis of holo-ACP has been identified and the mutant phenotype attributed to an altered holo-ACP synthase activity(13Polacco M.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5750-5754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To study the mechanism and specificity of ACP-phosphopantetheinylation, we had as our initial objective the cloning and overproduction of ACPS from E. coli. We now report the 70,000-fold purification and N-terminal sequencing of wild-type ACPS. A search of the translated data bases identified a gene (dpj) of previously unknown function, as the gene which encodes ACPS. Overexpression of dpj allowed the preparation of ACPS in 10-mg quantities. CoA (200 mg) was labeled by tritium gas exposure (DuPont NEN) to yield 600 mCi of crude material. This material was added to unlabeled CoA, and the mixture was acylated and purified as described by Elovson and Vagelos(11Elovson J. Vagelos P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3603-3611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this manner, [3H]CoA with specific activities as high as 7 × 1014 dpm/mol and having 70% of the 3H label in the phosphopantetheine portion was prepared. In a typical assay, 100 μM [3H]CoA, 50 μM apo-ACP, 10 mM MgCl2, 50 mM Tris•HCl, pH 8.8, and ACPS in a final volume of 100 μl were incubated at 37°C for 30 min in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. Reactions were quenched with 800 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid. Bovine serum albumin (20 μl of a 25 mg/ml solution) was then added to facilitate precipitation of radiolabeled protein. The 1.5-ml tubes were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min. Supernatants were removed, and the pellets were rinsed with 3 × 900 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid. Residual trichloroacetic acid was collected by centrifugation, and the pellets were resuspended in 150 μl of 1 M Tris base. The resuspended pellets were transferred to scintillation vials, 2.5 ml of scintillation mixture (Packard) was added, and the amount of 3H-labeled holo-ACP formed was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. ACPS assays were incubated for 12 h at 37°C. Control assays were worked up in the usual manner, and holo-ACP formation was confirmed by liquid scintillation counting. Assay mixtures for native-PAGE were not quenched with 10% trichloroacetic acid. The ACPS assay mixture was divided into two equal portions. To one 50-μl portion was added 20 μl of 5 × native-PAGE sample buffer (17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1992Google Scholar) containing DTT, whereas the other sample was not reduced with DTT. These samples were analyzed by 20% native gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie staining. The stained gels were soaked in Amplify (Amersham Corp.) for 15 min before drying under vacuum. The dried gels were autoradiographed at −80°C, followed by photographic development (Fig. 2). Holo-ACP-SH migrates slightly faster than apo-ACP on 20% native gels, whereas holo-ACP dimer migrates considerably slower(14Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). E. coli DK554, an apo-ACP overproducer strain, was provided by Prof. John E. Cronan, Jr. (Department of Microbiology and Biochemistry, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign). Cultures grown in Terrific broth supplemented with 50 mM glucose, 25 μM pantothenate, and 50 μg/ml kanamycin were induced with 1 mM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside at an O.D. of 0.8. Cells were lysed by two passages through a French pressure cell at 10,000 p.s.i. The majority of overproduced ACP was present in the apo-form. Minor amounts of holo-ACP were converted to apo-ACP using endogenous holo-ACP hydrolase by incubating the lysate with 10 mM MgCl2 and 2 mM MnCl2 for 60 min at 25°C with stirring(15Fischl A.S. Kennedy E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5445-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Apo-ACP was then purified following the procedure of Rock and Cronan (14Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) to yield 60 mg of apo-ACP/liter of culture. A 500-g frozen block of E. coli K-12 cells (ATCC 14948) grown to 3/4 log phase (University of Alabama Fermentation Facility) was broken into smaller pieces with a mallet and added to 1 liter of 50 mM Tris, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM benzamidine, 50 μM CoA, and 5% (w/v) glycerol, titrated to pH 8.1 with 1 M MES. The cells were lysed by a single passage through an Amicon French pressure cell at 8000-16,000 p.s.i. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 30 min to yield 1.5 liters of crude extract. The supernatant was added to 150 g of DE-52 slurry in 50 mM Tris•HCl, pH 8.0, and mixed gently for 15 min at 4°C. DE-52 was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was treated once again with 150 g of DE-52, pH 8.0. After the removal of the DE-52 resin, the supernatant was clarified further by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min. The clarified extract (1.3 liter) was titrated to pH 6.5 with a saturated MES solution and was then loaded at a flow rate of 10 ml/min onto a 3 × 30-cm SP-Sepharose column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), which had been pre-equilibrated with 50 mM MES, 10 mM MgCl2, 5% (w/v) glycerol, pH 6.1 (Buffer A). After the extract was loaded, the column was washed with 750 ml of Buffer A while collecting 25-ml fractions. The column was then eluted with a linear 0-1 M NaCl gradient (1 liter) in Buffer A. Active fractions were pooled to yield 190 ml. This 190 ml of SP-Sepharose-purified material was next loaded at a flow rate of 2 ml/min onto a 2.5 × 4.0-cm Affi-Gel 15 apo-ACP affinity column (Bio-Rad; prepared following the manufacturer's instructions) while collecting 25-ml fractions. The column was washed with 100 ml of Buffer A, and ACPS was then eluted with 50 ml of 6 M guanidinium HCl in 50 mM MES, pH 6.1, while collecting 8-ml fractions. ACPS activity was reconstituted by diluting the guanidinium HCl to a final concentration ≤2 M in the assay mixture. Active fractions were pooled to yield 16 ml, which was then dialyzed against 2 × 1 liter of Buffer A to yield ~0.2 mg of protein of apparent 70,000-fold purity (Table 1). Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE analysis (16Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar) revealed the presence of only a few major bands (Fig. 3). Previous purifications had demonstrated that the 14-kDa band copurified with the ACPS activity (data not shown). Aliquots (500 μl) of the affinity-purified protein were concentrated by acetone precipitation. The precipitated protein was resolved by 16% T, 6% C Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE and then electroblotted to a Pro-Blot membrane (Applied Biosystems Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were visualized by staining briefly with 0.1% Amido Black in 1% acetic acid. The 14-kDa protein was excised and submitted for N-terminal sequencing.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Figure 3Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE analysis of fractions from purification of wild-type and recombinant ACPS.

E. coli strain BW13711, a gift from Professor Barry Wanner of Purdue University, has a lacX74 deletion of the entire lac operon but is otherwise wild-type E. coli K-12 that has been cured of λ and the F factor. The forward primer incorporated an NdeI restriction site at the start codon: 5′-TGTACCTCAGACCATATGGCAATATTAGGTTTAGGCACGG-3′. The reverse primer incorporated a HindIII restriction site after the stop codon: 5′-TGATGTCAGTCAAGCTTAACTTTCAATAATTACCGTGGCA-3′. The resulting polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned into the NdeI/HindIII site of the pET22b expression plasmid (Novagen) using standard molecular biology procedures and designated pDPJ(17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1992Google Scholar). E. coli BL21(DE3) was transformed with supercoiled pDPJ. Three 1-liter cultures of E. coli BL21(DE3)pDPJ in 2 × YT media supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin were grown at 37°C, 250 rpm to an O.D. of 0.8-1.0 before transferring the cultures to 30°C, 250 rpm and inducing with 100 μM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside. Cultures were grown at 30°C for an additional 3 h and were then harvested by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended (5 ml/g, wet cell mass) in 50 mM Tris•HCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 5% glycerol, pH 8.0 (Buffer B), and lysed by two passages through a French pressure cell at 10,000-15,000 p.s.i. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min. The cell free extract was then treated twice with an equal volume of DE-52 slurry (pH 8.0). The DE-52 supernatant was adjusted to pH 6.5 with a saturated MES solution and loaded onto a 3 × 30-cm SP-Sepharose column, which had been pre-equilibrated with Buffer A. The column was washed with 250 ml Buffer A. ACPS was then eluted with a linear 500-ml, 0-1 M NaCl gradient. In order to initiate purification of ACPS, we sought a rapid and reliable assay for monitoring ACPS activity through the purification process. Of the several methods described for the in vitro determination of ACPS activity(11Elovson J. Vagelos P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3603-3611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Elhussein S.A. Miernyk J.A. Ohlrogge J.B. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 13Polacco M.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5750-5754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we chose the direct-discontinuous radioassay employing [pantetheinyl-3H]CoA and apo-ACP. The amount of ACPS activity is measured by monitoring the rate at which radiolabeled pantetheine gets incorporated into holo-ACP. Radiolabeled holo-ACP is quantified by co-precipitation with bovine serum albumin using 10% trichloroacetic acid, followed by liquid scintillation counting of the protein pellet. The formation of 3H-labeled holo-ACP was confirmed by autoradiography of 20% native polyacrylamide gels. Earlier reports had indicated that ACPS is a basic protein, which would not bind to anion exchange resins(11Elovson J. Vagelos P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3603-3611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 3-fold purification was thereby quickly achieved by batchwise DE-52 treatment. The DE-52 supernatant was then adsorbed onto the cation exchanger resin SP-Sepharose. Following an extensive wash, the column was eluted using a linear NaCl gradient (0-1 M). ACPS activity eluted at approximately 0.35 M NaCl. The submicromolar Km of ACPS for apo-ACP previously measured with 780-fold purified enzyme (11Elovson J. Vagelos P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3603-3611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested a very tight binding interaction suitable for affinity chromatography. We linked apo-ACP to an Affi-Gel 15 matrix and found that ACPS activity was indeed tightly retained by the apo-ACP affinity column. ACPS activity did not elute with either high salt or low pH, although it did elute with apo-ACP. Unfortunately, apo-ACP elution was not suitable for subsequent purification steps, since separation of the apo-ACP from ACPS was difficult and trace contaminants in the apo-ACP preparation prevented identification of the low abundance ACPS protein. The elution requirement was satisfied when we determined that we could refold ACPS and reconstitute its activity following elution with chaotropes under denaturing conditions by subsequent dilution of the denaturant. While both urea and guanidinium HCl proved suitable for this purpose, guanidinium HCl (6 M) was chosen as the preferred eluant to minimize the risk of N-terminal carbamylation of the target protein. Guanidinium HCl elution of ACPS activity from the apo-ACP affinity column yielded an apparent 70,000-fold purified preparation. Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE analysis (16Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar) revealed the presence of only a few major bands (Fig. 3). Previous purifications had demonstrated that the 14-kDa band copurified with the ACPS activity (data not shown). Using the standard Tris•glycine SDS-PAGE analysis, the 14-kDa protein migrated with the buffer front, greatly hampering initial detection of a candidate band for N-terminal sequence analysis. Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE analysis offers greater resolution of low molecular weight proteins and was therefore used for all subsequent analyses of ACPS containing fractions. Superdex-75 gel filtration chromatography of the ACPS preparation indicated a native molecular weight of approximately 30,000, suggesting that the native enzyme is a homodimer (data not shown). The 14-kDa protein was electroblotted and submitted for N-terminal sequencing. Twenty-five cycles of N-terminal sequencing yielded a primary sequence of AILGLGTDIVEIARIEAVIARSGDR. A BLAST search (18Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) of the non-redundant protein data base revealed that the 14-kDa protein is encoded by dpj (downstream of pyridoxal j), the second gene in the pdxJ operon(19Takiff H.E. Baker T. Copeland T. Chen S.M. Court D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1544-1553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The dpj gene was amplified from the E. coli genome by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into the NdeI/HindIII restriction site of the pET22b vector (Novagen). Induction of E. coli BL21(DE3)pDPJ and purification of the ACPS activity yielded 50 mg of protein with >95% purity and 320 milliunits/mg specific activity (Table 2). This corresponds to at least one-half the specific activity of the partially pure wild-type preparation. This difference is most probably due to errors associated with quantification of the dilute wild-type protein preparation using the Bradford protein assay. DNA sequencing of the pDPJ construct confirmed the recombinant sequence was correct (Dana-Farber Molecular Biology Core Facility, Boston, MA). The 14-kDa overproduced recombinant protein was blotted and submitted for N-terminal sequencing, which confirmed the first 10 residues as the dpj gene product. Mass spectrometric analysis indicated a molar mass of 13,950 within 0.2% of the calculated mass of 13,922. Incorporation of the [3H]phosphopantetheine moiety into apo-ACP by recombinant enzyme was again confirmed by 20% native gel electrophoresis, followed by autoradiography (Fig. 2). Holo-ACP migrates slightly faster than apo-ACP on 20% native-PAGE (14Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mass spectral analysis of unlabeled enzymatic holo-ACP product indicated a molecular weight of 8841 (calculated 8847) in contrast to an observed molecular weight of 8518 (calculated 8508) for the apo-ACP substrate. Steady-state kinetics on recombinant ACPS using the [3H]CoA radioassay yielded a Km value of 50 μM for CoA. As previously reported with partially purified ACPS(11Elovson J. Vagelos P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3603-3611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we observed substrate inhibition at apo-ACP concentrations greater than 2 μM. However, we were able to assign an upper limit of ~1 μM to the Km value for apo-ACP. An apparent kcat value of ~10 min-1 was measured at saturating CoA and 50 μM apo-ACP. Identical Km values were obtained for apo-ACP and CoA with wild-type ACPS under the same assay conditions. Differences between our kinetic constants and those reported previously, 0.4 μM and 150 μM for Km(apo-ACP) and Km(CoA), respectively(11Elovson J. Vagelos P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3603-3611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are most likely attributable to variations in the apo-ACP and CoA substrate preparations and the assay conditions employed.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Takiff et al. identified dpj as an essential gene in E. coli by using mini-Tn10 transposons to isolate conditionally lethal mutants(19Takiff H.E. Baker T. Copeland T. Chen S.M. Court D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1544-1553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of tetracycline, a transposon insertion between an essential gene and its natural promoter leads to a lethal phenotype. Tetracycline in the growth medium induces divergent transcription of the tetA and tetR genes within the transposon. This transcription extends beyond the transposon in both directions into the bacterial genes. In this manner, essential genes can be screened by using a conditional growth phenotype dependent upon the presence of tetracycline. These researchers found that transposon insertion into a pyridoxal biosynthetic gene (pdxJ) induced such a phenotype. Upon further analysis, an essential gene downstream of pdxJ, designated dpj, was identified. Takiff et al. were able to define the pdxJ operon as a complex operon comprised of two genes, pdxJ and dpj. They were unable to find any evidence suggesting dpj was related to pyridoxal biosynthesis; however, they did note that dpj contains rare codons characteristic of E. coli genes that are expressed at low levels. This correlates with the fact that even at 70,000-fold apparent purity ACPS is not homogeneous (Fig. 3). Lam et al. (20Lam H.M. Tancula E. Dempsey W.B. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1554-1567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) further characterized a series of mini-Mud insertions in pdxJ and dpj and identified three classes of suppressors, including mutations in the protease lon. A model proposed in their study suggested that lon may be proteolyzing a second protein, which complements dpj mutants. Interestingly, at least three proteins are known to be labeled when E. coli SJ16, a pantetheine auxotrophic strain, is grown in the presence of [3H]β-alanine(21Gerngross T.U. Snell K.D. Peoples O.P. Sinskey A.J. Csuhai E. Masamune S. Stubbe J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9311-9320Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). These proteins are ACP, the serine-activating enzyme in enterobactin biosynthesis (EntF) which we have previously shown to contain 4′-PP and have L-serine activating function(6Rusnak F. Sakaitani M. Drueckhammer D. Reichart J. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2916-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and a 35-kDa protein of unknown identity. One could propose that there are several isoforms of ACPS within E. coli each specific for its own substrate. Perhaps a mutation in lon prevents proteolysis of an ACPS isoform with relaxed specificity, which complements mutations in dpj. It is not yet known whether EntF or the 35-kDa protein are substrates for ACPS. We have purified wild-type holo-ACP synthase (ACPS) to homogeneity from E. coli and have used N-terminal peptide sequence to identify dpj as the gene which encodes ACPS. ACPS appears to be a homodimer with a native molecular weight of 28,000. Overexpression of dpj has allowed the isolation of > 10 mg of active recombinant ACPS. Surprisingly, a search of the GenBank data bases including the recently reported Haemophilus influenzae genome (22Fleischmann R.D. et al.Science. 1995; 269: 496-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (4702) Google Scholar) revealed no known genes that share significant homology with dpj. We anticipate that dpj will serve as a valuable tool for the cloning of other ACPSs and will assist in the heterologous overproduction of appropriately modified 4′-PP requiring enzymes, such as PhbC(21Gerngross T.U.

In order to more accurately reflect its newly determined function, we propose a redesignation of the dpj gene as acpS. We thank Professor John E.

https://openalex.org/W1997554053,"Unstable hemoglobins and oxidative conditions tend to produce hemichromes which demonstrably release their heme to the erythrocyte membrane, with consequent lipid peroxidation and cell lysis. High levels of non-heme iron are also found in such circumstances, but the origin of this iron is uncertain. In the present work, we show that reduced glutathione (GSH) is able to degrade heme in solution with a pH optimum of 7. Degradation depended on the presence of oxygen and on heme and GSH concentrations. It was inhibited by catalase and superoxide dismutase, implicating the involvement of perferryl reactive species in the process of heme degradation. Heme degradation at pH 7 and 37°C is rapid (t1/2 = 70 s) and results in the release of iron from heme. Heme that was dissolved in red blood cell ghosts is also degraded by GSH with a concomitant increase in non-heme iron, most of which (75%) remains associated with the cell membrane. Loading of intact erythrocytes with heme was followed by time-dependent decrease of membrane-associated heme and caused an acceleration of the hexose monophosphate shunt due to the production of H2O2 and the oxidation of intracellular GSH. Most of the activation of the hexose monophosphate pathway was due to redox cycling of iron, since iron chelators inhibited it considerably. These results explain the origin of non-heme iron found in the membrane of sickle cells and the oxidative stress that is observed in these and other abnormal erythrocytes."

We have detected deletions in mouse mtDNA which resemble those found in elderly humans or patients with certain mtDNA disorders. Five different mtDNA deletions, predicted from the positions of short, direct DNA repeats, were present in aged, but not young, mice. Deleted regions were surrounded by either exact or inexact repeats and occurred in both the major and minor regions of the mtDNA genome. The abundance of a particular deletion was generally related to the thermodynamic stability of the bounding repeat sequence. Deletions in aged mice were present at low levels (less than 0.01% of total mtDNA). However, in contrast to results from aged humans, deletions were more abundant in liver than in brain, heart, or skeletal muscle. These results make it possible to predict the location and relative abundance of deletions in any sequenced mtDNA, including inbred mouse strains differing in inherent natural lifespan.

Mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 1The abbreviations used are: mtDNAmitochondrial DNAKSSKearns-Sayre syndromePCRpolymerase chain reactionkbkilobase(s). is a closed circular DNA molecule of approximately l6 kb; several thousand mtDNA molecules are present in the average somatic cell. Deletions in human mtDNA have been associated with several mitochondrial disorders, including Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS), progressive external ophthalmoplegia, and Pearson's marrow-pancreas syndrome (1-3; for review see (4Wallace D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1175-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar)). These mtDNA deletions vary in size but usually delete genes encoding proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation as well as tRNAs and rRNAs needed for their synthesis. Specific deletion events have been characterized in a number of patients. The most common KSS deletion (4977 kb) is flanked by a 13-base pair direct repeat(5Schon E.A. Rizzuto R. Moraes C.T.

Differences between individuals and in measurement methods may account for some of the variability; in addition, significant regional variation was seen in brain. The low levels seen in aged individuals, compared to the much higher amounts in affected patients, make the role of mtDNA deletions in the aging process unclear. Using a PCR approach, we detected deletions in the mtDNA of aged mice; their location and abundance were predicted from the presence of direct DNA repeats in the mtDNA sequence. The observation of mtDNA deletions in mice makes possible a systematic examination of these deletions and their physiological significance. Tissue samples from 13 aged (18.5-27 months old) and 12 young (6 week old) C57 or NMRI mice were homogenized, digested with proteinase K in 0.5% SDS, and total DNA purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation(21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1989Google Scholar). PCR products were purified using QIAquick-spin PCR purification columns (Qiagen) and sequenced using a “fmol” DNA Sequencing System (Promega). Individual deletion products were cloned into a pGEM-T vector (Promega) and the plasmid DNA sequenced. Direct repeats in the mouse and rat mtDNA sequences were found using the Genetics Computer Group, Inc. program Repeat(22Bibb M.J. Van Etten R.A. Wright C.T. Walberg M.W. Clayton A.

Initial selection was by GC content and the distance between repeats. The relative stability (ΔG°25) of a helix formed between two direct repeats was estimated by summing the individual nearest-neighbor interactions(25Breslauer K.J. Frank R. Blöcker H. Marky L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3746-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar, 26Peritz A.E. Kierzek R. Sugimoto N. Turner D.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6428-6436Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar); ΔG°25 for helix initiation was omitted as it is constant for each helix. The destabilizing contribution of a single-base mismatch (internal loop) in DNA and RNA model oligonucleotides ranges from −0.6 to +2.1 kcal/mol; it depends on both the mismatched base and surrounding base pairs(26Peritz A.E. Kierzek R. Sugimoto N. Turner D.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6428-6436Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 27Aboul-ela F. Koh D. Tinoco Jr., I.

Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4068-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Because values have not been determined for any of the mismatch/surrounding base pair examples studied here, existing data were averaged to give the ΔG°25 of +1.2 kcal/mol used in our estimates. PCR primers (Table 1) were selected with the computer program Oligo 4.0 (National BioSciences, Inc.). Those mtDNAs containing a deletion between repeats spaced 3-5 kb apart were specifically amplified using a short PCR cycle (Taq DNA polymerase (Promega); 94°, 40 s; 50°, 20 s; 72°, 40 s; 30 cycles) to prevent synthesis of a full-length product from undeleted mtDNA. A “hot start” (29Bloch W. Amplifications. 1992; 8: 1-3Google Scholar) procedure with paraffin wax (Aldrich) as a barrier was used to increase accuracy and sensitivity.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Plasmid pDMM (Deleted MtDNA Mimic) is a positive control for detection and measurement of a mtDNA lacking the DNA between the “D-1” direct repeats (Table 2). pDMM contains mouse mtDNA sequences (from 8420 to 9226 joined to 12,932-14,251) inserted into pBS- (Stratagene). The PCR product amplified from pDMM is 142 bp longer than from mtDNA with a D-1 deletion.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Plasmid pTMM (Total MtDNA Mimic) was used as a standard to measure total mtDNA in a DNA sample. A PCR-derived fragment of mouse mtDNA(645-999) was ligated into pBS- at the SmaI site; the insert was cut at its unique BstXI site and 301 bp of the human carbonic anhydrase III cDNA (697-812 plus 1140-1324) was inserted. The PCR product from mouse mtDNA (using primers PL47 and PL48) is 355 bp; the product from pTMM is 656 bp. Plasmids pTMM and pDMM were purified by CsCl-ethidium bromide centrifugation and concentrations determined by absorbance at 260 nm and fluorometry. To show that the plasmids were internally consistent, appropriate amounts were digested to release the common vector backbone, electrophoresed, blotted, hybridized to a vector probe, and the radioactive band analyzed on a Betascope 603 blot analyzer (Betagen) to insure a 1:1 molar ratio. Standards were serially diluted in 1.0 ng/μl λDNA and added to PCR reactions. The intensity on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels of the plasmid-derived PCR bands were compared to mtDNA bands to determine absolute amounts. The mtDNA deletions observed in patients with certain mitochondrial disorders or at low levels in older humans are often associated with direct sequence repeats. We searched mouse and rat mtDNA (22Bibb M.J. Van Etten R.A. Wright C.T. Walberg M.W. Clayton A. Cell. 1981; 26: 167-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar, 23Gadaleta G. Pepe G. De Candia G. Quagliariello C. Sbisa E. Saccone C. J. Mol. Evol. 1989; 28: 497-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) for direct repeats; numerous pairs of exact (or inexact) repeats (12 nucleotides or longer) are present. Several repeat pairs (Table 2) were selected that: 1) were relatively G/C-rich, 2) did not span either the light or heavy strand origins of mtDNA replication, and 3) were sufficiently distant that a deleted mtDNA could be distinguished from an intact molecule by a short-cycle PCR protocol(11Cortopassi G.A. Arnheim N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6927-6933Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). The positions of these repeats in relation to important features of the mouse mtDNA genome are shown in Fig. 1. Mouse mtDNA repeat D-1 is the longest exact match and has a high estimated stability. Relevant features of the D-1 direct repeats, several other repeat pairs, and PCR primers are shown in Table 1 and Table 2. PCR primers PL51/PL52 amplify a 4614-bp product from undeleted mtDNA under standard PCR conditions; mtDNA with a D-1 deletion yields a product of 748 bp. PCR amplification using a short PCR cycle to suppress synthesis of product from wild-type mtDNA revealed a possible D-1 deletion product in several tissues of a 19.5-month-old NMRI mouse (Fig. 2A). Southern blotting and DNA sequencing (not shown) confirmed that the 748 bp bands are products of mtDNA with one D-1 repeat and the intervening DNA deleted. Most tissues contained deleted mtDNA. We emphasize that this result is not quantitative; both the actual amount of DNA in 1 O.D. unit of a “standard” DNA preparation (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1989Google Scholar) can vary between samples, and different tissues have different mtDNA to nuclear DNA ratios. For example, heart (Fig. 2A), appears to have low levels of the D-1 deletion. Measurement by the quantitative assay described below showed this DNA sample to be low in both amplifiable mtDNA and nuclear DNA; the actual percentage of deleted mtDNA was similar to that of lung mtDNA. Several other aged mice had the same relative levels of the 3867 bp D-1 mtDNA deletion seen in Fig. 2A (data not shown). Based on this result, 12 additional aged mice were examined for the presence of the 748-bp D-1 deletion product in tissues of varied embryonic origin and metabolic function (brain, heart, and liver; Fig. 1, B-D). All 13 aged mice had deleted mtDNA, although not all tissues were positive in every animal. A similar search was made for D-1 deletions in several tissues of one young (6 week) C57 mouse (Fig. 3A) and in liver, heart, and brain DNA of 11 additional young C57 mice. In several independent PCR assays, no D-1 deletion products were seen in tissues of this one mouse nor in the other 11 heart or liver DNAs (data not shown). Faint 748 bp bands were visible in some young brain DNA samples (Fig. 3B); they hybridized to a mtDNA probe and were amplified by PCR primers internal to the original PL51/PL52 primer pair (data not shown). Occasionally, PCR amplification of other young mouse tissue DNAs showed very faint D-1 deletion bands. In these tissues, the amount of total mtDNA in young and old animals was comparable (data not shown). Estimates of deleted mtDNA amounts are discussed below. Hybridization to a mtDNA probe (lacking the PCR primer sequences) and/or reamplification with a second pair of internal PCR primers and DNA sequencing were used to confirm the identity of PCR products; size alone is not sufficient. The possibility that PCR “jumping” (replication slippage involving the D-1 repeats during PCR) or some other PCR artifact could generate the short, 748-bp D-1 deletion product was also considered. As one control, an AatII-XhoI fragment (bp 7488-13,551) of mtDNA (shown in Fig. 1.) was cloned into pUC12. The resulting Undeleted Mitochondrial Mimic plasmid (pUMM) was digested with AatII, electrophoresed, and full-length linear pUMM (containing the D-1 repeats and the entire intervening sequence) isolated. This linear fragment was used as a PCR template, for 30, 60, or 30 cycles followed by 30 cycles with internal primers. No deletion products were seen using this template, although full-length products were seen with longer PCR cycles (data not shown). Cortopassi and Arnheim (11Cortopassi G.A. Arnheim N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6927-6933Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar) used a fluctuation method to show that deletion products arose from pre-existing deleted mtDNAs in humans. We carried out similar (albeit less exhaustive) experiments with equivalent results. Finally, if the D-1 deletion product results from a PCR artifact, it should be equally abundant in both young and old mice. Instead, while mtDNA contents of young and old mice are similar, the D-1 deletion is easily detected in most old mice but only rarely seen in young mice, in many repetitions of the PCR reactions. Total mtDNA was measured by amplifying a 354-bp product from mtDNA (using primers PL47 and PL48) from 10 ng of total mouse DNA in the presence of increasing amounts of pTMM (Fig. 4A). The concentration of pTMM where the two product bands are of equal intensity (Fig. 4A, lane 5) indicates that equal numbers of the two targets were present. This amount was adjusted for size differences in the PCR products and the template molecules. Similarly, deleted mtDNA was measured by co-amplifying (using primers PL51 and PL52) 1 μg of mouse DNA in the presence of increasing amounts of pDMM (Fig. 4B). Because the amount of DNA (measured by absorption at 260 nm) in PCR reactions may vary and because the ratio of defective to normal molecules is critical for oxidative phosphorylation potential, the percentage of deleted molecules rather than the amount of deletions in a sample was considered to be important. The percentage of the D-1 (3867 bp) deletion in total mtDNA was determined for the tissue DNAs in Fig. 2A, the liver DNAs in Fig. 2B, and for representative brain (Fig. 2C, animals 2, 5, and 12) and heart DNAs (Fig. 2D, animals 1, 2, and 12). For the NMRI mouse shown in Fig. 2A, deleted mtDNA was most abundant in the liver (3.3 × 10-3%), kidney (9.25 × 10-4%) and lung (5 × 10-4%), and less abundant in heart (3.3 × 10-4%), skeletal muscle (2 samples, 1.33 × 10-4% and 5 × 10-5%) and brain (5.8 × 10-5%). Although the brain DNA sample had an abundance of deleted molecules, the percentage was low because the brain is rich in mtDNA; this was seen in all brain samples examined. Deleted mtDNAs were too low to measure in tail, skin, and spleen. These same relative levels were also seen in the other animals. Deleted mtDNA was always most abundant in the liver, ranging from 3.3 × 10-3% to 6 × 10-2%. It was less abundant in the heart (1.8 × 10-5% to 3.3 × 10-4%) and brain (3.5 × 10-5% to 8 × 10-5%). The small amount of deleted mtDNA detected in brain DNA of some young animals was approximately 0.5-2.0 fg, near the detection limit of our PCR assay (the amount in old brain was typically 10-fold higher). The detection limit was determined by measuring the amount of deleted mtDNA in liver DNA of an old mouse and serially diluting this DNA 1:1 with liver DNA from a young mouse (where deletion products were not visible). The minimum detectable level of deleted mtDNA is 0.5-1.0 fg, against a “background” of 1 μg of total mouse DNA. We can detect lower levels of plasmid controls in reactions that lack a total DNA background. Primers may possibly bind to either nuclear DNA or undeleted mtDNA, effectively reducing the amount available to amplify deleted mtDNA (increasing primer concentration increases non-mtDNA artifact bands). Other repeated sequences that might produce deletions are present in mouse mtDNA. Relative positions of the repeats are shown in Fig. 1. The potential deletion(s), primers, and PCR product size(s) derived from deleted mtDNA molecules are shown in Table 2. We used primer pair PL68/PL69 (Table 1 and Table 2) to search for deletions in the liver mtDNA of the same 13 old mice (Fig. 5A). Primers PL68 and PL69 flank at least three repeat pairs (Table 2); we predicted products of 875 bp (D-2 repeats), 1244 bp (D-1 repeat), and 1385 bp (D-3 repeat). Multiple bands are visible. Southern blotting and DNA sequencing confirmed the D-1 and D-3 deletion products of 1244 and 1385 bp were present (data not shown). The 875-bp D-2 deletion product was not detectable and could not be detected even after 60 PCR cycles. A band of 675 bp also hybridized with the mtDNA probe; DNA sequencing showed this band resulted from a PCR false priming event with PL69 at position 12711-12720 in mouse mtDNA, a nine out of 10 match occurs at the 3′ end. The remaining bands visible in Fig. 4A were not of mitochondrial origin. MtDNA deletions may also occur at inexact DNA repeats, i.e. direct repeats with one or more mismatches between them (D-13 to D-18 in Table 2). Primer pair PL69/PL70 amplifies a 445-bp product from mtDNA with a D-13 deletion. This product was visible in liver DNA from nine of 13 animals after 30 PCR cycles (Fig. 5B). A second inexact deletion, D-14, was not seen with a single PCR amplification using PL77/PL78 but was easily detectable after a second round of amplification with internal PCR primers (data not shown). Deletions arising from the D-16 repeat have never been detected. All of these deletions occur within base pairs 5,192-15,417 of mtDNA, the region first replicated by the newly initiated heavy strand as it proceeds toward the light strand origin (the “major” region). Direct repeat sequences also exist in the 5191 bp replicated subsequently (the “minor” region, from the light strand origin returning to the heavy strand origin). Two pairs of repeated sequences (D-17, D-18, Table 2) within the minor region were examined as potential inducers of deletions. An abundant deletion product was observed for D-17 (Fig. 5C) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The second pair of direct repeats, D-18, does not seem to induce deletions (see below). We also searched for D-3, D-13, and D-17 deletions in brain and heart DNA of six old mice and brain and liver DNA of six young mice. These deletions were present in both tissues of old mice, with D-1 and D17 again being the most visible. In contrast, only a few young mice had barely detectable levels of the D-17 deletion in liver and brain DNAs (data not shown). Finally, to examine the generality of our predictions, we searched the rat mtDNA sequence (23Gadaleta G. Pepe G. De Candia G. Quagliariello C. Sbisa E. Saccone C. J. Mol. Evol. 1989; 28: 497-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) for direct repeats. A highly stable repeat is present (Table 2); PCR amplification revealed deleted mtDNA in liver of two aged rats (data not shown). Similar results were reported (30Gadaleta M.N. Rainaldi G. Lezza A.M.S. Milella F. Fracasso F. Cantatore P. Mutation Res. 1992; 275: 181-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 31Linnane A.W. Zhang C. Baumer A. Nagley P. Mutation Res. 1992; 275: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) while this work was in progress. We sequenced D-1 and D-3 PCR products from several animals, to confirm that they were amplified from a deleted mtDNA molecule and to determine the deletion junctions. In addition, 29 clones of the D-1 PCR product, derived from two different animals and PCR reactions, were sequenced. In all, the deletions occurred exactly at a repeat; one copy of a direct repeat and the intervening sequence was lost. However, sequencing of cloned PCR products from deletions associated with inexact repeats (D-13, D-14, and D-17) revealed that deletions could occur at different positions within a repeat. 2S. M.

Important questions regarding the involvement of mtDNA deletions in degenerative diseases and aging, i.e. the tissue and cellular distribution of deletions, the kinetics of their appearance, and the underlying mechanisms, are difficult to approach in human subjects. Although speculation is common in the literature that damage to mtDNA is an important factor in aging(32Cortopassi G.A. Shibata D. Soong N.-W. Arnheim N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7370-7374Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 33Wallace D.C. Science. 1992; 256: 628-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar, 34Linnane A.W. Marzuki S. Ozawa T. Tanaka M.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8739-8746Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), critical proof for a direct relationship is lacking. A decrease in mtDNA integrity could cause an overall decline in cell and tissue function with age. Alternatively, the increased level of mtDNA deletions and point mutations seen in elderly humans may simply reflect an accumulation of repair and replication errors occurring over time, with little relevance to the aging process. Limited direct evidence exists to support a role for mtDNA damage in aging. While deleted mtDNA molecules are present in aged individuals, they are uncommon, with a single deletion generally constituting much less than 0.1% of total mtDNA. In contrast, human Kearns-Sayre patients have at least 20-80% deleted mtDNA molecules before symptoms of myopathy are seen(10Holt I.J. Harding A.E. Cooper J.M. Schapira A.H.V. Toscano A. Clark J.B. Morgan-Hughes J.A. Ann. Neurol. 1989; 26: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). However, the total damage to mtDNA during aging is difficult to estimate, as many mtDNA deletions and point mutations are possible and could accumulate with age(37Münscher C. Rieger T. Müller-Höcker J. Kadenbach B. FEBSLett. 1993; 317: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Mouse models suitable for aging studies have been described(38Baker G.T. Sprott R.L. Exp. Geront. 1988; 23: 223-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 39Sprott R.L. Neurobiol. Aging. 1991; 12: 635-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar); inbred mouse strains differ in inherent life span and their life span can be further modified by environmental factors such as dietary restriction(40Weindruch R. Walford R.L. Science. 1982; 215: 1415-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 41Masoro E.J. Lab. Anim. Sci. 1992; 42: 132-137PubMed Google Scholar). We show here that it is possible to predict the presence and position of multiple deletions in the mtDNA of aged mice. Knowing the position of such frequently occurring mtDNA deletions will allow accurate measurements of their accumulation with time in these animals and make possible a critical test of their potential role in aging. Six different deletions were observed in mtDNA of aged mice and rats (Table 2). The position and relative abundance of the individual deletions that we detected depend on the thermodynamic stability of direct repeats in the mtDNA sequences. Previous studies examining deletions in mouse mtDNA were not predictive(42Boursot P. Yonekawa H. Bonhomme F. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 46-55PubMed Google Scholar, 43Pikó L. Hougham A.J. Bulpitt K.J. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1988; 43: 279-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 44Pikó L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 663: 450-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 45Chung S.S. Weindruch R.

Commun. 1994; 202: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Because we searched for deletions at predicted locations, PCR primers could be designed for efficient amplification and optimal product size. This approach tends to reduce or eliminate PCR artifactual bands, which is important for accurate quantitation. While this work was in progress, a similar strategy was used to detect the rat mtDNA deletion also observed here(30Gadaleta M.N. Rainaldi G. Lezza A.M.S. Milella F. Fracasso F. Cantatore P. Mutation Res. 1992; 275: 181-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 31Linnane A.W. Zhang C. Baumer A. Nagley P. Mutation Res. 1992; 275: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Although mtDNA deletions were readily detected using PCR, the amount of deleted mtDNA present in aged mice was small. Both the absolute level and the percentage of the D-1 deletion in mtDNA of mouse tissues was quite low, ranging from a high of 0.06% (liver) to 2 × 10-5% (brain) to undetectable (less than 0.5 fg), in individual animals. Levels of the other deletions were similar or lower, as estimated from relative band intensity and dilution experiments. Deletions were detectable in each of the 13 aged mice examined, although not every mouse was positive in every tissue for every deletion. In agreement with results in human, young mice generally lacked detectable mtDNA deletions, although low levels of some mtDNA deletion products were occasionally seen in brain samples. This is unusual because brain does not accumulate deletions to high levels in aged animals. In contrast, deletions were not detectable in livers of young mice, a tissue that contains abundant deletions in aged mice. The ratio of mitochondrial DNA to nuclear DNA in these two tissues is roughly equivalent. 3S. M. Tannhauser and P. J. Laipis, unpublished results. There are clear differences between the results reported here for aged mice and previous reports from human subjects; such differences suggest that a generalized aging process involving mtDNA deletions may not exist. In mice, the deletions were most abundant in liver, moderately abundant in kidney and lung, and either low or absent in brain, heart, muscle, tail, skin, and blood. This distribution differs from aged humans where deletions are reportedly most abundant in brain, muscle, and heart, and less abundant in liver(14Simonetti S. Chen X. DiMauro S. Schon E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1180: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 34Linnane A.W. Marzuki S. Ozawa T. Tanaka M. Lancet. 1989; 1: 642-645Abstract PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). Different mtDNA measurement methods and individual diversity among the small number of elderly humans examined may account for some, but not all, of the discrepancy. This distribution difference, as well as the differential accumulation with age noted above for brain and liver, while not completely inconsistent with an involvement of mtDNA deletions in aging, does indicate that differences in induction and accumulation do exist between tissues and between species. It has been hypothesized, based on the human data, that mtDNA deletions are most abundant in tissues with high metabolic and low mitotic activity(19Corral-Debrinski M. Horton T. Lott M.T. Shoffner J.M. Beal M.F. Wallace D.C. Nature Genet. 1992; 2: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar, 47Trounce I. Byrne E. Marzuki S. Lancet. 1989; 1: 637-639Abstract PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar), a suggestion that now appears inaccurate. Most tissues in the adult have low mitotic activity; for example, neither neurons nor hepatocytes divide. More importantly, brain and liver have large and equal oxygen consumption rates, the highest among vertebrate tissues(48Newsholme E.A. Leech A.R. Biochemistry for the Medical Sciences. John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., New York1983: 146Google Scholar). The two tissues do differ markedly in their relative sensitivity to anoxia, but the difference results from the presence of stored substrates for ATP production in liver, not a lower metabolic rate in liver than in brain mitochondria. Thus, on the basis of overall mitochondrial function as measured by oxygen consumption, brain and liver are both metabolically active and mitotically quiet, and would be expected to have high deletion levels, yet they differ dramatically. The observed differences in mtDNA deletion levels seen between tissues in mice and humans suggests that environmental and metabolic differences between these species may affect deletion levels more than the aging process. The detailed mechanism(s) producing the deletions and the features of the direct repeats which determine the frequency of a particular mtDNA deletion are not well understood, but the thermodynamic stability of the repeat pairs examined here seems critical to their ability to cause deletions. The most stable repeats that we examined (Table 2) were associated with the most abundant deletions. Deletions were detected in both the major and minor regions of the mtDNA genome. D-17, an abundant deletion, is located in the minor region. Apparently, as long as replication origins are intact, repeat stability is more important than genome position. The D-13 and D-14 repeat pairs are less stable and deletions between them are much less abundant. Three pairs of direct repeats (D-2, D-16, and D-18) never produced a detectable level of deletions. D-16 and D-18 are inexact repeats whose estimated relative stability is the lowest of those calculated. D-2 is the shortest repeat we examined (13 nucleotides) and is estimated to be only slightly more stable than the D-13 and D-14 repeats (Table 2), which produce very low levels of deletions. Given the uncertainties in nearest-neighbor calculations, the agreement appears excellent. It is clearly possible that other factors, such as distance separating repeat pairs or potential secondary structure in mtDNA, might affect the efficiency of the deletion mechanism(s) and modulate the effects of repeat stability. We emphasize that deletions may arise by more than one mechanism, some not involving direct repeats. Some studies of deletions associated with mitochondrial disorders in humans have reported associated repeats as short as four nucleotides. The repeats were often not located precisely at deletion junctions and the deletion encompassed neither, one, or both repeat copies(7Mita S. Rizzuto R. Moraes C.T. Shanske S. Arnaudo E. Fabrizi G.M.

This type of deletion and associated repeat does not fit the pattern seen above. Indeed, most of these repeats are so short and inexactly spaced that their association with the deletion is likely due to chance. Several deletion mechanisms have been proposed(3Rötig A. Cormier V. Blanche S. Bonnefont J-P. Ledeist F. Romero N. Schmitz J. Rustin P. Fischer A. Saudubray J-M. Munnich A. J. Clin.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 493-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), based on the presence of direct repeats at deletion junctions and their sequence characteristics. Sequencing of deletions involving mismatched repeats (D-13, D-14, and D-17) has revealed that deletion events often occur within the repeat rather than precisely at an end, producing a remaining “hybrid” repeat. This result, and the implications of it and secondary structure on the mechanisms responsible for mtDNA deletions, will be discussed separately.2 Finally, the deleted mtDNA molecules present in patients with mitochondrial disorders are believed to arise from a single deleted molecule present very early in development. This deleted molecule is amplified and partitioned during oogenesis and development to comprise the majority population in the affected tissue. DNA sequences of deletion junctions support this hypothesis; patients usually harbor a single deletion. In contrast, our results suggest that the deletions that accumulate in aging mice resulted from independent deletion events because multiple deletions were present in the same tissue. The ability to predict the location of mtDNA deletions in inbred mice now makes it possible to ask whether individual cells within a tissue harbor more than one deletion, how deleted mtDNAs are distributed within the cells of a single tissue, and how the kinetics and abundance of mtDNA deletions are related to aging. Answers to these questions will help us understand the physiological consequences of these deletions and determine if the pattern and rate of accumulation is consistent with a role in aging.

https://openalex.org/W2080681822,"Ca(2+)-dependent neurotransmitter release consists of at least two components: a major fast component that is insensitive to Sr2+ and a minor slow component that is potentiated by Sr2+ (Goda, Y., and Stevens, C. F. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 91, 12942-12946). These results suggest that at least two Ca2+ sensors act in synaptic vesicle fusion with distinct Ca2+ and Sr2+ binding properties. We have now investigated the relative Ca2+ and Sr2+ binding activities of synaptotagmins to evaluate their potential roles as Ca2+ sensors for the fast and slow components. Our results demonstrate that the first C2 domains of synaptotagmins I, II, III, V, and VII have very similar Ca2+ requirements for phospholipid binding (range of EC50 = 2.6 microM to 5.0 microM), but distinct Sr2+ requirements (EC50 range = 23 microM to 133 microM); synaptotagmins I and II had the lowest Sr2+ affinity, and synaptotagmin III the highest Sr2+ affinity. Purified synaptotagmin I from bovine brain exhibited similar properties as its recombinant first C2 domain, suggesting that the first C2 domain fully accounts for its Ca(2+)-dependent phospholipid binding properties. Sr2+ was unable to trigger syntaxin binding by synaptotagmin I at all concentrations tested, whereas it was effective for synaptotagmin III. These results suggest that different C2 domains have distinct Sr2+ binding properties. They support the hypothesis that synaptotagmins localized on the same vesicle perform distinct functions, with synaptotagmins I and II serving as candidate Ca2+ sensors for the fast component in release and synaptotagmin III for the slow component."

Di Lauro R. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5671-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Point mutations in the TTF-1 and HNF-3 binding sites in this proximal SP-B promoter (−111 to −73 bp) eliminated binding of both transcription factors and decreased transcriptional activity of the SP-B promoter construct(4Bohinski R.J. Di Lauro R. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5671-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). In the present report, we identified a distinct enhancer activity in the 5′-flanking region of the human SP-B gene located −439 to −331 nucleotides upstream of the transcriptional initiation site. The hSP-B −439/−331 element activated SV40 promoter activity in forward and reverse orientations in H441-4 cells. Mobility shift assay, point mutation, and transfection assays showed that TTF-1 is the critical nuclear transcription protein activating this SP-B enhancer element in the human gene. The human SP-B promoters with various lengths and regions were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.), synthetic oligonucleotide primers, and the pΔ5′-650 SP-B CAT construct as a template(10Bohinski R.J. Huffman J.A. Whitsett J.A. Lattier D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11160-11166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The upstream primer with the MluI site for the B-281 construct is 5′-CGCACGCGTGAACATGGGAGTCTGGGCAGG. The upstream primer with the MluI site for the B-500 construct is 5′-CGCACGCGTCAGAAGATTTTTCCAGGGGAA. The downstream primer with the XhoI site for the B-281 and the B-500 construct is 5′-GCGCTCGAGCCACTGCAGCAGGTGTGACTC. The upstream primer with the MluI site for the SV40-P F construct is 5′-CGCACGCGTCAGGGCTTGCCCTGGGTTAAG. The downstream primer with the XhoI site for the SV40-P F construct is 5′-GCGCTCGAGGCCTGGGTGTTCCCCTCCCAT. The upstream primer with the MluI site for the SV40-P R is 5′-CGCACGCGTGCCTGGGTGTTCCCCTCCCAT. The downstream primer with the XhoI site for SV40-R construct is 5′-GCGCTCGAGCAGGGCTTGCCCTGGGT TAAG. The PCR products were digested with MluI and XhoI restriction enzymes (Life Technologies, Inc.) and ligated with MluI/XhoI-digested pGL2-B or pGL2-P luciferase reporter plasmids (Promega). The oligonucleotide sequences for the PCR II-C are upstream primer 5′-CAGGGCTTGCCCTGGGTTAAG and downstream primer 5′-GCCTGGGTGTTCCCCTCCCAT. The PCR product was directly subcloned into the PCR II vector as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). To generate the site-specific mutants of B-500 construct at the TTF-1 binding sites, two steps of PCR were conducted. For the first PCR, proper mutant PCR oligonucleotides were synthesized with mutations at the position indicated in Fig. 6A. The mutant primers were mixed with the PGL2-B vector primer GLprimer 1 and GLprimer 2 to make two sets of PCR products that were subsequently purified by low melting point agarose gel electrophoresis and the QIAquick gel extraction kit. The purified PCR products were then mixed together along with GLprimer 1 and GLprimer 2 primers for the second PCR. The second PCR products were digested with MluI/XhoI restriction enzymes for 3 h at the 37°C. The DNA fragments (553 bp) with MluI- and XhoI-flanking sites at each end were purified by low melting point gel electrophoresis as described above and ligated into the MluI/XhoI-digested pGL2-B plasmid to generate B-500 Bam, B-500 Bbm, and B-500 Bcm mutant luciferase constructs. The correctness of all the wild type and mutant plasmid constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. H441-4 cells were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). One day before transfection, 5 × 105 cells were seeded into 60-mm dishes. Each dish was transfected with 12.5 μg of total plasmid DNA using the calcium phosphate precipitation method and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium overnight. The next day, the media were changed to RPMI, and the cells were incubated for 2 days prior to assay. Cell lysis and luciferase assays were performed using the luciferase assay system purchased from Promega. The light units were assayed by luminometry (monolight 2010, Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, California). Transfection efficiency was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Multiple transfections (n = 2-8) were carried out for each experiment, and the mean values were used for data presentation. Standard deviations were generally less than 20%. Plasmids pCMV-Rc (Invitrogen) and pCMV-TTF-1 were kind gifts from Dr. R. Di Lauro, Stazione Biologic, Naples, Italy. H441-4 cells were grown on 75-mm flasks. Before harvesting, cells were washed twice in Hanks' solution. The cell pellet was then resuspended in 5 volumes of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) for 5 min on ice. After centrifugation, the supernatant was saved as cytoplasmic protein extract. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in a 100 μl of nuclear buffer (0.5 M KCl, 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 0.2 mM EDTA, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 25% glycerol, and 1 mM dithiothreitol) and incubated on ice for 30 min. The resulting DNA pellet was spun down, and the supernatant was used as nuclear extract. Protein extract (5 μg) was used for EMSA as described previously(11Yan C. Tamm I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 265: 20188-20194Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Recombinant rat TTF-1 homeodomain (HD) was a kind gift from Dr. Di Lauro. The probes for EMSA were made from either the synthetic oligonucleotides or the PCR product (hSP-B(−439/−331) fragment). The −218 to +41 bp (minimal promoter) and the −500 to +41 bp regions of the human SP-B gene were subcloned into the pGL2-B luciferase reporter gene producing constructs B-218 and B-500 (Fig. 2B). When the B-218 and B-500 promoters were compared with the SV40 and thymidine kinase promoters in H441-4 cells using transient transfection assays, both B-218 and B-500 constructs were more active than the SV40 and thymidine kinase promoters (Fig. 1). Activity of B-500 was 3-4-fold greater than B-218, indicating a potential enhancer element located in the distal upstream region.Figure 1SP-B promoter activity in H441-4 cells. Plasmid DNA (12.5 μg/60-mm dish) was used to transfect H441-4 cells. Cells were transfected with 5 μg of pCMV-βgal and 7.5 μg of construct B, SV40-P, thymidine kinase (a pGL2-B luciferase reporter construct containing the minimal thymidine kinase promoter), B-218, and B-500. Luciferase assays were carried out in duplicate 2 days after transfection.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Nucleotide sequence in the 5′-flanking distal upstream regions of the human and mouse SP-B genes share 95% identity from −439 to −331 bp (human) and −382 to −282 bp (mouse). Deletion of this region in mouse SP-B gene dramatically reduced the transcriptional activity (50-fold reduction) as assayed by transient transfection of the mouse lung epithelial (MLE-15) cell line using the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase reporter gene. 2J. A. Whitsett, C. Yan, and Z. Sever, unpublished observations. In order to determine the biological function of the stimulatory element in the human gene, the hSP-B(−439/−331) sequence was subcloned into the PCR II vector. The final construct, PCR II-C (Fig. 2B, g), was generated using the standard PCR procedure. Transient transfection of the B-500 construct with an excess amount of PCR II-C competitor plasmid reduced transcriptional activity from B-500 to the level of B-218 activity (Fig. 3, lane 4), compared with the 4-fold activity without the PCR II-C competitor. The competition experiments suggested the presence of trans-acting factors that interact with the hSP-B(−439 to −331) element. After carefully examining the hSP-B −439 to −331 region, three distinct CAAG motifs (12Damante G. Fabbro D. Pellizzari L. Civitareale D. Guazzi S. Polycarpou-Schwartz M. Cauci S. Quadrifoglio F. Formisano S. Di Lauro R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3075-3083Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) were found in the hSP-B(−439/−331) fragment, supporting the likelihood that the element contains TTF-1 binding sites (Fig. 2A). EMSA was used to examine the nuclear proteins binding to the hSP-B −439 to −331 region. Smeared DNA-protein complexes with slow mobility were identified using H441-4 cell nuclear extracts (Fig. 4A). No shift in mobility was observed with the cytoplasmic fraction from H441-4 cells (Fig. 4A). DNA oligonucleotide F1, a TTF-1 binding site previously identified in the proximal element of the human SP-B gene (4Bohinski R.J. Di Lauro R. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5671-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), was used as a competitor in EMSA to test whether the nuclear protein binding to the hSP-B(−439/−331) fragment was TTF-1. Fig. 4A demonstrates that the specific interaction between the H441-4 nuclear protein and the radiolabeled hSP-B(−439/−331) fragment was inhibited by adding 100-fold molar excess of F1 fragment or self-competitor. The protein-DNA complexes were retarded with TTF-1 antibody in the supershift analysis (data not shown). When the radiolabeled hSP-B(−439/−331) fragment was incubated with the purified TTF-1 HD protein, three protein-DNA complexes were observed (Fig. 4B, lane 1), consistent with the presence of multiple TTF-1 binding sites in the DNA fragment −439/−331. These TTF-1 complexes were inhibited by adding 50-fold molar excess of self-competitor and the F1 fragment (Fig. 4B, lanes 2 and 3), confirming that TTF-1 interacts with multiple binding sites in the hSP-B(−439/−331) fragment. pCMV-TTF-1 was co-transfected with B-218 and B-500 into H441-4 cells. pCMV-TTF-1 activated transcription of B-218 approximately 4-fold. pCMV-TTF-1 further activated B-500 transcription (11-fold) (Fig. 5A). Because there are two active TTF-1 sites in B-218, it was not possible to discern the distinct contributions of the activity from the three putative TTF-1 sites in the hSP-B(−439/−331) fragment from those in the proximal (F1) element located −111 to −73 bp. The hSP-B(−439/−331) fragment was therefore isolated and ligated to an SV40 promoter-luciferase construct in the forward and reverse orientation producing SV40-P F and SV40-P R (Fig. 2B). The hSP-B(−439/−331) fragment stimulated the SV40 promoter transcriptional activity in both orientations. SV40-P R was more active than SV40-P F (Fig. 5B). Co-transfection of H441-4 cells with pCMV-TTF-1 increased SV40-P F activity 9-fold and SV40-P R activity 19-fold (Fig. 5B). To further confirm that the putative TTF-1 binding to the sites in the hSP-B(−439/−331) fragment mediated transactivation, three wild type TTF-1 sites and three mutant oligonucleotides were synthesized (Fig. 6A), radiolabeled, and incubated with recombinant TTF-1 HD protein and separated by EMSA. Although all three wild type oligonucleotides were shifted by TTF-1 HD, the mobility of mutant oligonucleotides was not altered (Fig. 6B). TTF-1 HD binding to the wild type oligonucleotides were inhibited by 100-fold molar excess of self-competitor. The mutants lacking binding to TTF-1 HD were introduced into the B-500 luciferase expressing construct. Wild type and mutant B-500 constructs mutated at the positions Bam, Bbm, and Bcm were transfected into H441-4 cells. As illustrated in Fig. 6C, site-specific mutations in the B-500 constructs decreased transcriptional activity. Mutations at positions Bam and Bbm reduced transcription to the level of the minimal promoter (B-218) and completely abolished the stimulatory response produced by co-transfection with pCMV-TTF-1. Mutation at the position Bcm only moderately impaired activity. Transcription from the hSP-B(−439/−331) fragment was therefore highly dependent on TTF-1 binding to the region. Surfactant deficiency in premature infants causes respiratory distress syndrome(1Avery M.E. Mead J. Am. J. Dis. Child. 1959; 97: 517-523PubMed Google Scholar). SP-B plays an important role in maintaining the alveolar stability by enhancing the rate of spreading and the stability of phospholipid at the air-water interface. SP-B exerts important effects on phospholipid structures, contributing to tubular myelin formation, and enhances phospholipid uptake by Type II epithelial cells (3Whitsett J.A. Nogee L.M. Weaver T.E. Horowitz A.D. Physiol. Rev. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic ablation of the SPB gene in transgenic mice caused perinatal respiratory failure associated with atelectasis and the lack of both lamellar bodies and tubular myelin in the lungs of newborn SP-B deficient mice(2Clark J.C. Wert S.E. Bachurski C.J. Stahlman M.T. Weaver T.E. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7794-7798Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Precise regulation of SP-B expression is therefore likely critical to surfactant homeostasis and is mediated, at least in part, by transcriptional mechanisms. In the present work, an upstream enhancer sequence was identified in the 5′-flanking region of hSP-B(−439/−331). This distal element is active in the context of the proximal SP-B promoter-enhancer region and also stimulates transcription from a minimal SV40 promoter construct regardless of the orientation. TTF-1 binds to and activates the enhancer at three distinct sites located within the region −439 to −331 of the human SP-B gene. This conclusion is based on several observations: 1) TTF-1 HD binds to the enhancer sequence and forms multiple distinct complexes; 2) nuclear proteins bind to the upstream SP-B enhancer sequence and were competed by a known TTF-1 binding sequence (F1) and supershifted by the TTF-1 antibody; 3) pCMV-TTF-1 expression vector stimulated the SP-B and the SV40 promoters linked to the upstream SP-B enhancer sequence; 4) mutations at the three putative TTF-1 binding sites on the hSP-B(−439/−331) fragment reduced or abolished TTF-1 HD binding transcriptional activity. Dr. Di Lauro and co-workers recently demonstrated that TTF-1 forms intermolecular protein oligomers through its cysteine residues(13Arnone M.I. Zannini M. Di Lauro R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12048-12055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), likely accounting for the heterogeneity of the −438 to −331 region of the SP-B gene. There is increasing evidence supporting the role of TTF-1 in lung development and lung-specific gene expression. The amino acid sequence of TTF-1 has been strongly conserved among mammalian species, canine, rat, and human TTF-1 sharing up to 98% identity(9Ikeda K. Clark J.C. Shaw-White J.R. Stahlman M.T. Boutell C.J. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8108-8114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In the lung, the distribution of TTF-1 expression is consistent with its role in the modulation of surfactant protein expression. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization analysis showed that TTF-1 protein and mRNA were present in a subset of nonciliated bronchiolar epithelial cells in the conducting airways and in the Type II epithelial cells in alveoli. TTF-1 was excluded from the ciliated respiratory epithelial cell and from terminally differentiated Type I epithelial cells in human and rat(9Ikeda K. Clark J.C. Shaw-White J.R. Stahlman M.T. Boutell C.J. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8108-8114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), cells that do not express the surfactant proteins. The present work demonstrates that homeodomain-containing TTF-1 transcription factor binds complex cis-acting elements in an enhancer located −439 to −331 bp from the start of transcription of the human SP-B gene. These findings, as well as those derived from the analysis of SP-A gene(14Bruno M.D. Bohinski R.J. Huelsman K.M. Whitsett J.A. Korfhagen T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6531-6536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), demonstrate that several TTF-1 proteins bind to closely clustered TTF-1 binding sites. Disruption of individual TTF-1 binding sites in each “unit” of the SP-B promoter either abolished or severely impaired the regulatory activity of the element. As shown in Fig. 7, there are at least two such units in the human SP-B gene. Region I consists of two TTF-1 and one HNF-3 binding site and is located between −111 and −73 bp in the hSP-B gene. Region II consists of three TTF-1 binding sites, located in the −439 to −331 bp region 5′ to the transcriptional start site. The TTF-1 cluster sites were also identified in the SP-A, Clara cell secretory protein, and SP-C promoter and enhancer regions. Table 1 summarizes the TTF-1 binding sites in the promoter and enhancer regions of the lung specific genes. These sites have been confirmed to be essential for TTF-1 function. Mutations at these sites either abolished or reduced TTF-1 DNA binding or transactivation activity.Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Many naturally occurring homeodomain DNA binding sites are found in tandem clusters. Cooperativity among the binding sites of homeodomain proteins may serve to increase occupancy of the cis-acting site. This cooperativity may also be influenced by oligomerization of TTF-1 proteins through the Cys residues(13Arnone M.I. Zannini M. Di Lauro R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12048-12055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Cooperativity of clustered protein-DNA binding sites was observed in ultrabithorax gene(15Beacley P.A. Varkey J. Young K.E. Von Kessler D.P. Sun B.I. Ekker S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6941-6956Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). POU family proteins (16LeBowitz J. Clerc R.G. Breiowitz M. Sharp P.A. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 1625-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and homeobox containing human HOX 2.1 proteins (17Galaup C.K. Hauser C.A. New Biol. 1992; 4: 558-568PubMed Google Scholar) also bind to their cognate cis-active elements in a cooperative manner. The functional significance of these binding site clusters may lie in a fine tuning of a target gene regulation by limiting concentrations of the transcription factors. It is tempting to speculate that precise temporal-spatial regulation of TTF-1 concentration in the developing foregut endoderm may determine organ-specific gene expression and development of the lung and thyroid. On the other hand, clusters of homeodomain regulatory proteins may provide potential interacting surfaces and facilitate contact with other nuclear proteins modulating gene expression. A region rich in glutamine and alanine is located C-terminal to the homeodomain region of the TTF-1 peptide(7Guazzi S. Price M. Felice M.D. Damante G. Mattei M.G. Di Lauro R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3631-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). This sequence strongly resembles activator regions of other transcription factors. In general, upstream transcription activators are thought to interact with the basal transcription factors in the promoter (e.g. TAFs in TFIID) to increase gene transcription(18Pabo C.O. Sauer R.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1053-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar, 19Zawel L. Reinberg D. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 67-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). For example, the glutamine-rich activation domain of human SP1 interacts with Drosophila TAFII110(20Hoey T. Weinzierle R.O.J.

Cell. 1993; 72: 247-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), and the acidic activation domain of VP16 interacts with Drosophila TAFII40(21Goodrich J.A. Hoey T. Thut C.J. Admon R. Tjian R. Cell. 1993; 75: 519-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), as well as tumor suppressor protein p53 interacts with TAFII40 and TAFII60(22Thut C.J. Chen J.L. Klemm R. Tjian R. Science. 1995; 267: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), SP1, YY1, USF, CTF, and adenoviral E1A interacting with TAFII55(23Chiang C.M. Roeder R.G. Science. 1995; 267: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), etc. The present findings demonstrate TTF-1-dependent enhancer activity in the distal upstream 5′ region of the SP-B promoter. From previous studies in this laboratory, the binding of TTF-1 proteins in region I of the SP-B gene was dependent upon interactions with general transcriptional factors in the SP-B promoter(4Bohinski R.J. Di Lauro R. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5671-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), functioning in a manner distinct from that of region II. Region I is indispensable for basal transcription of the SP-B promoter and does not act as an enhancer when linked to other basal promoters(4Bohinski R.J. Di Lauro R. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5671-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). In contrast, mutations in the TTF-1 binding sites in the distal element (region II) block TTF-1-dependent enhancer activity but do not block the activity of region I of the human SP-B promoter. It follows that the “extrinsic cooperativity” model described by Ptashne (24Ptashne M. A Genetic Switch Gene Control and Phage. Blackwell and Cell Press, Cambridge, UK1992: 114Google Scholar) may provide a mechanism explaining the distinct behavior of the distal and proximal hSP-B elements. Clusters of TTF-1 proteins in each region would increase the stability of the complex forming a higher order complex with the basal transcription factor machinery.

Little is known about the localization of catalytic and regulatory domains within the subunits of soluble guanylyl cyclase. We used deletion mutagenesis to identify the regions of α1 and β1 subunits that are responsible for cGMP production or NO-heme-mediated activation.The amino terminus of the β1 subunit was necessary for NO stimulation since deletion of the 64 NH2-terminal amino acids resulted in a mutant with intact basal activity but complete loss of NO activation. The amino terminus of the α1 subunit also appeared to be essential for NO sensitivity since deletion of 131 NH2-terminal amino acids of α1 led to markedly reduced NO activation. These results suggest that NH2-terminal regions of α1 and β1 are involved in NO-heme-mediated signal transduction. The NH2 terminally truncated β1 subunit exerted a dominant negative effect exclusively on the NO-stimulated activity of the wild type enzyme, further underlining that the regulatory domain is located within the NH2 terminus of the enzyme. Aside from the structural implications, the mutant represents a powerful tool to investigate nitric oxide-sensitive signaling pathways. Coexpression of the COOH-terminal halves of α1 and β1 were sufficient for basal cGMP production while either of the halves expressed alone was inactive. Therefore the COOH-terminal regions appear to contain sufficient information for dimerization and basal enzymatic activity.Thus, we provide the first evidence that the regulatory and catalytic properties of soluble guanylyl cyclase can be attributed to different regions of the subunits and that the catalytic domain can be functionally expressed separately from the NH2-terminal regulatory domain.

Guanylyl cyclases (GTP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing); EC 4.6.1.2), the enzymes catalyzing the formation of cGMP, exist in membrane-bound and soluble forms. The membrane-bound enzymes are stimulated by different peptide hormones and belong to the group of receptor-linked enzymes with one membrane spanning region(1Garbers D.L. Cell. 1992; 71: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Accordingly, their structure can be divided into three domains: an amino-terminal extracellular ligand-binding domain, an intracellular protein kinase-like domain, which has been proposed to function as a negative regulatory element(2Chinkers M. Garbers D.L. Science. 1989; 245: 1392-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), and the COOH-terminal catalytic region comprising about 250 amino acids responsible for the synthesis of cGMP, as shown by a deletion mutant of the membrane-bound guanylyl cyclase GC-A(3Thorpe D.S.

In contrast to the membrane-bound enzymes which exist as homodimers or higher ordered structures, soluble guanylyl cyclase consists of two different subunits designated α and β, which are both required for catalytic activity(5Koesling D. Böhme E. Schultz G. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2785-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Four subunits have been reported up to date (α1, α2, β1, and β2). The α1β1 heterodimer corresponds to the enzyme purified from bovine lung, whereas the α2 and β2 subunits have been identified by homology screening but have not yet been detected on the protein level. All subunits show some homologies over the whole length of the polypeptide chains; the strongest homologies are found in the COOH-terminal regions which are also shared with the membrane-bound guanylyl cyclases and adenylyl cyclases(6Tang W-J.

Böhme E. Hofmann F. Schultz G. FEBS Lett. 1981; 132: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Recently, histidine 105 of the β1 subunit has been shown to be essential for the stimulation by NO since substitution by phenylalanine yielded an enzyme that was catalytically active but insensitive to NO(9Wedel B. Humbert P. Harteneck C. Foerster J. Malkewitz J. Böhme E. Schultz G. Koesling D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2592-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). nitric oxide S-nitrosoglutathione polymerase chain reaction multiplicity of infection. It is unknown whether heme binding and catalytic activity can be attributed to distinct domains of soluble guanylyl cyclase. Here, we show that the COOH-terminal halves of the α1 and β1 subunits comprising the putative catalytic domain are sufficient for cGMP formation. Moreover, deletions of the poorly conserved NH2 termini of the β1 (β1-ΔN64) and α1 subunits (α1-ΔN131) led to severe impairment of NO stimulation, thus underlining the importance of the NH2-terminal regions of both subunits for heme binding and/or transduction of the stimulatory binding signal to the catalytic domain. The NH2-terminally truncated β1 subunit specifically blocks only the stimulated activity of α1β1 wild-type enzyme while leaving the non-stimulated activity unchanged. Therefore, this mutant offers a new and potentially powerful means by which to inhibit the NO stimulated but not basal catalytic activity of the soluble form of guanylyl cyclase. NH2-terminal truncated mutants of α1 and β1 subunits were constructed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Fragments coding for shortened NH2 termini were amplified and used to substitute the respective fragments in the original cDNA clones. Primers used in the PCR had an average length of 22 bases matching the sequences used for amplification. In the sense oligonucleotides, the beginning of the coding region was preceded by the ribosomal binding site derived from the sequence of the α1 subunit, and a HindIII site was added to the 5′-end to aid subcloning of the amplified products. The positions of the antisense oligonucleotides were selected to cover an internal restriction site allowing convenient substitution in the original cDNA. PCR was carried out in 30 cycles (94°C for 60 s; 55°C for 150 s; 72°C for 150 s), using 1 μg of cDNA as template, 80 pmol of each primer, and 5 units of Taq-Polymerase (Promega) under the conditions suggested by the manufacturer. After subcloning the PCR products, the truncated mutants were constructed as follows. For construction of the β1-ΔN64 mutant, a HindIII/SphI fragment (151 base pairs) of the subcloned PCR product was used to substitute for the respective fragment in the cDNA of the β1 subunit subcloned in the HindIII/EcoRI sites of pUC BM20. The mutant was subcloned into the HindIII/SmaI sites of pCMV by cutting with EcoRI, filling the recessed 3′ termini, and subsequently cutting with HindIII. For expression in Sf9 cells, the pCMV clone was cut with EcoRI/SspI and subcloned into the EcoRI/SmaI sites of pVL1392. For construction of the β1-ΔN305 mutant, the cDNA of β1 subunit was cut with BamHI/EcoRI, and the resulting fragment coding for the COOH-terminal part of the subunit was ligated to the BamHI/EcoRI-cut PCR product subcloned in pUC BM20. For expression in Sf9 cells, the pUC BM20 clone was cut with HindIII, the recessed 3′ termini were refilled and, after a EcoRI cut, the mutant was subcloned into the SmaI/EcoRI sites of pVL1393. For construction of the α1-ΔN131 mutant, the cDNA of α1 subunit cloned into the EcoRI site of pBR322 was cut with SacI/EcoRI, and the resulting fragment coding for the COOH-terminal part of the subunit was ligated to the SacI/EcoRI-cut PCR product coding for the shortened NH2 terminus subcloned in pUC BM20. The resulting mutant was subcloned into the HindIII/SmaI sites of pCMV after cutting with EcoRI, filling of the recessed 3′ termini and a HindIII cut. For expression in Sf9 cells, the pCMV clone was cut with EcoRI and SspI and subcloned into the EcoRI/SmaI sites of pVL1392. For construction of the α1-ΔN366 mutant, the cDNA of α1 subunit cloned into the EcoRI site of pBR322 was cut with ApaI/EcoRI, and the resulting fragment coding for the COOH-terminal part of the subunit was ligated to the ApaI/EcoRI-cut PCR product coding for the shortened NH2 terminus subcloned in pUC BM20. The mutant was subcloned into the HindIII/SmaI sites of pCMV using the EcoRI and HindIII sites of the mutant cDNA clone in pUC BM20. For expression in Sf9 cells, the NH2-terminal fragment of the mutant (BglII/NcoI) was used to substitute for the respective region (BamHI/NcoI) of the wild type cDNA of α1 in pVL1393. Construction of the wild type α1 and β1 subunits, generation of recombinant viruses, and cell culture of Sf9 cells were performed as described(9Wedel B. Humbert P. Harteneck C. Foerster J. Malkewitz J. Böhme E. Schultz G. Koesling D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2592-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). To obtain cytosolic fractions containing the recombinant protein, spinner cultures of Sf9 cells grown to 1.5 × 106 cells/ml were coinfected with combinations of the respective baculoviruses as the indicated apparent multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.). Cells were collected by centrifugation 42 h after infection and resuspended in 40 μl (1 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2 μM benzamidine, 50 mM triethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 7.4) per ml of the original cell suspension. After passing the cells 10 times through a 22-gauge needle, the homogenates were centrifuged for 30 min at 30,000 × g. The resulting supernatants (50-100 μg) were assayed for cyclase activity as described previously (9Wedel B. Humbert P. Harteneck C. Foerster J. Malkewitz J. Böhme E. Schultz G. Koesling D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2592-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) in the presence of 0.1 mM GTP, 3 mM Mg2+ or Mn2+ with or without 100 μMS-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) unless stated otherwise. Endogenous cGMP formation of Sf9 cells infected with only the β1 virus (up to 10 pmol of cGMP × min-1× mg-1) was substracted as control from recombinant heterodimer activity. Data are shown for typical experiments performed in duplicate which were repeated at least once. Western blots were performed as described(10Harteneck C. Koesling D. Söling A. Schultz G. Böhme E. FEBS Lett. 1990; 272: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In order to be able to encircle functional domains of soluble guanylyl cyclase, we analyzed the homology of different regions of the subunits. As outlined above, each subunit contains a region homologous to the catalytic domain of the membrane-bound enzyme which is also conserved in the adenylyl cyclases. This COOH-terminal region is preceded by a central part of the polypeptide chains with less but still pronounced homology between guanylyl cyclase subunits. In contrast, the overall homology of the NH2-terminal parts of the subunits is low. Notable is a stretch of about 100 amino acids within this NH2-terminal region revealing a significantly higher degree of identical amino acids between α1 and α2 or β1 and β2 than between α and β subunits. In one set of deletions, we omitted the amino acids preceding this stretch (131 and 64 amino acids of the α1 and β1 subunits, respectively) to investigate the potential function of these very low conserved NH2 termini. In another set of mutations, the entire NH2-terminal half of either subunit was deleted so that the resulting truncated subunits (β1-ΔN305 and α1-ΔN366) contained the putative catalytic regions. All deletion mutants were coexpressed with their corresponding wild type subunit in Sf9 cells. In order to obtain comparable amounts of expressed proteins, the m.o.i. used for the different viruses was varied, and the expression of the recombinant proteins was monitored in cytosolic fractions of infected cells in Western blots using antibodies directed against COOH-terminal peptides of the α1 and β1 subunit. Fig. 1 shows the results of a Western blot in which the m.o.i. used for the respective heterodimers were adjusted. Accordingly, the expression of the recombinant truncated mutants and the wild type subunits was quite similar. Like the wild type α1 subunit (calculated molecular mass of 78 kDa), all deletional mutants of the α1 subunit showed a slightly faster migration on SDS gels than expected from the predicted molecular masses. Subsequently, enzyme activity of the modified heterodimers was determined under basal and NO-stimulated conditions in the presence of 3 mM Mg2+ or 3 mM Mn2+ as divalent cations (Table 1). cGMP production by the α1β1 wild type in the presence of Mg2+ was 50 pmol of cGMP × min-1× mg-1; addition of GSNO resulted in a 90-fold increase in catalytic activity. Among the modified guanylyl cyclases, only β1-ΔN64 revealed measurable basal activity (40 pmol of cGMP × min-1× mg-1) in the presence of Mg2+. Whereas basal activity was comparable to that of the wild type enzyme, GSNO did not alter enzyme activity of this mutant. In contrast, α1-ΔN131 exhibited some sensitivity to NO in the presence of Mg2+ as the enzyme showed cGMP formation (10 pmol of cGMP × min-1× mg-1) under stimulated conditions whereas basal activity was below the detection limit.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The use of Mn2+ instead of Mg2+ as divalent cation led to an increased basal activity of the wild type (400 pmol of cGMP × min-1× mg-1), with the activator causing only a 10-fold stimulation. These findings are in accordance with earlier results(11Waldman S.A. Murad F. Pharmacol. Rev. 1987; 39: 163-189PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, all modified heterodimers were catalytically active but insensitive to NO. Basal activity of β1-ΔN64 (503 pmol of cGMP × min-1× mg-1) was again in the range of the wild type enzyme, whereas cGMP formation of the other mutant enzymes was reduced to 9-22% of wild type activity (see Table 1). After establishing intact basal activity of β1-ΔN64 but insensitivity to NO, this mutant was further characterized. To compare the kinetic properties of this mutant with the wild type enzyme, cGMP formation was determined in the presence of increasing GTP concentrations. A Lineweaver-Burk plot of the data revealed similar apparent Km values of 106 and 110 μM GTP for α1β1 and α1β1-ΔN64, respectively (Fig. 2), suggesting proper folding of the catalytic domain. Since the β1-ΔN64 heterodimer is not activated by the NO-releasing compound GSNO nor by protoporphyrin IX (data not shown), we tested whether the mutant could function as a dominant-negative protein inhibiting only the stimulated wild type enzyme while leaving the basal activity unchanged. For this purpose, Sf9 cells were infected with the viruses coding for wild type subunits as well as with increasing amounts of the virus coding for the β1-ΔN64 mutant. Parallel to the determination of the catalytic activity, we performed Western blots of the different samples to ensure that the loss of stimulated activity was not due to a decrease in expression of the wild type subunits (Fig. 3B). Catalytic activity of the coexpressed subunits in cytosolic fractions was determined under basal and stimulated conditions (100 μM GSNO) in the presence of 3 mM Mn2+. As shown in Fig. 3A, increasing amounts of β1-ΔN64 virus led to a decline of the stimulated activity to 60, 37, 29, 23, and 20% of the original activity (5200 pmol of cGMP × min-1× mg-1) of the wild type enzyme, whereas basal cGMP formation remained constant over a range of 10 to 30 pmol of cGMP × min-1× mg-1. In the present study, we demonstrate that coexpression of the COOH-terminal halves of the α1 and β1 subunits of soluble guanylyl cylcase, comprising the region conserved in all cyclases, yields an enzyme sufficient for the formation of cGMP but insensitive to NO. Preliminary results indicate that COOH-terminally truncated mutants are catalytically inactive, thus further underlining the importance of the catalytic consensus domain. Our results are in good agreement with reports on an NH2-terminally truncated GC-A receptor mutant exhibiting ligand-independent cGMP production. In the deletional mutant of the GC-A receptor, the cyclase catalytic domain is preceded by the so-called hinge region (47 amino acids) and a small portion (15 amino acids) of the carboxyl segment of the consensus protein kinase-like domain. These additional amino acids were shown to be essential for a properly folded catalytically active site, and it was suggested that these sequences may be required for dimerization (12Thompson D.K. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 425-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In a recent report, the 43 amino acids in front of the catalytic domain have indeed been shown to be required for dimerization(13Wilson E.M. Chinkers M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4696-4701Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In analogy, the 80 additional amino acids NH2-terminal of the putative catalytic region present in the COOH-terminal halves of the α1 and β1 subunits may be required for proper folding or dimerization of the subunits. Dimerization of the subunits is a prerequisite for enzyme activity since expression of one subunit or a truncated mutant did not yield any cGMP forming activity. The various adenylyl cyclases also contain two cyclase homology domains which in contrast to soluble guanylyl cyclase are localized on one polypeptide chain. Similarily as in soluble guanylyl cyclase, both domains present in adenylyl cyclases are required for catalysis as the separate expression of either region results in a loss of enzyme activity(14Tang W. Krupinski J. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8595-8603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the ability of the NH2-terminally truncated GC-A receptor mutant to dimerize coincided with intact catalytic activity, further underlining the necessity of two catalytic consensus domains. The significance of the association of two different catalytic domains in soluble guanylyl cyclases and adenylyl cyclases as opposed to the existence of two identical catalytic domains in the membrane bound guanylyl cyclases, however, is unknown. Besides the identification of the catalytic domain, we show that even the very low conserved NH2-terminal part of the β1 subunit (64 amino acids) is required for the stimulation by NO. Recently, we identified histidine 105 of the β1 subunit as a likely candidate to be the residue forming a linkage to the central iron atom of the prosthetic heme group, since substitution of this histidine 105 by phenylalanine yielded an NO-insensitive enzyme lacking the prosthetic heme group(9Wedel B. Humbert P. Harteneck C. Foerster J. Malkewitz J. Böhme E. Schultz G. Koesling D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2592-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Although histidine 105 of the β1 subunit is present in the mutant β1-ΔN64, the loss of NO sensitivity suggests disturbance of either a configuration required for heme binding or lack of structures involved in the transduction of the stimulatory effect to the catalytic center. Deletion of the NH2-terminal part of the α1 subunit (131 amino acids) yielded an enzyme still activated by NO, although the non-responsiveness in the presence of Mn2+ suggests a severe impairment of NO stimulation. As further deletion of the α1 subunit also destroys NO activation of the enzyme, we conclude that the NH2-terminal regions of the α1 and β1 subunits are responsible for the regulation of the enzyme. Characterization of the purified mutants will reveal whether those are still able to bind heme or whether the mediation of the stimulatory signal is impaired. When coexpressed with the wild type enzyme, the NH2-terminally truncated β1 subunit inhibits only the stimulated activity but leaves the basal activity unchanged. The ability of the mutant to compete with the wild type β1 subunit for dimerizing with the α1 subunit further emphasizes the NH2-terminal location of the regulatory domain. The dominant-negative effect of the mutant on the stimulated activity will allow the selective inhibition of nitric oxide-dependent cGMP formation in intact cells. Hence, the mutant will be a helpful tool in forthcoming studies of the NO-cGMP signaling system and, in this regard, the retained ability of basal cGMP formation is probably beneficial when compared to the recently identified dominant-negative mutants that knock out guanylyl cyclase activity completely(16Yuen P.S.T. Doolittle L.K. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 791-793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results show that the two defining features of soluble guanylyl cyclase, namely the catalytic activity and the regulation by NO, can be attributed to different regions on the subunits and that the catalytic domain can be expressed separately. Similar results exist for the bacterial protein FixL, a dimeric hemoprotein kinase whose enzymatic activity is reversibly blocked by oxygen binding to the heme. There the heme binding domain and the phosphotransferase activity were also attributed to the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal regions, respectively; they still contained their heme-dependent oxygen-binding and catalytic properties when expressed separately(15Monson E.K. Weinstein M. Ditta G.S. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4280-4284Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that during evolution, regulatory segments have been connected to distinct catalytic domains. In the case of guanylyl cyclases, a common cGMP-forming catalytic unit occurs under the control of different regulatory domains; in that respect, the regulatory heme-containing domain of the soluble enzyme appears to represent the equivalent to the ligand-binding and kinase-like domains of the membrane bound guanylyl cyclases.

In this paper, we show that purified Rad1 and Rad10 interact with a synthetic bubble structure and incise the DNA at the 5′-side of the centrally unpaired region. When Rad1-Rad10 and purified XPG protein (the human homolog of yeast Rad2 protein) were co-incubated with the DNA substrate, we observed incisions at both ends of the bubble. This reaction mimics the dual incision step in nucleotide excision repair in vivo. In addition, the recent suggestion that Rad1 can act to resolve Holliday junctions (Habraken, Y., Sung, P., Prakash, L., and Prakash, S.(1994) Nature 371, 531-534), explaining the recombination defect observed in rad1 mutants, has been further investigated. However, using proteins purified in two different laboratories we were unable to show any interaction between Rad1 and synthetic Holliday junctions. The role that Rad1-Rad10 plays in recombination is likely to resemble its activity in NER by acting upon partially unpaired DNA intermediates such as those formed by recombination mechanisms involving single-strand DNA annealing.

The role that Rad1-Rad10 plays in recombination is likely to resemble its activity in NER by acting upon partially unpaired DNA intermediates such as those formed by recombination mechanisms involving single-strand DNA annealing. The process of nucleotide excision repair plays a major role in the removal of DNA lesions following DNA damage. In bacteria, excision repair is initiated by three proteins, UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC, which promote a dual incision reaction by cleaving the 3rd to 5th phosphodiester bond 3′ to the lesion and the 8th bond at the 5′-side of the lesion. The 12-13-nucleotide-long oligomer containing the lesion is then removed from the DNA, and the single-stranded gap is filled and sealed by DNA polymerases and DNA ligase(1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar, 2Sancar A. Sancar G.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 29-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Dual incision is also observed in eukaryotes, and higher organisms excise a fragment of 27-29 nucleotides in length(3Huang J.-C. Svoboda D.L. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3664-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The isolation of UV-sensitive mutants has helped to define the genetic complexity of nucleotide excision repair in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and it is now known that many genes are involved in the process. These include RAD1, RAD2, RAD3, RAD4, RAD7, RAD10, RAD14, RAD16, RAD23, TFB1, SSL1, and SSL2(1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis.

Remarkably, the sequences of excision repair genes in yeast and mammalian cells are highly homologous, and the enzymology of the two systems is very similar. The RAD1 and RAD10 genes of S. cerevisiae encode polypeptides that interact to form a stable complex (5Bailly V. Sommers C.H. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In particular, RAD1 and RAD10 are required for intrachromosomal recombination between direct repeats and affect the integration of linear DNA molecules and circular plasmids into genomic sequences. RAD1 is also required for double-strand break repair between two direct repeats when the double-strand break occurs within a region of heterology(12Fishman-Lobell J. Haber J.E. Science. 1992; 258: 480-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Recently it was suggested that Rad1 can resolve Holliday junctions(15Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S.

In this paper we have further investigated the specific endonuclease activity of Rad1-Rad10 using substrates that mimic intermediates thought to occur during nucleotide excision repair and recombination. We show that the purified Rad1 and Rad10 proteins cut a synthetic bubble structure at the 5′-side of the centrally unpaired region and that Rad1-Rad10 together with purified XPG protein (the human homolog of yeast Rad2 protein) catalyze a dual incision reaction. In contrast to the report by Habraken et al.(15Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nature. 1994; 371: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we did not detect any cleavage of Holliday junctions by Rad1 or Rad1-Rad10. The S. cerevisiae Rad1 and Rad10 proteins were purified to homogeneity as described(16Tomkinson A.E. Bardwell A.J. Tappe N. Ramos W. Friedberg E.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5305-5311Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Two preparations of Rad1 were utilized (prepared independently in the laboratories of E. C. F. and A. E. T.). Rad1 protein was found to be unstable and became inactivated by repeated freeze/thawing, and consequently it was always used from a freshly thawed stock. When complexed with Rad10, Rad1 was considerably more stable. Rad1 and Rad10 were therefore preincubated together on ice for 5 min before addition to the reactions. The two preparations gave very similar results. Escherichia coli RuvC protein (17Dunderdale H.J. Sharples G.J. Lloyd R.G. West S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5187-5194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and human XPG protein (18O'Donovan A. Scherly D. Clarkson S.G. Wood R.D. J. Biol.Chem. 1994; 269: 15965-15968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were purified as described elsewhere. The bubble substrate was produced by annealing two 90-mer oligonucleotides. One oligonucleotide contains a central poly(C)30 region, whereas the other contains poly(T)30 to produce a centrally unpaired poly(C)•poly(T) region of 30 nucleotides flanked by duplex DNA. The DNA sequences and method of preparation are described elsewhere(19O'Donovan A. Davies A.A. Moggs J.G. West S.C. Wood R.D. Nature. 1994; 371: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The poly(T)30-containing strand (oligo 2) was labeled with 30P at the 5′-end prior to annealing. Synthetic Holliday junction X12 was prepared as described previously(20Bennett R.J. Dunderdale H.J. West S.C. Cell. 1993; 74: 1021-1031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Reaction conditions are stated in the figure legends. 30P-Labeled DNA products were analyzed by denaturing 12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using TBE buffer. The gels were dried onto filter paper, exposed to Kodak XAR5 film, and visualized by autoradiography. A key event in NER in eukaryotic cells is the introduction of dual incisions flanking a damaged site in DNA, leading to the excision of a DNA fragment about 30 nucleotides long(3Huang J.-C. Svoboda D.L. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3664-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). To investigate the incision step in more detail, we prepared a synthetic bubble structure, which contains a 30-nucleotide-long unpaired region flanked by duplex regions of similar length (Fig. 1). This model substrate is likely to resemble an intermediate in NER, after repair proteins have unwound and separated the DNA strands around the damaged region(19O'Donovan A. Davies A.A. Moggs J.G. West S.C. Wood R.D. Nature. 1994; 371: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). When purified S. cerevisiae Rad1 and Rad10 proteins were incubated with a synthetic bubble structure in which one strand was 5′-30P-end labeled, we observed cleavage of the labeled strand at the 5′-side of the unpaired region, ~2 bases into the adjacent duplex DNA (Fig. 1, lanes b and c). No products were observed that corresponded to cleavage within the unpaired region or on the 3′-side. The polarity of cleavage is therefore the same as that observed previously with model DNA structures with single-stranded DNA tails with 3′-ends(8Bardwell A.J. Bardwell L. Tomkinson A.E. Friedberg E.C. Science. 1994; 265: 2082-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). However, the results presented here provide evidence that a free single-stranded DNA end is not required for structure-specific cleavage by Rad1-Rad10, indicating that the duplex δ-single-strand junction is directly recognized by the endonuclease. Cleavage of the bubble structure required both proteins (Fig. 2, lane d), since neither Rad1 (lane b) nor Rad10 (lane c) alone had any effect on the bubble substrate.Figure 2Both Rad1 and Rad10 are required for incision of the bubble structure. The bubble substrate (0.5 ng; 30P-labeled at the 5′-end of oligo 2) was incubated alone (lane a) with 62 ng of Rad1 (lane b), 12 ng of Rad10 (lane c), 62 ng of Rad1, and 12 ng of Rad10 (lane d) or 50 ng of RuvC (lane e). Incubation was for 60 min at 30°C (37°C for RuvC) in a 20-μl reaction mix containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 50 μg/ml BSA. Electrophoretic analysis was as described in the legend to Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In human cells, the XPG endonuclease makes the 3′-incision during nucleotide excision repair(19O'Donovan A. Davies A.A. Moggs J.G. West S.C. Wood R.D. Nature. 1994; 371: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). When XPG was compared with Rad1-Rad10, we observed that the bubble substrate was nicked with a polarity opposite to that seen in reactions with the Rad1-Rad10 complex (Fig. 1, lanes e and f). When the bubble substrate was incubated with both XPG and the Rad1-Rad10 protein complex (Fig. 1, lane d), incision products were observed that corresponded to cleavage at the 3′- and 5′-sides of the bubble. The S. cerevisiae homologue of the human XPG protein is Rad2 (21Scherly D. Nouspikel T. Corlet J. Ucla C. Bairoch A. Clarkson S.G. Nature. 1993; 363: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, a truncated form of Rad2 has been shown to cleave model DNA structures with the same polarity as XPG(22Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1344-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The dual incision reaction of NER in yeast is therefore likely to involve Rad2 and the Rad1-Rad10 complex, with the corresponding functions performed in humans by XPG and the ERCC1-ERCC4 protein complex (where ERCC1 is the homologue of Rad10 (23van Duin M. de Wit J. Odjik H. Westerveld A. Yasui A. Koken M.H.M. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Bootsma D. Cell. 1986; 44: 913-923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) and ERCC4 is the homologue of Rad1 2L. Thompson, personal communication. ). Although the exact mechanics of damage recognition, DNA unwinding, and incision remain to be elucidated, the results presented here strengthen the view that a partially unwound or open complex around a DNA lesion is an intermediate in the NER process. Genetic evidence indicates that, in addition to their role in NER, the Rad1 and Rad10 proteins are involved in a pathway of mitotic recombination(1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar, 4Prakash S. Sung P. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 33-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), possibly by playing a role in the resolution of recombination intermediates (such as Holliday junctions). Recent studies reported that the Rad1 protein (1-5 μg/ml) could resolve synthetic Holliday junctions by endonucleolytic cleavage(15Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nature. 1994; 371: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Since the structure of a Holliday intermediate is quite different from intermediates that occur during NER, we compared the activities of Rad1 and Rad1-Rad10 with RuvC protein, the E. coli Holliday junction resolvase(24Dunderdale H.J. Benson F.E. Parsons C.A. Sharples G.J. Lloyd R.G. West S.C. Nature. 1991; 354: 506-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 25Iwasaki H. Takahagi M. Shiba T. Nakata A. Shinagawa H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4381-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Fig. 2(lane d) shows that Rad1-Rad10 cut the bubble structure efficiently whereas RuvC protein was inactive on this substrate (lane e). We also compared the activities of Rad1-Rad10 and RuvC on a synthetic Holliday junction X12(20Bennett R.J. Dunderdale H.J. West S.C. Cell. 1993; 74: 1021-1031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Resolution by RuvC is known to occur by the introduction of symmetrically related nicks at the site of the crossover(20Bennett R.J. Dunderdale H.J. West S.C. Cell. 1993; 74: 1021-1031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). When the junction was 5′-30P-labeled in strand 2, we observed the nick in this strand by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3, lane h). However, using preparations of Rad1 produced in two different laboratories, we were unable to detect any evidence of nicking when the junction was incubated with 1.2-12.5 μg/ml purified Rad1 protein (Fig. 3, lanes b-e, and data not shown). Incubation of the junction with the Rad1-Rad10 complex also failed to yield cleavage products (Fig. 3, lane g). Experiments carried out with a different junction (X0(20Bennett R.J. Dunderdale H.J. West S.C. Cell. 1993; 74: 1021-1031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar)) also provided negative results (data not shown). Furthermore, we could find no evidence that Rad1 or Rad10 could bind to the synthetic Holliday junctions, either individually or as a complex, as measured by bandshift assays (data not shown). Taken together, these results show that under conditions in which the Rad1-Rad10 complex is highly active and cleaves 85% of the bubble structure (Fig. 3, lane i), it fails to nick the synthetic Holliday junction in a manner expected of a junction-specific resolvase. Though we cannot account for the ability of others to demonstrate Holliday junction resolution by Rad1(15Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nature. 1994; 371: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), it is known that synthetic Holliday junctions tend to “breathe” during incubation and may be prone to attack by contaminating single-strand endonucleases (26West S.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 27-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). If Holliday junctions do not serve as targets for Rad1-Rad10, what role do these proteins play in recombination? Studies of budding yeast indicate that there are two pathways of double-strand break-induced recombination(27Fishman-Lobell J. Rudin N. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1292-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). One of these pathways (single-strand annealing or SSA) is utilized during recombination between repeat sequences (Fig. 4B), and deletions between repeats are greatly reduced in the absence of either the RAD1 or RAD10 gene products(9Schiestl R.H. Prakash S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3619-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 13Zehfus B.R. McWilliams A.D. Lin Y.-H. Hoekstra M.F. Keil R.L.

Thalerscheer M.S. Jones M.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2823-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, the SSA pathway for recombination is unlikely to proceed via a Holliday junction intermediate. An important clue to the role of Rad1 in recombination was provided by Fishman-Lobell et al.(12Fishman-Lobell J. Haber J.E. Science. 1992; 258: 480-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), who observed that rad1 mutants were defective in recombination between two direct repeat sequences when one of the repeats contained a heterologous region in which recombination was initiated by a double-strand break. It was suggested that RAD1 was required for an endonucleolytic activity that acts in the removal of non-homologous 3′-single-stranded ends at an early stage of recombination(12Fishman-Lobell J. Haber J.E. Science. 1992; 258: 480-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). An identical defect in double-strand break-induced recombination is also present in rad10 mutants but not in mutants of other NER genes(29Ivanov E.L. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2245-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). An absence of Rad1 or Rad10 would thus block SSA between direct repeats. Duplex/3′-single-strand DNA junctions that model those thought to be present during the SSA pathway (12Fishman-Lobell J. Haber J.E. Science. 1992; 258: 480-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) are known to be acted upon by the Rad1-Rad10 nuclease ((8Bardwell A.J. Bardwell L. Tomkinson A.E. Friedberg E.C. Science. 1994; 265: 2082-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and this work). The in vitro properties of Rad1-Rad10, indicative of a structure-specific nuclease, can therefore simultaneously account for a role in the cleavage of some recombination intermediates (Fig. 4B), although not Holliday junctions, as well as the specific cleavage of DNA nucleotide excision repair intermediates (Fig. 4A).

We investigated the amino-terminal portion of the third intracellular loop of the human α2AAR (α2C10) for potential Gs coupling domains using site-directed mutagenesis and recombinant expression in several different cell types. A deletion mutant and four chimeric receptors consisting of the α2AAR with the analogous sequence from the 5-HT1A receptor (a Gi-coupled receptor) and the β2AR (a Gs-coupled receptor) were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, Chinese hamster fibroblasts, or COS-7 cells and examined for their ability to mediate stimulation or inhibition of membrane adenylyl cyclase activity or whole cell cAMP accumulation.In stably expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells, deletion of amino acids 221-231, which are in close proximity to the fifth transmembrane domain, eliminated α2C10-mediated stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity, while α2C10-mediated inhibition was only moderately affected. This suggested that this region is important for Gs coupling, prompting construction of the chimeric receptor mutants. Substitution of amino acids 218-235 with 5-HT1A receptor sequence entirely ablated agonist-promoted Gs coupling, as compared with a 338 ± 29% stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity observed with the wild-type α2C10. In contrast, Gi coupling for this mutant remained fully intact (57 ± 2% versus 52 ± 1% inhibition for wild-type α2C10). Similar substitution with β2AR sequence had no effect on Gi coupling but did reduce Gs coupling. Two additional mutated α2C10 containing smaller substitutions of the amino-terminal region with 5-HT1A receptor sequence at residues 218-228 or 229-235 were then studied. While Gi coupling remained intact with both mutants, Gs coupling was ablated in the former but not the latter mutant receptor. Similar results were obtained using transfected Chinese hamster fibroblasts (which exclusively display α2AR-Gi coupling) and COS-7 cells (which exclusively display α2AR-Gs coupling). Thus, a critical determinant for Gs coupling is contained within 11 amino acids(218-228) of the amino-terminal region of the third intracellular loop localized directly adjacent to the fifth transmembrane domain.Taken together, these studies demonstrate the presence of a discrete structural determinant for agonist-promoted α2AR-Gs coupling, which is distinct and separable from the structural requirements for α2AR-Gi coupling. α2-Adrenergic receptors (α2AR) functionally couple not only to Gi but also to Gs.

The membrane-permeable cGMP analogue, 8-bromo-cGMP, did not significantly affect c-fos and zif/268 mRNA levels, and the highly selective inhibitor of cGMP-dependent protein kinase, KT5823, was unable to inhibit the elevation in c-fos and zif/268 mRNA levels induced by SNAP. The induction of c-fos by the calcium ionophore A23187 was reduced by treatment with SNAP or 8-bromo-cGMP. Inhibitors of ADP-ribosyltransferases attenuated the stimulation of c-fos expression by SNAP. These results demonstrate for the first time that NO can induce immediate early gene expression in neurons, suggesting that NO may act as a mediator of neuronal plasticity via alterations in the expression of downstream genes.

INTRODUCTIONIt has previously been demonstrated that the O-demethylation of the volatile anesthetic methoxyflurane (CHCl2CF2OCH3) by the major phenobarbital-inducible hepatic cytochrome P-450 2B4 of rabbit is markedly stimulated in the presence of cytochrome b5 (Canova-Davis et al., 1985; Canova-Davis and Waskell, 1984). Cytochrome b5 is believed to function in this reaction by providing the second of the two electrons required for substrate oxidation by cytochrome P-450. The first electron is donated by cytochrome P-450 reductase. An intriguing long standing question has been why is the metabolism of methoxyflurane and a minority of other substrates, such as nifedipine, p-nitroanisole, prostaglandin, lauric acid, n-methylcarbazole, chlorobenzene, p-nitrophenetole, 7-ethoxycoumarin, benzo(a)pyrene, and lidocaine, and testosterone β-hydroxylation so stimulated by the presence of cytochrome b5 while the metabolism of most other substrates, including benzphetamine, is minimally stimulated, not effected, or slightly inhibited in the presence of cytochrome b5 (Aoyama et al., 1990; Canova-Davis and Waskell, 1984; Hoffman et al., 1989; Okita et al., 1981; Peyronneau et al., 1992; Vatsis et al., 1982).The answer to this question depends on understanding the individual steps of the catalytic reaction cycle of cytochrome P-450: 1) binding of substrate; 2) one electron reduction of the ferric substrate-enzyme complex by cytochrome P-450 reductase; 3) the binding of oxygen to the ferrous enzyme. In uncoupled reactions oxygen can dissociate from the oxyferrous enzyme to regenerate the ferric cytochrome and superoxide anion which in turn can dismutate to hydrogen peroxide according to : HO2.+O2.―+H+→O2+H2O2(Eq. 1) 4) transfer of a second electron from either cytochrome P-450 reductase or cytochrome b5; 5) protonation of the distal oxygen atom by a single hydrogen ion. In uncoupled reactions two protons can be provided at this step to directly generate hydrogen peroxide and the ferric enzyme. This is the oxidase activity of cytochrome P-450 and consumes 1 equivalent of oxygen and NADPH; O2+NADPH+H+→H2O2+NADP+(Eq. 2) 6) cleavage of the oxygen-oxygen bond with formation of a high valency iron-oxo intermediate [Fe=O]3+ and water. In uncoupled reaction cycles it is presumed that this iron-oxo intermediate can undergo further two-electron reduction by consuming a second molecule of NADPH to generate a second, “extra” molecule of water to distinguish it from the water which is produced in an equal amount to product in the monooxidation reaction (Equation 3); 7) insertion of the second oxygen atom now an “activated oxygen” into a carbon-hydrogen bond of the substrate; and 8) dissociation of the product to regenerate the ferric enzyme (White, 1991; White and Coon, 1980).The stoichiometry of eukaryotic microsomal cytochrome P-450-catalyzed reactions has been studied extensively both in microsomes and in the reconstituted system (Gorsky and Coon, 1986; Gorsky et al., 1984; Nordblom and Coon, 1977; Zhukov and Archakov, 1982). If the cytochrome P-450-catalyzed reactions were perfectly coupled, they would occur as shown in Equation 3, where RH represents substrate and ROH the oxidized product.RH+O2+NADPH+H+→ROH+H2O+NADP+(Eq. 3) However, the eukaryotic microsomal cytochrome P-450 reaction cycle usually becomes uncoupled at one or more of the three theoretically possible steps to produce the one-, two-, and four-electron-reduced species of oxygen, i.e. superoxide (Ingelman-Sundberg and Johansson, 1980; Kuthan et al., 1978), hydrogen peroxide (Heinemeyer et al., 1980; Oprian et al., 1983), and water (Gorsky et al., 1984; Morgan et al., 1982; Zhukov and Archakov, 1982), respectively. In in vitro reactions, hydrogen peroxide arises in two ways: by dismutation of the superoxide anion (Equation 1) and by dissociation of hydrogen peroxide from a two-electron-reduced cytochrome P-450.The stoichiometry of the oxidation of camphor by cytochrome P-450 camphor is completely coupled. However, the reaction is highly uncoupled when either the wild type enzyme oxidizes substrates other than camphor or selected mutant cytochromes P-450 oxidize camphor (Gerber and Sligar, 1992, 1994; Imai et al., 1989; Loida and Sligar, 1993; Martinis et al., 1989; Poulos and Howard, 1987; Raag et al., 1993; Raag and Poulos, 1989). In contrast to the eukaryotic cytochromes P-450, autooxidation of wild type cytochrome P-450 camphor to superoxide is much slower (0.004 s−1 at 11°C) than the introduction of the second electron (≌5 s−1) and steady-state cycling of the system. However, in contrast to the microsomal enzymes, hydrogen peroxide is produced in uncoupled cytochrome P-450 camphor reactions by the autooxidation of the two-electron-reduced oxy-cytochrome P-450 camphor complex. Either water in the active site or a protonated active site amino acid is assumed to provide the necessary hydrogen ions which allow the two-electron-reduced oxygen to dissociate as hydrogen peroxide and regenerate the ferric protein (Gerber and Sligar, 1994; Swinney and Mak, 1994). Since hydrogen peroxide is produced only in the absence of strict complementarity between the substrate and the proteinaceous substrate binding site, steric factors near the two-electron-reduced heme-oxygen complex are presumably altered in such a way to facilitate protonation and dissociation of the reduced oxygen rather than protonation with cleavage of the oxygen bond to yield water and the reactive oxidizing species [Fe=O]3+ (Atkins and Sligar, 1987; Martinis et al., 1989). In addition to providing protons, water in the substrate-binding site would increase the polarity of the pocket and favor separation of the hydrogen peroxide from the heme (Loida and Sligar, 1993). Whether the iron-oxo species oxidizes the substrate or undergoes further reduction to water depends on the proximity and orientation of the substrate to the iron-oxo species, the heat of formation of the radical formed by abstracting a hydrogen, and proton availability.The stoichiometry experiments described in this article were undertaken with substrates and a pseudosubstrate, enflurane, in an effort to delineate the precise effect of cytochrome b5 in cytochrome P-450-catalyzed reactions. Previous work has indicated that the activity and relative stoichiometry observed in a reconstituted system is influenced by such variables as the protein-to-lipid ratio (Bösterling et al., 1982), the length of preincubation (Causey et al., 1990), and the order of addition of the reactants (Gorsky and Coon, 1986). For this reason the reactions were conducted under a variety of conditions to assure ourselves of the generality of observed differences. In this study we report that cytochrome b5 consistently decreases superoxide production during the metabolism of the two substrates methoxyflurane and benzphetamine, and under “Discussion” we speculate about the possible molecular basis for this effect.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsSodium phenobarbital, 30% hydrogen peroxide, chelating resin (sodium form, C 7901), superoxide dismutase (type I), NADPH, cytochrome c (horse heart, type VI), catalase (from bovine liver, with 0.1% thymol), deferoxamine mesylate, and N,N-dimethylaniline were purchased from Sigma. Isocitrate dehydrogenase from Escherichia coli which had been purified as described previously (Hurley et al., 1989) was a gift of Dr. Koshland, University of California, Berkeley, and the enzyme from pig heart was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim (grade II). Benzphetamine hydrochloride was a gift from Upjohn Co.; methoxyflurane containing 0.01% (w/w) butylated hydroxytoluene was from Abbott Laboratories; enflurane was from Ohio Medical Products. The synthetic lipid dilauroyl L-3-phosphatidyl choline (DLPC), 1The abbreviations used are: DLPCdilauroyl L-3-phosphatidyl cholineGCgas chromatographyMSmass spectrometry. was from Serdary Research Labs or Calbiochem-Behring; dichloroacetic acid (Gold label 99+%) and chlorodifluoroacetic acid (98%) were obtained from Aldrich. 2,2-[2-13C]Dichloroacetic acid was obtained from MSD Isotopes (99.7 atom%13C) and contained 3% monochloroacetic acid. [2H4]Methanol (99%2H) was obtained from Stohler Isotope Chemicals. Other chemicals used were reagent grade. Solutions of DLPC in water (1.0 mg/ml) were sonicated in a bath sonicator until clear (about 15 min).Purification of Microsomal EnzymesOur studies with rabbits were approved by our institution's Animal Welfare Committee. Liver microsomes were prepared from phenobarbital-treated white New Zealand male rabbits as described by Haugen and Coon(1976). Cytochrome P-450 2B4 was purified from rabbit liver microsomes as described previously (Canova-Davis and Waskell, 1984). The concentration of cytochrome P-450 was determined by the method of Omura and Sato(1964) using an extinction coefficient of 91 mM−1 cm−1. The specific content of the purified cytochrome P-450 was 12-13 nmol/mg of protein. Cytochrome b5 was purified from detergent-solubilized rabbit liver microsomes using the method of Chiang(1981) and had a specific content of 29-50 nmol/mg of protein. The concentration of the purified cytochrome b5 was determined from the absolute spectrum of the Fe(III) protein using an absorption coefficient of 117 mM−1 cm−1 at 413 nm (Strittmatter and Velick, 1956). NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase was purified according to the method of Yasukochi and Masters(1976) from rabbit liver microsomes prepared by the calcium precipitation method of Cinti et al.(1972). The preparations used varied widely in their specific activity, catalyzing the reduction of from 15 to 57 μmol of cytochrome c/min/mg of protein in 0.3 M potassium phosphate buffer at 30°C (French and Coon, 1979). The concentration of the reductase preparations was calculated from their activity in the cytochrome c assay with the assumption that pure reductase reduces 55 μmol of cytochrome c/min/mg of the protein under the above assay conditions.Analytical MethodsDetermination of the Superoxide Radical AnionSuperoxide was measured spectrophotometrically by observing its ability to reduce succinoylated ferric cytochrome c prepared by the method described by Kuthan et al.(1982). The procedure yields a mixture of partially succinoylated cytochrome c molecules with residual ability to be completely reduced by the reductase in a biphasic manner with rate constants typically of 0.65 min−1 and 0.18 min−1. Native cytochrome c on the other hand is reduced by reductase 1000-fold faster. None of our succinoylated cytochrome c preparations contained any cytochrome c that could be reduced at the same rate as unmodified cytochrome c. It was therefore concluded that 100% of the cytochrome c had been at least partially succinoylated and its reaction with the reductase markedly inhibited. The reduction of cytochrome c was measured at 550 nm using an extinction coefficient of 21 mM−1 cm−1. Besides reacting with succinoylated cytochrome c the superoxide produced in the reconstituted system may also spontaneously dismutate or undergo side reactions with the components of the reconstituted system. Therefore, the experimentally determined rate of reduction of succinoylated cytochrome c will always be less than the actual amount of superoxide produced. In order to determine the actual amount of superoxide produced, was derived as described under “Appendix.” This equation relates the experimentally determined rate of superoxide production to the actual rate of superoxide production while accounting for the side reactions of superoxide. Equation 23, however, has three unknowns: 1) Vmax, the actual rate of superoxide production; 2) F, the ratio of a constant for the reaction between superoxide and the reaction components to the rate constant for the reaction of superoxide with succinoylated cytochrome c (see Equations 5, 11, and 18); and 3) K, the ratio of a constant which reflects the rate of dismutation to the square of the rate constant for the reaction of superoxide with succinoylated cytochrome c(see, Equations 5, 8 and 17).The three unknowns, Vmax, K, and F, were obtained following acquisition of experimental data which was curve fit as follows. The rate of reduction of succinoylated cytochrome c produced under a particular set of conditions in the reconstituted system was measured at four different cytochrome c concentrations. This procedure was performed for each set of experimental conditions used. The concentration of cytochrome c, typically 14-72 μM, was high enough to keep the cytochrome c concentration constant throughout the reaction, but not so high as to undergo significant reactions with cytochrome b5 and cytochrome P-450 reductase. The reaction was usually measured for 30 s at a cytochrome P-450 concentration of 0.2 μM when superoxide was produced at a rate of approximately 40 nmol/nmol of cytochrome P-450/min or less. Insufficient hydrogen peroxide is formed under these conditions to reoxidize succinoylated cytochrome c. Depending on the reaction conditions, 4.5-70% of the rate of reduction of succinoylated cytochrome c could not be inhibited by addition of superoxide dismutase to the reconstituted system and was therefore assumed to be the result of the direct reduction by cytochrome b5 and cytochrome P-450 reductase. The experimentally determined rate of succinoylated cytochrome c reduction as a function of four different cytochrome c concentrations served as the experimental data which were fit to (using the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm of Sigma Plot), allowing the parameters K, Vmax, and F to vary until the best fit of data and theoretical curve was found. At this point the three unknown parameters were assumed to be the actual values, i.e. Vmax was considered to be the true rate of superoxide generation in the reconstituted system. The Vmax calculated with each batch of succinoylated cytochrome c with superoxide generated in the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system (McCord and Fridovich, 1968) was slightly less (10-30%) than the experimentally determined Vmax using unmodified cytochrome c. Therefore, in order to obtain the true amount of superoxide produced, the results obtained with each batch of succinoylated cytochrome c were normalized to the results obtained with native cytochrome c. Side reactions of superoxide with the reaction components were minimized by using only those reagents and protein preparations which did not react with superoxide, i.e. depress the reduction of succinoylated cytochrome c by superoxide generated in the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system. Addition of 1 μM Fe3+ to the reaction mixture did not affect the amount of superoxide measured whereas concentrations of Fe3+ greater than 1 μM decreased the amount of superoxide measured.Measurement of Methoxydifluoroacetic and Dichloroacetic AcidsThe products of methoxyflurane metabolism, methoxydifluoroacetic and dichloroacetic acids, were measured by a gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric assay developed in this laboratory for these experiments.Sodium methoxydifluoroacetate was synthesized using a procedure adapted from a published report (Selinsky et al., 1988a). Sodium (2.2 g, 96 nmol) was dissolved in 20.0 ml of methanol to generate sodium methoxide. Next, 3.82 ml (5.2 g, 40 nmol) of chlorodifluoroacetic acid were added. The mixture was heated at 75°C for 30 h, and then the solvent was evaporated to give a semisolid mass of the crude product, sodium methoxydifluoroacetate. Excess 6 N sulfuric acid was added to generate the free acid, and the resulting mixture was extracted twice with 20-ml portions of ether. The ether extracts containing the methoxydifluoroacetic acid were titrated with saturated sodium bicarbonate until the evolution of CO2 ceased, in order to regenerate the sodium salt. The aqueous phase was removed and subsequently evaporated. The remaining white solid was dissolved in hot methanol and filtered, and the methanol was evaporated to give 2.7 g (46%) of crude sodium methoxydifluoroacetate. After three recrystallizations from methanol, a pure sample giving the correct carbon and hydrogen analysis for C3H3O2F2Na was obtained. This product was characterized by NMR (Selinsky et al., 1988a) and Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy. The purity of the sodium methoxydifluoroacetate was confirmed by gas chromatography of an acidified ether extract. Peaks greater than 1% of the methoxydifluoroacetic acid peak were not observed by gas chromatography after methylation of the methoxydifluoroacetate in the ether extract with diazomethane. A similar procedure was used to prepare the potassium salt of [2H3]methoxydifluoroacetic acid using perdeuterated methanol.The reaction mixture supernatants were analyzed for methoxydifluoroacetic and dichloroacetic acids as follows. A known amount of the internal standard, 1.0 μg of [2H3]methoxydifluoroacetic acid and 0.4 μg of 2,2-[2-13C]dichloroacetic acid in 5 μl of water, was added to a 100-200-μl aliquot of the reaction mixture. The anesthetic was removed by placing the reaction mixture aliquot in a vacuum oven at room temperature and under 10 mm Hg pressure for 15 min. Ether-soluble impurities and traces of the anesthetic were removed by extracting the aqueous solution once with 1.0 ml of ether. Sulfuric acid (100 μl, 3.0 M) was added to the aqueous phase to convert the organic acid salts to the free acids which were then extracted with a second 1.0-ml portion of ether. The ether extracts were carefully evaporated just to dryness, and methyl esters were formed by adding 2 drops of ethereal diazomethane.Selected ion monitoring gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was carried out using a Hewlett-Packard 5890 gas chromatograph coupled to a model 5971 mass spectrometer with an open split interface. A 10 m × 0.53-mm GS-Q column (J& Scientific) was used with a carrier gas (helium) flow of 5 ml/min. The column was temperature-programmed starting at 95°C with an increase of 35°C/min to 150°C. The temperature was then increased 9°C/min to 173°C and then at 2°C/min to a final temperature of 178°C. The injector temperature was held at 200°C, and the detector temperature was 280°C. Retention times were 3.5 min for methoxydifluoroacetic acid methyl ester and 5.7 min for the methyl ester of dichloroacetic acid. The methoxydifluoroacetic acid methyl ester peak did not overlap with the dichloroacetic acid methyl ester peak. The base peaks (CH3-O-CF2+) were monitored at m/z 81.1 and 84.1 for the methyl esters of methoxydifluoroacetic acid and [2H3]methoxydifluoroacetic acid, respectively. The fragment ion CHCl2+ at m/z 83.1 and 84.1 was monitored for dichloroacetic acid methyl ester and its internal standard.Determination of Benzphetamine and Dimethylaniline Metabolism; Analytical Method for FormaldehydeThe N-demethylation of N,N-dimethylaniline and benzphetamine was determined by measuring the production of formaldehyde by the Nash(1953) procedure.Assay of Hydrogen PeroxideHydrogen peroxide was determined by the ferrithiocyanate method (Ovenston and Parker, 1949). Standard curves were generated with known amounts of H2O2 added to the appropriate control mixtures. The loss of H2O2 was insignificant after incubation of reaction mixtures with H2O2 under the standard experimental conditions and in the presence of up to 100 μM Fe3+. When NADPH was present, the amount of hydrogen peroxide present at the end of the incubation period was equivalent to the sum of the amount added plus the amount expected to be produced under the reaction conditions.NADPH Consumption (Spectrophotometrically and by α-Ketoglutarate Production)NADPH consumption was followed in two ways, depending on the reaction being studied: 1) spectrophotometrically at 340 nm using an extinction coefficient of 6.22 mM−1 cm−1 and 2) by determination of the amount of α-ketoglutarate formed in the presence of an isocitrate dehydrogenase regenerating system. α-Ketoglutarate was analyzed spectrophotometrically as the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone (Friedmann, 1957). Since the assay is slightly nonlinear, calibration standards must closely bracket the unknown α-ketoglutarate concentration. A 200-μl aliquot of the reaction mixture was added to 20 μl of 70% trichloroacetic acid, followed by 100 μl of a 20 mg/100 ml (1.0 mM) solution of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine in 1.0 N HCl (Sigma color reagent). After 20 min at room temperature, 500 μl of 10% aqueous sodium hydroxide were added. This was allowed to stand at room temperature for an additional 10 min and was then centrifuged before determining the absorption at 440 nm.Oxygen ConsumptionOxygen was measured with a Clark-type electrode (Yellow Springs Instrument Co.), using the Instech model 102 B with a 600-μl chamber.Measurement of Fluoride Ion LevelsFluoride ion concentration was determined using an Orion fluoride ion-specific electrode.Determination of Non-heme IronLevels of non-heme iron were measured spectrophotometrically using ferrozine (Carter, 1971). Trace amounts of ferric ion were removed from all solutions including the phosphate buffers by treatment with chelating resin. When necessary, adventitious iron was reduced in protein preparations to less than 2 μM by addition of 1 mM deferoxamine and subsequent extensive dialysis to remove the chelated iron so that the final non-heme iron concentration in the reaction mixture was less than 1 μM.Assay of Protein ConcentrationProtein concentration was measured according to Lowry et al.(1951) after precipitation of the proteins in the presence of trichloroacetic acid and deoxycholate (Peterson, 1977). Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard.General Procedures for Determining Reaction StoichiometryFor each set of reaction conditions a concentrated mixture containing cytochrome P-450, reductase, cytochrome b5 when present, and DLPC was prepared and preincubated at room temperature for the indicated time. The order of addition of the components to this preincubation mixture was critical and varied in many of the experiments. Hence in subsequent sections the order of addition of the proteins and lipid is indicated by the order in which they are described. Typically it is 1) cytochrome P-450, 2) reductase, 3) cytochrome b5, and 4) DLPC. At the end of the preincubation period potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, water, and substrate were added. Methoxyflurane and enflurane were added as the pure liquid (final concentration 1.0 mg/ml) and benzphetamine and dimethylaniline as 10 mM aqueous solutions (final concentration, 1.0 mM). Final concentrations of potassium phosphate buffer and of DLPC were 50 mM and 30 μg/ml (47 μM), respectively. If a NADPH-generating system was used, the components were added to their final concentrations of 1.2 mMDL-isocitrate, 10 mM magnesium chloride, and 0.5 unit/ml pig heart isocitrate dehydrogenase or 0.1 unit/ml E. coli enzyme. All reactions were run at 30°C. After thermal equilibration, reactions were initiated by the addition of NADPH except in experiments with pig heart isocitrate dehydrogenase. With the pig heart isocitrate dehydrogenase system, the complete regenerating system was added to the thermally equilibrated reaction mixture outside of the oxygen chamber. This reaction mixture was quickly added to the oxygen chamber, and the oxygen consumption was immediately recorded. The oxygen concentration at zero time was determined by extrapolation of the latter portion of the curve back to zero time. Samples were taken for NADPH, hydrogen peroxide, and product analysis at this time and at the end of the reaction period. NADPH was added to a final concentration of 0.3 mM in all experiments. Negative control reactions were performed in the absence of cytochrome P-450 or in the absence of NADPH.When analysis of hydrogen peroxide, α-ketoglutarate, or formaldehyde was required, aliquots of the reaction mixture were added to trichloroacetic acid (final concentration, 2-7%). Generally, aliquots of 100 μl were taken for hydrogen peroxide analysis, and aliquots of 200 μl were taken for α-ketoglutarate or formaldehyde analysis. When analysis of fluoride ion or the haloacids (methoxydifluoroacetic and dichloroacetic acids) was required, the reaction was stopped by heating aliquots, to which an internal standard had been added, in a 95°C water bath for 2 min. The precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 5 min), and the supernatant was assayed for haloacid metabolites of methoxyflurane, as described previously.Individual Reaction ConditionsInitial Rate ConditionsIn these experiments, the final protein concentrations were 0.15 μM P-450, 0.075 μM reductase, and 0.15 μM cytochrome b5 (when present). Reactions were initiated with the addition of NADPH and after 5-min aliquots were removed for analysis of hydrogen peroxide and product formation. Oxygen consumption was measured in a separate but parallel reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was added to the 600-μl oxygen chamber, and the recording of the oxygen concentration was allowed to stabilize. The reaction was started by the addition of a 6-μl aliquot of NADPH directly to the chamber. Two types of initial rate experiments were performed which differed in the concentration of the cytochrome b5 stock solution and in the method of preincubation: 1) initial rate with cytochrome b5 from a dilute (0.16 μM) solution (P-450 + reductase + DLPC + cytochrome b5). Cytochrome P-450 and reductase were mixed with DLPC and preincubated for 5 min. Potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing substrate or the buffer containing 0.16 μM cytochrome b5 and substrate was then added. 2) Initial rate with cytochrome b5 from a concentrated (3.4 μM) solution (P-450 + reductase + cytochrome b5+ DLPC = “normal addition sequence”). The 3.4 μM solution of cytochrome b5 was added to the mixture of cytochrome P-450 and reductase prior to the addition of phospholipid, and the preparations were preincubated for 2 h before use.Reactions with Inverse Addition of Cytochrome b5Two types of experiments were done which differed only in the sequence of addition of proteins and the time of preincubation: 1) regenerating system (pig heart) with normal addition sequence (P-450 + reductase + cytochrome b5 from a concentrated solution + DLPC) were added in the order indicated and the mixture was preincubated for 15 min and 2) regenerating system (pig heart) with inverse addition sequence (P-450 + cytochrome b5 from a concentrated solution + reductase + DLPC). Protein solutions were added in the order indicated and the mixture was preincubated for 5 min.After the p"

Functional presynaptic expression of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh)1 in cholinergic neurons requires the activity of particular proteins: (i) a high affinity choline transporter on the plasma membrane, which controls the supply of extracellular choline; (ii) a vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), which translocates cytoplasmic ACh to the interior of synaptic vesicles; and (iii) choline acetyltransferase (ChAT; acetyl-CoA:choline O-acetyltransferase, EC 2.3.1.6), which synthesizes ACh from choline and acetyl coenzyme A. cDNAs encoding ChAT have been cloned and this led to the subsequent isolation and characterization of the ChAT gene (for review see (1Wu D.

There are two classes of VAChT mRNAs in the rat, encoding the same VAChT protein, that we designate as R- and V-types. First, the R-type VAChT mRNAs contain common 5′-noncoding sequences (exon R) with two ChAT mRNAs and may therefore be transcribed from the same promoter ((4Bejanin S. Cervini R. Mallet J. Berrard S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21944-21947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Fig. 1). In nematodes, this seems to be the only mechanism for generating VAChT mRNAs(7Alfonso A. Grundhal K. McManus J.R. Asbury J.M. Rand J.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Second, V-type mRNA species differs from the R-type mRNAs by the 5′-noncoding sequences ((4Bejanin S. Cervini R. Mallet J. Berrard S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21944-21947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and (5Erickson J.D. Varoqui H. Schäfer M.K. Modi W. Diebler M.-F. Weihe E. Rand J. Eiden L.E. Bonner T.I. Usdin T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21929-21932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Fig. 1). However, the molecular mechanisms by which the V-type mRNA species is produced has not been clearly elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that the first intron of the ChAT gene contains specific VAChT promoter regions. These regions give rise to two V-type VAChT mRNAs of 2.6 and 3 kb, previously detected by Northern blotting(4Bejanin S. Cervini R. Mallet J. Berrard S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21944-21947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We report a detailed analysis of the 5′ molecular diversity of VAChT mRNAs. These data clarify the transcription pattern of the rat ChAT/VAChT gene locus. Total and poly(A)+ RNAs were purified as described previously(8Civelli O. Birnberg N. Herbert E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6783-6787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Bejanin S. Cervini R. Mallet J. Berrard S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21944-21947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). cRNA probes were synthesized from DNA templates obtained by amplification of particular gene regions. Sequences were amplified with primer pairs AF/AR, BF/BR, or CF/CR (Fig. 2B). The corresponding PCR products A, B, and C, were subcloned (TA cloning, Invitrogen) downstream from the SP6 promoter. Linear templates for cRNA synthesis (Fig. 2B) were prepared from the subcloned PCR products either by digestion (Bsu36I for the B2 probe, HindIII for the C1 probe) or by amplification with a reverse SP6 primer and a forward specific primer (AF‘, AF, and BF‘ for the probes A1, A2, and B1, respectively). Antisense cRNA probes were synthesized (9Melton D.A. Krieg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4054) Google Scholar) using SP6 RNA polymerase (Promega) in the presence of [α-32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.). After digestion with DNase, full-length cRNAs were purified by electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide, 8.3 M urea gel. RNase protection assays were performed as described(9Melton D.A. Krieg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4054) Google Scholar), except that RNAs were hybridized to cRNA probes for 16 h at 63°C and digested with 25 μg/ml RNase A and 1 μg/ml RNase T1 at 30°C for 50 min. Northern blot experiments were performed as described(10Faucon Biguet N. Buda M. Lamouroux A. Samolyk D. Mallet J. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). DNA probes (see Fig. 3A) were 32P-labeled by nick translation (Life Technologies, Inc., probe 3) or random priming (Amersham, other probes). The restriction fragments XbaI/SphI and HindIII/XbaI (Fig. 4A) were inserted into the plasmid KS Luc, upstream from the luciferase reporter gene and downstream from a transcription terminator. KS Luc was constructed by W. Faust and A. M. Catherin.2 Cloning junctions were verified by sequencing. The cell line 293 (human embryonic kidney) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The cell lines PC-12 and PC-G2 (rat pheochromocytomas) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% horse serum with 5% or 10% fetal calf serum, respectively. Exponentially growing cells were transfected by electroporation with a single electrical pulse at 200 V using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser as in (11Boularand S. Darmon M.C. Ravassard P. Mallet J. . J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3757-3764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Cells (106) were transfected with a mixture of 1 pmol of the plasmid to be tested, 1 μg of a Rous sarcoma virus-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) vector (used to assess the transfection efficiency) and a carrier DNA (Bluescript) to give a total of 12 μg of DNA. Luciferase activity was normalized with CAT activity determined in the same extract(11Boularand S. Darmon M.C. Ravassard P. Mallet J. . J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3757-3764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Each transfection was carried out in triplicate. A V-type mRNA species was previously identified by primer extension. The longest fragment contained 426 bp of the gene sequence upstream from the translation initiation codon(4Bejanin S. Cervini R. Mallet J. Berrard S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21944-21947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar VAChT cDNA with a longer 5′-noncoding sequence (856 bp) has also been isolated(5Erickson J.D. Varoqui H. Schäfer M.K. Modi W. Diebler M.-F. Weihe E. Rand J. Eiden L.E. Bonner T.I. Usdin T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21929-21932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, several V-type VAChT mRNAs with different 5′ lengths might be produced, and we analyzed this potential diversity. RNase protection experiments were performed to localize the transcription initiation site(s) of the V-type VAChT mRNA(s). Two transcription start sites at positions −402 and −426 (Fig. 2A) were mapped with both radiolabeled antisense riboprobes A1 and A2 (Fig. 2B). In spinal cord extracts both probes yielded a similar pattern of protected fragments (Fig. 2C). First, a cluster of up to 7 protected fragments of 115-121 nucleotides, whose sizes differ by one nucleotide, was clearly revealed. The 5′ ends of these fragments lie between positions −425 and −431, within an A-rich sequence (−433, 5′-AAAGAAAAAAAAA-3′, −421). The presence of these A residues may explain why the RNase protection assay gave multiple bands rather than a single band. The 5′ end of the amplified primer extension product obtained previously ((4Bejanin S. Cervini R. Mallet J. Berrard S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21944-21947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), position −426) maps to this region, confirming that it corresponds to the same 5′ end of a VAChT mRNA. A less intense 93-nucleotide fragment was also protected, demonstrating an additional 5′ end at position −402. Thus, these two sites are used to generate a first type of V-VAChT mRNA designated as V1. In addition, both A1 and A2 probes were completely protected, indicating that a mRNA extending further upstream was also present. The transcription initiation site for this transcript was determined with the riboprobes B1 and B2 (Fig. 2B). Several identical protected fragments were visualized with both probes (Fig. 2C). Three major fragments of 223, 231, and 248 nucleotides were obtained, indicating three prevalent transcription initiation sites at positions −863, −871, and −888, respectively. Thus, the cDNA isolated previously (5Erickson J.D. Varoqui H. Schäfer M.K. Modi W. Diebler M.-F. Weihe E. Rand J. Eiden L.E. Bonner T.I. Usdin T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21929-21932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was nearly full-length, and the corresponding mRNA is referred to as V2. Therefore, two clusters of transcription start sites separated by about 450 bp are used for V-type VAChT mRNA synthesis, confirming a diversity in the 5′ region of the V-VAChT mRNAs. Surprisingly, the probes B1 and B2 were also completely protected from RNases, evidence for an additional mRNA species. Using the riboprobe C1 (Fig. 2B), which covers a sequence further upstream, as far as exon R, a single protected fragment was detected, corresponding to the complete protection of the probe (Fig. 2C). Thus, the sequence of this last mRNA, designated V3, extends at least to 16 nucleotides from the 3′ end of the exon R. These results show the existence of several V-type VAChT mRNAs. In addition, for VAChT mRNAs no diversity in the 3′ region was detected (data not shown). A single 3′ end, corresponding to position +1998, was found, which suggests that they derive from the use of a specific polyadenylation signal located 18 bp upstream. This indicates that VAChT mRNAs differ only by the length of their 5′-noncoding sequences. Brainstem or, as a negative control, liver poly(A)+ RNAs were analyzed by Northern blot using probes specific to different regions of the VAChT mRNAs (Fig. 3A). By hybridization with a probe complementary to the VAChT coding region (Fig. 3A, probe 4), two mRNAs of 2.6 and 3 kb were detected, as previously reported in spinal cord and brainstem(4Bejanin S. Cervini R. Mallet J. Berrard S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21944-21947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a diffuse band between 3.9 and 3 kb was also visualized (Fig. 3B, lanes b and 4). This result was confirmed in four independent experiments performed with different RNA preparations from spinal cord or brainstem (not shown) and by using cytoplasmic poly(A)+ RNA (Fig. 3B, lane a), thus ruling out possible contamination with nuclear primary transcripts. The hybridization pattern obtained with probe 3 (lane 3), whose sequence is specific to all V-type mRNAs, is identical to that of probe 4. A 7-day exposure of the blot was required to detect in brainstem samples a weak band near the upper point of the smear. Probe 2, specific to the V2- and V3-type mRNAs, hybridized to the 3-kb mRNA species and also revealed the diffuse band between 3.9 and 3 kb (lane 2). Probe 1, specific to V3-type mRNA, specifically recognized this diffuse band (lane 1). However, it is not clear if the presence of the smear is due to poor stability of the corresponding mRNA species. These results show that the VAChT mRNAs of 3 and 2.6 kb correspond to the V2- and V1-type mRNAs, respectively, which is in accordance with the sizes calculated from their sequences. Moreover, the V3-type mRNA encodes VAChT. This mRNA is probably produced from the same promoter as the R-type mRNAs and results from the nonexcision of the region between the exon R and the acceptor splice site at position −309. V1- and V2-type mRNAs differ by the length of their 5′ sequences. They may result from transcription either from a common promoter but initiating at different sites or from different promoter regions. These possibilities were tested by transient expression assays. The upstream regions of the V1 (XS) and V2 (HX) transcription initiation sites (Fig. 4A) were cloned upstream from the luciferase reporter gene and used to transfect three cell lines: PC-12, which expresses the endogenous VAChT gene(5Erickson J.D. Varoqui H. Schäfer M.K. Modi W. Diebler M.-F. Weihe E. Rand J. Eiden L.E. Bonner T.I. Usdin T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21929-21932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and PC-G2 and 293, in which no VAChT mRNA could be detected by RT-PCR (not shown). Both constructs promoted the transcription of the luciferase gene in all cell lines tested (Fig. 4B). Luciferase activities with XS or HX were 8-70-fold or 3-19-fold higher, respectively, than those obtained with the promoterless plasmid, depending on the cell line. Thus, both HX and XS fragments contain a promoter. The highest transcriptional activity was measured with the XS promoter region, consistent with the V1-type mRNA being more abundant than the V2-type (Fig. 3B). Both promoter regions were highly active in the noncholinergic cell lines. Therefore, they lack the regulatory motifs responsible for the tissue-specificity of VAChT gene expression. These sequences may be located in the upstream R-type promoter. Indeed, a rat genomic sequence upstream from the R-type exon has been shown to confer cholinergic specificity to the R-type promoter in vitro(12Ibanez C.F. Persson H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1991; 3: 1309-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Moreover, this region directs the in vivo expression of a heterologous downstream promoter in the cholinergic neurons(13Lönnerberg P. Lendahl U. Funakoshi H. Ärhlund-Richter L. Persson H. Ibanez C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4046-4050Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These results raise the question of whether this region controls the tissue-specific expression of both the ChAT and the VAChT genes. However, this remains to be analyzed. Fig. 5 shows the sequence of the genomic region containing the VAChT specific promoters. The sequences in and around the transcription initiation sites lack TATA and CAAT boxes or an “initiator” motif, which can promote basal transcription of genes without a TATA box(14Smale S.T. Baltimore D.B. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). The sequences of both HX and XS promoter regions are GC-rich (63 and 67% GC, respectively) and contain several consensus Sp1 binding sites. These promoter regions thus have the characteristics consistent with multiple transcription initiation sites (14Smale S.T. Baltimore D.B. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar, 15Sehgal A. Patil N. Chao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3160-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In addition, consensus sequences for a glucocorticoid response element, conserved in human (see the sequence in (5Erickson J.D. Varoqui H. Schäfer M.K. Modi W. Diebler M.-F. Weihe E. Rand J. Eiden L.E. Bonner T.I. Usdin T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21929-21932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), and for a E-box are present in the upstream region of V1 mRNA. Whether or not these potential cis-acting elements are functional remains to be determined. We can now propose a model for the transcription of the rat ChAT/VAChT gene locus. First, VAChT and ChAT genes may be transcribed from a promoter region located upstream from exon R. VAChT mRNAs are then generated when the transcription is stopped at position +1998. These VAChT mRNAs either are spliced to generate the R-type mRNAs, or remain unspliced (V3-type). Alternatively, transcription of the VAChT/ChAT genes may continue until the ChAT polyadenylation signal. R-ChAT mRNAs are then obtained by splicing out a 7-kb fragment containing the VAChT open reading frame. Second, the VAChT gene may be transcribed from the two promoters localized in the first intron of the ChAT gene to produce the VAChT mRNAs V1 and V2. Finally, the ChAT gene may be transcribed from promoters located downstream from the VAChT gene, giving rise to the ChAT N- and M-type mRNAs. Note that all VAChT mRNAs we detected have the same 3′ end, and thus there appears to be no bicistronic mRNA. To conclude, we provide evidence that promoter regions are contained within the first intron of the ChAT gene. The organization of the rat ChAT/VAChT locus is both complex and unusual, with the promoters of these two genes intermingled. The analysis of this organization may reveal novel mechanisms involved in the expression of eukaryotic genes.

NPR-A, but not NPR-C, mRNA levels were reduced in a dose-dependent fashion by ANP. The latter effect appeared to be due, at least in part, to suppression of NPR-A gene promoter activity. ANP effected a dose- and time-dependent reduction in a transiently transfected NPR-A luciferase reporter (−1575LUC). Analysis of 5′ deletion mutants of the NPR-A promoter demonstrated that the ANP-dependent sequence lies between −1575 and −1290 relative to the transcription start site. Inhibition of the ANP promoter was also effected by brain natriuretic peptide, type C natriuretic peptide, and 8-bromo-cGMP, but not by the NPR-C-selective ligand cANF. In the case of 8-bromo-cGMP, the responsive element(s) was localized to the same 285-base pair region linked to the ANP effect above. These findings indicate that ANP autoregulates its own receptors in these cells and, at least in the case of NPR-A, it does so through suppression of receptor gene expression and receptor synthesis. This suppression may operate through a cGMP-dependent element located more than a kilobase upstream from the transcription start site.

Ballermann B.J. Gunning M.E. Zeidel M.L. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 665-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). It has vasorelaxant activity in vascular smooth muscle(2Winquist R.J. Faison E.P. Nutt R.F. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1984; 102: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and it promotes urinary excretion of sodium and water by the kidney(3De Bold A.J. Borenstein H.B. Veress A.T. Sonnenberg H. Life Sci. 1981; 28: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2634) Google Scholar). It also has antimitogenic activity in renal mesangial cells(4Kohno M. Ikeda M. Johchi M. Horio T. Yasunari K. Kurihara N. Takeda T. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: E673-E679PubMed Google Scholar), vascular smooth muscle (5Itoh H. Pratt R.E. Dzau V.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1690-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) and endothelial cells(6Itoh H. Pratt R.E. Ohno M. Dzau V.J. Hypertension. 1992; 19: 758-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), glial cells of the central nervous system(7Levin E.R. Frank H.J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: R453-R457PubMed Google Scholar), and fibroblasts of the cardiac interstitium(8Cao L. Gardner D.G. Hypertension. 1995; 25: 227-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it possesses hemodynamic and antigrowth properties which oppose those of vasoconstrictors like the α-adrenergic agonists, endothelin, and angiotensin.ANP is one member of a family of natriuretic peptides which also includes brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP). ANP and BNP are both made in and secreted from the heart, circulate in plasma, and share many of the same biological activities. CNP, on the other hand, is made primarily in non-cardiac tissues, does not circulate at appreciable levels in plasma, and has a different activity profile at the level of target tissues(9Wei C.M. Aarhus L.L. Miller V.M. Burnett Jr., J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: H71-H73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At a molecular level these ligands interact with one or more of three different receptor subtypes. The type A natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR-A) has an extracellular ligand-binding domain which recognizes both ANP and BNP. This domain is linked through a trans-membrane region with a carboxyl-terminal guanylyl cyclase domain which serves as the effector portion of the receptor. The type B receptor (NPR-B) shares a similar structural topology with NPR-A but binds selectively to CNP. The C-type receptor (NPR-C) is structurally distinct from the guanylyl cyclase receptors. It contains a large extracellular ligand-binding domain followed by a short trans-membrane segment; however, its intracellular domain contains only 38 amino acids and lacks guanylyl cyclase activity. It is the predominant receptor on most vascular cells in culture(10Leitman D.C. Andresen J.W. Catalano R.M. Waldman S.A. Tuan J.J. Murad F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3720-3728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This, together with its limited intracellular structure, led investigators early on to speculate that it functioned predominantly in a clearance mode, responsible for removing natriuretic peptides from the circulating plasma and processing them to inactive forms. Direct experimental testing supports this hypothesis(11Maack T. Suzuki M. Almeida F.A. Nussenzveig D. Scarborough R.M. McEnroe G.A. Lewicki J.A. Science. 1987; 238: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 12Almeida F.A. Suzuki M. Scarborough R.M. Lewicki J.A. Maack T. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: R469-R475PubMed Google Scholar). Additional evidence suggests that NPR-C may also have a signaling function. cANF, an analogue of ANP which associates relatively selectively with NPR-C, has been shown to inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity in a number of different whole cell and membrane preparations (13Anand-Srivastava M.B. Srivastava A.K. Cantin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4931-4934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Anand-Srivastava M.B. Sairam M.R. Cantin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8566-8572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It also at least partially mimics the actions of ANP in suppressing [3H]thymidine incorporation (as an index of mitogenic activity) in vascular smooth muscle cells(5Itoh H. Pratt R.E. Dzau V.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1690-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), glial cells(7Levin E.R. Frank H.J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: R453-R457PubMed Google Scholar), and cardiac fibroblasts(8Cao L. Gardner D.G. Hypertension. 1995; 25: 227-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such studies raise the possibility that NPR-C may possess important regulatory activity operating either independently or in parallel with that of the guanylyl cyclase-linked receptors(15Levin E.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: E483-E489PubMed Google Scholar).ANP receptor levels and ANP receptor activity (assessed predominantly through ANP-dependent guanylyl cyclase activity) are regulated by a number of factors, including hormones(16Lanier-Smith K.L.

Physiological changes in the intact animal, which are known to raise circulating ANP levels, have been shown to decrease levels of 125I-ANP binding in the kidney(27Ballermann B.J. Hoover R.L.

Studies carried out with cells stably transfected with the NPR-A receptor suggest that homologous desensitization of guanylyl cyclase activity by ANP is linked to dephosphorylation of key serine and threonine residues in the receptor protein(22Potter L.R. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14636-14642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Potter L.R. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14531-14534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that the fall in cyclase activity is also associated with a reduction in steady-state levels of NPR-A mRNA and transcriptional activity of the NPR-A gene. This implies that ANP exerts both transcriptional and post-transcriptional effects to regulate the activity of its receptors in target cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsANP (rANF, 28 amino acids), brain natriuretic peptide (porcine, BNP1-32), C-type natriuretic peptide (porcine, CNP1-22), and cANF (rat, des-[Gln18,Ser19,Gly20,Leu21,Gly22]ANP 4-23-NH2) were purchased from Peninsula Laboratories, Inc. (Belmont, CA). 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX, a nonspecific phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor), forskolin, 8-bromo-cAMP, 8-bromo-cGMP, and reagents for cGMP radioimmunoassay (cGMP standard and antibody) were purchased from Sigma. M& 22948 (a selective inhibitor of the cGMP PDE) was generously provided by the Dagenham Research Center of Rhone-Poulenc, Ltd. (Dagenham, United Kingdom). Fetal bovine serum was purchased from Gemini Bioproducts, Inc. (Calabasas, CA). 125I-cGMP, [α-32P]dCTP, and [3H]acetyl coenzyme A were purchased from DuPont NEN. The bovine NPR-C cDNA and rat NPR-A cDNA were generously provided by G. Porter and D. Garbers, respectively. The luciferase assay kit was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Restriction enzymes were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. The sequenase kit for DNA sequencing was purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Other reagents were obtained from standard commercial suppliers.Cell CultureEmbryonic rat aortic smooth muscle (RASM) cells were obtained at passage 19 from H. Ives at University of California San Francisco. Cells were cultured at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2% (v/v) broth, tryptose phosphate. Cells were used after reaching confluence at passage 20-30.Receptor Binding AssayANP was labeled with Na125I using the chloramine-T method and purified as described previously(39Gardner D.G. Deschepper C.F. Ganong W.F. Hane S. Fiddes J. Baxter J.D. Lewicki J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6697-6701Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to confluence in 24-well plates (1 × 105/well) and preincubated in DMEM with or without rANP at different concentrations for different periods of time. Cells were then washed (two times) with phosphate-buffered saline. Binding assays were performed using 0.5 nM125I-ANP in 0.2 ml of binding buffer (DMEM containing 0.4% bovine serum albumin, 10 mM HEPES, and 8 μg/ml phosphoamidon). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 0.2 μM unlabeled ANP. After 30-min incubation at 37°C, cells were washed (four times) with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then solubilized in 1 ml of 1 N NaOH. Aliquots of 0.9 ml were measured for radioactivity in a γ counter (Packard Instrument Co., Cobra I, model 5005) with 80% efficiency. Specific binding was defined as total binding minus nonspecific binding. All binding data were corrected for total cellular protein concentration assessed using the Coomassie protein reagent (Pierce).To preclude the possibility that the ANP-mediated reduction in binding activity resulted from receptor occupancy with unlabeled ligand, we washed ANP-pretreated cells with acidified DMEM (pH 5.0) prior to running the binding assay as described above. These wash conditions remove >95% of prebound ligand from surface ANP receptors (data not shown).Cyclic GMP MeasurementCells were grown to confluence in 24-well plates and incubated with different concentrations of ANP for 48 h. Wells were washed (two times) with DMEM and incubated with 0.5 ml of DMEM containing 0.5 mM IBMX for 10 min at 37°C. Different concentrations of rANP were then added to the medium and the incubation continued for another 10 min. The reaction was terminated by aspiration of media and addition of 0.4 ml/well ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. The extraction was continued for 30 min at 4°C. Cell samples were centrifuged to remove precipitated proteins, and the supernatant fractions were extracted (four times) with 0.5 ml of water-saturated ether. Aliquots were lyophilized and resuspended in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.4). Cyclic GMP levels were determined by radioimmunoassay, after acetylation of the samples and standards, using a commercial antisera and 125I-cGMP.RNA Isolation and Northern Blot AnalysisCells were plated in 10-cm dishes and grown to confluence. They were washed (three times) with 10 ml of serum-free DMEM, then incubated at 37°C in serum-free DMEM containing different concentrations of ANP for 48 h. Total RNA was extracted from the cells by the guanidinium thiocyanate-CsCl method(40Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16620) Google Scholar). 30 μg of RNA was size fractionated on a 2.2 M formaldehyde, 1% agarose gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose filter, and hybridized either with a full-length (2.1 kilobase pairs) bovine NPR-C cDNA (41Fuller F. Porter J.G. Arfsten A.E. Miller J. Schilling J.W. Scarborough R.M. Lewicki J.A. Schenk D.B. J. Biol.

Chang M.S. Lowe D.G. Chin H. Goeddel D.V. Schulz S. Nature. 1989; 338: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). Blots were subsequently washed and reprobed with a 1.3-kilobase pair PstI fragment of rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA (43Fort P. Marty L. Piechaczyk M. Sabrouty S.E. Dani C. Jeanteur P. Blanchard J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1970) Google Scholar) to permit normalization of blots for differences in RNA loading and/or transfer to the filter. Each probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the random primer method(44Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 10.13-10.17Google Scholar). Autoradiography was performed with an intensifying screen at −70°C for 5-10 days. Autoradiographic signals were quantified by laser densitometry.Plasmid ConstructionAll rat NPR-A LUC constructs were based in a pFOXLUC vector. This vector was generated by substitution of luciferase for CAT coding sequences in pFOXCAT (45German M.S. Wang J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4067-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and provided to us by M. German. For the sake of convenience, constructs have been defined by the length of the rat NPR-A upstream sequence (5′ FS) (46Yamaguchi M. Rutledge L.J. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20414-20420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) linked to luciferase coding sequence (e.g. −1575LUC). Six of the deletion mutants were generated through the use of convenient restriction sites. In each case the 3′ linkage employed a NarI site (position +978 in luciferase coding sequence) of the pFOXLUC vector. The 5′ linkage employed unique restriction sites (i.e. BglII for −1575LUC, NdeI for −1290LUC, BclI for −716LUC, HindIII for −387LUC, SstII for −273LUC, and DraII for −77LUC) for placement in the polylinker of the parent vector. The shortest construct, −9LUC, contains 9 base pairs of 5′-flanking sequence from the rat NPR-A gene. It was generated from −77LUC by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using an upstream sense oligonucleotide (5′ GGG GAT CCT TCT GGC ACA CTC CTG 3′) which incorporated a BamHI site at its 5′ terminus and a downstream antisense oligonucleotide (5′ TAG AGG ATA GAA TGG CGC CGG 3′) derived from luciferase coding sequence. PCR was performed in 100 μl of reaction volume using 125 ng of DNA template (−77LUC cut with BamHI), 250 ng of each oligonucleotide, 0.4 mM dNTP, and 5 units of TaqI DNA polymerase in PCR buffer (pH 8.3) supplied by the vendor. PCR was begun with a 6-min incubation at 94°C (denaturing step) followed by 1 min at 55°C (annealing step) and 1 min at 72°C (extension step). A 2-min denaturing step was used for cycles 2-25, and the final extension step (26th cycle) was carried out for 10 min. A PCR product of appropriate size was restricted with BamHI/NarI and cloned into compatible sites of pFOXLUC. All of the deletion constructs were sequenced across the fusion junctions to confirm the predicted structure.Transfection and Luciferase AssayCells were transfected with 20 μg of one of the rat NPR-A deletion mutants and 5 μg of pRSVCAT which was employed as an internal control for transfection efficiency. The total amount of transfected DNA was adjusted with PUC18. Cells were transfected by electroporation (Gene Pulsar; Bio-Rad) using 250 V at 960 microfarads, optimal conditions which were derived empirically. After transfection, cells were plated in six-well plates at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well in 10% FBS/DMEM. Medium was changed at 24 h with serum-free DMEM containing different concentrations of ANP or other reagents, and the incubations were continued for varying periods of time. Cells were then harvested and lysed in 60 μl of 250 mM Tris, 0.1% Triton X-100. Protein concentration of each cell extract was measured using the Coomassie protein reagent. Cell lysates were processed for measurement of both luciferase and CAT activity; the luciferase data were standardized using an equal amount of soluble protein for each reaction and then normalized to an equivalent level of CAT expression. A mock-reaction containing no protein was included in both assays to establish a base-line activity which, in turn, was subtracted from each experimental value. To ensure reproducibility, experiments were repeated three to six times, using at least three different plasmid DNA preparations. Transfection efficiency, assessed from measurements of pRSVCAT activity, varied by less than 15% within a given experiment.Statistical AnalysisUnless stated otherwise, statistical differences were evaluated by one way analysis of variance with the Newman-Keuls test for significance.RESULTSPretreatment with ANP led to a significant decrease in 125I-ANP binding in cultured RASM cells. As shown in Fig. 1, ANP pretreatment effected a dose- and time-dependent reduction in binding which was maximal between 10 and 100 nM ANP after 24 h of exposure. Since the majority of ANP receptors in RASM (85-95%) are of the NPR-C or clearance receptor class, by definition this group of receptors is suppressed by ANP. This inhibition was reproduced in cultures subjected to the acid wash (without wash: 12.3 ± 1.5% of control binding; with wash: 33.9 ± 1.5% of control binding after 24 h. treatment with 0.1 μM ANP), indicating that the decrease in binding could not be accounted for exclusively by prior receptor occupancy with ligand.To determine whether ANP had independent effects on levels of the guanylyl cyclase-linked receptors, we examined the effect of ANP pretreatment on the subsequent ability of ANP to trigger the synthesis of cGMP in these cultures. As shown in Fig. 2, there was a dose-dependent reduction in ANP-stimulated cGMP generation (largely reflective of NPR-A activity) following pretreatment with the peptide, suggesting that ANP suppresses or down-regulates activity of both NPR-A and NPR-C in these RASM cells.Figure 2Effect of ANP pretreatment on ANP-stimulated cyclic GMP production in cultured RASM cells. Confluent cells were preincubated with 10 or 100 nM ANP for 48 h. Cells were then washed extensively and re-challenged with increasing concentrations of ANP in the presence of IBMX (0.5 mM) for 10 min. All values are normalized to cGMP levels found in untreated cells. Data are presented as mean ± S.D.; n = 3. ∗, p < 0.05;∗∗, p < 0.01 versus corresponding point(s) in untreated groups.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next attempted to determine whether either of these effects were operative at the level of receptor synthesis. To approach this question we isolated RNA from RASM cells pretreated with increasing concentrations of ANP and subjected them to Northern blot hybridization. As seen in Fig. 3, ANP pretreatment effected a dose-dependent decrease in NPR-A mRNA levels in these cells. Maximal inhibition to 48% of control levels was seen at 10-7M ANP. Levels of the housekeeping transcript for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were unchanged by the treatment. Interestingly, levels of the NPR-C transcript were also unaffected by ANP treatment. This suggests that the reduction in NPR-A activity results, at least in part, from a decrease in receptor synthesis, whereas the coincident reduction in NPR-C levels is dependent upon a post-synthetic mechanism.Figure 3Northern blots show effect of ANP pretreatment on expression of mRNA for natriuretic peptide receptor subtypes A (NPR-A) and C (NPR-C) in cultured RASM cells. A, cells were pretreated with increasing concentrations of ANP for 48 h in serum-free medium and total RNA was collected. 30 μg of RNA from each group was size-fractionated, transferred to a nitrocellulose filter, blot-hybridized simultaneously with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNAs for NPR-C and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and then autoradiographed at −70°C for 3 days. Lane 1, control; lanes 2-4, 10-9, 10-8, and 10-7M ANP, respectively. The same membrane was stripped of bound probe, rehybridized with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled NPR-A cDNA probe, and autoradiographed at −70°C for 7 days. B, autoradiographs from two independent experiments were scanned by laser densitometry and the average density plotted arbitrarily as a function of the relevant control signal.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To explore this further we constructed a series of 5′ deletion mutants of the rat NPR-A gene promoter, linked them to a luciferase reporter, introduced them into RASM cells by transient transfection, and examined the effects of ANP treatment on reporter expression. As seen in Fig. 4, treatment of cells transfected with −1575LUC, a construct harboring 1575 base pairs of NPR-A gene 5′ FS linked to luciferase coding sequence, with ANP led to a dose- and time-dependent reduction in reporter activity. Maximal inhibition was seen at 10-7M ANP after 48 h of treatment. To localize the cis-acting element responsible for conferring this inhibitory activity, we introduced the 5′-deletion mutants described above into RASM cells and examined their expression in the presence or absence of ANP treatment (Fig. 5). Based on the deletion profile presented in this figure, it is clear that NPR-A gene transcription is positively regulated by at least three regions in the promoter positioned between −1575 and −1290, −716 and −387, and −273 and −77 relative to the transcription start site. ANP exerted a significant negative effect on the −1575LUC reporter, as described above; however, truncation of the reporter to −1290 and smaller derivatives resulted in a loss of the ANP-dependent inhibition. By inference this suggests that the element responsible for suppressing transcriptional activity from the NPR-A gene promoter is located between −1290 and −1575 relative to the transcription start site.Figure 4Effect of ANP pretreatment on −1575LUC activity. Cultured RASM cells were co-transfected with 20 μg of −1575LUC and 5 μg of pRSVCAT. After 24-h incubation in 10% FBS/DMEM, cells were washed and treated with serum-free DMEM containing indicated concentrations of ANP for different periods of time.

https://openalex.org/W2012496453,"Phosphacan, a soluble nervous tissue-specific chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, is an alternative splicing product representing the entire extracellular domain of a transmembrane receptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase (RPTPζ/β) that also occurs as a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan in brain. We have previously demonstrated that phosphacan binds with high affinity to neural cell adhesion molecules (Ng-CAM/L1 and N-CAM) and to the extracellular matrix protein tenascin and that it is a potent inhibitor of cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth. Tryptic digests of 125I-labeled phosphacan contain two glycopeptides that bind to Ng-CAM/L1, N-CAM, and tenascin. The larger of these (17 kDa) begins at Gln-209 near the end of the carbonic anhydrase-like domain of phosphacan/RPTPζ/β, whereas a 13-kDa glycopeptide begins at His-361 located in the middle of the fibronectin type III-like domain. Treatment of phosphacan with peptide N-glycosidase under nondenaturing conditions reduced its binding to the neural cell adhesion molecules and tenascin by 65-75%, whereas endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H had no effect, and peptide N-glycosidase treatment both decreased the molecular sizes of the tryptic peptides to ∼11 kDa and abolished their binding. Based on the amino acid sequence of phosphacan, it can be concluded that each of the tryptic peptides contains one potential N-glycosylation site (at Asn-232 and Asn-381), and analyses of the isolated glycopeptides demonstrated the presence of sialylated complex-type oligosaccharides. Our results therefore indicate that the interactions of phosphacan/RPTPζ/β with neural cell adhesion molecules and tenascin are mediated by asparagine-linked oligosaccharides present in their carbonic anhydrase- and fibronectin type III-like domains.

We have previously described the isolation and biochemical properties of phosphacan, a nervous tissue-specific chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan that is synthesized by astrocytes (Rauch et al., 1991). Cloning of phosphacan (Maurel et al., 1994) demonstrated that it is an alternative splicing product representing the entire extracellular domain of a receptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) 1The abbreviations used are: RPTPreceptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatasePBSphosphate-buffered salineEndoendo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidaseBSAbovine serum albuminPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. named RPTPζ/β (Krueger and Saito, 1992; Levy et al., 1993; Maurel et al., 1995). A keratan sulfate-containing glycoform (phosphacan-KS) also occurs in postnatal brain (Rauch et al., 1991; Maurel et al., 1994; Meyer-Puttlitz et al., 1995). Phosphacan binds reversibly and with high affinity to the neural cell adhesion molecules Ng-CAM/L1 and N-CAM (Kd∼0.1 nM) and to the extracellular matrix protein tenascin (Kd = 3 nM), but not to over a dozen other cell membrane and extracellular matrix proteins tested (Milev et al., 1994; Grumet et al., 1994). These studies also demonstrated that phosphacan is a potent inhibitor of neuronal and glial adhesion and of neurite outgrowth. Because of its potential importance both as a developmentally regulated extracellular matrix proteoglycan of nervous tissue and as the ligand-binding domain of a transmembrane protein-tyrosine phosphatase (which also occurs in the form of a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan in brain; Shitara et al., 1994), we have attempted to identify the region of phosphacan/RPTPζ/β that participates in its interactions with nervous tissue proteins, using the glycosylated proteoglycan that is synthesized by rat brain in vivo. Phosphacan contains an N-terminal carbonic anhydrase-like domain followed by a single fibronectin type III sequence and a glycosaminoglycan linkage region to which are attached three to four chondroitin sulfate chains and (in the case of phosphacan-KS) a similar or greater number of keratan sulfate chains which vary in length and fine structure (Rauch et al., 1991; Maurel et al., 1994). We have found that two tryptic glycopeptides derived from the carbonic anhydrase- and fibronectin type III-like domains of phosphacan/RPTPζ/β bind to the neural cell adhesion molecules and tenascin and that their interactions are mediated by asparagine-linked oligosaccharides. receptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase phosphate-buffered saline endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase bovine serum albumin polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Phosphacan was isolated from PBS extracts of 7-day and adult rat brain by DEAE-cellulose ion exchange chromatography and Sepharose CL-6B gel filtration, followed by immunoaffinity chromatography using the 3F8 monoclonal antibody (Rauch et al., 1991). The proteoglycan was labeled to a specific activity of ∼1019 cpm/mol with 125I by the lactoperoxidase/glucose oxidase method using Enzymobeads (Bio-Rad). Typically, 25 μg of protein were labeled per reaction, and free iodine was removed by gel filtration on a PD-10 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Trypsin and chondroitinase ABC digestions were performed at 37°C in 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 30 mM sodium acetate. A range of trypsin to phosphacan ratios was tested, from which it was found that the optimal conditions for generation of peptides capable of binding to Ng-CAM were 2-h digestion at an enzyme-substrate ratio of 1 to 20 (w/w) or 18 h at a ratio of 1 to 200-400. L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-trypsin was obtained from Worthington, and following digestion the enzyme was inactivated using 0.5 mMNα-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (Sigma). For removal of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides, phosphacan was treated for 6 h at 37°C with either recombinant peptide N-glycosidase (EC 3.5.1.52) or with a mixture of peptide N-glycosidase and endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase F1 (Endo F1) purified from Flavobacterium meningosepticum. Digestions were performed in 50 mM PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 2 mg/ml heat-treated BSA, using 0.125-0.5 units of glycosidase/100 ng of proteoglycan protein (2 × 106 cpm). Phosphacan was also treated with recombinant endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (Endo H) prepared from Streptomyces lividans. Digestion with Endo H was performed at pH 6.5 or 7.4 for 18 h in 50 mM PBS containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 2 mg/ml heat-treated BSA, using 10 milliunits of glycosidase/100 ng of proteoglycan protein. All endoglycosidases were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim, and units are according to the manufacturer's definitions, which differ for the three enzymes. Chicken Ng-CAM, rat L1/NILE, and chicken and rat N-CAM were purified from 14-day embryonic chicken brains and 7-day postnatal rat brains by immunoaffinity chromatography as described previously (Friedlander et al., 1994) and generously provided by Dr. Martin Grumet. Human tenascin was obtained from Dr. Mario Bourdon. Binding assays were performed in removable Immulon-4 wells in 16 mM Tris, pH 7.2, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.02% NaN3 containing 1 mg/ml heat-treated BSA as described previously (Milev et al., 1994), and the same buffer was used for blocking. For binding assays with labeled tryptic peptides, wells were coated with a higher concentration of Ng-CAM and N-CAM (10 μg/ml) than used for solid-phase binding of native phosphacan (2 μg/ml) and incubated with gentle shaking (45 rpm) for 4 h at room temperature. For SDS-PAGE, the wells were washed and bound material was extracted with hot SDS sample buffer. For N-terminal sequencing of the 13- and 17-kDa peptides that bound to the neural cell adhesion molecules, 52 μg of unlabeled phosphacan was mixed with 780,000 cpm of 125I-labeled phosphacan (without added BSA) and treated for 2 h with 80 milliunits of chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku America Inc.) and then for 18 h with trypsin at an enzyme-substrate ratio of 1 to 400. SDS-PAGE (on a 1.5 mm, 12.5% minigel) and transfer to a ProBlott membrane (Applied Biosystems) were performed as described previously (Rauch et al., 1991). Due to the poor Coomassie Blue staining of phosphacan, the positions of the 13- and 17-kDa bands were determined by autoradiography before excision from the membrane. Tryptic glycopeptides were prepared from 50-100 μg of phosphacan, transferred to a ProBlott membrane after electrophoresis on a 15% minigel, and the 13- and 17-kDa bands were excised as described above. Bands were hydrolyzed for 4 h at 100°C in 2 M trifluoroacetic acid for analysis of neutral sugars and hexosamines or for 30 min in 0.1 N HCl at 80°C for sialic acid, and monosaccharides were quantitated by high-performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (Weitzhandler et al., 1993; Margolis and Margolis, 1994). A single hydrolysis was used for both neutral and amino sugars to allow calculation of molar ratios, and hexosamine values were corrected for release under these conditions. Due to the presence in the membrane of apparently polymeric material that after hydrolysis yielded a large interfering peak at the elution position of glucose, the ProBlott membrane was prehydrolyzed for 4 h in 2 M trifluoroacetic acid and washed with water before use for transfer of the tryptic glycopeptides. Tryptic (glyco)peptides prepared from 125I-labeled phosphacan gave a complex pattern on an SDS-PAGE gradient gel (Fig. 1A). When this mixture was added to plastic wells coated with chick Ng-CAM, its rat homolog L1/NILE, or rat or chick N-CAM, two bands with apparent molecular sizes of 13 and 17 kDa were seen on autoradiographs of SDS gels of the bound radioactivity (Fig. 1D and data not shown), and proteins of these sizes were depleted from the unbound material (Fig. 1C). The bound 13- and 17-kDa peptides were also seen without chondroitinase treatment and following elution and electrophoresis in the absence of mercaptoethanol. These results are consistent with both peptides originating from regions of phosphacan before the first potential chondroitin sulfate attachment site at Ser-595 (Maurel et al., 1994) and demonstrate that each peptide binds independently, rather than as a result of disulfide linkage to a single peptide that contains the binding site. There was much less binding of tryptic peptides to immobilized tenascin, which probably reflects the 30-fold lower affinity of the phosphacan-tenascin as compared with the phosphacan-Ng-CAM interactions (Grumet et al., 1994; Milev et al., 1994). However, the 13- and 17-kDa peptides could also be identified by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography after elution from tenascin-coated wells. To determine the origin of these peptides within the phosphacan sequence, unlabeled proteoglycan was mixed with iodinated material, digested with trypsin, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a ProBlott membrane. The positions of the 13- and 17-kDa peptides were identified by autoradiography, and the excised bands were used for N-terminal microsequencing. The 13-kDa peptide gave a sequence (HEFLT DGYQDLGAILNNLIP-MSYV) beginning at His-361 of phosphacan, whereas the 17-kDa peptide sequence (QA-FILQNLLPISTDKYY) began at Gln-209 (Fig. 2A). In view of the fact that two peptides were observed to bind to the neural cell adhesion molecules and tenascin and that both peptides contained potential N-glycosylation sites (at Asn-232 and Asn-381), we considered the possibility that oligosaccharides might be involved in these interactions. Moreover, there was a blank at Asn-381 in our amino acid sequence of the 13-kDa tryptic peptide (see above), indicating that this glycosylation site was utilized. Following peptide N-glycosidase treatment of phosphacan, the electrophoretic mobility of the tryptic peptides increased and appeared as a probably overlapping broad band of the two peptides at approximately 11 kDa (Fig. 1, E-H). Based on this result and the residue weights, it can be estimated that the C termini of the two peptides are probably at Lys-303 and Lys-456. Although the decrease in molecular size following deglycosylation of the larger glycopeptide is greater than can be accounted for by the size of a complex oligosaccharide, this result is nevertheless consistent with the anomalously slow electrophoretic migration of certain glycopeptides and glycoproteins, which varies with oligosaccharide and protein structure, due to decreased binding of SDS (Segrest and Jackson, 1972; Leach et al., 1980). Peptide N-glycosidase treatment of phosphacan reduced its binding to the neural cell adhesion molecules and tenascin by 65-75% but had little or no effect on the binding of neurocan (Fig. 3), which is a member of the aggrecan-versican family of hyaluronic acid-binding proteoglycans and has no known structural similarity to phosphacan (Rauch et al., 1992). These results are in good agreement with our previous demonstration that, in distinction to phosphacan (Milev et al., 1994), the interactions of neurocan with neural cell adhesion molecules are to a large extent mediated by its chondroitin sulfate chains (Friedlander et al., 1994). Similar effects of N-deglycosylation were observed when binding was measured in buffer containing 150 mM rather than 50 mM NaCl, although as demonstrated previously the percent bound is somewhat lower in 150 mM NaCl (Milev et al., 1994). The residual phosphacan binding after peptide N-glycosidase treatment probably reflects incomplete deglycosylation of the unreduced protein under nondenaturing conditions in which the oligosaccharides may not be completely accessible to the enzyme (Tarentino et al., 1985; Hirani et al., 1987; Nuck et al., 1990), and this is apparent in the small amounts of the 17- and 13-kDa glycopeptides that are obtained from glycosidase-treated phosphacan (Fig. 1, lanes F and H). As expected, there were only traces of radioactivity bound to Ng-CAM and N-CAM using tryptic peptides prepared from peptide N-glycosidase-treated phosphacan (data not shown). Because there are developmental changes in the glycosylation of phosphacan (Rauch et al., 1991), we also tested binding and the effects of N-deglycosylation using proteoglycan isolated from both 7-day postnatal and adult brain, but no age-related differences were found (Fig. 1 and Fig. 3). Electrophoresis of glycosidase-treated phosphacan showed no evidence of protease activity in the enzyme preparation, and control experiments showed that residual glycosidase present in the diluted proteoglycan used for the binding assay did not affect binding by acting on the CAM or tenascin during the binding incubation period. In fact, treatment of Ng-CAM with peptide N-glycosidase increased the binding of phosphacan by nearly 100%, but peptide N-glycosidase treatment of N-CAM and tenascin had no effect on phosphacan binding (data not shown). Moreover, glycosidase treatment of Ng-CAM had no detectable effect on the binding of phosphacan tryptic glycopeptides, suggesting that N-linked oligosaccharides on Ng-CAM may modulate its interactions with phosphacan by affecting Ng-CAM conformation or through steric factors. Monosaccharide analyses of the two tryptic glycopeptides showed in both cases the presence of glucosamine, mannose, galactose, and sialic acid in molar ratios characteristic of triantennary oligosaccharides (Table 1). A large portion of the oligosaccharides on the 17-kDa glycopeptide also contain fucose. These results are consistent with the finding that treatment of phosphacan with Endo H, which releases high-mannose and hybrid oligosaccharides, had no effect on its binding to Ng-CAM, N-CAM, or tenascin (data not shown). We have previously found that phosphacan contains oligosaccharides with 3-sulfated residues that are recognized by the HNK-1 monoclonal antibody (Rauch et al., 1991), as well as LewisX oligosaccharides (Allendoerfer et al., 1995) that are not present on other soluble chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans of rat brain. 2P. Milev, B. Meyer-Puttlitz, R. K. Margolis, and R. U. Margolis, unpublished results. However, staining of immunoblots demonstrated that neither of the tryptic glycopeptides that bind to neural cell adhesion molecules and tenascin show HNK-1 or LewisX reactivity, indicating that these structures are not involved in the interactions we have described.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The only amino acid sequence similarity between the two tryptic glycopeptides resides in the octapeptides ILQNLLPN (beginning at residue 215) and ILNNLIPN (beginning at residue 374), which have 75% identity (Fig. 2A). A synthetic peptide containing the ILNNLIPN sequence and corresponding to a lysine followed by the first 21 amino acids of the 13-kDa glycopeptide produced up to 60% inhibition of phosphacan binding to Ng-CAM. However, there was even greater inhibition by a scrambled control peptide having the same amino acid composition, and binding inhibition studies using the first or last ten amino acids of this peptide sequence as well as a number of unrelated peptides also failed to support the involvement of these octapeptide sequences in phosphacan binding (Fig. 4). The highly variable inhibitory effects of the tested peptides probably reflects their ability to interact nonspecifically with the oligosaccharides involved in phosphacan binding. Although there has been considerable interest in the function of glycans in molecular recognition, protein sorting, and developmental processes, the dramatic decrease in binding of phosphacan/RPTPζ/β to Ng-CAM/L1, N-CAM, and tenascin following removal of N-linked oligosaccharides represents one of the still relatively few instances in which they have been demonstrated to play a role in protein interactions in vertebrate tissues. Because glycosylation is tissue- and cell type-specific (Parekh et al., 1987, 1989), we chose to utilize for our studies phosphacan purified from brain, since recombinant forms may not address the function of the native proteoglycan, and this is presumably the reason why carbonic anhydrase and fibronectin type III domains of phosphacan/RPTPζ/β expressed as Fc fusion proteins in COS7 or 293 cells were not capable of binding to Ng-CAM, N-CAM, or tenascin (Peles et al., 1995). The lack of binding of a recombinant protein containing the phosphacan/RPTPζ/β amino acid sequence up to Leu-415 provides additional evidence for the role of specific oligosaccharides in the binding process. Our results suggest that the neural cell adhesion molecules and tenascin, all of which are involved in cell interactions, contain a lectin sequence that binds the phosphacan/RPTPζ/β oligosaccharides, and like certain other lectins, the binding of phosphacan by tenascin requires the presence of divalent cations.2 The phosphacan binding site may be located in the Ig-like domains of Ng-CAM and N-CAM, since it has previously been reported that the fourth Ig-like domain of N-CAM contains a recognition site for high-mannose oligosaccharides on L1 (Horstkorte et al., 1993) and that a soluble immunoglobulin fusion construct of CD22, a B cell-specific receptor of the Ig-superfamily, binds to the trisaccharide Sia(α2-6)Gal(β1-4)GlcNAc that is present in N- and O-linked oligosaccharides (Powell et al., 1995). Other oligosaccharides may also participate in the binding process in addition to those on the two identified tryptic glycopeptides. The affinity of phosphacan/RPTPζ/β for neural cell adhesion molecules and tenascin is several orders of magnitude greater than that for most lectin interactions with monovalent oligosaccharide ligands, which are usually in the micromolar range (Lee and Lee, 1994), and is therefore consistent with multiple interactions. A more detailed structural characterization of the phosphacan/RPTPζ/β glycans is clearly of interest, both because this information may be useful for the design of agents that affect interactions of a receptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase with its ligands, and insofar as the asparagine-linked oligosaccharides involved in the binding of phosphacan to neural cell adhesion molecules and tenascin are also likely to mediate its potent inhibitory effects on cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth that we reported previously (Milev et al., 1994).

Brosius J. Sealfon S.C. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar)), members of this family contain a cysteine in the putative first extracellular loop (EC-1) near the top of the third transmembrane domain (TM-3) and another cysteine in EC-2. It has been assumed that this pair of Cys residues forms a disulfide bond in most GPCRs(2Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R.A.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). This linkage has been proposed to be important to allow the receptor to attain a normal conformation during synthesis, for normal expression on the cell surface or to maintain normal function, in particular, normal binding and activation. Data consistent with the presence of a disulfide bond between these two conserved Cys residues have been reported for some receptors of the GPCR family, but there is evidence that these residues do not always participate in this linkage. Evidence in support of this disulfide linkage has been primarily of two types. First, it has been shown that the binding affinity of a number of GPCRs is decreased under reducing conditions. This effect, however, may involve reductions of disulfides other than this proposed bond. And second, substitution of one or the other of these Cys residues has led to decreased binding affinity, expression, or activation. These effects may be due to loss of the disulfide bond or could be caused by an adverse effect of the substituting amino acid (see below). guanine nucleotide-binding protein-coupled receptor thyrotropin-releasing hormone TRH receptor transmembrane domain e.g. third TM extracellular domain e.g. first extracellular loop dithiothreitol equilibrium inhibitory constant inositol phosphate [Nτ-methyl-His]TRH half-maximally effective concentration wild type. Rhodopsin, β2-adrenergic receptors, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are the best studied GPCRs with regard to the presence of an extracellular disulfide bond. In experiments with mutants of rhodopsin in which one or both of the cysteines were substituted by alanine(4Davidson F.F. Loewen P.C. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4029-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), findings were consistent with the presence of a disulfide bond between the conserved Cys residues. In contrast to previous studies in which the Cys residues were substituted with Ser (see below)(5Karnik S.S. Sakmar T.P. Chen H.-B. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8459-8463Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 6Doi T. Molday R.S. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the β2-adrenergic receptor, there may be two extracellular disulfide bonds. Single substitution with Val of all four Cys residues in the β2-adrenergic receptor caused decreases in binding affinity and receptor expression, but the residues linked by disulfide bonds were not identified(8Dixon R.A.F.

Lefkowitz R.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2335-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In fact, data from a series of β2-adrenergic receptor mutants in which the cysteines were substituted with Ala show there is no disulfide bond between the two conserved cysteines(10Noda K. Saad Y. Graham R.M. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6743-6752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data from experiments in which muscarinic acetylcholine receptors have been mutated are more difficult to interpret because the conserved Cys residues were substituted by Ser (11Savarese T.M. Wang C.-D. Fraser C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11439-11448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (see below). (Findings from experiments in which muscarinic receptors were labeled with a disulfide-specific reagent are consistent with the presence of a disulfide bond between the conserved cysteines(12Kurtenbach E. Pedder E.K. Curtis C.A.M. Hulme E.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990; 18: 442-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 13Kurtenbach E. Curtis C.A.M. Pedder E.K. Aitken A. Harris A.C.M. Hulme E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13702-13708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).) The data for other members of the GPCR family are also consistent with the presence of this bond but are not conclusive. For example, it has been reported that single substitution of any of four extracellular cysteines with glycine in the angiotensin II AT1 receptor leads to a 10-fold decrease in affinity(14Yamano Y. Ohyama K. Chaki S. Guo D.-F. Inagami T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1426-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A number of GPCRs have been studied by mutation of the conserved cysteines to serines. The data from these experiments are difficult to interpret because the hydrophilic nature of the hydroxyl group of serine may have adversely affected receptor conformation. This idea is based on findings with rhodopsin. It was observed that substitution of the conserved Cys residues with Ser in rhodopsin resulted in more marked deleterious effects than substitution with Ala (4Davidson F.F. Loewen P.C. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4029-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) in that Cys to Ser mutants exhibited abnormal levels of expression and glycosylation and an inability to bind retinal(5Karnik S.S.

Thus, studies of, for example, muscarinic acetylcholine (11Savarese T.M. Wang C.-D. Fraser C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11439-11448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptors (15Kosugi S. Ban T. Akamizu T. Kohn L.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Commun. 1994; 199: 612-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) in which mutant receptors with Ser substitutions demonstrated loss of binding must be interpreted cautiously. Thus, it cannot be concluded that conserved Cys residues in EC-1 and EC-2 form a disulfide bond in all GPCRs. Moreover, if a disulfide bond is present in a GPCR it is not necessarily critical for attainment of the native conformation, level of expression, or function of the receptor. The TRH receptor (TRH-R) is a member of the GPCR family(17Straub R.E. Frech G.C. Joho R.H. Gershengorn M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9514-9518Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In previous studies, binding of TRH has been found to decrease under disulfide bond reducing conditions(18Ogawa N. Yamawaki Y. Kuroda H. Nukina I. Ota Z. Fujino M. Yanaihara N. Peptides. 1982; 3: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 19Sharif N.A. Burt D.R. J. Neurochem. 1984; 42: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The studies presented here were undertaken to determine whether the conserved Cys at position 98 (Cys-98) of EC-1 and the conserved Cys-179 of EC-2 of TRH-R are covalently linked by a disulfide bond and whether this linkage is necessary for normal TRH-R function. Our data, based on single and double mutations of these Cys residues and on the effects of the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) on these mutants, offer strong evidence that a disulfide bond is present between Cys-98 and Cys-179 and, furthermore, that this linkage is critical for maintaining the high affinity conformation of TRH-R. TRH was purchased from Calbiochem, MeTRH and DTT from Sigma, and [3H]MeTRH from DuPont NEN. The expression vector pCDM8 was from Invitrogen. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal calf serum were from Life Technologies, Inc. Nu-Serum was from Collaborative Research. Restriction endonucleases were from New England Biolabs. The full-length mouse TRH-R cDNA in pCDM8 (pCDM8mTRHR) (20Gershengorn M.C. Thaw C.N. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 1204-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) was used for mutation and transformation. Mutants were prepared by polymerase chain reaction, and plasmid sequences were confirmed by the dideoxy chain termination method. C98A and C179A TRH-Rs were digested with BspHI and Nsi1 and the 184-base pair restriction fragment from C98A TRH-R subcloned into C179A TRH-R to construct C98A/C179A TRH-R. The double mutant C98S/C179S TRH-R was prepared by polymerase chain reaction using C98S TRH-R as a template. COS-1 cells and AtT-20 cells were maintained and transfected as described(21Perlman J.H.

Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 480-484PubMed Google Scholar). Assays were performed as described(21Perlman J.H. Thaw C.N. Laakkonen L. Bowers C.Y. Osman R. Gershengorn M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1610-1613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To study the effects of reduction of disulfide bonds on IP formation, cells expressing TRH-Rs were preincubated for 1 h at 37°C in the absence or presence of 10 mM DTT. LiCl (10 mM) and various concentrations of TRH were then added for an additional 1 h at 37°C. Assays were performed as described (21Perlman J.H. Thaw C.N. Laakkonen L. Bowers C.Y. Osman R. Gershengorn M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1610-1613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To study the effects of reduction of disulfide bonds on binding, cells expressing TRH-Rs were preincubated for 1 h at 37°C in the absence or presence of 10 mM DTT. [3H]MeTRH (1 nM, in the absence of DTT, or 5-10 nM, in the presence of DTT) and various concentrations of unlabeled MeTRH were then added for an additional 1 h at 37°C. Curves were fitted by nonlinear regression and drawn with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). To begin to assess the importance of disulfide bonds in TRH-R for binding, the effect of the reducing agent DTT was studied. WT TRH-Rs were stably expressed in AtT-20 pituitary cells(23Ashworth R. Yu R. Nelson E.J. Dermer S. Gershengorn M.C. Hinkle P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 24Matus-Leibovitch N. Nussenzveig D.R. Gershengorn M.C. Oron Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1041-1047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and binding affinities for MeTRH were measured in the absence or presence of DTT (Fig. 1A). In the absence of DTT, the Ki for MeTRH was 1.3 nM, and the affinity was lowered 16-fold in the presence of DTT. For WT TRH-Rs transiently expressed in COS-1 cells, the Ki for MeTRH was 2.4 nM in the absence of DTT and was lowered 22-fold in the presence of DTT (Fig. 1B, Table 1). These data, from two different cell lines, indicate the importance of a reducible disulfide bond(s) in TRH-R for high affinity binding.Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab To determine which cysteines were contributing to this effect, the conserved Cys-98 and Cys-179, as well as the nonconserved Cys-100, were mutated to alanine, expressed transiently in COS-1 cells, and assayed for binding (Table 1). The affinity of C100A TRH-R for MeTRH was the same as WT TRH-R. In contrast, C98A and C179A TRH-Rs showed no specific binding with up to 10 nM [3H]MeTRH. To estimate the affinity of these presumably low affinity receptors, the EC50 values of TRH for stimulation of IP formation were measured. The maximal extents of stimulation of WT, C98A, C100A, and C179A TRH-Rs were the same, which is consistent with the idea that the efficacies of these receptors are similar. Therefore, relative potencies were used to estimate relative affinities(25Limbird L.E. Cell Surface Receptors: A Short Course on Theory and Methods. Martinus Nijhoff Publishing, Boston1986: 1-49Google Scholar). The EC50 of TRH in cells expressing WT TRH-R was 0.84 nM. The EC50 values of C98A, C100A, and C179A TRH-Rs were 4400-, 2-, and 640-fold higher than that of WT TRH-R (Fig. 2A, Table 1). This indicated that C98A and C179A TRH-Rs are expressed on the cell surface and that Cys-98 and Cys-179 are critical for high affinity binding. In contrast, Cys-100 does not appear to be important for high affinity binding. To determine whether there was an interaction between Cys-98 and Cys-179, the double mutant C98A/C179A TRH-R was expressed in COS-1 cells and the EC50 of TRH was measured. If mutation of Cys-98 and Cys-179 were affecting the same bond, one would expect the effect of the double mutation to be similar to the effects of the individual mutations. This is what was found. The EC50 for C98A/C179A TRH-R was the same as that for C98A TRH-R, indicating that mutation of either Cys-98 or Cys-179 resulted in loss of the same bond. To confirm these findings, Cys-98 and Cys-179 were mutated to Ser. The maximal stimulations by TRH in COS-1 cells expressing C98S, C179S, and C98S/C179S TRH-Rs were 64 ± 9, 53 ± 10, and 97 ± 5% of that in cells expressing WT-TRH-Rs. The EC50 values for TRH in cells expressing C98S, C179S, and C98S/C179S TRH-Rs were 200,000-, 21,000-, and 430,000-fold higher than that of WT TRH-R (Fig. 2B, Table 1). Therefore, as for the mutations to Ala, single mutations of Cys-98 or Cys-179 to Ser resulted in loss of high affinity binding. The results with the doubly mutated receptor were consistent with the presence of a disulfide bond between Cys-98 and Cys-179 because the estimated affinity of C98S/C179S TRH-R was similar to C98S TRH-R and was much less than the additive losses of C98S and C179S TRH-Rs that would be expected if these mutations affected different aspects of TRH-R. The recovery of a WT level of maximal stimulation by the double Ser mutant is consistent with an interaction between Cys-98 and Cys-179 also. That is, the two Ser residues in C98S/C179S TRH-R may form a hydrogen bond that could function in place of the native disulfide bond and restore efficacy to the double mutant receptor. To obtain additional evidence that a disulfide bond was present between Cys-98 and Cys-179, we measured the effects of DTT on the EC50 values of TRH for stimulation of IPs in cells expressing mutant receptors. In AtT-20 cells expressing WT TRH-Rs, the EC50 in the presence of DTT was 120-fold higher than in the absence of DTT (0.66 (0.42-1.0) nMversus 78(53-120) nM) demonstrating that effects of DTT on affinity could be assessed through measurement of IP formation. The effects of DTT on estimated affinities of WT and mutant receptors expressed in COS-1 cells were then measured (Table 1). In the presence of DTT, the EC50 values of WT and C100A TRH-Rs were 12- and 9.3-fold higher, respectively, compared with stimulation in the absence of DTT, indicating the presence of a disulfide bond important for binding. In contrast, the EC50 values of C98A and C179A TRH-Rs were lower, 30 and 61%, respectively, in the presence of DTT than in the absence of DTT. This indicates that the critical disulfide bond present in WT TRH-R is absent in C98A and C179A TRH-R. This is consistent with there being a disulfide link specifically between Cys-98 and Cys-179 in WT TRH-R that is important for high affinity binding. We conclude there is a disulfide bond between the conserved Cys-98 of EC-1 and the conserved Cys-179 of EC-2 in TRH-R and that this bond is necessary to constrain TRH-R in a high affinity conformation. These conclusions are based on the following observations: 1) high affinity TRH binding is decreased by DTT in WT TRH-Rs; 2) substitution of either of the conserved Cys residues decreased estimated TRH binding affinity whereas substitution of nearby Cys-100 did not affect binding affinity; 3) estimated binding affinity was not decreased by DTT in mutants in which Cys-98 or Cys-179 were substituted by Ala; 4) substitution of both Cys residues by Ala did not decrease estimated affinity more than substitution of Cys-98 alone; and 5) the double mutant C98S/C179S TRH-R, in which both cysteines were substituted with serines, was capable of stimulating a higher level of IP formation than C98S or C179S TRH-Rs. This last point is consistent with the idea that single Ser substitutions are more deleterious to receptor expression or efficacy than the double mutant because in the double mutant the two Ser residues may form a hydrogen bond that could simulate the function of the lost disulfide bond. Similarly, single substitutions of conserved Cys residues with Ser in the parathyroid hormone/parathyroid hormone-related peptide receptor were found to cause greater decreases in expression of this receptor than that observed with the double mutant(26Lee C. Gardella T.J. Abou-Samra A.-B. Nussbaum S.R. Segre G.V. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Jüppner H. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1488-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In contrast to the effect on WT TRH-Rs, pretreatment with the reducing agent DTT did not lower the potencies of C98A or C179A TRH-Rs but increased them. This suggests that DTT affects another disulfide bond(s) in TRH-R or in another cellular protein(s) in addition to the disulfide link between Cys-98 and Cys-179. As reduction of this disulfide bond(s) increases the apparent potency of TRH, the effect of breaking the Cys-98/Cys-179 disulfide bond is underestimated. This would explain, in part, the greater decrease in estimated affinity, which is based on relative potencies, noted with Cys-98 or Cys-179 mutants than that observed upon incubating WT TRH-R with DTT. Other factors that may account for these differences may be the more deleterious effects of either a methyl group (in Ala) or a hydroxyl group (in Ser) rather than free sulfhydryl groups (in 2 Cys) and differences between preventing formation of a disulfide bond during synthesis and folding of the receptor (in the substituted mutants) compared with reduction of a disulfide bond in a correctly folded WT TRH-R after its insertion into the plasma membrane. Several different roles have been ascribed to the putative disulfide bond between EC loops of GPCRs. It is possible that this disulfide linkage may form during the early stages of receptor synthesis and be necessary for the normal folding and insertion into the membrane of these cell surface proteins. There is, however, no direct data to support this idea and, in particular, the timing of formation of this disulfide bond during synthesis has not been determined in any GPCR. In rhodopsin, the EC disulfide bond appears not to be required for binding the ligand retinal but for the stability of an activated intermediate, metarhodopsin II(4Davidson F.F. Loewen P.C. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4029-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In TRH-R (this paper), the EC disulfide between these conserved Cys residues is necessary to constrain the receptor in a conformation that can attain high affinity binding. By contrast, two other EC disulfide linkages may be used to maintain a high affinity form of β2-adrenergic receptors(10Noda K. Saad Y. Graham R.M. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6743-6752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The conserved EC disulfide bond, however, is not required for full apparent efficacy in GPCRs. In conclusion, we have provided strong evidence for a disulfide bond between the conserved Cys-98 of EC-1 and the conserved Cys-179 of EC-2 in TRH-R and have demonstrated the critical importance of this disulfide link for high affinity binding of TRH. Based on our previous studies showing the binding pocket for TRH to be within the TM bundle (27Perlman J.H. Laakkonen L. Osman R. Gershengorn M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23383-23386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we propose that the extracellular disulfide link is essential for constraining the TM helices of TRH-R in the proper binding conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1991954878,"Bacterial resistance to aminoglycoside-aminocyclitol antibiotics is mediated primarily by covalent modification of the drugs by a variety of enzymes. One such modifying enzyme, the 3′-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, which is produced by Gram-positive cocci such as Enterococcus and Streptococcus inactivates a broad range of aminoglycosides by ATP-dependent phosphorylation of specific hydroxyl residues on the antibiotics. Through the use of dead-end and product inhibitor studies, we present the first detailed examination of the kinetic mechanism for the 3′-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase-IIIa. Initial velocity patterns deduced from steady-state kinetics indicate a sequential mechanism with ordered binding of ATP first followed by aminoglycoside. Dead-end inhibition by AMP and adenylyl-imidodiphosphate is competitive versus ATP and noncompetitive versus kanamycin A. Dead-end inhibition by tobramycin, a kanamycin analogue lacking a 3′-OH, is competitive versus both kanamycin A and uncompetitive versus ATP, indicative of ordered substrate binding where ATP must add prior to aminoglycoside addition. Product inhibition by kanamycin phosphate is noncompetitive versus ATP when kanamycin A is held at subsaturating concentrations (Km(kanA)), whereas no inhibition is observed when the concentration of kanamycin A is held at 10 Km(kanA). This is consistent with kanamycin phosphate being the first product released followed by ADP release. The patterns of inhibition observed support a mechanism where ATP binding precedes aminoglycoside binding followed by a rapid catalytic step. Product release proceeds in an ordered fashion where kanamycin phosphate is released quickly followed by a slow release of ADP. Aminoglycoside substrates, such as kanamycin A, show substrate inhibition that is uncompetitive versus ATP. This indicates binding of the aminoglycosides to the slowly dissociating (E•ADP) complex at high drug concentrations.

These experiments are consistent with a Theorell-Chance kinetic mechanism for 3′-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase-IIIa. The development of antibiotic chemotherapy during the early part of the century has been paralleled by an increase in bacterial resistance to these drugs. Microorganisms have evolved that elude the cytotoxic effect of antibiotics by a variety of means including alteration of targets and chemical modification. The aminoglycoside-aminocyclitol antibiotics are one class of drugs subject to the latter mechanism of resistance. This family of antimicrobial agents includes streptomycin, gentamicin, and kanamycin A as well as many others (Fig. 1)(1Davies J.E. Lorian V. Antibiotics in Laboratory Medicine. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore, MD1991: 691-713Google Scholar). The aminoglycosides can be grouped into three classes: 1) 4,6-disubstituted deoxystreptamine compounds such as kanamycin, 2) 4,5-disubstituted deoxystreptamine aminoglycosides such as paromomycin, and 3) those compounds without a deoxystreptamine ring, which include such drugs as streptomycin. They are used world wide but are subject to a broad spectrum of enzymatic inactivations. Aminoglycosides can be rendered inoffensive to the target bacteria by chemical modification catalyzed by a variety of enzymes including the O-adenyltransferases, the O-phosphotransferases, and the N-acetyltransferases(2Umezawa H. Kondo S. Umezawa H. Hooper I.R. Aminoglycoside Antibiotics. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany1982: 267Google Scholar). The O-phosphotransferases are widely distributed in nature and are comprised of at least 20 different phosphotransferases depending upon the regiospecificity of hydroxyl group modification (for review, see (3Shaw K.J. Rather P.N. Hare R.S. Miller G.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 138-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). One particular phosphotransferase, 3′-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase-IIIa, produced by the opportunistic pathogens Enterococci(4Trieu-Cuot P. Courvalin P. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 23: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) and Staphylococci(5Gray G.S. Fitch W.M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1983; 1: 57-66PubMed Google Scholar), regiospecifically modifies the 3′ position of the 6-aminoglucose ring of kanamycin A and phosphorylates a variety of 4,5-disubstituted deoxystreptamine aminoglycosides as well(6McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Wright G.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6936-6944Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To date, few aminoglycoside modifying enzymes have been subject to extensive kinetic or mechanistic studies. The 3-aminoglycoside acetyltransferase-I was demonstrated to follow a random kinetic mechanism (7Williams J.W. Northrop D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 5902-5907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as was the bifunctional 6′-acetyltransferase 2″-phosphotransferase enzyme(8Martel A. Masson M. Moreau N. Le Goffic F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A third acetyltransferase (AAC(6′)-4) has been established to follow a rapid equilibrium random sequential kinetic mechanism(9Radika K. Northrop D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12543-12546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 2″-aminoglycoside nucleotidyltransferase was shown to inactivate the antibiotics through a Theorell-Chance kinetic mechanism (10Gates C.A. Northrop D.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3826-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) where the release of the nucleotidylated aminoglycoside is the rate-determining step in the reaction. The aminoglycoside phosphotransferases have not been subject to rigorous kinetic analysis with the exception of the 3′-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase-IIIa, where the groundwork has been laid by initial structure-function analysis(6McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Wright G.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6936-6944Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We report herein, through the use of initial velocity studies, dead-end inhibitors, product inhibition patterns, and substrate inhibition, that 3′-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase-IIIa follows an ordered substrate addition and an ordered product release, which limits the rate of reaction and thus supports the occurrence of a Theorell-Chance mechanism. Kanamycin A, tobramycin, amikacin, paromomycin, AMP, ATP, HEPES, and pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase were obtained from Sigma. AMP-PNP ( (1)The abbreviation used is: AMP-PNPadenylyl-imidodiphosphate.) was from Boehringer Mannheim. 3′-Aminoglycoside phosphotransferase-IIIa was purified from Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)/pETSACG1 as described previously(6McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Wright G.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6936-6944Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated kanamycin was purified by modification ( (2)P. R. Thompson and G. D. Wright, unpublished results.) of our previous method(6McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Wright G.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6936-6944Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). adenylyl-imidodiphosphate. Aminoglycoside phosphotransferase-IIIa activity was monitored by coupling the release of ADP to a pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase reaction as described previously(6McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Wright G.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6936-6944Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, kanamycin A was held at 100 μM as the second substrate, and ATP was held at 1 mM as the fixed second substrate. Kinetic data for varied substrate concentrations were fit to and by nonlinear least fit squares using the computer program Grafit (11Leatherbarrow R.J. Grafit. 3.0. Erithacus Software LTD., Staines, United Kingdom1992Google Scholar) v=Vm[S]/(Km+[S])(Eq. 1) v=Vm[S]/(Km+[S](1+[S]/KI))(Eq. 2) where Equation 1 represents simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics and Equation 2 represents substrate inhibition kinetics. Initial velocities were fit to Equation 3 by nonlinear least squares where Kia = k-1/k1 and represents the true dissociation constant of the first substrate in an ordered Bi Bi system. v=Vm[A][B]/(KiaKm(B)+Km(A)[B]+Km(B)[A]+[A][B])(Eq. 3) All inhibition data were fit by nonlinear least squares to as indicated in Table 1.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab v=Vm[S]/(Km(1+I/Kis)+[S])(Eq. 4) v=Vm[S]/(Km+[S](1+I/Kii))(Eq. 5) v=Vm[S]/(Km(1+I/Kis)+[S](1+I/Kii+[S]/KI))(Eq. 6) v=Vm[S]/(Km(1+I/Kis)+[S](1+I/Kii))(Eq. 7) In all equations, v represents a measured velocity, Vm represents the maximal velocity, [S] is the concentration of varied substrate, Km is the Michaelis-Menten constant, I is the inhibitor concentration, Kis is a slope inhibition constant, Kii is an intercept inhibition constant, and KI is the true substrate inhibition constant. Data were obtained in duplicate at high substrate concentrations and at least in triplicate for low substrate concentrations. Each data point was individually fitted to the above equations without further weighting. Errors given for the calculated parameters are standard errors for the best-fit to the equations by nonlinear regression(11Leatherbarrow R.J. Grafit. 3.0. Erithacus Software LTD., Staines, United Kingdom1992Google Scholar). As a first step in the determination of the kinetic mechanism of 3′-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase-IIIa, the velocity of reaction with kanamycin A, a 4,6-disubstituted deoxystreptamine aminoglycoside, was determined at several fixed concentrations of ATP. Double-reciprocal plots of 1/vversus 1/kan A are displayed in Fig. 2. The observed pattern of intersecting lines in these plots is indicative of a sequential rather than a ping-pong mechanism. Paromomycin, a 4,5-disubstituted deoxystreptamine aminoglycoside also exhibits an intersecting pattern of initial velocity plots (data not shown) indicating that 3′-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase-IIIa follows a sequential kinetic mechanism regardless of the class of aminoglycoside substrate analyzed. A Kia value (for ATP) of 26.0 ± 8.4 μM is indistinguishable from the Km(ATP) of 27.7 ± 3.7 μM previously reported (6McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Wright G.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6936-6944Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), consistent with rapid equilibrium binding of ATP(12Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, New York1975Google Scholar). Substrate analogue inhibitors of aminoglycoside (tobramycin) and nucleotide (AMP) were assayed as inhibitors of both substrates in order to elucidate substrate binding order. These results are summarized in Table 1. Tobramycin (no 3′-OH) was found to be a potent competitive inhibitor of kanamycin A with a Kis of 0.58 ± 0.40 μM as well as a competitive inhibitor of amikacin with a Kis of 0.35 ± 0.02 μM. It was also found to be an uncompetitive inhibitor of ATP with a Kii of 0.64 ± 0.02 μM (Fig. 3). AMP was found to be a weak competitive inhibitor of ATP (Table 1; Fig. 4a) with a Kis of 4.9 ± 0.59 mM. It was also found to be a noncompetitive inhibitor of kanamycin A with a Kis of 10 ± 2.4 mM and a Kii of 7.8 ± 0.51 mM (Table 1, Fig. 4b). This is consistent with an ordered Bi Bi substrate addition where ATP is the obligate first substrate followed by aminoglycoside addition. A second nucleotide analogue, AMP-PNP (a nonhydrolyzable ATP isostere) was found to be a competitive inhibitor of ATP (Table 1) with a Kis of 350 ± 50 μM. It was also found to be a noncompetitive inhibitor of amikacin with a Kii of 990 ± 80 μM and a Kis of 1.8 ± 0.74 mM. These results are consistent with inhibition results obtained using AMP and indicate an order of obligate ATP addition first followed by aminoglycoside addition. At high concentrations of aminoglycoside, a decrease in the rate of reaction is observed. This is indicative of nonproductive binding of the drug to a catalytically incompetent form of the enzyme. We initially examined substrate inhibition by paromomycin as it exhibited strong inhibition(6McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Wright G.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6936-6944Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Over a wide range of paromomycin concentrations (2 Km(par) to 75 Km(par)), the family of reciprocal plots shows a decrease in the slopes (Km(ATPapp)/Vm) approaching the normal limit of Km(ATP)/Vm. As the concentration of aminoglycoside continues to increase, the family of plots generated forms a series of parallel lines indicative of uncompetitive inhibition. The slope replot therefore decreases over low concentrations of aminoglycoside reaching a minimum above 10 Km(par) (Fig. 5b; Table 1). Over the same range of paromomycin concentrations, the intercept replot exhibits a typical nonlinear pattern as it approaches a minimum and then increases again (Fig. 5a; Table 1). To more closely examine the nature of the substrate inhibition, a second aminoglycoside substrate, kanamycin A, was chosen as the fixed substrate at several saturating levels. The aminoglycoside in this case was held at saturating levels in order to avoid confusing the replot data with initial velocity effects and to limit the results to substrate inhibition effects. The inhibition is again uncompetitive with a linear intercept replot (Fig. 5c; Table 1), and a standard slope replot (not shown) was associated with linear uncompetitive inhibition. This indicates nonproductive binding of kanamycin to the (E•ADP) complex suggesting at least partial rate-limiting ADP product release. This linear intercept uncompetitive inhibition is observed for both classes of aminoglycoside substrates. Due to the limitations of the coupled assay, which consumes product ADP, only kanamycin phosphate was available for use as a product inhibitor. Kanamycin phosphate was found to be a noncompetitive inhibitor of ATP ([kanamycin A] = Km(kan)) with a Kis of 10 ± 7.1 mM and a Kii of 3.7 ± 0.47 mM (Fig. 6a; Table 1). Inhibition of ATP by kanamycin phosphate was eliminated by increasing the concentration of kanamycin A to 126 μM (10 Km(kan)) (Fig. 6b; Table 1). The results are consistent with a rapid release of the first product, kanamycin phosphate followed by a relatively slow release of ADP as the second product. This is indicative of a Theorell-Chance mechanism, a specialized case of the ordered Bi Bi mechanism. 3′-Aminoglycoside phosphotransferase-IIIa has a broad aminoglycoside substrate range, which makes it amenable to analysis by the alternative substrate method of Radika and Northrop(13Radika K. Northrop D.B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 141: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For a series of both 4,5- and 4,6-disubstituted deoxystreptamine antibiotics, we see kcat vary only 1.1-fold and kcat/Km(ATP) vary 1.4-fold (Table 2). This results in a series of essentially coincident lines in reciprocal plots (not shown) indicative of an ordered sequential mechanism, specifically a Theorell-Chance mechanism where ATP binds first followed by the aminoglycoside.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Determination of the kinetic mechanism of the aminoglycoside detoxifying enzyme, 3′-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase-IIIa required the combination of several techniques. Double-reciprocal plots of initial velocity data have an intersecting pattern of lines indicative of a sequential mechanism and excluding the possibility of a ping-pong mechanism. This intersecting pattern of lines is observed for kanamycin A as well as for paromomycin (4,5-disubstituted aminoglycoside) and amikacin (which shows no substrate inhibition). This demonstrates that the 3′-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase-IIIa follows a sequential mechanism for all classes of aminoglycosides as well as for the “poor” substrate amikacin. A Kia of 26.0 ± 8.4 μM with kanamycin A as the fixed substrate was calculated fitting data to. This value is in agreement with a Km(ATP) of 27.7 ± 3.7 μM reported previously(6McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Wright G.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6936-6944Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This indicates that Km(ATP) = Kia, where Kia = k-1/k1 and Km(ATP) = k3k4/k1(k3+ k4) and suggests that binding of ATP is in rapid equilibrium(12Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, New York1975Google Scholar). Substrate binding order was probed using substrate analogue dead-end inhibitors of both the nucleotide and aminoglycoside substrates. Tobramycin was found to be a potent competitive inhibitor of aminoglycosides and an uncompetitive inhibitor of ATP. The observation of uncompetitive inhibition in a sequential mechanism is diagnostic of an ordered mechanism where ATP binds prior to aminoglycoside binding (inhibitor binding)(14Fromm H.J. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 467-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Both the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue AMP-PNP and AMP were found to be competitive inhibitors of ATP and noncompetitive inhibitors of kanamycin A. These data support an ordered substrate addition where ATP binding is required prior to aminoglycoside binding. Product inhibition studies were initiated to elucidate the order of product release. Given that ADP product release is coupled to pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase for an assay of enzymatic activity, this obviates the use of ADP as a product inhibitor. Kanamycin phosphate, which we generated using purified 3′-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase-IIIa, was therefore analyzed as a product inhibitor of ATP. Initial studies involved holding kanamycin A at subsaturating concentrations (Km(kan A)) while varying ATP. A pattern of noncompetitive inhibition was observed with a Kis of 10 ± 7.1 mM and a Kii of 3.7 ± 0.47 mM. When kanamycin A was held at saturating concentrations (10 Km(kan A)), no inhibition was observed. This pattern of inhibition is consistent with release of kanamycin phosphate first followed by release of ADP. The observed elimination of product inhibition by saturation with kanamycin A excludes a simple ordered Bi Bi kinetic mechanism. It is consistent, however, with a Theorell-Chance mechanism, which is a special case of the ordered Bi Bi mechanism where the central complex (E•ATP•kan ß E•kan-phos•ADP) becomes kinetically insignificant and does not contribute to the rate of reaction as presented in Fig. SI(15Rudolph F.B. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 411-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This mechanism involves a rapid release of kanamycin phosphate followed by a slower rate-limiting release of ADP as the second product. The existence of the ternary complex has been established by initial velocity studies, although its existence is transient and kinetically insignificant, therefore the product inhibition patterns are consistent with a ping-pong mechanism. Also compatible with the existence of a Theorell-Chance mechanism is a 1.15-fold difference in kcat values and a 1.38-fold difference in kcat/Km(ATP) values determined for ATP with several aminoglycoside fixed second substrates (Table 2). This marginal increase in both kcat values and kcat/Km(ATP) values is consistent with a Theorell-Chance mechanism, where the fixed substrate is the second substrate in the binding order(13Radika K. Northrop D.B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 141: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In a double-reciprocal family of plots with ATP as the variable substrate, all plots collapse into a single overlapping line. As presented in Fig. SI, changing the second substrate (i.e. aminoglycoside) would have very little effect upon the overall rate of reaction, given that it is released prior to the proposed rate-limiting segment of the mechanism. As the rate-limiting segment of the reaction is dependent upon the nucleotide substrate, one would expect a more significant kcat and kcat/Km(kan A) effect by using alternative fixed nucleotide substrates other than ATP (13Radika K. Northrop D.B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 141: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This, however, is not possible when using the coupled PK/LDH system. Uncompetitive substrate inhibition (intercept linear) by aminoglycosides versus ATP is indicative of nonproductive binding of the aminoglycoside, at high concentrations, to the (E•ADP) enzyme form following kanamycin phosphate release (Fig. SI). The formation of this (E•ADP•I) complex (where I is the aminoglycoside) must exist given that the nonproductive binding of the aminoglycoside must be isolated from ATP addition by irreversible steps (in order to observe uncompetitive inhibition)(16Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 500-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The release of ADP from the (E•ADP) complex occurs more slowly than the catalytic step and subsequent kanamycin phosphate release. The slow release of ADP allows this form of the enzyme to accumulate, and thus at high kanamycin substrate concentrations the aminoglycoside is able to bind the (E•ADP) complex and partially block ADP release from the (E•ADP•I) complex. At typical intracellular concentration of ATP (3 mM in Salmonella typhimurium(17Bochner B.R. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9759-9769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), the enzyme will be saturated with this first substrate. Upon encountering an aminoglycoside molecule, catalysis occurs, followed by rapid ejection of the inactive phosphorylated drug. The (E•ADP) complex then undergoes slow dissociation to give free enzyme. This suggests then that the enzyme would loose its capacity to protect the cell effectively at high aminoglycoside concentrations. One proposal for explaining the cytotoxic effects of aminoglycosides advanced by Davis (18Davis B.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 341-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that the first step in inhibition of cell growth is the entry of small amounts of aminoglycoside into the cell. Only after intracellular membrane damage occurs will large quantities of drug penetrate the cell. Our observation that the minimal inhibitory concentration of aminoglycosides is positively correlated with kcat/Km(6McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Wright G.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6936-6944Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), ( (3)Others have noted similar effects with other aminoglycoside modifying enzymes, in fact with much more significant correlation coefficients, e.g.(19Radika K. Northrop D.B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1984; 25: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).) the determining rate at low aminoglycoside concentrations indicates that drug inactivation is important at sub-Km concentrations of drug, consistent with our observed mechanism. No correlation with minimal inhibitory concentration is observed with kcat, the rate at infinite concentration of aminoglycoside; this is not surprising as the enzyme shows substrate inhibition at these levels of drug, therefore the capacity to detoxify the agents is in fact decreasing at high levels of drug, and the organism is losing the battle against the antibiotic. Therefore, evolution has provided a catalyst that is suited to the inactivation of low levels of aminoglycoside, consistent with Davis' hypothesis for the mode of action of these antibiotics.

Intravenously administered TFPI is rapidly cleared from circulation predominantly via liver. We previously reported that the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), a multifunctional endocytic receptor, mediates the uptake and degradation of TFPI in hepatoma cells. This process is inhibited by a 39-kDa receptor-associated protein which binds to LRP and regulates its ligand binding activity. However, a distinct, low affinity binding site (perhaps heparin sulfate proteoglycans, HSPGs) on the endothelium and liver is thought to be responsible for the majority of TFPI cell surface binding. In the current study, we investigated the role of LRP and this second binding site in the clearance of 125I-TFPI in vivo using competitors and inhibitors of the receptors. Mice overexpressing the 39-kDa protein via adenoviral-mediated gene transfer displayed diminished plasma clearance of 125I-TFPI. Blockade of cell surface HSPGs sites by incubation with the positively charged molecule, protamine, inhibited 125I-TFPI binding to the hepatoma cells in vitro. In addition, preadministration of protamine in vivo prolonged the plasma clearance of 125I-TFPI in a dose-dependent manner. However, a dramatic increase of the plasma half-life of 125I-TFPI and virtual elimination of 125I-TFPI clearance was observed in mice overexpressing the 39-kDa protein and administered protamine.

Human TFPI is a trace 42-kDa plasma glycoprotein consisting of three tandem Kunitz-type domains, followed by a positively charged carboxyl terminus(1Wun T.-C. Kretzmer K.K. Girard T.J. Miletich J.P. Broze Jr., G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6001-6004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first Kunitz domain binds to and inhibits factor VIIa, and the second Kunitz domain binds to and inhibits factor Xa(2Girard T.J. Warren L.A. Novotny W.F. Likert K.M. Brown S.G. Miletich J.P.

Inhibition of tissue factor-induced blood coagulation by TFPI has been postulated to involve the quaternary factor Xa-TFPI-factor VIIa-tissue factor complex(3Broze Jr., G.J. Semin.

Intravenously administered 125I-TFPI is cleared rapidly from the circulation with a plasma half-life of 2 min in rabbits (4Palmier M.O. Hall L.J. Reisch C.M. Baldwin M.K. Wilson A.G.E. Wun T.C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1992; 68: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and <1 min in rats(5Warshawsky I. Bu G. Mast A. Saffitz J.E. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. Z J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1773-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the biology underlying this clearance mechanism has not been elucidated to date. Previously, we demonstrated that the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) mediates the cellular degradation of TFPI in hepatoma cells (6Warshawsky I. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6664-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and that a 39-kDa protein, an inhibitor of all the ligand interactions with LRP(7Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), inhibits this process. In addition, cell surface heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) associated with endothelial cells and liver have been proposed to play a role in the clearance of 125I-TFPI(8Sandset P.M. Abildgaard U. Larsen M.L. Thromb. Res. 1988; 50: 803-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). However, the precise roles of LRP and HSPGs in the plasma clearance of TFPI have yet to be defined. The purpose of the present study was to elucidate the roles of LRP and HSPGs in the catabolism of TFPI both in vivo and in vitro. We took advantage of viral-mediated gene transfer to express the 39-kDa protein in liver in vivo as such an approach has allowed us to define the role of LRP in the clearance of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) in vivo(9Narita M. Bu G. Herz J. Schwartz A.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1164-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The current results demonstrate a direct role for LRP as well as HSPGs in the plasma clearance of TFPI and thus suggest strategies for regulation of its catabolism.

TFPI was iodinated using IODO-GEN as described previously(10Bu G. Morton P. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15595-15602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specific radioactivities were 5-10 μCi/μg of protein. Purification of the 39-kDa protein following expression in Escherichia coli was carried out as described previously(11Warshawsky I. Bu G. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22046-22054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rat hepatoma MH1C1 cells were cultured as described previously(6Warshawsky I. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6664-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Recombinant adenovirus containing the full-length rat 39-kDa protein cDNA (AdCMV-39-kDa) or the E. coli β-galactosidase cDNA (AdCMV-β-Gal) were prepared and titered as described previously(9Narita M. Bu G. Herz J. Schwartz A.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1164-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The virus titer was approximately 100 virus particles/plaque-forming unit. 125I-TFPI binding to MH1C1 cells was performed at 4°C as described previously(6Warshawsky I. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6664-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of excess unlabeled ligand as specified in the figure legend. In vivo viral delivery was performed via intravenous administration as described previously (9Narita M. Bu G. Herz J. Schwartz A.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1164-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Various viral particle doses were examined. Optimal expression was achieved following administration of 4 × 1011 particles (4 × 109 plaque forming units) of either AdCMV-39-kDa or AdCMV-β-Gal(9Narita M. Bu G. Herz J. Schwartz A.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1164-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed on day 5 following virus delivery, since optimal expression of the 39-kDa protein was at day 4-5 following virus administration(9Narita M. Bu G. Herz J. Schwartz A.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1164-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). 12-16-week-old BALB/c mice (weighing 20-25 g) were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (1 mg/20 g body weight mouse) during the course of the experiment. The indicated radiolabeled protein (34.0 pmol of 125I-TFPI) in sterile saline (total volume 100 μl) was injected into a tail vein over 30 s. In studies in which protamine was administered, the protamine was injected 1 min prior to administration of the radiolabeled TFPI. At the indicated times, 40-50 μl of blood was collected by periorbital bleeding. The amount of 125I-radiolabeled protein in the plasma samples was determined as described previously(12Warshawsky I. Bu G. Schwartz A.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 937-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Generally, at least three mice were independently evaluated for each clearance study, with essentially identical clearance curves within each experimental condition. In vivo plasma clearance of unlabeled TFPI was evaluated in rats in the absence or presence of the recombinant 39-kDa protein as follows(12Warshawsky I. Bu G. Schwartz A.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 937-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). One week before the experiment, PE50 catheters were implanted in the femoral artery and vein of each Sprague-Dawley male rats (weighing 200-250 g). Blood samples (3 ml) were taken for establishing human TFPI/rat plasma standard curves. Rats were anesthetized with 100 mg/kg intraperitoneal of Inactin and placed onto servo-controlled heating pads to maintain body temperature between 37 and 38°C. The trachea was cannulated (PE205) to ensure airway patency. Following surgery, the animal was allowed to equilibrate for 10 min. An intravenous bolus of the 39-kDa protein (50 mg/kg, total volume of 0.5 ml) or a similar volume of vehicle (saline) was injected, followed 1 min later by an intravenous bolus of human TFPI (0.5 mg/kg) in 0.5 ml of 20 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM arginine, pH 7.2. Blood samples were collected at −2, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, and 40 min after injection. Blood was collected via the arterial catheter into tubes containing citrate, mixed, and then centrifuged to obtain plasma. The plasma was stored frozen at −80°C for later analysis. The concentration of TFPI antigen in plasma was measured by a particle concentration fluorescence immunoassay(13Creasey A.A. Chang A.C.K. Feigen L. Wun T.-C. Taylor Jr., F.B. Hinshaw L.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2850-2860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of 125I-TFPI in vivo was determined as follows; 90 min following administration of 125I-TFPI, both plasma and urine samples were collected. The 90-min time point was selected for analysis since preliminary observations demonstrated that degraded 125I-TFPI appeared initially 15 min after injection, increased over time, and peaked at 90 min (data not shown). Undegraded 125I-TFPI in both plasma and urine were precipitated by the addition of bovine serum albumin to 50 mg/ml and thereafter trichloroacetic acid to 20%. Degradation of 125I-TFPI was determined from the trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity following correction for plasma urine volumes. The pharmacokinetic analysis of 125I-TFPI clearance in the presence or absence of various competitors was performed as described previously(9Narita M. Bu G. Herz J. Schwartz A.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1164-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The plasma clearance of 125I-TFPI following intravenous administration of 34 pmol of 125I-TFPI in mice is shown in Fig. 1. The initial plasma half-life of 125I-TFPI was 30 s with <10% of the administered dose remaining in the circulation at 10 min (α phase t1/2~0.3 min, β phase t1/2~11 min). This clearance curve is similar to those described previously following intravenous administration of 125I-TFPI into rabbits(4Palmier M.O. Hall L.J. Reisch C.M. Baldwin M.K. Wilson A.G.E. Wun T.C.

Chem. 1992; 267: 19140-19146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of LRP on 125I-TFPI clearance in vivo, we took advantage of the ability of the 39-kDa protein to inhibit 125I-TFPI interaction with LRP(6Warshawsky I. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6664-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In the current study, we used an adenoviral vector to carry the 39-kDa protein cDNA to be expressed in mouse liver. Overexpression of the 39-kDa protein results in plasma accumulation of the 39-kDa protein. Previously, we demonstrated that mice administered 4 × 1011 particles of AdCMV-39-kDa expressed sufficient 39-kDa protein in plasma to completely inhibit LRP(9Narita M. Bu G. Herz J. Schwartz A.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1164-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and also demonstrated that viral infection induced no gross or microscopic morphological changes in the liver(9Narita M. Bu G. Herz J. Schwartz A.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1164-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This dose of AdCMV-39-kDa was administered intravenously to mice via tail vein. Five days after administration, plasma clearance studies of 125I-TFPI were performed. As seen in Fig. 1, administration of AdCMV-39-kDa altered the plasma clearance of 125I-TFPI: while the α phase t1/2 was essentially unaltered compared to control mice, the β phase t1/2 increased from ~11 min to >100 min. To confirm that the viral infection did not induce adverse effects on the clearance of 125I-TFPI, studies were performed in mice following administration of AdCMV-β-Gal. As seen in Fig. 1, the clearance of 125I-TFPI in AdCMV-β-Gal-infected mice was essentially the same as that of the noninfected mice. Similar results on the clearance of TFPI were obtained in rats using recombinant 39-kDa protein. Rats were injected with a bolus of TFPI (0.5 mg/kg intravenous) without or with preadministration of a bolus of recombinant 39-kDa protein (50 mg/kg intravenous). As shown in Fig. 2, in the absence of the 39-kDa protein, the clearance of intravenously administered TFPI was biphasic with t1/2 values for the α and β phases of 0.8 and 19 min, respectively. Administration of recombinant 39-kDa protein altered the plasma clearance of TFPI resulting in t1/2 values of 0.6 and 30 min for the for the α and β phases, respectively. The effect of recombinant 39-kDa protein on the plasma clearance of TFPI, especially the β phase, is similar to that seen in Fig. 1. Previously, we demonstrated that LRP mediates the cellular degradation of 125I-TFPI in MH1C1 cells in vitro(6Warshawsky I. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6664-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether LRP mediates 125I-TFPI degradation in vivo, 125I-TFPI was administrated to normal mice or to mice previously administered various concentrations of AdCMV-39-kDa. 90 min after injection of 125I-TFPI, plasma and urine were collected and subjected to trichloroacetic acid precipitation for the determination of trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactive material, representing degraded ligand. As shown in Table 1, the degradation of 125I-TFPI was reduced by 50% in mice administered AdCMV-39-kDa compared to controls. These results thus strongly suggest that LRP mediates 125I-TFPI degradation in vivo. However, as noted above, the plasma clearance of 125I-TFPI is not completely inhibited by the 39-kDa protein, consistent with the presence of an additional pathway (see below).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Recent studies have shown that administration of heparin resulted in increased plasma concentrations of TFPI in man (8Sandset P.M. Abildgaard U. Larsen M.L. Thromb. Res. 1988; 50: 803-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) and in rabbit(14Bregengaard C. Nordfang O. Ostergaad P. Petersen J.G.L. Meyn G. Dinnes V. Svendsen O. Hedner U. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This effect has been attributed to release of TFPI from HSPGs or glycosaminoglycan-binding sites along the endothelium and within the liver(5Warshawsky I. Bu G. Mast A. Saffitz J.E. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. Z J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1773-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 8Sandset P.M. Abildgaard U. Larsen M.L. Thromb.

Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Furthermore, administration of protamine following heparin reduced the FPI activity in plasma to the preheparin value, presumably via neutralization of the administered heparin and reexposure of the endothelial/liver sites (18Harenberg J. Siegele M. Dempfle C. Stehle G. Heene D.L. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 942-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments demonstrated that administration of heparin to normal mice 10 min following the administration of 125I-TFPI resulted in a rapid (<1 min) rise in plasma 125I-TFPI to approximately the initial (i.e. zero time) level. This level was maintained for >30 min (data not shown). Similar observations were seen in mice administered AdCMV-39-kDa. We next evaluated the effect of protamine on the clearance of 125I-TFPI in normal mice and AdCMV-39-kDa-injected mice following heparin administration. 100 units of heparin were administered 10 min after the administration of 125I-TFPI. Thereafter 1 min, 1 mg of protamine (a dose which neutralizes 100 units of heparin) was administered. As shown in Fig. 3, upon administration of protamine, there was rapid clearance of 125I-TFPI in normal mice. On the contrary, there was markedly prolonged clearance of 125I-TFPI following protamine administration in AdCMV-39-kDa-injected mice. These results suggest that the protamine not only neutralized the administered heparin but also was associated with additional effects on 125I-TFPI clearance. Previously, we demonstrated that LRP mediates the cellular degradation of TFPI in hepatoma cells(6Warshawsky I. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6664-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). LRP, however, does not appear to be the major cell surface receptor for TFPI, since 125I-TFPI binding at 4°C was not inhibited by the 39-kDa protein(6Warshawsky I. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6664-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This major binding species has been proposed to be HSPGs or glycosaminoglycans, as mentioned above. In order to determine whether these two receptor systems (LRP/HSPGs) function independently, we performed binding experiments with 125I-TFPI on MH1C1 cells in the presence of various competitors for these receptors. Since TFPI is thought to bind to the negatively charged HSPGs via its highly positively charged carboxyl terminus(19Wun T.-C. Blood. 1992; 79: 430-438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and since heparin and other negatively charged molecules inhibit 125I-TFPI binding to MH1C1 cells at 4°C(5Warshawsky I. Bu G. Mast A. Saffitz J.E. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. Z J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1773-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we selected protamine as a potential competitor for HSPGs. As seen in Fig. 4A, binding of 125I-TFPI to MH1C1 cells at 4°C is not altered by the presence of the 39-kDa protein similar to our previous observations(6Warshawsky I. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6664-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, as seen, protamine markedly inhibited 125I-TFPI binding in a dose-dependent manner. Next we evaluated the ability of the 39-kDa protein to affect 125I-TFPI binding in the presence of protamine. As shown in Fig. 4B, in the presence of protamine, the 39-kDa protein inhibited 125I-TFPI binding to MH1C1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, protamine reduced 125I-TFPI binding by ~90% from 800 to 80 fmol/well while the 39-kDa protein reduced binding an additional ~70% (from 80 to 20 fmol/well). This observation is consistent with our earlier estimate that MH1C1 cells express >10 times as many TFPI-binding sites (2 × 106 sites/cell) as LRP-binding sites(6Warshawsky I. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6664-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that a small fraction of 125I-TFPI-binding sites are inhibited by the 39-kDa protein (Fig. 4A), but is below the sensitivity of the assay. To examine whether the mechanisms proposed in vitro are expressed in vivo, we performed clearance studies of 125I-TFPI using various concentrations of protamine as competitors for the HSPGs sites. As seen in Fig. 5, preinjection of various amounts of protamine (0.01, 0.1, and 1 mg) reduced the plasma half-life of 125I-TFPI from less than 1 min to 1-2 min. The fraction of 125I-TFPI remaining in the plasma at 10 min was 3% (no protamine), 5% (0.01 mg), 8% (0.1 mg), and 13% (1 mg), respectively. We next combined the administration of the competitors for these two receptor systems. As seen in Fig. 5, preadministration of protamine (1 mg) to AdCMV-39-kDa-injected mice dramatically prolonged the plasma half-life of 125I-TFPI compared to that observed with either competitor alone (Fig. 1, and 5). The average half-life of 125I-TFPI in these mice was 10 min with >70% remaining in the plasma at 10 min. These results indicate that LRP and HSPGs function independently as clearance receptors for 125I-TFPI in vivo. The present observations demonstrate that 1) inactivation of LRP in vivo by gene transfer of a 39-kDa protein prolongs the plasma half-life of 125I-TFPI, especially the β phase, 2) in vivo degradation of exogenously administered TFPI is inhibited about 50% by inactivation of LRP by the 39-kDa protein, 3) in vitro the 39-kDa protein inhibits the binding of 125I-TFPI to hepatoma cells in a dose-dependent manner under conditions in which 125I-TFPI is unable to bind to HSPGs, 4) blockade of HSPGs by administration of protamine in vivo prolongs the plasma half-life of 125I-TFPI, and 5) a dramatic increase of the plasma half-life of 125I-TFPI is observed in mice overexpressing the 39-kDa protein and administered protamine, a competitor for the HSPGs-binding sites. Taken together, these results indicate that in vivo LRP mediates the degradation of 125I-TFPI and that both LRP and HSPGs are responsible for 125I-TFPI clearance. TFPI is a potent inhibitor of the factor VIIa-tissue factor complex as well as a direct inhibitior of factor Xa. In addition, in animal models TFPI is a potential therapeutic agent in vivo for tissue-thromboplastin-induced intravascular coagulation and prevention of arterial reocclusion after thrombosis(20Day K.C. Hoffman L.C. Palmier M.O. Kretzmer K.K. Huang M.D. Pyla E.Y. Spokas E. Broze Jr., G.J. Warren T.J. Wun T.-C. Blood. 1990; 76: 1538-1545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Haskel E.J. Torr S.R. Day K.C. Palmier M.O. Wun T.-C. Sobel B.E. Abendschein D.R. Circulation. 1991; 84: 821-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Of the many parameters which govern the plasma level of TFPI, its clearance and catabolism play a central role. Elucidation of the molecular basis thereof has recently begun. Using hepatoma cell lines, we reported recently that LRP mediates TFPI degradation(6Warshawsky I. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6664-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The cellular degradation of 125I-TFPI was inhibited >80% both by antibodies directed against LRP and by the LRP-associated 39-kDa protein. LRP, however, does not appear to be the major cell surface receptor for TFPI, since 125I-TFPI binding at 4°C was not inhibited by the 39-kDa protein(6Warshawsky I. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6664-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This major binding species has been proposed to be HSPGs or glycosaminoglycans, as mentioned above. Circumstantial evidence suggests that TFPI may be bound to heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the endothelial or liver cell surface. This hypothesis is based on the observations that (a) TFPI binds to heparin-agarose(22Wesselschmidt R. Likert K. Girald T. Wun T.-C. Broze Jr., G.J. Blood. 1992; 79: 2004-2010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); (b) heparin and sulfated polysaccharides enhance the anticoagulant activity of TFPI(19Wun T.-C. Blood. 1992; 79: 430-438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and (c) after intravenous administration of heparin, plasma levels of TFPI increase severalfold(8Sandset P.M. Abildgaard U. Larsen M.L. Thromb. Res. 1988; 50: 803-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 15Novotony W.F. Palmier M. Wun T.-C. Broze Jr., G.J. Miletich J.P. Blood. 1991; 78: 394-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After the intravenous administration of 125I-TFPI in mice, TFPI was rapidly cleared from the circulation (α phase t1/2~0.3 min, β phase t1/2~11 min). LRP and/or HSPGs are thought to be responsible for this clearance. Administration of 39-kDa protein either directly by injection or via gene delivery as AdCMV-39-kDa altered the clearance of TFPI, especially the β phase (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). However, the effect of 39-kDa protein on TFPI clearance is not as significant as that seen for 125I-t-PA following the 39-kDa administration via infusion (12Warshawsky I. Bu G. Schwartz A.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 937-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) or via AdCMV-39-kDa(9Narita M. Bu G. Herz J. Schwartz A.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1164-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). LRP is responsible for the majority of t-PA clearance (over 50%) (10, see Fig. 1 and Fig. 3), whereas for TFPI, LRP is not the major clearance receptor. This may be because of the difference in the number of total binding sites available to TFPI or other LRP-specific ligands. The observation that MH1C1 hepatoma cells appear to have >10 times as many 125I-TFPI-binding sites (2 × 106 sites/cell) as binding sites for the LRP-specific ligands tissue-type plasminogen activator and α2-macroglobulin (6Warshawsky I. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6664-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) supports this hypothesis. Previously, we have demonstrated that the 39-kDa protein inhibited 125I-TFPI degradation by ~80% in hepatoma cells(5Warshawsky I. Bu G. Mast A. Saffitz J.E. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. Z J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1773-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 6Warshawsky I. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6664-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In the current study, in AdCMV-39-kDa-injected mice, intravenously administered 125I-TFPI degradation was inhibited ~50%. This observation cleary demonstrates that LRP mediates degradation of 125I-TFPI in vivo as well. As expected, 125I-TFPI degradation (i.e. fragment accumulation) was inhibited more significantly in urine than in serum (Table 1). Since the sites of TFPI clearance in vivo are the liver and kidney(4Palmier M.O. Hall L.J. Reisch C.M. Baldwin M.K. Wilson A.G.E. Wun T.C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1992; 68: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 5Warshawsky I. Bu G. Mast A. Saffitz J.E. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. Z J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1773-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the 39-kDa protein may inhibit LRP activity in kidney as well as in liver. Alternatively, kidney gp330, an LRP homolog which is also inhibited by the 39-kDa protein(23Brown M.S. Herz J. Kowal R.C. Goldstein J.L. Curr. Opin. Lipid. 1991; 2: 65-72Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar), may function in TFPI clearance, as well. Previously, we reported that the 39-kDa protein did not inhibit TFPI binding to hepatoma cells(6Warshawsky I. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6664-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, as seen in Fig. 4 in the presence of protamine, which competes for 125I-TFPI binding to cell surface HSPGs, the 39-kDa protein inhibits the binding of 125I-TFPI to MH1C1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The effect of protamine on inhibition of 125I-TFPI binding to MH1C1 cells is nearly saturated at 100 μg/ml of protamine. Under these conditions, binding of 125I-TFPI to MH1C1 cells is approximately 10% as that found without protamine. These results are thus consistent with those above. In addition and consistent with the in vitro results, administration of protamine decreased the plasma half-life of 125I-TFPI in vivo in a dose-dependent manner. In the presence of 1 mg of protamine, a dramatic increase in the plasma half-life of 125I-TFPI (10 min) was observed in mice overexpressing the 39-kDa protein. These results clearly demonstrate that two independent receptor systems are involved in the clearance of 125I-TFPI (one protamine-sensitive, i.e. HSPGs; the other 39-kDa protein-sensitive, i.e. LRP). Furthermore, they demonstrate that while the endothelial/liver cell surface HSPGs-binding sites for TFPI are important in clearance of TFPI from the plasma, this sequestered TFPI is readily releasable and ultimately available back in the plasma.

Here we have investigated the relative contribution of the individual α-subunits constituting functional Kv1.1 potassium channels to α-dendrotoxin binding. Three residues critical for α-dendrotoxin binding and located in the loop between domains S5 and S6 were mutated (A352P, E353S, and Y379H), and multimeric cDNAs were constructed encoding homo- and heterotetrameric channels composed of all possible ratios of wild-type and mutant α-subunits. Complete mutant channels were about 200-fold less sensitive for the α-dendrotoxin block than complete wild-type channels, which is attributable to a smaller association rate. Analysis of the bimolecular reaction between α-dendrotoxin and the different homo- and heteromeric channel constructs revealed that the association rate depends on the number of wild-type α-subunits in the functional channel. Furthermore, we observed a linear relationship between the number of wild-type α-subunits in functional channels and the free energy for α-dendrotoxin binding, providing evidence that all four α-subunits must interact with α-dendrotoxin to produce a high affinity binding site. α-Dendrotoxin, a 59-amino acid basic peptide from the venom of Dendroaspis angusticeps (green mamba snake), potently blocks some but not all voltage-dependent potassium channels.

Potassium channels of vertebrate neurons display a high degree of diversity that contributes to the complexity of function inherent to these cell types(1Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar). In the nervous system, potassium channels are crucial in controlling the resting membrane potential, repolarization of the action potential, and higher neuronal functions such as learning and memory(2Adams P.R. Galvan M. Adv. Neurol. 1986; 44: 137-170PubMed Google Scholar). The specific roles played by individual potassium channel types can be elucidated by taking advantage of differences in voltage-dependence, kinetics, and pharmacological specificity. Venom purification of certain snakes and scorpions has led to the isolation of peptide toxins, including potassium channel toxins, which are both selective and sensitive pharmacological tools to study the bountiful types of potassium channels (for a review, see (3Dreyer F. Rev. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1990; 115: 93-136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). First indications that the venom from the Eastern green mamba Dendroaspis angusticeps contains a peptide toxin which facilitates neuromuscular transmission came from studies of Barret and Harvey(4Barrett J.C. Harvey A.L. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1979; 67: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Separation of the venom into several components resulted in a particular interest of one polypeptide, named dendrotoxin, because it enhanced the quantal acetylcholine release at vertebrate neuromuscular junctions(5Harvey A.L. Karlsson E. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1980; 312: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 6Harvey A.L. Gage P.W. Toxicon. 1981; 19: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The facilitation is most probably the result of high affinity binding to voltage-dependent potassium channels; in mammalian central neurones, dendrotoxin selectively blocks an inactivating voltage-dependent potassium current that corresponds to the 4-aminopyridine-sensitive “A-type” current(7Halliwell J.V. Othman I.B. Pelchan-Matthews A. Dolly O.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), and in mammalian peripheral neurons, dendrotoxin blocks slowly inactivating or noninactivating potassium currents(8Penner, R., Petersen, M., Pierau, F.-K., Dreyer, F., (1986) Pflügers Arch., 407, 365-369.Google Scholar). Dendrotoxin constitutes about 2.5% of the total venom protein and is composed of 59 amino acids with a molecular mass of 7077 Da(5Harvey A.L. Karlsson E. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1980; 312: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 9Joubert F.J. Taljaard N. Hoppe-Seylers Z. Physiol. Chem. 1980; 361: 661-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In 1988, Benishin et al.(10Benishin C.G. Sorensen R.G. Brown W.E. Krueger B.K. Blaustein M.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 152-159PubMed Google Scholar) isolated four different polypeptides from the venom of the green mamba, designated as α-, β-, γ-, and δ-dendrotoxin, and the amino acid composition of these four toxins indicated that α-dendrotoxin is identical to dendrotoxin (called DTX hereafter). 1The abbreviations used are: DTXdendrotoxinWTwild typeMUTmutantCTXcharybdotoxinTEAtetraethylammonium. Two similar polypeptides, called toxin I and K, have also been isolated from the venom of the black mamba Dendroaspis polylepis(11Strydom D.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 69: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), the former blocking rapidly inactivating, voltage-dependent potassium current in the frog node of Ranvier(12Benoit E. Dubois J.-M. Brain Res. 1986; 377: 374-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although all of these toxins have a high degree of sequence homology with several protease inhibitors, such as the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, they do not share the pharmacological properties of protease inhibitors(13Harvey A.L. Karlsson E. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1982; 77: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 14Anderson A.J. Toxicon. 1985; 23: 947-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 15Dreyer F. Penner R. J. Physiol. 1987; 318: 455-463Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, the tertiary structure of DTX is very similar to that of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, with two well defined regions of secondary structure, a double-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and a short α-helical region at the amino terminus(16Huber R. Kukla D. Rühlmann A. Epp O. Formanek H. Naturwissenschaften. 1970; 57: 389-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 17Skarzynski T. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 671-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). DTX is a basic polypeptide with 8 arginine, 6 lysine, 2 aspartate, and 3 glutamate residues. At neutral pH it carries an overall positive charge, but the distribution of the charge is highly asymmetric. All members of the DTX family have 6 conserved cysteines, which might stabilize the structure through the formation of disulfide bonds(18Harvey A.L. Anderson A.J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1985; 31: 33-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). dendrotoxin wild type mutant charybdotoxin tetraethylammonium. Because DTX blocks some but not all potassium conductances with high affinity, it has not only been useful in the pharmacological classification of potassium channels(19Castle N.A. Haylett D.G. Jenkinson D.H. Trends Neurosci. 1989; 12: 59-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), but also in the purification and isolation of potassium channel proteins(20Rehm H. Pelzer S. Cochet C. Chambaz E. Tempel B.L. Trautwein W. Pelzer D. Lazdunski M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6455-6460Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The variation in toxin sensitivity exhibited by the expressed potassium channels cloned from Drosophila(21Tempel B.L. Papazian D.M. Schwarz T.L. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 1987; 237: 770-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) and mammals (22Christie M.J. Adelman J.P. Douglass J. North R.A. Science. 1989; 244: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) has provided the opportunity to correlate primary sequences of potassium channels with toxin sensitivity. Hurst et al.(23Hurst R.S. Busch A.E. Kavanaugh M.P. Osborne P.B. North R.A. Adelman J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 572-576PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that DTX binding occludes the potassium channel pore by binding at or near the external mouth of the Kv1 channel at residues located in the loop between transmembrane domains S5 and S6. In this loop, residues alanine (Ala-352), glutamate (Glu-353), and tyrosine (Tyr-379), of the RBK1 (Kv1.1) channel were capable of influencing DTX blockage of the channel. The same authors also noted that through-space electrostatic forces play a role in DTX binding and concluded that the bound DTX must be stabilized by a number of residue interactions. Given that the core of functional potassium channels is believed to be a tetramer comprising four α-subunits(24Christie M.J. North R.A. Douglass J. Adelman J.P. Neuron. 1990; 2: 405-411Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 25MacKinnon R. Nature. 1991; 350: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 26Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar), a mutation introduced in the cDNA coding for one α-subunit will result in a 4-fold effect at the level of the functional channel itself. When this mutation is critical for DTX binding and given that the toxin interacts with all 4 α-subunits, the macroscopic change in binding affinity will be determined by the presence of these four mutant subunits. So far, however, no data exist wherein the importance of each of the α-subunits for DTX binding is assessed in potassium channels. The present study reports experiments in which concatenated homo- and heteromultimeric RCK1 channel α-subunits, with all possible ratios of wild-type:mutant α-subunits (WT:MUT 4:0, 3:1, 2:2, 1:3, and 0:4), were expressed as functional potassium channels to study the contribution of each subunit to DTX binding and to establish whether all four α-subunits interact simultaneously with DTX. Site-directed mutagenesis on the RCK1 potassium channel (27Baumann A. Grupe A. Achermann A. Pongs O. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2457-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) was performed using the “Transformer” system (Clontech). Mutations were verified by dideoxy DNA sequencing (Sequenase Version 2.0, U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Construction of multimeric potassium channel cDNAs into a high expression vector, pGEM-HE, was as described previously(26Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). For in vitro transcription, plasmids were first linearized with PstI (New England Biolabs) 3′ to the 3′-nontranslated β-globin sequence and then transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase and a cap analogue diguanosine triphosphate (Promega). Stage V-VI Xenopus laevis oocytes were isolated by partial ovariectomy under anesthesia (tricaine, 1 g/liter). Anesthetized animals were then kept on ice during dissection. The oocytes were defolliculated by treatment with 2 mg/ml collagenase (Boehringer Mannheim) in zero calcium ND-96 solution (see “Solutions” below). Between 2 and 24 h after defolliculation, oocytes were injected with 50 nl of 1-100 ng/μl mRNA. The oocytes were then incubated in ND-96 solution at 18°C for 1-4 days. For each channel construct, at least two independent clones were transcribed, injected, and expressed. Whole-cell currents from oocytes were recorded using the two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique. Voltage and current electrodes (0.4-2 megaohms) were filled with 3 M KCl or 1 M K3citrate plus 10 mM KCl. Current records were sampled at 4-ms intervals after low pass filtering at 0.1 kHz. Off-line analysis was performed on an IBM-compatible 80486 computer. Linear components of capacity and leak currents were not subtracted. Capacitative currents did not interfere with steady-state measurements of RCK1 currents, and leak current amplitudes were in the range of only ≈1% of the amplitude of time- and voltage-dependent RCK1 currents. In noninjected or H2O-injected oocytes (n = 20), endogenous currents observed in the tested voltage range amounted to only ≈1% of the amplitude of wild-type and mutant RCK1 currents. All experiments were performed at room temperature (19-23°C) and a constant perfusion rate (2.5 ml/min). Steady-state blockade of the toxin was measured at the end of the test pulses (1 s) at different test potentials by stepping from a holding potential of −90 mV. Fitted Kd values were obtained after calculating the percentage current left over by application of several DTX concentrations in different oocyte experiments (mean ± S.E., n). The ND-96 solution contained (in mM): 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 Hepes, pH 7.5, supplemented with 50 mg/ml gentamycin sulfate (only for incubation). Lyophylized α-dendrotoxin (Alomone Labs) was dissolved in 1 ml (stock of 20 μM) and freshly diluted in the ND-96 solution just prior to (extracellular) bath application. Hurst et al.(23Hurst R.S. Busch A.E. Kavanaugh M.P. Osborne P.B. North R.A. Adelman J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 572-576PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that mutation of 3 residues in DTX-sensitive RBK1 channels, Ala-352, Glu-353, and Tyr-379, to match the equivalent positions in DTX-insensitive RGK5 channels, proline (Pro-374), serine (Ser-375), and histidine (His-401), causes a 150-fold decrease in DTX sensitivity. This provided a molecular explanation for the differences in DTX sensitivity observed among native potassium channels (Fig. 1A). Whether the molecular footprint of DTX binding is mainly determined by the interaction of the toxin with just one, or, in contrast, with all four α-subunits together, was not known. To investigate this we have made the same mutations A352P, E353S, and Y379H in an α-subunit of a RCK1 channel belonging to the Kv1.1 Shaker-type family. Next we constructed concatenated multimeric cDNAs composed of different combinations of WT and MUT α-subunits (Fig. 1B), allowing us to discriminate between two models of binding wherein the toxin either interacts with only one of the four α-subunits, or interacts simultaneously with all four α-subunits (see also below). Functional homo- and heteromeric RCK1 channels composed of all possible ratios of WT and MUT subunits revealed different pharmacological profiles for DTX block. Increasing concentrations of DTX were needed to achieve approximately the same extent of block, as WT subunits were substituted by MUT subunits (Fig. 2A). A constant concentration of 3 nM DTX blocked the currents through WT channels by about 80% and through channels composed of two WT and two MUT subunits by about 20%. The currents generated through complete MUT channels were practically unaffected at this toxin concentration (Fig. 2B). The functional expression of the five different constructs, together with the fact that the mutations did not alter the kinetics, gating and potassium selectivity (Vrev as a function of [K]o not different between WT and mutant, data not shown), allowed us to test two models of DTX binding, one with and one without energy additivity. The model without energy additivity includes the following main features. (i) DTX binds on one of the α-subunits and occludes thereby the pore. (ii) There are four statistically distinguishable configurations available for a bound DTX molecule. (iii) When the channel has four identical subunits, such as the WT and MUT homotetramers, these four configurations will be energetically identical. (iv) When the channel has different sets of subunits, like the heterotetramers, then the interaction energy may be different for each configuration. (v) Channel inhibition can be described by a Langmuir adsorption isotherm. (vi) Kd values for the heterotetrameric channels can be predicted in terms of the observed Kd values of homotetrameric WT and MUT channels, according to Kd=(∑i=141/Ki)-1(Eq. 1) with Ki values as microscopic binding constants. The model with energy additivity is characterized by the following main features. (i) DTX interacts simultaneously with all four α-subunits. (ii) A linear relationship exists between the free energy for DTX binding and the number of WT subunits. (iii) Channel inhibition can be described by a Langmuir adsorption isotherm. (iv) Kd values for heterotetramers channels can again be predicted in terms of the observed Kd values for homotetrameric WT and MUT channels, and is given by KdHETERO=exp{(nWT/4)(lnKdWT-lnKdMUT)+lnKdMUT}(Eq. 2) The model without energy additivity predicts that, as long as at least one WT subunit is present, the channel will principally remain sensitive for DTX block. The model with energy additivity predicts equal spacing for the Kd values on a logarithmic x axis for all the different channel constructs. Fitted Kd values for block by extracellularly applied DTX of homomultimeric WT and MUT channels were 1.1 nM (n = 17 oocytes) and 199.3 nM (n = 25), respectively (Fig. 3A). Fitted Kd values for heteromultimeric channels with 3:1, 2:2, and 1:3 WT:MUT subunits were 5.1 nM (n = 5), 17.6 nM (n = 26), and 84.4 nM (n = 7), respectively. These values correlate very well with the predictions of the model which includes energy additivity, as opposed to the model without energy additivity (Fig. 3B). A summary of the Kd values, as fitted from the observed data and as predicted in models with or without energy additivity, is shown in Fig. 4. The semilogarithmic plot of the Kd values as a function of the number of WT α-subunits reveals a linear relationship, as expected from the equal spacing of the Kd values in Fig. 3B (right plot). The same linear relationship is also found on a linear plot between the free energy for DTX binding and the number of WT subunits (Fig. 4, right ordinate). Comparison between complete WT and complete MUT channels revealed that the mutations, A352P, E353S, and Y379H, result in channels that have a 200-fold decreased sensitivity for DTX, corresponding to a change in binding energy equivalent to more than 3 kcal/mol.Figure 4Kd values and changes in binding energy.

The same extent of current inhibition was observed whether increasing concentrations of DTX were applied sequentially or cumulatively. Furthermore, DTX binding did not alter channel gating; the maximal conductance (gmax) curve in control and 1 nM DTX conditions was characterized by a V1/2 value of −16.0 ± 3.1 mV (n = 10) and −16.5 ± 4.2 mV (n = 8), respectively, which is not significantly different (Fig. 5D). The steady-state inactivation was also not shifted by 1 nM DTX: −27.9 ± 1.4 mV (n = 5) and −28.9 ± 2.8 mV (n = 5) in control and DTX conditions, respectively. The block by DTX occurred rapidly and binding was reversible (Fig. 6A). The rapid onset and offset of the DTX action indicates an extracellular site of action.Figure 6Bimolecular kinetics of DTX inhibition. A, an oocyte expressing WT channels was depolarized to 0 mV for 1 s from a holding potential of −90 mV every 5 s, both in the absence and presence of 3 nM DTX (control, open triangles; wash-in, open triangles plus black bar; wash-out, open circles).

Current inhibition upon DTX application and recovery upon DTX removal followed a single exponential time course compatible with a bimolecular reaction scheme (Fig. 6B; for details, see legend). The effects of increasing DTX concentrations on the kinetics of block on a WT RCK1 channel are shown in Fig. 7A. As required by a bimolecular scheme, the apparent first-order association rate constant (kon) increased linearly with toxin concentration, whereas the first-order dissociation rate constant (koff) remained constant. Fig. 7B summarizes the second-order association rate constants (α) and the first-order dissociation rate constants (β = koff) of all the different channel constructs we have expressed (with ratios WT:MUT α-subunits ranging from 4:0 to 0:4). Gradually exchanging the four WT α-subunits by four MUT α-subunits, resulting in channels which become more and more insensitive for DTX block, can be attributed to a gradual decrease of the association rate constant. In contrast, the β values remain constant for all channel constructs. Dividing the β values by the α values for all the different channel constructs correlates well with the observed Kd values (Fig. 4), which is in accordance with the equation Kd = β/α (Fig. 6B). Next, through-space electrostatic interactions between charged residues in RCK1 and DTX were examined by measuring the effectiveness of DTX to inhibit current in solutions of different ionic strength. For complete WT channels, the fitted Kd was 1.1 nM (n = 17 oocytes) in normal ND-96 solution and 0.64 nM (n = 5) in an iso-osmotic solution containing only 48 mM NaCl (sucrose substitution). For complete MUT channels, the Kd was, respectively, 199.3 nM (n = 25) and 43.6 nM (n = 6). This increase in sensitivity to DTX suggests that through-space electrostatic forces play a role in DTX binding, corroborating the results obtained by Hurst et al.(23Hurst R.S. Busch A.E. Kavanaugh M.P. Osborne P.B. North R.A. Adelman J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 572-576PubMed Google Scholar). This study has identified that all four individual subunits of the RCK1 channel must interact simultaneously with a DTX molecule to produce a high affinity binding site. A similar mechanism of additive contributions from four tyrosine residues (Tyr-449) in the four subunits of Shaker-type channels has also been shown for the external TEA binding(26Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar, 28Heginbotham L. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1992; 8: 483-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The observation that each subunit in a symmetrical tetrameric channel is equally involved in the process of toxin interaction might be difficult to reconcile with the asymmetrical structure of a DTX peptide. However, the following points can be raised in accordance with our observations. If the overall dimensions of the toxin are much smaller than the outer channel vestibule, the binding process may be governed by a single toxin residue, annulling the importance of asymmetry of the peptide and interactions with other channel residues. The observed high affinity binding of DTX results then from the likelihood that a DTX molecule has ideally approached its binding site on the channel, as opposed to the frequent occurrence of collisions without binding (which have very large rate constants) between DTX and the potassium channel due to an inapt surface contact. For charybdotoxin (CTX), Garcia-Calvo et al.(29Garcia-Calvo M. Knaus H.-G. Garcia M.L. Kaczorowski G.J. Kempner E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4718-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) have shown that the target size for the rat brain Kv1.3 CTX receptor is 253 kDa, which is about 4 times the size of a single pore-forming α-subunit of 58 kDa. The target size of 253 kDa implies that the toxin-binding site on Kv1.3 channels is lost as the channel tetramer is destroyed. This indicates a simultaneous interaction of CTX with all four subunits, similar to our results for DTX on Kv1.1 channels. In marked contrast with the foregoing, the CTX-binding site on the maxi-potassium channel activated by calcium seems associated with only a single αβ-subunit complex(29Garcia-Calvo M. Knaus H.-G. Garcia M.L. Kaczorowski G.J. Kempner E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4718-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The finding of energy additivity of the four α-subunits for DTX binding does not allow us to conclude what type of molecular interaction is taking place. The observed free energy of DTX binding can be decomposed into a coulombic and a sterical term. As long as the three-dimensional structure of WT and MUT pore regions is not known, we can merely speculate which of the two terms is determinant. Additionally, interpretations of the free energy of toxin binding may be confounded by unknowable dehydration energies for residues that become dehydrated upon toxin binding, i.e. for toxin or channel residues that are buried in the region of intimate channel-toxin contact(30Stocker M. Miller C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9509-9513Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This is the first report analyzing the contribution of each of the individual α-subunits to the DTX binding site in a functional potassium channel, based on the expression of multimeric cDNAs as opposed to co-injection experiments. Qualitatively, the use of homo- and heteromultimeric cDNA constructs is superior, since each type of tetramer encodes a homogeneous population of channels, at the same time controlling the ratio of WT:MUT monomers in the functional channel (see also (26Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar)). Based on co-injection experiments of WT and MUT Shaker potassium channels, MacKinnon (25MacKinnon R. Nature. 1991; 350: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that the sensitivity for CTX, a 37-amino acid toxin from the scorpion Leiurus quinquestriatus quinquestriatus, depends on the ratio of WT:MUT subunits, and that the channels that include one or more MUT subunits have an intermediate CTX sensitivity, but that the WT CTX-sensitive phenotype is dominant. A recent report by Russel et al.(31Russel S.N. Overturf K.E. Horowitz B. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1729-C1733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), however, suggests also that in heterotetramers from 2 Kv1 class potassium channels (Kv1.2 and Kv1.5), the CTX-insensitive monomer dominates the CTX pharmacology of the channel. From this we conclude that it is unlikely that the mechanism of blockage by DTX and CTX is the same (see also (32Danse J.M. Rowan E.G. Gasparini S. Ducancel F. Vatanpour H. Young L.C. Poorheidari G. Lajeunesse E. Drevet P. Ménez R. Pinkasfeld S. Boulain J.-C. Harvey A.L. Ménez A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar)). The destabilized binding of DTX in MUT channels is expressed in a decreased association rate (α). Together with the finding that the four α-subunits interact simultaneously with a DTX molecule, this means that the mutations are expressed with equal energies in both the bound and transition states. Although multimeric channel constructs have proven very useful in our previous studies (e.g. see (26Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar)), we performed an additional test for the validity of our multimeric constructs by screening the sensitivity of the hybrid channels for block by external TEA. The logarithm of the Kd values of the homo- and heteromultimeric channels varied linearly with the number of WT subunits, indicating that also for the mutants in this study a TEA molecule is energetically stabilized in the pore of the channel by additive contributions from the four α-subunits(26Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar, 28Heginbotham L. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1992; 8: 483-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the currents generated through tetrameric 2:2 WT:MUT cDNA channel constructs were phenotypically indistinguishable from the currents through dimeric WT:MUT channel constructs, including their pharmacological profile. Recombinant toxins and their associated large number of possible mutants constitute important new tools to delineate the site by which toxins recognize their multi-subunit targets. All residues of CTX have already been submitted to individual mutagenesis and it was found that the affinity changed dramatically when mutations were made at eight positions, among which three are positively charged residues, three hydrophobic, and two with hydrogen bonding capacity(33Stampe P. Kolmakova-Partensky L. Miller C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 34Park C.-S. Miller C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7749-7755Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Since CTX competes with TEA and DTX in various assays(3Dreyer F. Rev. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1990; 115: 93-136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it was suggested that positively charged residues on DTX may also govern its binding. It was specifically tempting to anticipate that the lysine triplet (Lys-28, Lys-29, and Lys-30) on DTX may be associated with its specific binding, since residue Lys-27 on CTX appears to be located in the center of symmetry of the Shaker channel, playing a crucial role in blocking its pore(30Stocker M. Miller C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9509-9513Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, using recombinant mutant DTX, Danse et al.(32Danse J.M. Rowan E.G. Gasparini S. Ducancel F. Vatanpour H. Young L.C. Poorheidari G. Lajeunesse E. Drevet P. Ménez R. Pinkasfeld S. Boulain J.-C. Harvey A.L. Ménez A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have provided evidence that the lysine triplet is unlikely to constitute a major element for the functional properties of DTX. Therefore, new DTX mutants are needed to clearly identify the residues by which DTX establishes intimate contact with RCK1 channels."

https://openalex.org/W2126554883,"Trk receptors are a family of genes implicated in the survival, differentiation, and growth of certain neurons and tumors of the nervous system. A better understanding of the regulation of Trk receptors is relevant for developmental and oncological studies. Human neuroblastoma (NB) cell lines constitutively express low levels of TrkA mRNA, while TrkB mRNA is not readily detectable. Differentiation of NB cells is accompanied by a differential modulation of Trk expression in human NB cells. Nanomolar concentrations of RA induce a stable increase of TrkB mRNA. A transient induction of TrkA mRNA levels requires micromolar concentrations of RA. Induction of both TrkA and TrkB mRNA does not require new protein synthesis. However, RA-induced TrkB mRNA expression is transcriptionally regulated, while the transient RA-induced increase of TrkA mRNA is a consequence of extended mRNA stability. Interferon γ (IFN-γ) selectively increases TrkA mRNA without affecting TrkB mRNA levels. Similar to RA, IFN-γ does not modify the transcriptional rate of TrkA mRNA, but rather increases TrkA mRNA stability. Thus, RA and IFN-γ differentially regulate TrkA or TrkB expression in the same cell type by predominantly transcriptional (TrkB) or post transcriptional (TrkA) mechanisms. Such experiments indicate the complexity of Trk mRNA regulation and also indicate compounds that may affect neurotrophin responsiveness in developing neural cells."

We also observed that sustained insulin-like growth factor-1 treatment leads to an increase in GLUT3 mRNA and protein levels(22Klip A. Ramlal T. Bilan P.J. Marette A. Liu Z. Mitsumoto Y. Cell. Signalling. 1993; 5: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). By contrast, prolonged insulin treatment was associated with a small decrease in the levels of GLUT4 protein and mRNA(21Koivisto U.M. Martinez-Valdez H. Bilan P.J. Burdett E. Ramlal T. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2615-2621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar observations on GLUT1 and GLUT4 have been made in 3T3-F442A adipocytes(23Hainque B. Guerre-Millo M. Hainault I. Moustaid N. Wardzala L.J. Lavau M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7982-7986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Despite long standing recognition of the signaling cascades that link the insulin receptor to the nucleus, it remains unknown whether they participate in the insulin-induced regulation of expression of specific genes with the exception of those encoding for transcription factors (24Medema R.H. Wubbots R. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5963-5967Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the role of the signaling cascade, in particular the role of p21ras and pp70 S6 kinase, in the insulin-induced increases in GLUT1 and GLUT3 expression after prolonged (18 h) treatment with the hormone. Using a constructed L6 cell line transfected with a dominant negative Ras, Ras(S17N) under the control of a dexamethasone-inducible promoter(25Skolnik E.Y. Batzer A. Li N. Lee C.H. Lowenstein E.

S. A. 1994; 91: 4441-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), we investigated the roles of p21ras and pp70 S6 kinase in the insulin-mediated regulation of expression of GLUT1 and GLUT3 protein and mRNA.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsPorcine insulin was obtained from Sigma. Rapamycin was purchased from Calbiochem. Polyclonal anti-GLUT1 (RaGLUTRANS) antibody was purchased from East Acres Biologicals (Southbridge, MA). Polyclonal anti-mouse GLUT3 antibody was a kind gift from Dr. I. Simpson (National Institutes of Health). The monoclonal antibody 6H to the α1 subunit of the Na+/K+-ATPase was a kind gift from Dr. M. Caplan (Department of Cellular and Molecular Physiology, Yale University). Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Plasmids containing full-length cDNAs for GLUT1 (prGT4-12) and GLUT3 (pmGLUT3-6) were kindly provided, respectively, by Dr. M. Birnbaum (Department of Cell Biology, Harvard Medical School) and Dr. C. F. Burant (Department of Medicine, University of Chicago).Cell Culture and IncubationsConstruction of the rat L6 skeletal muscle cell line transfected with a plasmid containing Ras(S17N) under a mouse mammary tumor virus promoter inducible by dexamethasone was described previously(25Skolnik E.Y. Batzer A. Li N. Lee C.H. Lowenstein E. Mohammadi M. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Science. 1993; 260: 1953-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Parental cells and cells transfected with Ras(S17N) were maintained in myoblast monolayer culture in α-minimal essential medium containing 2% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 1% (v/v) antibiotic/antimycotic solution (10,000 units/ml penicillin G, 10 mg/ml streptomycin, 25 mg/ml amphotericin B) in 80-cm2 flasks in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C. Cells were maintained in continuous passages (<8) by trypsinization of subconfluent cultures using 0.25% trypsin. For total membrane preparation and RNA isolation, myoblasts were seeded in 10-cm diameter dishes at approximately 4 × 104 cells/cm2. The cells were fed fresh medium every 48 h. Ras(S17N) was induced with 1.5 μM dexamethasone for 24 h before stimulation with 100 nM insulin for 18 h.Total Membrane Preparation and ImmunoblottingTotal membranes of myoblasts were isolated as described previously(20Mitsumoto Y. Burdett E. Grant A. Klip A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 652-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Protein content was determined by the Bio-Rad Bradford procedure(27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar). Membrane samples (50 μg) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels essentially according to Laemmli(28Laemmli K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar). Glucose transporter isoforms and the α1 subunit of the Na+/K+-ATPase were detected by immunoblotting analysis as described previously (20Mitsumoto Y. Burdett E. Grant A. Klip A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 652-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) using specific antibodies to each protein. Antibodies were diluted in 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.04% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% NaN3 (pH 7.5) (anti-GLUT1 polyclonal antibody, 1:2000; anti-GLUT3 polyclonal antibody, 1:500; anti-α1 Na+/K+-ATPase monoclonal antibody, 1:1000) and visualized by 125I-protein A (for polyclonal antibodies) or 125I-sheep anti-mouse IgG (for monoclonal antibody).RNA Isolation and Northern Blot HybridizationTotal RNA was isolated and Northern blots were performed as described previously(21Koivisto U.M.

Lienhard G.E. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2196-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in a solution containing 4% SDS, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 115 mM Tris/HCl (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, 0.25 mg/ml bromphenol blue, protease inhibitors (100 μM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μM E-64, 1 μM pepstatin, and 1 μM leupeptin), and phosphatase inhibitors (40 mM sodium fluoride, 7.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, and 1.5 mM sodium orthovanadate). Lysates were passed five times through a 27-gauge needle to sheer the DNA and boiled for 3 min. A 30-μg sample of total protein from each condition was subjected to SDS-7.5% polyacrylamide gels. MAPK (ERK) phosphorylation was detected by immunoblotting using anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (1:5000 dilution) followed by sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:5000 dilution) and visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence method.Statistical AnalysisAutoradiograms were quantified by laser scanning densitometry using a PDI model DNA 35 scanner with version 1.3 of the discovery series one-dimensional gel analysis software. Statistical analysis was performed using the analysis of variance test (Fisher, multiple comparisons).RESULTSInsulin Stimulation of GLUT1 Expression Is Mediated by pp70 S6 Kinase but Not by p21rasL6 cells transfected with dominant negative Ras(S17N) under the control of a dexamethasone-inducible promoter were treated with/without dexamethasone for 24 h prior to chronic (18 h) exposure to insulin. As shown in Fig. 1A and quantified in Fig. 1B, in the absence of dexamethasone insulin caused a 103% increase in total content of GLUT1 protein above basal levels. Although dexamethasone increased the basal level of GLUT1 protein, insulin still caused a 66% increase in GLUT1 protein above the value in the presence of the glucocorticoid. There was no difference between the net magnitudes of the insulin-induced gains in GLUT1 protein in the presence or absence of dexamethasone; hence the insulin-stimulated increase in GLUT1 glucose transporter is in large part a p21ras-independent event.On the other hand, rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of pp70 S6 kinase, almost completely eliminated the increase in GLUT1 glucose transporter protein in response to insulin (shown in Fig. 1A and quantified in Fig. 1B). This was observed under control conditions (in the absence of dexamethasone) as well as when the dominant negative p21ras was induced (in the presence of dexamethasone). Therefore, the insulin-stimulated increase in GLUT1 protein is a pp70 S6 kinase-dependent event.Parallel results were obtained with GLUT1 mRNA; chronic treatment with insulin resulted in a 101% increase in GLUT1 mRNA above the basal value (mean of four independent experiments). The induction of dominant negative Ras by dexamethasone failed to block the insulin-mediated increase in GLUT1 mRNA. Insulin still caused a 128% increase in GLUT1 mRNA above the value in the presence of dexamethasone (mean of four independent experiments). These results indicate that insulin action on GLUT1 gene expression occurs independently of p21ras.Insulin Stimulation of GLUT3 Expression Is Mediated by p21rasbut Not by pp70 S6 KinaseAs demonstrated in Fig. 2A and quantified in Fig. 2B, insulin caused a 204% elevation in the total content of GLUT3 protein above basal levels. By contrast, when Ras(S17N) was induced by dexamethasone, the ability of insulin to increase GLUT3 protein was almost completely abrogated, suggesting that the insulin-stimulated increase in GLUT3 protein is p21ras-dependent. Moreover, unlike the GLUT1 protein, the level of GLUT3 was not affected by dexamethasone itself as shown in Fig. 2. This further highlights the difference in the regulation of the expression of both proteins.Figure 2Inhibition of insulin-induced elevation in GLUT3 protein by expression of Ras dominant negative but not by rapamycin. A, L6 cells overexpressing Ras(S17N) were treated with or without 1.5 μM dexamethasone (DEX) for 24 h prior to treatment without (basal (B)) or with 100 nM insulin (I) in the presence or absence of 30 ng/ml rapamycin (R) for 18 h. Total membranes were prepared and subjected to immunoblot analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The content of immunoreactive α1 Na+/K+-ATPase subunit is illustrated for assessment of equality of protein loading. This is a representative blot of four independent experiments. B, the results of four independent experiments were densitometrically scanned. The content of GLUT3 protein in basal cells in the absence of dexamethasone was assigned a value of 1.0, and other values were expressed in relative units. Values represent means ± S.E. of four independent experiments. ∗, significance at 95% compared with the basal cells in the absence of dexamethasone.∗∗, significance at 95% compared with rapamycin alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Rapamycin, on the other hand, was without effect on the insulin-stimulated increase in GLUT3 protein. In the absence of dexamethasone, rapamycin did not block the ability of insulin to increase GLUT3 (Fig. 2). Furthermore, rapamycin did not interfere with the ability of Ras(S17N), when induced by dexamethasone, to eliminate the insulin-mediated increase in GLUT3 glucose transporter as shown in Fig. 2. Thus, the insulin-mediated increase in GLUT3 is a pp70 S6 kinase-independent event.Parallel results were obtained for GLUT3 mRNA. GLUT3 mRNA rose by 104% above the basal levels in response to chronic treatment with insulin (mean of four independent experiments). Unlike the effects on GLUT1 mRNA, however, the induction of dominant negative Ras was associated with an insulin-mediated increase in GLUT3 mRNA of only 9% above basal levels (mean of four independent experiments). These results indicate that insulin action on GLUT3 gene expression is a p21ras-dependent event.Effect of Dexamethasone on MAPK Phosphorylation in Parental and Ras(S17N)-transfected L6 CellsTo verify that indeed the presence of dexamethasone induced the expression of Ras(S17N) without having an inhibitory effect of its own, the insulin-induced MAPK phosphorylation was examined in parental and Ras(S17N)-transfected L6 cells in the presence and absence of dexamethasone. As shown in Fig. 3A, dexamethasone did not affect the insulin-induced phosphorylation of MAPK in parental L6 cells. However, the presence of dexamethasone diminished MAPK phosphorylation in Ras(S17N)-overexpressing cells (Fig. 3B).Figure 3Inhibition of insulin-induced phosphorylation of MAPK (ERK) in cells overexpressing Ras(S17N) but not in parental L6 cells. Parental (A) or Ras(S17N)-transfected (B) cells were treated with or without 1.5 μM dexamethasone (DEX) for 24 h, then stimulated with or without 100 nM insulin for 5 min, and lysed, and MAPK phosphorylation was detected in the whole lysates as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This is a representative blot of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effects of Rapamycin and Dexamethasone on the Insulin-mediated Increases in GLUT1 and GLUT3 in Parental L6 CellsIn order to verify that the inhibition of the insulin-induced increase in GLUT1 by rapamycin seen in cells transfected with Ras(S17N) (Fig. 1) was not an artifactual effect due to the process of transfection, a similar set of experiments was performed in parental L6 cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, rapamycin abolished the insulin-induced increase in GLUT1 protein (compare lanes2 and 4 of panelA). Interestingly, the elevation in GLUT1 by dexamethasone alone was also abolished by rapamycin (compare lanes5 and 7 of panelA), an observation also seen in Ras(S17N)-transfected cells. Hence, both insulin- and dexamethasone-induced elevations in GLUT1 protein are pp70 S6 kinase-dependent events.Figure 4Effects of rapamycin and dexamethasone on the insulin-mediated increases in GLUT1 and GLUT3 in parental L6 cells. Parental L6 cells were treated with or without 1.5 μM dexamethasone (DEX) for 24 h prior to treatment without (basal (B)) or with 100 nM insulin (I) in the presence or absence of 30 ng/ml rapamycin (R) for 18 h. Total membranes were prepared and subjected to immunoblot analysis using specific anti-GLUT1 (A) or anti-GLUT3 (B) antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm that the inhibition of the insulin-mediated increase in GLUT3 seen earlier after induction of Ras(S17N) by dexamethasone (Fig. 2) is not due to an inhibitory effect of dexamethasone itself, the elevation in GLUT3 in response to insulin was examined in the presence and absence of dexamethasone in parental L6 cells. As shown in Fig. 4B, dexamethasone had no effect on the insulin-mediated increase in GLUT3 (compare lanes2 and 6 of panelB). Furthermore, rapamycin did not affect the increase in GLUT3 in response to insulin (lane4 of panelB). Hence, insulin action on GLUT3 is indeed a p21ras-dependent and pp70 S6 kinase-independent phenomenon.DISCUSSIONExposure of L6 muscle cells to insulin for several hours increases total levels of both GLUT1 and GLUT3 glucose transporters but has no effect on GLUT4 expression(2Walker P.S. Ramlal T. Sarabia V. Koivisto U.-M. Bilan P.J. Pessin J.E. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1516-1523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Koivisto U.M. Martinez-Valdez H. Bilan P.J. Burdett E. Ramlal T. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2615-2621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we examined the roles of p21ras and pp70 S6 kinase as mediators in the pathway(s) by which insulin elevates GLUT1 and GLUT3 expression, since both p21ras and pp70 S6 kinase appear to mediate communication between the insulin receptor and nuclear events.Ras(S17N) expressed in L6 muscle cells has reduced affinity for GTP and inhibits the activity of endogenous p21ras by interfering with Sos needed for Ras activation(25Skolnik E.Y. Batzer A. Li N. Lee C.H. Lowenstein E. Mohammadi M. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Science. 1993; 260: 1953-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Induction of Ras(S17N) by dexamethasone was also shown to diminish the ability of insulin to stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of MAPK ((25Skolnik E.Y. Batzer A. Li N. Lee C.H. Lowenstein E. Mohammadi M. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Science. 1993; 260: 1953-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) and Fig. 3B). Moreover, dexamethasone itself had no inhibitory effect on the insulin-induced MAPK phosphorylation in parental L6 (Fig. 3A). Hence, L6 cells expressing Ras(S17N) provide a useful system for studying the role of p21ras in insulin signaling.In agreement with the work of others(30Sivitz W.I. Pasley A.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), the use of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone was associated with an increase in total GLUT1 protein in parental (Fig. 4A) and in Ras(S17N)-transfected L6 cells (Fig. 1). However, induction of Ras(S17N) by dexamethasone failed to eliminate the insulin-mediated increase in total GLUT1 protein or mRNA, suggesting that insulin action on GLUT1 gene expression occurs independently of p21ras. The failure of Ras(S17N) to block the insulin-mediated increase in GLUT1 is not a result of a dysfunctional mutation since in the same cells GLUT3 expression was prevented (Fig. 2) and MAPK phosphorylation was diminished (Fig. 3B). In another study, microinjection of dominant inhibitory forms of p21ras or neutralizing antibodies directed against p21ras in 3T3-L1 adipocytes blocked the insulin-induced increase in GLUT1 at the cell surface(31Hausdorff S.F. Frangioni J.V. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21391-21394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, that study did not examine if GLUT1 expression was prevented. Therefore, it is possible that the dominant inhibitory forms of p21ras or the neutralizing antibodies directed against p21ras interfered with the machinery sorting GLUT1, thus preventing it from reaching the cell surface. The disparity between the results of Hausdorff et al.(31Hausdorff S.F. Frangioni J.V. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21391-21394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and those reported here could also be due to the differences between a stable expression and microinjection or to cell type-specific regulation of GLUT1. Indeed, dominant inhibitory mutants of p21ras interfere with the insulin-induced activation of the collagenase promoter in CHO and HeLa cells but not in A14 cells (24Medema R.H. Wubbots R. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5963-5967Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).Supporting the idea of Ras-independent signaling pathways for insulin-induced nuclear events, insulin provoked normal DNA synthesis in CHO cells transfected with mutant mSos protein devoid of the guanine nucleotide exchange activity (CHO-IR/ΔSos cells), yet the insulin-stimulated formation of GTP-bound p21ras and the phosphorylation of MAPK were markedly inhibited(32Sakaue M. Bowtel D. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Moreover, consistent with our results, Kozma et al.(33Kozma L. Baltensperger K. Klarlund J. Porras A. Santos E. Czech M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4460-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) observed that the total amount of GLUT1 protein was similar in parental 3T3-L1 cells and in those expressing an activated mutant N-Ras61k protein. The possible involvement of p21ras in the acute regulation of glucose transport mediated by rapid translocation of glucose transporters to the cell surface remains controversial. Microinjection of activating or inhibitory forms of p21ras had no effect on the rapid action of insulin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes(31Hausdorff S.F. Frangioni J.V. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21391-21394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but introducing p21ras neutralizing antibodies attenuated the rapid effects of the hormone in cardiac myocytes(34Manchester J. Kong X. Lowry O.H. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4644-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).Considering the importance of pp70 S6 kinase in the regulation of protein synthesis(26Jefferies H.B.J. Reinhard C. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4441-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), we asked whether insulin increases GLUT1 protein level in L6 muscle cells by activation of this kinase. The drug rapamycin blocks the activation of pp70 S6 kinase(11Fingar D.C. Hausdorff S.F. Blenis J. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3005-3008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Jefferies H.B.J. Reinhard C. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4441-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), and its effect is selective insofar as it does not block the activation of other kinases such as Raf-1, MAPK, or pp90 S6 kinase(11Fingar D.C. Hausdorff S.F. Blenis J. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3005-3008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Jefferies H.B.J. Reinhard C. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4441-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Indeed, inhibition of pp70 S6 kinase by rapamycin blocked the ability of insulin to increase GLUT1 protein in parental cells (Fig. 4A) and in cells transfected with Ras(S17N) (Fig. 1). Moreover, rapamycin also blocked the dexamethasone-induced elevation in GLUT1 protein in both parental and transfected L6 cells. pp70 S6 kinase has been dissociated from playing a role in the acute translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface by insulin(11Fingar D.C. Hausdorff S.F. Blenis J. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3005-3008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data presented herein demonstrate that pp70 S6 kinase might be a mediator of some of the chronic effects of insulin, such as the stimulation of GLUT1 expression but not of GLUT3. It is also likely that the dexamethasone-induced increase in GLUT1 is a pp70 S6 kinase-dependent event.Information on the regulation of the GLUT3 gene and its protein product remains scarce possibly due to the absence of this glucose transporter from adult human or rodent muscle. In this study we demonstrated for the first time that chronic treatment with insulin, like insulin-like growth factor-1, leads to an increase in GLUT3 protein and mRNA in L6 muscle cells. We also addressed for the first time the mechanism by which the GLUT3 glucose transporter protein increases in response to prolonged exposure to insulin. In contrast to GLUT1, the insulin-induced increases in GLUT3 protein and mRNA were found to be p21ras-dependent. The inhibition of insulin action on GLUT3 after induction of Ras(S17N) by dexamethasone was not due to any inhibitory effects of dexamethasone itself. Dexamethasone did not affect the insulin-induced increase in GLUT3 in parental L6 (Fig. 4B). In addition, rapamycin did not interfere with the ability of insulin to stimulate GLUT3 protein expression in parental (Fig. 4B) or transfected cells (Fig. 2), thus ruling out a role for pp70 S6 kinase in the mechanism by which GLUT3 glucose transporter protein is induced by insulin.In conclusion, signaling for the insulin-dependent synthesis of GLUT1 and GLUT3 glucose transporters occurs through different pathways; expression of the former is governed by pp70 S6 kinase whereas expression of the latter is determined via p21ras. INTRODUCTIONInsulin mediates a wide spectrum of biological responses including stimulation of glucose influx and metabolism in muscle and adipocytes, transport of amino acids, transcription of specific genes and mitogenesis(1Khan C.R.

Like all GTP-binding proteins, p21ras cycles between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound conformations(6Buday L. Downward J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1903-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Ras binds directly to the serine/threonine kinase Raf-1, which in turn phosphorylates and activates MAPK/ERK kinase to phosphorylate and activate MAPK (ERK)(7Pumiglia K. Chow Y.H. Fabian J.

During all stages of their development, L6 cells express the GLUT1 glucose transporter, a ubiquitous isoform that is widely distributed and is believed to provide cells with basal glucose requirements(15Mitsumoto Y.

In contrast, the fat/muscle-specific GLUT4 glucose transporter is not expressed until alignment and onset of cell fusion into myotubes (15Mitsumoto Y. Liu Z. Klip A. Endocr.

Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that in response to chronic treatment with insulin (for several hours), glucose transport activity increases severalfold due to an increase in GLUT1 mRNA and protein levels(2Walker P.S.

We also observed that sustained insulin-like growth factor-1 treatment leads to an increase in GLUT3 mRNA and protein levels(22Klip A. Ramlal T. Bilan P.J. Marette A. Liu Z. Mitsumoto Y. Cell. Signalling. 1993; 5: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). By contrast, prolonged insulin treatment was associated with a small decrease in the levels of GLUT4 protein and mRNA(21Koivisto U.M. Martinez-Valdez H. Bilan P.J. Burdett E. Ramlal T. Klip A. J.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the role of the signaling cascade, in particular the role of p21ras and pp70 S6 kinase, in the insulin-induced increases in GLUT1 and GLUT3 expression after prolonged (18 h) treatment with the hormone. Using a constructed L6 cell line transfected with a dominant negative Ras, Ras(S17N) under the control of a dexamethasone-inducible promoter(25Skolnik E.Y. Batzer A. Li N. Lee C.H. Lowenstein E.

The potential role of this unique sequence in modulating cellular functions was investigated using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)1 cells transiently transfected with cDNAs coding for human integrin β1C or β1 subunits or mutants containing truncated forms of the β1C cytoplasmic domain. A differential effect of β1C and β1 on cell proliferation was observed. Expression of wild type β1 was associated with a 6-10-fold increase in cell proliferation in response to serum, as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation. In contrast, only a 2-fold increase in cell proliferation was observed in transfectants expressing comparable levels of β1C. Cells expressing the β1C mutant truncated at Leu794 and lacking the last 31 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain showed a 12-fold proliferation increase in response to serum. However, three β1C deletion mutants, lacking the COOH-terminal 23, 13, and 8 amino acids, which all contained residues Gln795-Gln802 of the variant cytoplasmic domain responded to serum stimulation with a 2-fold increase in [3H]thymidine uptake. The effect of β1C expression on cell proliferation was not associated with changes in exposure of integrin functional epitopes, as judged by the finding that CHO transfectants expressing β1C, full-length or deletion mutants, or β1 equally adhered to a functionally inhibitory monoclonal antibody against human β1 integrin. Expression of β1C inversely correlated with the mitogenic potential of vascular cells. Absent on growing cultured endothelial cells, surface expression of β1C was induced in growth-arrested, tumor necrosis factor-stimulated endothelial cells. These findings suggest that integrin alternative splicing may provide an accessory mechanism to modulate cell type-specific growth regulatory pathways during vascular cell injury in vivo.

The interactions of cells with extracellular matrix are predominantly regulated by the integrin family of cell surface receptors(1Damsky C.H. Werb Z. Curr. Opin.

Recent studies have also suggested that the β1 subfamily and its cytoplasmic domain participate in the control of cell differentiation (13Stephens L.E. Sonne J.E. Fitzgerald M.L. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1607-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and proliferation. In the latter case, it has been shown that, first, β1-ligation prevents apoptosis(14Boudreau N. Sympson C.J. Werb Z. Bissell M.J. Science. 1995; 267: 891-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar, 15Meredith J.E.J. Fazeli B. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol.

Petersen O.W. Bissell M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1945-1957PubMed Google Scholar) and in other cells (17Ruoslahti E. Reed J.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 477-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar); and finally, domain-swapping of the integrin β1 subunit cytoplasmic domain differentially regulates the effect of fibronectin and of an integrin-activating antibody on cell proliferation(18Pasqualini R. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 447-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We have previously described β1C (formerly β1S), an alternatively spliced form of the ubiquitous integrin β1 (also designated β1A) subunit which contains a unique 48-amino acid sequence in its cytoplasmic domain (19Languino L.R. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7116-7120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and has no homology with β1B cytoplasmic domain(20Altruda F. Cervella P. Tarone G. Botta C. Balzac F. Stefanuto G. Silengo L. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 95: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Based on the hypothesis that variant sequences in the β1 cytoplasmic domain might differentially modulate cell proliferation, we have investigated the ability of the integrin β1C subunit and of β1C deletion mutants, truncated in the cytoplasmic domain, to modulate cell growth. We show here that a unique sequence Gln795-Gln802 in the β1C cytoplasmic domain negatively regulates cell growth and that β1C expression correlates with a growth-arrested phenotype in cytokine-stimulated, vascular endothelial cells. The β1C-specific rabbit sera were generated against keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Calbiochem)-coupled synthetic peptides (805-825, kkSCLSLPSTWDYRVKILFIRVP; 785-808, kkGVQWCDISSLQPLTSRFQQFSCLS) from the deduced sequence of β1C(19Languino L.R.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The anti-β1C sera reacted specifically with the peptide used as antigen and with a recombinant bacterial protein containing the unique β1C cytoplasmic sequence (not shown), but they did not recognize the 765-798 peptide or the recombinant protein generated from the deduced sequence of the wild type β1 cytoplasmic domain. The rabbit antiserum against the cytoplasmic domain of the human β1 subunit (22Bartfeld N.S. Pasquale E.B. Geltosky J.E. Languino L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17270-17276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was a generous gift of Dr. E. Ruoslahti. The following monoclonal antibodies were used: 13 (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA), P4C10 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and DF5 (Chemicon Inc., Temecula, CA) anti-human β1 integrin; 7E2, anti-hamster β1 integrin (a kind gift of Dr. R. L. Juliano) and 1C10, anti-human endothelial cells (Life Technologies, Inc.). The human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) (Clonetics, San Diego, CA), were used at early passages, cultured, and stimulated with tumor necrosis factor α (TNF α, 100 units/ml; Genzyme Corp., Cambridge, MA) for 48 h as described(23Languino L.R.

The Chinese hamster ovary cell line was obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD) and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS). The human β1 cDNA was cloned into the pBJ-1 mammalian expression vector(24Lin A.Y. Devaux B. Green A. Sagerstrom C. Elliott J.F. Davis M.M. Science. 1990; 249: 677-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 25Takada Y. Puzon W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17597-17601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and was provided by Dr. Y. Takada. The cDNA encoding the β1C variant subunit (19Languino L.R. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7116-7120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (provided by Dr. Y. Takada) was generated by subcloning the following cDNAs into XbaI/NotI sites in pBJ-1: the XbaI/HindIII cDNA fragment (2.3 kilobase pairs) that encodes the β1 extracellular and transmembrane (to nt 2357 of the β1 sequence) domains (26Takada Y. Ylanne J. Mandelman D. Puzon W. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 913-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and the HindIII (nt 2358)/EagI fragment (255 base pairs) isolated from PCR-1000 vector (Invitrogen, La Jolla, CA) (19Languino L.R. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7116-7120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that encodes both the cytoplasmic region shared by β1 and β1C and the β1C-specific sequence (116 base pairs). To generate β1C deletion mutants, site directed mutagenesis of the full-length human β1C cDNA in pAlter-1 was carried out using the Altered Sites II system (Promega, Madison, WI). The following synthetic oligonucleotides were used as primers (the replaced nucleotide is underlined) to generate truncated forms of the β1C cytoplasmic domain: β1CΔ794 (nt 2476-2499) 5′-CAGCTCACTGCAACCTCTGACTTC-3′; β1CΔ802 (nt 2501-2520) 5′-AGATTCCAGCAATTCTCCTG-3′; β1CΔ812 (nt 2531-2554) 5′-CCGAGTACCTGGGATTACAGGGTG-3′; β1CΔ817 (nt 2546-2571) 5′-TACAGGGTGAAAATCCTATTTATAAG-3′. These resulting deletion mutants lack, respectively, the last COOH-terminal 31, 23, 13, and 8 amino acids in the β1C cytoplasmic domain (Table 1). The truncated forms of β1C cDNA were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination reaction using Sequenase 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and subcloned in the mammalian expression vector pBJ-1 for CHO cell transfection(27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The deletion mutants β1CΔ794 and Δ812 have been generated by Dr. Y. Takada.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab A cDNA encoding human β1C was subcloned in Bluescript II SK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), in vitro transcribed and translated in the presence of [35S]methionine (1,000 Ci/mmol; DuPont NEN) using the TNT™ coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Luciferase cDNA, provided by the manufacturer, was used as a control. The in vitro translated products were immunoprecipitated as described (22Bartfeld N.S. Pasquale E.B. Geltosky J.E. Languino L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17270-17276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Languino L.R. Gehlsen K.R. Wayner E. Carter W.G. Engvall E. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2455-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) prior to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). HUVEC were surface-iodinated and immunoprecipitated as described(22Bartfeld N.S. Pasquale E.B. Geltosky J.E. Languino L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17270-17276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The following strategy was used to select cell transfectants to be used in proliferation assays. CHO cells were first transiently transfected by electroporation(29Chu G. Hayakawa H. Berg P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 1311-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar), allowed to adhere to tissue culture dishes and after 20 h, serum-starved in DMEM for 48 h. Then, the transfected cells were analyzed by FACS (28Languino L.R. Gehlsen K.R. Wayner E. Carter W.G. Engvall E. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2455-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) using P4C10 or DF5 (not shown) antibody to human β1 integrin, or 1C10, a control antibody (not shown). Positive cells expressing comparable levels of the full-length β1C or β1 or β1C truncated forms were sorted using FACStar or FACS IV (Becton Dickinson). After sorting, the transfectants (6-20 × 103) were resuspended in serum-free medium (30Holmes E. Engvall E. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and added to 96-well microtiter plates (Flow Laboratories Inc., McLean, VA) coated with 10 μg/ml antibody 13 against the human β1 integrin to insure that only cells expressing the exogenous integrin subunit adhered. After 3 h and 30 min at 37°C, the attached CHO cells were used for proliferation assays. In parallel, in each experiment, the number of attached cells was counted using a phase-contrast microscope after fixing and staining the cells with 0.5% Crystal Violet (Sigma)(28Languino L.R. Gehlsen K.R. Wayner E. Carter W.G. Engvall E. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2455-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Transfected cells, attached to plates coated with the antibody 13 (as described above), were either incubated in serum-free DMEM or stimulated using 10% FCS for 18 h at 37°C and then pulsed with 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine/well (5.0 Ci/mmol; Amersham Life Sciences) during the last 3 h of the 18-h culture. The cells were washed and solubilized using 10% SDS in order to quantitate thymidine incorporation by liquid scintillation counting. Background trichloroacetic acid-soluble [3H]thymidine, measured in ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, was approximately 9.0% and was not subtracted from the values shown in this study. In each experiment, duplicate or triplicate observations were performed and the values are reported as mean ± standard error (S.E.). In the proliferation assay, the background was evaluated using mock-transfected cells. The number of mock-transfected cells that adhered to the antibody 13 was negligible and did not result in a detectable increase in [3H]thymidine uptake (371 ± 109 cpm, in the absence of FCS and 512 ± 24 cpm, in the presence of 10% FCS). Group differences were compared using one-way analysis of variance, followed by Bonferroni post hoc contrast. Authenticity of the β1C cDNA construct was first established by in vitro translation and immunoprecipitation. The translated polypeptide, which showed the expected molecular mass of ~100 kDa, was specifically immunoprecipitated by an antiserum against the 785-808 β1C cytoplasmic domain peptide or by P4C10, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the extracellular portion of human β1 integrin (Fig. 1A), but not by an antiserum directed to the wild type β1(A) cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 1A). While genetically engineered cell lines stably expressing the β1C integrin could not be obtained, transient surface expression of β1C was detected in CHO cells (Fig. 1B and not shown). In contrast, both transient (Fig. 1B) and stable (data not shown; (25Takada Y. Puzon W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17597-17601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) transfectants expressing the wild type β1 were obtained. Relatively low levels of β1C and wild type β1 surface expression (Fig. 1B) were reproducibly observed under these experimental conditions. The inability of β1C to be stably expressed in transfected cells prompted additional investigations on the possible regulatory role of this integrin variant in growth inhibition mechanisms. For these studies, CHO cells were transiently transfected with β1, β1C, or β1C deletion mutants lacking the COOH-terminal 31, 23, 13, or 8 amino acids (Table 1). Selection based on flow cytofluorometric sorting with P4C10 antibody against the human β1 extracellular domain allowed us to obtain transfected cells expressing comparable levels of all the integrin variants (Fig. 2, A and B). To further select cells expressing the exogenous integrins, the sorted CHO cells were panned on plates coated with 13, a functionally inhibitory monoclonal antibody to human β1(10Akiyama S.K. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. LaFlamme S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15961-15964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Takada Y. Puzon W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17597-17601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The attached cells were tested in proliferation assays to compare the β1, β1C, or β1C deletion mutant functional activities on cell proliferation. Expression of β1C in CHO cells caused a marked decrease of cell proliferation as measured by [3H]thymidine uptake and as compared with the levels of proliferation of wild type β1 transfectants (Fig. 3A). FACS analysis performed using monoclonal antibody 7E2 (against hamster β1) revealed comparable levels of expression of endogenous hamster β1 integrin in the β1C and β1 transfectants and in mock-transfected CHO cells (data not shown), thus suggesting that the observed effect of β1C on cell proliferation was not due to changes in the endogenous β1 integrin expression pattern. The increase of proliferation of the β1 transfectants varied between 6- and 10-fold (Fig. 3, A and C), and the results were not statistically different from the values of [3H]thymidine uptake measured using mock-transfected CHO cells (1,248 ± 207 cpm, in the absence of FCS and 6,463 ± 245 cpm, in the presence of 10% FCS). In agreement with our observations, stable expression of β1 did not affect the increase of CHO cell proliferation triggered by 10% FCS as compared with mock-transfected cells(18Pasqualini R. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 447-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Expression of β1CΔ802, β1CΔ812, and β1CΔ817 mutants were equally effective in inhibiting cell proliferation (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, CHO cells transfected with β1CΔ794 mutant proliferated in response to serum as efficiently as wild type β1 transfectants (12-fold increase in [3H]thymidine uptake as compared with unstimulated cells; Fig. 3, C and D). The β1CΔ802, β1CΔ812, and the β1CΔ817 transfectants responded to serum stimulation, with only a 2-fold proliferation increase (Fig. 3D).Figure 2CHO cell surface expression of β1C, β1, and β1C deletion mutants. CHO cells were transiently transfected with β1C, β1, β1CΔ794, β1CΔ802, β1CΔ812, or β1CΔ817 cDNAs. After transfection, the cells were starved for 48 h, stained using P4C10 monoclonal antibody to human β1, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, and sorted by FACS to isolate the cells expressing comparable surface levels of β1C, β1, β1CΔ794, β1CΔ802, β1CΔ812, or β1CΔ817. A and B show the profiles of the sorted transfectants from two separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3DNA synthesis of CHO cell transfectants expressing β1C, β1, and β1C deletion mutants. CHO cell transfectants, expressing the full-length β1C or β1 or the truncated β1C forms, were isolated by flow cytometric sorting as in Fig. 2, and then 9,000 (panel A), 12,000 (panel B), or 6,000 (panel C) cells/well were added, in the absence of FCS, to 96-well plates coated with antibody 13 (10 μg/ml). Attached cells were incubated for 15 h at 37°C in the absence or in the presence of 10% FCS and then for 3 h at 37°C with 1 μCi/100 μl/well [3H]thymidine to measure their proliferative response to FCS. A and B show the mean of duplicate observations ± S.E. values of thymidine incorporation in the absence (1, 3, and 5) or in the presence of 10% FCS (2, 4, and 6). C, data are expressed as percent of proliferation of the β1 transfectants. Values indicate [3H]thymidine uptake measurements in the absence (1 and 3) or in the presence of 10% FCS (2 and 4). Results are mean ± S.E. values of triplicate determinations. D, data from two to three different experiments are expressed as -fold increase of proliferation, where the proliferation of serum-deprived cells was normalized to 1. Data are mean ± S.E. Group differences were compared using one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni post hoc contrast. The difference in proliferation between β1CΔ794-CHO cells and either β1CΔ802-CHO, β1CΔ812-CHO cells, or β1CΔ817-CHO cells is statistically significant (p = 0.003; p = 0.004; p = 0.005, respectively). No significant differences were found comparing [3H]thymidine uptake of β1CΔ802-CHO with β1CΔ812-CHO or with β1CΔ817-CHO cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Despite the profound effect on cell proliferation mediated by the various integrin variants, cell adhesion of β1C-CHO transfectants to the functionally inhibitory antibody 13 did not differ from that of the wild type β1-CHO transfectants. In experiments parallel to those shown in Fig. 3A, the transfectants expressing wild type β1, β1C, or β1C deletion constructs were analyzed for their adhesive properties to antibody 13. The number of wild type β1-CHO transfectants, attached to antibody 13-coated plates (3,200 ± 712 cells/well), did not differ from that observed using β1C-CHO (3,920 ± 424 cells/well) or β1CΔ802-CHO transfectants (3,200 ± 480 cells/well). In Fig. 3C, the attached cells were 3,100 ± 172 cells/well for β1-CHO and 4,240 ± 320 cells/well for β1CΔ794-CHO transfectants. Similarly, no differences were observed comparing the remaining mutants (not shown). These findings suggest that expression of the variant β1C cytoplasmic domain does not affect ligand recognition and/or adhesive properties mediated by the intact heterodimeric receptor. It is unlikely that the association of β1C with various α subunits plays a role in the observed effect since previous studies have demonstrated that cytoplasmic domains do not regulate the αβ pairing specificities, which appears to be controlled by extracellular determinants(31Solowska J. Edelman J.M. Albelda S.M. Buck C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that expression of the integrin β1C subunit exerts a negative regulatory function on CHO cell proliferation, and that this effect appears to be restricted to residues 795-802 in the variant cytoplasmic domain. Although we might speculate that the Gln795-Gln802 region may play a direct role in the interaction with as yet unidentified intracellular ligand(s), other mechanisms, including secondary structure and conformational remodeling, cannot be presently excluded. We have here described for the first time a role for the sequence Gln795-Gln802 in mediating β1C effect on cell proliferation. Recent studies have highlighted a role for β1C in negatively regulating cell cycle progression in late G1, when β1C cDNA was microinjected in model 10T1/2 fibroblasts(32Meredith Jr., J. Takada Y. Fornaro M. Languino L.R. Schwartz M.A. Science. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In that study, using a different cell type and experimental system, a role for only the extreme 13 carboxyl-terminal amino acids was shown in the inhibitory effect of cell cycle progression. This may be a consequence of the normal (33Reznikoff C.A. Brankow D.W. Heidelberger C. Cancer Res. 1973; 33: 3231-3238PubMed Google Scholar) as opposed to the tumorigenic CHO (34Esko J.D. Rostand K.S. Weinke J.L. Science. 1988; 241: 1092-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) cell phenotypes used in the two studies. Furthermore, in the present study, direct ligand engagement of β1 integrin by the functionally blocking antibody 13 in the absence of serum and/or matrix deposited by the cells might have unmasked a highly selective role for the Gln795-Gln802 sequence in regulating cell growth. In order to explore a potential pathophysiological role for β1C in regulation of cell growth, endothelial cells were stimulated with inflammatory cytokines to induce a growth-arrested phenotype(35Stolpen A.H. Guinan E.C. Fiers W. Pober J.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1986; 123: 16-24PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with previous observations demonstrating absence of β1C transcript in growing endothelium(19Languino L.R. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7116-7120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an antiserum specific for β1C did not immunoprecipitate any labeled polypeptide from surface-iodinated HUVEC (Fig. 4). In contrast, immunoprecipitation studies from TNF α-stimulated HUVEC revealed detectable surface levels of β1C integrin (Fig. 4). In parallel experiments, immunohistochemical staining with the antiserum to β1C characterized in Fig. 1, demonstrated prominent expression in severely injured and growth-impaired liver tissue.2 Combined with the data presented above, we speculate that during inflammatory responses associated with prominent cytokine release, preferential expression of β1C by the injured cells may contribute to a low or non-proliferative phenotype that may impair tissue repair and compromise its regenerative response(s).

https://openalex.org/W2019201285,"The proteinase mPC1, a neuroendocrine member of the mammalian family of subtilisin-like enzymes, has previously been shown to be converted to a carboxyl-terminally truncated 66-kDa form during transport through the secretory pathway. The cleavage site and the function of this carboxyl-terminal truncation event are unknown. We have performed site-directed mutagenesis of two paired basic sites in the mPC1 carboxyl-terminal tail and expressed these constructs in PC12 cells, a rat pheochromocytoma known to lack endogenous PC1. We found that the most likely site for the truncation event was at Arg590-Arg591 since mutation of this site to Lys-His prevented processing of 87-kDa PC1. A PC1 mutant carboxyl-terminally truncated at this site and expressed in PC12 cells was efficiently routed to the secretory pathway and stored in secretory granules, indicating that the carboxyl-terminal extension is not required for sorting of this enzyme. The function of the various PC1 constructs was assessed by analyzing proneurotensin cleavage to various forms. The carboxyl-terminally truncated PC1 mutant was found to perform most of the cleavages of this precursor as well as wild-type PC1; however, the blockade mutant processed proneurotensin much less efficiently.

Differences between the site preferences of the various enzymes were noted. Our results support the notion that carboxyl-terminal processing of PC1 serves to regulate PC1 activity. We have shown previously that in AtT-20 cells, constitutively released PC1 is present mostly in the 87-kDa form, while PC1 (also known as PC3) released through stimulation predominantly consists of a carboxyl-terminally truncated, 66-kDa protein (Vindrola and Lindberg, 1992). This difference indicates that carboxyl-terminal processing of 87-kDa PC1 probably largely occurs within regulated secretory vesicles. Recent studies employing temperature block, brefeldin A, and determination of oligosaccharide maturation have supported the idea that PC1 is carboxyl-terminally cleaved within the post-trans-Golgi network compartments in the regulated secretory pathway (Benjannet et al., 1992; Lindberg, 1994; Milgram and Mains, 1994; Zhou and Mains, 1994a). Through purification and characterization of recombinant PC1, we have demonstrated that both the 87-and the 74/66-kDa forms of PC1 are enzymatically active (Zhou and Lindberg, 1994). The conversion from 87-kDa PC1 to the 74/66-kDa forms not only increases specific activity while decreasing overall stability, it also narrows the pH optimum, increases calcium-dependence, and alters susceptibility to certain proteinase inhibitors (Zhou and Lindberg, 1994). Thus, we speculate that proteolytic processing of PC1 may play an important role in the regulation of PC1 enzymatic activity in vivo. The carboxyl-terminal segment may also be involved in the targeting and sorting of PC1 to secretory vesicles. In the experiments described here, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to study the biosynthetic processing, sorting, and function of the various domains of PC1 in PC12 cells.

The mutation at Arg590-Arg591 of mPC1 was carried out using the Muta-Gene™ in vitro mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad). A mutagenesis primer, 5′-CTT TTC CAC TCC GTG CTT GTC ATT CTG GAC TG-3′, was synthesized by LSUMC Core Laboratories. Single-strand DNA was prepared as described by Ausubel et al.(1987). The mutation in mPC1591BL/CMV was confirmed by DNA sequencing using a DNA Sequenase™ version 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The mutations at Arg627-Arg628 and Gly592 were performed using a PCR mutagenesis method. Primers XBAI-3 (5′-CAC AAC AAC TCT AGA CCC AGG AAC-3′) and BSTXI-5 (5′-TAA ATG CCA AAG CTC TGG TGG-3′) were synthesized to match the sequences of mPC1 cDNA at bp 1405-1426 or 2392-2415 (with a mutation switching CG to TA at 2404 bp to introduce an XbaI cleavage site). Two pairs of mutagenesis primers were synthesized to introduce mutations at Arg627-Arg628 or at Gly592. These primers were 628BL-5 (5′-GCA-ATG-TGG-AGG-GTA-AAG CGG ATG AGC AGG TAC-3′), 628BL-3 (5′-GTA CCTGCT CAT CCG CTT TAC CCT CCA CAT TGC-3′), 591ST-5 (5′CCA GAA TGA CAG GAG ATA AGT GGA AAA GAT GGT G-3′), and 591ST-3 (5′-CAC CAT CTT TTC CAC TTA TCT CCT GTC ATT CTG G-3′). The mPC1/CMV and mPC1591BL/CMV vectors were transfected into JM101 Escherichia coli, then were amplified and purified using a Wizard™ Miniprep DNA purification system (Promega, Madison, WI). About 2 μg of mPC1/CMV DNA were digested with 1.5 μl of XbaI (30 units, New England Biolabs) in a 20-μl volume at 37°C for 1.5 h; after heating at 70°C for 10 min, 15 μl of this reaction mixture was further digested with 1.5 μl of BstXI (15 units, New England Biolabs) in a 30-μl volume at 55°C for 1.5 h. The reaction products were separated on 1% agarose; a 6800-bp cDNA fragment was recovered and extracted from the agarose gel using a Geneclean II kit (Bio 101, Inc.). This cDNA was used as the vector in the following ligation reaction. Using 0.5 μg of mPC1/CMV or mPC1591BL/CMV DNA as template, three separate PCR reactions were carried out. The BSTXI-5 and 591ST-3 (or 628 BL-3) were used as PCR primers in the first reaction, while 591ST-5 (or 628BL-5) and XBAI-3 were used in the second reaction. After 10 cycles of amplification, the products were separated from template and primers on 1.5% agarose gel; the major DNA product of each PCR reaction was recovered and extracted from an agarose gel using a Geneclean II kit. In the third PCR reaction, the major products of the first two reactions were mixed and annealed to generate a template, and BSTXI-5 and XBAI-3 were used as PCR primers. The amplification was performed for 15 cycles, and the product (1005 bp) was separated from template and primers on a 1% agarose gel and DNA recovered using a Geneclean II kit. The product of the third PCR was digested using BstXI and XbaI as described above; the largest product was separated from small DNA segments using the Geneclean II kit. In order to ligate the PCR products into the digested vector (6800 bp), 60 ng of vector DNA was mixed with half of the PCR product and 1 μl (400 units) T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) in a 20-μl final volume for 45 min at room temperature. The ligation mixture was then transformed into Ultracomp™ INVαF‘ cells (Invitrogen). To confirm the mutations and accuracy of PCR amplification, the 1005-bp PCR product region was sequenced using a DNA Sequenase™ version 2.0 kit with three different sequencing primers. Plasmids of correctly mutated mPC1SB/CMV (Arg627-Arg628→ Lys-Ala), mPC1DB/CMV (Arg590-Arg591→ Lys-His and Arg627-Arg628→ Lys-Ala), and mPC1ST/CMV (truncation at Gly592) were then amplified in E. coli (XL1 Blue; Stratagene) and purified using a Qiagen plasmid kit. PC12 cells, obtained from Drs. L. Elferink and R. Scheller (Stanford University), were grown in DMEM-high glucose (4.5 g/L) medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% heat-inactivated horse serum on collagen-coated plates. PC12 cells expressing wild-type mPC1 have been described previously (Lindberg et al., 1994). Mutated PC1 forms were transfected into PC12 cells using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The day prior to transfection, 1-2 million PC12 cells were subcultured on 10-cm plates. The next day, after the cells were well attached, the plates were rinsed twice with prewarmed serum-free DMEM-high glucose medium. A 30-μl aliquot of Lipofectin was placed into 3 ml of serum-free medium in a sterile 15-ml tube with 30 μg of DNA from mPC1SB/CMV, mPC1DB/CMV, or mPC1ST/CMV, and kept for 10 min at room temperature. Experimental plates were incubated with 3 ml of medium containing Lipofectin/DNA, while the control plate was incubated with Lipofectin only. The medium was replaced with regular medium containing 300 μg/ml G418 after 5 h of incubation at 37°C. Transfected cells produced colonies after approximately 3 weeks. The colonies were then subcloned using the agarose method described by Lindberg and Zhou(1995), and the cell lines producing the highest quantities of PC1 proteins were selected by immunoblotting 12-24 cell extracts with PC1 amino-terminal antiserum (Vindrola and Lindberg, 1992). PC12 cells stably transfected with mPC1s were cultured in medium containing 300 μg/ml G418 in collagen-coated 35-mm plates. After the cells reached about 70-80% confluence, the synthesis of proneurotensin was induced using medium containing 1 μM forskolin, 1 μM dexamethasone, 100 ng/ml nerve growth factor, and 10 mM LiCl (Rovere et al., 1993). The plates were maintained in inducing medium in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C for 48 h. In stimulation experiments, two 35-mm wells of induced PC12 cells were each washed twice with 5 ml of prewarmed PBS. To one plate was added 1 ml of Earle's balanced salt solution (prepared as described by Lindberg et al.(1994)), while to the other plate was added 1 ml of Earle's balanced salt solution containing 50 mM KCl (and lacking a corresponding concentration of NaCl). The plates were incubated for 40 min at 37°C and the conditioned media were collected on ice, centrifuged at low speed to remove any floating cells, and then concentrated to 80 μl using a Microcon 10 device (Amicon) prior to the addition of 10 μl of 10 × Laemmli sample buffer (Laemmli, 1970). For cell extraction, the cells in each 35-mm well were washed twice in 5 ml of prewarmed PBS and homogenized in 300 μl of ice-cold Laemmli sample buffer. All samples were boiled for 5 min. Aliquots (70 μl) of each sample were subjected to Western blotting for PC1 as described previously. PC12 cells expressing wild-type and mutated forms of PC1 were grown in collagen-coated 35-mm wells in six-well plates to 80% confluence. The cells were rinsed and incubated in 1 ml of Met/Cys-free DMEM at for 30 min at 37°C, then labeled for 20 min at 37°C in 1 ml of Met/Cys-free DMEM containing 0.5 mCi of [35S]Pro-Mix (Amersham Corp.). They were then chased in 1 ml of regular DMEM with 2% fetal bovine serum for various periods of time as indicated. The cells and the conditioned media were transferred into ice-cold Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatants were saved, and the pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of boiling buffer containing 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1% SDS, and 50 mM β-mercaptoethanol (Milgram and Mains, 1994). Both conditioned media and cell extracts were boiled for 5 min. One ml of AG buffer (Vindrola and Lindberg, 1992) was added to cell extracts (in 100 μl of boiling buffer), and the solution was centrifuged to remove any pellet. Aliquots (1 ml) of each sample were subjected to immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE analysis, and autoradiography as described previously (Vindrola and Lindberg, 1992). Pulse-chase experiments were repeated three times. The ability of transfected mPC1s to process endogenous prohormone was assessed by measuring the various forms of mature and unprocessed neurotensin-derived peptides in PC12 cell extracts. PC12 cells were cultured and induced in 10-cm plates as described above. After 48 h of induction, the cells were washed three times with 10 ml of Dulbecco's PBS, placed on ice, scraped into 1 ml of ice-cold 0.1 N HCl, and stored frozen at −70°C. Upon thawing, the samples were vortexed to produce a homogeneous suspension. A 100-μl aliquot of cell extract was removed for protein determination and Western blotting of mPC1 (Fig. 2). The remainder was centrifuged on a microcentrifuge for 5 min, and the supernatant was removed and lyophilized. For the experiment shown in Fig. 5, the cell pellet obtained after removal of the HCl was solubilized in various amounts (between 0.3 and 0.6 ml) of Laemmli sample buffer containing 5 M urea to obtain a constant protein concentration of 3 mg/ml. Fifty μl of each sample were subjected to Western blotting using the amino-terminal PC1 antiserum and the blot subjected to video densitometry for quantitation of the amount of immunoreactive PC1 in each dish. Proteins remaining in the gel following blotting were stained with Coomassie Blue; this procedure verified that the lanes had indeed been equally loaded with protein.Figure 5Analysis of proneurotensin processing in PC12 cells expressing various forms of PC1. Products of proneurotensin processing were detected by radioimmunoassay using specific radioimmunoassays directed against the epitopes indicated. A schematic diagram of proneurotensin is shown in panel a. Within each cell line, the percentage of each particular processing product is shown in panel b as a percentage of total proneurotensin.

Neurotensin is located near the COOH terminus of the precursor and is flanked by two Lys-Arg sequences at positions 148-149 and 163-164. Neurotensin is preceded by a neuromedin N sequence located between Lys140-Arg141 and Lys148-Arg149. A fourth Lys-Arg sequence occurs near the middle of the precursor at position 85-86. This doublet and the one at the NH2 terminus of neuromedin N delimit a 53-residue peptide, which starts with a neuromedin N-like sequence (Lys-Leu-Pro-Leu-Val-Leu, designated K6L) and ends with an acidic sequence (Glu-Lys-Glu-Glu-Val-Ile, designated E6I). The specificities of the neurotensin, neuromedin N, E6I, and K6L antisera used here have been described previously in detail (Bidard et al., 1993; Rovere et al., 1993). Briefly, the neurotensin and E6I antisera react with the free COOH termini, while the neuromedin N and K6L antisera recognize the free NH2 termini, of their respective antigens. These antisera cross-react poorly (<1%) with antigenic sequences that are internal to proneurotensin or proneurotensin fragments. Thus, the neurotensin antiserum will detect all precursor products with a COOH-terminal neurotensin sequence (including authentic neurotensin). Similarly, the E6I antiserum will measure all the precursor forms ending with the E6I sequence, while the neuromedin N and K6L antiserum will assay the precursor products bearing NH2-terminal neuromedin N and K6L sequences, respectively. The radioimmunoassay and reverse-phase HPLC procedures employed here to quantitate the various proneurotensin-derived peptides have been fully described elsewhere (Bidard et al., 1993; Rovere et al., 1993). All cell extracts were directly assayed for their content in immunoreactive neurotensin (iNT), E6I (iE6I), and K6L (iK6L). Because of the above-described antisera specificity, the iNT, iE6I, and iK6L assays measure the amounts of precursor products that are processed at the Lys163-Arg164, Lys140-Arg141, and Lys84-Arg85 sequences, respectively. Portions of the cell extracts were submitted to Arg-directed tryptic digestion (Bidard et al., 1993; Rovere et al., 1993) and then assayed for immunoreactive K6L. The value of CTiK6L thus obtained provides an index of the total amount of proneurotensin (either processed or unprocessed) that was synthesized and stored in the cells during the induction period. The remainder of the trypsin-treated samples was applied to reverse-phase HPLC, and the fractions were assayed for their immunoreactive neuromedin N (iNN) content. Previous studies have shown that trypsin-generated iNN can be resolved by HPLC into two peaks, one comigrating with synthetic neuromedin N and the other with neuromedin N bearing a COOH-terminal Lys-Arg extension (Bidard et al., 1993; Rovere et al., 1993). The latter peptide is produced by Arg-directed tryptic digestion of precursor forms in which the neuromedin N sequence is internal, whereas the former is generated by cleavage of peptides that end with a COOH-terminal neuromedin N sequence. Thus, the post-HPLC assay of trypsin-generated neuromedin N provides a measurement of all the precursor products that are processed at the Lys148-Arg149 sequence (including authentic neuromedin N). The results were normalized for the amount of protein in each extract. The percentages of cleavage at the Lys163-Arg164, Lys148-Arg149, Lys140-Arg141, and Lys84-Arg85 sequences were calculated by dividing, respectively, iNT, trypsin-generated neuromedin N, iE6I, and iK6L by CTiK6L and by multiplying these ratio values by 100. Duplicate independent samples were analyzed on two separate occasions. It has been documented that four paired basic residues exist within the mPC1 carboxyl-terminal region, however, only Arg590-Arg591 and Arg627-Arg628 are conserved across human, mouse, rat, and anglerfish PC1 (Seidah et al., 1991, 1992; Smeekens et al., 1991; Bloomquist et al., 1991; Roth et al., 1993). If 87-kDa PC1 is indeed cleaved at these two sites, the larger products should approximate 62 and 70 kDa, respectively; these molecular masses are close to the sizes of the PC1 forms obtained by spontaneous cleavage of 87-kDa PC1 (66 and 74 kDa; Zhou and Lindberg(1994)). Therefore, we theorized that these two sites could represent the cleavage sites for PC1 carboxyl-terminal processing. To test this hypothesis, site-directed mutagenesis reactions were carried out to convert Arg627-Arg628 to Lys-Ala or Arg590-Arg591 to Lys-His and Arg627-Arg628 to Lys-Ala, generating mPC1SB (single blockade at Arg627-Arg628) and mPC1DB (double blockade at both sites). A site-directed mutation to replace Gly592 with a stop codon was also performed to generate mPC1ST, the carboxyl-terminally truncated form of PC1. These mutations are diagrammed in Fig. 1. In order to determine the effect of the mutations at the mPC1 carboxyl-terminal region, the carboxyl-terminal processing of wild-type mPC1 and the mutated forms (mPC1SB, mPC1DB, and mPC1ST) were studied in PC12 cells stably transfected with the various constructs. Western blotting using PC1 amino-terminal antiserum revealed that wild-type mPC1 and mPC1SB were largely converted to a 66-kDa form, while the majority of mPC1DB still remained as 87-kDa PC1 (Fig. 2), suggesting that mutation at Arg590-Arg591 (but not mutation at Arg627-Arg628) could effectively block PC1 carboxyl-terminal conversion. Western blotting also showed that mPC1ST (truncated at residues 592) exhibited a molecular mass identical to that of the 66-kDa PC1, and this form did not undergo any further carboxyl-terminal cleavage. Following stimulation of PC12 cells with 50 mM KCl, wild-type mPC1 as well as mPC1DB and mPC1ST could be released from regulated secretory pathway (Fig. 3). These data indicate that neither deletion of the carboxyl-terminal region (residues 592 to 726) nor mutations at Arg590-Arg591 and Arg627-Arg628 could block PC1 targeting into the regulated secretory pathway. It was noted that a small portion of mPC1DB was still cleaved, but that the cleavage product possessed a molecular mass slightly larger than that of cleaved wild-type mPC1, indicative of the involvement of an alternative cleavage site. In pulse-chase labeling experiments, we found that amino-terminal conversions of pro-mPC1DB and pro-mPC1ST were completed within the first 20 min of synthesis, similar to wild-type pro-mPC1 (data not shown). This result indicates that substitution of Arg590-Arg591 and Arg627-Arg628 or deletion of the PC1 carboxyl-terminal region (residues 592-726) apparently had little effect on proPC1 conversion. During the later stages of biosynthesis, intracellular 87-kDa mPC1DB remained intact after a 4-h chase period, while wild-type PC1 was converted to the 66-kDa form (Fig. 4). Constitutive secretion of the 87-kDa form of both mPC1DB and wild-type PC1 occurred within 1 h after the pulse period (Fig. 4). Similar studies of the mPC1ST mutant demonstrated efficient synthesis of a 66-kDa form of PC1 and constitutive secretion into the medium over the same time period (results not shown). PC12 cells are known to greatly increase their synthesis of proneurotensin under inducing conditions (Rovere et al., 1993). We have shown previously that transfection of mPC1 into PC12 cells can promote proneurotensin processing (Lindberg et al., 1994). To determine the physiological function of the mutated mPC1DB and mPC1ST, we compared the maturation of proneurotensin synthesized in PC12 cells transfected with the mutated mPC1DB and mPC1ST with that in PC12 cells expressing wild-type mPC1 and untransfected PC12 cells. It should be noted that the various cell lines expressed varying amounts of mPC1, with the double blockade mutant (mPC1DB) exhibiting the highest expression, and mPC1ST exhibiting the lowest. The relative amounts of PC1 in the cells used for this experiment were estimated by Western blotting a constant amount of protein from each dish used for neurotensin analysis and performing video densitometry of the blot. The ratios of the amount of mutant mPC1 (all forms) to wild-type mPC1 were approximately 0.3 (mPC1ST) and 9 (mPC1DB). As expected, untransfected PC12 cells exhibited no PC1 immunoreactivity. The amount of proneurotensin (processed and unprocessed) stored in the various cell lines during the induction period ranged between approximately 10 and 30 pmol/mg protein (CTiK6L values are given in the legend to Fig. 5). Similarly to wild-type mPC1, mPC1DB and mPC1ST both possessed the ability to process proneurotensin (Fig. 5). All forms of PC1 markedly increased proneurotensin cleavage at the Lys140-Arg141 and Lys148-Arg149 dibasic sites as compared to the control (Fig. 5b). They also cleaved, though less efficiently, the Lys84-Arg85 site. This cleavage event was not observed in control PC12 cells. Only mPC1 and mPC1ST were able to increase processing at the Lys163-Arg164 site above the level seen in the control, whereas mPC1DB appeared inactive in that respect. In general, and especially given the fact that it had the highest level of expression, mPC1DB was much less efficient in processing proneurotensin than mPC1 and mPC1ST. Interestingly, mPC1ST, the enzyme expressed at the lowest level, was the most active in processing the Lys163-Arg164 site, in contrast to mPC1DB which apparently did not cleave this dibasic despite its high level of expression. Thus, there appear to be certain differences in proneurotensin processing efficiency and site usage between the 66- and 87-kDa PC1 forms. PC1 is known to be cleaved within its carboxyl-terminal region at a late stage of its biosynthesis (Vindrola and Lindberg, 1992). Previous work has suggested that an autocatalytic mechanism may be involved in this process (Zhou and Lindberg, 1994); however, the site of this carboxyl-terminal cleavage event has not yet been identified. In this work, we have assumed that this cleavage occurs at a paired basic site, since these are known to represent consensus sequences for PC1 cleavage. Four paired basic residues are located in the mPC1 carboxyl-terminal region; cleavage at these sites can generate products with estimated molecular masses between 62 and 73 kDa. However, among these sites, only Arg590-Arg591 and Arg627-Arg628 are conserved among the PC1 sequences of human, rat, mouse, and anglerfish (Seidah et al., 1991, 1992; Smeekens et al., 1991; Bloomquist et al., 1991; Roth et al., 1993); thus, these two sites were thought to represent likely candidate sites for PC1 carboxyl-terminal cleavage. By performing site-directed mutagenesis at these two sites, we found that mutation of Arg627-Arg628 alone had little effect on the generation of the 66-kDa form, while mutations of both Arg590-Arg591 and Arg627-Arg628 were able to block the conversion of 87-kDa PC1 to the 66-kDa form. Furthermore, mPC1ST (truncation at Gly592) exhibited a molecular mass on SDS-PAGE identical to that of endogenous 66-kDa PC1 converted from the 87-kDa wild-type mPC1. Subsequent to the generation of our mutants, the sequence of Aplysia PC1 was published (Chun et al., 1994); PC1a from this species contains the first of these dibasics, but not the second. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that Arg590-Arg591 is the major cleavage site for the generation of 66-kDa PC1 in vivo. Since wild-type PC12 cells possess a regulated secretory pathway, but lack the ability to process prohormones at paired basic residues, PC1 cleavage at Arg590-Arg591 within PC12 cells is likely to be attributable to an autocatalytic mechanism. This interpretation is supported by our in vitro work (Zhou and Lindberg, 1994) and in vivo results obtained in AtT-20 cells, which indicate that overexpression of PC1 results in increased COOH-terminal proteolytic processing (Zhou and Mains, 1994a). The presence of an intermediate form of PC1 of approximately 74 kDa has been observed in in vitro studies (Zhou and Lindberg, 1994); however, little 74-kDa mPC1 is found in PC12 cells (this study) or in AtT-20 cells (Vindrola and Lindberg, 1992; Milgram and Mains, 1994). Taken together with the finding of lesser effects of the mutation of Arg627-Arg628 in PC12 cells, these results suggest that 74-kDa PC1 may represent a minor product during the carboxyl-terminal processing of PC1 in vivo. A possible explanation for these differences is that the cleavage site generating the 74-kDa form is blocked in vivo, possibly due to an association of PC1 carboxyl-terminal region with membrane or with other proteins. The association of PC1 with membranes and association with other granule proteins have both been reported (Vindrola and Lindberg, 1992; Palmer and Christie, 1992). Although mutation at Arg590-Arg591 and Arg627-Arg628 substantially blocked PC1 carboxyl-terminal conversion, a small portion of 87-kDa mPC1DB was still cleaved. The product was slightly larger than wild-type 66-kDa PC1 on SDS-PAGE, suggesting that an alternative cleavage site is involved. Through limited digestion using chymotrypsin, trypsin, and subtilisin, which possess different substrate specificities, we found that all three proteinases were able to convert 87-kDa recombinant PC1 to 66- and 74-kDa-like products in its carboxyl-terminal region (Zhou and Lindberg, 1994). These results suggest that the cleavage site in the PC1 carboxyl terminus is located in an exposed region which can readily be attacked. Therefore, the alternative cleavage site usage in PC12 cells may be due to the action of other proteinases located in the regulated secretory pathway. Alternatively, PC1 itself may also act at alternative cleavage sites. This idea is supported by our in vitro studies that demonstrate spontaneous carboxyl-terminal cleavage of 87-kDa mPC1DB purified from Chinese hamster ovary cells amplified for the production of this protein (results not shown). A possible alternative cleavage site for transfected mPC1 may be Lys602-Arg603, although this site is present only in mouse PC1. Cleavage at the Lys602-Arg603 site can generate a product 12 amino acids longer than the product cleaved at Arg590-Arg591 (66-kDa PC1); this molecular mass is also consistent with our observed molecular masses on SDS-PAGE. Construction of a PC1 vector encoding a further mutation at Lys602-Arg603 will be required to investigate this possibility. Carboxyl-terminal conversion of PC1 occurs mainly in regulated secretory granules, as evidenced by previous studies in AtT-20 and PC12 cells (Vindrola and Lindberg, 1992; Benjannet et al., 1992; Lindberg et al., 1994; Lindberg, 1994; Milgram and Mains, 1994; Zhou and Mains, 1994a). However, the functional significance of this conversion event is not clear. The activation of proPC1 occurs within the endoplasmic reticulum (Lindberg, 1994; Milgram and Mains, 1994; Goodman and Gorman, 1994), while peptide hormone precursors are thought to be cleaved within the later stages of the secretory pathway (reviewed by Loh et al.(1992)). It may thus be necessary for the cell to regulate PC1 function during intracellular transport. The decreasing pH gradient from the endoplasmic reticulum to the secretory granules may represent one important aspect of this regulation. The pH within the trans-Golgi network and regulated secretory granules corresponds well with the optimal pH of PC1 activity, between 5.0 and 6.5 (Zhou and Lindberg, 1993; Jean et al., 1993; Rufaut et al., 1993). On the other hand, since the timing and location of PC1 carboxyl-terminal processing coincide with the timing and location of prohormone processing, truncation of PC1 may also play a role in the regulation of enzyme activity. In vitro studies have shown that that carboxyl-terminal cleavage of PC1 dramatically increases PC1 activity against peptide and prohormone substrates (Zhou and Lindberg, 1994), suggesting that carboxyl-terminal cleavage of PC1 could potentially possess physiological significance. In order to determine the function of the PC1 carboxyl-terminal region in vivo we compared the processing of proneurotensin in PC12 cells stably transfected with wild-type mPC1, mutated mPC1DB, or mPC1ST. In contrast to AtT-20 cells, PC12 cells do not express prohormone convertases; thus, neurotensin is stored mainly in precursor form (Carraway et al., 1993; Rovere et al., 1993). When the varying expression levels are taken into account, the 66-kDa form of PC1 was found to be the most active against proneurotensin, especially relative to the 87-kDa blockade mutant, which was expressed at much higher levels. The comparatively low activity of mPC1DB against proneurotensin confirms our previous in vitro results, which indicate that the 87-kDa PC1 represents only a partially active PC1 form (Zhou and Lindberg, 1994); removal of the carboxyl-terminal region appears to be required to fully activate PC1. The finding that the various forms of PC1 are differentially active against proneurotensin supports our in vitro results showing that the 87- and 74/66-kDa recombinant PC1s exhibit differing specific activities (Zhou and Lindberg, 1994). A recent study has also demonstrated that expression of carboxyl-terminally truncated PC1 (StopD616) in AtT-20 cells increases the rate of conversion of proopiomelanocortin (Zhou and Mains, 1994b). Based on these in vivo and in vitro observations, we speculate that carboxyl-terminal processing of PC1 during transport through the secretory pathway may control the amount of PC1 activity available for the processing of prohormones. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that PC1 carboxyl-terminal conversion largely occurs at Arg590-Arg591 site through a possible autocatalytic mechanism; the PC1 carboxyl-terminal domain (Gly592 to Asn726) is required neither for activation nor for intracellular transport of PC1 to secretory granules. However, removal of this domain appears to increase total PC1 activity and alters cleavage site preference. In line with our previous in vitro data, these results support the idea that carboxyl-terminal processing is important for the regulation of PC1 function. We are grateful to L. Elferink and R.

RET/ptc2 is the product of a papillary thyroid carcinoma translocation event between the genes coding for c-ret and the type Iα regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (RIα) (Lanzi, C., Borrello, M., Bongarzone, I., Migliazza, A., Fusco, A., Grieco, M., Santoro, M., Gambetta, R., Zunino, F., Della Porta, G., and Pierotti, M.(1992) Oncogene 7, 2189-2194). The resulting 596-residue protein contains the first two-thirds of RIα and the entire tyrosine kinase domain of c-ret (RETtk). An in vivo assay of growth stimulatory effects was developed, which consisted of microinjecting a RET/ptc2 expression plasmid into the nuclei of 10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts and observing the incorporation of 5-bromodeoxyuridine. This assay was used to determine that only the dimerization domain of RIα fused to RETtk is required for RET/ptc2's mitogenic activity. In addition, all of the reported Hirschsprung's disease point mutations in the RETtk (S289P, R421Q, and R496G) inactivate RET/ptc2 in our assay, confirming that these are loss of function mutations. Two tyrosines outside the conserved kinase core were also identified that are essential for full mitogenic activity of RET/ptc2.

https://openalex.org/W2135312572,"Regulation of the ATPase activity of smooth and non-muscle myosin II involves reversible phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain (RLC). The RLC from skeletal muscle myosin (skRLC) is unable to confer regulation (myosin is locked in an inactive state) to smooth muscle myosin when substituted for the endogenous smooth RLC (smRLC). Studies of chimeric light chains comprised of the N- or C-terminal half of each skRLC and smRLC suggest that the structural basis for the loss of this regulation is within the C-terminal half of the RLC (Trybus, K. M., and Chatman, T. A.(1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 4412-4419). The purpose of this study is to delineate the structural elements within the C-terminal half of the smRLC that are absent in the skRLC and are necessary for regulation. By sequence comparison, six residues, Arg-103, Arg-123, Met-129, Gly-130, Arg-143, and Arg-160, which are conserved in regulated myosin RLCs but missing in nonregulated myosin RLCs, were identified in smRLC. To test whether these amino acids provide the missing structural elements necessary for phosphorylation-mediated regulation, a skRLC was engineered that replaced the corresponding skRLC amino acids (positions 100, 120, 126, 127, 140, and 157, respectively) with their smRLC counterparts. Using a newly developed RLC exchange procedure, the purified mutant protein was evaluated for its ability to regulate chicken gizzard smooth muscle myosin. Substitution of the six conserved amino acids into the skRLC completely restored phosphorylation-mediated regulation. Thus, a subset of these amino acids, including four basic arginine residues located in the E, F, G, and H helices which are missing in skRLC, may be the structural coordinates for the phosphorylserine in the N terminus. Based on this result, the regulation of glycogen phosphorylase is discussed as a model for the regulation of smooth muscle myosin. Regulation of the ATPase activity of smooth and non-muscle myosin II involves reversible phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain (RLC). The RLC from skeletal muscle myosin (skRLC) is unable to confer regulation (myosin is locked in an inactive state) to smooth muscle myosin when substituted for the endogenous smooth RLC (smRLC). Studies of chimeric light chains comprised of the N- or C-terminal half of each skRLC and smRLC suggest that the structural basis for the loss of this regulation is within the C-terminal half of the RLC (Trybus, K. M., and Chatman, T. A.(1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 4412-4419). The purpose of this study is to delineate the structural elements within the C-terminal half of the smRLC that are absent in the skRLC and are necessary for regulation. By sequence comparison, six residues, Arg-103, Arg-123, Met-129, Gly-130, Arg-143, and Arg-160, which are conserved in regulated myosin RLCs but missing in nonregulated myosin RLCs, were identified in smRLC. To test whether these amino acids provide the missing structural elements necessary for phosphorylation-mediated regulation, a skRLC was engineered that replaced the corresponding skRLC amino acids (positions 100, 120, 126, 127, 140, and 157, respectively) with their smRLC counterparts. Using a newly developed RLC exchange procedure, the purified mutant protein was evaluated for its ability to regulate chicken gizzard smooth muscle myosin. Substitution of the six conserved amino acids into the skRLC completely restored phosphorylation-mediated regulation. Thus, a subset of these amino acids, including four basic arginine residues located in the E, F, G, and H helices which are missing in skRLC, may be the structural coordinates for the phosphorylserine in the N terminus. Based on this result, the regulation of glycogen phosphorylase is discussed as a model for the regulation of smooth muscle myosin. INTRODUCTIONUnlike striated muscle, the initiation of smooth muscle contraction must be preceded by serine phosphorylation of the myosin RLC 1The abbreviations used are: RLCregulatory light chain of myosinsmRLCRLC from smooth muscle myosinskRLCRLC from skeletal muscle myosinTFPtrifluoperazine. which is accomplished by a calcium/calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase in the presence of ATP(1Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1985; 25: 593-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the RLC is also reversibly phosphorylated in vertebrate striated muscle (at a homologous serine), this phosphorylation simply modulates contractile activity(2Sweeney H.L. Bowman B.F. Stull J.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1085-C1095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The loss of myosin regulation in striated muscle is due to undetermined alterations in the myosin heavy chain. Additionally, the smooth muscle and skeletal muscle RLCs are not functionally equivalent, even though the RLCs from skeletal muscle and smooth muscle are highly homologous (71% similarity and 53% identity in sequence). The RLC from skeletal muscle myosin (skRLC) is unable to confer regulation to smooth muscle myosin (a phosphorylation-regulated myosin) and locks the myosin in the “off” state when substituted for the endogenous smooth muscle RLC (smRLC)(3Trybus K.M. Chatman T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4412-4419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the smRLC can confer calcium sensitivity to scallop muscle myosin (a Ca2+-regulated myosin), while the skRLC fails to do so(4Chantler P.D. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 473-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, no RLC can inhibit the activity of vertebrate skeletal muscle myosin.The fact that the skeletal muscle RLC has retained the structural elements to lock a phosphorylation-regulated myosin (smooth muscle myosin) into an inactive state that is not activated via RLC phosphorylation, presents an opportunity to use directed mutagenesis to gain insight into the mechanism of phosphorylation-dependent regulation. In the best understood example of phosphorylation-dependent enzyme regulation, that of glycogen phosphorylase(5Sprang S.R. Acharya K.R. Goldsmith E.J. Stuart D.I. Varvill K. Fletterick R.J. Madsen N.B. Johnson L.N. Nature. 1988; 336: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), loss of ability to activate enzyme activity via phosphorylation could be achieved by loss of the two arginine residues that coordinate the phosphoserine. The purpose of this study was to ascertain if the loss of function of the skRLC could be restored by insertion of arginine residues that may function in a putative coordination of the phosphoserine.The phosphorylated serine residue is near the N terminus of the RLC. Studies of chimeric RLCs comprised of the N- or C-terminal half of each skRLC and smRLC indicate that it is the C-terminal half of skRLC that lacks structural elements necessary for phosphorylation-mediated regulation(3Trybus K.M. Chatman T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4412-4419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By sequence comparison (Fig. 1A), four arginine residues (Arg-103, Arg-123, Arg-143, and Arg-160; corresponding to amino acids 100, 120, 140, and 157, respectively, in the rabbit skRLC sequence) are present in the C-terminal half of the smRLC which are conserved in regulated myosin RLCs but missing in nonregulated myosin RLCs. The four arginines are located in four different domains (the E, F, G, and H helices, using calmodulin nomenclature for the helices(6Kretsinger R.H. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 8: 119-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar); Fig. 1B), as revealed in the crystal structures of chicken skeletal myosin S1 (7Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1859) Google Scholar) and the scallop myosin regulatory domain(8Xie X. Harrison D.H. Schlichting I. Sweet R.M. Kalabokis V.N. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Nature. 1994; 368: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In addition to these arginines, the C terminus of the skRLC was examined for other missing conserved amino acids. A striking substitution was for glycine 130 and methionine 129 (amino acids 127 and 126, respectively, in the rabbit skRLC) in the loop between the F and G helices, which is absolutely conserved in regulated myosins (Fig. 1A). The location of this glycine in the loop between two helices may confer flexibility that is necessary for the helices to translate relative to each other upon phosphorylation. (This glycine provides a different function in Ca2+ regulation in scallop muscle(8Xie X. Harrison D.H. Schlichting I. Sweet R.M. Kalabokis V.N. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Nature. 1994; 368: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar)). A functional role in regulation for a subset of the missing arginine residues and for interhelical flexibility is postulated by analogy to the case of glycogen phosphorylase, wherein coordination of the phosphoserine is by arginines residing in different helices. Global rearrangement of helices is associated with the coordination of the phosphoserine.To test whether all or a subset of the substituted amino acids (Arg-103, Arg-123, Met-129, Gly-130, Arg-143, and Arg-160) are structural elements necessary for conferring phosphorylation-mediated regulation to the RLC (via phosphorylation of serine 15), a skRLC was engineered that replaced the six altered skRLC residues with their smRLC counterparts (creating Arg-100, Arg-120, Met-126, Gly-127, Arg-140, and Arg-157 in the skRLC). Regulation was assayed following exchange of the mutant skRLC into chicken gizzard smooth muscle myosin.MATERIALS AND METHODSPreparation of ProteinsDephosphorylated smooth muscle myosin was purified from either 35-70% or 40-60% ammonium sulfate fraction of chicken gizzard smooth muscle actomyosin as essentially described by Chacko et al.(9Chacko S. Conti M.A. Adelstein R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) and Sellers et al.(10Sellers J.R. Pato M.D. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 13137-13142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Skeletal myosin light chain kinase and calmodulin were kindly provided by Dr. James Stull. The wild type rabbit fast skeletal muscle RLC and the wild type chicken smooth muscle RLC were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as for the mutant skeletal muscle RLC.Site-directed MutagenesisOligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis was employed to generate the skRLC mutant listed in Fig. 1A. Rabbit skRLC cDNA containing the entire coding region of the RLC was subcloned into M13mp19. The mutations were made on single-stranded DNA isolated from this subclone by a method improved from that of Kunkel(11Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4886) Google Scholar), using Bio-Rad Muta-Gene M13 in Vitro Mutagenesis kit.Expression and Purification of Wild Type and Mutant RLCsThe wild type and mutated cDNA containing the entire coding region of the skRLC were cut out of the M13 vectors and inserted into pT7-7 expression vectors. Wild type and mutant RLCs were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) after isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside induction. The expression and purification procedures were essentially the same as described previously(12Sweeney H.L. Yang Z. Zhi G. Stull J.T. Trybus K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1490-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), except that the solubilized RLC proteins were purified by ion exchange chromatography on a DEAE-cellulose column (Whatman DE52).Exchange of Wild Type and Mutant RLCs into Smooth Muscle MyosinBy using trifluoperazine (TFP), based on a RLC exchange and extraction procedure for skeletal muscle, a technique was developed that achieves a complete exchange of wild type and mutant skRLC into chicken smooth muscle myosin without elevating temperature (see Fig. 2). Chicken gizzard smooth muscle myosin was first incubated in an exchange solution containing 500 mM KCl, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM CDTA, 5 mM ATP, 20 mM imidazole, 5 mM TFP, 0.05% Triton X-100, pH 7.0, in the presence of a 10 molar excess of the RLC to be exchanged. The exchange took place on ice with occasional shaking for 1.5 h. The myosin was then precipitated by adding 10 volumes of cold distilled H2O and pelleted by centrifugation at 4°C. The pelleted myosin was dissolved in the exchange solution with a lowered (1.5 mM) TFP concentration in the presence of a 10 molar excess of the RLC to be exchanged and left on ice for another 1.5 h. The MgCl2 concentration was then increased to 15 mM. The exchanged myosin was precipitated with cold distilled H2O and pelleted by centrifugation. The extent of exchange was analyzed by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis.Figure 2Extent of exchange of mutant skRLC into gizzard smooth muscle myosin as assessed by 12% SDS-PAGE.

The phosphorylation reaction was terminated by adding 1 mM EGTA to inhibit myosin llight chain kinase. Under these conditions, the RLC was completely phosphorylated, as assessed by isoelectric focusing(10Sellers J.R. Pato M.D. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 13137-13142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).ATPase AssaysMgATPase activities of the wild type or mutant RLC-reconstituted chicken gizzard myosin were assayed under the following conditions: 30 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, 0.1 mM EGTA, 15 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 30-120 μg/ml myosin at 25°C. Actin-activated MgATPase activities were assayed under the same conditions in the presence of 150-600 μg/ml actin purified from skeletal muscle. Actin-activated ATPase activities were calculated by subtracting the ATPase activities of myosin alone from the total actin-activated activity. Aliquots were removed at multiple time points to ascertain the linearity of phosphate release. Inorganic phosphate release was determined by a Malachite green-based colorimetric method, modified from published methods (13Henkel R.D. VandeBerg J.L. Walsh R.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 169: 312-318Google Scholar, 14Geladopoulos T.P. Sotiroudis T.G. Evangelopoulos A.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 15Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar) as described previously (16Sweeney H.L. Straceski A. Leinwand L. Tikunov B. Faust L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1603-1605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONExchange of RLCs into Chicken Smooth Muscle MyosinThe exchange of exogenous RLCs into myosin has proven difficult. For smooth muscle myosin, a 90% exchange of wild type smooth muscle RLC can be obtained at 42°C in the presence of ATP and EDTA, provided that a 10-fold molar excess of wild type smooth RLC is present(3Trybus K.M. Chatman T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4412-4419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lower temperatures result in significantly less exchange of the RLCs. The skRLC has a lower affinity for the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain than the smRLC. Under the same conditions, 80% exchange requires a 70-80-fold molar excess of skRLC(3Trybus K.M. Chatman T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4412-4419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By using trifluoperazine (TFP), near-complete exchange of skRLC into smooth muscle myosin was achieved on ice. A 10-fold molar excess of skeletal RLC was required to give a near-complete exchange.Trifluoperazine is a calmodulin antagonist which inhibits the functions of calmodulin by formation of antagonist-calmodulin complex. The crystal structure of this complex in the presence of Ca2+ indicates that the binding of TFP induces conformational changes from an elongated dumbbell, with exposed hydrophobic surfaces, to a compact globular form which can no longer interact with its target enzymes(17Vandonselaar M. Hickie R.A. Quail J.W. Delbaere L.T.J. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 795-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 18Cook W.J. Walter L.J. Walter M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15259-15265Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This conformational change is similar to that seen in the calmodulin-target peptide complex. Although the binding of TFP to RLC is not characterized, it is likely that a similar mechanism applies to TFP-RLC interactions. TFP may compete with the myosin heavy chain for the hydrophobic pockets of the RLC, thereby dissociating the RLCs. Previously, TFP has been used to extract troponin C (another member of the calmodulin superfamily) from the troponin complex (19Putkey J.A. Liu W. Sweeney H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14881-14884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to prepare RLC-deficient smooth muscle myosin through fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration (3Trybus K.M. Chatman T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4412-4419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).At a higher concentration (5 mM), TFP dissociates endogenous RLCs, but also interferes with the subsequent association of exogenous RLC. Presumably at high concentrations, TFP may effectively sequester the RLCs and prevent binding to the myosin heavy chain. On the other hand, lower TFP concentrations lead to a lower degree of exchange even at higher temperature (37°C), but does not influence the binding of the exogenous RLC. Based on these observations, the two-step RLC exchange procedure that involves lowering of the TFP concentration (described in above) was developed.Regulation via Phosphorylation of the Myosins Containing Wild Type Smooth, Wild Type Skeletal, or the Mutant Skeletal RLCFig. 3 shows the actin-activated ATPase activities at 25°C of the dephosphorylated and phosphorylated chicken gizzard smooth muscle myosin. The endogenous RLC was exchanged for either chicken smooth wild type RLC, rabbit skeletal wild type RLC, or the mutant skeletal RLC. The wild type smooth RLC-reconstituted gizzard myosin displays phosphorylation-mediated regulation. The actin-activated ATPase activity increases from 2 nmol/min/mg when wild type smRLC is dephosphorylated to 20 nmol/min/mg when the wild type smRLC is phosphorylated. These activities are comparable to what was found for native chicken gizzard myosin (22 nmol/min/mg at saturating levels of phosphorylation) (Fig. 3). The failure of the skeletal wild type RLC to confer the regulation of actin-activated ATPase via phosphorylation confirms previous findings(3Trybus K.M. Chatman T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4412-4419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, when the six conserved residues, Arg-103, Arg-123, Met-129, Gly-130, Arg-143, Arg-160, in smRLC replaced the corresponding residues of skRLC, the mutant skRLC fully restored phosphorylation-mediated regulation of gizzard myosin.Figure 3Actin-activated MgATPase activities of dephosphorylated and phosphorylated native gizzard myosin and gizzard myosin reconstituted with either smRLC (wild type), skRLC (wild type), or mutant skRLC. Maximal actin-activated ATPase rates are for chicken gizzard myosin preparations without (open bars) phosphorylation or with (stippled bars) phosphorylation of the RLC. Standard deviations for different preparations (n = 3 in all cases) are indicated. The myosin was phosphorylated using rat skeletal myosin light chain kinase. Greater than 90% of the RLCs in each preparation were phosphorylated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)If phosphorylation of the RLC regulates myosin activity via a mechanism similar to that for the regulation of glycogen phosphorylase(5Sprang S.R. Acharya K.R. Goldsmith E.J. Stuart D.I. Varvill K. Fletterick R.J. Madsen N.B. Johnson L.N. Nature. 1988; 336: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), then it is likely that of the labeled residues in Fig. 1B, two of the arginines are required to provide structural coordinates for the phosphoserine. When the phosphorylatable N-terminal serine is phosphorylated, the mobile and disordered N terminus may become immobilized and ordered and bind to the surface of the interface of the C-terminal domain. Based on the orientation of the corresponding residues in chicken skeletal structure (Fig. 1B), only the arginines found in helices E (Arg-100) and H (Arg-157) would appear to be positioned appropriately. One or two of the engineered arginines probably coordinates the phosphate of the phosphoserine by hydrogen bonds. The coordination of the phosphoserine may cause winding or unwinding of the helices and the rearrangement of domains. These conformational changes likely lead to regulation of myosin through altered interactions that involve the two RLCs and the myosin heavy chain.Based on this model, one would predict that loss of the conserved arginines in the E and H helices of the smooth muscle RLC would result in a loss of regulation. Indeed, when Ikebe et al.(20Ikebe M. Reardon S. Mitani Y. Kamisoyama H. Matsuura M. Ikebe R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9096-9100Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) substituted a region of the skeletal RLC H helix into the smooth RLC H helix, Arg-157 was lost and so was regulation. Furthermore, again based on considering the regulation of glycogen phosphorylase, the N-terminal basic residues may be involved in stabilizing the interaction of the phosphoserine with its coordination sites. Such a mechanism would explain the results of the study of Ikebe and Morita(21Ikebe M. Morita J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21339-21342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), wherein cleavage of the smooth RLC removed Arg-13 and Arg-16 and generated a RLC that could not activate smooth muscle myosin (heavy meromyosin) even when serine 19 was phosphorylated. This hypothetical regulatory scheme also is supported by NMR results. The study of Levine et al.(22Levine B.A. Griffiths H.S. Patchell V.B. Perry S.V. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) suggests that the N-terminal region of both rabbit skRLC and gizzard smRLC exhibits segmental mobility independent of the rest of the molecule. When the RLC is phosphorylated, mobility of the N-terminal segment is diminished and the serine phosphate is influenced by neighboring positively charged side chains.While the skeletal muscle RLC has maintained the ability to inhibit the activity of smooth muscle myosin, regulation (i.e. activation) of activity via phosphorylation of the RLC has been lost. Restoration of regulation results from the alteration of maximally six amino acids, and likely from a subset of the six, that are conserved in regulated myosins but absent in the vertebrate striated muscle RLCs. Additional mutagenesis, involving both the skeletal and smooth RLCs, will further delineate the necessary amino acids and the critical interactions involved in myosin regulation via phosphorylation. The regulation of glycogen phosphorylase should provide a useful framework for understanding the structural changes that accompany phosphorylation of the myosin RLC and which underlie the regulatory process.

Although the RLC is also reversibly phosphorylated in vertebrate striated muscle (at a homologous serine), this phosphorylation simply modulates contractile activity(2Sweeney H.L. Bowman B.F.

Additionally, the smooth muscle and skeletal muscle RLCs are not functionally equivalent, even though the RLCs from skeletal muscle and smooth muscle are highly homologous (71% similarity and 53% identity in sequence). The RLC from skeletal muscle myosin (skRLC) is unable to confer regulation to smooth muscle myosin (a phosphorylation-regulated myosin) and locks the myosin in the “off” state when substituted for the endogenous smooth muscle RLC (smRLC)(3Trybus K.M.

Additionally, the smRLC can confer calcium sensitivity to scallop muscle myosin (a Ca2+-regulated myosin), while the skRLC fails to do so(4Chantler P.D. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. J. Mol.

The purpose of this study was to ascertain if the loss of function of the skRLC could be restored by insertion of arginine residues that may function in a putative coordination of the phosphoserine.The phosphorylated serine residue is near the N terminus of the RLC. Studies of chimeric RLCs comprised of the N- or C-terminal half of each skRLC and smRLC indicate that it is the C-terminal half of skRLC that lacks structural elements necessary for phosphorylation-mediated regulation(3Trybus K.M. Chatman T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4412-4419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By sequence comparison (Fig. 1A), four arginine residues (Arg-103, Arg-123, Arg-143, and Arg-160; corresponding to amino acids 100, 120, 140, and 157, respectively, in the rabbit skRLC sequence) are present in the C-terminal half of the smRLC which are conserved in regulated myosin RLCs but missing in nonregulated myosin RLCs. The four arginines are located in four different domains (the E, F, G, and H helices, using calmodulin nomenclature for the helices(6Kretsinger R.H. CRC Crit. Rev.

In addition to these arginines, the C terminus of the skRLC was examined for other missing conserved amino acids.

The location of this glycine in the loop between two helices may confer flexibility that is necessary for the helices to translate relative to each other upon phosphorylation.

Comparison of the observed in vivo GDH activity with the in vivo rates of glutamine synthesis and of phosphate-activated glutaminase suggests that, under mild hyperammonemia, GDH-catalyzed de novo synthesis can provide a minimum of 19% of the glutamate pool that is recycled from neurons to astrocytes through the glutamate-glutamine cycle.

The in vivo rate was determined from the steady-state fractional 15N enrichment of brain ammonia, measured by selective observation of 15NH4+ protons in brain extract by 1H-15N heteronuclear multiple-quantum coherence transfer NMR, and the rate of increase of brain [15N]glutamate and [2-15N]glutamine measured by 15N NMR. The in vivo GDH activity was 0.76-1.17 μmol/h/g at a brain ammonia concentration of 0.87 ± 0.18 μmol/g, and 1.1-1.2 μmol/h/g at 1.0 ± 0.17 μmol/g.

https://openalex.org/W2022929361,"Reverse transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA genome is primed by the cellular tRNA3Lys molecule. Packaging of this tRNA primer during virion assembly is thought to be mediated by specific interactions with the reverse transcriptase (RT) protein. Portions of the tRNA molecule that are required for interaction with the RT protein remain poorly defined. We have used an RNA gel mobility shift assay to measure the in vitro binding of purified RT to mutant forms of tRNA3Lys. The anticodon loop could be mutated without eliminating RT recognition. However, mutations in the TΨC stem were found to partially interfere with RT binding, and D arm mutants were completely inactive in RT binding. Interestingly, binding of the RT protein to tRNA3Lys facilitates the subsequent annealing of template strand to the 3′-terminus of the tRNA molecule. Consistent with this finding, we demonstrate that mutant HIV-1 virions lacking the RT protein do contain a viral RNA genome without an associated tRNA3Lys primer. We also found that a preformed primer tRNA-template complex is efficiently recognized by RT protein in vitro. Extension of the template molecule over the TΨC loop did result in complete inhibition of RT binding, suggesting the presence of additional recognition elements in the TΨC loop. These results, combined with a comparative sequence analysis of tRNA species present in HIV-1 virions and RNA motifs selected in vitro for high affinity RT binding, suggest that RT recognizes the central domain of the tRNA tertiary structure, which is formed by interaction of the D and TΨC loops.

Retroviruses contain large amounts of tRNA, which is a non-random subset of the cellular tRNA pool (reviewed in (1Varmus H. Swanstrom R. Weiss R. Teich N. Varmus H. Coffin J. Molecular Biology of RNA Tumor Viruses. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1985Google Scholar)).

Different viruses use a different tRNA primer; avian retroviruses (e.g. avian myeloblastosis virus) use tRNATrp, most murine retroviruses and the human T-cell leukemia viruses (HTLV-I and HTLV-II) use tRNAPro, and the human (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency viruses use tRNA3Lys(1Varmus H.

There is accumulating evidence that packaging of the correct tRNA primer is determined by the RT protein. First, the RT proteins of the avian myeloblastosis virus and HIV-1 retroviruses have been shown to bind to their respective tRNA primers in vitro(6Panet A. Berliner H. J.

Alternatively, it is conceivable that the primer is specifically co-packaged with the RNA genome through annealing of the 3′-terminal 18 nucleotides of the tRNA primer to a perfect complementary sequence on the viral genome, the so-called primer binding site (PBS). This complex may be further stabilized through additional base-pairing interactions between the two RNA molecules (11Cobrinik D. Aiyar A. Ge Z. Katzmann M. Huang H. Leis J. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 13617-13624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the question of binding specificity of HIV-1 RT toward its cognate primer remains unresolved. For instance, several studies reported binding of other tRNA species with equal affinity(13Kohlstaedt L.A. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9652-9656Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 20Delahunty M.D. Wilson S.H. Karpel R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 23Sobol R.W.

(7Barat C. Lullien V. Schatz O. Keith G. Nugeyre M.T. Gruninger-Leitch F. Barre-Sinoussi F. LeGrice S.F.J. Darlix J.L. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3279-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) have reported that HIV-1 RT interacts with its cognate primer tRNA3Lys by virtue of specific contacts with the anticodon stem-loop(7Barat C. Lullien V. Schatz O. Keith G. Nugeyre M.T. Gruninger-Leitch F. Barre-Sinoussi F. LeGrice S.F.J. Darlix J.L. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3279-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). It remains to be established whether solely the anticodon domain of tRNA3Lys is in contact with the enzyme. For instance, nuclease footprinting analysis suggested mild protection of all three loops by RT(25Wöhrl B.M. Ehresmann B. Keith G. LeGrice S.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13617-13624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that an in vitro synthesized tRNA3Lys transcript can functionally substitute for its natural counterpart in RT binding studies and reverse transcription assays(13Kohlstaedt L.A. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9652-9656Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 18Barat C. LeGrice S.F.J. Darlix J.-L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 24Weiss S. Konig B. Muller H.J. Seidel H. Goody R.S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 13617-13624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was also shown that synthetic tRNA3Lys adopts the correct L-shaped structure, suggesting that all base pairs and tertiary interactions (e.g. between D and TΨC loops) are formed in the absence of base modifications(25Wöhrl B.M. Ehresmann B. Keith G. LeGrice S.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13617-13624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Apparently, synthetic tRNA transcripts contain all sequence and structure requirements for recognition by the RT enzyme, although modified nucleotides may be important for fine tuning tRNA identity(13Kohlstaedt L.A. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9652-9656Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 18Barat C. LeGrice S.F.J. Darlix J.-L.

EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Therefore, to a first approximation, rules that apply to the selective recognition of tRNA3Lys by the HIV-1 RT protein may be obtained in in vitro experiments with synthetic tRNA species. This allows a mutational analysis of the sequence and structure requirements in tRNA3Lys for RT binding. Here, we probed the binding site for RT on synthetic tRNA3Lys in bandshift binding experiments with mutated tRNA molecules and demonstrate that the anticodon loop is not important for RT binding. In contrast, we found that mutations in the D-stem loop abolished RT binding. Furthermore, we demonstrate that annealing of an antisense oligonucleotide mimicking the PBS sequence to tRNA3Lys was possible at 37°C with the RT-tRNA complex but not with free tRNA, suggesting that RT opens the acceptor stem to allow intermolecular base pairing. A preformed tRNA3Lys-PBS complex, in which both acceptor and TΨC stems will be disrupted, was efficiently recognized by RT protein. Extension of this oligonucleotide by five nucleotides, thereby forming a duplex with the TΨC loop nucleotides, was found to completely block RT binding. These data, combined with results of a recent SELEX experiment (27Tuerk C. MacDougal S. Gold L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6988-6992Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) and a comparative sequence analysis of the tRNA species present in HIV-1 virions(4Jiang M. Mak J. Ladha A. Cohen E. Klein M. Rovinski B. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3246-3253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggest that the tertiary tRNA structure and the sequence of the D arm of tRNA3Lys is critically important for recognition by the RT protein. Plasmids were constructed to facilitate transcription of the tRNA3Lys gene with T7 RNA polymerase. Clones for wild-type (wt) tRNA3Lys and several mutants were constructed from a series of three overlapping DNA oligonucleotides that contained the tRNA sequence flanked by an upstream T7 RNA polymerase promoter and a downstream BanI restriction site to allow run-off transcription. Oligonucleotide 1-wt contained the wild-type tRNA3Lys sequence 5′-CTCACTATAGGCCCGGATAGCTCAGTCGGTAGAGCATCAGACTTTTAATCTGAGGGTCCAGGGTTCAAGTCCCTG-3′ (overlap regions underlined). Similar oligonucleotides with specific mutations in different tRNA domains were synthesized (see Fig. 1). The central, sense oligomers 1 were individually annealed to 3′-antisense oligonucleotide 2, which encoded BanI and EcoRI restriction sites for transcription and cloning purposes, respectively: 5′ATGGAATTCCCTGGCGCCCGAACAGGGACTTGAA-3′ (sites in bold, overlap underlined). The DNA duplex synthesized in a PCR reaction with oligomers 1 and 2 was extended by the 5′-sense oligonucleotide 3, containing a T7 promoter and a BamHI site: 5′CATGGATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGC-3′ (site in bold, overlap underlined). An initial PCR reaction was performed with 5 ng of central oligonucleotide 1 and a molar excess of 5′ and 3′ oligonucelotides 2 and 3 (100 ng each, 35 cycles of 1 min, 95°C; 1 min, 55°C; and 1 min, 72°C). A sample was subsequently used in a second PCR reaction with a 100 ng of primers 2 and 3 (100 ng each, PCR protocol as indicated above). The final PCR product was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and inserted into plasmid pUC9. All plasmids were checked directly by sequencing. The BanI restriction site was used to allow run-off transcription of a 74-nucleotide-long tRNA3Lys transcript. We initially failed to obtain BanI cleavage, which was shown to result from methylation of an overlapping dcm recognition sequence(28Oude Essink B.B. Berkhout B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 108Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). To circumvent this problem, we transformed all pUC-tRNA3Lys plasmids into the dcm- host GM48. Unlabeled T7 transcripts were synthesized according to standard methods(29Gurerick V.V. Pokrovskaya I.D. Obukhova T.A. Zozulya S.A. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 195: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 30Berkhout B. Oude Essink B.B. Schoneveld I. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). tRNA3Lys was internally labeled with [α-32P]UTP during in vitro synthesis in a 2-h reaction with 1 μg of linearized DNA in 12 μl of T7 buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM spermidine, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 12 mM MgCl2) containing 0.5 mM G/A/CTP, 0.16 mM UTP and 2 μl of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol), 50 units of T7 RNA polymerase and 10 units of RNase inhibitor. Upon DNase treatment and phenol extraction, the RNA was ethanol precipitated, dissolved in renaturation buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl), and refolded by incubation at 85°C for 2 min, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. The recombinant HIV-1 RT enzyme was obtained from Dr. D. Stammers (Wellcome Research Labs, Beckenham, Kent). This purified protein is in the 66,000 homodimer form and supplied at a 0.13 μg/μl concentration (38,000 enzyme units/mg protein) in 0.8 M ammonium sulfate, 20 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol. Moloney murine leukemia virus RT was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc., and avian myeloblastosis virus RT was from Boehringer Mannheim. The affinity of RT for tRNA was measured by gel-bandshift assay(31Fried M. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar). In some experiments, tRNA was pre-incubated with oligonucleotides as indicated in the figure legends. Oligonucleotide PBS is 5′-TGGCGCCCGAACAGGGAC-3′, oligonucleotide 3 and PBSext, which is identical to oligonucleotide 2, were described in the PCR protocol (see above). A standard RT binding reaction mixture (20 μl) contained ~10 ng of uniformly labeled tRNA probe in buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 5% glycerol) with 0.26 μg of RT protein. The final concentration of HIV-1 RT was ~100 nM, that of the tRNA molecule was ~20 nM, and that of oligonucleotide was ≥500 nM. After incubation for 15 min at 20°C, the samples were separated on a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.25 × TBE containing 5% glycerol. Electrophoresis at 30 V was for approximately 18 h at room temperature. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film at −80°C using intensifying screens. For quantitation, gels were exposed overnight in a Molecular Dynamics phosphorimager. The full-length molecular HIV-1 clone pLAI was used to construct an RT-deficient viral genome (RT-). Details of the DNA construction are presented elsewhere(32Das A.T. Berkhout B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1319-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). All techniques (cell culture, DNA transfection, virus purification, isolation of HIV-1 genomic RNA, and subsequent tRNA or oligonucleotide primer extension assays) were previously described(33Das A.T. Klaver B. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3090-3097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have used gel-bandshift assays to establish that in vitro made human tRNA3Lys (Fig. 1) can bind to the HIV-1 RT protein in the absence of either the primer binding site on viral RNA or additional protein factors. Complex formation was readily detected as a shift in the mobility of the riboprobe in the gel (Fig. 2A, compare lanes1 and 2). A variety of parameters affecting the binding of the RT protein to tRNA3Lys was studied, and binding conditions were optimized (results not shown). For instance, binding was found to be temperature independent (0-37°C) and completed in a 10-min incubation. Complex formation was strongly inhibited by greater than 100 mM NaCl or 100 mM MgCl2. Binding was observed in the presence of vast excess of 5 S rRNA added as a nonspecific competitor (1 μg or approximately 25 pmol). Furthermore, no RT-tRNA3Lys complexes were obtained with RT enzymes of the Moloney murine leukemia and avian myeloblastosis viruses (data not shown). The specificity of the interaction between the HIV-1 RT protein and tRNA3Lys implies that the tRNA molecule contains features that distinguish it from other transcripts. In differentiating among cellular tRNAs, the unique nucleotide sequence of the anticodon loop may form such an identity element. Consistent with this idea, cross-linking experiments revealed contacts between RT and the anticodon loop of tRNA3Lys(7Barat C. Lullien V. Schatz O. Keith G. Nugeyre M.T. Gruninger-Leitch F. Barre-Sinoussi F. LeGrice S.F.J. Darlix J.L. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3279-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). To assess the sequence-specific contribution of this tRNA domain to RT recognition, we constructed a 6-base substitution mutant (Fig. 1, AC mutant). Gel shift assays with wt and mutant tRNA3Lys are shown in Fig. 2A and quantitated in Fig. 2B. The AC mutant consistently showed normal levels of RT binding when compared to wt tRNA3Lys (Fig. 2A, lanes14 and 2, respectively). To further define the sequence and structure requirements for the binding of RT to tRNA3Lys, two additional mutants were made: one substituting 4 bases in the TΨC stem (Fig. 1, TΨC mutant), and the other carrying a 6-nucleotide deletion in the D arm (D mutant). Mutations in the D arm affected RT binding most severely (Fig. 2A, lane4), and a partial reduction in RT binding efficiency was measured for the TΨC mutant (lane6). We also analyzed the RT binding capacity of 3-point mutants that were fortuitously obtained in the context of the AC mutant (C3 → U, G10 → C, C13 → U). Compared to the AC mutant, we consistently measured reduced RT recognition (~20-30%) for the two D arm mutants (G10 → C and C13 → U), whereas ~70% binding was measured for the acceptor stem mutant (C3 → U). The results of these binding assays are summarized in Fig. 2B. The combined data suggest that the sequence and structure of the D arm in tRNA3Lys is critically important for RT binding. To investigate whether RT could bind to extended forms of tRNA3Lys with additional nucleotides added to either its 5′- or 3′-end, we synthesized two different transcripts. First, we used an aberrant plasmid construct with two tandem T7 promoter elements. Transcription of this plasmid will produce a mixture of two RNAs, wt tRNA3Lys and a 5′-elongated form with 24 additional nucleotides (Fig. 2A, lane11). RT binding assays indicated that this 5′-extended tRNA3Lys did efficiently form a complex with the RT protein (lane12). Second, we generated 3′-extended transcripts by using the downstream EcoRI restriction site for run-off transcription. This results in the synthesis of a 79-nucleotide-long transcript, which is 5 nucleotides longer than wt tRNA3Lys (Fig. 2A, lane15). It should be noted that this 3′-elongated transcript is only 3 nucleotides longer than natural tRNA3Lys because our synthetic wt tRNA is lacking the 3′-terminal CA dinucleotide (Fig. 1). In contrast to the results obtained for 5′-extended tRNA, we consistently measured reduced RT binding for the 3′-extended molecule (lane16). Furthermore, we measured no binding activity for a transcript with 171 additional 3′-nucleotides (data not shown). We observed some surprising effects of the tRNA3Lys size variants on the electrophoretic mobility of the binary RT complexes. As expected, the free 5′-extended tRNA3Lys molecule migrated slower in the polyacrylamide gel compared to wt tRNA3Lys (Fig. 2A, lane11). The complex of RT protein with this extended RNA mutant, however, ran ahead of the wt tRNA3Lys-RT complex (lane12). This result was confirmed in binding experiments with a gel-eluted, purified form of the 5′-extended tRNA (data not shown). It seems plausible that it is primarily the conformation of the RNA-protein complex and not so much the molecular weight of its constituents that determines the migration in a native gel. Since it has been reported that the RT polypeptide is a flexible protein and that substantial conformational changes occur upon primer binding(34Arnold E. Jacobo-Molina A. Nanni R.G. Williams R.L. Lu X. Ding J. Clark A.D. Zhang A. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A. Hughes S.H. Nature. 1992; 357: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), our findings may suggest that this primer-induced conformational change in RT is affected by 5′-extension of the tRNA3Lys primer. No such migration effect was observed for the RT complexed with the 3′-extended form of tRNA3Lys (lane16). We next tested whether a preformed tRNA3Lys-PBS complex could still be specifically recognized by the RT protein. We therefore synthesized an oligonucleotide that mimics the PBS sequence of the HIV-1 template RNA. This PBS oligonucleotide can form a 16-base pair duplex with the 3′-end of synthetic tRNA3Lys (Fig. 1, nucleotide positions 59-74), thereby disrupting both the acceptor and TΨC stem regions. To follow both nucleic acid moieties, we performed binding assays with 32P label on either the tRNA3Lys primer or the PBS template (Fig. 3, A and B, respectively). Formation of the tRNA-PBS complex was found to be dependent on a denaturation step (lanes3), which is expected because the tRNA cloverleaf structure needs to be partially unfolded for the PBS oligonucleotide to gain access to its target sequence in the acceptor and TΨC stems. Most importantly, we detected a “supershifted” RT-tRNA-PBS complex upon subsequent incubation with HIV-1 RT (lanes4). This ternary complex can be visualized with either a labeled tRNA or PBS species. These results indicate that RT can specifically recognize the preformed tRNA-PBS complex. Alternatively, RT may have bound the tRNA and DNA probes as individual molecules, perhaps by using different protein domains. We can rule out this possibility because formation of the ternary complex is dependent on the presence of a pre-assembled tRNA-PBS complex and not seen with both RNA/DNA components present as individual molecules due to a 0°C pre-incubation (lanes5). Furthermore, ternary complex formation was specific for the PBS oligonucleotide and not seen with unrelated probes that do not bind tRNA3Lys (e.g. oligonucleotide 3 in Fig. 4A, lane6).Figure 4:Inhibition of the RT-tRNA3Lys binding by masking of the TΨC loop. A, gel shift assay with 32P-labeled tRNA3Lys in the absence or presence of RT, the PBSext, or the control oligonucleotide 3 (indicated on top of the panel). tRNA3Lys was pre-incubated with 3 μg of the oligonucleotides indicated either for 15 min at 0°C or for 2 min at 85°C, followed by slow cooling to 20°C. The subsequent incubation with RT was for 15 min at 20°C. The migration position of the individual RNA/DNA components and the binary complexes are indicated. The slower migrating RNA species present in the tRNA sample is a conformer that disappeared under denaturing gel electrophoresis conditions (data not shown). B, gel shift assay with the 32P-labeled PBSext oligonucleotide in the absence or presence of RT and the tRNA3Lys primer (indicated on top of the panel). tRNA3Lys was pre-incubated with PBS either for 15 min at 0°C or for 2 min at 85°C, followed by slow cooling to 20°C. The subsequent incubation with RT was for 15 min at 20°C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As described earlier, we observed some unexpected gel migration effects with RT-nucleic acid complexes. Although no linear relationship exists between the size of a nucleic acid-protein complex and its electrophoretic mobility on native gels, we do think that the shift seen upon inclusion of the relatively small PBS oligonucleotide in the RT-tRNA complex is rather dramatic. A plausible explanation is that the RT polypeptide adopts a different conformation in the binary versus the ternary complex. Consistent with this idea, it has been reported that RT binds a primer differently depending on the presence or absence of template(35Andreola M.-L. Tarrago-Litvak L. Levina A.S. Kolocheva T.I. El Dirani-Diab R. Jamkovoj V.I. Khalimskaya N.L. Barr P.J. Litvak S. Nevinsky G.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3629-3637Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We next tested whether the TΨC loop needs to be accessible for interaction with the RT protein with an extended version of the PBS oligonucleotide; PBSext, which forms a duplex with the 3′-terminal 21 nucleotides of synthetic tRNA3Lys, thereby blocking the complete TΨC loop (Fig. 1, nucleotide positions 54-74). In contrast to the results obtained with the PBS oligonucleotide, we found that RT could not recognize the preformed tRNA-PBSext complex (Fig. 4A, lane4; Fig. 4B, lane5). These results suggest that the TΨC loop nucleotides are important for recognition by the RT protein. It is important to note that the PBSext probe does not exert a general toxic effect on RT activity because inhibition by PBSext is restricted to the situation in which the oligonucleotide is annealed to tRNA3Lys in a 85°C pre-incubation (Fig. 4A, lane4). The control 0°C pre-incubation showed efficient RT-tRNA3Lys complex formation in the presence of a free PBSext probe (Fig. 4A, lane3). Furthermore, unrelated oligomers were unable to interfere with the RT-tRNA interaction, even upon 85°C pre-incubation with tRNA (Fig. 4A, lane6, and data not shown). It has been proposed that binding of the RT protein to tRNA3Lys results in opening of the acceptor stem, thus facilitating the subsequent annealing to the PBS site(22Sarih-Cottin L. Bordier B.

The calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase (calcineurin) has been suggested to play roles in activation of T cells and in the mating response of yeast. Recently, studies have shown it to be the target of immunosuppressant drugs such as cyclosporin and FK-506. In this study, we have cloned the gene for the catalytic subunit of calcineurin, CnA, from the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The gene (named ppb1+) has been mapped to chromosome II by analysis of the hybridization of a genomic DNA probe to an ordered library. The gene produces a single mRNA species of 2.5 kilobases, which varies during the cell cycle in exponentially growing cells. In addition, expression of ppb1+ mRA is induced by nitrogen starvation, a condition that favors mating in S. pombe. The ppb1+ gene promoter contains a cis-acting element for the ste11 transcription factor, and we have shown that induction of the ppb1+ mRNA during nitrogen starvation is dependent on the ste11 gene product. Together with earlier studies showing that disruption of the ppb1+ gene in S. pombe results in sterility (Yoshida, T., Toda, T., and Yanagida, M.(1994) J. Cell Sci., 107, 1725-1735), our studies suggest that the ppb1+ gene plays a role in the gene expression cascade that is essential for mating and sporulation in S. pombe.

The holoenzyme is composed of two subunits, the catalytic subunit (CnA), and a Ca2+-binding regulatory subunit (CnB) structurally related to CaM(8Stewart A.A. Ingebritsen T.S. Manalan A. Klee C.B.

While a great deal is known about calcineurin enzymology, it is only recently that inroads have been made into understanding specific roles of the enzyme in vivo. Recently, it has been shown that calcineurin is a target for immunosuppressant drugs such as FK-506 and cyclosporin(11Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3617) Google Scholar). In T cells, it appears to function in the activation of the transcriptional regulator NFAT(4O'Keefe S.J. Tamura J. Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. Oneill E.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 692-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 5Woodrow M. Clipstone N.A. Cantrell D. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1517-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), a step requisite for T cell activation and inhibitable by immunosuppressants. In Aspergillus nidulans, a filamentous fungus related to yeast, we have shown that the CnA gene is essential for proliferation and that the mRNA is expressed in a cell cycle-dependent manner(2Rasmussen C. Garen C. Brining S. Kincaid R.L. Means R.L. Means A.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3917-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the yeast S. cerevisiae, multiple CnA genes exist, and while it appears they are not essential for vegetative growth, this enzyme appears to play a role in the mating pheromone response pathway(6Cyert M.S. Kunisawa R. Kaim D. Thorner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7376-7380Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 7Cyert M.S. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3460-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Recently, a CnA homologue was isolated from Schizosaccharomyces pombe and gene disruption suggested that it is not strictly required for vegetative growth, although growth was temperature sensitive in a strain lacking the CnA gene(12Yoshida T. Toda T. Yanagida M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1725-1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it was found that the lack of a CnA gene caused a sterile phenotype, suggesting that calcineurin is involved in the mating response in S. pombe. In this study, we have also cloned the S. pombe CnA gene (designated ppb1+). The gene we have isolated is identical to that observed in the previous study(12Yoshida T. Toda T. Yanagida M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1725-1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridization of a ppb1+ probe to an ordered phage library allowed us to determine the location of the ppb1+ gene in the S. pombe genome. In addition, we have examined the expression of ppb1+ mRNA. We observed a moderate change during the cell cycle in exponentially growing cells. However, when cells are grown in nitrogen-free medium or allowed to reach saturation, CnA mRNA levels are markedly induced. The S. pombe CnA gene promoter contains a cis-acting element (TR element) previously shown to be responsive to the ste11+ transcription factor(13Sugimoto A. Iino Y. Maeda T. Watanabe Y. Yamamoto M. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1990-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Our studies show that CnA expression during nitrogen starvation is directly dependent on ste11+ and suggests that CnA may be an integral component of the signal transduction mechanism that functions during the mating response in yeast. The following strains of S. pombe were used: wild type, cdc25 (h-, cdc25-22, leu1-32), and ste11- (h90, ste11-, ura4). All yeast strains were cultured as described (14Alfa C. Fantes P. Hyams J. McLeod M. Warbrick E. Experiments with Fission Yeast: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). Escherichia coli strain DH5α was cultured as described previously(15Maniatis T. Fritsch E. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Two mixed oligonucleotides encoding all possible combinations encoding the peptide sequences RGNHEC (5′-oligonucleotide) and MDVFTW (3′-oligonucleotide) were used to amplify a CnA homologue by polymerase chain reaction. The oligonucleotides are based on two regions that are completely conserved in all CnA homologues cloned to date. The expected product sizes were approximately 600 bp based on other CnA homologues. The PCR product was subcloned into pGEM3Zf(-), and several clones were sequenced to verify they were CnA homologues. All were identical, so one representative clone was used as a probe to screen an ordered P1 phage genomic library for S. pombe(16Hoheisel J.D. Maier E. Mott R. McCarthy L. Grigoriev A.V. Schalkwyk L.C. Nizetic D. Francis F. Lehrach H. Cell. 1993; 73: 109-120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from S. pombe as described previously(17Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3143) Google Scholar). Following isolation, RNA was resuspended in sterile water and quantified by A260. For isolation of genomic DNA, S. pombe cultures containing 3-5 × 107 cells per ml were used for each isolation. Genomic DNA was isolated as described previously(14Alfa C. Fantes P. Hyams J. McLeod M. Warbrick E. Experiments with Fission Yeast: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). Small-scale preparation of plasmid and cosmid DNA was performed by the alkaline lysis method as described previously using Wizard DNA Clean-Up resin (Promega)(15Maniatis T. Fritsch E. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). For larger scale preparations, alkaline lysis followed by precipitation with polyethylene glycol/NaCl was used(15Maniatis T. Fritsch E. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). For radiolabeling of DNA hybridization probes, 200 ng of DNA was labeled with [32P]dCTP (Amersham) by the random primer method(15Maniatis T. Fritsch E. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Labeled DNA was separated from unincorporated nucleotides by G-50 Sephadex chromatography. For analysis of isolated DNA by Southern blot, standard procedures were used(15Maniatis T. Fritsch E. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). DNA was transferred to Magna Nylon transfer membrane by capillary blotting overnight using 20 × SSC (3 M NaCl, 0.3 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0) as the transfer buffer. After transfer, filters were air dried for 30 min, and the DNA cross-linked to the membrane by exposure to UV light (1200 J/cm2) using a Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene). Pre-hybridization and hybridization were as used previously(2Rasmussen C. Garen C. Brining S. Kincaid R.L. Means R.L. Means A.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3917-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For Northern blot analysis, previously described methods were used(2Rasmussen C. Garen C. Brining S. Kincaid R.L. Means R.L. Means A.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3917-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). After transfer to Magna Nylon membrane, the RNA was cross-linked to the membrane using UV light (1200 J/cm2) using a Stratagene Stratalinker 2400. For slot-blot analysis, 10 μg of RNA in sterile water was mixed with an equal volume of SSCF (3 volumes of 20 × SSC, 2 volumes of 37% formaldehyde) and denatured at 68°C for 15 min. The sample was chilled in ice, and an equal volume of 15 × SSC was added. Blotting onto Magna Nylon transfer membrane was performed according to manufacturer's specifications using a Mini-fold slot blot apparatus (Tyler Research). For quantitation of ppb1+, mRNA 2-fold serial dilutions of total RNA samples were prepared, applied to transfer membrane, and hybridized as described above. The autoradiogram was scanned using an Apple Color One scanner set for 256 levels of gray and 300 dpi resolution. The hybridization signals were quantified using the program NIH Image (version 1.55). Determinations of relative mRNA levels were based on regions of the serial dilution series that showed a corresponding 2-fold difference in the calculated intensity, indicating that the exposure was in the linear response range of the x-ray film. Following cross-linking, filters were prehybridized for 2 h at 42°C in 50% deionized formamide, 5 × Denhardt's, 6 × SSC, 0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA solution(2Rasmussen C. Garen C. Brining S. Kincaid R.L. Means R.L. Means A.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3917-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Hybridization was carried out at the same temperature for 18 h in a fresh solution of the same composition as that used for prehybridization. Probe concentration was 5 × 106 cpm/ml. After hybridization, filters were washed five times in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature, and twice for 15 min in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55°C. After washing, filters were covered with Saran Wrap and exposed to Kodak X-OMAT AR at −70°C using intensifying screens. DNA sequencing the dideoxy-mediated chain termination method was applied as described (18Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52668) Google Scholar) using a Sequenase version 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and 35S-dATP (Amersham). Following electrophoresis, the gel was fixed for 10 min in 10% methanol, 10% glacial acetic acid and dried under the vacuum at 80°C for 45 min. The dried gel was exposed to Kodak X-OMAT AR film at room temperature overnight. cdc25-22 cells were first grown at the permissive temperature (25°C) until they reached a density of 5 × 106 cells/ml. To synchronize cells, the culture was shifted to the restrictive temperature (35°C) for 4.25 h resulting in G2 arrest. To release cells, the culture was returned to permissive conditions for 5 h, and cells were harvested from the culture at 20-min intervals. 1-ml samples were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and stained with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (Sigma) as described (17Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3143) Google Scholar) to examine binucleate index as indicators of cell cycle synchrony. For each time point, at least 300 cells were scored. For RNA isolation, 5 × 108 cells were washed with sterile water and then frozen in liquid nitrogen. S. pombe strain YEG-17 (h-) or a ste11- strain was used to examine ppb1+ mRNA levels under different nutritional conditions. Cells were initially grown to a density of 8 × 106 cells/ml and then washed and inoculated into new culture medium at 5 × 106 cells/ml. Media used were normal minimal medium as before, low glucose minimal, or nitrogen-free minimal medium(14Alfa C. Fantes P. Hyams J. McLeod M. Warbrick E. Experiments with Fission Yeast: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). For stationary phase cultures, cells were placed in regular minimal medium and allowed to grow to saturation. For the other media, samples were taken at various times, and RNA was isolated and analyzed by slot-blot analysis. β-Galactosidase activity was detected in cells containing lacZ reporter constructs as follows. A single colony selected from an EMM (17Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3143) Google Scholar) agar plate was streaked onto a Whatmann 1 filter (75-mm circle) overlaid on the appropriate nutrient agar plate. EMM + adenine + leucine was used to look at β-galactosidase activity in growing cells while malt extract (17Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3143) Google Scholar) agar was used to test for expression under conditions that induce mating. After overnight growth, the filter was removed from the plate, immersed in liquid nitrogen to permeabilize the cells, and then laid on top of a second filter saturated with Z buffer containing X-Gal (150 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO4, 4 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.33 mg/ml X-Gal). The filters were then incubated at 30°C to allow color development. The filters were then air-dried and imaged by scanning as described above. Previous studies have suggested that CnA plays important roles in eukaryotic cells, being required for T cell activation and essential for cell division in A. nidulans(2Rasmussen C. Garen C. Brining S. Kincaid R.L. Means R.L. Means A.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3917-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 4O'Keefe S.J. Tamura J. Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. Oneill E.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 692-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). We were therefore interested in cloning the CnA gene of S. pombe as a prelude to studies examining the role of this enzyme in yeast development. To obtain a hybridization probe for screening genomic DNA libraries, we designed oligonucleotides to use in PCR amplification of a portion of an S. pombe CnA homologue (as described under “Experimental Procedures”). Following PCR amplification, a fragment of the expected size was obtained, which was then subcloned and sequenced. The sequence obtained encoded a predicted peptide 75% identical to human and A. nidulans CnA, indicating that we had obtained a portion of the S. pombe gene by PCR. The PCR-derived clone was then used as a probe to screen an ordered P1 phage library (obtained from Dr. Elmar Meier, (Imperial Cancer Research Fund), London)(16Hoheisel J.D. Maier E. Mott R. McCarthy L. Grigoriev A.V. Schalkwyk L.C. Nizetic D. Francis F. Lehrach H. Cell. 1993; 73: 109-120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Hybridization of the probe to the filter containing P1 phage DNA resulted in 10 positive signals (Fig. 1). The location of the signals were mapped by a computer-based analysis system at ICRF and a cosmid identified based on the P1 phage hybridization pattern. The ppb1+ gene was localized to cosmid 32h9, which maps to chromosome II, between cdc10 and top2 on the S. pombe genetic map(16Hoheisel J.D. Maier E. Mott R. McCarthy L. Grigoriev A.V. Schalkwyk L.C. Nizetic D. Francis F. Lehrach H. Cell. 1993; 73: 109-120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA using the PCR probe showed that a 2.1-kb EcoRI fragment contained at least part of the CnA gene and that a hybridizing species of identical size was contained in the 32h9 cosmid. This 2.1-kb EcoRI fragment was subcloned and used to further map the cosmid. Our mapping results showed that the ppb1+ gene was entirely contained within two adjacent HindIII fragments in the 32h9 cosmid (Fig. 2). The sequence of the ppb1+ gene from −867 through the 1st exon is shown in Fig. 3.Figure 2Restriction mapping of the ppb1+ gene. Genomic DNA (Gen) and DNA isolated from the cosmid 32h9 (Cos) were analyzed by Southern blot as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The samples were digested with either EcoRI (E) or HindIII (H). The DNA was then blotted to nylon filters and hybridized to the PCR-derived CnA probe. The sizes of the hybridizing fragments (in kb) are indicated and were identical in both the cosmid and genomic DNA samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Sequence of 867 bp of 5′-flanking region of the S. pombe ppb1+ gene and the first exon including the predicted translation start site. The putative ste11 binding site is shown by the underlined italic type, starting at −137 bp relative to the initiation methionine codon. The gene that we have cloned is identical to that isolated previously(12Yoshida T. Toda T. Yanagida M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1725-1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) While this work was in progress, we were in contact with Prof. M Yanagida (Kyoto University) who informed us that they had also cloned a CnA homologue from S. pombe(12Yoshida T. Toda T. Yanagida M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1725-1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of our sequence with theirs showed perfect agreement, indicating that we had cloned the same gene. In that study, it was found that disruption of the CnA gene in S. pombe was not lethal, as we have also observed (data not shown). However, other interesting phenotypes were observed. Overexpression caused a variety of cytological defects in interphase cells, while a ppb1+ null strain was sterile, suggesting a defect in the mating response pathway(12Yoshida T. Toda T. Yanagida M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1725-1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of these effects, we were interested in determining whether expression of the ppb1+ gene was associated with either cell cycle progression or the mating response in S. pombe. To examine the levels of ppb1+ mRNA during the cell cycle, cells were synchronized using the temperature-sensitive strain cdc25-22, which arrests cells in G2, followed by release to permissive conditions and sampling at 20-min intervals thereafter. Total RNA was prepared, and the levels of ppb1+ mRNA were examined by Northern blot analysis. In addition, the percentage of binucleate cells was monitored to assess the degree of synchrony and the position of S phase, which occurs coincident with the maximum of binucleated cells(14Alfa C. Fantes P. Hyams J. McLeod M. Warbrick E. Experiments with Fission Yeast: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). The results show that ppb1+ mRNA levels vary slightly during the cell cycle with maximum levels observed conincident with each S phase (Fig. 4). Next, we tested whether ppb1+ mRNA levels vary during changes in the growth conditions of cells. Since previous studies suggested that ppb1+ might be important in responses to mating pheromone in S. cerevisiae(6Cyert M.S. Kunisawa R. Kaim D. Thorner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7376-7380Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 7Cyert M.S. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3460-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and that S. pombe lacking calcineurin is sterile (12Yoshida T. Toda T. Yanagida M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1725-1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we were interested in determining if ppb1+ mRNA expression could be induced by conditions that favor transition to the sexual cycle. Parallel cultures of exponentially growing cells were shifted to nitrogen-free medium, glucose-free medium, or allowed to grow to saturation. RNA was isolated, and ppb1+ mRNA levels were determined by slot-blot hybridization of serially diluted total RNA samples. The results indicate that ppb1+ mRNA levels are significantly increased when cells are deprived of nitrogen or allowed to grow to saturation as compared to histone H2A mRNA (Fig. 5). Scanning densitometry was used to quantify CnA mRNA levels using these serially diluted RNA samples. The results indicate that ppb1+ mRNA levels are increased 8-fold in response to nitrogen starvation. Examination of the time course of induction showed that levels increase as soon as 2 h after shifting to nitrogen-free medium, with maximal levels of expression observed within 8 h after the shift (Fig. 6A). Previous studies have shown that the ste11+ transcription factor regulates the expression of some genes in response to nitrogen starvation. The expression of ste11+ is inhibited by cAMP via activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase(13Sugimoto A. Iino Y. Maeda T. Watanabe Y. Yamamoto M. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1990-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Regulation of ste11-dependent genes occurs via a cis-acting element (TR element) in the 5′-untranslated region of these genes(13Sugimoto A. Iino Y. Maeda T. Watanabe Y. Yamamoto M. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1990-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Inspection of the ppb1+ 5′-upstream sequence revealed a potential TR element starting at position −137 relative to the initiation ATG codon (the TR consensus is TTCTTTGTTY). The putative element in the ppb1+ gene promoter matches at 9/10 positions and contains a conserved G residue at position 7 previously shown to be essential for ste11 binding to the element(13Sugimoto A. Iino Y. Maeda T. Watanabe Y. Yamamoto M. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1990-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). To determine if the induction of ppb1+ expression during nitrogen starvation is dependent on ste11+, we examined ppb1+ mRNA levels under two different sets of conditions. First, ppb1+ mRNA levels were examined in cells cultured in the presence or absence of cAMP + caffeine. This treatment raises intracellular cAMP levels, which would be expected to inhibit ste11+ expression and in turn the expression of ste11+-dependent genes. The results show that cells treated in this way fail to increase ppb1+ mRNA levels upon nitrogen starvation, suggesting that ppb1+ gene expression requires expression of the ste11 transcription factor (Fig. 6B). Next, we examined ppb1+ mRNA levels in a ste11- null strain. Using the same experimental protocol as above, we observed that ppb1+ mRNA levels did not increase in the ste11- strain upon nitrogen starvation, suggesting that the TR element present in the ppb1+ gene promoter is functional and regulates ppb1+ expression in vivo (Fig. 6C). Because these data suggest that ste11+ regulates ppb1+ expression, we decided to directly test whether the TR element present in the ppb1+ gene promoter was functional in vivo or if ppb1+ expression was indirectly regulated by ste11. Two different reporter constructs were constructed as follows. Fragments with 5′-end points either at −157 bp or −127 bp relative to the start of translation and identical 3′-end points(−1) were synthesized by PCR. Each fragment was first subcloned into pGEM3Zf(+) and sequenced to ensure no polymerase-induced mutations had been introduced. The first fragment (−157) contains the TR element, while the second(−127) starts just after the TR element. Each fragment was then ligated 5′ to the E. coli lacZ gene, which encodes β-galactosidase. These plasmids also contain an ars sequence, to permit replication in S. pombe, and the S. cerevisiae URA3 gene, to permit selection of cells containing the reporter plasmid. Each of the reporter constructs was transformed into S. pombe, and ura+ prototrophs were selected. Cells were then streaked onto filters overlaid on plates containing normal growth medium (EMM) or medium that induces mating (malt extract agar). The filters were then removed, and the presence of β-galactosidase was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As can be seen (Fig. 7), both constructs direct the expression of low levels of β-galactosidase when cells are grown on EMM. On medium that induces mating, the −157 construct produced higher levels of β-galactosidase, as indicated by the darker staining. This result is consistent with the previously observed induction of ppb1+ mRNA expression upon nitrogen starvation. In contrast, the levels of β-galactosidase in cells containing the −127 construct were unchanged. These data directly demonstrate that the TR element in the ppb1+ promoter is functional in vivo and that the ppb1+ gene is directly regulated by the ste11 transcription factor during the mating response. In this study, we have cloned the S. pombe homologue of the calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase catalytic subunit (calcineurin A) by screening an ordered P1 phage library with a genomic fragment produced by PCR. Mapping of P1 phage containing the ppb1+ gene allowed mapping of the ppb1+ gene to chromosome II between the cdc10 and top1 genes. In the earlier study, the ppb1+ gene was said to be localized to chromosome I, 200 kb away from the sts1+ gene(12Yoshida T. Toda T. Yanagida M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1725-1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reason for the discrepancy with our mapping is unclear. Our sequence exactly matches that of the one from Prof. Yanagida's group(12Yoshida T. Toda T. Yanagida M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1725-1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), so it is not another calcineurin gene, and the cosmid that contains our ppb1+ gene was obtained from ICRF after they had interpreted the P1 phage hybridization pattern. Thus, it would seem that one of the ordered libraries is not correct. The ppb1+ gene product is highly conserved relative to other calcineurin homologues, being over 70% identical to S. cerevisiae(6Cyert M.S. Kunisawa R. Kaim D. Thorner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7376-7380Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), human(19Guerini D. Klee C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9183-9187Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and Neurospora crassa(20Higuchi S. Tamura J. Giri P.R. Polli J.W. Kincaid R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18104-18112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) calcineurin homologues within the conserved catalytic domain. Unlike S. cerevisiae, we have no evidence of other CnA homologues in S. pombe based on low stringency hybridization or during our original PCR reactions, where we consistently obtained a single product during amplification when using degenerate oligonucleotides. However, ppb1+ gene disruption was shown not to be lethal (12Yoshida T. Toda T. Yanagida M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1725-1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2D. Plochocka-Zulinska, G. Rasmussen, and C. Rasmussen, unpublished results. This might suggest that there are redundant CnA genes in S. pombe or that this protein phosphatase is not essential for vegetative growth. This would be in contrast to our previous studies in A. nidulans, where we observed that CnA is an essential gene(2Rasmussen C. Garen C. Brining S. Kincaid R.L. Means R.L. Means A.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3917-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), but consistent with studies in the yeast S. cerevisiae(6Cyert M.S. Kunisawa R. Kaim D. Thorner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7376-7380Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Examination of ppb1+ mRNA levels during the cell cycle showed moderate change, similar to what has been observed in A. nidulans, where CnA mRNA levels increased prior to S phase(2Rasmussen C. Garen C. Brining S. Kincaid R.L. Means R.L. Means A.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3917-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Based on this, it is not clear why overexpression of ppb1+ would have such drastic cytological effects as previously reported(12Yoshida T. Toda T. Yanagida M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1725-1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have observed that expression of a truncated, CaM-independent form of mouse CnA in S. pombe has no effects on cells. It is possible, therefore, that overexpression of the full-length protein might have other effects due to binding to CaM or other target proteins. In the previous study, the authors apparently used the normal version of the thiamine-regulated nmt1 promoter present in the plasmid pREP1, and so it is possible that the exceptionally high levels of expression obtained using this promoter might have nonspecific effects. Further, more detailed studies should be able to resolve this issue. We have found that the ppb1+ mRNA is induced in response to nitrogen starvation, which is a primary signal in regulating the mating response in yeast(21Egel R. Nasim A. Young P. Johnson B.F. Molecular Biology of Fission Yeast. Academic Press, Inc., New York1989: 31-73Google Scholar). Several genes are known to be induced by nitrogen starvation, of which a subset has been shown to be dependent on the ste11 transcription factor, itself a nitrogen starvation-induced gene(13Sugimoto A. Iino Y. Maeda T. Watanabe Y. Yamamoto M. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1990-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 22Okazaki N. Okazaki K. Tanaka K. Okayama H. Nucleic Acids. Res. 1991; 19: 7043-7047Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23Miyamoto M. Tanaka K. Okayama H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1873-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 24Sugiyama A. Tanaka K. Okazaki K. Nojima H. Okayama H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1881-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The ste11 gene product regulates expression by a 10-bp cis-acting element (TTCTTTGTTY) known as a TR element. Inspection of the ppb1+ gene promoter revealed that it contains a putative ste11 regulatory element, matching at 9/10 positions. Our observation that nitrogen starvation does not induce ppb1+ mRNA expression in a strain lacking a functional ste11 gene supports the conclusion that the ppb1+ gene does contain a functional TR element and is regulated during nitrogen starvation by the ste11 transcription factor. Lack of this element results in a loss of the nitrogen starvation-dependent increase in expression, clearly showing that nitrogen starvation-induced ppb1+ expression is directly dependent on the ste11 transcription factor. Significantly, a protein phosphatase in S. cerevisiae homologous to the vaccinia virus VH-1 gene product and S. pombe cdc25 protein phosphatase, has also been shown to be induced by nitrogen starvation(25Guan K. Hakes D.J. Wang Y. Park H.-D. Cooper T.G. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12175-12179Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Calcineurin levels also increase in response to treatment of S. cerevisiae cells with the α-factor-mating pheromone(7Cyert M.S. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3460-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The precise role either for the VH-1 phosphatase homologue or the calcineurin gene in the S. pombe mating response is unknown. It has been shown that mating and sporulation are inhibited by at least two protein kinases. The S. pombe cAMP-dependent protein kinase (the pka1 gene of S. pombe) has been previously shown to inhibit ste11 gene expression, in turn inhibiting the expression of ste11-dependent genes required for mating(13Sugimoto A. Iino Y. Maeda T. Watanabe Y. Yamamoto M. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1990-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). A second protein kinase, pat1/ran1, also inhibits mating in S. pombe(26Egel R. Nielson O. Weilguny D. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 369-373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In this case the effect is mediated via the mei2 gene, which is indispensable for the mating response. Thus, the role of protein phosphatases may be to antagonize protein kinases, which might otherwise inhibit the mating response. It will be important to determine if substrates either for pka1 or pat1 kinases are dephosphorylated by calcineurin. In S. cerevisiae, it has been suggested that CnA antagonizes the mating pheromone response pathway. This conclusion is based on the demonstration that cells lacking the cna1 and cna2 genes are unable to recover from α-factor-induced arrest(6Cyert M.S. Kunisawa R. Kaim D. Thorner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7376-7380Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). This apparent disparity in roles for CnA in the two yeast may be a consequence of the different modes of mating. In S. pombe, mating is induced by starvation, while in S. cerevisiae it occurs in rich medium(21Egel R. Nasim A. Young P. Johnson B.F. Molecular Biology of Fission Yeast. Academic Press, Inc., New York1989: 31-73Google Scholar, 27Thorner J. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J.R. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Life Cycle and Inheritance. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1981: 143-180Google Scholar). In addition, the expression of the CnA homologues has not been examined in S. cerevisiae, so it is unknown if CnA expression increases during the mating response as we have shown in S. pombe. It is possible that the role of CnA is as part of a gene expression cascade involved in regulating the expression of genes specific to the sexual cycle. It has been shown in T cells that CnA activity is required for T cell activation(4O'Keefe S.J. Tamura J. Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. Oneill E.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 692-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). In this system, the role of CnA is to dephosphorylate the factor NFAT, which is an upstream regulator of interleukin gene expression(4O'Keefe S.J. Tamura J. Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. Oneill E.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 692-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 5Woodrow M. Clipstone N.A. Cantrell D. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1517-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It is possible, therefore, that CnA is a regulator of gene expression, downstream of ste11, and responsible for controlling other genes essential for the mating response. Consistent with this is the observation that ppb1+ mRNA levels remain elevated during nitrogen starvation, maintaining peak levels 24 h after the switch to nitrogen-poor media. Not all nitrogen starvation-induced genes have this response. The res2+ gene is induced within 6 h by nitrogen starvation, but levels decline by 12 h (23Miyamoto M. Tanaka K. Okayama H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1873-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In addition, ppb1+ mRNA is increased in haploid cells, suggesting that CnA may have a role early in the mating response pathway, prior to formation of the zygote. Finally, it has been shown that the loss of the calcineurin gene causes sterility in S. pombe(12Yoshida T. Toda T. Yanagida M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1725-1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that calcineurin plays an essential role in the sexual cycle of this organism. The observation that ppb1+ mRNA levels are induced by nitrogen starvation and remain elevated for a prolonged period suggests that CnA may be required throughout mating, meiosis, and sporulation. Future studies will examine the specific role of the ppb1+ gene in each of these processes. We thank Dr. Elmar Meier (ICRF) for providing the filters containing the ordered library, doing the computer mapping of our hybridization results, and providing the cosmid containing the S. pombe CnA gene; we also thank Dr. Susan Forsburg (Salk Institute, San Diego) for the ste11- strain."

Biol. Chem. 269, 15588-15596). The nature of the structural elements responsible for recognition and binding of this protein to hsp70 has been studied by examining the folding and potential association with the chaperone of several engineered forms of this enzyme. Whereas pmAspAT and mAspAT bind hsp70 very early during translation, the cytosolic form of this enzyme (cAspAT) does not interact with hsp70. A fusion protein consisting of the mitochondrial presequence peptide attached to the amino terminus of cAspAT associates with hsp70 only after the protein has acquired its native-like conformation, apparently through binding to the presequence exposed on the surface of the folded protein. Deletion of the amino-terminal segment of mAspAT or its replacement with the corresponding domain from the cytosolic isozyme eliminates the cotranslational binding of hsp70 to the mitochondrial protein. We conclude that both the presequence and NH2-terminal region of pmAspAT represent recognition signals for binding of hsp70 to the newly synthesized mitochondrial precursor. Results from competition studies with synthetic peptides support this conclusion. The ability of hsp70 to discriminate between these two highly homologous proteins probably involves the recognition of specific sequence elements in the NH2-terminal portion of the mitochondrial protein and may relate to their separate localization in the cell. A slower folding rate and higher affinity for cytosolic chaperones may represent evolutionary adaptations of translocated mitochondrial proteins to ensure their efficient importation into the organelle.

A slower folding rate and higher affinity for cytosolic chaperones may represent evolutionary adaptations of translocated mitochondrial proteins to ensure their efficient importation into the organelle. INTRODUCTIONMany denatured proteins are able to refold spontaneously which clearly demonstrates that the functional three-dimensional structure of proteins is solely determined by their amino acid sequences (Anfinsen and Scheraga, 1975; Jaenicke, 1991). In order to avoid the competing reactions of aggregation, low temperatures and low protein concentrations are used in most of these in vitro refolding studies. However, in vivo, proteins manage to fold at high protein concentrations and at physiological temperatures (37°C). Apparently, this is accomplished with the collaboration of external factors such as molecular chaperones, which control the process by binding to incompletely folded polypeptides and thereby preventing their aggregation, misfolding or premature folding (for recent reviews, see Gething and Sambrook(1992) and Hendrick and Hartl(1993)). Furthermore, in the intact cell, proteins may initiate folding during biosynthesis on the ribosome and before the polypeptide chain is released into the cytoplasm (Freedman, 1992; Fedorov et al., 1992; Kolb et al., 1994; Fedorov and Baldwin, 1995). This cotranslational folding is probably assisted by molecular chaperones. Chaperones DnaJ (Hendrick et al., 1993) and hsp70 1The abbreviations used are: hsp7070-kDa heat-shock proteinhsp4040-kDa heat-shock proteinAspATaspartate aminotransferasemAspATmitochondrial aspartate aminotransferasepmAspATprecursor to mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferasecAspATcytosolic aspartate aminotransferasepcAspATprecursor chimera to cytosolic aspartate aminotransferasepmcAspATprecursor chimera to cytosolic aspartate aminotransferasemcAspATchimera to cytosolic aspartate aminotransferaseΔ3-30 mAspATmature mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase deletion mutantDEPCdiethyl pyrocarbonatePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisRRLrabbit reticulocyte lysate. (Hansen et al., 1994) have been found associated with newly synthesized proteins still attached to the ribosome. Frydman et al.(1994) recently proposed that firefly luciferase synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) interacts sequentially with hsp40 (a homologue of bacterial DnaJ), hsp70, and TCP-1 containing ring complex. These interactions allow the cotranslational formation of protein domains and contribute to the rapid folding of the newly synthesized enzyme once released from the ribosome (Fedorov and Baldwin, 1995).The extent of folding achieved before the polypeptide chain is released from the ribosome may, however, vary for different proteins. For instance, the precursors of translocated mitochondrial proteins must be maintained in a partially unfolded, loose conformation in the cytosol in order to be imported into the organelle (Verner and Schatz, 1987; Pfanner et al., 1987). Such a delayed folding may not be required for proteins that stay in the cytosol, and therefore they might afford to fold rapidly after synthesis. The mechanism by which cells prevent the “premature” folding of proteins before being translocated across the mitochondrial membranes is not fully understood, but various proteins, including cytosolic hsp70, have been implicated in the process (Chirico et al., 1988; Deshaies et al., 1988; Murakami et al., 1988; Sheffield et al., 1990).The cytosolic and mitochondrial isozymes of aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT) constitute a well suited system to investigate the factors responsible for the selective control of the folding of proteins according to their final destination in the cell. Both enzymes are encoded by the nuclear DNA and synthesized in cytosolic polysomes. The two dimeric proteins share a high degree of sequence homology, an almost superimposable three-dimensional structure, and a basically identical catalytic mechanism (Jansonius and Vincent, 1987). However, they show differences in overall stability (Iriarte et al. 1984c) and isoelectric point (pI). The more stable cytosolic enzyme (cAspAT) has a slightly acidic pI, whereas the mitochondrial form (mAspAT) has a pI of around 9.0 (Martinez-Carrion and Tiemeier, 1967). Furthermore, the folding process of the two isozymes synthesized in cell-free extracts is clearly distinctive. The mitochondrial enzyme, which is synthesized in the cytosol as a precursor protein with a 29-residue amino-terminal extension or presequence peptide (pmAspAT; Altieri et al., 1989; Mattingly et al., 1987), folds relatively slowly after in vitro synthesis in RRL (half-life of ~100 min). By contrast, the highly homologous cytosolic isozyme rapidly acquires a protease-resistant conformation after synthesis in the same cell-free extract (Mattingly et al., 1993a, 1993b). Yet, the spontaneous in vitro refolding of the cytosolic enzyme after denaturation with guanidine hydrochloride is only 2-3-fold faster than the mitochondrial enzyme (Iriarte et al., 1994; Mattingly et al., 1995). It is thus apparent that components of the cell-free extracts affect differently the folding rate of each isozyme.We recently reported that hsp70 interacts with both the precursor and mature forms of mitochondrial AspAT very early during translation in either RRL or wheat germ extract (Lain et al., 1994). In this work we have continued these studies using the cytosolic isozyme of AspAT and several chimeric constructs prepared by exchanging selected sequence fragments between the two isozymes. Both the rate of folding and the interaction with chaperones were analyzed for these diverse AspAT forms synthesized in cytosolic-like environments. We found that the distinct folding rate of the cytosolic and mitochondrial members of this isozyme pair may be determined by the exclusive interaction of chaperones with the mitochondrial form. In addition, this study provides information regarding the targeting signals that allow molecular chaperones to discriminate between highly homologous proteins destined to reside in different intracellular compartments.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsThe peptides and oligonucleotides used in this work were chemically synthesized at the Protein and DNA Core facility of the School of Biological Sciences, University of Missouri-Kansas City.Antibodies against hsp70 were raised in rabbits by hyperimmunization with purified bovine brain hsp70 (Welch and Feramisco, 1985) emulsified with Freund's complete (primary injection) or incomplete adjuvant. IgG were purified using a protein A-agarose (Repligen) column or a DEAE-Affi-Gel blue column (Bio-Rad). Antibodies were used either as whole serum or as purified IgG.Construction of Plasmids Encoding pmcAspAT, mcAspAT, and pcmAspATA complete cDNA-encoding pmcAspAT was assembled from two previously isolated plasmids, pBSKS-4 and pBSKS-6, encoding pmAspAT and pcAspAT, respectively. Construction of pBSKS-4 and pBSKS-6 was as described previously (Mattingly et al., 1993a, 1993b). pBSKS-6 was digested with HpaI and SalI, and the resulting 4787-bp fragment was purified by electroelution. This DNA fragment corresponds to the pBluescript vector and a core of cAspAT lacking the first 33 NH2-terminal residues.pBSKS-4 was used as a template to generate by PCR a cDNA sequence spanning the presequence and the first 30 residues of the NH2-terminal region of pmAspAT. We used the ULTma™ DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer), since it has been described that this enzyme does not incorporate any noncoding bases. 2F. C. Lawyer, personal communication. As a reverse primer CATCTTCTTGCTGTTGGTATCTCTC that matches from position 5′-251 to position 3′-276 of pBSKS-4 (GeneBank™ accession number M18467, Mattingly et al., 1987) was used. As forward primer we used the oligonucleotide CGGAATTAACCCTCACTAAAG which corresponds to the T3 promoter region of pBluescript KS. The PCR product contained the sequence of pBluescript, including KpnI to EcoRI restriction sites from pBluescript KS multiple cloning site, and the nucleotides encoding amino acid residues 1 through 29 of the presequence peptide and the first 30 amino acid residues of the NH2-terminal region of mAspAT. This PCR product was digested with SalI, and the 300-bp DNA fragment was purified by electroelution. The sticky blunt-end fragment was ligated to the 4787-bp fragment described above. The desired recombinant plasmid, pBSKS-9, was selected by PCR screening from randomly selected transformants using the primers described above and was subsequently sequenced.A complete cDNA encoding mcAspAT was assembled from plasmids pBSKS-5, encoding mAspAT, and pBSKS-6, encoding pcAspAT. pBSKS-5 was used as a template for the PCR reaction using the same primers described above. The PCR product included the nucleotides encoding the first 30 amino acids (residues 3-33) from the NH2-terminal region of the mitochondrial mAspAT protein. After digestion with SalI, the 221-bp DNA fragment was purified by electroelution and ligated to the 4787-bp HpaI-SalI fragment from pBSKS-6. The desired recombinant plasmid, pBSKS-10, was selected by PCR screening from randomly selected transformants and was subsequently sequenced.The pcmAspAT chimera was constructed by combining segments of the pBSKS-6 and pBSKS-4 cDNAs using recombinant PCR. The primer PCR1 (GATGATCCCGATCCCCGCAAGGTTAACCTGGGAGTTGGTG-CCTA) defines the splice point between the two proteins. It encodes the last 8 amino acids of the 63-residue amino-terminal pcAspAT peptide to be attached to the mAspAT core protein; the underlined nucleotides encode pmAspAT, beginning at nucleotide 276 which begins the codon for amino acid 63. Primer PCR2 (ATGTCAAAGAATGCGAAGAGAT) is complementary to nucleotides 826-805 in the coding strand for pmAspAT. As PCR3 we used the primer corresponding to the T3 promoter region of pBluescript KS indicated before; PCR4 (AACCTTGCGGGGATCG) is complementary to nucleotides 314-291 which encode the last 8 amino acids of the peptide to be attached to the mAspAT core. The two fragments were freed of excess primers by ultrafiltration, aliquots of each were combined, and another amplification using PCR3 and PCR2 was performed. The resulting product was digested with NdeI and PstI and the desired 340 bp was gel-purified. This fragment was ligated to NdeI- and PstI-digested pBSKS-4 to yield pBSKS-8. Further information on these constructs is available from the authors upon request.In Vitro Transcription and TranslationmRNAs were prepared by in vitro T3 RNA polymerase transcription of BamHI-linearized pBSKS templates, with the exception of cAspAT, where T7 RNA polymerase was used, using the mCAP kit from Stratagene. The different proteins were synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (20 min at 30°C) essentially according to the protocol provided by the supplier (Promega) using 25 μg/ml of mRNA and [35S]methionine as the radiolabeled amino acid. Construction and selection of pBSKS-4 pBSKS-5, pBSKS-6, pBSKS-7, and pGEM-3 were described previously (Mattingly et al. 1993a, 1993b). Translation reactions were stopped by chilling on ice and adding cycloheximide to a final concentration of 50 μM.Immunoprecipitation from the Translation ReactionProteins were synthesized in vitro as described above. Immunoprecipitation reactions of 35S-labeled translation products contained 5 μl of translation reaction, 40 μl of rabbit polyclonal anti-hsp70, and 55 μl of phosphate-buffered saline buffer, 0.1% Triton, 4.8 mM EDTA. Amounts of sera and translation product were chosen based on appropriate titrations (Lain et al., 1994). The same amount of preimmune serum was used as control. Immunoprecipitation of the translation products was performed as described before (Lain et al., 1994). The amount of radiolabeled translation product immunoprecipitated is expressed as percentage relative to the total amount of protein that is synthesized and is the average of two determinations.MiscellaneousSDS-PAGE was performed with the Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN II apparatus using the discontinuous buffer system of Laemmli(1970). Unless otherwise noted, 12% polyacrylamide separating gels approximately 5 cm in length were used. The gels were fixed for 30 min in 10% acetic acid, 20% methanol, dried (2 h, 80°C), and radioactive bands were detected and quantitated after at least overnight exposure using the Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager™. The PhosphorImager response is proportional to the concentration of radiolabeled protein present as independently assessed using a standard curve of 35S-labeled purified pmAspAT. Protein folding of in vitro synthesized proteins was assessed by monitoring the acquisition of trypsin resistance as described previously (Lain et al., 1994). Data are expressed as the percentage of total labeled protein present (aliquot not treated with trypsin) that has become trypsin-resistant (aliquot treated with trypsin).RESULTSFolding and Interaction with hsp70 of mAspAT and cAspAT Engineered at Their NH2-terminal RegionEarlier studies on the folding of the two isozymes of AspAT in cell-free extracts (Mattingly et al., 1993a, 1993b; Lain et al., 1994) suggested that both the presequence peptide and amino-terminal regions of pmAspAT might be involved in the control of its folding and interaction with hsp70. To test this hypothesis, we prepared different protein constructs in which the structural elements in the mitochondrial enzyme that we suspected were responsible for hsp70 recognition were either deleted or replaced with the corresponding sequences from the cytosolic isozyme. Conversely, the presequence and the NH2-terminal region of the mitochondrial enzyme were introduced into the structure of the cytosolic counterpart. Fig. 1 shows a box diagram of the eight different proteins we have used in this study: pmAspAT, the authentic mitochondrial precursor, and mAspAT, the mature-like protein; Δ3-30 mAspAT, a deletion mutant lacking the first 28 residues of the NH2-terminal region; cAspAT, the cytosolic isozyme and pcAspAT, an artificial precursor protein consisting of the cytosolic isozyme with the mitochondrial presequence fused to its amino terminus; pcmAspAT, a chimera in which the NH2-terminal region of the mature mitochondrial protein has been replaced with the corresponding NH2-terminal region from its cytosolic counterpart; and pmcAspAT, a cytosolic enzyme containing the presequence and the 30-residue NH2-terminal segment from the mitochondrial protein. mcAspAT is the mature-like form of pmcAspAT, that is, the cytosolic enzyme with the amino-terminal segment from the mitochondrial isozyme.The various protein forms were synthesized in RRL at 30°C, as previously reported (Lain et al., 1994), using [35S]methionine as the radiolabeled amino acid. All of them migrated in SDS-PAGE gels according to their expected molecular weights (data not shown). The constructs which contain the core component from the cytosolic isozyme, cAspAT, pcAspAT, pmcAspAT, and mcAspAT, are more stable in RRL after synthesis at 30°C than their mitochondrial counterparts (Mattingly et al., 1993b; data not shown). Furthermore, the yield of protein synthesis for pmcAspAT and mcAspAT is about 3-fold higher than for the mitochondrial and cytosolic wild type proteins. The reasons for this difference in translation efficiencies are unknown.The association of the different constructs with hsp70 during protein synthesis in RRL (Fig. 2) or upon further incubation following termination of the translation reaction (Fig. 3), was followed by analyzing at different times the total amount of protein present and the amount of radioactive translation product coimmunoprecipitating with anti-hsp70 antibodies. As shown before (Lain et al., 1994), both the precursor and mature forms of mitochondrial AspAT coimmunoprecipitate with hsp70 at the early stages of the translation reaction. The fraction of pmAspAT and mAspAT associated with hsp70 decreases rapidly as translation progresses (data included in Fig. 2A for comparison purposes), suggesting a “transient” association of the translation product with the chaperone. The amount of pmAspAT coimmunoprecipitating with hsp70 increases again when the translation reaction is incubated at 20°C following completion of protein synthesis (Fig. 3B). This “stable” reassociation of hsp70 with pmAspAT is dependent on the presence of the presequence and parallels the acquisition of protease resistance by the translation product (Fig. 3A). Apparently, hsp70 binds tightly to the presequence exposed on the surface of the folded protein. By contrast, no coimmunoprecipitation of cAspAT with hsp70 antibodies could be detected at the earliest times of the protein synthesis reaction that we were able to analyze (Fig. 2B). This result indicates that there may be selectivity in the interaction of even highly homologous proteins with chaperones.Figure 2Association of hsp70 with in vitro translated mAspAT and cAspAT constructs during protein synthesis. Immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled translation products after initiation of protein synthesis was done by removing, at different times after initiation of translation, one 2.5-μl aliquot and one 5.0-μl aliquot from RRL translation reactions programmed with mRNA either for mAspAT (A) or cAspAT (B) variants. After addition of cycloheximide to stop protein synthesis, the 2.5-μl aliquot was used to estimate the amount of protein synthesized at each time, and the 5-μl aliquot was subjected to immunoprecipitation with polyclonal anti-hsp70 antibodies (Lain et al., 1994). The amount of radiolabeled translation product synthesized or immunoprecipitated was determined from the intensity of the corresponding radioactive band following SDS-PAGE analysis of the samples and exposure to a PhosphorImager™ screen. The fraction of translation product immunoprecipitated is expressed as percentage relative to the total amount of protein that is synthesized and is the average of two determinations. Symbols are as follows: A, •, pmAspAT; ○, mAspAT; ■, Δ3-30 mAspAT; and □, pcmAspAT; B, ▿, pmcAspAT; ▲, mcAspAT or cAspAT; ▵, pcAspAT.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Trypsin resistance and association with hsp70 of different mAspAT and cAspAT protein forms synthesized in RRL after further incubation at 20°C. Proteins were synthesized in RRL as described under “Experimental Procedures” (20 min, 30°C). After stopping protein synthesis by addition of cycloheximide and chilling on ice, the translation reactions were transferred to a 20°C water bath. Aliquots were removed either immediately (t = 0 min) or after 240-min incubation (t = 240 min) and analyzed for acquisition of trypsin resistance (A) and for coimmunoprecipitation with hsp70 antibodies (B) as described previously (Lain et al., 1994). Please notice that the zero time (t = 0 min) in this figure follows the last time point in Fig. 2 immediately after arresting protein synthesis. Data are expressed as the percentage of total labeled pmAspAT present (aliquot not treated with trypsin) that has become trypsin-resistant (aliquot treated with trypsin) (A) or that immunoprecipitates with hsp70 antibodies (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further asses the role of the presequence peptide in the interaction with hsp70, we studied whether the fusion protein pcAspAT, which has the mitochondrial presequence fused to the amino-terminal region of the cytosolic protein, associates with hsp70. At the early stages (4 min) of the translation reaction, no protein was found to immunoprecipitate with hsp70 antibodies. However, as the translation reaction proceeds, the amount of pcAspAT coimmunoprecipitating with hsp70 progressively increases (Fig. 2B) and remains steady during further incubation of the translation product after stopping protein synthesis (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained with pmcAspAT, another cytosolic construct containing the presequence peptide. Since folding of these cytosolic-like proteins is almost completed by the time the translation reaction is interrupted (Fig. 3A), this raise in stable hsp70 binding probably reflects the increase in accessibility of the presequence peptide as the translation product acquires its native conformation, as mentioned before for the natural mitochondrial precursor.Thus, it is clear that the presequence of pmAspAT represents a “linear epitope” for recognition by and binding to hsp70, at least in the folded precursor proteins. However, and quite paradoxically, the presence of this sequence apparently is not sufficient for binding of this chaperone to the polypeptide chain while it is emerging from the ribosome. Additional recognition signals in the mature portion of the mitochondrial protein might be responsible for this early interaction. One possible candidate is the NH2-terminal region of the mature protein which in the native enzyme interacts with the surface of the other subunit and contributes to the stability of the dimer (McPhalen et al., 1992). This NH2-terminal segment shows a very low similarity score when compared with the corresponding region of cAspAT (Mattingly et al., 1993b). As shown in Fig. 2A, deletion of the 28-residue NH2-terminal fragment of mAspAT (Δ3-30 mAspAT), or its substitution with the corresponding sequence from cAspAT (pcmAspAT), dramatically decreased the amount of translation product immunoprecipitating with hsp70 antibodies during the initial stages of the translation reaction. Binding of hsp70 to the presequence-containing pcmAspAT did not increase either upon incubation at 20°C after arresting translation (Fig. 3B), probably because this protein, like Δ3-30 mAspAT, is unable to acquire a folded, protease-resistant conformation (Fig. 3A). According to these results, the NH2-terminal peptide of mAspAT appears to be essential not only for binding to hsp70 but also for productive folding of the newly synthesized polypeptide chain.In order to clarify the involvement of the NH2-terminal region of mAspAT on its interaction with hsp70, we examined the consequences of introducing this mAspAT region into the NH2-terminal end of cAspAT. The hypothesis underlying the design of these experiments was that if that sequence constitutes a linear recognition site for hsp70, it should be able to render the otherwise inert cAspAT a “substrate” for the chaperone, as the presequence does for the folded protein. Yet, the data presented in Fig. 2B show that the level of immunoprecipitation of mcAspAT early during translation is identical to that of wild type cAspAT. When the NH2-terminal sequence was inserted together with the presequence peptide (pmcAspAT), the levels of coimmunoprecipitation at the initial translation times were still identical to the corresponding wild type control (pcAspAT in this case). Only after incubation following the end of translation, this presequence-containing protein appeared in a complex with hsp70 (Fig. 3B). This association correlated once more with the appearance of trypsin resistant species (Fig. 3A). Thus, the presequence and the NH2-terminal peptides of pmAspAT by themselves do not contain enough information to transform the cAspAT chains emerging from the ribosome into a target recognizable by hsp70. Either additional targeting signals are required for binding or the rate of folding of the protein being synthesized determines the accessibility of the potential binding sites to interaction with the chaperone.Effect of Synthetic Presequence and NH2-terminal Peptides on AspAT Synthesis, Folding, and Binding to hsp70The involvement of the presequence and NH2-terminal peptide of pmAspAT on its interaction to hsp70 was also investigated by analyzing the effect of synthetic peptides corresponding to these sequence regions on the binding of in vitro translated protein to the chaperone. As a control, we determined first if protein translation itself was affected by the synthetic peptides. To account for the small dilution factor introduced in the reaction mixture by addition of the peptide aliquot, we ran as a control a reaction that had received an equivalent volume of diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water. As shown in Fig. 4, some very interesting and somehow unexpected results were obtained. First of all, the 1-19 NH2-terminal peptide from the cytosolic enzyme did not interfere with the synthesis of either pmAspAT or cAspAT (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, the 1-23 NH2-terminal peptide from the mitochondrial isozyme caused a partial decrease in the yield of protein synthesis. This inhibitory effect was not specific for the mitochondrial enzyme as the synthesis of cAspAT was almost equally affected. But the most dramatic effect was observed with the presequence peptide. At comparable concentrations, it almost completely abolished protein synthesis of the two AspAT isozymes and of the brome mosaic virus protein used as control. These findings clearly indicate that the presence of an excess of the presequence peptide interferes with the normal functioning of the protein synthesis machinery of RRL.Figure 4Effect of cAspAT and pmAspAT NH2-terminal peptides on the yield of protein synthesis in RRL. Approximately 74 μM final concentration of the different synthetic peptides was added to the RRL translation reactions before initiation of protein synthesis by the addition of mRNA coding for pmAspAT (A), cAspAT (B), or brome mosaic virus (BMV) protein. The same amount in volume of DEPC water was added to the control reactions in the absence of peptides. At different times, aliquots were taken and, after SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, the amount of protein synthesized at each time was estimated from the amount of radiolabel present in the corresponding electrophoretic band.

Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 309-324Google Scholar). As the fusion protein proceeds through the secretory pathway, it may undergo extensive post-translational modifications (e.g. glycosylation of specific asparagine (Asn) and serine or threonine (Ser/Thr) residues(2Herscovics A. Orlean P. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 540-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 3Caplan S. Green R. Rocco J. Kurjan J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 627-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). These modifications may be important for efficient secretion of the protein(3Caplan S. Green R. Rocco J. Kurjan J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 627-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, very little is known specifically about how post-translational modifications (especially O-glycosylation) affect the ability of leaders to export proteins. Therefore, the purpose of this work has been to determine if and how cell physiology and growth conditions influence post-translational modifications of a secretion leader derived from the signal peptide and primarily the third domain of the BAR1 gene product of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This secretion leader has been used to export heterologous proteins (e.g. platelet-derived growth factor and insulin precursors (4MacKay V.L. Yip C. Welch S. Gilbert T. Seidel P. Grant F. O'Hara P.

The most common post-translational modifications in S. cerevisiae are N- and O-glycosylation. Oligosaccharides consisting of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 may be transferred as a unit to specific asparagine residues (Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr, where Xaa can be any amino acid except Pro; (6Kukuruzinska M.A. Bergh M.L.E. Jackson B.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 915-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar)) in nascent peptides in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. These oligosaccharides are trimmed in the endoplasmic reticulum to generate a Man8GlcNAc2 intermediate, which in yeast is usually elongated in the Golgi to yield species of Man9-14GlcNAc2(6Kukuruzinska M.A. Bergh M.L.E.

On secreted glycoproteins from yeast, some of these core oligosaccharides become further elongated by addition of an α1,6-linked mannose and its extension to form an α1,6-linked backbone and by addition of short α1,2-linked side chains, which in turn may get the addition of α1,3-linked side chains to form an outer chain of ≥50 mannoses (hyperglycosylation)(6Kukuruzinska M.A. Bergh M.L.E. Jackson B.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 915-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Additional mannose residues in phosphodiester linkages may also be present in the core and in the outer chain(8Hernández L.M. Ballou L. Alvarado E. Gillece-Castro B.L. Burlingame A.L. Ballou C.E. J.

Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 440-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) has isolated mnn mutants that are defective in mannan biosynthesis. The mnn1 mutation results in the synthesis of N- and O-linked structures (N- and O-structures) that lack terminal α1,3-linked mannose attached to mannose in α1,2-linkage, and the mnn9 mutants lack the ability to elongate the α1,6-linked backbone of the N-structures(10Ballou C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 440-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Due to these mutations, the mnn9 strain primarily makes N-structures of Man11-13GlcNAc2, and the mnn1 mnn9 mutants make N-structures of mainly Man10GlcNAc2 units along with a small amount of Man11GlcNAc2 units(10Ballou C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 440-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The MNN1 gene encodes the α1,3-mannosyltransferase(11Graham T.R. Verostek M.F. MacKay V. Trimble R. Emr S.D.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and the MNN9 gene is believed to encode a protein involved in maintaining a Golgi apparatus with functioning mannosyltransferases (13Yip C.L. Welch S.K. Klebl F. Gilbert T. Seidel P. Grant F.J. O'Hara P.J. MacKay V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2723-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).

Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The first sugar transfer of mannosyl residues to Ser or Thr is catalyzed in the endoplasmic reticulum and requires dolichol-phosphate-mannose as an intermediate(15Haselbeck A. Tanner W. FEBS Lett. 1983; 158: 335-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The additional mannosyl residues (maximally 3-4) are transferred from GDP-Man(15Haselbeck A. Tanner W. FEBS Lett. 1983; 158: 335-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It is uncertain whether the second α1,2-linked mannose is added in the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi(15Haselbeck A. Tanner W. FEBS Lett. 1983; 158: 335-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 16Trueheart J. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). An additional one to two α1,3-linked mannoses may then be added to the three α1,2-linked mannoses in the Golgi. O-Structures with one to five mannoses are expected on proteins expressed in the wild-type and the mnn9 strains(2Herscovics A. Orlean P. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 540-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 10Ballou C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 440-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 18Yamada T. Uyeda A. Otsu M. Matsushima M. Sekiguchi K. Kikuchi M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3885-3889Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Addition of the first and probably the second α1,3-linked mannose requires the MNN1 gene (10Ballou C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 440-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Therefore, the expected O-structures on proteins expressed in the mnn1 and mnn1 mnn9 strains have one to three α1,2-linked mannoses(10Ballou C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 440-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The DNA sequence of the secretion leader used in this work has three potential N-linked (Asn) and 54 potential O-linked (Ser/Thr) glycosylation sites (see Fig. 1) and has been expressed in wild-type and in mnn1, mnn9, and mnn1 mnn9 glycosylation mutant strains of S. cerevisiae. Post-translational modifications of the BSD have been analyzed with respect to site selectivity by peptide mapping, sequencing, and size of O-structures by electrospray (ES) liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS). An unusual phosphorylated post-translational modification was investigated by ES tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and elementary analysis. Four different S. cerevisiae strains were used in this study, one wild-type for glycosylation and three with mnn mutations: ZM137 (MATa/MATα pep4-3/pep4-3 leu2-3, 112/leu2-3, 112 Δtpi1::LEU2/Δtpi1::LEU2), XCY93-1C (MATα ade2 leu2-3, 112 ura3-52 Δpep4::URA3 Δmnn1::URA3 suc2-Δ9), ZY400 (MATaade2 leu2-3, 112 ura3-52 Δpep4::URA3 Δmnn9::URA3 suc2-Δ9), and XCY93-1D (MATaade2 SUPX leu2-3, 112 ura3-52 Δpep4::URA3 Δmnn9::URA3 Δmnn1::URA3 suc2-Δ9). These strains were transformed either with an expression plasmid for the BSD (pZY93 for strain ZM137 and pSW327 for the others) or with a control vector (pRPOT for ZM137 and YEp13 for the others). In both plasmids (constructed by C. Yip and S. Welch, ZymoGenetics), the BSD coding sequence is under the control of the promoter from the TPI1 gene and contains a C-terminal substance P epitope tag for immunological determination(19Munro S. Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 3087-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 20MacKay V.L. Welch S.K. Insley M.Y. Manney T.R. Holly J. Saari G.C. Parker M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The transformants were grown in fermentation medium (FM) 1 (7.5 g/liter yeast extract (Difco), 14.0 g/liter (NH4)2SO4, 2.7 g/liter KH2PO4, 2.0 g/liter MgSO4•7H2O, 125 μg/liter biotin, 2.0 mg/liter thiamine, 2.0 mg/liter pyridoxine, 37.5 mg/liter inositol, 37.5 mg/liter calcium pantothenate, 1.5 mg/liter niacinamide, 250 μg/liter folic acid, 0.5 mg/liter riboflavin, 2.5 mg/liter choline chloride, 6.8 g/liter ZnCl2, 54 mg/liter FeCl3•6H2O, 19.1 mg/liter MnCl2•4H2O, 2.2 mg/liter CuSO4.5H2O, 2.6 mg/liter CoCl2, 0.62 mg/liter H3BO3, 21 μg/liter (NH4)6Mo7O24.4H2O, 21 μg/liter KI, 0.1 ml of concentrated HCl, and 2.0% (w/v) D-glucose in tap water). In fermentations of the wild-type, mnn1 mnn9, and mnn9 strains, 0.75 MD-sorbitol was added to the medium. Strains carrying the mnn9 mutation require the presence of D-sorbitol to osmotically stabilize the cells during growth(10Ballou C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 440-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Tanks of 60 liters of medium were inoculated with 3% (v/v) wild-type or mnn1 mnn9 transformants, and the cells were fermented at 30°C for 48 h. D-Glucose was fed continuously during the fermentation at a rate of 1.5 g/liter/h, and pH was kept at 4.5 with ammonia. The mnn9 and mnn1 transformants were grown at 30°C for 48 h in Fernbach flasks of 10 × 1200 ml of FM1 + D-sorbitol and 6 × 1200 ml of FM1, respectively. Additional D-glucose was added to the cultures to a final concentration of 2% (w/v) after 24 h. Wild-type transformants were also grown in 1200 ml of FM2 containing 40 g/liter yeast extract (Difco), 20 g/liter Bacto-peptone (Difco), 0.1 ml/liter pluronic acid (100% v/v), 18 g/liter D-glucose, pH 6.5 at 30°C. At 90 h, 5% (v/v) glacial acetic acid was added to the medium, and the fermentation was stopped after 96 h. BSD from a wild-type strain will be designated BSDwt, a similar nomenclature is used for the other strains. The number 2 in the name (e.g. BSDwt2-N) indicates that the strain has been grown in FM2, and the letter N indicates that the N-structures have been enzymatically removed. For BSDwt and BSDwt-N, the culture supernatant of 60 lilters was filtered through a 0.45 μm2 polypropylene Gelman filter, concentrated to 1.5 liters on a hollow fiber system (UFP-5-C-55, cut off 5000 Da, A/G Technology Corporations), precipitated by ethanol(20MacKay V.L.

A volume of 40 ml of the resuspended precipitate (BSDwt) containing 10 mM dithiothreitol was fractionated on a Sephacryl column (4.0 × 86 cm S-200, HR; Pharmacia) equilibrated in 0.15 M NaCl and 5 mM EDTA. After addition of 16 ml of 0.5 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2, 80 ml of resuspended ethanol precipitate was deglycosylated by incubation at 37°C for 2 days with 3 units of endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (Boehringer Mannheim). This batch (BSDwt-N) was then fractionated as described for BSDwt. The two batches were individually desalted on a reversed phase HPLC C-4 column (2.2 × 25 cm, Vydac) by elution with a gradient of 5-35% (v/v) acetonitrile (ACN) in H2O and 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The samples were lyophilized and stored at −20°C. BSDwt2-N was purified from 500 ml of broth after 96 h of fermentation as described for the BSDwt-N, except that BSDwt2-N was concentrated on an Amicon cell (cut off 50 kDa, Amicon) instead of the hollow fiber system. BSDmnn1 mnn9 was purified as the BSDwt sample, but the broth was concentrated on a 1.5-liter Amberchrom CG71-md column (TosoHaas). After loading the sample, the column was washed with 20 liters of 0.1 M sodium acetate, 2 mM EDTA, and NaCl (to 15 millisiemens/cm), pH 4.5, followed by 8 liters of 2 mM EDTA. The sample was eluted with 1050 ml of 40% (v/v) ethanol in 2 mM EDTA and ethanol precipitated(20MacKay V.L. Welch S.K. Insley M.Y. Manney T.R. Holly J. Saari G.C. Parker M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). BSDmnn1, BSDmnn1-N, and BSDmnn9 were purified as described for BSDwt-N, but after the HPLC C-4 column, the samples were individually separated on a reversed phase HPLC C-18 column (0.46 × 25 cm, Vydac) eluted with a gradient from 2-41% (v/v) ACN in H2O and 0.05% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. BSDmnn9 was further separated on a divinyl benzene column (0.46 × 50 cm, PLRP-S 1000 Å, Polymer Laboratories) with a similar gradient. BSDmnn1-N and BSDmnn9 were then individually purified by gel filtration on a TSK SW3000 column (0.75 × 30 cm, Hewlett Packard) by elution with 0.15 M NaCl and 5 mM dithiothreitol, concentrated on an HPLC C-18 column, vacuum rotor evaporated, and stored at −20°C. The BSD batches were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar, 22Merril C.R. Goldman D. Sedman S.A.

N-terminal sequences were determined by automated Edman degradation for the BSD batches and several peptides from peptide mapping of the BSD using an Applied Biosystems model 475 or model 476A(24Edman P. Begg G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 1: 80-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (2410) Google Scholar). All samples, except BSDmnn1, BSDmnn1-N, and BSDmnn9, were analyzed by amino acid analysis through hydrolysis of known volumes containing 0.5-0.8 nmol of protein with 6 M HCl/2% phenol for 22 h at 112°C(25Moore S. Stein W.H. Methods Enzymol. 1963; 6: 819-831Crossref Scopus (1564) Google Scholar); results were not corrected for loss during hydrolysis. Approximately 0.2 amidase unit of lysyl endopeptidase from Achromobacter protease I (lysyl endopeptidase, Wako Chemicals U. S. A., Inc.) was added per 1.0 mg of BSD glycoprotein dissolved in 0.9 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl and 6.5 mM dithiothreitol, pH 8.9. The sample was left at 4°C for 92-144 h, and then the digestion was stopped with 50 μl of glacial acetic acid/ml sample. The glycopeptides were chromatographed on reversed phase HPLC C-18 columns (0.46 × 25 cm or 0.21 × 25 cm, Vydac) eluted in gradients from 2-80% (v/v) ACN in H2O and 0.05% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The analysis was performed using an API III liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometer fitted with an articulated ion spray plenum and an atmospheric pressure ionization source (Perkin Elmer Sciex) and a scanning range of m/z 0-2400 Da(26Covey T.R. Huang E.C. Henion J.D. Anal. Chem. 1991; 63: 1193-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The instrument was tuned and calibrated with the singly charged ammonium adduct ions of polypropylene glycols under unit resolution. The orifice value was usually held at 65 V to avoid O-glycosidic cleavage of the glycopeptides. In ES MS analysis, the samples were introduced at a flow rate of 5 μl/min and analyzed in the mass range of m/z 600-2400 Da at a step size of 0.1-0.2 atomic mass unit and a dwell time of 0.5-0.75 ms. In comparative peptide mapping by ES LC/MS, 40-200 μg of BSD digestion mixtures were separated on a reversed phase HPLC C-18 column (0.21 × 25 cm, Vydac), typically with a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min (split to 30 μl/min flow and infused onto the ES MS). The following gradient was used: t = 0 min, ACN in H2O = 2% (v/v); t = 80 min, ACN = 17.6% (v/v); t = 110, ACN = 41% (v/v); t = 120, ACN = 80% (v/v). In ES MS/MS analysis, the fractions from a peptide digest of the BSDwt-N were introduced at a flow rate of 5 μl/min and analyzed in the mass range of m/z 0-1800 Da at a step size of 0.1-0.2 atomic mass unit and a dwell time of 0.5-0.75 ms. The collision gas was a mixture of argon and nitrogen (90:10). Intact BSDmnn1 mnn9 and BSDwt-N as well as glycopeptides of BSDwt-N collected from a peptide digest were analyzed by Charles Evans & Associates on a reflector Vision 2000 MALDI MS time of flight mass analyzer (Finnigan)(27Karas M. Hillenkamp F. Anal. Chem. 1988; 60: 2299-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (4764) Google Scholar). The mass range was 500-500,000 Da. A total of 5 pmol BSDmnn1 mnn9, dissolved in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid to l0 pmol/μl and mixed 1:1 with the 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid matrix, was analyzed with 5 pmol of apomyoglobin as an external calibrant. BSDwt-N was analyzed the same way. Lyophilized fractions from a peptide digest of 1.0 mg of BSDwt-N were redissolved in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, mixed 1:2 with the above matrix, and analyzed with renin substrate and human insulin as internal standards. Phosphorus and sulfur were analyzed by inductively coupled MS on an Elan 5000 A (Perkin Elmer Sciex) in collaboration with Thomas Chapin (University of Washington). The instrument was blanked against 1% (v/v) HNO3 in H2O and calibrated with solutions of (NH4)2SO4 and KH2PO4 in 1% (v/v) HNO3 in H2O. The samples were analyzed in positive ion peak hop mode where the mass analyzer dwells at m/z 31 for 1000 ms and then 34 m/z for 1000 ms, etc. The samples were introduced with a continuous flow nebulizer at a flow rate of 1 ml/min(28Jiang S.-J. Houk R.S. Spectrochim. Acta Part B At. Spectrosc. 1988; 43: 405-411Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Intact BSDwt-N, BSDmnn1 mnn9, and fractions from a peptide digest of BSDwt-N were analyzed. A peptide (LVNIQTDGSISGAK) corresponding to lysyl endopeptidase peptide 3 of the BSD was synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 431A peptide synthesizer using Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl) chemistry and standard cycles for 1-hydroxybenzotriazole activation(29Merrifield R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 2149-2154Crossref Scopus (6575) Google Scholar, 30Wang S.-S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1973; 95: 1328-1333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Konig W. Geiger R. Chem. Ber. 1970; 103: 788-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1893) Google Scholar). The product was purified by reversed phase HPLC, and the identity was confirmed by ES MS analysis and Edman degradation. BSD preparations purified from each of the four yeast transformant strains were contaminated with the heat shock protein Hsp150p(32Russo P. Kalkkinen N. Sareneva H. Paakkola J. Karkarow M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3671-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Based on amino acid analysis and the yield of the first amino acid in Edman degradation (data not shown), the following yields (mg) and purities (%) were determined for the different preparations: BSDmnn1 mnn9 (0.4 mg/liter, 89%), BSDwt-N (51.0 mg/liter, 93%), BSDwt (6.2 mg/liter, 83%), and BSDwt2-N (67.3 mg/liter, 81%). The yields and purities of the remaining batches were as follows: BSDmnn1 (0.5 mg/liter, 28%), BSDmnn1-N (0.04 mg/liter, 89%), and BSDmnn9 (0.006 mg/liter, 52%), assuming that 1 mg/ml is equal to 1.0 on the UV absorbance at 280 nm. Hsp150p was more difficult to remove from the BSDmnn1 BSDmnn1-N, and BSDmnn9 batches. The proposed signal peptide of the bar secretion leader contains 24 amino acid residues(20MacKay V.L. Welch S.K. Insley M.Y. Manney T.R. Holly J. Saari G.C. Parker M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence analysis of purified BSD confirmed that the signal peptide in all batches is processed between amino acids Ala0 and Leu1 (Fig. 1) as expected from von Heijne's rule(33von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar). The polypeptide has a calculated molecular mass of 16,766 Da. However, based on MALDI MS the molecular mass range of the BSDmnn1 mnn9 was 35,000-48,000 Da peaking at 44,317 Da, and the range of the BSDwt-N was 30,000-40,000 Da peaking at 38,949 Da. On an immunoblot, the molecular masses were as follows: BSDwt = BSDmnn1 (127,000-208,500 Da) > BSDmnn9 (73,4000-91,900 Da) > BSDmnn1 mnn9 (61,000-70,400 Da) > BSDwt-N = BSDwt2-N = BSDmnn1-N = BSDmnn9-N = BSDmnn1 mnn9-N (40,500-54,000 Da). Theoretically, lysyl endopeptidase should cleave the BSD (referred to as Leu1 to Met161) into 8 peptides (P1-P8; Fig. 1). Peptide 2 consists of Lys26 only; the rest were glycopeptides and will be referred to as (GP1-GP8). Separation of the digestion mixtures on a reversed phase HPLC C-18 column gave reproducible but complex UV-215 absorbance traces with broad overlapping peaks, as shown for BSDwt-N in Fig. 2. The cleavage site between Lys105 and Pro106 was not always cleaved. In general, GPm,n indicates that glycopeptide GPm and GPn are not cleaved, so in this case the above glycopeptide is designated as GP6,7. Additionally, an unexpected cleavage site between Leu11 and Ser12 was observed in BSDwt-N, giving rise to GP1″ (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). In Edman degradation data, the repetitive yield for each sequence was calculated based on a regression analysis of the more stable amino acids in each sequence (Ala, Glu, Gly, Ile, Leu, Lys, Phe, and Val), and the average repetitive yield was 91% for all the sequences from the BSD. The post-translationally modified amino acids were identified as missing PTH-derivatives in Edman degradation. The obtained yield (Yn) in percentage of the expected yield (Ye) (based on the regression analysis) was calculated for every PTH-Ser, PTH-Thr, and PTH-Asn in each sequence. PTH-Ser and PTH-Thr are unstable. Additionally, the position of Ser, Thr, and Asn in a sequence and the amount of material used in Edman degradation both affect the yields of these amino acids. These effects were tested with a synthetic lysyl endopeptidase Peptide 3, where the Yn in percentages of Ye were 62, 26, and 29% of PTH-Thr32, PTH-Ser35, and PTH-Ser37, respectively (Fig. 1). Each glycopeptide was analyzed several times due to overlapping peaks. A Ser or Thr was categorized as highly O-glycosylated if the Yn of that residue in all analyses was less than 10% and the increase in yield (Yn - Yn-1) was less than 5% of Ye, moderately O-glycosylated if Yn<25% of Ye, and poorly O-glycosylated if 25% < Yn < 70% of Ye. Potential N-glycosylation sites were categorized similarly. The results of Edman degradation for both BSDmnn1 mnn9 and BSDwt-N are shown in Fig. 1. Because not every fraction was analyzed, the summary in the figure is an indication of the glycosylation rather than its absolute quantitation. The BSDmnn1 mnn9 had 30 highly, 13 moderately, and 10 poorly O-glycosylated sites of the total 54 Ser and Thr, respectively. Asn19 and Asn89 residues were moderately N-glycosylated, and Asn124 were poorly N-glycosylated. The BSDwt-N had 35 highly, 8 moderately, and 11 poorly O-glycosylated sites, respectively. Asn19 and Asn124 residues seemed to be highly N-glycosylated, and Asn89 seemed to be moderately N-glycosylated. Differences in O-glycosylation sites on BSD expressed in the mnn1 mnn9 strain and the wild-type strain were apparent on 22 sites (Fig. 1), with the most pronounced differences seen at Ser37, Thr100, and Ser37. However, there was no clear pattern in the extent of O-glycosylation on any of the 22 sites. If there was a pattern as to the extent of N-glycosylation, the BSDwt-N had a higher amount of Asn involved in N-glycosyl linkages than the BSDmnn1 mnn9. ES MS analysis of different fractions from the peptide maps showed that they contained the expected heterogeneous glycopeptides. For example, fraction 27 from BSDwt-N contained GP5 with 1 N-acetylglucosamine and 29-33 mannoses (referred to as P5+1GlcNAc+(29-33)Man) and GP5 with 1 N-acetylglucosamine and 28-33 mannoses and an additional 80 mass units. This additional mass could represent a sulfate group (S) or phosphate group (P) (34Krishna R.G. Wold F. Imahori K. Sakiyama F. Methods in Protein Sequence Analysis. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1993: 167-172Crossref Google Scholar) (referred to as P5+1GlcNAc+(28-33)Man+P/S), as discussed in the next section. As the heterogeneity of a glycopeptide varied with respect to the number of N-acetylglucosamines, mannoses, and a phosphate group (or sulfate group), in the following section, a distribution will refer to a given glycopeptide that has a particular number of GlcNAcs and a phosphate group (or sulfate group) across a range of mannoses (e.g. P5+1GlcNAc+(28-33)Man+P/S). Each of the “members” within the distribution will be referred to as a variant of that distribution (e.g. P5+1GlcNAc+28Man+P/S). Each glycopeptide variant eluted with decreasing mass as a function of time, as expected (35Carr S.A. Huddleston M.J. Bean M.F. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 183-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). All the glycopeptides were observed in distributions with and without an addition of 80 mass units. Some of the glycopeptides with different numbers of mannoses, N-acetylglucosamine, phosphate, and/or sulfate may have the same masses (e.g. GP5,6 and GP5) and cannot be distinguished by ES MS analysis. In this case it was determined by Edman degradation that only GP5 was present. H"

However, while TPA, as expected, powerfully stimulated the phosphorylation of the PKCs' 85-kDa myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS) protein, ionomycin unexpectedly did not. Instead, ionomycin reduced the basal MARCKS phosphorylation. Pretreating the glioma cells with ionomycin prevented TPA-stimulated PKCs from phosphorylating the MARCKS protein. The stimulation of membrane PKCs activity and the prevention of MARCKS phosphorylation by ionomycin required external Ca2+ because they were both abolished by adding 5 mM EGTA to the culture medium. Recently (Chakravarthy, B. R., Isaacs, R. J., Morley, P., Durkin, J. P., and Whitfield, J. F.(1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 1362-1368), we proposed that Ca2+•calmodulin complexes block MARCKS phosphorylation by the activated PKCs in keratinocytes stimulated by raising the external Ca2+ concentration. In the present experiments calmodulin prevented MARCKS phosphorylation by TPA-stimulated PKCs in glioma cell lysates, and this blockade was lifted by a calmodulin antagonist, the calmodulin-binding domain peptide. But, physiologically more significant, pretreating intact glioma cells with a cell-permeable calmodulin antagonist, calmidazolium, prevented ionomycin from blocking MARCKS phosphorylation by PKCs in unstimulated and TPA-stimulated cells. The effect of ionomycin on MARCKS phosphorylation was not due to the stimulation of Ca2+•calmodulin-dependent phosphoprotein phosphatase, calcineurin, because cyclosporin A, a potent inhibitor of this phosphatase, did not stop ionomycin from preventing MARCKS phosphorylation. The ability of ionomycin to prevent TPA-stimulated PKCs from phosphorylating MARCKS depended on whether ionomycin was added before, with, or after TPA. Maximum blockade occurred when ionomycin was added before TPA but was less effective when added with or after TPA. These results indicate that Ca2+•calmodulin can profoundly affect PKCs' signaling at the substrate level.

Cultured keratinocytes proliferate when the culture medium contains EGF 1The abbreviations used are: EGFepidermal growth factorMARCKSmyristoylated alanine-rich kinase C substratePKCprotein kinase CTPA12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate[Ca2+]intracellular calcium concentrationPNFpost-nuclear fractions. and a low Ca2+ concentration such as 0.05 mM, but raising the Ca2+ concentration above 1 mM stops proliferation and starts differentiation-related processes such as cornified envelope formation (Chakravarthy et al., 1995; Falco et al., 1988; Moscat et al., 1989; Weissmann and Aaroson, 1983, 1985; Whitfield, 1995; Whitfield et al., 1992, 1995). The signal triggered by extracellular Ca2+ in murine BALB/MK keratinocytes includes an internal Ca2+ transient and a large burst of membrane-associated PKCs activity (Chakravarthy et al., 1995). Despite the large burst of PKCs activity, neither Moscat et al.(1989) nor we (Chakravarthy et al., 1995) have observed an increased phosphorylation of the keratinocytes' 80-85-kDa MARCKS protein, an ubiquitous substrate of the conventional and novel PKC isoforms (Blackshear, 1993; Heemskerk et al., 1993; Fujise et al., 1994). epidermal growth factor myristoylated alanine-rich kinase C substrate protein kinase C 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate intracellular calcium concentration post-nuclear fractions. We have recently presented strong, but indirect, evidence for the failure of the Ca2+-treated BALB/MK keratinocyte's activated PKCs to phosphorylate their MARCKS protein substrate being due to Ca2+•calmodulin complexes somehow blocking access of the PKCs to their substrate's phosphorylation site domain (Chakravarthy et al., 1995). However, this suggestion seems to be contradicted a priori by the known abilities of mitogenic factors such as bradykinin, bombesin, platelet-derived growth factor and vasopressin to stimulate an internal Ca2+ transient, membrane-associated PKCs activity, and MARCKS phosphorylation (Rozengurt, 1986; Issandou and Rozengurt, 1990). The reason for this apparent contradiction may lie in the relative timing of the internal Ca2+ transient (and the Ca2+•calmodulin complexes it produces) and the burst of membrane-associated PKCs activity in the Ca2+-stimulated BALB/MK cells: in mitogen-stimulated cells the Ca2+ and PKC signals are coincident (Rozengurt, 1986; Issandou and Rozengurt, 1990) while in Ca2+-treated BALB/MK keratinocytes PKCs activity peaked 7 min after the [Ca2+]i surge (Chakravarthy et al., 1995). This suggested that the MARCKS substrate can be phosphorylated only when the membrane-associated PKCs activity peaks before or at the same time as [Ca2+]i, and a resulting Ca2+•calmodulin, surge. In this report we extend our observations, using C6 rat glioma cells and BALB/MK keratinocytes, to provide the first direct evidence for Ca2+•calmodulin actually being the blocker of PKCs-mediated MARCKS phosphorylation in the cell and to confirm the suggestion arising from the previous report (Chakravarthy et al., 1995) that the relative timing of surges of internal Ca2+ and PKCs activity determines the extent of MARCKS protein phosphorylation. Bovine calmodulin was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Calmodulin-binding domain peptide, H-LKKFNARRKLKGAILTTMLA-OH, and ionomycin were from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Fura-2-acetoxy methyl ester (Fura-2/AM) was purchased from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). 12-O-Tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) was from Sigma. Protein reagent was from Bio-Rad. [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) and [32P]orthophosphoric acid (9000 Ci/mmol) were from New England Nuclear (Du Pont Canada Inc., Mississauga, Ontario). Cyclosporin A (Sandoz Pharmaceuticals) was a generous gift of Dr. J. P. MacManus of this Institute. The PKCs-selective oligopeptide substrate Ac-FKKSFKL-NH2 and pseudosubstrate peptide inhibitor PKC-(19-36) were synthesized in this laboratory as described previously (Chakravarthy et al., 1991). C6 rat glioma cells were the generous gift of Dr. H. W. Cook (Atlantic Research Center for Mental Retardation, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia) and the Ca2+-responsive, differentiation-competent BALB/MK keratinocytes were the generous gift of Dr. S. A. Aaronson (Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD). C6 rat glioma cells were grown as monolayer cultures in 90% high glucose Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (DMEM) and 10% fetal bovine serum as described previously (Byers et al., 1993). The EGF-dependent BALB/MK keratinocytes were cultured in low-Ca2+ (0.05 mM) complete medium consisting of 10% (v/v) dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 20 ng/ml EGF, and 90% (v/v) Eagle's minimum essential medium as described by Weissmann and Aaronson(1983, 1985) and Chakravarthy et al. (1995). All cultures were incubated at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. For experiments, stock C6 glioma cells or BALB/MK keratinocytes (3 × 105) were plated in 60-mm dishes in 5 ml of complete medium, and 3-4 days later confluent cultures were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 2 h in 2 ml of fresh serum-free Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (Eagle's minimum essential medium in the case of keratinocytes). The cultures were then either left untreated or exposed to either 3.5 μM ionomycin and/or 1 μM TPA for 10 min at 37°C. The medium was then removed, cells washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and their membranes prepared as described previously (Chakravarthy et al., 1991, 1994). Briefly, the washed cells were covered with 1.0 ml of ice-cold hypotonic lysis medium (1 mM NaHCO3, 5 mM MgCl2, and 100 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), left on ice for 2 min, and the swollen cells were then scraped off the dish with a rubber policeman, and lysed by vortexing vigorously for 2 min. Nuclei and unlysed cells were removed by centrifugation at 600 × g for 5 min, and membranes in the post-nuclear fractions (PNF) were sedimented at 100,000 × g for 10 min. The 100,000 × g supernatant was the cytosol fraction. The sedimented membranes were suspended in 200 μl of the assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 μM CaCl2, 100 μM sodium vanadate, 100 μM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM sodium fluoride, and 100 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) by triturating with a pipette. Membrane-associated PKCs activity was measured directly in isolated membranes (without prior extraction and reconstitution of the enzyme in artificial phopholipid membranes) by determining the incorporation of 32P into a PKC-selective peptide substrate, Ac-FKKSFKL-NH2 (Chakravarthy et al., 1991, 1992, 1994, 1995; Whitfield et al., 1992). This peptide corresponds to residues 160-166 of the phosphorylation site domain(151-175) of the MARCKS protein, a specific cellular substrate of PKC (Aderem, 1992; Blackshear, 1993). It and the MARCKS protein's phosphorylation site domain to which it belongs are highly selective substrates for PKCs, being phosphorylated equally by conventional PKC (cPKC) isoforms, α, β, and γ (Heemskerk et al., 1993) and novel PKC (nPKC) isoforms such as δ and ∈, but poorly by atypical PKCs (aPKCs) such as ζ (Fujise et al., 1994). Thus, their phosphorylation is not significantly catalyzed by other protein kinases such as cyclic AMP- and cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinases or calmodulin-dependent protein kinases I-III (Chakravarthy et al., 1991; Blackshear, 1993; Heemserk et al., 1993; Orr et al., 1992; Williams et al., 1992). The 100-μl reaction mixture contained 5-10 μg of membrane protein, 75 μM PKCs-selective peptide substrate, and 50 μM [32P]ATP (220 counts/min/pmol) in assay buffer. After incubation for 10 min at 25°C, the reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of 5% acetic acid and the samples clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min. A 90-μl sample of each supernatant was applied to P81 Whatman paper which was then washed twice for 10 min in 5% acetic acid (10 ml/piece of paper). The radioactivity bound to the washed paper was determined with a LKB 1217 RACKBETA liquid scintillation spectrometer. To calculate the amount of radioactivity incorporated specifically into the peptide substrate, the nonspecific binding of 32P to the P81 papers was determined as above in the absence of the peptide. Cytosolic PKC activity was determined with a mixed micellar assay using Ac-FKKSFKL-NH2 peptide substrate as described previously (Chakravarthy et al., 1991). C6 rat glioma cells or murine BALB/MK keratinocytes were incubated with [32P]orthophosphate (250 μCi/100-mm dish) in serum-free medium for 2 h to label their ATP pool. The labeled cells were then either left untreated or incubated with 3.5 μM ionomycin and/or 1 μM TPA for 10 min. Following the treatment, the culture medium was rapidly removed, and the cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS. The MARCKS protein was extracted with 40% acetic acid as described by Robinson et al.(1993) with slight modification. Briefly, the cells were hypotonically lysed by suspending them in ice-cold 1 mM NaHCO3 solution containing 5 mM MgCl2, 100 μM sodium vanadate, 100 μM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM sodium fluoride, 100 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and vortexing vigorously. Nuclei and unlysed cells were removed by centrifugation at 600 × g for 5 min, and the post-nuclear supernatant was solubilized in electrophoresis buffer (Laemmli, 1970). The solubilized samples were adjusted to contain 40% acetic acid, left on ice for 1 h, and the precipitated proteins were removed by microfuging at top speed for 5 min. Acetic acid extract containing the MARCKS protein was processed for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described by Robinson et al.(1993), and the phosphorylation of MARCKS protein was visualized by autoradiography using Kodak XAR film. C6 glioma cells were hypotonically lysed and PNF was prepared as described above. The PNF was adjusted to contain 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 μM CaCl2, 100 μM sodium vanadate, 100 μM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM sodium fluoride, 100 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. 100-μl of PNF was incubated with the indicated additions (see figure legends) and [32P]ATP (25-μM, 900 counts/min/pmol) for 10 min at 25°C in a final reaction volume of 200 μl. The MARCKS protein was then extracted, and the level of its phosphorylation determined by autoradiography as described above. Immunoblotting was performed according to Towbin et al.(1979). Proteins from cytosol and solubilized membranes were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The nitrocellulose membranes were then incubated with pan-PKC antibody (UBI, Lake Placid, NY) at 1:1000 dilution for 2 h at room temperature. PKC•antibody complexes were visualized using an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG as described previously (Chakravarthy et al., 1994). For the determination of [Ca2+]i, glioma cells were plated on glass coverslips (Canadawide Scientific, Ottawa, Canada) in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. The medium was changed on day 3 and [Ca2+]i responses determined on day 5. Changes in [Ca2+]i were monitored using the Ca2+-sensitive fluroprobe Fura-2 as described in detail previously (Grynkiewicz et al., 1985; Morley and Whitfield, 1993; Chakravarthy et al., 1995). Protein contents were measured according to the method of Bradford(1976). Exposing rat C6 glioma cells to 3.5 μM ionomycin triggered a 4-5-fold increase in membrane-associated PKCs activity which was as large as that induced by the potent PKCs-activating phorbol ester TPA as determined by the ability of membranes isolated from the treated and untreated cells to phosphorylate the MARCKS-derived PKCs-selective peptide substrate Ac-FKKSFKL-NH2in vitro (Fig. 1A). This increase in membrane-associated Ac-FKKSFKL-NH2 phosphorylating activity began within 30 s of adding ionomycin and peaked by 2 min (Fig. 1B). We have previously shown that the Ac-FKKSFKL-NH2 phosphorylating activity in membranes from several types of cells is that of PKCs (Chakravarthy et al., 1991, 1995; Whitfield et al., 1992). The same was true for C6 glioma cell membrane-associated protein kinase activity. Thus, more than 90% of the Ac-FKKSFKL-NH2 phosphorylating activity associated with the glioma cell membranes was inhibited by adding the PKCs-selective pseudosubstrate peptide inhibitor PKC-(19-36) (House and Kemp, 1987) to the assay mixture (Fig. 1C). Moreover, depleting PKCs by a 20-h preincubation of cells with 300 nM TPA (Chakravarthy et al., 1989; Chida et al., 1986) totally abolished both TPA- and ionomycin-induced increases in the membrane-associated peptide-phosphorylating activity (Fig. 1D). Therefore, the ionomycin-induced increase in the phosphorylation of Ac-FKKSFKL-NH2 must have been due to activated PKCs. The ionomycin-induced increase in membrane PKCs activity was accompanied by a large drop in cytosolic PKCs activity indicating a redistribution of these enzymes to membranes (Fig. 1B). This was corroborated by immunoblot analysis which revealed that ionomycin treatment increased the amount of membrane-associated PKCs and decreased the amount in cytosol fraction (see Fig. 1B, inset). Despite inducing a robust increase in membrane PKCs activity (Fig. 1A, bar 3), which was as large as that induced by TPA (Fig. 1A, bar 2), ionomycin, unlike TPA, did not stimulate the phosphorylation of MARCKS protein in intact C6 glioma cells whose ATP pools had been prelabled with [32P]orthophosphate (Fig. 2, lane 3). In fact, ionomycin actually reduced the basal phosphorylation of MARCKS in intact cells. Furthermore, a 2-min exposure of the glioma cells to ionomycin before adding TPA to the culture medium completely prevented the TPA-induced phosphorylation of MARCKS protein (Fig. 2, lane 4). This was not due to ionomycin pretreatment somehow affecting the ability of TPA to stimulate PKCs activity in these cells because ionomycin and TPA actually cooperated to produce an enhanced burst of membrane PKCs activity (Fig. 3A, bar 3). Furthermore, ionomycin probably did not interfere directly with PKC-mediated MARCKS phosphorylation in intact cells because it did not affect the phosphorylation of MARCKS by TPA-stimulated PKCs in broken cell preparation (Fig. 4, lane 3).Figure 3Chelating external Ca2+ with EGTA abolishes both the ionomycin-induced increase in membrane-associated PKCs activity and the blockade by ionomycin of 85-kDa MARCKS protein phosphorylation by TPA-activated PKCs in C6 glioma cells. A, C6 glioma cells maintained in serum-free medium for 2 h were: 1) left untreated; 2) exposed to 1 μM TPA for 10 min; 3) exposed to 3.5 μM ionomycin and 1 μM TPA for 10 min; 4) exposed to 5 mM EGTA and 1 μM TPA for 10 min; 5) exposed to 5 mM EGTA, 3.5 μM ionomycin, and 1 μM TPA for 10 min; 6) exposed to 3.5 μM ionomycin for 10 min; 7) exposed to 5 mM EGTA and 3.5 μM ionomycin for 10 min. Membrane fractions were prepared and PKC activity determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” It should be noted that the difference between the PKCs activities in this figure and in Fig. 1A were due to to normal culture variations.

Thus, ionomycin neither stimulated membrane-associated PKCs activity (Fig. 3A, bar 7) nor prevented MARCKS phosphorylation by TPA-stimulated PKCs (Fig. 3B, lane 5) when external Ca2+ was chelated with 5 mM EGTA before exposing the cells to ionomycin and TPA. Removing external Ca2+ with EGTA only marginally affected TPA-stimulated PKCs activity (Fig. 3A, bar 4) and MARCKS phosphorylation (Fig. 3B, lane 4). We previously suggested that Ca2+•calmodulin complexes may be the actual blockers of MARCKS protein phosphorylation by the activated PKCs in Ca2+-stimulated keratinocytes (Chakravarthy et al., 1995). Indeed, in the present study MARCKS phosphorylation in C6 glioma cell lysates was suppressed by adding calmodulin to the reaction mixture, and this suppression was prevented by the calmodulin-binding domain peptide H-LKKFNARRKLKGAKTTMLA-OH (Payne et al., 1988) which would compete with MARCKS for Ca2+•calmodulin (Fig. 4). But, the question remained as to whether Ca2+•calmodulin was the blocker of MARCKS phosphorylation in intact glioma cells. If so, a calmodulin antagonist, such as calmidazolium, should have been able to prevent ionomycin from blocking MARCKS phosphorylation by TPA-activated PKCs. Indeed, 25 or 50 μM calmidazolium enabled ionomycin to stimulate MARCKS phosphorylation in glioma cells (Fig. 6A, lanes 4 and 5) without affecting the ionomycin-induced increase in membrane-associated PKCs activity (data not shown). Furthermore, calmidazolium pretreatment also partially prevented ionomycin from blocking MARCKS phosphorylation by TPA-stimulated PKCs (Fig. 6B, lane 4). We have previously shown (Chakravarthy et al., 1995) that the failure of PKCs to phosphorylate MARCKS protein in Ca2+-stimulated BALB/MK keratinocytes is not due to a general dephosphorylation of the substrate by Ca2+•calmodulin-dependent phosphatase such as PP2B/calcineurin. Pretreatment with cyclosporin A (1 μM), a highly specific inhibitor of PP2B/calcineurin (Groblewski et al., 1994) also did not overcome ionomycin-induced blockade of TPA-stimulated MARCKS protein in glioma cells (Fig. 6B, lane 5). The extent of inhibition of TPA-stimulated phosphorylation of MARCKS in the C6 glioma cells by ionomycin depended on whether the ionophore was added before, with, or after TPA. Thus, while exposing the glial cells to ionomycin 2 min before TPA totally prevented MARCKS phosphorylation by the stimulated PKCs, adding ionomycin along with, or 2 or 3 min after TPA blocked MARCKS phosphorylation less effectively (Fig. 7). Similar timing-dependent effects of ionomycin on membrane-associated PKCs activity and MARCKS phosphorylation were observed with BALB/MK keratinocytes. Thus, while ionomycin slightly enhanced TPA-stimulated membrane-associated PKCs activity in the keratinocytes regardless of whether it was added before or after TPA (Fig. 8A), it completely prevented a TPA-induced increase in MARCKS phosphorylation when added before TPA, but it was less effective in blocking MARCKS phosphorylation when added along with or after TPA (Fig. 8B).Figure 8Prevention of TPA-induced MARCKS phosphorylation by ionomycin in BALB/MK keratinocytes also depends on when the ionophore is added to the culture medium. A, BALB/MK keratinocytes in serum-free medium were: 1) left untreated; 2) treated with 1 μM TPA for 10 min; 3) treated with 3.5 μM ionomycin for 10 min; 4) treated with 3.5 μM ionomycin for 2 min followed by 1 μM TPA for 10 min; 5) treated with 3.5 μM ionomycin and 1 μM TPA added together for 10 min. Membrane fractions were prepared and PKCs activity determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” Values are the means ± S.D. of triplicate determinations from one of three independent experiments. B, BALB/MK keratinocytes were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate in serum-free medium for 2 h and left untreated (1), treated with 1 μM TPA for 10 min (2), treated with 3.5 μM ionomycin for 10 min (3); treated with 3.5 μM ionomycin for 2 min followed by 1 μM TPA for 10 min (4); treated with 1 μM TPA for 10 min with 3.5 μM ionomycin added 3 min after TPA addition (5); treated with 1 μM TPA for 10 min with 3.5 μM ionomycin added 2 min after TPA addition (6); treated with 1 μM TPA and 3.5 μM ionomycin added together for 10 min (7). The phosphorylation of the 85-kDa MARCKS protein was determined autoradiographically as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Emerging from these and our previous observations on mouse keratinocytes is a novel regulatory mechanism for PKCs signaling which operates on the substrate level. It was first seen as an unexpected stimulation of keratinocyte PKCs by a physiological Ca2+ concentration without phosphorylation of the PKCs' MARCKS protein substrate (Chakravarthy et al., 1995). In these Ca2+-stimulated keratinocytes, there was an internal Ca2+ surge which preceded the burst of membrane-associated PKCs activity by several minutes (Chakravarthy et al., 1995). In the present study, when we triggered a [Ca2+]i surge in C6 glioma cells with ionomycin before stimulating PKCs with TPA, the kinases similarly could not phosphorylate their MARCKS protein substrate. Moreover, ionomycin, which caused an instant large [Ca2+]i surge and a later (1-2 min) burst of PKCs activity did not increase MARCKS phosphorylation in the glioma cells. The results of the timing experiments in the present study have now established that it is the relative timing of [Ca2+]i and PKCs activity surges that determines whether PKCs can phosphorylate the MARCKS protein. Thus, as would be expected from the existence of coincident surges of [Ca2+]i, PKCs activity, and MARCKS phosphorylation in bradykinin-, bombesin-, platelet-derived growth factor-, and vasopressin-stimulated Swiss albino 3T3 mouse cells (Rozengurt, 1986; Issandou and Rozengurt, 1990), ionomycin became increasingly unable to prevent TPA-induced MARCKS phosphorylation in glioma cells and keratinocytes when added along with, or at increasing times after, TPA. The present results also establish Ca2+•calmodulin as the intracellular mediator of the interference with PKCs' substrate phosphorylation by Ca2+. Since a [Ca2+]i surge produced by ionomycin or triggered by activated surface Ca2+ receptors/sensors or growth factor receptors produces Ca2+•calmodulin complexes, and since calmodulin binds to the MARCKS protein (Aderem, 1992; Blackshear, 1993; Nairn and Aderem, 1992), we suggested in our previous report that it was these complexes that mediated Ca2+'s blocking action (Chakravarthy et al., 1995). In support of this we showed that Ca2+•calmodulin did indeed prevent MARCKS protein phosphorylation in PNF of BALB/MK keratinocytes. This suggestion has now been confirmed by the present demonstration of the ability of a Ca2+•calmodulin inhibitor, calmidazolium, to stop an ionomycin-induced Ca2+ surge from preventing a subsequent TPA-induced burst of membrane-associated PKCs activity from phosphorylating MARCKS protein in intact C6 glioma cells. Since ionomycin is a non-physiological agent, the question immediately arises as to whether a [Ca2+]i surge triggered by a natural agonist would similarly prevent PKCs from phosphorylating MARCKS. The answer appears to be yes, because in our previous study (Chakravarthy et al., 1995) we demonstrated that an external Ca2+-induced, Ca2+-receptor/sensor-mediated [Ca2+]i surge, which is part of the physiological trigger of keratinocyte differentiation (Whitfield, 1995; Whitfield et al., 1995), blocked MARCKS phosphorylation by PKCs, although these enzymes' activity increased by 3-4-fold. Furthermore, in a new study 2B. R. Chakravarthy, R. J. Isaacs, P. Morley, and J. F. Whitfield, manuscript in preparation. we have already found that endothelin-1 and ATP, which are known to be physiological agonists for C6 glioma cells (Lin et al., 1990, 1992, 1993) trigger rapid increases in [Ca2+]i and that pretreating these cells with 10 nM endothelin-1 or 100 μM ATP 2 min before adding TPA prevents the TPA-stimulated PKCs from phosphorylating MARCKS just as did Ca2+ in the BALB/MK keratinocytes of our previous study (Chakravarthy et al., 1995) and ionomycin in the glioma cells of the present study. Thus, Ca2+•calmodulin appears to be a physiological modulator of MARCKS phosphorylation by PKCs. The ability of Ca2+•calmodulin to modulate the phosphorylation and function of PKCs'substrate does not appear to be restricted to the actin-binding MARCKS protein alone. Ca2+•calmodulin complexes appear to prevent PKCs from phosphorylating and down-regulating EGF receptors (Chakravarthy et al., 1995; Moscat et al., 1989). An interference with PKCs action by Ca2+•calmodulin has also been observed with several other functionally important proteins which, unlike MARCKS and EGF receptor, have calmodulin-binding “IQ” motifs in or near their phosphorylation site domains. Among these are the “DEAD-box” helicases such as p68-kDa RNA helicase and eIF-4A helicase (Buelt et al., 1994; Schmid and Linder, 1992), membrane Ca2+-ATPase (Hofmann et al., 1994), neurogranin, and neuromodulin (Alexander et al., 1987; Apel et al., 1990; Baudier et al. 1991). It has also been shown that phosphorylation of microtubule-associated tau protein (the component of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer disease) by PKCs is prevented by Ca2+•calmodulin (Baudier et al., 1987). Although most of these were in vitro studies, they do however, suggest that the interaction of these two major signalers at the substrate level can affect EGF receptor signaling (Chakravarthy et al., 1995; Moscat et al., 1989), Ca2+ extrusion (Hofmann et al., 1994), eIF-4A's enhancement of the translatability of mRNA with highly structured 5′-untranslated regions (reviewed by Whitfield, 1995), and perhaps neuronal functions. The striking timing-dependence of this interaction observed in glioma cells suggests that it might be particularly important in brain where slightly different times of arrival of Ca2+ and PKCs signals from converging afferents could greatly affect neuronal responses such as synaptic vesicle mobilization and neurotransmitter release, long term potentiation, and neurite outgrowth by affecting the extent of phosphorylation of targets such as the neuron-specific neurogranin and neuromodulin.

Protein folding is primarily dictated by noncovalent, relatively weak intramolecular forces, i.e. hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, and hydrophobic effects (Jaenicke, 1991). The effect of pH and alcohols on protein structure and folding has been discussed widely in the literature. Depending on the protein, acids can generate either fully or partially denatured states (Kuwajima, 1992). For β-lactamase, apomyoglobin, and ferricytochrome c (Goto et al., 1990), lowering the pH to about 2 by adding HCl yields unfolded proteins whose conformations can be partially stabilized into more compact states containing substantial secondary structure by the addition of more HCl. More complex pH-induced folding transitions have been observed at pH 2.7 with barnase (Sanz et al., 1994). Alcohols have been known for some time both to denature/destabilize globular protein tertiary (Conio et al., 1970; Parodi et al., 1973) and quarternary (Yang et al., 1993) structure and to effect conformational stabilization of various peptides in aqueous solution (Conio et al., 1970; Parodi et al., 1973). While some of these pH- and alcohol-induced states may be true protein folding intermediates, the presence of alternatively folded structures cannot be excluded. Nevertheless, their study can shed light on general principles of protein folding and dynamics. Recently, more and more short linear peptides are being used as models for protein folding and local structure formation. Although this approach has been exemplified with synthetic peptides derived from the α-helix protein myoglobin (Waltho et al., 1993; Shin et al., 1993a, 1993b) and the mostly β-sheet protein platelet factor-4 (Ilyina et al., 1994), studies on the ribonuclease S peptide (20 residues) (Brown and Klee, 1971) and pentapeptides like YPGDV (Dyson et al., 1988a, 1988b) first fueled the fire of interest in others. NMR and CD, in particular, have been used to show that short linear peptides can have considerable conformational populations in aqueous solution in the presence and absence of various stabilizing agents. Trifluoroethanol is perhaps the most commonly used agent for stabilizing α-helix conformation in peptides (Moroder et al., 1975; Lu et al., 1984; Leist and Thomas, 1984; Dyson, et al., 1988a, 1988b; Pena et al., 1989; Lehrman et al., 1990; Segawa, and Sugihara, 1984). Recently trifluoroethanol has been more thoroughly studied in this function (Sönnichsen, et al., 1992; Jasanoff and Fersht, 1994). Sönnichsen et al.(1992) concluded that trifluoroethanol is not a helix-inducing solvent, i.e. it does not create new structures, but rather that it is a helix-enhancing cosolvent that stabilizes helices in regions with existing α-helical propensity. The dominant effect of trifluoroethanol is caused by its significantly weaker basicity with respect to that of water (Llinas and Klein, 1975), which decreases amide proton hydrogen bonding to the solvent and strengthens intramolecular hydrogen bonds, thereby stabilizing secondary structure (Nelson and Kallenbach, 1986). For some time, this laboratory has been interested in a peptide derived from the C-terminal region of the fibrinogen γ-chain, residues 385-411 (Mayo et al.(1990) and references therein).

On the other hand, NOE magnitudes were decreased, suggesting the presence of either less structure or increased internal mobility at lower pH. The complications involved with interpreting NOEs from highly flexible, linear peptides arise from the fact that NOEs are sensitive to both the internuclear distance and internal motions. The present study was initiated to correlate pH-induced CD and NOE effects in γ27 with motional characteristics derived from 13CαH relaxation experiments. the 27-residue peptide derived from the C terminus of γ-chain fibrinogen residues 385-411 nuclear Overhauser effect two-dimensional NMR nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy high pressure liquid chromatography degree(s). A peptide representing amino acid residues 385-411 from human fibrinogen γ-chain (called γ27) was synthesized on a Milligen Biosearch 9600 automated peptide synthesizer. The procedures used were based on Merrifield solid phase synthesis utilizing Fmoc-BOP chemistry (Stewart and Young, 1984). After the sequence had been obtained, the peptide support and side chain protection groups were acid (trifluoroacetic acid and scavenger mixture)-cleaved. Crude peptides were analyzed for purity on a Hewlett-Packard 1090M analytical HPLC using a reverse phase C18 VyDac column. Peptides generally were about 90% pure. Further purification was done on a preparative reverse-phase HPLC C-18 column using an elution gradient of 0-60% acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water. Peptides then were analyzed for amino acid composition on a Beckman 6300 amino acid analyzer by total hydrolysis (6 N HCl at 110°C for 18-20 h) and by mass spectrometry. Final peptide purity was greater than 95%. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were measured on a Jasco JA-710 air-cooled automatic recording spectropolarimeter coupled with a data processor. Curves were recorded digitally and fed through the data processor for signal averaging and base line subtraction. Spectra were recorded from 5 to 30°C in 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 2-6, over a 190-250-nm range using a 0.5-mm path length, thermally jacketed quartz cuvette. Temperature was controlled by using a Haacke water bath. Trifluoroethanol titrations were done up to 80% (v/v) trifluoroethanol. Peptide concentration was about 0.1 mM. The scan speed was 5.0 nm/min. Spectra were signal-averaged four times, and an equally signal-averaged solvent base line was subtracted. CD spectra were analyzed by the methods of Sreerama and Woody(1993) and Chen et al.(1974) for estimation of helix content. Freeze-dried samples for NMR measurements were dissolved in either D2O or H2O/D2O (9:1) containing 10 mM potassium phosphate. Protein concentration was in the range of 5 mM. pH was adjusted by adding microliter quantities of NaOD or DCl to the protein sample. For most experiments, the temperature was controlled at 5°C. All NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker AMX-600 NMR spectrometer. For sequential assignments, two-dimensional NMR-correlated spectroscopy (Aue et al., 1976; Wider et al., 1984), double quantum-filtered two-dimensional NMR-correlated spectroscopy (Piantini et al., 1982; Shaka and Freeman, 1983), and NOESY (Jeener et al., 1979; Wider et al., 1984) experiments were performed. Two-dimensional homonuclear magnetization transfer spectra, used to identify many spin systems completely, were obtained by spin locking with an MLEV-17 sequence (Bax and Davis, 1985) with a mixing time of 64 ms. All spectra were acquired in the phase-sensitive mode (States et al., 1982). The water resonance was suppressed by direct irradiation (1 s) at the water frequency during the relaxation delay between scans as well as during the mixing time in NOESY experiments. The majority of the two-dimensional NMR spectra were collected as 512 or 1024 t1 experiments, each with 1024 or 2,048 complex data points over a spectral width of 5 kHz in both dimensions with the carrier placed on the water resonance. 64 or 96 scans were generally time-averaged per t1 experiment. The data were processed directly on the Bruker AMX-600 X-32 or offline on a Bruker Aspect-1 work station using the UXNMR program. Data sets were multiplied in both dimensions by 0-60°-shifted sine-bell or lorentzian to gaussian transformation function and generally zero-filled to 1,024 in the t1 dimension prior to Fourier transformation. To obtain a quantitative description of peptide backbone dynamics, 1H-detected 13C heteronuclear chemical shift correlation spectra (van Mierlo et al.(1993) and references therein) were accumulated to derive (1H)-13C NOE and 13C T1 relaxation data on the unenriched peptide. In each case, cross-peak intensities depend on the relaxation parameter of interest. All spectra were acquired in the phase-sensitive mode by using time-proportional phase incrementation for quadrature detection in the ω1 dimension; 2048 data points were recorded in each quadrature channel during t2, and 200 real points were recorded in t1. Spectra were acquired with a spectral width of 5000 Hz in ω2 and 6000 Hz in ω1. The 1H carrier was placed on the HDO resonance, and the 13C carrier was set at 45.4 ppm. For T1 measurements, 128 scans were acquired per t1 increment; for the NOE measurement, 256 scans were acquired per increment. For measurements of T1 and NOE, a relaxation delay of 5.0 s was used between scans to ensure sufficient recovery of 1H magnetization. For T1 relaxation measurements, nine separate spectra were recorded for T = 0.01, 0.04, 0.08, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.2 s. Relaxation rate constants and NOE enhancements were calculated from peak heights of the heteronuclear resonances as described by Palmer et al. (1991). Data analysis was performed on Bruker Aspect-1 or Silicon Graphics work stations using UXNMR, Aurelia (Bruker, Inc.), or FELIX (Biosym, Inc.) programs. 13C NMR relaxation data were analyzed by using the model-free formalism of Lipari and Szabo (1982a, 1982b) in which motions are described in terms of two correlation times (an overall tumbling time and an internal motion correlation time) and an order parameter (S2), which can be related to bond angular restrictions (Lipari and Szabo, 1982b). Since S2 is least sensitive to τi, an average τi value of 5 × 10−11 s was used initially in the optimization routine and later varied up to 10 × 10−11 s. Then a resulting average τo value was fixed, and τi and S2 were allowed to vary. In either case, S2 varied by no more than 5%. Smaller values of the order parameter are taken to indicate relatively decreased motional restrictions. The structures were calculated by using the constant valence force field included in the Biosym Software (INSIGHT II 2.3, DISCOVER 2.9) (San Diego, CA) on a Silicon Graphics Indigo 2. Distance constraints were derived from NOE data as discussed under “Results.” Additional torsional restraints were applied to maintain trans-geometry and planarity for the peptide bond throughout the calculations. The starting extending polypeptide coordinate was minimized using 50 steps of steepest descent minimization and then 600 fs of molecular dynamics calculation at 1200 K with a step size of 1 fs followed by 500 steps of conjugate gradient minimization. After the triangle bounds smoothing was done, 30 coordinate files were created by metrization and embedding. Refinement of these coordinates was done using a simulated annealing protocol with a simplified error function to further optimize the fit between the coordinates and the distance matrix. The annealing protocol was followed by 1000 steps of conjugate gradient minimization to obtain the converged distance geometry-based structures. CD spectra of γ27 obtained at pH 6, 5°C, are displayed in Fig. 1 at different trifluoroethanol concentrations. At 0% trifluoroethanol, the γ27 CD trace is characteristic of mostly random coil conformation. As the trifluoroethanol concentration is increased, the shape of the curves becomes increasingly characteristic of helical secondary structure. The monotonic trends in ellipticities and an apparent isodichroic point at about 204 nm suggest an equilibrium between two main conformational states, helix and random coil. Percentage of α-helicity was estimated by using the mean residue ellipticity at 220 nm [Θ220] and the equation of Chen et al.(1974) Θ=(fH-ik/N)ΘH(Eq. 1) where Θ is the observed mean residue ellipticity at 220-nm wavelength. ΘH is the maximum mean residue ellipticity of a helix of infinite length (Chang et al., 1978); fH is the fraction of helix in the molecule; i is the number of helical segments; N is the total number of residues, and k is a wavelength-dependent constant (2.6 at 220 nm). The number of helical segments, i, was set to 2 in order to be consistent with modeled structures generated from NOE-derived distance constraints discussed later. The expected value of the mean residue ellipticity for 100% helicity of peptides of chain length 27 residues was determined to be −32,720 deg cm2/dmol. Using this method, calculated helicities as a function of trifluoroethanol concentration are shown in the inset to Fig. 1 for data accumulated at 5 and at 25°C. As expected, helicity increased with increasing trifluoroethanol concentration and with decreasing temperature. CD spectra are plotted as a function of solution pH (constant 40% trifluoroethanol and 5°C) in Fig. 2. In the insert to Fig. 2, [Θ220], [Θ195], and the wavelength minimum in the 204-206-nm range, are plotted versus the solution pH. These CD data (inset) are consistent with increases in the average helix content of peptide γ27 as the pH is lowered from 6 to 2. Even though data shown in this figure have been accumulated in 40% trifluoroethanol, the same general trend is observed at lower trifluoroethanol concentrations. The isodichroic point at 200 nm supports the idea of an equilibrium between two main conformational populations, one having more helix character than the other. NOESY spectra of the αH-NH/aromatic and NH-NH/aromatic resonance regions of γ27 (5°C and 40% trifluoroethanol) accumulated at pH 5.3 and at 2.5 are compared in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, respectively. Since sequential resonance assignments for γ27 have been done at pH 3.5, 30°C, 0% trifluoroethanol (Mayo et al., 1990), they were easily made under the present solution conditions by using the standard approach outlined in Wüthrich(1986). Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 trace out some sequential assignments, which are tabulated more completely in Table 1 for pH 5.3 data. These data (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4) aim at identifying dNN(i, i + 1, 2), dαN(i, i + n), and other relatively long range NOEs that help define conformational populations for γ27. These and other NOEs are summarized in Fig. 5 for pH values of 2.5 and 5.3. A complete listing of NOEs observed at pH 5.3 is given in Table 2. Numerous dNN(i, i + n) and dαN(i, i + n) NOEs are observed. At pH 5.3, most “longer range” NOEs are found within the sequence Phe389-Glu396. This network of NOEs suggests the presence of multiple-turn or helix-like structure. NOEs present at pH 5.3 normally are observed with similar or only slightly reduced magnitudes at pH 2.5. Cursory inspection of the NH-NH NOESY region may suggest large decreases in NOE magnitudes for data accumulated at pH 2.5. However, comparison with the αN region and normalization with Pro398δH1-δH2 NOE indicates that NOE magnitudes are on average only slightly reduced. When comparing one segment with another, most NOEs that are reduced in intensity belong to residues within the C-terminal segment Gly403-Val411.Figure 4pH 2.5 NOESY contour plots of peptide γ27.

The time dependence of NOEs was used to check for possible spin diffusion. Below about a 0.5-s mixing time in the NOESY experiment, spin diffusion could not be detected. NOEs were ranked relatively as strong (2.2-3 Å), medium (2.8-3.5 Å), and weak (3.3-5 Å). An additional 0.5 Å degree of freedom was allowed for each non-backbone atom (or pseudoatom) involved in any given distance constraint. Distance geometry calculations were first done by using XPLOR, followed by energy minimization and restrained annealing dynamics simulations. Electrostatic potentials for charged groups were varied from full charge to about 50% of full charge. 30 structures were generated. 10 of these showed minimal distance violations (from input NOE constraints) of less than 0.5 Å. Overall backbone RMSD values were less than 0.8 Å2 for residues Phe389-Glu396 and for residues Glu404-Asp410. Fig. 6 displays two sets of the same 10 structures generated this way. The leftportion of the figure shows overlays for the N-terminal segment residues 389-396, and the rightportion of the figure shows overlays for the C-terminal segment residues 404-410. Both N- and C-terminal segments form helix-like conformations. α-Helix character is greatest for sequences Arg391-Gly395 and Ala405-Gly409. Ramachandran plots (data not shown) indicate that the greatest ψ,φ angular displacements are found for Gly397-Gly403. In this respect, it appears that the terminal segments move more or less as units connected via a mid-segment “hinge” region. pH-induced variances in CD ellipticities and NOE magnitudes indicate electrostatic modulation of γ27 conformational populations. Furthermore, chemical shift changes for most resonances are observed as a function of pH. The only titratable groups in γ27 belong to the carboxylate groups of Glu 396, Asp410, and Val411, and the side-chain imidazole groups of His400 and His401. pKa values (derived from plots of chemical shift versus pH) for Glu396, Asp410, and Val411 (data not shown) range from 3.7 to 4.1. For His401 and His400, pKa values of 6.5 and 6.6, respectively, can be estimated from the data shown in Fig. 7. Evidence for an electrostatic interaction between/among His400, His401, and Glu396 comes from the apparent Glu396 pKa inflection observed in the titration curves of His400 and His401 C2 proton resonances. The lower pH portion of this titration curve (Fig. 7) has its chemical shift ordinate axis expanded in the inset. Data points have been connected with a solidline, which represents the sum of theoretical titration curves for Glu396 (pKa of 4.1) and His400 (pKa of 6.6). Proximity of His400 and Glu396 is confirmed by NOEs observed between His400/His401 and Glu396/Gly397 side-chain proton resonances (see Fig. 3 and Table 2). Marqusee and Baldwin(1987) have observed that positive-negative side-chain electrostatic interactions are most stabilizing in a helical conformation when oppositely charged residues are at the i, i + 4 positions, respectively. Significant pH-dependent chemical shift changes (greater than 0.1 ppm) for side chains of Lys385, Ile386, Arg391, and Thr393 (data not shown) also argue for direct (although probably transient) interactions with Glu396. In a helix-like conformation (Fig. 6), Thr393 is located at the i, i + 3 position with respect to Glu396. Proximity to N-terminal residues Lys385 and Ile386 is considered plausible based on results from calculated structures. In particular, the side-chain of Lys385 can fold in toward the side-chain of Glu396 to mediate a “loose” electrostatic interaction. Within the Lys385-His401 segment, 50% of these backbone NHs are shifted more than 0.1 ppm on varying the pH between 2.5 and 5.3. In particular, two of the more shifted NHs belong to Ile387 and Phe389, supporting the idea of a possible long range structurally stabilizing effect of Glu396. Additionally, Ile387 NH is one of the most long lived NHs at lower pH (Mayo et al., 1990). This electrostatic interaction in combination with hydrophobic side-chain clustering (Dyson et al., 1992), could explain this NH solvent protection. Protonation/deprotonation of Asp410 and Val411 (C-terminal carboxylate) probably plays no role in the electrostatic effects of the N-terminal and mid-peptide segments. The only side chain within C-terminal residues Leu402-Val411 that shows significant chemical shifts on varying pH belongs to Ala405. Other residues have their backbone resonances more highly shifted than their side-chain resonances, suggestive of indirect, conformationally induced chemical shift changes. In particular, the noncharged amino acid residue NHs of Gln407, Ala408, and Gly409 are shifted by between 0.15 and 0.25 ppm, and Gly409αHs are more degenerate at lower pH. Interestingly, side-chain proton resonances of Lys406 demonstrate a carboxylate pKa inflection. This suggests an electrostatic interaction between Lys406 and most probably Asp410 or Val411. 1H-detected two-dimensional heteronuclear 13C NMR experiments (Nirmala and Wagner, 1988; Kay et al., 1989; Clore et al., 1990; Palmer et al., 1991) have been used to characterize 13Cα relaxation in γ27, thereby providing information on local peptide backbone motional restrictions. 13Cα resonance assignments were made by correlating 1Hα resonances to the corresponding 13Cα resonances in 1H-detected 13C heteronuclear shift correlation experiments (van Mierlo et al., 1993) done at pH values between 2.5 and 5.3. 13Cα chemical shifts at pH 5.3 are listed in Table 1. Typical (1H)−13C NOE data are shown in Fig. 8, and 13CαT1 and (1H)-13Cα NOE data accumulated at pH 2.5 and pH 5.3 are compared in Fig. 9. Relaxation data for glycines were not derived due to resonance overlap of the five glycines. Furthermore, due to spectral overlap of some other 1H-13C cross-peaks, i.e. Leu392 with Leu402 and Gln407, and Glu396 with Gln398, relaxation parameters for these cross-peaks could not be as accurately determined as those for others. T1 relaxation curves, however, did appear linear; therefore, individual respective relaxation rates are similar for these partially overlapped cross-peaks.Figure 9γ27 13C T1, NOE, and order parameters. 13C T1, (1H)-13C NOE data, and backbone motional order parameters, S2, for γ27 at pH 2.5 and at pH 5.3 are shown. As discussed under “Materials and Methods” and in the text, order parameters, S2, have been derived from these relaxation data by using the model-free approach of Lipari and Szabo (1982a, 1982b).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Within the N-terminal segment Lys385-Phe389, both T1 and NOE values are smaller for γ27 at pH 5.3, indicating decreased backbone mobility of that sequence at higher pH. This is reflected in order parameters, S2, derived from these relaxation data (Fig. 9). For residues Ala405-Val411, S2 values are larger at pH 2.5, indicating increased motional restriction of the C-terminal segment at lower pH. For residues Asn390-His401, S2 values vary less with pH change. At either pH, the mid-peptide region residues Thr393-His400 generally show the smallest order parameters, indicating the presence of a relatively flexible mid-peptide segment, consistent with NOE-based distance geometry calculations, which indicate an ill-defined mid-peptide segment from about Gly395 to His401. The overall correlation time, τo, was 1.9 ns at either pH value. Short, linear peptides, like γ27, generally exist in solution in an ensemble of highly fluctuating structures whose NMR spectral parameters average. This is true for γ27 in aqueous solution at 30°C in the absence of trifluoroethanol (Mayo et al., 1990) where multiple turn or nascent helix (Dyson et al., 1988a, 1988b) conformation was apparent within residues 385-402. Under those solution conditions, C-terminal residues 402-411 showed no NOE structural constraints greater than i, i + 1; however, conformational preference within that segment was apparent based on chemical shift differences with fibrinogen γ-chain peptide 400-411 and a 5-Hz 3JαN coupling constant for Ala408 (Mayo et al., 1990). This observation is supported with NMR studies on fibrinogen γ-chain peptide 392-411 done by Blumenstein et al.(1992), who reported that at 5°C (also in the absence of trifluoroethanol), a significant β-turn population exists for the sequence Gln407-Asp410. These present γ27 NOE data accumulated in the presence of trifluoroethanol are consistent with both reports (Mayo et al., 1990; Blumenstein et al., 1992). More transient multiple turn or helix-like conformations noted at 30 or 5°C in the absence of trifluoroethanol are stabilized by the presence of trifluoroethanol, which acts as a structure-enhancing cosolvent (Sönnichsen, et al., 1992; Jasanoff and Fersht, 1994), rather than as a conformation-inducing, i.e. new structure-inducing, agent. Trifluoroethanol stabilizes helix conformation in peptide sequences that have some helix propensity. The Chou-Fasman(1978) predictive secondary structure algorithm yields good probabilities for helix formation from residues Leu392-Leu402 as well as from residues Ala405-Val411 (Mayo et al., 1990). At pH 5.3, NOE-based distance geometry-generated structures of γ27 indicate that helix-like or multiple turn conformations are present within the N- and C-terminal segments, residues 391-397 and 404-408, respectively. N-terminal residues 385-387 have an extended conformation, and Pro398 causes a kink in the structure that leads into a turn centered at 390-391. The trifluoroethanol-stabilized, N-terminal conformation, residues 385-397, is essentially the same as that observed for γ27 in aqueous solution at 30°C (Mayo et al., 1990), once again supporting the idea that trifluoroethanol does not induce new structure formation but rather acts to enhance existing conformational populations (Söennichsen et al., 1992; Jasanoff and Fersht, 1994). Within the Gly397-Gly403 segment, few “long range” NOEs are observed, which results in distance geometry calculations of a conformationally ill defined mid-peptide region. The paucity of NOEs could be the result of a more extended, solvent-exposed conformation and/or of a more flexible domain. Since average motional order parameters are reduced within this region relative to other sequences, one can conclude that the mid-peptide segment is relatively more flexible than any other segment. The lack of conformationally constraining NOEs within this region, therefore, is mostly due to the presence of an ensemble of highly fluctuating conformations. In this respect, N- and C-terminal helix-like regions are connected by a “hinge” segment. In support of this, it should be noted that glycine, which highly populates this mid-peptide segment (Gly395, Gly397, Gly403, Gly404), normally promotes increased ψ,φ angular freedom and flexibility, disrupts periodic structure, and frequently occupies the helix C-cap position (Richardson and Richardson, 1988). In terms of the effect of pH on specific sequences within γ27, NMR data indicate that N- and C-terminal domains behave differently. Generally, the same NOEs are observed at either pH 2.5 or pH 5.3, indicating the presence of similar conformational populations. NOE magnitudes at pH 2.5, however, are reduced on average by about 10-20% relative to those observed at pH 5.3. Most NOE magnitudes observed within the mid-peptide region are unaffected by pH changes. Within the N-terminal segment, which becomes more flexible at lower pH, however, NOE magnitudes are generally reduced, suggesting a more “open” or less structured γ27 N-terminal conformation at pH 2.5. This is consistent with results from protein folding studies where decreasing the pH to 2-3 denatures or unfolds protein structures. Consistent with distance geometry structural calculations, Lys385 and the N-terminal amine may interact electrostatically with Glu396; and by neutralizing Glu396 by lowering pH these charge-charge interactions are minimized or negated, causing the N-terminal segment to become less conformationally and dynamically restricted, resulting in reduced NOE magnitudes. Unlike the N-terminal domain, the C-terminal segment, residues Ala405-Val411, becomes more motionally restricted at lower pH. In apparent contradiction to this, NOE magnitudes, particularly those of NH-NH, are reduced for these C-terminal residues, while the change in CD molar ellipticity translates into an approximately 15% increase in average helix content. For short linear peptides that exist in a highly dynamic conformational ensemble that displays some average “structure,” NOEs are difficult to interpret since they are affected both by changes in internuclear distances and by motional properties of the peptide. Increased negative CD ellipticities at 224 nm could be the result of increased β-turn character at the higher pH value, which would show a more positive absorption at 224 nm and would reduce the apparent negative ellipticity at 220 nm (Dyson et al., 1988a and 1988b). In this respect, these results suggest that the γ27 conformational ensemble is shifted to a more helical character at lower pH. Reduced NH-NH NOE magnitudes, for example, would be explained by increased average NH-NH internuclear distances in a helical conformation relative to a tight turn. In conclusion, this study has shown that for the more hydrophobic N-terminal segment that may be partially stabilized by electrostatic interactions, lowering the pH induces a more open, more dynamic conformational ensemble, while for the C-terminal segment lowering the pH shifts this ensemble to a more helical, less flexible conformational distribution. For γ27, pH has the effect of acting at the local, rather than global, conformational level. NMR experiments were performed at the University of Minnesota High Field-NMR Laboratory.

Our experiments have confirmed this role for the 5′ end of the bop mRNA that codes for the leader sequence, but we have found no requirement for the leader sequence itself in membrane insertion or assembly of BR. bacteriorhodopsin bacterio-opsin kilobase pair(s) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Lovastatin (also known as mevinolin) was a gift from Dr. A. W. Alberts (Merck Sharp and Dohme). NspI (Nsp7524 I) was obtained from Amersham Corp. Recombinant DNA procedures were carried out as described in (13Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1989Google Scholar) or 14 using enzymes and kits available from various commercial sources except as described below. The bop gene from H. halobium strain ET1001 (provided by Dr. R. Bogomolni, UC Santa Cruz) was cloned by probing a library of size-selected BamHI-NotI genomic fragments in pBS/KS(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with the oligonucleotide 5′-CGCCCATCCCTTTCACGAG. One of the positive clones was sequenced, and the bop coding region was found to be identical to the previously published sequence from an unidentified strain(1Dunn R. McCoy J. Simsek M. Majumdar A. Chang S.H. RajBhandary U.L. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6744-6748Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The BamHI-NotI fragment containing the bop gene was excised from the vector and ligated to the BamHI and HindIII sites of pUC19 (15Yanisch-Peron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11410) Google Scholar) using the adapter oligonucleotides 5′-GGCCGCGACCAGCGACTGATCTAGA and 5′-AGCTTCTAGATCAGTCGCTGGTCGC, which replace the last few codons of the bop gene 3′ of the NotI site and create XbaI and HindIII sites just 3′ of the termination codon. The BamHI-XbaI fragment containing the bop gene was cut out of this plasmid (designated pBO6) and ligated between the BamHI and XbaI sites of the shuttle vector pWL102(16Lam W.L. Doolittle W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5478-5482Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), which contains a gene conferring resistance to the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin in H. halobium, as well as a β-lactamase gene and an Escherichia coli origin of replication. The resulting plasmid was designated pXU3. An alternative strategy was also used in which the bop gene was excised from pBO6 as an EcoRI-HindIII fragment and inserted between the corresponding sites on pWL102. This results in deletion of the 3.8-kb HindIII fragment of pWL102 derived from pHV2 (16Lam W.L. Doolittle W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5478-5482Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) that had been inserted to allow replication of the plasmid in halobacteria. In our hands this fragment was unnecessary, because all of our pWL102-based constructs inserted into the chromosome and did not replicate as plasmids in H. halobium. Deletion of the leader sequence coding region was accomplished by replacing the NspI-AatII fragment of pXU3 that codes for the leader sequence and the first few amino acids of the mature protein with synthetic linkers. The oligonucleotides 5′-CAGGCCCAGATCACCGGACGT and 5′-CCGGTGATCTGGGCCTGCATG were used to make pXU10 (see Fig. 2), and pXU10A was made using 5′-AACGTCCAGGTGACCGGACGT and 5′-CCGGTCACCTGGACGTTCATG. Single base substitutions in the leader sequence coding region were made by amplifying the region of the bop gene from base 356 to 878 (numbering according to GenBank entry HHABO, where base 361 is the A of the ATG initiation codon) using the polymerase chain reaction with a mutagenic primer for the coding strand and the primer 5′-GCCTTCGAGGTGAACCCG for the complementary strand. The sense strand primers were: 5′-GTTGCATGTTGAAGTTATTGCC (G367→ A) for pXU13, 5′-GTTGCATGTTGGAATTATTGCC (G369→ A) for pXU14, and 5′-GTTGCATGTTAGAGTTATTGCC (G366→ A) for pXU15 (see Fig. 5). Amplifications were done for 30 cycles (1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 55°C, and 2 min at 72°C) using Pfu Polymerase (Stratagene) and pBO6 as a template in a variety of different thermal cyclers. The polymerase chain reaction amplification products were cut with NspI and KpnI, purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and then ligated to pWL102 together with the BamHI-NspI and KpnI-XbaI fragments of the wild-type bop gene in pXU3. Mutations were confirmed by sequencing the plasmids prior to transformation of H. halobium.Figure 5Proposed structure at the 5′ end of the bop mRNA.

A. 1983; 80: 2201-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which have a 1-kb ISH1 and a 0.5-kb ISH2 insertion, respectively, in the coding region of the bop gene, were transformed using the plasmids described above. The transformation procedure was essentially as described in (18Cline S.W. Lam W.L. Charlebois R.L. Schalkwyk L.C. Doolittle W.F. Can. J. Microbiol. 1989; 35: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 ml of log phase cells were spun down and resuspended in 2 ml of spheroplasting solution. 0.2-ml aliquots were added to 20 μl of 0.5 M EDTA in spheroplasting solution and gently agitated; this converted the cells to spheroplasts in less than 10 min for the strains we used. After 15 min, 5-10 μg of DNA in 20 μl was added, followed 5 min later by 240 μl of 60% polyethylene glycol 600 in spheroplasting solution; mixing was accomplished by gently tilting the tube back and forth. After 20 min of additional incubation at room temperature, 1 ml of regeneration salt solution was added. Cells were pelleted in a microcentrifuge at 4,000 rpm for 5 min, then resuspended in 1 ml of complex media (19Oesterhelt D. Stoeckenius W. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar) containing 15% sucrose, and incubated 18 h at 37°C. 100-μl samples were spread on plates containing complex media and 15% sucrose without drug and incubated for 5 days at 40°C. The bacteria were then harvested from the plates and spread on plates containing complex media and 16 μg/ml lovastatin. Alternatively, the transformed cells were incubated 2-3 days in complex media with sucrose and then spread directly on plates with drug. After about 10 days of incubation at 40°C, colonies were picked and grown in complex media with 16 μg/ml lovastatin, and their DNA and proteins were analyzed. Chromosomal DNA was isolated from H. halobium by a procedure similar to methods used for bacteria (13Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1989Google Scholar, 14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Manaitis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) involving lysis in 0.25 M Tris, 0.05 M EDTA, pH 8, followed by digestion with RNase A followed by digestion with proteinase K in the presence of 1% SDS, extractions with phenol, phenol/CHCl3, CHCl3, and ether, and two ethanol precipitations. H. halobium DNAs were digested with either SmaI or BamHI + NotI and run on 0.8% agarose gels in TAE buffer(13Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1989Google Scholar). The separated fragments were transferred to nitrocellulose or nylon membranes by Southern blotting(13Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1989Google Scholar), and the DNA was fixed to the membranes by microwaving the dried membranes for 2 min on “high”. Blots were hybridized first with a probe made from the BamHI-XbaI fragment containing the bop gene (see above) by nick translation or random priming using [α-32P]dCTP. Following autoradiography the blots were stripped and then reprobed with the synthetic oligonucleotides that had been used to make the mutation, which were labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The second hybridization was carried out at 50-60°C, and the washes that followed were in 6 × SSC at 37°C. Under these stringent conditions, the probes did not bind to wild-type bop DNA sequences on control lanes of the blot. H. halobium mRNA was isolated by a procedure recommended for Gram-positive bacteria (13Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1989Google Scholar). RNAs were separated on 1% agarose gels containing formaldehyde and transferred to nitrocellulose by Northern blotting(13Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1989Google Scholar). The blots were probed with the same nick-translated or random-primed bop gene probes used for the Southern blots. BR makes up a substantial fraction of the membrane protein in the H. halobium strains used in this study when they have a functional copy of the wild-type bop gene; the yield of BR upon purification by standard procedures (19Oesterhelt D. Stoeckenius W. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar) is dependent on the level of BR expression, because the formation of purple membrane patches requires a high density of BR in the membrane. We therefore quantitated the amounts of BR in the membranes of various mutant strains by looking at the amount of BR relative to other proteins and chromophores in crude membrane preparations. H. halobium strains were grown for 3 days after reaching stationary phase, and equivalent numbers of cells were used to prepare membranes as follows. Cell suspensions (25-50 ml) were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min; the cells were then lysed by resuspending the pellet in 2 ml of H2O and 0.1 mg DNase I and sonicating for 1-2 min using a cup horn. Membranes were pelleted by centrifugation for 1 h at 180,000 × g; the membrane pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of distilled H2O by sonication, recentrifuged twice, and then resuspended in 0.5-1 ml of H2O for spectrophotometric analysis. Spectra were obtained on a Varian Cary 3 at room temperature; the absorbance at 410 nm due to cytochromes in the membranes served as an internal standard to adjust the concentration of membranes used in each sample. Aliquots were also analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and staining with Coomassie Blue or silver. In some cases proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by Western blotting and probed with rabbit antibodies to BR, followed by goat anti-rabbit Ig conjugated to HRP and then color development using 4-chloronaphthol and H2O2. The soluble fraction of the cell lysate was also examined by these methods. 50-ml cultures of H. halobium were grown to an A600 of 1.0 under fluorescent lights in complex media and 4 μg/ml lovastatin. The cells were spun down at 1,000 × g for 15 min and resuspended in 10 ml of basal salts (medium without peptone; (19Oesterhelt D. Stoeckenius W. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar)) and 2.5 mg/ml L-alanine in a 15-ml conical tube. The tubes were rotated at 40°C under fluorescent lights for 2 h; then 2 μCi of [35S]methionine (>800 Ci/mmol) was added. After 2 h of incubation, a 2-ml aliquot was removed (pulse) and unlabeled L-methionine was added to the remaining 8 ml at a final concentration of 5 mg/ml. Incubation was continued and additional 2-ml samples were removed at times ranging from 2 to 48 h after addition of the chase. Each aliquot removed was immediately spun down at 5,000 × g for 5 min; the cells were lysed by addition of 0.5 ml of H2O and 0.1 ml 2.5 mg/ml DNase I and sonicated for 1 min at 0°C in a cup horn. Membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 180,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. Pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of H2O; 125 μl of acetone (−20°C) were added, mixed, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. The final pellet was resuspended and boiled for 5 min in 10 μl of gel loading buffer containing 2% SDS. Samples were electrophoresed on 17.5% acrylamide gels, which were fixed or stained and dried, and then exposed to a PhosphorImager cassette for 6-15 days. The phosphor screens were scanned in a Molecular Dynamics 400E PhosphorImager and analyzed using Image Quant software. In order to determine the role of the leader sequence in BR expression and membrane assembly, mutant bop genes had to be expressed in a H. halobium strain that did not make wild-type BR. Strains SD16 and SD9 (17DasSarma S. RajBhandary U.L. Khorana G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2201-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) were chosen for this purpose. SD16 has a 520-base pair ISH2 insertion near the 3′ end of the bop gene, whereas SD9 has a 1,118-base pair ISH1 insertion at the 5′ end of the bop gene coding region(17DasSarma S. RajBhandary U.L. Khorana G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2201-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). SD16 and SD9 cells were transformed with recombinant plasmids containing the wild-type bop gene (pXU3) or mutant bop genes (pXU10-15). Transformations resulted in lovastatin-resistant colonies that were either predominantly purple (due to production of BR) or orange-colored, like SD16 and SD9 cells. Growth of the transformed cells at the high levels of drug used for selection (16 μg/ml) was very slow, but control cells treated without the plasmid produced few or no colonies on the drug plates and less than 1% of the transformants with pXU3 were spontaneous drug-resistant mutants (orange colonies). In contrast, using 4 μg/ml lovastatin resulted in faster growth of transformed cells but high levels of spontaneously resistant cells in transformations without DNA and 50% or more orange colonies with pXU3. Whereas pWL102 is stably maintained in H. halobium, the presence of a bop gene insert in each case caused the plasmid to integrate into the chromosome at the site of the endogenous bop gene. DNA from the transformants was analyzed by digestion with SmaI, Southern blotting, and probing with a nick-translated bop gene fragment. SmaI sites are located 450 base pairs upstream and 1.7 kb downstream of the bop gene coding region, so in strains SD16 and SD9 the bop probe hybridizes with 3.5- and 4-kb fragments, respectively. All the transformants with pXU3 and pXU10-15 that were analyzed had a single band of ≥15 kb hybridizing to the probe in the SmaI digests, indicating that the entire plasmid was integrated into the chromosome at the bop locus. DNA from the transformed SD16 and SD9 cells was also analyzed by digestion with BamHI and NotI. The BamHI site is located 388 bases upstream of the initiation codon, and the NotI site is located 16 bases upstream of the termination codon, so that the BamHI-NotI fragment containing the bop coding region is about 1.2 kb in the wild-type gene and the recombinant genes on the plasmids but 0.5-1.1 kb larger in the SD16 and SD9 chromosomes (with their ISH insertions). Southern blots consistently showed two bands (1.2 and 1.7 or 2.3 kb) hybridizing with a nick-translated bop gene probe. For the transformants with pXU10 and the other mutant bop genes, the question remained whether recombination between the plasmid and the chromosome had occurred upstream or downstream of the mutation, because the latter would result in regeneration of a wild-type gene in the chromosome. The blots were stripped and reprobed with an oligonucleotide specific for the mutated sequence in order to determine which one of the two genes had the mutation, the one inactivated with the insertion (the larger BamHI-NotI fragment) or the one with that could be transcribed and translated to make the protein (1.2-kb band). In order to maximize the odds of obtaining transformants with functional mutant genes and inactivated wild-type genes, transformations with mutant bop genes were done using strain SD9. Because the ISH1 insertion is near the location of all the mutations introduced into the bop gene on the plasmids, recombination between the plasmid and the chromosome both upstream of the mutation (in the 5′-flanking region) or downstream of the mutation (and of the ISH1 insertion in the chromosome) would result in the mutant gene remaining intact. SD9 cells transformed with the various plasmids containing wild-type and mutant bop genes were analyzed using Southern blots of BamHI + NotI digests that were first probed with a random-primed bop gene and then stripped and reprobed with an oligonucleotide specific for the mutant sequence. In each case the smaller (1.2 kb) band containing the uninterrupted bop gene hybridized to the mutant probe, whereas the larger (2.3 kb) band containing the ISH1 insertion did not. This is shown for two transformants with pXU10A in Fig. 3. Transformations of SD16 with mutant bop genes, on the other hand, frequently resulted in regeneration of a wild-type bop gene. SD16 and SD9 cells transformed with pXU3 (the latter is referred to as strain XU3 below) produced BR at levels comparable to that of strain S9, the BR-overproducing strain from which SD9 and SD16 had been derived(17DasSarma S. RajBhandary U.L. Khorana G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2201-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, SD9 cells transformed with pXU10 (strain XU10), the leader sequence deletion mutant (Fig. 2), did not produce BR at levels detectable by SDS-PAGE using Coomassie Blue or silver staining or by examination of the visible spectrum of membranes from XU10 cells (not shown). Western blots of XU10 membranes showed extremely faint bands that co-migrated with BR, which could not be reproduced photographically. In order to determine whether this lack of BR expression was due to lack of transcription of the bop gene with the deletion or lack of translation of the mRNA, RNA was isolated from XU10 and XU3 cells and analyzed by Northern blotting (Fig. 4). The bop mRNA in XU10 cells was found to be degraded to low molecular weight fragments that nevertheless still hybridized to the bop probe; the XU3 cells were always found to have only intact bop mRNA with the expected molecular weight as shown in Fig. 4. In order to test the theory that the bases coding for the leader peptide at the 5′ end of the bop mRNA also act as the ribosome-binding site and form a hairpin secondary structure, three point mutations were introduced in this part of the sequence (Fig. 5). In each case a single G in pXU3 was changed to an A by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis to make pXU13, pXU14, and pXU15; these were used to transform SD9 cells and create strains XU13, XU14, and XU15, respectively, and proper integration of each intact mutant gene in the chromosome checked by Southern blot analysis as described above. In XU13 the mutation results in the third amino acid residue of the leader sequence changing from Glu to Lys; XU14 and XU15 have silent mutations, so any changes in BR expression in these strains cannot be due to altered protein folding, processing or membrane assembly. All three mutations cause mismatches in the proposed base pairing of the mRNA to the H. halobium 16S rRNA (Fig. 5); the mutations in XU13 and XU15 also decrease the stability of the proposed hairpin stem secondary structure. Colonies and cultures of the three mutant strains appeared less purple than those of XU3 or S9. The amount of BR produced by strains XU13, XU14, and XU15 was compared with that of XU3, which has the same genetic background but no mutation in the bop gene, by looking at the spectra of membranes prepared from similar amounts of cells (Fig. 6). The spectra showed that XU13, XU14, and XU15 cells produced less than half as much BR as XU3. The experiment was repeated three times, and the relative amounts of BR (570 nm absorbance) found in strains XU13, XU14, and XU15 varied slightly but was consistently less than 50% of that in XU3 and distinctly more than in XU10A. The relative amounts of BR in the various strains was also compared by examining the intensities of the BO polypeptide bands when SDS-PAGE gels were run on the membranes (Fig. 7). The intensities of the bands on the SDS-PAGE gel shown in Fig. 7 did not show much difference between XU13 and XU14, and the band for XU10A is barely detectable on the photograph. These results were consistent with the spectra taken on that set of membrane samples, which were not the ones used for Fig. 6. The gels also showed that the BR in all the strains, including that of XU13 with its altered leader peptide sequence, was fully processed to the mature form by removal of the 13 amino-terminal amino acids. The soluble fractions of the cells (not shown) did not contain any BR.Figure 7SDS-PAGE gel of membranes from H. halobium mutants stained with Coomassie Blue. Lane 1, SD9 transformed with pWL102; lane 2, XU3; lane 3, XU13; lane 4, XU14; lane 5, XU10A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Northern blots showed that the bop mRNA in XU13, XU14, and XU15 was the same size as in XU3 and was not degraded like that of XU10 (Fig. 4). The variations in intensity between the bands were probably due to differences in yield during RNA isolation and were reflected in the intensity of the total RNA staining with ethidium bromide in each lane on the gel used for the Northern blot (not shown). In order to test further the hypothesis that the coding region for the leader sequence at the 5′ end of the mRNA functions as a ribosome-binding site and is important for mRNA stability, we constructed a new mutant, designated XU10A. This mutant had the same deletion of the codons for the leader sequence as XU10 and additional mutations in the region coding for the first four residues of the mature protein that resulted in the 5′ end of the mRNA again having complementarity to the 16S rRNA and the potential to make a stem and loop secondary structure (see Fig. 2). These were either silent mutations or conservative substitutions (Gln → Asn, Ile → Val, Ala → Val) in order to minimize any effects on protein folding or stability. This amino-terminal region of the protein protrudes on the exterior side of the membrane in H. halobium and is not resolved in the three-dimensional structure of wild-type BR(20Henderson R. Baldwin J.M. Ceska T.A. Zemlin F. Beckmann E. Downing K.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 899-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (2507) Google Scholar). XU10A cells were pink, in contrast to the orange SD9 and XU10 or the purple XU3 cultures. Northern blots showed no degradation for XU10A mRNA (Fig. 4). The spectrum of XU10A membranes showed a peak at 570 nm characteristic of BR, which appeared as a shoulder on the carotenoid peak similar to that in XU14 membranes (Fig. 6). A faint BR band could also be detected on SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 7). The relative amounts of polypeptide detected on gels are consistent with the amounts of the chromophore detected in spectra, indicating that most or all of the BO produced had bound retinal to form BR, which produces the characteristic absorption spectrum. No BR could be detected in spectra nor gels run on the soluble fraction of XU10A cells (not shown). XU3, XU10A, and XU14 cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine followed by a chase with unlabeled methionine, and the labeled proteins examined by SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImager analysis (Fig. 8). In all three strains no significant turnover of BR in the membranes could be detected over a period of 48 h after dilution of the label. The amount of label incorporated was lowest in XU10A and highest in XU3, reflecting the amounts of BR found in the strains cultured in rich media (see above and Fig. 6 and Fig. 7). No labeled BR was ever found in the soluble fractions of XU3, XU14, or XU10A cells. Transformation of H. halobium SD16 and SD9 with the wild-type bop gene fully restored expression of BR; this was not surprising, because the wild-type gene had been inserted back into the chromosome at the bop locus. Efficient expression of the wild-type bop gene in strain L33 (which has an ISH2 insertion in the bop coding region like SD16) using a similar plasmid has been reported previously by Needleman's group(21Ni B. Chang M. Duschl A. Lanyi J. Needleman R. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 90: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Their plasmid also contained the brp gene upstream of bop and was usually, but not always, found integrated into the chromosome(21Ni B. Chang M. Duschl A. Lanyi J. Needleman R. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 90: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The reason we never found transformants with plasmids containing a bop gene that had not integrated into the chromosome may be a loss of unintegrated plasmids during the prolonged incubation period without drug selection. The lack of BR production in the leader sequence deletion mutant XU10 was most likely caused by the degradation of the mRNA and perhaps lack of translation of any remaining message due to deletion of the putative ribosome-binding site, which is in the region coding for the leader sequence (see Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). This ribosome-binding site is downstream of the initiation codon, unlike those of eubacteria, which are upstream of the initiation codon but similarly complementary to the 3′ end of the 16S rRNA. Secondary structure and ribosome binding at the 5′ end of the bop mRNA apparently enhances the efficiency of translation by an unknown mechanism but does not interfere with the binding of complementary tRNAs to these bases when translation is initiated. Strains XU14 and XU15 have only silent mutations and produce wild-type BR; their bop mRNA was produced in normal amounts and was not found degraded, so the reduced level of BR expression in these strains must be due to decreased translation of bop mRNA. In the case of XU13, the presence of an amino acid substitution that created a major difference in the net charge of the leader peptide did not cause any additional reduction in the amount of BR found compared with XU15. Both XU13 and XU15 have mRNA sequences that are predicted to have reduced binding to the 16S rRNA as well as reduced stability of the mRNA secondary structure. This perturbation of the hairpin secondary structure would not occur in XU14, but the level of BR in this mutant was on average comparable with that of XU13 and XU15. This suggests that the ribosome-binding sequence determines the level of translation and the exact secondary structure of the hairpin may not be critical for translation. The presence of a hairpin may, however, be required to prevent rapid mRNA degradation. The results obtained with the modified leader sequence deletion mutant XU10A indicate that the presence of a ribosome-binding sequence and/or hairpin loop at the 5′ end of the bop mRNA in XU10A was sufficient to stabilize the mRNA and facilitate a modest level of translation. The reason that the level of BR expression was significantly less than that in XU3 may be because the new ribosome-binding site and secondary structure are not very close replicas of those in the wild-type bop gene. In fact, the structure of XU10A mRNA is in some ways more similar to that of the hop gene mRNA (see Fig. 1). This gene, coding for the protein halorhodopsin, is expressed at much lower levels than bop(22Steiner M. Oesterhelt D. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 1379-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Consistent with this interpretation is the observation that bop-hop fusions in which the 5′ untranslated region (including the promoter) of the bop gene is fused to the hop coding region do not significantly increase the level of hop expression, but fusions that include a portion of the bop coding region (and therefore the bop ribosome-binding site) result in a high level of production of halorhodopsin (23Heymann J.A.W. Havelka W.A. Oesterhelt D. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). 2R. Needleman, personal communication. Similarly, fusion of the bop promoter to the sopI (sensory opsin I) gene does not significantly increase expression of sopI, but fusions that also include the first 13 or 21 codons of the bop gene result in much higher expression levels(24Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16095-16097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The BR produced in XU10A was assembled with the retinal chromophore, and it was all found integrated into the H. halobium membrane. We were unable to extract it from the other membrane components by high salt washes or density gradient centrifugation. Therefore, the leader peptide must not be required for proper folding or membrane insertion. It may, however, facilitate these processes in wild-type cells (i.e. the leader peptide may have a role in the kinetics of protein folding or membrane insertion). In either case, the absence of the leader may result in misfolding or improper targeting of a substantial fraction of the newly synthesized polypeptide. Ribosomes translating the bop gene have been found bound to membranes and to a 7S RNA with a proposed signal recognition particle (SRP)-like function(4Gropp R. Gropp F. Betlach M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1204-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); these interactions may involve the leader sequence and enhance the efficiency of membrane insertion. An altered amino-terminal sequence might also result in increased turnover of the BR in the membrane, but this was not observed. The pulse-chase results suggest that the level of BR expression is determined by the rate of synthesis. Unfortunately, the rate of incorporation of labeled methionine into BR in XU10A cells was too slow to allow pulses shorter than 2 h. Therefore one cannot rule out the possibility that much of the BO polypeptide in this strain is rapidly degraded before it has a chance to be integrated into the membrane, because it is inefficiently translocated or misfolds in the absence of the leader sequence.

https://openalex.org/W2019448663,"Retinoic acid exerts its many biological effects by interaction with a nuclear protein, the retinoic acid receptor (RAR). The details of this interaction are unknown due mainly to the lack of sufficient quantities of pure functional receptor protein for biochemical and structural studies. We have recently subcloned the D and E domains of human RARγ for expression in Escherichia coli. Using nickel-chelation affinity chromatography with a polyhistidine amino-terminal tail, purification of the DE peptide with a pI of 5.18 was accomplished to greater than 98% purity. Scatchard analysis and fluorescence quenching techniques using the purified protein indicate a very high percentage of functional molecules (>95%) with a Kd for retinoic acid (t-RA) of 0.6 ± 0.1 nM. Circular dichroism spectra of the purified domains predict a predominantly α-helical structure (∼56%) with little β sheet present. No significant changes in these structural characteristics were observed upon binding of t-RA. Inspection of the amino acid sequence within these domains identified a single tryptophan residue at position 227. Modeling the amino acid sequence in this region as an α-helical structure indicates that this tryptophan is adjacent to alanine 234, which corresponds to alanine 225 in RARβ that has previously been linked to the ligand binding site. Fluorescence of this tryptophan was quenched in a dose-dependent manner on the addition of t-RA, confirming that Trp-227 is within the ligand binding site. Tryptophan flourescence quenching analysis also demonstrates that a single retinoic acid molecule is bound per receptor and suggests that receptor-ligand interactions occur within the amino-terminal portion of the predominantly α-helical ligand binding domain.

Expression of subfragments corresponding to the RAR ligand binding domain (i.e. domains DEF, EF, etc.) in E. coli improved yields as compared to expression of full-length receptors(17Crettaz M.

Karger, Basel, Switzerland1991: 110-120Google Scholar). However, in every case, regardless of yield, the purified receptor preparations were insufficiently active with respect to ligand binding and were therefore unsuitable for structural or biochemical analysis. Improved expression and purification techniques described here using nickel chelation chromatography and a modified thrombin cleavage produced milligram quantities of hRARγ receptor protein containing the D and E domains. This DEγ protein was found to have binding kinetics similar to that of the native full-length receptor. Circular dichroism analysis of the expressed protein suggests that the secondary structure of the ligand binding domain is predominantly α-helical and contains very little β sheet. This observation is in good agreement with the reported crystal structure of the ligand binding domain of RXRα, a closely related member of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily(24Bourquet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar), and that determined from structure prediction modeling. Interestingly, the relative pattern of secondary structural components for this peptide did not change significantly upon binding to ligand. Inspection of the amino acid sequence within the D and E domains revealed a single tryptophan residue at position 227, which was subsequently used for fluorimetric titration. At a concentration of protein determined by amino acid analysis, fluorescence was quenched in a dose-dependent manner upon addition of t-RA with a transition point equal to the concentration of protein in the reaction. Cogan analysis (33Cogan U. Kopelman M. Mokady S. Shinitzky M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) of this curve indicates a single ligand binding site within DEγ. Further, the position of the transition point indicates that >95% of the receptor protein is present in an active conformation and that Trp-227 is located in close proximity to the ligand binding site. The assignment of Trp-227 within the ligand binding site is further supported by a previous report that Ala-234 (Ala-225 in RARβ) is a contact amino acid within the ligand binding site(25Ostrowski J. Hammer L. Roalsvig T. Pokornowski K. Reczek P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1812-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In an α-helical structure, this alanine would be expected to be immediately adjacent to Trp-227 supporting a structural model for the ligand binding pocket. Expression vector pET15b, host strain E. coli BL21(DE3), restriction grade thrombin and His•bind™ resin were purchased from Novagen, Inc. pSG5/hRARγ was kindly provided by Dr. P. Chambon(26Krust A. Kastner P.H. Petkovich M. Zelent A. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5310-5314Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Taq polymerase, PCR buffers, and deoxynucleoside triphosphates were obtained from Perkin-Elmer Corp. Amplification was performed in an Ericomp Easycycler™ (San Diego). Ligand binding assays were carried out with t-RA, retinol, and retinal purchased from Sigma and [11,12-3H]t-RA (47.5 Ci/mmol) from Dupont NEN. 9-cis RA was synthesized by Bristol-Myers Squibb Central Chemistry (Wallingford, CT). Retinoids were used under yellow fluorescent light to minimize photodegradation. Oligonucleotides used in the PCR reactions were synthesized by Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc. (Woodlands, TX). Restriction enzymes and DNA ligase were purchased from New England BioLabs, Inc. All other chemicals used were of reagent grade and purchased from Sigma. The truncated DEγ receptor cDNA was constructed and amplified from the full-length hRARγ cDNA (26Krust A. Kastner P.H. Petkovich M. Zelent A. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5310-5314Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) using PCR with the upstream forward primer 1 (36-mer) 5′-CTCGCATAGACCCATATGTCCAAGGAAGCTGTGCGA-3′ and the downstream reverse primer 2 (35-mer) 5′-GCGCGCGGATCC(TTA)CATTTCAGGGTTCTCCAGCA-3′. The underlined nucleotides in each primer represent the hybridizing portion, and the nucleotides in boldface type specify the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites, respectively. The codon specifying the translation stop is in parentheses in primer 2. After 5 min of preheating at 95°C, each of 20 PCR cycles was composed as follows: denaturation, 1 min at 94°C; annealing, 1 min at 55°C; and synthesis, 2 min at 72°C. The 50-μl PCR mixture contained 50 pmol of each primer, 3 ng of pSG5/hRARγ vector, 0.2 mM deoxynucleotide triphosphates, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.001% gelatin, and 1.0 unit of Taq polymerase. Following amplification, the reaction was extracted with an equal volume of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1) and then precipitated and washed with 100% ethanol. The resultant cDNA was digested to completion with NdeI and BamHI and gel purified and ligated into the similarly digested recipient pET15b vector. The ligation mixture was used to transform competent E. coli strain DH5α cells. The sequence of the ligated insert from a transformed colony was confirmed using a modification of the Sanger dideoxy method (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and was designated pET15b/DEγ. For the preparative purification of the HIS6-DEγ fusion, 12 × 106 BL21(DE3)/pET15b-DEγ cells were introduced into 1 liter of minimal media (MM/C) (42 mM Na2HPO4-7H2O, 22 mM KH2PO4, 8.6 mM NaCl, 19 mM NH4Cl, 5 μg/ml FeCl3-6H2O, 1 mM MgSO4-7H2O, 100 μM CaCl2, 0.0001% thiamine, 0.4% glucose, 50 μg/ml carbenicillin) prewarmed to 37°C. The inoculum was freshly prepared in MM/C from a frozen stock of the expression host BL21(DE3)/pET15b-DEγ. The cells were grown at 37°C in a New Brunswick model G25 shaker at 350 rpm. At 1.0 A600 (approximately 18 h), the temperature of the culture was rapidly shifted to 26°C by swirling on ice water. Expression of the fusion protein was induced with 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (Boehringer Mannheim) for 2 h at 26°C with continuous shaking at 350 rpm. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,200 × g for 5 min at 4°C, resuspended in 50 ml of ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. After addition of lysozyme and Triton X-100 to final concentrations of 200 μg/ml and 0.1%, respectively, the cells were quickly frozen on dry ice, thawed at 30°C, and then sonicated for 30 s until no longer viscous. After the addition of NaCl to 0.5 M, the lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C. The protein concentration in the supernatant (crude soluble cytoplasmic extract) was determined by the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as the standard(27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (217529) Google Scholar). The DEγ protein was purified from 150-200 ml of crude soluble cytoplasmic extract in a batchwise fashion by mixing with a 5-ml bed volume of Ni2+-charged His•Bind resin equilibrated in binding buffer (5 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9). The resin was purchased from Novagen and prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. After gently rotating 45-60 min at room temperature, the resin was packed into a 2.5 × 100-cm Econocolumn (Bio-Rad) and washed six times by resuspension in 50 ml of binding buffer, followed by four washes in 50 ml of wash buffer (60 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9). When the concentration of protein in the final wash was less than 100 μg/ml, the resin was equilibrated with cleavage buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2). The amount of protein bound to the resin was determined by the Bradford method(27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (217529) Google Scholar). Thrombin (Novagen) was added to a final concentration of 0.5 units/mg protein in a volume of 20-30 ml of cleavage buffer and allowed to cleave for 12-14 h at 25°C while rotating slowly in a vessel with no discernible airspace. The column was drained and then rinsed with cleavage buffer without CaCl2. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to the eluate from a 100 mM stock to a final concentration of 0.1 mM to inhibit thrombin activity. The purity of the DEγ protein was determined by laser densitometry of silver-stained 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207529) Google Scholar) and by amino acid analysis. 2Amino acid analysis of the purified DEγ protein was done in the Harvard Microchemistry Facility of Dr. William S. Lane. The isoelectric point of the purified DEγ protein was determined using the Pharmacia Phast System. Pharmacia broad pI calibration standards were run in parallel lanes with DEγ on a Phast Gel IEF 3-9. The gel was prefocused at 2000 volts, 2.5 mA, 3.5 watts for 75 V-h at 15°C. After loading and prerunning the gel at 200 V, 2.5 mA, 3.5 watts for 15 V-h at 15°C, the samples were focused for 410 V-h under the same conditions as in the prefocusing step. The gel was silver stained according to the manufacturer's instructions and dried under hot air for 10 min. Migration distances for each of the standards were measured and plotted versus isoelectric points. The pI for the DEγ protein was determined by comparison with this standard curve. In binding assays and competition experiments, 1.0-3.0 pmol of purified DEγ receptor protein plus 3.5 μg of uninduced crude extract, which served as a carrier and had negligible specific binding of its own, was routinely added to binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl) giving a final volume of 1.0 ml. In the binding assays, the protein was incubated with 0.1-10.0 nM [3H]t-RA. For competition experiments, the protein mixture was preincubated with 1.0 nM [3H]t-RA at 4°C for 30 min, after which various concentrations of unlabeled retinoids solubilized in EtOH were added. The final concentration of EtOH did not exceed 1-2% (v/v). The reactions were carried out in the dark at 4°C for 16 h, after which 0.5-ml ice-cold equivalent particle size, lyophilized dextran-coated charcoal (EqDCC), prepared according to Dokoh et al.(29Dokoh S. Pike J.W. Chandler J.S. Mancini J.M. Haussler M.R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 116: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), was added. The samples were vortexed, placed on ice for 10 min, and then centrifuged 15 min at 14,000 × g at 4°C. Total dpm of the supernatants was measured in a Beckman LS6000 IC scintillation counter. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 100-fold molar excess unlabeled t-RA. Scatchard analysis (30Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17815) Google Scholar) was performed for determination of Kd. Apparent Kd values for t-RA, 9-cis RA, retinol, and retinal were calculated using the IC50 determined from competition curves and the Clark equation(31Clark A.J. The mode of Action of Drugs on Cells. Arnold, London1933Google Scholar). CD spectra were recorded with a Jasco J720 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Inc., Tokyo). The instrument was calibrated at ambient temperature such that a 1 mg/ml solution of (+)-10-camphor sulfonic acid had an ellipticities ratio of 2.0 when measured at 192.5 and 290 nm in a cell with a 0.1-mm optical path length. All experimental measurements were made at ambient room temperature (22.2 ± 0.1°C) on samples of 50 μM protein in buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 0.025 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. In some samples, t-RA was added in equimolar amounts to protein. CD spectra were recorded using buffer alone as the base line. For each sample, four spectra were collected and averaged (two spectra for two separate preparations of each sample). All spectra are reported in terms of molar ellipticity, [θ], where [θ] = θMRW/(10Lc) and θMRW is the measured mean residue ellipticity, L is the path length, and c is the protein concentration. CD spectra were deconvoluted by least squares analysis with the four-basis set of Yang and co-workers(32Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Martinez H. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar). Estimates of secondary structure were obtained by normalizing the fitted parameters to yield percentages of helix, sheet, turn, or random coil. Fluorescence measurements were made with a Perkin-Elmer model LS-5B (Perkin-Elmer Corp.) luminescence spectrometer at 25°C using a slit width of 5 nm. t-RA was added to a 5 μM solution of purified DEγ protein in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl. The protein concentration was determined by amino acid analysis.2 The final concentration of EtOH in each reaction mixture did not exceed 2% (v/v). Protein quenching was monitored at 280 nm excitation and 340 nm emission. Calculation of n (number of binding sites) was performed by the method of Cogan et al.(33Cogan U. Kopelman M. Mokady S. Shinitzky M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Briefly, a plot of Poα versus Ro (α/1-α) was made, where Po = protein concentration and Ro = retinoid concentration. α is determined by (F - Fmax)/(Fo - Fmax) where Fo = initial fluorescence, F = fluorescence at each Ro, and Fmax = fluorescence at maximum quench. The resulting straight line has a slope of 1/n. For denaturation studies, flourescence measurements were obtained by diluting the purified DEγ protein in 6 M guanidine HCl, and emission spectra were obtained as described above in the absence of t-RA. The structural predictions for the DEγ protein were performed using the Gene-Works 2.4 DNA-protein analysis software (IntelliGenetics, Inc.). The host E. coli strain, BL21(DE3), transformed with the vector pET15b/DEγ, produces a protein of the predicted molecular mass for HIS6-DEγ (approximately 32.4 kDa) upon induction with 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (Fig. 1, lane 1). This protein was not detectable in uninduced cells, nor was it detected in cells transformed with the parent vector alone, pET15b (data not shown). About 90% of the HIS6-DEγ expressed was present in the soluble fraction when induced as described. The remainder was recovered in the insoluble pellet formed by centrifugation of the lysate at 15,000 × g. Induction in minimal media at 26°C for 2 h was critical to the expression of HIS6-DEγ in the soluble fraction. Induction at 30°C for 2 h reduced the level of soluble fusion protein by 50%, while induction at 37°C for 2 h reduced the level beyond detection. The hydrophilic D domain appears to be important for the expression of soluble protein, since similar constructs of the E domain, which did not contain the D domain, were expressed entirely as insoluble inclusion bodies (data not shown). The HIS6-DEγ peptide was purified from the crude soluble cytoplasmic extract by nickel chelation chromatography. The yield was approximately 7 mg of DEγ from 383 mg of crude protein (Table 1) representing about 2% of the total soluble protein and is reported as the average of five experiments. The HIS6-DEγ fusion is undetectable in the void volume (Fig. 1, lane 2), indicating that the expressed fusion protein was efficiently bound to the affinity resin. Repeated washing of the affinity column with 60 volumes of a 5 mM imidazole buffer followed by 40 volumes of a 60 mM imidazole buffer was necessary to completely remove contaminating E. coli proteins from the resin.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The purified DEγ protein was eluted by thrombin cleavage of the resin-bound HIS6-DEγ fusion. Based on quantitative estimates using laser densitometry, greater than 85% of the HIS6-DEγ peptide was cleaved by thrombin. Approximately 60% of the cleaved product was recovered in the column eluate, and the purity of this protein was greater than 98% (Fig. 1, lane 5). Results from amino acid analysis of the protein in this fraction indicate that the composition of residues in the purified DEγ protein is consistent with that determined from the primary sequence2 so that the protein preparation is unlikely to be contaminated. Subsequent treatment of the column with buffer containing 400 mM imidazole elutes the remaining DEγ protein (Fig. 1, lane 6). Since the DEγ in this fraction does not bind retinoic acid (data not shown) and spontaneously precipitates upon collection, it most likely contains molecules that are incorrectly folded. The isoelectric point (pI) for the purified DEγ protein was determined on a Pharmacia IEF 3-9 Phast Gel and was found to be 5.2. This experimentally obtained pI value is in good agreement with that calculated from the primary amino acid sequence (5.18) (Fig. 2). The ligand binding properties of DEγ were first analyzed using a modified charcoal absorption binding assay. Fig. 3a depicts the binding of [3H]t-RA to purified DEγ protein. Scatchard analysis of this data gives a linear plot indicating a single class of binding sites (Fig. 3b) with a dissociation constant, Kd = 0.6 ± 0.1 nM (n = 3), in good agreement with the Kd determined for full-length RARγ from nuclear extracts of transiently transfected COS cells(7Allenby G.

Results for other naturally occurring retinoids were obtained from competition experiments (Table 2) using the purified DEγ protein or crude bacterial extracts containing full-length hRARγ. The order of binding was similar for both sources of receptor protein (i.e. t-RA > 9-cis RA > retinol > retinal). A similar order of binding has been previously reported for the full-length receptor protein(7Allenby G. Bocquel M.T. Saunders M. Kazmer S. Speck J. Rosenberger M. Lovey A. Kastner P. Grippo J.

Fig. 4B shows the CD spectrum obtained for 50 μM purified DEγ protein. In the absence of t-RA (line b), α-helix content is indicated by the negative ellipticity with minima at 222 and 208 nm and a peak maximum near 192 nm. Deconvolution of this spectrum with the unconstrained four-basis set of Yang and co-workers (32Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Martinez H. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar) suggests that DEγ contains a large portion of helical conformation (25-30%) with little β sheet (<8%). Constraint of the basis set such that the sum of the secondary structures is equal to 100% increases the estimated helical content to 56% and decreases the β sheet to 0%. This result agrees well with the Garnier prediction (34Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3423) Google Scholar) for this protein depicted in Fig. 4A. The CD spectrum for DEγ in the presence of 106Mt-RA was also recorded (Fig. 4B, line a). The magnitude of the peaks at 222, 208, and 192 nm all increased, suggesting an increase in the helical content of the ligand-bound protein. However, upon unconstrained deconvolution, differences between the CD spectra in the presence or absence of t-RA were slight; the α-helical content increased to 29-34% (from 25-30%) with no change in the amount of detectable β sheet. These results suggest that a major change in the secondary structure of the DEγ protein is not occurring upon ligand binding. However, changes in the tertiary structure of the protein not detected by CD analysis may still have profound consequences for protein function.

https://openalex.org/W2057936777,"The interaction of fibrinogen Aα1-50-β-galactosidase fusion protein with the slow and fast forms of thrombin was studied and compared to thrombin-fibrinogen interaction under identical solution conditions. At equilibrium, the affinity of the fusion protein for the slow form of thrombin is 3 times higher than its affinity for the fast form. The fusion protein and fibrinogen have the same affinity for the fast form. On the other hand, the affinity of the fusion protein for the slow form of thrombin is 40 times tighter than that of fibrinogen. In the transition state, binding of the fusion protein has the same properties as fibrinogen, with the fast form showing higher specificity. The N-terminal fragment of the fibrinogen Aα chain thus contains residues that are responsible for the preferential binding of the fusion protein to the slow form at equilibrium and to the fast form in the transition state. If this fragment binds to thrombin in a similar way for fibrinogen and the fusion protein, then the N-terminal domains of the Bβ and γ chains of fibrinogen, that are not present in the fusion protein, must play a key role in the binding of fibrinogen to thrombin at equilibrium. These chains may destabilize binding to the slow form by nearly 2.4 kcal/mol, thereby favoring binding of fibrinogen to the fast form. We propose that the three chains of fibrinogen play different roles in the thrombin-fibrinogen interaction, with the Aα chain containing residues for preferential binding to the fast form in the transition state and the Bβ and γ chains containing residues that destabilize binding to the slow form at equilibrium.

Thrombin is an allosteric serine protease involved in blood coagulation. The enzyme exists in two forms, slow and fast(1Wells C.M. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11721-11730Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), that have been targeted toward anticoagulant and procoagulant activities (2Dang Q.D. Vindigni A. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5977-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The fast form preferentially cleaves fibrinogen, while the slow form cleaves protein C with higher specificity. The molecular basis of preferential binding of fibrinogen to the fast form (3Mathur A. Schlapkohl W.A. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7568-7573Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) has been discussed in connection with the interaction of thrombin with the potent natural inhibitor hirudin(4Ayala Y. Di Cera E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 733-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Hirudin and fibrinogen bind to thrombin by making contacts with residues located not only in and around the catalytic pocket, but also in the fibrinogen binding loop. This loop is separate from the catalytic pocket and is homologous to the Ca2+ binding loop of trypsin and chymotrypsin(5Rydel T.J. Tulinsky A. Bode W. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 583-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 6Tulinsky A. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1991; 66: 16-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 7Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A.

Schlapkohl W.A. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7568-7573Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 4Ayala Y. Di Cera E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 733-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Energetic mapping of hirudin binding (4Ayala Y. Di Cera E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 733-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and recent site-directed mutagenesis studies 1Guinto, E. R., Vindigni, A., Ayala, Y., Dang, Q. D., and Di Cera, E.(1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., in press. have led to the conclusion that most of the preferential binding of hirudin to the fast form arises from interaction with residues in and around the catalytic pocket. The fibrinogen binding loop provides only a small contribution to the coupling with the allosteric transition. Whether a similar conclusion can be drawn in the case of the structural origin of preferential binding of fibrinogen to the fast form of thrombin remains to be established. A useful model substrate for thrombin is the tripartite protein consisting of residues 1-50 of the fibrinogen Aα chain linked by a 59-residue segment of collagen to Escherichia coli β-galactosidase(10Lord S.T. Fowlkes D.M. Blood. 1989; 73: 166-171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The central domain of fibrinogen, represented by the CNBr fragment containing Aα chain residues 1-51, Bβ chain residues 1-118, and γ residues 1-78, makes contact with both the catalytic pocket and the fibrinogen binding loop in thrombin (11Binnie C.G. Lord S.T. Blood. 1993; 81: 3186-3192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the tripartite fusion protein lacks the N-terminal domains of the Bβ and γ chains of fibrinogen, it represents a simplified model for studying molecular recognition events involved in the thrombin-fibrinogen interaction. Specifically, comparative studies of the fusion protein and fibrinogen may shed light on the relative contribution of the three chains of fibrinogen. Functional studies indicate that the FpA 2The abbreviations used are: FpAfibrinopeptide AHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyNSDKN-terminal disulfide knotPEGpoly(ethylene glycol)S2238H-D-Phe-pipecolyl-Arg-p-nitroanilide. consisting of residues 1-16 of the Aα chain is cleaved from the fusion protein by thrombin at a rate comparable to that of fibrinogen(12Lord S.T. Byrd P.A. Hede K.L. Wei C. Colby T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 838-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This result suggests that the Bβ and γ chains may have little influence on the interaction of the Aα chain with thrombin. However, perturbation of the N-terminal portion of the Bβ chain of fibrinogen often results in impaired clotting activity(13Liu C.Y. Koehn J.A. Morgan F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4390-4396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Siebenlist K.R. DiOrio J.P. Budzynsky A.Z. Mosesson M.W. J. Biol.

Invest. 1992; 90: 238-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and interaction of all three chains with the fibrinogen binding loop seems to be crucial for the correct hydrolysis of fibrinogen by thrombin(11Binnie C.G. Lord S.T. Blood. 1993; 81: 3186-3192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kaczmarek E. McDonagh J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13896-13900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In an attempt to dissect the contribution of Aα1-50 from the N-terminal portion of the three fibrinogen chains, we have decided to explore the interaction of the fusion protein with the slow and fast forms of thrombin at equilibrium and in the transition state. Comparison of the results with those obtained with fibrinogen under identical solution conditions indicates that the Bβ and γ chains play an important role in the preferential binding of fibrinogen to the fast form by destabilizing binding to the slow form. The fibrinogen Aα chain, on the other hand, contains all the structural epitopes for preferential cleavage by the fast form. Therefore, the N-terminal portions of the three chains of fibrinogen seem to have been targeted toward different roles in molecular recognition of this substrate by the slow and fast forms of thrombin. fibrinopeptide A high performance liquid chromatography N-terminal disulfide knot poly(ethylene glycol) H-D-Phe-pipecolyl-Arg-p-nitroanilide.

The chromogenic substrate S2238 was purchased from Chromogenix (Molndal, Sweden). The fusion protein was expressed, purified, and tested for activity as described(10Lord S.T. Fowlkes D.M. Blood. 1989; 73: 166-171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lord S.T. Byrd P.A. Hede K.L. Wei C. Colby T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 838-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The release of FpA from the fusion protein was quantified by reverse-phase HPLC (18Ng A.S. Lewis S.D. Shafer J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 341-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) using a Vydac C18 column. Elution was carried out at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, with a gradient containing 25 mM Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 buffer at pH 6.0 (solvent A) and 50% acetonitrile in solvent A (solvent B). Optimal separation was obtained using a 30-min linear gradient to 40% of solvent B. The effluent was monitored at 206 nm. A molar absorption coefficient for FpA was determined by calibration curves. The slow and fast forms of thrombin were studied under experimental conditions of 5 mM Tris, 0.1% PEG, pH 8.0, at 25°C, in the presence of 200 mM ChCl (slow form) or NaCl (fast form). Progress curves for the release of FpA were analyzed using the expression for first-order kinetics shown in Equation 1, where eT is the active thrombin concentration, t is time, kcat and Km refer to the hydrolysis of FpA, [F] is the concentration of FpA at time t, and [F]∞ is the asymptotic concentration of FpA. [F]=[F]∞{1-exp(-kcatKmeTt)}(Eq. 1) This value was consistent with the concentration of fusion protein estimated from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the purified protein. The equilibrium constant for the binding of the fusion protein to thrombin was measured using the viscogenic method introduced for the study of fibrinogen binding and described in detail elsewhere(19Hopfner K.-P. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11567-11571Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the viscogenic method, the Km for the hydrolysis of FpA from fibrinogen is measured as a result of the competition of the hydrolysis of S2238 by thrombin as a function of fibrinogen concentration. Values of Km determined as a function of the relative viscosity of the solution are analyzed using the expression shown in Equation 2, where α is the ratio between the acylation and dissociation rates, β is the ratio between acylation and deacylation, and ηrel is the relative viscosity of the medium. Km=Kd1+αηrel1+βηrel(Eq. 2) The value of the equilibrium dissociation constant Kd is obtained in a plot of Kmversus ηrel as the extrapolation of Km for ηrel→0. The viscogenic method yields information on the equilibrium components of the binding interaction (Kd), as well as on the rate-limiting events during the catalytic conversion of the substrate leading to the release of FpA (α and β). The value of Km for the release of FpA from the fusion protein was derived from the competitive effect on the hydrolysis of S2238. Measurements of Km were then carried out as a function of relative viscosity, with thrombin either in slow or fast form. The results were expressed in units of [FpA] to allow a direct comparison between the fusion protein, containing 4 FpA fragments/molecule, and fibrinogen, containing 2 FpA fragments/molecule. The results of the fusion protein binding to the slow and fast forms of thrombin are shown in Fig. 1 as a plot of Kmversus ηrel. The data obey a straight line in the plot, over the range of relative viscosity values examined, suggesting that β≈ 0 in Equation 2. This implies that deacylation and diffusion of the FpA away from the catalytic pocket of thrombin occur on a time scale much faster than acylation, in either the slow or fast forms. The value of α in either form indicates that the fusion protein behaves as a “sticky” substrate, with the dissociation rate being comparable to acylation. This situation is seen for the cleavage of FpA from fibrinogen by the fast form, but not by the slow form(3Mathur A. Schlapkohl W.A. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7568-7573Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The extrapolation of Km for ηrel→ 0 in Fig. 1 gives the value of Kd for the fusion protein binding to the slow and fast forms. Unlike the case seen for fibrinogen(3Mathur A. Schlapkohl W.A. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7568-7573Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the fusion protein preferentially binds to the slow form with an affinity nearly 3 times higher. The affinity for the fast form is about the same as that seen for fibrinogen. In the slow form, on the other hand, the fusion protein binds to thrombin with an affinity 40 times higher compared to fibrinogen (see Table 1).Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab The release of FpA from the fusion protein upon interaction with the slow and fast forms of thrombin is documented in Fig. 2. The fast form cleaves FpA at a rate 9 times faster. Cleavage obeys first-order kinetics in both the fast and slow forms. This behavior parallels the results seen for the release of FpA from fibrinogen under identical solution conditions(2Dang Q.D. Vindigni A. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5977-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The release of FpA is in this case nearly 7 times faster for the fast form of thrombin. In either thrombin form, fibrinogen is cleaved at a rate that is about 6 times faster compared to the fusion protein. Important details on the kinetic mechanism of recognition of fibrinogen and the fusion protein by the slow and fast forms of thrombin are revealed by the individual rate constants for substrate binding (k1), dissociation (k-1), acylation (k2), and deacylation (k3). The constants can be estimated from the data in Table 1 and Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. The values for fibrinogen can be derived from data published previously(2Dang Q.D. Vindigni A. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5977-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 3Mathur A. Schlapkohl W.A. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7568-7573Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The results are given in Table 2. The origin of preferential binding of fibrinogen to the fast form is mostly due to the faster dissociation rate constant of this substrate from the slow form. In the case of the fusion protein, dissociation is much faster from the fast form leading to tighter binding to the slow form. Hence, the Bβ and γ chains destabilize binding to the slow form by enhancing the dissociation rate constant. In the absence of these chains, dissociation is faster from the fast form. The rate constants for fibrinogen binding to the slow and fast forms are significantly slower than that found for chromogenic substrates (1Wells C.M. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11721-11730Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and hirudin(4Ayala Y. Di Cera E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 733-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), but are nearly 1 order of magnitude faster than those of the fusion protein. Acylation of fibrinogen occurs with comparable rate constants in the slow and fast forms, while acylation of the fusion protein is 20 times faster in the fast form. Hence, a significant conversion of the enzyme from the slow to the fast form may be expected before reaching the transition state for the acylation step in the case of fibrinogen, but not for the fusion protein.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The preferential interaction with either thrombin form is quantified by the coupling free energy, ΔGc. This terms measures the difference in binding affinity between the fast and slow forms and provides a measure of the coupling between the binding process and the allosteric slow → fast transition(4Ayala Y. Di Cera E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 733-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).1 If binding of a ligand involves residues that contribute equally in the slow and fast forms, then ΔGc = 0. If binding involves residues that contribute differently in the slow and fast forms, then ΔGc≠ 0. Hence, the coupling free energy is a very useful parameter to relate structural components to binding energetics of the slow→fast transition. The value of coupling free energy for fibrinogen is −1.7 ± 0.1 kcal/mol(3Mathur A. Schlapkohl W.A. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7568-7573Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Fibrinogen binds to the fast form with higher affinity and with a free energy difference of −1.7 ± 0.1 kcal/mol. The value of coupling free energy for the fusion protein is 0.7 ± 0.1 kcal/mol (see Table 1). Unlike fibrinogen, the fusion protein binds to the slow form with higher affinity and the value of ΔGc is positive. The difference in coupling free energy between fibrinogen and the fusion protein is 2.4 ± 0.1 kcal/mol. This quantity must be accounted for by the structural domains of fibrinogen that interact with thrombin and are not present in the fusion protein. A quantity analogous to ΔGc can be defined in the transition state as a measure of the change in the specificity constant between the slow and fast forms (see Table 1). If binding of a substrate in the transition state involves residues that contribute equally in the slow and fast forms, then ΔGc = 0, otherwise ΔGc≠ 0. Since FpA is cleaved from fibrinogen or the fusion protein with higher specificity if thrombin is in the fast form, the value of ΔGc is negative for both substrates. The similarity of coupling free energies suggests that the structural components responsible for the stabilization of the transition state in the fast form relative to the slow form are common to fibrinogen and the fusion protein. The fusion protein is the first substrate to be found to bind with higher affinity to the slow form of thrombin. All substrates, effectors, and inhibitors studied previously have been reported to bind to the fast form with higher affinity. Such is the case of fibrinogen (3Mathur A. Schlapkohl W.A. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7568-7573Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), hirudin and its C-terminal fragment(4Ayala Y. Di Cera E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 733-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), thrombomodulin(2Dang Q.D. Vindigni A. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5977-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and a variety of synthetic substrates and inhibitors(1Wells C.M. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11721-11730Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 4Ayala Y. Di Cera E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 733-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Although the fusion protein binds preferentially to the slow form at equilibrium, FpA is cleaved by the fast form with higher specificity. This result bears directly on thrombin-fibrinogen interaction. Fibrinogen binds preferentially to the fast form (3Mathur A. Schlapkohl W.A. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7568-7573Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and is cleaved by the fast form with higher specificity(2Dang Q.D. Vindigni A. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5977-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that the structural components responsible for preferential binding to the fast form at equilibrium are also involved in the preferential stabilization of the transition state in this form. The results for the fusion protein, however, demonstrate that different structural domains of fibrinogen may control molecular recognition at equilibrium and at the transition state. In addition, the results reinforce the notion that the N-terminal domains of the Bβ and γ chains of fibrinogen play a key role in molecular recognition of the natural substrate. These chains presumably destabilize binding to the slow form. The binding affinities of the fusion protein and fibrinogen are the same when thrombin is in the fast form, but differ by a factor of 40 when thrombin is in the slow form. If the sequence 1-50 of the Aα chain present in the fusion protein makes contacts with thrombin as the analogous sequence in the fibrinogen molecule, then this sequence must bind to the slow form with higher affinity. Preferential binding to the fast form, as seen in the case of fibrinogen, would result from contacts made by the N-terminal domains of the Bβ and γ chains with thrombin. These contacts would provide 2.4 kcal/mol toward the stabilization of the fast form. Alternatively, the Bβ and γ chains may constrain the Aα chain of fibrinogen such that the contacts with thrombin are not analogous to those in the fusion protein. The lack of structural information on the thrombin-fibrinogen complex makes assignment of residues involved in recognition very difficult. A structure of thrombin covalently bound to the fragment 1-16 of the fibrinogen Aα chain has documented the expected contacts with primary recognition subsites in the catalytic pocket, along with hydrophobic contacts with the aryl binding site of thrombin and Gly-216(8Stubbs M.T. Oschkinat H. Mayr I. Huber R. Angliker H. Stone S.R. Bode W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). A seemingly important salt bridge between Arg-173 of thrombin and Glu-11 of fibrinogen has also been reported in the crystal structure. This assignment, however, may be questionable since the side chain of Arg-173 is disordered. The E11A replacement in the fusion protein is without effect(11Binnie C.G. Lord S.T. Blood. 1993; 81: 3186-3192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lord S.T. Byrd P.A. Hede K.L. Wei C. Colby T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 838-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the E11G mutation in fibrinogen Mitaka II impairs thrombin binding(20Niwa K. Yaginuma A. Nakanishi M. Wada Y. Sugo T. Asakura S. Watanabe N. Matsuda M. Blood. 1993; 82: 3658-3663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutation R173E of thrombin decreases the release of FpA and FpB from fibrinogen by a factor of 3 and 2, respectively,1 which is an effect too small to be assigned to the lack of an important salt bridge interaction. The fibrinogen binding loop provides a significant portion of the binding free energy (19Hopfner K.-P. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11567-11571Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), but contributes very little to the value of ΔGc(4Ayala Y. Di Cera E. J. Mol.

Mutagenesis studies of thrombin have indicated that Lys-60f, located strategically in between the catalytic pocket and the fibrinogen binding loop, may play a significant role in the recognition of fibrinogen since the mutant K60fE has a reduced clotting activity(9Wu Q.

This residue is also important in the binding of hirudin (5Rydel T.J. Tulinsky A. Bode W. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 583-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The portion of the NSDK of fibrinogen interacting with the region of thrombin surrounding Lys-60f may hold the key to unravel the contribution of the Bβ and γ chains to the destabilization of binding to the slow form. The significant differences seen at equilibrium between fibrinogen and the fusion protein disappear in the transition state. Preferential binding to the fast form in the transition state must originate from contacts made with residues within the catalytic moiety and the recognition subsite Asp-189 of thrombin. All the molecular components responsible for the preferential interaction are contained in the Aα1-50, with no apparent contribution from the N-terminal domains of the Bβ and γ chains. The three chains in the NSDK of fibrinogen appear to have different roles in the recognition mechanism. The Aα chain contains the structures required for recognition by the fast form in the transition state, while the Bβ and γ chains contain the structures that destabilize binding to the slow form at equilibrium. In this model the Bβ and γ chains act as intramolecular allosteric effectors of the Aα chain. They destabilize binding to the slow form, inducing the slow → fast transition, which in turn facilitates binding of the Aα chain in the transition state and the release of FpA by the fast form. The observation that the fusion protein binds to the slow form with higher affinity is intriguing and represents a significant step toward our understanding of the molecular basis of the slow → fast transition of thrombin and the structural epitopes important for fibrinogen recognition. An important implication of our results is that synthetic inhibitors tailored after the 1-50 segment of the Aα chain of fibrinogen may work as effective stabilizers of the anticoagulant slow form of thrombin. Such inhibitors would also be effective in enhancing the enzyme specificity toward protein C and may reveal key details involved in the interaction of thrombin with thrombomodulin. S. T. L. is grateful to Oleg Gorkun for valuable technical assistance in the early phase of the determinations of FpA release from the fusion protein and to Dr. Frank Church for providing human α-thrombin."
