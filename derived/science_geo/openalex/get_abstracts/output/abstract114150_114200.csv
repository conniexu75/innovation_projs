https://openalex.org/W2040593177,"Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) is thought to be a second messenger for intracellular calcium mobilization. However, in a cell-free system of islet microsomes, cyclic adenosine diphosphate-ribose (cADP-ribose), a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) metabolite, but not IP3, induced calcium release. In digitonin-permeabilized islets, cADP-ribose and calcium, but not IP3, induced insulin secretion. Islet microsomes released calcium when combined with the extract from intact islets that had been incubated with high concentrations of glucose. Sequential additions of cADP-ribose inhibited the calcium release response to extracts from islets treated with high concentrations of glucose. Conversely, repeated additions of the islet extract inhibited the calcium release response to a subsequent addition of cADP-ribose. These results suggest that cADP-ribose is a mediator of calcium release from islet microsomes and may be generated in islets by glucose stimulation, serving as a second messenger for calcium mobilization in the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W2019922918,"A transfer RNA (tRNA) binding protein present in HeLa cell nuclear extracts was purified and identified as the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Studies with mutant tRNAs indicated that GAPDH recognizes both sequence and structural features in the RNA. GAPDH discriminated between wild-type tRNA and two tRNA mutants that are defective in nuclear export, which suggests that the protein may participate in RNA export. The cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide disrupted complex formation between tRNA and GAPDH and thus may share a common binding site with the RNA. Indirect immunofluorescence experiments showed that GAPDH is present in the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W1530970237,"Rat basophilic RBL-2H3 cells, which exhibit Ca(2+)-dependent secretion of granules when stimulated with antigen, contained the Ca(2+)-dependent alpha and beta and the Ca(2+)-independent delta, epsilon, and zeta isoforms of protein kinase C. These isoforms associated, to variable extents (i.e. delta the most and zeta the least), with the membrane fraction upon antigen stimulation but without external Ca2+; only the Ca(2+)-independent isoforms did so. Both types of isozymes were probably necessary for optimal responses to antigen as indicated by the following observations. All Ca(2+)-dependent isozymes were degraded in cells treated with 20 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 6 h, whereas the Ca(2+)-independent isozymes were not degraded and were retained when the cells were subsequently permeabilized and washed. Cells so treated still exhibited antigen-induced secretion (25-33% of normal) which was suppressed by selective inhibitors of protein kinase C (Ro31-7549 and calphostin C) thereby indicating a possible contribution of the Ca(2+)-independent isozymes in secretion. Normally, washed permeabilized cells lost all isozymes of protein kinase C and failed to secrete in response to antigen. A full secretory response to antigen could be reconstituted by the subsequent addition of nanomolar concentrations of either beta or delta isozymes of protein kinase C (other isozymes were much less effective) but only in the presence of 1 microM free Ca2+ to indicate distinct roles for Ca2+ and protein kinase C in exocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2069050425,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) is essential for the survival of both peripheral ganglion cells and central cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain. The accelerated loss of central cholinergic neurons during Alzheimer's disease may be a determinant of dementia in these patients and may therefore suggest a therapeutic role for NGF. However, NGF does not significantly penetrate the blood-brain barrier, which makes its clinical utility dependent on invasive neurosurgical procedures. When conjugated to an antibody to the transferrin receptor, however, NGF crossed the blood-brain barrier after peripheral injection. This conjugated NGF increased the survival of both cholinergic and noncholinergic neurons of the medial septal nucleus that had been transplanted into the anterior chamber of the rat eye. This approach may prove useful for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders that are amenable to treatment by proteins that do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier."
https://openalex.org/W2001504395,"The coordination and binding of the Mg2+ ion in the nucleotide-binding site of p21 have been investigated using site-directed mutagenesis, kinetic methods, and phosphorous NMR. Mg2+ in the p21.nucleotide.Mg2+ complex appears to be in fast equilibrium with the solvent. The dissociation constant between Mg2+ and the p21.GDP complex was determined to be 2.8 microM. It decreases 30- or 16-fold on substituting Ser-17 or Asp-57 with alanine, respectively, whereas the T35A mutation has no effect. All three mutations influence the dissociation constants and the association and dissociation rate constants of the interaction between guanine nucleotides and p21, but to a different degree. We conclude that Thr-35 is only complexed to Mg2+ in the GTP conformation and both Asp-57 and Ser-17 appear to be critical for both GDP and GTP binding. 31P NMR spectra of the GDP and Gpp(NH)p (guanosine-5'-(beta,gamma-imido)triphosphate) complexes of mutated p21 show a remarkable perturbation of the guanine nucleotide-binding site compared to wild-type protein. The mutant proteins show reduced GTPase rates, which are not stimulated by the GTPase-activating protein GAP. p21(S17A) has been reported to function just as p21(S17N) as a dominant negative inhibitor of normal p21. We find that it inhibits oncogenic p21-induced survival of primary neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1641540149,"A lysate of unstimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) exhibited phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity, which hydrolyzed phospholipids bearing arachidonate more preferentially than those bearing linoleate at the sn-2 position. An anti-rabbit cytosolic PLA2 monoclonal antibody absorbed the activity, whereas an anti-human type II PLA2 monoclonal antibody did not. HUVEC treated with thrombin generated prostaglandin I2 (PGI2), and the PLA2 activity of the thrombin-stimulated cells was absorbed almost completely by the anti-cytosolic PLA2 antibody. HUVEC treated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) also generated PGI2. PGI2 generation by TNF-treated cells was suppressed partially by extracellular addition of the anti-type II PLA2 antibody. PLA2 activity in a lysate of TNF-stimulated cells was increased about 2-3-fold, and about half of the increased activity was suppressed by the anti-type II PLA2 antibody. Addition of heparin together with TNF resulted in release of type II PLA2 in the medium. Thus, both cytosolic and type II PLA2s may be involved in agonist-stimulated PGI2 synthesis in HUVEC. Furthermore, exogenously added type II PLA2 was bound to the cell surface and synergistically enhanced PGI2 generation in TNF-stimulated HUVEC. This binding was blocked by either heparin or a monoclonal antibody recognizing the heparin-binding domain of type II PLA2. Taken together, type II PLA2 generated endogenously as well as added exogenously may be captured on the HUVEC surface via heparan sulfate proteoglycan and may contribute to cellular arachidonate metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1543985083,"We have investigated oxidant-mediated stimulation of phospholipase D (PLD) activity in bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (BPAEC), prelabeled with [32P]orthophosphate or [32P]lysophospholipids. Treatment of cells incubated in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing 0.5% ethanol with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or linoleic acid hydroperoxide (18:2-OOH) enhanced the formation of 32P-labeled phosphatidylethanol (PEt) and phosphatidic acid (PA) in a dose- and time-dependent manner, indicating the activation of PLD. The H2O2- and 18:2-OOH-mediated PLD activation was not associated with cytotoxicity as determined by [3H]deoxyglucose release. The addition of ferrous chloride (50 microM) augmented H2O2-induced formation of [32P]PEt and [32P]PA about 2-fold, whereas the addition of the iron chelator desferoxamine blocked the potentiating effect of ferrous chloride. Replacement of the HBSS medium with Medium 199 containing 20% calf serum also potentiated the effect of H2O2-induced PLD activation. In addition to phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylinositol (PI) were readily hydrolyzed by PLD in response to H2O2 and 18:2-OOH treatment. The substrate specificity for oxidant-stimulated PLD activity differed from that observed in the presence of bradykinin or exhibited by agonist stimulation with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) where PC was the major phospholipid hydrolyzed by PLD. The formation of PEt in the presence of H2O2 and 18:2-OOH was not abolished by chelation of either extracellular Ca2+ with EGTA (5 mM) or intracellular Ca2+ with 1,2-bis-(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N,N-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM) (25 microM, 30 min). Furthermore, pretreatment of BPAEC with the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor staurosporine and down-regulation of PKC by chronic TPA treatment (100 nM, 18 hr) had no effect on H2O2-induced PLD activation, suggesting that PLD activation by H2O2 is independent of PKC activity. It is possible that H2O2- and 18:2-OOH-induced activation of PLD represents an important mechanism to produce PA and diacylglycerol in endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1498848540,"SEC12 encodes an integral membrane glycoprotein essential for vesicle formation from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in yeast. The SAR1 gene was discovered as a multicopy suppressor of a sec12ts strain and encodes a 21-kDa GTP-binding protein also required for protein transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus (Nakano, A., and Muramatsu, M. (1989) J. Cell Biol. 109, 2677-2691). We have purified Sar1p to apparent homogeneity from cells harboring a galactose-regulated recombinant SAR1. Purified Sar1p binds guanine nucleotides specifically and exhibits GTPase activity (0.001 min-1). Nucleotide exchange and hydrolysis rates are greatly increased in the presence of Mg2+ and nonionic detergents or phospholipids. An assay that measures the formation of a vesicle intermediate in ER to Golgi transport was devised that is dependent on the addition of purified Sar1p. This assay employs membranes prepared from wild-type cells and cytosol fractions depleted of Sar1p due to overproduction of Sec12p or by gel filtration chromatography. The gel-filtered cytosol requires the addition of Sar1p and GTP to support vesicle budding. Sar1p prebound with GTP gamma S inhibits Sar1p function in the vesicle formation assay. The results indicate a role for Sar1p in vesicle budding from the ER and suggest that GTP hydrolysis by Sar1p is required for this event."
https://openalex.org/W1540106294,"The role of the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger of heart mitochondria in cellular functioning is not yet clear. The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of stimulation and inhibition of the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger on the matrix free Ca2+ concentration in isolated heart mitochondria and to determine the consequences of these changes on the rate of NADH production via Krebs cycle turnover and the oxidative phosphorylation rate (OPR) supported by alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, a Ca(2+)-regulated matrix enzyme. Activation of Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange by increasing extramitochondrial Na+ concentration was found to decrease the matrix free [Ca2+] in a concentration-dependent manner. Inhibitors of mitochondrial Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange activity inhibited the decrease in matrix free [Ca2+] mediated by Na+. Increasing concentrations of Na+ were also found to inhibit both the rate of NADH production and OPR. Inhibitors of mitochondrial Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange also blocked the effects of Na+ on the rate of NADH production and OPR in a similar concentration range. The results indicate that alterations in matrix free [Ca2+] induced by changes in mitochondrial Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange activity are translated into changes in the rate of NADH production and the overall rate of oxidative phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1513607518,"To study the site by which erabutoxin a (Ea) from Laticauda semifasciata binds to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, we mutated most residues that are shared with other curaremimetic toxins and studied the structural and biological consequences of introduced mutations. By site-directed mutagenesis, we changed Ser-8 into Gly (EaS8G), Lys-27 into Glu (EaK27E), Trp-29 into Phe (EaW29F) and His (EaW29H), Asp-31 into His (EaD31H), Phe-32 into Leu (EaF32L), Arg-33 into Lys (EaR33K) and Glu (EaR33E), Gly-34 into Ser (EaG34S), Glu-38 into Gln (EaE38Q) and Lys (EaE38K), Gly-49 into Val (EaG49V), and Leu-52 into Ala (EaL52A). All mutants were homogeneous as judged by various analytical procedures. EaE38Q, EaG49V, and EaL52A bound the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor with apparent Kd values close to 10(-10) M, virtually identical to wild Ea. Therefore, Glu-38, Gly-49, and Leu-52 are not important elements in the expression of curaremimetic function in Ea. Mutations of Phe-32 and Gly-34 provoked a 7-fold affinity decrease, suggesting that these residues moderately contribute to function. The 176-fold affinity decrease due to mutation of Ser-8 may reflect some structural change that operates in the polypeptide chain of the mutant, as detected by circular dichroism. Decreases in affinity by a factor of 175, 67, 46, and 318 were seen upon mutations of Lys-27 into Glu, Trp-29 into Phe, Asp-31 into His, and Arg-33 into Glu, with no concomitant change in secondary structure. These residues appear to be important elements of the curaremimetic function of Ea. Thus, a picture of the contribution of conserved residues to the function of a curaremimetic toxin is proposed on the basis of experimental evidence."
https://openalex.org/W2071159951,"Endotoxin [lipopolysaccharide (LPS)], the major antigen of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, consists of a variable-size carbohydrate chain that is covalently linked to N,O-acylated beta-1,6-D-glucosamine disaccharide 1,4'-bisphosphate (lipid A). The toxic activity of LPS resides in the lipid A structure. The structural features of synthetic peptides that bind to lipid A with high affinity, detoxify LPS in vitro, and prevent LPS-induced cytokine release and lethality in vivo were defined. The binding thermodynamics were comparable to that of an antigen-antibody reaction. Such synthetic peptides may provide a strategy for prophylaxis and treatment of LPS-mediated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1582748592,"Mutant strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, termed SLC, make no detectable sphingolipids when cultured without a sphingolipid long chain base such as phytosphingosine (Dickson, R.C., Wells, G.B., Schmidt, A., and Lester, R.L. (1990) Mol. Cell. Biol. 10, 2176-2181). When grown with phytosphingosine they make sphingolipids in normal amounts. SLC strains carry a secondary suppressor mutation that bypasses the need to synthesize a long chain base. Hypothetically, the suppressor mutation could function by mutating a gene whose protein product required a sphingolipid for function, by increasing the level of one or more endogenous lipids, or by making new lipid(s). Here we demonstrate that SLC strains make novel inositol glycerophospholipids when cultured without a long chain base. The novel lipids are phosphatidylinositol (PI), mannosyl-PI, and inositol-P-(mannosyl-PI), containing 1 mol of C26 fatty acid, ordinarily found in yeast sphingolipids but not usually found in glycerophospholipids; the C26 fatty acid appears to be located at the SN-2 position of the glycerol. In addition, mono-fattyacyl versions of these three compounds were also identified. The polar head groups and hydrophobic portions of these novel lipids are strikingly similar to S. cerevisiae sphingolipids found in wild-type cells. We speculate that the novel lipids structurally mimic sphingolipids and thereby compensate for some sphingolipid function(s) necessary for growth."
https://openalex.org/W1500688054,"The bovine heart mitochondrial F1-ATPase depleted of nucleotides (nd-MF1) hydrolyzes 50 microM ATP in three kinetic phases at 30 degrees C. An initial burst rapidly transforms into an intermediate, slower rate, which slowly accelerates to the final, steady-state rate. The intermediate phase disappears progressively as the concentration of ATP in the assay medium is increased and is absent at 2 mM. Activation in the intermediate phase is lost when nd-MF1 is inactivated by 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine, which modifies three noncatalytic sites. Correlation of [3H]ATP binding to nd-MF1, after treatment either with 50 microM Mg[3H]ATP plus a regenerating system or 10 mM free [3H]ATP, with stimulation of the intermediate phase suggests that this phase is abolished when at least two noncatalytic sites are filled with ATP. Prior incubation of nd-MF1 with MgPPi stimulates hydrolysis of 30 microM to 2 mM ATP and abolishes the intermediate phase. Following incubation with Mg[32P]PPi, 3.3 mol of [32P]PPi/mol of enzyme are bound, 1 and 0.5 mol of which are released by cold chases with MgATP and MgITP, respectively. Since the cold chases diminish activation only slightly, the stimulatory effect is not caused by PPi binding to catalytic sites. A Lineweaver-Burk plot of initial rates of the intermediate phase for hydrolysis of 30 microM to 2 mM ATP by nd-MF1 is biphasic, extrapolating to apparent Km values of 120 and 440 microM. The latter value is the same as the apparent Kd determined from dependence of the rate of activation of the intermediate phase on ATP concentration in the assay medium. After prior incubation of nd-MF1 with MgPPi or free ATP, Lineweaver-Burk plots are linear with the highest Km disappearing. Thus, this Km reflects rate acceleration when ATP binds to noncatalytic sites. From these results it is concluded that slow binding of ATP to noncatalytic sites during hydrolysis of low concentrations of substrate, which accelerates catalysis, is responsible for apparent negative cooperativity exhibited by MF1."
https://openalex.org/W1528142343,"The pathway of cell penetration of diphtheria toxin (DT) was studied in Vero cells by following the kinetics of uptake, reduction, degradation, and sub-cellular distribution of 125I-DT in the absence or presence of bafilomycin A1 (baf-A1), a powerful inhibitor of the endosomal H(+)-ATPase. After a lag phase of 4 min, DT, bound to Vero cells, reached an acidic intracellular compartment, where about one-third of it underwent a transition to a state competent for subsequent reduction and membrane translocation. After further 4 min, this DT fraction was reduced in a baf-A1-insensitive reaction and DT-A, the intracellularly active protomer of DT, was immediately released in the cytosol. The present data indicate that cell-mediated reduction of the toxin is the rate-determining step of the DT cell intoxication process. Subcellular fractionation showed that DT underwent the low pH-driven conformational change in an early endosome, distinct from the subsequent endosomal compartment where reduction took place. DT-B remained endosome-bound and was proteolyzed at low pH as well as the portion of DT which was not reduced after the exposure to low pH in early endosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1557366744,"Escherichia coli fumarate reductase (FRD) is a four-subunit enzyme that catalyzes the terminal step in anaerobic respiration to fumarate. The hydrophobic FrdC and FrdD subunits anchor the FrdA and FrdB catalytic subunits to the inner surface of the cytoplasmic membrane and are required for the enzyme to interact with quinones. Thirty-five single-site mutations were constructed in the FrdC and FrdD polypeptides by site-directed mutagenesis. Each mutant enzyme was characterized for its ability to catalyze quinone oxidation and reduction and to support growth of E. coli DW35 (delta frdABCD sdhC::kan) under selective conditions requiring functional enzyme. Replacement of FrdCE29 with Asp, Leu, Lys, or Phe had a deleterious effect both on quinol oxidase and quinone reductase activities. Substitution of FrdCH82 with Arg, Leu, Tyr, or Glu also decreased menaquinol oxidase activity, but had variable effects on the reverse reaction, the reduction of ubiquinone. Data are presented to support the hypothesis that the positive charge at FrdCH82 is required for stabilization of the quinone radical intermediate and the negative charge at FrdCE29 for deprotonation of menaquinol. Other critical amino acids identified in FrdC included Ala-32, Phe-38, Trp-86, Phe-87, and in FrdD residues Phe-57, Gln-59, Ser-60, and His-80. The established roles of such residues in the QA and QB sites of the photosynthetic reaction center would suggest a similar type of structure operative in the FRD complex. In such a model, Glu-29, Ala-32, His-82, Trp-86 of FrdC and His-80 of FrdD are considered participants in a QB-type site, and FrdD Phe-57, Gln-59, and Ser-60 components in an apolar QA-type site."
https://openalex.org/W2075672090,"Potassium permanganate (KMnO4) footprinting in the absence and presence of magnesium (Mg2+) at the lambda PR promoter identified two different open complexes with Escherichia coli E sigma 70 RNA polymerase (designated RPo1 and RPo2). The single-stranded region in RPo1 (formed in the absence of Mg2+) was at most 12 bases long, whereas that in RPo2 (formed in the presence of Mg2+) spanned at least 14 bases. Only in RPo2 did the single-stranded region extend to the start point of transcription (+1, +2). These results provide a structural basis for the requirement for uptake of Mg2+ in the formation of RPo2 from RPo1, as deduced from kinetic studies at this promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1590103084,"The atypical two-electron oxidation of thioanisole and its p-methyl, p-methoxy, and p-nitro analogues by horseradish peroxidase, contrary to earlier reports, stereoselectively produces the (S) sulfoxides in 60-70% enantiomeric excess. Horseradish peroxidase reconstituted with delta-meso-ethylheme has little peroxidase (guaiacol oxidizing) activity, as previously reported, but exhibits increased sulfoxidation activity. Difference spectroscopy shows that guaiacol binds to delta-meso-ethylheme-reconstituted horseradish peroxidase even though it is essentially not oxidized. In contrast, horseradish peroxidase reconstituted with delta-meso-methylheme is active in both reactions. Studies with H(2)18O2 show that the oxygen in the sulfoxide produced by delta-meso-ethylheme-reconstituted horseradish peroxidase derives, as it does in the reaction catalyzed by the native enzyme, primarily from the peroxide. Preincubation of horseradish peroxidase with phenylhydrazine, which modifies the protein, suppresses peroxidase activity but does not inhibit thioanisole sulfoxidation. On the other hand, the oxidation of iodide is blocked by reconstitution of horseradish peroxidase with delta-meso-ethylheme or preincubation with phenylhydrazine. Noncompetitive kinetics are observed for the inhibition of guaiacol and iodide oxidation by thioanisole and of guaiacol oxidation by iodide. The kinetic data and the differential inhibitory effects of delta-meso-ethylheme reconstitution and phenylhydrazine preincubation indicate that thioanisole and iodide, both of which undergo net two-electron oxidations, are oxidized at sites distinct from each other and from that involved in the oxidation of guaiacol. Spectroscopic substrate binding studies provide support for distinct thioanisole, guaiacol, and iodide-binding sites. An active site model is proposed to rationalize the results."
https://openalex.org/W1543594831,"Abstract Apolipophorin III (apoLp-III) is a major protein in hemolymph of adult Manduca sexta. Although it normally exists in a lipid-free state, during sustained flight, apoLp-III functions as an apolipoprotein, reversibly associating with the surface of lipoprotein particles. In an effort to gain a fuller understanding of this dual existence, we have investigated its solution properties using spectroscopic methods. The UV absorption spectrum of apoLp-III is distinctive owing to the absence of tryptophan and the presence of a single tyrosine residue. Circular dichroism experiments revealed an enhancement of apoLp-III alpha-helical content when spectra were obtained in 50% trifluoroethanol versus aqueous buffer. The helical content in buffer was unaffected by protein concentration, suggesting that apoLp-III exists in solution as a monomeric species. At pH values > 10 and < 4, there was a marked loss of helical content. Increasing the temperature of apoLp-III solutions also caused a loss of secondary structure, with a temperature-induced denaturation midpoint of 52 degrees C. Upon recooling of heat-denatured apoLp-III, approximately 95% of the secondary structure was restored. In guanidine HCl denaturation studies monitored by CD, a 50% transition midpoint of 0.355 M was determined, corresponding to a delta GDH2O of 1.29 kcal/mol. Fluorescence studies indicated that guanidine HCl induced an enhancement of tyrosine fluorescence emission at 300 nm when excited at 277 nm. In native apoLp-III, we propose that tyrosine fluorescence is quenched to a large extent due to a hydrophobic stacking interaction of its side chain with that of a neighboring phenylalanine residue. delta GDH2O was determined from the fluorescence data to be 2.1 kcal/mol, with a transition midpoint occurring at 0.25 M guanidine HCl. The lower concentration of guanidine HCl required to induce half-maximal tyrosine fluorescence enhancement versus the transition midpoint detected by CD may be a reflection of the fact that this residue is located near the COOH-terminal end of the protein and as such may be more susceptible to denaturation. The results presented indicate that apoLp-III assumes a relatively labile conformation in solution that appears to be partially stabilized by side chain charge-charge interactions within predicted alpha-helical segments."
https://openalex.org/W1537141010,"vma12 mutants of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which were originally identified as calcium-sensitive (cls) mutants that were also respiratory deficient (Pet-), have a defect in vacuolar membrane H(+)-ATPase activity (Ohya, Y., Umemoto, N., Tanida, I., Ohta, A., Iida, H., and Anraku, Y. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 13971-13977). The VMA12 gene was cloned by complementation of the growth defects of vma12 mutants. The nucleotide sequence of the gene predicts a polypeptide of 215 amino acids (25.2 kDa) with two putative membrane-spanning domains. A null vma12 mutant, constructed by chromosomal deletion of the gene, is viable but has completely lost the vacuolar membrane H(+)-ATPase activity and exhibits the same growth defects as observed for the original vma12 mutants. Synthesis and targeting of the subunits of the H(+)-ATPase in the delta vma12 mutant cells were examined by Western blotting analyses of whole cell and vacuolar membrane protein extracts. None of the peripheral membrane subunits that we analyzed (the 69-, 60-, 42-, and 27-kDa subunits) was detected in the vacuolar membrane fractions, although the cellular levels of these polypeptides appeared to be normal. The 100- and 17-kDa integral membrane subunits of the enzyme were absent or present at a substantially reduced level in mutant vacuolar membrane fractions. Anti-Vma12p antibodies recognized a vacuolar protein with the expected molecular mass of 25 kDa. However, the Vma12 protein was not detected in the vacuolar membrane ATPase complex that had been solubilized with a zwitterionic detergent, ZW3-14, and purified by glycerol gradient centrifugation (Kane, P. M., Yamashiro, C. T., and Stevens, T. H. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 19236-19244). These results indicate that the VMA12 gene product is not a component of the active vacuolar ATPase complex and instead suggest that this protein is required during the process of assembly and/or targeting of the enzyme complex to the vacuolar membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1593015025,"Abstract The gamma subunit mutations, gamma Met-23-->Lys or Arg, in the Escherichia coli ATP synthase were previously reported to cause dramatically inefficient energy coupling between ATPase catalysis and H+ translocation (Shin, K., Nakamoto, R.K., Maeda, M., and Futai, M. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 20835-20839). In this paper, we report that second-site mutations in the gamma subunit can suppress the effects of gamma Met-23-->Lys. By screening randomly mutagenized uncG (gamma Met-23-->Lys), eight mutations in the carboxyl-terminal region were identified; strains carrying gamma Arg-242-->Cys, gamma Gln-269-->Arg, gamma Ala-270-->Val, gamma Ile-272-->Thr, gamma Thr-273-->Ser, gamma Glu-278-->Gly, gamma Ile-279-->Thr, or gamma Val-280-->Ala in combination with gamma Met-23-->Lys were able to grow by oxidative phosphorylation. H+ pumping assayed in membranes prepared from double mutation strains demonstrated that efficient ATP-dependent H+ transport was restored. Interestingly, the single mutations, gamma Gln-269-->Arg or gamma Thr-273-->Ser, caused reduced growth by oxidative phosphorylation; however, when these mutations were in combination with gamma Met-23-->Lys, growth was substantially increased. Furthermore, strains carrying gamma Met-23-->Lys, gamma Gln-269-->Arg, or gamma Thr-273-->Ser as single mutations were temperature sensitive, whereas, strains with the double mutations, gamma Met-23-->Lys/gamma Gln-269-->Arg or gamma Met-23-->Lys/gamma Thr-273-->Ser, were thermally stable. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that gamma Met-23, gamma Arg-242, and the region between gamma Gln-269 to gamma Val-280 are close to each other and interact to mediate efficient energy coupling."
https://openalex.org/W1597368736,"Reductive methylation of the alpha NH2 moiety of the DNA repair enzyme T4 endonuclease V has been shown previously to eradicate both the N-glycosylase and apyrimidinic/apurinic lyase activities of the enzyme (Schrock, R. D., III, and Lloyd, R. S. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 17631-17639). The present study uses the technique of site-directed mutagenesis to investigate the important parameters involved in the cleavage mechanism. The prediction was that the addition of an amino acid in the immediate NH2-terminal region of the protein would alter the proximity of the alpha NH2 moiety of Thr2 to its target, thereby severely compromising the enzyme's catalytic activity. However, substitutions in this region generally should be tolerated. To test this hypothesis, three substitutions of the NH2-terminal amino acid were produced: Ser2 (T2S), Val2 (T2V), and Pro2 (T2P). An addition mutant was also produced by adding a glycine between the first and second amino acids of the protein (Thr2-Gly-Arg3) (+Gly). The T2P and +Gly mutants had negligible pyrimidine dimer-specific N-glycosylase activity as well as negligible pyrimidine dimer-specific nicking activity in vitro. Conversely, the T2S enzyme exhibited wild type levels of activity and the T2V exhibited intermediate levels of activity in vitro. Results from ultraviolet (UV) survival studies of the mutant enzymes indicated that the in vivo activities of these enzymes were directly correlated to the enzymes' ability to cleave at pyrimidine dimers in vitro. These results indicate that a critical parameter for the functionality of endonuclease V is the relative distance between the primary alpha NH2 group in the active site of the enzyme and those elements responsible for DNA binding and pyrimidine dimer recognition."

We prepared reconstituted high density lipoprotein (rHDL) particles with each of the three apolipoproteins in two weight ratios with lipid: 2.7/0.07/1 and 1.35/0.04/1, palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine/cholesterol/apolipoprotein, by the sodium cholate dialysis procedure; and examined the rHDL product sizes and distributions by nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. The rHDL particles were also incubated with low density lipoprotein (LDL), and with LDL plus LCAT, to observe any structural modifications due to phospholipid transfers to LDL and to cholesterol esterification by LCAT. In addition, we examined the average structural properties of the original rHDL by several fluorescence methods and circular dichroism spectroscopy, and determined their reaction kinetics with LCAT. The results indicate that the diameters of the largest rHDL particles, containing two apolipoproteins per particle, correlate with the maximum number of putative amphipathic alpha-helical segments in their sequences, and that smaller particles of this class may arise from the removal of one or more alpha-helical segments from contact with lipid. Furthermore, the larger particles may be converted into the smaller ones upon loss of phospholipid to LDL, and may form one or two well defined products when reacted with LCAT. In general, the subclasses of particles have distinct spectroscopic properties, consistent with a different apolipoprotein folding in particles containing different proportions of phospholipid to apolipoprotein. Furthermore, the different apolipoprotein structures lead to significant differences in reactivity with LCAT."
https://openalex.org/W1487633782,"13(S)-Hydroperoxyoctadeca-9(Z),11(E),15(Z)-trienoic acid (13-HPOT) was used to probe the mechanism of the hydroperoxide O-O bond cleavage catalyzed by solubilized and partially purified soybean peroxygenase. When reacted with this ferrihemoprotein, it was converted to 13(S)-hydroxyoctadeca-9(Z),11(E), 15(Z)-trienoic acid (13-HOT) and a single epoxide regio-isomer, i.e. 15,16-cis-epoxy-13(S)-hydroxyoctadeca-9(Z),11(E)-dienoic acid (15,16-EHOD). In the absence of co-oxidizable substrates, such as oleic acid or thiobenzamide, this latter compound accounted for about two-thirds of the reaction products. 13-HOT and 15,16-EHOD are products of heterolytic scission of the O-O bond of 13-HPOT; no products arising by homolytic scission could be detected. Therefore, soybean peroxygenase catalyzes hydroperoxide reduction exclusively by a heterolytic mechanism leading to a ferryl-oxo complex analogous to peroxidase compound I. In similar experiments, 13(S)-hydroperoxyoctadeca-9(Z),11(E)-dienoic acid gave 13(S)-hydroxyoctadeca-9(Z),11(E)-dienoic acid and 9,10 epoxy-13(S)-hydroxyoctadec-11(E)-enoic acid. Experiments with 18O-labeled 13-HPOT indicated that about 83% of the oxygen atom incorporated into the epoxide group of 15,16-EHOD, originated from the hydroperoxide group. Moreover, using mixtures of unlabeled and 18O-labeled 13-HPOT, it was established that this transfer takes place predominantly (about 3:1) by an intramolecular process. In the intermolecular reaction 13-HOT, formed after reduction of the hydroperoxide, diffuses from the active site and, after reassociation, is epoxidized at the 15,16-double bond. A unifying mechanistic scheme, which takes into account all of the reactions catalyzed by the peroxygenase, is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1625899271,"We have analyzed gene-specific and strand-specific DNA damage and repair in the dihydrofolate reductase gene in hamster cells. Cells were UV-irradiated or treated with two types of chemotherapeutics, alkylating agents or cisplatin. UV-induced pyrimidine dimers were detected using a previously published technique in which the T4 endonuclease V enzyme is used to create nicks at the lesion sites. 6-4 photoproducts were detected in a similar assay using ABC excinuclease after prior reversal of the pyrimidine dimers with photolyase. Adducts formed by the alkylating agents nitrogen mustard and dimethyl sulfate were quantitated by generating strand breaks at basic sites after neutral depurination. Cisplatin-induced intrastrand adducts were detected with ABC excinuclease, and cisplatin interstrand cross-links were detected using a denaturation-reannealing reaction before electrophoresis. In accord with previous reports by other investigators, we find distinct strand specificity of the repair of pyrimidine dimers after UV; the transcribed strand was much more efficiently repaired than the nontranscribed strand. In contrast, there was little or no strand bias in the repair of the 6-4 photoproducts. For alkylating agents, a slight bias toward repair in the transcribed strand was found after treatment with nitrogen mustard, but there appeared to be no bias in the repair after treatment with dimethyl sulfate. Cisplatin interstrand cross-links are repaired with equal efficiency from the two strands, but the more common cisplatin-induced lesion, the intrastrand adduct, is preferentially repaired from the transcribed strand. In conclusion, there is strand bias in the repair of pyrimidine dimers and cisplatin intrastrand adducts, but the strand specificity of repair may not be a general feature for all DNA lesions, as we found little or no strand bias in the repair of other lesions studied."
https://openalex.org/W1507880759,"Streptococcus sanguis expresses a cell wall-bound protein that induces the activation and aggregation of platelets. This platelet aggregation-associated protein (PAAP) contains a collagen-like, platelet-interactive domain within a 23-kDa protein fragment. To isolate the minimal platelet-interactive domain, p23 PAAP was digested with collagenase, and the digest chromatographed to isolate fractions with activity inhibitory to S. sanguis-induced platelet aggregation. The active fraction was then digested with cyanogen bromide, the product chromatographed, and a smaller inhibitory peptide isolated. Finally, this fraction was digested with endoproteinase Lys-C, and the digest fractionated. After each step, inhibitory activity resolved into single chromatographic peaks of 13 kDa (p13 PAAP), 2.7 kDa (p2.7 PAAP), and a minimal 7-mer peptide, respectively. These PAAP fragments showed similar ID50 (19-28 nM), suggesting that each contained a single copy of the platelet-interactive domain. The minimal 7-mer peptide was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography and reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The primary structure was determined to be Pro-Gly-Glu-Gln-Gly-Pro-Lys. This sequence conforms to the predicted structural motif of the platelet-interactive domains of types I and III collagen. This 7-mer peptide is therefore the platelet-interactive domain of the PAAP from S. sanguis. Its structure explains the molecular basis for immunological cross-reactivity and functional similarity to the platelet-interactive domains of collagens."
https://openalex.org/W1551571847,"The present study describes the presence of two different geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) synthase activities, one cytosolic and one membrane-associated, in a number of rat tissues. Both enzymes utilize farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) and isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) as substrates, but they give rise to different products. The membrane-associated activity produces trans,trans,cis-(E,E,Z)-GGPP, involved in the biosynthesis of long-chain polyprenols. The cytosolic activity produces only the all-trans-(E,E,E) isomer of GGPP, which is utilized as substrate in cytosolic protein prenylation reactions. All-trans-GGPP synthase activity was recovered in the cytosolic fraction from all tissues investigated, but the specific activities varied. The highest specific activities were found in brain, spleen, and testis, followed by kidney and liver. The enzyme activity in rat brain cytosol was further characterized and found to exhibit a narrow pH optimum around 5.0-6.0 and to be highly stimulated by Zn2+. Maximal stimulation was attained with 1 mM Zn2+, whereas Mg2+ had no effect on the enzyme activity. The all-trans-GGPP synthase activity exhibited high affinities for its substrates, i.e. the apparent Km values for FPP and IPP were found to be 0.6 and 3.5 microM, respectively. When rats were fed mevinolin (lovastatin), FPP and all-trans-GGPP synthase activities were affected differently in certain tissues. Mevinolin treatment resulted in an increase in FPP but a decrease in all-trans-GGPP synthase activity in rat liver and kidney. In spleen mevinolin treatment caused a greater than 70% decrease in all-trans-GGPP synthase activity, while FPP synthase was almost unaffected. The presence of two different GGPP synthase activities in the cell, together with the fact that FPP and all-trans-GGPP synthesis in the cytosol are regulated independently, may be of significance in the regulation of isoprenoid biosynthesis, as well as of protein isoprenylation."
https://openalex.org/W2141414108,"beta-D-Xylosides are often used to competitively inhibit proteoglycan synthesis by serving as primers for free glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain assembly. Quite unexpectedly, we found that when human melanoma cells and Chinese hamster ovary cells are labeled with [3H] galactose in the presence of 4-methyl umbelliferyl beta-D-xyloside (Xyl beta 4MU), a large portion of the labeled acceptor does not consist of the expected GAG chains, but of the novel GM3 ganglioside-like structure: Sia-alpha 2,3-[3H]Gal beta 1, 4Xyl beta 4MU. Moreover, formation of this derivative is associated with an inhibition of glycosphingolipid synthesis by up to 78% without affecting synthesis of other [3H]Gal-labeled glycoconjugates. Inhibition occurs rapidly and equally for all glycolipid species and is partially abrogated by brefeldin A. Inhibition requires the addition of a single galactose residue to the xyloside within the lumen of the Golgi apparatus. This addition appears to be carried out by galactosyl transferase I that normally synthesizes the core region of GAG chains. Although alpha-xyloside does not inhibit proteoglycan synthesis, it is galactosylated, but not sialylated, and is nearly as effective as a beta-xyloside at inhibiting glycolipid biosynthesis. Similar results were obtained for human macrophage U937, and differentiated or undifferentiated PC12 cells. However, in neuroblastoma cell line MR23, no low molecular weight xyloside products were made and glycolipid synthesis was not inhibited. These results suggest that some of the previously documented effects of beta-xylosides might result, in part, from their inhibition of glycolipid synthesis. The mechanism of inhibition is not a direct competition for glycolipid synthesizing enzymes; rather, it is an unexplained result of formation of Gal beta 1,4Xyl-1 (alpha or beta)4MU."
https://openalex.org/W1537270003,"Light-dependent absorption change at 325 nm, ascribed to QA activity, was strongly reduced in the presence of Cu(II) in oxygen-evolving core complex. This change was much less affected in the presence of the herbicide 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU), indicating that the Cu(II)-binding site is different from that of the DCMU and that Cu(II) blocks QA reduction. Cu(II) did not eliminate the absorption change at 545 nm, ascribed to pheophytin reduction, in Na2S2O4-treated oxygen-evolving core and D1-D2-cytochrome b559 complexes. This indicates that Cu(II) does not affect the electron transport between P680 and pheophytin. Moreover, the activity of the bacterial reaction center probed by the absorption change at 790 nm was inhibited by Cu(II), but the signal at 530 nm, associated to the reduction of bacteriopheophytin in Na2S2O4-treated reaction center, was not inhibited. We conclude that Cu(II) impaired the photosynthetic electron transport between pheophytin and QA in both higher plants and photosynthetic bacteria. Cu(II) would bind to an amino acid(s) highly conserved in non-oxygenic and oxygenic reaction centers, which is(are) necessary for the electron transfer between pheophytin and QA. Based on the atomic structure of the bacterial reaction center several schemes of possible Cu(II) binding are shown."
https://openalex.org/W1546006275,"The rat lutropin/choriogonadotropin receptor (rLHR) is a G protein-coupled receptor, the large extracellular domain of which binds human choriogonadotropin (hCG) with high affinity. Within the extracellular domain are six potential sites for N-linked glycosylation. Although several studies have attempted to determine if N-linked carbohydrates are necessary for hormone binding, the results have been in apparent disagreement. In this study we have used site-directed mutagenesis to singly and collectively alter the consensus sequences for N-linked glycosylation in the rLHR. In particular, we examined the binding activity in both intact cells as well as detergent-solubilized extracts so that the effects on trafficking to the plasma membrane could be determined. In addition, we independently examined the effects of substituting a particular Asn versus Thr or Ser residue within a given glycosylation consensus sequence. Our data suggest that substitution of Asn-173 with Gln results in both a decreased ability of the receptor to be expressed on the plasma membrane as well as a vastly decreased binding affinity of the receptor for hCG. However, if the consensus sequence for N-linked glycosylation at Asn-173 is altered by substitution of Thr-175 with Ala (instead of Asn-173 to Gln), the resulting receptor binds hCG with high affinity although it is still impaired in its ability to be expressed at the plasma membrane. Furthermore, if all consensus sequences for N-linked glycosylation are mutated collectively while maintaining Asn-173 (by substituting Thr-175 with Ala instead of Asn-173 to Gln), the resulting deglycosylated receptor, although not expressed on the plasma membrane, binds hCG with high affinity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1506751849,"The functional importance of a conserved hydrophobic face in human carbonic anhydrase II (CAII), including amino acid residues 190-210, was investigated by random mutagenesis. The catalytic activity, inhibitor binding, and level of CAII expression in Escherichia coli of 57 single amino acid variants were measured revealing that the function of amino acids correlates with their secondary structure placement. Side chains of amino acids in beta-sheet structure are required for the formation of folded, stable protein while those in the turn region determine catalytic efficiency and inhibitor specificity. The CAII active site is extremely plastic, accommodating amino acid substitutions of varied size, charge, and hydrophobicity with little effect on catalysis; only substitutions at Leu198 and Thr199 decrease the rates of CO2 hydration and ester hydrolysis more than 5-fold. These results pinpoint the hydrogen bond network, including the zinc-solvent molecule and Thr199, as crucial for high catalytic efficiency and also suggest that Leu198 forms a portion of a CO2 association site. Increased activity is observed for substitutions at Thr200 (esterase) and Leu203 (hydrase). In addition, the pKa of the zinc-bound water molecule varies upon substitution of amino acids which alter the overall charge of the active site. Three residues interact with sulfonamide inhibitors; substitutions at Thr199 decrease binding (up to 10(3)-fold) while mutations at Thr200 and Cys206 increase binding of dansylamide (up to 80-fold). Mutations in the beta-sheet structure (Asp190-Ser197 and Val207-Ile-210) decrease the protein expression of CAII in E. coli, causing the formation of insoluble protein aggregates in many cases. This may suggest an important role for these residues in the folding process. In addition, mutations in Trp192, cis-Pro202, and Trp209 increase thermal lability (up to 5000-fold)."
https://openalex.org/W1547403366,"The membrane-bound chitin synthase, a key enzyme of chitin biosynthesis, was purified, for the first time to homogeneity as a zymogen form. Digitonin could solubilize the enzyme from microsomal fraction of the filamentous fungus Absidia glauca, with 60-70% of the enzyme activity. The solubilized form of the enzyme was effectively purified by a sequence of chelating Sepharose, concanavalin A-Sepharose, and Mono Q column. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the purified enzyme gave a single band with a molecular weight of 30,000. IgG prepared against this 30-kDa species on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis immunoprecipitated chitin synthase. The purified enzyme existed as a zymogen, was converted into active form by treatment with trypsin, and the limited digestion with trypsin produced a little smaller polypeptide (28.5 kDa) of which the amino-terminal sequence was identical to the zymogen. The purified enzyme was the glycoprotein and showed a requirement for Mg2+. N-Acetylglucosamine stimulated the enzyme activity approximately 5-fold and polyoxin D, an analogue of substrate, and UDP, a byproduct of enzyme reaction, strongly inhibited the enzyme activity."
https://openalex.org/W1499727792,"The mechanism of retention of cytochrome P450 in the endoplasmic reticulum is unknown, and the membrane topology of the N-terminal region remains controversial. To address these problems, a sequence of 29 amino acids encoding an internal N-glycosylation site of rabbit cytochrome P450 2C2 was attached to the N terminus of cytochrome P450 2C1. This protein is glycosylated at a single site in a cell-free translation system containing microsomal membranes, as indicated by gel mobility and sensitivity to endoglycosidase H. When expressed in COS1 cells, an immunoreactive species with the same gel mobility as the in vitro synthesized glycosylated product was detected. Treatment with endoglycosidase H changed its mobility to that of unglycosylated hybrid cytochrome P450 2C1. These results indicate that in intact cells, as in the cell-free system, the N terminus of cytochrome P450 is luminally oriented which is not consistent with a hairpin loop conformation. Sensitivity of the glycosylated protein to endoglycosidase H suggests that the protein does not reach the Golgi compartments. When transfected cells were incubated at low temperatures to inhibit retrograde transport from the intermediate pre-Golgi compartment into the endoplasmic reticulum, localization of cytochrome P450 was not changed, as assayed by subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescent staining. These observations suggest that cytochrome P450 is restricted to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane by a mechanism different from recycling through the intermediate compartment, which is a pathway utilized by soluble endoplasmic reticulum proteins."

The putative product of the psbJ gene is a 4-kDa protein with one membrane-spanning domain. We have raised rabbit antibodies against a T7 gene 10-psbJ fusion protein, overexpressed in Escherichia coli. These antibodies recognized a polypeptide of expected size in the thylakoid membrane from wild type Synechocystis cells. We have also created a targeted mutant of Synechocystis 6803 in which the fourth codon of the psbJ open reading frame was modified to a translational stop codon. Thylakoid membranes from these mutant cells lacked the protein recognized by the antibodies. In the mutant cells, the partial electron transfer reaction mediated by the photosystem I complex was unaffected, whereas the rate of the photosystem II (PSII)-mediated reaction was 46% of that in wild type cells. Herbicide binding assays indicated that the PSII to chlorophyll ratio in the mutant cells was 49% of that in wild type cells. These results indicate that while the PsbJ protein is not essential for the photochemical activity it controls the amount of functionally assembled PSII complex in the thylakoid membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1564719710,"Variant forms of Escherichia coli ribosomal protein L7/L12 were constructed, overexpressed, and purified. These included proteins that deleted residues 35-52 (delta 35-52) and 42 to 52 (delta 42-52), others that contained single cysteine substitutions at residues 63 and 89, and combinations of the deletions and cysteine substitutions. Chemical modification of the introduced cysteine residues with [14C]iodoacetamide was used to radiolabel the protein variants in order to quantify their binding to the ribosome. Neither of the deletions in the hinge domain, delta 35-52 and delta 42-52, had any effect on L7/L12 dimer formation as detected by cross-linking by dimethyl suberimidate. Perpendicular urea gradient gel electrophoresis showed that both deletion variants retained a compact structural element attributable to the globular C-terminal domain. Reconstitution of core particles depleted of wild type L7/L12 with the deletion proteins showed that delta 42-52 bound normally in 4 copies per particle, whereas delta 35-52 bound in only 2.5 copies following isolation of the particles by high speed centrifugation or gel filtration. Ribosomes mixed with an excess of the deletion variants and assayed directly for polyphenylalanine synthesis were completely inactive. The results suggest that the flexibility conferred by the hinge is required for activity, perhaps by allowing the C-terminal domain to occupy a location near the base of the L7/L12 stalk."
https://openalex.org/W1480568644,"Human liver alcohol dehydrogenase isoenzymes beta 1 beta 1 and beta 2 beta 2, in which position 47 in the coenzyme binding domain is an arginine or histidine, respectively, differ remarkably in steady-state kinetics. To understand which catalytic steps affect these kinetics, apparent coenzyme dissociation and association rate constants, and apparent 4-trans-(N,N-dimethylamino)cinnamaldehyde (DACA) hydride transfer rate constants were obtained with stopped-flow kinetics. Enzymes containing site-specific mutations of Arg-47 in beta 1 beta 1 (beta 47R) to His (beta 2 beta 2 or beta 47H), Lys (beta 47K), or Gln (beta 47Q) were studied. Apparent coenzyme dissociation rate constants are greatly affected by substitutions at position 47, in which mutant enzymes with a weak base or a neutral residue at this position (beta 47H and beta 47Q) exhibit faster rate constants than beta 47R and beta 47K. Substitutions at position 47 have less effect on apparent coenzyme association rate constants. The kinetics of NADH association for beta 47H and beta 47Q are consistent with a two-step mechanism in which the bimolecular binding step is coupled to a unimolecular process. These findings indicate that the greater role of position 47 in coenzyme dissociation may occur after a coenzyme-induced isomerization. Substitutions at position 47 also strongly influence apparent DACA hydride transfer rate constants; hydride transfer is faster with mutant enzymes containing weak bases like histidine at this position. Steady-state kinetics, however, reveal that the rate-limiting step of both beta 47R and beta 47H for acetaldehyde reduction and for ethanol oxidation is coenzyme product dissociation. Thus, the different activities of beta 1 beta 1 and beta 2 beta 2 for ethanol oxidation and acetaldehyde reduction are caused primarily by different coenzyme dissociation rates."
https://openalex.org/W1550491231,"High density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ester (CE) is taken up by many cells without simultaneous uptake of HDL apoprotein. The studies described herein demonstrate that the selective uptake of cholesterol ester by HepG2 cells is reduced by antibody directed against the receptor-binding domain of apoE (monoclonal antibody (mAb) 1D7) but not by antibody directed against the NH2-terminal portion of the molecule. The reduction, by 1D7, of HDL cholesteryl ester uptake is not due to apoE acquisition by the labeled HDL preparation or by the transfer of [3H]CE of HDL to apoE-containing lipoproteins and uptake by the apoB/E or apoE receptors. Rather, it appears that mAb 1D7 recognizes apoE localized at the cell surface of HepG2 cells. This conclusion is supported by the fact that: 1) reduction of HDL-CE uptake by HepG2 cells is observed within 15 min after the addition of the antibody-ligand mixture; 2) 1D7 is similarly effective in reducing the selective uptake of HDL-CE when added to the ligand or to the cells; 3) three different anti-apoE mAbs (1D7, 3B7, and 3H1) bind specifically to the surface of the cells. We have also demonstrated that heparin (5 mg/ml) does not reduce the amount of apoE-immunoreactive material bound at the cell surface when added before or after the binding period. 1D7, but not 3B7 or 3H1, binds less in the presence of heparin. The observations are consistent with a localization of apoE on the cell membrane rather than on lipoproteins bound to apoB/E or apoE receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1575215395,"Abstract Although the renal juxtaglomerular cell is the source of circulating renin, the renin gene is also expressed at a number of extrarenal sites including lactotrope cells of human and ovine pituitaries. In the present study, we demonstrate that GC cells, a pituitary lactotrope precursor cell line, efficiently express transiently transfected hybrid genes containing human renin 5'-flanking DNA sequences -148/+11. Gel mobility shift competition analyses show that a highly conserved sequence in human and rodent renin 5'-flanking DNAs (human coordinates: -80/-58) binds a nuclear factor from GC cells, most likely the pituitary-specific factor Pit-1. Deletional and mutational analyses demonstrate that this site is a major determinant of renin promoter activity in GC cells. Transfection of a Pit-1 expression construct into HeLa cells, where activity of the human renin promoter is low, stimulates expression of cotransfected renin-luciferase constructs. Moreover, activation of the human renin promoter by co-expression of Pit-1 is dependent on an intact Pit-1 site. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that Pit-1 activates pituitary renin gene expression. This finding raises the possibility that member(s) of the POU family of transcription factors, of which Pit-1 is an archetypal member, may direct renin expression in other tissues, including the kidney."
https://openalex.org/W1604209126,"Human corticosteroid binding-globulin (CBG) is a plasma glycoprotein that binds and regulates the biological activity of glucocorticoids and progesterone. Carbohydrates comprise approximately 25% of its molecular mass being represented by bi- and triantennary N-linked oligosaccharides of the N-acetyllactosamine type. To assess the impact of these carbohydrate chains on CBG production and steroid binding, we mutated a human CBG cDNA so that the six consensus sites for N-glycosylation in the CBG polypeptide were eliminated individually and in various combinations. Expression of the mutant cDNAs in Chinese hamster ovary cells showed that all consensus sites may be utilized during the CBG biosynthesis and that the immunochemical properties of the recombinant glycoproteins are similar to those of CBG isolated from human serum. Removal of sugar chains generally led to a reduction in the secretion of recombinant CBG, but complete removal of N-glycosylation sites did not prevent production or secretion of the protein. Our data indicate that an oligosaccharide linked to Asn238 is essential for steroid binding, and we suggest that an interaction between this sugar chain and the polypeptide may be essential for the creation of a high affinity steroid-binding site. In addition, concanavalin A chromatography of mutants containing only one N-glycosylation site at either Asn74 or Asn238 indicated that processing of the oligosaccharides at these positions is site-specific."
https://openalex.org/W1598468222,"The wild type murine luteinizing hormone (mLH) receptor, which in its mature form is predicted to be a protein of 674 amino acids (mLHR), and an artificially mutated form lacking the last 46 amino acids (mLHR-ct628) were stably expressed in murine L cells. Both forms stimulated adenylyl cyclase and underwent rapid desensitization. The mutation removed 1 tyrosine, 2 threonines, and 6 serines from the receptor. The results indicate that none of these potential phosphorylation sites participates in either adenylyl cyclase stimulation or receptor desensitization. Our results with the mLHR-ct628 (carboxyl-terminal amino acid sequence CCKHRAEL) differ from those reported recently for the essentially identically mutated rat LHR that lacks the last 43 amino acids (rLHR-ct631 with carboxyl-terminal amino acid composition CCKRRAELYRR). This 43-amino acid truncation was described to have the effect of preventing hormone-induced desensitization. While the reasons for the discrepant results are not known, our results do not support the proposal for a participatory role of the extreme carboxyl terminus of the receptor in its desensitization."
https://openalex.org/W1598259199,"SecB is a 16-kDa cytosolic chaperone protein that is required for efficient export of particular proteins in Escherichia coli. To identify regions of SecB that contribute to efficient protein export, we isolated secB point mutants that are defective for protein export in vivo. We obtained missense mutations at residues Leu75 (SecBL75Q), Cys76 (SecBC76Y), and Glu77 (SecBE77K) in the center of the secB gene. In vivo, mutant SecBL75Q and SecBE77K proteins are capable of binding to precursor maltose-binding protein (MBP) and preventing the formation of export-incompetent precursor MBP; however, export of MBP is still defective. In vitro, purified SecBL75Q and SecBE77K proteins bound to unfolded MBP and blocked its refolding. SecBL75Q and SecBE77K were more effective than wild-type SecB at blocking the refolding of unfolded MBP, suggesting that SecBL75Q and SecBE77K have a higher affinity for unfolded MBP."
https://openalex.org/W1489615545,"Previous results have not established whether the attainment of a rapid photophosphorylation rate as ADP concentration is increased in the micromolar range (apparent Km = approximately 30 microM) results from the filling of a second or a third catalytic site. Measurements reported here show that the ATP synthase of chloroplast thylakoids, with 2-4 microM medium ADP present during steady-state photophosphorylation, has one catalytic site filled with tightly bound nucleotides, but other catalytic sites are largely empty. Thus, the rapid increase in the photophosphorylation rate with higher ADP concentrations results from the filling of a second catalytic site. Even with 30 microM added ADP in the dark, the binding of more than one ADP per synthase was not detectable. The sensitivity of the assay was such that the Kd for binding of ADP at a second catalytic site of the de-energized synthase is > 150 microM, considerably above the apparent Km for rapid photophosphorylation. This result can be explained by an increase in the affinity of a second catalytic site for ADP upon energization. Other experiments assessed the effect of ADP binding at a second catalytic site on the equilibrium between bound ATP and ADP and P(i) at the tight catalytic site. When the rate of photophosphorylation is limited by a low ADP concentration, about equal amounts of ATP and ADP are bound at one catalytic site on the synthase. In contrast, when the rate is limited by a low P(i) concentration with 100 microM ADP present, the equilibrium of bound reactants is shifted so that close to one ATP per synthase is present. This is as expected if the binding of ADP at a second catalytic site allows the protonmotive force to promote ATP formation from ADP and P(i) at a tight binding catalytic site. A scheme for the binding change mechanism incorporating these results is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1481040073,"Intermediate lipid structures such as inverted micelles and interlamellar attachments, which can form near liquid crystalline lamellar (L alpha) to inverted hexagonal (HII) phase boundaries, are thought to play a role in membrane fusion. To investigate whether these structures are also involved in influenza hemagglutinin-mediated membrane fusion, measurement of fusion under conditions where such structures could not form was attempted. It was found that the fusion of influenza virus with liposomal membranes containing phosphatidylcholine and gangliosides, which cannot form HII phases, was only slightly slower than fusion with liposomes that also contained the HII competent phosphatidylethanolamine. Furthermore, the virus fused efficiently with liposomes consisting either of pure saturated phosphatidylcholines or phosphatidylcholine/ganglioside mixtures, even when the liposomal membranes were in the gel (L beta') phase and thus far from L alpha/HII transitions. Isolated hemagglutinin, reconstituted into dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine membranes, induced fusion with liposomes composed of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine and gangliosides at temperatures below the L beta' to L alpha phase transition temperature of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine. This latter finding excluded the possibility that the viral lipids alone could have formed inverted phase intermediates, thus enabling them to fuse with liposomes that do not contain lipids capable of forming inverted phases. Therefore, it is concluded that structures resembling intermediates in L alpha/HII transitions are most likely not involved in influenza hemagglutinin-mediated fusion."
https://openalex.org/W1561527941,"The effect of histamine on steady-state mRNA levels of three soluble secretory proteins from chromaffin granules was investigated in cultured bovine adrenal medullary cells. Histamine stimulated secretogranin II mRNA 4-fold, with no or only slight effects on chromogranin A and B transcription. After an initial lag phase, secretogranin II mRNA increased markedly between 4 and 12 h followed by a plateau phase up to 48 h. The effect of histamine on secretogranin II gene-expression was abolished by the H1 receptor antagonist promethazine but not by the H2 blocker cimetidine. The histamine-induced elevation of secretogranin II mRNA was partially reduced by the L-type calcium channel blocker nifedipine, indicating a contribution of extracellular calcium in the second messenger signaling pathway involved. At present, the H1 histaminergic receptor is the first membrane receptor found regulating secretogranin II biosynthesis in chromaffin cells. The selective up-regulation of secretogranin II mRNA but not of chromogranin A and B by histamine is another example illustrating that the synthesis regulation of secretory components co-stored in large vesicles of neuroendocrine cells is specific to the individual gene. Together with results obtained earlier, our data demonstrate a marked variation in the relative composition of peptides secreted from adrenal medulla into circulation following different physiologic conditions."

(1990) Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler 371, 573-547). Analysis of the beta-DiCys-50,61-linked DBV by 1H homonuclear and 1H-13C heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy establishes that the thioether bond from Cys-50 is to the 3-carbon of the DBV ring A and that from Cys-61 is to the 18'-carbon of ring D, i.e. the peptide-linked bilin is an 8,12-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-3-(2-(cysteinyl-S)-ethyl)-18-(1-(cysteinyl-S)-e thyl)- 2,7,13,17-tetramethylbiladiene-ab-1,19(16H,21H)-dione. DBV is also present at beta-DiCys-50,61 in cryptomonad strain UW374 phycocyanin 645 (Wedemayer, G. J., Kidd, D. G., Wemmer, D. E., and Glazer, A. N. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 7315-7331). NMR spectroscopy shows that the thioether bonds to this DBV are also at 3 and 18'. Linkage of tetrapyrroles to polypeptides through the 3-carbon has not hitherto been reported."
https://openalex.org/W1522612665,"The binding of single- as well as double-stranded DNA to RecA, in the presence of the cofactor analog ATP gamma S (adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)), leads to about 20% quenching of the tyrosine fluorescence of the protein but to no essential change of the tryptophan fluorescence. The excitation spectrum of the fluorescent DNA analog poly(d epsilon A), complexed with RecA, shows no sign of energy transfer from the tyrosine residues of RecA to the etheno-modified adenine bases of the polynucleotide. From this observation we reject stacking interaction between tyrosine residues and DNA bases. The RecA filament may bind up to three molecules of single-stranded DNA; however, the observed fluorescence change occurs only upon the binding of the first DNA strand, indicating that the binding mode of this first strand is different from those of the others. The fluorescence change is interpreted in terms of a conformational change of the RecA protein promoted by cooperative binding to DNA. A larger quenching (40%) upon the binding of single-stranded DNA is observed in the absence of cofactor. At high salt condition, which induces ATPase activity in RecA just as DNA binding does, the tyrosine fluorescence is more pronounced than at low salt conditions, indicating that the effect induced by high salt is different from the conformational change induced by DNA binding."
https://openalex.org/W1502393459,"The catalytic domain of Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase located within the first 400 amino acids of the protein can be cleaved by trypsin in two subdomains (T25 and T18) corresponding to ATP-(T25) and calmodulin (CaM)-(T18) binding sites. Reassociation of subdomains by CaM is a cooperative process, which is a unique case among CaM-activated enzymes. To understand better the molecular basis of this phenomenon, we used several approaches such as partial deletions of the adenylate cyclase gene, isolation of peptides of various size, and site-directed mutagenesis experiments. We found that a stretch of 72 amino acid residues overlapping the carboxyl terminus of T25 and the amino terminus of T18 accounts for 90% of the binding energy of adenylate cyclase-CaM complex. The hydrophobic side of the helical region situated around Trp242 plays a major role in the interaction of adenylate cyclase with CaM, whereas basic residues that alternate with acidic residues in bacterial enzyme play a much less important role. The amino-terminal half of the catalytic domain of adenylate cyclase contributes only 10% to the binding energy of CaM, whereas the last 130 amino acid residues are not at all involved in binding. However, these segments of adenylate cyclase might affect protein/protein interaction and catalysis by propagating conformational changes to the CaM-binding sequence which is located in the middle of the catalytic domain of bacterial enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1777608057,"Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) from the cytosol of rat liver has 13 cysteines, at least one of which (Cys288) is known to be very reactive and critical for catalytic activity (Lewis, C. T., Seyer, J. M., and Carlson, G. M. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 27-33). Previous results provided evidence for the existence of at least 1 pair of vicinal cysteines within or near the active site of PEPCK (Lewis, C. T., Haley, B. E., and Carlson, G. M. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 9248-9255). An intramolecular cystine disulfide is induced to form upon treatment of PEPCK with equimolar 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) (Nbs2) or upon irradiation of the enzyme in the presence of the photoaffinity probe 8-azidoGTP. In each case, modification is accompanied by a substantial loss in catalytic activity, and substrates protect against inactivation and modification. We now report the identification of these modified thiols by differential alkylation of cysteines and half-cystines with radioactive iodoacetate, followed by isolation and sequencing of the modified tryptic peptides. The results indicate that the disulfide formed by equimolar Nbs2 lies within a 15-residue region of the PEPCK sequence that includes Cys399, Cys407, and Cys413. In addition, Cys407 and/or Cys413 also appear to participate in formation of the disulfide induced by 8-azidoGTP. These thiols lie very near a consensus sequence that has been suggested to represent the binding site for the guanine ring of GTP."
https://openalex.org/W1509732499,"The tyrosine fluorescence of the RecA protein is quenched by about 15% upon binding of the cofactor analog adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (ATPgammaS). This quenching is not observed with a modified RecA in which the tyrosine residue at position 264 (Tyr-264) is replaced for alanine by site-directed mutagenesis, a modification which also results in a decrease of binding affinity of cofactor. This indicates that Tyr-264 is responsible for the fluorescence change and that the residue is close to or within the cofactor binding site. Upon DNA binding, a change of tyrosine fluorescence is observed both with the modified protein and with wild type RecA, indicating that DNA binding affects the environment of other tyrosine residues than Tyr-264. However, the change is significantly smaller in the modified protein, suggesting that both Tyr-264 as well as other residue(s) may be affected by the DNA binding. Changed fluorescence properties of the remaining tyrosine residues as a result of a slightly different DNA binding mode of the modified protein are also possible. Tyr-264 may be an important residue for the allosteric effect induced by the cofactor for the binding of DNA to RecA. In the recent crystal structure of RecA-ADP published by Story and Steitz (Story, R. M., and Steitz, T. A. (1992) Nature 355, 374-376), ADP is stacked with Tyr-103 and does not interact with Tyr-264. The fact that we observe no interaction of ATPgammaS with Tyr-103 (as evidenced from absence of fluorescence change) but instead with Tyr-264 may suggest an important conformational difference between the RecA complexes with, respectively, ADP and ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1539607139,"Alterations in intracellular cation concentrations in the kidney during hyperglycemia may play a role in a number of complications associated with diabetes mellitus such as renal hypertrophy and hypertension. In this study, we have investigated the effect of 25 mM glucose on intracellular pH and free Mg2+, free Ca2+, and Na+ concentrations in the perfused kidneys of Sprague-Dawley rats using 31P, 19F, and 23Na triple-quantum filtered NMR. No significant alteration occurred in the intracellular free Mg2+ concentration, pH, or ATP concentration during hyperglycemia. However, a sizable (approximately 50%) increase in the intracellular Na+ concentration was inferred from 23Na triple-quantum filtered NMR after 30-45 min of perfusion with 25 mM glucose. Intracellular free Ca2+, measured to be 390 +/- 15 nM at 5 mM glucose, increased significantly (95%; p < 0.001) to a value of 765 +/- 28 nM after 30 min of perfusion with 25 mM glucose. This effect of glucose was reversible. Only small increases (< or = 20%) in free Ca2+ were found with addition of comparable concentrations of a nontransportable sugar (20 mM mannitol), indicating that glucose entry into the cell (through the Na+/glucose cotransporter) plays a role in causing the free Ca2+ increase. No effect on free Ca2+ was however, seen with 1 mM ouabain, which caused a sizable increase in intracellular Na+, indicating that Na+/Ca2+ exchange does not play a significant role in the maintenance of low intracellular free Ca2+ in the kidney and that the observed increase in free Ca2+ is probably due to a decrease in the Ca2+/Mg(2+)-ATPase activity during hyperglycemia. Increased concentrations of Na+ and free Ca2+ during hyperglycemia may be involved in the mechanism of renal hypertrophy and hypertension, frequently associated with diabetes mellitus."
https://openalex.org/W1589435223,"We analyzed the chimeric guide RNA (gRNA)-mRNA molecules in Crithidia fasciculata that are predicted to transiently exist in editing of the 5'-terminal domain of apocytochrome b (CYb) mRNA, by polymerase chain reaction amplification and DNA sequencing, and obtained evidence suggesting that among the 14 editing sites numbered from 3' to 5', the sequence in the 3'-half of the sites (3' block) was specified by one guide RNA species (gRNA-I) and that in the remaining half of the sites (5' block) by the other guide RNA species (gRNA-II) and that the direction of editing in each block was 3' to 5'. The predicted transition site of editing by two gRNAs was between the first and second U residues from the 3' end within editing site 7. We found that a stretch of the edited sequence in the 3' block of mRNA could form a stable duplex with a stretch immediately upstream of the guide sequence in gRNA-II. The result leads to a successive editing model that the 3' block of pre-edited mRNA is first edited by gRNA-I, and after completion of editing, the 5' portion of gRNA-II pairs with the edited mRNA for editing of the 5' block."
