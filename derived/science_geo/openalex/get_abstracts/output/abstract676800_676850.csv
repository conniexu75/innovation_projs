https://openalex.org/W3174064560,"Metabolism is a major regulator of immune cell function, but it remains difficult to study the metabolic status of individual cells. Here, we present Compass, an algorithm to characterize cellular metabolic states based on single-cell RNA sequencing and flux balance analysis. We applied Compass to associate metabolic states with T helper 17 (Th17) functional variability (pathogenic potential) and recovered a metabolic switch between glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation, akin to known Th17/regulatory T cell (Treg) differences, which we validated by metabolic assays. Compass also predicted that Th17 pathogenicity was associated with arginine and downstream polyamine metabolism. Indeed, polyamine-related enzyme expression was enhanced in pathogenic Th17 and suppressed in Treg cells. Chemical and genetic perturbation of polyamine metabolism inhibited Th17 cytokines, promoted Foxp3 expression, and remodeled the transcriptome and epigenome of Th17 cells toward a Treg-like state. In vivo perturbations of the polyamine pathway altered the phenotype of encephalitogenic T cells and attenuated tissue inflammation in CNS autoimmunity."

https://openalex.org/W3173925204,"Polyamine synthesis represents one of the most profound metabolic changes during T cell activation, but the biological implications of this are scarcely known. Here, we show that polyamine metabolism is a fundamental process governing the ability of CD4+ helper T cells (TH) to polarize into different functional fates. Deficiency in ornithine decarboxylase, a crucial enzyme for polyamine synthesis, results in a severe failure of CD4+ T cells to adopt correct subset specification, underscored by ectopic expression of multiple cytokines and lineage-defining transcription factors across TH cell subsets. Polyamines control TH differentiation by providing substrates for deoxyhypusine synthase, which synthesizes the amino acid hypusine, and mice in which T cells are deficient for hypusine develop severe intestinal inflammatory disease. Polyamine-hypusine deficiency caused widespread epigenetic remodeling driven by alterations in histone acetylation and a re-wired tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Thus, polyamine metabolism is critical for maintaining the epigenome to focus TH cell subset fidelity."
https://openalex.org/W3181537867,"Exome association studies to date have generally been underpowered to systematically evaluate the phenotypic impact of very rare coding variants. We leveraged extensive haplotype sharing between 49,960 exome-sequenced UK Biobank participants and the remainder of the cohort (total n ≈ 500,000) to impute exome-wide variants with accuracy R2 > 0.5 down to minor allele frequency (MAF) ~0.00005. Association and fine-mapping analyses of 54 quantitative traits identified 1,189 significant associations (P < 5 × 10−8) involving 675 distinct rare protein-altering variants (MAF < 0.01) that passed stringent filters for likely causality. Across all traits, 49% of associations (578/1,189) occurred in genes with two or more hits; follow-up analyses of these genes identified allelic series containing up to 45 distinct ‘likely-causal’ variants. Our results demonstrate the utility of within-cohort imputation in population-scale genome-wide association studies, provide a catalog of likely-causal, large-effect coding variant associations and foreshadow the insights that will be revealed as genetic biobank studies continue to grow. Imputation of rare coding variants in the UK Biobank enables association and fine-mapping analyses of rare (minor allele frequency (MAF) = 0.00005) genotypes, identifying 600 new variant–trait associations, including long allelic series in individual genes."

https://openalex.org/W3178308946,"Fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO), an N6-methyladenosine (m6A) demethylase, participates in tumor progression and metastasis in many malignancies, but its role in colorectal cancer (CRC) is still unclear. Here, we found that FTO protein levels, but not RNA levels, were downregulated in CRC tissues. Reduced FTO protein expression was correlated with a high recurrence rate and poor prognosis in resectable CRC patients. Moreover, we demonstrated that hypoxia restrained FTO protein expression, mainly due to an increase in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. The serine/threonine kinase receptor associated protein (STRAP) might served as the E3 ligase and K216 was the major ubiquitination site responsible for hypoxia-induced FTO degradation. FTO inhibited CRC metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, FTO exerted a tumor suppressive role by inhibiting metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1) expression in an m6A-dependent manner. Methylated MTA1 transcripts were recognized by an m6A ""reader"", insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2), which then stabilized its mRNA. Together, our findings highlight the critical role of FTO in CRC metastasis and reveal a novel epigenetic mechanism by which the hypoxic tumor microenvironment promotes CRC metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W3177528417,"Background A concern has been that health care reorganizations during the first COVID-19 wave have led to delays in elective surgeries, resulting in increased complications and even mortality. This multicenter study examined the changes in waiting times of elective surgeries during the COVID-19 pandemic in Finland. Methods Data on elective surgery were gathered from three Finnish public hospitals for years 2017–2020. Surgery incidence and waiting times were examined and the year 2020 was compared to the reference years 2017–2019. The mean annual, monthly, and weekly waiting times were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The most common diagnosis groups were examined separately. Findings A total of 88 693 surgeries were included during the study period. The mean waiting time in 2020 was 92.6 (CI 91.5–93.8) days, whereas the mean waiting time in the reference years was 85.8 (CI 85.1–86.5) days, resulting in an average 8% increase in waiting times in 2020. Elective procedure incidence decreased rapidly in the onset of the first COVID-19 wave in March 2020 but recovered in May and June, after which the surgery incidence was 22% higher than in the reference years and remained at this level until the end of the year. In May 2020 and thereafter until November, waiting times were longer with monthly increases varying between 7% and 34%. In gastrointestinal and genitourinary diseases and neoplasms, waiting times were longer in 2020. In cardiovascular and musculoskeletal diseases, waiting times were shorter in 2020. Conclusion The health care reorganizations due to the pandemic have increased elective surgery waiting times by as much as one-third, even though the elective surgery rate increased by one-fifth after the lockdown."
https://openalex.org/W3173569745,"Cellular processes arise from the dynamic organization of proteins in networks of physical interactions. Mapping the interactome has therefore been a central objective of high-throughput biology. However, the dynamics of protein interactions across physiological contexts remain poorly understood. Here, we develop a quantitative proteomic approach combining protein correlation profiling with stable isotope labeling of mammals (PCP-SILAM) to map the interactomes of seven mouse tissues. The resulting maps provide a proteome-scale survey of interactome rewiring across mammalian tissues, revealing more than 125,000 unique interactions at a quality comparable to the highest-quality human screens. We identify systematic suppression of cross-talk between the evolutionarily ancient housekeeping interactome and younger, tissue-specific modules. Rewired proteins are tightly regulated by multiple cellular mechanisms and are implicated in disease. Our study opens up new avenues to uncover regulatory mechanisms that shape in vivo interactome responses to physiological and pathophysiological stimuli in mammalian systems."

Surprisingly, human CD28-dependent T cell responses are largely redundant for protective immunity. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections of cutaneous keratinocytes cause various types of lesions, including flat and common warts (Cubie, 2013Cubie H.A. Diseases associated with human papillomavirus infection.Virology. 2013; 445: 21-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Common warts are typically caused by α-papillomavirus HPV-2 and γ-papillomavirus HPV-4. They are seen in the general population, in which they are typically localized and benign (Cubie, 2013Cubie H.A. Diseases associated with human papillomavirus infection.Virology. 2013; 445: 21-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). However, they can persist and spread in patients with various inherited or acquired T cell immunodeficiencies, who are also prone to a number of other infections (Béziat, 2020Béziat V. Human genetic dissection of papillomavirus-driven diseases: new insight into their pathogenesis.Hum. Genet. 2020; 139: 919-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). “Cutaneous horns” are protrusions of keratotic material of various sizes and shapes that may arise from single common warts (Mantese et al., 2010Mantese S.A. de O. Diogo P.M. Rocha A. Berbert A.L.C.V. Ferreira A.K.M. Ferreira T.C. Cutaneous horn: a retrospective histopathological study of 222 cases.An. Bras.

Dermatol. 1991; 124: 449-452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These “cutaneous horns” are often both giant and disseminated. This generalized severe hyperkeratotic cutaneous papillomatosis has been named “tree man syndrome” (TMS) (Alisjahbana et al., 2010Alisjahbana B. Dinata R. Sutedja E. Suryahudaya I. Soedjana H.

Only four unrelated TMS cases have been reported, and the α-papillomavirus HPV-2, a classic cause of common warts (Orth et al., 1977Orth G. Favre M. Croissant O. Characterization of a new type of human papillomavirus that causes skin warts.J. Virol. 1977; 24: 108-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was demonstrated to be the cause of three of these cases (Alisjahbana et al., 2010Alisjahbana B. Dinata R. Sutedja E. Suryahudaya I. Soedjana H. Hidajat N.N. Soetikno R.D. Oktaliansah E. Deng A. Rady P. et al.Disfiguring generalized verrucosis in an indonesian man with idiopathic CD4 lymphopenia.Arch.

Detection of HPV-2 and identification of novel mutations by whole genome sequencing from biopsies of two patients with multiple cutaneous horns.J. Clin. Virol. 2007; 39: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). These viruses have not been analyzed in depth, and the genomes of the keratinocytes in these lesions were not sequenced. Remarkably, TMS patients have severe skin lesions despite being normally resistant to other infections. TMS should not be confused with epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV), the cutaneous warts of which are actually flat and caused by β-HPVs (de Jong et al., 2018ade Jong S.J. Imahorn E. Itin P. Uitto J. Orth G. Jouanguy E. Casanova J.-L. Burger B. Epidermodysplasia Verruciformis: Inborn Errors of Immunity to Human Beta-Papillomaviruses.Front. Microbiol. 2018; 9: 1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The flat warts of EV often progress to non-melanoma skin cancers. “Typical” or “isolated EV” is due to biallelic null mutations of TMC6 (encoding EVER1), TMC8 (encoding EVER2), or CIB1, selectively disrupting keratinocyte-intrinsic immunity to these viruses (de Jong et al., 2018bde Jong S.J. Créquer A. Matos I. Hum D. Gunasekharan V. Lorenzo L. Jabot-Hanin F. Imahorn E. Arias A.A. Vahidnezhad H. et al.The human CIB1-EVER1-EVER2 complex governs keratinocyte-intrinsic immunity to β-papillomaviruses.J. Exp.

Mutations in two adjacent novel genes are associated with epidermodysplasia verruciformis.Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 579-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Patients with “atypical” or “syndromic EV” display a number of other infections, due to various inborn errors of T cells (de Jong et al., 2018ade Jong S.J. Imahorn E. Itin P. Uitto J. Orth G. Jouanguy E. Casanova J.-L. Burger B. Epidermodysplasia Verruciformis: Inborn Errors of Immunity to Human Beta-Papillomaviruses.Front. Microbiol. 2018; 9: 1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Consistently, T cell responses against commensal β-HPVs may protect against skin cancers in the general population (Strickley et al., 2019Strickley J.D. Messerschmidt J.L. Awad M.E. Li T. Hasegawa T. Ha D.T. Nabeta H.W. Bevins P.A. Ngo K.H. Asgari M.M. et al.Immunity to commensal papillomaviruses protects against skin cancer.Nature. 2019; 575: 519-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The rarity and lack of contagiousness of TMS are intriguing, given the ubiquitous and benign nature of the underlying HPV-2 infection. By analogy with EV, it is tempting to speculate that TMS may result from inborn errors of immunity to HPV-2. However, by contrast to most EV kindreds, the four reported cases of TMS were sporadic, as opposed to familial, and parental consanguinity was not reported (Alisjahbana et al., 2010Alisjahbana B. Dinata R. Sutedja E. Suryahudaya I. Soedjana H. Hidajat N.N. Soetikno R.D. Oktaliansah E. Deng A. Rady P. et al.Disfiguring generalized verrucosis in an indonesian man with idiopathic CD4 lymphopenia.Arch.

Virol. 2007; 39: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, TMS lesions are strikingly reminiscent of those caused by natural infection with Shope virus, the cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (CRPV), in wild rabbits (Breitburd et al., 1997Breitburd F. Salmon J. Orth G. The rabbit viral skin papillomas and carcinomas: a model for the immunogenetics of HPV-associated carcinogenesis.Clin. Dermatol. 1997; 15: 237-247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar; Giri et al., 1985Giri I. Danos O. Yaniv M. Genomic structure of the cottontail rabbit (Shope) papillomavirus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1985; 82: 1580-1584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In 1933, Richard E. Shope showed that some cottontail rabbits from the US Midwest displayed giant horns caused by a filterable virus (Shope and Hurst, 1933Shope R.E. Hurst E.W. Infectious Papillomatosis of Rabbits: With a Note on the Histopathology.J. Exp. Med. 1933; 58: 607-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Peyton Rous performed experimental infections in 1934 and showed that warts resolved in less than 10% of wild cottontail rabbits (between 2–8 weeks after wart appearance), with 65% of rabbits displaying persistent warts, sometime overlaid by giant horns and 25% going on to develop malignant lesions affecting internal organs within 6–12 months (Rous and Beard, 1934Rous P. Beard J.W. A Virus-Induced Mammalian Growth with the Characters of a Tumor (the Shope Rabbit Papilloma): I. the Growth on Implantation Within Favorable Hosts.J. Exp. Med. 1934; 60: 701-722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Remarkably, it was shown in 1991 that, in outbred New Zealand White rabbits, the persistence of skin lesions segregated with MHC class II genes, indicating that these CRPV-driven lesions are genetically controlled and due to inadequate CD4+ T cell immunity (Han et al., 1992Han R. Breitburd F. Marche P.N. Orth G. Linkage of regression and malignant conversion of rabbit viral papillomas to MHC class II genes.Nature. 1992; 356: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The genetic and immunological basis of these lesions has not been characterized further in wild or domestic rabbits. These observations suggest that human TMS might result from an inherited immunodeficiency. Three of the TMS patients had an apparently normal T cell compartment (Wang et al., 2007aWang C. Wang W. Lei Y.J. Wang J.Y. Dong X.P. Wang J. Sheng R.H. Pan Z.A. Zhu W.Y. You L.P. et al.Multiple huge cutaneous horns overlying verrucae vulgaris induced by human papillomavirus type 2: a case report.Br. J.

Case Rep. 2018; 6: 1426-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar), but the fourth displayed idiopathic CD4+ T cell lymphopenia (Alisjahbana et al., 2010Alisjahbana B. Dinata R. Sutedja E. Suryahudaya I. Soedjana H. Hidajat N.N. Soetikno R.D. Oktaliansah E. Deng A. Rady P. et al.Disfiguring generalized verrucosis in an indonesian man with idiopathic CD4 lymphopenia.Arch. Dermatol. 2010; 146: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We thus hypothesized that TMS might result from inborn errors of immunity to HPV-2, a causal agent of common warts. We studied a 30-year-old Iranian patient with TMS (P1) and two of his relatives with a history of disseminated common warts (P2 and P3, aged 40 and 12 years, respectively; see case reports in the STAR Methods) (Figures 1A and 1B ). A detailed clinical description is provided in the STAR Methods. We performed single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array-based genome-wide linkage (GWL) analysis on the three patients and 13 relatives, testing the hypothesis of an autosomal recessive (AR) trait with complete penetrance. Highly significant evidence of linkage was obtained for a single 20.5 Mb region on chromosome 2 (LOD score = 5.12) (Figure 1C). The high percentage of homozygosity in P1 (6%), P2 (5%), and P3 (10%) on microarray analysis confirmed the consanguinity of their parents (Figures 1A and S1A). We also analyzed whole-exome sequencing (WES) results for P1, P2, and P3 (Figure S1B). None of the known genes underlying Mendelian disorders carried heterozygous or homozygous rare non-synonymous or splice variants. Within the linked region, only three protein-coding genes, including CD28, displayed non-synonymous or splice variants, which were also homozygous and rare (minor allele frequency [MAF] <0.01; Figures S1B and S1C). CD28 is a major costimulatory molecule of T cells that can be engaged by CD80 or CD86 on antigen-presenting cells (Rudd et al., 2009Rudd C.E. Taylor A. Schneider H. CD28 and CTLA-4 coreceptor expression and signal transduction.Immunol. Rev. 2009; 229: 12-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). The private variant of CD28 in this kindred affects the last nucleotide of exon 1 (c.52G>A). It is predicted to replace codon 18, encoding the glycine residue in the last position of the signal peptide, with a codon encoding arginine (p.Gly18Arg) (Figure 1D). Moreover, the c.52G>A variant is computationally predicted to disrupt the donor site for splicing located between exons 1 and 2 (Desmet et al., 2009Desmet F.-O. Hamroun D. Lalande M. Collod-Béroud G. Claustres M. Béroud C. Human Splicing Finder: an online bioinformatics tool to predict splicing signals.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: e67Crossref PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar). The c.52G>A variant has a CADD score of 13.8, above the MSC of 9.2 (Figure 1E) (Kircher et al., 2014Kircher M. Witten D.M. Jain P. O’Roak B.J. Cooper G.M. Shendure J.

Methods. 2016; 13: 109-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The segregation of this mutant allele is consistent with a fully penetrant AR trait (Figure 1A). Moreover, there are only five homozygous missense CD28 variants, all with a MAF >0.00002, in public databases (gnomAD, TOPMed, ATAVDB, GME) (Figure 1E). The other two homozygous variants were predicted (KANSL1L) or shown to be neutral (USP37) (Figures S1D–S1H). Moreover, we showed CD28−/− mice to be vulnerable to MmuPV1 (Figure S2). Collectively, these findings suggest that AR CD28 deficiency is exceedingly rare in the general population and disease-causing in this kindred.Figure S1Familial genetics, population genetics of KANSL1L and USP37, and functional assay for the pGlu459Lys USP37 allele, related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Homozygosity rates for P1 to P3 relative to consanguineous (open circles) and nonconsanguineous (closed circles) ethnically matched controls.

This region includes CD28 (Gly18Arg), USP37 (p.Glu459Lys) and KANSL1L (p.Ser577Thr). USP37 and KANSL1L have no known role in immunity. USP37 expression is ubiquitous, and involved in the cell cycle and homologous recombination (Huang et al., 2011Huang X. Summers M.K. Pham V. Lill J.R. Liu J. Lee G. Kirkpatrick D.S. Jackson P.K.

The mutation in USP37 results in a glutamic acid-to-lysine exchange at position 459. Glutamic acid is negatively charged, whereas lysine is positively charged.

The p.Ser577Thr KANSL1L variant was identified four times, in the homozygous state, in the ATAVDB database and its minor allele frequency is as high as 0.004 in South Asians (gnomAD). By contrast, the USP37 variant in our patients was private.(F) Amino-acid conservation, across species, for the mutated area of the KANSL1L and USP37 proteins. KANSL1L orthologs are found in other taxonomic groups, as far back in evolution as insects (Drosophila melanogaster), but serine 577 is conserved only in mammals, a threonine residue being present in the corresponding position in Drosophila. Together, population genetics, evolutionary genetics, and biochemical analysis suggest that this KANSL1L variant is neutral. USP37 orthologs are found across vertebrates, but the glutamic acid in position 459 is conserved only in mammals. In birds and amphibians, it is replaced by an aspartic acid, an amino acid with a similar negative charge. (G-H) Population genetics, evolutionary genetics, and biochemical analysis suggested that the USP37 variant might be deleterious. We therefore assessed the functional impact of the p.Glu459Lys substitution on USP37 deubiquitination (Huang et al., 2011Huang X. Summers M.K. Pham V. Lill J.R. Liu J. Lee G. Kirkpatrick D.S.

We immunoprecipitated and purified WT or p.Glu459Lys mutant USP37 overproduced in HEK293T cells and performed an in vitro deubiquitination assay with K48-linked ubiquitin chains (2-7-mer) as a substrate, followed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining.(G) Amounts of immunopurified USP37 (WT, MUT) protein used in H.

Images of a wild-type mouse (left) are also shown for comparison. We infected the muzzle and tail of 23 (15 male and 8 female) Cd28-/- mice, six Rag1−/− mice, and 27 WT mice with MmuPV1. Rag-1−/− mice have no T or B cells. We monitored skin lesions between two and seven weeks before the animals were killed. None of the WT C57BL/6 mice developed skin lesions, consistent with the findings of previous studies (Hu et al., 2017Hu J. Cladel N.M. Budgeon L.R. Balogh K.K. Christensen N.D. The Mouse Papillomavirus Infection Model.Viruses. 2017; 9: 246Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). All six Rag1−/− mice developed skin warts three weeks post infection. These lesions persisted until the end of monitoring. Cd28−/− mice were tested for infection and killed at various time points (week 2, 3, 4, and 5) after infection. As many as 72% of Cd28-/- mice began to develop visible lesions three weeks post-infection (of 21 mice with at least three weeks of follow-up). The lesions began to regress in week 4 and disappeared during week 5. The spontaneous regression of the lesions observed in mice six weeks after infection was reminiscent of that seen in P2.(B) Infected tissues from Cd28-/- mice were harvested at different time points for additional tests, including histology (H&E staining), immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH). Tail tissues from Cd28−/− mice displayed epidermal hyperplasia, with vacuolated cells and parakeratosis. Strong MmuPV1 DNA and RNA (E1ˆE4) signals, equivalent to those observed in infected Rag1−/− mice, were detected in infected Cd28-/- mice by in situ hybridization three weeks after infection. Using antibodies against E4 and L1, we detected strong viral protein signals in the lesions. Viral signals (DNA/RNA/protein) were absent from the tail tissues of Cd28-/- and WT C57BL/6 mice displaying regression after week 5 post viral infection (not shown). Representative images of a wart and healthy skin from the same CD28-deficient animal are shown. The data shown are representative of the three experiments performed.(C) RT-qPCR measuring MmuPV1 viral load in the skin lesions of CD28-deficient mice post-infection (2-5 weeks). Intralesional viral load was determined by RT-qPCR for MmuPV1 E1ˆE4 mRNA. The viral mRNA load was high as early as week 2 post-infection, despite the lesions not yet being visible. Viral load peaked three weeks after infection, began to decrease in week 4 and disappeared in week 5.(D) ELISA measuring anti-MmuPV1 E4 and L1 antibodies in RAG1−/−, WT or CD28−/− mouse plasma sampled 3-6 weeks post-infection. Normal anti-L1 and E4 Ab levels were detected in Cd28−/− but not Rag1−/− mice. These data demonstrate that Cd28−/− mice can mount an anti-MmuPV1 T- and B cell response, but their control and clearance of infection are impaired, consistent with the clearance of the lesions of P2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A) Homozygosity rates for P1 to P3 relative to consanguineous (open circles) and nonconsanguineous (closed circles) ethnically matched controls.

In retrospective cohort studies, use of famotidine, a specific oral H2 receptor antagonist (antihistamine), has been associated with reduced risk of intubation and death in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. In a case series, nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19 experienced rapid symptom resolution after taking famotidine, but the molecular basis of these observations remains elusive. Here we show using biochemical, cellular, and functional assays that famotidine has no effect on viral replication or viral protease activity. However, famotidine can affect histamine-induced signaling processes in infected Caco2 cells. Specifically, famotidine treatment inhibits histamine-induced expression of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and can reduce TLR3-dependent signaling processes that culminate in activation of IRF3 and the NF-κB pathway, subsequently controlling antiviral and inflammatory responses. SARS-CoV-2-infected cells treated with famotidine demonstrate reduced expression levels of the inflammatory mediators CCL-2 and IL6, drivers of the cytokine release syndrome that precipitates poor outcome for patients with COVID-19. Given that pharmacokinetic studies indicate that famotidine can reach concentrations in blood that suffice to antagonize histamine H2 receptors expressed in mast cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils, these observations explain how famotidine may contribute to the reduced histamine-induced inflammation and cytokine release, thereby improving the outcome for patients with COVID-19.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) affected more than 100 million people with more than 2 million deaths as of February 18, 2021. Many drugs are being repurposed for COVID-19 therapy, often based on insufficient evidence from randomized trials. Famotidine is an approved drug for peptic ulcers and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) (Fig. 1A). It acts as a competitive antagonist of histamine in gastric parietal cells. Histamine activates protein kinase A (PKA), which causes movement of H+/K+ transporters to the membrane resulting in more acid secretion. Famotidine counters this activity, thereby reducing acid secretion in GERD patients. Several independent case studies on COVID-19 patients have suggested the use of this H2-receptor antagonist in the treatment of disease. Famotidine reduces the risk of intubation and death in hospitalized COVID-19 patients (1Freedberg D.E. Conigliaro J. Wang T.C. Tracey K.J. Callahan M.V. Abrams J.A.

It has also been suggested to reduce respiratory symptoms in nonhospitalized patients (3Janowitz T. Gablenz E. Pattinson D. Wang T.C. Conigliaro J. Tracey K. Tuveson D.

In combination with the H1-receptor antagonist cetirizine, it has been shown to reduce pulmonary distress in hospitalized COVID-19 patients (4Hogan II, R.B. Hogan III, R.B. Cannon T. Rappai M.

These studies indicated that famotidine has a beneficial role in managing COVID-19 disease symptoms, but the molecular basis of these observations remained elusive. The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (CoV-2 3CLpro) and Papain-like protease (SARS-CoV-2 PLpro) have been suggested to be the targets of famotidine based on several virtual screening studies (5Wu C. Liu Y.

Rep. 2021; 11: 5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The efficacy of famotidine in COVID-19 patients observed in several clinical studies makes it possible that famotidine may affect host pathways in response to viral infection. The histamine H2 receptor targeted by famotidine is not limited to the stomach, but is also found in the brain, the endocrine and exocrine glands, the pulmonary system, and the cardiovascular system. H2 receptors are also present on mast cells (MCs), which are deregulated in viral infections including those caused by coronaviruses (8Kritas S.K. Ronconi G. Caraffa A. Gallenga C.E. Ross R. Conti P.

Studies show that famotidine (unlike cimetidine) reaches systemic concentrations that are sufficient to antagonize H2 receptors on other cell types such as those on MCs and neutrophils (9Malone R.W.

Deregulation of MCs contributes to a robust inflammatory response leading to a pulmonary cytokine storm that is seen in severe COVID-19 infections (11Afrin L.B. Weinstock L.B. Molderings G.J.

Upon activation, MCs release proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-33, TNF, CCL2, MCP-1), histamine, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes.

Weinstock L.B. Molderings G.J. Covid-19 hyperinflammation and post-Covid-19 illness may be rooted in mast cell activation syndrome.Int. J. Infect. Dis. 2020; 100: 327-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). TLR3-mediated signaling is an important antiviral signaling pathway that is activated in coronavirus infections (15Totura A.L. Whitmore A. Agnihothram S. Schäfer A. Katze M.G. Heise M.T. Baric R.S. Toll-like receptor 3 signaling via TRIF contributes to a protective innate immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection.MBio. 2015; 6: e00638Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). In humans, the TLR family comprises ten members (TLR1–TLR10), which are expressed in innate immune cells including macrophages, epithelial cells, and MCs. TLRs are pattern recognition receptors that recognize several pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) present in bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. TLRs on activation produce inflammatory cytokines, type I IFN, and other mediators. TLRs can be localized either on the cell surface (TLR-1, -2, -4, -5, -6, -10) or in endosomes (TLR-3, -7, -8, -9). SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell through the endosomal pathway and hence activates the endosomal TLRs. TLR activation via MyD88-dependent and TRIF-dependent pathways causes nuclear translocation of the transcription factors NF-κB, IRF-3, and IRF-7, with production of innate proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL- 6, TNF-α) and type I IFN-α/β, which are essential for antiviral responses. TLR3-dependent signaling is an important innate immune response to coronaviral infections (16Iwasaki A. Yang Y. The potential danger of suboptimal antibody responses in COVID-19.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2020; 20: 339-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Though TLR3 is beneficial in the initial viral clearance, hyperactivation may contribute to hyperinflammation and cause cytokine storms characteristic of severe cases of the disease (17Onofrio L. Caraglia M. Facchini G. Margherita V. Placido S.D. Buonerba C. Toll-like receptors and COVID-19: a two-faced story with an exciting ending.Future Sci. OA. 2020; 6: FSO6O5Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In this study, we assess the effect of famotidine on viral proteases (SARS-CoV-2 3CLPro and PLpro) and host cells using computational docking, in vitro and cell biological assays and infection studies. Our studies show that on infection, famotidine does not affect the viral life cycle and replication, but affects host cells by histamine-induced signaling processes. In cells treated with poly(I:C), which mimics viral RNA, histamine increases TLR3 expression leading to an increase in the downstream IRF3 and NF-κB-dependent signaling. SARS-CoV-2-infected Caco2 cells pretreated with famotidine show reduced activation of IRF3/NF-κB and had lower mRNA levels of the interferon gene ISG15 and inflammatory mediator CCL2. The inhibitory effect of famotidine on TBK1/IRF3 signaling can be restored by pretreating cells with the TLR3 inhibitor CU CPT4a. These observations indicate a molecular basis of how on-target effects of famotidine may help in management of histamine-induced inflammation in severe COVID-19 patients. Since several studies suggested that SARS-CoV-2 PLpro may be a target of famotidine (5Wu C. Liu Y. Yang Y. Zhang P. Zhong W. Wang Y. Wang Q. Xu Y. Li M. Li X. Zheng M. Chen L. Li H.

The results of docking showed two putative binding sites. At the catalytic site of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, where naphthalene inhibitors such as GRL-0617 bind (Fig. 1B) (18Ratia K. Pegan S. Takayama J.

Müller S. et al.Papain-like protease regulates SARS-CoV-2 viral spread and innate immunity.Nature. 2020; 587: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), the famotidine-binding mode is mainly electrostatic, dominated by three ionic interactions with R154, E165, and D162. This binding mode also shows three hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Y268, Q269, and T301, but lacks key interactions with P247 and P248 known from the GRL-0617-binding mode. The hydrogen bond between the sulfur of famotidine and the backbone of Q269 (S…NH) was far weaker than the CO…NH hydrogen bond in GRL-0617 binding. Interestingly, docking found another potential binding site near the S2 helix, which overlaps with the binding site for the N-lobes of ISG15 and K48-Ub2 (near F69 and T75) (Fig. 1C) (19Shin D.

Cell. 2016; 62: 572-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Binding of famotidine in this site may thus interfere with the binding of ISG15. However, this binding mode is less promising because the only remarkable interactions were an ionic interaction with R65 and a suboptimal cation-π interaction with F69. The interactions with P59 and P75 were too weak to contribute significantly to binding affinity. To test whether famotidine binds to the SARS-CoV-2 PLpro in vitro, we employed a thermal shift assay. In this assay inhibitor binding is assessed by the shift in the melting temperature of the target protein, which correlates with the strength of interaction between the protein and the putative drug. We found that the previously confirmed SARS-CoV-2 PLpro inhibitor GRL-0617 increased the Tm of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. By contrast, famotidine showed no effect on the denaturation curve of the protein (Fig. 1D). Similarly, famotidine did not affect the catalytic activity of either SARS-CoV-2 PLpro or SARS-CoV PLpro, measured by the velocity of AMC release from ubiquitin-AMC (ubiquitin–7-amido-4-methylcoumarin) in the presence of different concentrations of famotidine. On the other hand, GRL-0617 reduced the catalytic activity of both SARS-CoV-2 PLpro and SARS-CoV PLpro in the same assay (Fig. 1E). To examine whether famotidine can alter the binding of ISG15 to SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, we followed the modification of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro with ISG15-activity-based probes carrying a propargyl warhead. Whereas the level of modified SARS-CoV-2 PLpro decreased with GRL-0617, there were no such differences with famotidine (Fig. 1F). This result indicates that famotidine does not interact with PLpro or affect its activity in vitro. To test whether famotidine can affect PLpro in transfected cells, we checked the interaction between ISG15 and the catalytically inactive SARS-CoV-2 PLpro in interferon-α-treated A549 cells. ISG15 was coimmunoprecipitated with the mutant SARS-CoV-2 PLpro in interferon-α-treated cells. GRL-0617 inhibited this interaction, but famotidine had no effect (Fig. S1a).

Phosphorylation of TBK1 and IRF3 was inhibited in SARS-CoV-2 PLpro expressing A549 cells treated with interferon-α. GRL-0617 causes partial rescue of this inhibition, but famotidine has no effect (Fig. S1b). From existing literature and previous studies, it is known that SARS-CoV PLpro inhibits NF-κB signaling while SARS-CoV-2 PLpro exerts a stronger inhibitory effect on interferon signaling (18Ratia K.

Famotidine treatment (4 h, 50 μM) had no significant effect on interferon-β and NF-κB promoter activation in either SARS-CoV-2 PLpro or SARS-CoV PLpro transfected cells (Fig. S1, c and d). Also, famotidine did not affect the expression of cytokines, which are downstream of the type I interferon pathway (ISG15) or NF-κB-dependent inflammatory signaling (IL-6, IL-8) in SARS-CoV-2 PLpro expressing cells (Fig. S1f). Therefore, these experiments corroborate that famotidine does not show any effect on the interferon and NF-κB pathways in SARS-CoV-2 PLpro transfected cells. Several reports suggest that the antiviral effect of famotidine on patients is due to inhibition of the coronavirus main protease (23Matthews K. Schäfer A. Pham A. Frieman M. The SARS coronavirus papain like protease can inhibit IRF3 at a post activation step that requires deubiquitination activity.Virol. J. 2014; 11: 209Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The main protease of SARS-CoV-2 is a cysteine protease that shares ~95% homology to the 3CLpro of SARS-CoV. It cleaves the viral polyproteins and is hence essential for viral replication. Boceprevir has been found to be one of the strongest inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLPro, inhibiting ~60% activity of the protease at a concentration of 20 μM in a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based protease activity assay (24Ma C. Sacco M.D. Hurst B. Townsend J.A. Hu Y. Szeto T. Zhang X. Tarbet B. Marty M.T. Chen Y. Wang J.

We observed a robust decrease in 3CL-pro activity upon boceprevir treatment with an IC50 of 2.3 ± 0.2 μM. On the other hand, famotidine did not inhibit the activity of CoV-2 3CLpro (Fig. 2A). We further checked viral replication in cells treated with famotidine or remdesivir. Remdesivir inhibits the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARSCoV-2 (25Williamson B.N. Feldmann F. Schwarz B. Meade-White K. Porter D.P. Schulz J. van Doremalen N. Leighton I. Kwe Yinda C. Pérez-Pérez L. Okumura A. Lovaglio J. Hanley P.W. Saturday G.

Dienemann C. Seitz F. Schmitzova J. Farnung L. Siewert A. Höbartner C. Cramer P. Mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 polymerase stalling by remdesivir.Nat. Commun. 2021; 12: 279Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). There was no significant change in viral replication or any cytopathic effect (CPE) (measured by spike positive area) in famotidine-treated cells (Fig. 2B). Remdesivir caused a gradual dose-dependent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2-induced CPE with 1.25 μM remdesivir almost completely inhibiting CPE (Fig. 2B). Since famotidine is an H2 receptor antagonist, we assumed that the beneficial effects of famotidine in patients may be due to its on-target effect on H2 receptors. To see a global effect of famotidine in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, we analyzed the proteome of cells infected with SARSCoV-2 in the presence of histamine with or without famotidine treatment. Famotidine treatment led to a decrease in several proteins associated with the interferon pathway (IFIT1, IFIT2, ISG20, Herc5, Ube2L6), NF-κB pathway (NKAP, NFKBIB, RIPK1), and those associated to TLR signaling (TRAF6, MyD88) (Fig. S2, Table S1). Gene ontology and network analysis of the proteomic data using the Metascape software identified pathways associated with interferon response, cytokine production, viral infection and NF-KB signaling to be significantly altered by famotidine treatment (Fig. S3, a and b). Some proteins were also upregulated in famotidine-treated cells, though from the GO analysis these appear to be unrelated to viral infection (Fig. S3c). These results suggested that though famotidine does not affect viral replication, it may affect the antiviral response in infected cells and production of cytokines. PCR amplification of histamine receptors from cDNA prepared from A549 cells showed that they expressed histamine H1 and H2 receptors and therefore may be used to monitor the on-target effect of histamine and famotidine on H2 receptors (Fig. S4a). Since toll-like receptors are an important arm of innate immune signaling, we decided to check the expression of TLRs in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Caco2 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 for 24 h showed an upregulation of TLR3, TLR4, and TLR7 (Fig. S4b). Treatment of different cell types with histamine has been reported to upregulate expression of toll-like-receptor 3 (TLR3) (27Hou Y.F. Zhou Y.C. Zheng X.X. Wang H.Y. Fu Y.L. Fang Z.M. He S.H.

Liang Y. Yang H. Li L. Modulation of mast cell toll-like receptor 3 expression and cytokines release by histamine.Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2018; 46: 2401-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In A549 cells, treatment with histamine for 12 h caused a modest upregulation of TLR3 and TLR7 mRNA levels (Fig. 3A). Pretreatment of these cells with famotidine reduced TLR3 mRNA levels, but did not affect TLR7 expression (Fig. 3B). To mimic the effect of viral RNA, cells were treated with poly(I:C) for 12 h and expression of TLRs was measured by RT-PCR. Treatment with poly(I:C) upregulated the expression of endosomal TLRs including TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 (Fig. S4c). To mimic a scenario where the virus is present in high concentration of systemic histamine, we pretreated A549 cells with histamine and famotidine and then transfected them with poly(I:C). Pretreatment with histamine led to a significant increase in TLR3 levels, which was greater than that caused by poly(I:C) alone. This cumulative effect of histamine and poly(I:C) could be reversed when famotidine was present in the medium (Fig. 3C). Cell viability was not significantly affected by poly(I:C) treatment or by treatment with 100 μM histamine or 50 μM famotidine when measured with an MTT assay (Fig. S4d). The effect of histamine and poly(I:C) on TLR3 expression was also evident when endogenous TLR3 was immunostained with TLR3 antibody and in cell lysates immunoblotted for TLR3. Cells pretreated with histamine for 12 h prior to poly(I:C) treatment had the highest levels of TLR3, which was again rescued by famotidine treatment (Fig. 3, D and E). The effect of histamine on TLR3 expression is absent in TLR3 siRNA-treated cells (Fig. S4e). These results collectively show that poly(I:C) and histamine increase TLR3 levels, which can be reversed by famotidine. Next we measured the effect of famotidine on TLR3 signaling. Cells were pretreated with histamine alone or in combination with famotidine and then treated with the TLR3 agonist poly(I:C) to activate TLR3-dependent signaling (Fig. 4A). Histamine alone was not enough to trigger TLR3 signaling though it can affect TLR3 expression. Poly(I:C) treatment activated TLR3 signaling causing phosphorylation of TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and a subsequent increase in interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15). Pretreatment with histamine further increases the activation of the TBK1/IRF3 pathway. Famotidine counters this effect leading to a decrease in IRF3 activation and lower ISG15 levels (Fig. 4B). Histamine and poly(I:C) treatment for 12 h increased IFN-β promotor activation, which could be reversed by famotidine (Fig. 4C). A similar effect was also seen on NF-κB(p65) promoter activation after 2 h of poly(I:C) treatment (Fig. 4D). NF-κB activation was also measured in histamine and poly(I:C)-treated cells by measuring nuclear NF-κB(p65) levels by immunofluorescence. Histamine and poly(I:C) caused an increase in the fraction of nuclear p65, which is reduced on famotidine treatment. RT-PCR to detect gene expression of ISG15 and IL8, which are downstream of IRF3 and NF-κB, showed that famotidine could reduce levels of these markers in poly(I:C)-treated cells (Fig. 4F). Taken together, these results indicate that famotidine may affect interferon and inflammatory pathways, which are activated by viral dsRNA downstream of TLR3. Next we evaluated the effect of histamine on TLR3 expression in cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 infected Caco2 cells 24 h postinfection. Expression of TLR2, TLR3, and TLR7 was upregulated while TLR5 was downregulated in virus-infected cells compared with uninfected control (Fig. 5A). Famotidine treatment redu"

https://openalex.org/W3173267119,"In motor neuroscience, state changes are hypothesized to time-lock neural assemblies coordinating complex movements, but evidence for this remains slender. We tested whether a discrete change from more autonomous to coherent spiking underlies skilled movement by imaging cerebellar Purkinje neuron complex spikes in mice making targeted forelimb-reaches. As mice learned the task, millimeter-scale spatiotemporally coherent spiking emerged ipsilateral to the reaching forelimb, and consistent neural synchronization became predictive of kinematic stereotypy. Before reach onset, spiking switched from more disordered to internally time-locked concerted spiking and silence. Optogenetic manipulations of cerebellar feedback to the inferior olive bi-directionally modulated neural synchronization and reaching direction. A simple model explained the reorganization of spiking during reaching as reflecting a discrete bifurcation in olivary network dynamics. These findings argue that to prepare learned movements, olivo-cerebellar circuits enter a self-regulated, synchronized state promoting motor coordination. State changes facilitating behavioral transitions may generalize across neural systems."

Application of s3 to single-cell whole-genome sequencing (s3-WGS) and to whole-genome plus chromatin conformation (s3-GCC) yields 148- and 14.8-fold improvements, respectively, in usable reads per cell compared with sci-DNA-sequencing and sci-HiC.

We expect that the s3 platform will be compatible with other transposase-based techniques, including sci-MET or CUT&Tag."

https://openalex.org/W3175964261,"The NAD+-dependent deacetylase Sirt1 has been implicated in the prevention of many age-related diseases, including cancer, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Resveratrol, a plant polyphenol, exhibits antiaging, antitumor, and vascular protection effects by activating Sirt1. However, the molecular mechanism of Sirt1 activation as induced by resveratrol remains unclear. By knockdown/rescue experiments, fluorometric Sirt1 activity assay, immunoprecipitation, and pull-down assays, we identify here that the tumor suppressor LKB1 (liver kinase B1) as a direct activator of Sirt1 elicited by resveratrol. Resveratrol promotes the binding between LKB1 and Sirt1, which we first reported, and this binding leads to LKB1-mediated phosphorylation of Sirt1 at three different serine residues in the C terminus of Sirt1. Mechanistically, LKB1-mediated phosphorylation increases intramolecular interactions in Sirt1, such as the binding of the C terminus to the deacetylase core domain, thereby eliminating DBC1 (Deleted in Breast Cancer 1, Sirt1 endogenous inhibitor) inhibition and promoting Sirt1-substrate interaction. Functionally, LKB1-dependent Sirt1 activation increases mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration through deacetylation and activation of the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α. These results identify Sirt1 as a context-dependent target of LKB1 and suggest that a resveratrol-stimulated LKB1-Sirt1 pathway plays a vital role in mitochondrial metabolism, a key physiological process that contributes to numerous age-related diseases."

It remains unknown how brain regions interact to maintain persistent activity while exhibiting robustness to corrupt information in parts of the network. We simultaneously measured activity in large neuronal populations across mouse frontal hemispheres to probe interactions between brain regions. Activity across hemispheres was coordinated to maintain coherent short-term memory. Across mice, we uncovered individual variability in the organization of frontal cortical networks. A modular organization was required for the robustness of persistent activity to perturbations: each hemisphere retained persistent activity during perturbations of the other hemisphere, thus preventing local perturbations from spreading. A dynamic gating mechanism allowed hemispheres to coordinate coherent information while gating out corrupt information. Our results show that robust short-term memory is mediated by redundant modular representations across brain regions. Redundant modular representations naturally emerge in neural network models that learned robust dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W3176835866,"Novelty is a core value in science, and a reliable measurement of novelty is crucial. This study proposes a new approach of measuring the novelty of scientific articles based on both citation data and text data. The proposed approach considers an article to be novel if it cites a combination of semantically distant references. To this end, we first assign a word embedding –a vector representation of each vocabulary–to each cited reference on the basis of text information included in the reference. With these vectors, a distance between every pair of references is computed. Finally, the novelty of a focal document is evaluated by summarizing the distances between all references. The approach draws on limited text information (the titles of references) and publicly shared library for word embeddings, which minimizes the requirement of data access and computational cost. We share the code, with which one can compute the novelty score of a document of interest only by having the focal document’s reference list. We validate the proposed measure through three exercises. First, we confirm that word embeddings can be used to quantify semantic distances between documents by comparing with an established bibliometric distance measure. Second, we confirm the criterion-related validity of the proposed novelty measure with self-reported novelty scores collected from a questionnaire survey. Finally, as novelty is known to be correlated with future citation impact, we confirm that the proposed measure can predict future citation."

We report that knockdown of SFPQ expression in melanoma cells decelerates several cancer-associated cell phenotypes, including cell growth, migration, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, apoptosis, and glycolysis. RIP-seq analysis revealed that the SFPQ-RNA interactome is reprogrammed in melanoma cells and specifically enriched with key melanoma-associated coding and long non-coding transcripts, including SOX10, AMIGO2 and LINC00511 and in most cases SFPQ is required for the efficient expression of these genes. Functional analysis of two SFPQ-enriched lncRNA, LINC00511 and LINC01234, demonstrated that these genes independently contribute to the melanoma phenotype and a more detailed analysis of LINC00511 indicated that this occurs in part via modulation of the miR-625-5p/PKM2 axis. Importantly, analysis of a large clinical cohort revealed that elevated expression of SFPQ in primary melanoma tumours may have utility as a prognostic biomarker. Together, these data suggest that SFPQ is an important driver of melanoma, likely due to SFPQ-RNA interactions promoting the expression of numerous oncogenic transcripts."

https://openalex.org/W3181415400,"Optimizing COVID-19 vaccine distribution can help plan around the limited production and distribution of vaccination, particularly in early stages. One of the main criteria for equitable vaccine distribution is predicting the geographic distribution of active virus at the time of vaccination. This research developed sequence-learning models to predict the behavior of the COVID-19 pandemic across the US, based on previously reported information. For this objective, we used two time-series datasets of confirmed COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 effective reproduction numbers from January 22, 2020 to November 26, 2020 for all states in the US. The datasets have 310 time-steps (days) and 50 features (US states). To avoid training the models for all states, we categorized US states on the basis of their similarity to previously reported COVID-19 behavior. For this purpose, we used an unsupervised self-organizing map to categorize all states of the US into four groups on the basis of the similarity of their effective reproduction numbers. After selecting a leading state (the state with earliest outbreaks) in each group, we developed deterministic and stochastic Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Mixture Density Network (MDN) models. We trained the models with data from each leading state to make predictions, then compared the models with a baseline linear regression model. We also remove seasonality and trends from a dataset of non-stationary COVID-19 cases to determine the effects on prediction. We showed that the deterministic LSTM model trained on the COVID-19 effective reproduction numbers outperforms other prediction methods."
https://openalex.org/W3181892255,"The Protein Data Bank (PDB) was established at Brookhaven National Laboratories in 1971 as an archive for biological macromolecular crystal structures. In mid 2021, the database has almost 180,000 structures solved by X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance, cryo-electron microscopy, and other methods. Many proteins have been studied under different conditions, including binding partners such as ligands, nucleic acids, or other proteins; mutations, and post-translational modifications, thus enabling extensive comparative structure-function studies. However, these studies are made more difficult because authors are allowed by the PDB to number the amino acids in each protein sequence in any manner they wish. This results in the same protein being numbered differently in the available PDB entries. For instance, some authors may include N-terminal signal peptides or the N-terminal methionine in the sequence numbering and others may not. In addition to the coordinates, there are many fields that contain structural and functional information regarding specific residues numbered according to the author. Here we provide a webserver and Python3 application that fixes the PDB sequence numbering problem by replacing the author numbering with numbering derived from the corresponding UniProt sequences. We obtain this correspondence from the SIFTS database from PDBe. The server and program can take a list of PDB entries or a list of UniProt identifiers (e.g., ""P04637"" or ""P53_HUMAN"") and provide renumbered files in mmCIF format and the legacy PDB format for both asymmetric unit files and biological assembly files provided by PDBe."

It is important to understand the effects of microplastic particles on the physiological performance of these bivalves and many studies have investigated their impact on various physiological processes. This study investigated the effects of microplastic (10 μm) on digestive enzyme (amylase) activity of Mytilus galloprovincialis at 55,000 and 110,000 microplastic particles/L under laboratory conditions. Additionally, our study measured the expression of an isoform of Hsp70 in the gills to assess whether or not these particles may cause protein denaturation. Results revealed that this regime negatively affect the ability of M. galloprovincialis to digest starch under high food conditions but not low food conditions. Exposure to extreme levels of microplastic raised amylase activity. Furthermore, Hsp70 transcript abundance was not elevated in treatment mussels. These results show that mussels may be resilient to current microplastic pollution levels in nature."
https://openalex.org/W3179411728,"Family 7 glycoside hydrolases (GH7) are among the principal enzymes for cellulose degradation in nature and industrially. These enzymes are often bimodular, including a catalytic domain and carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) attached via a flexible linker, and exhibit an active site that binds cello-oligomers of up to ten glucosyl moieties. GH7 cellulases consist of two major subtypes: cellobiohydrolases (CBH) and endoglucanases (EG). Despite the critical importance of GH7 enzymes, there remain gaps in our understanding of how GH7 sequence and structure relate to function. Here, we employed machine learning to gain data-driven insights into relationships between sequence, structure, and function across the GH7 family. Machine-learning models, trained only on the number of residues in the active-site loops as features, were able to discriminate GH7 CBHs and EGs with up to 99% accuracy, demonstrating that the lengths of loops A4, B2, B3, and B4 strongly correlate with functional subtype across the GH7 family. Classification rules were derived such that specific residues at 42 different sequence positions each predicted the functional subtype with accuracies surpassing 87%. A random forest model trained on residues at 19 positions in the catalytic domain predicted the presence of a CBM with 89.5% accuracy. Our machine learning results recapitulate, as top-performing features, a substantial number of the sequence positions determined by previous experimental studies to play vital roles in GH7 activity. We surmise that the yet-to-be-explored sequence positions among the top-performing features also contribute to GH7 functional variation and may be exploited to understand and manipulate function."

TCGA has recently revealed that a hypoxia gene signature is associated with poor UM patient prognosis. Here we show that expression of hypoxia-regulated collagen prolyl-4-hydroxylase genes P4HA1 and P4HA2 is significantly upregulated in UM patients with metastatic disease and correlates with poor prognosis, suggesting these enzymes might be key tumor drivers. We targeted hypoxia-induced expression of P4HA1/2 in UM with KCN1, a hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) pathway inhibitor and found potent inhibition of primary and metastatic disease and extension of animal survival, without overt side effects. At the molecular level, KCN1 antagonized hypoxia-induced expression of P4HA1 and P4HA2, which regulate collagen maturation and deposition in the extracellular matrix. The treatment decreased prolyl hydroxylation, induced proteolytic cleavage and rendered a disordered structure to collagen VI, the main collagen produced by UM, and reduced UM cell invasion. Together, these data demonstrate that extracellular collagen matrix formation can be targeted in UM by inhibiting hypoxia-induced P4HA1 and P4HA2 expression, warranting further development of this strategy in patients with uveal melanoma."

S . sciuri was the most common species of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) comprising 22.3% of all isolates. Antimicrobial resistance was highest against commonly used antimicrobials, such as penicillin (51.4%), tetracycline (26.1%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (18.6%). These antimicrobials also comprised the most common multidrug resistance (MDR) combination. Overall, 19.1% of isolates displayed multidrug resistance. No methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates were detected. However, methicillin resistance was detected in 13.3% and 15.1% of coagulase-positive staphylococci (CoPS) and the CoNS+CoVS (combined CoNS and coagulase-variable staphylococci) group respectively. The presence of methicillin-resistant staphylococci is worrisome because there is the potential for the transfer of these strains between dogs and humans. These strains may act as a reservoir of resistance genes."

However, detailed knowledge of the contributing factors is incomplete. Here we characterize the role of Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5), in controlling essential pathways of epithelial cell identity and function in the human lung. RNA-seq following siRNA-mediated depletion of KLF5 in the Calu-3 lung epithelial cell line identified significant enrichment of genes encoding chemokines and cytokines involved in the proinflammatory response and also components of the junctional complexes mediating cell adhesion. To determine direct gene targets of KLF5, we defined the cistrome of KLF5 using ChIP-seq in both Calu-3 and 16HBE14o- lung epithelial cell lines. Occupancy site concordance analysis revealed that KLF5 colocalized with the active histone modification H3K27ac and also with binding sites for the transcription factor CCAAT enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPβ). Depletion of KLF5 increased both the expression and secretion of cytokines including IL-1β, a response that was enhanced following exposure to Pseudomonas aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide. Calu-3 cells exhibited faster rates of repair after KLF5 depletion compared with negative controls in wound scratch assays. Similarly, CRISPR-mediated KLF5-null 16HBE14o- cells also showed enhanced wound closure. These data reveal a pivotal role for KLF5 in coordinating epithelial functions relevant to human lung disease."
https://openalex.org/W3176093874,"Ras-association domain family (RASSF) proteins are encoded by numerous tumor suppressor genes that frequently become silenced in human cancers. RASSF10 is downregulated by promoter hypermethylation in cancers and has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation; however, the molecular mechanism(s) remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that RASSF10 inhibits Cdk1/cyclin-B kinase complex formation to maintain stable levels of cyclin-B for inducing mitotic arrest during cell cycle. Using LC-MS/MS, live cell imaging, and biochemical approaches, we identify Nucleophosmin (NPM) as a novel functional target of RASSF10 and revealed that RASSF10 expression promoted the nuclear accumulation of GADD45a and knockdown of either NPM or GADD45a, resulting in impairment of RASSF10-mediated G2/M phase arrest. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RASSF10 is a substrate for the E3 ligase ring finger protein 2 (RNF2) and show that an NPM-dependent downregulation of RNF2 expression is critical to maintain stable RASSF10 levels in cells for efficient mitotic arrest. Interestingly, the Kaplan-Meier plot analysis shows a positive correlation of RASSF10 and NPM expression with greater gastric cancer patient survival and the reverse with expression of RNF2, suggesting that they may have a role in cancer progression. Finally, our findings provide insights into the mode of action of the RASSF10/NPM/RNF2 signaling cascade on controlling cell proliferation and may represent a novel therapeutic avenue for the prevention of gastric cancer metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W3177923884,"Sperm acquire the ability to fertilize in a process called capacitation and undergo hyperactivation, a change in the motility pattern, which depends on Ca2+ transport by CatSper channels. CatSper is essential for fertilization and it is subjected to a complex regulation that is not fully understood. Here, we report that similar to CatSper, Cdc42 distribution in the principal piece is confined to four linear domains and this localization is disrupted in CatSper1-null sperm. Cdc42 inhibition impaired CatSper activity and other Ca2+-dependent downstream events resulting in a severe compromise of the sperm fertilizing potential. We also demonstrate that Cdc42 is essential for CatSper function by modulating cAMP production by soluble adenylate cyclase (sAC), providing a new regulatory mechanism for the stimulation of CatSper by the cAMP-dependent pathway. These results reveal a broad mechanistic insight into the regulation of Ca2+ in mammalian sperm, a matter of critical importance in male infertility as well as in contraception."
https://openalex.org/W3179114317,"The neurotrophin receptors p75 and tyrosine protein kinase receptor A (TrkA) play important roles in the development and survival of the nervous system. Biochemical data suggest that p75 and TrkA reciprocally regulate the activities of each other. For instance, p75 is able to regulate the response of TrkA to lower concentrations of nerve growth factor (NGF), and TrkA promotes shedding of the extracellular domain of p75 by α-secretases in a ligand-dependent manner. The current model suggests that p75 and TrkA are regulated by means of a direct physical interaction; however, the nature of such interaction has been elusive thus far. Here, using NMR in micelles, multiscale molecular dynamics, FRET, and functional studies, we identified and characterized the direct interaction between TrkA and p75 through their respective transmembrane domains (TMDs). Molecular dynamics of p75-TMD mutants suggests that although the interaction between TrkA and p75 TMDs is maintained upon mutation, a specific protein interface is required to facilitate TrkA active homodimerization in the presence of NGF. The same mutations in the TMD protein interface of p75 reduced the activation of TrkA by NGF as well as reducing cell differentiation. In summary, we provide a structural model of the p75-TrkA receptor complex necessary for neuronal development stabilized by TMD interactions."
https://openalex.org/W3174778109,"The present study aims to explore, in the national context of Norway, how municipal socioeconomic indicators affect anxiety and depressive symptom scores among senior high school students and whether this potential municipal effect is dependent on the adolescents’ family affluence levels. This cross-sectional study is based on questionnaire data collected in five waves (2014–2018) of the Ungdata survey. The study sample consisted of 97,460 adolescents aged 16–18 years attending high school in 156 municipalities in Norway. Measures of psychological distress, depression, and anxiety symptoms were based on the screening instrument, Hopkins Symptom Checklist-10. Two-level random intercept models were fitted to distinguish the individual and municipality sources of variation in adolescents’ mental health. In general, the results indicate substantial psychological symptom load among the study sample. Inequalities in adolescents’ psychological distress between family affluence groups were evident, with the lowest symptom loads in the most affluent families. The predicted depressive and anxiety symptoms among the students increased slightly along with the percentage of municipal residents with tertiary educations and with increasing income inequalities in their residential municipality. However, the interaction models suggest that the adverse effects of higher municipal education level and greater income inequality are, to a certain extent, steepest for adolescents with medium family affluence. This study highlights two key findings. Both municipality effects and family affluence account for a relatively small proportion of the total variance in the students’ psychological symptoms loads; however, the mental health inequalities we explored between socioeconomic strata on both the individual and municipal levels are not insignificant in a public health perspective. Results are discussed in the context of psychosocial mechanisms related to social comparison and perceptions of social status that may be applicable in egalitarian welfare states such as Norway."
https://openalex.org/W3178831269,"Cardiac surgery (CS) in pediatric patients induces an overt oxidative stress (OS) response. Children are particularly vulnerable to OS related injury. The immaturity of their organs and antioxidant systems as well as the induction of OS in cardio-pulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery may have an important impact on outcomes. The purpose of this study was to describe the OS response, measured by urinary free 8-iso-PGF2α, in infants undergoing CS and to evaluate the relationship between OS response and post-operative clinical outcomes.Infants with congenital heart disease undergoing CS with or without CPB were eligible for enrollment. Children were classified as neonates (<30 days) or infants (30 days-6 months) based on the age at surgery. Perioperative continuous non-invasive neuromonitoring included amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram and cerebral regional oxygen saturation measured with near-infrared spectroscopy. Urine 8-iso-PGF2α levels were measured before, immediately post-, and 24-hours post-surgery, and the 8-iso-PGF2 clearance was calculated.Sixty-two patients (60% neonates) were included. Urine 8-iso-PGF2α levels 24 hours after surgery (8.04 [6.4-10.3] ng/mg Cr) were higher than pre-operative levels (5.7 [4.65-7.58] ng/mg Cr) (p<0.001). Those patients with a severe degree of cyanosis caused by Transposition of the Great Arteries (TGA) had the highest post-operative 8-iso-PGF2α levels. Patients with intra-operative seizures had higher post-operative 8-iso-PGF2α levels. 8-iso-PGF2α clearance at 24 hours post-surgery was different between newborns and infant patients, and it was inversely correlated with days of mechanical ventilation (p = 0.05), ICU LOS (p = 0.05) and VIS score at 24 hours (p = 0.036).Children undergoing CS, particularly neonatal patients, experience a significant post-operative OS response that might play an important role in postoperative morbidity. TGA patients undergoing arterial switch operations demonstrate the highest post-operative OS response. Rapid clearance of isoprostanes, which occurs more frequently in older patients with more mature antioxidant systems, might be associated with better clinical outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3179951852,"In depositional intertidal coastal systems, primary production is dominated by benthic microalgae (microphytobenthos) inhabiting the mudflats. This benthic productivity is supporting secondary production and supplying important services to humans including food provisioning. Increased frequencies of extreme events in weather (such as heatwaves, storm surges and cloudbursts) are expected to strongly impact the spatiotemporal dynamics of the microphytobenthos and subsequently their contribution to coastal food webs. Within north-western Europe, the years 2018 and 2019 were characterized by record-breaking summer temperatures and accompanying droughts. Field-calibrated satellite data (Sentinel 2) were used to quantify the seasonal dynamics of microphytobenthos biomass and production at an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution during these years. We demonstrate that the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) should be used with caution in depositional coastal intertidal systems, because it may reflect import of remains of allochthonous pelagic productivity rather than local benthic biomass. We show that the reduction in summer biomass of the benthic microalgae cannot be explained by grazing but was most probably due to the high temperatures. The fivefold increase in salinity from January to September 2018, resulting from reduced river run-off during this exceptionally dry year, cannot have been without consequences for the vitality of the microphytobenthos community and its resistance to wind stress and cloud bursts. Comparison to historical information revealed that primary productivity of microphytobenthos may vary at least fivefold due to variations in environmental conditions. Therefore, ongoing changes in environmental conditions and especially extreme events because of climate change will not only lead to changes in spatiotemporal patterns of benthic primary production but also to changes in biodiversity of life under water and ecosystem services including food supply. Satellite MPB data allows for adequate choices in selecting coastal biodiversity conservation and coastal food supply."
https://openalex.org/W3174421621,"Background Although research findings consistently find poor communication about medical procedures to be a key predictor of patient complaints, compensation claims, and malpractice lawsuits (“complaints”), there is insufficient evidence to determine if greater patient involvement could actually affect the inclination to complain. Objectives We conducted an experimental case vignette survey that explores whether greater patient involvement in decision-making is likely to influence the intention to complain given different decisions and consequences. Methods Randomized, national case vignette survey with various levels of patient involvement, decisions, and outcomes in a representative Danish sample of men. We used prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening in men aged 45 to 70 years as the intervention illustrated in 30 different versions of a mock clinical encounter. Versions differed in the amount of patient involvement, the decision made (PSA test or no PSA test), and the clinical outcomes (no cancer detected, detection of treatable cancer, and detection of non-treatable cancer). We measured respondents’ inclination to complain about care in response to the scenarios on a 5-point Likert scale (from 1: very unlikely to 5: very likely). Results The response rate was 30% (6,756 of 22,288). Across all scenarios, the likelihood of complaint increased if the clinical outcome was poor (untreatable cancer). Compared with scenarios that involved shared decision-making (SDM), neutral information, or nudging in favor of screening, the urge to complain increased if the patient was excluded from decision-making or if the doctor had nudged the patient to decline screening (mean Likert differences .12 to .16, p &lt; .001). With neutral involvement or nudging in favor of intervention, the desire to complain depended highly on the decision reached and on the patient’s course. This dependence was smaller with SDM. Conclusions Greater patient involvement in decision-making appears to be associated with less intention to complain about health care, with SDM resulting in the greatest reduction in complaint likelihood."
https://openalex.org/W3176057132,"The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a widespread mechanism of protein delivery into target cells, present in more than a quarter of all sequenced Gram-negative bacteria. The T6SS constitutes an important virulence factor, as it is responsible for targeting effectors in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. The T6SS comprises a tail structure tethered to the cell envelope via a trans-envelope complex. In most T6SS, the membrane complex is anchored to the cell wall by the TagL accessory protein. In this study, we report the first crystal structure of a peptidoglycan-binding domain of TagL. The fold is conserved with members of the OmpA/Pal/MotB family, and more importantly, the peptidoglycan binding site is conserved. This structure further exemplifies how proteins involved in anchoring to the cell wall for different cellular functions rely on an interaction network with peptidoglycan strictly conserved."
https://openalex.org/W3177556629,"We report a new subgroup of Type III Restriction-Modification systems that use m4C methylation for host protection. Recognition specificities for six such systems, each recognizing a novel motif, have been determined using single molecule real-time DNA sequencing. In contrast to all previously characterized Type III systems which modify adenine to m6A, protective methylation of the host genome in these new systems is achieved by the N4-methylation of a cytosine base in one strand of an asymmetric 4 to 6 base pair recognition motif. Type III systems are heterotrimeric enzyme complexes containing a single copy of an ATP-dependent restriction endonuclease-helicase (Res) and a dimeric DNA methyltransferase (Mod). The Type III Mods are beta-class amino-methyltransferases, examples of which form either N6-methyl adenine or N4-methyl cytosine in Type II RM systems. The Type III m4C Mod and Res proteins are diverged, suggesting ancient origin or that m4C modification has arisen from m6A MTases multiple times in diverged lineages. Two of the systems, from thermophilic organisms, required expression of both Mod and Res to efficiently methylate an E. coli host, unlike previous findings that Mod alone is proficient at modification, suggesting that the division of labor between protective methylation and restriction activities is atypical in these systems. Two of the characterized systems, and many homologous putative systems, appear to include a third protein; a conserved putative helicase/ATPase subunit of unknown function and located 5' of the mod gene. The function of this additional ATPase is not yet known, but close homologs co-localize with the typical Mod and Res genes in hundreds of putative Type III systems. Our findings demonstrate a rich diversity within Type III RM systems."
https://openalex.org/W3174834847,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a membrane-bound organelle responsible for protein folding, lipid synthesis, and calcium homeostasis. Maintenance of ER structural integrity is crucial for proper function, but much remains to be learned about the molecular players involved. To identify proteins that support the structure of the ER, we performed a proteomic screen and identified nodal modulator (NOMO), a widely conserved type I transmembrane protein of unknown function, with three nearly identical orthologs specified in the human genome. We found that overexpression of NOMO1 imposes a sheet morphology on the ER, whereas depletion of NOMO1 and its orthologs causes a collapse of ER morphology concomitant with the formation of membrane-delineated holes in the ER network positive for the lysosomal marker lysosomal-associated protein 1. In addition, the levels of key players of autophagy including microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 and autophagy cargo receptor p62/sequestosome 1 strongly increase upon NOMO depletion. In vitro reconstitution of NOMO1 revealed a ""beads on a string"" structure likely representing consecutive immunoglobulin-like domains. Extending NOMO1 by insertion of additional immunoglobulin folds results in a correlative increase in the ER intermembrane distance. Based on these observations and a genetic epistasis analysis including the known ER-shaping proteins Atlastin2 and Climp63, we propose a role for NOMO1 in the functional network of ER-shaping proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3174963716,"Interferon-γ-inducible factor 16 (IFI16) triggers stimulator of interferon (IFN) genes (STING)-dependent type I IFN production during host antiviral immunity and facilitates p53-dependent apoptosis during suppressing tumorigenesis. We have previously reported that STING-mediated IFI16 degradation negatively regulates type I IFN production. However, it is unknown whether STING also suppresses IFI16/p53-dependent apoptosis via degradation of IFI16. Here, our results from flow cytometry apoptosis detection and immunoblot assays show that IFI16 and nutlin-3, a p53 pathway activator, synergistically induce apoptosis in U2OS and A549 cells. Protein kinase R-triggered phosphorylation of p53 at serine 392 is critical for the IFI16-p53-dependent apoptosis. However, overexpression of STING suppresses p53 serine 392 phosphorylation, p53 transcriptional activity, expression of p53 target genes, and p53-dependent mitochondrial depolarization and apoptosis. In summary, our current study demonstrates that STING-mediated IFI16 degradation negatively regulates IFI16-mediated p53-dependent apoptosis in osteosarcoma and non-small cell lung cancer cells, which suggests a protumorigenic role for STING in certain cancer types because of its potent ability to degrade upstream IFI16."

Specifically, the aim of this paper is to understand why, despite their lack of pedagogical and disability training, they are considered to be inclusive faculty members. Objective For this purpose, we analysed the professional characteristics of these academics, their conceptions about disability, what actions they carry out to provide an inclusive response and how they consider that the current situation of university students with disabilities could be improved. Methods Semi-structured individual interviews were used to collect the data. Subsequently, a progressive analysis of the data was performed, using an inductive system of categories and codes. Results and conclusions The results show that these faculty are responsible, involved and committed to their teaching performance. Moreover, they regard reasonable adjustments as a fundamental requirement to handle the different needs of students with disabilities. This paper–which can also be useful for faculty and researchers in other areas of knowledge–comes to the conclusion that training is relevant for becoming an inclusive faculty member. Nevertheless, good will and eagerness to do one’s job properly are even more important aspects."

https://openalex.org/W3181955776,"Iodization of food grade salt has been mandated in Thailand since 1994. Currently, processed food consumption is increasing, triggered by higher income, urbanization, and lifestyle changes, which affects the source of salt and potentially iodized salt among the population. However, adequate information about the use of iodized salt in processed foods in Thailand is still lacking. Therefore, this study aimed to assess iodine intake through salt-containing processed foods and condiments which were identified using national survey data. Potential iodine intake from iodized salt in food products was modelled using consumption data and product salt content from food labelling and laboratory analysis. Fish sauce, soy sauce and seasoning sauces (salty condiments) have alternative regulation allowing for direct iodization of the final product, therefore modelling was conducted including and excluding these products. Daily salt intake from household salt and food industry salt (including salty condiments) was estimated to be 2.4 g for children 0-5 years of age, 4.6 g for children 6-12 years of age, and 11.5 g for adults. The use of iodized salt in processed foods (excluding salty condiments) met approximately 100% of the estimated average requirement (EAR) for iodine for non-pregnant adults and for children 6 to 12 years of age, and 50% of the EAR for iodine for children aged 0 to 5 years of age. In all cases, iodine intake from processed food consumption was greater than from estimated household iodized salt consumption. Findings suggest that iodized salt from processed foods is an important source of iodine intake, especially in adults. The use of iodized salt by the food industry should be enforced along with population monitoring to ensure sustainability of optimal iodine intake. Currently, the addition of iodine into fish sauce, soy sauce and seasoning sauces has an important role in achieving and sustaining optimal iodine intake."

However, their phylogenetic relationships and genetic diversity are poorly understood. Here, we presented the phenotypic traits and genome-wide DNA marker-based analysis of 158 water dropwort accessions representing both species. The analysis revealed that Oenanthe linearis was readily segregated into linear-leaf and deep-cleft leaf water dropworts according to their leaf shapes at flowering. Oenanthe javanica was classified by clustering analysis into two clusters based mainly on the morphological characteristics of their ultimate segments (leaflets). A set of 11 493 high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms was identified and used to construct a phylogenetic tree. There was strong discrimination between O. linearis and O. javanica, which was consistent with their phenotype diversification. The population structure and phylogenetic tree analyses suggested that the O. linearis accessions formed two major groups, corresponding to the linear-leaf and deep-cleft leaf types. The most obvious phenotypic differences between them were fully expressed at the reproductive growth stage. A single-nucleotide polymorphism-based analysis revealed that the O. javanica accessions could be categorized into groups I andII. However, this finding did not entirely align with the clusters revealed by morphological classification. Landraces were clustered into one group along with the remaining wild accessions. Hence, water dropwort domestication was short in duration. The level of genetic diversity for O. linearis (π = 0.1902) was slightly lower than that which was estimated for O. javanica (π = 0.2174). There was a low level of genetic differentiation between O. linearis and O. javanica (Fst = 0.0471). The mean genetic diversity among accessions ranged from 0.1818 for the linear-leaf types to 0.2318 for the groupII accessions. The phenotypic traits and the single-nucleotide polymorphism markers identified here lay empirical foundation for future genomic studies on water dropwort."

Here, we described the design of a genetically engineered ratiometric dual luciferase reporter to continuously quantify the changes in mRNA splice variants in vivo. This reporter system is encoded within a single polypeptide but on separate exons, thus generating two distinct luciferase signals derived from spliced and unspliced mRNAs. With this reporter, the two kinds of luciferase in the same individual can minimize the influence of indirect factors on splicing, and the ratio of these two luciferase intensities represents the dynamic splicing efficiency of pre-mRNA. Our study offers a convenient and robust tool for the screening and identification of small molecules or trans-acting factors that affect the efficiency of specific splicing reactions."
https://openalex.org/W3173646630,"Introduction The pathogenesis of consumptive syndrome of tuberculosis (TB) is largely unknown. Leptin concentrations may be high because of the host’s inflammatory response, contributing to weight loss in patients with TB. The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is also associated with weight loss in patients with TB and is related to enhanced mortality. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between leptin and AGE/RAGE. Methods Case-control study. Leptin, AGE (carboxymethyl lysine, CML) and soluble RAGE (sRAGE) were measured from blood samples by ELISA. Results We included in the study 34 patients with TB and 34 controls. We found an inverse correlation between serum leptin levels and sRAGE, only in cases (r = -0.609, p &lt; 0.0001). sRAGE levels were lower in patients with TB who died as compared with patients who survive (21.90 ± 4.24 pg/mL vs 66.14 ± 29.49 pg/mL; p = 0.045). Leptin levels were higher in patients with TB who died as compared with patients who survive (14.11 [7.48–14.11] ng/mL vs 3.08 [0.54–6.34] ng/mL; p = 0.028). Conclusions We identified lower sRAGE levels and higher leptin levels in patients with TB who died as compared with patients who survive. In addition, an inverse and significant correlation between serum leptin and sRAGE levels was demonstrated. Future studies, with a larger sample size and in different settings, including not only hospitalized patients, are needed to confirm these findings."
https://openalex.org/W3179266504,"The Mediterranean hemopathic syndromes (MHS) are the most prevalent hemoglobinopathies in the Mediterranean basin. Transfusion therapy is the main therapy for these disorders, particularly for severe forms of the disease. Currently, pre-transfusion serological typing of erythrocyte antigens is the standard tool for reducing complications of transfusion in those patients. This study compared genotyping with phenotyping of non-ABO erythrocyte antigens in patients with MHS and assessed the effect of transfusion therapy on their results. One-hundred ninety-eight MHS patients were recruited, screened, and proven negative for allo-antibodies. They were grouped into two groups: (1) 20 newly diagnosed patients with no transfusion history and (2) 178 previously diagnosed patients undergoing transfusion therapy. Patients were interviewed and clinically examined. Full blood count (FBC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were done for group 1 only. Genotyping and phenotyping of non-ABO erythrocyte antigens were performed for group 1, and 25 patients out of group 2 were propensity score-matched (PSM) with group 1. Both groups were gender and age matched; 55% and 74% of groups 1 and 2 had major disease, respectively. Insignificant differences were observed between genotyping and phenotyping of non-ABO erythrocyte antigens in group 1, while significant discrepancies and mixed field results were noted in group 2 patients. Discrepancies were obvious with JKa, JKb, and little c antigens. Conclusively, molecular typing is a powerful tool for pre-transfusion testing in chronically transfused MHS patients. This testing reduces incidence of transfusion reactions. JKa, JKb and little c antigens are the most clinically significant non-ABO erythrocyte antigens."

We evaluated the pattern of angular movement and the mean amplitude of six specific angles. An optoelectronic system was used for 3D kinematic analysis (19 cameras, 250 Hz). They were positioned around the horses and an acquisition volume of 16 × 4.8 × 3 meters was used. Eight retroreflective markers were fixed on the spine of the animals over thoracic vertebrae 8 (T8), 12 (T12), 15 (T15) and 18 (T18); over the lumbar vertebrae 3 (L3) and 5 (L5); over the 1st sacral vertebra (S1); and over the 1st coccygeal vertebra (CD1). Five trials, led from a halter, with three complete gait cycles were evaluated for each marcha batida horse. The 3D coordinates of the markers were filtered with a second-order, low-pass, Butterworth filter (10 Hz). Six angles: T8-T12-T15, T12-T15-T18, T12-T18-L5, T15-T18-L3, T18-L3-L5, and L3-S1-CD1 were obtained and projected in the sagittal (Flexion and Extension) and transverse (Lateral bending) planes. We calculated, for each angle to represent the spine movements, the mean and standard deviation of the range of motion (ROM, difference between the maximum and minimum values in a stride cycle). In order to describe the movement over an average stride cycle we calculated the mean curve of angle variation. The T8-T12-T15 angle presented the largest ROM in the transverse plane, while in the sagittal plane the T8-T12-T15, T12-T15-T18 and T12-T18-L5 angles presented the largest ROMs. The L3-S1-CD1 angle (lumbosacral region) presented the lowest ROM in both planes. A reduced flexion close to a neutral spine was found, predominantly during the diagonal support and in the cranial thoracic region. At the same time, the thoracolumbar region remains in an extension which is highlighted in the lumbosacral region. During the change of the support phase, the cranial thoracic region moved from a flexion to a slight extent, and the thoracolumbar region was flexed which is emphasized in the lumbosacral region. The lateral bending of the spine followed the direction of the diagonal supports. The small amplitude in the latero-lateral and dorsoventral movements of the thoracolumbar spine of MM horses during the marcha batida gait could contribute to the smooth and natural sensations experienced when riding in this gait. The lower mobility of these angles should be considered during the clinical examination of marcha batida-gaited horses."

Circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) especially is used as an analyte in a growing number of diagnostic assays. These assays require specified preanalytical workflows delivering ccfDNA in qualities and quantities that facilitate correct and reliable results. As each step and component used in the preanalytical process has the potential to influence the assay sensitivity and other performance characteristics, it is key to find an unbiased experimental setup to test these factors in diagnostic or research laboratories. We defined one such setup by using blood from healthy subjects and commercially available products for blood collection, spike-in material, ccfDNA isolation, and qPCR assays. As the primary read-out, we calculated the probit model-based LOD95 (limit of detection of the 95 th percentile) from the qPCR assay results. In a proof of principle study we tested two different but widely used blood ccfDNA profile stabilization technologies in blood collection tubes, the Cell-Free DNA BCT and the PAXgene Blood ccfDNA Tube. We tested assays for three different EGFR gene mutations and one BRAF gene mutation. The study design revealed differences in performance between the two tested technologies for all four mutations. In conclusion, we successfully established a blueprint for a test procedure capable of verifying and validating a liquid biopsy workflow from blood collection to the analytical result."
