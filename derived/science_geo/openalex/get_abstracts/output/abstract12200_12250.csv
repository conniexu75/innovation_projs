The effects of these compounds and of 5alpha-cholest-8(14)-en-3beta,15beta-diol, 5alpha-cholest-8(14)-en-3beta,15alpha-diol, 5alpha,14beta-cholest-7-en-3beta,15beta-diol, 5alpha,14beta-cholest-7-en-3beta, 15alpha-diol, 14alpha-methyl-5alpha-cholest-7-en-3beta,15beta-diol, and 14alpha-methyl-5alpha-cholest-7-en-3beta,15alpha-diol on sterol synthesis in L cells and primary cultures of fetal mouse liver cells grown in serum-free media have been studied. With the exception of 3beta-methoxy-5alpha-cholest-7-en-15-one, all of the compounds were found to be potent inhibitors of sterol synthesis. With a few exceptions, the concentrations required to cause a 50% reduction in sterol synthesis were similar to those required to cause a 50% reduction in the level of HMG-CoA reductase activity."

The acetyl group is derived from acetyl-CoA and it is incorporated during translation. Acetylation can be prevented by metabolizing the available acetyl-CoA to citrate with the addition of citrate synthase and oxalacetate to the translation system. The NH2 terminus of ovalbumin synthesized under these conditions can be sequenced by automated Edman degradation. This procedure has also been applied to the sequencing of Pr 76gag, the viral core protein precursor synthesized from 35 S Rous sarcoma virus RNA."

https://openalex.org/W1491526297,"The highly single strand-specific extracellular nuclease of Pseudomonas BAL 31 is shown to cleave non-supercoiled closed circular duplex PM2 bacteriophage DNA containing regions of altered helix structure produced in vitro by irradiation with ultraviolet light or by treatment with the carcinogen, N-acetoxy-N-2-acetylaminofluorene. Untreated samples of this DNA are affected very little by the nuclease. The unwinding of the DNA helix associated with the above treatment renders the closed circular DNA positively supercoiled compared to untreated samples. The extent of unwinding can be accurately measured and correlated with the average number of lesions per molecule of DNA by monitoring the alterations of the electrophoretic patterns, relative to those observed for untreated DNA, of such DNA in agarose gels. Interstrand cross-links and mismatched base pairs produced by treatment of non-supercoilded circular duplex DNA with the mutagen, nitrous acid, do not detectably unwind the DNA helix. The nitrous acid-treated DNA provides substrates for cleavage by the Pseudomonas nuclease which are likely to be the interstrand cross-links rather than the mismatched base pairs. Use of the Pseudomonas nuclease in conjunction with agarose gel electrophoresis can provide a powerful method for the detection of damage in duplex DNA such as that introduced by carcinogenic and mutagenic agents."

https://openalex.org/W1592890866,"The proteins of the small subunit of rat liver ribosomes were separated into five main groups by stepwise elution from carboxymethylcellulose with LiCl at pH 6.5. Twenty-one proteins (Sa, Sc, S3a, S3b, S5', S9, S10, S11, S12, S14, S15, S15', S16, S17, S18, S19, S20, S21, S26, S27', and S29) were isolated from three groups (A40, C40, and D40) by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, and phosphocellulose and by filtration through Sephadex. The amount of protein obtained varied from 0.1 to 11 mg. Six of the proteins (S5', S10, S11, S18, S19, and S27') had no detectable contamination; the impurities in the others were no greater than 9%. The molecular weight of the proteins was estimated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate; the amino acid composition was determined."

https://openalex.org/W1532710110,"We have set out to establish a nomenclature for ribosomal proteins which transcends, as far as is possible, the species from which the ribosomes were isolated. Initally, we identified individual proteins of rat liver by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and comparison with the classification system established by others (Sherton, C.C., and Wool, I.G. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 4460-4467). This was possible with minor modifications. We carried out a detailed comparison of the rat liver proteins with those of chick liver; parallel separate and mixed preparations of ribosomal subunits from the two species were made. Spots on the two-dimensional gels were carefully scrutinized for possible species differences. Proteins which gave congruent spots for the separate and the mixed preparations were tentatively assumed to be identical between the two species. For these proteins, a species-independent nomenclature was adopted. Contrary to earlier reports, a number of proteins were found which were not identical between the two species. These were assigned a species-specific nomenclature. In all, 7 proteins in the small subunit and 17 from the large subunit of the rat liver ribosome were found to be significantly different in the chick. The evolutionary implications of this are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2346848664,"The 5'-terminal sequences of VA-RNA I produced in cells infected with adenovirus 2 were analyzed. The RNA contained a mixture of mono-, di-, and triphosphate ends. The largest part of the RNA has 5'-terminal mono-, di-, or triphosphoguanylic acid, but a portion of the RNA has a 5'-terminal mono-, di-, or triphosphoadenylic acid. An RNA with 5'-terminal adenylic acid was purified and gave the same oligonucleotide map as the major form of VA-RNA I, except for the 5'-terminal products. We therefore conclude that transcription of VA-RNA I can initiate at two different nearby sites."

https://openalex.org/W1513089367,"Our recent determination of the complete antigenic structure of native lysozyme was made possible by our introduction of the surface simulation synthetic concept. The remarkable success afforded by this strategy in the synthetic construction of antigenic sites prompted us to investigate whether it can be applied to mimic antibody-combining sites. Two peptides, designed to be complementary to antigenic sites 2 and 3 of lysozyme, were synthesized and their immunochemistry was studied. Each of the two complementary peptides exhibited an appreciable inhibitory activity towards the reaction of lysozyme with its antisera. Peptide immunoadsorbents bound only lysozyme and not antibody or myoglobin. Neither of the two peptides had any immunochemical activity in the myoglobin or bovine serum albumin immune systems. Furthermore, it was shown that three control synthetic peptides of myoglobin, of similar charge but different sequence, had no inhibitory effect on the lysozyme immune reaction. The evidence indicates that the antibody-combining sites sgainst antigenic sites 2 and 3 of native lysozyme were successfully mimicked synthetically, at least in terms of binding function."

https://openalex.org/W2044752859,"LARGE quantities of seaweeds (kelp) are washed ashore along the coasts of California. Estimates range from 104 to 106 tonnes (107–109 kg) wet weight per yr. These algal masses provide food for insects and other invertebrates on the beaches. The plants carry with them a variety of di-, tri-, and polyvalent cations of heavy metals, largely adsorbed or chelated to superficial acidic polysac-charides and surface slimes of bacterial origin. Among the heavy metals one can detect small amounts of radioactive elements, including some that emit high-energy α particles such as the natural polonium (210Pu, half life 138 d) and the artificial plutonium nuclides (239,240Pu, half lives 24,360 yr and 6,580 yr respectively)1. In surface waters of the oceans, polonium is born from the decay of 210Pb which is continuously replenished by decay of radon released from the Earth's crust. The plutonium isotopes occur in ocean waters as a consequence of fallout from atomic test explosions some 15–20 yr ago. We have examined the extent to which these elements may be transferred from the ocean to the terrestrial biosphere by means of kelp, kelp flies and their predators. Fears have been expressed that radioactivity from the algae could be reaching man through the terrestrial food chain. Our investigations suggest that, on the basis of current radiation thresholds for human healthand safety, such fears are groundless."

https://openalex.org/W86040035,"Excitability-inducing molecule (EIM) is a high molecular weight polymeric protein. It is a channel-forming ionophore which can induce action potential in lipid bilayers and lyse red blood cells. It is also a potent mitogen for mouse B lymphocytes. EIM is produced and secreted into a chemically defined medium during the early growth period by Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 961. It is now 6000-fold purified as compared to the original egg white EIM. Production of the active material requires calcium ion. EIM contains 10 to 20% lipid by weight which is primarily composed of fatty acids, with an unsaturated 18-carbon chain. Amino acid analysis shows 18 common amino acids. The maximum specific activity of 18 common amino acids. The maximum specific activity of EIM is associated with the molecular weight of 3.6 x 10(5)."
