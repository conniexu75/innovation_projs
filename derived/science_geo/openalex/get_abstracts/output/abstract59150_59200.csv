https://openalex.org/W1672352349,"Abstract Cell surface glycoproteins, which have been implicated in the control and expression of cell turnover, differentiation, and malignant transformation in tissue culture studies, were examined for a possible similar role in the intestinal epithelial cell. This cell is characterized by a rapid cell turnover and by a gradient of differentiation from crypt to villus. A method was developed which isolated epithelial cells from different levels of crypt and villus areas and when radioactive labeled d-glucosamine, l-fucose, or d-galactosamine were given intraperitoneally into a rat, a sharp gradient of radioactive incorporation paralleled the specific activity gradients of sucrase and alkaline phosphatase. Isolated epithelial cells incubated with d-[1-14C]glucosamine also showed that the upper villus cells had a much higher incorporation of d-[1-14C]glucosamine than did crypt cells. Subcellular fractionation of the intestinal cells labeled in vivo demonstrated that the highest specific activity was in the purified microvillus plasma membranes and the lowest specific activity was in the microsomal and cytosol fractions. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of microvillus membranes showed peaks of d-[1-14C]glucosamine incorporation which coincided with peaks of sucrase and alkaline phosphatase activities and most of the bands which stained for protein also stained for glycoprotein. Microvillus core proteins separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide did not show peaks of d-[1-14C]glucosamine incorporation and did not stain for glycoprotein. These results suggest that the more differentiated upper villus cells incorporate more labeled sugar precursors into membrane glycoproteins than the less differentiated lower villus or crypt cells and that these membrane glycoproteins are associated with membrane-bound enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W1484322414,"Seventeen peptides have been isolated from a tryptic digest of soluble elastin by ion exchange chromatography and gel filtration. Molecular weights range from approximately 1,700 to 10,500. Partial or complete amino acid sequences of the peptides were obtained and provide the first extensive data on the primary sequence of elastin. Several important findings stand out. First, the sequences obtained reveal an elastin primary structure quite distinct from collagen and possessing repeats of a tetrapeptide, Gly-Gly-Val-Pro, a pentapeptide, Pro-Gly-Val-Gly-Val, and a hexapeptide, Pro-Gly-Val-Gly-Val-Ala. Second, several of the peptides contain a partial hydroxylation of proline residues thereby definitely establishing hydroxyproline as a real constituent of the elastin chain."
https://openalex.org/W1609520994,"Conditions are described for perfusing rat livers in vitro which result in rates of fatty acid synthesis which equal the rates observed in vivo. Rates of 3-β-hydroxysterol synthesis by the perfused liver are equal to or greater than those observed in vivo. Livers from starved animals perfused with low concentrations of glucose show low rates of fatty acid and 3-β-hydroxysterol synthesis. When such livers are perfused with high concentrations of glucose they show a substantial increase in the rate of fatty acid and 3-β-hydroxysterol synthesis. These increases are compared with similar increases in vivo, which are observed when starved animals are refed. Relationships are examined between rates of fatty acid synthesis and the production of lactate, pyruvate, β-hydroxybutyrate, and acetoacetate, as well as the oxygen consumption. Metabolite contents are reported for perfused livers that exhibit high and low rates of fatty acid synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1517765005,"Abstract The pH-dependent transitions and the thermal unfolding of defatted human serum albumin in 0.2 m KCl as followed by polarimetry at 233 nm are found to be independent processes. The apparent net loss of structure (α helix) in the unfolding between pH 7 and 9 is 2.5%, in the N-F transformation it is 8% and in the acid expansion 1%. The two last mentioned transitions seem to be independent of each other. There is a temperature of maximum stability of the N stage in the N-F transformation at 18°. The thermal unfolding and the unfolding by guanidine hydrochloride at pH 2.6 both are continuous processes of apparently low cooperativity with no distinct intermediates. The temperature of maximum stability (Tmax) of human serum albumin is at all pH values below 0°, furthermore it is found to vary continuously with the concentration of guanidine hydrochloride, and in 0.2 m KCl at pH 2.6, Tmax can be extrapolated to -6°. From the transition profiles for thermal denaturation, the three dimensional structure of human serum albumin might be pictured to consist of segments of helical configuration with differential stabilities toward denaturation which impart the ability to unfold simultaneously, but more or less independently."
https://openalex.org/W1544580054,"The cell surface membranes of mitotically active crypt cells from rat intestinal epithelium were found to have glycosyltransferase activities and endogenous acceptors not found on the differentiating villus cells. Rat intestinal epithelial cells were isolated as intact cells from different levels of the villus and crypt areas representing sequential stages of cellular differentiation. Incubation of these cells with UDP-N-acetyl[1-14C]glucosamine, UDP-[U-14C]glucose, UDP-[1-3H]galactose, GDP-[U-14C]mannose, and GDP-[U-14C]fucose demonstrated up to a 10-fold greater incorporation into crypt cells as compared to villus cells. In marked contrast, incubation with CMP-[4,5,6,7,8,9-14C]sialic acid showed that radioactive sialic acid was preferably transferred to villus cell rather than to crypt cell surface. Effective transfer of sugars to exogenous acceptors gave further indication for the presence of galactosyltransferase enzyme activity on crypt cells rather than villus cells, and of sialyltransferase enzyme activity as being predominantly on villus cells. Neither glycosyltransferase activities nor endogenous acceptors were released into the incubation medium. Analysis of labeled endogenous product by dialysis, acid precipitation, differential solvent extraction, graded acid hydrolysis, high voltage electrophoresis, and descending chromatography suggested that most of the label was present as the original monosaccharide derived from the nucleotide sugar, and that it had been incorporated into a membrane-associated glycoprotein. Incubation of human fetal intestinal epithelial cells with UDP-[1-3H]galactose also showed galactosyltransferase enzyme activity to an exogenous as well as an endogenous acceptor. These results suggest that the plasma membrane of the mitotically active undifferentiated crypt cell and the fetal cell both contain (a) active glycosyl-transferase enzymes and (b) acceptor sites which are glycoproteins with incomplete polysaccharide chains."
https://openalex.org/W1513606893,"Abstract Human platelet surfaces were labeled with radioactive iodide utilizing lactoperoxidase and hydrogen peroxide generated by a glucose oxidase-glucose system. Subcellular fractionation and electron microscopic autoradiography revealed that the radioactive label was primarily associated with the external plasma membrane. Sodium dodecyl sulfate acrylamide gel electrophoresis of the solubilized membrane proteins revealed intense labeling of a 100,000 molecular weight membrane glycoprotein which was not altered by thrombin. Several lesser peaks of isotopic labeling were also detected. Neuraminidase treatment of intact platelets significantly decreased the labeling of the major surface glycoprotein. Partial purification of the labeled surface glycoprotein was achieved by extraction from isolated cell membranes with lithium diiodosalicylate. Concanavalin A agglutinated the intact washed platelets and precipitated the isolated membrane glycoprotein. Affinity chromatography using bound concanavalin A was utilized to purify the membrane surface protein."
https://openalex.org/W1489585733,"Abstract A cytosolic thiolase, presumably involved in hepatic cholesterogenesis, has been purified to homogeneity from avian liver. This enzyme is the predominant acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase of chicken liver comprising 70% of the total thiolase activity in laying hens. In addition to the cytosolic enzyme, two mitochondrial species were also detected by isoelectric focusing; the cytosolic species exhibits a pI of 7.1, which is identical with that of the purified enzyme, whereas the mitochondrial species have pI values of 5.9 and 8.3. The cytosolic thiolase has a sedimentation coefficient (s20,w) of 7.94 S and a molecular weight, determined by sedimentation equilibrium, of 169,000. At pH 8.2 and 30°, the native enzyme catalyzes the thiolytic cleavage of 54,000 moles of acetoacetyl-CoA per min per mole of enzyme; under comparable conditions, but with 50 mm Mg2+ added, the rate in the reverse (condensation) direction is 1,770 moles per min per mole of enzyme. Dissociation of the thiolase and electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels gives rise to a single stained protein band whose mobility corresponds to a subunit weight of 41,000 daltons. Thus it appears that the native enzyme is composed of four identical or similar polypeptide chains. The combined actions of purified cytosolic thiolase and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase rapidly converts acetyl-CoA to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA in a thermodynamically favorable manner; equilibrium (at pH 8.0 and 30°) is attained when approximately 68% of the acetyl-CoA added has been converted to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA. Thus, regulation of one or both of these enzymes would appear necessary to prevent depletion of the cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA pool when cholesterogenesis is shut off. Although feeding 2% cholesterol to chickens for 2 to 7 days depresses liver cytosolic thiolase activity by 30 to 54%, this reduction is insufficient to account for the nearly complete cessation of hepatic cholesterogenesis that has been reported under identical conditions of cholesterol feeding (Sakakida, H., Shediac, C. C., and Siperstein, M. D. (1963) J. Clin. Invest. 42, 1521)."
https://openalex.org/W1617487589,"The absorption spectrum of the carbon monoxide complex of ferrous chloroperoxidase from Caldariomyces fumago has been shown to be quite similar to the characteristic spectrum of CO complexes of cytochromes of the P-450 type. Comparison of other spectral properties of chloroperoxidase and cytochrome P-450cam reveals a striking resemblance between the two proteins. The Soret absorption maxima for native, reduced, cyanide, nitrous oxide, and N-phenylimidazole complexes are quite similar. N-Phenylimidazole, a potent inhibitor of the cytochrome P-450cam-catalyzed hydroxylation of camphor, is a very effective inhibitor of a chloroperoxidase-catalyzed peroxidation reaction. Like P-450, chloroperoxidase undergoes characteristic spectral changes in the presence of substrates and nitrogenous compounds. Type I and type II spectral changes have been observed. Carefully controlled denaturation of chloroperoxidase resulted in the formation of a species having a spectrum essentially identical with that of cytochrome P-420, the denatured form of P-450. The spectral similarities described here indicate that both proteins provide quite similar environments for the heme prosthetic group. Both proteins also compare favorably with respect to physical properties such as molecular weight, high content of acidic amino acids, and low isoelectric point."
https://openalex.org/W1517893670,"Abstract A glucosamine-containing monosialosyltetraglycosylceramide was isolated from human plasma, red cells, muscle, brain, and peripheral nerve. This ganglioside was found to be the major ganglioside of peripheral nerve. Treatment of this ganglioside with sialidase from Vibrio cholerae resulted in the formation of tetraglycosylceramide which was also found as a native constituent of the muscle tissue. By sequential hydrolysis with specific glycosidases and methylation analysis, the structure of this ganglioside is proposed to be: NANα2 → 3Galβ1 → 4GlcNAcβ1 → 3Galβ1 → 4Glc → Cer."
https://openalex.org/W1480812528,"Abstract Below pH 5.6, in the presence of endogenous polyphosphates, carp hemoglobin has a very low ligand affinity, and ligand binding is noncooperative, the values of n in the Hill equation being 0.75 and 1.0 for oxygen and carbon monoxide, respectively (Tan, A. L., De Young, A., and Noble, R. W. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 2493–2498). It has been postulated that under these conditions the molecule remains in the low affinity deoxy conformation even when liganded. Raising the pH above 5.6 or removing the organic phosphates converts carp hemoglobin to a molecule that exhibits the usual cooperative ligand binding. Ligand affinity and the degree of cooperativity are phosphate- and pH-dependent. Above pH 8.2 in the presence of organic phosphates and above pH 7.5 in their absence, the ligand-binding properties approach those characteristic of a molecule that again remains in a single conformation, only this time with a high ligand affinity. Whenever ligand binding was cooperative, the rate of CO recombination with partially liganded hemoglobin produced by partial flash photolysis was faster than that with fully unliganded hemoglobin produced by full flash photolysis. Under conditions when the molecule was thought to remain in one structure, the rates of CO recombination upon full and partial flash photolysis were equal. The time course of the conformation change in carp hemoglobin relative to ligand binding has been examined by measuring the rate of release of a fluorescent polyphosphate analogue during CO binding. At low pH there was a marked lag between dye release and CO binding. This lag decreased and was finally reversed with increased pH in agreement with our other results. Kinetic studies of CO combination at wave lengths near the Soret isosbestic point revealed a difference in the rate of CO binding to α and β chains of carp hemoglobin. Although our results for the most part can be explained on the basis of a simple two-state model of hemoglobin, computer fits of the time course of the CO combination reaction could not be achieved with such a simplified scheme, but rather required intra-dimer interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1585999638,"Abstract The significance of mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate formation for gluconeogenesis was evaluated in isolated, perfused livers from rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits. In guinea pig liver, 0.2 mm octanoate decreased by 40 and 30% the rate of gluconeogenesis from lactate and alanine, respectively, but not from pyruvate. In rat liver, gluconeogenesis from all three substrates was increased. The inhibition of gluconeogenesis in guinea pig liver was associated with an increased level of reducing equivalents in the mitochondria as indicated by the NAD+:NADH ratios in freeze-clamped livers before and during infusion of octanoate. Infusion of β-hydroxybutyrate also increased gluconeogenesis from pyruvate and lactate in rat liver but inhibited glucose formation from lactate in guinea pig liver. Low concentrations of the artificial electron acceptor, phenazine methosulfate, reversed the inhibitory effects of excess mitochondrial reducing equivalents. Aminooxyacetate, which inhibits aminotransferases, totally abolished glucose formation from lactate (but not from pyruvate) in perfused rat liver but reduced gluconeogenesis by only 50 to 60% in guinea pig liver. This inhibition was further increased by β-hydroxybutyrate infusion. In livers from fed rabbits, aminooxyacetate had no effect, but in livers from fasted rabbits in which the activity of cytosolic P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase is induced, the inhibition by aminooxyacetate was quantitatively similar to that in the guinea pig liver. The data show that in the guinea pig and rabbit liver both the cytosolic and mitochondrial forms of P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase actively function during gluconeogenesis from lactate and alanine. The gluconeogenic flux via the mitochondrial enzyme accounts for at least one-half of the over-all rate of glucose formation from lactate. It is concluded that the regulation of gluconeogenesis in species containing a mitochondrial activity of P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase is significantly different from that operating in rat liver and reflect to a large extent the compartmentation of P-enol-pyruvate carboxykinase."
https://openalex.org/W1489581443,"Abstract Fatty acids immobilized on agarose have been employed in the isolation and study of serum albumin by affinity chromatography. Various oleyl- and palmityl-aminoalkyl-amino-agarose preparations bound about 10 mg of albumin per ml of agarose; other proteins were retained in smaller amounts and with lesser affinity. Fatty acid-agarose columns which had been exposed to human serum and then washed yielded essentially pure albumin upon elution with 50% alcohol at pH 3. Lengthening the aminoalkylamino arm from 2 to 10 carbon atoms had little effect on the capacity for albumin, but increased the binding of other serum proteins. That the albumin binding was caused by the immobilized fatty acids was shown by the use of control preparations without fatty acids, by the inverse relation of albumin binding to the fatty acid content of the albumin, and by the ability to elute albumin from the agarose with solutions of sodium oleate. Efforts were made to isolate fatty acid binding regions of the bovine albumin molecule after tryptic digestion of albumin which was bound to fatty acid-agarose. Two peptides with molecular weight of about 10,000 and 23,000 were obtained which were resistant to further digestion; the larger of these was purified and its amino acid composition determined. This tryptic peptide lacked cysteine and tryptophan, and apparently arises from the carboxyl-terminal portion of the albumin molecule. Some implications on the properties of the fatty acid-binding sites on albumin have been offered."
https://openalex.org/W1533334446,"Abstract Previous work has shown that physiological amounts of cortisol added to rat thymus cells in vitro begin to inhibit glucose transport (as measured by the accumulation of glucose 6-phosphate during a 5-min glucose pulse) by 15 to 20 min; the effect of cortisol is blocked by actinomycin D present from 0 to 5 min, suggesting a rapid stimulation by cortisol of RNA synthesis. It is now shown that during the period from 15 to 30 min, but not prior to 15 min, the hormone effect is blocked by cycloheximide or puromycin. The coincidence in time of sensitivity to these inhibitors of protein synthesis with the development of inhibition of glucose transport, together with our earlier results, has led us to postulate that the hormone effect is expressed through induction of a protein that rapidly inhibits glucose transport. The preceding RNA-synthetic step possibly represents synthesis of mRNA for this protein. The previously demonstrated temperature-sensitive step is shown to lie between the RNA- and protein-synthetic steps. It perhaps corresponds to transfer of mRNA from nucleus to cytoplasm. Decay rates of the hypothetical cortisol-induced RNA and protein have been measured following removal of hormone from specific binding sites or addition of inhibitors of RNA or protein synthesis. The protein appears to have a life span of not more than 2 hours at 37°, while the RNA has a life span of less than 40 min."
https://openalex.org/W1499335751,"The partial purification (6-fold) and properties of a position and substrate specific acyl coenzyme A:sn-glycerol-3-P acyltransferase from rat liver mitochondria are described. The preparation is devoid of acyl-CoA:monoacylglycerol-3-P acyltransferase and lipid phosphomonoesterase activity. All of the glycerol-3-P acylated in the presence of palmityl-CoA is identified as 1-palmityl-sn-glycerol-3-P. The order of effectiveness of various acyl-CoA donors is palmityl > stearyl ≃ myristyl > decanyl-CoA. Oleyl- and linoleyl-CoA were about 5% as effective as palmityl-CoA. Palmitic acid was esterified exclusively in position 1 of the sn-glycerol molecule. The activity is stimulated by phosphatidyl serine, asolectin, and lecithin, whereas cardiolipin, lysophosphatidic acid, and phosphatidic acid were inhibitory. Mg++, Ca++, Mn++, and to a lesser extent Co++ enhance the activity. The findings demonstrate that the acylation of sn-glycerol-3-P involves an enzyme activity separate from that which acylates 1-palmityl-sn-glycerol-3-P. The enzyme preparation offers a convenient and efficient method for the preparation of 1-palmityl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1580740575,"Abstract The aldehyde oxidases from rabbit and hog livers have been purified to homogeneity by modifications of and additions to previously published procedures. The final preparations were judged to be homogeneous on the basis of ultracentrifugal, electrophoretic, chromatographic, spectral, and kinetic criteria. A number of physical and kinetic properties of the homogeneous enzymes have been determined. The homogeneous enzymes have been shown to catalyze the oxidation of N1-methylnicotinamide to both N1-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide and N1-methyl-4-pyridone-3-carboxamide in a ratio (2-pyridone to the 4-pyridone) of 100 for the rabbit enzyme and 3.8 for the hog enzyme. The ratios of products formed by these enzymes at each step in their purifications were constant. The ratios of the pyridone products obtained on the oxidation of several N1-substituted analogues of N1-methylnicotinamide by these aldehyde oxidases have been found to shift in favor of the 4-pyridone as the bulk of the N1-substituent was increased. A general mechanism of action of aldehyde oxidases is proposed which accounts for the different pyridone ratios and the unique kinetic properties associated with the different forms of the enzyme which have been found in a number of different mammalian livers."

Reaction of Factor Xa with p-nitrophenyl-p'-guanidinobenzoate occurs at the site which is responsible for the clotting activity of Factor Xa.

https://openalex.org/W1576522583,"Abstract A particulate enzyme fraction from cotton fibers catalyzes the incorporation of mannose from GDP-[14C]mannose and glucose from UDP-[14C]glucose into acidic lipids. Both of these lipids are retained on DEAE-cellulose and both have mobilities on Silica Gel G in three solvent systems (neutral, basic, and acidic) similar to the mannosyl-1-phosphoryl undecaprenol isolated from micrococci. The sugar moieties of both lipids are very labile to acid hydrolysis and are released in a few minutes in 0.001 to 0.003 n HCl at 100°. Synthesis of the mannolipid is reversed by GDP, while synthesis of the glucolipid is reversed by UDP. Purified [14C]mannolipid incubated with membrane preparations in the presence of GDP gives rise to GDP-[14C]mannose. Similarly [14C]glucolipid in the presence of UDP results in formation of UDP-[14C]glucose. The enzyme preparation was treated with acetone to remove endogenous lipids. This enzyme fraction was inactive in catalyzing mannolipid formation in the absence of added lipid An active lipid fraction was isolated from cotton fibers by extraction with chloroform-methanol and was purified on DEAE-cellulose. The active component has an Rf similar to that reported for ficaprenyl phosphate. Synthetic ficaprenyl phosphate was very effective in replacing the requirement for the active cotton lipid acceptor. The product formed from GDP-[14C]mannose and ficaprenyl phosphate was similar to that formed from GDP-[14C]mannose and endogenous lipids. Various properties of the mannosyltransferase were examined. The enzyme required Mg++ with an optimum concentration being 1.5 x 10-2 m. The Km for GDP-[14C]mannose was estimated to be 6.7 x 10-7 m and the pH optimum in Tris buffer was 7.5. The apparent Km for ficaprenyl phosphate was about 2 to 4 x 10-5 m. Mannolipid, previously characterized as mannosyl-1-phosphoryl undecaprenol (9), was synthesized by extracts of Mycobacterium smegmatis from GDP-[14C]mannose. This purified lipid as well as the purified mannolipid from cotton gave rise to GDP-[14C]mannose when incubated with the particulate enzyme from M. smegmatis. Although GDP-mannose formation was not absolutely dependent on the addition of GDP probably because the particulate enzyme contains this endogenous nucleotide, GDP did stimulate GDP-mannose synthesis. Likewise, both mannolipids were incubated with the particulate enzyme from cotton fibers. In this experiment, GDP-[14C]mannose was formed from both lipids but only in the presence of added GDP. The cotton lipid was three to five times as active in this system. These experiments indicate that the lipid moiety of the cotton glycolipids is a polyprenol but probably differs somewhat from that of mycobacteria. To determine which sugars might be present in acidic lipids of intact cotton bolls, 250 bolls were extracted with chloroform-methanol and the acidic lipids purified on DEAE-cellulose. Sugars were released by mild acid hydrolysis, reduced with NaBH4, converted to their acetate derivatives, and analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography. The major sugars detected were glucose and mannose but significant amounts of arabinose and galactose were also observed as well as three as yet unidentified peaks."
https://openalex.org/W1591633529,"Abstract The renaturation of guanidinium chloride-denatured aldolase in buffer containing 20% sucrose at 0° can be resolved into two distinct processes by following the regain of activity. Initially, an active intermediate is formed which is unstable to treatment with 2.3 m urea. This intermediate is then converted into another active species which is stable to 2.3 m urea. Analysis of the kinetic data shows that the over-all process of reactivation is independent of the concentration of enzyme in the renaturation mixture whereas the rate of formation of 2.3 m urea-stable activity is highly concentration-dependent. The results are consistent with a model in which denatured aldolase refolds in a first order reaction to give active monomers which then associate in concentration-dependent steps to give active dimer, trimer, and tetramer. In this model, the activity of each subunit is the same whether it exists singly or as part of an oligomer. However, only the tetramer is stable to 2.3 m urea. This model is also supported by gel filtration studies of partially renatured aldolase. The results support our earlier observation based on matrix-bound aldolase subunits (Chan, W. W.-C. (1970) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 41, 1198) that aldolase subunits are active but differ from the tetramer in being unstable toward 2.3 m urea."
https://openalex.org/W1571748638,"Abstract A partially purified enzyme from Vinca rosea was shown to catalyze the transfer of the methyl group of S-adenosyl-l-methionine to loganic acid forming loganin, an intermediate in the biosynthesis of indole alkaloids of this plant. Cell-free extracts, prepared in the presence of polyvinyl pyrrolidone, Na2S2O5, and dithiothreitol (DTT), were subjected to acetone precipitation, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and DEAE-cellulose column chromatography. In assays with such preparations, DTT enhanced methyltransferase activity in contrast to mercaptoethanol, reduced glutathione, or cysteine. A combination of NADPH and FAD could partially replace DTT with the crude cell-free extract. Additional evidence for an active role of reduced sulfhydryl groups of the enzyme was obtained by inhibition studies with p-chloromercuribenzoate, iodoacetamide, and N-methylmaleimide. A divalent metal cation dependency was not detected. The apparent Km for loganic acid was 12.5 mm. Substrate specificity studies revealed that the rates of methylation of loganic and secologanic acids were comparable. Under the same assay conditions no significant methylation of 7-deoxyloganic, 7-epiloganic, or geniposidic acids was observed. Since the occurrence and biosynthesis of loganic and secologanic acids have also been demonstrated in V. rosea, both acids are thus implicated in the biosynthesis of the indole alkaloids."

https://openalex.org/W1504645688,"Abstract The existence of a circadian rhythm of activity of the hepatic microsomal enzyme, β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, EC 1.1.1.34), is well established. This rhythm was abolished after adrenalectomy; the resulting reductase activity was low and essentially constant at a level approximating that of intact rats killed at the nadir of their rhythm (i.e. noon). Adrenalectomized and intact rats consumed similar amounts of food daily and exhibited approximately the same cyclical pattern of eating. Hypophysectomy resulted in even lower reductase levels than adrenalectomy, and no circadian rhythm of reductase activity was found. Hypophysectomized rats consumed less food, and their cyclical pattern of eating was less evident than that of adrenalectomized or intact rats. The microsomes from normal and adrenalectomized rats gave no evidence of any significant changes in the kinetic properties (Km, pH optimum, and half-life of degradation) of β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase. Replacement of adrenal hormones in adrenalectomized rats with single large doses of cortisone, cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, or epinephrine plus cortisone resulted in little or no increase in reductase activity. However, intact rats, treated with epinephrine (0.05 mg/100 g body weight) did show an increase of 2- to 4-fold in reductase activity. This response appeared to require protein synthesis since it was blocked by cycloheximide. The available evidence suggests that intact functioning adrenal glands are necessary for the normal circadian rhythm of β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase to occur, but does not indicate which hormone or hormones are involved, nor does it indicate whether such hormone (or hormones) play a direct or a permissive role."
https://openalex.org/W1670189252,"Abstract The fatty acid synthetase from Mycobacterium phlei has been purified 340-fold to homogeneity. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 1.39 x 106. At low concentrations of phosphate buffer (0.005 m), the synthetase dissociates into an enzymatically inactive species (7.65 S) which can be partially reaggregated and reactivated by dialysis against 0.5 m potassium phosphate buffer. The mycobacterial polysaccharides, 3-O-methylmannose-containing polysaccharide (MMP) and 6-O-methylglucose-containing polysaccharide (MGLP), stimulate the fatty acid synthetase markedly. Their presence lowers the Km values for acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA 9-fold and 4-fold, respectively. The polysaccharides also appear to function by altering the rate-limiting step of fatty acid synthesis. MMP stimulates fatty acid synthesis more effectively than MGLP. Various chemical modifications of the polysaccharides do not markedly alter their stimulating activity. Acetyl-CoA is the most effective primer and its concentration affects the degree to which MMP and MGLP stimulate fatty acid synthesis. It is proposed that the polysaccharides function primarily by binding long chain acyl-CoA and thereby relieve product inhibition of the fatty acid synthetase."
https://openalex.org/W1524332200,"Abstract Radioactively labeled proα1 chains, obtained by culture of embryonic chick cranial bones in the presence of [35S]cysteine, were cleaved with cyanogen bromide. A 35S-containing peptide was isolated and purified by agarose and DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Its molecular weight, determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate acrylamide gel electrophoresis, was approximately 20,000. Labeling experiments with [3H]tryptophan revealed that the peptide also contained tryptophan. Comparison of the amino acid composition and molecular weights of purified proα1 and α1 chains indicated that the CNBr peptide contained the great majority of the additional sequence present in the precursor proα1 chain. The amino acid composition of this sequence clearly precludes its existence in a triple helical conformation."

https://openalex.org/W1552250658,"Abstract 80 S ribosomes and elongation factors 1 and 2 (EF-1 and EF-2), isolated from freeze-dried porcine brain of the hypothalamic region, were used to study the interrelation between the ribosomal binding of the two factors and of phenylalanyltRNA and N-acetyl-phenylalanyl-tRNA. Complexing of ribosomes with EF-2 + β, γ-methylene-guanosine 5'-triphosphate or EF-2 + GTP + fusidic acid prevented or inhibited EF-1-dependent binding of phenylalanyl-tRNA as well as EF-1-independent binding at 20 mm Mg2+. On the other hand, when ribosomes were preincubated with EF-1, GTP, and phenylalanyl-tRNA, EF-2-dependent GDP binding became inhibited. Furthermore, ribosomes nonenzymatically charged with phenylalanyl-tRNA or N-acetyl-phenylalanyl-tRNA, presumably in the acceptor position, likewise did not accept EF-2 and GDP. These results indicate that EF-1 and EF-2 have an overlapping region on 80 S ribosomes that includes the acceptor site for nonenzymatic binding of phenylalanyl-tRNA or N-acetyl-phenylalanyl-tRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1549769981,"Abstract The dissociation constant for the tetramer-dimer equilibrium of unliganded hemoglobin (Ku4,2) has been measured under a variety of solvent conditions by means of the carbon monoxide-binding technique described in the first paper in this series. Under standard conditions (0.1 m phosphate, pH 7.0) the dissociation equilibrium is characterized by the constant Ku4,2 = 3 x 10-12 m. Experiments in 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 m NaCl indicate a continuous enhancement of dissociation by the salt to give values for Ku4,2 of 9 x 10-12 m, 18 x 10-12 m, and 65 x 10-12 m, respectively. The value of Ku4,2 also increases with pH in roughly the manner expected from considerations of the Bohr effect of hemoglobin. In contrast, dioxane up to 2 m has a slight stabilizing effect on the unliganded tetramer. These results are interpreted in terms of the salt bridges postulated to play a major role in the stability of unliganded hemoglobin tetramers and the cooperative interactions between hemoglobin and its ligands."
https://openalex.org/W1509240894,"Abstract The incorporation of carbohydrates has been studied in vitro in the experimental rat thyroid tumor 1-1C2. The uptake of N-[3H]acetylmannosamine, a precursor of sialic acid, is less than 5% of that in normal thyroid gland; no label is found in 19 S thyroglobulin or its precursors either in the soluble or in the solubilized proteins. N-[3H]Acetylglucosamine is incorporated at a slower rate than in normal thyroid gland and is present in the membrane-bound thyroglobulin; there is no conversion into sialic acid in the soluble thyroglobulin of tumor as occurs in normal thyroid. [14C]Mannose and [14C]galactose are incorporated at an almost normal rate and [14C]fucose, at a subnormal rate; they are present mainly in the particle-bound proteins as ∼18 S thyroglobulin and its precursors. Measurement of sialyltransferase activity showed that, with desialylated thyroglobulin as acceptor, the 22,000–105,000 x g pellet of tumor contains ∼3% of normal sialyltransferase activity, and the soluble fraction contains ∼25% of normal activity. Desialylated fetuin and orosomucoid are generally better acceptors than desialylated thyroglobulin for tumor sialyltransferase. The findings indicate that defective thyroglobulin release and absence of incorporation of sialic acid into thyroglobulin coexist in this tumor. The very low activity of thyroglobulin-specific sialyltransferase activity in the tumor particulate fraction accounts for the failure of sialic acid incorporation into thyroglobulin and may explain the defect in thyroglobulin release."
https://openalex.org/W1518884055,"Abstract Quantitative studies were made on the association of hemoglobin from the lamprey, Entosphenus japonicus, in a wide range of concentrations (0.01 to 3.4 mm) and pH values (5.6 to 8.0) with the aids of sedimentation equilibrium, sedimentation velocity, and diffusion measurements. Oxygen equilibrium was determined also in a wide range of concentrations by colorimetry and manometry. Molecular weights of the monomer and the largest aggregate were calculated to be 17,300 and 67,300, respectively, which correspond to that of the subunit of human hemoglobin and that of tetrameric human hemoglobin, respectively. The data of the sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium were computer analyzed assuming the rapid equilibrium of the monomer-dimer-tetramer, and the association constants for both deoxygenated and oxygenated lamprey hemoglobin were obtained. The association-dissociation equilibrium was dependent on pH. For the deoxygenated hemoglobin, the maximum value of 8.1 x 104 m-1 for K2, the constant for the monomer-dimer equilibrium, and 6.5 x 103 m-1 for K4, the constant for the dimer-tetramer equilibrium, were obtained at pH 5.9, and the values of both association constants decreased at higher pH. The association constants for oxyhemoglobin were much smaller than those for deoxyhemoglobin. The fractions of the dimers and tetramers, calculated for the lamprey deoxygenated hemoglobin under the physiological conditions in red cells, were 10% and 85%, respectively, and those for oxyhemoglobin were 36% and 15%, respectively. In the oxygen equilibrium of lamprey hemoglobin, it was shown that the oxygen partial pressure at half-saturation, p½ increased with increasing concentrations of hemoglobin, namely from 5 mm Hg at 2 µm to 350 mm Hg at 7.5 mm at pH 5.9, and that the heme-heme interaction constant, n, increased from 1.1 at very low concentration of hemoglobin to 1.6 at 0.6 mm, and then decreased to 1.0 at 7.5 mm. An assumption was made that monomers and tetramers each have a different constant affinity for oxygen which we determined experimentally from the oxygen equilibrium at a very low concentration and a very high concentration of hemoglobin, respectively. Oxygen equilibrium curves for lamprey hemoglobin were calculated from these two oxygen equilibrium constants and the association-dissociation constants determined both for deoxyhemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin. The results agreed well with those obtained experimentally, and the model was shown to be able to account for the characteristic oxygen binding properties of lamprey hemoglobin, namely heme-heme interaction, oxygen affinity, and the Bohr effect."
https://openalex.org/W2056570804,"A MEASUREMENT of the lateral diffusion coefficient of spin labels in lecithin bilayers has been reported by McConnell et al.1. This diffusion is found to be rapid, the consequences of which, in terms of the structure of biological membranes, cannot be overlooked. Here we report the result of nuclear magnetic resonance measurements on the diffusion coefficient in the concentrated phases of the potassium laurate–heavy water system. Our results strengthen the theory that diffusion in lipid water systems is rapid, magnetic resonance measurements have the advantage that it is the diffusion of the constituent molecule itself that is being observed and not the diffusion of an added “impurity” as is the case with spin fabel experiments."

https://openalex.org/W1528299755,"Abstract Apparent equilibrium constants of many biochemical reactions are influenced by metal ions. Quantitative prediction of this effect, which is due to complex formation between metal ion and equilibrating species, requires knowledge of the relevant metal-ligand stability constants. The inconsistency of the published values for some such constants is notorious, and methods for their determination often cannot be applied under conditions close to those in the living cell. This paper proposes an enzymatic method for the determination of metal-ligand stability constants at constant pH, based on observations of apparent equilibria over a range of metal ion concentrations. A nonlinear least squares data fitting program is developed which extracts from these observations the set of stability constants, with standard errors, which best predicts the observations. The method is applied to the determination of stability constants for MgATP, MgADP, and MgAMP in 0.46 m tetrabutylammonium chloride at pH 7.25, using the myokinase equilibrium. Subject to a few constraints, extension of this data fitting procedure to other equilibria is straightforward."

https://openalex.org/W1585899088,"Abstract Aspartokinase of Bacillus polymyxa is composed of equimolar amounts of two types of polypeptide chain, α and β, with molecular weights of about 43,000 and 17,000, respectively. Analysis of the products formed after partial crosslinking with dimethyl suberimidate supports a structure of the type α2β2 and suggests a subunit arrangement defined by only two different bonding domains, one of the type α—α and one of the type α—β, with no interaction between the β subunits. The enzyme can be reversibly dissociated by treatment with 4 m urea, and the α and β chains have been separated by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200 in the presence of the denaturant. Upon removal of urea, the α subunit aggregates to a series of even-numbered oligomers, the β subunit forms dimers, whereas mixtures give rise to the tetramer α2β2. This pattern of aggregation is consistent with the postulated subunit arrangement. Renatured preparations of α subunit regain a low level (20%) of aspartokinase activity which is uniformly associated with all oligomeric forms and whose catalytic and allosteric properties are indistinguishable from those of native aspartokinase. This implies that the catalytic center as well as the three types of allosteric sites (for l-threonine, l-lysine, and nonpolar l-amino acids) all reside on the α subunit, and that the conformation of the α dimer is not constrained by association with itself or with β subunit. When α subunit is renatured in the presence of β subunit, a higher level (60%) of aspartokinase activity is recovered. The stimulation of reactivation is a hyperbolic function of the square of the relative β concentration and requires the presence of β subunit during the refolding process. These results suggest that the β subunit of aspartokinase does not participate in catalysis, regulation, or maintenance of structure, but rather that it may function during the folding or maturation of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1568950333,"Abstract Rat liver microsomes are capable of catalyzing the acylation of 1-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoryl-rac-glycerol for phosphatidylglycerol formation. The requirements for the reaction appear to be the same as the analogous reaction for lecithin synthesis. In contrast, however, to oleoyl-CoA:1-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine acyltransferase, which has a pH optimum of 7.0, oleoyl-CoA:1-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoryl-rac-glycerol acyltransferase functions optimally at pH 9.0. The latter is also distinguishable by being more stable at the alkaline pH than the former. The data indicate that in addition to positional specificity and acyl group preferability, acyl-CoA:acyl glycerophospholipid acyltransferases also possess phosphorylalcohol group specificity."

https://openalex.org/W1515277766,"Abstract Isolated perfused livers of fasted Sprague-Dawley rats produce glucose in linear fashion from pyruvate, l-lactate, l-alanine, glycerol, and d-fructose over a period of hours. Even-numbered, straight chain fatty acids enhance gluconeogenesis from l-lactate, pyruvate, and l-alanine by 25 to 35%, whereas gluconeogenesis from glycerol (20%) and d-fructose (10%) is inhibited. ω-Phenyl-substituted fatty acids inhibit glucose synthesis from l-lactate, pyruvate, and l-alanine to a progressively greater extent with increasing fatty acid chain lengths. Even-numbered, straight chain, unsubstituted fatty acids overcome these inhibitions, whereas ethanol does not. The rates of glucose synthesis from glycerol and d-fructose are inhibited to the same extent by ω-phenylalkanoic acids of different chain lengths. A fairly constant degree of inhibition of gluconeogenesis from these two substrates is also exhibited by even-numbered, straight chain, unsubstituted fatty acids but not their carnitine derivatives. The duration of action of the various inhibitors depends on their β-oxidation to benzoyl-CoA and phenylacetyl-CoA and the liberation of free CoA."
https://openalex.org/W1480635434,"Abstract A model is presented which is able to describe satisfactorily the increase of the alkaline and acid Bohr effect due to the binding by human hemoglobin of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. From an analysis of this extra Bohr effect it could be concluded that the histidines H21(143)β are very probably responsible for the increase in alkaline Bohr effect. The second ionization of the phosphate groups of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate is responsible for the increase in acid Bohr effect. For Kd the pH-independent part of the apparent association constant of the deoxyhemoglobin-diphosphoglycerate complex, we estimated a value of 8 x 105 m-1 at 25° and an ionic strength of 0.1. It appeared further that the binding of diphosphoglycerate by oxyhemoglobin is under these experimental conditions negligible as compared with the binding to deoxyhemoglobin. From binding experiments on deoxyhemoglobin with diphosphoglycerate at 4° and at an ionic strength of 0.1 a value for Kd of (6.5 ± 1.5) x 105 m-1 could be estimated. Measurements of the rate of reaction of 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene with the α-NH2 groups of deoxyhemoglobin showed that in the presence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate the reactivity of the α-NH2 group of the β chain was strongly depressed."
https://openalex.org/W1484423795,"Abstract The postulated fragmentation of RNase by N-acetoxy-2-fluorenylacetamide (N-acetoxy-2-FAA), an activated metabolite of the carcinogen, N-hydroxy-2-fluorenylacetamide, has been investigated. The interaction of N-acetoxy-2-FAA with RNase resulted in the formation of two new proteins separable from RNase by electrophoresis and ion exchange chromatography. These proteins contained no new NH2-terminal amino acids, and their amino acid composition was identical with that of native RNase, indicating that the protein had not been modified by cleavage of the peptide chain. The alternative possibility that the formation of the additional proteins was due to a decrease in the positive charge of RNase was examined by the determination of the incorporation of 3H and 14C from N-[3H]acetoxy-[9-14C]2-FAA into RNase. The ratio of bound 3H to bound 14C, which measures the relative extent of acetylation and arylamidation in the modified proteins, suggested that acetylation rather than arylamidation was the predominant reaction modifying RNase. The conclusion that the acetyl group of N-[3H]-acetoxy-[9-14C]2-FAA had been transferred to RNase was confirmed (a) by the recovery of [3H]acetic acid from the hydrolysates of the modified protein and (b) by the isolation of e-N-acetyl-l-lysine from enzymatic hydrolysates of the modified protein. The isolation of the N-acetylated amino acid accounted in part for the decrease in the positive charge of RNase after reaction with N-acetoxy-2-FAA. The results indicate that N-acetoxy-2-FAA is an acetyl donor and modifies proteins primarily by acetylation rather than arylamidation."

https://openalex.org/W1573762091,"Abstract RNA made in vitro on a T5 phage DNA template was partially digested with ribonuclease T1 and fractionated according to chain length. The oligoribonucleotides of various chain lengths were tested for their annealing at different temperatures to denatured DNAs immobilized on membrane filters. As observed before for the T-even and other T-odd phage DNAs, a chain length of 10 or more ribonucleotides is required to form a ribonuclease-resistant complex with denatured T5 DNA in the absence of Mg2+. The shortest oligoribonucleotides capable of forming a complex with denatured T5 DNA display a high degree of specificity for species: these oligoribonucleotides do not anneal to either T2 or T7 DNA. As expected, the temperature for optimum complex formation and the melting temperature of the oligoribonucleotide-denatured DNA complex increase with the chain length of the oligoribonucleotide. With increasing chain length, the average base composition increasingly reflects the base composition of the parent RNAs. For the same chain length, T5-produced oligoribonucleotides having a G+C content intermediate between those of T2- and T7-produced oligoribonucleotides form complexes having stabilities intermediate between those of the latter. There are linear relationships between the melting temperatures and the G+C contents for oligoribonucleotides of a defined chain length. This makes it possible to characterize oligoribonucleotide-denatured DNA complexes as a function of both the chain length and the base composition of the oligoribonucleotide."
https://openalex.org/W1558613913,"Abstract The effect of formaldehyde and inorganic salts such as NaCl, NaBr, NaClO4, LiBr, LiClO4, and MgCl2 on the stability of N4 virus and of the DNA-free protein shell has been investigated by viscosity, sedimentation, infectivity, optical density, and electron microscopy measurements. Calorimetric data for the process of ejection, from the viral particle, of native DNA in solution are also presented. Inorganic salts generally increase the temperature for DNA ejection while they may decrease (NaClO4, LiBr, LiClO4) or increase (NaCl) the temperature of degradation of the protein shell. These effects, when interpreted in terms of polyelectrolyte-salt and isoelectric protein-salt interactions, suggest mechanisms responsible for virus stabilization and DNA ejection. The transformation: folded DNA inside the virus → double helical DNA in solution is an exothermic one and the heat effect is 25 Cal per mole of bases of DNA. In the presence of formaldehyde, the processes of DNA ejection and protein degradation can no longer be separated. Formaldehyde produces irreversible inhibition of DNA ejection and stabilizes the protein shell structure, apparently by a cross-linking mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2066313384,"DR L. K. BLEYMAN1 need not be concerned that our experiments on clonal senescence of human cells in culture are being carried out in ignorance of earlier studies of such ageing in protozoa. Indeed the paper he cites2 refers to one important study carried out with protozoa. The experiments with human cells are derived directly from earlier work with simple eukaryotic organisms such as fungi. When the first results were being prepared for publication3, reference was made to related studies with ciliated protozoa and a copy was sent to Professor T. M. Sonneborn for comment. In subsequent correspondence with him it became clear that it would not be possible (in a paper limited in length by the editor of Nature) to do justice to the many important observations on the complex interaction between nuclear and cytoplasmic degenerative changes during ageing in these organisms. It would be most valuable if Dr Bleyman could now be persuaded to publish a review of these experiments in the light of subsequent biochemical studies on the mechanism of clonal senescence in other organisms."
