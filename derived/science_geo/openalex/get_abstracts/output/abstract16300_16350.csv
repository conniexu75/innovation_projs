https://openalex.org/W2061050597,"We have generated mice carrying a mutation of the gene encoding the low affinity NGF receptor p75NGFR by targeted mutation in embryonic stem cells. Mice homozygous for the mutation were viable and fertile. Immunohistochemical analyses of the footpad skin of mutant mice revealed markedly decreased sensory innervation by calcitonin gene-related peptide- and substance P-immunoreactive fibers. The defective innervation was correlated with loss of heat sensitivity and associated with the development of ulcers in the distal extremities. Complicated by secondary bacterial infection, the ulcers progressed to toenail and hair loss. Crossing a human transgene encoding p75NGFR into the mutant animals rescued the absent heat sensitivity and the occurrence of skin ulcers and increased the density of neuropeptide-immunoreactive sensory innervation of footpad skin. The mutation in the gene encoding p75NGFR did not decrease the size of sympathetic ganglia or the density of sympathetic innervation of the iris or salivary gland. Our results suggest that p75NGFR has an important role in the development and function of sensory neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1982265633,"The Ah (dioxin) receptor binds a number of widely disseminated environmental pollutants, including 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and mediates their carcinogenic effects. The ligand-bound receptor activates Cyp 1a1 gene transcription through interaction with specific DNA sequences, termed xenobiotic responsive elements (XREs). The Ah receptor nuclear translocator protein (Arnt) is required for Ah receptor function. Arnt is now shown to be a structural component of the XRE binding form of the Ah receptor. Furthermore, Arnt and the ligand-binding subunit of the receptor were extracted as a complex from the nuclei of cells treated with ligand. Arnt contains a basic helix-loop-helix motif, which may be responsible for interacting with both the XRE and the ligand-binding subunit."
https://openalex.org/W2074019514,"The principal oxidants in the lower atmosphere are ozone (O3) and two by-products of O3 photodissociation, the hydroxyl radical (OH) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). A number of critical atmospheric chemical problems depend on the earth's ""oxidizing capacity,"" which is essentially the global burden of these oxidants. There is limited direct evidence for changes in the earth's oxidizing capacity since recent preindustrial times when, because of industrial and population growth, increasing amounts of O3 precursor trace gases (carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and hydrocarbons) have been released into the atmosphere. The concentrations of O3 and possibly H2O2 have increased over large regions. Models predict that tropospheric O3 will increase approximately 0.3 to 1% per year over the next 50 years with both positive and negative trends possible for OH and H2O2. Models and the observational network for oxidants are improving, but validation of global models is still at an early stage."
https://openalex.org/W1502386136,"Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and peptide YY (PYY) are structurally related peptides that primarily function as neurotransmitter and gastrointestinal hormone, respectively. Previous functional and binding data have indicated the existence of at least three distinct receptor types, Y1, Y2, and Y3, for NPY and/or PYY in mammals. We describe here a human Y1 cDNA clone, hY1-5, isolated from a fetal brain library. The human Y1 receptor consists of 384 amino acids and has seven putative transmembrane domains like other members of the G-protein-coupled superfamily of receptors. In the region spanning the transmembrane domains, the Y1 receptor displays 29% sequence identity to human tachykinin receptors, but it only shows 21% and 23% homology with proposed bovine (LCR1) and Drosophila (PR4) NPY receptor clones, respectively. Northern blot analysis of a human neuroblastoma cell line, SK-N-MC, previously used by many investigators as a model system for studies on the Y1 receptor, revealed a single 3.5-kilobase mRNA species. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated expression also in human cultured vascular smooth muscle cells, supporting the view that the Y1 receptor is associated with NPY/PYY-evoked vasoconstriction. When expressed in COS1 cells, hY1-5 conferred specific 125I-PYY binding sites with displacement patterns characteristic of the Y1 receptor, i.e. PYY greater than or equal to NPY greater than or equal to [Leu31,Pro34]NPY much greater than NPY2-36 greater than C2NPY greater than pancreatic polypeptide greater than NPY13-36 greater than NPY18-36. Moreover, in the Y1 receptor-transfected COS1 cells, but not in type 1 angiotensin II receptor-transfected control cells, NPY and PYY accelerated 45Ca2+ influx and inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation, both phenomena being characteristic of the mammalian Y1 receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1972331668,"Exclusion and inclusion of T cell receptor (TCR) genes were analyzed in alpha beta TCR transgenic mice. Both transgenes are expressed unusually early on the surface of CD4-8-, HSA+, IL-2R- thymocytes. These progenitor cells give rise to progeny, which at the single-cell level contains endogenous alpha but not beta TCR-RNA as well as protein, in addition to products encoded by the transgenes. Thus, the surface expression of an alpha beta TCR does not prevent further alpha TCR rearrangement in immature thymocytes that still transcribe RAG-1 and RAG-2 genes. Reduced levels of RAG-1 and RAG-2 RNA are detectable only in CD4+8+ TCR high cells, which result from positive selection in the thymus. The results suggest that a developing T cell may try different alpha beta TCRs for binding to thymic MHC ligands, and that recombination at the alpha locus ceases only after positive selection."
https://openalex.org/W2065792676,"THE photoreceptor G protein, transducin, is one of the class of heterotrimeric G proteins that mediates between membrane receptors and intracellular enzymes or ion channels. Light-activated rhodopsin catalyses the exchange of GDP for GTP on multiple transducin molecules. Activated transducin then stimulates cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase by releasing an inhibitory action of the phosphodiesterase γ-subunits. This leads to a decrease in cGMP levels in the rod, and closure of plasma membrane cationic channels gated by cGMP1–4. In this and other systems, turn-off of the response requires the GTP bound to G protein to be hydrolysed by an intrinsic GTPase activity5–7. Here we report that the interaction of transducin with cGMP phosphodiesterase, specifically with its γ-subunits, accelerates GTPase activity by several fold. Thus the γ-subunits of the phosphodiesterase serve a function analogous to the GTPase-activating proteins that regulate the class of small GTP-binding proteins. The acceleration can be partially suppressed by cGMP, most probably through the non-catalytic cGMP-binding sites of phosphodiesterase α and β-subunits. This cGMP regulation may function in light-adaptation of the photo-response as a negative feedback that decreases the lifetime of activated cGMP phosphodiesterase as light causes decreases in cytoplasmic cGMP."

https://openalex.org/W2144448640,"Integration of retroviral DNA can serve as a paradigm for cellular functions that are affected by the packaging of DNA into chromatin. We have used a novel polymerase chain reaction-based assay to survey DNA and chromatin for the precise distribution of many integration sites. Integration into naked DNA targets is nonuniform, implying a nucleotide sequence bias. In chromatin, integration occurs preferentially at postitions where the major groove is on the exposed face of the nucleosomal DNA helix, generating a 10 bp periodic spacing of preferred sites. Chromatin assembly enhances the reactivity of many sites, so that integration occurs most frequently at sites in nucleosomal, rather than nucleosome-free, regions of minichromosomes. In contrast, integration is prevented in a region occupied by a site-specific DNA-binding protein. Comparisons of integration events mediated by viral nucleoprotein complexes or by two different retroviral integrases show that the integration machinery also affects target site selection."
https://openalex.org/W2143319028,"The periodic paralyses are a group of autosomal dominant muscle diseases sharing a common feature of episodic paralysis. In one form, paramyotonia congenita (PC), the paralysis usually occurs with muscle cooling. Electrophysiologic studies of muscle from PC patients have revealed temperature-dependent alterations in sodium channel (NaCh) function. This observation led to demonstration of genetic linkage of a skeletal muscle NaCh gene to a PC disease allele. We now report the use of the single-strand conformation polymorphism technique to define alleles specific to PC patients from three families. Sequencing of these alleles defined base pair changes within the same codon, which resulted in two distinct amino acid substitutions for a highly conserved arginine residue in the S4 helix of domain 4 in the adult skeletal muscle NaCh. These data establish the chromosome 17q NaCh locus as the PC gene and represent two mutations causing the distinctive, temperature-sensitive PC phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2068836997,"To test the hypothesis that agrin mediates motor neuron-induced aggregation of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) in skeletal muscle fibers and to determine whether the agrin active in this process is released by motor neurons, we raised polyclonal antibodies to purified ray agrin that blocked its receptor aggregating activity. When the antibodies were applied to chick motor neuron--chick myotube cocultures, they inhibited the formation of AChR aggregates at and near neuromuscular contacts, demonstrating that agrin plays a role in the induction of the aggregates. Rat motor neurons, like chick motor neurons, induce AChR aggregates on chick myotubes. This effect was not inhibited by our antibodies, indicating that, although the antibodies inhibited the activity of chick agrin, they did not have a similar effect on rat agrin. We conclude that agrin released by rat motor neurons induced the chick myotubes to aggregate AChRs."
https://openalex.org/W2020460888,"Endogenous mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) proviruses have recently been shown to cosegregate genetically with the minor lymphocyte-stimulating loci, also termed self-superantigens. The antigenic activity has been localized to the open reading frame (ORF) protein encoded in the long terminal repeat of MMTV. We show here that unlike their nontransgenic littermates, transgenic mice expressing high levels of an ORF protein derived from the C3H exogenous MMTV specifically delete their V beta 14+ T cells and do not become infected with this virus when it is present in their mother's milk. Thus, it appears that MMTV utilizes cells of the immune system in its infection pathway, and mice that retain endogenous MMTVs should be immune to infection by exogenous virus. These results offer possible new approaches to anti-viral therapy or immunization."
https://openalex.org/W1487427036,"We have studied alpha 2,8-linked polysialic acid (polySia) and the neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) in the adult rat brain by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. Both molecules were widely distributed but not ubiquitous. Various brain regions showed colocalization of polySia and N-CAM. Strong immunoreactivity for polySia was seen in regions which were negative for N-CAM, such as the main and accessory olfactory bulbs. Immunohistochemical evidence for the heterogeneity of polySia expression in different brain regions was confirmed by immunoblotting. We present evidence that N-CAM is not the only polySia bearing protein in adult rat brain. Specifically, immunoprecipitation using the polySia-specific monoclonal antibody mAb 735 precipitated not only N-CAM isoforms carrying polySia, but also the sodium channel alpha subunit. Immunoblotting using sodium channel alpha subunit antibody (SP20) revealed a smear from 250 kDa upwards. PolySia removal using an endoneuraminidase specific for alpha 2,8-linked polysialic acid of 8 or more residues long, reduced this smear to a single band at 250 kDa. Thus both N-CAM and sodium channels carry homopolymers of alpha 2,8-linked polysialic acid in adult rat brain."
https://openalex.org/W2077742489,"During Drosophila retinal development, the R8 photoreceptor neuron induces a neighboring cell to assume an R7 cell fate through cell contact. This is mediated by the transmembrane protein bride of sevenless (boss) on the surface of the R8 cell, which binds the sevenless tyrosine kinase receptor (sev) on the surface of the R7 precursor cell. The boss protein, which contains a large extracellular domain, seven transmembrane segments, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain, has an exceptional structure for a ligand of a receptor tyrosine kinase. Using a panel of antibodies directed to various cytoplasmic and extracellular epitopes, we demonstrate that the entire boss protein from its extreme N-terminus to its extreme C-terminus is internalized by sev-expressing tissue culture cells and by the R7 precursor cell in the developing eye imaginal disc. The receptor-mediated transfer of a transmembrane ligand represents a novel mechanism for protein transfer between developing cells."
https://openalex.org/W1551374056,"The possibility that apoB 100 is cotranslationally translocated to the endoplasmic reticulum lumen and integrated into lipoproteins has been investigated. ApoB 100 nascent polypeptides were shown to be secreted from pulse-labeled Hep G2 cells after treatment with puromycin and chase for 1 or 2 h in the presence of puromycin and cycloheximide. These nascent polypeptides banded during sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation between the position of the high (HDL) and the low (LDL) density lipoproteins, revealing an inverse relationship between the length of the polypeptide and the density of the fraction. ApoB 100 occurred in the position of LDL and very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). Electronmicroscopy studies of the apoB-containing particles from the gradient indicated an increase in size with increasing length of the polypeptide. Furthermore, labeling studies indicated that the triglyceride load increased with the length of the polypeptide. An inverse relationship between the size of C-terminally truncated apoB polypeptides and the density of the assembled lipoproteins was also observed in experiments with transfected minigenes coding for apoB 41, apoB 29, and apoB 23. These proteins appeared on HDL particles. Pulse-chase experiments indicated that 80-200-kDa apoB nascent polypeptides on particles with HDL density, with time, were converted into larger polypeptides on lighter particles, to be fully replaced by apoB 100 on LDL-VLDL particles. The formation of these LDL-VLDL particles could be blocked by cycloheximide. Sixty-five percent of pulse-labeled apoB nascent polypeptides present in the microsomal fraction was released by sodium carbonate treatment, and 77% of these polypeptides could be recovered on the immature particles (banding between HDL and LDL) after sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. Pulse-chase experiments indicated that these nascent polypeptides, on the immature lipoproteins, had the capacity to be precursors for all the apoB 100-containing LDL and VLDL particles formed in the cell. The obtained results indicate that a major portion of the apoB nascent polypeptides in the cell form lipoproteins cotranslationally during the translocation to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1517746878,"Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or interleukin-3 (IL-3) suppress apoptosis in hemopoietic cells, a process of active cell death characterized by the degradation of genomic DNA into oligonucleosomic fragments. The present study was therefore initiated with the view that the two growth factors may trigger the same early events in the cell, leading to suppression of apoptosis. We provide evidence here for a role of protein kinase C and of the Na+/H+ antiporter in the signal transduction pathways activated by binding of GM-CSF or IL-3 to their respective receptors, resulting in suppression of apoptosis in target cells. First, kinetic studies indicate that the process is irreversible after two hours of deprivation. The suppression of apoptosis by GM-CSF and IL-3 is dose-dependent, with half-efficient concentrations that are in the range of the dissociation constants of the high affinity GM-CSF or IL-3 receptor, respectively. Second, the use of three inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC), H7, staurosporine, and sphingosine, in concentrations that are below their toxicity limits, revert the suppression of apoptosis by IL-3 and GM-CSF. Conversely, the use of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a PKC activator, allows a bypass of receptor activation in suppression of apoptosis. Western blotting of cytosolic and membrane proteins indicate that exposure of the cells to GM-CSF, IL-3, or TPA results in translocation of PKC to the cell membrane. Our data, therefore, indicate that the activation of PKC is important in suppression of apoptosis by GM-CSF and IL-3. Third, the two amiloride derivatives 5-(N,N-hexamethylene) and 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride that specifically block the function of the Na+/H+ antiport also revert the protective effect of GM-CSF, IL-3, and TPA on MO7-E cells. Further, exposure of the cells to GM-CSF, IL-3, or TPA results in sustained pHi alkalinizatio, which is abrogated when the cells are preincubated with 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride, a specific inhibitor of the antiport. Preincubation of the cells with staurosporine, a PKC inhibitor, also significantly reduces the effect of GM-CSF or IL-3 on pHi. Taken together, our data indicate that a functional antiport is required in suppression of apoptosis by GM-CSF, IL-3, or TPA. Furthermore, our results are consistent with the view that GM-CSF or IL-3 receptor activation initiates the sequential activation of PKC and of the Na+/H+ antiporter, resulting in suppression of apoptosis in target cells."
https://openalex.org/W1558257735,"The superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase system in phagocytes consists of at least membrane-associated cytochrome b558 and three cytosolic components named SOCI/NCF-3/sigma 1/C1, SOCII/NCF-1/p47-phox, and SO-CIII/NCF-2/p67-phox. p47-phox and p67-phox were isolated, and their primary structures were determined, but SOCI has not been well characterized. In the present study, we first purified SOCI to homogeneity from the cytosol fraction of the differentiated HL-60 cells. The purified SOCI was a small GTP-binding protein (G protein) with a M(r) of about 22,000. The guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate-bound form, but not the GDP-bound form, of this small G protein showed the SOCI activity. The partial amino acid sequence of SOCI thus far determined was identical to the amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA encoding rac2 p21. None of the purified small G proteins, including Ki-ras p21, smg p21B/rap1B p21, rhoA p21, and rac1 p21, showed the SOCI activity. These results indicate that SOCI is a small G protein very similar, if not identical, to rac2 p21. The GDP/GTP exchange reaction of SOCI was stimulated and inhibited by stimulatory and inhibitory GDP/GTP exchange proteins for small G proteins, named smg GDS and rho GDI, respectively. The NADPH oxidase activity was also stimulated and inhibited by smg GDS and rho GDI, respectively. These results indicate that the superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase system is regulated by both smg GDS and rho GDI through rac2 p21 or the rac2-related small G protein in phagocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1577073887,"The insulin-like growth factor I (IGF I) receptor is a tyrosine kinase-containing transmembrane protein that plays an important role in cell growth control. We have isolated and characterized human genomic DNA clones containing the entire coding sequence of the IGF I receptor. Results of restriction analysis and sequencing of multiple overlapping clones were consistent with the existence of a single IGF I receptor gene. The complete receptor coding sequence is contained in 21 exons. There is striking homology with the insulin receptor gene in overall size (approximately 100 kilobases) and in the number and size of individual exons. An exon analogous to the alternatively spliced exon 11 of the insulin receptor gene could not be detected. An alternative internal splice site corresponding to a known alternatively spliced mRNA transcript was shown to be located at the 5' end of exon 14. Knowledge of the structure of the IGF I receptor gene should facilitate further studies on the structural determinants of receptor function, the relationships between insulin and IGF I receptors, and the molecular basis for multiple IGF I receptor species."
https://openalex.org/W1967983448,"The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein MyoD is a transcription factor that is important for the induction of the myogenic phenotype. The DNA binding basic region (13 amino acids) is necessary for recognition of the consensus MyoD binding site, for transcriptional activation, and for conversion of fibroblasts to muscle. In contrast, the non-tissue-specific bHLH protein E12 can bind to the MyoD binding site but does not induce myogenesis. Here, it is shown that only two amino acids in the MyoD basic region and a single amino acid from the junction, which separates the basic region and helix 1, are sufficient for myogenic specificity when substituted into the corresponding region of E12. These findings suggest that the recognition of particular determinants in the basic region is required for conversion of fibroblasts to muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1543945339,"Several studies indicate that active oxygen species play an important role in the development of pulmonary disease (asbestosis and silicosis) after exposure to mineral dust. The present study was conducted to determine if inhaled fibrogenic minerals induced changes in gene expression and activities of antioxidant enzymes (AOE) in rat lung. Two different fibrogenic minerals were compared, crocidolite, an amphibole asbestos fiber, and cristobalite, a crystalline silicon dioxide particle. Steady-state mRNA levels, immunoreactive protein, and activities of selected AOE were measured in lungs 1-10 days after initiation of exposure and at 14 days after cessation of a 10-day exposure period. Exposure to asbestos resulted in significant increases in steady-state mRNA levels of manganese-containing superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) at 3 and 9 days and of glutathione peroxidase at 6 and 9 days. An increase in steady-state mRNA levels of copper, zinc-containing superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), was observed at 6 days. Exposure to asbestos also resulted in overall increased enzyme activities of catalase, glutathione peroxidase and total superoxide dismutase in lung. In contrast, silica caused a dramatic increase in steady-state levels of MnSOD mRNA at all time periods and an increase in glutathione peroxidase mRNA levels at 9 days. Activities of AOE remained unchanged in silica-exposed lungs. In both models, increases in gene expression of MnSOD correlated with increased amounts of MnSOD immunoreactive protein in lung and the pattern and extent of inflammation. These data indicate that the profiles of AOE are dissimilar during the development of experimental asbestosis or silicosis and suggest different mechanisms of lung defense in response to these minerals."
https://openalex.org/W1493638086,"The signal for rapid internalization of the mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor has been localized to the sequence Tyr-Lys-Tyr-Ser-Lys-Val in positions 24-29 of its 163-residue cytoplasmic tail. Most of the activity of this signal is mediated by the carboxyl 4 amino acids, especially Tyr26 and Val29 (Canfield, W. M., Johnson, K. F., Ye, R. D., Gregory, W. and Kornfeld, S. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 5682-5688). In this study, we have tested the effect of a series of mutations on the internalization rate of a mutant receptor that contains a 29-amino acid cytoplasmic tail terminating with the 4-amino acid internalization sequence Tyr-Ser-Lys-Val. Replacement of Tyr26 with Phe or Trp gave rise to mutant receptors that were internalized at 10% the wild-type rate, while receptors with Ala, Leu, Ile, Val, or Asn at this position were totally inactive. Val29 could be replaced by other large hydrophobic residues (Phe, Leu, Ile, or Met) with no loss of activity, but the presence of Ala, Gly, Arg, Gln, or Tyr in this position inactivated the signal. Ser27 could be effectively replaced by many different amino acids, but not by Pro or Gly. However, Gly27 could be tolerated if the residues at positions 28 and 29 were also changed. A change in the 2-residue spacing between Tyr26 and Val29 destroyed the signal. These data show that the essential elements of this signal are an aromatic residue, especially a Tyr in the first position, separated from a large hydrophobic residue in the last position by 2 amino acids. The residues in positions 2 and 3 of the signal may have a modulating effect on its activity. The Tyr-Ser-Lys-Val signal could be moved to a more proximal region of the cytoplasmic tail with only a modest loss of activity. In addition, the signal could be effectively replaced by the putative 4-residue signals of seven other receptors and membrane proteins known to undergo rapid endocytosis, including the Tyr-Thr-Arg-Phe sequence of the transferrin receptor, a Type II membrane protein. These results are compatible with the 4-residue signals of this type being interchangeable, even among Type I and Type II membrane proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1592988504,"In Escherichia coli, expulsion of sodium ions is driven by proton flux via at least two distinct Na+/H+ antiporters, NhaA and NhaB. When the nhaA gene is deleted from the chromosome, the cell becomes sensitive to high salinity and alkaline pH (Padan, E., Maisler, N., Taglicht, D., Karpel, R., and Schuldiner, S. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 20297-20302). In the current work we cloned the nhaB gene by complementation of the delta nhaA strain. The gene codes for a membrane protein 504 amino acids long. Hydropathic analysis of the sequence indicates the presence of 12 putative transmembrane helices. NhaB has been specifically labeled with [35S]methionine; it is a membrane protein and displays an apparent M(r) of 47,000, slightly lower than that predicted from its amino acid sequence. Membranes from cells containing multiple dose of nhaB display enhanced Na+/H+ antiporter activity, as measured by the ability of Na+ to collapse a preformed pH gradient or by direct measurement of 22Na+ fluxes. In contrast to NhaA, whose activity increases with pH, NhaB is practically insensitive to pH. Limited homologies with Na+ transporters have been identified."
https://openalex.org/W2112575995,"The catalytic mechanism of O2 reduction by cytochrome oxidase was studied in isolated mitochondria and mitoplasts by partial reversal of the reaction. At a high redox potential (Eh) of cytochrome c, high pH, and a high electrochemical proton gradient (delta mu H+) across the inner mitochondrial membrane, the initial ferriccupric state (O) of the oxidized enzyme's bimetallic oxygen reaction center is converted to ferryl (F) and peroxy (P) intermediates, the optical spectroscopic properties of which are reported in detail. This is associated with reversed electron transfer from the bimetallic center to ferricytochrome c. The kinetics of reduction of ferricytochrome c by the reversed electron transfer process are compared with the kinetics of formation of F and P. The results are consistent with transfer of one electron from the ferric-cupric bimetallic center (O) to cytochrome c, yielding the F intermediate, followed by transfer of one electron from the latter to cytochrome c, yielding the P state. In the absence of an effective redox buffer, poising cytochrome c highly oxidized, these primary events are immediately followed by reoxidation of cytochrome c, which is ascribed to forward electron transfer to enzyme molecules still in the O state. This forward reaction also results in accumulation of the P intermediate. Kinetic stimulations of the data predict equilibrium constants for the reversed electron transfer steps, and Em,7 values of approximately 1.1 and 1.2 V may be calculated for the F/O and P/F redox couples, respectively, at delta mu H+ and delta psi equal to zero. Taken together with previously measured Em,7 values, these data indicate that it is the two-electron reduction of bound dioxygen to bound peroxide that is responsible for the irreversibility of the catalytic dioxygen cycle of cell respiration."
https://openalex.org/W1578647589,"Mammalian RNA polymerase II contains at the C terminus of its largest subunit an unusual domain consisting of 52 tandem repeats of the consensus sequence Tyr-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ser. The phosphorylation of this domain is thought to play an important role in the transition of RNA polymerase II from a preinitiation complex to an elongating complex. The unphosphorylated form of RNA polymerase II is designated IIA, whereas the phosphorylated form is designated IIO. In an effort to determine the consequence of C-terminal domain phosphorylation on complex formation, 32P-labeled RNA polymerases IIA and IIO were prepared and examined for their ability to form a stable preinitiation complex on the adenovirus-2 major late promoter in the presence of a reconstituted HeLa cell transcription extract. Preinitiation complexes were formed in the absence of ATP and purified from free RNA polymerase II by chromatography on Sepharose CL-4B. The state of phosphorylation of the largest subunit was monitored by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the transcriptional activity was determined by assaying specific transcript formation upon the addition of nucleotides and a competing DNA template. RNA polymerase IIA was recovered in transcriptionally active complexes in reactions in which the input enzyme was RNA polymerase IIA. In reactions with RNA polymerase IIO as the input enzyme, no IIO was recovered in excluded fractions that normally contain preinitiation complex. In reactions with equimolar amounts of RNA polymerases IIO and IIA, purified preinitiation complexes contained almost exclusively RNA polymerase HA. These results support the idea that RNA polymerase II containing an unphosphorylated C-terminal domain preferentially associates with the adenovirus-2 major late promoter. The state of phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain can, therefore, directly influence preinitiation complex formation. We also report here the presence of an activity in HeLa cell extracts that catalyzes dephosphorylation of the C-terminal domain, thereby converting RNA polymerase IIO to IIA. This C-terminal domain phosphatase is specific in that it does not catalyze the dephosphorylation of a serine residue phosphorylated by casein kinase II. The presence of a C-terminal domain phosphatase in in vitro transcription reactions containing RNA polymerase IIO results in the formation of RNA polymerase IIA. This RNA polymerase IIA associates preferentially with preinitiation complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2023593713,"In embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells retinoic acid (RA) strongly induces transcription from the RA receptor β2 (RARβ2) promoter through an RA response element (RARE) located in close proximity to the TATA box. Here we demonstrate that recombinant human TATA box-binding protein, hTFIID, and RAR functionally cooperate in transactivation of the RARβ2 promoter in EC cells in a strictly RA-dependent manner. We demonstrate that the core domain of hTFIID is sufficient to mediate RAR-dependent transcription and that Drosophila, but not yeast, TFIID can substitute for hTFIID. In COS cells ectopic expression of the E1A protein is a prerequisite for hTFIID and RAR to cooperate in transactivation. We propose a model for transcriptional regulation of the RARβ2 promoter in EC cells in which RAR, following activation by RA, functionally interacts with hTFIID via an E1A-like activity present in EC cells."
https://openalex.org/W1530373502,"We have assessed the effects of endothelin-1 (ET-1) on transmembrane signaling in adult rat ventricular myocytes. ET-1 stimulates phosphoinositide hydrolysis with an EC50 of 0.3-0.8 nM. This stimulation is linear for up to 30 min in the presence of a protease inhibitor, is additive with the effects of other stimulators of phosphoinositide hydrolysis, is not inhibited by the Ca2+ entry blocker, nifedipine, and is insensitive to pertussis toxin. ET-1 also reduces cyclic AMP production in myocytes in response to isoproterenol and forskolin (EC50, 1 nM). This cyclic AMP-lowering effect of ET-1 is sensitive to pertussis toxin, can be demonstrated directly in assays of adenylate cyclase activity of myocyte membranes, and seems to be mediated by Gi. These data indicate that the effects of endothelin on adult cardiac myocytes involve multiple signaling pathways, including enhanced activity of the inositol phosphate pathway and a decrease in cyclic AMP-mediated responses, neither of which seems likely to account for the positive contractile effects of endothelin."
https://openalex.org/W1991461662,"Modulation of N- and L-type Ca2+ channels by oxotremorine-M (oxo-M) acting on muscarinic receptors and norepinephrine (NE) acting on alpha-adrenergic receptors was studied in superior cervical ganglion neurons. Oxo-M depresses dihydropyridine-augmented tail currents in whole-cell recordings, whereas NE does not. This modulation of L-type Ca2+ channels by oxo-M is abolished by adding 20 mM BAPTA to the pipette solution. Oxo-M, acting via a diffusible messenger, reduces the probability of opening of single N- and L-type channels recorded in cell-attached patches. We conclude that a diffusible messenger signaling pathway activated by oxo-M inhibits both N- and L-type Ca2+ channels, whereas a membrane-delimited pathway activated by oxo-M and NE inhibits only N-type Ca2+ channels."
https://openalex.org/W1516667549,"Bacillus subtilis contains two aa3-type terminal oxidases (caa3-605 and aa3-600) catalyzing cytochrome c and quinol oxidation, respectively, with the concomitant reduction of O2 to H2O (Lauraeus, M., Haltia, T., Saraste, M., and Wikstrom, M. (1991) Eur. J. Biochem. 197, 699-705). Previous studies characterized only the structural genes of caa3-605 oxidase. We isolated the genes coding for the four subunits of a B. subtilis terminal oxidase from a genomic DNA library. These genes, named qoxA to qoxD, are organized in an operon. Examination of the deduced amino acid sequence of Qox subunits showed that this oxidase is structurally related to the large family of mitochondrial-type aa3 terminal oxidases. In particular, the amino acid sequences are very similar to those of subunits of Escherichia coli bo quinol oxidase and B. subtilis caa3-605 cytochrome c oxidase. We produced, by in vitro mutagenesis, a mutation in the qox operon. From the phenotype of the mutant strain devoid of Qox protein, the study of expression of the qox operon in different growth conditions, and the analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of the subunits, we concluded that Qox protein and aa3-600 quinol oxidase are the same protein. Although several terminal oxidases are found in B. subtilis, Qox oxidase (aa3-600) is predominant during the vegetative growth and its absence leads to important alterations of the phenotype of B. subtilis."
https://openalex.org/W2060871246,"The heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins) are activated by sensory or hormone receptors. In turn, the G proteins activate effector proteins such as adenylyl cyclase, cyclic guanosine 3′,5′-monophosphate phosphodiesterase (cGMP PDE), phospholipase C, and potassium and calcium ion channels by mechanisms that are poorly understood. A site on the α subunit of the G protein transducin (αt) has been identified that interacts with and activates cGMP phosphodiesterase, the effector enzyme in rod photoreceptors. A 22-amino acid peptide, corresponding to residues 293 to 314 from the COOH-terminal region of αt, fully mimicked αt and potently activated PDE. This region is adjacent to the receptor activation domain; thus, the α subunit of this G protein has a site for interaction with both its effector and receptor that maps near the COOH-terminus."
https://openalex.org/W1525549376,"The domain of thrombomodulin that binds to the anion-binding exosite of thrombin was identified by comparing the binding of fragments of thrombomodulin to thrombin with that of Hirugen, a 12-residue peptide of hirudin that is known to bind to the anion-binding exosite of thrombin. Three soluble fragments of thrombomodulin, containing (i) the six repeated growth factor-like domains of thrombomodulin (GF1-6), (ii) one-half of the second through the sixth growth factor-like repeats (GF2.5-6), or (iii) the fifth and sixth such domains (GF5-6), were examined. Hirugen was a competitive inhibitor for either GF1-6 or GF2.5-6 stimulation of thrombin activation of protein C. GF5-6, which binds to thrombin without altering its ability to activate protein C, competed with fluorescein-labeled Hirugen for binding to thrombin. Therefore, all three thrombomodulin fragments, each of which lacked the chondroitin sulfate moiety, competed with Hirugen for binding to thrombin. To determine whether GF5-6 and Hirugen were binding to overlapping sites on thrombin or were interfering allosterically with each other's binding to thrombin, the effects of each thrombomodulin fragment and of Hirugen on the active site conformation of thrombin were compared using two different approaches: fluorescence-detected changes in the structure of the active site and the hydrolysis of chromogenic substrates. The GF5-6 and Hirugen peptides affected these measures of active site conformation very similarly, and hence GF5-6 and Hirugen contact residues on the surface of thrombin that allosterically alter the active site structure to a similar extent. Full-length thrombomodulin and GF1-6 alter the active site structure to comparable extents, but the amidolytic activity of thrombin complexed to thrombomodulin or GF1-6 differs significantly from that of thrombin complexed to GF5-6 or Hirugen. Taken together, these results indicate that the GF5-6 domain of thrombomodulin binds to the anion-binding exosite of thrombin. Furthermore, the binding of GF5-6 to the anion-binding exosite alters thrombin specificity, as evidenced by GF5-6-dependent changes in both the kcat and Km of synthetic substrate hydrolysis by thrombin. The contact sites on thrombin for the GF4 domain and the chondroitin sulfate moiety of thrombomodulin are still unknown."
https://openalex.org/W1596660137,"The muscle-specific helix-loop-helix (HLH) proteins myogenin, MyoD, myf5, and MRF4 form hetero-oligomers with ubiquitous HLH proteins encoded by the E2A gene and activate muscle transcription by binding to a DNA sequence known as an E-box (CANNTG). Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) can inhibit muscle differentiation by silencing the transcription-activating potential of myogenic HLH proteins without affecting their ability to bind DNA. We show that repression by TGF-beta is directed at the basic-HLH motif of myogenin and is independent of E2A products. Using a series of reporter genes as targets for trans-activation by myogenin, transcriptional repression by TGF-beta is also shown to map to the E-box motif and to not require heterologous DNA sequence elements. These results demonstrate that TGF-beta represses muscle-specific transcription through a post-translational mechanism that renders the basic-HLH regions of the myogenic regulators nonfunctional. The selective repression of myogenic HLH proteins by TGF-beta indicates that the TGF-beta signaling system can discriminate between different classes of HLH proteins and implies that myogenic HLH proteins activate muscle-specific transcription through a unique mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1564750685,"Most of the resident soluble proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) seem to be sorted into this compartment via their COOH-terminal tetrapeptide Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL). This sorting is supposed to occur in a post-ER compartment. Three resident soluble ER glycoproteins belonging to the KDEL family are CaBP1, CaBP2, CaBP3 (= calreticulin), and CaBP4 (= grp94) (Nguyen Van, P., Peter, F., and Soling, H.-D. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 17494-17501). In rat liver, calreticulin possesses a carbohydrate moiety of the complex hybrid type with terminal galactoses (Nguyen Van, P., Peter, F., and Soling, H.-D. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 17494-17501). We can show now that practically all calreticulin molecules (and not only a fraction) possess terminal galactoses as well as the COOH-terminal KDEL sequence. This as well as pulse-chase experiments performed at 37 and 15 degrees C indicate that calreticulin must have passed through the trans-Golgi. Subcellular fractionations of post-mitochondrial supernatants from isolated rat hepatocytes by sucrose-Nycodenz gradient centrifugation revealed that calreticulin is confined mainly to the rough ER, grp94 mainly to the smooth ER. CaBP1, a member of the thioredoxin family, was recovered in fractions which most likely represent the intermediate compartment. This indicates that KDEL is a sorting signal which leads to the retention of these proteins in the pre-Golgi compartments. However, additional factors, most likely residing within the specific KDEL protein itself, determine the final location of the protein within the pre-Golgi compartments. This is underlined by experiments in which the density dependent distribution of total KDEL proteins was studied using a COOH-terminal KDEL-specific antibody."
https://openalex.org/W2136121450,"On the basis of protein homology, nhaR has previously been shown to belong to a large family of regulatory proteins, the LysR family (Henikoff, S., Haughn, G.W., Calvo, J.M., and Wallace, J.C. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 85, 6602-6606). In this work we show that nhaR is a regulator of nhaA, a gene encoding a Na+/H+ antiporter in Escherichia coli. Multicopy plasmid bearing nhaR enhances the Na(+)-dependent induction of a chromosomal nhaA‘-‘lacZ fusion. Extracts derived from cells overexpressing nhaR exhibit specific DNA binding capacity to the upstream sequences of nhaA. Construction of an nhaR deletion mutant (OR100) shows that nhaR is required in addition to nhaA to tolerate the extreme conditions under which nhaA is indispensable. Whereas OR100 grows like the wild type at neutral pH even at high Na+ concentrations (700 mM), it becomes much more sensitive to Na+ (greater than 300 mM) at pH 8.5; furthermore, OR100 is more sensitive to Li+ (100 mM) than the wild type. Nevertheless, the phenotype of OR100, which is more resistant to Na+, Li+, and alkaline pH than a delta nhaA strain (NM81), implies that the regulation exerted by nhaR is not complete and that some expression of nhaA exists in OR100. Accordingly, the effect of nhaR in cells is dependent on the level of nhaA. OR200, a nhaA and nhaR deletion mutant, has the same phenotype as NM81. Multicopy plasmid bearing nhaR does not change the phenotype of either OR200 or NM81. On the other hand, multicopy nhaA renders the cells Li(+)- and and Na(+)-resistant even without nhaR."
https://openalex.org/W1542442836,"The smg-25A/rab3A protein (smg p25A), a member of the small GTP-binding protein superfamily, has a C-terminal structure of Cys-Ala-Cys which is post-translationally processed: both cysteine residues are geranylgeranylated followed by the carboxyl methylation of the C-terminal cysteine residue. We reported previously that this posttranslational processing is essential for the interactions of smg p25A with membrane and its inhibitory GDP/GTP exchange protein, named smg p25A GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI). In this study, we examined which posttranslational modification of smg p25A is necessary for these interactions. The smg p25A which was not posttranslationally processed was produced in Escherichia coli and purified. This protein was then geranylgeranylated at both of the 2 cysteine residues by use of a bovine brain geranylgeranyltransferase in a cell-free system (recombinant smg p25A-GG). By use of this recombinant smg p25A-GG, its membrane-binding activity and its sensitivity to smg p25A GDI were compared with those of the fully posttranslationally processed form of bovine brain smg p25A (smg p25A-GG-Me) and the posttranslationally unprocessed form of bacterial smg p25A (recombinant smg p25A). The membrane-binding activity and sensitivity to smg p25A GDI were similar between the recombinant smg p25A-GG and smg p25A-GG-Me, although recombinant smg p25A lacked both activities. These results indicate that the geranylgeranyl moiety of smg p25A is essential and sufficient for its interactions with membrane and smg p25A GDI and that the methyl moiety is not essential for these interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1481034093,"The DNA sequence of the sulfate activation locus from Escherichia coli K-12 has been determined. The sequence includes the structural genes encoding the enzymes ATP sulfurylase (cysD and cysN) and APS kinase (cysC) which catalyze the synthesis of activated sulfate. These are the only genes known to reside in the sulfate activation operon. Consensus elements of the operon promoter were identified, and the start codons and open reading frames of the Cys polypeptides were determined. During this work, another gene, iap, was partially sequenced and mapped. The activity of ATP sulfurylase is stimulated by an intrinsic GTPase. Comparison of the primary sequences of CysN and Ef-Tu revealed that CysN has conserved many of the residues integral to the three-dimensional structure important for guanine nucleotide binding in Ef-Tu and RAS. nodP and nodQ, from Rhizobium meliloti, are essential for nodulation in leguminous plants. The Cys and Nod proteins are remarkably similar. NodP appears to be the smaller subunit of ATP sulfurylase. NodQ encodes homologues of both CysN and CysC; thus, these enzymes may be covalently associated in R. meliloti. The consensus GTP-binding sequences of NodQ and CysN are identical suggesting that NodQ encodes a regulatory GTPase."
https://openalex.org/W1546336086,"Rat 6 fibroblasts that stably overexpress cDNA for the beta 1 isozyme of protein kinase C (PKC3 cells) were used to determine the effect of protein kinase C (PKC) overexpression on hormonal stimulation of phospholipid hydrolysis. In control Rat 6 cells, inositol trisphosphate levels (InsP3) were increased 9-fold in 15 s in response to 10 nM alpha-thrombin, compared with only a 2-fold increase in PKC3 cells. PKC overexpression also inhibited thrombin-stimulated production of 1,2-diacylglycerol, the other product of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis, by 73% at 15 s. In permeabilized cells, PKC overexpression greatly reduced guanosine thiotriphosphate-stimulated InsP3 accumulation, but did not affect InsP3 stimulation by increased free calcium concentration. These data suggest that desensitization of thrombin-stimulated phosphoinositide-phospholipase C is enhanced by PKC-beta 1 overexpression and may involve modulation of G-protein/phospholipase C coupling. In contrast, thrombin was 4.5-fold more effective in stimulation of phosphatidylcholine-phospholipase D activity in PKC3 cells than in control cells, as determined by phosphatidylethanol formation. In permeabilized cells, guanosine thiotriphosphate also stimulated phospholipase D activity more effectively in PKC3 cells than in control cells, suggesting that upregulation of phospholipase D activity by PKC overexpression occurs distal to the thrombin receptor. These results suggest that PKC may act as a switch to up-regulate phosphatidylcholine-phospholipase D and down-regulate phosphoinositide-phospholipase C stimulations."
https://openalex.org/W2024611380,"Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) in Aplysia bag cell neurons causes the recruitment of voltage-dependent calcium channels. Using imaging techniques on isolated cells, we have now found that an activator of PKC,12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), promotes the rapid appearance of new sites of calcium influx associated with a change in the morphology of neurite endings. In untreated cells, calcium influx triggered by action potentials occurs along neurites and in the central region of growth cones, but does not usually occur at the leading edge of lamellipodia. TPA produces extension of the lamellipodium, and action potentials now trigger calcium influx at the distal edge of the newly extended endings. Cotreatment with TPA and a cyclic AMP analog promotes movement of secretory organelles toward the new sites of calcium influx. Our results suggest that these second messenger systems promote the rapid formation of morphological structures that contribute to the potentiation of peptide release."

Intermediates in the degradative pathway apparently include FRP covalently linked in larger aggregates. The effect of iron on FRP degradation is enhanced by porphyrin precursors but is decreased by inhibitors of porphyrin synthesis, which implies that heme is an active agent. These results suggest that translational induction in this system may be caused by enhanced repressor degradation. While unique among translational regulatory systems, this process is common to a variety of other biosynthetic control mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1496269828,"1,2-Dehydro-N-acetyldopamine (dehydro-NADA) is an important catecholamine derivative involved in the cross-linking of insect cuticular components during sclerotization. Since sclerotization is a vital process for the survival of insects, and is closely related to melanogenesis, it is of interest to unravel the chemical mechanisms participating in this process. The present paper reports on the mechanism by which dehydro-NADA is oxidatively activated to form reactive intermediate(s) as revealed by pulse radiolysis, electron spin resonance spectroscopy, high performance liquid chromatography, and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopic analysis. Pulse radiolytic one-electron oxidation of dehydro-NADA by N3. (k = 5.3 x 10(9) M-1 s-1) or Br2.- (k = 7.5 x 10(8) M-1 s-1) at pH6 resulted in the rapid generation of the corresponding semiquinone radical, lambda max 400 nm, epsilon = 20,700 M-1 cm-1. This semiquinone decayed to form a second transient intermediate, lambda max 485 nm, epsilon = 8000 M-1 cm-1, via a second order disproportionation process, k = 6.2 x 10(8) M-1 s-1. At pH 6 in the presence of azide, the first order decay of this second intermediate occurred over milliseconds; the rate decreases at higher pH. At pH 6 in the presence of bromide, the intermediate decayed much more slowly over seconds, k = 0.15 s-1. Under such conditions, the dependence of the first order decay constant upon parent dehydro-NADA concentration led to a second order rate constant of 8.5 x 10(2) M-1 s-1 for reaction of the intermediate with the parent, probably to form benzodioxan dimers. (The term dimer is used for convenience; the products are strictly bisdehydrodimers of dehydro-NADA (see Discussion and Fig. 11)) Rate constants of 5.9 x 10(5), 4.5 x 10(5), 2.8 x 10(4) and 3.5 x 10(4) M-1 s-1 were also obtained for decay of the second intermediate in the presence of cysteine, cysteamine, o-phenylenediamine, and p-aminophenol, respectively. By comparison with the UV-visible spectroscopic properties of the two-electron oxidized species derived from dehydro-NADA and from 1,2-dehydro-N-acetyldopa methyl ester, it is concluded that the transient intermediate exhibiting absorbance at 485 nm is the quinone methide tautomer of the o-quinone of dehydro-NADA. Sclerotization of insect cuticle is discussed in the light of these findings."
https://openalex.org/W1559713510,"Gangliosides were recently shown to bind to calmodulin (Higashi, H., Omori, A., and Yamagata, T. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 9831-9838). This prompted us to investigate the effects of gangliosides on the calmodulin-dependent enzyme, cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase. Several species of gangliosides competitively inhibited calmodulin-stimulated phosphodiesterase activity, with GD1b, GT1b, and GD1a being noted to do so particularly (group 1). GM1, GQ1b, and GM2 (group 2) were less inhibitory, and GM3, GM3(NeuGc), GalCer, sulfatide, GgOse4Cer, and oligosaccharide portions of inhibitory gangliosides showed no inhibition in accordance with the binding specificity of calmodulin to gangliosides. Trypsin-activated phosphodiesterase was inhibited by gangliosides with similar specificity, indicating interactions of gangliosides with the enzyme. Inhibition, however, was less than that of calmodulin-dependent activity by these compounds and, in both cases, was eliminated by excess calmodulin. In the absence of calmodulin, group 1 gangliosides at lower concentrations activated the intact enzyme but inhibited it over a certain range of increase in concentration. Ganglioside-dependent modulation of calmodulin-dependent phosphodiesterase activity is thus shown to be due to interactions of gangliosides with both calmodulin and the enzyme, and consequently, ganglioside-calmodulin binding is likely the mechanism for regulation of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1590406972,"n-Butyrate, a short chain fatty acid that is produced by colonic bacterial fermentation, is detectable in portal blood and induces differentiation in various human neoplastic cell lines. Earlier reports indicated approximately 20-fold induction in vitro by n-butyrate of the sialyltransferase that catalyzes terminal glycosylation of GM3 ganglioside in HeLa and colon cancer cells. We previously isolated a 1.3-kilobase cDNA for a human beta-galactoside alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase, for which N-linked glycoproteins are the acceptors. We report here that treatment of Hep G2 cells with 5 mM n-butyrate for 24 h reduced beta-galactoside alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase mRNA levels by approximately 90%. Reductions in mRNA level were followed by approximately 75 and approximately 90% reductions, respectively, in specific beta-galactoside alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase enzyme activity after treatment for 24 and 36 h with 5 mM n-butyrate. However, in contrast with earlier reports of enhanced ganglioside synthesis in response to n-butyrate treatment, incubation of Hep G2 cells with n-butyrate did not alter the ganglioside pattern as assessed by thin layer chromatography of lipids extracted from treated cells. Nuclear run-on reactions indicated that the rate of transcription of beta-galactoside, alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase was not altered by treatment with 5 mM n-butyrate for 24 h, but the effects of this treatment on cytoplasmic levels of beta-galactoside alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase mRNA were largely negated by co-treatment with actinomycin D or cycloheximide. Therefore, our results show that n-butyrate reduces expression of mature beta-galactoside alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase mRNA by post-transcriptional mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1577200437,"The muscle-specific promoter of the dystrophin gene is active in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles and is specifically stimulated during differentiation of myoblasts into multinucleated myotubes. An 850-base pair (bp) DNA fragment upstream from the cap site is able to confer a partial muscle specificity to a reporter gene. The region between -850 and -140 bp includes nonspecific negative and positive regulatory sequences. A continuous stretch of 140 bp upstream from the cap site exhibits a striking conservation between rodents and human (93% homology) and still retains muscle preference of expression. It contains two putative binding sites for factors involved in regulation of other muscle-specific genes, a CCArGG box and an E box. This latter element, however, is unable to confer the ability to be transactivated by MyoD1 to the dystrophin promoter. The -140-bp promoter fragment exhibits antagonist effects contributed by one inhibiting sequence (nucleotide -140/-96), active in all cell types, and one activating region, from nucleotide -96 to the cap site, sufficient to confer a muscle preference of expression, in which the CCArGG box seems to play a major role."

https://openalex.org/W1564563206,"Abstract Recently, we demonstrated that okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, inhibits myogenesis by extinguishing the expression of MyoD1 and inducing the expression of Id. Since it has been reported that transformation by c-fos also inhibits myogenesis through inhibition of MyoD1 expression, we examined the effects of okadaic acid on the activation of the c-fos and jun family of proto-oncogenes in an attempt to understand the mechanism by which okadaic acid inhibits the myogenic differentiation. Treatment of C2C12 cells in growth medium with okadaic acid increased expression of the mRNAs for the c-fos family continuously and for the jun family to a lesser extent. In contrast, in differentiation medium, the induction of c-fos, c-jun, and fos B mRNAs by okadaic acid was transient, whereas fra-1, jun D, and jun B mRNAs were induced continuously, suggesting that okadaic acid regulates the expression of the c-fos and jun family through complex regulatory mechanisms depending on the state of differentiation of the cells. Transfection of c-jun and c-fos promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs demonstrated that the effects of okadaic acid on the induction of c-fos and c-jun are mediated through the activation of promoter elements. These results suggest that some of the targets of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A may include transcription factors capable of forming AP1 complexes and that these factors may play an important role during myogenic differentiation."

The endopeptidase (M(r) 69,000) was extracted from liver microsomes with 1% Lubrol and purified about 2,700-fold. The substrate employed for isolation and characterization of the enzyme was the decapeptide acetyl-Ala-Arg-Val-Arg-Arg-Ala-Asn-Ser-Phe-Leu (prothrombin peptide), in which hydrolysis occurred on the carboxyl side of the paired Arg-Arg residues. The purified enzyme, whose activity was enhanced 1.8-fold by 0.1 mM CoCl2, has a Km = 80 microM and Vmax = 21,000 nmol.min-1.mg-1 and a pH optimum of 8.7. Proteolytic cleavage of decapeptide substrates was dependent on an arginine residue at positions P1 and P4. The enzyme was completely inhibited by EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline as well as by p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid and Hg2+. Inhibitors of serine proteases and cysteine proteases had no effect. Based on the substrate preference, the endopeptidase appears to be a good candidate for the enzyme responsible for the precursor processing of the vitamin K-dependent proteins and a number of other proproteins that are synthesized via the secretory pathway in liver and other tissues."

Electrophoretic mobilities on two-dimensional gels of the immunoprecipitated 41- and 43-kDa phosphoproteins were similar to those of the 41- and 43-kDa cytosol proteins, whose increased tyrosine phosphorylation we and others had originally identified in various mitogen-stimulated cells (Cooper, J. A., Sefton, B. M., and Hunter, T. (1984) Mol. Cell. Biol. 4, 30-37; Kohno, M. (1985) J. Biol.

All those phosphoproteins contained phosphotyrosine, and the more acidic forms contained additional phosphothreonine. Immunoprecipitated 41- and 43-kDa phosphoproteins had serine/threonine kinase activity toward myelin basic protein (MBP) and microtuble-associated protein 2 (MAP2). With the combination of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and the kinase assay in MBP-containing polyacrylamide gels of the alpha Y91 immunoprecipitates, with or without phosphatase 2A treatment, we showed that only their acidic forms were active. These results clearly indicate that 41- and 43-kDa proteins, the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of which is rapidly and commonly induced by mitogen stimulation of fibroblasts, are family members of ERKs/MAP2 kinases and that phosphorylation both on tyrosine and threonine residues is necessary for their activation."

Wild-type GAP did not affect transcription induced by oncogenic Ras but reversed the inhibitory effect of GAP-C on transcription induced by oncogenic Ras.

https://openalex.org/W1649576447,"We have previously shown that HeLa cells contain activities implicated in tRNA splicing in yeast, a ligase capable of joining tRNA half-molecules and an NAD-dependent activity capable of removing the 2'-phosphate created at the splice junction by the ligase (Zillmann, M., Gorovsky, M.A., and Phizicky, E.M. (1991) Mol. Cell. Biol. 11, 5410-5416). We show here that removal of the splice junction 2'-phosphate is, as in yeast, a 2'-phosphate-specific phosphotransfer reaction that produces the same, as yet unidentified, small molecule. This enzyme is highly specific for oligomeric substrates having internal 2'-phosphates. Oligomers bearing terminal 2'-phosphates are at least 50-fold less reactive and those bearing 5'- or 3'-terminal phosphates are at least 600-fold less reactive. The requirement for an internal 2'-phosphate can be satisfied by a substrate as small as a dimer."

https://openalex.org/W1536641330,"To approach the question of why insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and insulin have different physiological actions, we developed antibodies directed against cytoplasmic regions of the IGF-I receptor exhibiting a low degree of homology with the corresponding sequences of the insulin receptor. We found that an antipeptide antibody directed against the beta-subunit carboxyl-terminal sequence (1232-1246) of the IGF-I receptor significantly reduced the in vitro receptor autophosphorylation. The ability of the synthetic peptide corresponding to the IGF-I receptor sequence 1232-1246 to abolish this inhibitory effect reflects the specific nature of the antibody interaction with the targeted domain in the receptor. Antipeptide antibody to IGF-I receptor sequence 1232-1246 also decreased receptor phosphorylation activity toward the exogenous substrate poly(Glu/Tyr). The reduction in poly(Glu/Tyr) phosphorylation was seen even when the antibody was incubated with a receptor previously activated and phosphorylated. Therefore, the inhibitory action on substrate phosphorylation is likely to be unrelated to the antibody reduction of receptor autophosphorylation but rather results from a global decrease in receptor enzymatic activity. The effect of the antipeptide antibody on receptor tyrosine kinase cannot be accounted for by a lowering of the receptor Km for ATP or of its affinity for the substrate poly(Glu/Tyr). Moreover, the interaction of the antibody with the receptor had no repercussion on the ligand binding site as shown by the unaltered IGF-I binding. Taken together our data suggest that the beta-subunit carboxyl-terminal domain of the IGF-I receptor plays a key role in regulating its kinase activity and that the particular sequence recognized by our antipeptide antibody could be involved in negative regulation of receptor functioning."

The association constants obtained from the fluorimetric titrations and the temperature jump experiments range between 3.1 x 10(6) M-1 and 4.3 x 10(6) M-1, indicating that the binding of the mononucleotides to the specific binding site of ribonuclease T1 is at least one order of magnitude tighter than has been anticipated so far.

Molecular modeling studies indicate that all three nucleotides are able to bind via their phosphate group to a positively charged array of surface amino acids including His27, His40, Lys41, and most probably Lys25 without obvious stereochemical hindrance. We propose that RNA wraps around RNase T1 in a similar fashion via phosphate binding when enzymatic hydrolysis occurs."
