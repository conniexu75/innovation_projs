https://openalex.org/W2577934610,"The chemical conversion of N-heterocyclic carbene molecules attached to catalytic particles is monitored at high spatial resolution using synchrotron-radiation-based infrared nanospectroscopy. By mapping the catalytic reactivity of single nanoparticles, it is possible to directly reveal structure–reactivity correlations at the nanoscale. Now Dean Toste, Elad Gross and colleagues address this goal through detailed high-spatial-resolution spectral imaging of catalytic reactions on the surface of single platinum nanoparticles. The authors attach stable molecules carrying a functional chemical group to catalyst particles, and monitor the conversion of the functional group by using near-field infrared spectroscopy with synchrotron light. The approach shows that, compared with flat regions on the top of the particles, their peripheries — which contain metal atoms with low coordination numbers — are more active in catalysing oxidation and reduction reactions. The critical role in surface reactions and heterogeneous catalysis of metal atoms with low coordination numbers, such as found at atomic steps and surface defects, is firmly established1,2. But despite the growing availability of tools that enable detailed in situ characterization3, so far it has not been possible to document this role directly. Surface properties can be mapped with high spatial resolution, and catalytic conversion can be tracked with a clear chemical signature; however, the combination of the two, which would enable high-spatial-resolution detection of reactions on catalytic surfaces, has rarely been achieved. Single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy has been used to image and characterize single turnover sites at catalytic surfaces4,5, but is restricted to reactions that generate highly fluorescing product molecules. Herein the chemical conversion of N-heterocyclic carbene molecules attached to catalytic particles is mapped using synchrotron-radiation-based infrared nanospectroscopy6,7 with a spatial resolution of 25 nanometres, which enabled particle regions that differ in reactivity to be distinguished. These observations demonstrate that, compared to the flat regions on top of the particles, the peripheries of the particles—which contain metal atoms with low coordination numbers—are more active in catalysing oxidation and reduction of chemically active groups in surface-anchored N-heterocyclic carbene molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2569724653,"Ablation of the large tumour suppressor kinases 1 and 2 promotes a luminal breast cell phenotype through stabilization of oestrogen receptor-α, thereby changing human breast cell fate. To investigate the development of human breast cancer, Mohamed Bentires-Alj and colleagues analyse which type of human breast cells give rise to cancer, and look at how tumour regulators affect the fate of both luminal epithelial and basal myoepithelial progenitors and differentiated cells. They carried out an image-based screen looking for the effects of silencing tumour suppressors. They find that the absence of members of the Hippo signalling pathways stabilizes oestrogen receptor-α signalling components to promote a luminal phenotype and increase the number of progenitors. Cell fate perturbations underlie many human diseases, including breast cancer1,2. Unfortunately, the mechanisms by which breast cell fate are regulated are largely unknown. The mammary gland epithelium consists of differentiated luminal epithelial and basal myoepithelial cells, as well as undifferentiated stem cells and more restricted progenitors3,4. Breast cancer originates from this epithelium, but the molecular mechanisms that underlie breast epithelial hierarchy remain ill-defined. Here, we use a high-content confocal image-based short hairpin RNA screen to identify tumour suppressors that regulate breast cell fate in primary human breast epithelial cells. We show that ablation of the large tumour suppressor kinases (LATS) 1 and 2 (refs 5, 6), which are part of the Hippo pathway, promotes the luminal phenotype and increases the number of bipotent and luminal progenitors, the proposed cells-of-origin of most human breast cancers. Mechanistically, we have identified a direct interaction between Hippo and oestrogen receptor-α (ERα) signalling. In the presence of LATS, ERα was targeted for ubiquitination and Ddb1–cullin4-associated-factor 1 (DCAF1)-dependent proteasomal degradation. Absence of LATS stabilized ERα and the Hippo effectors YAP and TAZ (hereafter YAP/TAZ), which together control breast cell fate through intrinsic and paracrine mechanisms. Our findings reveal a non-canonical (that is, YAP/TAZ-independent) effect of LATS in the regulation of human breast cell fate."
https://openalex.org/W2568525740,"Diabetic macular ischemia (DMI) is a phenotype of diabetic retinopathy (DR) associated with chronic hypoxia of retinal tissue. The goal of this prospective observational study was to report evidence of photoreceptor abnormalities using adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) in eyes with DR in the setting of deep capillary plexus (DCP) non-perfusion. Eleven eyes from 11 patients (6 women, age 31-68), diagnosed with DR without macular edema, underwent optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and AOSLO imaging. One patient without OCTA imaging underwent fluorescein angiography to characterize the enlargement of the foveal avascular zone. The parameters studied included photoreceptor heterogeneity packing index (HPi) on AOSLO, as well as DCP non-perfusion and vessel density on OCTA. Using AOSLO, OCTA and spectral domain (SD)-OCT, we observed that photoreceptor abnormalities on AOSLO and SD-OCT were found in eyes with non-perfusion of the DCP on OCTA. All eight eyes with DCP non-flow on OCTA showed photoreceptor abnormalities on AOSLO. Six of the eight eyes also had outer retinal abnormalities on SD-OCT. Three eyes with DR and robust capillary perfusion of the DCP had normal photoreceptors on SD-OCT and AOSLO. Compared to eyes with DR without DCP non-flow, the eight eyes with DCP non-flow had significantly lower HPi (P = 0.013) and parafoveal DCP vessel density (P = 0.016). We found a significant correlation between cone HPi and parafoveal DCP vessel density (r = 0.681, P = 0.030). Using a novel approach with AOSLO and OCTA, this study shows an association between capillary non-perfusion of the DCP and abnormalities in the photoreceptor layer in eyes with DR. This observation is important in confirming the significant contribution of the DCP to oxygen requirements of photoreceptors in DMI, while highlighting the ability of AOSLO to detect subtle photoreceptor changes not always visible on SD-OCT."

https://openalex.org/W2569052016,"Macrocyclic compounds are central to the development of new drugs, but preparing them can be challenging because of the energy barrier that must be surmounted in order to bring together and fuse the two ends of an acyclic precursor such as an alkene (also known as an olefin). To this end, the catalytic process known as ring-closing metathesis (RCM) has allowed access to countless biologically active macrocyclic organic molecules, even for large-scale production. Stereoselectivity is often critical in such cases: the potency of a macrocyclic compound can depend on the stereochemistry of its alkene; alternatively, one isomer of the compound can be subjected to stereoselective modification (such as dihydroxylation). Kinetically controlled Z-selective RCM reactions have been reported, but the only available metathesis approach for accessing macrocyclic E-olefins entails selective removal of the Z-component of a stereoisomeric mixture by ethenolysis, sacrificing substantial quantities of material if E/Z ratios are near unity. Use of ethylene can also cause adventitious olefin isomerization-a particularly serious problem when the E-alkene is energetically less favoured. Here, we show that dienes containing an E-alkenyl-B(pinacolato) group, widely used in catalytic cross-coupling, possess the requisite electronic and steric attributes to allow them to be converted stereoselectively to E-macrocyclic alkenes. The reaction is promoted by a molybdenum monoaryloxide pyrrolide complex and affords products at a yield of up to 73 per cent and an E/Z ratio greater than 98/2. We highlight the utility of the approach by preparing recifeiolide (a 12-membered-ring antibiotic) and pacritinib (an 18-membered-ring enzyme inhibitor), the Z-isomer of which is less potent than the E-isomer. Notably, the 18-membered-ring moiety of pacritinib-a potent anti-cancer agent that is in advanced clinical trials for treating lymphoma and myelofibrosis-was prepared by RCM carried out at a substrate concentration 20 times greater than when a ruthenium carbene was used."
https://openalex.org/W2567793122,"Maintenance of glucose homeostasis is essential for normal physiology. Deviation from normal glucose levels, in either direction, increases susceptibility to serious medical complications such as hypoglycemia and diabetes. Maintenance of glucose homeostasis is achieved via functional interactions among various organs: liver, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, brain, and the endocrine pancreas. The liver is the primary site of endogenous glucose production, especially during states of prolonged fasting. However, enhanced gluconeogenesis is also a signature feature of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Thus, elucidating the signaling pathways that regulate hepatic gluconeogenesis would allow better insight into the process of normal endogenous glucose production as well as how this process is impaired in T2D. Here we demonstrate that the TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling pathway promotes hepatic gluconeogenesis, both upon prolonged fasting and during T2D. In contrast, genetic and pharmacological inhibition of TGF-β1/Smad3 signals suppressed endogenous glucose production. TGF-β1 and Smad3 signals achieved this effect via the targeting of key regulators of hepatic gluconeogenesis, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and FoxO1 proteins. Specifically, TGF-β1 signaling suppressed the LKB1-AMPK axis, thereby facilitating the nuclear translocation of FoxO1 and activation of key gluconeogenic genes, glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. These findings underscore an important role of TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling in hepatic gluconeogenesis, both in normal physiology and in the pathophysiology of metabolic diseases such as diabetes, and are thus of significant medical relevance.

https://openalex.org/W2568667547,"Their relatively slow rates of molecular evolution, as well as frequent exposure to hybridization and introgression, often make it difficult to discriminate species of vascular plants with the standard barcode markers (rbcL, matK, ITS2). Previous studies have examined these constraints in narrow geographic or taxonomic contexts, but the present investigation expands analysis to consider the performance of these gene regions in discriminating the species in local floras at sites across Canada. To test identification success, we employed a DNA barcode reference library with sequence records for 96% of the 5108 vascular plant species known from Canada, but coverage varied from 94% for rbcL to 60% for ITS2 and 39% for matK. Using plant lists from 27 national parks and one scientific reserve, we tested the efficacy of DNA barcodes in identifying the plants in simulated species assemblages from six biogeographic regions of Canada using BLAST and mothur. Mean pairwise distance (MPD) and mean nearest taxon distance (MNTD) were strong predictors of barcode performance for different plant families and genera, and both metrics supported ITS2 as possessing the highest genetic diversity. All three genes performed strongly in assigning the taxa present in local floras to the correct genus with values ranging from 91% for rbcL to 97% for ITS2 and 98% for matK. However, matK delivered the highest species discrimination (~81%) followed by ITS2 (~72%) and rbcL (~44%). Despite the low number of plant taxa in the Canadian Arctic, DNA barcodes had the least success in discriminating species from this biogeographic region with resolution ranging from 36% with rbcL to 69% with matK. Species resolution was higher in the other settings, peaking in the Woodland region at 52% for rbcL and 87% for matK. Our results indicate that DNA barcoding is very effective in identifying Canadian plants to a genus, and that it performs well in discriminating species in regions where floristic diversity is highest."
https://openalex.org/W2568891751,"Rapid detection of abnormal biological values using point-of-care (POC) testing allows clinicians to promptly initiate therapy; however, there are concerns regarding the reliability of POC measurements. We investigated the agreement between the latest generation blood gas analyzer and central laboratory measurements of electrolytes, bicarbonate, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and glucose.314 paired samples were collected prospectively from 51 critically ill patients. All samples were drawn simultaneously in the morning from an arterial line. BD Vacutainer tubes were analyzed in the central laboratory using Beckman Coulter analyzers (AU 5800 and DxH 800). BD Preset 3 ml heparinized-syringes were analyzed immediately in the ICU using the POC Siemens RAPIDPoint 500 blood gas system. We used CLIA proficiency testing criteria to define acceptable analytical performance and interchangeability.Biases, limits of agreement (±1.96 SD) and coefficients of correlation were respectively: 1.3 (-2.2 to 4.8 mmol/L, r = 0.936) for sodium; 0.2 (-0.2 to 0.6 mmol/L, r = 0.944) for potassium; -0.9 (-3.7 to 2 mmol/L, r = 0.967) for chloride; 0.8 (-1.9 to 3.4 mmol/L, r = 0.968) for bicarbonate; -11 (-30 to 9 mg/dL, r = 0.972) for glucose; -0.8 (-1.4 to -0.2 g/dL, r = 0.985) for hemoglobin; and -1.1 (-2.9 to 0.7%, r = 0.981) for hematocrit. All differences were below CLIA cut-off values, except for hemoglobin.Compared to central Laboratory analyzers, the POC Siemens RAPIDPoint 500 blood gas system satisfied the CLIA criteria of interchangeability for all tested parameters, except for hemoglobin. These results are warranted for our own procedures and devices. Bearing these restrictions, we recommend clinicians to initiate an appropriate therapy based on POC testing without awaiting a control measurement."
https://openalex.org/W2567776014,"Cardioprotection of dexrazoxane (DZR) against doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiotoxicity is contentious and the indicator is controversial. A pairwise comparative metabolomics approach was used to delineate the potential metabolic processes in the present study. Ninety-six BALB/c mice were randomly divided into two supergroups: tumor and control groups. Each supergroup was divided into control, DOX, DZR, and DOX plus DZR treatment groups. DOX treatment resulted in a steady increase in 5-hydroxylysine, 2-hydroxybutyrate, 2-oxoglutarate, 3-hydroxybutyrate, and decrease in glucose, glutamate, cysteine, acetone, methionine, asparate, isoleucine, and glycylproline.DZR treatment led to increase in lactate, 3-hydroxybutyrate, glutamate, alanine, and decrease in glucose, trimethylamine N-oxide and carnosine levels. These metabolites represent potential biomarkers for early prediction of cardiotoxicity of DOX and the cardioprotective evaluation of DZR."

https://openalex.org/W2568194799,"In this study, we focus on the possible roles of second-order syntactic recursion and working memory in terms of simple and complex span tasks in the development of second-order false belief reasoning. We tested 89 Turkish children in two age groups, one younger (4;6–6;5 years) and one older (6;7–8;10 years). Although second-order syntactic recursion is significantly correlated with the second-order false belief task, results of ordinal logistic regressions revealed that the main predictor of second-order false belief reasoning is complex working memory span. Unlike simple working memory and second-order syntactic recursion tasks, the complex working memory task required processing information serially with additional reasoning demands that require complex working memory strategies. Based on our results, we propose that children’s second-order theory of mind develops when they have efficient reasoning rules to process embedded beliefs serially, thus overcoming a possible serial processing bottleneck."
https://openalex.org/W2568204381,"The cysteine-rich, cationic, antifungal protein PAF is abundantly secreted into the culture supernatant of the filamentous Ascomycete Penicillium chrysogenum. The five β-strands of PAF form a compact β-barrel that is stabilized by three disulphide bonds. The folding of PAF allows the formation of four surface-exposed loops and distinct charged motifs on the protein surface that might regulate the interaction of PAF with the sensitive target fungus. The growth inhibitory activity of this highly stable protein against opportunistic fungal pathogens provides great potential in antifungal drug research. To understand its mode of action, we started to investigate the surface-exposed loops of PAF and replaced one aspartic acid at position 19 in loop 2 that is potentially involved in PAF active or binding site, with a serine (Asp19 to Ser19). We analysed the overall effects, such as unfolding, electrostatic changes, sporadic conformers and antifungal activity when substituting this specific amino acid to the fairly indifferent amino acid serine. Structural analyses revealed that the overall 3D solution structure is virtually identical with that of PAF. However, PAFD19S showed slightly increased dynamics and significant differences in the surface charge distribution. Thermal unfolding identified PAFD19S to be rather a two-state folder in contrast to the three-state folder PAF. Functional comparison of PAFD19S and PAF revealed that the exchange at residue 19 caused a dramatic loss of antifungal activity: the binding and internalization of PAFD19S by target cells was reduced and the protein failed to trigger an intracellular Ca2+ response, all of which are closely linked to the antifungal toxicity of PAF. We conclude that the negatively charged residue Asp19 in loop 2 is essential for full function of the cationic protein PAF."
https://openalex.org/W2571198280,"Familial apparently balanced translocations (ABTs) segregating with discordant phenotypes are extremely challenging for interpretation and counseling due to the scarcity of publications and lack of routine techniques for quick investigation. Recently, next generation sequencing has emerged as an efficacious methodology for precise detection of translocation breakpoints. However, studies so far have mainly focused on de novo translocations. The present study focuses specifically on familial cases in order to shed some light to this diagnostic dilemma. Whole-genome mate-pair sequencing (WG-MPS) was applied to map the breakpoints in nine two-way ABT carriers from four families. Translocation breakpoints and patient-specific structural variants were validated by Sanger sequencing and quantitative Real Time PCR, respectively. Identical sequencing patterns and breakpoints were identified in affected and non-affected members carrying the same translocations. PTCD1, ATP5J2-PTCD1, CADPS2, and STPG1 were disrupted by the translocations in three families, rendering them initially as possible disease candidate genes. However, subsequent mutation screening and structural variant analysis did not reveal any pathogenic mutations or unique variants in the affected individuals that could explain the phenotypic differences between carriers of the same translocations. In conclusion, we suggest that NGS-based methods, such as WG-MPS, can be successfully used for detailed mapping of translocation breakpoints, which can also be used in routine clinical investigation of ABT cases. Unlike de novo translocations, no associations were determined here between familial two-way ABTs and the phenotype of the affected members, in which the presence of cryptic imbalances and complex chromosomal rearrangements has been excluded. Future whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing will potentially reveal unidentified mutations in the patients underlying the discordant phenotypes within each family. In addition, larger studies are needed to determine the exact percentage for phenotypic risk in families with ABTs."

https://openalex.org/W2567925974,"Due to the huge number of neuronal cells in the brain and their complex circuit formation, computer simulation of neuronal activity is indispensable to understanding whole brain dynamics. Recently, various computational models have been developed based on whole-brain calcium imaging data. However, these analyses monitor only the activity of neuronal cell bodies and treat the cells as point unit. This point-neuron model is inexpensive in computational costs, but the model is unrealistically simplistic at representing intact neural activities in the brain. Here, we describe a novel three-unit Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) model based on the neuronal responses derived from a Caenorhabditis elegans salt-sensing neuron. We recorded calcium responses in three regions of the ASER neuron using a simple downstep of NaCl concentration. Our simple ODE model generated from a single recording can adequately reproduce and predict the temporal responses of each part of the neuron to various types of NaCl concentration changes. Our strategy which combines a simple recording data and an ODE mathematical model may be extended to realistically understand whole brain dynamics by computational simulation."
https://openalex.org/W2569765060,"The ExoU type III secretion enzyme is a potent phospholipase A2 secreted by the Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa Activation of phospholipase activity is induced by protein-protein interactions with ubiquitin in the cytosol of a targeted eukaryotic cell, leading to destruction of host cell membranes. Previous work in our laboratory suggested that conformational changes within a C-terminal domain of the toxin might be involved in the activation mechanism. In this study, we use site-directed spin-labeling electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to investigate conformational changes in a C-terminal four-helical bundle region of ExoU as it interacts with lipid substrates and ubiquitin, and to examine the localization of this domain with respect to the lipid bilayer. In the absence of ubiquitin or substrate liposomes, the overall structure of the C-terminal domain is in good agreement with crystallographic models derived from ExoU in complex with its chaperone, SpcU. Significant conformational changes are observed throughout the domain in the presence of ubiquitin and liposomes combined that are not observed with either liposomes or ubiquitin alone. In the presence of ubiquitin, two interhelical loops of the C-terminal four-helix bundle appear to penetrate the membrane bilayer, stabilizing ExoU-membrane association. Thus, ubiquitin and the substrate lipid bilayer act synergistically to induce a conformational rearrangement in the C-terminal domain of ExoU."

The aims of this study were to study the p-cymene metabolism in the model aromatic-degrading bacterium Burkholderia xenovorans LB400, and its response to p-cymene. The catabolic p-cymene (cym) and p-cumate (cmt) genes are clustered on the LB400 major chromosome. B. xenovorans LB400 was able to grow on p-cymene as well as on p-cumate as a sole carbon and energy sources. LB400 growth attained higher cell concentration at stationary phase on p-cumate than on p-cymene. The transcription of the key cymAb and cmtAb genes, and p-cumate dioxygenase activity were observed in LB400 cells grown on p-cymene and on p-cumate, but not in glucose-grown cells. Diverse changes on LB400 proteome were observed in p-cymene-grown cells compared to glucose-grown cells. An increase of the molecular chaperones DnaK, GroEL and ClpB, the organic hydroperoxide resistance protein Ohr, the alkyl hydroperoxide reductase AhpC and the copper oxidase CopA during growth on p-cymene strongly suggests that the exposure to p-cymene constitutes a stress condition for strain LB400. Diverse proteins of the energy metabolism such as enolase, pyruvate kinase, aconitase AcnA, succinyl-CoA synthetase beta subunit and ATP synthase beta subunit were induced by p-cymene. Electron microscopy showed that p-cymene-grown cells exhibited fuzzy outer and inner membranes and an increased periplasm. p-Cymene induced diverse membrane and transport proteins including the p-cymene transporter CymD. Biofilm formation was reduced during growth in p-cymene in strain LB400 compared to glucose-grown cells that may be associated with a decrease of diguanylate cyclase protein levels. Overall, these results indicate active p-cymene and p-cumate catabolic pathways in B. xenovorans LB400. In addition, this study showed that p-cymene activated a stress response in strain LB400 and reduced its biofilm formation."
https://openalex.org/W2568744585,"Rhomboid proteases are increasingly being explored as potential drug targets, but their potent and specific inhibitors are not available, and strategies for inhibitor development are hampered by the lack of widely usable and easily modifiable in vitro activity assays. Here we address this bottleneck and report on the development of new fluorogenic transmembrane peptide substrates, which are cleaved by several unrelated rhomboid proteases, can be used both in detergent micelles and in liposomes, and contain red-shifted fluorophores that are suitable for high-throughput screening of compound libraries. We show that nearly the entire transmembrane domain of the substrate is important for efficient cleavage, implying that it extensively interacts with the enzyme. Importantly, we demonstrate that in the detergent micelle system, commonly used for the enzymatic analyses of intramembrane proteolysis, the cleavage rate strongly depends on detergent concentration, because the reaction proceeds only in the micelles. Furthermore, we show that the catalytic efficiency and selectivity toward a rhomboid substrate can be dramatically improved by targeted modification of the sequence of its P5 to P1 region. The fluorogenic substrates that we describe and their sequence variants should find wide use in the detection of activity and development of inhibitors of rhomboid proteases."
https://openalex.org/W2569318054,"Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) has been recognized recently as an endothelium-dependent vasodilator, but several lines of evidence indicate that it may also stimulate vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), thereby contributing to vasoregulation and remodeling. In the present study, mRNA expression of all 6 LPA receptor genes was detected in murine aortic VSMCs, with the highest levels of LPA1, LPA2, LPA4, and LPA6. In endothelium-denuded thoracic aorta (TA) and abdominal aorta (AA) segments, 1-oleoyl-LPA and the LPA1–3 agonist VPC31143 induced dose-dependent vasoconstriction. VPC31143-induced AA contraction was sensitive to pertussis toxin (PTX), the LPA1&3 antagonist Ki16425, and genetic deletion of LPA1 but not that of LPA2 or inhibition of LPA3, by diacylglycerol pyro-phosphate. Surprisingly, vasoconstriction was also diminished in vessels lacking cyclooxygenase-1 [COX1 knockout (KO)] or the thromboxane prostanoid (TP) receptor (TP KO). VPC31143 increased thromboxane A2 (TXA2) release from TA of wild-type, TP-KO, and LPA2-KO mice but not from LPA1-KO or COX1-KO mice, and PTX blocked this effect. Our findings indicate that LPA causes vasoconstriction in VSMCs, mediated by LPA1-, Gi-, and COX1-dependent autocrine/paracrine TXA2 release and consequent TP activation. We propose that this new-found interaction between the LPA/LPA1 and TXA2/TP pathways plays significant roles in vasoregulation, hemostasis, thrombosis, and vascular remodeling. —Dancs, P.

The presence of minor N-linked glycans containing sialic acid lactone residues (NeuAcLac) was observed in the biosimilar for the first time, which could influence the quantitative analysis of sialylated glycans and interfere with quantification of neutral glycans when it was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography fluorescence (HPLC-FL). To overcome this issue, mild alkali treatment was used to hydrolyze lactone of the sialic acid to their neutral formation, which had no impact on the analysis of other glycans before and after the treatment. As a result, the mild alkali treatment might be helpful to obtain quantitative glycan profiling of the mAbs drugs with enhanced accuracy and robustness."

However, the effects of the combined treatment of vitamin C and melatonin on the differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have not yet been examined. In this study, we showed that melatonin synergizes with vitamin C to derail exit from pluripotency of mouse ESCs. This effect is related to the increased uptake of dehydroascorbate, the oxidized form of vitamin C, through glucose transporter 1 (Glut1) transporter, which in turn, is upregulated by melatonin treatment. Analysis of the cell signaling pathway profiling systems and specific pathway inhibition indicated that melatonin enhances Glut1 expression by activating the PI3K/ AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways.

https://openalex.org/W2569061709,"The structural and biophysical properties typically associated with G-quadruplex (G4) structures render them a significant block for DNA replication, which must be overcome for cell division to occur. The Werner syndrome protein (WRN) is a RecQ family helicase that has been implicated in the efficient processing of G4 DNA structures. The aim of this study was to identify the residues of WRN involved in the binding and ATPase-driven unwinding of G4 DNA. Using a c-Myc G4 DNA model sequence and recombinant WRN, we have determined that the RecQ-C-terminal (RQC) domain of WRN imparts a 2-fold preference for binding to G4 DNA relative to non-G4 DNA substrates. NMR studies identified residues involved specifically in interactions with G4 DNA. Three of the amino acids in the WRN RQC domain that exhibited the largest G4-specific changes in NMR signal were then mutated alone or in combination. Mutating individual residues implicated in G4 binding had a modest effect on WRN binding to DNA, decreasing the preference for G4 substrates by ∼25%. Mutating two G4-interacting residues (T1024G and T1086G) abrogated preferential binding of WRN to G4 DNA. Very modest decreases in G4 DNA-stimulated ATPase activity were observed for the mutant enzymes. Most strikingly, G4 unwinding by WRN was inhibited ∼50% for all three point mutants and >90% for the WRN double mutant (T1024G/T1086G) relative to normal B-form dsDNA substrates. Our work has helped to identify residues in the WRN RQC domain that are involved specifically in the interaction with G4 DNA.

The aim of this study was to identify the residues of WRN involved in the binding and ATPase-driven unwinding of G4 DNA. Using a c-Myc G4 DNA model sequence and recombinant WRN, we have determined that the RecQ-C-terminal (RQC) domain of WRN imparts a 2-fold preference for binding to G4 DNA relative to non-G4 DNA substrates. NMR studies identified residues involved specifically in interactions with G4 DNA. Three of the amino acids in the WRN RQC domain that exhibited the largest G4-specific changes in NMR signal were then mutated alone or in combination. Mutating individual residues implicated in G4 binding had a modest effect on WRN binding to DNA, decreasing the preference for G4 substrates by ∼25%. Mutating two G4-interacting residues (T1024G and T1086G) abrogated preferential binding of WRN to G4 DNA. Very modest decreases in G4 DNA-stimulated ATPase activity were observed for the mutant enzymes. Most strikingly, G4 unwinding by WRN was inhibited ∼50% for all three point mutants and >90% for the WRN double mutant (T1024G/T1086G) relative to normal B-form dsDNA substrates. Our work has helped to identify residues in the WRN RQC domain that are involved specifically in the interaction with G4 DNA."

This is also found in maternal micro-nutrition deficiency, especial chromium which is a key glucose regulator. We investigated whether maternal chromium restriction contributes to the development of diabetes in offspring by affecting DNA methylation status in liver tissue. After being mated with control males, female weanling 8-week-old C57BL mice were fed a control diet (CON, 1.19 mg chromium/kg diet) or a low chromium diet (LC, 0.14 mg chromium/kg diet) during pregnancy and lactation. After weaning, some offspring were shifted to the other diet (CON-LC, or LC-CON), while others remained on the same diet (CON-CON, or LC-LC) for 29 weeks. Fasting blood glucose, serum insulin, and oral glucose tolerance test was performed to evaluate the glucose metabolism condition. Methylation differences in liver from the LC-CON group and CON-CON groups were studied by using a DNA methylation array. Bisulfite sequencing was carried out to validate the results of the methylation array. Maternal chromium limitation diet increased the body weight, blood glucose, and serum insulin levels. Even when switched to the control diet after weaning, the offspring also showed impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. DNA methylation profiling of the offspring livers revealed 935 differentially methylated genes in livers of the maternal chromium restriction diet group. Pathway analysis identified the insulin signaling pathway was the main process affected by hypermethylated genes. Bisulfite sequencing confirmed that some genes in insulin signaling pathway were hypermethylated in livers of the LC-CON and LC-LC group. Accordingly, the expression of genes in insulin signaling pathway was downregulated. There findings suggest that maternal chromium restriction diet results in glucose intolerance in male offspring through alterations in DNA methylation which is associated with the insulin signaling pathway in the mice livers."

The etiology of AD and its underlying mechanism are still not clear. In a previous study, we found that an ethyl acetate extract of Centipedegrass (CG) (i.e., EA-CG) contained 4 types of Maysin derivatives, including Luteolin, Isoorientin, Rhamnosylisoorientin, and Derhamnosylmaysin, and showed protective effects against Amyloid beta (Aβ) by inhibiting oligomeric Aβ in cellular and in vitro models. Here, we examined the preventative effects of EA-CG treatment on the Aβ burden in the Tg (Mo/Hu APPswe PS1dE9) AD mouse model. We have investigated the EA-CG efficacy as novel anti-AD likely preventing amyloid plaques using immunofluorescence staining to visually analyze Aβ40/42 and fibril formation with Thioflavin-S or 6E10 which are the profile of immunoreactivity against epitope Aβ1–16 or neuritic plaque, the quantitation of humoral immune response against Aβ, and the inflammatory cytokine responses (Th1 and Th2) using ELISA and QRT-PCR. To minimize the toxicity of the extracted CG, we addressed the liver toxicity in response to the CG extract treatment in Tg mice using relevant markers, such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/ alanine aminotransferase (ALT) measurements in serum. The EA-CG extract significantly reduced the Aβ burden, the concentration of soluble Aβ40/42 protein, and fibril formation in the hippocampus and cortex of the Tg mice treated with EA-CG (50 mg/kg BW/day) for 6 months compared with the Tg mice treated with a normal diet. Additionally, the profile of anti-inflammatory cytokines revealed that the levels of Th2 (interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-10 (IL-10)) cytokines are more significantly increased than Th1 (interferon-γ (IFN-γ), interleukin-2(IL-2)) in the sera. These results suggest that the EA-CG fraction induces IL-4/IL-10-dependent anti-inflammatory cytokines (Th2) rather than pro-inflammatory cytokines (Th1), which are driven by IL-2/IFN-γ. With regard to the immune response, EA-CG induced an immunoglobulin IgG and IgM response against the EA-CG treatment in the Tg mice. Furthermore, EA-CG significantly ameliorated the level of soluble Aβ42 and Aβ40. Similarly, we observed that the fibril formation was also decreased by EA-CG treatment in the hippocampus and cortex after quantitative analysis with Thioflavin-S staining in the Tg brain tissues. Taken together, our findings suggested that Maysin and its derivative flavonoid compounds in the EA-CG fraction might be beneficial therapeutic treatments or alternative preventative measures to adjuvant for boosting humoral and cellular include immune response and anti-inflammation which may lead to amyloid plaque accumulation in Alzheimer’s patients’ brains."

The active, GTP-bound form of Rheb accumulates when TSC1/2 is deactivated by phosphorylation of TSC2 on regulatory sites. Activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt, leading to TSC2 phosphorylation, is the canonical upstream pathway (7Manning B.D. Cantley L.C.

Another complication is that there is a second mechanism by which Akt positively influences mTORC1 activity. Akt phosphorylates proline-rich Akt substrate of 40 kDa (PRAS40), an obligate member of mTORC1 that blocks mTOR kinase activity, leading to sequestration of PRAS40 by 14-3-3 proteins (14Sancak Y.

Akt-mediated neutralization of either TSC1/2 or PRAS40 might be sufficient for activation of mTORC1, and one or the other mechanism might prove dominant in a certain cell/environmental context; however, we considered and tested the alternate possibility that both mechanisms orchestrate mTORC1 activation, as suggested by an important study using purified proteins (14Sancak Y.

Antibodies against Rheb were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (catalog number sc-271509). The pharmacological inhibitors U0126 and Akt inhibitor VIII were from Calbiochem (catalog numbers 662005 and 124017), and rapamycin was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (catalog number R8781). Cells were preincubated with the indicated inhibitor or DMSO control for 40 min prior to growth factor stimulation. The concentrations of the inhibitors used were 10 μm U0126, 10 μm Akt inhibitor VIII, and 100 nm rapamycin. Lipofectamine and PLUS transfection reagents were purchased from Invitrogen (catalog numbers 18324012 and 11514-015). Except where noted otherwise, all other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Cells were grown to ∼80% confluence in 60-mm dishes and serum-starved for 4 h prior to stimulation. Cells were treated with various pharmacological inhibitors or DMSO vehicle control for ∼40 min prior to growth factor stimulation. Cells were lysed in 50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin A, and chymostatin. An aliquot of each clarified lysate was prepared for standard SDS-PAGE, transfer to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Immobilon, EMD Millipore), and immunoblotting with primary and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies and SuperSignal West Femto substrate (Thermo Fisher). Multiple blots comparing lysates prepared on the same day, representing either different inhibitor treatments or different cell variants and respective control conditions, were performed in parallel and exposed at the same time. Chemiluminescence was measured using a SYNGENE G:BOX Chemi XRQ digital imaging system. Densitometry analysis was performed with local background subtraction using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.). All blots yielded single bands with the mobilities expected, and the linearity of the densitometry measurements with respect to analyte amounts was confirmed. Immunoblotting data were first normalized by appropriate loading controls measured for the same lysates. The phospho-protein amount was normalized by the total amount of the same protein, except in the case of phospho-TSC2; blotting of total TSC2 yielded unacceptable variability, and hence total ERK1/2 was used instead. To trend-normalize the data across independent experiments, the data were further scaled by the mean of a small subset of the samples (see Fig. 1B: 1 nm PDGF time course (0, 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min); see Fig. 3A: shNEG time course for each comparison).FIGURE 3Kinetic model of the Akt/mTORC1 signaling axis, trained on quantitative data.

We studied mTORC1 signaling dynamics in mouse fibroblasts stimulated with PDGF (Fig. 1A). In this system, both the Ras/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways are strongly activated, as we have characterized in quantitative detail (20Wang C.-C. Cirit M. Haugh J.M.

Moreover, PDGF receptors mediate activation of type IA PI3Ks via direct, high-avidity recruitment of the p85 regulatory subunits (23Escobedo J.A. Navankasattusas S. Kavanaugh W.M. Milfay D.

Chemical inhibitors were used to assess the relative contributions of Ras/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways to mTORC1 (Fig. 1B). PDGF stimulated robust phosphorylation of S6K1 Thr389, a quintessential substrate of mTORC1, whereas this response was completely blocked by the mTORC1-specific inhibitor, rapamycin. This treatment had no discernible effect on ERK or Akt phosphorylation (even for different PDGF doses and stimulation times; data not shown), consistent with the expected lack of negative feedback. An inhibitor that antagonizes the pleckstrin homology domain of Akt blocked PDGF-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt, TSC2 Thr1462, and PRAS40 Thr246 as expected (Fig. 1, B and C), and this treatment ablated S6K1 phosphorylation as well; in contrast, a MEK inhibitor that blocks activation of ERK had no discernible effect on phospho-S6K1 (Fig. 1B). These results establish PI3K/Akt signaling as the predominant pathway to mTORC1 in our system. This pathway was probed further at the level of system dynamics, considering phosphorylated Akt as the input, phosphorylation of S6K1 as the output, and Akt-dependent phosphorylation of TSC2 and of PRAS40 as key, intermediate steps (Fig. 2). The PDGF dose and stimulation time were systematically varied, and immunoblotting was carefully performed (Fig. 2A) to acquire normalized, quantitative data that reveal a number of characteristic features. Consistent with previous work, Akt phosphorylation is transient, which has been attributed to PDGF depletion and down-regulation of PDGF receptors, showing dose saturation at ∼0.3 nm PDGF-BB (21Cirit M. Wang C.-C. Haugh J.M. Systematic quantification of negative feedback mechanisms in the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling network.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 36736-36744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). S6K1 phosphorylation shows a similar pattern, except with a noticeable kinetic delay and a less dramatic adaptation of the maximal response when compared with Akt (Fig. 2B). By comparison, it is curious that Akt-dependent regulation of TSC2 (Thr(P)1462) and PRAS40 (Thr(P)246) exhibits greater sensitivity to PDGF dose than either the input or the output of the pathway, judging from the relative saturation of the responses observed with 0.03 nm versus 1 nm PDGF-BB; we also examined phosphorylation of PRAS40 on another regulatory site, Ser183 (26Nascimento E.B. Snel M. Guigas B. van der Zon G.C. Kriek J. Maassen J.A. Jazet I.M. Diamant M. Ouwens D.M. Phosphorylation of PRAS40 on Thr246 by PKB/AKT facilitates efficient phosphorylation of Ser183 by mTORC1.Cell. Signal. 2010; 22: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), which increased only modestly in response to PDGF stimulation (Fig. 1B). These distinct kinetics and dose responses suggest that Akt controls mTORC1 activation via mechanisms with complex or counterintuitive properties. To evaluate whether or not the kinetics of the Akt/mTORC1 signaling axis are consistent with the current knowledge of mTORC1 regulation, a simplified mass action model composed of differential equations in time was formulated. The model describes, with a minimal number of adjustable parameters, the recruitment of PI3K, accumulation of phosphoinositides, activation of Akt, parallel phosphorylation of TSC2 and PRAS40 by Akt, and effect of TSC2 phosphorylation on Rheb-GTP (Fig. 3A). To model the activity of mTORC1, leading to phosphorylation of S6K1, we considered mTOR to be in pseudo-equilibrium with two entities. One is unphosphorylated PRAS40, an obligate member of the mTORC1 complex. The other represents either the physical binding of Rheb-GTP or, because the mechanism is currently unclear, an indirect yet proportional effect of Rheb exerted on the complex, e.g. by affecting substrate binding. Importantly, the model allows for these interactions to range from mutually exclusive to synergistic, and thus it can be used to predict the nature of mTORC1 regulation. A Monte Carlo algorithm was used to directly and globally align the model and data set (20Wang C.-C. Cirit M. Haugh J.M. PI3K-dependent crosstalk interactions converge with Ras as quantifiable inputs integrated by Erk.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2009; 5: 246Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 21Cirit M. Wang C.-C. Haugh J.M. Systematic quantification of negative feedback mechanisms in the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling network.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 36736-36744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The goal of this exercise was not to identify a single parameter set that fits the data best (arguably, a fruitless task for models with even modest complexity). Rather, the algorithm collects a large ensemble of parameter sets that fit the data near optimally. This approach allows one to analyze the distributions of the parameter values (supplemental Text S1), but more importantly, it can be used to generate a corresponding ensemble of predictions for various hypothetical scenarios. Before applying the model in this manner, we judged the quality of fit and deemed that the ensemble average of the aligned model output captures all of the aforementioned features of the training data (Fig. 3B). Hence, we assert that the data are indeed consistent with the biochemical mechanisms encoded by the model equations. Alternative models, in which it is assumed that mTORC1 is regulated solely by TSC1/2 or by PRAS40, did not yield a better fit to the data (supplemental Text S1). With a consistent model of the pathway, we sought to analyze the contributions of TSC1/2 and PRAS40 in the putative feedforward loop from Akt to mTORC1. To do so, we designed experiments to perturb those contributions, and in parallel, we used the model and its established ensemble of parameter sets to predict the effects of those perturbations. Seven cell lines were established, each with stable expression of a distinct shRNA: two targeting sequences for each of TSC2, PRAS40, and Rheb, and a non-targeting control. For each targeting shRNA, the extent of protein depletion/knockdown was quantified by immunoblotting, as was the attendant effect on PDGF-stimulated S6K1 phosphorylation kinetics. Depletion of either TSC2 or PRAS40 significantly enhanced S6K1 phosphorylation in cells stimulated with a moderate dose (0.03 nm) of PDGF, whereas depletion of Rheb diminished the response in cells stimulated with a saturating dose (Fig. 4A). In all cases, the effect was magnified according to the extent of protein depletion. We conclude that both modes of mTORC1 regulation, TSC1/2 regulation of Rheb and direct antagonism by PRAS40, contribute substantially in this system. Turning to the model, we accounted for the estimated degree of protein knockdown in each cell line as a corresponding fractional change in the associated kinetic parameter. Adjusted thus, each parameter set in the ensemble was used to predict the phospho-S6K1 time course for each scenario relative to the unperturbed control (the latter time course being used to normalize both the data and the model predictions) (Fig. 4B). The a priori predictions stand in semi-quantitative agreement with the experimental data, validating the modeling approach. Apparently, the dynamic response of the pathway to changing Akt activity, affected by the PDGF dose in the training data set, consistently reflects the sensitivities of mTORC1 to regulation by TSC1/2/Rheb and PRAS40, as probed by the shRNA depletion studies. Two key parameters of the model, α and β, describe how PRAS40 binding regulates mTORC1. The parameter α describes the activity of Rheb-activated mTORC1 with PRAS40 absent relative to a hypothetical state in which mTORC1 is both Rheb-activated and PRAS40-bound. A value of α > 0.5 indicates that PRAS40 binding reduces mTORC1 activity, representing a non-competitive mode of regulation. The parameter β represents the cooperativity of Rheb activation and PRAS40 binding. If β < 1, the two processes are negatively cooperative, representing a competitive mode of regulation by PRAS40 (whereas the processes are independent if β = 1). As discussed in more depth below, the algorithm used to acquire parameter sets consistently selected low values of β (all 104 values are < 0.01), implying that PRAS40 and Rheb-GTP interactions with mTORC1 are mutually exclusive. A separate fit to the training data set was performed with the constraints α = β = 1, considering the non-competitive regulation mechanism. Although the fit to the training data set was only marginally worse with these constraints (supplemental Text S1 and supplemental Fig. S1), the resulting ensemble of parameter sets yielded predictions with a visibly poorer match to the shRNA-mediated depletion experiments (Fig. 4C). To gain further insight into the model predictions, we performed a computational analysis of the steady state, with the variable representing Akt activity artificially held at various fixed values. As anticipated based on inspection of the kinetic data, phosphorylation of TSC2 and of PRAS40 is predicted to be readily saturated with increasing Akt activity, whereas the predicted responses of Rheb-GTP and mTORC1 activity are far less so (Fig. 5A). This is attributed to the indirect mechanism of mTORC1 activation, whereby phosphorylation by Akt neutralizes the negative regulators TSC1/2 and PRAS40. We recently proposed deactivation/neutralization of a negative regulator as a common but as yet underappreciated motif in signaling networks (27Rahman A. Haugh J.M. Deactivation of a negative regulator: a distinct signal transduction mechanism, pronounced in Akt signaling.Biophys. J. 2014; 107: L29-L32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar); the mechanism yields a broader range of sensitivity to the input, beyond saturation of regulator phosphorylation, because it is the unphosphorylated state of the regulator that exerts influence on the pathway (Fig. 5A). This property of the motif is manifest in the model predictions and, accordingly, explains the ability of the model to capture complex features of the kinetic data. We further used the steady-state analysis to explore the status of the mTORC1 complex, revealing another characteristic pattern (Fig. 5B). The model predicts that almost all of the mTORC1 is either PRAS40-bound or in the Rheb-induced state, rather than the so-called free state (neither PRAS-bound nor Rheb-induced). Thus, the implication is that Akt exerts feedforward control of mTORC1 activity via a “seesaw” regulation mechanism, which we define as the concomitant dissociation of PRAS40 and activation of mTORC1 catalytic function through Rheb. Accordingly, the interpretation of the model is that depletion of TSC2, PRAS40, or Rheb perturbs that balance to differing extents, with depletion of Rheb exerting the largest effect (Fig. 5B). What quantitative feature of this regulation mechanism is encoded in the kinetic data? A signature of this mode of regulation is a nonlinear, ultrasensitive response of mTORC1 activity to Akt activation (Fig. 5C). As shown through a mathematical analysis (supplemental Text S1), the maximum sensitivity of the pathway is achieved when mTORC1 activity is proportional to the Rheb-GTP level and inversely proportional to the concentration of unphosphorylated PRAS40; given that PRAS40 phosphorylation is close to saturation, mTORC1 activity is roughly proportional to the Akt activity squared (Fig. 5C), i.e. with a Hill coefficient approaching 2. As mentioned in the previous section, the value of the parameter that determines competition versus synergy between the PRAS40-bound and Rheb-induced states of mTORC1 (β) was consistently chosen such that the two states are mutually exclusive. According to the same mathematical analysis noted above, this is not a necessary condition for ultrasensitivity; the scenario in which PRAS40 regulation of mTORC1 is non-competitive is also capable of ultrasensitivity and is therefore only subtly different from the situation favored by the fitting algorithm. The Akt/mTORC1 signaling axis has attracted great interest because it affects cell growth in normal and cancer cells. In the context of growth factor stimulation, integration of quantitative measurements and mechanistic modeling elucidated the dose-dependent kinetics of the Akt/mTORC1 signaling axis, and the computational model consistently predicted how those kinetics were perturbed experimentally, via shRNA depletion of key regulatory proteins. Thus, the model accounts for the parallel contributions of TSC1/2/Rheb and PRAS40; we have shown that, together, these mechanisms constitute feedforward regulation of mTORC1. Further, model-driven analysis of the pathway revealed two dynamical motifs. One is the neutralization of a negative regulator, which applies to both arms of the feedforward loop; this motif has the distinct property that it gains sensitivity as the neutralizing modification (in this case, phosphorylation by Akt) approaches saturation (27Rahman A. Haugh J.M. Deactivation of a negative regulator: a distinct signal transduction mechanism, pronounced in Akt signaling.Biophys. J. 2014; 107: L29-L32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), explaining key features of the pathway kinetics. The other motif is seesaw regulation, which describes how indirect activation of Rheb and the neutralization of PRAS40 converge to modulate mTORC1 activity in an ultrasensitive manner. Taken together, these systems-level insights offer a framework for comparing mTORC1 regulation across various physiological contexts and in cancer cells with misregulated/rewired signaling networks. One specific prediction of the model that warrants further discussion concerns the state of the mTORC1 complex. Although the precise mechanism by which Rheb activates mTORC1 is still debated (28Wang X. Proud C.G. mTORC1 signaling: what we still don't know.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 3: 206-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), the evidence is consistent with enhanced binding/access by mTORC1 substrates (29Avruch J. Long X. Lin Y. Ortiz-Vega S. Rapley J. Papageorgiou A. Oshiro N. Kikkawa U. Activation of mTORC1 in two steps: Rheb-GTP activation of catalytic function and increased binding of substrates to raptor.Biochem. Soc.

Chem. 2009; 284: 12783-12791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This concept is consistent with the seesaw model, given that bound PRAS40 exerts the opposite effect on substrate binding (16Wang L. Harris T.E. Roth R.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. PRAS40 regulates mTORC1 kinase activity by functioning as a direct inhibitor of substrate binding.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20036-20044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The implication that Rheb and PRAS40 interactions with mTORC1 are mutually exclusive is also supported by experimental findings using purified proteins; Rheb-GTP, when present in vast excess, can counteract the inhibitory effect of PRAS40 (14Sancak Y.

Another distinct possibility is that the Rheb-induced state defined in the model represents mTORC1 in complex with its various substrates, which directly compete with PRAS40 for mTORC1 binding (16Wang L.

We found that knocking down receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 1 (Ripk1) increased both intracellular and extracellular PGRN protein levels by increasing the translation rate of PGRN without affecting mRNA levels. We observed this effect in Neuro2a cells, wild-type primary mouse neurons, and Grn-haploinsufficient primary neurons from an FTD mouse model. We found that the effect of RIPK1 on PGRN is independent of the kinase activity of RIPK1 and occurs through a novel signaling pathway.

The molecular mechanisms that determine the dramatic difference in virulence are unknown, but indirect evidence suggests that different properties of their RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) may at least partially be responsible for the contrasting phenotypes. Here we report that the unusual ability of the RHDV RdRp to induce a striking rearrangement of the Golgi network is not specific to RHDV, but a common feature of virulent and benign rabbit caliciviruses alike. Expression of rabbit calicivirus RdRps induced a redistribution of both cis/medial and medial/trans Golgi membrane markers, but not that of an endoplasmic reticulum membrane marker. Inactivating mutations in the conserved GDD motif did not abolish the ability of RHDV RdRp to rearrange the Golgi network, suggesting that polymerase activity and metal co-factors are not required for this function. Finally, we discuss possible implications of RdRp-induced membrane rearrangements on virus replication and host immune responses."

Thus, antioxidant therapies have gained attention as adjuvants for castration-resistant PCa. Here, we report for the first time that human endostatin (ES) prevents androgen-independent growth phenotype in PCa cells through its molecular targeting of AR and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and downstream pro-oxidant signaling. This reversal after ES treatment significantly decreased PCa cell proliferation through down-regulation of GR and up-regulation of manganese superoxide dismutase and reduced glutathione levels. Proteome and biochemical analyses of ES-treated PCa cells further indicated a significant up-regulation of enzymes in the major reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging machinery, including catalase, glutathione synthetase, glutathione reductase, NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, biliverdin reductase, and thioredoxin reductase, resulting in a concomitant reduction of intracellular ROS. ES further augmented the antioxidant system through up-regulation of glucose influx, the pentose phosphate pathway, and NAD salvaging pathways. This shift in cancer cell redox homeostasis by ES significantly decreased the effect of protumorigenic oxidative machinery on androgen-independent PCa growth, suggesting that ES can suppress GR-induced resistant phenotype upon AR antagonism and that the dual targeting action of ES on AR and GR can be further translated to PCa therapy.-Lee, J.

https://openalex.org/W2569463693,"Propofol is an intravenous anesthetic that produces its anesthetic effect, largely via the GABAA receptor in the CNS, and also reduces the N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP)-induced neutrophil respiratory burst. Because fMLP-stimulated neutrophils produce leukotriene (LT)B4, we examined the effect of propofol on LTB4 production in vivo and in vitro. Cecal ligation and puncture surgery was performed in mice, with or without exposure to propofol. Propofol attenuated the production of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX)-related arachidonic acid (AA) derivatives in the peritoneal fluid. Also, in the in vitro experiments on fMLP-stimulated neutrophils and 5-LOX-transfected human embryonic kidney cells, propofol attenuated the production of 5-LOX-related AA derivatives. Based on these results, we hypothesized that propofol would directly affect 5-LOX function. Using meta-azi-propofol (AziPm), we photolabeled stable 5-LOX protein, which had been used to solve the X-ray crystallographic structure of 5-LOX, and examined the binding site(s) of propofol on 5-LOX. Two propofol binding pockets were identified near the active site of 5-LOX. Alanine scanning mutagenesis was performed for the residues of 5-LOX in the vicinity of propofol, and we evaluated the functional role of these pockets in LTB4 production. We demonstrated that these pockets were functionally important for 5-LOX activity. These two pockets can be used to explore a novel 5-LOX inhibitor in the future. —Okuno, T., Koutsogiannaki, S., Ohba, M., Chamberlain, M., Bu, W., Lin, F.-Y., Eckenhoff, R. G., Yokomizo T., Yuki, K.

https://openalex.org/W2569194618,"As an important enzyme in Phase I drug metabolism, the flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) also metabolizes some xenobiotics with soft nucleophiles. The site of metabolism (SOM) on a molecule is the site where the metabolic reaction is exerted by an enzyme. Accurate prediction of SOMs on drug molecules will assist the search for drug leads during the optimization process. Here, some quantum mechanics features such as the condensed Fukui function and attributes from circular fingerprints (called Molprint2D) are computed and classified using the support vector machine (SVM) for predicting some potential SOMs on a series of drugs that can be metabolized by FMO enzymes. The condensed Fukui function fA− representing the nucleophilicity of central atom A and the attributes from circular fingerprints accounting the influence of neighbors on the central atom. The total number of FMO substrates and non-substrates collected in the study is 85 and they are equally divided into the training and test sets with each carrying roughly the same number of potential SOMs. However, only N-oxidation and S-oxidation features were considered in the prediction since the available C-oxidation data was scarce. In the training process, the LibSVM package of WEKA package and the option of 10-fold cross validation are employed. The prediction performance on the test set evaluated by accuracy, Matthews correlation coefficient and area under ROC curve computed are 0.829, 0.659, and 0.877 respectively. This work reveals that the SVM model built can accurately predict the potential SOMs for drug molecules that are metabolizable by the FMO enzymes."

Three hundred and fifty one cancer patients were recruited from the Affiliated Jiangyin Hospital of Southeast University Medical College and the Nantong Tumor Hospital. One-way ANOVA, Pearson Chi-square tests and regression analysis were employed to identify the correlations between physical exercise and the measured factors. The results showed that occupation type (χ2 = 14.065; p = 0.029), monthly individual monthly income level (χ2 = 24.795; p = 0.003), BMI (χ2 = 15.709; p = 0.015) and diagnosis (χ2 = 42.442; p < 0.000) were significantly correlated with the subjects self-reported exercise with different frequency per week. Differences in the frequency of exercise were associated with different degrees of reported Benefit Finding (BF) (F = 24.651; p < 0.000), communication with doctors (F = 15.285; p < 0.000), medical coping modes (F = 45.912; p < 0.000), social support (F = 2.938; p = 0.030), depression (F = 6.017; p < 0.000), and quality of life (F = 12.288; p < 0.000). Multiple regression analysis showed that 1.6%-6.4% of the variance in five variables, excluding social support and optimism could be explained by exercise. Our results indicated that benefit finding, medical coping modes, communication with doctors, social support, depression and quality of life were significantly correlated with exercise. The variance in several psychosocial factors (benefit finding, medical coping modes, the communication with doctors, depression and quality of life) could be explained by exercise. Psychosocial factors should be addressed and examined over time when evaluating the effect of physical exercise that is prescribed as a clinically relevant treatment."

Bowel wall thickness on MRI is an important biomarker of underlying inflammatory activity, being abnormally increased in the acute phase and reducing in response to successful therapy; however, a poor level of interobserver agreement of measured thickness is reported and therefore a system for accurate, robust and reproducible measurements is desirable. We propose a novel method for estimating bowel wall-thickness to improve the poor interobserver agreement of the manual procedure.
