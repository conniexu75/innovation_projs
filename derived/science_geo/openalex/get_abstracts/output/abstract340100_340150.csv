https://openalex.org/W2170423576,"Fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry has become a powerful structural tool since the first reports of its use in 1981. Samples are ionized in the condensed state, usually in a glycerol matrix, by bombarding the matrix with xenon or argon atoms with energies of 5000 to 10,000 electron volts. This yields both positive and negative secondary ions, which are sputtered from the surface. The technique has been used to detect inorganic ion clusters to mass 25,800 and biologically active peptides to mass 5700, and it gives molecular ions of such highly polar or labile organic compounds as glycosphingolipids and polyene antibiotics. It can be especially valuable in determining the sequences of amino acids in polypeptides."

Various methodologies for the excitation and detection of thermal waves are discussed, and several applications, primarily in microelectronics, are presented."
https://openalex.org/W1983859544,"By using intense pulsed coherent x-ray sources that are currently under development, it will be possible to obtain magnified three-dimensional images of elementary biological structures in the living state at precisely defined instants. For optimum contrast, sensitivity, and resolution, the hologram should be made with x-rays tuned to a resonance of nitrogen near 0.3 nanometer. Resolution will then be limited mainly by the hydrodynamic expansion that occurs while the necessary number of photons is being registered. Problems of technique are also briefly discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2019326214,"Desorption ionization makes it possible to obtain mass spectra of molecules whose vaporization by heating may lead to thermal degradation. Several methods are in use, but in general desorption is achieved by particle or photon bombardment of the sample and the mass spectra obtained by different methods are fundamentally similar. Desorption ionization techniques have been used to obtain mass spectra of biomolecules, including peptides, antibiotics, and oligosaccharides, for which normal mass spectral methods have been of limited power. Several examples are given of recent applications of these new techniques, and prospects for their further evolution are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2089795432,"I have presented an approach to constructing an EQI for Canada. The index was divided into air, water, land, and miscellaneous sections. By noting individual subindices, it is possible to study how environmental conditions vary across the country. By combining the subindices, one can obtain a more crude gauge of the broad state of the environment. As indices and mathematical methods are improved, it may eventually be possible to measure this state in the same way as the economic state of the nation is measured now. The work described herein can be viewed as a simple guide to this measurement."
https://openalex.org/W2095576939,"A linear photodiode array has been used as the photodetector element in a new ultraviolet-visible detection system for high-performance liquid chromatography. This array allows simultaneous acquisition of light intensity data at all wavelengths between 190 and 600 nanometers. By use of a computer network concept in the electronics, this detection system can process eight different chromatographic signals simultaneously in real time and acquire spectra manually or automatically. Detector response times are variable and can be as low as 0.040 second, and bandwidth selection is variable from 4 to 400 nanometers. These characteristics permit fast chromatographic techniques and user-selectable signal-to-noise ratio enhancement. Spectra can be acquired in 10 milliseconds, permitting qualitative characterization at several different points on a single peak without destroying chromatographic signal integrity. Examples illustrate applications in fast high-performance liquid chromatography peak purity determination, and postanalysis data reduction."

Although only an upper limit of 1.3 x 10(18) gauss-cubic centimeters has been determined for the permanent dipole moment in the orbital plane, there is a significant induced dipole moment which opposes the applied field, indicating the existence of a weak lunar ionosphere."

https://openalex.org/W2041460912,"The tests conducted with the three vehicles at different emission control levels suggest that, in the area of fuel economy and emissions, potential benefits with methanol blends are related to carburetion and are only significant in the case of the rich-operating cars built before emission control standards were imposed. Theoretical considerations related to methanol's leaning effect on carburetion support this conclusion. Potential advantages for methanol in these areas are therefore continuously diminishing as the older cars leave the roads. At present, these older cars use only about one-fourth of the totalc motor gasoline consumed and, before methanol could be used on a large scale, this fraction would be much smaller. The use of methanol in gasoline would almost certainly create severe product quality problems. Water contamination could lead to phase separation in the distribution system and possibly in the car tank as well, and this would require additional investment in fuel handling and blending equipment. Excess fuel volatility in hot weather may also have adverse effects on car performance if the methanol blends include typical concentrations of butanes and pentanes. Removal of these light hydrocarbon components would detract from methanol's role as a gasoline extender and if current fuel volatility specifications were maintained, its use could lead to a net loss in the total available energy for use in motor fuels. Car performance problems associated with excessively lean operation would also be expected in the case of a significant proportion of late-model cars which are adjusted to operate on lean fuel-air mixtures. If methanol does become available in large quantities, these factors suggest that it would be more practical to use it for purposes other than those related to the extending of motor gasoline, such as for gas turbines used for electric power generation. In this case, the ""pure"" methanol would act as a cleanburning fuel, having none of the potentially severe product quality problems associated with its use in motor gasoline, while the fuel oil or natural gas cLirrently burned in these tuLrbines CotLild be diverted to other ulses."
https://openalex.org/W1979263779,Approximate numerical radiative calculations show that whether added aerosol causes heating or cooling of the earth-atmosphere system is a function not only of its intrinsic absorption-backscatter characteristics but also of its particular location in the atmosphere with respect to the average cloud as well as of both the cloud reflectivity and the underlying surface reflectivity.
https://openalex.org/W1978169798,"A stratiform, massive copper sulfide deposit with possible gold, silver, and cobalt credits was discovered by a United Nations reconnaissance team in Paleozoic (?) metamorphic terrain of north central Turkey. The deposit, which is of possible volcanigenic exhalative origin, contains evidence of extensive prehistoric underground mining and smelting activity that, based on radiocarbon data, may date to 2800 B.C. (Early Bronze I Age)."

https://openalex.org/W2068900666,"Classical liquid chromatography gave rise 15 years ago to new ideas about high-speed separations. Today, difficult separations can be made almost routinely by use of liquid chromatography instruments with automated controls and sensitive detectors. Sorptive effects are often best achieved with small, porous, ""bonded phase"" particles. The trend is to control the chemical selectivity by means of the liquid phase. These techniques are easily learned, and they have been widely accepted throughout chemistry and its allied disciplines. As a result, liquid chromatography has become the most rapidly expanding branch of the chemical instrumentation field."
https://openalex.org/W1985168247,"There is no relationship between environmental stability [as indicated by infaunal (stable) versus epifaunal (unstable) habits] and the generic duration of extinct marine bivalve mollusks when the effects of cosmopolitanism (which is associated with long generic durations) and other paleontological ""noise"" are excluded. This is contrary to the ""depauperate gene pool"" hypothesis of extinctions."
https://openalex.org/W2019064293,"Commercial electrochemical instrumentation is in a state of mature development. Microprocessors are used mainly as devices for data handling, and there are no commercial computer-based instruments. Progress in the science and proliferation of applications depend on noninstrumental factors such as electrode materials."
