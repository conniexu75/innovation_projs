Because of its intimate involvement in host defense against disease, this transcription factor is an important target for therapeutic intervention. In the present report we demonstrate that curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a known anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic agent, is a potent inhibitor of NF-κB activation. Treatment of human myeloid ML-1a cells with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) rapidly activated NF-κB, which consists of p50 and p65 subunits, and this activation was inhibited by curcumin. AP-1 binding factors were also found to be down-modulated by curcumin, whereas the Sp1 binding factor was unaffected.Besides TNF, curcumin also blocked phorbol ester- and hydrogen peroxide-mediated activation of NF-κB. The TNF-dependent phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα was not observed in curcumin-treated cells; the translocation of p65 subunit to the nucleus was inhibited at the same time. The mechanism of action of curcumin was found to be different from that of protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors. Our results indicate that curcumin inhibits NF-κB activation pathway at a step before IκBα phosphorylation but after the convergence of various stimuli.

Our results indicate that curcumin inhibits NF-κB activation pathway at a step before IκBα phosphorylation but after the convergence of various stimuli. Members of the transcription factor NF-κB family play a central role in various responses leading to host defense, activating a rapid progression of gene expression. These transcription factors are dimeric complexes composed of different members of the Rel/NF-κB family of polypeptides. This family is distinguished by the presence of a Rel homology domain of about 300 amino acids that displays a 35 to 61% identity between various family members (for review, see (1Siebenlist U. Franzo G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar)). Although NF-κB is a ubiquitous transcription factor, it plays a critical role in the cells of the immune system, where it controls the expression of various cytokines and the major histocompatibility complex genes. The inappropriate regulation of NF-κB and its dependent genes have been associated with various pathological conditions including toxic/septic shock, graft versus host reaction, acute inflammatory conditions, acute-phase response, viral replication, radiation damage, atherosclerosis, and cancer(1Siebenlist U. Franzo G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar, 2Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4602) Google Scholar). No wonder NF-κB is an important target for therapeutic intervention. Unlike other transcription factors, the NF-κB proteins and other members of the Rel family reside in the cytoplasm in an inactive state but upon activation, they are translocated to the nucleus. The nuclear translocation of Rel proteins is induced by many agents, including inflammatory cytokines (e.g. tumor necrosis factor (TNF), 1The abbreviations used are: TNFtumor necrosis factorDTTdithiothreitolDMP2,3-dimercaptopropanolHIV-LTRhuman immunodeficiency virus-1 long terminal repeatPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayTPCKL-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketoneROIreactive oxygen intermediates. lymphotoxin, and interleukin-1), mitogens, bacterial products, protein synthesis inhibitors, oxidative stress (H2O2), ultraviolet light, and phorbol esters(3Baeuerle P.A.

Upon activation of NF-κB, a large number of genes are induced including various inflammatory cytokines, adhesion molecules, and Rel proteins (for review, see (3Baeuerle P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 63-80PubMed Google Scholar) and (4Grilli M. Jason J-S. Lenardo M.J. Int. Rev.

Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) has been shown to block many reactions in which NF-κB plays a major role. This agent is a major active component of turmeric (Curcuma longa) and it gives specific flavor and yellow color to curry. The compound has been shown to display anticarcinogenic properties in animals as indicated by its ability to inhibit both tumor initiation induced by benz(α)pyrene and 7,12-dimethylbenz(α)anthracene (5Huang M.T.

Enzyme Regul. 1991; 31: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), which are known to activate NF-κB. Curcumin has also been shown to inhibit type 1 human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat (HIV-LTR) directed gene expression and virus replication stimulated by TNF and phorbol ester(11Li C.J. Zhang L.J. Dezube B.J. Crumpacker C.S. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1839-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), which likewise require NF-κB activation. The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of curcumin have been well documented(12Ammon H.P. Wahl M.A. Planta Med. 1991; 57: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar, 13Satoskar R.P.

Biol. 1980; 18: 73-75PubMed Google Scholar). How these inhibitory responses are modulated by curcumin is not understood. In the present report we show that curcumin is a potent inhibitor of NF-κB activation induced by various agents. The results also indicate that curcumin inhibits at a step in the signal transduction cascade of NF-κB activation that occurs before IκBα phosphorylation but after the point at which various signals transduced by different stimuli converge. This study shows that curcumin is a potential candidate for modulation of NF-κB-dependent pathological conditions. Penicillin, streptomycin, RPMI 1640 medium, and fetal calf serum were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Curcumin, glycine, NaCl, and bovine serum albumin were obtained from Sigma, and phenylarsine oxide from Aldrich. Bacteria-derived recombinant human TNF, purified to homogeneity with a specific activity of 5 × 107 units/mg, was kindly provided by Genentech, Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Antibody against IκBα, cyclin D1, and NF-κB subunits p50 and p65 and double-stranded oligonucleotides having AP-1 and Sp1 consensus sequences were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The cell line employed in this study was ML-1a, a human myelomonoblastic leukemia cell line kindly provided by Dr. Ken Takeda of Showa University, Japan. Cells were routinely grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with glutamine (2 mM), gentamicin (50 μg/ml), and fetal bovine serum (10%). The cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 105 cells/ml in T25 flasks (Falcon 3013, Becton Dickinson Labware, Lincoln Park, NJ) containing 10 ml of medium and grown at 37°C in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Cell cultures were split every 3 or 4 days. Occasionally, cells were tested for mycoplasma contamination using the DNA-based assay kit purchased from Gen-Probe (San Diego, CA). ML-1a cells (2 × 106 cells/ml) were treated separately with different concentrations of an activator at 37°C. Nuclear extracts were then prepared according to Schreiber et al.(15Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 106 cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in 0.4 ml of lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 10 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.0 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.0 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mg/ml benzamidine). The cells were allowed to swell on ice for 15 min, after which 12.5 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added. The tube was then vigorously mixed on a vortex machine for 10 s, and the homogenate was centrifuged for 30 s in a Microfuge E. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 25 μl of ice-cold nuclear extraction buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.0 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.0 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mg/ml benzamidine), and the tube was incubated on ice for 30 min with intermittent mixing. The tube was then centrifuged for 5 min in a Microfuge E at 4°C, and the supernatant (nuclear extract) was either used immediately or stored at −70°C for later use. The protein content was measured by the method of Bradford(16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed by incubating 4 μg of nuclear extract (NE), with 16 fmol of 32P-end-labeled 45-mer double-stranded NF-κB oligonucleotide from the HIV-LTR, 5′-TTGTTACAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGGGAGGCGTGG-3′ (17Nabel G. Baltimore D. Nature. 1987; 326: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar), for 15 min at 37°C. The incubation mixture included 2-3 μg of poly(dI-dC) in a binding buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, and 50 mM NaCl)(18Collart M.A. Baeuerle P. Vassalli P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1498-1506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hassanain H.H. Dai W. Gupta S.L. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 213: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The DNA-protein complex formed was separated from free oligonucleotide on 4.5% native polyacrylamide gel using buffer containing 50 mM Tris, 200 mM glycine, pH 8.5, and 1 mM EDTA(20Singh H. LeBowitz J.H. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1988; 52: 415-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), and then the gel was dried. A double-stranded mutated oligonucleotide, 5′-TTGTTACAACTCACTTTCCGCTGCTCACTTTCCAGGGAGGCGTGG-3′, was used to examine the specificity of binding of NF-κB to the DNA. The specificity of binding was also examined by competition with the unlabeled oligonucleotide. For supershift assays, nuclear extracts prepared from TNF-treated cells were incubated with the antibodies against either p50 or p65 subunits of NF-κB for 30 min at room temperature before the complex was analyzed by EMSA(21Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10631-10639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Antibodies against cyclin D1 and preimmune serum were included as negative controls. The EMSAs for AP-1 and Sp1 were performed as described for NF-κB using 32P-end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides. Specificity of binding was determined routinely by using an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide for competition as described earlier(21Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10631-10639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Visualization and quantitation of radioactive bands was carried out by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) using “Image-quant” software. After the NF-κB activation reaction described above, postnuclear extracts were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for IκBα. To determine p65 levels, nuclear and postnuclear (cytoplasmic) extracts were resolved on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After the gels, the proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose filters, probed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against IκBα or against p65, and detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham)(22Reddy S.A.G. Chaturvedi M.M. Darnay B.G. Chan H. Higuchi M. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25369-25372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bands obtained were quantitated using Personal Densitometer Scan v1.30 using Image Quanta software version 3.3 (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). In this report we examined the effect of curcumin on the activation of transcription factor NF-κB. We used human ML-1a cells for these studies because their response to NF-κB activation by various stimuli has been well characterized(21Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10631-10639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 22Reddy S.A.G. Chaturvedi M.M. Darnay B.G. Chan H. Higuchi M. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 14575-14583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The time of incubation and the concentration of the drugs used in our studies had no effect on the cell viability (data not shown). ML-1a cells were preincubated for 1 h with different concentrations of curcumin followed by treatment with TNF (0.1 nM) for 30 min at 37°C. They were then examined for NF-κB activation by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The results in Fig. 1a indicate that 40-60 μM curcumin inhibited most of the TNF response. Curcumin by itself did not activate NF-κB. We next tested the kinetics of inhibition, incubating the cells with curcumin for 60, 30, and 10 min prior to the addition of TNF, at the same time as the addition of TNF, or 10 min after the addition of TNF. The cells were treated with TNF for 30 min. TNF response was inhibited only when cells were pretreated with curcumin (Fig. 1b). Cotreatment of cells with TNF and curcumin was not effective. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that a high concentration of TNF (10 nM) can activate NF-κB within 5 min and this induction is higher in its intensity than that obtained with cells using 100-fold lower concentration of TNF for longer time(23Chaturvedi M.M. LaPushin R. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14575-14583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the effect of curcumin on NF-κB activation at higher TNF concentration and its effect on kinetics of TNF-mediated activation of NF-κB, curcumin-pretreated cells were exposed to 10 nM TNF for various times (Fig. 1c). In agreement with our previous results, the induction of NF-κB by 10 nM TNF was very high and occurred within 5 min. Curcumin could completely inhibit the activation of NF-κB induced by 10 nM as efficiently as it did with 0.1 nM TNF. This suggests that curcumin is a very potent inhibitor of NF-κB activation. To show that the retarded band observed by EMSA in TNF-treated cells was indeed NF-κB we incubated the nuclear extracts with antibody to either p50 (NF-κB1) or p65 (Rel A) subunits and then carried out EMSA. The results from this experiment (Fig. 2a) show that antibodies to either subunit of NF-κB shifted the band to higher molecular weight, thus suggesting that the TNF-activated complex consisted of p50 and p65 subunits. Neither preimmune serum nor irrelevant antibody against cyclin Di had any affect on the mobility of NF-κB. Both TPCK and herbimycin A have been shown to interfere with the binding of NF-κB to the DNA(25Finco T.S. Beg A.A. Baldwin A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11884-11888Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 52Mahon T.M. O'Neill L.A.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 111SCrossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of curcumin on the binding of NF-κB to the DNA, the nuclear extracts from TNF-preactivated cells were incubated with curcumin and then EMSA was performed. The results of this experiment (Fig. 2b) show that curcumin did not modify the ability of NF-κB to bind to the DNA. Besides TNF, NF-κB activation is also induced by phorbol ester (PMA), and hydrogen peroxide(49Meyer M. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2005-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). However, the initial signal transduction pathway induced by these agents that leads to the NF-κB activation differs. Therefore we examined the effect of curcumin on activation of the transcription factor by these various agents. The results shown in Fig. 3 indicate that curcumin completely blocked PMA and hydrogen peroxide-induced activation of NF-κB. Thus these results suggest that curcumin is a general suppressor of NF-κB activation. Whether curcumin specifically blocks the activation of NF-κB or also affects other transcription factors was investigated. Curcumin had no effect on the Sp1 transcription factor (Fig. 4); however, DNA binding of AP-1 transcription factors was found to be down-modulated. This result is in agreement with an earlier report which showed that curcumin not only inhibits the DNA binding activity of c-Jun/AP-1 binding factors but also down-modulates the level of these factors(24Huang T-S. Lee S.C. Lin J-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5292-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). It has been shown that agents like TPCK that modify the sulfhydryl group in NF-κB inhibit its activation but this inhibition is prevented in the presence of DTT and DMP(25Finco T.S. Beg A.A. Baldwin A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11884-11888Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 31Kumar S. Rabson A.B. Gelinas C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3094-3106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DTT and DMP can also reverse the inhibitory effect of phenylarsine oxide (a potent protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor) on NF-κB activation(21Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10631-10639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To determine if the inhibitory effect of curcumin on NF-κB was reversed by these reducing agents, ML-1a cells were treated with curcumin in the presence and absence of either DTT or DMP and then examined for the activation of NF-κB by TNF. As shown in Fig. 5, DTT and DMP did not reverse the inhibition caused by curcumin but completely reversed the phenylarsine oxide-mediated inhibition. These results thus suggest that the mechanism of action of curcumin is different from that of protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors. The translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus is preceded by the phosphorylation and proteolytic degradation of IκBα (for review, see (26Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar)). To determine whether the inhibitory action of curcumin was due to its effect on IκBα degradation, the cytoplasmic levels of IκBα protein were examined by Western blot analysis. IκBα was phosphorylated within 5 min of TNF treatment of ML-1a cells and then disappeared within 15 min. However, curcumin abolished both the phosphorylation (as indicated by absence of the slow migrating band) and degradation of IκBα induced by TNF (Fig. 6A). We also measured the level of p65 in the cytoplasm and nucleus. As expected upon TNF treatment, the level of p65 declined in the cytoplasm with a concurrent increase in the nucleus (Fig. 6, B and C). The treatment of cells with curcumin abolished the TNF-dependent change in the nuclear and cytoplasmic p65 levels. These results show that curcumin inhibits the TNF-induced translocation of p65 to the nucleus and this is consistent with the inhibition of TNF-dependent degrdation of IκBα by curcumin. Curcumin is a pharmacologically safe compound with known anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic, and free radical scavenger properties(6Azuine M.A. Bhide S.V. Nutr. Cancer. 1992; 17: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 10Conney A.H. Lysz T. Ferraro T. Abidi T.F. Manchand P.S. Laskin J.D. Huang M.T. Adv.

However, how curcumin carries out these functions is not very clear. We investigated curcumin's effect on NF-κB activation because NF-κB is involved in so many of the activities that curcumin is known to block. NF-κB plays a pivotal role in cells of the immune system because it is rapidly activated by a wide variety of pathogenic signals and functions as a potent and pleiotropic transcriptional activator. Intervention in NF-κB activation may be beneficial in suppressing toxic/septic shock, graft versus host reactions, acute inflammatory reactions, HIV replication, acute-phase response, and radiation damage. Our results show that curcumin completely blocked the TNF-dependent activation of NF-κB. The activation induced by various other agents including phorbol ester and H2O2 was also inhibited by curcumin. As has been shown with other inhibitors, the effect of curcumin was not due to the chemical modification of NF-κB proteins (25Finco T.S. Beg A.A. Baldwin A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11884-11888Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 31Kumar S. Rabson A.B. Gelinas C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3094-3106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 52Mahon T.M. O'Neill L.A.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 111SCrossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The inhibition of NF-κB activation was accompanied by the inhibition of p65 translocation to the nucleus and of IκBα degradation. Identifying how curcumin blocks the activation of NF-κB requires an understanding of the mechanism by which various inducers activate this important transcription factor. The role of different TNF-activated signals including acidic and neutral sphingomyelinase-generated ceramides, proteases, serine/threonine protein kinase, protein tyrosine kinase, protein tyrosine phosphatase, and superoxide radicals in the activation of NF-κB have been implicated(1Siebenlist U. Franzo G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar, 21Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol.

Whether these signals are generated by TNF sequentially or independently of each other, however, is not understood. All three inducers of NF-κB used in our studies are known to produce reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI). Therefore, it is possible that the effect of curcumin is through quenching of ROI production. The inhibitors of mitochondrial electron transport have been shown to impair the TNF-induced activation of NF-κB(36Schulze-Osthoff K. Beyaert R. Van Dervoorde V. Haegeman G. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3095-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), thus also suggesting the role of ROI. Several additional, indirect lines of evidence suggest a role for ROI as a common and critical denominator(40Eicher D.M. Tan T-H. Rice N.R. O'Shea J.J. Kennedy I.C.S. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2710-2719PubMed Google Scholar, 41Schreck R. Meier B. Maennel D.N. Droge W. Baeuerle P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar), including evidence that cellular levels of ROI increase in response to TNF, interleukin-1, PMA, lipopolysaccharide, UV light, and γ-irradiation (for review, see (1Siebenlist U. Franzo G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar)). But among the various ROI administered to cells in culture, only hydrogen peroxide was found to be an effective activator of NF-κB(42Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A.

In vitro, curcumin has been shown to inhibit both serine/threonine protein kinase and protein tyrosine kinase(44Reddy S. Aggarwal B.B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The protein kinase needed for the activation of NF-κB has not, however, been identified. Although PMA is an activator of protein kinase C, both TNF and H2O2 have been shown to activate both protein kinase C and protein tyrosine kinase. NF-κB activation by TNF and H2O2 has been shown to be blocked by inhibitors of both protein kinase C and protein tyrosine kinase(50Meichle A. Schutze S. Hensel G. Brunsing D. Kronke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8339-8343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of a protein tyrosine kinase has also been implicated in NF-κB activation by ultraviolet light, lipopolysaccharide, hypoxia, and v-src(37Devary Y. Rosette C. DiDonato J.A. Karin M. Science. 1993; 261: 1442-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 38Geng Y. Zhang B. Lotz M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6692-6700PubMed Google Scholar, 39Koong A.C. Chen E.Y. Giaccia A.J.

Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We have shown that TNF-dependent activation of NF-κB is dependent on erbstatin-sensitive protein tyrosine kinase(22Reddy S.A.G. Chaturvedi M.M. Darnay B.G. Chan H. Higuchi M. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25369-25372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of Schievien et al.(43Schievien G.L. Kirihara J.M. Myers D.E. Ledbetter J.A. Uckun F.M. Blood. 1993; 82: 1212-1220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors block γ-irradiation-induced NF-κB activation, a stimulant thought to work through the immediate generation of ROI, which suggest that protein tyrosine kinase activation may precede ROI generation. Thus there are different early events involved in activation of NF-κB but all of them may converge to phosphorylate the IκBα which precedes its degradation and the subsequent translocation of p65 into the nucleus. It has been shown that curcumin not only inhibits the DNA binding of c-jun/AP-1 transcription factor but it also down-modulates c-jun level by preventing its transcription(24Huang T-S. Lee S.C. Lin J-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5292-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Our data are in agreement, but this raises the question of what other transcription factors curcumin inhibits. We found that curcumin did not inhibit the Sp1 transcription factor under the same conditions in which it inhibited NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factors. Curcumin has also been shown to inhibit TNF and phorbol ester-stimulated type 1 HIV-LTR-directed gene expression and virus replication(11Li C.J. Zhang L.J. Dezube B.J. Crumpacker C.S. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1839-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), and this may be mediated through the inhibition of NF-κB. Recently it has been reported that curcumin can also inhibit nitric oxide synthase(45Brouet I. Ohshima H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 533-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 46Ohshima H. Bartsch H. Mutat. Res. 1994; 305: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar, 47Halliwell B. The Lancet. 1994; 344: 721-724Abstract PubMed Scopus (2571) Google Scholar). These observations can be explained based on our results since the expression of this enzyme is NF-κB dependent. This is consistent with the observation that TPCK, a protease inhibitor that blocks NF-κB activation, also blocks the expression of nitric oxide synthase(48Kim H. Lee H.S. Chang K.T. Ko H.T. Baek K.J. Kwon N.S. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4741-4748PubMed Google Scholar). TPCK, however, may exert its effect by a different mechanism than curcumin does. It has been shown that TPCK chemically modifies NF-κB, thus altering its release from IκBα(25Finco T.S. Beg A.A. Baldwin A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11884-11888Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Curcumin, however, does not chemically modify the DNA binding properties of NF-κB. Another level of modification that could prevent formation of p50/p65 heterodimer is down-modulation of the cytoplasmic pool of p65 subunit of NF-κB. Our results, however, show that p65 was not down-modulated by curcumin but its translocation to the nucleus was inhibited, most likely through inhibition of degradation of IκBα. The observation that TNF-induced phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα is abolished by curcumin indicate that the step in the signal transduction pathway of NF-κB activation inhibited by this agent is at or before the phosphorylation step of NF-κB (Fig. 7). That it can inhibit NF-κB activation by diverse agents indicate that this step is after or at the step where the diverse signals converge. Overall we conclude that because of its very low pharmacological toxicity and its ability to modulate activation of NF-κB by various agents, curcumin has a high potential for use in modulating expression of genes regulated by NF-κB. We are thankful to Dr. B. G. Darnay for his thoughtful criticism of the manuscript."

PES-2 mRNA is synergistically induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in bovine arterial endothelial cells. On the other hand, PES-1 mRNA is constitutively expressed under these conditions. Therefore, the promoter activities of the human genes for PES-1 and −2 in bovine arterial endothelial cells were examined. The 5′-flanking region of the human PES-2 gene (nucleotides −327 to +59) showed promoter activity inducible by LPS and TPA using transient transfection analysis, whereas that of the PES-1 gene (nucleotides −1010 to +69) showed constitutive promoter activity. Destruction of both consensus sequences for the nuclear factor responsible for the interleukin-6 expression (NF-IL6) site (nucleotides −132 to −124) and the cyclic AMP response element (CRE) (nucleotides −59 to −53) of the human PES-2 gene markedly reduced the promoter activity (25%) of the PES-2 gene after combined treatment with LPS and TPA, although single destruction of the NF-IL6 site or the CRE slightly reduced the promoter activity (60 or 90%, respectively). Moreover, cotransfection experiments showed that a trans-acting factor, CCAAT enhancer binding protein δ (C/EBPδ), which binds to both the NF-IL6 site and the CRE, increased the promoter activity of the PES-2 gene mainly through the CRE. C/EBPδ mRNA was rapidly induced by LPS. Collectively, these results suggest that transcription of the PES-2 gene in vascular endothelial cells is regulated through combination of the NF-IL6 site and the CRE and that C/EBPδ functions as one of the trans-acting factors.

https://openalex.org/W2105129317,"Two vertebrate photoreceptor-specific membrane guanylyl cyclases, RetGC-1 and RetGC-2, are activated by a soluble 24-kDa retinal protein, p24, in a Ca2+-sensitive manner (Dizhoor, A.

The primary structure of bovine p24 has been derived from peptide sequencing and from its cDNA. p24 is a new EF-hand-type Ca2+-binding protein, related but not identical to another guanylyl cyclase-activating protein, GCAP (Palczewski, K., Subbaraya, I., Gorczyca, W.

Antibodies against a truncated fusion protein and against a p24-specific synthetic peptide specifically recognize retinal p24 on immunoblot. Both antibodies inhibit activation of photoreceptor membrane guanylyl cyclase by purified p24. p24 is found only in retina, and it copurifies with outer segment membranes. Immunocytochemical analysis shows that it is present in rod photoreceptor cells. An immobilized antibody column was used to purify p24 from a heat-treated retinal extract. Purified p24 appears on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a homogenous protein not contaminated with GCAP, and it activates photoreceptor guanylyl cyclase in vitro at submicromolar concentrations. Ca2+ inhibits this activation with an EC50 near 200 nM and a Hill coefficient of 1.7. Recombinant p24 expressed in 293 cells effectively stimulates photoreceptor guanylyl cyclase. These findings demonstrate that p24, like GCAP, imparts Ca2+ sensitivity to photoreceptor membrane guanylyl cyclase.

INTRODUCTIONLight triggers hydrolysis of cyclic GMP and closure of cGMP-gated cation channels in photoreceptor outer segment plasma membranes (OS) 1The abbreviations used are: OSouter segmentGCguanylyl cyclaseMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidPCRpolymerase chain reactionGCAPguanylyl cyclase-activating proteinPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography. (reviewed in Stryer(1991), Lagnado and Baylor(1992), and Yarfitz and Hurley(1994)). In darkness, these channels allow Ca2+ influx, but light-induced closure of the channels lowers free intracellular Ca2+ because Ca2+ is extruded from the OS by a light-independent Na+/K+, Ca2+ exchanger. The most recent estimate of the magnitude of this effect is that light lowers free intracellular Ca2+ from a dark level of 500 nM to as low as 50 nM (Gray-Keller and Detwiler, 1994). The decrease in free Ca2+ concentration allows a soluble activator protein to stimulate a membrane guanylyl cyclase (GC) (Lolley and Racz, 1982; Koch and Stryer, 1988). Two membrane GCs are present in photoreceptor cells, RetGC-1 and RetGC-2 (Shyjan et al., 1992; Lowe et al., 1995). When cloned and expressed in HEK293 cells, both cyclases can be stimulated by a soluble protein purified from retina (Dizhoor et al., 1994; Lowe et al., 1995). This stimulation occurs only at free Ca2+ below 200 nM. RetGC-1 was also purified from bovine retina (Koch, 1991; Hayashi and Yamazaki 1991; Margulis et al., 1993), and both RetGC-1 (Goraczniak et al., 1994; Yang et al., 1995) and RetGC-2 (Yang et al., 1995) were cloned from bovine and rat retinal cDNA libraries. Other types of membrane GCs have been well characterized (reviewed in Garbers and Lowe(1994)). They are regulated by small peptide ligands that bind to their extracellular domains. So far, there is no reported evidence that small peptides regulate RetGC-1 or RetGC-2 (Shyjan et al., 1992; Yang et al., 1995).It was recently reported that two Ca2+-binding proteins from retina stimulate photoreceptor GC at low Ca2+ concentrations. A 21-kDa Ca2+-binding protein referred to as GCAP (Gorczyca et al., 1994; Palczewski et al., 1994) stimulates GC activity in rod outer segment membranes. A different protein, p24, which also stimulates GC in rod outer segment membranes, has been purified from retina by a method different from the method used to purify GCAP. It has also been shown that p24 stimulates recombinant RetGC-1 and RetGC-2 (Dizhoor et al., 1994; Lowe et al., 1995). In this report, we show that p24 is a novel Ca2+-binding protein present in photoreceptor cells. It is related to, but distinct from, GCAP and other members of the recoverin family of Ca2+-binding proteins. Highly purified p24, free from GCAP contamination, stimulates photoreceptor membrane GC at low Ca2+. Antibodies against p24 prevent purified p24 from activating GC. We also demonstrate that recombinant p24 expressed in HEK293 cells stimulates photoreceptor GC. We propose to refer to GCAP as GCAP-1 and to p24 as GCAP-2 (guanylyl cyclase-activating protein-2).MATERIALS AND METHODSIsolation of OS and p24Outer segments were isolated from frozen bovine retinas using a sucrose floatation technique described by McDowell and Kuhn(1977) with modifications. p24 was isolated from a crude retinal extract using heat denaturation, phenyl-Sepharose chromatography, preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and reverse phase HPLC as described (Dizhoor et al., 1994). The only modification was that 5 mM CaCl2 was added, and NaCl was omitted during homogenization of retinas.Sequencing of p24Purified p24 had a blocked N terminus, which made it unavailable for direct Edman degradation, so it was cleaved by trypsin and cyanogen bromide (CNBr). Purified p24 was transferred onto Millipore Immobilon-PSQ membranes (Matsudaira, 1987), reduced and alkylated with isopropylacetamide (Krutzsch and Inman, 1993), followed by digestion in 25 μl of 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate, 10% acetonitrile with 0.2 μg of modified trypsin (Promega) at 37°C for 17 h (Henzel et al., 1994). The solution was concentrated in a Speed-Vac and injected onto a C18 0.22 × 100-mm capillary column (LC Packings, Inc.). Peptides were eluted using a linear gradient of 0-80% acetonitrile (solution A contained 0.1 aqueous trifluoroacetic acid, and solution B was acetonitrile containing 0.07% trifluoroacetic acid) at a flow rate of 3.5 μl/min and detected by absorbance at 195 nm. Purified p24 was cleaved in 50 μl of 0.1 N HCl at 45°C for 3 h using a single crystal of CNBr. The peptides were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane after separation in a Tris-tricine SDS gel. Automated protein sequencing was performed on a model 470A Applied Biosystems sequencer equipped with an on-line PTH analyzer using modified cycles (Henzel et al., 1994). Sequence interpretation was performed on DEC Alpha (Henzel et al., 1987). Additional sequencing was performed by mass spectrometry of Lys-C fragments of p24. HPLC-purified peptides were mixed with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid saturated in 50% acetonitrile and 2% trifluoroacetic acid. Mass spectra were obtained with a Vestec (Houston, TX) LaserTec Research laser desorption linear time-of-flight mass spectrometer equipped with a 337 nM VSL-337 ND nitrogen laser (Laser Science, Inc.). (Henzel et al., 1990, 1993).Molecular Cloning of p24 cDNAThe substantial length of the sequenced protein fragment allowed us to use short degenerate oligonucleotides as primers for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to generate a long probe. Two primers were derived from the amino acid sequence of p24. Forward primer FB, 5′-CA(A/G)TA(T/C)GT(A/G/T/C)GA(A/G)ATGTT-3′, corresponded to a peptide QYVEAMF, and a reverse primer RE, 5′-CC(T/C)TG(T/C)TC(A/G/T/C)GC(T/C)TC(A/G/T/C)AC(T/C)TC-3′, corresponded to peptide EVEAEQQG. Those were used for high stringency PCR to generate a PCR product to probe a cDNA library. A λgt11 bovine retinal cDNA library (a gift from Dr. D. Oprian) was used as a template for the PCR reaction. A 246-base pair product was produced, subcloned into EcoRI-BamHI sites of BlueScript phagemide (Stratagene), and sequenced. This sequence was compared to the known peptide fragment sequences. The insert was excised with EcoRI/BamHI, purified by electrophoresis, and used to synthesize a random primer-labeled radioactive probe. This probe was used to screen a bovine retinal λgt10 library (a gift from Dr. J. Nathans). High stringency screening (5% mismatch) of 800,000 plaques identified six positive clones. The sequence of the p24 cDNA fragment encoding amino acids from Glu26 to Phe204 was derived from the longest clone of cDNA after subcloning it into BlueScript. In all six λgt10 clones, the 5′-coding region for p24 was truncated. The region encoding M1-E26 was derived from cDNA amplified by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (Life Technologies, Inc.). Poly(A)-containing mRNA was isolated from fresh bovine retinas using a Life Technologies, Inc. mRNA purification kit. Approximately 100 ng of mRNA was reverse transcribed using reverse primer GSP-1, 5′-ATATATGGATCCTTAGAGCCCTCAGAACATGGCACTTT-3′. The cDNA was polycytidylated and amplified using two consecutive amplifications with reverse primers GSP-2 (5′-ATATAAGAATTCTCCACACTGCAGGCTTTCTTC-3′) and GSP-3 (5′-ATATAAGAATTCCCATTGCGGTCCTTGTCGTAGATCT-3′). The final product was subcloned into the BlueScript vector and sequenced. It had more than 230 base pairs overlap with cDNA cloned from the cDNA library, which confirmed the identity of the amplified fragment as a 5′-region of p24 cDNA.Antibodies Against p24Anti-peptide antibody P24SVE was generated in rabbits against a synthetic peptide Cys131-Leu155 coupled to m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce). The final antibody was affinity purified on a Sepharose-coupled peptide. This antibody effectively recognized p24 on immunoblot but did not react with paraformaldehyde fixed frozen bovine retina sections.The second antibody, ΔNp24, was generated against an N-truncated recombinant fragment P52-F204 of p24. The cDNA-encoding fragment Pro52-Phe204 was amplified by PCR using cloned p24 cDNA as a template. In the final product Val51 was substituted for Met encoded within a site for NdeI. The DNA product was inserted into NdeI and BamHI sites of the expression vector pET15b (Novagene) and expressed in an Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) to produce a fusion protein linked at the N terminus to a 20-amino acid His-Tag-containing peptide. Protein induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside reacted with the antibody P24SVE and demonstrated a Ca2+-dependent shift of electrophoretic mobility in SDS-PAGE. This protein was insoluble. It could be solubilized in 6 M urea and purified on a Ni2+-bound His-bond column (Novagen). All buffers for the purification contained 6 M urea. Purified protein was dialyzed against 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 mM NaCl. The main part of the protein precipitates during this procedure. Protein was solubilized again at pH 9.5, and more than 50% of it remained soluble after subsequent dialysis at pH 8. Antibody was produced in rabbits and purified on the recombinant Pro52-Phe204 fragment cross-linked to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B at pH 8.3. Unreacted protein was removed by extensive washing with 100 mM Tris buffer, pH 10.5. The affinity column was neutralized to pH 8 and used for purification of the antibody. The column was stable at 4°C and efficient for purification of up to 10 mg of antibodies from 30 ml of immune serum. The antibody strongly reacted with p24 on immunoblot and was suitable for immunocytochemical analysis. Only a trace of cross-reactivity of ΔNp24 antibody with recombinant GCAP was found using immunoblot. To compete away this residual cross-reactivity, a soluble recombinant N-truncated fragment Asp110-Gly205 of GCAP was expressed in E. coli as a His-Tag fusion protein using pET15b vector and purified on a His-bond column as above.Recombinant GCAP and anti-GCAP antibody UW14 were provided by K. Palczewski (University of Washington).ImmunocytochemistryCryosections of paraformaldehyde-fixed bovine retina were a gift from Dr. Ann Milam (University of Washington). Sections were air dried for 40 min, blocked in a solution of 1% horse serum in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h, incubated overnight at 4°C with primary ΔNp24 antibody (0.25 μg/ml), washed with phosphate-buffered saline 2 × 15′, incubated with fluoroisothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cappel) for 1 h at room temperature, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline and photographed using a Nikon fluorescence microscope (objective ×20 or ×40). For competition experiments, the antibody was preincubated for 30 min at room temperature with 2 μM recombinant fragment Pro52-Phe204 of p24 or recombinant recoverin or 4 μM N-truncated recombinant GCAP. Both preincubated and non-preincubated antibody solutions were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g, 4°C, prior to using them on retinal sections.ImmunoblotAfter electrophoresis in 15% SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and probed with anti-p24 antibodies. Bovine neurocalcin, recoverin, and hippocalcin were expressed in E. coli as described in (Teng et al., 1994). The blot was developed using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody with a mixture of nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-indolyl-phosphate as a substrate.GC Activity AssayGC activity was assayed under infrared illumination using washed OS membranes and analyzed by TLC (Dizhoor et al., 1994). Bovine rod outer segments were washed in the dark three times in 5 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mM MgCl2, 0.05 mM CaCl2, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.05 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5% (v/v) glycerol. Membranes were pelleted at 30,000 × g for 30 min, aliquoted, and frozen at −70°C. Before the analysis, 40-μl aliquots of washed membranes were thawed on ice and resuspended in 600 μl of 2 × buffer (100 mM MOPS-KOH, pH 7.5, 16 mM NaCl, 200 mM KCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 14 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 μM dipyridamol). Reaction mixture contained 12.5 μl of resuspended membranes (~7 μg of rhodopsin) in the final volume of 25 μl.To start the reaction, 5 μl of substrate solution containing 5 mM GTP, ~1 μCi of [α-32P]GTP (Amersham) was added. This solution also contained 20 mM cGMP, ~100,000 dpm of [8-3H]cGMP (Amersham), and 0.5 mM ATP. Each reaction mixture was incubated in a closed Eppendorf tube for 10 min at 30°C and then heated for 2 min at 100°C to stop the reaction. The reaction tubes were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and 8-μl aliquots were loaded onto polyethyleneimine cellulose 20 × 20-cm plastic Polygram TLC plates (Alltech) with 1/2-inch intervals (14 samples per plate). The TLC plates were air dried and developed first in water and then in 0.2 M LiCl. cGMP spots visualized using UV illuminator were cut from the plate, placed into 20 ml of scintillation vials containing 1 ml of 2 M LiCl, and shaken for 10 min at room temperature on a rotary shaker. Both 3H and 32P radioactivity was counted in each vial in 10 ml of Ecolume liquid scintillator. [3H]cGMP radioactivity was used as an internal standard in each sample to ensure the absence of cGMP hydrolysis in the course of the reaction. Nonspecific background of 32P in cGMP spots was controlled in each set of experiments using reaction mixtures inactivated by heat denaturation prior to the addition of radiolabeled substrate and was found to be insignificant compared to the amount of [32P]cGMP synthesized by activated GC.GC activity was found to be linear within at least the first 15 min of the reaction, both in the absence and in the presence of affinity-purified or expressed p24, both at 15 nM and 1 μM free Ca2+ and was directly proportional to the amount of OS membranes.Expression of p24 in HEK293 CellsThe expression construct was made by ligation of a full-length coding region of p24 cDNA into EcoRI and BamHI sites of the pHβAPr vector under control of the human β-actin promoter. The construct was propagated in E. coli strain TB-1 and purified using QIAGEN plasmid DNA purification columns. HEK293 cells were transfected using calcium-phosphate-precipitated DNA. 10 μg of DNA was used to transfect cell cultures at 50% confluence. After the transfection, cells were grown for 72 h until almost confluent. Control cells were treated simultaneously without adding the expression DNA construct. Before harvesting, the cells were briefly washed with an extraction buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol), mechanically removed from the plate, and homogenized in 2 ml of the extraction buffer using a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 80,000 rpm in a Beckman TLA100.3 rotor for 10 min. Equal volume aliquots of soluble and membrane fractions were loaded onto 15% SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose, probed with ΔNp24 antibody, and developed by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody with ECL substrate (Amersham) by exposing the blot onto X-Omat film (Kodak). The level of expression of p24 was not high enough to quantify it by Coomassie staining. Before the GC assay, the soluble extracts from both control and p24-expressing 293 cells were concentrated to 10 mg/ml of total protein, and 5 μl from each extract were reconstituted with washed OS membranes.Ca-EGTA BuffersCa-EGTA buffers were prepared from solutions of EGTA (Sigma) and EGTA saturated with CaCl2 (Fluka) by pH titration in strict accordance with the method of Tsien and Pozzan(1989). Free Ca2+ concentrations were calculated using a multi-factor program (Marks and Maxfield, 1991) and verified by Ca2+-electrode and by titration with Rhod-2 fluorescent dye (Calbiochem).RESULTSPrimary Structure of p24 (GCAP-2)We determined the primary structure of p24 by Edman degradation of peptides cleaved from purified p24 (Dizhoor et al., 1994) and by sequence analysis of p24 cDNA (Fig. 1A). p24 is a novel Ca2+-binding protein most closely related to a family of recoverin-like proteins within the EF-hand protein super family. Fig. 1B demonstrates the close similarity between several recoverin-like proteins. p24 has four EF-hand-like motifs, but the first two align poorly with the consensus motif for EF-hands. Only EF-hands 3 and 4 are likely to bind Ca2+. A consensus glycine is substituted with asparagine in the second potential EF-hand, and two oxygen-containing amino acid residues are missing from the first EF-hand-related motif.p24 is 41, 38, and 29% identical to bovine GCAP, neurocalcin, and recoverin, respectively. Like other members of this family, p24 has a consensus sequence for N-terminal myristoylation. It has yet to be determined if it is heterogenously fatty acylated-like recoverin (Dizhoor et al., 1992) and other photoreceptor proteins (Johnson et al., 1994).Tissue Specificity of p24We produced two types of antibodies that specifically recognize p24. The first, ΔNp24, was raised against a large 152-amino acid fragment Pro52-Phe204 expressed in E. coli as a His-Tag fusion protein. The second antibody, p24SVE, was generated against a synthetic peptide, Cys131-Leu155, highly specific for p24 and significantly different from the corresponding region in GCAP (Fig. 1B). Both antibodies were raised in rabbits and affinity purified. They reacted with HPLC-purified p24 and did not react with recombinant bovine recoverin, neurocalcin, or hippocalcin (Fig. 2A). Special attention was paid to the possibility of cross-reactivity with GCAP. P24SVE does not react with recombinant GCAP on immunoblots (Fig. 2B). Only very weak cross-reactivity with GCAP was detected with the ΔNp24 antibody on immunoblots. This was completely suppressed by pre-adsorption of ΔNp24 antibody with a recombinant fragment (Asp110-Gly205) of GCAP (Fig. 2C).Figure 2Antibodies against p24.

This is consistent with our previous finding that GC-stimulating activity was not detected in those tissues (Dizhoor et al., 1994).Figure 3Tissue specificity of p24.

However, immunoblot analysis demonstrates that p24 is also present in a preparation highly enriched in OS (Fig. 3). This suggests that a substantial fraction of this protein copurifies with OS. Direct immunocytochemical localization of p24 was done using affinity-purified antibody ΔNp24, which specifically recognized outer and inner segments of photoreceptors on cryosections of fixed bovine retina. A weak staining of synaptic termini of photoreceptor cells was also detected (Fig. 4A). Similar results were obtained with fixed paraffin sections of retina (not shown). Preincubation of the antibody with recombinant fragment of p24 eliminated the signal from the photoreceptor cells (Fig. 4, B and E). Preincubating the antibody with a recombinant N-truncated fragment of GCAP did not block the signal in the photoreceptors (Fig. 4D). Neither full-length recombinant GCAP nor recoverin competed with the specific signal from photoreceptors (data not shown). Cones did not appear to stain with the antibody (Fig. 4, A and D). The most intense signal was detected in the outer segments and in the upper part of the inner segments of rods. Although this suggests that p24 is a rod-specific protein, the possibility that the epitope for antibody recognition is masked in cone cells cannot be excluded. Further studies using additional antibodies will be required to determine the exact localization of p24 in photoreceptor cells.Figure 4Immunolocalization of p24 in bovine retina.

The activator retained on the column can be eluted at low pH as an apparently homogenous 24-kDa protein (Fig. 5B). In our SDS gel system, p24 and GCAP have almost identical electrophoretic mobility. Therefore, we used antibodies against GCAP to examine our preparations for the presence of GCAP (Fig. 5C). A highly specific antibody against GCAP, UW14, strongly recognizes recombinant GCAP on an immunoblot (left lane) but does not detect any GCAP in our immunoaffinity-purified p24 (right lane). This preparation of p24 activates GC in washed OS membranes (Fig. 4D) with the same Ca2+ sensitivity (EC50 = 200 nM) and cooperativity (Hill coefficient, 1.7) as HPLC-purified p24 (Dizhoor et al., 1994). Both anti-ΔNp24 and anti-p24SVE antibody efficiently inhibit activation of GC by purified p24 in vitro (Fig. 6). Since p24SVE antibody does not cross-react with GCAP (Fig. 2C), we can say with certainty that GC-stimulating activity in purified p24 preparations derives from p24 itself. This conclusion is consistent with the fact that GC-stimulating activity copurifies with p24 through several purification steps (Dizhoor et al., 1994; Lowe et al., 1995). Based on these results, p24 is a Ca2+-sensitive regulator of photoreceptor GC distinct from GCAP.Figure 5Purification of p24 using immunoaffinity chromatography on ΔNp24 antibody column. A, binding and elution of GC activator from the column. A heat-treated extract (HT) from retina partially enriched in GC activator by phenyl-Sepharose chromatography (marked PS, 5 mg of total protein) was loaded onto the anti-ΔNp24 antibody column and eluted at pH 2.5.

It is present in the outer and inner segments of photoreceptor cells and, when expressed as recombinant protein in 293 cells, effectively stimulates photoreceptor GC in vitro.Based on its primary structure, p24 is closely related to another recently identified GC activator referred to as GCAP (Gorczyca et al., 1994; Palczewski et al., 1994). p24 and GCAP are both members of the recoverin family of EF-hand proteins, but they are structurally and functionally more similar to each other than to other members of the recoverin family. Therefore, we propose that GCAP be referred to as GCAP-1 and p24 as GCAP-2. It has been proposed that the very N-terminal domain of GCAP-1 participates in activation of GC (Palczewski et al., 1994). However, GCAP-2 is clearly distinct from GCAP-1 within the first 20 amino acid residues (Fig. 1B). This implies that a domain other than the very N terminus is involved in GC activation. GCAP-1 and GCAP-2 are most similar within the Ca2+-binding domains, especially EF-2 and EF-3. However, this region is also highly conserved in all recoverin-like proteins, including those that do not activate GC. It is possible that the GC-activating domain is formed by a tertiary structure that brings together remote elements of primary structure rather than by a particular short region of amino acid sequence.GCAP-2 most likely binds Ca2+ only in the EF-3 and EF-4 sites. Amino acid residues in EF-1 and EF-2 of GCAP-2 do not match well to the EF-hand consensus sequence. In EF-1, two oxygen-containing residues (positions 35 and 41) of the consensus are substituted with Cys and Phe, respectively. EF-2 has all the consensus oxygen-containing amino acid residues, but a consensus Gly is substituted with Asn at position 74. The number of Ca2+ binding sites and their affinities have to be determined experimentally.At the N terminus of GCAP-2, there is a motif known to be recognized by N-myristoyl transferase. Two photoreceptor Ca2+-binding proteins, recoverin and GCAP-1, are known to be heterogenously fatty acylated at their N termini (Dizhoor et al., 1992; Palczewski et al., 1994). This fatty acylation plays an important role in a structure of recoverin referred to as the “calcium-myristoyl switch” (Zozulya and Stryer, 1992; Dizhoor et al., 1993; Ames et al., 1995). Other proteins from retina that have this motif are also heterogenously acylated with C14 and C12 saturated and non-saturated fatty acids (Johnson et al., 1994). A mass spectrometry analysis is being done to verify if GCAP-2 is also heterogenously acylated.Both GCAP-1 and GCAP-2 are present in photoreceptor cells, but their precise intracellular localization has not yet been established. Two Ca2+-sensitive membrane cyclases, RetGC-1 and RetGC-2, are also present in photoreceptor cells (Dizhoor et al., 1994; Lowe et al., 1995). RetGC-1 is present in outer segments and inner segment and appears more abundant in cones than in rods (Dizhoor et al., 1994; Liu et al., 1994). RetGC-2 protein in photoreceptor cells has not been localized. GCAP-2 appears to be more abundant in rods, whereas GCAP-1 immunoreactivity is both in rods and cones. 2K.

INTRODUCTIONLight triggers hydrolysis of cyclic GMP and closure of cGMP-gated cation channels in photoreceptor outer segment plasma membranes (OS) 1The abbreviations used are: OSouter segmentGCguanylyl cyclaseMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidPCRpolymerase chain reactionGCAPguanylyl cyclase-activating proteinPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography. (reviewed in Stryer(1991), Lagnado and Baylor(1992), and Yarfitz and Hurley(1994)). In darkness, these channels allow Ca2+ influx, but light-induced closure of the channels lowers free intracellular Ca2+ because Ca2+ is extruded from the OS by a light-independent Na+/K+, Ca2+ exchanger. The most recent estimate of the magnitude of this effect is that light lowers free intracellular Ca2+ from a dark level of 500 nM to as low as 50 nM (Gray-Keller and Detwiler, 1994). The decrease in free Ca2+ concentration allows a soluble activator protein to stimulate a membrane guanylyl cyclase (GC) (Lolley and Racz, 1982; Koch and Stryer, 1988). Two membrane GCs are present in photoreceptor cells, RetGC-1 and RetGC-2 (Shyjan et al., 1992; Lowe et al., 1995). When cloned and expressed in HEK293 cells, both cyclases can be stimulated by a soluble protein purified from retina (Dizhoor et al., 1994; Lowe et al., 1995). This stimulation occurs only at free Ca2+ below 200 nM. RetGC-1 was also purified from bovine retina (Koch, 1991; Hayashi and Yamazaki 1991; Margulis et al., 1993), and both RetGC-1 (Goraczniak et al., 1994; Yang et al., 1995) and RetGC-2 (Yang et al., 1995) were cloned from bovine and rat retinal cDNA libraries. Other types of membrane GCs have been well characterized (reviewed in Garbers and Lowe(1994)). They are regulated by small peptide ligands that bind to their extracellular domains. So far, there is no reported evidence that small peptides regulate RetGC-1 or RetGC-2 (Shyjan et al., 1992; Yang et al., 1995).It was recently reported that two Ca2+-binding proteins from retina stimulate photoreceptor GC at low Ca2+ concentrations. A 21-kDa Ca2+-binding protein referred to as GCAP (Gorczyca et al., 1994; Palczewski et al., 1994) stimulates GC activity in rod outer segment membranes. A different protein, p24, which also stimulates GC in rod outer segment membranes, has been purified from retina by a method different from the method used to purify GCAP. It has also been shown that p24 stimulates recombinant RetGC-1 and RetGC-2 (Dizhoor et al., 1994; Lowe et al., 1995). In this report, we show that p24 is a novel Ca2+-binding protein present in photoreceptor cells. It is related to, but distinct from, GCAP and other members of the recoverin family of Ca2+-binding proteins. Highly purified p24, free from GCAP contamination, stimulates photoreceptor membrane GC at low Ca2+. Antibodies against p24 prevent purified p24 from activating GC. We also demonstrate that recombinant p24 expressed in HEK293 cells stimulates photoreceptor GC. We propose to refer to GCAP as GCAP-1 and to p24 as GCAP-2 (guanylyl cyclase-activating protein-2)."
https://openalex.org/W2064785971,"A number of “target” proteins for the Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins have now been identified, including the protein kinases ACK and p65PAK (Manser, E., Leung, T., Salihuddin, H., Zhao, Z.-S., and Lim, L.(1994) Nature 367, 40-46). The purified serine/threonine kinase p65PAK has been shown to be directly activated by GTP-Rac1 or GTP-Cdc42. Here we report the cDNA sequence encoding a new brain-enriched PAK isoform β-PAK, which shares 79% amino acid identity with the previously described α-isoform. Their mRNAs are differentially expressed in the brain, with α-PAK mRNA being particularly abundant in motor-associated regions. In vitro translation products of the α- and β-PAK cDNAs exhibited relative molecular masses of 68,000 and 65,000, respectively, by SDS-polyacrylamide analysis. A specific β-PAK peptide sequence was obtained from rat brain-purified p65PAK. Recombinant α- and β-PAKs exhibited an increase in kinase activity mediated by GTP-p21 induced autophosphorylation. Cdc42 was a more potent activator in vitro of α-PAK kinase, and the fully activated enzyme is 300 times more active than the unphosphorylated form. Interestingly the down-regulation in the binding of p21s to recombinant β-PAK and brain p65PAK, which is observed upon kinase activation does not occur with recombinant α-PAK. A number of “target” proteins for the Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins have now been identified, including the protein kinases ACK and p65PAK (Manser, E., Leung, T., Salihuddin, H., Zhao, Z.-S., and Lim, L.(1994) Nature 367, 40-46).

Morphological roles for the most common members of the mammalian Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins, Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42, have been established in fibroblasts (Ridley et al., 1992; Ridley and Hall, 1992; Kozma et al., 1995). Cdc42 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is required for cell budding and may provide the polarization signal at this site (Ziman et al., 1993); in fibroblasts filopodial formation is dependent on the closely related mammalian homologue of Cdc42 (Kozma et al., 1995; Nobes and Hall, 1995). Although an increasing number of p21 Rho GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) 1The abbreviations used are: GAPGTPase-activating proteinGSTglutathione S-transferasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPAKp21 (Cdc42/Rac1)-activated protein kinasePCRpolymerase chain reactionPVDFpolyvinylidene difluorideMBPmyelin basic proteinGTPγSguanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). have been identified (for review, see Lamarche and Hall(1994)), there is as yet no evidence that they are able to exhibit effector function. These proteins can be identified by sequence homology to the GAP domain and by their activity in overlay assays (Manser et al., 1992). The most closely related RhoGAPs comprise the chimaerin family (Hall et al., 1993; Leung et al., 1993, 1994), acting on Rac and whose activity is regulated through a protein kinase C-like cysteine-rich domain (Ahmed et al., 1993). Although many RhoGAPs are somewhat promiscuous in vitro, they appear to show distinct p21 specificities in vivo (Ridley et al., 1993). GTPase-activating protein glutathione S-transferase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis p21 (Cdc42/Rac1)-activated protein kinase polymerase chain reaction polyvinylidene difluoride myelin basic protein guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). The prototype small GTP-binding protein p21-Ras is an oncogene that has effector targets which include Raf kinases (Vojtek et al., 1993; Warne et al., 1993; Zhang et al., 1993) phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (Rodriguez-Viciana et al., 1994) and RasGAP itself (Schweighoffer et al., 1992). The use of the p21 GTP/GDP cycle is exemplified by the role of Ras in growth factor signal transduction, where GTP-Ras functions to activate proteins of the “mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade” through the serine/threonine kinase Raf (Warne et al., 1993), and MEK kinase (Lange-Carter and Johnson, 1994). It seems probable that part of p21 Rho family signaling also occurs through associated kinases for which the prototypes are the activated Cdc42-associated tyrosine kinase p120-ACK (Manser et al., 1993) and a Cdc42- and Rac1-activated kinase p65-PAK (Manser et al., 1994). Both ACK and PAK inhibit intrinsic as well as GAP-stimulated GTPase activity of the p21s. PAK belongs to a family of kinases that includes the S. cerevisiae STE20 gene product (Leberer et al., 1992; Ramer and Davis, 1993) which acts upstream of the pheromone response mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (Ammerer, 1994). Two other related S. cerevisiae kinases Cla4p 2F. Cvrckova, C. Di Virgilio, E. Manser, J. R. Pringle, and K. Nasmyth, in press. and a putative gene product present in the yeast genome we designate as Sc-PAK show homology to PAK in their putative kinase and Cdc42-binding domains. The use of a [γ-32P]GTP-p21 overlay technique has allowed us to identify at least eight mammalian candidate target proteins for Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA (Manser et al., 1994). The brain-enriched p65PAK co-purified with a number of kinases of similar size also identified in [γ-32P]GTP-Cdc42 overlays. A human PAK designated hPAK65 has been reported to be ubiquitously expressed (Martin et al., 1995) and probably represents the human homologue of the ubiquitous rat p62 Cdc42/Rac1 binding protein. Thus although PAK kinases are most abundant in the brain, they appear to be a common target for Cdc42 and Rac “molecular switches” in all mammalian cells. Two mammalian Cdc42 isoforms have been identified (Munemitsu et al., 1990; Shinjo et al., 1990). Here we describe a novel PAK cDNA (designated β-PAK) encoding a protein which is closely related to our previously published sequence (now termed α-PAK) and also to the hPAK65 cDNA (Martin et al., 1995). The putative protein products exhibit remarkable conservation of amino acid residues in their kinase and p21-binding domains. Despite this similarity it has been possible to establish the relationship between the α- and β-cDNAs and PAK species found in the brain based on differences in their biochemical properties. In vitro translated α- and β-PAK exhibit relative molecular masses of 68,000 and 65,000 Da, respectively. A peptide sequence derived from purified p65PAK has been found to be specific for the β-PAK isoform. We show that, in a manner similar to purified p65PAK, binding of Cdc42 to recombinant β-PAK kinase, but not to α-PAK, is down-regulated upon kinase activation. A subclone containing bovine PAK cDNA derived from polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with degenerate primers and encoding part of the kinase domain (Manser et al., 1994) was used as a probe to screen a rat brain cortex cDNA library (λZAP, Stratagene). Two filters (Hybond N (Amersham Corp.), 20 × 20 cm) containing DNA from 4 × 104 bacteriophage plaques were hybridized overnight in 0.5 M sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 7% SDS, 10% formamide at 55°C and washed in 1 × SSC at 60°C. Positive plaques (~30) were taken through further rounds of purification and excised in vivo as plasmids (in pBluescript SK) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Three similar clones were identified whose restriction maps did not correspond to α-PAK. One of these clones contained the complete coding sequence of a predicted 61-kDa protein (β-PAK). The region from this clone shown in Fig. 1 was sequenced completely on both strands using restriction subclones and specific oligonucleotide primers. Because of the presence of nonconservative residues at α-H73, C92, and N258 in our published sequence (Manser et al., 1994), we re-sequenced these regions of the α-PAK cDNA with oligonucleotide primers to resolve apparent sequencing ambiguities. The cDNA was confirmed to encode proline at position 73, valine at position 92, and serine at position 258 (Fig. 2); the GenBank™ entry has been amended appropriately.Figure 2Alignment of PAK-related protein kinases.

The supernatant fractions after 100,000 × g/30 min spin were stored at −70°C with 5% added glycerol. Rho-p21-binding proteins were detected as described previously (Manser et al., 1994). Recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)/α-PAK was expressed from pGEX-2T plasmid (BamHI/EcoRI cut) containing PAK cDNA sequence that includes the initiator methionine. At the 5′ end (N terminus) a PCR-engineered BamHI linker sequence (5′ GGA TCC ACA ATG-→) was inserted, and at the 3′ end an EcoRI cloning site was used. GST/α-PAK 1-251 was subsequently created by removing the cDNA coding sequence from the internal BglII site to the 3′ EcoRI site and ligating the flushed ends. Recombinant β-PAK was expressed from pGEX-4T-2 (SmaI/XhoI cut) containing cDNA sequence having at the 5′ end a PCR-engineered SmaI linker sequence (CCC GGG AAA ATG-→) and at the 3′ utilizing the SK-plasmid-derived XhoI site. PCR-derived sequences were in all cases checked by sequencing. These constructs were introduced into the BL21 Escherichia coli strain for protein production. Cells grown to A600 (1 cm) of 0.6 in 50 μg/ml ampicillin were induced for 4-6 h at 25°C in the presence of 0.5 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. Fusion proteins of recombinant kinases and p21s were purified on glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia-LKB) as described previously (Manser et al., 1992). Recombinant GST/α-PAK (200 μg) was used as an immunogen in rabbits at 4-week intervals. Serum was collected and affinity-purified on 2 mg/ml GST/α-PAK1-251 protein coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose (Sigma) and eluted with 100 mM glycine-HCl (pH 2.5), 0.05% Triton X-100. The first 2 column volumes were neutralized with Tris/HCl (pH 8.5) and used at 1:500 dilution for Western blots. Filters were blocked for 1 h in 3% skimmed milk prior to incubation with primary anti-PAK antibodies (1:500) in phosphate-buffered saline, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 h at room temperature. Filters were incubated with 1:4000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-coupled second antibodies (DAKO) for 1 h. Bands were visualized with hyperfilm in the presence of luminol (Amersham). For immunoprecipitation the rabbit reticulocyte lysate was diluted to 4 mg/ml in tissue extraction buffer. Extracts (100 μl) were incubated with 10 μl of affinity-purified antibody for 1 h at 4°C collected on 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma), washed with 200 μl of extraction buffer, then 400 μl of phosphate-buffered saline + 1% Triton X-100 and eluted in SDS sample buffer. Kinase reactions were carried out in buffer containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.05% Triton X-100 with 20 μM [γ-32P]ATP. For “in-gel” kinase reactions standard 9% polyacrylamide gels were cast containing 0.1 mg/ml myelin basic protein and processed as described (Kameshita et al., 1989). In-gel phosphorylation was performed in kinase buffer containing 10 μCi/ml of 10 μM [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min, then gels washed in phosphate-buffered saline (2 × 10 min), stained with Coomassie Blue dye, and dried for autoradiography. Overlays of SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresed tissue extracts with [γ-32P]GTP-labeled Cdc42 have indicated that there are a number of different proteins of Mr 62,000-68,000 with similar p21 binding characteristics as the purified p65-PAK (Manser et al., 1994). Of these, the p62 protein is apparently present at similar concentrations in all tissues, whereas the larger species are more highly expressed in the central nervous system. A rat brain cortex cDNA library was screened with the 400-base pair bovine PCR-generated cDNA corresponding to bovine α-PAK kinase domain sequence. In addition to the clone reported previously (Manser et al., 1994), three clones from a total of 30 “positives” in this screen were found by restriction mapping to consist of overlapping sequences derived from mRNA of a related kinase. One encompassed the entire coding region of this kinase, and a region of 2247 nucleotides was sequenced on both strands (Fig. 1). The entire open reading frame of 544 amino acids, from nucleotide 61 to 1693, shows a striking similarity to the rat PAK we described previously and hPAK65 (Martin et al., 1995) as shown in Fig. 2. We term the related kinases we have isolated α- and β-PAK. The α- and β-PAKs show 74% identity at the DNA level and 79% identity at the amino acid level. The hPAK65 amino acid sequence is equally related to α- and β-PAKs and is almost identical to a rat isoform we have designated as γ-PAK. 3M. Teo, E. Manser, and L. Lim, in press. All three mammalian PAKs have conserved p21-binding and kinase domains which they share with the three yeast PAK-like kinases (Fig. 2). The mammalian PAKs also show conservation outside of these regions; the greatest sequence divergence between them is in the “linker” sequence of ~100 amino acids that lies between the p21-binding and kinase domains. The N-terminal hPAK65 sequence appears truncated relative to the rat α- and β-isoforms (Fig. 2; see “Discussion”). Labeled divergent cDNA sequences of α- and β-PAK were used to probe Northern blots containing mRNA isolated from various rat tissues (Fig. 3). The 4-kilobase α-PAK mRNA was expressed predominantly in the brain and at lower levels in the spleen. Surprisingly β-PAK (with a 1.7-kilobase open reading frame) appears to be translated from a 9-kilobase mRNA only detected in brain and at low level in testis (the relative weakness of the β-PAK signal was consistent with in situ hybridization results). We performed in situ hybridization with specific oligonucleotides to determine the regional expression pattern of the two kinases (Fig. 4). α-PAK mRNA was more abundant than β-PAK mRNA, and exposure times were chosen to determine brain regional distribution of α- and β-mRNAs, rather than to compare their absolute levels. Equivalent sections hybridized to α- and β-specific probes are shown side by side (Fig. 4). In both cases sense oligonucleotide probes were used to determine “background” signals (data not shown). α-PAK mRNA was expressed in the cortex with highest levels of hybridization over cell layers IV and V, in limbic regions of the cortex, and in piriform cortex (Fig. 4A). β-PAK mRNA was also relatively high in piriform cortex while in the cortex enriched in layers II-III and V. Both mRNAs were expressed in the hippocampal formation (Fig. 4B) in both the CA1 and dentate gyrus. α-PAK mRNA was highly expressed in subiculum (Fig. 4C) and showed some of its highest expression in the ventral tier nuclei of the thalamus. Here β-PAK mRNA exhibited only low expression, but showed greater enrichment in the hypothalamus; in medial preoptic (Fig. 4A), ventromedial and arcuate nuclei (Fig. 4B). Relatively high levels of β-PAK mRNA were present in the monoaminergic dorsal raphe nucleus (Fig. 4C) and locus coeruleus. Interestingly, α-PAK mRNA was highly expressed in a number of neuronal groups associated with motor function, including the pontine nucleus, reticulotegmental, external cuneate, and lateral reticular nuclei, which send mossy fiber input to the cerebellum (Fig. 4, D and E). α-PAK mRNA was also highly expressed in scattered neurons in the pontine and medullary reticular formation, and in patches of cells comprising the linear nucleus of the medulla, with moderate expression in the inferior olivary nucleus which provides climbing fiber input to the cerebellum (see Fig. 5 for detailed comparisons with protein expression). Both α- and β-PAK mRNAs were highly enriched in the embryonic central nervous system (Fig. 4F) with relatively little expression elsewhere, confirming the specificity of the probes. Within the nervous system we sought to establish which type of cells might be responsible for the strong expression of α-PAK. Fig. 5 demonstrates that in a mid portion of the medulla there was co-localization of the in situ hybridization signal and anti-α-PAK immunoreactivity to the linear nuclei. High powered photomicrographs of these regions showed large neurons with high densities of silver grains adjacent to smaller unlabeled cells (which only show counterstaining). Within large neurons of the pontine reticular formation both the cell bodies and processes were strongly immunoreactive. In the cerebellum, there were high levels of expression of α-PAK mRNA (but not of β-PAK mRNA), which at higher magnification could be localized to granule cells, basket cells, and deep cerebellar nuclei (data not shown). PAK antibody immunoprecipitated both α- and β-PAK in vitro translated proteins derived from the two cDNAs (utilizing the endogenous ATG start codons Fig. 6B). The relative masses of the translation products were 68,000 and 65,000 Da, respectively. This is consistent with the presence of three distinct bands in brain extracts, representing the different PAK isoforms, as detected by Cdc42 overlay (Fig. 6A). Heat treatment of the in vitro products in SDS buffer to release the immunoprecipitates caused some streaking but did not alter the relative mobility of the kinases compared with the unheated proteins (Fig. 6B, first two lanes). The mobility of the in vitro translated proteins suggests that α-PAK corresponds to the p68 Cdc42-binding protein detected in brain extracts (Manser et al., 1994), and β-PAK to a brain protein that elutes last from the Cdc42 affinity column during protein purification (the previously described p65PAK). Tryptic peptides obtained previously from within the kinase domain of affinity-purified bovine PAK corresponded to regions of α- and β-PAK which are identical in sequence. However confirmatory evidence for the presence of β-PAK in affinity-purified rat brain PAK (Fig. 6C, lane 3) was obtained from a cyanogen bromide digest of the protein. The peptides were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and overlaid with [γ-32P]GTP-Cdc42. Lanes 1 and 2, with 45 and 5 μg of digested protein(s), contains a Cdc42-binding polypeptide with apparent mass of 34 kDa which was subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The obtained sequence (M)APEEXNXXAxLXXIFPGGG was not informative at every position but corresponds to the predicted β-PAK product following cleavage at M37 (underlined in Fig. 1). Since this region of β-PAK is divergent from both α-PAK and hPAK65 sequences, it is highly likely that the peptide is derived from the β-PAK gene product. Although a mass of >30 kDa for a CNBr-generated peptide of β-PAK is not consistent with its C terminus being derived from cleavage at β-M138, there are many documented cases of methionines which show inefficient CNBr cleavage, and lower bands were also detected by [γ-32P]GTP-Cdc42 (Fig. 6C). We cannot estimate the stoichiometry of α- and β-PAK by CNBr digestion and overlay because the α-PAK p21-binding domain is probably destroyed by cleavage at at an internal methionine (α-M99), a position occupied by a conservative isoleucine in β-PAK(I94). Affinity-purified antibodies to α-PAK residues 1-251 showed strong immunoreactivity to proteins of 65-68 kDa on Western blots of brain extracts (Fig. 7A). Similar sized proteins were recognized by the antiserum in spleen also expressing the α-PAK mRNA. In the testis an immunoreactive band was detected at longer exposure times whose mobility was greater than the broad band detected in the spleen (Fig. 7B), consistent with the presence of testicular β-PAK mRNA. It is probable that the presence of multiple bands on Western blots is also the result of different phosphorylation states of the PAKs in vivo. All of these immunoreactive bands corresponded to proteins larger than the ubiquitous p62 band detected by [γ-32P]GTP-Cdc42 overlay (Fig. 7C). As discussed later, the p62 is also a PAK isoform we designate as γ-PAK3, but which is not recognized by the antiserum. We have expressed full-length α- and β-PAK as ~95-kDa GST fusion proteins in E. coli to study kinase activation using homogeneous preparations. Because the β-PAK sequence contained additional polylinker-derived sequence, it has a lower mobility than recombinant α-PAK. Thrombin cleavage of this GST/PAK fusion protein caused some internal cleavage of the kinase and thus gave truncated products. We therefore used the GST fusion protein, since it showed similar p21 activation to the “native” purified protein (Manser et al., 1994). Fig. 8A shows the activities of glutathione-Sepharose-purified GST/PAK in the absence and presence of GST/Cdc42. Autophosphorylation of recombinant α- and β-PAK and concomitant phosphorylation of myelin basic protein (MBP) substrate were significantly activated in vitro by adding purified recombinant GTPγS-Cdc42. This was observed previously with affinity-purified native brain PAK, which from data described in this paper corresponds to β-PAK gene product. The recombinant β-PAK exhibited higher basal activity, which might be related to its phosphorylation state in E. coli. Since the behavior of the p68 α-PAK has not been described previously, we examined its activation in more detail. Activation of recombinant α-PAK occurred only with GTPγS-Rac and GTPγS-Cdc42, but not GTPγS-RhoA (Fig. 8B). In their GDP forms all p21s were inactive (exchange of GDP into GTPase-deficient GTP-Cdc42V12 protein probably being incomplete during the standard 4-min period). Quantification of the MBP phosphorylation (indicated as relative activity) showed that GTP-Cdc42 was more effective than GTP-Rac1 under these assay conditions. Following complete activation (1 h in the presence of GTPγS-Rac or GTPγS-Cdc42), α-PAK exhibited slower mobility under SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis (Fig. 8C), as seen with the purified protein (Manser et al., 1994) and many other protein kinases. The hyperphosphorylated kinase exhibited some size heterogeneity in its activated state. After separation from the GTPγS-p21s by SDS-PAGE, α-PAK was still active as determined by an in-gel kinase assay against MBP (Fig. 8C). No labeling was seen in the absence of MBP in the gel (data not shown). This supports the model we presented previously in which the autophosphorylated kinase, after dissociation of p21, would remain active in the absence of dephosphorylation. The ability of this active kinase to phosphorylate MBP was tested (under similar conditions to the co-activation assay in Fig. 8B). Based on the initial rates of phosphorylation (Fig. 8D), the activity of the phosphorylated form was found to be more than 300 times higher than the unphosphorylated α-PAK. We had observed previously that purified p65PAK upon activation exhibited lower affinity for both GTP-Rac1 and GTP-Cdc42 in overlay assays (Manser et al., 1994). Similar experiments were conducted with recombinant α- and β-PAK proteins. Fig. 9A shows the binding of [γ-32P]GTP-Cdc42 to normal and activated kinase in a typical overlay experiment. Averaged data from three independent experiments are shown below. The data clearly demonstrated that only β-PAK exhibits down-regulation of p21 binding upon activation. Since this effect is probably related to the phosphorylation state of the kinase, we sought to mimic the effect using the N-terminal of β-PAK (and of α-PAK both expressed as a GST fusion proteins cf Fig. 9C) exogenously phosphorylated by full-length β-PAK. Although phosphorylation to completion could be observed by monitoring the upward mobility shift of the N-terminal fusion proteins, similar to that seen with the whole kinase (Fig. 9B), this did not result in any significant change in affinity for the [γ-32P]GTP-Cdc42 by β-PAK. It therefore seems that the down-regulation of Cdc42 binding either requires the whole β-kinase (conformational effects) or a specific intramolecular phosphorylation site is involved. Interestingly when the recombinant α-PAK kinase domain alone was expressed in E. coli, the fusion protein exhibited no kinase activity, nor could it be phosphorylated by full-length PAKs (data not shown). The Rac1/Cdc42-binding domain of PAK shows sequence homology to the Cdc42-specific binding domain of the tyrosine kinase ACK (Manser et al., 1993). This region is highly conserved in α- and β-PAK (Fig. 2). Although PAK binding to Rac1 appeared significantly weaker than to Cdc42, their ability to activate the autophosphorylation and MBP kinase activity of purified p65-PAK depended on the assay conditions (Manser et al., 1994). As illustrated in Fig. 9C, by normalizing the labeling of the p21s using excess (cold) GTP in the “exchange” reaction, the amount of [γ-32P]GTP-Cdc42 or [γ-32P]GTP-Rac1 bound to the N-terminal region of α- and β- PAK in overlays was found to be the same (±10%). Note there is no potential autophosphorylation of the construct. The labeling of Rac1 with [γ-32P]GTP is normally poor, probably because of its high intrinsic GTPase activity during the exchange reaction in low magnesium buffer (Menard et al., 1992). The heterogeneity in Cdc42-binding proteins with apparent molecular mass between 60 and 70 kDa in different tissues suggested these kinases to be expressed from a number of related genes. The identity and relationship of two of these kinases (α- and β-PAK) have now been established through isolation of their cDNAs. Amino acid sequence comparison between the two mammalian PAKs described here and hPAK65 (Martin et al., 1995) reveals functionally important regions of the protein. In particular the p21-binding domain showed almost no sequence divergence. PAK kinases also contain polyacidic and proline-rich sequences between the p21-binding and kinase domains. The use of purified recombinant proteins has enabled us to confirm that addition of GTPγS-p21 was sufficient to activate the kinase in the absence of any factor that might have co-purified with brain-derived native PAK. This activation by Rac1 or Cdc42 was achieved through the p21-mediated autophosphorylation of the kinase. Recombinant (p68) α-PAK showed robust activity toward MBP in the presence of GTPγS-p21, as we have described for purified p65PAK (β-PAK). Here we show with recombinant α-PAK protein that there is a 300-fold increase in activity following p21-mediated autophosphorylation. While α-PAK was expressed predominantly in the brain, both mRNA and protein were detected in the spleen. Within the immune system it appears that PAK-related kinases are relatively abundant; the report that neutrophil p62 and p68 Cdc42/Rac-binding proteins are not reactive to antibodies to the conserved PAK kinase domain (Martin et al., 1995) is in conflict with our demonstration that antibodies generated against α-PAK recognize the neutrophil p68 protein (Prigmore et al., 1995). The p65 β-PAK appears to be more restricted in its expression outside of the nervous system. We have been unable to correlate the PAK expression pattern with any known signaling molecule or receptor, but the strikingly restricted expression pattern of both isoforms lends credence to the idea that α- and β-PAKs may be coupled to specific Rho-p21 pathways in the brain. Another Rho-p21 interacting protein with highly restricted expression is the RacGAP β2-chimaerin, which is only present in cerebellar granule cells (Leung et al., 1994) where high expression of α-PAK mRNA is also observed. The hPAK65 mRNA has been reported to be expressed in a wide variety of tissues and in cultured cells. We have obtained peptide sequence data allowing the cloning of the ubiquitous rat p62 Cdc42/Rac binding protein which we designate as γ-PAK.3 Because the published hPAK65 cDNA contains, in the 5′-noncoding sequence and 38 base pairs of putative open reading frame, sequence identical to human placental lactogen (somatomammotropin, Seeburg et al., 1977), this region of the hPAK cDNA may have arisen as a library artifact. The only biochemical property reported for this recombinant enzyme that differs significantly from those of brain-purified p65PAK is that there is no decrease in Cdc42 binding of activated hPAK65 (Martin et al., 1995). Our study clearly shows that a difference in this respect exists between the α- and β-isoforms in that β-PAK, but not α-PAK, binds GTP-Cdc42 more weakly after activation of the kinase. This is consistent with β-PAK cDNA encoding the purified p65PAK protein which exhibits similar behavior. Autophosphorylation of α-PAK occurs on at least 6 residues in the N-terminal regulatory region. 4E. Manser, C. Chong, T. Leung, and L. Lim, unpublished observations. There is, therefore, potential for similar phosphorylation events in the β-PAK, perhaps altering the conformation of the p21-binding domain such that its affinity is affected. The loss of affinity of β-PAK for GTP-Cdc42 after activation of the kinase suggests that the p21 in this case could amplify its signal by activating several kinase molecules, or alternatively it allows the activated kinase to act at a different site. In contrast, α-PAK activity may co-localize with GTP-p21 and remain as part of the signaling complex. Although functions for PAK kinases in relation to the roles of Cdc42 and Rac1 in mammalian cells is yet to be established, we have been able to demonstrate that Ste20p, a kinase required for the mating response pathway in S. cerevisiae (Leberer et al., 1992; Ramer and Davis, 1993), requires GTP-Cdc42p for its function. 5Z.-S. Zhao, T. Leung, E. Manser, and L. Lim, in press. As in higher organisms, there appear to be a family of PAK kinases in yeast (Blumer and Johnson, 1994); the 36-kDa yeast kinase previously thought to only contain a kinase domain is now confirmed as having an N-terminal p21-binding domain (Fig. 2). The role of Ste20p as a kinase acting above the pheromone-responsive mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade may point to the involvement of mammalian Cdc42 and Rac proteins in cell proliferation and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2020960374,"The enzymatic activity of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP kinases) increases in response to agents acting on a variety of cell surface receptors, including receptors linked to heterotrimeric G proteins of the Gi and Gq family. Recently, it has been shown that stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors, which are typical of those that act through Gs to activate adenylyl cyclases, potently activates MAP kinases in the heart, resulting in the hypertrophy of the cardiac muscle (Lazou, A., Bogoyevitch, M. A., Clerk, A., Fuller, S. J., Marshall, C. J., and Sudgen, P. H.(1994) Circ. Res. 75, 938-941). We have observed that exposure of COS-7 cells to a β-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, raises intracellular levels of cAMP and effectively activates protein kinase A (PKA) and an epitope-tagged MAP kinase. However, MAP kinase stimulation by isoproterenol was neither mimicked by expression of an activated mutant of Gαs, nor by treatment with PKA-stimulating agents. Moreover, pretreatment of COS-7 with a permeable cAMP analog, 8-Br-cAMP, markedly decreased MAP kinase activation by either isoproterenol or epidermal growth factor. Thus, in COS-7 cells cAMP and PKA do not appear to mediate MAP kinase activation by β-adrenergic receptors. Signaling from β-adrenergic receptors to MAP kinase was inhibited by transfection of a chimeric molecule consisting of the CD8 receptor and the carboxyl terminus of the β-adrenergic receptor kinase, which includes the βγ-binding domain. MAP kinase activation by isoproterenol was not affected by depletion of protein kinase C, but it was completely abolished by expression of Ras-inhibiting molecules. We conclude that signaling from β-adrenergic receptors to MAP kinase involves an activating signal mediated by βγ subunits acting on a Ras-dependent pathway and a Gαs-induced inhibitory signal mediated by cAMP and PKA. The balance between these two opposing mechanisms of regulation would be expected to control the MAP kinase response to β-adrenergic agonists as well as to other biologically active agents known to act on Gs coupled receptors, including a number of hormones, neurotransmitters, and lipid mediators.

These kinases actively participate in converting extracellular stimuli to intracellular signals affecting the expression of genes necessary for a number of biological functions, including cell growth and differentiation(2Cobb M.H. Boulton T.G. Robbins D.T. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 965-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The pathway linking cell surface receptors to MAP kinases has just begun to be elucidated. The tyrosine kinase class of receptors signals to MAP kinase by a multistep process. In the case of ligand-activated EGF receptors, it involves binding to the adaptor protein GRB2 which causes the recruitment to the membrane of SOS, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for p21ras(3Schlessinger J.

This initiates the activation of a linear cascade of protein kinases including c-Raf (5Kyriakis J.M. App H. Zhang X.F. Banerjee P. Brautigan D.L. Rapp U.R. Avruch J.

Science. 1992; 258: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar), which ultimately phosphorylate MAP kinases on both threonine and tyrosine residues, resulting in a dramatic increase in their enzymatic activity (7Crews C.M. Alessandrini A. Erickson R.L. Science. 1992; 258: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). In turn, MAP kinases phosphorylate and modulate the function of key enzymes and nuclear transcription factors(8Pelech S.L. Curr.

Recent reports indicate that MAP kinases can be activated by a number of receptors linked to Gi. For example, triggering α2-adrenergic(9Alblas J. van Corven E.J. Hordijk P.L. Milligan G.

Activation of MAP kinase appears not to be exclusively linked to cell proliferation, as only a few of these receptors can signal cell proliferation. In this regard, accumulating evidence suggests that persistent activation of the MAP kinase might lead to differentiation or hypertrophy in a cell type-specific manner (14Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar). For example, stimulation of nerve growth factor receptors in PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells or insulin receptors in L1 murine preadipocytic cell line provokes a marked and prolonged activation of MAP kinases and induces cells to acquire a fully differentiated phenotype(15Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1845) Google Scholar, 16Porras A. Muszynski K. Rapp U.R. Santos E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12741-12748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, hormonal stimulation of a number of G protein-coupled receptors naturally expressed in the heart elevates the enzymatic activity of MAP kinases and causes the hypertrophy of muscle cells(17Lazou A. Bogoyevitch M.A. Clerk A. Fuller S.J. Marshall C.J. Sudgen P.H. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 938-941Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Interestingly, MAP kinase activation and the hypertrophic response was shown to be elicited by agonist acting on receptors coupled to either Gq or Gs, such as α1 and β-adrenergic receptors, respectively(17Lazou A. Bogoyevitch M.A. Clerk A. Fuller S.J. Marshall C.J. Sudgen P.H. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 938-941Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The latter represents one of the few examples of receptors coupled to Gs activating MAP kinase so far reported(17Lazou A. Bogoyevitch M.A. Clerk A. Fuller S.J. Marshall C.J. Sudgen P.H. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 938-941Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This is particularly interesting because β-adrenergic receptors couple to adenylyl cyclases to raise intracellular levels of cAMP(18Lefcowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4993-4996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and recently available data indicate that elevated cAMP can block MAP kinase activation by oncogenic Ras proteins(19Burgering B.M.T. Pronk G. van Weeren P.C. Chardin P. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4211-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), tyrosine kinase receptors(20Graves L.M. Bornfeld K.E. Raines E.W. Potts B.C.

Chem. 1994; 269: 3534-3538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, receptors coupled to Gs would be expected to diminish rather than to stimulate MAP kinase activity.In this study, we have used the expression of an epitope-tagged MAP kinase in COS-7 cells as an experimental model to study the signaling pathway connecting endogenously expressed β-adrenergic receptors to MAP kinase. We have found that signaling from these Gs-coupled receptors to MAP kinase has two distinctive components: an activating pathway mediated by βγ subunits acting through Ras, and a Gαs-induced inhibitory signal mediated by cAMP and PKA.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials[γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mM) was from DuPont NEN. Tissue culture products used were Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and fetal calf serum (Advanced Biotechnologies Inc.). Isoproterenol, propranolol, H-8, and 12-0-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13 acetate (TPA) were purchased from Calbiochem, and EGF from Upstate Biotechnology. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma.Expression PlasmidsA 700-base pair DNA fragment encoding the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the CD8 lymphocyte-specific receptor (from codon 1 to codon 209) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using human CD8 cDNA (25Littman D.R. Thomas Y. Maddon P.J. Chess L. Axel R. Cell. 1985; 40: 237-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) as a template and the oligonucleotides 5′-ATAAGCTTCTCgagcttcgagccaagc-3′ and 5′-AAGGATCCcctgtggttgcagtaa-3′ (added nucleotides are depicted in uppercase). The resulting DNA was subcloned as a HindIII-BamHI fragment in the pcDNA expression vector (Invitrogen).A DNA fragment encoding the carboxyl-terminal 222 amino acids of human bARK1(26Pitcher J.A. Inglese J. Higgins J.B. Arriza J.L. Casey P.J. Kim C. Benovic J.L. Kwatra M.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

Coso and J. S. Gutkind, unpublished results. and then transferred as a BamHI/NotI fragment to pcDNA-CD8. The resulting DNA construct, designated pcDNA-CD8-βARK-C, was expected to express the extracellular and transmembrane domains of CD8 fused to an intracellular domain containing the βγ binding portion of human βARK and a COOH-terminal Myc epitope.Transient Expression in COS-7 CellsCOS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Plasmid DNA transfection of COS-7 cells was performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique(28Wigler M. Silverstein S. Lee L.S. Pellicer A. Cheng Y.C. Axel R. Cell. 1977; 11: 223-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar).MAP Kinase AssayCOS-7 cells were cotransfected with the different DNA constructs and an expression plasmid containing an amino-terminal hemagglutinin-tagged murine ERK2 cDNA (pcDNA-HA-MAPK)(29Her J.H. Lakhani S. Rall T.B. Sturgill T.W. Wigler M.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), the protein product of which can be efficiently recognized by a murine monoclonal antibody 12CA5(29Her J.H. Lakhani S. Rall T.B. Sturgill T.W. Wigler M.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Expression of the tagged MAP kinase was verified by Western blot (not shown). Forty-eight h after transfection, cells were serum-starved overnight and then stimulated with the different agents. After the indicated periods of time, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline solution, and lysed in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mM EGTA, 40 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM sodium vanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin. Following centrifugation, clarified supernatants were immunoprecipitated with an anti-hemagglutinin monoclonal antibody 12 CA5 (Babco) for 1 h at 4°C, and immunocomplexes were recovered with the aid of protein G-Sepharose. Pellets were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline solution supplemented with 1% Nonidet P-40 and 2 mM sodium vanadate, once with 0.5 M LiCl in 100 mM Tris, pH 7.5, and once with kinase reaction buffer (12.5 mM MOPS, pH 7.5, 12.5 mM β-glycerophosphate, 7.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM sodium fluoride, 0.5 mM vanadate). Reactions were performed in 30 μl volume of kinase reaction buffer containing 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP/reaction, 20 μM unlabeled ATP, and 1.5 mg/ml myelin basic protein (MBP) (Sigma) at 30°C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by addition of 5 × Laemmli buffer, boiled, and electrophoresed in 12.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Phosphorylated MBP was visualized by autoradiography. Under these experimental conditions we did not detect any MBP phosphorylating activity in parallel immunoprecipitates from control, vector transfected cells, nor we observed any direct effect on the immunoprecipitated MAP kinase by any of the PKA stimulating or blocking agents described below (data not shown).cAMP AssaysCOS-7 cells were grown to 90% confluence in 24-well plates. Medium was replaced by Eagle's medium containing 1 mM 3-isobutyl-methylxanthine, and the experimental compounds were added for 5 min. The incubation was stopped by replacing medium with ice-cold 0.1 N HCl. Cyclic AMP levels were determined in supernatants of neutralized samples using a commercial [3H]cAMP assay kit (Amersham Corp.), as described(30Stephens E.V. Kalinek G. Brann M.R. Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 19-26PubMed Google Scholar).Protein Kinase A AssaysCOS-7 cells were grown to confluence in 6-well plates and kept overnight in serum-free conditions after which agents were added for 5 min. Cells were then lysed in a buffer identical to that used for MAP kinase assays, and the activity of protein kinase A was determined using a commercial non-radioactive PKA assay kit (SpinZyme, Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions.Phosphatidylinositol HydrolysisCOS-7 cells were incubated in 24-well plates with 1 μCi/ml [3H]myo-inositol for 24 h. Cells were incubated for an additional 4 h in serum-free medium and stimulated with experimental agents for 30 min in the presence of 10 mM LiCl. Inositol phosphates were extracted and analyzed by ion-exchange chromatography, as described(31Gutkind J.S. Novotny E.A. Brann M.R. Robbins K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4703-4708Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar).Immunofluorescent StainingCOS-7 cells transfected with the different plasmids were immunostained with anti-CD8 monoclonal antibody (Dako T-8) (1:100) followed by a secondary goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate, as described previously(32Notario V. Gutkind J.S. Imaizumi S. Katamine S. Robbins K.C. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3129-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cells were viewed under an Olympus-AHTB fluorescence microscope and photographed at a magnification of ×250.RESULTSTo determine whether stimulation of endogenously expressed β-adrenergic receptors induces MAP kinase activation, COS-7 cells were transfected with an expression plasmid carrying the cDNA for an epitope-tagged MAP kinase, serum starved, and then treated with increasing concentrations of isoproterenol for 5 min. As seen in Fig. 1A, the β-adrenergic agonist effectively induced MAP kinase activation in a dosedependent fashion, reaching a maximum at concentrations of isoproterenol above 10 μM. MAP kinase activation was also time dependent, reaching its maximum between 3-5 min (Fig. 1B). Pretreatment of cells with the β-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (4 μM) completely abolished MAP kinase activation by isoproterenol but not by EGF (Fig. 1B), thus confirming that stimulation of MAP kinase in response to isoproterenol is mediated by β-adrenergic receptors.β-Adrenergic receptors are typical of those coupled through Gs to the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase(18Lefcowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4993-4996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, addition of isoproterenol would be expected to promote an increase in cAMP levels and consequently to activate PKA(33Casey P.J. Gilman A.G. J. Biol Chem. 1988; 263: 2577-2580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To study whether this second messenger-generating system was responsible for activating MAP kinase, we treated cells with a number of agents known to raise cAMP levels and/or to activate PKA. As shown in Fig. 2, treatment for 5 min with 100 μM isoproterenol, 10 μM forskolin, or expression of a constitutively activated mutant of Gαs, Gαs QL (34Landis C.A. Masters S.B. Spada A. Pace A.M. Bourne H.R. Vallar L. Nature. 1989; 340: 692-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar) induced a remarkable increase in cAMP levels as compared to control cells. In contrast, neither EGF nor serum elicited any demonstrable effect on intracellular cAMP. Consistent with these results, PKA activity was also greatly enhanced in cells treated with isoproterenol, forskolin, or in cells transfected with a constitutively activated mutant of Gαs (Table 1). Furthermore, treatment of COS-7 cells with the cell-permeable analog of cAMP, 8-Br-cAMP (1 mM), elicited a remarkable increase in PKA activity (Table 1). However, whereas isoproterenol induced a 10-fold increase in MAP kinase activity, neither 8 Br-cAMP nor Gαs QL were able to activate MAP kinase to any significant extent (Table 1). Thus, the cAMP and PKA response to isoproterenol might not be sufficient to explain its activating effect on MAP kinase. On the other hand, the fact that forskolin can also elevate MAP kinase activity is more likely to result from some of the pleiotropic effects of this drug (35Laurenza A. Sutkowski E.M. Seamon K.B. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1989; 10: 442-447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) rather than as a consequence of stimulating the cAMP/PKA pathway.Figure 2Effect of cAMP raising agents on intracellular levels of cAMP. COS-7 cells transfected with insertless expression vector (control) or transfected with Gαs-QL were grown to 90% confluence in 24-well plates. Medium was replaced by Eagle's medium containing 1 mM 3-isobutyl-methylxantine, and cells were stimulated with 10% serum, 10 μM isoproterenol, 10 μM forskolin, or 100 ng/ml EGF for 5 min and processed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results represent the average ± S.E. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Recently, it has been shown that in certain cell types cAMP-raising agents can potently inhibit the activation of MAP kinase in response to a variety of mitogens(19Burgering B.M.T.

Jalin K. van Corven E.J. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3534-3538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether increased cAMP levels and PKA activity would affect β-adrenergic receptor-induced MAP kinase activation. To that end, COS-7 cells were transfected with the activated form of Gαs or were pretreated with 8-Br-cAMP (1 mM) for 20 min prior to stimulation with isoproterenol or EGF. Both cotransfection with Gαs QL (not shown) and pretreatment with 8-Br-cAMP markedly decreased MAP kinase activation by either isoproterenol or EGF, as shown in Fig. 3. This effect of 8-Br-cAMP was blocked when added together with a PKA-specific inhibitor, H-8 (5 μM)(36Hidaka H. Inagaki M. Kawamoto S. Sasaki Y. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5036-5041Crossref PubMed Scopus (2321) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, under these conditions H-8 restored MAP kinase activation by isoproterenol and EGF almost to the levels found in control, unpretreated cells (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, treatment of cells with the PKA inhibitor potentiated MAP kinase activation by isoproterenol, up to 2-fold after 5 min of stimulation, when MAP kinase activation is at its peak (Fig. 4 B). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the cAMP-PKA pathway does not mediate activation of MAP kinases in response to the β-adrenergic agonist. On the contrary, this biochemical route negatively regulates the MAP kinase signaling pathway in COS-7 cells.Figure 3Effect of pretreatment with 8-Br-cAMP on MAP kinase activation. Serum-starved COS-7 cells transfected with pcDNA-HA-MAP kinase were either left untreated or pretreated for 20 min with 1 mM 8-Br-cAMP prior to stimulation with 10 μM isoproterenol or 100 ng/ml EGF for 5 min.

Clapham D.E. Nature. 1988; 333: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Although the GTP-bound α subunit was thought to be alone responsible for activating effector molecules, accumulating evidence supports an active role for the Gβγ dimers in signal transmission(38Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Nature. 1993; 365: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). To explore whether βγ complexes participate in MAP kinase stimulation by β-adrenergic receptors, we took advantage of the observation that overexpression of the α subunit of transducin (Gt) or the carboxyl-terminal domain of β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βARK) can block βγ-dependent pathways, probably by binding and sequestering free βγ dimers(39Inglese J. Koch W.J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 147-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Thus, we engineered a chimeric molecule between the extracellular and transmembrane domain of CD8 (25Littman D.R. Thomas Y. Maddon P.J. Chess L. Axel R. Cell. 1985; 40: 237-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) fused to the COOH-terminal domain of βARK, which would be expected to express CD8 antigen at the cell surface, and to localize the βARK COOH-terminal domain to the inner face of the plasma membrane. Immunofluorescence analysis of intact cells transfected with this expression construct revealed that both CD8 and CD8-βARK-C chimera were efficiently expressed (Fig. 5). No fluorescence was observed in cells transfected with the vector control or if the primary antibody was omitted (not shown). As shown in Fig. 6, coexpression of Gt (Fig. 6A) or CD8-βARK-C (Fig. 6B) nearly abolished activation of MAP kinase in response to isoproterenol. In contrast, CD8 alone had no demonstrable effect (Fig. 6B). MAP kinase activation by EGF was not affected by any these constructs, thus further demonstrating the specificity of this approach(10Crespo P. Xu N. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S.

In this report, we have embarked on a detailed analysis of the transcriptional properties of Sp4 in direct comparison to Sp1 and Sp3. Cotransfection experiments into Drosophila SL2 cells lacking endogenous Sp factors demonstrate that Sp4 is an activator protein like Sp1. However, in contrast to Sp1, Sp4 is not able to act synergistically through adjacent binding sites. The transactivation function of Sp4 resides, like that of Sp1, in the N-terminal glutamine-rich region. Sp4 can function as a target for the Sp1 activation domains in a superactivation assay, suggesting that the activation domains of Sp1 and Sp4 are functionally related. Furthermore, we show that Sp4-mediated transcriptional activation can be repressed by Sp3.

INTRODUCTIONThe properly timed and coordinated expression of eukaryotic genes requires the combinatorial action of multiple sequence-specific DNA binding proteins. These transcription factors recognize distinct promoter and enhancer elements, thereby acting positively or negatively on transcription. One of the first and best characterized mammalian transcription factors was Sp1 (1Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar, 2Kadonaga J.T. Courey A.J. Ladika J. Tjian R. Science. 1988; 242: 1566-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) which binds to GC boxes and related motifs (3Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 20-23Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (875) Google Scholar) present in many promoters. However, Sp1 is not the only protein binding to and acting through these DNA motifs. At least two other more recently cloned human proteins, designated Sp3 and Sp4, do bind with identical affinity to the same recognition sequence as Sp1 (4Hagen G. Müller S. Beato G. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Note that Sp2, yet another factor homologous to Sp1, seems to have DNA binding specificities different from Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4(5Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar).Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 represent a family of GC box binding proteins with very similar structural features. In addition to the highly conserved DNA binding domain close to the C terminus, all three proteins contain two glutamine- and serine/threonine-rich amino acid stretches in the N-terminal part of the molecule. For Sp1, the glutamine-rich domains have been identified as transactivation domains(2Kadonaga J.T. Courey A.J. Ladika J. Tjian R. Science. 1988; 242: 1566-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 6Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). Two additional domains of Sp1 (C and D) located adjacent to the zinc finger region also influence the transcriptional activation function, one being weakly basic (C) and the other (D) showing no significant homology to known activation domains(6Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). The D domain of Sp1 plays a key role in mediating the ability of Sp1 to activate transcription synergistically (7Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar).The high degree of structural conservation between Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 suggested that Sp3 and Sp4 do exert similar activation functions. A functional analysis of Sp3 using transfection experiments into mammalian cell lines and into Drosophila SL2 cells lacking endogenous Sp factors demonstrated, however, that Sp3 is not simply a functional equivalent of Sp1. Sp3 failed to activate Sp1-responsive promoter constructs. Instead, it repressed Sp1-mediated transcriptional activation(8Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 9Majello B. De Luca P. Hagen G. Suske G. Lania L.

Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1841-1848PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that Sp3 is an inhibitory member of the Sp family. The intriguing finding that Sp1 and Sp3 can exert opposite transcriptional regulation prompted us to analyze thoroughly the transcriptional properties of the Sp4 protein.We have performed cotransfection experiments into mammalian cells and into insect cells that lack endogenous Sp factors. Our studies demonstrate that Sp4 is an activator protein like Sp1. However, in contrast to Sp1, Sp4 is not able to act synergistically through adjacent binding sites. Moreover, Sp4-mediated activation is strongly enhanced (superactivated) in the presence of a non-DNA binding mutant of Sp1, suggesting that Sp1 can interact directly with Sp4. We show further that Sp4-mediated transcriptional activation is repressed by Sp3. Our results thus demonstrate that Sp4 exhibits a unique spectrum of functional properties distinct from those found for Sp1 and Sp3.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid ConstructionsIn the Gal4-Sp expression vectors, the 147 N-terminal codons of the yeast transcription factor Gal4 containing its DNA binding domain were fused to fragments coding for the N-terminal regions of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4. Expression of the fusion proteins is driven by the SV40 promoter. The construction of the Gal4-Sp3 expression vector (pSG424-Gal4-Sp3) has been described(9Majello B. De Luca P. Hagen G. Suske G. Lania L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The Gal4-Sp1 and Gal4-Sp4 expression constructs (pSG424-Gal4-Sp1 and pSG424-Gal4-Sp4) were generated by the following strategies. For plasmid pSG424-Gal4-Sp1, the region encoding the 603 N-terminal amino acids of Sp1 was obtained as a SmaI-XbaI fragment from CMV-Sp1-DBD(8Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). To generate the Gal4-Sp1 fusion protein, the BamHI (blunted)-XbaI fragment of pSG424(1-147)-Sp1 (encoding the A domain of Sp1(11Southgate C.D. Green M.R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 2496-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar)) was replaced by the SmaI-XbaI Sp1 fragment leading to pSG424-Gal4-Sp1. For plasmid pSG424-Gal4-Sp4, we first constructed a fingerless mutant of Sp4 encoding the 620 N-terminal amino acids. A 1.9-kb 1The abbreviations used are: kbkilobase(s)CATchloramphenicol acetyltransferase. HindIII-SfuI fragment from pBS-Sp4 (A8.68 in pKS (4Hagen G. Müller S. Beato G. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar)) was cloned into the HindIII site of pRC/CMV (Invitrogen) leading to pRC/CMV-Sp4-DBD. For this, we fused HindIII linkers containing stop codons in all three reading frames to the blunted SfuI sites of the Sp4 cDNA insert. To generate the Gal4-Sp4 fusion construct, the Sp1 encoding fragment in pSG424(1-147)-Sp1 was replaced by a 1.76-kb SauI (blunted)-XbaI fragment from pRC/CMV-Sp4-DBD.The reporter plasmid G5E1bSV is a derivative of the plasmid G5E1b (12Lillie J.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) and was constructed as follows. The uteroglobin promoter in the plasmid pUG(−395)CATSV (13Suske G. Lorenz W. Klug J. Gazdar A.F. Beato M. Gene Expr. 1992; 2: 339-352PubMed Google Scholar) was replaced by a 130-base pair PstI-BamHI fragment from G5E1b containing five Gal4 binding sites fused to the E1bTATA box.Sp4 expression vectors for Drosophila melanogaster Schneider cells (SL2 cells) were generated as follows. The plasmid pPacSp4 was obtained by cloning a 3-kb HindIII-NotI fragment from pBS-Sp4 into the single BamHI site of pPac via decameric BamHI linkers. Sp4 expression plasmids containing the Ubx leader sequence (pPac773Sp4 and pPac747Sp4) were generated by replacing the Sp1 cDNA in pPacSp1 (6Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar) by the 2.7-kb SmaI or the 2.6-kb blunted SauI-XhoI fragment, respectively, from the pBS-Sp4 plasmid A8O (4Hagen G. Müller S. Beato G. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar) via 8-mer and 12-mer XhoI linkers. The expression plasmids for Sp1 (pPacSp1) and fingerless Sp3 (pPacSp3ΔZnD = pPacSp3-DBD in (8Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar)) were described previously(6Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar, 8Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). The expression plasmid for the fingerless Sp1 mutant (pPacSp1ΔZnD), in which the 165 C-terminal codons of Sp1 were removed, was obtained by replacing the Sp4 insert of pPac747Sp4 by a 1.6-kb BamHI fragment of pPacSp1 leading to pPacSp1ΔZnD. The plasmid for the expression of the DNA binding domain of Sp3 (pPacSp3DBD) was generated by replacing the NdeI-XbaI insert of an expression plasmid for dTAFII110 (pPacG4-110, kindly provided by R. Tjian) with a 0.8-kb NdeI-XbaI fragment obtained from pET-3c/A3O(4Hagen G. Müller S. Beato G. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar).Cell Culture, Transfections, and CAT AssaysIshikawa cells were cultured in minimum essential medium Eagle as described previously(14Slater E.P. Redeuihl G. Theis K. Suske G. Beato M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 604-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). They were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method(15Cato A.C.B. Miksicek R. Schütz G. Arnemann J. Beato M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2237-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Every plate (9 cm) received 2 μg of G5E1bSV reporter, 2 μg of Gal4-Sp expression plasmid, and 1 μg of RSVLuc. Transfected cells were harvested for CAT assays 72 h after transfection. Variations in transfection efficiencies were corrected by determining the luciferase activities(16Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, Chichester, West Sussex, England1987: 9.7.12-9.7.14Google Scholar).SL2 cells (17Schneider I. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1972; 27: 353-365PubMed Google Scholar) were maintained in Schneider medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 25°C. 1 day prior to transfection, cells were plated onto 6-cm plastic dishes at a density of 4.3 × 106 cells per plate. Cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method described by DiNocera and Dawid(18DiNocera P.P. Dawid I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7095-7098Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Every plate received up to 14 μg of DNA including 4 μg of the β-galactosidase expression plasmid p97b as internal reference. Variable amounts of expression plasmids were compensated with the plasmid pPac. 24 h after addition of DNA, the medium was changed, and 24 h later the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested.For CAT assays, cells were suspended in 250 mM Tris/Cl, pH 7.8, and lysed by three rounds of freezing and thawing. CAT assays were carried out according to Gorman et al.(19Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5288) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations in the CAT assays and reaction times were adjusted to bring the extent of CAT conversion into a range that is linear with the CAT enzyme concentration. CAT conversion was assayed by thin layer chromatography, and quantitation of acetylated and non-acetylated forms of [14C]chloramphenicol was performed with an automated Imaging Scanner (United Technologies Packard). The ratio of acetylated to total chloramphenicol was displayed as percentage of conversion. The β-galactosidase assays were performed according to Hall et al.(20Hall C.V. Jacob P.E. Ringold G.M. Lee F. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1983; 2: 101-109PubMed Google Scholar). The values were used to normalize the CAT conversion data for plate to plate variations in transfection efficiency.Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift AssaysNuclear extracts from transfected Ishikawa and SL2 cells were prepared from one 10-cm plate according to Andrews and Faller(21Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar). Gel retardation assays were essentially performed as described (22Fried A. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar, 23Garner M.M. Revzin A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 395-396Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (52) Google Scholar) with oligonucleotides containing the Gal4 (24Carey M. Kakidani H. Leathermood J. Mostashari F. Ptashne M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 209: 423-432Google Scholar) or the GT box (4Hagen G. Müller S. Beato G. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar) binding site, respectively.The sequences of the oligonucleotides were as follows: GT box binding site, 5′-AGCTTCCGTTGGGGTGTGGCTTCACGTCGA-3′ and 3′-TCGAAGGCAACCCCACACCGAAGTGCAGCT-5′; Gal4 binding site, 5′-GCTTAGCGGAGTACTGTCCTCCGATCCC-3′ and 3′-CGAATCGCCTCATGACAGGAGGCTAGGG-3′; unspecific oligonucleotide, 5′-CAGCGACTAACATCGATCGC-3′ and 3′-GTCGCTGATTGTAGCTAGCG-5′.RESULTSSp4 Is a Transcriptional Activator in SL2 CellsTo assess the activation properties of Sp4 under defined conditions, we performed cotransfection experiments into Drosophila Schneider cells (SL2 cells). SL2 cells are particularly suited to this task because they lack endogenous Sp-like activities(6Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). We constructed a Drosophila expression vector for Sp4 (pPacSp4) by fusing the appropriate Sp4 cDNA fragment to the Drosophila actin 5C promoter. First, we examined whether the level of expression of Sp4 is similar to Sp1 following transfection. For this, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift analyses with an oligonucleotide containing the 10-base pair GT motif as DNA probe(25Dennig J. Hagen G. Beato M. Suske G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12737-12744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Specific complexes were generated with SL2 lysates containing Sp1 and Sp4. However, the complex obtained with Sp4 was much weaker (Fig. 1), indicating that Sp4 is expressed only moderately in transfected SL2 cells. In contrast, equal amounts of Sp1 and Sp3 expression plasmids gave roughly equivalent shifts ((8Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) and data not shown). A similar low expression of Sp4 was observed also when we provided a different translational start site by fusing the 773 or 747 C-terminal amino acids, respectively, of Sp4 to the Ubx leader sequence of pPacUbx(6Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the low expression of Sp4 does not reflect a weak translational start point of the Sp4 mRNA but is an intrinsic property of the Sp4 protein sequence itself. It should be noted that rat Sp1 (26Imataka H. Sogawa K. Yasumoto K.-I. Kikuchi Y. Sasano K. Kobayashi A. Hayami M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3663-3671Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) is also expressed weakly in SL2 cells (data not shown), although the cDNA differs from human Sp1 only in 31 out of 788 residues. Our band shift assays thus show that different amounts of expression plasmids for Sp1 and Sp4 are required to ensure equal amounts of intact protein in the cell.To test the putative transcriptional activity of Sp4 in direct comparison with Sp1, we cotransfected expression vectors for Sp4 and Sp1 together with BCAT-1 as test promoter construct (see Fig. 2A). BCAT-1 contains a single Sp1 binding site from the HIV promoter fused to the E1b TATA box and the CAT gene. This plasmid has been used to characterize activation domains of Sp1 in SL2 cells(7Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). A constant amount of the reporter plasmid BCAT-1 was transfected into Schneider cells along with 4 μg of the Sp4 expression plasmid or various amounts of Sp1 expression plasmid. Under these conditions, Sp4 activated the test promoter 5-6-fold. Essentially the same degree of activation was obtained with 20 ng of the Sp1 expression plasmid (Fig. 2A). Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis experiments with nuclear extracts prepared from these two plates revealed that equal amounts of Sp1 and Sp4 protein engender roughly equal activation of BCAT-1 (Fig. 2B). Thus, it appears that Sp4 can mediate transcriptional activation of BCAT-1 in SL2 cells to the same extent as Sp1.Figure 2Activation properties of Sp4 in SL2 cells in comparison to Sp1. A, 8 μg of the reporter plasmids BCAT-1 or BCAT-2, respectively, were transfected into SL2 cells along with variable amounts of pPacSp1 (2, 10, 20, 100, and 200 ng) or 4 μg of pPacSp4 as indicated. The cells were subsequently lysed, and CAT activities were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, gel retardation assays with crude nuclear extracts from SL2 cells transfected with 20 ng of pPacSp1 (lanes 2-4), 4 μg of pPacSp4 (lanes 5-7), or 4 μg of vector (pPac) (lane 1). All reactions contained 0.1 ng of labeled GT oligonucleotide. In lanes 2 and 7, a 20-fold molar excess of unlabeled GT oligonucleotide (S) and in lanes 3 and 6, a 20-fold molar excess of a nonspecific oligonucleotide (U) was included in the binding reaction. Arrows indicate the free oligonucleotide and specifically retarded protein-DNA complexes, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Sp4 Does Not Activate SynergisticallyIn vivo transient cotransfection assays in SL2 cells with Sp1 showed that templates bearing multiple Sp1 binding sites activate transcription with a high degree of synergism(7Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). To test the potential of Sp4 to activate transcription synergistically, we used BCAT-2 as test promoter construct. This construct contains two high affinity Sp binding sites placed upstream of the E1b TATA box. Consistent with published results(7Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 8Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), Sp1 activation of the BCAT-2 promoter construct containing two Sp binding sites was up to 50-fold stronger compared with the activation of the promoter construct containing only one Sp binding site. However, Sp4 activated BCAT-2 only 2-fold better than BCAT-1 (Fig. 2A). This result demonstrates that in contrast to Sp1, Sp4 is not able to activate transcription synergistically from two adjacent binding sites.The Glutamine-rich Domains of Sp4 Mediate Transcriptional Activation in Mammalian CellsNext, we asked whether the N-terminal region of Sp4 containing two glutamine-rich domains could act as transactivation domain in mammalian cells. To investigate this, we fused it to the DNA binding domain of the yeast transcription factor Gal4 and performed transfection experiments into the mammalian cell line Ishikawa. For direct comparison, analogous Sp1-Gal4 and Sp3-Gal4 fusion constructs were generated (Fig. 3A). Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis experiments with a Gal4 DNA binding site as probe showed that the Gal4-Sp1, Gal4-Sp3, and Gal4-Sp4 fusion proteins are expressed at comparable levels (Fig. 3B).Figure 3Activation properties of Gal4-Sp fusion proteins in the mammalian cell line Ishikawa. A, schematic representation of the expression constructs Gal4, Gal4-Sp1, Gal4-Sp3, and Gal4-Sp4. The hatched boxes indicate the glutamine-rich domains designated A and B. B, transient expression of Gal4-Sp fusion proteins in Ishikawa cells. Gel retardation assays were performed with crude nuclear extracts from Ishikawa cells transfected with 8 μg of expression plasmids for Gal4-Sp1 (lanes 2-4), Gal4-Sp3 (lane 5), Gal4-Sp4 (lane 6), or mock DNA (pUC8 plasmid) (lane 1). All reactions contained 0.2 ng of labeled Gal4 oligonucleotide and 2.4 μg of protein extract. In lanes 3 and 4, a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled Gal4 oligonucleotide (S) or nonspecific oligonucleotide (U) was included in the binding reaction. C, transactivation of G5E1bSV. Ishikawa cells were transfected with 2 μg of G5E1bSV along with 2 μg of expression plasmids for Gal4, Gal4-Sp1, Gal4-Sp3, or Gal4-Sp4 as indicated. The cells were subsequently lysed and assayed for CAT activities. The CAT values are expressed relative to the CAT activity obtained with the Gal4 expression plasmid, which has been given the arbitrary value of 1. The mean value and the standard deviation of at least three transfections are displayed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next, we performed cotransfection experiments with G5E1bSV as reporter plasmid. G5E1bSV is a derivative of the plasmid G5E1b(12Lillie J.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). It contains five Gal4 binding sites fused to the E1b TATA box, the CAT gene, and the SV40 enhancer. These experiments revealed that the N-terminal region of Sp4 can stimulate transcription efficiently in Ishikawa cells (Fig. 3C). Essentially the same degree of activation was obtained with the corresponding domains of Sp1 but not with those of Sp3. This result suggests that the glutamine-rich domains of Sp4 possess the potential for transcriptional activation like those present in Sp1. The corresponding N-terminal region of the Sp3 protein, however, appears to be inactive under these conditions.A DNA Binding-deficient Form of Sp1 Can Functionally Interact with Sp4Previously, it has been shown that the transcriptional activity of Sp1 molecules tethered to DNA via their DNA binding domains can be enhanced by a DNA binding-deficient deletion mutant of Sp1(7Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 27Courey A.J. Holtzman D.A. Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 59: 827-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). This process has been designated superactivation. Mechanistically, superactivation has been considered to be dependent on direct protein-protein interactions between fingerless Sp1 and the DNA binding form of Sp1. This interaction increases the number of activation domains at the promoter and thus enhances expression of a gene regulated by Sp1 binding sites.To test further the functional relationship between Sp1 and Sp4, we asked whether Sp4 could function as a target for the Sp1 activation domains in a superactivation assay. We performed a series of gene transfer experiments into SL2 cells with the Sp4 and Sp1 expression constructs in the absence and presence of an expression construct for an Sp1 deletion mutant lacking the DNA binding domain. As reporter constructs, we used again BCAT-1 and BCAT-2. The results of these experiments are summarized in Fig. 4. Consistent with previous results obtained with the SV40 early promoter, which contains six Sp1 binding sites(7Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 27Courey A.J. Holtzman D.A. Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 59: 827-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), fingerless Sp1 enhanced Sp1-mediated activation of BCAT-2 (two Sp1 binding sites) up to 10-fold (Fig. 4B). Surprisingly, fingerless Sp1 was not able to enhance Sp1-mediated transcriptional activation from a promoter that contains only one Sp binding site (Fig. 4C). Essentially the same extent of superactivation by fingerless Sp1 on BCAT-2 as reporter construct was achieved with Sp4 as activator (Fig. 4D). This result demonstrates that the N-terminal part of Sp1 can interact functionally not only with Sp1 but also with Sp4. Very likely, the functional interaction between fingerless Sp1 and Sp4 reflects specific protein-protein interactions involving some portions of the Sp1 and Sp4 molecules closely linked to their activation domains (see “Discussion”).Figure 4Superactivation of the transcription factor Sp4 by a DNA binding-deficient mutant of Sp1.

The hatched boxes and the black bars indicate the glutamine-rich domains and the zinc fingers, respectively.

D, 8 μg of BCAT-2 were transfected with different amounts of pPacSp4 (20, 200, and 2000 ng) in the absence (○) and presence (▲) of 1 μg of an expression plasmid for a fingerless Sp1 mutant (Sp1ΔZnD). E, schematic representation of the model for the superactivation of Sp1 and Sp4 by a fingerless mutant of Sp1. At least two binding sites for Sp1 are necessary for the enhancement of the Sp1 activity by the superactivator Sp1ΔZnD.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Transcriptional Activation by Sp4 Is Repressed by Sp3Recently, we have shown that Sp1-mediated transcriptional activation is repressed by Sp3(8Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Consequently, we asked whether Sp4-mediated activation can also be repressed by Sp3. To address this question, we cotransfected a constant amount of the Sp4 expression construct pPacSp4 and the reporter construct BCAT-2 with increasing amounts of pPacSp3 in SL2 cells. Activation of BCAT-2 by Sp4 was repressed by Sp3 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5). The presence of the DNA binding domain of Sp3 seems to be a prerequisite for the inhibition of Sp4-mediated activation. A C-terminal mutant of Sp3 (Sp3ΔZnD), which lacks the DNA binding domain, did not influence Sp4-mediated transactivation (Fig. 5). However, essentially the same degree of repression by intact Sp3 was obtained when the DNA binding domain of Sp3 alone (Sp3DBD) was cotransfected along with Sp4. Thus, most likely the inhibitory effect of Sp3 is due to the competition of both proteins for their common DNA binding sites and does not reflect protein-protein interactions.Figure 5Sp4-mediated transcriptional activation is repressed by Sp3. 8 μg of BCAT-2 were transfected along with 4 μg of pPacSp4 (+) and increasing amounts of pPacSp3 (+, 20 ng; ++, 200 ng; and +++, 2000 ng), pPacSp3ΔZnD (++, 200 ng; and +++, 2000 ng) or pPacSp3DBD (++, 200 ng; and +++, 2000 ng) as indicated. The structure of the Sp4, Sp3, Sp3ΔZnD, and Sp3DBD proteins is illustrated schematically. The cells were subsequently lysed and assayed for CAT activities.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONSp4 Is a Transcriptional ActivatorA first indication that Sp4 acts as a transcriptional activator similar as Sp1 came from cotransfection experiments into mammalian cell lines using an expression construct for Sp4 under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter(8Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). However, a severe limitation of these experiments constitutes the fact that the transfection efficiency and expression levels of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 proteins cannot be entirely controlled due to the constitutively high expression of Sp1 and Sp3 in mammalian cell lines(8Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Transfections into Drosophila cells, which do not contain Sp1-like proteins, permit to monitor the above parameters properly. In these insect cells, Sp4 activated different Sp1-responsive reporter constructs, establishing it as a transcriptional stimulator like Sp1.Under conditions where equal amounts of Sp4 and Sp1 protein were detectable in SL2 nuclear extracts, the extent of activation of a reporter construct containing a single Sp binding site was similar. However, significant differences became apparent with a reporter construct containing two binding sites. In contrast to Sp1, Sp4 was not able to activate this construct synergistically. What might be the molecular basis for this observation? Since DNA binding studies failed to detect any evidence of Sp1 binding cooperatively to two adjacent sites(7Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), 2G. Hagen, J. Dennig, A. Preiß, M. Beato, and G. Suske, unpublished data. DNA binding is not the key to explain these differences between Sp1 and Sp4.Probably, the synergistic effect of Sp1 occurs at steps following DNA binding by generating more effective activation surfaces(7Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The regions of the Sp1 molecule, which are necessary for synergistic activation, have been mapped extensively(7Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Three domains, the glutamine-rich activation domains A and B and the most C-terminal region of Sp1 (domain D), are essential for the ability of Sp1 to activate transcription synergistically from two adjacent sites. Thus, differences in either of these domains may account for the failure of Sp4 to activate transcription synergistically. Sequence comparison of the D-domain of Sp1 with the corresponding domain of Sp4 revealed no significant homologies within this region. The absence of a functionally active domain D in Sp4 may thus account for the lack of synergistic activation. This interpretation is supported by our gene transfer experiments into mammalian cells using Gal4-Sp expression vectors. These constructs do not contain the most C-terminal domain of Sp1 (domain D). Consistently, the N-terminal region of Sp4 containing two glutamine-rich domains exhibits activation properties similar to the N-terminal region of the Sp1 molecule lacking the D domain.Superactivation of Sp4 by a Non-DNA Binding Form of Sp1Previous experiments have shown that a non-DNA binding mutant of Sp1 enhances activation by Sp1(7Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 27Courey A.J. Holtzman D.A. Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 59: 827-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). This process, called superactivation, involves direct Sp1-Sp1 interaction. It has been assumed that superactivation may be akin to the process of simple activation by Sp1. Heteromeric complexes consisting of a DNA-bound Sp1 molecule and DNA binding-deficient Sp1 molecules may increase the number of activation domains at the promoter. However, our results show that fingerless Sp1 is not able to enhance Sp1-mediated transcriptional activation from a promoter that contains only one Sp binding site. Thus, superactivation should be defined more correctly as the enhancement of the activity of Sp1 mediated through at least two binding sites. Since the presence of both glutamine-rich regions of Sp1 is required for it to act as superactivator(7Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), both observations together suggest that each glutamine-rich domain of the superactivator molecule interacts with a different DNA-bound Sp1 molecule (Fig. 4E).The similarity of the glutamine-rich domains of Sp1 with those of Sp4 prompted us to consider a possible functional relationship between Sp1 and Sp4. We found that the N terminus of Sp1 is indeed able to superactivate Sp4-mediated transcriptional activation, suggesting that the non-DNA binding form of Sp1 directly interacts with Sp4. The implication of this finding is that the glutamine-rich domains of Sp4 and those of Sp1 are functionally related to each other. It should be noted that superactivation does not appear to be a general phenomenon of glutamine-rich activation domains but rather a factor-specific property. For instance, the Drosophila antennapedia and bicoid transcription factors cannot be superactivated by Sp1(27Courey A.J. Holtzman D.A. Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 59: 827-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 28Hoey T. Weinzierl R.O.J. Gill G. Chen J.-L. Dynlacht B.D. Tjian R. Cell. 1993; 72: 247-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), suggesting that the glutamine-rich domains of these factors are functionally unrelated to those of Sp1 and Sp4.The only protein besides Sp4 that has been shown to function as a target for Sp1 activation domains in a superactivation assay is the Drosophila TATA-box binding protein associated factor 110 (dTAFII110)(28Hoey T. Weinzierl R.O.J. Gill G. Chen J.-L. Dynlacht B.D. Tjian R. Cell. 1993; 72: 247-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Since Sp1 binds and requires dTAFII110 for activation in vitro(29Chen J.L. Attardi L.D. Verrijzer C.P. Yokomori K. Tjian R. Cell. 1994; 79: 93-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that dTAFII110 may function as a coactivator by serving as a site of protein-protein contacts between Sp1 and the TFIID complex.Recently, one of the two glutamine-rich domains of Sp1 (region B) has been mapped in more detail(30Gill G. Pascal E. Tseng Z.H. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Certain bulky hydrophobic residues rather than the glutamine residues within this region are responsible for dTAFII110 interaction and transcriptional activation. Close inspection of the homologous region of Sp4 revealed a very similar glutamine-rich hydrophobic patch in Sp4 (Fig. 6), suggesting that the homologous glutamine-rich domains of Sp1 and Sp4 share functional equivalence. So far, we were not able to demonstrate a functional interaction between Sp4 and dTAFII110 in a superactivation assay. However, this negative result may be due to the low expression level of the Sp4 constructs in SL2 cells. Other experimental approaches, for instance a two-hybrid assay in yeast, could help to clarify this point.Figure 6Comparison of glutamine-rich regions present in Sp1 and Sp4. The Sp1 activation domain B (amino acids 450-473) has been shown to interact with dTAFII110(30Gill G. Pascal E. Tseng Z.H. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Residues in Sp1B that are sensitive to mutations are indicated by asterisks. The glutamine-rich domains of Sp1B (amino acids 450-473), Sp4B (amino acids 462-486), Sp1A (amino acids 165-188), and Sp4A (amino acids 164-187) share a similar array of glutamine residues and large hydrophobic residues (circled).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)What Might Be the Specific Function of Sp4 in Vivo?Sp4 transcripts are present in many cell lines. However, in vivo, Sp4 expression is restricted to certain cell types of the brain(4Hagen G. Müller S. Beato G. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar).2 Thus, Sp4 could have a crucial role for the expression of certain genes in these cells. Since natural promoters usually also contain binding sites for other transcription factors, one might speculate that stimulation of transcription by Sp4 may be dependent of the promoter context. This raises the intriguing possibility that Sp4 functions in a promoter-specific manner by interacting with other transcription factors. However, any natural target gene of Sp4 remains to be identified. Currently, we are isolating the gene of the mouse homologue of Sp4 to generate Sp4 knock-out mice. The disruption of the Sp4 gene might help to identify the natural target genes of Sp4 in vivo. INTRODUCTIONThe properly timed and coordinated expression of eukaryotic genes requires the combinatorial action of multiple sequence-specific DNA binding proteins. These transcription factors recognize distinct promoter and enhancer elements, thereby acting positively or negatively on transcription. One of the first and best characterized mammalian transcription factors was Sp1 (1Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar, 2Kadonaga J.T. Courey A.J. Ladika J. Tjian R. Science. 1988; 242: 1566-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) which binds to GC boxes and related motifs (3Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 20-23Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (875) Google Scholar) present in many promoters. However, Sp1 is not the only protein binding to and acting through these DNA motifs. At least two other more recently cloned human proteins, designated Sp3 and Sp4, do bind with identical affinity to the same recognition sequence as Sp1 (4Hagen G. Müller S. Beato G. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Note that Sp2, yet another factor homologous to Sp1, seems to have DNA binding specificities different from Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4(5Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar).Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 represent a family of GC box binding proteins with very similar structural features. In addition to the highly conserved DNA binding domain close to the C terminus, all three proteins contain two glutamine- and serine/threonine-rich amino acid stretches in the N-terminal part of the molecule. For Sp1, the glutamine-rich domains have been identified as transactivation domains(2Kadonaga J.T. Courey A.J. Ladika J. Tjian R. Science. 1988; 242: 1566-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 6Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). Two additional domains of Sp1 (C and D) located adjacent to the zinc finger region also influence the transcriptional activation function, one being weakly basic (C) and the other (D) showing no significant homology to known activation domains(6Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). The D domain of Sp1 plays a key role in mediating the ability of Sp1 to activate transcription synergistically (7Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar).The high degree of structural conservation between Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 suggested that Sp3 and Sp4 do exert similar activation functions. A functional analysis of Sp3 using transfection experiments into mammalian cell lines and into Drosophila SL2 cells lacking endogenous Sp factors demonstrated, however, that Sp3 is not simply a functional equivalent of Sp1. Sp3 failed to activate Sp1-responsive promoter constructs. Instead, it repressed Sp1-mediated transcriptional activation(8Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 9Majello B. De Luca P. Hagen G. Suske G. Lania L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 10Majello B. De Luca P. Suske G. Lania L. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1841-1848PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that Sp3 is an inhibitory member of the Sp family. The intriguing finding that Sp1 and Sp3 can exert opposite transcriptional regulation prompted us to analyze thoroughly the transcriptional properties of the Sp4 protein.We have performed cotransfection experiments into mammalian cells and into insect cells that lack endogenous Sp factors. Our studies demonstrate that Sp4 is an activator protein like Sp1. However, in contrast to Sp1, Sp4 is not able to act synergistically through adjacent binding sites. Moreover, Sp4-mediated activation is strongly enhanced (superactivated) in the presence of a non-DNA binding mutant of Sp1, suggesting that Sp1 can interact directly with Sp4. We show further that Sp4-mediated transcriptional activation is repressed by Sp3. Our results thus demonstrate that Sp4 exhibits a unique spectrum of functional properties distinct from those found for Sp1 and Sp3."

INTRODUCTIONPotassium channels have an essential role in repolarization phases of action potentials and in the fine regulation of the resting potential. Molecular cloning has recently led to the identification of a large number (over 15) of genes for voltage-sensitive, non inward-rectifier, K+ (Kv) channels (1Pongs O. Physiol.

Sephadex G-25, Sephadex G-50, SP Sephadex C-25 were obtained from Pharmacia, Fractogel TSK HW-50 (F), Fractogel EMD SO3-650 (M), and RP18 Lichrocart were from Merck. For HPLC columns, TSK SP 5PW was from Toyosoda. Ultrasphere ODS was from Beckman, Hypersil BDS was from SFCC Shandon, and Alltima was from Alltech. HPLC purifications were performed with a Waters system.Purification of Anemonia Sulcata PeptidesThe first steps of this purification were performed with slight modifications of a method previously described for the isolation of Na+ channel toxins of A. sulcata(39Wachter E. Klostermann G. Binder A. Béress L. Ovchinnikov Y.A. Hucho F. Receptors and Ion Channels. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin1987: 313-322Google Scholar). In this procedure 12 g of the crude sea anemone toxin ((39Wachter E. Klostermann G. Binder A. Béress L. Ovchinnikov Y.A. Hucho F. Receptors and Ion Channels. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin1987: 313-322Google Scholar); Fig. 2B1) was dissolved in 120 ml of NaCl 1 M and regelfiltered in two parts on a Sephadex G-50 medium column (7 × 140 cm) equilibrated in 1 M NaCl. The crab paralyzing fractions of these gel filtrations were combined, dialyzed in a Visking Dialysis tube (molecular weight cutoff 12,000-14,000) for 5 h, concentrated at reduced pressure, and desalted on a Sephadex G-25 column (7 × 70 cm) equilibrated with 0.3 M acetic acid. After a concentration at reduced pressure and lyophilization, this crude sea anemone toxins fraction (6 g) was separated into its main components by ion-exchange chromatography on a SP-Sephadex C-25 column (2.5 × 140 cm) as described in Fig. 1A. Fractions which were potentially active on K+ channels (30, 34, and 38) are shaded. These fractions were identified by their capacity to inhibit binding of the 125I derivative of dendrotoxin I (125I-DTXI) one of the most potent blocker of Kv channels. The identified fractions contain peptides designated as AsKS, AsKC1, and AsKC2. They were concentrated and desalted on Sephadex G-25 (not shown) in 0.3 M acetic acid and lyophilized. The last purification steps for each peptide were carried out by HPLC as described below.Figure 1A, purification on SP Sephadex C-25 of 6 g of crude sea anemone toxic material obtained from A. sulcata as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The column (2.5 × 140 cm) was equilibrated with 0.01 M ammonium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, the crude toxic fraction was loaded and eluted in this buffer, followed by a stepwise gradient as indicated in the figure.

The peptides were first absorbed in 2% acetonitrile and then eluted with 50% acetonitrile and lyophilized.Purification of Anemonia Sulcata Kaliseptine (AsKS)Fraction 30 from Fig. 1A (100 mg) was further purified by ion-exchange chromatography in equilibrium conditions on a Fractogel SO3 EMD 650 (1 × 40 cm) column with 0.5 M ammonium acetate at pH 4.5 as eluting buffer. The eluted material appeared in three peaks, the first one was desalted on Sephadex G-25 and lyophilized. A 11.3-mg fraction of it was loaded in an Ultrasphere ODS (10 × 250 mm) 5 μm column and eluted at 3 ml/min with a linear gradient from 15 to 40% D in 60 min. Activity was found in the first important peak eluting at 17% D between 5.0 and 6.0 mn. This peak was lyophilized and loaded on the same column. A linear gradient from 5 to 20% D in 60 min was applied at the same flow rate of 3 ml/min. AsKS eluted at 14% D, between 34 and 36 min as shown in Fig. 1B (recovery, 1.45 mg).Purification of Anemonia Sulcata Kalicludine 1 (AsKC1)Fraction 34 from Fig. 1A was further purified by gel filtration on fractogel TSK HW50 in 0.9 M NaCl with 0.1 M ammonium acetate, pH 5.5, as eluting solvent. Three peaks were observed in the eluted material. The first one was desalted on Sephadex G-25 and lyophilized. Then the following step was performed as for AsKS: 12.7 mg of the product being chromatographed on the Ultrasphere ODS column. Activity was found in the main peak eluting at 23% D between 16 and 19 min. This fraction was lyophilized and chromatographed on the TSK SP 5PW column. Activity was found in the main peak eluting at 59% B between 28 and 34 min. After lyophilization this fraction was chromatographed on a Hypersil BDS column (4.6 × 250 mm), C18, 5 μm, but with a concave gradient (curve 8) between 15% and 20% D in 30 min. AsKC1 eluted as shown in Fig. 1C at 20% D, between 30.5 and 35.5 min (recovery, 1.13 mg).Purification of Anemonia Sulcata Kalicludine 2 (AsKC2)Fraction 38 from Fig. 1A was first purified, like AsKC1, on Fractogel. Here also the first of the three peaks was kept. The following step was performed as for AsKS with 7.9 mg of the product being chromatographed on the Ultrasphere ODS column. Activity was found in the main peak eluting at 23.5% D between 17 and 20.5 min. This fraction was lyophilized and chromatographed on the TSK SP 5PW column. Activity was found in the main peak eluting at 85% B between 38 and 45 min. After lyophilization, this fraction was chromatographed on the Hypersil BDS column under the same conditions as for the last purification step of AsKC1. AsKC2 eluted as shown in Fig. 1D at 20% D between 31 and 37.5 min. (recovery, 0.78 mg).Purification of Anemonia Sulcata Kalicludine 3 (AsKC3)The starting material used in this purification is the last eluted and most basic fraction (chromatography on SP-Sephadex C25 with 40 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6, and a NaCl gradient between 80 and 380 mM) in the previously described isolation of Na+ channel toxins from A. sulcata(40Schweitz H.

A part of this fraction (9.8 mg) was chromatographed on the TSK SP 5PW column. Activity was found in the main fraction eluting at 57% B, between 27 and 34 min. The corresponding material was lyophilized, redissolved in 2 ml of water, and chromatographed by fractions of 500 μl on an Alltima C18, 5 μm, metal-free (4.6 × 250 mm) column. Elution was performed at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a linear gradient from 15 to 40% D in 30 min as shown in Fig. 1E. AsKC3 eluted at 28.5% D, between 16 and 16.8 min as shown by the arrow (recovery, 0.18 mg). The elution profile of AsKC3 is given in Fig. 1F.Primary Structure of the PeptidesPeptide structures (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3) were determined by Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems model 477A microsequencer. Before sequencing, S-pyridyl ethylation of cysteine residues was performed according to Tarr et al.(41Tarr G.E. Black S.D. Fujita V.S. Coon M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6552-6556Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal sequence was completed for AsKC1, AsKC2, and AsKC3 by sequence determination of the peptides obtained by endoproteinase Glu-C cleavage. Samples of 0.2 nmol of S-pyridylated peptides were digested in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8, at 37°C for 24 h with 1 pmol of endoproteinase Glu-C (Promega). The reaction mixture was evaporated by speed-vac centrifugation and redissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. All peptide hydrolysates were then fractionated onto a C18 reverse phase column (220 × 2.1 mm Brownlee™ columns) by using an Applied Biosystems model 140 A apparatus. Initial chromatographic conditions were 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water with a flow rate of 100 μl/min at room temperature, and elution was performed by increasing the acetonitrile concentration to 70% with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and using a linear gradient of 0.5%/min. Definitive confirmation of the structures was obtained by mass spectrometry analysis using a laser desorption technique (Finnigan laser mat). It gave the following values for the molecular weights, very close to values obtained from the sequences, in parentheses: AsKS, 3834(3835); AsKC1, 6685(6690); AsKC2, 6772(6781); and AsKC3, 6732(6738).Figure 3Sequence homologies of AsKS with the sea anemone B. granulifera (BgK) toxin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Binding to MembranesIodination of DTXI from Dendroaspis polylepis at a specific radioactivity of 2000 Ci/mmol and binding of 125I-DTXI to rat brain P3 membranes were performed as described previously(27Bidard J.-N.

The standard saline solution ND96 containing 96 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, and 5 mM HEPES adjusted at pH 7.4 was used in all procedures.Assay of Trypsin ActivityThe enzymatic activity of trypsin and its inhibition by the Kunitz-type inhibitor BPTI and by A. sulcata peptides were measured spectrophotometrically. Aliquots of trypsin at the final concentration of about 3 μM were incubated for 3 h at 25°C in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, plus 5 mM CaCl2 in the presence of various concentrations of the peptides in a final volume of 45 μl. After incubation, the free remaining trypsin was determined by addition of 5 μl of 5 mM BAPNA in anhydrous ethanol. Kinetics of paranitroaniline release were measured at 405 nm.Molecular ModelingMolecular modeling was done using the ensemble of modeling programs from Biosym Technologies. For DTXI and BPTI, respectively, we used coordinates 1DEM (43Lancelin J.-M. Foray M.-F. Poncin M. Hollecker M. Marion D. Nature Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and 4PTI (44Wlodawer A. Deisenhofer J. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) taken from the Protein Data Bank(45Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F. Williams G.J.B. Meyer E.F. Brice M.D. Rodgers J.R. Kennard T. Shimanouchi O. Tasumi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 112: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (8152) Google Scholar). The peptide sequence of AsKC2 was assigned to the coordinates of dendrotoxin without changes in the protein conformation. Non-bonded atomic contacts induced were then analyzed and manually removed by rotation around the side chain carbons-carbons bonds. No energy minimization was further applied.RESULTSWe have purified from the sea anemone A. sulcata four peptides for their ability to prevent 125I-DTXI binding to its receptors in rat brain. Since DTXI is a well-known blocker of K+ channels and since these A. sulcata peptides not only inhibit 125I-DTXI binding but also inhibit K+ channel activity it has been decided to designate them under the name of A. sulcata kaliseptine and kalicludines (AsKS and AsKC). Fig. 2 and 3 present the sequences of the four peptides. Three of them have sequence similarities with DTXI and the basic bovine trypsin inhibitor (Kunitz inhibitor, BPTI) which is a well-known homolog of DTXI(17Harvey A.L. Anderson A.J. Harvey A.L. Snake Toxins. Pergamon Press, Inc., New York1991: 131-164Google Scholar). These toxins were named A. sulcata kalicludines (AsKC1, AsKC2, and AsKC3) because they also have structural homologies with calcicludine (CaC) (32-35%), another homolog of the Kunitz inhibitor and of DTXI(43Lancelin J.-M. Foray M.-F. Poncin M. Hollecker M. Marion D. Nature Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 46Schweitz H. Heurteaux C. Bois P. Moinier D. Romey G. Lazdunski M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 878-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) which is a blocker of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels. The last purified peptide (Fig. 3) is not homologous to DTXI. It was named A. sulcata kaliseptine (AsKS).Fig. 4 shows the concentration dependence of the inhibition of 125I-DTXI binding by the different sea anemone toxins. Values of IC50 are 27 nM for AsKS, 60 nM for AsKC2, 375 nM for AsKC1, and 500 nM for AsKC3. These values were 2-4 orders of magnitude higher than the IC50 for DTXI inhibition of 125I-DTXI binding which is 0.14 nM. Scatchard plots presented in Fig. 5 show that both kaliseptine (AsKS) and kalicludines (AsKC2) inhibit 125I-DTXI binding in a competitive way. Plots of the apparent values Kd(app)/Kdversus the toxins concentrations provide the true values of inhibition constants Ki which are 10 nM for AsKS and 20 nM for AsKC2 (Fig. 5, insets).

Under these experimental conditions, DTXI itself has an IC50 of 2.1 nM. Peptides which inhibit the Kv1.2 current with the best efficiency are also those which have the highest affinity for the DTXI receptors.Figure 6Inhibition of the K+ current in Xenopus oocytes expressing the Kv1.2 channels.

Trypsin at the concentration of about 3 μM was first incubated at room temperature for 3 h with different concentrations of the kalicludines to be sure to reach equilibrium. After incubation, the free trypsin was measured by its ability to release paranitroaniline from BAPNA. Fig. 7 shows that all three kalicludines inhibit trypsin. Inhibition profiles of trypsin by AsKC1, AsKC2, AsKC3, and BPTI are very similar. Total inhibition of trypsin was reached by addition of a stoichiometric amount (1:1) of the kalicludines. The profile of inhibition observed with AsKC1, AsKC2, and AsKC3 (which indicates a stoichiometric 1:1 inhibition) is encountered when the Kd for the interaction is below 1/100th of the concentration of trypsin in the incubation medium(47Vincent J.-P. Lazdunski M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 2967-2977Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), here 3 μM. Then, the Kd of interaction of these sea anemone peptides with trypsin has to be below 30 nM. Conversely, Fig. 7 also shows that a large excess of DTXI, another Kv channel inhibitior of similar structure, is unable to inhibit trypsin. This lack of trypsin inhibition was also observed for toxin K from D. polylepis another dendrotoxin toxin for K+ channels (17Harvey A.L. Anderson A.J. Harvey A.L. Snake Toxins. Pergamon Press, Inc., New York1991: 131-164Google Scholar) which is structurally more closely related to the Kunitz inhibitor than DTXI because it has a lysine in position 15 corresponding to the essential lysine 15 at the active site of the trypsin inhibitor (48Vincent J.-P. Schweitz H. Lazdunski M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 42: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) (the corresponding residue is a tyrosine in DTXI). Finally, Fig. 7 shows that A. sulcata kaliseptine AsKS which has no structural homology with BPTI does not inhibit trypsin even at a molecular excess of 7 to 1.Figure 7Concentration dependence of trypsin inhibition by different concentrations of BPTI, A. sulcata peptides, and dendrotoxins. •, AsKS; ▼, AsKC1; ▵, AsKC2; ○, AsKC3; ♦, DTXI; ▿, toxin K from D. polylepis.; ◊, BPTI.

The function of CTLA-4 during T cell activation is not well understood, although an important role is suggested by complete amino acid sequence conservation of its cytoplasmic tail in all species studied to date. We report here a role of the cytoplasmic tail of CTLA-4 in regulating its subcellular localization and cell surface expression. In activated human peripheral blood T cells, or in several transfected or transduced cell types, CTLA-4 is not primarily a cell surface protein, but rather is localized intracellularly in a region which overlaps the Golgi apparatus. Transfer of 11 cytoplasmic residues, 161TTGVYVKMPPT, from the CTLA-4 cytoplasmic tail to the homologous position in CD28 was sufficient to confer intracellular localization. Mutation of the tyrosine residue (Tyr165) in this motif to phenylalanine resulted in increased surface expression of CTLA-4. Thus, the subcellular localization of CTLA-4 is controlled by a tyrosine-containing motif within its cytoplasmic domain. Contained within this motif is a binding site for SH2 domains of the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.

Until recently, CPE was the only intracellular carboxypeptidase thought to be involved in neuroendocrine peptide processing. However, the finding that fat/fat mice, which have a mutation within the CPE gene that inactivates the enzyme, are capable of a reduced amount of insulin processing suggests that another carboxypeptidase is present within the secretory pathway. We have detected a CPE-like enzyme, designated CPD, which has many properties in common with those of CPE. Like CPE, CPD is a metallocarboxypeptidase that has a pH optimum of 5.5-6. The Km and Kcat values for a series of short peptide substrates show only minor differences between CPD and CPE. Several active site-directed inhibitors also show generally similar potency toward the two enzymes, although guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid is approximately 10-fold more potent, and hippuryl-Arg is approximately 100-fold more potent as an inhibitor of CPD than of CPE. A major difference between the two enzymes is the molecular masses; CPE is 50,000-56,000, whereas CPD is approximately 180,000. Also, CPD does not elute from a substrate affinity column when the pH is raised to 8, which elutes CPE, although CPD can subsequently be eluted by arginine. Both CPE and CPD are present in purified bovine anterior pituitary secretory vesicles, but the tissue distribution of CPD is more uniform than that of CPE. Antisera to the N- and C-terminal regions of CPE do not recognize CPD. The partial N-terminal amino acid sequence of bovine CPD shows 30-40% homology with an N-terminal region of bovine and rat CPE and 70% homology with a duck protein known as gp180, a hepatitis B virus particle binding protein that shows 47% homology to CPE.

Since increasing evidence indicates overlapping of growth factor- and UV-induced signal pathways, we studied the effect of UV light and other genotoxic agents on early rhoB transcription. Within 30 min after UV irradiation of NIH3T3 cells, the amount of rhoB mRNA increased 3-4-fold. Elevated rhoB mRNA was accompanied by an increase in RhoB protein, as detected by C3-mediated [32P]ADP-ribosylation. The transcription inhibitor actinomycin D prevented the UV-induced increase in rhoB mRNA and proved rhoB mRNA to be unstable with a half-life of ~20 min. Transcriptional activation of rhoB by UV light was confirmed by run-on analysis. The increase in rhoB mRNA after UV irradiation was prevented by inhibitors of protein kinase A (H9) and C (H7, Gö18). The tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein did not affect UV induction of rhoB. In addition to UV, N-methyl-N-nitrosourea and the cytostatic drug cisplatin evoked rhoB response.

Among these inducible functions, only the proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-jun are transcriptionally activated within minutes after induction of DNA damage. Therefore, these two genes, whose products act as trans-activators by forming the transcription factor AP-1(26Büscher M. Rahmsdorf H. Litfin M. Karin M. Herrlich P.

Recently it has been shown that rhoB is immediate-early inducible by growth factors and v-Fps(34Jähner D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3682-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the gene product of rhoB belongs to the family of Ras homologous small GTP-binding proteins. The Rho 1The abbreviations used are: RhoRas homologousBt2cAMPdibutyrylic cyclic AMPFCSfetal calf serumGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseMNUN-methyl-N-nitrosoureaTPA12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetatePBSphosphate-buffered salineFITCfluorescein isothiocyanate. protein family consists of at least three highly homologous members (RhoA, -B, and -C(35Chardin P.

In addition, RhoA has been reported to interfere with cell adhesion (45Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3832) Google Scholar) and transformation(46Avraham H. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2058-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Apparently, Rho proteins (RhoA, -B, and -C) have different intracellular locations (47Adamson P. Paterson H.F. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), indicating different physiological functions. Consistent with this is the observation that the expression of rhoB, but not of rhoA or rhoC is rapidly stimulated by growth factors(34Jähner D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3682-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Transcriptional stimulation of rhoB by mitogens appears to differ from other immediate-early genes, like c-fos(34Jähner D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3682-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), suggesting a novel pathway for mitogen-induced cellular responses. Interestingly, RhoB has recently been suggested to be involved in cell growth control and Ras-mediated oncogenic transformation(48Prendergast G.C. Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Kurzawa H. Lebowitz P.F. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2289-2296PubMed Google Scholar). Ras homologous dibutyrylic cyclic AMP fetal calf serum glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase N-methyl-N-nitrosourea 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate phosphate-buffered saline fluorescein isothiocyanate. So far, GTP-binding proteins have not been examined as regulators in early signaling after DNA damage, although they could rapidly control adaptive cellular reactions by GTP binding and GTP hydrolysis, thereby changing the activity of various downstream targets. Since the immediate-early genes c-fos and c-jun are not only inducible by mitogens but also by UV light, the question arose whether this would be true for rhoB too. Thus, the recently published data on rhoB regulation (34Jähner D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3682-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) prompted us to investigate whether rhoB is part of the early cellular response to DNA damage. Here we show that UV light and other DNA-damaging agents increase RhoB very rapidly by transcriptional activation of the gene, apparently utilizing a pathway not common for previously described early-responsive genes. N-Methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) and cisplatin were purchased from Sigma. Protein kinase inhibitors H7 and H9 were obtained from RBI (Research Biochemicals Inc.). Protein kinase inhibitor Gö18 was kindly provided by Dr. Schächtele (Gödecke, Freiburg, 47). The tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein was obtained from Sigma. Mouse NIH3T3 cells were routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated FCS, 2 mML-glutamate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For serum starvation, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and cultured in the presence of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% FCS for 24 h. Before UV treatment (254 nm), medium was removed. All other treatments were performed by adding the drug directly to the medium. After treatment of exponentially growing NIH3T3 cells, medium was removed and cell layer washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Subsequently, cells were lysed onto the plates with guanidinium thiocyanate and total RNA was prepared as described(49Chomzynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After separation on 1.2% agarose gels, RNA was transferred to Hybond N+ membranes overnight (transfer buffer: 50 mM NaOH). Prehybridization was performed in 0.5 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 7% SDS and 1 mM EDTA for 2 h. Hybridization was done overnight in the same solution additionally containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 32P-labeled probe (106 cpm/ml). Filters were washed 2 × 30 min in a solution containing decreasing salt concentrations (2 × SSC (1 × SSC) + 0.5% SDS + 1 mM EDTA). All steps were performed at 65°C. Rat rhoB-cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. T. Hunter (San Diego, CA), the human rhoA-cDNA by Dr. A. Hall (London, United Kingdom). For rhoB-specific hybridization we used a 0.95-kilobase EcoRI-XhoI fragment from the 3′-region of rhoB-cDNA (containing rhoB-specific coding and noncoding sequences). Amounts of total rho mRNAs were determined by hybridization with the whole coding sequence of rhoA cDNA, which cross-hybridizes to all rho mRNA species because of their high homology(36Yeramian P. Chardin P. Madaule P. Tavitian A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The c-fos and GAPDH cDNA hybridization probes were obtained from Dr. H. J. Rahmsdorf (Institute of Genetics, Research Center, Karlsruhe, Federal Republic of Germany). For quantitation of the data, densitometrical analysis was performed. Relative gene expression was calculated by referring rhoB (rho c-fos) mRNA to the amount of GAPDH mRNA and by relating to control cells included in each experiment. Run-on experiments were essentially performed as described(28Greenberg M.E. Ziff E.B. Nature. 1984; 311: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar). 5 μg of plasmid DNA containing rhoB-, c-fos-, c-jun-, and GAPDH-cDNA sequences were heat-denatured (10 min, 95°C) and blotted onto Hybond N+ filter using a slot-blot apparatus. Nuclei from UV-irradiated and non-irradiated NIH3T3 cells were incubated in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mM MgCl2, 300 mM KCl, 0.5 mM of each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, and 100 μCi of [α-32P]dUTP for 30 min at 30°C. Reactions were stopped by DNase I treatment (20 μg/ml, 5 min, 30°C) followed by proteinase K digestion (30 min, 42°C). After phenol/chloroform extraction, 32P-labeled RNA was precipitated by trichloroacetic acid and filtered on BA85 filters (Millipore). After elution from the filters, 32P-labeled RNA was ethanol-precipitated. Hybridization of the blots with [32P]RNA was performed as described (see “Northern Blot Analysis”). A 1.6-kilobase EcoRI fragment from rat rhoB cDNA (27Ghosh R. Amstad P. Cerutti O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6992-6999Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was cloned both in sense and antisense orientation into the eukaryotic expression vector pSVT7 (gift of Dr. U. Günthert, Freidrich-Mieseler Institute, Basel) and pMAMneo (Clontech), respectively. Transfection of NIH3T3 cells was performed with 20 μg of DNA of rhoB expression plasmid using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation technique(50Kaina B. van Zeeland A.A. Backendorf C. Thielmann H.W. van de Putte P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2024-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). 16 h after transfection, cells were fixed for FITC staining as described below. NIH3T3 cells were disrupted by sonication in ice-cold buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation (10 min, 600 × g, 4°C), supernatant was used for protein determination according to Bradford (51Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). ADP-ribosylation of cell lysates was performed with either Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme (Rho-specific [32P]ADP-ribosylation) or C. botulinum C2 exoenzyme ([32P]ADP-ribosylation of G-actin). 20-50 μg of protein from total extracts were incubated for 30 min at 37°C in buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM thymidine, 0.2 μM NAD, 0.5 μCi of [32P]NAD, and 0.1 μg of C3 (0.5 μg of C2). Reaction products were then analyzed by one-dimensional SDS-gel electrophoresis according to Laemmli (52Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) or by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis(53Harris E.L.V. Angal S. Harris E.L.V. Protein Purification Methods, A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1989: 29Google Scholar). [32P]ADP-ribosylated proteins were detected after exposure of dried gels on Kodak X-Omat films. Cells were fixed on dishes with 4% formaldehyde, 0.2% Triton X-100 in 0.1 M phosphate-buffer (pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with FITC-labeled phalloidin (0.5 μM in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently cells were washed three times with PBS and actin filaments were detected by fluorescence microscopy. To address the question, whether rhoB is inducible by genotoxic agents, NIH3T3 cells were exposed to UV light and rhoB mRNA levels were measured various times after irradiation. As shown in Fig. 1A, a 3-4-fold increase in the amount of rhoB mRNA was observed 30 min after UV treatment, as detected by hybridization with a rhoB-specific probe. This hybridization probe mainly consists of the 3′-noncoding region of rat rhoB cDNA and does not cross-hybridize to rhoA or rhoC mRNA. As expected, the amount of c-fos mRNA which was taken as internal standard, was also enhanced upon UV irradiation. Furthermore, rehybridization of the filter was performed with a hybridization probe covering the whole coding region of rhoA. Because of the high homology (>85%) of the diverse Rho species(36Yeramian P. Chardin P. Madaule P. Tavitian A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), this hybridization probe cross-hybridizes with all rho mRNAs (rhoA -B and -C). Using this probe, no UV-induced change in total rho mRNA was observed, indicating that rhoB mRNA most likely represents only a minor portion of total rho mRNA (rhoA -B and -C). In contrast to UV, TPA did not increase rhoB mRNA (Fig. 1A). Kinetic analysis of the UV response showed maximal amounts of rhoB mRNA 30 min after irradiation (Fig. 1B). 2 h after exposure to UV, rhoB mRNA returned to basal level again. Increase in rhoB mRNA was already observed with low doses (10 J/m2) of UV (Fig. 1C), exerting only slight toxic effects (90% cell survival). The level of rhoB mRNA was similarly increased after UV treatment of serum-starved or confluent cells, indicating that the UV response of rhoB did not depend on proliferation (not shown). Additionally, we analyzed constitutive and UV-induced rhoB expression on protein level using the specific ADP-ribosylation of Rho proteins by C. botulinum exoenzyme C3(37Aktories K. Weller U. Chhatwal G.S. FEBS Lett. 1987; 212: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 38Aktories K. Rösener S. Blaschke U. Chhatwal G.S. Eur. J.

Chem. 1988; 263: 17255-17257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Separation of [32P]ADP-ribosylated cell extracts by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that RhoA and RhoC are the major Rho proteins constitutively expressed in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2). In contrast, basal amounts of RhoB are very low. 1 h after UV treatment, the amount of ADP-ribosylated RhoB protein increased about 2-3-fold, as compared with either ADP-ribosylated RhoA (RhoC) or RhoA and RhoC proteins. As related to RhoA, the level of RhoC was not significantly (<1.5-fold) changed after UV treatment. However, in spite of its inducibility, the amount of RhoB remained significantly below RhoA and RhoC. Thus, the calculation of the relative amount of RhoB protein deduced from ADP-ribosylation experiments is in line with our data obtained from Northern blot analysis. 4 h after UV irradiation, the level of [32P]ADP-ribosylated RhoB protein decreased again (not shown).Figure 2Induction of RhoB protein after UV treatment of NIH3T3 cells. Logarithmically growing NIH3T3 cells were irradiated with 30 J/m2 and cells were harvested 1 h later. 50 μg of protein from total cell extracts was ADP-ribosylated by C3 and [32P]ADP-ribosylated proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Autoradiograms of dried gels are shown. Control, control extract from non-irradiated cells. Arrows indicate increase in the H+-gradient. Numbers 1, 2 and 3 (marked with arrows) indicate the position of Rho species RhoA, RhoC, and RhoB, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next we studied the effect of the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D on rhoB mRNA. As shown in Fig. 3A, actinomycin D prevented the UV-induced increase in rhoB mRNA, indicating that the rhoB gene was transcriptionally activated upon UV irradiation. This was confirmed by run-on analysis showing transcriptional activation of rhoB within 15 min after UV irradiation (Fig. 3B). To determine the stability of rhoB mRNA, logarithmically growing NIH3T3 cells were treated for various periods of time with actinomycin D. As shown in Fig. 3C, 90 min after actinomycin D addition rhoB mRNA was not longer detectable. Densitometric analysis of the autoradiogram indicated a half-life of rhoB mRNA of ~20 min (Fig. 3D). In contrast to rhoB mRNA, total rho mRNA did not decrease in the presence of actinomycin D (Fig. 3, C and D). To further analyze the regulation of rhoB expression, we investigated the kinetics of rhoB mRNA increase and its subsequent degradation after treatment with serum or cycloheximide, both of them are well known inducers of c-fos. Serum stimulation of quiescent NIH3T3 cells and cycloheximide treatment of exponentially growing NIH3T3 cells both resulted in a rapid increase in rhoB mRNA. Notably, the level of rhoB mRNA remained enhanced for a longer period of time than c-fos mRNA (Fig. 4, A and B). As already observed after UV treatment, total rho mRNA level did not change after serum stimulation or cycloheximide treatment. Furthermore, neither cycloheximide nor serum influenced the level of the C3-mediated ADP-ribosylation of Rho proteins (not shown). Since protein kinases interfere with the regulation of the UV stimulated expression of c-fos(9Jähner D. Hunter T. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1259-1268PubMed Google Scholar, 16Angel P. Pöting A. Mallick U.

IRL Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1989: 29Google Scholar), we analyzed the involvement of protein kinases in the UV induction of rhoB. NIH3T3 cells were treated with different protein kinase inhibitors before UV irradiation and then the level of rhoB mRNA was assayed. As shown in Table 1, the UV-stimulated increase in the amount of rhoB mRNA was blocked after inhibition of protein kinase C by the protein kinase C-inhibitors H7 and Gö18. Likewise, UV stimulated expression of the c-fos gene was inhibited by H7 (not shown). Pretreatment of cells with the protein kinase A inhibitor H9 reduced both the basal and the UV stimulated level of rhoB mRNA (Table 1). These data indicate that protein kinases A and C are involved in the UV-stimulated expression of the rhoB gene. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein did not inhibit UV induction of rhoB (Table 1). In contrast to UV, serum-stimulated expression of rhoB was partially inhibited by protein kinase C inhibitors H7 and Gö18 as well as by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein, but not by H9 (Table 1). To further analyze components interfering with UV-stimulated rhoB expression, protein kinase C-dependent signaling cascade which was shown to be non-refractory upon repeated treatments was down-modulated by pretreatment with TPA or growth factors as described previously(54Sachsenmaier C. Radler-Pohl A. Zinck R. Nordheim A. Herrlich P. Rahmsdorf H.J. Cell. 1994; 78: 963-972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of NIH3T3 cells with TPA or serum caused a 50-70% reduction in a subsequent UV stimulation of rhoB as compared to non-pretreated control cells (Table 2). These data indicate that, with respect to rhoB expression, UV-, TPA-, and growth factor-induced signaling share common pathways.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Interestingly, in addition to UV light, the alkylating agent MNU also caused a dose-dependent increase in the amount of rhoB mRNA (Fig. 5). Under identical conditions c-fos expression was not stimulated (not shown). Table 3 summarizes the effects of various treatments on the amount of rhoB mRNA. Cisplatin, hydroxyurea, and dexamethasone also elicited rhoB induction, whereas retinoic acid and Bt2cAMP, given either by its own or in combination with TPA, were without effect.Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab RhoA and RhoC have been shown to interfere with the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, especially in the organization of growth factor-induced focal adhesions and stress fiber formation(39Chardin P. Madaule P. Tavitian A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 42Paterson H.F. Self A.J. Garrett M.S. Just I. Aktories K. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 45Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3832) Google Scholar). So far, the involvement of RhoB in the organization of actin cytoskeleton has not been demonstrated convincingly. Therefore, we were interested to see whether the UV induced increase in RhoB was accompanied by change in actin cytoskeleton. Cells were UV-irradiated and, thereafter, the actin cytoskeleton was fixed and stained by FITC-phalloidin. In a second approach to identify changes of actin cytoskeleton, e.g. depolymerization of F-actin, we used C. botulinum C2 toxin, that ADP-ribosylates specifically monomeric G-actin, but not F-actin. Neither F-actin staining by FITC-phalloidin nor the specific [32P]ADP-ribosylation of G-actin were changed after UV treatment (not shown). Furthermore, no change in F-actin was detectable after transient transfection of rhoB sense and antisense expression vectors followed by FITC staining (not shown). These data indicate that no major alteration (polymerization or depolymerization) of the actin cytoskeleton had occurred after changing RhoB expression. Overall, these findings indicate that RhoB very likely does not play a crucial role in the regulation of actin microfilaments. In this study we have shown that rhoB, encoding a Ras-related GTP-binding protein is a novel, immediate-early DNA-damage inducible gene. Similar to c-fos, the rhoB gene can be transcriptionally activated by UV light. Other mutagens such as MNU and cisplatin, as well as serum factors and the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, also evoked rhoB response. However, cycloheximide which apparently interferes with signaling (55Mahadevan L.C. Edwards D.R. Nature. 1991; 349: 747-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) did not induce rhoB in Rat2 cells(34Jähner D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3682-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), indicating that cycloheximide-mediated rhoB induction is not a general phenomenon. Obviously, there are cell-type specific differences in signaling on which cycloheximide converges. The pathway of rhoB induction appears to overlay only partially that regulating c-fos expression. For example, c-fos expression is enhanced by TPA and Bt2cAMP treatment(26Büscher M. Rahmsdorf H. Litfin M. Karin M. Herrlich P. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 301-311PubMed Google Scholar, 30Krämer M. Stein B. Mai S. Kunz E. König H. Loferer H. Grunicke H.H. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Rahmsdorf H.F. Radiat. Environ. Biophys. 1990; 29: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), whereas rhoB expression was not ((34Jähner D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3682-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and our data). Additionally, we found rhoB expression to be induced by the alkylating agent MNU in NIH3T3 cells, whereas under identical experimental conditions, c-fos expression was not enhanced. Furthermore, c-fos and rhoB mRNA showed different kinetics in that rhoB mRNA decreased at a slower rate than c-fos mRNA upon stimulation of NIH3T3 cells with cycloheximide and serum factors, respectively. These data indicate that the genes encoding c-fos and rhoB differ in respect to the factors regulating their inducible expression. On the other hand, UV-induced increase in both rhoB and c-fos mRNA was blocked by inhibitors of protein kinase A or protein kinase C, indicating a general involvement of these kinases in DNA damage-induced cellular responses. It appears that protein kinase A and C are necessary, but not sufficient components of the rhoB response. This hypothesis is based on the following findings: (i) inhibition of both protein kinases A and C prevented rhoB induction, whereas stimulation of protein kinase A and C by Bt2cAMP and TPA did not elicit an increase of rhoB expression; (ii) down-modulation of protein kinase C signaling by TPA pretreatment reduced UV induction of rhoB as compared with non-pretreated cells. Furthermore, there are differences in signal transduction pathways after mitogen- and DNA damage-stimulated rhoB expression. This was concluded from the observation that inhibition of protein kinase A by H9 only interfered with UV, but not with serum-stimulated rhoB expression. Additionally, serum-stimulated rhoB expression was sensitive to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein whereas UV-mediated rhoB induction was not sensitive. Thus, a regulatory significance of tyrosine kinases in UV response, as deduced from the analysis of the UV induction of c-jun(56Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 71: 1081-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar), appears to be questionable for rhoB. On the other hand, serum pretreatment reduced the level of a subsequent UV stimulation of rhoB, indicating overlapping of mitogen- and UV-induced signaling of rhoB induction. It is unlikely that the epidermal growth factor receptor is involved in the regulation of rhoB expression by UV because it is activated not earlier than 30-60 min after UV irradiation(57Miller C.C. Hale P. Pentland P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3529-3533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cloning of the rhoB gene to analyze its regulatory elements is required in order to clarify its obviously complex regulation. Another kinase recently shown to be activated by UV light is JNK1 kinase(58Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar). The substrate for this kinase has been identified to be c-Jun(58Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar). Whether JNK1 kinase and c-Jun also interfere with the UV-stimulated expression of rhoB remains to be elucidated. The identification of rhoB as an immediate-early gene indicates that RhoB activity is regulated not only by a GTPase cycle but also on the transcriptional level. The high homology between various Rho proteins (RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC) and their characterization as Ras homologous indicates that RhoB is also involved in signal transduction. Rho proteins are believed to participate in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton(38Aktories K. Rösener S. Blaschke U. Chhatwal G.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 172: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 39Chardin P. Madaule P. Tavitian A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 40Kikuchi A.

This was suggested from the results of microinjection experiments with purified and recombinant RhoA and RhoC protein and from the application of Rho inactivating bacterial ADP-ribosyltransferases. However, because RhoB, but not RhoA and RhoC, has been localized on prelysosomal membranes (47Adamson P. Paterson H.F. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) and only rhoB is induced by mitogens(34Jähner D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3682-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), the physiological function of RhoB appears to be distinct from that of RhoA and RhoC. This hypothesis is supported by our finding that only rhoB but not the other rho genes behaved as inducible upon treatment with DNA-damaging agents. Furthermore, UV-stimulated rhoB mRNA and protein expression, as well as transient transfection of rhoB expression vectors were not accompanied by changes in actin cytoskeleton. Thus, a major role of RhoB in the formation of actin microfilaments determining cell morphology or adhesion appears to be unlikely. Beside its involvement in cytoskeleton organization, RhoA has additionally been shown to have oncogenic activity(46Avraham H. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2058-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 59Perona R. Esteve P. Jimenez B. Ballestero R.P. Ramón y Cajal S. Lacal J.C. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1285-1292PubMed Google Scholar). In this context it is interesting that very recently RhoB has been suggested to play a role in cell growth regulation and to be necessary for transformation by oncogenic Ras(48Prendergast G.C. Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Kurzawa H. Lebowitz P.F. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2289-2296PubMed Google Scholar). Summarizing, the GTP-binding protein RhoB which is immediate-early inducible upon genotoxic stress appears to be a candidate for a regulator that directly interferes with early steps of signaling after DNA-damaging treatments. The well known immediate-early inducible proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-jun encode transcription factors that act by trans-activating late responsive genes, some of which may exhibit a protective function(60Kaina B.

Another gene product which is involved in cell cycle control and accumulates after UV irradiation is p53(18Lu X. Lane D.P. Cell. 1993; 75: 765-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 19Maltzman W. Czyzyk L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1689-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). A UV-stimulated increase in p53 is not observed earlier than 3-5 h after UV irradiation(18Lu X. Lane D.P. Cell. 1993; 75: 765-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Thus, this response appears to occur too late in order to mediate rapid cellular reactions, such as the block of replication that is maximal already 1-2 h after UV irradiation (63Haas S. Kaina B. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 985-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The immediate-early induction of RhoB indicates the existence of a new regulatory pathway which might enable cells to react very rapidly upon induction of DNA damage. It is, to our knowledge, the first evidence for a possible involvement of an inducible GTP-binding protein in the very fast acute response of mammalian cells to environmental stress. We thank Dr. T. Hunter for providing the rat rhoB cDNA and Dr. A. Hall for rhoA cDNA.

To characterize the transcriptional activation domain (TAD) of p53, various point mutants were constructed in the context of Gal4 DNA binding domain and tested for their transactivation ability.

INTRODUCTIONTranscriptional activators have been shown to stimulate in vitro the assembly of transcriptional preinitiation complexes (1Choy B. Green M.R. Nature. 1993; 366: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 2Lin Y.S. Green M.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 971-981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) as well as transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase II(3Yankulov K. Blau J. Purton T. Roberts S. Bentley D.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 749-759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This stimulation is thought to depend on direct or indirect protein-protein interactions between transcriptional activators and the general transcriptional machinery and/or on relieving the inhibitory effects of chromatin(4Felsenfeld G. Nature. 1992; 355: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 5Laybourn P.J. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1991; 254: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activators can be divided into at least two discrete functional domains(6Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar); a DNA binding/targeting domain is required to direct the activator to the appropriate DNA sequence element and then the transcriptional activation domain (TAD) 1The abbreviations used are: TADtranscriptional activation domainTBPTATA-binding proteinTAFTBP-associated factorbpbase pair(s)GSTglutathione S-transferasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisTFEtrifluoroethanol. can induce the enhanced transcription of target genes. TADs have been divided into three major classes according to a predominance of particular amino acid residues: acidic, proline-rich, or glutamine-rich(7Mitchell P. Tjian R. Science. 1988; 245: 371-378Crossref Scopus (2185) Google Scholar). Of these classes, the acidic TADs appear to be unique in that they can apparently function universally in all eukaryotes tested from yeast to human(8Sadowski I. Ma J. Triezenberg S. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar).Like other transcriptional activators, tumor suppressor protein p53 appears to have a modular domain structure; it contains an NH2-terminal region which functions as a TAD when coupled to a heterologous DNA binding domain(9Fields S. Jang S. Science. 1990; 249: 1046-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 10Raycroft L. Wu H. Lozano G. Science. 1990; 249: 1049-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), a central site-specific DNA binding domain(11Bargonetti J. Friedman P.N. Kern S.E. Vogelstein B. Prives C.

Science. 1991; 252: 1708-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar), an oligomerization domain(13Sturzbecher H.-W. Brain R. Addison C. Rudge K. Remm M. Grimaldi M. Keenan E. Jenkins J.R. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1513-1523PubMed Google Scholar, 14Iwabuchi K. Li B. Bartel P. Fields S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1693-1696PubMed Google Scholar), and a basic COOH-terminal nuclear localization domain(15Addison C. Jenkins J. Sturzbecher H.-W. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 423-426PubMed Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal TAD of p53 is similar in size, net negative charge, and transactivating potency to the well defined TAD of herpes simplex virus virion protein 16 (HSV VP16)(16Cress D. Triezenberg S.J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 103: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This region is also rich in proline residues which are conserved through evolution(17Soussi T. Caron de Fromental C. May P. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 945-952PubMed Google Scholar). Like VP16 and a number of other transactivators, p53 is thought to be a transactivator of the acidic type(9Fields S. Jang S. Science. 1990; 249: 1046-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 18Truant R. Xiao H. Ingles C.J. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2284-2287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Early studies suggested TFIID as the target for various activators(19Hirikoshi M. Carey M.F. Kakidani H. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1988; 54: 665-669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 20Hirikoshi M. Hai T. Lin Y.S. Green M.R. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1988; 54: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the TATA-binding proteins (TBP) of yeast and human were shown to bind in vitro to the strong TADs of such viral and cellular activators as VP16(21Stringer K.F. Ingles J. Greenblatt J. Nature. 1990; 345: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), E1A(22Lee W.S. Kao C.C. Bryant G.O. Liu X. Berk A.J.

A. 1992; 89: 12028-12032Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that another general transcription factor, TFIIB, interacts with various transactivators such as VP16 (26Lin Y.S. Ha I. Maldonado E. Reinberg D. Green M.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 569-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), Rel oncogene product(27Kerr L.D. Ransone L.J. Wamsley P. Schmitt M.J. Boyer T.G. Zhou Q. Berk A.J. Verma I.M.

Recent report showed that VP16 TAD and p53 TAD can also bind to TFIIH(29Xiao H. Pearson A. Coulombe B. Truant R. Zhang S. Regier J.L. Triezenberg S.J. Reinberg D. Flores O. Ingles J. Greenblatt G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7013-7024Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In addition to general transcription factors, coactivators or adaptors are required for transactivation in the in vitro transcription system. The best characterized proteins among adaptors are the TBP-associated factors (TAFs) of the Drosophila melanogaster and humans (30Dynlacht B.D. Hoey T. Tjian R. Cell. 1991; 66: 563-576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 31Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 32Tanese N.

Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1964-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that p53 TAD can also interact with two subunits of the TFIID, TAFII40, and TAFII60(34Catherine J.T. Chen J.-L. Klemm R. Tjian R. Science. 1995; 267: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Clearly, transcriptional activation appears to be more complicated than originally envisioned (6Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar) and may involve multiple targets that make direct or indirect contacts in different spatial and temporal arrangements with TADs and the transcriptional machinery.Here, we demonstrate that p53 TAD is a complex activation domain composed of two subdomains, in which positionally conserved hydrophobic residues are critical for activating function. The negatively charged residues and proline residues are also necessary for full activity, but not essential for the activity of p53 TAD. Mutations that severely impair the function of p53 TAD in vivo have been shown to diminish binding activity to TBP in vitro, indicating that the observed in vitro interaction is biologically relevant. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy demonstrates that p53 TAD peptide does not have any detectable secondary structure at physiological condition.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmid Constructions and MutagenesisGal4 DNA-binding domain expression plasmid, Gal4D, was constructed by inserting the 450-bp HindIII-XmaI fragment of pSG424 (8Sadowski I. Ma J. Triezenberg S. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar) into the HindIII-BamHI site of pcDNA (Invitrogen) following by flushing XmaI and BamHI overhangs. A DNA fragment encoding amino acids 1-73 of p53 was amplified from the human cDNA of p53 with two primers (5′-GGTCGGATCCATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCA and 3′-GGTGAAGCTTACACGGGGGGAGCAGCCTC; BamHI and HindIII sites are underlined) and digested with BamHI and HindIII. The resulting DNA fragment was ligated into the BamHI-HindIII site of pSK(-) (Stratagene), yielding pSK-p53 TAD. Gal4D-p53 TAD was generated by inserting the 210-bp BamHI-HindIII fragment of pSK-p53 TAD into the BamHI-EcoRV site of Gal4D after flushing the HindIII overhang (Fig. 1). Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed as described (35Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4543) Google Scholar) using single-stranded DNA of pSK-p53 TAD. Mutations were identified by restriction endonuclease digestion and dideoxy sequencing. The specific amino acid changes introduced by mutagenic primers are listed in Table 1. The BamHI-HindIII DNA fragments of mutant derivatives were ligated into the same site of Gal4D except for M41 and M241 in which HincII site was used instead of HindIII site. The carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant, Gal4D-p53 (1-40), was generated by ligating the 120-bp BamHI-HindIII DNA fragment of pSK-p53 TAD M41 into the same site of Gal4D. Gal4D-p53 (43-73) was obtained by inserting the 90-bp HindIII-HindIII DNA fragment of pSK-p53 TAD M41 into the EcoRI site of Gal4D after filling in cohesive ends with Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. Gal4D-p53 (1-40) M22 was generated by introducing M22 mutation into Gal4D-p53 (1-40).Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab The glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion plasmids were made by using pGEX-KG which contains a GST gene under the control of tac promoter and a flanked polycloning site(36Gaun K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar). pGEX-p53 TAD was constructed by inserting the 210-bp BamHI-HindIII DNA fragment of pSK-p53 TAD into the BamHI-HindIII site of pGEX-KG (Fig. 1). pGEX-p53 M2, M12, M19, M22, M23, M25, M31, M34, and M1234 were generated by the same method. pGEX-p53 M41 and M241 were made by inserting the BamHI-XhoI DNA fragments of pSK-p53 TAD M41 and M241 into the BamHI-XhoI sites of pGEX-KG, respectively. pGEX-p53(1-40) was generated by inserting the 120-bp BamHI-HindIII DNA fragment of pSK-p53 TAD M41 into the BamHI-HindIII site of pGEX-KG. The reporter plasmid, G5E1bCAT, was described previously(37Lee C.Q. Yun Y. Hoeffler J.P. Habener J.F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4455-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar).Transfection and Chloramphenicol Acetyltransferase AssaysBHK-21 and COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Plasmid transfections were carried out by a DEAE-dextran method(38Queen C. Baltimore D. Cell. 1983; 33: 741-748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Cells (106) were seeded on a 100-mm dish 24 h before transfection and transfected with 1 μg of each of the reporter and activator plasmids. At 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity was measured as described previously(39Lee C.W. Chang J. Lee K.J. Sung Y.C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2708-2719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine expression levels of the Gal4 fusions, COS-7 cells were transfected in parallel with 2 μg of activator plasmids. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (40Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3908) Google Scholar) and electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described (41Gill G. Pascal E. Tseng Z. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) with DNA fragment containing five Gal4 binding sites. The amount of probes shifted by each derivative was quantitated using a Fuji BAS2000 photoimager. The difference in transfection efficiency was normalized by using a second reporter plasmid, pGL2 (Promega), containing a luciferase gene. Luciferase activity was measured by using the luciferase assay system (Promega) according to supplier's recommendation. All chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay data reported in this article were from points in the linear range of the assay.GST Pull-down ExperimentGST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli DH5α and were purified by using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in accordance with the supplier's recommendation. 35S-Labeled human TBP was generated by using a coupled transcription-translation reticulocyte lysate (TNT system, Promega) with linearized pETHIID plasmid (42Kao C.C. Lieberman P.M. Schmidt M.C. Zhou Q. Pei R. Berk A.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1646-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) as a template. 200 ng of GST-p53 TAD and mutant derivatives coupled to 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads was incubated at 4°C with 35S-labeled TBP in 600 μl of a buffer solution containing 40 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 1 h. To minimize potential bead losses during subsequent washes, the buffer was mixed with glutathione beads to adjust a total bead volume of 20 μl/reaction. Following this incubation, the beads were washed five times with the same buffer and bound proteins eluted with sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) loading buffer. The proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Signals were quantitated on a Fuji BAS2000 photoimager and plotted to obtain a graphical representation of the results.Purification of p53 TAD PeptidesFor large scale production of p53 TAD, E. coli DH5α cells containing pGEX-p53 TAD were induced with 0.2 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside and harvested 4 h after induction. The fusion protein was purified from the soluble extract by use of binding affinity to glutathione-Sepharose beads. The p53 TAD peptide was released from the GST moiety in a buffer containing 100 mM NaCl and 2.5 mM CaCl2 using 1 μg of thrombin (Sigma)/1 mg of fusion protein. The peptide was further purified by gel filtration chromatography using Superose 12 (Pharmacia). The peptide after the gel filtration step was found to be homogeneous as judged by Coomassie Blue staining of the gel after SDS-PAGE. The identity of the peptide was determined by amino acid composition analysis. The M22 mutant derivative was also purified by the same method.CD SpectroscopyCD experiments were performed with a spectropolarimeter Jasco J-720. A cuvette with 0.1-cm of path length was used for all spectral measurements. Measurements were made at room temperature in 5 mM phosphate buffer. The concentrations of peptides were determined by absorbance at 280 nm in the phosphate buffer. The used peptide concentrations were 17 μM for wild type p53 TAD and 15 μM for the M22 mutant. All spectra were corrected for background using the phosphate buffer and averaged from the spectra of at least four scans. The pH values were measured with a microelectrode calibrated at two reference pH values.RESULTSMutational Analysis of p53 TADThe preponderance of acidic amino acids within p53 TAD suggests that negative charge is a critical component of the activation domain structure. To test whether activation function is simply related to the net negative charge, we constructed Gal4D-p53 TAD and replaced, in combination, the acidic amino acids within the activation domain with uncharged or positively charged residues (Fig. 1). From the relative activities of such mutants (Table 1), we infer that negative charge is necessary for the optimal activity of p53 TAD. The M41 mutant was less active than the M2 mutant, indicating that mutations of negatively charged residues, Glu-2 and Glu-3, had a less effect on the activity than mutations on Asp-41 and Asp-42 residues. The M241 mutant was less active than the M41 mutant, showing that replacement of increasing numbers of acidic residues with other residues led to a progressive decrease in transcriptional activation. It was reported previously that the acidic residues at the amino terminus of the p53 protein may influence, but are not critical for, the transcriptional activation (43Lin J. Chen J. Elenbaas B. Levine A.J. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar).The p53 TAD is also rich in proline residues (19.2%), which is a characteristic of another class of TAD, such as CTF/NF-1(44Mermod N. O'Neill E.A. Kelley T.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 58: 741-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). When M12 and M34 mutants were tested, there were about 39 and 24% reduction in p53 TAD-mediated transactivation, respectively. As expected, the M1234 mutant containing mutations in four Pro residues was shown to be about 71% reduction in the transactivation (Table 1), indicating that there was additive effect with these mutations and that proline residues are also required for the optimal activity of p53 TAD.Previous studies on the VP16 TAD have suggested that the acidic residues contribute to its activity, but intervening hydrophobic residues are more important than other residues(45Cress W.D. Triezenberg S.J. Science. 1991; 251: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). TADs of a number of transactivators exhibit a conserved pattern of hydrophobic residues (45Cress W.D. Triezenberg S.J. Science. 1991; 251: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Since p53 TAD also shows the similar pattern of positionally conserved hydrophobic residues (Fig. 2), we generated various mutants in which conserved hydrophobic amino acids were replaced with hydrophilic ones. When these mutants were tested for transactivation activity in BHK-21 and COS-7 cells, the activities of several mutants were significantly impaired (Table 1). Mutations on both residues Leu-22 and Trp-23 reduced p53 TAD-mediated transactivation by about 95%, whereas mutations on Leu-25 and Leu-26 resulted in approximately 88% loss of the activity. Also, single amino acid change on Phe-19 reduced the activity by about 85%. In contrast, mutations on both Val-31 and Leu-32, which are not positionally conserved, did not impair the transactivation function but rather enhance the activity. Therefore, we concluded that the positionally conserved hydrophobic residues, Phe-19, Leu-22, Trp-23, Leu-25, and Leu-26 are critical for transactivation function of p53 TAD. These residues are identical in all sequences of p53 protein from several species(17Soussi T. Caron de Fromental C. May P. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 945-952PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of mutations on Leu-22 and Trp-23 is consistent with a previous report(43Lin J. Chen J. Elenbaas B. Levine A.J. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), but those of mutations on Phe-19 and on Leu-25 and Leu-26 do not exactly coincide with their results in which human p53 mutant protein containing the double mutation on Leu-14 and Phe-19 was observed to have a 50% reduction in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity compared with wild type p53. In addition, the Leu-25 and Leu-26 double mutant showed either enhanced or reduced activity in Saos-2 cells, depending on p53-responsive elements either from the creatine phosphokinase gene or from the mdm-2 gene(43Lin J. Chen J. Elenbaas B. Levine A.J. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar).Figure 2Comparison of the primary amino acid sequences of different TADs.

The difference in the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity is, therefore, due to the intrinsic biological activity of different Gal4 fusion proteins, but not by the different level of Gal4 fusion proteins in the transfected cells. Although the transactivating abilities of mutants constructed in the foregoing studies were severely impaired, residual activity still remained, suggesting that p53 TAD is composed of separable subdomains just like VP16 (46Triezenberg S.J. Kingsbury R.C. McKnight S.L. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 718-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) and Epstein-Barr virus Rta transactivator(47Hardwick J.M. Tse L. Applegren N. Nicholas J. Veliuona M.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5500-5508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was previously shown that the minimal activation domain of p53 lies within the first 42 amino acids of the protein(48Unger T. Nau M.M. Segal S. Minna J.D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Since Gal4D-p53(1-40) consistently showed about 30-38% activity of Gal4D-p53 TAD, which contains the residues 1-73, residues 43-73 appear to be necessary for the full p53 TAD-mediated transactivation. To be certain that residues of p53 from 43 to 73 also contain an autonomous TAD, Gal4D-p53 (43-73) was constructed and tested for the transactivating ability. The resulting plasmid showed about 6% activity of Gal4D-p53 TAD (Table 1), indicating that there is an autonomous TAD in this subregion. In the case of VP16, the truncated activation domain possesses approximately 50% of wild type activity, whereas the addition of COOH-terminal subdomain restored the full activity(46Triezenberg S.J. Kingsbury R.C. McKnight S.L. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 718-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Gal4D-p53(1-40) M22, which deletes the COOH-terminal subregion from M22 mutant, completely lost the residual activity of M22 mutant (Table 1), demonstrating that the residual activity comes from the separable COOH-terminal subdomain, and that Leu-22 and Trp-23 are absolutely required for the function of minimal activating region (residues 1-40) of p53.In Vitro TBP Binding Activity of p53 TAD and MutantsPrevious studies showed that p53 TAD interacts directly and specifically with yeast and human TBP(18Truant R.

Biol. 1993; 13: 3291-3300Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) to TBP were reported to correlate with their transactivation abilities in vivo, suggesting that p53 TAD activates transcription by directly interacting with TBP. In contrast, Lin et al.(43Lin J. Chen J. Elenbaas B. Levine A.J. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) reported that wild type p53 and transactivation-deficient mutants, including R175H mutation, could bind equally well to human TBP when tested with immunoprecipitation and far-Western analysis. Thus, it remains controversial whether TBP is the target molecule of p53 TAD, and binding activity of p53 TAD to TBP is directly related to p53 TAD-mediated transactivation. To clarify this discrepancy, the residues of wild type p53 TAD from 1 to 73 and its derivatives were placed under the GST gene to generate pGEX-p53 TAD fusion constructs (Fig. 1). The GST-p53 TAD fusion protein and its derivatives were expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography (Fig. 3A). The purified fusion proteins were assayed for the activity to bind in vitro translated human TBP in a GST pull-down experiment. As shown in Fig. 3B and Table 1, the levels of TBP precipitated by GST-p53 TAD and mutant derivatives are linearly correlated with the ability of transactivation in vivo. Binding reactions were performed under nonsaturating condition, where GST-p53 TAD and mutant derivatives were a limiting factor. Under this condition, about 20% of input TBP bound to the GST-p53 TAD. We have repeated these binding assays at several times with different batches of fusion proteins and in vitro translated TBP. Relative binding activities were reproducible and resulted in the same relative order for TBP binding. This establishes a direct relationship between transactivation ability in vivo and the binding activity of the p53 TAD to TBP in vitro (Fig. 3C). The TBP binding activities of M22, M25, and M19 mutants lacking critical hydrophobic residues but bearing identical net negative charge were significantly decreased when compared with that of wild type p53 TAD, indicating that the binding of p53 TAD to TBP is not due to nonspecific ionic interaction between the positively charged region of TBP and negatively charged p53 TAD. These results do not agree well with previous report in which the binding ability of p53 protein to TBP was not affected by the mutations at residues 22 and 23 (43Lin J. Chen J. Elenbaas B.

https://openalex.org/W1992404471,"A repeated element, the inositol-sensitive upstream activation sequence (UAS<sub>INO</sub>), having the consensus sequence, 5′-CATGTGAAAT-3′, is present in the promoters of genes encoding enzymes of phospholipid biosynthesis that are regulated in response to the phospholipid precursors, inositol and choline. None of the naturally occurring variants of the UAS<sub>INO</sub> element exactly recapitulates the consensus (for review, see Carman, G. M., and Henry, S. A.(1989) <i>Annu. Rev. Biochem.</i> 58, 635-669 and Paltauf, [Medline] F., Kolwhein, S., and Henry, S. A.(1992) in <i>Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> (Broach, J., Jones, E., and Pringle, J., eds) Vol. 2, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY). The first six bases of the UAS<sub>INO</sub> element are homologous with canonical binding motif for proteins of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family. Two bHLH regulatory proteins, Ino2p and Ino4p from yeast, were previously shown to bind to promoter fragments containing this element. In the present study, an extensive analysis of UAS<sub>INO</sub> function has been conducted. We report that any base substitution within the putative bHLH binding site resulted either in a dramatic reduction or in a complete obliteration of UAS<sub>INO</sub> function as tested in an expression assay <i>in vivo</i>. Base substitutions in the 5′ region that flanks the 10-base pair repeat, as well as sequences within the repeat itself at its 3′ end outside the bHLH core, were also assessed. The two bases immediately flanking the 5′ end of the element proved to be very important to its function as a UAS element as did the two bases immediately 3′ of the bHLH core motif. Substitutions of the final two bases of the original ten base pair consensus (<i>i.e.</i> 5′-CATGTGAAAT-3′) had less dramatic effects. We also tested a subset of the altered elements for their ability to serve as competitors in an assay of Ino2p•Ino4p binding. The strength of any given sequence as a UAS<sub>INO</sub> element, as assayed <i>in vivo</i> was strongly correlated with its strength as a competitor for Ino2p•Ino4p binding. We also tested a subset of the modified UAS<sub>INO</sub> elements for their effects on expression <i>in vivo</i> in a strain carrying an <i>opi1</i> mutation. The <i>opi1</i> mutation renders the coregulated enzymes of phospholipid synthesis constitutive in the presence of phospholipid precursors. All elements that retained some residual UAS<sub>INO</sub> activity when tested in the wild-type strain were constitutively expressed at a level comparable with the wild-type derepressed level when tested in the <i>opi1</i> mutant. Thus, UAS<sub>INO</sub> appears to be responsible for <i>OPI1</i> mediated repression, as well as Ino2p•Ino4p binding. Furthermore, each of the identified functions of the UAS<sub>INO</sub> element appears to have the same sequence specificity, and all require the presence of the intact bHLH motif, suggesting that transcriptional activation, repression, and Ino2p•Ino4p binding are all components of a single regulatory mechanism."

The activation of the kinase after incubation of dark-adapted thylakoids at pH 4.3 coincides with an increase in the plastoquinol:plastoquinone ratio up to 0.25. However, rapid plastoquinol reoxidation (<1 min) at pH 7.4 contrasts with the slow kinase deactivation (t1/2 = 4 min), which indicates that the redox control is not directly dependent on the plastoquinone pool. Use of inhibitors and a cytochrome bf-deficient mutant of Lemna demonstrate the involvement of the cytochrome bf complex in the low-pH induced protein phosphorylation. EPR spectroscopy shows that subsequent to the transient low pH treatment and transfer of the thylakoids to pH 7.4, cytochrome f, the Rieske Fe-S center, and plastocyanin become reduced and are not reoxidized while the kinase is slowly deactivated.

Iron is removed from these proteins and transported across the outer membrane, presumably by an energy-dependent TonB-mediated process (17Chen C.-Y. Berish S.A. Morse S.A. Mietzner T.A. Mol.

Science. 1992; 258: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The result is deposition of free iron within the periplasm, where it is separated from the cytosol, its eventual destination, by the cytoplasmic membrane(21Neilands J.B. Konopka K. Schwyn B. Coy M. Francis T.T. Paw B.H. Bagg A. Winkelmann G. van der Helm D. Neilands J.B. Iron Transport in Microbes, Plants and Animals. VCH Publishers, Weinheim, West Germany1987: 3-33Google Scholar). Transport of free iron from the periplasmic space into the cytoplasm is proposed to occur by a classic active transport process involving a periplasmic binding protein, a specific cytoplasmic permease, and an energy-supplying nucleotide-binding protein(22Ames G.F.-L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 397-425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Much of what is known about the biochemistry of active transport systems has been revealed through the study of model active transport systems for amino acids and sugars in Escherichia coli(22Ames G.F.-L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 397-425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Shea C.M. McIntosh M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1415-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Similar systems for siderophore-mediated iron transport have been described for E. coli and related organisms at the genetic level(23Shea C.M. McIntosh M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1415-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar); however, relatively little is known regarding the basic biochemistry of these iron transport processes. A genetic locus critical to the transport of iron in H. influenzae has recently been described by Hansen and colleagues (24Sanders J. Cope L. Hansen E. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4515-4525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This locus was identified through complementation of a H. influenzae isolate unable to grow on medium containing protoporphyrin IX and free iron. An 11.5-kb 1The abbreviations used are: kbkilobase(s)Fbpferric iron-binding proteinPCRpolymerase chain reactionPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisbpbase pair(s)NA/Dip200nutrient agar containing 200 μM dipyridyl. genomic DNA fragment from an isolate proficient for growth on this medium was identified by this analysis(24Sanders J. Cope L. Hansen E. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4515-4525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Essential for this phenotype was a ~4-kb operon composed of three genes: hitA, hitB, and hitC (hit for Haemophilus Iron Transport) proposed to encode a periplasmic iron-binding protein, a cytoplasmic permease, and a nucleotide-binding protein, respectively. A homologous three-gene operon was originally described for Serratia marcescens and designated sfu for Serratia Ferric-iron Uptake(25Zimmermann L. Angerer A. Braun V. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 238-243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sfu operon was isolated based upon its ability to complement an E. coli strain (H-1443) deficient in its ability to produce siderophores for growth on nutrient agar containing 200 μM 2,2′-dipyridyl (dipyridyl), an iron chelator that sequesters free iron in the medium (25Zimmermann L. Angerer A. Braun V. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 238-243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Angerer A. Gaosser S. Braun V. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 572-578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The open reading frames encoded by the hitABC and sfuABC genes were found to share 38, 37, and 38% identity between respective A, B, and C components at the predicted amino acid level. The similarities between the hit and sfu genetic loci suggest a high level of conservation among two diverse species. kilobase(s) ferric iron-binding protein polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis base pair(s) nutrient agar containing 200 μM dipyridyl. At the protein level, Harkness and colleagues (27Harkness R.E. Chong P. Klein M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2425-2430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) originally observed a quantitatively major, iron-regulated periplasmic protein, subsequently genetically defined as hitA(24Sanders J. Cope L. Hansen E. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4515-4525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The predicted open reading frame of hitA is nearly 80% homologous with the ferric iron-binding protein (Fbp) expressed by pathogenic Neisseria(17Chen C.-Y. Berish S.A. Morse S.A. Mietzner T.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 29Mietzner T.A. Morse S.A. Schoolnik G.K. Brooks G.F. Falkow S. Knapp J.S. McCutchan A. Morse S.A. The Pathogenic Neisseriae.

Med. 1990; 171: 1535-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Similarly, the open reading frame of sfuA predicts a protein sequence sharing substantial homology (~40% identity) with the Neisserial Fbp(17Chen C.-Y. Berish S.A. Morse S.A. Mietzner T.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Fbp is a periplasmic iron-binding protein expressed by all pathogenic Neisseria that functions as the binding component of a high affinity active transport system for the assimilation of growth-essential iron from the Transferrins. Purified Fbp binds a single Fe3+ ion with an affinity approaching that of the Transferrins (17Chen C.-Y. Berish S.A. Morse S.A. Mietzner T.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 34Crichton R.R. Ward R.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11255-11264Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 35Nowalk A. Tencza S. Mietzner T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12769-12775Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and by a mechanism that is remarkably conserved among this family of proteins, coordinating iron through two tyrosines, a single histidine, and a bicarbonate anion(35Nowalk A. Tencza S. Mietzner T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12769-12775Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In our study we will refer to these Fbp homologues as NFbp for Neisseria Fbp derived from the fbp gene locus (33Berish S.A. Mietzner T.A. Mayer L.W. Genco C.W. Holloway B.P. Morse S.A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 1535-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), HFbp for Haemophilus Fbp derived from the hitA locus(24Sanders J. Cope L. Hansen E. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4515-4525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and SFbp for Serratia Fbp derived from the sfuA locus(26Angerer A. Gaosser S. Braun V. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 572-578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is clear is that a common free iron active transport system exists among pathogenic members of the diverse microbial families Enterobacteriaceae (sfu operon), Pasteurellaceae (hit operon), and Neisseriaceae (fbp operon). The existence of this common system may reflect its contribution to the pathogenicity of these organisms. Studies on the HFbp, NFbp, and SFbp homologues and their respective operons predict that they should function similarly. This report describes the ability of purified HFbp to efficiently compete for dipyridyl-bound iron in vitro. Like the sfu operon, hitABC can complement the siderophore-deficient E. coli strain H-1443 to growth on dipyridyl-containing medium. We further demonstrate that labeled iron from this medium is initially bound to periplasmic HFbp and can only be transported into the cell if a functional permease and nucleotide-binding protein are present. These studies explain why the siderophore-deficient E. coli expressing the hit operon can be complemented to growth on dipyridyl-containing media. Furthermore, they represent the first comprehensive biochemical analysis of a periplasmic iron transport system. Type b H. influenzae strain DL63 was obtained from E. Hansen, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas. E. coli strains DH5α and JM109 were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI).

Whatman no. 4 filter paper was purchased from Whatman (Maidstone, United Kingdom). The Amicon concentration cell and Diaflo ultrafiltration membranes were from Amicon (Lexington, MA). A 700-bp hitA gene fragment was PCR amplified from H. influenzae DL63 chromosomal DNA by designing a primer based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of a 40-kDa iron-regulated periplasmic protein suspected to be the H. influenzae Fbp analog (27Harkness R.E. Chong P. Klein M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2425-2430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and by designing a second primer to a conserved region shared by the closely related sfuA(26Angerer A. Gaosser S. Braun V. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 572-578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and gonococcal fbp genes(33Berish S.A. Mietzner T.A. Mayer L.W. Genco C.W. Holloway B.P. Morse S.A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 1535-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). PCR reactions were performed in 50 μl volumes by methods previously described(28Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1990: 3-12Google Scholar). The PCR profile consisted of 25 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 50°C for 2 min, and 72°C for 2.5 min which was followed by a final extension of 72°C for 10 min. Cloning of an intact hitA containing construct was achieved by screening a previously prepared βZap II H. influenzae DL63 chromosomal DNA library using the α-32P 700-bp random hexamer-labeled hitA PCR product as a probe. The βZap II gene library was prepared by random mechanical shearing of DL63 chromosomal DNA followed by blunt ending the sheared products using S1 nuclease. The blunted products were methylated using EcoRI methylase to protect genomic EcoRI sites and then treated with Klenow to ensure blunt ending of the genomic DNA fragments. The blunted, methylated fragments were ligated to EcoRI linkers using T4 DNA ligase and then digested with EcoRI restriction endonuclease. The DNA was then size-fractionated on a sucrose density gradient to obtain 5-10-kb fragments which were subsequently cloned into the unique EcoRI site within the lacZ gene pBluescript portion of the βZap II vector. Plating of the library was done in accordance with the manufacturer's directions except for the following modifications: LB broth containing 0.7% Difco agar and 10 mM MgS04 was used in the place of NZY agar; similarly, LB top agar was used to replace NZY top agar. Plaque lifts were performed on the plated library by applying nitrocellulose filters to plates prechilled to 4°C and incubating the plates with the applied filters at this temperature for 30 min. Subsequently, filters were marked for orientation, removed from the plates, and screened according to the Stratagene protocol. After two rounds of screening, a number of positive clones were identified, and the pBluescript SKII+ phagemids were excised as per the manufacturer's instructions. One of these clones was designated pBSJ1 and was shown to contain an ~3.5-kb genomic DNA fragment which included the intact hitA gene, approximately two-thirds of the coding region for hitB, and 1.3 kb of noncoding sequence upstream of hitA (Fig. 1). The fragment containing the minimal hitABC from H. influenzae was prepared by PCR amplification as described in Fig. 2. PCR reactions were performed in 100 μl volumes using standard conditions previously described (33Berish S.A. Mietzner T.A. Mayer L.W. Genco C.W. Holloway B.P. Morse S.A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 1535-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and 10 units of Taq polymerase and 10 units of Taq extender. Amplification was achieved by 27 cycles of denaturation (95°C for 1.5 min), annealing (60°C for 2 min), and extension (72°C for 3 min). At cycle 17, the reactions were replenished with an additional 5 units of both Taq polymerase and Taq extender. Specifically, primers were designed to the extreme ends of the hitABC sequence (24Sanders J. Cope L. Hansen E. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4515-4525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that included ~250 bp upstream and 230 bp downstream of this operon. For the upstream primer, hitO-5′, there was an engineered 5′ SmaI site; the downstream primer hitO-3′ included a 3′ BamHI site (Table 1). Using these primers and the plasmid pJDS150 as template, a PCR fragment of approximately 4.2 kb was generated. Following PCR, the amplified fragment was gel purified and digested simultaneously with BamHI and SmaI for about 4 h at 37°C. The PCR fragment was combined with the 4.2-kb EcoRV-BamHI fragment of pBR322 (gel-purified) at a 3:1 ratio of insert to vector. Ligation was achieved using standard conditions(33Berish S.A. Mietzner T.A. Mayer L.W. Genco C.W. Holloway B.P. Morse S.A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 1535-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This ligation was used to transform competent E. coli strain H-1443 and the transformants selected on LB agar containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Transformants were screened for tetracycline sensitivity on LB plates containing 25 μg/ml of this antibiotic. Tetracycline sensitive clones were screened for plasmid DNA and the presence of hitABC insert verified by PCR amplification as described above.Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab A hitC deletion mutant was constructed in order to demonstrate the essential nature of this gene to the complementation of H-1443 to growth on nutrient agar containing 200 μM dipyridyl (NA/Dip200). A 1.3-kb fragment of DNA was deleted from the ClaI site (~400 bp from the stop codon in hitC) to the NarI site (at position 1205 in pBR322). This was achieved by complete digestion of pAHIO with NarI followed by a partial ClaI digest. From this partial digest the approximately 7-kb partial product that contains the deleted hitC gene was gel-purified. Subsequently, this fragment was ligated under standard conditions and used to transform E. coli H-1443 cells to ampicillin resistance. Positive clones were confirmed by restriction digest analysis and the plasmid expressing this mutation designated pAHIOΔhitC. Similar to what was observed for the overexpression of NFbp in an E. coli background(32Berish S.A. Chen C.-Y. Mietzner T.A. Morse S.A. Mol. Microbiol.. 1991; 6: 2607-2615Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar), overnight growth of JM109(pBSJ1) resulted in a distinctly red pellet upon centrifugation of a 1.5 ml suspension, suggestive of the overexpression of HFbp. This was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis of crude CTAB lysates from E. coli JM109 (pBSJ1), prepared as described previously(32Berish S.A. Chen C.-Y. Mietzner T.A. Morse S.A. Mol. Microbiol.. 1991; 6: 2607-2615Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This analysis indicated a major protein with a molecular mass of ~40 kDa (data not shown). Purification of HFbp was achieved by a modification of the method of Berish et al.(32Berish S.A. Chen C.-Y. Mietzner T.A. Morse S.A. Mol. Microbiol.. 1991; 6: 2607-2615Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar) using 2-liter cultures of JM109(pBSJ1) in LB supplemented with 200 μg/ml ampicillin, grown with aeration at 37°C for 22-24 h. The cells were harvested by pelleting at 5000 × g for 15 min at 4°C and washed once in phosphate-buffered saline followed by suspension in 25 ml of 1 M Tris, pH 8.0. Lysis of the cells was performed by treating this cell suspension with 25 ml of a 4% (w/v) CTAB solution accompanied by shaking for 1 h at 37°C. The solution was then diluted to 400 ml with dH2O, the particulates removed by centrifugation (7000 × g for 15 min at 4°C), and the solubilized material reserved. The pelleted debris were suspended in 25 ml of 1 M Tris, pH 8.0, and subjected to a second round of CTAB lysis and pelleting of particulate material as described above. The lysates from the two CTAB lysis steps were then combined and diluted to a final volume of 1 liter with dH2O and clarified by filtration through Whatman no. 4 filter paper. The clarified lysate was applied to a CM-Sepharose CL-6B column connected in series to a DEAE-Sephacel column (6 cm diameter × 15 cm length and 6 cm diameter × 7 cm length, respectively). Equilibration of the CM-Sepharose column was accomplished by washing with five volumes of 1 M NaOH followed by five volumes of 10 mM Tris base, pH 8.0, containing 1 M NaCl (high salt buffer) and five volumes of 10 mM Tris base, pH 8.0 (low salt buffer). The DEAE column was equilibrated by washing with five volumes of high salt buffer followed by five volumes of low salt buffer. The soluble CTAB extract was applied to the equilibrated system at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min and the HFbp-containing eluant collected. This eluant, which contained >95% HFbp, was concentrated 10-fold in an Amicon cell using a 10-kDa cutoff Diaflo ultrafiltration membrane. Alternatively, the protein was precipitated by bringing the eluant to a final concentration of 80% ethanol (v/v) to yield a pure HFbp precipitate. The purification of NFbp was performed as described previously(32Berish S.A. Chen C.-Y. Mietzner T.A. Morse S.A. Mol. Microbiol.. 1991; 6: 2607-2615Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Protein determinations were obtained using a modified Lowry method(32Berish S.A. Chen C.-Y. Mietzner T.A. Morse S.A. Mol. Microbiol.. 1991; 6: 2607-2615Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). HFbp and NFbp preparations (5 μg each) were analyzed on a 12% acrylamide gel using reducing SDS-PAGE conditions as described previously(32Berish S.A. Chen C.-Y. Mietzner T.A. Morse S.A. Mol. Microbiol.. 1991; 6: 2607-2615Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Molecular mass estimates were obtained from this analysis using least-squares method from molecular weight standards on the same gel. Predicted molecular masses of HFbp and NFbp were obtained from their previously published DNA sequences(24Sanders J. Cope L. Hansen E. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4515-4525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Berish S.A. Mietzner T.A. Mayer L.W. Genco C.W. Holloway B.P. Morse S.A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 1535-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Isoelectric focusing was performed as described previously for the gonococcal Fbp(32Berish S.A. Chen C.-Y. Mietzner T.A. Morse S.A. Mol. Microbiol.. 1991; 6: 2607-2615Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Visible absorbance spectra were determined from a 2-mg/ml sample of purified HFbp in 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, containing 200 mM NaCl, as described previously(35Nowalk A. Tencza S. Mietzner T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12769-12775Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). HFbp iron affinity was estimated from citrate competition assays performed using a method nearly identical to that described for NFbp by Chen et al.(17Chen C.-Y. Berish S.A. Morse S.A. Mietzner T.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). For this analysis, aliquots of HFbp were incubated with increasing concentrations of citrate, pH 8.0, and deferration of HFbp was monitored by decrease in absorbance at 483 nm. Bacterial cultures for these assays were prepared by inoculation with a single colony in 5 ml of nutrient broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin (if required) and grown for 8 h at 37°C. A 100-μl aliquot of the culture was plated onto nutrient agar containing 75 μM dipyridyl, 100 μg/ml ampicillin (if required), and 107 counts/min [55Fe](NO3)3 (0.1 μmol). Plates were grown at 37°C for 12 h and the bacteria harvested. The bacteria were then washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, suspended to an OD600 of 0.68 in phosphate-buffered saline, and 1.5 ml of each culture was pelleted. The periplasmic fraction was isolated using a modification of the method of Ames(22Ames G.F.-L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 397-425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, pellets were resuspended in 20 μl of chloroform, vortexed, and incubated at 25°C for 15 min. 100 μl of 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, was added to each sample, followed by vortexing. Samples were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 7000 × g and the aqueous phase containing the periplasmic fraction was removed. The remaining chloroform suspension represents the non-periplasmic fraction of the bacteria. Samples were counted after dissolving them in 3 ml of scintillation mixture. Plating data were obtained by growing strains to mid-log phase in LB supplemented with ampicillin (where necessary) and diluted to a concentration that would allow 100-200 colony forming units/plate. Under these conditions, the aroB-E. coli strain H-1443 grows on nutrient agar containing 100 μM dipyridyl but not on NA/Dip200. The hitA expressing E. coli H-1443(pBSJ1), hitABC expressing H-1443(pAHIO), and the deletion mutant H-1443 (pAHIOΔhitC) were investigated for single-colony growth on nutrient agar containing 100 μM and 200 μM dipyridyl. DH5α was used as a positive control (data not shown), whereas H-1443 and H-1443(pBR322) were used as negative controls. Growth was scored as positive when pinpoint single colonies occurred after 20 h at 37°C and negative if no isolated colonies were observed after 20 h. Cloning and sequencing of the hitABC operon were recently reported by Sanders et al.(24Sanders J. Cope L. Hansen E. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4515-4525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Independently, we have cloned the hitA region gene. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” the gene encoding HFbp was cloned based upon amino acid sequence homology between NFbp (33Berish S.A. Mietzner T.A. Mayer L.W. Genco C.W. Holloway B.P. Morse S.A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 1535-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and SFbp(26Angerer A. Gaosser S. Braun V. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 572-578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To accomplish this, PCR was used to amplify a 700-bp"
https://openalex.org/W2066566675,"Heparan sulfate proteoglycans are thought to be obligatory for receptor binding and subsequent mitogenic activity of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2). In a previous study (Nurcombe V., Ford, M. D., Wildschut, J., Bartlett, P. F.(1993) Science 260, 103-106) we have shown that primary cultures of mouse neuroepithelial cells and a cell line derived from them, 2.3D, secrete a heparan sulfate proteoglycan with a high affinity for FGF-2. In this study, a combination of affinity chromatography and gel chromatography was used to further isolate heparan sulfate side chains with high affinity for FGF-2. These active chains had an average molecular weight of 18,000-20,000. In order to determine whether heparan sulfate chains with specificity for FGF-2 also displayed selectivity for the different FGF receptors, peptides designed to the heparin-binding region of the receptors were used in competitive inhibition studies. The structure of the predicted heparin-binding domain of the FGF receptor 1 was modeled on the basis of its presumed secondary and tertiary structure homology with immunoglobulin loops. These results suggested that many of the basic residues within the second immunoglobulin loop of the FGF receptor 1 form a basic domain in the molecule and therefore form part of a heparin-binding site. Peptides homologous to this region of FGF receptor 1 were shown to inhibit mitogenesis in 2.3D cells, while those to FGF receptor types 2, 3, and 4 did not. A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay designed to detect expression of the four FGF receptors types demonstrated that FGF receptors 1 and 3 were present on the 2.3D cell line but that receptors 2 and 4 were not. These findings indicate that unique heparan sulfate domains interact with specific cell-surface receptors to direct cellular responses. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans are thought to be obligatory for receptor binding and subsequent mitogenic activity of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2). In a previous study (Nurcombe V., Ford, M. D., Wildschut, J., Bartlett, P. F.(1993) Science 260, 103-106) we have shown that primary cultures of mouse neuroepithelial cells and a cell line derived from them, 2.3D, secrete a heparan sulfate proteoglycan with a high affinity for FGF-2. In this study, a combination of affinity chromatography and gel chromatography was used to further isolate heparan sulfate side chains with high affinity for FGF-2. These active chains had an average molecular weight of 18,000-20,000. In order to determine whether heparan sulfate chains with specificity for FGF-2 also displayed selectivity for the different FGF receptors, peptides designed to the heparin-binding region of the receptors were used in competitive inhibition studies. The structure of the predicted heparin-binding domain of the FGF receptor 1 was modeled on the basis of its presumed secondary and tertiary structure homology with immunoglobulin loops. These results suggested that many of the basic residues within the second immunoglobulin loop of the FGF receptor 1 form a basic domain in the molecule and therefore form part of a heparin-binding site. Peptides homologous to this region of FGF receptor 1 were shown to inhibit mitogenesis in 2.3D cells, while those to FGF receptor types 2, 3, and 4 did not. A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay designed to detect expression of the four FGF receptors types demonstrated that FGF receptors 1 and 3 were present on the 2.3D cell line but that receptors 2 and 4 were not. These findings indicate that unique heparan sulfate domains interact with specific cell-surface receptors to direct cellular responses.

Progr. Neurobiol. 1993; 41: 683-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The biological effects of the FGFs are derived from their interactions with specific, high affinity cell-surface receptors(2Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar, 3Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Dionne C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). The FGF receptor family consists of at least four types: FGFR1 (flg)(4Reid H.H. Wilks A.F. Bernard O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1991; 88: 1095-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), and FGFR4(8Stark K.L. McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P. Development. 1991; 113: 641-651PubMed Google Scholar, 9Partanen J. Makela T.P.

These integral transmembrane proteins have been identified within the mammalian central nervous system(10Asai T. Wanaka A. Kato H. Masana Y. Seo M. Tohyama Y. Mol. Brain Res. 1993; 17: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Three of these receptors, FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3, can transduce the FGF-2 signal in vitro(6Dionne C.A. Crumley G. Bellot F.

Biol. 1992; 12: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The temporal and spatial regulation of these isoforms suggest that they are likely to play a major role in the specificity of bioactivation of the FGFs in different tissues throughout the body(16Ledoux D. Mereau A. Pieri I. Barritault D. Courty J. Growth Factors. 1991; 5: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 17Givol D. Yayon A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 11620-11627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).FGFs are also known to interact with a large number of low affinity sites on the cell surface and within the surrounding extracellular matrix. These sites have been identified as heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG), and are proposed to form complexes with FGFs to protect them against proteolysis and thermal denaturation(19Saksela, O., Moscatelli, D., Sommer, A., Rifkin, D. B., J. Cell Biol., 107, 743-751.Google Scholar, 20David G. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 21Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). More recently it has been shown that HSPGs are an obligatory part of the FGF interaction with FGFRs(11Ornitz D.M. Leder P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16305-16311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Rapraeger A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 844-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Yayon et al. (23Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2073) Google Scholar) and Rapraeger et al. (24Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar) demonstrated that cells which express FGF receptors but lack heparan sulfates (HS) do not bind or respond to FGF-2. Exogenous heparin or HS restores the binding and mitogenic activity of FGF-2, strongly suggesting that an interaction between HS and either FGF or the high affinity FGFR is required to elicit a biological response. All four FGF receptors contain a stretch of basic amino acids between the first and second immunoglobulin loop which, in FGFR1, is proposed to form a heparin-binding site(25Kan M. Wang F. Xu J. Crabb J.W. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1918-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The homologous regions in each of the receptor types contain similar but uniquely different sequences rich in basic amino acids. These differences suggest a means by which cells might differentially activate receptors with unique HS domains. The site which binds FGF has been mapped to the variable C terminus of the third immunoglobulin loop (26Yayon A. Zimmer Y. Gou-Hong S. Avivi A. Yarden Y. Givol D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The dependence of FGF-receptor interactions on heparin has recently been questioned by Roghani and colleagues (27Roghani M. Mansukhani A. Dell'Era P. Bellosta P. Basilico C. Rifkin D.B. Moscatelli D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3976-3984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Roghani M. Moscatelli D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22156-22162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who demonstrated that heparin merely increased the binding affinity of FGF for FGFR in both myeloid and CHO cells, but was not required for it.We have recently shown that embryonic day 9 murine neuroepithelial cells are capable of releasing an HSPG which selectively binds FGF-2 through HS side chains and elicits a biological response to FGF-2(29Nurcombe V. Ford M.D. Wildschut J. Bartlett P.F. Science. 1993; 260: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). This HSPG appears to play a direct role in the interactions of FGF-1 and FGF-2 with responsive cells. Between embryonic days 9 and 11, the core protein of the HSPG is variably glycosylated with HS chains that switch their affinity from FGF-2 to FGF-1. The change in affinity of the HSPG from FGF-2 to FGF-1 also correlates very closely with the period when neuroepithelial cells begin to differentiate into a neuronal phenotype(30Murphy M. Drago J. Bartlett P.F. J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 25: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The aim of this present study was to determine whether HS chains bearing affinity for FGF-2 display selectivity for a receptor type and mitogenic response. Receptor isoforms present in the 2.3D cell line were detected with a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR). We show that even though FGF receptor 3 is present on the cells, the cells use FGF receptor 1 to transduce the FGF signal in the presence of an appropriate HS.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsPeptides were obtained from Chiron-Mimotopes (Clayton, Victoria, Australia). Bovine pituitary FGF-1 and FGF-2, sodium heparin from porcine intestinal mucosa (molecular mass = 12 kDa) and Pronase were from Sigma. Heparitinase (Flavobacterium heparinum) was from Calbiochem. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal calf serum were from Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (Parkville, Victoria, Australia). [3H]Thymidine and [3H]glucosamine was from Amersham Pty. Ltd. (Sydney, Australia). Culture plates were from Falcon LabWare (Becton Dickinson).Molecular Modeling of the FGFR1 Heparin-binding DomainThe structure of the second immunoglobulin loop in the FGFR1 (residues 152-230) which overlaps a predicted heparin-binding domain (25Kan M. Wang F. Xu J. Crabb J.W. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1918-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) was modeled on the known x-ray crystal structure of the CL subunit of Fab New(31Amzel L.M. Poljak R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 961-997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Poljak R.J. Amzel L.M. Avey H.P. Chen B.L. Phizackerley R.P. Saul F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 3305-3310Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The homologous amino acid residues in Fab New (protein data bank accession 3FAB) were mutated to the corresponding residues found in FGFR1 and the structure energy-minimized in vacuo using the MM+ force field with Hyperchem molecular modeling software (Hypercube, Waterloo, Canada).Purification and Chromatography of Heparan Sulfate Side ChainsIsolated [3H]glucosamine-labeled HS chains from the 2.3D neuroepithelial cell line were prepared from proteoglycan isolates by Pronase digestion as described previously(29Nurcombe V. Ford M.D. Wildschut J. Bartlett P.F. Science. 1993; 260: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). At each stage of the purification procedure, appropriate pools of analogous unlabeled material were collected and tested for their mitogenic ability to promote the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into 2.3D cells(30Murphy M. Drago J. Bartlett P.F. J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 25: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Side chains, which averaged 20 kDa in size(29Nurcombe V. Ford M.D. Wildschut J. Bartlett P.F. Science. 1993; 260: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), were further fractionated in denaturing solutions on the basis of their relative affinity for recombinant human FGF-2. The preparation of the FGF-2 affinity matrix and its running conditions were essentially as those described by Ishihara et al.(33Ishihara M. Tyrrell D.J. Stauber G.B. Brown S. Cousens L.S. Stack R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4675-4683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Preparation of FGF-2 Affinity MatrixHuman recombinant FGF-2 (5 mg) and N-acetylated heparin (20 mg) in 30 ml of coupling buffer (0.1 M NaHCO3, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 8.2) were added to 3 g of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The mixture was gently rocked overnight at 4°C, and the remaining active groups were blocked by the addition of 50 ml of 0.1 M Tris, pH 8.0. The FGF-2-coupled beads were then extensively washed with 2 M NaCl in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.3, 2 mM EDTA in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.3, and finally equilibrated with 0.2 M NaCl in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.3. The column was stored at 4°C in 0.2 M NaCl in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.3, supplemented with 0.02% azide and 100 μg/ml porcine heparin (Sigma).Affinity Chromatography of HSThe FGF-2-coupled Sepharose was packed into a small column (0.8 × 2 cm) and equilibrated with 0.2 M NaCl in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.3. The 3H-labeled HS chains (5 × 105 cpm) were dissolved in 100 μl of the equilibration buffer and loaded onto the small column, which was then washed with 3 ml of the same buffer. The bound fraction was eluted with 0.15 to 2 M linear gradients of NaCl (1 ml/min), reapplied to the column, eluted again with a linear NaCl gradient, and the bound fractions, pooled, desalted, and tested for mitogenic activity(33Ishihara M. Tyrrell D.J. Stauber G.B. Brown S. Cousens L.S. Stack R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4675-4683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Size-exclusion Chromatography of Bioactive HSAppropriate bioactive pools recovered from affinity chromatography were further analyzed by chromatography on Sepharose CL-6B (1 × 100 cm) according to our previously described methods(29Nurcombe V. Ford M.D. Wildschut J. Bartlett P.F. Science. 1993; 260: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Fractions were analyzed for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. The elution volume of peaks emerging from the column were calibrated against those of known glycosaminoglycan standards (molecular mass range from 1.3 to 50 kDa). Peaks of unlabeled material were tested in the mitogenic assay. In some cases, the material emerging from FGF-2 affinity chromatography was characterized by first incubating them for 16 h at 37°C with 2 units of Flavobacterium heparitinase, with 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0(34Kojima T. Leone C. Marchildon G. Marcum J. Rosenberg R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4859-4869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Highly mitogenic subpools were desalted, lyophilized, resuspended in water, and filtered through 0.22-μm cellulose acetate filters (Costar, Cambridge MA).Mitogenesis Assay2.3D cells were seeded at an initial density of 10,000 cells/well in 24-well tissue culture plates or 2,000 cells/96-well plate (Falcon) and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (29Nurcombe V. Ford M.D. Wildschut J. Bartlett P.F. Science. 1993; 260: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in the presence of FGF-2 or FGF-1 while HS was added 1 h after plating, and the peptides were added 2 h after plating. Dose-response curves generated with these reagents were completed according to our previously published methods(30Murphy M. Drago J. Bartlett P.F. J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 25: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The sequence of the FGF receptor-blocking peptides and their amino acid locations (in parentheses) within the complete receptor protein sequence were FGFR1 peptide(152-175): APYWTSPEKMEKKLHAVPAAKTVK (FGFR1-A22K), FGFR2 peptide(153-176): APYWTNTEKMEKRLHAVPAANTVK (FGFR2-A22K), FGFR3 peptide(150-173): APYWTRPERMDKKLLAVPAANTVR (FGFR3-A22R), and the FGFR4 peptide(146-169): APYWTHPQRMEKKLHAVPAGNTVR (FGFR4-A22R). A peptide homologous to an amino acid sequence in mouse Ca+2/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, LKKFNARRKLKGAILTTMLA(35Hanley R.M. Payne M.E. Cruzalequi F. Christenson M.A. Means A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3992Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), was used as a control peptide. Plating efficiencies were not affected by the presence of any of the peptides (data not shown). The treated 2.3D cells were grown for 24 h before the addition of [3H]thymidine(30Murphy M. Drago J. Bartlett P.F. J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 25: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). At the end of the incubation period, the cells were rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and then ruptured with lysis solution (3% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.02% (w/v) EDTA, and 0.02 M NH4OH). The lysis solution was collected in a 1.5-ml tube and levels of [3H]thymidine determined by liquid scintillation counting.RT-PCR Analysis of FGFR Expression in 2.3D CellsReverse primers specific for exons comprising the C-terminal half of Ig-like loop III in the various FGFRs were R1/4, R2/4, R3/4, and R4/4 for isoforms FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4 IIIc, respectively; R1/3 and R3/3 for isoforms FGFR1 and 3 IIIb, respectively; and also R1/2 in the case of exon a‘ of FGFR1. These primers were used as 3′ primers in combination with oligo(dT) to prime cDNA synthesis of mRNA isolated from the 2.3D cell line (see “Results”). The methodology for both cDNA synthesis and the subsequent PCR were as described in the RNA-PCR kit (Perkin-Elmer, Applied Biosystems, Melbourne Australia) and Nurcombe et al.(29Nurcombe V. Ford M.D. Wildschut J. Bartlett P.F. Science. 1993; 260: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The expression of various isoforms was assessed by a PCR assay wherein an isoform-specific primer pair and an isoform specifically primed cDNA template were present; e.g. to assess if FGFR1 IIIc was present, cDNA synthesis was primed with oligo(dT) and reverse primer R1/4, subsequent addition of the forward primer R1/1 followed with PCR for 30 cycles of 1′ at 95°C, 1′ at 60°C, and 1′ at 72°C resulted in the amplification of a specific FGFR1 IIIc fragment of 350 base pairs. Duplicate PCR assays of template from duplicate mRNA preparations were conducted in the manner described for all known isoforms of the FGFRs. The products diagnostic for these specific isoforms and the primer pairs for the PCR amplification of these products were as follows: FGFR1 IIIa‘, primer pairs R1/1 and R1/2; FGFR1 IIIb, R1/1 and R1/3; FGFR1 IIIc, R1/1 and R1/4; FGFR2 IIIc, R2/1 and R2/4; FGFR3 IIIb, R3/1 and R3/3; FGFR3 IIIc, R3/1 and R3/4; and FGFR4 IIIc, R4/1 and R4/4. The product sizes are given under “Results.” All oligonucleotides were subjected to EMBL and GenBank™ data base searches to ensure homology to a specific receptor. Primers were designed across introns to ensure that products of expected size were derived from mRNA only. PCR products were run on gels, Southern blotted, and hybridized with labeled oligonucleotides internal to the expected product, R1/5 for FGFR1 III, a‘, b, and c; R2/5 for FGFR2 III, b and c; R3/6 for FGFR3 IIIb; R3/7 for FGFR3 IIIc; and R4/7 for FGFR4 IIIc as described in Nurcombe et al.(29Nurcombe V. Ford M.D. Wildschut J. Bartlett P.F. Science. 1993; 260: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The products were also subcloned into pGem3zf (Promega), and both strands were sequenced to further verify identity.

Wang F. Xu J. Crabb J.W. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1918-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Despite considerable differences in their amino acid sequences, the secondary and tertiary structure of loop domains in members of the immunoglobulin superfamily are very similar (31Amzel L.M. Poljak R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 961-997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The final modeled structure of the second immunoglobulin loop domain of FGFR1 is presented in Fig. 1, A and B. The structure consists of six anti-parallel β-strands stabilized by a disulfide bond between cysteine 178 and cysteine 230. The loop domain comprises two regions, a hydrophobic domain containing the N-terminal portion of the immunoglobulin loop and a second region containing a cluster of basic lysine and histidine residues at positions 160, 163, 164, 166, 172, 201, and 225, all of which are orientated on the outer surface of the β-strands. All of the basic residues (with the exception of lysine 207 and arginine 209) were found within this basic domain. The maximum distance between any two positively charged groups in the basic cluster (i.e. N∈ of lysines 198 and 160) was 30 Å. A heparin hexasaccharide spans approximately the same distance (Fig. 1C). With this theoretical constraint in mind, we next set out to further characterize the interaction between the 2.3D HS and the FGFR with which it might be interacting, since the sequences in the four different FGF receptors in this region have quite distinct differences in their basic residues (see Fig. 1D), suggesting the possibility of unique binding sites for specific HS domains.Fractionation of FGF-2-specific HSHeparan sulfate side chains derived from the 2.3D HSPG were fractionated on an FGF-2 affinity column using continuous gradients of NaCl (Fig. 2A). About 30% of the initially loaded HS fragments were released at NaCl concentrations below 1.0 M. Approximately 70% of the initially loaded HS fragments were released in a single peak between 1.0 and 2.0 M NaCl, indicating that a significant fraction of the 2.3D HS possessed a high affinity for FGF-2. Fractions incorporating the peak were pooled for further analysis by molecular sieving over Sepharose CL-6B (Fig. 2B). The two large peaks emerging from this column could both be degraded almost to completion with Flavobacterium heparitinase, confirming their identity as true HS. The recovery of 3H-labeled material after affinity chromatography and then molecular sieving was approximately 45%. Dose-response curves generated with HS material from the peaks recovered after gel chromatography using the 2.3D neuroepithelial cell bioassay demonstrated that peak I, which averaged 18-20 kDa in size, but not peak II, was capable of maximally potentiating mitogenesis (Fig. 2C). When cells were grown in submaximal concentrations of FGF-2 (1 ng/ml), it was found that HS from peak I could maximally trigger cell division when it was present at concentrations above 1 μg/ml. From then on a concentration of 2 μg/ml of peak I HS was used in all cell cultures, unless otherwise indicated.Figure 2Purification of HS chains with specificity for FGF-2. A, [3H]glucosamine-labeled chains from 2.3D cell-conditioned medium were first purified over Q-Sepharose and then subjected to FGF-2 affinity chromatography. Bound saccharide was released with a linear NaCl gradient (0.15-2 M) and rerun over the column, and the fractions were released in the peak above 1 M (fractions 33-38, indicated by the arrow), and pooled for further analysis. B, pooled fractions were then chromatographed over Sepharose CL-6B columns, and the indicated fractions from the two peaks (I and II) were pooled. In some experiments the HS was predigested with Flavobacterium heparitinase (○). C, lyophilized HS material from peaks I and II of HS chains were then tested for their ability to promote mitogenesis in cultured 2.3D cells exposed to [3H]thymidine when they were grown in the presence of FGF-2 (1 ng/ml).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Dose Response of FGF-2Dose-response experiments to determine the optimum concentration of FGF-2 needed to perform subsequent peptide-blocking experiments were done. 2.3D cells were maintained in medium containing 2 μg/ml HS and exposed to increasing doses of FGF-2 (Fig. 3). Maximal activity was reached between 1 and 10 ng/ml FGF-2, with inhibition of growth seen at higher concentrations. Therefore, cells were maintained in 5 ng/ml FGF-2.Figure 3Dose response of cultured 2.3D cells grown in the presence of purified HS. 2.3D neuroepithelial cells were labeled with [3H]thymidine and maintained in the presence of purified HS (2 μg/ml).

Among various low molecular weight protease inhibitors examined, only a cysteine protease inhibitor (calpain inhibitor I, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal) blocked the down-regulation of nPKCε. Furthermore, the introduction of a synthetic calpastatin peptide, an exclusively specific inhibitor of calpain, into the cells also reduced the down-regulation, suggesting the involvement of calpain among all the intracellular cysteine proteases in this process. In accordance, we observed TRH-induced translocation of m-calpain from the cytosol to the membrane and the concomitant up-regulation of calpastatin isoforms; presumably, the former represents activation of the protease initiating the kinase degradation, while the latter constitutes a negative feedback system protecting the cells from activated calpain. These results suggest that in GH4C1 cells, TRH mobilizes both protease (m-calpain) and inhibitor (calpastatin) as a strictly regulating system for the nPKCε pathway mediating TRH signals.

The isozymes can be categorized into three groups: conventional PKC (cPKC), novel PKC (nPKC), and atypical PKC (aPKC), based on their structural and enzymatic properties(2Nishizuka Y.

We have focused our attention on the cellular function of PKC isozymes in the responses elicited by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), a hypothalamic hormone, in rat pituitary GH4C1 cells and demonstrated that nPKCε provides a major rate-limiting step in the secretion of prolactin (PRL) in response to agonist stimulation (5Akita Y.

GH4C1 cells possess at least six PKC isozymes, i.e. α and βII cPKC, δ, ε, and, η nPKC, and aPKC ζ(5Akita Y. Ohno S. Yajima Y. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Akita Y. Yamaguchi A. Saito T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), indicating a mediator role in stimulus-response coupling. In accordance, TRH induces the translocation of all isozymes except ζ from the cytosol to membranes(8Akita Y. Ohno S. Yajima Y. Konno Y. Saido T.C. Mizuno K. Chida K. Osada S. Kuroki T. Kawashima S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4653-4660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, only the ε isozyme undergoes subsequent down-regulation(5Akita Y. Ohno S. Yajima Y. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 7Kiley S. Schaap D. Parker P. Hsieh L. Jaken S. J. Biol.

Consistently, the introduction of an expression vector carrying nPKCε cDNA into the cells induces an increase in PRL secretion, whereas increasing the amount of other isozymes, α, βII, and δ, has no effect(8Akita Y. Ohno S. Yajima Y. Konno Y. Saido T.C. Mizuno K. Chida K. Osada S. Kuroki T. Kawashima S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4653-4660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that nPKCε among all the PKC isozymes present in GH4C1 cells plays a central role in the secretory process and that down-regulation following translocation is a hallmark for the thorough activation of the enzyme. Intracellular down-regulation of PKC following activation in general seems to involve facilitated proteolysis rather than transcriptional suppression(9Young S. Parker P.J. Ullrich A. Stabel S. Biochem. J. 1987; 244: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The protease(s) responsible for this process, however, have not yet been identified, although previous studies on phorbol ester-evoked cPKC down-regulation implies the involvement of calpain (10Adachi Y. Murachi T. Maki M. Ishii K. Hatanaka M. Biomed. Res. 1990; 11: 313-317Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 11Melloni E. Pontremoli S. Michetti M. Sacco O. Sparatore B. Horecker B.L. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1994; 223: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Consequently, the physiological significance of this down-regulation remains uncertain. Possibly, the proteolysis of PKC may produce a signal affecting the cellular situation. For instance, an active kinase fragment may be produced from PKC by limited proteolysis (15Kishimoto A. Kajikawa N. Shiota M. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1156-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as an intermediate product in down-regulation, depending on the protease involved. This kinase that acts independently of cofactors, including phospholipids, would phosphorylate substrates that may not be accessible to intact PKC. Alternatively, the loss of a specific PKC activity may lead to an alteration in cellular functions. Due to our limited knowledge about the mechanism of down-regulation, these possibilities remain obscure. In the present study, we aimed to elucidate the mechanism of selective nPKCε down-regulation in GH4C1 cells by identifying the responsible protease as an initial step in addressing these questions in this particular system. Leupeptin and casein were purchased from Microbial Research Institute and Merck, respectively. TRH was from Sigma. E-64d was generously provided by Dr. K. Hanada (Taisho Pharmaceuticals).

FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) were previously described. An anti-calpastatin antibody was raised against a synthetic 16-mer peptide, CTIELDLISWLCFSVL, conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Calibiochem) as described previously(16Saido T.C. Nagao S. Shiramine M. Tsukaguchi M. Sorimachi H. Murofushi H. Tsuchiya T. Ito H. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This sequence corresponds to the carboxyl-terminal portion of rat calpastatin(18Ishida S. Emori Y. Suzuki K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1088: 436-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A 27-mer synthetic calpastatin peptide (CS peptide, acetyl-DPMSSTYIEELGKREVTIPPKYRELLA-NH2) corresponding to the minimum inhibitory segment in domain I of human calpastatin (19Maki M. Bagci H.

Nagao S. Shiramine M. Tsukaguchi M. Sorimachi H. Murofushi H. Tsuchiya T. Ito H. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). A rhodamine-labeled CS peptide was produced as follows. An unacetylated CS peptide (25 μmol) on a resin prior to deprotection was incubated with 100 μmol of rhodamine isothiocyanate (Sigma) in 2 ml of dimethylformamide for 2 h at room temperature. The product was subjected to deprotection and purification as other peptides after extensive washing with the solvent. Rat pituitary GH4C1 cells were maintained in Ham's F-10 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 15% horse serum and 2.5% fetal bovine serum under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C as described(21Yajima Y. Akita Y. Saito T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 33: 592-597PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 3.0 × 106 cells were plated in 10-cm dishes and cultured for 5-7 days prior to use in each experiment. The cells were preincubated in F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 1 h prior to inhibitor treatment to minimize the influence of serum. The cells were then incubated in media containing protease inhibitors, synthetic peptides, or vehicle (0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide) for 1 h and stimulated with 200 nM TRH for 6 h unless stated otherwise in the figure legends. To examine down-regulation, cells were washed with ice-cold Mg2+-, Ca2+-free phosphate-buffered saline, collected in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis solubilization buffer, and subjected to Western blot analysis as described previously(16Saido T.C. Nagao S. Shiramine M. Tsukaguchi M. Sorimachi H. Murofushi H. Tsuchiya T. Ito H. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). A Fab fragment of donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to peroxidase (Amersham) was used as a secondary antibody. The blots were visualized using an ECL kit (Amersham). To examine the localization of nPKCε, cells were collected in homogenization buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mM sucrose, 2.5 mM EGTA, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 230 μM leupeptin, 2 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) and homogenized by sonication (Branson Sonifier 185, power 10, 15 s × 4 times) at 4°C. The homogenates were ultracentrifuged at 350,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatants and pellets were collected as cytosol and membrane fractions, respectively, and subjected to Western blot analysis as above. Calpain and calpastatin activities were assayed using 14C-succinyl-casein ([14C]casein) as follows. Cells (5-6 × 107 cells) collected in homogenization buffer were sonicated and ultracentrifuged as described above. The supernatant was applied to a Mono-Q column (volume, 1 ml) connected to a Pharmacia fast protein liquid chromatography system. The adsorbed proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0-0.5 M NaCl in 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, and 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. For calpain assay, aliquots (50 μl) of each fraction were incubated with 65 μg of [14C]casein (about 28,000 dpm) for 20 min at 30°C in 50 μl of reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM CaCl2, 25 mM 2-mercaptoethanol), and the trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter as described previously(22Nagao S. Saido T.C. Akita Y. Tsuchiya Y. Suzuki K. Kawashima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 1178-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The calpain activity was calibrated against known amounts of purified calpain and expressed in units as previously defined(23Ishiura S. Murofushi H. Suzuki K. Imahori K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1978; 84: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). For the assay of calpastatin, aliquots (25 μl) were heated at 100°C for 3 min and, after cooling, incubated for 40 min with 65 μg of [14C]casein and purified rabbit m-calpain (0.15 units) in 25 μl of reaction buffer. The ability to inhibit the exogenously added calpain activity was defined as calpastatin activity. To examine the localization of calpain, the cells were stimulated with TRH for various periods, harvested in Ca2+/EGTA buffer (pCa of 7, 20 mM Pipes/KOH, pH 7.2, 115 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 2.5 mM EGTA, 230 μM leupeptin, 2 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol), and fractionated as above. Cytosol and membrane fractions were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-calpain isozyme antibodies. The localization of calpastatin was examined in a similar manner except that “homogenization buffer” was employed instead of Ca2+/EGTA buffer. Upon stimulation of GH4C1 cells with TRH, the amount of nPKCε decreased indicating down-regulation (Fig. 1, lanes1 and 2), as previously reported (5Akita Y. Ohno S. Yajima Y. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 7Kiley S. Schaap D. Parker P. Hsieh L. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15704-15712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To identify the class of protease(s) involved in this catabolic process, we examined the effects of various protease inhibitors. Cells were preincubated with the protease inhibitors and subsequently stimulated with TRH (lanes3-10); only ALLNal, a cell-permeable cysteine protease inhibitor(24Sasaki T. Kishi M. Saito M. Tanaka T. Higuchi N. Kominami E. Katunuma N. Murachi T. J. Enzyme Inhibition. 1990; 3: 195-201Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar), blocked the down-regulation of nPKCε (lane9). Phosphoramidon, pepstatin, Nα-tosyl-L-lysyl chloromethyl ketone, N-tosyl-L-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone, leupeptin, and E-64d had no effect. O-Phenanthroline seemed to be toxic to cells at the concentration used, causing cell damage and resulting in the apparent promotion of down-regulation. These results indicate that a cysteine protease, not a metallo, serine, or aspartic protease, is involved in the down-regulation of nPKCε. Lysosomal cysteine proteases do not seem to be involved since leupeptin had no effect(25Barrett A.J. Salvesen G. Proteinase Inhibitors. Elsevier, Amsterdam1986: 55-298Google Scholar). We do not know why E-64d, another cell-permeable cysteine protease inhibitor, did not inhibit the down-regulation. We presume that it may have been quickly degraded extra- or intracellularly and failed to reach sufficient concentrations to be inhibitory in the cytoplasm. This is because E-64d needs to enter cells in the ester form and is then hydrolyzed by an intracellular esterase to yield E-64(26Shoji-Kasai Y. Senshu M. Iwashita S. Imahori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The effect of ALLNal was dose dependent (Fig. 2A). The concentration of inhibitor giving 50% inhibition was about 5 μM, consistent with previous studies(27Shenoy A.M. Brahmi Z. Cell Immunol. 1991; 138: 24-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 28Al Z. Cohen C.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The possibility that ALLNal influences the translocation of nPKCε from the cytosol to membranes that occurs prior to down-regulation was excluded because the inhibitor had no effect on the amount of nPKCε in the membrane fraction of TRH-treated cells (Fig. 2B). Besides the inhibitory effect of ALLNal, originally developed as a calpain inhibitor(24Sasaki T. Kishi M. Saito M. Tanaka T. Higuchi N. Kominami E. Katunuma N. Murachi T. J. Enzyme Inhibition. 1990; 3: 195-201Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar), on the down-regulation of nPKCε as shown above, the facts that TRH causes an elevation in intracellular calcium concentration (29Albert P.R. Tashjian Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15350-15363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that nPKCε is an in vitro substrate of calpain (30Saido T.C. Mizuno K. Konno Y. Osada S. Ohno S. Suzuki K. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 482-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) imply the possible involvement of calpain in this process. However, ALLNal may have affected other proteases present in the cell because it is not strictly specific for calpain(24Sasaki T. Kishi M. Saito M. Tanaka T. Higuchi N. Kominami E. Katunuma N. Murachi T. J. Enzyme Inhibition. 1990; 3: 195-201Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 31Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar). We therefore employed a more specific method to inhibit intracellular calpain activity using a synthetic CS peptide corresponding to the inhibitory segment of calpastatin (Fig. 3). A scramble peptide with an identical amino acid composition and a random sequence was employed as a negative control. We first examined the ability of the CS peptide to inhibit purified calpain activity and to permeate into cells. In test tubes, the CS peptide inhibited the proteolytic activity of purified calpain with high affinity; 50% inhibition was achieved at a peptide concentration of 20 nM (panelA). In contrast, approximately 103-fold more scramble peptide was necessary to suppress calpain activity. The permeability of the synthetic peptide into cells was confirmed using a rhodamine-labeled peptide (panelB); fluorescence was observed only in cells incubated with the peptide. Although this observation does not quantitate the actual concentration of CS peptide inside GH4C1 cells, it indicates that at least a fraction of the extracellularly administered CS peptide entered the cells and remained in cytoplasm. Confirming the potent inhibitory effect of the CS peptide on calpain and its cell permeability, we examined its effect on intact cells (panelC). The CS peptide significantly reduced the down-regulation of nPKCε, whereas the control scramble peptide had no effect. Because no proteases other than calpain have been shown to be inhibited by calpastatin or calpastatin peptide to our knowledge (32Crawford C. Mellgren R.L. Murachi T. Intracellular Calcium-dependent Proteolysis. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 75-89Google Scholar), these data suggest that it is indeed calpain, among various intracellular cysteine proteases, that is involved in the proteolytic process. Although the experiments using protease inhibitors indicated the involvement of calpain in the down-regulation of nPKCε in GH4C1 cells, previous studies have identified neither calpain nor calpastatin in either enzymatic or immunochemical terms in these cells. We therefore analyzed the calpain and calpastatin activities of GH4C1 cells by anion exchange HPLC (Fig. 4) since cellular calpain activities are measurable only after separation from calpastatin(33Goll E.D. Kleese W.C. Okitani K Kumamoto T. Cong J. Kapprell H.P. Mellgren R.L. Murachi T. Intracellular Calcium-dependent Proteolysis. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 3-24Google Scholar). The proteolytic activities eluted at the NaCl concentrations of 0.15 and 0.4 M were identified as μ-calpain and m-calpain, respectively (panelA), as indicated by Western blot analysis using human isozyme-specific antibodies (panelC). GH4C1 cells seem to have comparable μ- and m-calpain activities. These data, in turn, confirm that the antibodies employed are specific enough to distinguish between rat μ- and m-calpain. The activity to inhibit calpain (panelB) and the anti-calpastatin antibody immunoreactivity showing 100-110-kDa bands on Western blotting (panelC) eluted identically, i.e. at 0.25 M NaCl, confirming the specificity of the antibody. Notably, the calpastatin activity present in the cells exceeded the sum of the calpain activities, suggesting that the protease activity is regulated rather stringently in these cells as previously reported in KB cells(22Nagao S. Saido T.C. Akita Y. Tsuchiya Y. Suzuki K. Kawashima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 1178-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To obtain clues as to which of the calpain isozymes is involved in the down-regulation of nPKCε, we examined the effect of TRH on the cellular localization of μ- and m-calpains. We employed a Ca2+/EGTA buffer (pCa of 7) in fractionating the cytoplasm and membranes because the interaction of calpain with cell membranes depends on the Ca2+ concentration(34Ariyoshi H. Shiba E. Sakon M. Kambayashi J. Kawasaki T. Kang J. Kawashima S. Mori T. Biochem. Int. 1992; 27: 335-341PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, the amount of m-calpain in the membrane fraction increased within 1 h after stimulation, whereas the amount of μ-calpain remained essentially unchanged. This indicates that only m-calpain translocates from the cytosol to membranes in response to TRH treatment. TRH also induced alterations in the calpastatin levels of GH4C1 cells. The levels of both the cytoplasmic and membrane-associated calpastatin molecules increased gradually within 1 h (Fig. 6), and the increased levels were sustained for more than 12 h (data not shown). The amount of calpastatin increased by about 1.7-fold 1 h after stimulation as quantified by densitometry. In particular, the appearance of the high molecular form, indicated in Fig. 6 by the opentriangle, was notable (see “Discussion”). In the present study, we have shown that calpain inhibitors with broad and narrow specificities, ALLNal and CS peptide, inhibit the TRH-induced down-regulation of nPKCε in GH4C1 cells and that TRH causes both the translocation of m-calpain and an increase in the calpastatin level. These observations indicate that the calpain-calpastatin system is a component in TRH-induced signal transduction and that calpain is the major protease involved in down-regulation. This is the first demonstration of calpain involvement in PKC down-regulation associated with physiological stimulus-response coupling in contrast to previous studies employing phorbol ester or calcium ionophore to induce down-regulation(10Adachi Y. Murachi T. Maki M. Ishii K. Hatanaka M. Biomed. Res. 1990; 11: 313-317Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 11Melloni E. Pontremoli S. Michetti M. Sacco O. Sparatore B. Horecker B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4101-4105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present results, however, do not exclude the possible involvement of other intracellular proteases in down-regulation(12Chida K. Kato N. Kuroki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13013-13018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hashimoto E. Yamamura H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 106: 1041-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 14Junco M. Webster C. Crawford C. Bosca L. Parker P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Because the effect of the CS peptide was only partial (Fig. 3), a secondary protease other than calpain may participate in the proteolytic process; a candidate is proteasome, which was recently shown to be inhibited by ALLNal(31Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar, 35Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. Banik N. Wilk S. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1989-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The presence of a secondary protease is also implied by the fact that we do not observe an active nPKCε fragment corresponding to the catalytic fragment (Fig. 1) produced in vitro by calpain-catalyzed limited proteolysis(30Saido T.C. Mizuno K. Konno Y. Osada S. Ohno S. Suzuki K. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 482-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Apparently, degradation of the active fragment proceeds faster than its production, as shown previously in the case of cPKCα(36Shea T.B. Beermann M.L. Griffin W.R. Leli U. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Our observations also indicate that nPKCε, which is enzymatically independent of calcium (30Saido T.C. Mizuno K. Konno Y. Osada S. Ohno S. Suzuki K. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 482-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), could be regulated by the calcium signaling cascade through the proteolytic action of calpain. Whether or not proteolysis of nPKCε bears any specific physiological signals in these cells remains to be elucidated. The data showing the translocation of m-calpain, but not μ-calpain, from the cytosol to membranes in response to TRH treatment (Fig. 5) and suggesting the involvement of m-calpain in nPKCε down-regulation were rather unexpected because μ-calpain, which requires lower calcium concentrations for activation in vitro, has been considered as the more probable candidate for intracellular proteolytic phenomena (37Saido T.C. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 814-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). However, the present observation agrees with our previous reports, demonstrating that phorbol ester induces the synthesis and translocation of m-calpain in COS and K562 cells(38Hata A. Ohno S. Suzuki K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 39Nakamura M. Mori M. Morishita Y. Mori S. Kawashima S. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 200: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Possibly, the mobilization of m-calpain is controlled by the PKC pathway. It is therefore likely that in some cases, m-calpain is more involved in cellular stimulus-response coupling than μ-calpain. There may exist an unknown cellular factor associated with membranes that contributes to the specific activation of m-calpain. A possible reason for the selective down-regulation of nPKCε among other PKC isozymes (see the Introduction) may lie in the difference in the time course of translocation to membrane. In contrast to cPKCα and βII, which are translocated transiently and are rapidly dissociated from the membrane within 1 min (data not shown), the majority of nPKCε remains associated with the membrane in a more sustained manner favoring colocalization with m-calpain. Furthermore, this membrane association indicates that PKC exists under activating conditions, in which the kinase is more susceptible to proteolytic attack(15Kishimoto A. Kajikawa N. Shiota M. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1156-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Ohno S. Konno Y. Akita Y. Yano Y. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6296-6300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Presumably, other PKC isozymes escape from calpain action due to their relatively short periods of association with membranes. The up-regulation of calpastatin isoforms, particularly of the high molecular weight form in the membrane fraction, that is induced by TRH treatment (Fig. 6) seems to be part of the cellular negative feedback system counteracting activated calpain and protecting cellular components. Because the excessive and random degradation of proteins associated with membranes and the cytoskeleton would be highly toxic to cells and because the too rapid proteolysis of calpain substrates including nPKCε might interfere with cellular functions, the strict regulation of calpain activity by calpastatin should be vitally important. The three isoforms with different relative molecular weights probably represent different phosphorylation levels (41Adachi Y. Ishida-Takahashi A. Takahashi C. Takano E. Murachi T. Hatanaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3968-3972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or differential alternative splicing(42Lee W.J. Ma H. Takano E. Yang H.Q. Hatanaka M. Maki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8437-8442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); each isoform may possess distinct properties affecting cellular localization and interaction with calpain. Each might provide specific protection to a group of proteins that would otherwise be proteolyzed by calpain. Both qualitative and quantitative changes in calpastatin expression may play important roles, as shown for differentiation and secretion in other cells(43Oshima M. Koizumi S. Fujita K. Guroff G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20811-20816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Saito Y. Saido T.C. Sano K. Kawashima S.

The precise role of calpastatin in PRL secretion from GH4C1 cells remains to be elucidated. In conclusion, we propose that physiologically stimulated nPKCε is strictly regulated at the cell membrane by the calpain-calpastatin system. We are grateful to Drs. Y. Yajima, Y. Saito, and W.

We have examined the role of sphingomyelin hydrolysis to ceramide in the suppression of CYP2C11, a major constitutive form of cytochrome P450, by interleukin-1. Treatment of rat hepatocytes cultured on matrigel with interleukin-1β caused a rapid turnover of sphingomyelin and an increase in cellular ceramide, with no change in cellular phosphatidylcholine. The ceramide was composed mainly of a D-erythro-sphingosine backbone, suggesting that it was derived from sphingolipid hydrolysis rather than from increased de novo synthesis. Treatment of the cells with either N-acetyl-D-erythro-sphingosine (C2-ceramide) or bacterial sphingomyelinase suppressed the expression of CYP2C11 and induced the expression of the interleukin-1-responsive α1-acid glycoprotein mRNA. In contrast, the acute-phase gene β-fibrinogen, which is induced by interleukin-6 but not by interleukin-1, did not respond to C2-ceramide. N-Acetyl-D-erythro-sphinganine mimicked the effect of C2-ceramide on CYP2C11, but not on α1-acid glycoprotein expression. These results are consistent with a role for ceramide or a related sphingolipid in mediating the down-regulation of CYP2C11, the induction of α1-acid glycoprotein, and perhaps other cellular effects of interleukin-1 in hepatocytes.

INTRODUCTIONMany lines of evidence have indicated that the expression of genes involved in DNA replication is closely correlated with the proliferation state of cells and repressed in accordance with progression of differentiation in various tissues during development(1Matsukage A.

Cancer Res. 1994; 85: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In budding yeast, genes involved in DNA replication contain a common promoter element (MluI cell cycle box, 5′-ACGCGT)(3Lowndes N.F. Johnston A.L. Johnston L.H. Nature. 1991; 350: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and the specific transcription factor complex DSC1 (MBF) is required for expression at the G1-S boundary(4Dirick L. Moll T.

Gene Expr. 1995; 4: 95-109PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian E2F is a heterogeneous factor representing the combined activity of at least four gene products called E2F-1, E2F-2, E2F-3, and DP-1. E2F-1 and DP-1 associate into stable complexes and activate transcription in a cooperative manner(12Bandara L.R. Buck V.M. Zamanian M. Johnston L.H. La Thangue N.B.

The DRE-DREF system appears to play a key role in the differentiation-coupled repression of cell proliferation during embryogenesis(17Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2937-2942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, cDNAs for Drosophila homologs of E2F-1 and DP-1 have been recently cloned(18Ohtani K. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1603-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 19Dynlacht B.D. Brook A. Dembski M. Yenush L. Dyson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6359-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These two proteins interact with each other and cooperate to give sequence-specific DNA binding and optimal trans-activation(19Dynlacht B.D. Brook A. Dembski M. Yenush L. Dyson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6359-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Furthermore, multiple E2F recognition sites have been identified in the promoter of the Drosophila DNA polymerase α gene(18Ohtani K. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1603-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).To assess the possibility that the Drosophila PCNA gene might have E2F sites, as is the case with mammalian PCNA genes(11Lee H.-H. Chiang W.-H. Chiang S.-H. Liu Y.-C. Hwang J. Ng S.-Y. Gene Expr. 1995; 4: 95-109PubMed Google Scholar), we searched for sequences similar to those in the DNA polymerase α gene and found two such sequences within the PCNA promoter. We have detected a binding factor(s) to these sequences that has similar specificity to that of E2F. Furthermore, expression of E2F in Kc cells activated the PCNA promoter, and the target site for the activation coincided with the E2F sites. Analyses with transgenic flies indicate that the E2F sites are required for PCNA promoter function throughout Drosophila development.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESOligonucleotidesThe sequences of double-stranded oligonucleotides containing potential E2F sites or their base-substituted derivatives in the PCNA promoter were defined as follows.

A fragment from −86 to +57 having a base-substitutional mutation in E2F site I was generated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method (23Kawasaki E.S. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J.

The PCR product was digested with EcoRV(−80) and SacII (+23) and then replaced with the fragment between EcoRV and SacII sites of the p5′-168DPCNACAT to create the plasmid p5′-168E2FmutIDPCNACAT.

One or 0.5 μg of PCNA promoter-CAT plasmid as a reporter plasmid and 0.1 μg of pDhsp70-L as an internal control plasmid were cotransfected with the indicated amount of the effector plasmid. The total amount of effector plasmid was kept constant by the addition of the vector pAcGEM3(22Yamaguchi M. Hirose F. Nishida Y. Matsukage A. Mol. Cell.

Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1603-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) . Site 1 has been demonstrated to be the most effective for binding of Drosophila E2F(18Ohtani K. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1603-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). A search for E2F sites similar to those of the DNA polymerase α gene revealed two such sequences within the PCNA promoter. These sequences are located at positions −43 to −36 (site I) and −56 to −49 (site II) relative to the cap site (Fig. 1B). Nucleotide sequences of site I and site II, respectively, match seven out of eight and six out of eight nucleotides of the E2F site I in the DNA polymerase α promoter (18Ohtani K. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1603-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1).Figure 1Nucleotide sequences of potential E2F recognition sites in the Drosophila DNA polymerase α and PCNA genes. A, site I in the DNA polymerase α promoter contains an overlapping pair of E2F recognition sequences as indicated by horizontallines.

As shown in Fig. 2A, a DNA-protein complex was detected with the AdE2Fwt oligonucleotide containing the two E2F sites of the adenovirus E2 promoter (20Yee A.S. Raychaudhuri P. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) only when both GST-E2F and GST-DP lysates were mixed. Specificity of binding was evident in competition with wild type and mutant E2F sites from the E2 promoter (Fig. 2B, lanesa-d and q-s). E2F-P oligonucleotide (Fig. 1B) containing the two potential E2F sites of the PCNA promoter effectively competed for the binding (Fig. 2B, lanes e-g). The oligonucleotide E2F-PmutI carrying mutations in the E2F site I competed for the binding as effectively as the wild type E2F-P (Fig. 2B, lanesk-m). In contrast, the oligonucleotide E2F-PmutII carrying mutations in the site II much less efficiently competed for the binding (Fig. 2B, lanesn-p), and the oligonucleotide E2F-PmutI& carrying mutations in both sites did not compete at all (Fig. 2B, lanesh-j). Thus, the potential E2F sites of the PCNA promoter have high affinity for the complex of GST-E2F and GST-DP fusion proteins, and site II appears to play a major role in the binding.Figure 2Cooperative binding of E2F and DP to the oligonucleotide AdE2Fwt and competition by wild type and mutant E2F-P oligonucleotides.

As shown in Fig. 3A, a specific DNA-protein complex could be detected using an E2F-P oligonucleotide as a probe. The band shifted with 32P-labeled E2F-P was diminished by adding an excess amount of unlabeled E2F-P as a competitor but not by adding unrelated sequences of similar size such as DRE-P or DRE-PM (Fig. 3A, lanesa-d and k-q). The oligonucleotide containing the wild-type E2F site from the adenovirus E2 promoter (20Yee A.S. Raychaudhuri P. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) competed for the binding when added to the reaction in excess (Fig. 3A, lanesr-t). Similarly, oligonucleotides containing the E2F sites in the DNA polymerase α promoter (18Ohtani K. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1603-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) competed for the binding (Fig. 3A, lanese-j). In contrast, the oligonucleotide containing the mutant E2F site from the adenovirus E2 promoter did not compete under the examined conditions (Fig. 3A, lanesu-w). These results indicate that a binding factor(s) to the potential E2F sites in the PCNA promoter has binding specificity indistinguishable from that of Drosophila E2F(18Ohtani K. Nevins J.R. Mol.

Using several experimental approaches, we found that apoB is bound to the cytosolic chaperone protein, heat shock protein 72/73 (commonly referred to as Hsp70). Similar to other chaperone-protein interactions, this binding was transient and ATP-sensitive. The binding of apoB to Hsp70 in HepG2 cells was decreased by treatment with oleic acid, which increases both translocation and secretion of apoB, and was increased by N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal, a protease inhibitor which efficiently protects apoB from cellular degradation without affecting translocation. The N-terminal 16% of apoB, which is efficiently translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum lumen in stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, showed minimal, if any, binding to Hsp70. The N-terminal 50% of apoB, which is very poorly translocated in CHO cells, was found to bind significantly to Hsp70. These results suggest that domains of nascent apoB localized on the C-terminal regions of the molecule are transiently exposed to the cytosol during translation and/or translocation, and that Hsp70 functions as a molecular chaperone to maintain apoB in a translocational competent conformation until translocation is completed.

We show here that 77 base pairs 5′ of the transcription start site are sufficient for full serum inducibility of the mouse Zfp-36 promoter. This region of the promoter includes consensus sequences for the binding of the transcription factors EGR-1, AP2, and Sp1. In addition, we have identified a previously undescribed element, TTP promoter element 1 (TPE1); this 10-base pair sequence includes a palindrome and is identical in the human, bovine, and mouse genes. Each of the three binding elements, EGR-1, AP2, and TPE1, contribute to the serum induction of Zfp-36 and can confer serum-inducible expression on a heterologous minimal promoter. Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated the formation of complexes consisting of this region of the promoter and cellular nuclear proteins and demonstrated that the extent of complex formation could be altered by treatment of the cells with serum or insulin.

A Balb/c mouse genomic library (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was screened using the mouse TTP cDNA (1Lai W.S. Stumpo D.J. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol.

Restriction fragments from two clones overlapping within the intron and 1 kb of TTP protein coding sequence (clone 13 extended 5′, clone 7 extended 3′ from the overlapping sequence) were subcloned into pBS+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). An 8-kb SstI fragment from clone 13 was ligated into the SstI cloning site in pBS+, and another plasmid was made by ligating a 3-kb XhoI fragment from clone 7 into the SalI site of pBS+. The inclusion of the entire mRNA coding region was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. Five kb of 5′-flanking region was also sequenced. The entire mouse genomic sequence has been deposited in GenBank™ (accession number L42317). A second mouse genomic library (129 sv, Stratagene) was also screened to obtain a 3.8-kb Sau3aI-SalI fragment, which contained 0.9 kb of the 5′-flanking region, the entire mRNA coding sequence, and a single intron. DNA sequence analysis revealed only a 2-bp difference in the 5′-flanking region when compared with the clone from the Balb/c library.

Stumpo D.J. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16556-16563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Correct annealing was confirmed by comparing the sequence with that of a Sau3AI-SalI fragment of the 129sv genomic clone, which contains a 0.9-kb 5′-flanking region, the intron, and the entire mRNA coding sequence that includes the endogenous polyadenylation signal and three consensus sequences for mRNA instability(1Lai W.S. Stumpo D.J. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16556-16563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids TTP1.7kb and TTP137bp constructed in such a manner contained 1.7 kb and 77 bp, respectively, of 5′-flanking sequences. Intronless constructs TTP1.7kb-Int and TTP137bp-Int were made using a 1.7-kb EcoRV-NcoI or a 137-bp SstII-NcoI promoter fragment ligated to the NcoI site of the cDNA. In order to test potential promoter elements, Glo48TTP was constructed as follows. The mouse TTP cDNA was inserted into the EcoRI cloning site of pBS+, and a synthetic 48-mer double-stranded human β-globin promoter (9Humphries R.K. Ley T. Turner P. Moulton A.D. Nienhuis A.W. Cell. 1982; 30: 173-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) with XbaI and BamHI coherent termini was ligated 5′ to the TTP cDNA at the XbaI-BamHI site of the vector. Synthetic double-stranded serum response element (SRE, 5′-tcgacAGGATGTCCATATTAGG-3′; (10Treisman R. Cell. 1986; 46: 567-574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar)), EGR-1 (5′-tcgacGCGGGGGCG-3′; (11Cao X. Mahendran R. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16949-16957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), AP2 (5′-tcgacTCTAGTGGCCACGCCCCCAGGC-3′; (12Mitchell P.J. Wang C. Tijan R. Cell. 1987; 50: 847-861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar)), and TTP promoter element 1 (TPE1, 5′-tcgacCGTCCCGGAAGC-3′; this paper) DNA binding sequences with SalI coherent termini were ligated individually upstream of the minimal β-globin promoter at the SalI cloning site to create reporter constructs containing these elements. All insertions were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). Site-specific deletions or substitutions in the TTP upstream sequence of the TTP137bp construct were generated by using the Site-directed in vitro Mutagenesis System (Amersham Corp.). Deletion primers for each specific site are: dEGR-1, vector AAGCT(-79CCGCGGGGGCGCG)TCCCGGAAGCTCTAGTGG-49; dTPE1, -79CCGCGGGGGCG(CGTCCCGGAAGCTC)TACGTACCACGCCCCCAGG-36; dAP2, -58GAAGCTCTAGTGGCCTCG(CCCCC)AGGCCGCCCCATAAAAGG-19; dSP1, -52GTGGCCACGCCCCCAGG(CCGCCC)CATAAAAGGAGAAAGCTCCT-11; dTATA, -47CACGCCCCAGGCCGCCC(CATAAAAGG)AGAAAGCTCCTGCTG-7. Sequences in parenthesis were to be deleted. Additional site-directed mutations (underlined) were introduced for cloning purposes. All constructs were sequenced to confirm that the deletions and mutations had taken place. Primary embryonic chicken fibroblasts (CEF) were isolated by trypsinizing tissues (except for the internal organs and the head) of 11-14-day chicken embryos as described by Bergsma et al.(13Bergsma D.J.

HIR3.5 cells(15Whittaker J. Okamoto A.K. Thys R. Bell G.I. Steiner D.F. Hofmann C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5237-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), a generous gift from Dr. J. Whittaker (State University of New York, Stoney Brook, NY), were grown as described (16Levenson R.M. Nairn A.C. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11904-11911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transient transfections were performed with plasmid DNA in calcium-phosphate precipitates prepared in a transfection solution containing 140 mM NaCl, 25 mM HEPES, 0.12 mM CaCl2, and 0.75 mM sodium phosphate. CEF cells were plated 1 day before the transfection in 10-cm tissue culture dishes at a density of 3 × 106 cells/dish. After removing the culture medium, 1 ml of transfection mixture containing 15 μg of test plasmid and 5 μg of pXGH5 was added to each dish for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated at 37°C following the addition of 9 ml of culture medium. Four h after incubation with the plasmids, the cells were treated for 4 min with 4 ml of 10% glycerol in HEPES-buffered saline and washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline to remove the remaining precipitate. A 24-h incubation in complete culture medium followed to allow the transfected DNA to be expressed. The cells were then incubated for 24 h in medium containing 0.5% FBS to synchronize cells into quiescence and were harvested to prepare total cellular RNA. Plasmid pXGH5 encoding human growth hormone driven by the mouse metallothionein-1 promoter (17Searle P.F. Stuart G.W. Palmiter R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1480-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) was co-transfected as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Growth hormone released was measured by the HGH transient gene expression assay (Nichols Institute Diagnostics). HIR3.5 cells were plated at the density of 1 × 106 cells/dish and were transfected with 10 μg of test plasmid as described above. Total cellular RNA was prepared following the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (18Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63087) Google Scholar) with modifications by Xie and Rothblum (19Xie W.Q. Rothblum L.I. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 326-327Google Scholar). Northern blots were prepared as described before(1Lai W.S. Stumpo D.J. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16556-16563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were hybridized to random primed α-32P-labeled (Stratagene) mouse TTP cDNA, and the presence of TTP mRNA was quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Nuclear extracts from HIR 3.5 cells and CEF cells were prepared for gel mobility shift assays as described previously(20Thompson M.J. Roe M.W. Malik R.K. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21127-21135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μl of binding buffer (10 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol) containing 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and 20 × 103 cpm of α-32P-labeled probe, was added to 5-12 μg of nuclear protein (as indicated in the figure legends), diluted to 10 μl in nuclear extract buffer (20 mM Tris (pH 7.9), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mM NaF, 0.5 mM Na3Vo4), and then subjected to binding reactions and electrophoresis(20Thompson M.J. Roe M.W. Malik R.K. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21127-21135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The following synthetic oligonucleotides containing potential sequences for DNA binding factors were used in this study. For EGR1-AP2, two complementary synthetic oligonucleotides were annealed to form a double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to mouse Zfp-36 nucleotides −77 to −37. A 5-base single-stranded tail (SalI site) was included at the 5′ end, and a 6-bp double-stranded EcoRV site was included at the other. For TPE1, two complementary synthetic oligonucleotides were annealed to form a 22-bp double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to bases −68 to −55 of mouse Zfp-36, with cloning sequences for HindIII and SalI site at either end. To ensure sequence fidelity, each oligonucleotide pair was cloned into Bluescribe and sequenced. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were released by digesting the plasmid with appropriate restriction enzymes, and the ends were filled in with [α-32P]dCTP (DuPont NEN) and unlabeled dATP, dGTP, and dTTP (Life Technologies, Inc.). Unlabeled dCTP was subsequently added to the reaction. The labeled DNA was separated from unincorporated radioactivity and the cloning vector by acrylamide gel purification. Competitor fragments containing putative binding sequences for EGR-1 (tcgacGCGGGGGCG), AP2 (tcgaCCCCCAGGC), TPE1 (AGCTTCGTCCCGGAAGCTCG), and mutant TPE1(AGCTTCGTAACTTAAGCTCG) were made by annealing the complementary strands and filling in the ends with dNTPs using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. For convenience, we will refer to the 5′-flanking region of Zfp-36 as the “TTP promoter.” TTP promoter activity upstream of the translation start site was first tested by fusing 5-kb NcoI and 2.1-kb XhoI-NcoI fragments of the mouse genomic sequence to the human growth hormone gene, followed by assay of growth hormone (GH) released into the medium following transient transfection of the plasmids into HIR3.5 cells. Both the 5-kb and the 2.1-kb promoter sequences efficiently drove the expression of the GH gene (Fig. 1A). GH secretion from these constructs was 60-100-fold greater than that of the promoterless plasmid pØGH. Sequential deletions of 5′ sequences from the 2.1-kb promoter were then made to determine the minimal promoter length conferring full expression activity on the reporter construct. A 137-bp fragment (SstII-NcoI) containing only 77 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site was found to promote GH expression with similar effectiveness to the longer promoter constructs (Fig. 1B). These results suggested that this region of the TTP promoter contained the essential elements for high level expression under these experimental conditions. Both the GH mRNA and protein are stable when expressed in the cell lines we have tested. This fundamental difference with the very labile TTP mRNA (1Lai W.S. Stumpo D.J. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16556-16563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) made it difficult to measure the responsiveness of the TTP promoter to extracellular stimulation using the GH reporter system, since GH mRNA levels remained high even when the transfected cells were made quiescent by serum deprivation. A series of constructs containing the complete mouse Zfp-36 genomic sequence 3′ from the transcription start site and varying lengths of promoter was created (Fig. 2). We chose CEF cells to study the expression of transiently transfected mammalian Zfp-36 because the endogenous chicken TTP mRNA was not detectable by the mammalian TTP cDNA probes under the hybridization conditions used (see below). Mouse Zfp-36 expression in transfected CEF cells showed a time course of mRNA accumulation and degradation (data not shown) similar to that of the endogenous mouse mRNA in HIR3.5 cells(1Lai W.S. Stumpo D.J. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16556-16563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Truncation of the TTP promoter to 1.7 kb, 0.9 kb, or 137 bp resulted in no decrease in serum-induced mRNA expression (Fig. 2B). In addition, transfection of human ZFP-36 constructs containing 1.4-kb and 151-bp 5′ sequences resulted in similar patterns of serum-inducible expression (data not shown). From these findings, we concluded that the mouse TTP promoter sequences that are essential for serum responsiveness are located within a 137-bp region 5′ of the translation start site or 77 bp 5′ of the transcription initiation site. Computer analysis of the 137 bp 5′ of the translational start site revealed a consensus H2A (+46 to +51) binding sequence for the eukaryotic core histone dimer H2A-H2B(21Kerrigan L.A. Kadonaga J.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6673-6680Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 22Lopez-Rodas G. Brosch G. Georgiva E.I. Sendra R. Franco L. Loidl P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 317: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and a consensus c-fos.5 binding site (+52 to +59)(23Fisch T.M. Prywes R. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3490-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Neither the H2A site nor the c-fos.5 site were present in the human and bovine TTP sequences, and neither mutation of the putative H2A binding site (from CCATTC to GTCGAC) nor the putative c-fos.5 sequence (from GCGCCACC to GGTCGACC) affected either the basal or serum-stimulated expression of mouse TTP (data not shown). The human, bovine, and mouse sequences were highly conserved in the proximal 5′-flanking region (Fig. 3A). Sequence analysis revealed consensus motifs for several transcription factors in the 5′-proximal region of all three TTP promoters, including sites for the TATA binding protein and Sp1 binding protein (Fig. 3A). Deletion of these sites from the mouse construct containing the 137-bp 5′-proximal sequence produced a predictable inhibition of TTP mRNA expression (Fig. 3B). Consensus sequences for the binding of transcription factors EGR-1 (11Cao X. Mahendran R. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16949-16957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and AP2 (12Mitchell P.J. Wang C. Tijan R. Cell. 1987; 50: 847-861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 24Williams T. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 670-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) were also found in the proximal promoter region of the three animal species (Fig. 3A). To assess the contribution of the EGR-1 and AP2 elements to the induction of TTP by serum, deletion of each of these elements was made in the mouse TTP construct containing the 137-bp 5′-proximal sequence. The effects of these deletion mutations on serum induction of TTP mRNA expression by these plasmids were measured in starved CEF cells after transient transfection. Deletion of either of the two elements resulted in a reduced level of TTP mRNA accumulation induced by serum. Serum-stimulated TTP mRNA expression in cells expressing the deleted EGR-1 or AP2 constructs was decreased to 35 and 18%, respectively, of the wild-type level (Fig. 3C). TTP mRNA expression from constructs lacking the TTP intron was also greatly attenuated when compared with the corresponding constructs containing the same length of 5′ sequence (Fig. 3, B and C). Full expression of human and bovine TTP constructs also required the presence of the intron (data not shown). The relationship between the promoter and the intron in the expression of Zfp-36 is not understood at present; these potential interactions are the subject of ongoing experimentation and will not be discussed further here. Analysis of promoter sequences in this region also revealed a previously undescribed 10-bp sequence, TPE1, that was identical in the promoters of all three animal species (Fig. 3A). When this region was deleted from the mouse construct containing 137 bp of 5′ DNA sequence, serum-induced TTP expression was decreased by 75% (Fig. 4A). In order to rule out the possibility that the diminished expression was due to nonspecific effects resulting from a shortened construct, we created a site-specific mutation at the palindromic sequence of TPE1 from TCCCGGA to TAACTTA. Serum-induced expression of the substitution mutant construct was decreased to a similar extent as that of the deletion mutant (Fig. 4A). Mutation of the same 4 bp also had profound effects on the expression of TTP from longer constructs containing 1.7 kb or 0.9 kb of promoter sequence (Fig. 4B, Table 1, Group 1), indicating that this palindrome is one of the key sites for the activation of the TTP gene during serum stimulation.Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab The above results suggest that the EGR-1, TPE1, and AP2 elements within the first 77 bp upstream of the mouse TTP transcription start site all contribute to transcriptional activation of Zfp-36 by serum in CEF cells (Table 1, Group 2). Since deletion or mutation of each single element reduced, but did not abolish, serum-induced expression, we examined whether any of these elements was able to impart serum-responsiveness to a minimal promoter. We therefore constructed plasmids containing a single copy of EGR-1, AP2, or TPE1 5′ of a hybrid insert, Glo48TTP. This hybrid insert was constructed of a 48-mer 5′-flanking sequence from the human β-globin gene and the mouse TTP cDNA. Function of this minimal human β-globin promoter has only been observed in vectors that include an enhancer element(9Humphries R.K. Ley T. Turner P. Moulton A.D. Nienhuis A.W. Cell. 1982; 30: 173-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 25Moschonas N. de B.E. Grosveld F.G. Dahl H.H. Wright S. Shewmaker C.K. Flavell R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 4391-4401Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The 5′ 48-mer only contained a TATA box and no other promoter elements. We did not include the TTP intron in these plasmids because this intron may also contain enhancer activities (Fig. 3, B and C). A plasmid with the c-fos SRE sequence inserted 5′ to Glo48TTP served as a positive control, since the SRE has been demonstrated to be sufficient for the induction by serum in heterologous constructs(10Treisman R. Cell. 1986; 46: 567-574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Using transient transfection in CEF cells, we tested the ability of these putative elements, EGR-1, TPE1 and AP2, to confer serum responsiveness on the silent human β-globin promoter. The expression of Glo48TTP plasmids containing each of the test sequences was induced by serum as compared with the plasmid lacking these sequences (Fig. 5), both in the presence and absence of cycloheximide. In addition, the presence of all three putative enhancer elements together resulted in a 1.5-fold increase in expression compared with the sum of expression from each element individually (Fig. 5). Finally, the reverse orientation of the TPE1 element resulted in a similar increase in serum-induced expression to that of the forward construct (data not shown). Our transient transfection analysis of the 77-bp minimal TTP promoter identified three DNA elements that contribute to its serum responsiveness other than the intron and general factor binding sites such as the TATA box. These include two known DNA-protein binding motifs (EGR-1 and AP2) as well as a previously undescribed element (TPE1), all of which are highly conserved in three mammalian species (Fig. 3A). To determine if nuclear proteins could associate with these elements, we performed DNA mobility shift analyses using nuclear extracts from both serum- or insulin-treated and quiescent cells. When a radiolabeled probe (EGR1-AP2) containing the EGR-1, TPE1, and AP2 elements was used in gel shift assays, four major protein-probe complexes were identified (Fig. 6A). One of these complexes (C4) showed a reproducible decrease in intensity following 10 min of treatment of the cells with insulin or serum, whereas complexes C1 and C2 increased following insulin or serum stimulation. Double-stranded oligonucleotides encoding the individual EGR-1, TPE1, and AP2 sites were then used as competitors in gel shift assays with the EGR1-AP2 probe. No specific DNA-protein complex was displaced by the EGR-1 oligonucleotide (not shown). The top three complexes (C1, C2, and C3) were decreased in the presence of the AP2 competitor, although higher concentrations of the AP2 competitor were required to completely abolished C3. The TPE1 competitor oligonucleotide specifically abolished C4. We also observed that the intensity of C1 and C2 increased when C4 was competed by the TPE1 oligonucleotide competitor. Wild-type and mutant TPE1 double-stranded oligonucleotides were next radiolabeled for use as probes in gel shift assays. Nuclear extracts from both serum-treated and control cells produced a single DNA-protein complex with the wild-type TPE1 probe, which corresponded in eletrophoretic mobility to complex C4 seen with the EGR1-AP2 probe. As with the EGR1-AP2 probe, formation of this complex was decreased in extracts from serum-treated cells. A mutant ΔTPE1 oligonucleotide competitor containing base changes from TCCCGGA to TAACTTA had no effect on formation of the TPE1 complex (Fig. 6B). The mutant ΔTPE1 oligonucleotide probe was also directly radiolabeled and shown to be unable to form this complex (Fig. 6C). These results suggested that the TPE1 element was recognized by one or more specific nuclear proteins. The small but consistent decrease in the intensity of the TPE1 complex following serum treatment, seen with both the EGR1-AP2 (C4) and the TPE1-specific probe, suggests that serum treatment might modify these binding proteins in such a way as to decrease their binding to the TPE1 element. Similar decreases in intensity of complex C4 were seen when HIR3.5 cells were treated with either insulin (70 nM) (Fig. 6A) or PMA (1.6 μM) (not shown) for 10 min. These studies establish that the first 77 bp 5′ upstream of the transcriptional start site are sufficient for maximal serum induction of the mouse TTP gene (Zfp-36) when expressed in CEF cells; deletions 3′ of this point dramatically decrease serum inducibility of this gene. Within this minimal effective promoter, we have also identified several putative transcription factor binding sites in the mouse TTP promoter, all of which are present in the human and bovine genes. The presence of each is necessary for the full, serum-inducible expression of the gene. Finally, we have identified binding proteins in cell nuclear extracts that bind specifically to some of these DNA motifs and whose binding is altered by prior treatment of the cells with mitogens. These studies have begun to evaluate the mechanisms by which serum and other mitogens rapidly and dramatically stimulate the transcription of this immediate-early response gene. One conserved transcription factor binding site identified in the present study is the Sp1 site, located at −35 to −30 5′ of the transcription start site in the mouse promoter. Sp1 is a well characterized zinc finger-containing transcription factor, which enhances transcription by RNA polymerase II from promoters that contain at least one properly positioned GGGCGG hexanucleotide (for review, see (26Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 20-23Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (877) Google Scholar)). Sp1 has been shown to regulate transcription of certain proto-oncogenes (27Ishii S. Kadonaga J.T. Tjian R. Brady J.N. Merlino G.T. Pastan I. Science. 1986; 232: 1410-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 28Unlap T. Franklin C.C. Wagner F. Kraft A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and growth factor genes(29Geiser A.G. Busam K.J. Kim S.J. Lafyatis R. O'Reilly M.A. Webbink R. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 129: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). When the consensus binding sequence for Sp1 was deleted from the TTP137bp plasmid, an 80% decrease in TTP expression resulted, indicating that the TTP promoter is Sp1-responsive (Fig. 4B); however, we have not demonstrated directly that Sp1 binds to its hexanucleotide binding site in the TTP promoter. The TTP promoter construct with the Sp1 site deleted remained serum-responsive but to a lesser extent than the wild-type construct, implicating other promoter elements in the serum-induced expression of TTP mRNA. EGR-1 is another zinc finger-containing transcription factor, also known as NGF1-A(30Milbrandt J. Science. 1987; 238: 797-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar), KROX24(31Lemaire P. Revelant O. Bravo R. Charnay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4691-4695Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), TIS-8(4Lim R.W. Varnum B.C. Herschman H.R. Oncogene. 1987; 1: 263-270PubMed Google Scholar), and Zif268(32Lau L.F. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1182-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). It binds to a GC-rich consensus sequence, GCGGGGGCG, that is found in the 5′-flanking regions of many genes involved in cell growth such as proto-oncogenes and genes encoding mitogens and mitogen receptors. Several immediate-early response genes also have EGR-1 binding sites in their promoters(33Lemaire P. Vesque C. Schmitt J. Stunnenberg H. Frank R. Charnay P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3456-3467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of the EGR-1 binding sequence from the TTP promoter decreased its serum-stimulated expression by 65%. Although we found no direct evidence of EGR-1 binding to the TTP promoter in our gel shift assays, our deletional analysis indicates that EGR-1 may contribute to the regulation of TTP expression. The AP2 consensus binding sequence GCCNNNGGC (34Williams T. Admon A. Luscher B. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 1557-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) is present in the minimal effective promoter of TTP from all three animal species tested. This sequence, when bound by AP2 homodimers, has been identified as a control element for several viral and cellular genes(24Williams T. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 670-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 34Williams T. Admon A. Luscher B. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 1557-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). AP2 mediates regulation of gene expression in response to a number of different signal transduction pathways(35Luscher B. Mitchell P.J. Williams T. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 1507-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The activity of AP2 is increased in response to treatment of cells with phorbol esters and agents that elevate cAMP levels(34Williams T. Admon A. Luscher B. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 1557-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 35Luscher B. Mitchell P.J. Williams T. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 1507-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 36Imagawa M. Chiu R. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 51: 251-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). When the AP2 consensus sequence in the mouse TTP promoter was deleted, induction of TTP expression by serum was decreased by 72%. We have previously shown that PMA could induce TTP expression(1Lai W.S. Stumpo D.J. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16556-16563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), making it possible that the AP2 binding site was involved in PMA-induced TTP expression. However, when the AP2 binding sequence was deleted from the TTP137bp construct, PMA still induced TTP expression to a similar extent as the serum-induced response (data not shown). These results indicate that the PMA-stimulated TTP expression does not depend solely upon the consensus AP2 binding sequence in the TTP promoter. We also identified a previously undescribed promoter element at −66 to −60 5′ of the cap site in the mouse gene that we have called TPE1. It contains a palindromic element with dyad symmetry, TCC(C/G)GGA. It is perfectly conserved in the TTP promoter from all three animal species we have studied. Deletion or mutation of this element led to a 75% decrease in serum-induced TTP expression. Mutation of the TPE1 palindrome also severely impaired serum responsiveness of the TTP promoter when introduced into longer promoter constructs. Both orientations of the TPE1 element could also confer serum responsiveness to the silent promoter Glo48, indicating that this element behaves as a transcriptional enhancer. The TPE1 palindrome also appears to represent a binding site for a nuclear protein, as demonstrated by gel shift analysis. Mutations within the palindrome that impaired serum responsiveness of the promoter also abolished binding of this nuclear protein. In addition, nuclear extracts from cells stimulated with serum or other mitogens for 10 min showed a small but consistent decrease in band intensity in the gel shift assays. This suggests, but does not prove, that the TPE1 element binding protein is a target of the signaling cascade responsible for serum induction of the TTP promoter. We have located consensus TPE1 binding sites in the promoters of a number of genes, including c-ha-ras1(27Ishii S. Kadonaga J.T. Tjian R. Brady J.N. Merlino G.T. Pastan I. Science. 1986; 232: 1410-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), mdm2(37Juven T. Barak Y. Zauberman A. George D.L. Oren M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3411-3416PubMed Google Scholar), and fosb(38Lazo P.S. Dorfman K. Noguchi T. Mattei M.G. Bravo R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). fosb is induced by serum with early response gene characteristics. It will be interesting to investigate the possibility that this motif is involved in the regulated expression of these and other genes. Because the serum-responsive region in the TTP promoter contains multiple potential promoter elements, it is likely that a number of nuclear proteins interact in its regulation. The DNA mobility shift assay using the EGR1-AP2 probe provides evidence to suggest that several proteins interact with the −77 to −35 sequence to mediate the serum response. We observed small but consistent changes in the intensity of a number of protein-DNA complexes using nuclear extracts from serum-treated and control cells. Serum-induced transcriptional activation of TTP is likely to result from post-transcriptional modification of pre-existing nuclear protein complexes, since TTP gene transcription is very rapidly stimulated by insulin or serum, even when cells have been pretreated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide(1Lai W.S. Stumpo D.J. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16556-16563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Post-transcriptional modification of such factors following serum treatment could result in changes in the affinity of these factors for their DNA binding sites. Isolation and characterization of the TPE1 protein should lead to a better understanding of the transcription factor interactions that are involved in the regulation of TTP expression. Our results suggest cooperative interactions among nuclear proteins binding to closely positioned cis-acting elements in the TTP promoter. For example, the EGR-1, TPE1, and AP2 elements from the TTP promoter each conferred only low levels of serum-inducible expression of β-globin-TTP hybrid constructs, but together they produced greater than additive expression. The gel mobility shift data also suggest the possibility of cooperative interactions among several transcription factors; for example, there was a reciprocal increase in the binding of nuclear proteins to the AP2 binding site and decreased protein binding to the TPE1 site. Finally, the presence of the single intron in the TTP gene markedly enhanced serum induction of the gene; we suspect this is due to enhanced transcription, although we cannot exclude effects of the intron on processing or stability of the mRNA(39Dreyfuss G. Swanson M.S. Pinol-Roma S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 86-91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Further experimentation will be necessary to determine whether the intron and/or proteins that bind to it interact in some way with the other serum-responsive elements of the TTP promoter.

Brefeldin A plus nocodazole completely blocked apoB degradation suggesting the involvement of a post-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) compartment. Monensin inhibited apoB degradation by 40% implying that a post-Golgi compartment could be involved in degradation of apoB. Ammonium chloride or chloroquine inhibited partially the degradation of apoB100 and apoB48, indicating some degradation in lysosomes, or in an acidic compartment such as trans-Golgi or endosomes. The degradations of apoB100 and apoB48 were blocked completely by (2S,3S)-trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-3-methylbutane ethyl ester (EST) during a chase of 90 min demonstrating that a cysteine protease was responsible for apoB degradation. Chymostatin, leupeptin, pepstatin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and aprotinin had no significant effect on the degradation of apoB48. However, leupeptin and pepstatin decreased the degradation of apoB100 by 20-30%. Degradation of apoB100 and apoB48 occurred in isolated Golgi fractions with little degradation in heavy or light ER. Degradation of apoB in Golgi fractions was inhibited by EST and by preincubating hepatocytes with 10 nM dexamethasone. Immunofluorescent microscopy revealed that apoB accumulated in the Golgi region after EST treatment. It is concluded that a major part of apoB degradation in rat hepatocytes occurs in a post-ER compartment via the action of a cysteine protease that is regulated by glucocorticoids.

Apolipoprotein B (apoB) plays a central role in the assembly, secretion, and metabolism of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins (chylomicrons and VLDL) 1The abbreviations used are: VLDLvery low density lipoproteinALLNN-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinalBSAbovine serum albuminERendoplasmic reticulumEST(2S,3S)-trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-3-methylbutane ethyl esterIgimmunoglobulinPBSphosphate-buffered saline. and LDL (1Chan L.

There are two forms of apoB in mammals: the larger molecular weight form, apoB100, consists of 4536 amino acids, whereas the smaller form, apoB48, is the amino-terminal 48% of apoB100. Both apoB100 and apoB48 are products of the same gene. ApoB48 mRNA is produced from apoB100 mRNA mainly in the intestine by RNA editing which involves a cytidine deaminase(2Powell L.M. Wallis S.C.

ApoB is synthesized on polyribosomes bound to the cytoplasmic surface of the ER and then translocates into ER lumen. ApoB translocation has been suggested to involve specific multiple pause-transfer sequences that temporarily arrest the translocation process(6Chuck S.L. Yao Z. Blackhart B.D. McCarthy B.J.

Pulse-chase studies suggest that a significant proportion of the apoB synthesized de novo in rat hepatocytes is degraded intracellularly(17Borchardt R.A. Davis R.A. J. Biol.

Intracellular degradation of apoB has also been observed in HepG2 cells(20Sato R. Imanaka T. Takatsuki A. Takano T. J. Biol.

Treatment of HepG2 cells with oleate increases apoB secretion by decreasing apoB degradation (22Dixon J.L. Furukawa S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8854-8862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, glucocorticoids (dexamethasone) stimulate the secretion (25Martin-Sanz P. Vance J.E. Brindley D.N. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and decrease apoB degradation(26Wang C.-N. McLeod R.S. Yao Z. Brindley D.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1481-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Some studies demonstrated that intracellular degradation of apoB in HepG2 cells occurred in a pre-Golgi compartment (20Sato R.

However, considerable differences exist in the control of apoB metabolism and secretion in HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes. Despite evidence implicating the existence of intracellular apoB degradation in rat hepatocytes(17Borchardt R.A. Davis R.A. J. Biol.

Biol. 1995; 15: 1481-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), little is known about the pathway responsible for apoB degradation. In the present study, we investigated the site(s) of degradation of nascent apoB in cultured rat hepatocytes and have characterized the nature of protease for apoB degradation. We used brefeldin A and monensin, inhibitors of protein transport in the secretory pathway, and nocodazole, which inhibits retrograde transport from Golgi to ER in order to identify the location of nascent apoB degradation in whole cells. A cell-free assay system was developed to assess the degradation of labeled apoB in isolated subcellular fractions. The results demonstrate that a major portion of the intracellular degradation of newly synthesized apoB occurs in a post-ER compartment, possibly the Golgi apparatus. A cysteine protease is responsible for this apoB degradation, and this protease activity is decreased by pretreating hepatocytes with dexamethasone. Sheep polyclonal antibodies for human apoB, fluorescein-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit IgG antibodies, UDP-galactose, trypsin, trypsin inhibitor, chymostatin, pepstatin, and leupeptin were from Boehringer Mannheim. Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Brefeldin A, nocodazole, monensin, EST, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, mannose 6-phosphate, p-nitrophenyl phosphate, puromycin, and fatty acid-poor BSA were from Sigma. All reagents for electrophoresis were from Bio-Rad Laboratories. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were from Millipore. Leibovitz L-15 medium, methionine-cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and fetal bovine serum were from Life Technologies, Inc. UDP-[3H]galactose was purchased from DuPont NEN. [35S]Methionine, the enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents, and conjugated anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase for immunoblotting were obtained from Amersham. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against rat albumin for immunoprecipitation were purchased from Organon Teknika Inc. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against rat apoB were provided by Dr. G. F. Gibbons (University of Oxford, United Kingdom). These anti-apoB antibodies were immunopurified for the histochemical studies by using apoB100 and apoB48 which were immobilized on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane(28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Nolan C. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16-18Google Scholar). Anti-rat albumin antibody for Western blot analysis was a gift from Dr. D. E. Vance (University of Alberta). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma or Fisher Scientific. Hepatocytes were prepared from male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-300 g) by collagenase perfusion and then cultured as described previously(25Martin-Sanz P. Vance J.E. Brindley D.N. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 29Cascales C. Mangiapane E.H. Brindley D.N. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 911-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Approximately 8 × 105 cells were plated onto collagen-coated culture dishes (35-mm) in modified Leibovitz L-15 medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 4 μg of choline chloride/liter. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37°C, after which the unattached and nonviable cells were removed. Adherent hepatocytes were incubated for an additional 3 h in the same medium after which the cells were ready for subcellular fractionation or [35S] methionine labeling. Otherwise, cells were changed to Leibovitz L-15 medium containing 0.2% (w/v) fatty acid-poor BSA and incubated overnight. After culturing overnight, hepatocytes were washed twice with methionine-cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (labeling medium) and incubated for 40 min in the same medium to deplete the intracellular methionine pool. In studies of apoB degradation, hepatocytes were pulse-labeled for 15 min in 0.75 ml of labeling medium containing 300 μCi of [35S]methionine. In some conditions, the cells were preincubated with protease inhibitors for 1 h before labeling. After labeling, the medium was removed and the cells were washed twice with Leibovitz L-15 medium containing 10 mML-methionine and 3 mML-cysteine (chase medium). One ml of control chase medium, or chase medium containing reagents (protein transport inhibitors, lysosomotropic agents, or protease inhibitors), was added and the cells were incubated at 37°C for the time indicated. Both cells and medium were recovered for analysis. Maximum incorporations of [35S]methionine into apoB were attained between 10 and 20 min after finishing the pulse labeling(26Wang C.-N. McLeod R.S. Yao Z. Brindley D.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1481-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, the percentage of relative recovery of labeled apoB from cells and medium was calculated relative to this maximum incorporation of [35S]methionine. Hepatocytes cultured in Leibovitz L-15 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 4 h or 0.2% BSA overnight were labeled with [35S]methionine for 40 min as described above. Control hepatocytes or labeled hepatocytes were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, then harvested in homogenization buffer (37.5 mM Tris, pH 6.5, 0.5 M sucrose, 1% dextran, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin). The hepatocytes were homogenized by 40 strokes with a tight-fitting Teflon pestle at 0°C. The subcellular fractions (heavy ER, ERI; light ER, ERII; and Golgi) were isolated according to the method of Croze and Morré (30Croze E.M. Morré D.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1984; 119: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) as modified by Hamilton et al.(31Hamilton R.L. Moorehouse A. Havel R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 529-543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to decrease endosomal contamination of the Golgi fraction. The ERI fraction was isolated from the final sucrose step gradient at the interface between 1.5 M and 2.0 M sucrose solution. ERII fraction was isolated from the interface between 1.3 M and 1.5 M sucrose solution. The isolated fractions were assayed for NADPH:cytochrome c reductase (ER marker enzyme) (32Mahler H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1955; 2: 553-559Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar), UDPgalactose:N-acetylglucosamine galactosyltransferase (Golgi marker enzyme)(33Bergeron J.J.M. Ehrenreich J.H. Siekevitz P.

Subcellular fractions (Golgi, 100 μg of protein; ERI, ERII, 400 μg) were suspended in 10 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.25 M sucrose. A solution of L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin was added to the fraction suspension at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml trypsin(9Rusinõl A.E. Chan E.Y.W. Vance J.E.

Chem. 1990; 265: 10005-10011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min, after which proteolysis was terminated by adding 0.1 volume of 4 mg of soybean trypsin inhibitor/ml. Trypsin was removed by centrifugation at 90,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. ApoB and albumin were analyzed by Western blot analysis. Microsomal fractions were diluted 50-fold with 100 mM sodium carbonate (pH 11.5) and incubated on ice for 30 min(35Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Samples were then centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1 h to separate membrane and luminal content. Membrane pellets and luminal contents, which had been concentrated by using an Amicon concentrator, were subjected to Western blot analysis. Subcellular fractions were prepared from [35S]methionine-labeled hepatocytes and resuspended in 0.375 M sucrose. Half-volumes of 0.4 M sodium potassium phosphate (pH 6.8) containing 8 mM dithiothreitol were added to the fractions which were then incubated at 40°C for 3 h(36Barrett A.J. Kembhavi A.A. Brown M.A. Kirschke H. Knight C.G. Tamai M. Hanada K. Biochem. J. 1982; 201: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). The control fraction was incubated at 0°C for 3 h. In the case of EST, fractions were preincubated on ice for 30 min with this inhibitor before transferring to 40°C and incubating for another 3 h. The radioactivities associated with apoB and albumin were immunoprecipitated and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The percentage degradation of apoB at 40°C relative to that at 0°C was determined by scanning densitometry. Hepatocytes were plated on polylysine-coated coverslips and cultured overnight in Leibovitz medium containing 0.2% (w/v) fatty acid-poor BSA. Cells were treated with 100 μM puromycin in the presence or absence of 40 μg/ml EST for 2 h. Hepatocytes were washed twice with PBS and then fixed with methanol at −20°C for 10 min followed by acetone at −20°C for 5 min. Coverslips were washed with PBS to remove residual methanol or acetone. Fixed samples were incubated with PBS with 5% non-fat dried milk powder (w/v) containing affinity-purified rabbit anti-rat apoB antibodies at 4°C overnight. Other samples were incubated with mouse anti-Bip (binding protein, stressgen), rabbit anti-α-mannosidase II(37Moreman K.W. Touster O. Robbins P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16876-16885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or rabbit anti-lgp120 (38Dunn W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1923-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) antibodies at 37°C for 1 h to visualize ER, Golgi cisternae, and lysosomes, respectively. For double staining, the incubation of anti-apoB antibodies was followed by an incubation of mouse anti-Bip antibodies, mouse anti-α-mannosidase II antibodies(39Burke B. Griffiths G. Reggio H. Louvard D. Warren G. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 1621-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), or antibody 4E4.A6 (a monoclonal antibody that colocalizes with the lysosomal marker, lgp120, in NRK cells) 2T. C. Hobman and L. C. Hendricks, unpublished results. at 37°C for 1 h. Samples were washed with PBS four times, then incubated with secondary antibodies, which were fluorescein-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit IgG antibodies or Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies, at 37°C for 1 h. After washing with PBS, the coverslips were examined by using a fluorescent microscope. Protein mass was determined according to the method of Lowry et al.(40Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using BSA as the standard. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting of apoB and albumin were performed as described previously(26Wang C.-N. McLeod R.S. Yao Z. Brindley D.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1481-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 41Yao Z. Blackhart B.D. Linton M.F. Taylor S.M. Young S.G. McCarthy B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3300-3308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Multiple exposures of the Western blots were performed and quantitated within the linear range of the film. The densitometric changes reflected the mass of apoB100, apoB48, and albumin as verified by multiple dilutions of the samples. Differences within a 10-fold range could be detected at a single exposure. The integrity of the microsomal membrane was assessed by measuring mannose-6-phosphate phosphohydrolase activity(42Arion W.J. Ballas L.M. Lange A.J. Wallin B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 4901-4907Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Degradation of total cell protein was monitored by the increase of acid-soluble radioactivity from radiolabeled cells and medium(43Grinde B. Seglen P.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 632: 73-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as means ± S.D. for the number of independent experiments indicated. Rat hepatocytes were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 15 min and then chased for 2 h in the presence or absence of protein transport inhibitors. The maximum incorporation of [35S] methionine into apoB48, which occurred at 10 min into the chase period, was about twice that into apoB100 (6652 ± 734 dpm/mg of cell protein compared to 3467 ± 400 dpm/mg of cell protein) as expected from our previous work(26Wang C.-N. McLeod R.S. Yao Z. Brindley D.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1481-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The recoveries of apoB100 and apoB48 from cells plus medium after a chase of 2 h were 53 ± 5.2% and 70 ± 12% compared to the maximum incorporation, respectively, when no inhibitors were added (Fig. 1) reflecting the intracelluar degradation of apoB (17Borchardt R.A.

Brefeldin A and monensin were used to elucidate whether protein transport from ER to Golgi is necessary for apoB degradation in rat hepatocytes. Brefeldin A is a fungal metabolite that causes disassembly of the Golgi apparatus by inhibiting vesicle transport from ER to Golgi, thereby blocking protein secretion(44Misumi Y. Misumi Y. Miki K. Takatsuki A. Tamura G. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11398-11403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Fujiwara T. Oda K. Yotota S. Takatsuki A. Ikehara Y. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1989; 48: 250-263PubMed Google Scholar), blocks the retrograde transport of vesicles from the Golgi to ER. Therefore, treatment with brefeldin A plus nocodazole prevents mixing of ER and Golgi and maintains secretory proteins in the ER compartment. Monensin is a sodium/potassium/proton ionophore that disrupts the ion gradient in trans-Golgi and retains secretory proteins in this network thereby blocking protein secretion(48Tartakoff A.M. Cell. 1983; 32: 1026-1028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 49Griffiths G. Quinn P. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 835-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Treatment with brefeldin A plus nocodazole or monensin blocked the secretion of apoB and albumin by more than 95%. Treatment with brefeldin A plus nocodazole also inhibited completely the degradation of apoB100 and apoB48 (Fig. 1). This result is compatible with the hypothesis that the transport of apoB from ER to Golgi is necessary for apoB degradation in rat hepatocytes. Treatment with monensin only decreased degradation of apoB100 and apoB48 by about 40% after the 120-min chase. The effect of monensin on apoB100 degradation was more prominent than for apoB48 at earlier chase periods. The result from monensin treatment indicated that some newly synthesized apoB may be degraded in a post-Golgi compartment. Ammonium chloride and chloroquine were used to examine whether acid proteases could be involved in apoB degradation. Hepatocytes were labeled with [35S]methionine for 15 min and then chased for 2 h in medium supplemented with a lysosomotropic agent. Intracellular degradation in control cells was 49% and 30% for apoB100 and apoB48, respectively. Ammonium chloride and chloroquine decreased the degradation of labeled apoB100 by 45% and 57%, respectively. The equivalent values for apoB48 were 17% and 53%, respectively (Table 1). This result indicated that a portion of newly synthesized apoB could be degraded in an acidic compartment such as lysosomes, trans-Golgi or endosomes.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Seven protease inhibitors were employed to determine the nature of the enzyme responsible for apoB degradation. Cells were pretreated with protease inhibitor (except EST) for 1 h before labeling to allow time for interaction with the cells. The percentage recovery of labeled apoB from cell and medium was measured at the 2-h chase point compared to the peak of 35S incorporation at 10 min into the chase (Table 1). Leupeptin (a serine and cysteine protease inhibitor) and pepstatin (an aspartic protease inhibitor) inhibited intracellular degradation of apoB100 by about 20-30%, but has no effect on apoB48 degradation. No significant inhibition of apoB degradation was observed with chymostatin (inhibitor of chymotrypsin and papain), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and aprotinin (serine protease inhibitors). The penetrations of leupeptin, chymostatin, and pepstatin into hepatocytes were confirmed by the inhibition of total cell protein degradation which was determined by the increase of acid-soluble radioactivity from cell and medium during the 2-h chase. The percentage inhibition of total protein degradation was 34 ± 11%, 47 ± 11%, and 47 ± 8% (n = 3) with leupeptin, chymostatin, and pepstatin, respectively. Previous studies showed that apoB degradation was blocked by ALLN (cysteine protease inhibitor) in HepG2 cells(50Sakata N. Wu X. Dixon J.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22967-22970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our hepatocyte system, we were not able to observe a reproducible inhibition of apoB degradation by ALLN. We used, therefore, an alternative cysteine protease inhibitor, EST, to investigate apoB degradation since this agent is more readily permeable to membranes and therefore better able to enter cell compartments. A preincubation with EST seemed not to be required. EST inhibited the intracellular degradation of both apoB100 and apoB48 by 50% after 2 h (Table 1) and blocked apoB degradation completely during the first 90 min of the chase (Fig. 2). Therefore, a cysteine protease was responsible for most of the degradation of apoB100 and apoB48 in this hepatocytes system. It is possible that the action of EST on the cysteine proteases, cathepsin L and cathepsin B, within lysosomes may account for some of the inhibition of apoB degradation. To investigate this possibility, the labeled apoB that remained in the hepatocytes or was secreted into medium was measured from cells which were treated with ammonium chloride plus EST. The recovery of apoB from cells treated with EST plus 20 mM ammonium chloride was higher than cells treated with either EST, or ammonium chloride alone. The additive effect of EST and ammonium chloride on apoB degradation suggests that EST exerts its effect on apoB degradation mainly in a nonlysosomal compartment. The results from the experiments with the protein traffic inhibitors indicated that a major site of intracellular degradation of apoB is a post-ER compartment possibly in Golgi. We therefore isolated subcellular fractions from cultured hepatocytes in order to investigate this possibility. Three fractions were purified: ERI (heavy ER), ERII (light ER), and Golgi. The purities of subcellular fractions were assessed by using NADPH:cytochrome c reductase and UDP-galactose galactosyltransferase and acid phosphatase as marker for ER, Golgi, and lysosome, respectively (Table 2). The cross-contamination of Golgi by the ER marker enzyme was about 10% by calculat"

However, it is not clear that these are CD45's sole functions. For example, new evidence suggests that CD45 can also dephosphorylate certain PTK substrates, such as the TCR ζ chain (8Furakawa T.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4002-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), the function of the CD45 extracellular domain in lymphocyte signal transduction remains a major unresolved issue. In humans, five CD45 isoforms, ranging in size from 180-220 kDa, are generated by the regulated alternative mRNA splicing of three exons, encoded by a single gene(14Streuli M. Hall L.R. Saga Y. Schlossman S.F. Saito H. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 166: 1548-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 15Ralph S.J. Thomas M.L. Morton C.C. Trowbridge I.S.

The alternatively spliced exons, commonly referred to as A, B, and C, are located near the 5′ end of the gene and give rise to isoforms that differ only in their extracellular regions. Individual lymphocytes simultaneously express more than one CD45 isoform(17Rudd C.E. Morimoto C. Wong L.L. Schlossman S.F. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 166: 1758-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 18Rothstein D.M. Sohen S. Daley J.F. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. Cell Immunol. 1990; 129: 449-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, the expression of certain isoforms is highly regulated, resulting in their differential expression on lymphocytes of different lineage (e.g. T versus B cells), as well as on distinct functional subsets of T cells(19Rothstein D.M. Saito H. Streuli M. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7139-7147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Tedder T.F. Clement L.T. Cooper M.D. J.

Furthermore, individual T cells alter their isoform expression in a highly regulated manner during thymic selection and upon antigen exposure in the periphery(18Rothstein D.M. Sohen S. Daley J.F.

The tight regulation of CD45 isoform expression by lymphocytes having distinct functions argues that these differences are likely to be of biologic importance. However, attempts to study the role of individual CD45 isoforms in signaling have been severely hampered by great difficulty in re-expressing different single intact CD45 isoforms into the same cellular background. Recent studies have clearly demonstrated that TCR-mediated signaling can be reconstituted in CD45- mutants by transfection of chimeric molecules containing the conserved PTPase domains, but lacking the CD45 transmembrane or extracellular regions (11Volarevic S.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4002-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, these results do not exclude a potentially important role for the CD45 extracellular domain, since the various extracellular domains could superimpose distinct regulatory constraints upon the cytoplasmic domain. Our present findings strongly support this hypothesis. Utilizing a unique model system, we now demonstrate that the expression of different individual CD45 isoforms is associated with differences in IL-2 production, as well as differences in the activation-related phosphorylation of cellular proteins including Vav. These findings demonstrate the preferential utilization of different signaling pathways by distinct CD45 isoforms. A 270-base pair segment (from the P1 transcription initiation site to the initiation codon) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from genomic CD45 DNA (clone LCA.512, from Dr. H. Saito, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA(16Hall L.R. Streuli M. Schlossman S.F. Saito H. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2781-2787PubMed Google Scholar)). Polymerase chain reaction primers incorporating unique restriction sites allowed ligation into the RcSRα plasmid vector (27Tanaka T. Kameoka J. Yaron A. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. Proc. Natl. Acad.

To generate CD45 cDNA constructs in the sense orientation, the pSPSRα LCA.1 and LCA.6 constructs(28Streuli M. Morimoto C. Schrieber M. Schlossman S.F. Saito H. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 3910-3914PubMed Google Scholar), encoding the smallest, CD45R(0), and largest, CD45R(ABC), isoforms, respectively (from Dr. M. Streuli, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute), were modified by removing a 5′ SacI-SphI segment, to reduce overlap between AS-CD45 and these CD45 cDNAs to 40 base pairs. The Jurkat human leukemic CD4+ T cell line was maintained in RPMI 1640 media containing 10% fetal calf serum, 4 mML-glutamine, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin at 37°C in humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Cells were transfected by electroporation, and G418-resistant colonies were screened for loss of CD45 by immunofluorescence. Two of the CD4+CD45- clones (J-AS-1 and J-AS-2) were selected for further study. J-AS-1 was co-transfected at a 10:1 ratio with cDNA constructs for either the CD45R(0) or CD45R(ABC) isoform plus the pPGKhyg plasmid (29te Riele H. Maandag E.R. Clarke A. Hooper M. Berns A.

Resistant colonies (G418 and Hygromycin) were screened by immunofluorescence for CD45 expression as well as for expression of appropriate cell surface markers described below. Clones were sorted (fluorescence activated cell sorting) as necessary to obtain similar CD45 and CD4 expression, as described below. Immunofluorescence analysis was performed as described previously(26Rothstein D.M. Yamada A. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 1175-1183PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse anti-human mAbs reactive with CD2, CD3, CD4, CD28, CD45, and CD45RA were obtained as ascites (generously provided by Dr. Chikao Morimoto, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute) or as phycoerythrin conjugates (from Coulter Immunology, Hialeah, FL), anti-CD45RO (obtained with the kind permission of Dr. Peter Beverly, University College Hospital, London), and goat anti-mouse IgG-FITC (from Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL). Cell phenotype was routinely monitored for these markers using a BD FACSTAR IV (10,000 cells/sample). Cell sorting was performed using a BD FACSTAR IV, after staining by direct or indirect immunofluorescence, as described(26Rothstein D.M. Yamada A. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. J.

Rabbit polyclonal Ab to Vav was developed by immunization of rabbits with a synthetic peptide containing residues 575-594 of (murine) Vav. Immunoprecipitation of a 95-kDa band with the antiserum was specifically blocked by addition of the immunizing peptide to the lysate mixture (data not shown). 105 cells/well in triplicate flat bottom 96-well tissue culture plates were stimulated with anti-CD3 (purified OKT3) at the concentrations indicated, essentially as described(27Tanaka T.

Cross-linking was performed with goat anti-mouse (GAM) (at a 1:1 ratio with anti-CD3). For anti-CD3 × anti-CD28 cross-linking, anti-CD3 (1 μg/ml) and anti-CD28 (1:400 dilution of ascites) were cross-linked with GAM (2 μg/ml). PMA (1 ng/ml) was added to all wells as described(30Koretzky G.A. Picus J. Schultz T. Weiss A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

IL-2 units were determined in each assay by comparison to a standard curve using human rIL-2 (generously supplied by Chiron Corp., Emeryville, CA). The data were normalized to the response of Jurkat cells at maximal anti-CD3 (1 μg/ml) in each experiment. 100% response averaged 40-70 units/ml (see Fig. 2 legend). For whole cell lysates, 3 × 106 cell aliquots were prewarmed to 37°C and then treated for the indicated time periods with prewarmed goat anti-mouse (GAM) alone (unstimulated control), or anti-CD3 (30 μg/ml) plus GAM (7.5 μg/ml) (stimulated), as described(31Rothstein D.M. da Silva A.

For analysis of Vav tyrosine phosphorylation, 15 × 106 cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 for 1 min at 37°C, as described above. Unstimulated controls were treated with anti-CD3 after addition of lysis buffer. At the appropriate times, an excess of ice-cold stop solution (phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mM EDTA and phosphatase inhibitors) was added, followed immediately by brief centrifugation in a Microfuge, removal of the supernatant, and resuspension of the pellets in ice cold lysis buffer (described below). Cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) with 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mM iodoacetamide, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 10 mM NaF, and 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, for 20 min at 4°C, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min, as described(31Rothstein D.M. da Silva A.

For experiments using whole cell lysates, postnuclear supernatants were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer and loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels. For analysis of CD45 isoform expression, (1-2 × 106 cell eq for Jurkat and 5 × 106 for transfectants) were run on 6% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with anti-CD45 (GAP 8.3, ATCC). For analysis of tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins, 3 × 106 cell eq/lane were lysed before or after stimulation as above, and postnuclear supernatants separated on 10% SDS-PAGE (nonreducing conditions). Following transfer to nitrocellulose, membranes were blocked with 5% milk in phosphate-buffered saline and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-Tyr(P)) (mAb 4G10 generously provided by Dr. Brian Drucker, Oregon Health Sciences Center, Portland, OR).

Protein concentration was determined using the micro-BCA protein assay kit (Pierce), and equivalent amounts of protein in precleared lysates were incubated with anti-Vav antisera, followed by immunoprecipitation with Protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Immunoprecipitates were washed five times with lysis buffer, boiled in sample buffer, and separated on 8% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. After transfer to nitrocellulose, blots were blocked as above and then probed with anti-Tyr(P) (4G10), as described (31Rothstein D.M. da Silva A. Sugita K. Yamamoto M. Prasad K.V. Morimoto C.

All immunoblots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary reagents and developed using ECL (Amersham). Like peripheral T cells, the Jurkat human T cell leukemia line normally expresses CD45 at high levels, and individual cells express multiple isoforms simultaneously(17Rudd C.E. Morimoto C. Wong L.L.

To examine the role of CD45 and its individual isoforms, free from the potential confounding influences of unknown mutations, we directly targeted endogenous CD45 expression by stable transfection of a plasmid construct (AS-CD45) expressing an antisense RNA directed at a 270-base pair region of genomic CD45 just upstream from the coding region. (Fig. 1A). Of the several independent CD45- colonies selected and subcloned, two, denoted J-AS-1 and J-AS-2, were selected on the basis of CD4 expression comparable to that of parental Jurkat. (Fig. 1B). Jurkat expresses high levels of total CD45 and lower levels of both the smallest CD45 isoform (CD45RO) and the largest (two) isoforms which contain exon A (CD45RA). J-AS-1 and −2 lack detectable CD45 expression either on the surface or in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1, B and C). J-AS-1 was then stably transfected with CD45 cDNA constructs modified to minimize overlap with AS-CD45 antisense RNA and encoding either the smallest isoform, denoted CD45(0), lacking alternative exons, or the largest isoform, denoted CD45(ABC), which includes all three alternative exons. These isoforms best exemplify differential distribution on T cell subsets having distinct functions and activation preferences(19Rothstein D.M. Saito H. Streuli M. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. J.

Each of the CD45+ clones arising expressed solely the transfected CD45 isoform by both immunofluorescence and by immunoblotting. (Fig. 1, B and C). Three independent CD45(ABC) transfected isolates (J[ABC]-1, −2, and −3) and two CD45(0) transfected isolates (J[0]-1 and −2) were selected for further study, based on CD45 expression and wild-type levels of CD3. The clones were then sorted to obtain stable populations expressing similar levels of CD4 and CD45. When matched for their surface expression, J[0] and J[ABC] clones expressed identical levels of CD45 by immunoblotting, indicating no inherent differences in the relative distribution of intracellular and extracellular CD45 (data not shown). Although total CD45 expression was lower in the transfectants, the expression of individual CD45(0) and CD45(ABC) isoforms by J[0] and J[ABC] cells, respectively, was similar to their expression in wild-type cells. The expression of CD3, CD2, and CD28 was nearly identical in each of the cell lines (Fig. 1B and data not shown). Current evidence indicates that CD45 regulates the activity of proximal components of the signaling apparatus such as the Src family PTKs, Lck and Fyn, and, presumably, their substrates(3Mustelin T.

First, TCR/CD3-induced IL-2 secretion, which depends on the coordinated activation of multiple transcription factors(34Ullman K.S. Nothrop J.P. Verweij C.L. Crabtree G.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 421-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), was examined as an integrated measure of such signaling events. The dose-response curve to anti-CD3 (Fig. 2A) reveals that, in contrast to Jurkat, the CD45- (J-AS) cell lines secreted minimal IL-2 in response to all doses of anti-CD3 tested. Furthermore, no enhancement was seen after co-stimulation by cross-linking anti-CD3 and anti-CD4 (data not shown). Reconstitution with the CD45(0) isoform resulted in wild-type levels of IL-2 secretion after stimulation with anti-CD3 (1.0 μg/ml). In contrast, the CD45(ABC) transfected cell lines produced significantly less IL-2 than either Jurkat or the CD45(0) transfectants at both 0.05 and 1.0 μg/ml anti-CD3, secreting at maximum, 30% of wild-type levels. Increasing the anti-CD3 dose to 5 μg/ml had no additional effect on IL-2 secretion by any of the cell lines (data not shown). However, at lower doses of anti-CD3 (0.005 μg/ml), transfectants expressing either individual isoform secrete much less IL-2 than Jurkat, possibly owing to the lower levels of overall CD45 expression. Stimulation with anti-CD2 gave overall results similar to those observed above (not shown). Similar responses by J-AS-1 and each of its single isoform-reconstituted derivatives after stimulation by Ab-mediated cross-linking of CD3 and CD28 (Fig. 2B), or with PMA plus ionomycin (Fig. 2C), documents similar inherent capacity of each cell line to secrete IL-2 when the proximal signaling machinery, or the requirement for CD45(30Koretzky G.A. Picus J. Schultz T. Weiss A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2037-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), are bypassed, respectively. Thus, after stimulation with anti-CD3 (at 0.05 to 1 μg/ml), IL-2 secretion by J[0] transfectants is not significantly different from wild-type cells, despite 6-7-fold lower CD45 expression. Nonetheless, it is possible that decreased IL-2 secretion by J[ABC] cells compared to J[0] cells is due to their somewhat lower levels of CD45 expression. To rule out this possibility, we sorted J[ABC] clones to obtain CD45 expression equal to that of J[0] cells and then compared IL-2 secretion by these cell populations after anti-CD3 stimulation (see Fig. 3). As before, clones expressing CD45(0) secrete wild-type levels of IL-2. As shown, increased CD45 expression by J[ABC] transfectants did not augment IL-2 secretion. Both sorted and unsorted J[ABC] populations averaged just 24% of the wild-type levels of IL-2. Given differential anti-CD3-induced IL-2 secretion by these cell lines, more proximal signaling events were next examined. Comparison of Lck and Fyn activities by immune complex kinase assays failed to reveal isoform-dependent differences (data not shown). T cell activation is associated with alterations in the tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of cellular proteins. Therefore, we compared the tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins in each cell line before, and at various time points after, anti-CD3 stimulation (Fig. 4). Under basal conditions, J-AS-1 consistently revealed hyperphosphorylation of a limited set of bands at ~70-76 kDa and decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of several other bands (~105, ~95, and ~50-52 kDa) when compared to Jurkat (Fig. 4A). After anti-CD3 stimulation of Jurkat, there was rapid phosphorylation (peaking at 30 s to 1 min) and subsequent dephosphorylation of a number of bands. Although many of the same bands were ultimately phosphorylated (within 5-10 min) after stimulation of J-AS-1 cells, the kinetics were significantly slowed. Furthermore, once phosphorylated, these bands did not undergo dephosphorylation, consistent with decreased action of the CD45 PTPase and perhaps of other cellular PTPases whose activities depend on regulated tyrosine phosphorylation (35, 36). Re-expression of either the CD45(0) or the CD45(ABC) isoforms generally restored basal and activation-related tyrosine phosphorylation, although the kinetics were somewhat prolonged compared to wild-type Jurkat (Fig. 4B). This may reflect the lower overall levels of CD45 expression in these cells. More importantly, direct comparison reveals clear isoform-dependent differences in the relative phosphorylation of several bands. For example, J[ABC] cells consistently exhibited relative hyperphosphorylation of a band at ~95 kDa when compared to J[0] cells. This prompted a comparison in our cells of the tyrosine phosphorylation of p95Vav (Vav) which is rapidly and transiently phosphorylated on tyrosine after ligation of the TCR(33Gulbins E. Coggeshall K.M. Baier G. Katzav S. Burn P. Altman A. Science. 1993; 260: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 37Bustelo X. Barbacid M. Science. 1992; 256: 1196-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), CD28(38August A. Gobson S. Kawakami Y. Mills G. Dupont B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. 1993; 294: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). While the exact function of this proto-oncogene product in signal transduction is unclear, gene ablation studies document the important role of Vav in the activation and proliferation of mature lymphocytes as well as in the normal developmental expansion of lymphocyte precursors in the marrow and thymus(40Fischer K.-D. Zmuldzinas A. Gardner S. Barbacid M. Bernstein A. Guidos C. Nature. 1995; 374: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 41Zhang R. Alt F.W. Davidson L. Orkin S.H. Swat W. Nature. 1995; 374: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Basal Vav tyrosine phosphorylation was minimal but detectable in each of our cell lines (Fig. 5A). Anti-CD3 stimulation consistently induced significantly greater tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav within 1 min, in Jurkat and particularly in all three J[ABC] transfectants compared to either of the two J[0] transfectants or the CD45- J-AS-1 cells. Reprobing the same membrane with anti-Vav antisera confirmed similar loading of Vav protein in each lane (Fig. 5B). These differences are not secondary to altered kinetics, since the same pattern is observed 4 min after anti-CD3 stimulation, at which time phosphorylation of Vav in Jurkat and single-isoform transfectants is decreasing (data not shown and (33Gulbins E. Coggeshall K.M. Baier G. Katzav S. Burn P. Altman A. Science. 1993; 260: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar)). Our results are the first to demonstrate that signaling pathways utilized by the TCR are differentially regulated by the extracellular domain of distinct CD45 isoforms. Stimulation of the TCR leads to the phosphorylation of a number of cellular proteins including Vav. Although the signaling pathways involving Vav have not yet been clarified, Vav contains an array of signaling and DNA-binding motifs, including SH2 and SH3 domains, a Dbl domain, and a helix-loop-helix, which all appear to be involved in the generation of downstream signals (33Gulbins E. Coggeshall K.M. Baier G. Katzav S. Burn P. Altman A. Science. 1993; 260: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 42Bustelo X. Suen K.-L. Leftheris K. Meyers C.A. Barbacid M.

Biol. 1994; 14: 6848-6857Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Activation-related tyrosine phosphorylation directs SH2-mediated interactions between Vav and several other signaling molecules. Thus, Vav has been shown to associate with Shc, Grb2, ZAP-70, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p85), CD19, VAP-1, and several other uncharacterized bands through SH2 and/or SH3-mediated interactions after activation of B or T lymphocytes(37Bustelo X.

Chem. 1994; 269: 32514-32521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). How different CD45 isoforms might regulate this pathway remains speculative. Particular CD45 isoforms might directly dephosphorylate Vav or could differentially regulate the activity of the PTK(s) responsible for Vav phosphorylation. However, preferential dephosphorylation of Vav by a particular isoform is difficult to envision given that Vav phosphorylation is decreased in both CD45- cells and those expressing CD45(0), yet increased in wild-type cells (which express both CD45(0) and CD45(ABC) isoforms) and in cells expressing CD45(ABC). Activation-related phosphorylation of Vav clearly does not directly correlate with absolute levels of CD45 expression. Our results are more consistent with augmented activity of the PTK responsible for Vav phosphorylation by cells expressing the CD45(ABC) isoform. However, the PTK(s) responsible for the in vivo phosphorylation of Vav are presently unknown. Although Lck is capable of phosphorylating Vav in vitro, IL-2 mediated phosphorylation of Vav occurs in the absence of Lck(39Evans G.A. Howard O.M.Z. Erwin R. Farrar W.L. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). CD28 ligation results in Itk phosphorylation followed temporally by that of Vav, suggesting a possible link(38August A. Gobson S. Kawakami Y. Mills G. Dupont B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9347-9351Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that ZAP-70 can physically associate with the Vav-SH2 domain after T cell activation, although it is unknown whether Vav serves as a substrate for this PTK(47Katzav S. Sutherland M. Packham G. Yi T. Weiss A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32579-32585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further analysis of these PTKs and Vav-associated molecules in our single isoform transfectants may help delineate those pathways relevant to CD45. As mentioned above, chimeric PTPase molecules lacking the CD45 transmembrane or extracellular domains are able to restore nearly normal patterns of tyrosine phosphorylation and calcium flux(11Volarevic S. Niklinska B.B. Burns C.M. June C.H. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D. Science. 1993; 260: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 12Hovis R.R. Donovan J.A. Musci M.A. Motto D.G. Goldman F.D.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4002-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In general agreement, we showed that either the CD45(0) or CD45(ABC) isoforms are capable of reconstituting activation-related tyrosine phosphorylation. However, isoform-specific differences in IL-2 production and the tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins indicate that the extracellular domain can superimpose regulatory influences on a “constitutive” cellular PTPase requirement. Thus, even though many of the signaling pathways are conserved, a subset (that includes Vav) appears subject to differential regulation by the various CD45 extracellular domains. Differences in the utilization of these pathways can lead to rather substantial isoform-dependent differences in IL-2 secretion as demonstrated in our model and in the mouse thymocyte model of Novak et al.(49Novak T. Farber D.L. Leitenberg D. Hong S.-C. Johnson J. Bottomly K. Immunity. 1994; 1: 109-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Exactly how the CD45 extracellular domains may regulate the PTPase domains is unknown. One long-standing hypothesis supported by our findings is that the distinct extracellular domains of the various CD45 isoforms interact with different molecules on the surface of the same or other cells, thereby directing the cytoplasmic phosphatase domains toward distinct substrates. In this regard, the co-capping studies of Dianzani et al.(50Dianzani U. Luqman M. Rojo J. Yagi J. Baron J.L. Woods A. Janeway C.A. Bottomly K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 2249-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) support the notion that differential interactions between CD45 isoforms and other molecules on the surface of the same cell can occur. In conclusion, our results indicate that the regulated expression of distinct CD45 isoforms on different developmental and functional subsets of T cells may impose preferential utilization of particular TCR-mediated signaling pathways. Alterations in CD45 isoform expression by individual T cells in response to thymic selection or peripheral antigen exposure, may consequently allow that cell to respond to TCR ligation using a different subset of signals. We speculate that the delivery of these different signals to the cell nucleus might have a significant influence on cell differentiation, the expression of functional repertoire, or in allowing T cells to “fine-tune” their responsiveness. A more complete understanding of these differences is likely to have important implications for signal transduction and for the interpretation of the highly regulated expression of CD45 isoforms in lymphocytes.

P., Gerard, C., Idanpaan-Heikkila, I., and Tuomanen, E. I.(1995) Nature, in press). Because bacterial binding is in part carbohydrate dependent, and the human platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor bears a single N-linked glycosylation sequence in the second extracellular loop, we undertook studies to determine the role of this epitope in PAF receptor function. Binding of pneumococci to COS cells transfected with the human PAF receptor is greatly reduced for a receptor mutant that bears no N-linked glycosylation site. Immunohistochemical and binding analyses show decreased expression of the non-glycosylated molecule on the cell membrane relative to the wild type receptor; however, metabolic labeling and immunopurification indicate it is synthesized intracellularly at a level similar to the native molecule. A mutant receptor encoding a functional glycosylation site at the NH2 terminus is better expressed at the cell surface compared with the non-glycosylated form, indicating that trafficking to the cell surface is facilitated by glycosylation, but its location is relatively unimportant. The binding affinity for PAF is not significantly effected by the presence or location of the carbohydrate, and variations in cell surface expression have little influence on signal transduction, as the non-glycosylated PAF receptor is equally effective for activation of phospholipase C as the native molecule. These data are supportive of pneumococcal binding on protein moiety(ies) of the PAF receptor and indicate that N-glycosylation facilitates expression of the protein on the cell membrane.

Among G-protein-coupled receptors, however, the role of carbohydrate adducts is somewhat less clear, with unpredictable and non-uniform effects on ligand binding, signal transduction, and/or cell surface expression(18Dattatreyamurty B.

Since preliminary experiments indicated complex results we undertook a more extensive investigation into the role of N-glycosylation in the functional expression of the human PAF receptor. Our approach involved mutagenesis of the PAF receptor cDNA to delete the glycosylation sequence and/or incorporate a new glycosylation site in the amino-terminal sequence, testing resulting molecules for interaction with ligand and signal transduction in transfection systems.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials[3H]PAF (36 Ci/mmol), [3H]WEB 2086 (10.5 Ci/mmol), [35S]methionine + cysteine (1175 Ci/mmol), [3H]mannose (21 Ci/mmol), myo-[2-3H]inositol (20 Ci/mmol), and EnHance were purchased from DuPont NEN. pCRScript was supplied by Stratagene (La Jolla, CA).

The Flag-PAF receptor cDNA was modified by PCR to eliminate the single N-linked glycosylation site by mutating Asn169→ Ala (the dCHO mutant), taking advantage of the unique NarI restriction site (GG/CGCC) introduced by the alanine codon. Sense and antisense oligonucleotide primers corresponding to nucleotides 496-516 of the coding sequence (sense 5′-GGC TCA GGC GCC GTC ACT GCG-3′; antisense 5′-GCG AGT GAC G GC GCC TGA GCC-3′, mutated nucleotides are underlined) were paired with antisense and sense primers corresponding to the 3′ and 5′ ends of the PAF receptor coding sequence, respectively, and amplified through 25 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at 55°C for 2 min, and extension for 3 min at 72°C. PCR products were subcloned individually into pCRScript, ligated to join the 5′ and 3′ fragments, and the entire coding sequence was ligated to the pCDM8-Flag construct(12Kunz D. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9101-9106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Receptors containing consensus N-linked glycosylation sites in the NH2-terminal extracellular sequence were generated for both the wild type and dCHO receptor cDNAs by PCR. Primers were designed to mutate His4→ Asn in the human Flag-PAF receptor, yielding the sequence, LEPNDSS (sense: Nt1 5′GCGAATTC CTG GAG CCA AA C GAC TCC TCC CAC ATG-3′, mutations underlined, EcoRI site in italics). Alternatively, the amino-terminal sequence was altered to generate the sequence corresponding to the first 7 amino acids of the guinea pig PAF receptor, mutating Pro3→ Leu, His4→ Asn, and Asp5→ Ser (sense: Nt 5′-GCGAATTC CTG GAG C TA AA C AGC TCC TCC CAC ATG GAC-3′). These primers were paired with antisense primers corresponding to the 3′ end of the coding sequence using the PCR conditions described above, except that annealing was carried out at 60°C, and products were ligated to pCDM8-Flag following digestion with EcoRI and XbaI. This resulted in a total of five PAF receptor mutants, as shown schematically in Fig. 1, bearing no (dCHO), one (Nt1/dCHO and Nt/dCHO), or two consensus N-linked glycosylation sites (Nt1/WT and Nt/WT) in addition to the wild type molecule (WT). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.Cell Cultures and TransfectionCOS cells were maintained in DMEM (high glucose), containing 6 mML-glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and transfections were performed using DEAE-dextran as described previously(12Kunz D. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9101-9106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were used for subsequent studies 48-96 h later. Parallel transfections using a plasmid encoding bacterial β-galactosidase (pRSVβGal) followed by X-gal staining indicate transfection efficiencies of ~30%.Adherence of Pneumococci to Transfected CellsS. pneumoniae of the unencapsulated strain R6 was grown on trypticase soy agar containing 3% sheep blood for 18 h at 37°C. Bacteria were harvested from the plate into 1 ml of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, heat-killed, and labeled with FITC as described previously(24Cundell D.R. Tuomanen E. Microb. Pathog. 1994; 17: 361-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 25Geelen S. Bhattacharyya C. Tuomanen E. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 1538-1543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The bacteria were washed twice by centrifugation (13,000 × g, 3 min), resuspended in 1 ml of albumin buffer(25Geelen S. Bhattacharyya C. Tuomanen E. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 1538-1543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and diluted to 107-108 colony-forming units/ml. For some experiments, R6 pneumococci were grown in defined medium containing ethanolamine in place of choline as the amino alcohol(22Tomasz A. Saukkonen K. Paediatr. Infect. Dis. 1989; 8: 902-903Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 24Cundell D.R. Tuomanen E. Microb. Pathog. 1994; 17: 361-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Monolayers of COS cells were washed twice with Medium 199 and incubated with bacteria for 30 min at 37°C. Nonadherent bacteria were removed by washing the monolayers three to five times with Medium 199. Cells were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and adherent bacteria counted visually with an inverted microscope equipped for fluorescence with an IF DM-510 filter (Diaphot-TMD; Nikon Inc., Melville, NY). Adherence was expressed as the number of attached bacteria/100 cells counted in a ×40 field(24Cundell D.R. Tuomanen E. Microb. Pathog. 1994; 17: 361-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 25Geelen S. Bhattacharyya C. Tuomanen E. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 1538-1543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Values for two wells were averaged, and each experiment was performed on at least six separate occasions. To control for possible effects on adherence due to FITC labeling of bacteria, direct comparison was made between counts using FITC-labeled bacteria and unlabeled bacteria detected by Gram stain. For experiments to determine the ability of carbohydrates to inhibit adherence, FITC-labeled pneumococci (2 × 107 colony forming units/ml) were preincubated 15 min at room temperature with monosaccharides or glycoconjugates, centrifuged to remove unbound sugar, resuspended to 107 or 108 colony-forming units/ml in albumin buffer and added to the adherence assay.Ligand Binding and UptakeLigand binding to receptor transfected COS cell membranes was performed essentially as described (11Nakamura M. Honda Z. Izumi T. Sakanaka C. Mutoh H. Minami M. Bito H. Seyama Y. Matsumoto T. Noma M. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20400-20405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were prepared by scraping cells into 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, and Dounce homogenized on ice. Homogenates were centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at 4°C to remove nuclei and unbroken cells, and membranes were harvested at 100,000 × g for 20 min. Membrane protein was quantitated by Coomassie Blue staining calibrated with BSA (Pierce Protein Assay), and 30 μg were incubated in 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1% BSA, at 22°C with 2 nM [3H]WEB 2086 or 0.5 nM [3H]PAF and increasing concentrations of unlabeled antagonist or ligand, respectively, for 90 min. Mixtures were filtered on 1% BSA-soaked glass fiber filters (GF/C), washed, and subjected to liquid scintillation counting. Nonspecific binding was assessed in the presence of 10 μM WEB 2086 or PAF, and data were analyzed using the Ligand program. All points were measured in duplicate and experiments repeated at least three times.Receptor-dependent uptake of [3H]PAF on transfected COS cells was performed as described previously(26Gerard N.P. Gerard C. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 793-800PubMed Google Scholar). Cells in 6-well culture plates were washed with 150 mM choline chloride, containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, and 0.25% BSA, and incubated in the same buffer with 2 nM [3H]PAF for 45 min at 37°C. Cell layers were washed three times with buffer containing 2% BSA to remove extracellular ligand. Cell-associated ligand was quantitated by trypsinizing the cell layers and liquid scintillation counting. All experiments were performed at least three times in duplicate or triplicate. Data are corrected for nonspecific binding in the presence of 10 μM unlabeled PAF and expressed as the mean ± S.E.Cell Surface Expression of the PAF ReceptorsThe NH2-terminal Flag epitope was used to detect receptors expressed on the cell surface as described previously(12Kunz D. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9101-9106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). COS cells were plated on fibronectin-coated glass slide chambers, transfected as described above, and immunostained 3 days later. Cells were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 3% BSA, incubated with the primary antibody, m2 anti-Flag at 10 μg/ml for 30 min at 22°C, washed three times with PBS, and incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG, followed by peroxidase-labeled avidin biotin complex as described by the supplier. Staining was accomplished with 0.05% diaminobenzidine and 0.01% H2O2 in PBS, and the cells were examined by light microscopy (Olympus BH2 microscope). Cells transfected with the pCDM8 vector without insert were used as controls.Labeling of PAF ReceptorsFor metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine + cysteine, cells transfected 2 days previously were washed and incubated in methionine-free DMEM containing 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum for 1 h at 37°C. [35S]Methionine + cysteine (200 μCi/ml) was then added to the medium and incubation continued for 3 h at 37°C.For analysis of carbohydrate incorporation, transfected COS cells were incubated in glucose-free DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum for 1 h at 37°C. D-[2-3H]Mannose (100 μCi/ml) was then added to the medium and incubated at 37°C for an additional 2 h.ImmunopurificationCells labeled with [35S]amino acids or [3H] mannose were washed twice with PBS and lysed in 1% Triton X-100 in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, containing 10 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, by incubating at 4°C for 45 min. Immunoprecipitations were performed as modified from previously described methods(27Oettgen H.C. Pettey C.L. Maloy W.L. Terhorst C. Nature. 1986; 320: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Nuclear debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h and precleared with Staphylococcus aureus followed by a mixture of protein A- and G-Sepharose. Solubilized samples were incubated with 10 μg/ml m2 anti-Flag antibody for 90 min at 4°C. Protein G-Sepharose was added and incubation continued for 45 min. Immune complexes were recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 s at 4°C, washed four times with lysis buffer without protease inhibitors and once with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2. Immunoprecipitates were dissociated by incubating in SDS-sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol for 20 min at 55°C. Protein G-Sepharose beads were pelleted and the supernatant fractions applied to 10% SDS-PAGE gels. Following electrophoresis, gels were dried and subjected to fluorography (Enhance). Controls included PAF receptor-transfected cells incubated with irrelevant antibody (anti-horseradish peroxidase) in place of anti-Flag, or mock transfected COS cells incubated with anti-Flag antibody in the same manner as transfected cells.Inositol Phosphate ProductionLigand-stimulated activation of phosphatidylinositol-specific PLC was assessed as described previously(28Amatruda T.T. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10139-10144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two days after transfection, cells were washed with inositol-free DMEM and incubated for 18-24 h in inositol-free DMEM, containing 10% fetal calf serum and 10 μCi/ml myo-[2-3H]inositol. Labeling medium was removed and cells were incubated in inositol-free DMEM containing 10 mM LiCl, 0.25% BSA, and increasing concentrations of PAF at 37°C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by addition of 10% HClO4 containing 4 mg/ml IP6 and inositol phosphates purified by chromatography on Dowex 1 as described previously(29Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1984; 312: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (4220) Google Scholar). All points were determined in triplicate, and experiments were repeated at least three times. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E., percent above unstimulated controls.RESULTSPneumococcal Binding to PAF ReceptorsPrevious investigations have demonstrated specificity of S. pneumoniae for binding to the PAF receptor and invasion of cells on which it is expressed (21Cundell D.R. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Idanpaan-Heikkila I. Tuomanen E.I. Nature. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Pneumococci are also appreciated to interact with carbohydrate moieties, particularly those containing GlcNAc(24Cundell D.R. Tuomanen E. Microb. Pathog. 1994; 17: 361-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The human PAF receptor contains a single N-linked glycosylation consensus sequence in the putative second extracellular loop, on Asn169, as depicted in Fig. 1(12Kunz D. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9101-9106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A mutant PAF receptor (dCHO), in which Asn169 was changed to Ala, binds only ~30% as many pneumococci as the native molecule, compared with 3-6% on untransfected controls (Fig. 2, Table 1). As previously demonstrated for lung and endothelial cells in culture, pneumococcus binding to native PAF receptor transfected COS cells is inhibited by ~50% in the presence of 100 mM GlcNAc or 100 μM α1 acid glycoprotein, containing the GlcNAc determinant (Table 1). Asialo-GM2 and globoside at 100 μM had no inhibitory effect (data not shown). Pneumococcal binding is also inhibited by PAF or PAF receptor antagonists(21Cundell D.R. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Idanpaan-Heikkila I. Tuomanen E.I. Nature. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Further, bacteria grown in ethanolamine instead of choline do not contain phosphoryl choline in their cell wall and are unable to adhere to PAF receptor-transfected cells (Fig. 2). These data suggest that while pneumococcal adherence involves a multiplicity of targets, some specificity may reside in the PAF receptor carbohydrate. Alternatively, specificity may be determined by the PAF receptor protein, and the non-glycosylated mutant is not expressed at the cell surface with the efficiency of the native molecule.Figure 2Adherence of pneumococci to PAF receptor-transfected COS cells. Adherence of FITC-labeled pneumococci to COS cells transfected with the indicated PAF receptor construct is illustrated (approximately 70 COS cells are shown/panel). Ethanolamine-grown bacteria labeled as efficiently as wild type cells but adhered poorly to PAF receptor-bearing cells. Values for pneumococci/100 COS cells in each panel are: PAF receptor, 221; vector alone, 34; the non-glycosylated receptor (dCHO), 73; ethanolamine-grown bacteria on PAF receptor-transfected cells, 55.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Immunochemical and Pharmacological Analysis of the Non-glycosylated PAF ReceptorIn order to distinguish these possibilities, we took advantage of the Flag epitope expressed at the NH2 terminus of the transfected receptors.

As shown in Fig. 3A, COS cells expressing the native human PAF receptor exhibit predominant antibody staining at the perimeter of the cell, characteristic of cell surface epitopes. In contrast, the non-glycosylated mutant, dCHO, exhibits very faint staining, consistent with greatly reduced expression on the cell surface (Fig. 3B).Figure 3Immunohistochemical expression of the human PAF receptor and its mutants. Cell surface expression of the Flag-PAF receptor mutants was compared immunohistochemically as described under “Experimental Procedures” using unfixed, unpermeabilized cells. COS cells were transfected with the wild type Flag-PAF receptor/pCDM8 (A), or the mutants dCHO (B), Nt/WT (C), or Nt/dCHO (D) and stained with m2 anti-Flag antibody as described. Antibody staining is most intense at the perimeter of the cell, characteristic of a cell surface epitope. Nontransfected cells (E) or cells transfected with the vector pCDM8 alone show no staining.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Scatchard analyses of [3H]WEB 2086 binding to membranes from transfected COS cells (Fig. 4, Table 2) are consistent with pneumococcal binding data and immunochemical analysis. The non-glycosylated molecule (dCHO) exhibits only ~30% as many sites/cell compared to the wild type receptor; both receptors bind antagonist with similar affinity, 14-23 nM. Comparisons based on binding of [3H]PAF to these membrane preparations were not possible due to high nonspecific binding as previously reported(11Nakamura M. Honda Z. Izumi T. Sakanaka C. Mutoh H.

https://openalex.org/W2078105135,"Abstract Signal transduction of cytokine receptors is mediated by the JAK family of tyrosine kinases. Recently, the kinase partners for the interleukin (IL)-2 receptor have been identified as JAK1 and JAK3. In this study, we report the identification of splice variants that may modulate JAK3 signaling. Three splice variants were isolated from different mRNA sources: breast (B), spleen (S), and activated monocytes (M). Sequence analysis revealed that the splice variants contain identical NH-terminal regions but diverge at the COOH termini. Analyses of expression of the JAK3 splice isoforms by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on a panel of cell lines show splice preferences in different cell lines: the S-form is more commonly seen in hematopoietic lines, whereas the B- and M-forms are detected in cells both of hematopoietic and epithelial origins. Antibodies raised against peptides to the B-form splice variant confirmed that the 125-kDa JAK3B protein product is found abundantly in hematopoietic as well as epithelial cells, including primary breast cancers. The lack of subdomain XI in the tyrosine kinase core of the B-form JAK3 protein suggests that it is a defective kinase. This is supported by the lack of detected autokinase activity of the B-form JAK3. Intriguingly, both the S and B splice isoforms of JAK3 appear to co-immunoprecipitate with the IL-2 receptor from HUT-78 cell lysates. This and the presence of multiple COOH-terminal splice variants co-expressed in the same cells suggest that the JAK3 splice isoforms are functional in JAK3 signaling and may enrich the complexity of the intracellular responses functional in IL-2 or cytokine signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1991800467,"Cadmium-resistant Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain 301N exhibits high basal as well as cadmium-induced expression of the CUP1 metallothionein gene. Since regulation of CUP1 is usually restricted to copper ions, our goal was to identify the factor responsible for the high metallothionein levels in strain 301N. The gene responsible for the observed phenotype is a spontaneously mutated heat shock transcription factor gene (HSF1). A double, semidominant HSF1 mutant with substitutions at codons 206 and 256 within the DNA-binding domain of the heat shock factor (HSF) confers two phenotypes. The first phenotype is elevated transcriptional activity of the HSF mutant (HSF301), which results in constitutive thermotolerance. A second HSF301 phenotype is enhanced binding affinity for the heat shock element (HSE) within the CUP1 5′-sequences, resulting in high basal transcription of metallothionein. The CUP1 HSE is a minimal heat shock element containing only two perfectly spaced inverted repeats of the basic nGAAn block. Cells containing HSF301 are resistant to cadmium salts. The single R206S mutation is responsible for the high affinity binding to the CUP1 HSE. In addition, the R206S HSF substitution exhibits constitutive transcriptional activation from a consensus HSE (HSE2).

INTRODUCTIONAll cells are capable of coping with changes in their environment, such as exposure to elevated temperatures, toxins, and oxidants. In response to certain stress conditions, activation of stress gene expression occurs, resulting in an elevated synthesis of stress proteins, commonly called heat shock proteins (hsp) 1The abbreviations used are: hspheat shock protein(s)HSEheat shock elementHSFheat shock factorbpbase pair(s)kbkilobase pair(s).

Chem. 1994; 269: 12475-12481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that each subunit of trimeric HSF contacts a separate 5-bp box within a HSE, but the actual HSF•HSE complex appears to contain multiple HSF trimers(12Bonner J.J. Ballou C.

Furthermore, most stress genes contain multiple HSEs, so additional interactions can exist between adjacent HSF•HSE complexes. The interaction of Drosophila HSF with HSEs is known to be highly cooperative(9Xiao H. Perisic O. Lis J.T. Cell. 1991; 64: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 20Topol J. Ruden D.M. Parker C.S. Cell. 1985; 42: 527-537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), although in yeast, cooperativity is not essential as a minimal HSE of three perfect nGAAn units is functional (21Slater M.R. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1906-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).In yeast, the bound HSF•HSE complex is transcriptionally silent until stress activation(16Sorger P.K.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2617-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). HSF undergoes a conformation change upon stress activation, but the mechanism of stress-induced conformational dynamics is unclear(16Sorger P.K. Cell. 1991; 65: 363-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 22Nieto-Sotelo J. Wiederrecht G. Okuda A. Parker C.S.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2617-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In contrast, the activation process in animal cells initially involves oligomerization to the trimeric state, which already exists in yeast(1Morimoto R.I. Sarge K.D. Abravaya K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21987-21990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast HSF contains domains that function as constitutive transcriptional activation domains when fused to heterologous DNA-binding domains(22Nieto-Sotelo J. Wiederrecht G. Okuda A. Parker C.S. Cell. 1990; 62: 807-817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 23Jakobsen B.K. Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Since these transactivation domains are not constitutive in HSF at low temperature, it appears that the normal mode of action of HSF is to hinder the effectiveness of these domains. This hindrance is relieved upon change to stress conditions(16Sorger P.K. Cell. 1991; 65: 363-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The regulatory domains of HSF can even repress the activity of a heterologous transcriptional activation domain fused in place of its own C-terminal activation domain(24Bonner J.J. Heyward S. Fackenthal D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).Repression of the activation domain(s) appears to involve the DNA-binding domain, the trimerization domain, and the C-terminal conserved sequence. Deletion of the N-terminal 146 codons in HSF1 results in loss of low temperature repression(22Nieto-Sotelo J. Wiederrecht G. Okuda A. Parker C.S. Cell. 1990; 62: 807-817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Constitutive activity is also observed in HSF1 mutations within the DNA-binding domain (residues 167-256), deletions within the oligomerization domain (residues 350-402), or deletions within a C-terminal conserved region (residues 535-551)(22Nieto-Sotelo J. Wiederrecht G. Okuda A. Parker C.S. Cell. 1990; 62: 807-817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 23Jakobsen B.K. Pelham H.R.B.

Jakobsen B.K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2617-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). A mutation at codon 232 in the DNA-binding domain was shown to yield a 200-fold increase in activity at 26°C(24Bonner J.J. Heyward S. Fackenthal D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).In addition to the effects of HSF on expression of hsp genes, HSF is known to affect the expression of the gene CUP1, which encodes metallothionein(26Yang W. Gahl W. Hamer D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3676-3681Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 27Silar P. Butler G. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1994; 14: 8155-8165Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The heat shock transcription factor (HSF) is responsible for high basal expression of CUP1 in cells starved for glucose(28Tamai K.T. Liu X. Silar P. Sosinowski T. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8155-8165Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The 5′-sequence of the CUP1 gene contains a minimal heat shock promoter element (HSE) that mediates both a limited heat shock induction of CUP1 expression with wild-type HSF and CUP1 transcription observed in glucose limitation(26Yang W. Gahl W. Hamer D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3676-3681Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 28Tamai K.T. Liu X. Silar P. Sosinowski T. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8155-8165Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In addition, a point mutation within HSF1 can suppress the copper-sensitive phenotype of an ACE1 deletion strain by enhancing basal transcription of CUP1 in glucose-grown cultures(26Yang W. Gahl W. Hamer D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3676-3681Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 27Silar P. Butler G. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1232-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).CUP1 expression is normally regulated by Cu(I) ions through the ACE1 transcription factor(29Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 30Furst P. Hu S. Hackett R. Hamer D. Cell. 1988; 55: 705-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 31Welch J. Fogel S. Buchman C. Karin M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Unlike animal cells, in which metallothionein biosynthesis is regulated by a variety of metal ions, the metalloregulation of yeast metallothionein is copper-specific(30Furst P. Hu S. Hackett R. Hamer D. Cell. 1988; 55: 705-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). However, cadmium-mediated CUP1 expression was observed in one cadmium-resistant strain of S. cerevisiae(32Tohoyama H. Murayama T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1977; 41: 1523-1524Google Scholar). This strain, designated 301N(32Tohoyama H. Murayama T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1977; 41: 1523-1524Google Scholar), arising from spontaneous mutation, exhibited both high basal CUP1 transcription and cadmium-induced CUP1 expression(33Inouhe M. Hiyama M. Tohoyama H. Joho M. Murayama T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 993: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 34Tohoyama H. Tomoyasu T. Inouhe M. Joho M. Murayama T. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 35Tohoyama H. Inagawa A. Koike H. Inouhe M. Joho M. Murayama T. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 95: 81-86Crossref Google Scholar). The observed cadmium resistance was a consequence of Cd(II) buffering by metallothionein(33Inouhe M. Hiyama M. Tohoyama H. Joho M. Murayama T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 993: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).To elucidate the basis for the cadmium metalloregulation in strain 301N, we set out to identify the factor responsible for CUP1 expression in this yeast. In this study, we demonstrate that the regulatory factor conferring constitutive expression of CUP1 and cadmium metalloregulation in strain 301N is HSF. A double mutation within HSF1 in sequences encoding the DNA-binding domain leads to elevated basal transcription of CUP1 and constitutive thermotolerance. One dramatic result is that a single mutation at codon 206 (R206S) results in constitutive transcriptional activity of HSF on the consensus HSE-containing promoter, but not on the CUP1 HSE. It is noteworthy that the mutation at codon 256 suppresses the transcriptional activity of the R206S HSF mutant on the consensus HSE, but is without effect on transcriptional activation of the CUP1 HSE. This work clearly demonstrates differential activity of HSF on various HSE sequences.MATERIALS AND METHODSStrainsStrains DTY22 (MATα, ura3-52, his6, LEU2:YipCL, CUP1r) and DTY23 (MATα, his-, ura3-52, ace1-1, LEU2:YipCL, CUP1r) were gifts from Dr. D. J. Thiele. Strains DTY22 and DTY23 contain a CUP1/lacZ fusion gene integrated at LEU2. Strain PS145 (ade2-1, can1-100, his3-11,15, leu2-3,112, trp1-1, ura3-1, hsfΔ2::LEU2, YCpGAL1:HSF-URA3) (14Sorger P.K. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1988; 54: 855-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) was a gift of Dr. H. C. M. Nelson. In all experiments using transformed PS145 cells, the YCpGAL1:HSF-URA3 vector was shed by growth on medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid. Strain 301N is MATa, ura1, CUP1r. Strain CL7 (MATα, ura3, LEU2::YipCL) was isolated from segregants of tetrad spores of a cross between YIY574 (MATα, leu2, ura3, his4, lys7) and TE22-2Ae (MATα, ura3, LEU2::YipCL).HSF1 CloningDNA partially digested with Sau3A1 from strain 301N was cloned into YCp50 (36Rose M.D. Novick P. Thomas J.H. Botstein D. Fink G.R. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 60: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar) at the BamHI site, and over 59,000 total Escherichia coli transformants were recovered. Of the 2.4 × 106 yeast transformants, 29 colonies exhibiting a blue hue on 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-D-galactoside plates were selected as candidates for enhanced constitutive expression of CUP1/lacZ.VectorsA 3.9-kb EcoRI fragment containing the entire HSF1 locus was cloned into YCplac22, YEplac112, YCplac33, and YEplac195 (37Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2506) Google Scholar) to create a series of vectors containing either the wild-type or 301N mutant HSF1 on both 2μ-based high copy and centromere-based low copy vectors with either TRP1 or URA3 selection. TRP1-based vectors were used to transform PS145 cells, and URA3-based vectors were used to transform both DTY23 and DTY113 cells.MutagenesisMutagenesis was performed on a 3.9-kb EcoRI fragment containing wild-type HSF1 in vector pAlter1 (Promega) as described previously(38Sewell A.K. Jensen L.T. Erickson J.C. Palmiter R.D. Winge D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 34: 4740-4747Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Mutated sequences were removed as an NsiI/StuI fragment and cloned into the wild-type sequence. Sequencing of the 2-kb NsiI/StuI region confirmed that only the desired mutations were introduced.TransformationsYeast cells were transformed using the lithium acetate procedure(39Elble R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar). Standard yeast culturing conditions were used.β-Galactosidase Assaysβ-Galactosidase enzyme assays were performed to quantify lacZ expression. Assays were carried out on extracts from cells grown to A600 nm = 0.7-0.85 as described previously (40Thorvaldsen J.L. Sewell A.K. McCowen C.L. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12512-12518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).ThermotoleranceOne-hundred microliters of cultures grown to A600 nm = 0.7-0.75 at 23°C were added to 10 ml of fresh culture medium at either 23°C (control) or 52°C. Heat shock survival was measured by the ability to form colonies after further dilution and plating on yeast extract/peptone/dextrose plates, which were incubated at 30°C.Gel Shift AnalysisExtracts from cells from log-phase cultures grown at 23°C were prepared by cell disruption with glass beads in 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.1%β-mercaptoethanol, 0.3 M KCl. Cells were vortexed for 5 min with 0.5 volume of 425-600 μM glass beads (Sigma). Extracts were diluted with buffer to a final protein concentration of 3 mg/ml. Aliquots of 4 μl (12 μg) of this protein were incubated for 20 min with 8 μl of reaction mixture (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM EDTA, 12.5% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin containing the specified amount of poly[d(I-C)] and the 32P-labeled, double-stranded oligonucleotide probe (~14 pM)) before being run on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 1 × TBE(41Sorger P.K. Ammerer G. Shore D. Creighton T.E. Protein Function: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1989: 199-224Google Scholar). The CUP1 probe contained the sequence GCTGGCATTTCTTCTAGAAGCAAAAAGAG, and the HSE2 oligonucleotide probe contained the sequence CTAGAAGCTTCTAGAAGCTTCTAGAGGATCCCCG. The underlined nucleotides represent the conserved nGAAn inverted repeats characteristic of HSE sequences. The boldface GAG in the CUP1 HSE is a third candidate 5-bp block. The sequence of the truncated CUP1 HSE probe was GCTGGCATTTCTTCTAGAAGCAAAAATTT. Two other CUP1 HSE variants were synthesized. One variant contained a nGAAn box in place of the gapped nGAGn unit. The second variant contained three nGAGn boxes in the sequence GCTGGCATTTCCTCTAGAGGCAAAAAGAG. The competition gel shift assays involved adding both radiolabeled DNA probe and unlabeled DNA prior to addition of protein.Protein InductionsThe identification of heat shock proteins in S. cerevisiae cells was carried out as described previously(42Nicolet C.M. Craig E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 710-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).RESULTSCloning of HSFThe cadmium tolerance of S. cerevisiae strain 301N was previously shown to arise from enhanced basal expression of CUP1(35Tohoyama H. Inagawa A. Koike H. Inouhe M. Joho M. Murayama T. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 95: 81-86Crossref Google Scholar). Mating of 301N with a yeast strain containing an integrated CUP1/lacZ fusion gene resulted in a diploid that maintained limited cadmium-induced lacZ expression, implying that this phenotype is partially dominant(26Yang W. Gahl W. Hamer D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3676-3681Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 35Tohoyama H. Inagawa A. Koike H. Inouhe M. Joho M. Murayama T. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 95: 81-86Crossref Google Scholar). To determine the identity of the factor conferring the Cdr phenotype, a DNA library was constructed from 301N. Transformation of the DNA library into S. cerevisiae strain CL7 yielded 29 colonies exhibiting high constitutive expression of CUP1/lacZ as a reporter for CUP1 expression. Plasmids recovered from three colonies exhibiting the most intense blue coloration on 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-D-galactoside plates revealed inserts of 5.7, 6, and 14 kb. Restriction mapping of these plasmids suggested that the inserts in the three plasmid were related.The 5.7-kb insert was subcloned into the integrating plasmid, YIp5. This vector was linearized and transformed into strain CL7. The resulting strain was crossed with a DTY22 variant. Both haploid strains contained CUP1/lacZ fusion genes. Tetrad analysis revealed a 2:2 segregation of enhanced lacZ expression, implying that the 5.7-kb insert contains sequences capable of up-regulation of CUP1 expression.The restriction map of each plasmid was unrelated to maps of CUP1 or ACE1, but was similar to that of yeast HSF1. DNA primers specific for S. cerevisiae HSF1 were successful in priming sequencing for each of the three plasmids. From sequence analysis of the entire HSF1 open reading frame, two mutations at codons 206 and 256 (R206S and F256Y) were found. These two codons occur within sequences encoding the DNA-binding domain of HSF. Two other nucleotide differences exist at codons 522 and 831 relative to the HSF1 sequence reported by Wiederrecht et al.(13Wiederrecht G. Seto D. Parker C.S. Cell. 1988; 54: 841-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), but are identical to the HSF1 sequence reported by Sorger and Pelham(14Sorger P.K. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1988; 54: 855-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar).Characterization of hsf1-301The EcoRI fragments of both the wild-type and mutant HSF genes were cloned into YEp- and YCp-based vectors. The mutant HSF gene is designated as hsf1-301. To probe the effect of hsf1-301 on metal resistance, we elected to use a yeast strain carrying a disrupted chromosomal HSF1 locus(4Sorger P.K. Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3035-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 14Sorger P.K. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1988; 54: 855-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). HSF1 is an essential gene in yeast, so the strain with the disrupted chromosomal HSF1 was kept viable with a HSF1 gene carried on a URA3-containing vector(14Sorger P.K. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1988; 54: 855-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). This strain, PS145, was transformed with HSF1 or hsf1-301 contained on TRP1-based plasmids. Selection on 5-fluoroorotic acid allowed for shedding of the URA3-containing HSF1 plasmid, leaving cells with only HSF genes on the TRP1 vectors. These Ura-, Trp+ transformants were used in subsequent studies. Transformants with hsf1-301 as the only functional HSF gene were viable. Thus, HSF301 must be capable of the essential housekeeping functions of HSF. In addition, HSF301 was also able to induce expression of heat shock proteins after heat shock (data not shown).The presence of episomal hsf1-301 in yeast containing wild-type CUP1 conferred resistance to cadmium salts (Fig. 1A). Cells harboring YCpHSF301 were markedly more cadmium-resistant than either control cells or cells harboring YCpHSF (Fig. 1A). This effect is observed in cells at 30°C, a temperature at which the HSF-mediated stress response is limited. We were unable to determine whether hsf1-301 conferred copper tolerance in these cells as they were wild-type in ACE1, which specifically mediates copper-induced expression of CUP1. To test the effect of hsf1-301 on copper tolerance, the vectors were transformed into ace1-1 cells (DTY23) (Fig. 1B). ace1-1 cells are unable to couple CUP1 expression with the copper concentration. Cells harboring YCpHSF301 were more copper-tolerant than control cells or cells transformed with YCpHSF. When the HSF genes were present on high copy YEp plasmids, wild-type HSF1 conferred limited tolerance, and as expected, hsf1-301 cells exhibited marked copper tolerance.Effect of HSF301 on CUP1 ExpressionThe mechanism of HSF301-induced metal resistance is expected to involve activation of CUP1 transcription, although CUP1 contains a single HSE with only two perfectly spaced inverted repeats of the basic nGAAn unit that defines a HSE(10Fernandes M. Xiao H. Lis J.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 28Tamai K.T. Liu X. Silar P. Sosinowski T. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8155-8165Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Functional HSEs consist of three or more nGAAn units, and promoters containing three nGAAn inverted repeats tend to have additional HSEs(9Xiao H. Perisic O. Lis J.T. Cell. 1991; 64: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 10Fernandes M. Xiao H. Lis J.T.

Transformants harboring YCp-based hsf1-301, but not YCp-based HSF1, revealed high β-galactosidase levels at 23°C, consistent with high constitutive expression of CUP/lacZ (Fig. 2A). Cells were maintained at 23°C to minimize heat activation of HSF. Thus, activity is a measure of constitutive transcriptional activity of HSF. The difference between YCpHSF and YCpHSF301 was over 100-fold. Wild-type HSF was able to transactivate CUP1 expression to an appreciable extent only when expressed on a high copy plasmid. The presence of hsf1-301 in PS145 cells mimics two key phenotypes of strain 301N, namely enhanced metal tolerance and high basal CUP1 expression.Figure 2HSF-mediated expression of CUP1/lacZ (A) and HSE2/CYC1/lacZ (B) in PS145 cells transformed with different HSF plasmids.

The core sequence RNCCTNNRG is sufficient for recognition of the TSE-binding protein, which is detected only in nuclear extracts prepared from placenta and choriocarcinoma.

A mutation introduced in the distal TSE core in aromatase promoter resulted in marked reduction of transcriptional activity, although TSE region by itself did not show enhancer activity as that in human chorionic gonadotropin α-subunit gene. Aromatase (cytochrome P-450AROM) is a unique member of the cytochrome P-450 superfamily. It catalyzes the conversion of androgen to estrogen, which is a rate-limiting step in estrogen biosynthesis(1Thompson Jr., E.A. Siiteri P.K. J. Biol.

Recent investigations revealed that aromatase mRNAs expressed in adipose tissue, ovary, fetal liver, and brain have differences in the untranslated exon I from that reported previously for the placenta (14Means G.D.

The use of alternative transcription start sites that occur as a consequence of employing tissue specific promoters is a unique feature of the aromatase gene expression and seems to be the underlying molecular basis for the complexity of the expression of this gene. However, how individual promoters exert their tissue specificities is not known. The placenta is the primary site of estrogen synthesis in pregnant women and 16α-hydroxydehydroisoandrosterone sulfate derived from the fetal adrenal and liver is the major precursor for placental estrogen production. Human aromatase mRNA expressed in placenta has a unique untranslated exon I, which is designated as exon Ia in this laboratory (16Harada N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 17Harada N. Utsumi T. Takagi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although cDNAs containing other types of untranslated 5′-region have been isolated from placental cDNA libraries(19Kilgore M.W. Means G.D. Mendelson C.R. Simpson E.R. Mol.

Biochem. 1993; 213: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the 5′-end of exon Ia is the major initiation site in placenta. A choriocarcinoma cell line JEG-3 expresses aromatase mRNA of placental type(14Means G.D. Kilgore M.W. Mahendroo M.S. Mendelson C.R. Simpson E.R. Mol.

This cell line expresses aromatase in unstimulated condition as well as in response to phorbol ester and various reagents that raise intracellular cAMP levels(21Yamada K. Katoh S. Harada N. Takagi Y.

Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The aromatase activity in the cells was closely related to the content of aromatase mRNA that was very labile, suggesting transcriptional control is the main regulatory point for the enzyme activity. Thus, this cell line seems to provide a good system to investigate transcriptional regulation of placental type aromatase. In the present paper, we describe analysis of the 5′-flanking region of aromatase exon Ia for the placenta-specific expression of this gene. We show that the initial −301 upstream of the exon Ia is sufficient for the basal expression of the exon. This region, conferring cell specificity, contains at least three binding domains. Two of them are recognized by the same trans-acting factor that binds to the trophoblast-specific element previously located in the enhancer region of human glycoprotein hormone α-subunit(23Steger D.J. Altschied J. Buscher M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A common transcription factor appears to be involved in the expression of two hormone-related genes that are characteristic of human placenta. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 380A DNA synthesizer or were obtained commercially from Toa Gosei Co. (Tsukuba, Japan) The sequences of the double-stranded oligonucleotides used in this paper are as follows (only leading sequences are shown): C2, 5′-AGGTGCTTTAGGCCTCAGGAAACAGAA-3′;C2m,5′-AGGTGCTTTAGGAATCAGGAAACAGAA-3′; C2l, 5′-AGGTGCTTTAGGCCGAAGGAAACAGAA-3′; C2n, 5′-AGGTGC- TTTAGGCCTCATTAAACAGAA-3′; C2p, 5′-AGGTGCTTTAGGCCTCAGGCCACAGAA-3′; C2q, 5′-AGGTGCTTTATTCCTCAGGAAACAGAA-3′; C2s, 5′-AGGTGCTTTAGGCCTCTGGAAACAGAA-3′; C2t, 5′-AGGTGCTGGAGGCCTCAGGAAACAGAA-3′; C3, 5′-GACCCTCATT- CCAGAGGAGGTCATG-3′; C4, 5′-TGTCCCATACCCTGGAGGAAGGAATG-3′; TSE, 5′-ACAAAAATGACCTAAGGGTTGAAA-3′; TSEμ172, 5′-ACAAAAATGATCTAAGGGTTGAAA-3′. The complementary oligonucleotides were annealed to form double-stranded oligonucleotides. Their concentrations were determined by densitometry after electrophoresis through 2% SeaPlaque GTG-agarose (FMC) gels and staining with ethidium bromide. The following oligonucleotides were used as PCR 1The abbreviations used are: PCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s)CATchloramphenicol acetyltransferasetkthimidine kinaseTSEtrophoblast-specific elementTSEBTSE-binding protein. primers to obtain promoter fragments with 2.8KACAT as a template: F, 5′-AATGTAGAGGTGCTTTAGGC-3′; H, 5′-CTGATTGTGGGTCATAAG-3′; B, 5′-CTTTGTGCAGCATTCCTTCC-3′; D, 5′-ACAATCAGATTATAGAGTCC-3′.

To characterize the promoter regulatory region of the placental aromatase gene, chimeric constructs were prepared for transient expression. Initially, a 5′-flanking fragment (−2743 to +22) was inserted into the HindIII site of pSV00CAT (24Araki E. Shimada F. Shichiri M. Mori M. Ebina Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) (2.8KACAT). Deletion mutants in the 5′-flanking region of the fragment were generated with exonuclease III. The lengths of 5′-flanking region in deletion mutants were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing analysis. FB and HB fragments were generated by PCR. The obtained fragments were cloned in pBlueScript KS, cut out from the vectors, and inserted in pBLCAT2(25Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). The orientation and the positions of the insertions are shown in the figures. The C2nB fragment, generated by PCR, was cloned in pBlueScript KS and then subcloned to pBLCAT2. The StuI-XhoI fragment of the clone that carries C2n mutation was replaced to wild type StuI-XhoI fragment of pFBCAT2. Choriocarcinoma JEG-3 cells (ATCC) were maintained in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Whittaker Bioproducts), 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, and 1 mM pyruvate. HeLa cells (ATCC) were maintained in minimum essential medium containing 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids and 10% fetal calf serum. HepG2 cells (ATCC), obtained from Riken Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Japan), were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All of the cells were cultured at 37°C in a 95% air, 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. For the transfection experiment, cells were plated at 1 × 106 cells/90-mm plate 2 days before transfection. The medium was changed 4 h before transfection. 8 μg of CAT plasmid and 1 μg of reference plasmid RSV/Luci (26De Wet J. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2481) Google Scholar) with 0.1 mg of O,O‘-didodecyl-N-[p-(2-trimethylammonioalkyloxy)benzoyl]-L-glutamate bromide (27Ito A. Miyazoe R. Mitoma J. Akao T. Osaki T. Kunitake T. Biochem. Int. 1990; 22: 235-241PubMed Google Scholar) were suspended in 1 ml of culture medium without serum and kept for 30 min at room temperature. Culture dishes were washed once with 8 ml of the culture medium without serum and refed with 4 ml of the culture medium containing 5% fetal calf serum. Transfection was started by dropwise addition of the liposome-DNA suspension. After 12-16 h, the culture medium was changed to medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and gentamicin. Cells were cultured for 48 h before cell lysis. The reference plasmid RSV/Luci in CAT assay expresses the luciferase protein under control of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter. Luciferase assays were performed as described by Brasier et al.(28Brasier A.R. Tate J.E. Habener J.F. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 1116-1122PubMed Google Scholar). 10 μl of lysate from each plate was added to 100 μl of 25 mM glycylglycine buffer (pH 7.5), 5 mM MgCl2, and 5 mM ATP, and the reaction was started by injection of 100 μl of 25 mM glycylglycine buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.1 μmol of luciferin and 1 mM dithiothreitol into the sample. Light output was measured for 30 s at 25°C using a Luminescence Reader BLR-301 (Aloka). A CAT assay was conducted as described (29Gorman C.M. Moffart F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar) with samples containing equal amounts of luciferase units. The amounts of acetylated chloramphenicol on TLC plates were quantitated with a Bioimage Analyzer BA100 (Fuji Film Co.). Nuclear extracts from JEG-3, HeLa, and HepG2 cells were prepared as described by Uchiumi et al.(30Uchiumi F. Semba K. Yamanashi Y. Fujisawa J. Yoshida M. Inoue K. Toyoshima K. Yamamoto T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 12: 3784-3795Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and from human placenta according to the procedure described by Gorski et al.(31Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with a BCA protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as a standard. DNA fragments FB, FD, and HB were created by polymerase chain reaction and size selected by electrophoresis through 2% SeaPlaque GTG-agarose gels. They were end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Takara Shuzo Co.). A 32P-C2 probe was prepared by labeling the C2 fragment with [α-32P]dCTP by the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. The nuclear extract was incubated with radioactive probe (approximately 10 kcpm) at room temperature for 30 min in a final volume of 22 μl of 20 mM HEPES KOH (pH 7.9) buffer containing 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), 50 mM KCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. For the competition analysis, nuclear extract was incubated for 10 min with the indicated molar excess of cold oligonucleotide prior to addition of the radiolabeled probe. The samples were then loaded on a 5% non-denaturing acrylamide gel (acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio, 29:1) and run for 2.5 h at 4°C at 175 V in TAE buffer (25 mM Tris, 3.3 mM sodium acetate, and 1 mM EDTA). Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak-Omat AR film at −70°C in the presence of intensifying screens for 16-48 h. When various lengths of truncated 5′-flanking region of aromatase exon Ia up to 12 kilobases were transiently expressed in JEG-3 cells, a choriocarcinoma cell line, the shortest construct that showed the full transcription activity was a CAT construct containing −301 to +22 of aromatase exon Ia (p-301ACAT). A shorter construct, p-212ACAT, exhibited 14% of full activity, and p-115ACAT had minimal transcription activity (Fig. 2). Thus, the region downstream of −301 is likely to contain the regulatory domain for basal expression of exon Ia, namely, placental type aromatase mRNA. These three constructs and a CAT construct with the tk promoter were transfected into two other cell lines: a hepatic cell line, HepG2, and HeLa cells. In HepG2, exon Ib-type aromatase mRNA, a major form expressed in fibroblasts and fetal liver, was found. 2K. Yamada, N. Harada, S. Honda, and Y. Takagi, unpublished observation. HeLa cells did not express detectable amounts of aromatase mRNA under our culture and assay conditions including 30 cycles of reverse transcription-PCR. When the same luciferase units were applied to CAT assay, CAT constructs with truncated aromatase exon Ia upstream poorly activated transcription in HepG2 and HeLa cells, compared to the nonspecific promoter tk. Therefore, the regulator/promoter activity of the 5′-upstream region of aromatase exon Ia was found specific to trophoblasts. For further analysis of this regulator/promoter region, labeled DNA fragments encompassing this region and nuclear extracts from JEG 3 cells were prepared for gel mobility shift assay. In Fig. 1, a schematic diagram of the promoter region of aromatase Ia is illustrated with the size and location of tested fragments in the gel mobility shift assay (start points of the CAT constructs listed in Fig. 2 are shown with arrows). As shown in Fig. 3, a fragment spanning −307 to −142 (designated as FB) gave two specific bands (panelA, lane1), which are indicated with arrows. These bands were diminished with a 400× molar excess of unlabeled FB as a competitor (lane2). As illustrated in Fig. 1, this region contains several potential cis-elements such as Ad4(32Morohashi K. Honda S. Inomata Y. Handa H. Omura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17913-17919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PEA3(33Wasylyk C. Flores P. Gutman A. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3371-3378Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and Sp1(34Jones K.A. Tjian R. Nature. 1985; 317: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Ad4 sequences exist in regulatory regions of various steroidogenic P-450 genes, and this element dictates expression specific to steroidogenic tissues. Oligonucleotides containing consensus sequences for Ad4 (5′-GGACATACCCAAGGTCCCCTTT-3′) (32Morohashi K. Honda S. Inomata Y. Handa H. Omura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17913-17919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or PEA 3 (5′-TCGAACTTCCTGCTCGA-3′) (33Wasylyk C. Flores P. Gutman A. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3371-3378Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) did not compete for binding (Fig. 3A, lanes6 and 7). The major binding complex formed with labeled FB was also competed by some segments of FB, namely, FD (−307/−210), FC1 (−307/−240), and HB (−217/−142) (lanes3-5). The smallest fragment that competed for the binding was the 27-bp fragment, C2 (−300/−274), included in the FD fragment (Fig. 3A, lane8). The formation of the minor binding complex was inhibited by the HB and HM (−217/−166) fragments (lanes5 and 9). When the FD fragment was used as a probe (Fig. 3B), only the major band appeared as a specific binding complex (Fig. 3B, lane6). Unlabeled FD, FC1, HB, and C2 (Fig. 3B, lanes1-4) competed for this binding. In experiments where the HB fragment was used as a radiolabeled probe (Fig. 3, panelC), two specific bands appeared as shown by the arrow and arrowhead. The major band was inhibited by excess amounts of unlabeled HB, FC1, C2, and C4 (−177/−153) (Fig. 3C, lanes2-4 and 8). The restriction enzyme MvaI cuts the HB fragment at −166/−165, and the digested HB probe completely lost the ability to form the major band (data not shown). Both of the resulting fragments of digested HB failed to effectively compete for the binding of major bands (Fig. 3C, lanes6 and 7). The formation of the minor band was not inhibited with C2 or C4 fragments but was inhibited by a segment of HB (−212/−167) (lane6) and a 25-bp fragment encompassing −199/−176 (C3) (lane5). In panelD, mutual competition between C2 and C4 is illustrated. The results of these gel mobility shift assays can be summarized as follows; two sites in the FB region, C2 and C4, bind to the same nuclear factor to form a major band and another factor, which forms minor complex binds to a distinct region between the two domains. The two DNA fragments that contain regions for specific binding with JEG-3 nuclear extracts were linked to the CAT reporter gene upstream of a heterologous tk promoter, and transient transfection assays were carried out in JEG-3, HeLa, and HepG2 cells (Fig. 4A). FB fragment, which contains C2, C3, and C4 domains, stimulated transcription driven by tk by nearly 100-fold in JEG-3 cells. Whereas in HeLa and HepG2 cells, the extent of the stimulation was small, showing this fragment carries the tissue specificity that was observed in truncated promoter p301ACAT. The smaller fragment HB included in the FB had about 12% of the activity of pFBCAT in JEG-3 cells. The ratio of the activities of the two fragments in JEG-3 cells was comparable to that of the activity ratio of two truncated promoters, p-212ACAT and p-301ACAT (14%). The HB fragment that contains C3 and C4 domains still carries tissue specificity, being the stimulation greater in trophoblast cells, but the extent was smaller compared with that of pFBCAT2. In accordance with the cell specificity of the stimulative activity, the specific binding complex with C2 was observed only with nuclear extracts prepared from JEG-3 cells. Nuclear extract prepared from the placenta also showed specific binding complex with C2 (Fig. 4B). The core DNA sequence necessary for binding of the C2 fragment was determined by competition analysis. Sequential mutations were introduced into the C2 fragment, and their competitive activities were examined with C2 or HB as radiolabeled probes. As shown in Fig. 5, four pairs of nucleotides between −290 to −282 (GG CC TC GG) were important for the binding to C2. At least one base in each of the four pairs was necessary for the recognition. These mutated C2 fragments also showed similar competitive effects on formation of the major binding complex with HB probe, which contains proximal binding domain C4. This result further shows that these two binding domains are recognized by a same trans-factor. As we found that this sequence requirement for C2 and C4 binding was not conflicting with that of TSE, which resides in the upstream region of human chorionic gonadotropin α-subunit gene(23Steger D.J. Altschied J. Buscher M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 35Delegeane A.M. Ferland L.H. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3994-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 36Jameson J.L. Albanese C. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16190-16196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the 24-bp segment (−182/−159), designated as TSE in the promoter of the α-subunit gene(37Pittmann R.H. Clay C.M. Farmerie T.A. Nilson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19360-19368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was synthesized and examined for competition with formation of the binding of C2, C4, and HB. As shown in Fig. 6A, TSE effectively inhibited formation of the binding complex of C2, C4 (lanes2 and 5), and the major complex with HB (lane9). The binding factor(s) for TSE is referred to as the TSE-binding protein (TSEB)(23Steger D.J. Altschied J. Buscher M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Little is known about TSEB except its cell line-specific occurrence and that it cannot bind to a TSE homologue that has a C to T mutation at −172 (TSEμ-172)(37Pittmann R.H. Clay C.M. Farmerie T.A. Nilson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19360-19368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The failure of this mutated TSE to compete for the binding of C2, C4, and HB (lanes1, 6, and 10) further confirms that the binding activity to the C2 and C4 regions arises from the same factor with TSEB. As C2 and C4 are recognized by the same factor(s) TSEB, their core binding domains are designated as TSE-Carom 1 and 2, respectively. Interestingly, the minor complex formed with labeled HB was competed by both TSE and TSEμ-172 (indicated by an arrow) (lanes9 and 10). In panelB, three sequences are aligned to give a consensus sequence for TSEB recognition. The consensus sequence RNCCTNNRG also suffices requirement for the binding shown in Fig. 5. The observation that the C4 fragment with a mutation at −166 and −167 (CC to GG) failed to compete for the binding of C4 (data not shown) also supports this alignment. In the last experiment transcriptional activity of this region was further examined (Fig. 7). The HB fragment that contains the TSE-Carom-2 and C3 enhanced transcription when linked to the tk promoter in both directions and placed downstream of tk. The full activity of pFBCAT was not retained when the fragment was reversely placed upstream or downstream of tk promoter. The C2 fragment only marginally activated transcription when single, double, or four copies of the 26-bp fragment were linked to the tk promoter. As the distal TSE core sequence did not enhance transcription by itself, transcriptional activity of a pFBCAT that has two G to T mutations at −283 and −282 (corresponding C2n-type mutation in Fig. 5) was examined. This mutation resulted in marked reduction of the transcription activity. In the present study, we have shown that DNA sequences within the initial −301 upstream of placenta-specific exon I (exon Ia) are sufficient for basal transcription of placental type aromatase mRNA. Transcription activity directed by this promoter/regulator is cell type specific. Further deletion resulted in gradual loss of the transcriptional activity, suggesting involvement of multiple regulatory elements as shown in other systems(38Tjan R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). The fragment encompassing the distal half of the region has an activity to enhance transcription driven by a heterologous tk promoter, which was also cell type specific. Gel mobility shift assay demonstrated three distinct binding domains in this region. Two separate binding domains at −300/−274 (C2) and −177/−153 (C4) form a major complex. The mutual trans-acting factor for C2 and C4 was further found to be the same factor that recognizes the TSE, which resides in the upstream region of the human glycoprotein hormone α-subunit gene (Fig. 6)(23Steger D.J. Altschied J. Buscher M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 35Delegeane A.M. Ferland L.H. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19360-19368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In human, this gene is expressed in the pituitary as subunits of glycoprotein hormones as well as α-subunit of chorionic gonadotropin in placenta. The placental expression of this gene has been extensively studied; it requires a multi-component enhancer composed of tandem cAMP-responsive elements and an adjacent upstream regulatory element. TSE is described as a subdomain of upstream regulatory element and is considered to be a regulatory element that confers tissue-specific expression. Although little is known about its binding protein, TSEB(23Steger D.J. Altschied J. Buscher M. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 37Pittmann R.H. Clay C.M. Farmerie T.A. Nilson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19360-19368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the cytosine at −172 in TSE is critical for recognition of TSE sequence by TSEB. The observation that TSE with a C to T substitution at −172 also failed to compete for binding to C2 or C4 gives support to the conclusion that TSEB is the factor. The two new TSE-like sequences in the aromatase promoter and the competition analysis of their homologues with sequentially introduced mutations now reveal the sequence required for TSEB recognition, namely, the core sequence of TSE (TSE-C) as RNCCTNNRG. In the α-subunit promoter, TSE is associated with another element, αACT, adjacent to two tandemly repeated cAMPresponsive elements to compose a tissue-specific enhancer. TSE in the α-subunit promoter has little independent transcriptional activity when linked to homologous or heterologous promoters, and only when linked to the cAMP-responsive elements does it stimulate basal and cAMP-dependent expression. Likewise, the trophoblast-specific enhancer in the aromatase gene may be composed of multiple cis-elements including two TSE-Cs, although neither of them is associated with cAMP-responsive element or other known cis-elements. The 27-bp DNA fragment containing TSE-Carom1 was inactive to stimulate tk-driven transcription by itself even when two or four tandem copies were introduced. The binding to TSE-Carom1, however, seems to make an indispensable part of the aromatase enhancer. A pFBCAT2 analogue that has a mutation which eliminates TSE-Carom-1 binding loses most of the transcriptional activity that the parent pFBCAT2 shows. At present we do not have the direct evidence of the contribution of the proximal TSE-C or the C3 region to the enhancer activity. The two TSE-Cs seem to be equivalent in terms of recognition by TSEB, but their function may be different because of their position. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 7, the transcriptional activities of FB and HB fragments seem to be affected by their orientation and position in the CAT constructs. Importance of the region between −242 and −183, which contains the C3 domain, was shown by Toda et al.(39Toda K. Miyahara K. Kawamoto T. Ikeda H. Sagara Y. Shizuta Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 40Toda K. Terashima M. Kawamoto T. Sumimoto H. Yokoyama Y. Kuribayashi I. Mitsuuchi Y. Maeda T. Yamamoto Y. Sagara Y. Ikeda H.

They reported that the 89-bp fragment had an enhancer activity when multiple copies were placed with a heterologous promoter. Although the binding to the C3 domain was not competed by the two TSE-Carom sequences, the TSE derived from the α-subunit gene competed for binding to the C3 domain, and the TSEμ−172 that failed to compete for TSE and TSE-Caroms is competitive for binding to the C3 region. Pittmann et al.(37Pittmann R.H. Clay C.M. Farmerie T.A. Nilson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19360-19368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) recently described a new binding protein that recognizes the region partly overlapping TSE in the α-subunit promoter. This trans-acting element binds to a distinct recognition sequence from that of TSEB and seems to be involved in placenta-specific expression of the α-subunit gene as well. It is therefore of particular interest whether this second upstream regulatory element binding protein is also involved in the expression of placental aromatase. In this study, we demonstrated that TSE-like elements are located in the promoter region of placenta-specific exon I of aromatase and that at least the distal TSE-like element is transcriptionally functional. TSE-like elements in aromatase gene seem to compose a placenta-specific enhancer with other factor(s), as shown in the α-subunit gene, though their compositions seem to be quite different. The observation that the element recognized by TSEB, originally found in the α-subunit gene, also functions in the promoter regions of unrelated genes to confer placenta specificity emphasizes its functional importance as a placenta-specific transcription element. Although the α-subunit and aromatase genes are not closely linked in evolution, both are involved in producing hormones characteristic of the human placenta. Interestingly, the placental expressions of these genes are observed only in some mammals. Nevertheless, the fact that the two hormones are secreted from an early stage of pregnancy and play important roles in development and maintenance of the human placenta highlights the significance of a common trans-acting factor governing their expression. A potential TSE-C sequence is seen in the immediate upstream of human chorionic gonadotropin β-subunit genes(41Hollenberg A.N. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Boers M. Jameson J.L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 106: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), though their functional significance has not been tested. Although various types of transcription factor have been found in trophoblasts so far, only a few are specific to this cell type(42Cross J.C. Werb Z. Fisher S.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1508-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). Recently, transcription factors of the basic helix-loop-helix family that are important cell lineage determinants in many cell types have been identified with limited occurrence in extra-embryonic structures (43Guillemont F. Nagy A. Auerbach A. Rossant J. Joyner A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 44Cross J.C. Flannery M.B. Werb Z. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 453Google Scholar). At present, however, their immediate target genes have not been shown. TSEB is likely to be a immediate regulator of the genes in the later stage of placental differentiation. Purification of TSEB and cDNA cloning should clarify its identity as a trophoblast-specific transcription factor and provide the basis for further investigations of its roles and temporal and causal relationships with other factors that determine the differentiation to trophoblast lineage.

In the absence of GalNAc and Gal, newly synthesized GlcNAc-T I did not acquire O-linked oligosaccharides but was catalytically active and was transported to the Golgi region as defined using both immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. After addition of cycloheximide to prevent further synthesis, GalNAc and Gal were added, and the unglycosylated GlcNAc-T I was found to acquire mature, O-linked oligosaccharides with a half-time of about 150 min. The addition of these sugars was sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide and okadaic acid, both inhibitors of vesicle-mediated traffic. Together, these results suggest that Myc-GlcNAc-T I undergoes retrograde transport to the early part of the Golgi apparatus where the first O-linked sugar, GalNAc, is added followed by anterograde transport back to the Golgi stack, where addition of Gal and sialic acid occurs. ldlD cells, which lack the UDP-Gal/UDP-GalNAc 4-epimerase, were stably transfected with a Myc-tagged version of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (Myc-GlcNAc-T I).

No signals are needed for proteins to move from one compartment to the next along the exocytic pathway (Pfeffer and Rothman, 1987; Pryer et al., 1992; Rothman and Orci, 1992). Signals are needed to divert proteins in the trans Golgi network (TGN) to organelles such as the lysosomes (Kornfeld and Mellman, 1989) and secretory granules (Bauerfeind and Huttner, 1993). They are also needed to localize proteins to particular compartments on the exocytic pathway. These signals are of two types: retention signals and retrieval signals (Nilsson and Warren, 1994). Retention signals provide the primary means of localizing a protein to a particular compartment. The best characterized are those located in the membrane-spanning domain (and flanking sequences) of Golgi enzymes, though the precise manner in which they work has still to be elucidated (Bretscher and Munro, 1993; Nilsson et al., 1993b). Retrieval signals have been identified on soluble proteins in the ER (Munro and Pelham, 1987) and on membrane proteins both in the ER (Nilsson et al., 1989; Jackson et al., 1993; Schutze et al., 1994) and the TGN (Bos et al., 1993; Humphrey et al., 1993; Wong and Hong, 1993). These function to return proteins to their correct compartments after they have left them. The act of leaving may reflect the limitations of the retention mechanism in which case retrieval is a salvage process (Warren, 1987). Alternatively, it may reflect the transport process, which requires reusable proteins to package and deliver cargo to the next compartment. In this case, retrieval is a recycling process (Pelham, 1989).In one case, that of TGN38 (Ponnambalam et al., 1994), a retention signal has been identified in the membrane-spanning domain and a retrieval signal in the cytoplasmic tail. This suggests that all proteins along the exocytic pathway might be equipped in this manner, with the membrane-spanning domain providing the primary means of localizing the protein and the retrieval signal acting to return the protein should it either deliberately or accidentally leave the compartment in which it mostly resides.Retrieval signals have not yet been identified in resident Golgi enzymes, though there is some evidence that they are retrieved from later compartment(s). Mannosidase II, for example, is present in medial/trans cisternae in most cells (Velasco et al., 1993), yet the bound oligosaccharides are modified by sulfate residues (Moremen and Touster, 1985), a modification that is restricted to the TGN (Baeuerle and Huttner, 1987). Other Golgi proteins have also been shown to contain oligosaccharides that suggest passage beyond the point at which they normally reside (Yuan et al., 1987; Gonatas et al., 1989; Johnston et al., 1994; Alcalde et al., 1994). It is, however, possible that these modifications are caused not by recycling but by the presence of small amounts of the oligosaccharide-modifying enzymes in compartments other than those in which they mostly reside. We have shown recently that enzymes involved in the construction of complex N-linked oligosaccharides are mostly present in two adjacent cisternae, but small amounts are present in flanking cisternae (Nilsson et al., 1993a).We set out to devise a system that would measure the retrieval of a resident Golgi enzyme. We exploited the properties of a Chinese hamster ovary cell line (ldlD) generated by Krieger and colleagues (Kingsley et al., 1986), which lacks the epimerase activity needed to synthesize Gal and GalNAc from glucose precursors. The consequence is that synthesis of O-linked oligosaccharides cannot be initiated, and N-linked oligosaccharides are truncated at the point where terminal Gal would have been added. These defects are rapidly reversed by the addition of exogenous Gal and GalNAc.The synthesis of O-linked oligosaccharides is initiated in the CGN (Tooze et al., 1988; Niemann et al., 1982; Krijnse-Locker et al., 1994) and the cis cisterna of the Golgi stack (Roth, 1984; Deschyyteneer et al., 1988; Roth et al., 1994) by the addition of GalNAc to serine or threonine residues. The CGN (Huttner and Tooze, 1989; Hsu et al., 1991; Pelham, 1989), also known as the intermediate (Saraste and Kuismanen, 1984; Schweizer et al., 1990) or salvage compartment (Warren, 1987), receives the entire output of newly synthesized proteins from the ER and delivers them to the cis cisterna of the Golgi stack. This includes newly synthesized enzymes that reside in the Golgi stack. We focused on GlcNAc-T I, both because it resides in the medial/trans cisternae in most cells (Velasco et al., 1993) and it contains only O-linked and not N-linked oligosaccharides (Kumar et al. (1990) and this paper), a feature that considerably simplified analysis.We reasoned that, in the absence of exogenous GalNAc and Gal, GlcNAc-T I, lacking O-linked oligosaccharides, would be delivered to the Golgi stack. Evidence in support of this assertion comes from the kinetics of maturation of the human respiratory syncitial virus in ldlD cells (Wertz et al., 1989). In the absence of exogenous GalNAc and Gal, the bound oligosaccharides of the human respiratory syncitial virus G protein are chased into an endoglycosidase H-resistant form. This can only occur if GlcNAc-T I is active and located in the Golgi apparatus. After delivery of the unglycosylated GlcNAc-T I to the Golgi stack, Gal and GalNAc would be added to restore the synthesis of O-linked oligosaccharides. If GlcNAc-T I recycled and the salvage pathway involved passage back through the CGN and the cis cisterna, GalNAc would be added, followed by Gal and sialic acid once the enzyme reached its original location in the medial/trans part of the stack. Here, we show that GlcNAc-T I did acquire these sugars and that this was prevented by inhibitors of vesicle-mediated traffic.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMyc-GlcNAc-T I CellsThe ldlD line of Chinese hamster ovary cells (Krieger et al., 1989) was grown in ITS medium (McCoy's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 5 μg/ml each of insulin, transferrin, and selenium, 1% glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% non-essential amino acids) supplemented with 3% dialyzed fetal calf serum (dFCS).Sub-confluent monolayers (60%) of parental ldlD cells were transfected with 20 μg of cDNA encoding Myc-tagged GlcNAc-T I. Stable clones were selected and then maintained in the presence of geneticin (400 μg/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.).Culture and Treatment of CellsFor a typical experiment, approximately 3 × 105 cells were seeded onto a 100-mm-diameter tissue culture Petri dish and grown overnight in complete growth medium. After changing to ITS medium (which lacks serum and hence GalNAc and Gal), the cells were grown for a further 3 days to allow sufficient time for all of the oligosaccharides on membrane proteins to be replaced by protein turnover.Cycloheximide (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 30 μg/ml, 4 h before addition of exogenous GalNAc and Gal, and was then present throughout the remainder of the experiment in all washes and chase medium. The sugars (GalNAc and Gal, both from Sigma), when present, were added to a final concentration of 400 μg and 20 μg/ml, respectively, for up to 4 h.For NEM treatment, cells were treated with cycloheximide for 3.5 h, washed with ice-cold Hank's buffered saline solution, incubated with 1 mM NEM in the same buffer for 15 min at 0°C, and washed; excess NEM was quenched at room temperature for 5 min using 2 mM dithiothreitol. After two more buffer washes, incubation was continued in ITS medium in the presence or absence of GalNAc/Gal for 4 h.For treatment with okadaic acid, cells were treated with cycloheximide for 3 h before addition of 1 μM okadaic acid for 1 h. Incubation was then continued in the presence or absence of GalNAc/Gal for 4 h.Sample PreparationCells were lysed, and proteins were precipitated from the supernatant using methanol-chloroform (Wessel and Fluge, 1984). Some samples were incubated for 3 h at 37°C in 50 μl of 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 8-10 units of neuraminidase type III (Glyko, Inc.). Proteins were fractionated on 8-10% polyacrylamide gels (Laemmli, 1970) and transferred using the buffer system of Towbin et al.(1979). Myc-GlcNAc-T I was detected using the 9E10 monoclonal antibody (ICRF hybridoma unit) as the primary antibody at a dilution of 1:1000 followed by an horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse antibody (Tago; 1:2000 dilution) and visualized using the ECL Western blotting kit from Amersham. The gels were scanned using an LKB Ultrascan XL densitometer. Molecular weights were derived from standard curves constructed using the low range SDS-PAGE standards from Bio-Rad.Laser Scanning Confocal MicroscopyCells were processed for immunofluorescence microscopy as described by Warren et al.(1984). They were double labeled for Myc-GlcNAc-T I and mannosidase II using monoclonal 9E10 antibodies and polyclonal anti-mannosidase II antibodies (Moremen and Touster, 1985), respectively. The secondary antibodies were Texas red-conjugated, horse anti-mouse and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Labs). The stained cells were visualized using an MRC1000 confocal laser microscope (Bio-Rad).Electron Microscopy and Immunogold LabelingCells were fixed at room temperature with 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, for 2 h. Fixed cells were processed for cryoelectron microscopy and immunogold labeling exactly as described by Misteli and Warren(1995). The primary 9E10 antibody was used at a 1:100 dilution in PBS, 0.5% fish skin gelatin; the secondary rabbit anti-mouse antibody coupled to 10 nm of gold (Biocell, Cardiff, UK) was used at a dilution of 1:20. Sections were examined in a Phillips CM10 electron microscope.Morphometric AnalysisPhotographs of Golgi areas were taken at a final magnification of 38,750 or 52,000 times. Cisternae, Golgi stacks, and the Golgi area were defined as in Misteli and Warren(1995).To determine the labeling density, the sectioned surface area of Golgi stacks, the Golgi area, or the nucleus was determined by a point-hit method (Weibel et al., 1969) using the formula A = (P•d2)/M2, where A = the sectioned surface area, P = the grid intersections falling over the area, d = the distance between grid lines, and M = the final magnification of the photograph.The number of gold particles associated with the measured area was counted, and the density was determined by N/A, with N being the number of gold particles. For each sample, at least 15 Golgi areas from cells from two experiments were counted, and the results are presented as the mean ± S.D.Enzyme AssaysCells were grown to 70-80% confluency, and the harvested cell pellets were extracted with 1% Triton X-114 essentially as described by Bordier(1981), except that the initial extract was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C before phase separation at 37°C. Aliquots of the detergent phases were assayed in duplicate for β1,4-galactosyltransferase, GlcNAc-T I, and protein content as described previously (Bretz and Staubli, 1977; Vischer and Hughes, 1981; Slusarewicz et al., 1994).RESULTSO-Linked Sugars Bound to Myc-GlcNAc-T ISince suitable antibodies were not available to the endogenous GlcNAc-T I in ldlD cells, they were transfected with the cDNA encoding human GlcNAc-T I (Kumar et al., 1990). This was modified so as to encode the Myc epitope at the C terminus of the protein (Nilsson et al., 1993a), which resides in the Golgi lumen. The Myc epitope is recognized specifically and with high affinity by the 9E10 monoclonal antibody (Evan et al., 1985).This modified cDNA was subcloned into the pSRα vector, and stable transfectants were selected in the presence of geneticin (Southern, 1981; Canaani and Berg, 1982). Mixed clones were used in which more than 90% of the cells expressed similar levels of protein as assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy.To determine the composition of the O-linked oligosaccharides on the Myc-GlcNAc-T I, cells were grown for 3 days in McCoy's medium supplemented with insulin, transferrin, and selenium (ITS medium) in the presence or absence of GalNAc/Gal or in the presence of FCS. After lysis and fractionation by SDS-PAGE, total membrane proteins were transferred to membranes and were probed with the monoclonal antibody 9E10.Three forms of the protein were detected. An unglycosylated form of 51 kDa, an immature form of 52 kDa, and a mature form of 55 kDa. The unglycosylated form of 51 kDa was the major form of the protein found in cells grown for 3 days in ITS medium alone (Fig. 1A, lane1). The molecular mass of 51 kDa is very similar to that calculated from the sequence of the protein, 50.9 kDa (Kumar et al., 1990). A minor form of 52 kDa was also present. The amount of the minor 52-kDa form increased with time in ITS medium. Since this form migrated almost exactly with that obtained by incubating the cells in ITS containing GalNAc (Fig. 1A, lane2), it seemed likely that it represented an immature form of the protein (see “Discussion”). Sugars such as GalNAc can sometimes be salvaged during degradation of endogenous proteins (Krieger et al., 1989). When cells were incubated in ITS medium containing both GalNAc and Gal, the molecular mass of Myc-GlcNAc-T I increased to 55 kDa (Fig. 1A, lane3), the same as that obtained in the presence of dFCS (Fig. 1A, lane4). These mature forms of Myc-GlcNAc-T I were also sensitive to treatment with neuraminidase (Fig. 1B, lanes1-4), showing that the O-linked oligosaccharides contained sialic acid. Taken together, these data show that a mixture of GalNAc and Gal is both necessary and sufficient for the construction of the O-linked oligosaccharides found on the mature protein. Furthermore, the difference in molecular mass between the unglycosylated and mature forms of the protein (~4 kDa) is consistent with the addition of two simple O-linked oligosaccharides (Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1980).Activity of Myc-GlcNAc-T ICells were extracted with Triton X-114, and the membrane proteins were enriched by partitioning at 30°C into the detergent phase (Bordier, 1981). GlcNAc-T I was assayed using ovalbumin as the acceptor. Table 1 shows that the transfected cells had about 10 times the activity of the parental cell line, irrespective of the growth medium or incubation conditions. This increase was specific to GlcNAc-T I because another resident Golgi enzyme, β1,4-galactosyltransferase, was found to have a small but significantly lower specific activity in the transfected cells (Table 1). These data argue strongly that the expressed Myc-GlcNAc-T I is enzymatically active and must, therefore, have folded correctly in ldlD cells.Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Table 1 also shows that the specific activity of GlcNAc-T I was unaffected by the addition of GalNAc/Gal to the ITS growth medium. Since this treatment adds O-linked oligosaccharides to pre-existing Myc-GlcNAc-T I (see below and Fig. 4), it is clear that these O-linked oligosaccharides have no significant effect on the catalytic activity of the protein. Similar results were obtained for β1,4-galactosyltransferase.Figure 4Time course of acquisition of O-linked oligosaccharides. A, after 3 days growth in ITS medium, cycloheximide was added, followed 4 h later by GalNAc/Gal for up to another 4 h. Cell extracts were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, Western blotted using the 9E10 antibody to detect the Myc-GlcNAc-T I (top), and the lanes scanned so as to quantitate the conversion of the unglycosylated and immature forms of Myc-GlcNAc-T I (51- and 52-kDa forms) to the mature form (55 kDa). B, cells incubated for 4 h in the absence (lanes1 and 2) or presence (lanes3 and 4) of GalNAc/Gal were either mock-treated (lanes1 and 3) or treated (lanes2 and 4) with neuraminidase before fractionation by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A small but significant increase in the specific activities of both enzymes in both cell lines when the cells were grown in ITS medium containing dFCS likely reflects the presence of growth factors that increase the growth rate.Location of Myc-GlcNAc-T IThe location of Myc-GlcNAc-T I in ldlD cells was determined using both immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy.When the stably transfected cells were grown under optimal conditions, in the presence of ITS and dFCS, GlcNAc-T I was localized by immunofluorescence to a compact juxtanuclear reticulum characteristic of the Golgi apparatus in these cells (Fig. 2A). This location was confirmed by double labeling for the resident enzyme, mannosidase II (Louvard et al., 1982; Velasco et al., 1993) (Fig. 2B). Exactly the same pattern was obtained when the cells were grown in the presence of ITS medium alone in the absence (Fig. 2, C and D) or presence (Fig. 2, E and F) of GalNAc/Gal. The recycling experiments described below had to be conducted in the presence of cycloheximide, and it was, therefore, important to show that inhibition of protein synthesis had no effect on the distribution of Myc-GlcNAc-T I. Treatment with cycloheximide alone for 8 h had no effect (data not shown) and neither did a 4-h treatment continued for a further 4 h in the presence of GalNAc/Gal (Fig. 2, G and H). In addition, no Myc-GlcNAc-T I was detected to be secreted into the medium (data not shown) under all conditions.Figure 2Localization of Myc-GlcNAc-T I in ldlD cells by immunofluorescence microscopy. Cells were grown for 3 days in either ITS containing dFCS (panelsA and B) or ITS alone (panelsC and D). The latter were then treated for 4 h with GalNAc/Gal (panelsE and F) or for 8 h with cycloheximide (CHX), the last 4 h of which were in the presence of GalNAc/Gal (panelsG and H). Cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and double-labeled for Myc-GlcNAc-T I (panelsA, C, E, and G) and mannosidase II (MannII, panelsB, D, F, and H). Magnification, 60×.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These results were both confirmed and extended by immunogold microscopy on cryosections. For cells grown in the presence of dFCS alone (Fig. 3A) or in the presence of GalNAc/Gal with (Fig. 3D) or without (Fig. 3C) cycloheximide, the results were indistinguishable. Labeling was restricted to stacked Golgi cisternae, and between two and four adjacent cisternae were labeled. There was no significant labeling over any other structure in the cell. Quantitation showed that the level of labeling was also very similar, the average labeling density over Golgi stacks only varying between 24 and 28 gold particles/μm2 (Table 2).Figure 3Localization of Myc-GlcNAc-T I in ldlD cells by immunoelectron microscopy. Cells were grown for 3 days in either ITS containing dFCS (panelA) or ITS alone (panelB). The latter was then treated for 4 h with GalNAc/Gal (panelC) or treated for 8 h with cycloheximide, the last 4 h of which were in the presence of GalNAc/Gal (panelD). Cells were then fixed, frozen, sectioned, and labeled with 9E10 antibodies followed by rabbit anti-mouse antibody coupled to 10 nm of gold.

In these cells, the Golgi membranes appeared to be less cisternal and more tubulo-reticular (Fig. 3B). Golgi stacks were present (inset to Fig. 3B) in about 30% of the cells. The density of gold particle labeling over the Golgi stack was only just over half that of the other samples (Table 2). However, this did not mean that Myc-GlcNAc-T I had been lost from the Golgi apparatus because the density of labeling over the entire Golgi region, including the tubular and vesicular structures closely associated with the stacks, was very similar for all the samples (Table 2). The glycosylation state of Golgi proteins may, therefore, affect the morphology of the stack, but it did not change the level or Golgi location of Myc-GlcNAc-T I.Recycling of Myc-GlcNAc-T ICells grown in ITS medium were incubated with cycloheximide for 4 h, sufficient time to chase any newly synthesized Myc-GlcNAc-T I to the Golgi region. Incubation was then continued in the presence of cycloheximide for up to 4 h in the presence or absence of GalNAc/Gal. Samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and blotted, and the Myc-GlcNAc-T I was detected using the 9E10 antibody.Addition of GalNAc/Gal resulted in the disappearance of the unglycosylated form of the protein and the appearance of the immature form. This was followed by the appearance of the mature form with a half-time of about 150 min (Fig. 4A). Treatment with neuraminidase showed that the mature form had acquired sialic acid residues (Fig. 4B). In the absence of GalNAc/Gal, the levels of unglycosylated and immature forms of the protein were generally unaffected over the time of incubation, although occasionally a slight increase in the immature form was noted (data not shown).Since the acquisition of mature O-linked oligosaccharides was not accompanied by any change in the steady state localization of Myc-GlcNAc-T I (Fig. 3), this suggested that the Myc-GlcNAc-T I was undergoing retrograde transport to the CGN and anterograde transport back to the Golgi stack. If true, then this process should be sensitive to inhibitors of vesicular transport. NEM inhibits the fusion of transport vesicles with their target membranes (Glick and Rothman, 1987), and, as shown in Fig. 5(lanes3 and 4), it almost completely abolished the formation of mature Myc-GlcNAc-T I. Okadaic acid caused vesiculation of the Golgi apparatus and an inhibition of intracellular transport (Lucocq et al., 1991). It also abolished the formation of mature Myc-GlcNAc-T I (Fig. 5, lanes5 and 6).Figure 5Inhibition of vesicular transport prevents the addition of O-linked oligosaccharides. After growth for 3 days in ITS medium, cycloheximide was added followed by either mock treatment (lanes1 and 2) or treatment with NEM (lanes3 and 4) or okadaic acid (lanes5 and 6). The cells were then chased for 4 h in the absence (lanes1, 3, and 5) or presence (lanes2, 4, and 6) of GalNAc/Gal. The molecular masses on the left indicate the unglycosylated (51 kDa) and mature (55 kDa) forms of Myc-GlcNAc-T I. A doublet was reproducibly obtained in the presence of NEM, but the identity of the lower molecular mass form is unclear.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThere are two assumptions implicit in the experiments just described. The first is that GlcNAc-T I, lacking O-linked oligosaccharides, is correctly assembled and transported to the Golgi stack. There is evidence to suggest that this is the case (Kozarsky et al., 1988; Wertz et al., 1989), but a more rigorous demonstration was deemed necessary because a modified version of GlcNAc-T I had to be used, since antibodies were not available to the endogenous protein.GlcNAc-T I was chosen because it possesses only one type of oligosaccharide, which simplifies analysis, and because O-linked oligosaccharides are added post-translationally, after or during the latter stages of the folding process. This minimizes the possibility that GlcNAc-T I will fold incorrectly in the absence of GalNAc and Gal and be rapidly degraded. The suitability of this choice was confirmed by pulse-chase (data not shown) and Western blotting experiments, which estimated the half-life of the unglycosylated and mature proteins at about 10 h, not too dissimilar from the 10-20 h that characterizes the half-life of other Golgi proteins (Strous and Berger, 1982; Yuan et al., 1987). More importantly, the transfected cells were shown to have ~10 times the activity of GlcNAc-T I when compared to the parental cell line. Catalytic activity is probably the most sensitive measure of correct folding. The specific activity of Myc-GlcNAc-T I was also not affected by the absence of O-linked oligosaccharides, arguing strongly that they play no role in correct assembly or functioning of the protein.The location of Myc-GlcNAc-T I was assessed by both immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. Myc-GlcNAc-T I was localized to a compact juxtanuclear reticulum that characterizes the Golgi apparatus in animal cells (Louvard et al., 1982). The protein also colocalized exactly with an endogenous Golgi marker, mannosidase II. At the electron microscopic level, the protein was found exclusively in the Golgi region. There was no significant labeling over the ER or plasma membrane.Though both forms of Myc-GlcNAc-T I were present in the Golgi region, it was clear that the lack of sugars changed the morphology of the Golgi stack. Stacked cisternae were only present in around 30% of the cells, but in all the rest of the cells, the Golgi was a more tubulo-reticular structure, suggesting that the oligosaccharides bound to resident proteins might play a structural role in the organization of the Golgi stack. The simplest idea is to suggest that they contribute toward a lumenal Golgi matrix that serves to keep the central portions of cisternae apart. In their absence, apposing cisternal membranes would touch, thereby triggering periplasmic fusion and the formation of a tubulo-reticular structure. These ideas are more fully explored in a recent review (Rothman and Warren, 1994). For the present purposes, it is sufficient that the Myc-GlcNAc-T I is restricted to the Golgi complex region and physically separated from the GalNAc-T that initiates synthesis of O-linked oligosaccharides.The physical separation of Myc-GlcNAc-T I and GalNAc-T is the second assumption implicit in these experiments. Most work places GlcNAc-T I in the medial/trans cisternae and GalNAc-T in the CGN, though some recent data show that GalNAc-T can be present in the cis cisterna in some cells (Roth et al., 1994). Golgi enzymes are mostly found in two adjacent cisternae, but small amounts are found in flanking cisternae. If this is true for GlcNAc-T, then the results could be explained by the presence of small amounts of this enzyme in medial/trans cisternae. Addition of GalNAc/Gal could have led to slow maturation of Myc-GlcNAc-T I without the need for it to recycle via the CGN.To demonstrate that this was not occurring and that the maturation of Myc-GlcNAc-T I required vesicular transport, we investigated the effects of several transport inhibitors. Both anterograde (Rothman, 1994) and retrograde (Letourner et al., 1994) transport through the Golgi stack is mediated by COP I-coated vesicles, which bud from one cisterna and fuse with the next on the pathway. Fusion of these vesicles with their target membrane can be inhibited by pretreatment with NEM, which inactivates the general fusion protein, NSF (NEM-sensitive factor) (Glick and Rothman, 1987). Fusion is also inhibited during mitosis (Misteli and Warren, 1994) and leads to the fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus (Warren, 1993). Fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus can be mimicked by the addition of okadaic acid (Lucocq et al., 1991).Both NEM and okadaic acid completely prevented the maturation of Myc-GlcNAc-T I. It is, of course, possible that these drugs affected the enzymes (and sugar transporters) involved in the oligosaccharide maturation process, but this seems unlikely given the differences in their chemical structure and mode of action. NEM acts on thiol residues, whereas okadaic acid specifically (and non-covalently) inhibits protein phosphatases 1 and 2A (Cohen et al., 1990). Furthermore, NEM has been shown to have no effect on the processing of both N- and O-linked oligosaccharides bound to either proteins (Glick and Rothman, 1987; Rothman, 1987) or glycolipids (Wattenberg, 1990). Okadaic acid has been shown to have no effect on the addition of dolichol oligosaccharides to newly synthesized proteins in the ER (Lucocq et al., 1991). Taken together, these data suggest that the observed addition of O-linked oligosaccharides to Myc-GlcNAc-T I is the consequence of recycling via the CGN.The half-time for recycling of Myc-GlcNAc-T I as measured by the acquisition of O-linked oligosaccharides was about 150 min. Newly synthesized Myc-GlcNAc-T I matured with a half-life of 15-20 min (data not shown), and other work has shown that about half of this time is usually involved in anterograde transport through the Golgi stack (Green et al., 1981). This means that the half-time for retrograde transport to the CGN was about 140 min. At first sight, this is inconsistent with the conversion of unglycosylated Myc-GlcNAc-T I to the immature form, the half-time of which was about 5-10 min. There is, however, evidence to suggest that there is an additional unglycosylated form of Myc-GlcNAc-T I, which has almost the same molecular mass as the immature form (52 kDa). Despite intensive efforts by us and others, 2Harry Schachter, personal communication. we have not been able to define the modification that generates this other form, but it does more readily explain why most incubations in the absence of GalNAc/Gal yielded two forms of Myc-GlcNAc-T I.In summary, we have shown that unglycosylated Myc-GlcNAc-T I resides in the Golgi in ldlD cells starved of GalNAc/Gal. Upon addition of these sugars, the protein acquires O-linked oligosaccharides with a half-time of several hours. Acquisition of the sugars is prevented by inhibitors of vesicular traffic, suggesting that the protein is transported first to the CGN and then back to the Golgi stack. Further work is still needed to confirm a role for vesicle-mediated transport, but this system should provide a convenient means of studying recycling pathways within the Golgi apparatus.

No signals are needed for proteins to move from one compartment to the next along the exocytic pathway (Pfeffer and Rothman, 1987; Pryer et al., 1992; Rothman and Orci, 1992). Signals are needed to divert proteins in the trans Golgi network (TGN) to organelles such as the lysosomes (Kornfeld and Mellman, 1989) and secretory granules (Bauerfeind and Huttner, 1993). They are also needed to localize proteins to particular compartments on the exocytic pathway. These signals are of two types: retention signals and retrieval signals (Nilsson and Warren, 1994). Retention signals provide the primary means of localizing a protein to a particular compartment. The best characterized are those located in the membrane-spanning domain (and flanking sequences) of Golgi enzymes, though the precise manner in which they work has still to be elucidated (Bretscher and Munro, 1993; Nilsson et al., 1993b). Retrieval signals have been identified on soluble proteins in the ER (Munro and Pelham, 1987) and on membrane proteins both in the ER (Nilsson et al., 1989; Jackson et al., 1993; Schutze et al., 1994) and the TGN (Bos et al., 1993; Humphrey et al., 1993; Wong and Hong, 1993). These function to return proteins to their correct compartments after they have left them. The act of leaving may reflect the limitations of the retention mechanism in which case retrieval is a salvage process (Warren, 1987). Alternatively, it may reflect the transport process, which requires reusable proteins to package and deliver cargo to the next compartment. In this case, retrieval is a recycling process (Pelham, 1989).In one case, that of TGN38 (Ponnambalam et al., 1994), a retention signal has been identified in the membrane-spanning domain and a retrieval signal in the cytoplasmic tail. This suggests that all proteins along the exocytic pathway might be equipped in this manner, with the membrane-spanning domain providing the primary means of localizing the protein and the retrieval signal acting to return the protein should it either deliberately or accidentally leave the compartment in which it mostly resides.Retrieval signals have not yet been identified in resident Golgi enzymes, though there is some evidence that they are retrieved from later compartment(s). Mannosidase II, for example, is present in medial/trans cisternae in most cells (Velasco et al., 1993), yet the bound oligosaccharides are modified by sulfate residues (Moremen and Touster, 1985), a modification that is restricted to the TGN (Baeuerle and Huttner, 1987). Other Golgi proteins have also been shown to contain oligosaccharides that suggest passage beyond the point at which they normally reside (Yuan et al., 1987; Gonatas et al., 1989; Johnston et al., 1994; Alcalde et al., 1994). It is, however, possible that these modifications are caused not by recycling but by the presence of small amounts of the oligosaccharide-modifying enzymes in compartments other than those in which they mostly reside. We have shown recently that enzymes involved in the construction of complex N-linked oligosaccharides are mostly present in two adjacent cisternae, but small amounts are present in flanking cisternae (Nilsson et al., 1993a).We set out to devise a system that would measure the retrieval of a resident Golgi enzyme. We exploited the properties of a Chinese hamster ovary cell line (ldlD) generated by Krieger and colleagues (Kingsley et al., 1986), which lacks the epimerase activity needed to synthesize Gal and GalNAc from glucose precursors. The consequence is that synthesis of O-linked oligosaccharides cannot be initiated, and N-linked oligosaccharides are truncated at the point where terminal Gal would have been added. These defects are rapidly reversed by the addition of exogenous Gal and GalNAc.The synthesis of O-linked oligosaccharides is initiated in the CGN (Tooze et al., 1988; Niemann et al., 1982; Krijnse-Locker et al., 1994) and the cis cisterna of the Golgi stack (Roth, 1984; Deschyyteneer et al., 1988; Roth et al., 1994) by the addition of GalNAc to serine or threonine residues. The CGN (Huttner and Tooze, 1989; Hsu et al., 1991; Pelham, 1989), also known as the intermediate (Saraste and Kuismanen, 1984; Schweizer et al., 1990) or salvage compartment (Warren, 1987), receives the entire output of newly synthesized proteins from the ER and delivers them to the cis cisterna of the Golgi stack. This includes newly synthesized enzymes that reside in the Golgi stack. We focused on GlcNAc-T I, both because it resides in the medial/trans cisternae in most cells (Velasco et al., 1993) and it contains only O-linked and not N-linked oligosaccharides (Kumar et al. (1990) and this paper), a feature that considerably simplified analysis.We reasoned that, in the absence of exogenous GalNAc and Gal, GlcNAc-T I, lacking O-linked oligosaccharides, would be delivered to the Golgi stack. Evidence in support of this assertion comes from the kinetics of maturation of the human respiratory syncitial virus in ldlD cells (Wertz et al., 1989). In the absence of exogenous GalNAc and Gal, the bound oligosaccharides of the human respiratory syncitial virus G protein are chased into an endoglycosidase H-resistant form. This can only occur if GlcNAc-T I is active and located in the Golgi apparatus. After delivery of the unglycosylated GlcNAc-T I to the Golgi stack, Gal and GalNAc would be added to restore the synthesis of O-linked oligosaccharides. If GlcNAc-T I recycled and the salvage pathway involved passage back through the CGN and the cis cisterna, GalNAc would be added, followed by Gal and sialic acid once the enzyme reached its original location in the medial/trans part of the stack. Here, we show that GlcNAc-T I did acquire these sugars and that this was prevented by inhibitors of vesicle-mediated traffic."

The regulation of the neurotransmitter concentration in the synaptic cleft is an important component of the synaptic transmission process(1Balcar V.J. Johnston G.A.R. J.

They show significant similarities ranging between 27 and 32% to the proton L-glutamate transporter protein (GLTP) of Escherichia coli(10Tolner B. Poolman B. Wallace B. Konings W.N. J.

Jording D. Kapp D. Pühler A. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5551-5560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Models proposed for the membrane integration of the glutamate transporters show a consensus regarding six N-terminal transmembrane helices with a large extracellular loop between the proposed transmembrane helices 3 and 4. We have shown that two of three putative N-glycosylation sites of GLAST-1 localized in this extracellular loop are N-glycosylated. These sites are also common to GLT-1, EAAC1, and ASCT1, and it is reasonable to suggest that they are glycosylated in a similar manner(12Conradt M. Storck T. Stoffel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 682-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the topology of the highly conserved C-terminal part of the protein awaits experimental clarification(13Kanner B.I. FEBS Lett. 1993; 325: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The cloned transporter GLAST-1 cotransports glutamate with three sodium ions across the plasma membrane, whereas one potassium ion is countertransported out of the cell(14Klöckner U. Storck T.

It is reasonable to assume that charged or polar residues of the glutamate transporter are involved in the binding and translocation of glutamate and its cosubstrates. Mutagenesis has been carried out on Lys-298 and His-326 of the glutamate transporter GLT1. Substitution of these two residues with polar and positively charged residues leads (in the case of Lys-298) to a reduced transport activity, which has been interpreted as a targeting defect, whereas the severely impaired transport by GLT-1 mutated at His-326 has been referred to a participation of His-326 in the putative proton translocation process of the transporter(19Zhang Y.

In the present study, we analyzed the contribution of positively charged or polar residues of GLAST-1 to the binding and/or transport of the negatively charged neurotransmitter glutamate. We considered charged or polar residues of GLAST-1, which are conserved throughout the eukaryotic and prokaryotic glutamate transporters but are replaced in the neutral amino acid transporter by apolar residues. These residues were substituted by the amino acid residues present at the respective sites of the sequence of ASCT1. We determined the Km values for glutamate and Na+ and measured the voltage dependence of these mutant GLAST-1 in the Xenopus oocyte system.

GLAST-1 mutants Y405F and R479T and the quadruple mutant R122I,R280V,Y405F,R479T (Q) revealed that Tyr-405 and Arg-479 are essential for glutamate transport activity.

Primer SP-EcoRV (5′-CAGCAAATGAGATCTCTGGAAC-3′), which eliminates a unique EcoRV site in the 3′-untranslated region of rat GLAST-1 cDNA but creates a unique BglII site served as selection primer in all mutagenesis reactions. Four mutant oligonucleotides replaced the codons as follows: Arg-122 by Ile (R122I), GGAAGATGGGGATGATAGCTGTGGTC; Arg-280 by Val (R280V), GCCATCATGGTATTGGTAGCGGTG; Tyr-405 by Phe (Y405F), GGACCGCCCTCTTCGAAGCTTGGC; and Arg-479 by Thr (R479T), GGACCGCCTCACAACCACCACCAACG. The four resulting mutated cDNAs were subcloned into pSP-GLAST, and the nucleotide sequences of the subcloned DNA fragments between the sites of the used restriction enzymes were determined.

Wild-type and mutant pSP-GLAST-1 cDNA were linearized with EcoRI. The respective cRNAs were synthesized from their corresponding templates using SP6 RNA polymerase. Stage V-VI oocytes were defolliculated with collagenase and injected with 40 nl of cRNA (0.5 μg/μl). cRNA preparation and injection of the oocytes has been described previously(7Storck T. Schulte S.

The oocytes were washed three times with 1 ml of Barth's modified saline, homogenized in 0.1 ml of 1% SDS, and transferred into 10 ml of Bray's solution. Radioactivity was determined in a Beckman liquid scintillation counter. Electrogenic transport was assayed by voltage clamp using the two electrode voltage clamp amplifier. Briefly, oocytes were voltage clamped at −90 mV and continuously superfused with Barth's modified saline. Microelectrodes filled with 3 M KCl had a resistance ranging from 1-2 MΩ. In experiments in which the [Na+] of the bath solution was varied, Na+ was equimolarly substituted by choline. The data of the concentration response curves were fitted by non-linear regression to minimize the squared errors to the Hill equation I = Imax× [S]n/([S]n+ Kmn), where Imax is the normalized maximal current, [S] the substrate concentration, Km the apparent affinity constant, and n the cooperativity parameter. Data were expressed as mean ± S.D. Oocytes were injected with GLAST-1-specific cRNAs and incubated in Barth's modified saline containing [35S]methionine (2.5 mCi/ml) for 24 h. Oocytes were further processed for immunoprecipitation of wild-type and mutant GLAST-1 as described before(12Conradt M. Storck T. Stoffel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 682-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Proteins were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) followed by fluorography(25Bonner W.M. Laskey R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 46: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (5622) Google Scholar). Oocytes were embedded in Tissue-Tek® OC at −20°C 24-72 h after injection of wild-type, mutant cRNA, or H2O as control. 12-μm sections were prepared. They were fixed at room temperature with 1% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min (PBS: 6.5 mM Na2HPO4, 1.45 mM KH2PO4 (pH 7.2), 136 mM NaCl, 2.68 mM KCl), washed three times with PBS for 5 min, and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS at 4°C for 1 h. Sections were incubated for 1.5 h at 4°C with anti-GLAST antibody in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS, washed five times with PBS for 5 min, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with fluorescein 5′-isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. After washing the sections five times with PBS for 10 min, they were sealed with coverslips, examined with a Zeiss Axioscope fluorescence microscope, and photographed with a Zeiss MC 100 microscope camera. U. S. E. mutagenesis kit was purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. T4 DNA ligase, SP6 polymerase, and restriction enzymes were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. or Boehringer Mannheim. L-[14C]Glutamate and L-[14C]alanine was from Amersham Corp. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-goat anti-rabbit IgG and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B were purchased from Sigma. The voltage clamp amplifier of Warner Instruments Corp. and the hardware and software package ISO2 from MFK (Frankfurt) were used in the whole cell voltage clamp experiments. The amino acid sequences of the known mammalian glutamate transporters GLAST-1, GLT-1, and EAAC1 and the prokaryotic dicarboxylate transporter DCTA of R. meliloti on the one hand and the neutral amino acid transporter ASCT1 on the other exhibit remarkable similarity (Fig. 1). There are three conserved positively charged arginines (Arg-122, −280, and −479) and the polar Tyr-405, common to the glutamate transporter, that are replaced by apolar residues in the ASCT1 sequence. They are marked by filledcircles in Fig. 1. We used site-directed mutagenesis for the substitution of Arg-122 (R122I), Arg-280 (R280V), Tyr-405 (Y405F), and Arg-479 (R479T) of GLAST-1 by the corresponding amino acid residues of the ASCT1 sequence: Ile, Val, Phe, and Thr, respectively. The double mutant R122I,R280V and the quadruple mutant Q were constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The mutations were verified by DNA sequencing and transcribed in vitro to their respective cRNAs. Wild-type and mutant GLAST-1 cRNAs were micro-injected for functional expression in Xenopus oocytes in the presence of [35S]methionine. The autoradiogram of labeled wild-type and mutant GLAST-1 protein immunoprecipitated with GLAST-1-specific antibodies (7Storck T. Schulte S. Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10955-10959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar) and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is shown in Fig. 2. Wild-type GLAST-1 cRNA was translated into a protein visible with an apparent molecular mass of 60-65 kDa (lane2), whereas water-injected control oocytes expressed no immunoprecipitable protein (lane1). The expression rate of the mutant transporter cRNAs are similar (lanes3-8). Therefore, the amino acid exchanges have no influence on the expression efficiency and the stability of the proteins. The expressed GLAST-1 (12Conradt M. Storck T. Stoffel W. Eur. J.

To investigate the influence of the positively charged residues on the affinity of GLAST-1 for L-glutamate, the apparent Km values of wild-type and mutant GLAST-1 were determined (Fig. 3A). At an extracellular Na+ concentration ([Na+]0) of 90 mM, the half-maximal current was obtained at a L-glutamate concentration of 21 ± 3 μM (n = 11), which is in good agreement with our previously published results(12Conradt M. Storck T. Stoffel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 682-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The affinity for L-glutamate of the mutant transporters R122I, R280V, and R122I,R280V showed no significant differences and had apparent Km values of 22.5 ± 2.5 μM (n = 4), 18 ± 4 μM (n = 8), and 18 ± 3 μM (n = 7), respectively. Likewise, the L-[14C]glutamate uptake experiments shown in Fig. 5B revealed that the transport velocity of L-glutamate seems not to be influenced significantly by the amino acid substitutions.Figure 5Functional characterization of the mutant transporters Y405F and R479T. A, original traces recorded at indicated L-Glu concentrations. Superfusion of oocytes expressing Y405F, R479T, and Q with 500 μML-Glu evoked no detectable currents in contrast to wild-type GLAST-1-expressing oocytes. [L-Glu] up to 500 mM revealed the same results (data not shown). B, L-[14C]glutamate uptake mediated by wild-type GLAST-1 and mutant transporters. The L-[14C]glutamate uptake rates of R122I and R280V and the double mutant R122I,R280V are quite similar as compared to the L-[14C]glutamate uptake of wild-type GLAST-1. Y405F, R479T, and the quadruple mutant Q-expressing oocytes show L-[14C]glutamate uptake rates similar to water-injected controls. C, L-[14C]alanine uptake by wild-type GLAST-1 and mutant transporters is similar to the water-injected control oocytes. Each column represents the mean ± S.D. (n = 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We studied the Na+ dependence of the mutant transporters to probe for electrostatic forces between the sodium ion and the two positively charged arginines. Inward currents were recorded at stepwise increased [Na+]0 and constant L-Glu concentration (100 μM). Currents were fitted to a Hill equation, which yielded Km values for Na+of wild type and the double mutant R122I,R280V of 32 ± 3 mM (n = 6) and 29 ± 5 mM (n = 4), respectively (Fig. 3B). The values of the mutant transporter R122I and R280V for Na+ are neither significantly affected (R122I, 36 ± 5 mM, n = 4; R280V, 31 ± 1 mM, n = 2). Glutamate transport is thought to be associated with conformational changes within the electrical transmembrane field. The influence of positively charged side chains as compared to neutral amino acid residues on the voltage dependence of the transport process has been explored in the experiment depicted in Fig. 3C. The peak currents of wild type and the double mutant R122I,R280V were plotted as a function of voltage. The resulting curves are roughly superimposed. This suggests that the elimination of two positive charges at amino acid positions 122 and 280 of GLAST-1 has no detectable effect on the voltage dependence of the transport process. The results for the mutants R122I and R280V were quite similar (data not shown). However, the expressed mutant GLAST-1 transporters R122I and R280V as well as the resulting double mutant show a significant decrease (paired t test, p < 0.05) in the apparent Km value for the competitive inhibitor THA from 22 ± 6 μM (n = 6) for wild-type GLAST-1 to 10 ± 2 μM (n = 6), 11 ± 3 μM (n = 6), 10 ± 2 μM (n = 6) for R122I, R280V and R122I,R280V, respectively (Fig. 4A). The increase of the apparent affinity for L-aspartate is similar as to the value for THA (Fig. 4B). The Km value for L-aspartate of wild-type GLAST-1 is 14.5 ± 2 μM (n = 4) and 9.5 ± 0.9 μM (n = 4) (significant smaller paired t test, p < 0.05) for the double mutant R122I,R280V. L-[14C]Alanine uptake experiments shown in Fig. 5C and electrophysiological measurements (data not shown) revealed that substitution of Arg-122 and 280 by Ile and Val, respectively does not enable GLAST-1 to transport neutral amino acids (Ala, Ser, Cys, and Thr) with a higher efficiency than the controls. The transporter mutants (Y405F, R479T, and Q) exhibited no detectable glutamate transport activity. Fig. 5A shows that superfusion of oocytes with L-[Glu]o up to 500 μM evoked no detectable current in the oocytes expressing the mutagenized transporters Y405F, R479T, or Q. Additionally the L-[14C]glutamate uptake measurements depicted in Fig. 5B revealed that substitution of Tyr-405 (mutant GLAST-1 Y405F) and Arg-479 (mutant GLAST-1 R479T) by Phe and Thr, respectively abolishes glutamate transport activity. Furthermore, we assayed neutral amino acid transport activity of the mutant transporters Y405F, R479T, and Q by L-[14C]alanine uptake experiments (Fig. 5C) and whole cell patch clamp recordings (data not shown). The two techniques revealed that there is no enhanced neutral amino acid transport activity as compared to the wild type. The loss of glutamate uptake activity by oocytes expressing the GLAST-1 mutants Y405F, R479T, and Q might have several reasons: 1) a reduced expression level or stability of the mutant transporters, 2) impaired targeting of the mutated transporters to the plasma membrane, and 3) the substituted tyrosine 405 and arginine 479 have important intrinsic function in the transport process. The first possibility was ruled out by comparison of the [35S]methionine-labeled translation products of wild-type and mutant GLAST-1 expressed in the Xenopus oocyte. The immunoprecipitation of the recombinant transporters revealed that their expression level is comparable to the wild type (Fig. 2). The targeting of the transporters to the plasma membrane was analyzed by immunostaining of oocyte sections using rabbit anti-GLAST-1-peptide antibodies as a first antibody and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody. The results of the immunofluorescence studies are presented in Fig. 6. In oocytes expressing wild-type GLAST-1 or mutants Y405F, R479T, or Q (Fig. 6, B, C, D, and E, respectively) a bright ring of fluorescence with similar intensity was observed at the perimeter of the oocytes, consistent with the localization of the transporter at or close to the cell surface. No accumulation of fluorescent-labeled proteins was detectable within the cell. In the case of water-injected control oocytes, no fluorescence was observed (Fig. 6A). The immunocytochemistry clearly indicates that the mutant transporters are correctly targeted to the plasma membrane. Therefore, Tyr-405 and Arg-479 might play an essential role in glutamate transport. The recently discovered three L-glutamate transporters of central nervous system (7Storck T. Schulte S. Hofmann K.

They exhibit significant similarity to the prokaryotic proton L-glutamate transporter protein (GLTP) (10Tolner B. Poolman B. Wallace B. Konings W.N. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2391-2393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to dicarboxylate transporter (DCTA)(11Engelke T. Jording D. Kapp D. Pühler A. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5551-5560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The hydropathy plots of the related eukaryotic transporters suggest a conserved membrane topology implicating a similar transport mechanism(26Kanai Y. Smith C.P. Hediger M.A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1450-1459Google Scholar). The striking difference between the substrates of the neutral (e.g. alanine) and the acidic amino acid transporters (e.g. glutamate and aspartate) is the negatively charged carboxy group of the acidic neurotransmitter. Intriguing amino acid residues important for the recognition and discrimination of the different substrates are positively charged or polar. The amino acid residues Arg-122, Arg-280, Tyr-405, and Arg-479 are conserved throughout the eukaryotic and prokaryotic glutamate transporters. They are substituted by apolar residues in the neutral amino acid transporter ASCT1 (Fig. 1). In the study described here, we exchanged these amino acid residues of GLAST-1 for the residues of the neutral amino acid transporter ASCT1. The mutants R122I and R280V as well as the double mutant R122I,R280V expressed in the Xenopus oocyte system show no significant differences in their apparent affinity for L-Glu and their Na+ and voltage dependence. GLAST-1 mutants R122I and R280V and the double mutant do not transport any substrate of the neutral amino acid carrier. This argues against a contribution of Arg-122 and Arg-280 to the substrate specificity of GLAST-1. Interestingly, the apparent Km values for aspartate and the competitive inhibitor THA are decreased significantly. Arg-122 and Arg-280 are positioned at the boundaries between the putative intracellular hydrophilic loops and transmembrane domains 3 and 5, respectively. Although Arg-122 and −280 seem to be localized intracellularly, we included these residues in our investigations because transport is possibly mediated by conformational changes sequentially exposing the substrate binding site to the external and internal surfaces of the protein(27Mori H. Hashiramoto M. Clark A.E. Yang Y. Muraoka A. Tamori Y. Kasuga M. Holman G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11578-11583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Radding W. J. Theor. Biol. 1991; 150: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Charged residues frequently border hydrophobic regions of integral membrane proteins and thus contribute to their correct positioning within the membrane(29von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3021-3027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A conformational change evoked by the lack of the charged residues in the mutant transporters might facilitate the transport of the less bulky substrates THA and aspartate in contrast to glutamate. In contrast to Arg-122 and −280, which are localized in the N-terminal part of GLAST-1, Tyr-405 and Arg-479 are positioned in the C-terminal part of the protein. The topology of the C terminus derived from hydropathy plots is undefined(13Kanner B.I. FEBS Lett. 1993; 325: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 26Kanai Y. Smith C.P. Hediger M.A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1450-1459Google Scholar). Therefore, predictions concerning the extra- or intracellular localization of Tyr-405 or Arg-479 are not possible. The C-terminal domain between residues 360-497 is highly conserved, which might indicate a functional importance of this region. This is supported by our data. Substitution of the Tyr-405 and the Arg-479 by Phe and Thr, which are the respective amino acid residues of the neutral amino acid transporter ASCT1, completely abolished L-glutamate transport. Since the expression level of the mutant transporter and the targeting to the plasma membrane is unimpaired (Fig. 2 Fig. 3 Fig. 4 Fig. 5 and Fig. 6), our results strongly suggest that Tyr-405 and Arg-479 are essential for the glutamate transport process. A drawback to mutagenesis studies might be conformational changes of the protein introduced by amino acid substitution, which could complicate the interpretation of the direct role of the amino acid residue in the binding and transport of glutamate. The exchange of Tyr for Phe is nearly conservative. In addition, Phe (Y405F) as well as Thr (R479T) represent amino acids that are localized at identical positions in a highly conserved region of the related neutral amino acid transporter exhibiting a similar hydropathy plot. These facts argue against conformational changes of the affected protein domains. Our interpretation is supported by modeling studies on the Clostridium symbiosum glutamate dehydrogenase structure. They implicate interactions of the γ-carboxylate group of glutamate with the β-OH of Ser-380 and Thr-193 and the ϵ-NH3+ of Lys-89(30Baker J.P. Britton K.L. Engel P.C. Farrants G.W. Lilley K.S. Rice D.W. Stillman D.W. Protein Struct. Funct. Genet. 1992; 12: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). This is in line with our results that the hydroxy group of Tyr-405 and the positively charged Arg-479 are essential for glutamate transport. It is conceivable that these amino acid residues, strongly conserved in the glutamate transporters but not in the neutral amino acid transporter ASCT1, interact with the γ-carboxylate group of glutamate. The studies presented here provide new insights into the structure-function relationship of the glutamate transporter family. Further experiments will unravel the structural motifs involved in binding, substrate specificity, and translocation of the L-glutamate transporter.

Phosphopeptide mapping provided evidence for three phosphorylation sites on pp175, only one of which was labeled in response to isoproterenol treatment. The half-maximal effect of isoproterenol on phosphorylation of pp175 (≈20 nM) was in excellent agreement with its previously demonstrated up-regulatory effect on cotransport activity. Increased phosphorylation of pp175 was also seen following acinar treatment with a permeant cAMP analogue and with forskolin, conditions that have likewise been shown to up-regulate the cotransporter. Combined with earlier results from our laboratory, these data provide strong evidence that the up-regulation of the cotransporter by these agents is due to direct phosphorylation mediated by protein kinase A. AlF4− treatment, which results in an up-regulation of cotransport activity comparable with that observed with isoproterenol (∼6-fold), caused a similar increase in phosphorylation of pp175. However, hypertonic shrinkage and treatment with the protein phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A, which also up-regulate the cotransporter (∼3-fold and ∼6-fold, respectively) caused no change in the phosphorylation level. Furthermore, although acinar treatment with the muscarinic agonist carbachol results in a dramatic up-regulation of cotransport activity and a concomitant phosphorylation of pp175, no phosphorylation of pp175 was seen with the Ca2+-mobilizing agent thapsigargin, which is able to fully mimic the up-regulatory effect of carbachol on transport activity.

INTRODUCTIONBecause of its experimental accessibility, relative homogeneity and rich hormonal responsiveness, the rat parotid gland is rapidly becoming one of the more popular mammalian experimental models for the study of the mechanism(s) and regulation of epithelial fluid and electrolyte secretion(1Nauntofte B. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: G823-G837PubMed Google Scholar, 2Turner R.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 694: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Work from a number of laboratories has established that salt and water secretion by the acinar cells, which comprise the bulk of this gland, is due to transepithelial Cl− movement(1Nauntofte B. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: G823-G837PubMed Google Scholar, 2Turner R.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 694: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 3Petersen O.H. Maruyama Y. Nature. 1984; 307: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The active step in this process is Cl− entry across the acinar basolateral membrane, a large component of which has been shown to be due to Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransport(4Melvin J.E. Kawaguchi M. Baum B.J. Turner R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 145: 754-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 5Melvin J.E. Turner R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: G393-G398PubMed Google Scholar).Consistent with its important role in secretion, we have shown that the activity of the rat parotid Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter is regulated by a number of physiological and other potentially physiologically relevant stimuli. We first demonstrated a substantial (∼6-fold) up-regulation of cotransporter activity following β-adrenergic stimulation and provided good evidence that this was due to a phosphorylation event mediated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase(6Paulais M. Turner R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1142-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This up-regulation is paralleled in vivo by an increase in salivary flow seen when sympathetic (adrenergic) stimulation, arising, for example, from mastication, is superimposed on parasympathetic (muscarinic) stimulation(7Johnson D.J. Sreebny L.M. The Salivary System. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1987: 135-155Google Scholar), the main fluid secretory stimulus for the gland. In a later publication (8Paulais M. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21558-21563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) we demonstrated that the rat parotid Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter is up-regulated (again ∼6-fold) by aluminum fluoride (AlF4−), an activator of G-proteins, and by calyculin A, a protein phosphatase inhibitor. Based on several factors, including diverse sensitivity to blockade of up-regulation by protein kinase inhibitors and the observation that AlF4− does not induce cAMP generation in the rat parotid, we have argued that the mechanisms of action of AlF4− and calyculin A on the cotransporter are different from that of β-adrenergic stimulation and from one another(8Paulais M. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21558-21563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).More recently (9Evans R.L. Turner R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5 (abstr.): 116aGoogle Scholar) 1C. Ferri, R. L. Evans, M. Paulais, A. Tanimura, and R. J. Turner, submitted for publication. we have shown that Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransport activity in these cells is also increased by muscarinic stimulation (>15-fold) and by hypertonic shrinkage (∼3-fold). Our data suggest that these latter effects are also unrelated to one another and unrelated to the effect of β-adrenergic stimulation (see “Discussion”). At this time our understanding of these up-regulatory events is still incomplete, and the physiological significance of some of these stimuli remains to be determined. However, our results clearly demonstrate that the rat parotid Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter is under tight regulatory control, in all likelihood by multiple intracellular signaling pathways, and thus that it provides a particularly rich experimental system for the study of transport regulation by hormonal and other stimuli.In the present paper we explore these phenomena further by studying the effects of these various up-regulatory stimuli on the phosphorylation state of the Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransport protein itself. Although it is generally accepted that phosphorylation events play an important role in cellular signaling, relatively few studies have actually directly explored their possible involvement in the regulation of facilitative membrane transport proteins. We show here that there is a good correlation between increased transport activity and increased transporter phosphorylation following β-adrenergic stimulation and AlF4− treatment of rat parotid acini, suggesting that the regulation of the cotransporter by these stimuli is due to direct phosphorylation. Somewhat surprisingly, however, this was not the case for the other stimuli studied, in spite of the fact that some of these agents have been shown to increase both the transport activity and the phosphorylation state of Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporters in lower species(11Lytle C. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25438-25443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Torchia J. Yi Q. Sen A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29778-29784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations indicate that the Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter in the rat parotid is regulated both via direct phosphorylation and via other, as yet unidentified, mechanisms.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and MediaMale Wistar strain rats, weighing 250-300 g, were purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Indianapolis, IN).

Phosphatidylserine (number 840032, from bovine brain; supplied in chloroform) was from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). Molecular weight standards, prepoured 4-20% SDS-PAGE gels, and prepoured 16% Tricine gels were obtained from Novel Experimental Technology (San Diego, CA). Protein G-Sepharose beads were from Pierce. All other chemicals were from standard commercial sources and were reagent grade or the highest purity available.The digestion medium was Earle's minimum essential medium (Biofluids, Rockville, MD) containing 0.22 units/ml collagenase P, 2 mM glutamine, and 1% bovine serum albumin. The physiological salt solution (PSS) contained 135 mM NaCl, 5.8 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 0.8 mM MgSO4, 0.73 mM NaH2PO4, 11 mM glucose, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH), 2 mM glutamine, and 1% bovine serum albumin. The digestion medium and PSS were continuously gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2 and 100% O2, respectively. The stop solution for the 32Pi labeling studies contained 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH), 10 mM Na2ATP, 50 mM NaF, 15 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 100 μM sodium orthovanadate, 5 mM EDTA, 300 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μML-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, 1.5 μM pepstatin, and 1.5 μM leupeptin.Protein concentration was measured with the BCA protein assay system (Pierce).Preparation of Parotid AciniRats were anesthetized with diethyl ether and killed by cardiac puncture. The parotid glands were removed, dissected free of fat, and finely minced in a small volume of ice-cold digestion medium. The glands from two rats were suspended in 10 ml of digestion medium and incubated at 37°C with continuous agitation. The mince was dispersed by gently pipetteting 10 times with a 10-ml plastic pipette after 30 min and again after 45 min of digestion. The mince was then centrifuged (400 × g, 15 s), the supernatant was discarded and replaced with the same volume of fresh digestion medium, and incubation was continued. After a total of 60 min of digestion the mince was pipetted 10 times with a 10-ml pipette fitted with a Rainin RC-200 blue pipette tip (Rainin Instruments, Emeryville, CA). Finally at times 75 and 85 min the mince was pipetted five times with a 10-ml pipette fitted with a Rainin RT-96 yellow tip. The resulting suspension was centrifuged and resuspended in 10 ml of PO4−-free-PSS (PSS without NaH2PO4) and passed through a 450-μm nylon screen (PGC Scientific, Gaithersburg, MD). The material in the filtrate was collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 10 ml of fresh PO4−-free PSS, and recentrifuged, then resuspended in 3-4 ml of PO4−-free PSS.32PiLabeling and StimulationAcini were incubated at 37°C in PO4−-free-PSS in the presence of 50 μCi/ml 32Pi for 30 min. The suspension was then placed on the bench for 1-2 min to allow the acini to settle, and the supernatant was carefully removed and discarded. The remaining material was diluted to 10 ml with PSS, washed once in the same volume, and finally resuspended in 3-4 ml of PSS at room temperature.Aliquots (200 μl) of labeled cells were incubated with the agents indicated at 37°C in siliconized glass tubes (Sigmacote number SL-2; Sigma). The incubation was terminated by the addition of 800 μl of ice-cold stop solution and disruption by immersion in a Branson B-12 sonicator bath (Shelton, CT) as follows. Each sample was first sonicated for 30 s and then placed on ice. After disruption of all samples in this way, each sample was subsequently sonicated to clarity.Preparation of Membrane ExtractSonicated samples (1 ml total volume) were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting pellet was discarded. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. We refer to the supernatant and pellet from this high speed spin as the “cytosolic fraction” and the “particulate fraction,” respectively. The particulate fraction was resuspended in 0.7 ml of extraction buffer (stop solution containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and no NaCl) and kept on ice for 30 min. This sample was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant and pellet from this second high speed spin are referred to as the “Triton extract” and the “Triton-insoluble fraction” respectively. As shown below (see “Results”) the Triton extract was the only fraction that contained the phosphoprotein of interest (the Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter), and thus only this fraction was usually retained and analyzed.Gel Electrophoresis and AutoradiographySDS-PAGE was performed essentially as described by Laemmli (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205955) Google Scholar) using a 4% polyacrylamide stacking gel and a 4-20% (continuous gradient) polyacrylamide separating gel. Tricine-SDS (16%) electrophoresis was carried out according to Schagger and von Jagow(14Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10434) Google Scholar). Samples were heated at 100°C for 2 min in sample buffer containing 2.5% SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% glycerol, 100 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.04% bromphenol blue and centrifuged before electrophoresis. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and visualized by autoradiography using Kodak X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). Gels used in phosphopeptide mapping studies were washed twice for 15 min in 20% ethanol before drying to remove acetic acid. Autoradiographs were scanned using a Molecular Dynamics computing densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) to quantitate 32Pi labeling. Linearity of the densitometric scans was confirmed using autoradiographic 14C Micro-Scales (Amersham Corp.). Samples of Triton extract electrophoresed for quantitation of 32Pi labeling typically contained ∼15 μg of protein (the protein concentration of the Triton extract was ∼0.5 mg/ml).Production of Antiserum against Parotid Bumetanide Binding ProteinThe following method was used to produce sheep antiserum directed against a rabbit parotid bumetanide binding protein previously identified in our laboratory as the bumetanide moiety (and perhaps all) of the Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter in this tissue(15Reshkin S.J. Lee S.L. George J.N. Turner R.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 136: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Deglycosylated bumetanide binding protein (Mr∼135,000) was purified from rabbit parotid basolateral membranes as described previously(15Reshkin S.J. Lee S.L. George J.N. Turner R.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 136: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A suitable quantity of protein (100 μg for the first injection and 30-40 μg for subsequent injections) was diluted to 1 ml with phosphate-buffered saline and combined with 1 ml of complete (first injection) or incomplete (subsequent injections) Freund's adjuvant. Injections were carried out at the NIH Animal Care Center (Ungulate Section) in Poolesville, Maryland. The primary injection was subcutaneous, and subsequent injections (3, 8, 19, and 36 weeks later) were intramuscular; all injections were done at multiple sites. Anti-bumetanide binding protein antibody titer in serum samples was monitored by Western blot analysis against purified bumetanide binding protein and rabbit parotid basolateral membranes. In these samples the antiserum strongly labeled proteins of Mr 135,000 and 160,000-175,000, respectively. 3S. J. Reshkin, S. J. Tessler, M. L. Moore, and R. J. Turner, unpublished results. The range of molecular weights observed for the labeling of native membranes (160-175 kDa) was related to the gel system used. With the large format Bio-Rad gels used in our previous publication (15Reshkin S.J. Lee S.L. George J.N. Turner R.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 136: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) we observed an Mr of 160,000 (in this same publication we showed that the parotid bumetanide binding protein had a native Mr of 160,000 and a deglycosylated Mr of 135,000), while with the prepoured Novex minigels used in the present work we consistently observed a Mr of ∼175,000.Immunoprecipitation of 32Pi-Labeled ProteinsProtein G-Sepharose beads were prewashed twice with washing buffer (extraction buffer titrated to pH 8.6 with Tris and containing 0.1% SDS and 300 mM NaCl), once in low pH buffer (50 mM glycine-HCl, pH 2.3, containing 150 mM NaCl and 0.5% Triton X-100), and once in extraction buffer and then suspended in extraction buffer containing 1% ovalbumin.A 400-μl aliquot of Triton extract was incubated overnight at 4°C with immune or non-immune sheep serum (7 μl/100 μg of extract protein). Prewashed protein G-Sepharose beads (10 μl of beads/μl of serum) were then added. After 30 min of additional incubation, the beads were collected by centrifugation and washed six times with washing buffer. The tube was changed for the last spin. Protein retained by the washed beads was then eluted with 100 μl of electrophoresis sample buffer.Immunoprecipitation of [3H]Bumetanide Binding ActivityTriton extracts for bumetanide binding studies were prepared by a modification of the procedure given above. This modification was based on our previous observation that the bumetanide binding activity of the Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter could be preserved in detergent solutions by the addition of suitable exogenous lipids(16Turner R.J. George J.N. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 113: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 17Corcelli A. Turner R.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1991; 120: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The procedure was as follows. A “particulate fraction” was prepared as described above from cells that had not been labeled with 32Pi. However, instead of extraction buffer, the particulate fraction was resuspended in Buffer K (100 mM mannitol, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA, 195 mM potassium gluconate, and 5 mM KCl buffered to pH 7.4 with Tris). This material was centrifuged again at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in Buffer K at a protein concentration of 2.5-3.5 mg/ml, fast frozen in aliquots, and stored above liquid nitrogen. On the day of the bumetanide binding experiment, frozen samples were thawed and diluted with Buffer K to a protein concentration of 2 mg/ml. This suspension was mixed with the same volume of 0.6% Triton X-100 in Buffer K, left on ice for 10 min, and then transferred to a glass tube in which a suitable volume of phosphatidylserine (final concentration 0.15%) had been evaporated. This mixture was sonicated to clarity in a Branson B-12 bath sonicator (∼60-s immersion) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting supernatant, which is analogous to the “Triton extract” described above for 32Pi labeling studies, is referred to here as the “lipid-stabilized Triton extract.”Immunoprecipitation of [3H]bumetanide binding activity from the above lipid-stabilized Triton extracts was carried out using immune and nonimmune IgG preabsorbed onto protein G-Sepharose beads. This was done in order to avoid any possible interference of serum with the [3H]bumetanide binding assay and to allow quantitation of protein remaining after immunoprecipitation (see “Results”). Protein G beads were washed twice with Buffer K containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 0.15% phosphatidylserine (sonicated to clarity as above) and then resuspended in the same buffer containing 1% ovalbumin and incubated for 40 min with immune or nonimmune sheep serum (10 μl of beads/μl of serum; total volume ∼300 μl). The beads were then washed three times in Buffer K plus 0.3% Triton X-100 and 0.15% phosphatidylserine, added to the lipid-stabilized Triton extract (70 μl of beads/100 μg of extract protein), and incubated for 2 h at 4°C. After removal of the beads by centrifugation, [3H]bumetanide binding activity remaining in the resulting supernatant was determined by the method given below.[3H]Bumetanide Binding AssayEquilibrium bumetanide binding was measured using a nitrocellulose filtration assay as described previously(16Turner R.J. George J.N. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 113: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 18Turner R.J. George J.N. J. Membr. Biol. 1988; 102: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 20-μl aliquot of sample was combined with 20 μl of incubation medium consisting of either Buffer K containing 10 μCi/ml [3H]bumetanide or the same medium with all potassium replaced by Na+. After a 15-min incubation the reaction was terminated by the addition of ice-cold stop solution followed by Millipore filtration (HAWP 0.45 μm). Other procedures were as described previously(16Turner R.J. George J.N. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 113: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 18Turner R.J. George J.N. J. Membr. Biol. 1988; 102: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). [3H]bumetanide binding observed in the absence of Na+ was subtracted from that observed in its presence to yield the Na+-dependent component of binding. In previous studies (16Turner R.J. George J.N. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 113: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 18Turner R.J. George J.N. J. Membr. Biol. 1988; 102: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) we have demonstrated that this Na+-dependent component of binding represents the specific binding of bumetanide to its inhibitory site on the Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter.Phosphopeptide MappingTriton extracts for phosphopeptide mapping studies were prepared as described above for 32Pi-labeling studies, except that the extraction buffer contained 1% Triton X-100 and the protein concentration of the extract was ∼3 mg/ml. Following SDS-PAGE (∼90 μg of extracted protein/lane) the band corresponding to the Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter (pp175, see “Results”) was identified using autoradiography, cut from the dried gel, and swollen in 1 ml of a buffer containing 50 mM NH4HCO3 (pH 8.0), 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 20 μg/ml V8 protease. After 6 or 12 h of incubation at 37°C protease digestion was terminated by heating the sample to 100°C for 5 min. The liquid was set aside, and the gel slice was then sequentially incubated in 500 μl of distilled water for 2 h, 500 μl of distilled water for 1 h, 500 μl of 0.1% SDS for 1.5 h, and 500 μl of 0.1% SDS for 1 h. All of these samples were combined (total volume 3 ml) and dried in a Savant DNA Speed Vac (Savant Instruments Inc., Farmingdale, NY). This final V8 protease digest was then taken up in sample buffer and subjected to Tricine-SDS gel electrophoresis.Data AnalysisAll experiments were repeated three or more times with similar results. Data are given as means ± S.E.RESULTSEvidence for Isoproterenol-dependent Phosphorylation of the Rat Parotid Na+-K+-2Cl−CotransporterAs already mentioned, in a previously published report from our laboratory (6Paulais M. Turner R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1142-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) we demonstrated that the Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransport activity of rat parotid acini is markedly (∼6-fold) and rapidly (within 40 s) up-regulated following β-adrenergic stimulation. In addition, our data indicated that this effect was mediated by protein kinase A. The first series of experiments presented below were undertaken in order to determine whether this effect could be attributed to a direct phosphorylation of the cotransport protein. In the experiment illustrated in Fig. 1 we compare protein phosphorylation patterns in 32Pi-labeled rat parotid acini incubated for 45 s in the presence (+) or absence(-) of the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (1 μM). Following isoproterenol treatment the cells were disrupted, cytosolic (Cy) and particulate fractions were isolated, and the latter were further separated into Triton extracts (TE) and Triton-insoluble (TI) fractions (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Fig. 1 shows an autoradiograph of an SDS-PAGE gel on which these various fractions were run. After this short period of incubation with isoproterenol, clear differences in the phosphorylation patterns of only two proteins were seen. The first corresponds to a relatively sharp band at Mr∼95,000 in the autoradiographs of the cytosolic fractions (small arrow). This protein, whose phosphorylation is increased with isoproterenol treatment, is not considered further here. The second phosphoprotein appears as a rather diffuse band centered at Mr≈ 175,000 in the autoradiographs of the Triton extracts (large arrow); its phosphorylation state is likewise markedly increased by isoproterenol, and its presence in the Triton extract indicates that it is an integral membrane protein.A number of factors discussed in the remainder of the paper provide strong evidence that the 175-kDa phosphoprotein (pp175) identified above is (a major part or all of) the rat parotid Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter.Demonstration of a Strong Correlation between Phosphorylation of pp175 and cAMP-dependent Up-regulation of the Parotid Na+-K+-2Cl−CotransporterIn our previous report (6Paulais M. Turner R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1142-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) we demonstrated that the half-maximal effect of isoproterenol for up-regulation of the rat parotid Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter was seen at ∼20 nM, measured after 37.5 s of agonist incubation at 37°C. The dose response of isoproterenol for the phosphorylation of pp175, measured under essentially identical experimental conditions, is illustrated in Fig. 2A. The half-maximal effect of isoproterenol for phosphorylation is also seen at ∼20 nM, in excellent agreement with its effect on the up-regulation of cotransport activity.Figure 2Effects of isoproterenol concentration and cAMP on the phosphorylation of pp175. 32Pi-Labeled acini were exposed to the concentrations of stimuli indicated for 45 s at 37°C and then Triton-extracts were isolated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as in Fig. 1. The phosphorylation of the 175-kDa phosphoprotein (pp175) identified in Fig. 1 was quantified by scanning densitometry of the resulting autoradiographs. The pp175 phosphorylation determined in this way for each experimental condition has been normalized to the pp175 phosphorylation determined from a control (untreated) sample from the same preparation run on the same gel. The results shown are the means ± S.E. of three or more independent experiments. A, phosphorylation of pp175 versus isoproterenol (ISO) concentration. B, phosphorylation of pp175 after acinar treatment with isoproterenol, the permeant cAMP analogue dibutyryl cAMP (DBcAMP), and the activator of adenylate cyclase forskolin (FOR).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In parotid acinar cells, cAMP is thought to be the major intracellular messenger mediating the effects of β-adrenoreceptor stimulation. In our earlier work (6Paulais M. Turner R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1142-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) we also demonstrated that significant up-regulation of cotransport activity was seen following acinar treatment with permeant analogues of cAMP and with forskolin, which increases intracellular cAMP by direct activation of the catalytic subunit of adenylate cyclase. Consistent with the effects of these agents on transport, in Fig. 2B we show that increased phosphorylation of pp175 is likewise seen when acini are treated with the permeant cAMP analogue dibutyryl cAMP and with forskolin.The stron"
https://openalex.org/W2008854562,"Cell cycle-regulated transcription of the R2 gene of mouse ribonucleotide reductase was earlier shown to be controlled at the level of elongation by an S phase-specific release from a transcriptional block. However, the R2 promoter is activated very early when quiescent cells start to proliferate, and this activation is dependent on three upstream sequences located nucleotide −672 to nucleotide −527 from the transcription start. In this study, we use R2-luciferase reporter gene constructs and gel shift assays to demonstrate that, in addition to the upstream sequences, a proximal CCAAT element specifically binding the transcription factor NF-Y is required for continuous activity of the R2 promoter through the S phase. When the CCAAT element is deleted or mutated, promoter activity induced by the upstream elements decays before cells enter S phase, and the transcriptional block is released. This is a clear example of how changing of a proximal sequence element can alter not only the quantitative but also the qualitative response to upstream transcription activation domains.

Moreover, elevated levels of CTP synthetase activity are characteristic of rapidly growing tumors of liver(12Kizaki H. Williams J.C. Morris H.P. Weber G. Cancer Res. 1980; 40: 3921-3927PubMed Google Scholar), colon(13Weber G. Lui M.S. Takeda E. Denton J.E. Life Sci. 1980; 27: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and lung(14Weber G. Olah E. Lui M.S. Tzeng D. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1979; 17: 1-21Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We are using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model eucaryote to study the regulation of CTP synthetase activity. CTP synthetase is encoded by the URA7 and URA8 genes in S. cerevisiae(15Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Fasiolo F. Adeline M. Collin J. Lacroute F. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1991; 231: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 16Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M. Yang W. Carman G.M. Lacroute F. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Comparison of the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the open reading frames of the URA7 and URA8 genes show 70 and 78% identity, respectively(15Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Fasiolo F. Adeline M. Collin J. Lacroute F. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1991; 231: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 16Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M. Yang W. Carman G.M. Lacroute F. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although there is a high degree of identity between the two CTP synthetases, they are not functionally identical. The CTP concentration in cells possessing only a functional URA7 gene is 78% of that found in wild-type cells whereas the CTP concentration in cells with only a functional URA8 gene is 36% of that found in wild-type cells(16Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M. Yang W. Carman G.M. Lacroute F. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Moreover, the reduced CTP concentration found in cells possessing only one of the CTP synthetase genes correlates with a reduced rate of cell growth(16Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M. Yang W. Carman G.M. Lacroute F. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Simultaneous presence of null alleles for both CTP synthetase genes is lethal(16Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M. Yang W. Carman G.M. Lacroute F. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, the CTP synthetases encoded by the URA7 and URA8 genes are functionally overlapping and play an essential role in the growth of yeast cells. The URA7-encoded CTP synthetase has been purified to homogeneity and characterized with respect to its physicochemical and kinetic properties(17Yang W. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10785-10793Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). URA7-encoded CTP synthetase activity exhibits complex cooperative kinetics characteristic of allosteric enzymes and is allosterically regulated by CTP product inhibition(17Yang W. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10785-10793Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this study, we questioned whether the activities of the CTP synthetases encoded by the URA7 and URA8 genes were regulated differentially through their biochemical properties. The URA8-encoded CTP synthetase was purified to homogeneity so its biochemical properties could be studied under well-defined conditions. URA8-encoded CTP synthetase differed from URA7-encoded CTP synthetase with respect to several enzymological properties and sensitivity to inhibition by CTP. Thus, these CTP synthetase isoforms were regulated differentially on a biochemical level. In addition, we showed that the URA7-encoded CTP synthetase mRNA was 2-fold greater than the URA8-encoded CTP synthetase mRNA. The differential regulation of the two CTP synthetases may account for the relative contribution of each enzyme for CTP synthesis. All chemicals were reagent grade.

CTP synthetase was purified from strain OK8 (MATα leu2 trp1 ura3 ura7Δ::TRP1 ura8) bearing the URA8 gene on the multicopy plasmid pOK10.1(16Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M. Yang W. Carman G.M. Lacroute F. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Strain OK8 has mutations in both the URA7 and URA8 genes (15Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Fasiolo F. Adeline M. Collin J. Lacroute F. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1991; 231: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 16Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M. Yang W. Carman G.M. Lacroute F. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in complete synthetic medium (18Culbertson M.R. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1975; 80: 23-40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) without uracil to the exponential phase of growth (1-2 × 107 cells/ml) at 30°C. Cell numbers were determined by microscopic examination with a hemacytometer. Cells were disrupted with glass beads with a Bead-Beater (Biospec Products) in Buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM Na2EDTA, 20 mML-glutamine, 0.3 M sucrose, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM benzamide, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 6 μg/ml pepstatin) as described previously(19Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 304-311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unbroken cells and glass beads were removed by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 5 min. The cytosolic fraction was obtained by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1.5 h. The cytosolic fraction was diluted to a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml with Buffer A. Enzyme grade ammonium sulfate was added to the cytosol to 45% saturation with slow stirring. After stirring for 2 h, precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min and dissolved in a minimum volume of Buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4 mML-glutamine, 1 mM Na2EDTA, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol). The enzyme preparation was then desalted by dialysis against Buffer B. A Q-Sepharose column (1.5 × 12 cm) was equilibrated with Buffer B. The ammonium sulfate fraction was applied to the column at a flow rate of 30 ml/h. The column was washed with Buffer B until all of the unbound protein had been removed from the column. CTP synthetase was then eluted from the column in 3-ml fractions with 10 column volumes of a linear NaCl gradient (0-1.0 M NaCl) in Buffer B. The peak of CTP synthetase activity eluted from the column at a NaCl concentration of 0.16 M. The most active fractions were pooled and diluted with Buffer B to a NaCl concentration of 0.1 M. An Affi-Gel Blue column (1.5 × 12 cm) was equilibrated with Buffer B containing 0.1 M NaCl. Q-Sepharose-purified enzyme was applied to the column at a flow rate of 30 ml/h. The column was washed with Buffer B containing 0.1 M NaCl until all of the unbound protein eluted from the column. CTP synthetase was eluted from the column in 2-ml fractions with 10 column volumes of a linear NaCl gradient (0.1-0.7 M NaCl) in Buffer B. The peak of CTP synthetase eluted from the column at a NaCl concentration of 0.17 M NaCl. The most active fractions were pooled and diluted with Buffer B to a NaCl concentration of 0.1 M NaCl. A Mono Q column (0.5 × 5 cm) was equilibrated with Buffer B containing 0.1 M NaCl. Affi-Gel Blue-purified enzyme was applied to the column at a flow rate of 30 ml/h. The column was washed with 3 column volumes of Buffer B containing 0.2 M NaCl. CTP synthetase was eluted from the Mono Q column in 1-ml fractions with 30 column volumes of a linear NaCl gradient (0.2-0.9 M) in Buffer B. The peak of CTP synthetase activity eluted from the column at a NaCl concentration of 0.32 M. The most active fractions were pooled and concentrated using an Amicon Centricon-10 filter. A Superose 6 column (1 × 24 cm) was equilibrated with Buffer B and calibrated with blue dextran 2000 (for the void volume), thyroglobulin (669 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), and carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa). The Mono Q-purified enzyme was applied to the column at a flow rate of 15 ml/h. CTP synthetase activity was then eluted from the column in 1-ml fractions using buffer B. CTP synthetase activity and protein eluted from the column as a single peak. Fractions containing activity were pooled and the glycerol concentration in the enzyme preparation was increased to 30%. Purified CTP synthetase was stable at −20°C for at least 3 months. An inducible pMAL-c-URA8 plasmid was constructed for the production of a maltose-binding protein-CTP synthetase fusion protein. The fusion protein was used for the generation of anti-URA8-encoded CTP synthetase antibodies. A 0.7 kb 1The abbreviation used is: kbkilobase(s). fragment was isolated from the plasmid pOK10.1 (16Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M. Yang W. Carman G.M. Lacroute F. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) by HpaI and HindIII digestion by standard recombinant DNA techniques(20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). This fragment contained the URA8 open reading frame from codon 245 to 477 (16Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M. Yang W. Carman G.M. Lacroute F. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The pMal-c plasmid was digested with StuI and HindIII. The 0.7-kb URA8 fragment was ligated into the pMal-c plasmid at these sites, placing URA8 in frame with the malE gene, to create the inducible pMal-c-URA8 plasmid. kilobase(s). Maltose-binding protein-URA8-encoded CTP synthetase fusion protein was produced in Escherichia coli strain DH5α by induction of its expression from the pMAL-c-URA8 plasmid and purified as described previously(17Yang W. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10785-10793Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Antibodies to the maltose-binding protein-URA8-encoded CTP synthetase fusion protein were raised in New Zealand White rabbits by standard procedures (21Harlow, E., Lane, D., (1988) in Antibodies: a Laboratory Manual, pp. 1-726, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.Google Scholar) at the Pocono Rabbit Farm (Canadensis, PA). IgG antibodies were isolated as described previously(17Yang W. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10785-10793Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) was performed with 10% slab gels. Proteins on polyacrylamide gels were visualized with Coomassie Blue. Immunoblot analyses of cytosol and pure CTP synthetase were performed as described previously(23Haid A. Suissa M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 192-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 24Fischl A.S. Homann M.J. Poole M.A. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3178-3183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblot signals were optimized by analyzing a number of antigen and antibody concentrations and were in the linear range of detectability. The density of the CTP synthetase bands on immunoblots was quantified by scanning densitometry. CTP synthetase activity was determined by measuring the conversion of UTP to CTP (molar extinction coefficients of 182 and 1520 M-1 cm-1, respectively) by following the increase in absorbance at 291 nm(2Long C.W. Pardee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 4715-4721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture contained 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mML-glutamine, 0.1 mM GTP, 2 mM ATP, 2 mM UTP, and an appropriate dilution of enzyme protein in a total volume of 0.2 ml. Enzyme assays were performed in triplicate with an average standard deviation of ±3%. All assays were linear with time and protein concentration. A unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the formation of 1 μmol of CTP/min under the assay conditions described above. Specific activity was defined as units/milligram of protein. Protein was determined by the method of Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Protein was monitored from column chromatography fractions by measuring absorbance at 280 nm. Kinetic data were analyzed according to the Michaelis-Menten and Hill equations using the EZ-FIT Enzyme Kinetic Model Fitting Program (26Perrella F. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 174: 437-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). EZ-FIT uses the Nelder-Mead Simplex and Marquardt/Nash nonlinear regression algorithms sequentially and test for the best fit of the data among different kinetic models. Total RNA was extracted from cells using hot phenol as described by Schmitt et al.(27Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). The RNA was separated by electrophoresis under denaturing conditions using 1% agarose formaldehyde gels(28Selden R.F. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1987: 4.9.1-4.9.8Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis, RNA was transferred to GeneScreen and probed with a radiolabeled fragment of the URA7 and URA8 genes. URA7 probe was a 1.6-kb fragment isolated from YEp352-URA7(17Yang W. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10785-10793Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) by EcoRI and HindIII digestion. The URA8 probe was a 1-kb fragment generated by the polymerase chain reaction (29Coen D.M. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1987: 15.1.1-15.1.4Google Scholar) using plasmid pOK10.1 (16Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M. Yang W. Carman G.M. Lacroute F. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) as a template and the primers 5′-GGATCCCGATATGATTGCCTG-3′ and 5′-GGATCCAGCACCTTCGATGTA-3′. The probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by the random priming reaction using a NEBlot kit. Prehybridization and hybridization of blots were carried out at 60°C in modified Church buffer (30Church G.M. Gelbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7266) Google Scholar) as recommended by U. S. Biochemical Corp. Ribosomal subunit L32 mRNA (31Eng F.J. Warner J.R. Cell. 1991; 65: 797-804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) was used as a constitutive standard and loading control. The density of the CTP synthetase mRNA bands on Northern blots was quantified by scanning densitometry. The purification of the URA8-encoded CTP synthetase was facilitated by the overexpression of the URA8 gene on a multicopy plasmid in a strain which lacked the URA7-encoded CTP synthetase. A summary of the purification of the URA8-encoded CTP synthetase is presented in Table 1. The purification scheme included ammonium sulfate fractionation of the cytosolic fraction followed by chromatography with Q-Sepharose, Affi-Gel Blue, Mono Q, and Superose 6 (Fig. 1). The ammonium sulfate and Mono Q steps resulted in yields of activity over 100%. The reason for this was unclear. However, the removal of an inhibitor or protease could account for the increased yields of activity in these preparations. Overall, CTP synthetase was purified 1263-fold over the cytosolic fraction with an activity yield of 43.7% to a final specific activity of 4.8 μmol/min/mg. This purification scheme resulted in the isolation of an essentially homogeneous enzyme preparation as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2). The purification scheme for the URA8-encoded CTP synthetase was similar, but not identical to, the scheme used for the purification of the URA7-encoded enzyme(17Yang W. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10785-10793Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Figure 1Elution profiles of URA8-encoded CTP synthetase activity after chromatography with Q-Sepharose, Affi-Gel Blue, Mono Q, and Superose 6.

Purified CTP synthetase was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (lane 1) and immunoblot analysis (lane 3) as described in the text. Molecular mass standards (lane 2) were phosphorylase b (92.5 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66.2 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (31 kDa), and soybean trypsin inhibitor (21.5 kDa).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The minimum subunit molecular mass of URA8-encoded CTP synthetase was 67 kDa (Fig. 2). This value was in close agreement with the size (64.5 kDa) of the deduced protein sequence of the open reading frame of the URA8 gene(16Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M. Yang W. Carman G.M. Lacroute F. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition, antibodies raised against the maltose-binding protein-URA8-encoded CTP synthetase fusion protein constructed from the coding sequences of the URA8 gene and expressed in Escherichia coli reacted with purified CTP synthetase (Fig. 2). These results supported the conclusion that the product of the URA8 gene was indeed a CTP synthetase. CTP synthetase activity was measured with a Tris-maleate-glycine buffer at pH values ranging from 5.5 to 9.5 (Fig. 3A). Optimum CTP synthetase activity was obtained at pH 7.5. The dependence of CTP synthetase activity on the concentration of magnesium ions is shown in Fig. 3B. Maximum CTP synthetase activity was dependent on 6 mM magnesium ions. In these experiments, activity was measured at saturating concentrations of ATP (2 mM), UTP (2 mM), and GTP (0.1 mM) (see below). At 6 mM magnesium ions, all of the nucleotides present in the enzyme assay would be present as magnesium-nucleotide complexes (32Robertson J.G. Villafranca J.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3769-3777Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The dependence of activity on magnesium ions was cooperative. Analysis of the data according to the Hill equation yielded a Km value for magnesium ions of 2.4 mM and a Hill number of 3. The cooperative dependence of activity on magnesium ions was likely due to the formation of magnesium-nucleotide complexes and subsequent cooperative binding to CTP synthetase(17Yang W. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10785-10793Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Manganese ions could not substitute for the magnesium ion requirement. CTP synthetase activity was totally inhibited by 0.8 mMp-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid and 0.8 mMN-ethylmaleimide. The addition of 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol to the assay system prevented the inhibition of activity by these thioreactive compounds. When 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol was added to the assay system by itself, it stimulated CTP synthetase activity by 52%. CTP synthetase activity eluted from the Superose 6 chromatography column at a position consistent with a molecular mass of 150 kDa (Fig. 1D). This indicated that native URA8-encoded CTP synthetase was a dimer. A characteristic of the URA7-encoded CTP synthetase is nucleotide-dependent oligomerization (17Yang W. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10785-10793Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This property was examined for URA8-encoded CTP synthetase by subjecting the enzyme to Superose 6 chromatography in the presence of 2 mM UTP and 2 mM ATP as described previously(17Yang W. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10785-10793Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Indeed, the enzyme eluted from the column at a position consistent with a molecular mass of 300 kDa (data not shown). Thus, under optimum assay conditions URA8-encoded CTP synthetase existed as a tetramer. A summary of these properties and those for the URA7-encoded CTP synthetase is presented in Table 2.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab CTP synthetase catalyzes an ATP-dependent transfer of the amide nitrogen from glutamine to the C-4 position of UTP to form CTP(2Long C.W. Pardee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 4715-4721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Levitzki A. Koshland Jr., D.E. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). GTP activates the reaction by accelerating the formation of a covalent glutaminyl enzyme catalytic intermediate(2Long C.W. Pardee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 4715-4721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Levitzki A. Koshland Jr., D.E. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We first examined the dependence of CTP synthetase activity on UTP and ATP using saturating concentrations of glutamine, GTP, and magnesium ions. Under these conditions all three nucleotides in the reaction mixtures existed as magnesium-nucleotide complexes(32Robertson J.G. Villafranca J.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3769-3777Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The kinetics of the enzyme with respect to the UTP concentration at various set concentrations of ATP was complex (Fig. 4A). CTP synthetase exhibited saturation kinetics when the UTP concentration was varied (Km = 74 μM) and ATP was held constant at a saturating concentration (0.8 mM). On the other hand, when ATP was held constant at subsaturating concentrations, the enzyme showed positive cooperative kinetics with respect to UTP. For example, the Hill number with respect to UTP at 0.1 mM ATP was 2.2. This complex kinetic behavior was also observed when CTP synthetase activity was measured with respect to ATP at various fixed concentrations of UTP (Fig. 4B). At a saturating concentration of UTP (0.6 mM), CTP synthetase showed saturation kinetics toward ATP (Km = 22 μM). However, the dependence of CTP synthetase activity on ATP at subsaturating concentrations of UTP was cooperative. For example, the Hill number with respect to ATP at 75 μM UTP was 1.6. The dependence of CTP synthetase activity on glutamine and GTP was examined using saturating concentrations of UTP, ATP, and magnesium ions. CTP synthetase showed saturation kinetics with respect to glutamine at saturating and subsaturating concentrations of GTP (Fig. 5A). The enzyme also showed saturation kinetics with respect to GTP at saturating and subsaturating concentrations of glutamine (Fig. 5B). GTP did not affect the enzyme's affinity for glutamine (Km = 0.14 mM) but did cause an increase in maximum velocity (Fig. 5A). GTP was not an absolute requirement for CTP synthetase activity (Fig. 5B). However, at a saturating concentration of glutamine, GTP stimulated (Ka = 26 μM) CTP synthetase activity 12-fold. The activation constant for GTP was not affected by glutamine. The URA7- and URA8-encoded CTP synthetases exhibited significant differences in their kinetic properties. In contrast to the URA8-encoded CTP synthetase, the URA7-encoded enzyme shows positive cooperative kinetics toward UTP and ATP and negative cooperative kinetics toward glutamine and GTP even when kinetic experiments are performed with saturating substrate concentrations(17Yang W. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10785-10793Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Differences in the kinetic properties of the URA7- and URA8-encoded enzymes were also reflected in the kinetic constants for ATP, glutamine, and GTP (Table 2). The cellular concentrations of UTP (0.75 mM) and ATP (2.3 mM) are saturating for both the URA7- and URA8-encoded CTP synthetase activities (15Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Fasiolo F. Adeline M. Collin J. Lacroute F. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1991; 231: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 17Yang W. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10785-10793Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, the URA8-encoded CTP synthetase would be expected to exhibit saturation kinetics toward UTP and ATP in vivo. On the other hand, the URA7-encoded enzyme would be expected to exhibit positive cooperative kinetics toward its substrates in vivo. Thus, the URA7- and URA8-encoded CTP synthetase activities may be regulated differentially in vivo through the cellular concentrations of UTP and ATP. CTP inhibited the URA8-encoded CTP synthetase activity in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 85 μM (Fig. 6A). The CTP-mediated inhibition of CTP synthetase activity followed a cooperative (n = 3.2) kinetic pattern (Fig. 6A, inset). The effect of CTP on the kinetics of CTP synthetase activity with respect to UTP was examined using saturating concentrations of ATP, glutamine, GTP, and magnesium ions. As indicated above, CTP synthetase activity exhibited saturation kinetics toward UTP when ATP was set at a saturating concentration. However, in the presence of 0.1 mM CTP, the enzyme exhibited positive cooperative kinetics (n = 2.8) with respect to UTP (Fig. 6B). CTP also caused a decrease in the apparent Vmax and an increase in the apparent Km values with respect to UTP (Fig. 6B). An important characteristic of the URA7-encoded CTP synthetase is product inhibition of its activity by CTP(17Yang W. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10785-10793Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The inhibition of CTP synthetase activity by CTP regulates the cellular concentration of CTP in growing cells(17Yang W. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10785-10793Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Strikingly, the inhibitor constant for CTP (85 μM) for URA8-encoded CTP synthetase was 3.5-fold lower when compared with the inhibitor constant (0.3 mM) for the URA7-encoded enzyme (Table 2). Furthermore, the inhibitor constant for the URA8-encoded enzyme was 8-fold lower than the cellular concentration (0.77 mM) of CTP(34Bullock W.O. Fernandez J.M. Short J.M. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 376-379Google Scholar). These results indicated that in vivo, the URA8-encoded enzyme would be more sensitive to product inhibition by CTP when compared with the URA7-encoded enzyme. The abundance of the URA7- and URA8-encoded CTP synthetase mRNAs in wild-type cells was examined by Northern blot analysis. Under the high stringency hybridization conditions used in these studies, the URA7 probe did not hybridize to URA8-encoded CTP synthetase mRNA, and the URA8 probe did not hybridize to the URA7-encoded CTP synthetase mRNA. The level of the URA7-encoded CTP synthetase mRNA was 2-fold more abundant than the level of the URA8-encoded CTP synthetase mRNA (Fig. 7). Ribosomal subunit L32 mRNA was used as an internal standard in these experiments. Thus, the difference in the abundance of these mRNA levels was attributed to differential expression of these genes as opposed to RNA degradation or to differences in the amount of RNA loaded on the gel. Based on codon bias values, the URA7 gene product would be expected to be expressed more than the URA8 gene product (16Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M. Yang W. Carman G.M. Lacroute F. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This notion was supported by the fact that the URA8-encoded enzyme required a greater fold purification to obtain pure enzyme when compared with the URA7-encoded enzyme (Table 2). We were unable to determine differential expression of the URA7 and URA8 gene products by immunoblot analysis. Anti-URA8-encoded CTP synthetase antibodies reacted with pure URA7-encoded CTP synthetase, and anti-URA7-encoded CTP synthetase antibodies (17Yang W. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10785-10793Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) reacted with pure URA8-encoded enzyme (data not shown). In addition, the subunit molecular masses of the two CTP synthetases were too similar to differentiate on immunoblots. Anti-URA7-encoded CTP synthetase antibodies were used to examine the expression of the CTP synthetases during the exponential and stationary phases of growth in wild-type cells. Maximum expression of the CTP synthetases was found in the early exponential phase of growth (Fig. 8). As cells entered the stationary phase of growth, the expression of the CTP synthetases decreased 5-fold (Fig. 8). We also examined the activity of CTP synthetase during the exponential and stationary phases of growth. The specific activity of the enzyme was 4.3-fold higher in early exponential phase cells when compared with stationary phase cells. The regulation of CTP synthetase expression with growth phase was consistent with the essential role CTP plays in the synthesis of nucleic acids and membrane phospholipids during active cell growth (16Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M. Yang W. Carman G.M. Lacroute F. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The URA7- and URA8-encoded CTP synthetases are functionally overlapping enzymes responsible for the synthesis of CTP in S. cerevisiae(16Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M. Yang W. Carman G.M. Lacroute F. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Studies performed with mutants defective in the URA7 or URA8 genes indicated that the URA7-encoded CTP synthetase is responsible for the majority (78%) of the CTP synthesized in vivo(16Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M. Yang W. Carman G.M. Lacroute F. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We questioned whether the relative contribution of the URA7- and URA8-encoded CTP synthetases for the synthesis of CTP was influenced by differential biochemical regulation of these enzymes. To address this question under well-defined conditions, we previously purified and characterized the URA7-encoded CTP synthetase (17Yang W. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10785-10793Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and in this work, we purified and characterized the URA8-encoded enzyme. The URA7- and URA8-encoded CTP synthetases had striking differences with respect to several enzymological and kinetic properties including turnover number, pH optimum, substrate dependences, and sensitivity to inhibition by CTP. Importantly, the differential kinetic properties of the enzymes with respect to UTP and ATP and inhibition by CTP were seen in vitro at concentrations within the the range of concentrations which occur in vivo. In addition, the products of the URA7 and URA8 genes were differentially expressed. The increased sensitivity of the URA8-encoded enzyme activity to product inhibition by CTP coupled to the lower expression of the URA8-encoded CTP synthetase was consistent with the URA7-encoded CTP synthetase being responsible for the majority of the CTP synthesized in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1966116565,"Previous studies suggest that during sterol synthesis in cells, cholesterol and precusor sterols are transported to the plasma membrane and that this transport is stimulated by the binding of high density lipoprotein (HDL) to its putative cell surface receptor, leading to enhanced sterol efflux. Little is known about the identities of synthesized sterols subject to efflux or whether efflux of cholesterol and precursor sterols are stimulated equally by HDL. To address these issues, cells were incubated with [3H]acetate or [3H]mevalonate and sterol acceptors, and then the labeled sterols in cells and efflux media were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography methods that resolved cholesterol and precursor sterols. In non-hepatic cells (Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), fibroblasts, and smooth muscle), cholesterol and multiple precursor sterols accumulated. In CHO cells, the major products were cholesterol and desmosterol, which together constituted 50% of labeled nonsaponifiable lipids. When media contained human HDL3 (1 mg of protein/ml), the molar efflux of synthesized desmosterol was four times that of cholesterol, and the 8-h efflux of these sterols, each normalized to its own production, averaged 48 and 16%, respectively. When media contained egg phosphatidylcholine vesicles (1 mg/ml), the efflux of these sterols averaged 18 and 2.4%, respectively. Thus, with both acceptors, desmosterol was the major synthesized sterol released from cells, and its efflux was substantially greater than that of synthesized cholesterol. High relative efflux of desmosterol (or a desmosterol-like sterol) occurred in all cell types and in both cholesterol-enriched and unenriched cells. These results demonstrated qualitatively similar efflux of synthesized sterols in the presence of HDL3 and phospholipid vesicles, arguing against an absolute requirement for acceptors that interact with the HDL receptor. To probe for possible quantitative differences in the capabilities of these two acceptors, the ratios of (efflux to HDL3)/(efflux to phosphatidylcholine vesicles) were calculated for synthesized cholesterol and desmosterol, plasma membrane cholesterol, and lysosomal cholesterol. In comparison to plasma membrane cholesterol, there was little or no HDL selectivity for lysosomal cholesterol or synthesized desmosterol, whereas there was a 2-3-fold selectivity for synthesized cholesterol, suggesting that the ability of HDL to enhance the efflux of synthesized sterols is a modest quantitative effect and confined to cholesterol.

In mammalian cells, the efflux of newly synthesized sterols involves translocation from the intracellular site of synthesis (the endoplasmic reticulum) to the plasma membrane, followed by sterol desorption from the plasma membrane to extracellular carriers, such as high density lipoprotein (HDL) 1The abbreviations used are: HDLhigh density lipoproteinapoHDLdelipidated proteins of human HDLLDLlow density lipoproteinHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyTLCthin layer chromatographyGCgas chromatographyMSmass spectrometryPCphosphatidylcholineSUVsmall unilamellar vesicleBSAbovine serum albuminDLPdelipidized calf serum proteinNSLnonsaponifiable lipidsCHOChinese hamster ovary. (reviewed in Johnson et al., 1991). In cells that contain normal basal levels of cholesterol, the translocation step within cells is mediated by vesicular carriers, but bypasses the Golgi apparatus and thus appears to be independent of the protein secretory pathway (Lange and Steck, 1985; Urbani and Simoni, 1990). Extensive work by Lange and colleagues (Lange and Muraski, 1987; Echevarria et al., 1990) has shown that this transport process results in the delivery of both cholesterol and biosynthetic sterol intermediates, such as lanosterol and zymosterol, to the cell surface. In work by Oram and colleagues (Mendez et al., 1991), the efflux of newly synthesized sterol has been used as a marker for the removal of internal pools of cholesterol that may contribute to cholesterol and cholesteryl ester deposition in atherosclerotic foam cells. These experiments suggest that when cellular cholesterol is elevated above normal levels, the delivery of newly synthesized sterol to the plasma membrane (and consequently the efflux of this sterol) becomes a regulated process that is stimulated when media contain acceptors that bind to the putative HDL receptor. The most important ligand for this receptor is apolipoprotein AI (apoAI), the major protein of HDL. The intracellular signaling mechanism is thought to involve diacyglycerol and protein kinase C (Mendez et al., 1991). Cyclic AMP also stimulates sterol translocation in cells, but this appears to be unrelated to HDL binding (Hokland et al., 1993). Recently, it was reported that in cholesterol-enriched cells, the delivery of synthesized sterols to the plasma membrane is sensitive to brefeldin A and proton ionophores, suggesting participation of the Golgi apparatus in HDL-regulated sterol translocation (Mendez, 1995). high density lipoprotein delipidated proteins of human HDL low density lipoprotein high pressure liquid chromatography thin layer chromatography gas chromatography mass spectrometry phosphatidylcholine small unilamellar vesicle bovine serum albumin delipidized calf serum protein nonsaponifiable lipids Chinese hamster ovary. The diversity of biosynthetic sterols that find their way to the plasma membrane has led to concern about the identities of these sterols and whether they are released from cells with equal efficiency. The data addressing these issues are limited and somewhat contradictory. In mouse peritoneal macrophages, analysis by reverse-phase thin layer chromatography indicated that the major sterol produced from [3H]mevalonate was desmosterol and that this sterol and cholesterol were released to HDL with similar efficiency (Aviram et al., 1989). In the recent studies of Hokland et al.(1993), an analysis of biosynthetic products in fibroblasts by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography suggested a different pattern, in that the major product in cells was cholesterol, whereas the major products released to HDL were polar sterols with retention times somewhat different from that of desmosterol. In this case, there were significant differences in the efficiency of release of different sterols. In other work with fibroblasts, Echevarria et al.(1990) reported that zymosterol was a major product of sterol synthesis and that its efflux from glutaraldehye-fixed cells to diluted blood plasma was about two times more efficient than that of newly synthesized cholesterol. The objective of the present studies was to provide a more complete quantitative understanding of the efflux of newly synthesized cholesterol in comparison to the major sterol intermediates that had been reported to accumulate in cells during typical labeling procedures. The critical technical aspect of the experiments was to analyze samples using a chromatographic method capable of separating cholesterol and the major intermediates of sterol synthesis. To satisfy this need, all samples were analyzed by a reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatograph (HPLC), which was connected in series with a flow-through liquid scintillation counter to provide a sensitive, high resolution profile of the distribution of radiolabeled sterols in each experimental sample. The results confirm that in a variety of non-hepatic cells (CHO, fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells) several sterol intermediates more polar than cholesterol accumulate and are available for efflux. A product comigrating with desmosterol (and conclusively identified as this sterol in CHO cells) was the major biosynthetic sterol released from non-hepatic cells. Additional experiments addressed the dependence of cholesterol and desmosterol efflux on the type of acceptor provided in the medium and on whether cells are pre-enriched with exogenous cholesterol. Tissue culture supplies, solvents, and most other reagents were from sources noted previously (Johnson et al., 1990, 1991). Delipidized bovine serum protein (DLP) was prepared from bovine calf serum (Rothblat et al., 1976; Capriotti and Laposata, 1987). DL-[2-3H]Mevalonic acid lactone (1 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Corp. Compound 58035 was a gift from Dr. John Heider (Sandoz). Triparanol was a gift from Dr. Ekkehard Bohme (Marion Merrell Dow Inc.). Mevinolin was a gift from Dr. Peter Gillies (Dupont Merck Pharmaceuticals). [3H]Acetic acid (sodium salt, 3.6 Ci/mmol) was from DuPont NEN. For the addition of radiolabeled precursor to incubation medium, an appropriate aliquot of the precursor stock solution in organic solvent (as supplied by the manufacturer) was taken to dryness under nitrogen and then redissolved in aqueous medium. [3H]Mevalonate and [3H]acetate typically were used at concentrations of approximately 20 and 50 μCi/ml, respectively. Media were not supplemented with unlabeled “carrier” of either precursor. Low density and high density lipoproteins (LDL and HDL) were prepared from fresh human plasma by ultracentrifugation (Hatch and Lees, 1968). Egg PC small unilamellar vesicles (PC-SUV) and reconstituted PC-apoHDL discs (PC/protein ratio = 2.1, w/w) were prepared by sonication (Barenholz et al., 1977; Lund-Katz and Phillips, 1984). Acceptor preparations were dialyzed against the appropriate tissue culture medium and filter sterilized (0.45-μm pore size) before use. CHO-K1 and HepG2 cells were from seed cultures obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). CHO-met18b2 cells were from a seed culture provided by Dr. Jerry Faust (Tufts University, Boston, MA). This CHO variant expresses a plasma membrane transporter for mevalonate and as a result is unusually efficient at incorporating exogenous mevalonate into polyisoprenoid lipids (Faust and Kreiger, 1987). Normal human fibroblasts (GM3468A) were from the NIGMS Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository (Camden, NJ). Rabbit aortic smooth muscle cells were from an explant culture prepared in this department. Cells were propagated in monolayer culture. Media for routine maintenance were 10% fetal bovine serum diluted with Ham's F-12 for CHO cells and 10% fetal bovine serum diluted with minimum essential medium for fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and HepG2 cells. All culture and incubation media were supplemented with 50 μg/ml gentamicin. For experiments, cells were dispersed with trypsin-EDTA solution, resuspended in routine growth medium, and seeded into 12-well plastic culture plates (22-mm diameter wells) approximately 1 week before use. When approaching confluence (approximately 5 days after seeding of plates), cells were rinsed and then incubated for 2 days in medium containing 5 mg/ml of DLP. Incubation in this lipid-free medium was expected to up-regulate sterol synthesis. After 2 days, cells were rinsed extensively and then incubated in 0.5 ml/well of the appropriate defined tissue culture medium supplemented with [3H]acetate or [3H]mevalonate and a sterol acceptor. In some experiments, media also contained Sandoz compound 58035, an inhibitor of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (Ross et al., 1984), to eliminate the possibility of sterol efflux being influenced by intracellular esterification. The addition of this compound is indicated in the figure and table legends. Similar results were obtained with and without this inhibitor, suggesting that under the conditions of these experiments, acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase does not have a major influence on the pattern of sterol release. Incubation times and acceptor concentrations are given in the figure and table legends. At the end of incubations, the medium was removed and lipids were extracted with chloroform and methanol (Bligh and Dyer, 1959). Cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then cell lipids were extracted overnight with 2 ml/well of isopropyl alcohol (Johnson et al., 1986). Lipids from cells and media then were saponified with 10% ethanolic KOH, and the resulting nonsaponifiable lipids (NSL) were stored in chloroform-methanol (1:1, v/v) at −15°C until analysis by HPLC. When NSL were prepared from incubation media that had not been exposed to cells, the recovery of radiolabel was negligible. To enrich cells with free (unesterified) cholesterol, the incubation with DLP was followed by a 1-day incubation in medium containing 50 μg of protein/ml of LDL, 100 μg of cholesterol/ml of cholesterol-rich egg-PC liposomes (Arbogast et al., 1976), 1% fetal bovine serum, 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 1 μg/ml Sandoz compound 58035. All subsequent media contained compound 58035 to prevent sterol esterification. After the 1-day enrichment period, cells were rinsed, incubated 1 h with 0.2% BSA to allow desorption of any loosely adherent lipids, and then incubated with labeled [3H]acetate with or without sterol acceptor. Control (unenriched) cells were treated identically except that during the enrichment period the medium did not contain LDL and the liposomes were cholesterol-free. For HPLC, the column dimensions were 4.6 × 250 mm (diameter × length), the packing was 5-μm C-18 Spherisorb (Isco), the solvent was acetonitrile-isopropyl alcohol (3:1, v/v) flowing at 1 ml/min, and the capacity of the injection loop was 100 μl. The column effluent went directly to a UV absorbance cell where A210 (due to carbon-carbon double bonds) was monitored. From the UV cell, the effluent was directed to a Radiomatic Flo-One β counter, which continuously mixed the effluent with 3 volumes of liquid scintillant and then monitored the elution of radioactivity by means of a flow-through liquid scintillation counter. The cell volume for liquid scintillation counting was 0.5 ml and the data-sampling interval was 6 s. Software provided by Radiomatic was used for peak integration and the preparation of side-by-side plots of UV absorbance and 3H radioactivity. There was a 1-min delay between the UV and 3H signals, which was compensated for by the software. The retention times reflect the times of appearance of peaks at the UV cell. The retention time of cholesterol was 16-19 min, varying somewhat from day to day. The retention times of commercial standards relative to cholesterol were as follows: 25-hydroxycholesterol, 0.35; 4-cholesten-3-one, 0.69; desmosterol, 0.72; 7-dehydrocholesterol, 0.80; squalene, 0.84; lanosterol (two peaks), 0.82 and 1.14. The presence of two components was observed in several commercial lanosterol preparations. This may be due to the presence of both authentic lanosterol (relative retention time 0.82) and dihydrolanosterol (1.14). The reproducibility of relative retention times was ±0.01. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) of NSL was performed with glass-backed Silica Gel G plates using a development solvent of hexane-ethyl acetate (70:30, v/v). Mass amounts of lipid were visualized by staining with iodine vapor. Distributions of radiolabel were imaged using a Radiomatic TLC-600 gas-ionization thin layer plate scanner. Rf values of standards can be calculated from data in Fig. 1. Digitonin precipitation was performed as described by Sperry and Webb (1950) using 1 mg of unlabeled cholesterol as a “carrier” and 2.5 ml of 0.5% (w/v) digitonin to effect precipitation of sterols. After rinsing, the precipitated sterols were dissociated from the digitonide complex by treatment with hot dimethyl sulfoxide and extracted into petroleum ether (Issidorides et al., 1962) for analysis by HPLC. Combined gas chromatography (GC)/electron-impact mass spectrometry (MS) was performed without derivatization of sterols using a Hewlett-Packard model 59970 GC-MS, as described previously (Fischer et al., 1989). The sterols were partitioned using a DB17 capillary column (J & W Scientific, Folsom, CA) with a column oven temperature program (235-265°C, 5°C/min) to improve resolution. For each sterol, the mass spectrum is that of the major peak eluting from the GC column. In-vial liquid scintillation counting and assays for protein, cholesterol, and phospholipid were as described previously (Johnson et al., 1990, 1991). In a given experiment, all incubations were performed in at least triplicate. Values are the means of these replicate determinations. Uncertainties are 1 S.D. Statistical significance was assessed by Student's t test, with p < 0.05 as the criterion of significance. To establish methods for the analysis of newly synthesized sterols, NSL were prepared from CHO cells that had been incubated with [3H]acetate for 24 h, and then TLC and reverse-phase HPLC were compared as methods of detecting and quantifying 3H-labeled cholesterol and other products in the NSL. By TLC, most of the nonsaponifiable 3H co-migrated with cholesterol (Fig. 1A). However, by HPLC the labeled NSL were seen to consist of about 20% cholesterol plus three other major products that were somewhat more polar than cholesterol (Fig. 1B). When the “cholesterol” TLC fraction was isolated and analyzed by HPLC, a profile very similar to that of the total NSL was obtained (Fig. 1C). Thus, the “cholesterol” TLC fraction was a mixture of products, and most of the radioactivity in this TLC fraction was not associated with cholesterol when analyzed by HPLC. These results are consistent with previous work by Echevarria et al.(1990), Burki et al.(1987), and Hokland et al.(1993), who have also reported that the incubation of mammalian cells with nonsterol precursors of cholesterol leads to the accumulation of a diversity of products, some of which are not resolved from cholesterol using typical TLC methods. Thus, in studies of this type it appears to be essential that a method with high resolving ability, such as reverse-phase HPLC, be used to obtain an accurate assessment of the synthesis and efflux of individual sterols. The use of TLC alone could yield misleading results. The data reported in this paper are based entirely on the reverse-phase HPLC analysis of total NSL, as illustrated in Fig. 1B. To determine whether the four major products resolved by HPLC were sterols, labeled NSL were subjected to digitonin precipitation, and then the precipitable sterols were recovered from the digitonide complex and compared to total NSL by HPLC. The results indicated quantitative precipitation of cholesterol and product 2, but only partial precipitation of products 1 and 3. Thus, product 2 was identified conclusively as a 3-β-hydroxysterol (Haslam and Klyne, 1953). Product peaks 1 and 3 may be poorly precipitable sterols or may be mixtures of precipitable and nonprecipitable products. To examine both the synthesis and efflux of newly synthesized sterols, CHO cells were incubated simultaneously with labeled precursor ([3H]acetate or [3H]mevalonate) and an extracellular sterol acceptor, and then NSL from cells and media were analyzed by HPLC. Over several experiments, qualitatively similar data were obtained using either acetate or mevalonate as the precursor. HPLC profiles from an experiment using [3H]mevalonate are shown in Fig. 2. In this experiment, the medium also contained either BSA alone or BSA plus HDL3 (at a concentration of 1 mg of protein/ml). Under both conditions (Fig. 2, A and B, respectively), the cells accumulated radiolabel in cholesterol and in the three polar products noted in Fig. 1(peaks labeled 1-3). When the incubation medium contained HDL3, there was significant efflux of all four products (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, it did not appear that the products were released in proportion to their accumulation in cells. Product 2 in particular was clearly subject to disproportionately high efflux. Because of its interesting efflux behavior and the strong evidence that it was a sterol, additional attention was given to the identification of product 2. Its retention time on HPLC (0.72-0.73 relative to cholesterol) was consistent with it being a diene sterol (e.g. zymosterol or desmosterol). As shown by the A210 profiles in Fig. 2, A and B, small but significant mass amounts of the sterol were present in CHO cells. This allowed the isolation of approximately 3 μg of product 2 by preparative HPLC of unlabeled CHO cell NSL. Electron-impact mass spectral analysis of product 2 in comparison to zymosterol and desmosterol standards (Table 1) suggested little similarity to zymosterol, but greater than 90% correspondence with desmosterol. Thus, with very high probability, product 2 was desmosterol. In the subsequent data presentation, product 2 isolated from CHO cell incubations is referred to as desmosterol.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Fig. 3 illustrates the time courses of synthesis and efflux of total NSL, cholesterol, and desmosterol in CHO cells incubated with HDL3. The results demonstrated steady production and efflux of NSL and both sterols over 24 h. The disproportionately high release of desmosterol in comparison to cholesterol was apparent at all time points. Table 2 and Table 3 provide a compilation of data from several experiments in which the synthesis and efflux of sterols in CHO cells under three acceptor conditions (BSA alone, BSA plus HDL3, and egg phosphatidylcholine vesicles) were examined after an 8-h incubation period. The data in Table 2 demonstrate that under all three conditions, cholesterol and desmosterol together accounted for approximately half of newly synthesized NSL in cells, and that the two sterols were present in roughly equal amounts, although in this regard there was considerable variability from experiment to experiment. The data in Table 2 also show that cholesterol and desmosterol were available for efflux to both HDL3 and PC vesicles and that in both cases the contribution of desmosterol to the newly sythesized sterol efflux was three to four times the contribution of cholesterol (i.e. cholesterol was only about 10% of the biosynthetic NSL in the efflux medium, whereas desmosterol was 30-42% of the biosynthetic NSL in the medium). In Table 3, the efflux data are re-expressed in fractional units (i.e. efflux of a given component normalized to its accumulation in cells + medium during the 8-h incubations). These data show that with HDL3, the efflux of desmosterol was about three times more efficient than the efflux of cholesterol. The difference in efflux efficiencies appeared to be even greater with PC vesicles (6-9-fold).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab To determine whether the results on synthesis and efflux of sterols obtained with CHO cells were representative of other cells, an experiment comparing several different cell types (CHO, human fibroblasts, rabbit smooth muscle cells, human HepG2 hepatoma cells) was performed. When the different cell types were incubated for 8 h with [3H]acetate and no sterol acceptor in the medium (Fig. 4, left panels), similar complex sterol profiles were obtained in the four non-hepatic cell types (CHO-met18b2, CHO-K1, GM3468A fibroblasts, and rabbit smooth muscle cells), consisting mostly of cholesterol and two or three other major products with retention times less than that of cholesterol. In all cases, sterol 2 (co-migrating with desmosterol) was prominent. In contrast, HepG2 cells accumulated cholesterol and little of any other sterol. When media contained HDL3 (Fig. 4, right panels), substantial efflux of newly synthesized sterol was obtained and in all cases the fractional release of sterol 2 was approximately three times that of cholesterol. These results suggest that the accumulation of both cholesterol and more polar sterol intermediates is characteristic of a variety of non-hepatic cells, and that in a wide range of cell types, newly synthesized desmosterol (or a desmosterol-like sterol) is much more readily available for efflux than is newly synthesized cholesterol. To examine the effects of enriching cells with cholesterol mass on the efflux of newly sythesized sterols, control and free cholesterol-enriched CHO-K1 cells and fibroblasts were prepared as described under “Materials and Methods,” and then after rinsing and a brief equilibration period, were incubated for 24 h in medium containing [3H]acetate and either HDL3 or egg PC vesicle acceptor particles. Values for the fractional efflux of total NSL, cholesterol, and sterol 2 (desmosterol in CHO cells) are given in Table 4. In all cases, the enrichment with cholesterol either had no significant effect or suppressed the fractional efflux of sterols. In CHO cells, the enrichment suppressed the efflux of newly synthesized cholesterol by about one-third using either HDL3 or PC vesicles as the extracellular acceptor, whereas the suppression of desmosterol efflux was about twice as great with the vesicle acceptor as with HDL3. In fibroblasts, the enrichment had no significant effect on the fractional efflux of newly synthesized cholesterol and suppressed the efflux of sterol 2 by about one-fourth using either of the acceptors. Under all conditions, the fractional efflux of sterol 2 remained substantially greater than that of cholesterol.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab To determine whether HDL3 was particularly efficient in comparison to PC-SUV at promoting efflux from specific cellular compartments, fibroblast and CHO cell data on sterol efflux from different cellular pools were compiled and compared. Data were available for synthesized sterols from the present work and for the plasma membrane and lysosomal cholesterol pools from previous studies performed under similar conditions (see Table 5 references). For each sterol pool, the data were expressed as the ratio of [efflux to HDL3]/[efflux to PC-SUV], using acceptor concentrations of 1 mg of protein/ml and 1 mg/ml, respectively (mol/mol efflux ratios, Table 5). Then, to probe for HDL-specific influences on the delivery of internal sterol to the plasma membrane, the ratio for plasma membrane cholesterol was set equal to 1, and the other ratios were re-expressed accordingly (normalized efflux ratios, Table 5). These calculations show that in both CHO cells and fibroblasts, the efflux ratio for lysosomal cholesterol was identical to that for plasma membrane cholesterol. In CHO cells, the ratios for synthesized desmosterol and cholesterol were greater than plasma membrane cholesterol by factors of 1.2 and 2.9, respectively. In GM3468A fibroblasts, the corresponding values were 1.3 and 2.2, respectively. These results indicate that synthesized sterol 2 (desmosterol) was released from cells with a low acceptor specificity, similar to that governing the efflux of lysosomal cholesterol (Johnson et al., 1990, 1991). In contrast, the efflux of newly synthesized cholesterol, although much slower than that of sterol 2 under all conditions tested (Table 2 Table 3 Table 4), was enhanced by HDL3, suggesting that the delivery of synthesized cholesterol to the plasma membrane may be more efficient in the presence of HDL3. Using data from Table 4, it can also be calculated that the enrichment of cells with cholesterol had little effect on the efflux ratios for synthesized sterols. Thus, the enhanced efflux of synthesized cholesterol in the presence of HDL3 did not require prior elevation of cellular cholesterol content.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab To provide an additional test of the selective enhancement of cholesterol efflux by HDL, we compared the abilities of PC-SUV and a reconstituted PC-apoHDL discoidal complex to deplete cholesterol and desmosterol mass from CHO-K1 cells. In this case, the cells were grown in lipid-free medium (Fig. 5) so that they contained only synthesized sterols. In addition, to stabilize the levels of cholesterol and desmosterol in the system during efflux, the cells were treated with a combination of compound 58035, mevinolin, and triparanol (inhibitors of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, and sterol 24-reductase, respectively). The mass data indicated that both PC-SUV and PC-apoHDL were able to cause net depletion of cellular desmosterol, with the apoHDL acceptor being two to three times more efficient than SUV (Fig. 5B). For cellular cholesterol (Fig. 5A), the fold difference in acceptor efficiency was much greater, with PC-apoHDL removing 60% of cholesterol after 24 h and SUV removing 10% or less (a change that was not statistically significant but does not contradict the more precise radio-tracer data in Table 3 and Table 4). Thus, the mass data were consistent with the efflux patterns described in Table 5 and provide independent confirmation of the selective enhancement of endogenous cholesterol release by HDL. The results of these studies suggest that sterol synthesis in non-hepatic cells is accompanied by the accumulation of both cholesterol and several polar sterol intermediates. As implied by efflux to extracellular acceptors, the intermediates do not remain confined to the endoplasmic reticulum or other internal organelles, but rather are delivered along with cholesterol to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. During efflux, cholesterol and the intermediates are not released from cells with equal efficiency. In particular, a sterol with the chromatographic properties of desmosterol (and conclusively identified as this sterol in CHO cells) is released from cells several times more efficiently than is newly synthesized cholesterol. As a result of the substantial production of this sterol and its tendency to undergo rapid efflux, the major synthesized sterol released from non-hepatic cells appears to be desmosterol (or a desmosterol-like sterol) rather than cholesterol. This finding holds for both cholesterol-depleted cells (in which cholesterol synthetic activity is high) and for cholesterol-enriched cells (in which synthetic activity is low), and for both lipoprotein (HDL3) and non-lipoprotein (PC-SUV) acceptors. However, the results indicate a significant degree of enhancement of the efflux of newly synthesized cholesterol in response to incubation with HDL. This enhancement is not seen for newly synthesized desmosterol or for the lysosomal pool of cholesterol. The enhancement suggests the possibility of regulation of the efflux of newly synthesized cholesterol by HDL and other biological acceptors that are thought to participate in reverse cholesterol transport. Lange and colleagues (Lange and Muraski, 1987; Echevarria et al., 1990; Lange et al., 1991) have investigated the transport and distribution of newly synthesized sterols in fibroblasts using a variety of methods, including subcellular fractionation and the availability of sterols to exogenous cholesterol oxidase. The results of their work indicate substantial delivery of multiple sterol intermediates to the plasma membrane. This conclusion is supported by the present results demonstrating substantial efflux of sterol intermediates to extracellular acceptors, a process that requires the delivery of sterols from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane. Echevarria et al.(1990) reported that a major sterol intermediate in human fibroblasts was zymosterol and that the efflux of this sterol from glutaraldehyde-fixed cells to diluted blood plasma was twice as efficient as the efflux of newly synthesized cholesterol. On reverse-phase HPLC zymosterol migrates much like desmosterol (Hansbury and Scallen, 1980). Thus, the desmosterol-like sterol detected in fibroblasts in the present studies may have been zymosterol. Previous studies exploring the acceptor-specificity of biosynthetic sterol efflux suggested that in cholesterol-enriched cells the efflux was stimulated by the presence of acceptors that bind to the putative HDL receptor (Oram et al., 1983; Aviram et al., 1989). Thus, HDL3 was reported to promote efflux of newly synthesized sterols, whereas acceptors such as PC vesicles and nitroslyated HDL, which cannot bind to the receptor, were much less effective (Slotte et al., 1987). Limited data have been provided on the composition of sterols released from cells. Tabacik et al.(1991) used thin layer chromatography methods to characterize the synthesis and efflux of biosynthetic sterols in smooth muscle cell cultures and reported the preferential release of sterol precursors in comparison to cholesterol during the incubation of cells in diluted calf serum. The desorbed presursors appeared to consist predominantly of late intermediates (i.e. C-27 dienes), but precise identification of the sterols was not performed. Aviram et al.(1989) reported that in human monocyte-derived macrophages, most biosynthetic sterol that accumulated and was released from cells co-migrated with desmosterol on reverse-phase thin layer chromatography. The efflux of this sterol to HDL3 was reported to be similar to that of biosynthetic cholesterol. Hokland et al.(1993) reported that in human fibroblasts the biosynthetic sterols consisted of cholesterol and multiple unidentified components with HPLC retention times somewhat different from that of desmosterol. The fractional efflux of the intermediates to HDL3 was greater than that of cholesterol, although the efflux of both cholesterol and the other sterols was stimulated by cAMP. These previous results indicate that polar intermediates are the predominant biosynthetic sterols released from cells and suggest that the efflux behavior of these sterols resembles that of biosynthetic cholesterol. Conclusive identification of the intermediates has not been provided. Nor has the efflux of each sterol been quantified separately. The present results add to previous findings by clearly identifying desmosterol as the main biosynthetic sterol released from CHO cells and by indicating that either desmosterol or a structurally similar sterol is the main biosynthetic sterol released from other extrahepatic cells, including fibroblasts. In contrast to the conclusions of previous studies, we found that the sterols synthesized in cholesterol-enriched cells are available for efflux to an acceptor (PC-SUV) that does not bind to the HDL receptor (Table 4). Thus, the efflux of synthesized sterols does not require acceptors that bind to the putative HDL receptor. The methodology of reverse-phase HPLC in combination with continuous liquid-scintillation monitoring of the HPLC effluent provided a detailed quantitative profile of newly synthesized sterols undergoing efflux. The ability to quantify individual sterols using this methodology provided evidence that HDL3 selectively enhances the efflux of synthesized cholesterol (Table 5). In contrast to the results of Aviram et al.(1989), this enhancement appears to be confined to synthesized cholesterol and is not observed for synthesized desmosterol or for LDL-derived lysosomal cholesterol (Table 5). The enhancement may be due to the interaction of HDL with the putative HDL receptor, although its occurrence in both cholesterol-enriched and unenriched cells argues against this explanation. Additional experiments will be needed to determine the basis for this enhancement. These experiments could involve direct tests of the diacylglycerol and cAMP signaling mechanisms, which have been reported to stimulate sterol translocation to the plasma membrane. The greater efflux of desmosterol in comparison to cholesterol may have been due to greater delivery of desmosterol to the plasma membrane, greater desorption of desmosterol from the plasma membrane to extracellular acceptor particles, or a combination of such differences. Analysis of the sterol profile in isolated plasma membranes and studies on sterol efflux from isolated plasma membranes will be used to resolve this question. Relevant to this issue are studies of Clejan and Bittman (1984) reporting that the efflux of desmosterol from the surface membrane of Mycoplasma gallisepticum to egg phosphatidylcholine vesicles is approximately 30% slower than the efflux of cholesterol. If this finding also applies to the plasma membrane of mammalian cells, it would suggest that the greater fractional efflux of desmosterol relative to cholesterol may be due to more rapid delivery of desmosterol to the plasma membrane. Consistent with this possibility, Lange et al.(1991) reported that the transport of newly synthesized zymosterol to the plasma membrane in fibroblasts was two times faster than that of newly synthesized cholesterol. A potential non-biological explanation for the accumulation of both cholesterol and several polar products during sterol synthesis is that cholesterol was the only major product attributable to metabolic activity and that the polar compounds were the result of uncontrolled oxidation of samples during the analytical workup. This explanation is considered very unlikely in view of the results obtained with HepG2 cells (Fig. 4), in which cholesterol was the main biosynthetic sterol product, even though the analytical workup in this case was no different from that used with other cell types in the same experiment. The results of these experiments indicated substantial efflux of several nonsaponifiable lipid products other than cholesterol (e.g.Fig. 2C, peaks 1-3). Major attention was focused on desmosterol (peak 2) in this article because of the major contribution of this sterol to the efflux of the newly synthesized sterols and because we were able to provide a conclusive identification of this sterol in CHO cells. It will be of interest in future studies to establish the identities of the other intermediates that accumulate during sterol synthesis and to further explore their availability for efflux. The presence of low concentrations of sterol intermediates in blood plasma is well documented in the work of Mietennin and colleagues (Bjorkhem et al., 1987; Vanhanen et al., 1993). Previously, the presence of these intermediates in blood has been attributed largely to leakage from the liver (Bjorkhem et al., 1987). However, in the present studies non-hepatic cells appeared to be much better sources of sterol intermediates than either HepG2 human hepatoma cells (Fig. 4) or Fu5AH rat hepatoma cells (data not shown). In these liver-derived cell lines, cholesterol was the major sterol synthesized and released to extracellular acceptors. These findings may indicate that non-hepatic tissues are major sources of the sterol intermediates that are found in blood plasma. This possibility is consistent with the conclusion reached by Dietschy et al. (1993) that non-hepatic tissues contribute substantially to sterol synthesis in mammals, based on the results of in vivo metabolic studies. Another interesting contrast derived from the present results is the large efflux of sterol intermediates from non-hepatic cells in comparison to the very low concentrations of intermediates relative to cholesterol in blood plasma (Bjorkhem et al., 1987). This disparity may imply unusually efficient mechanisms for the clearance of sterol intermediates from plasma. There appears to be very little direct information relating to this question or to the subsequent metabolism of these sterols after uptake into cells. These topics deserve further investigation.

The aim of the present study was to determine if A-II stimulates rRNA gene synthesis and whether the rRNA transcription factor, upstream binding factor (UBF), is involved. Nuclear run-on analysis demonstrated that A-II induced a greater than 5-fold increase in rRNA gene synthesis within 6 h of stimulation. A-II also stimulated a rapid increase in UBF phosphorylation as well as nucleolar localization, but no changes in the content of UBF. Phosphoamino acid analysis showed that phosphorylation occurred only on serine residue(s).

Previous studies in this and other laboratories have demonstrated that medial thickening, at least in large conduit vessels, is due in part to increased vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) (1)The abbreviations used are: VSMCvascular smooth muscle cellsA-IIangiotensin IISMsmooth muscleUBFupstream binding factorCHOChinese hamster ovarySFMserum-free mediumPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisCKIIcasein kinase IIPVDFpoly(vinylidene fluoride). content or mass, which occurs primarily by enlargement or hypertrophy of preexisting VSMC, with little to no change in VSMC number(5Lichtenstein A.H.

As such, there has been considerable interest in identifying cellular mechanisms that mediate hypertrophic growth of vascular smooth muscle. vascular smooth muscle cells angiotensin II smooth muscle upstream binding factor Chinese hamster ovary serum-free medium polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis casein kinase II poly(vinylidene fluoride). There is clear evidence implicating a role for angiotensin II (A-II) in mediation of VSMC hypertrophy during chronic hypertension(8Owens G.K. Cellular Aspects of Hypertension. Springer-Verlag, New York1991Google Scholar). For example, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and A-II receptor antagonists have been shown to be extremely effective in inhibiting development of VSMC medial hypertrophy in a variety of hypertensive animal models(9Griffin S.A. Brown W.C. MacPherson F. McGrath J.C. Wilson V.G. Korsgaard N. Mulvany M.J. Lever A.F. Hypertension. 1991; 17: 626-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 10Owens G.K.

Importantly, effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or A-II antagonists do not appear to be due simply to blood pressure lowering, since other antihypertensive drugs were not as efficacious in blocking hypertrophy despite similar reductions in blood pressure. Consistent with in vivo studies, several laboratories, including our own, have shown that A-II stimulates increased protein synthesis and cellular hypertrophy in cultured VSMC via stimulation of angiotensin AT1 receptors(12Geisterfer A.A. Peach M.J. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1988; 62: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 13Berk B.C. Vekshtein V. Gordon H. Tsuda T. Hypertension. 1989; 13: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The mechanism of this effect is not clear. Moreover, our understanding in this area has been confounded by observations implicating A-II in regulation of VSMC mitogenesis following vessel injury in vivo(14Powell J.S. Clozel J.P. Muller R.K. Kuhn H. Hefti F. Hosang M. Baumgartner H.S. Science. 1989; 245: 186-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). In general, however, A-II has been shown to have a very low efficacy as a mitogen for cultured VSMC, and in cases where A-II is mitogenic, its proliferative effects seem to be mediated by autocrine factors such as platelet-derived growth factor-AA, transforming growth factor-β, and/or b-fibroblast growth factor(15Stouffer G.A.

Res. 1988; 62: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 18Stouffer G.A. Shimizu R.T. Turla M.B. Owens G.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C390-C395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There has been considerable interest in identifying the mechanism and cellular signaling pathways whereby A-II stimulates VSMC hypertrophy. One approach has been to attempt to identify which of the many signal transduction pathways stimulated by A-II (e.g. Ca2+ entry into cells, increased phosphatidylinositol turnover, Na+/K+ exchange, increased activity of protein kinase C, and increased mitogen-activated protein kinase activity) (19Smith J.B.

The problem with this approach is the marginal specificity and unknown actions of many of the available signal transduction pathway inhibitors and the fact that many of these factors (e.g. intracellular calcium chelators) are known to inhibit key cellular processes required for growth, e.g. protein synthesis, even in untreated cells. An alternative approach and one our laboratory has pursued was to first identify the major structural proteins that contribute to A-II-induced hypertrophy and then study mechanisms whereby A-II stimulates their expression. To this end, we have previously demonstrated that A-II-induced hypertrophy of cultured VSMC was characterized by selective increases in the expression of a number of cellular proteins such as smooth muscle (SM) α-actin, SM α-tropomyosin, and SM myosin heavy chain(24Rovner A. Murphy R. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14740-14745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we and others have also shown that A-II-induced hypertrophy was also associated with generalized increases in protein synthesis and content, as well as increased rRNA content(12Geisterfer A.A. Peach M.J. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1988; 62: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 25Naftilian A.J. Pratt R.E. Dzau V.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). These latter results indicate that A-II-induced hypertrophy of VSMC is dependent on increases in the overall translational capacity of the cell. Whereas increased rRNA synthesis is absolutely essential for sustained growth of any cell, relatively little is known regarding signal transduction pathways whereby mitogens or hypertrophic agents stimulate such changes. Studies on the regulation of rRNA synthesis in eukaryotes have led to the model that RNA polymerase I activity is regulated by post-translational modification of RNA polymerase I and/or any of the four factors associated with the polymerase, including TIF-1A, TIF-1B, TIF-1C, and upstream binding factor (UBF). Whereas little information concerning the function of the TIF family is available, considerable progress has been made on the identification and characterization of UBF. UBF has been purified to homogeneity from a number of species, and the mammalian form consists of a protein doublet of 97 and 94 kDa referred to as UBF1 and UBF2. It is a member of the high mobility group family of proteins and appears to function both as an enhancer binding protein and transcription factor(26Jantzen H.M. Admon A. Bell S.P. Tijan R. Nature. 1990; 344: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 27Bell S.P. Learned R.M. Jantzen H.M. Tijan R. Science. 1988; 241: 1192-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). It has also been shown to be involved in recruitment or stabilization of RNA polymerase I, as well as functioning as a transcription antirepressor by overcoming transcription inhibition caused by a repressor protein that competes with TIF-1B for DNA binding(28Kuhn A. Grummt I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7340-7344Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 29Kuhn A. Stefanovsky V. Grummt I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2057-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism by which UBF regulates rRNA synthesis is unclear, it has been shown that removal of the hyperacidic C-terminal tail, or phosphatase treatment, resulted in a decreased ability of UBF to transactivate rDNA transcription in vitro(30Voit R. Schnapp A. Kuhn A. Rosenbauer H. Hirschmann P. Stunnenberg H.G. Grummt I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2211-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). O'Mahony et al.(31O'Mahony D.J. Smith S.D. Xie W.

Chem. 1992; 267: 35-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that serum deprivation of CHO cells resulted in decreased phosphorylation of UBF and translocation out of the nucleolus. Taken together, these studies strongly suggest that phosphorylation of UBF may be important in the regulation of rRNA gene transcription in response to serum-induced cellular proliferation. However, direct proof for this is currently lacking, and the kinase-signaling pathway that mediates serum-induced changes in UBF phosphorylation has yet to be identified. Moreover, no studies have been performed which investigate the effect of a single purified growth factor on UBF phosphorylation and rRNA gene transcription. In this report, we demonstrate that stimulation of cultured VSMC with A-II resulted in increased rRNA synthesis and a notable increase in phosphorylation and nucleolar localization of UBF. Importantly, no alterations in cellular UBF content were found. These data provide evidence that the A-II-induced phosphorylation and/or nucleolar localization of UBF may be an important regulatory event in the induction of vascular smooth muscle hypertrophy. Rat aortic smooth muscle cells were isolated, cultured, and grown to post-confluence as described previously(12Geisterfer A.A. Peach M.J. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1988; 62: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). The growth medium was then replaced with serum-free medium (SFM) for 5 days to induce quiescence as previously shown(12Geisterfer A.A. Peach M.J. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1988; 62: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). Cell cultures were incubated at 37° C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% O2 with medium changes every 2 days. All of the cells used for the experiments described herein were between the 9th and 18th passage. Vascular smooth muscle cells that are growth-arrested in this fashion show [3H]thymidine labeling induces <5% incorporation, and no changes in cell number over extended time periods. Cells remain viable and maintain high levels of expression of multiple VSMC differentiation marker proteins including SM α-actin, SM myosin heavy chain, and SM light chain(33Monical P.L. Owens G.K.

In addition, the growth arrest state is reversible in that VSMC can be readily growth stimulated with various purified mitogens such as platelet-derived growth factor-BB or with serum(34Corjay M.H.

Cell. Physiol. 1990; 145: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, post-confluent growth-arrested VSMC were grown on 100-mm dishes and treated with either A-II or SFM for a specified period of time. The nuclei were harvested, resuspended in storage buffer, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Nuclear run-on reactions utilized equal amounts of cellular DNA. The reaction mixture contained 0.625 mM ATP, 0.312 mM GTP, 320 μCi of [32P]UTP (>3000 Ci/mMol), 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 150 mM NH4Cl, 7.5 mM MgCl2, and 200 units/ml RNasin. The reaction mix was incubated for 35 min at 30 C, then DNase (30 units) and CaCl2 (1.25 mM) were added and incubated for 30 min. Extraction buffer (100 μl) was added and the reaction incubated for 2 h at 42 C. The reaction was phenol/chloroform-extracted and ethanol-precipitated for 30 min. Following centrifugation, the pellet was recovered in Tris-EDTA buffer, and unincorporated counts were removed by Sephadex G-50 column chromatography. Equal volumes of eluate were hybridized to a 5.8-kilobase pair insert of the human 18 S ribosomal gene which was immobilized to a nylon membrane. Hybridization was carried out for 24 h at 65 C in 5 × SSPE, 10 × Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS, 0.5 mg/ml herring sperm DNA, 0.05% NaPPi. Blots were washed at high stringency according to the Church and Gilbert (37Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81 (1991-1995)Google Scholar) method, dried exposed to x-ray film, and densitometric analysis was performed using a Visage 2000 (BioImage). Post-confluent growth arrested VSMC were stimulated with A-II or SFM vehicle and harvested in lysis buffer (60 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mM dithiothritol) at 4, 8, and 24 h post-stimulation. The protein concentration was determined (Bio-Rad DC protein assay), and 10 μg of protein was loaded per well on a 12% SDS-PAGE Mini-Protean gel (Bio-Rad). Upon completion of the run, the proteins were transferred onto a PVDF membrane at 100 V for 1.5 h. The membrane was blocked for 1 h with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and washed three times with Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) buffer, before an overnight incubation with a 1:10000 dilution of anti-UBF antiserum. After extensive washing, the membrane was then incubated for 1 h with a goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Promega). Following three more washes in TBST, the protein-antibody complexes were visualized using an enzymatic detection system (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium) according to the specifications of the manufacturer (Promega). Post-confluent growth arrested VSMC were switched to a low phosphate SFM and labeled in vivo with [32P]orthophosphoric acid (0.5 mCi/ml) for 4 h. In order to determine the kinetics of UBF phosphorylation, the cells were stimulated for 5, 15, and 30 min, and for 1 h with A-II (10-8M). At the end of the stimulation, the medium was quickly removed, and the cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline before quick freezing the cells in a bath of dry ice and ethanol. The cells were harvested in radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.2) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 50 mM sodium flouride) and sonicated for 15 s. After centrifugation, the total protein content of each extract was determined, and equal amounts of protein were precleared with protein A-agarose beads for 45 min. UBF was immunoprecipitated by incubating the lysate with a 1:50 dilution of polyclonal rabbit anti-UBF antiserum for 1 h, followed by the addition of protein A-agarose and another 1-h incubation. The lysates were centrifuged and immunoprecipitates were washed three times in radioimmune precipitation buffer, resuspended in SDS-sample buffer, and analyzed on a 4% SDS-PAGE, which allowed the resolution of both isoforms of UBF. The labeled bands were visualized, quantitated, and photographed on a ImageQuant PhosphorImager. Post-confluent growth-arrested VSMC were prelabeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid for 4 h and treated with either A-II or SFM for 30 min. UBF was immunoprecipitated as described above, analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a PVDF membrane. After visualizing the immunoprecipitated UBF protein by autoradiography, the bands were cut out of the membrane and hydrolyzed in 300 μl of 5.3 M HCl at 100° C for 1 h. The membrane was then removed, and the samples were washed three times in H2O using a speed-vac concentrator and resuspended in 10 μl of pH 3.5 buffer (5% acetic acid and 0.5% pyridine) containing 6 μg each of nonradioactive phosphotyrosine, phosphothreonine, and phosphoserine. The sample was spotted onto a thin layer cellulose plate and electrophoresed with the pH 3.5 buffer for 1 h at 1000 V. The thin layer cellulose plate was then dried and sprayed with ninhydrin to expose the migration positions of the phosphotyrosine, phosphothreonine, and phosphoserine. The presence of 32P-labeled amino acids were visualized by autoradiography and matched to the ninhydrin stained phosphoamino acid standards. Vascular smooth muscle cells were grown to post-confluency in chamber wells and growth-arrested for 5 days in SFM. After the cells were treated with either A-II (10-8M) or SFM vehicle, the medium was removed, and the cells were quickly washed twice with Bacto FA buffer (DIFCO phosphate buffer). Paraformaldehyde (3%) was added to the cells twice for 5 min each, followed by two washes with cold methanol for 30 min each. The cells were washed once again with FA buffer before the addition of blocking serum (1:1000 made up in FA + 3% bovine serum albumin). After blocking for 30 min, the rabbit anti-UBF antibody was added (1:80 made up in FA + 3% bovine serum albumin) and left on the cells for 1 h. After several washes with FA buffer, the cells were incubated for 1 h with the secondary antibody, rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc). After several more washes, the cells were mounted in FA/glycerol (1:1) and viewed with a confocal microscope (Bio-Rad MRC 1000). In vitro kinase reactions contained 300 μM [γ-32P]ATP (250 cpm/pmol), 7.5 μM MgCl2, 200 μg of recombinant UBF protein, 40 ng of casein kinase II (CKII) (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), and β-glycerophosphate buffer in a final volume of 200 μl. A control reaction was also performed in which no CKII was added. At specific times, a 20-μl aliquot was removed from the reaction mix and added to a tube containing 5 μl of SDS-sample buffer to terminate the reaction. The samples were boiled 3 min, resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. Casein kinase II activity was determined by phosphorylation of casein using a Beckman Biomek 1000 robot. Post-confluent growth arrested cells were treated for specific times (1, 5, 10, 15, and 30 min, and 1, 2, and 3 h) with A-II or SFM vehicle. The cells were harvested in β-glycerophosphate buffer, sonicated briefly, and centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 rpm. A 10-μl aliquot from each time point was added into a 96-well microtiter plate. The Biomek added 20 μl of buffer containing 5 μg of casein, 300 μM [γ-32P]ATP (250 cpm/pmol), and 7.5 μM MgCl2. After a 30-min incubation, the Biomek terminated the reaction by the addition of 20 μl of 350 mM H3PO4. The reactions were then spotted onto P81 paper (Whatman) and washed three times with H3PO4, and the amount of radioactivity incorporated into casein was determined by Cerenkov counting. When the reaction mixture was run on SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed, it was found that >95% of the radioactive counts were due to phosphorylation of casein. Nuclear run-on assays were performed to determine the relative rate of 18 S rRNA transcription after treatment with either A-II or the vehicle SFM. Results demonstrated that A-II increased transcription of the 18 S ribosomal gene 5.4 ± 1.3-fold (n = 6) relative to SFM-treated cells, Student's t test; p < 0.05 (Fig. 1). This increase was transient in that no increase was observed 24 h following A-II stimulation (A-II versus SFM vehicle = 1.0 ± 0.3-fold, n = 5). The specificity of the 18 S transcription run-on reaction was shown by: 1) the lack hybridization signal to various control probes including plasmid minus 18 S insert and a β-actin non-muscle sense cRNA; 2) loss of signal when the general (i.e. RNA polymerase I, II, and III) transcription inhibitor actinomycin D was added to the reaction mixture; and 3) persistence of the signal when the run-on assays were done in the presence of α-amanatin (80 μg/ml) which selectively inhibits RNA polymerases II and III. Previous studies have shown that the degree of phosphorylation of UBF is significantly reduced when CHO cells are serum-deprived(32O'Mahony D.J. Xie W. Smith S.D. Singer H.A. Rothblum L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 35-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether A-II treatment resulted in increased phosphorylation of UBF in VSMC, prelabeled cells were stimulated with A-II or SFM for various times and immunoprecipitated with an anti-UBF antibody. Results demonstrated basal phosphorylation of UBF in growth-arrested cells in SFM (Fig. 2). This result was not unexpected since constitutive rRNA synthesis is presumably required for the positive protein balance and cell viability of VSMC under the conditions of our experiments. However, A-II induced a marked increase in phosphorylation of UBF that was detectable within 15 min, peaked at 30 min (223 ± 34% above SFM, Student's t test; p < 0.05, n = 4), and remained elevated for at least 1 h. To determine if the concentration of exogenous A-II had an effect on the magnitude of UBF phosphorylation, VSMC were stimulated with different concentrations of A-II. Since the results from the preceding studies on the kinetics of UBF phosphorylation showed maximal UBF phosphorylation at 30 min, this time point was examined. Results demonstrated that the largest increase in phosphorylation of UBF (241%) was observed at an A-II concentration of 10-8M (Fig. 3). To test whether the A-II induced increase in 18 S rRNA synthesis and/or UBF phosphorylation were associated with increased content of UBF, Western blot analyses were performed using an anti-UBF antibody at 4, 8, and 24 h following A-II or vehicle treatment. Two immunoreactive proteins were detected corresponding to the 94- and 97-kDa UBF isoforms (Fig. 4). Densitometric analysis of the blots showed no significant difference in UBF protein content between A-II and SFM groups at any time point examined (n = 4). The majority of cellular phosphoproteins are phosphorylated on either tyrosine, threonine, or serine residues. To determine the amino acid(s) that were phosphorylated in the basal (SFM) state, and in response to A-II, in vivo labeled UBF bands were cut out of the PVDF membrane and acid-hydrolyzed. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that, in both the SFM- and A-II-stimulated conditions, phosphorylation occurred exclusively on serine residue(s) (Fig. 5). This experiment does not reveal how many serines are phosphorylated nor does it indicate if the phosphorylated residues are the same in the basal (SFM) state and following A-II treatment. To determine if A-II affected the intracellular distribution of UBF, post-confluent growth-arrested VSMC were stimulated with A-II and fixed with 3% formaldehyde for immunostaining. Confocal images of cells stained for UBF following a 15-min treatment with either A-II or SFM are shown in Fig. 6. In the absence of A-II, UBF was found to be evenly dispersed throughout the nucleus (Fig. 6a). In contrast, treatment with A-II led to almost exclusive localization of UBF within the nucleolus (Fig. 6b). This nucleolar concentration of UBF in response to A-II is compatible with previous reports which describe accumulation of UBF within the nucleus during transcriptionally active periods of the cell cycle(38Roussel P. Andre C. Masson C. Geraud G. Hernandez-Verdun D. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 327-337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, A-II appears to be a potent activator for UBF translocation into the nucleolus of VSMC. Previous work by others has implicated casein kinase II (CKII) as the kinase which phosphorylates UBF in vivo(30Voit R. Schnapp A. Kuhn A. Rosenbauer H. Hirschmann P. Stunnenberg H.G. Grummt I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2211-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 31O'Mahony D.J. Smith S.D. Xie W. Rothblum L.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1301-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We first tested whether UBF is a substrate for CKII by performing in vitro kinase reactions using recombinant UBF synthesized in Escherichia coli, partially purified rabbit liver UBF, and UBF synthesized in a baculovirus expression system. Results demonstrated that CKII phosphorylated each of these UBFs (data not shown). CKII phosphorylation of baculovirus-expressed UBF was time-dependent (Fig. 7). To determine if A-II altered CKII activity in vivo, cultured VMSC were treated for various times with A-II and SFM, and assayed for in vitro CKII activity using casein as a substrate. No significant alteration in CKII activity was observed at any time point after A-II stimulation, nor between A-II and SFM (n = 4) (Fig. 8). Although this result does not rule out the possibility that CKII phosphorylates UBF in vivo, it suggests that CKII is not the kinase responsible for the A-II induced increase in UBF phosphorylation. A-II-induced hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells in culture has been shown to be associated with a generalized increase in protein synthesis as well as selective increases in synthesis of cell-specific proteins such as SM α-actin and SM myosin heavy chain (23Turla M.B. Thompson M.M. Corjay M.H. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1991; 68: 288-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 24Rovner A. Murphy R. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14740-14745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The former observation suggests that at least part of the hypertrophic effect of A-II is due to an alteration in the translational capacity and/or activity of the cell. A-II stimulation has been shown to increase RNA content(12Geisterfer A.A. Peach M.J. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1988; 62: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 25Naftilian A.J. Pratt R.E. Dzau V.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), an obvious requisite step for increasing the translational capacity of the cell. Results from nuclear run-on assays in the present study demonstrate that A-II induces a transient yet marked increase in 18 S rRNA synthesis, as well as increased phosphorylation and nucleolar localization of the rRNA transcription factor UBF. The preceding are three cellular processes that might be expected to serve as a regulatory event for the enhanced protein synthesis characteristic of VSMC hypertrophy. Our results are consistent with those of O'Mahony et al.(31O'Mahony D.J. Smith S.D. Xie W. Rothblum L.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1301-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 32O'Mahony D.J. Xie W. Smith S.D. Singer H.A. Rothblum L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 35-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) implicating an important role for UBF phosphorylation in regulation of serum-induced proliferation and increased rDNA transcription in CHO cells. Importantly, however, this study is the first to demonstrate such an effect in response to a known ligand (A-II), rather than serum. Moreover, an important distinction between our study and previous work is that A-II induces hypertrophy not hyperplasia under the conditions of our experiments(12Geisterfer A.A. Peach M.J. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1988; 62: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). As such, this is the first investigation to provide evidence for the involvement of UBF phosphorylation and/or nucleolar localization in the hypertrophic response of vascular smooth muscle to A-II treatment. Although the cells used in these experiments were growth-arrested in serum-free medium, complete cessation of protein synthesis does not occur, thus the transcriptional and translation machinery of the cell must still be active. It is therefore reasonable to assume that there is a basal rate of rRNA transcription as evidenced by the run-on signal under control conditions (i.e. SFM). Also, the immunoprecipitates from prelabeled cells reveal there is some basal phosphorylation of UBF with SFM treatment. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that only serine residues are phosphorylated in both control and A-II stimulated conditions. However, we cannot ascertain from this experiment whether the increase in phosphorylation that occurs after A-II treatment is due to phosphorylation of a new site(s) or increased phosphate incorporation onto the basal site(s). The kinase responsible for phosphorylation of UBF in vivo has not been determined. Casein kinase II is an attractive candidate for the UBF kinase for several reasons. First, CKII phosphorylates UBF obtained from a variety of sources. Second, this kinase has been shown to be associated with RNA polymerase I in the nucleolus and to phosphorylate several nuclear proteins(39Rose K. Stettler D.A. Jacob S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2833-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 40Pfaff M. Anderer F.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 969: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 41Edelman A.M. Blumenthal D.K. Krebs E.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 57: 567-613Crossref Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). Third, the activity of CKII has been reported to fluctuate with the growth rate of cells, and mirror the activity of rDNA transcription(42Belenguer P. Baldin V. Mathieu C. Prats H. Bensaid M. Bouche G. Amalric F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6625-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Results of the present studies show that although CKII is able to phosphorylate recombinant UBF in vitro, the activity of CKII in vivo is unchanged after A-II treatment. This does not necessarily eliminate a possible role for CKII-mediated phosphorylation of UBF in vivo, however, our results suggest that CKII is not the A-II-inducible kinase responsible for increased UBF phosphorylation. CKII may, however, be important as a kinase that is constitutively active, or its regulatory activity may be dependent upon localization of UBF. We are currently investigating whether CKII is actually the kinase that phosphorylates UBF in vivo by comparative two-dimensional phosphotryptic mapping of UBF phosphorylated in vivo (SFM and A-II) versus purified recombinant UBF phosphorylated in vitro with CKII. The distribution of UBF at various stages of the cell cycle and in response to serum stimulation has been studied to investigate the relationship between UBF localization and rDNA transcription(32O'Mahony D.J. Xie W. Smith S.D. Singer H.A. Rothblum L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 35-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Roussel P. Andre C. Masson C. Geraud G. Hernandez-Verdun D. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 327-337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In all cases, little or no UBF labeling was observed outside the nucleus. During stages of the cell cycle when transcription was elevated, UBF was found to accumulate within the nuclear organization regions, which are known to contain the rDNA and therefore are the sites of ribosomal synthesis. This group described the UBF staining as “beads or granules” within the nucleus, with each bead thought to represent a transcriptional unit. The immunolocalization studies presented in this report fit with these results in that, after A-II treatment, small clusters of UBF accumulated within the nucleus. Since we have also shown that A-II increases 18 S ribosomal gene transcription, these two pieces of evidence complement each other and add credence to the concept that the increased protein synthesis associated with A-II is due in part to increased ribosomal gene transcription mediated via the activation and/or localization of UBF. The results from our experiments which determined the kinetics of UBF phosphorylation along with the immunolocalization data may provide some insight into the mechanism of UBF activation. Since UBF forms part of the transcription initiation complex at the nuclear organization region, it seems likely that translocation of UBF inside the nucleolus should precede its transcription regulatory activity. We have shown that nucleolar accumulation of UBF is observed as early as 15 min after A-II treatment. However, the phosphorylation data revealed that maximal phosphorylation of UBF did not occur until 30 min after A-II treatment. Taken together, these results suggest that phosphorylation of UBF is not necessary for nucleolar translocation into the nucleolus. The mechanisms whereby A-II stimulates nucleolar accumulation of UBF are not known. In addition, there is a lack of direct evidence that UBF phosphorylation regulates rDNA transcription in vivo, although there is strong evidence that phosphorylation of UBF regulates its transcriptional activity in vitro(31O'Mahony D.J. Smith S.D. Xie W. Rothblum L.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1301-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 32O'Mahony D.J. Xie W. Smith S.D. Singer H.A. Rothblum L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 35-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms whereby phosphorylation of UBF could regulate rDNA transcription are not clear, but may involve: (a) increasing the affinity of UBF for the upstream core element; (b) increasing its affinity for other transcription factors (e.g. TIF-1B); or (c) increasing its affinity for RNA polymerase I. In summary, results from the present study demonstrate that A-II stimulates increased rRNA synthesis as well as increased phosphorylation and nucleolar localization of the rRNA transcriptional factor UBF. These findings are consistent with previous studies which have shown increased rDNA transcription and phosphorylation of UBF in response to serum-induced mitogenesis. However, the present studies are the first to demonstrate such effects utilizing a single well defined agonist which induces hypertrophic, rather than mitogenic, growth. Further studies are required to determine the signaling pathway that mediates phosphorylation of UBF and to determine the mechanisms whereby phosphorylation of UBF might regulate rRNA synthesis in vivo. The authors express their gratitude to Diane Raines and Andrea Tanner for their expert technical assistance, and to Clare Haystead for her help with the phosphoamino acid analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2085310269,"The effects of long term treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) on estrogen receptor (ER) expression in the human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7, were studied. This study demonstrates that treatment of cells with the phorbol ester blocked estrogen receptor activity. Treatment of cells with 100 nM TPA resulted in an 80% decrease in the level of ER protein and a parallel decrease in ER mRNA and binding capacity. Following removal of TPA from the medium, the level of ER protein and mRNA returned to control values; however, the receptor failed to bind estradiol. These cells also failed to induce progesterone receptor in response to estradiol. In addition, TPA treatment blocked transcription from an estrogen response element in transient transfection assays and inhibited ER binding to its response element in a DNA mobility shift assay. The estrogen receptor in treated cells was recognized by two monoclonal anti-ER antibodies and was not quantitatively different from ER in control cells. RNase protection analysis failed to detect any qualitative changes in the ER mRNA transcript. Mixing experiments suggest that TPA induces/activates a factor which interacts with the ER to block binding of estradiol. The effects of TPA on ER levels and binding capacity were concentration-dependent. Low concentrations of TPA inhibited estradiol binding without a decrease in the level of protein, whereas higher concentrations were required to decrease the level of ER protein. The effects of TPA appear to be mediated by activation of protein kinase C since the protein kinase C inhibitors, H-7 and bryostatin, block the effects of TPA on estradiol induction of progesterone receptor. TPA treatment had no effect on the level or binding capacity of the glucocorticoid receptor, indicating that the effects are not universal for steroid receptors. These data demonstrate that activation of the protein kinase C signal transduction pathway modulates the estrogen receptor pathway. The long term effect of protein kinase C activation is to inhibit estrogen receptor function through induction/activation of a factor which interacts with the receptor.

Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent of all cancers and is characterized by hormonal growth control. The proliferation and phenotype of breast cancer cells is determined to a great extent by estrogen, and elevated concentrations of estrogen may contribute to an increase in the risk of breast cancer(1Lippman M.E. Williams R.H. Textbook of Endocrinology. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1985: 1309-1326Google Scholar). Because of the hormonal dependence of breast cancer, the presence of estrogen receptor (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ERestrogen receptorPgRprogesterone receptorIMEMimproved minimal essential mediumTPA12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetateCCScharcoal-treated calf serumFCSfetal calf serumPBSphosphate-buffered salineEREestrogen-responsive elementCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferasebpbase pairBESN,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid. and progesterone receptor (PgR) in breast tumors is used to predict those patients who will benefit from hormonal therapy(2Osborne C.K.

Although significant concentrations of estrogen receptor have been detected in approximately 60% of human breast cancers, only 60% of these ER-positive tumors respond to endocrine therapy(2Osborne C.K. Yochmowitz M.G. Knight III, W.A. McGuire W.L. Cancer. 1980; 46: 2884-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 3Allegra J.C. Lippman M.E Rec.

Legros N. LeClercq G. Hensen J.C. Cancer. 1980; 46: 2889-2895Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Absence or loss of estrogen responsiveness in breast tumors correlates with a more malignant form of the disease. Several mechanisms may be responsible for the loss of estrogen responsiveness in human breast cancer; including the loss of ER expression, the presence of subpopulations of cells which are ER negative, and the presence of ER variants with altered activity. Several ER variants, including point mutations and alternately spliced forms, have been described in tumors and in breast cancer cell lines (6Wang Y. Miksicek R.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1707-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 7McGuire W.L. Chamness G.C. Fuqua S.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1571-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Some of these variants lack the ability to bind estradiol, whereas other variants are active in the absence of ligand. In addition to the above mechanisms, treatment of breast carcinoma cell lines with the anti-estrogen tamoxifen has been shown to result in the accumulation of ER that has lost its ability to bind estradiol(8LeClercq G. Negros N. Piccart M.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 41: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the estrogen receptor has also been shown to regulate its function. In the case of hormone binding, it has been suggested that dephosphorylation of a tyrosine residue in the hormone binding domain of the receptor blocks estradiol binding(9Denton R.R. Koszewski N.J. Notides A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7263-7268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interactions with other factors have also been shown to modulate steroid receptor function. The unregulated expression of c-Jun or c-Fos proteins inhibits ER activity in human breast cancer-derived cells(10Doucas V. Spyrou G. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2237-2245Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 11Tzukerman M. Zhang X.-K. Pfahl M. Mol.

Several lines of evidence suggest that protein kinase C may play a role in the loss of estrogen responsiveness in breast cancer. In human mammary carcinoma cells, an inverse relationship exists between the levels and activity of protein kinase C and the level of estrogen receptor(12Borner C. Wyss R. Regassi R. Eppenberger U. Fabbro D. Int. J. Cancer. 1987; 40: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), that is, the activity of protein kinase C is several times higher in ER-negative breast cancer cell lines than in ER-positive cell lines(13Fabbro D. Kung W. Roos W. Regassi R. Eppenberger U. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 2720-2725PubMed Google Scholar). We and others have also shown that treatment of the breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7 with TPA, an activator of protein kinase C, results in a decrease in the level of ER (14Saceda M. Knabbe C. Dickson R.B. Lippman M.E. Bronzert D. Lindsey R.K. Gottardis M.M. Martin M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17809-17814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Lee C.S. Koga M. Sutherland R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This effect is mediated by a post-transcriptional destabilization of the ER mRNA(14Saceda M. Knabbe C. Dickson R.B. Lippman M.E. Bronzert D. Lindsey R.K. Gottardis M.M. Martin M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17809-17814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data presented in this report demonstrate dramatic effects of TPA treatment on ER activity which are independent of its effect on the level of ER. Following long term treatment, TPA inhibits the activity of the ER as shown by the lack of estradiol induction of PgR and the inability of estradiol to activate an estradiol-inducible reporter gene. The inhibitory effect of TPA on ER activity is due to the induction/activation of a factor that blocks the binding of estradiol to the ER. Monolayer cultures of MCF-7 breast cancer cells were grown in improved minimal essential medium (IMEM) supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS). When the cells were 70-80% confluent, the medium was replaced with phenol red-free IMEM containing 5% charcoal-treated calf serum (CCS)(16Berthois Y. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2496-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). To remove endogenous steroids, serum was treated first with sulfatase followed by the addition of dextran-coated charcoal. After 2 days in estrogen-depleted medium, TPA, estradiol, or vehicle was added, and the cells were harvested at the times indicated. In long term experiments, cells were treated with TPA for 24 h. The medium containing TPA was removed. The cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and fresh phenol red-free IMEM supplemented with 5% CCS was added. Cells were harvested 2-3 days after the change of medium. To measure total ER and PgR content, the cells were homogenized by sonication in a high salt buffer (10 mM Tris, 1.5 mM EDTA, 5 mM Na2MoO4, 0.4 M KCl, 1 mM monothioglycerol, and 2 mM leupeptin). The homogenate was incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 h. Aliquots of total extracts were then analyzed using enzyme immunoassay kits containing monoclonal antibodies to ER and PgR from Abbott according to the manufacturer's instructions. To determine the binding of [3H]estradiol to the ER, several protocols were employed. In the cytosol-binding assay, a cell extract was prepared as described for the enzyme immunoassay. Aliquots of extract were incubated with increasing amounts of [3H]estradiol (0.1-6.0 nM) in the presence or absence of 100 × excess diethylstilbestrol to determine nonspecific binding. The incubation was conducted in TED buffer (0.01 M Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol). In some experiments, the time and temperature of the incubation were varied. Binding assays were performed in triplicate at 37°C for 1 h or at 4°C for 4-16 h. In some assays, samples were divided in two. One aliquot was assayed for [3H]estradiol-bound receptor in the presence of 100 nM TPA; the other aliquot was assayed in the absence of TPA. Activated dextran-coated charcoal (800 μl) was added, and the samples were incubated on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation, 400 μl of the supernatant was counted. The data were analyzed by the Scatchard method(17Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17805) Google Scholar). A whole cell-binding assay was also used to measure the binding capacity of the estrogen receptor. 80,000 cells per well were plated in 6-well plates. Following treatment with TPA, cells were washed with PBS and [3H]estradiol (0.1-6.0 nM) was added in the presence or absence of a 100 × excess diethylstilbestrol to determine nonspecific binding. Binding assays were done in triplicate at 37°C for 1 h. Cells were washed three times with PBS and disrupted by sonication in Hanks' solution. Samples were counted, and the data were analyzed by the method of Scatchard. After treatment with TPA (2.5-100 nM), a whole cell extract was prepared as described for the enzyme immunoassay. Aliquots of the cell extract were analyzed either for ER protein by the enzyme immunoassay or for [3H]estradiol binding by a single point analysis. For the single point analysis, aliquots were incubated with 2 nM [3H]estradiol in the presence and absence of 100 × diethylstilbestrol. After a 4-h incubation in TED buffer at 4°C, dextran-coated charcoal was added, and [3H]estradiol binding was determined as described above. The data are presented as either percent of control values of ER protein or binding. Cells were harvested by scraping from flasks using a rubber policeman and then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. The following manipulations were carried out at 0-4°C unless indicated otherwise. The cell pellets were suspended in 3 volumes of binding buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, 20 mM molybdate, 5 mM EDTA), placed on ice for 5 min, and then ruptured by 13 strokes with the A pestle of a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 110,000 × g for 1 h. The clear supernatant was defined as cytosol which was used for hormone-binding assays and Western blots. Hormone-binding assays were performed by the charcoal adsorption method (18Bell P.A. Munck A. Biochem. J. 1973; 136: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Cytosol was incubated with [3H]triamcinolone acetonide in an ice water bath overnight in a total volume of 100 μl containing 0.6 mg of protein. Nonspecific binding was determined by incubating the mixture with 1000-2000-fold molar excess of nonradioactive triamcinolone acetonide. After 18 h, 300 μl of 2.5% dextran-coated charcoal were added followed by mixing for 10 s. The tubes were placed at room temperature for 10 min and then centrifuged for 8 min. [3H]Triamcinolone acetonide present in the supernatant was determined using a scintillation counter. Specific hormone binding was obtained by subtracting nonspecific binding from total binding. The binding assays were performed in triplicate. Dissociation constants were determined by computer analysis of the data based on the Michaelis-Menton equation [HR] = [H][R]/[H] + Kd where HR = hormone-receptor complex, H = free hormone concentration, R = free and complexed receptor. For Western blot analysis, electrophoresis was performed in 12% slab gels according to Laemmli (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar) as described previously by Blackshear (20Blackshear P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 104: 237-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Lysozyme (15.3 kDa), β-lactoglobulin (18.3 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (27.8 kDa), ovalbumin (44.2 kDa), bovine serum albumin (71 kDa), phosphorylase B (105.7 kDa), and H-chain of myosin (196 kDa) from Life Technologies, Inc., were used as molecular mass standard markers. Cytosol was mixed with an equal volume of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, boiled for 4 min, and loaded onto the gel. After electrophoresis, the gels as well as nitrocellulose membranes were immersed in transfer buffer (48 mM Tris, 39 mM glycine, pH 9.2, 20% methanol, 0.00375% SDS) for 20 min. Proteins were transferred from gels to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk in TBST (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) overnight at room temperature on an orbital shaker. The membranes were washed three times with TBST and incubated with primary antibody against the glucocorticoid receptor (GR49) at room temperature for 1 h with shaking. Unbound antibody was removed by washing as described above. The membrane was then incubated for 1 h with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody. The unbound antibody was removed as described above. The membranes were then incubated with detection solution (Amersham Corp.) for 1 min and exposed to Hyperfilm™ for 2-5 s. Total cellular RNA was extracted from MCF-7 cells by the method of Chomizynsk and Sacchi(21Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63184) Google Scholar). The levels of ER, PgR, and pS2 mRNA were determined by RNase protection analysis as described previously(22Saceda M. Lippman M.E. Chambon P. Lindsey R.L. Ponglikitmongkol M. Puente M. Martin M.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 1157-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Homogeneously 32P-labeled antisense RNAs (cRNA) were synthesized in vitro from pOR300 (22Saceda M. Lippman M.E.

MCF-7 cells were plated in 100-mm culture dishes at a density of 500,000 cells/plate in IMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. After 24 h, the cells were transiently transfected with 30 μg/plate of the reporter plasmid Vit-TK-CAT (27Slater E.P. Redeuilh G. Beato M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 386-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) in 1 ml of BES-buffered saline (50 mM Bes, pH 6.96, 280 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM Na2HPO4) containing 125 mM CaCl2(28Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated at 35°C in 2% CO2 for 16 h. Media were removed and the cells were washed twice with PBS. Fresh phenol red-free IMEM supplemented with 5% CCS was added. After 48 h, cells were treated as described in the text. Following treatment, cells were harvested and the cellular pellet was resuspended in 0.25 M Tris, pH 7.5. Cells were disrupted by several cycles of freeze-thawing. After centrifugation, supernatants were analyzed for CAT activity by thin layer chromatography(29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.60-16.63Google Scholar). In a number of experiments, the level of CAT protein was analyzed by a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Promega). The efficiency of transfection was determined by a Hirt (30Hirt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (3351) Google Scholar) analysis. A second transfection assay system was also employed. In these experiments, the reporter plasmid ERE-TK-Luc (31Tzukerman M.T. Esty A. Santiso-Mere D. Danielian P. Parker M.G. Stein R.B. Pike J.W. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar) was used. Cells were plated in 6-well plates in IMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. The next day, cells were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine (Promega) in serum-free IMEM. After 5 h at 37°C in serum-free IMEM, medium supplemented with 10% FCS was added to achieve a final concentration of 5% FCS. The cells were incubated overnight at 37°C. The next day, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed with PBS. Cells were maintained in phenol red-free IMEM supplemented with 5% CCS for 48 h. Treatment with TPA and subsequent induction with estradiol were performed as described above. After treatment, cells were harvested, and a cellular extract was obtained as described above. The cellular extract was analyzed for luciferase activity using a luminometer. Nuclear extracts from control and treated cells were isolated following a protocol previously described (32Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Feidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, New York1989: 12.1.4-12.2.10Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested, and the cell pellet was washed twice with 0.1 volume of buffer A (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol). Pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of buffer A containing 0.01% Nonidet P-40, incubated on ice for 10 min, mixed by vortexing, and pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm at 4°C for 10 min in a microcentrifuge. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 75 μl of buffer C (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.42 M NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol), incubated on ice for 15 min, and pelleted by centrifugation as above. The nuclear supernatant was diluted with 375 μl of buffer D (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.05 M KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol) and stored at −70°C in 100-μl aliquots. Protein concentration was determined prior to storage. For the DNA mobility shift assay, a 32P-labeled estrogen-responsive element (ERE; 5′-GATCCTCACGGTCACAGTGACCTGCCCGGGATT) was incubated with nuclear extracts from MCF-7 cells for 20 min at room temperature in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, and 6% glycerol. After incubation, 1 μg of antibody to the ER was added to the appropriate samples. After a 20-min incubation at room temperature, samples were loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 1 × TBE (50 mM Tris borate, pH 8.3, and 0.5 mM EDTA) and run at 20 mA/gel at 4°C. The gel was dried, and the bands were visualized by autoradiography. For these experiments, whole cell extracts were made from cells treated with TPA for various times or from cells treated with TPA for 24 h and then maintained in fresh medium for 2-3 days. Extracts were isolated by the protocol described for the ER and PgR assays. Extracts were made in the presence and absence of 5 mM Na2MoO4. Aliquots of the extracts were mixed together at 4°C, and the ability of the ER to bind [3H]estradiol was determined using the single point binding analysis described above. The results of the mixing experiments are presented as percent of the expected binding. We and others have demonstrated that treatment of MCF-7 cells with TPA results in a decrease in the concentration of ER protein and ER mRNA(14Saceda M. Knabbe C. Dickson R.B. Lippman M.E. Bronzert D. Lindsey R.K. Gottardis M.M. Martin M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17809-17814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Lee C.S. Koga M. Sutherland R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Following treatment with 100 mM TPA, the level of ER protein decreases to 20% of control values by 24 h as determined by an enzyme immunoassay. The decrease in protein is preceded by a decrease in ER mRNA. After removal of TPA from the medium, the levels of ER protein and mRNA return to control values by 72 h (data summarized in Fig. 1A). To determine whether the decrease and subsequent recovery of ER protein corresponds to a similar change in estradiol-binding sites, the concentration of ER protein and binding capacity were measured simultaneously (Fig. 1B). The binding of estradiol to the ER was determined by a whole cell-binding assay using increasing amounts of [3H]estradiol. Following treatment with TPA, a significant decrease in the estradiol binding capacity was observed. The number of estrogen-binding sites decreased from 592 fmol/mg of protein in control cells to 119 fmol/mg of protein in cells treated with TPA for 24 h. These results are consistent with the results obtained with the enzyme immunoassay. However, following removal of TPA from the medium, the number of binding sites did not increase. Although the concentration of ER protein returned to control values, the number of estrogen-binding sites remained at approximately 20% of control values. The discrepancy between the concentration of receptor protein and hormone binding capacity was unexpected. To confirm that TPA did indeed induce a decrease in the number of estradiol-binding sites which did not return to control values upon TPA removal, a number of conditions were employed in the cytosol-binding assay. To rule out the possibility that TPA directly interfered with estradiol binding to its receptor, the ability of the ER to bind [3H]estradiol in the presence of added TPA was determined. Binding experiments were also performed at 4 and 37°C. The data from the different binding assays are summarized in Table 1. Independent of the assay conditions, the level of [3H]estradiol binding was approximately 20% of the expected values when the cells were treated with TPA. TPA added to the binding reaction of untreated cells did not affect hormone binding. Scatchard analysis of the data indicated that treatment of cells with TPA did not affect the dissociation constant of the estrogen receptor. These data indicate that, although the levels of ER protein and ER mRNA returned to control levels 72 h after the change of medium, the ER was not capable of binding estradiol.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The discrepancy between the levels of ER protein and ER binding capacity following removal of TPA from the media suggested that the estrogen receptor was not functional. To test the transcriptional activity of the ER, the ability of estradiol to induce the progesterone receptor was determined following treatment with TPA. In this study, the level of PgR was determined by an enzyme immunoassay. The data in Fig. 2 demonstrate a dramatic increase in the level of PgR in response to estradiol treatment. By 24 h there was a 4-fold increase in PgR expression; by 48 h there was a 7-fold increase in progesterone receptor. In cells treated with TPA for 24 h prior to the addition of estradiol, the induction of PgR was completely blocked. In cells treated with TPA for 24 h and placed in fresh medium for 2-3 days prior to the addition of estradiol, only a modest induction of PgR (1.5-fold by 24 h) was achieved, even though the level of ER protein had returned to control values in these cells. Treatment of cells with TPA alone had no effect on PgR expression (data not shown). 4-α-Phorbol (100 nM), a compound related to TPA but lacking the biological effects of TPA, had no effect on PgR expression (data not shown). The effect of TPA on estrogen receptor activity was also studied in a transient transfection assay with the reporter gene Vit-TK-CAT(27Slater E.P. Redeuilh G. Beato M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 386-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this construct, the thymidine kinase promoter is under the control of an ERE. The level of CAT activity was determined by thin layer chromatography. The data from several independent experiments are summarized in Fig. 3. In control cells, the addition of estradiol produced a 2-fold increase in CAT activity. In cells treated with TPA for 24 h, estradiol failed to induce CAT activity. In cells treated with TPA for 24 h and subsequently maintained in fresh medium for 72 h, no increase in CAT activity was seen following estradiol treatment. These data suggest that the ER, although present in these cells, is not functio"
https://openalex.org/W2155321065,"The role of the proximal promoter and the far-upstream enhancer in the hepatocyte-specific and hormonal regulation of the carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase I (CPS) gene was investigated in transient transfection assays using primary rat hepatocytes, hepatoma cells, and fibroblasts. These experiments revealed that the activity of the promoter is comparable in all cells tested and is, therefore, not responsible for tissue-specific expression. The 5′-untranslated region of the mRNA is a major, non-tissue specific stimulator of expression in FTO-2B hepatoma cells, acting at the post-transcriptional level. A 469-base pair DNA fragment, 6 kilobase pairs upstream of the transcription start-site in the CPS gene, confers strong hormone-dependent tissue specific expression, both in combination with the CPS promoter and a minimized viral thymidine kinase promoter. Sequences similar to a cyclic AMP-responsive element and a glucocorticosteroid-responsive element were found in the isolated enhancer. Substitutional mutations in these sites strongly affected hormone-induced expression. Analysis of the interaction between the enhancer and parts of the CPS promoter revealed that, in addition to the TATA box, the GAG box, a motif similar to the GC box near the TATA motif, is instrumental in conferring the enhancer activity.

The mRNA is 5546 nucleotides in length (excluding the poly(A) tract) and consists of a 140-nt 5′-untranslated region, an open reading frame of 4500 nt, and a 3′-UTR of 906 nt. Functional analysis of the 5′-part of the gene showed that the minimal, fully active promoter is located within the 161 nt upstream of the transcription initiation site(15van den Hoff M.J.B. van de Zande L.P.W.G.

Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that resembles the element recognized by the TFIIIA-like Cys2/His2 zinc finger class of transcription factors, including Sp1, but is not a target of the Sp1 protein itself. Two MspI restriction sites upstream of the transcription start site were found to be differentially methylated(15van den Hoff M.J.B. van de Zande L.P.W.G. Dingemanse M.A. Das A.T. Labruyere W.

The site at −6.3 kbp becomes demethylated shortly after birth in liver and intestine. The other site, at −4.0 kbp relative to the transcription start site is fully methylated in liver and partly demethylated in postnatal small intestine. A 4-kbp fragment containing the −6.3-kbp MspI site responds to cyclic AMP and dexamethasone in transient expression assays, giving a 10-fold rise in reporter gene expression in FTO-2B hepatoma cells(15van den Hoff M.J.B. van de Zande L.P.W.G.

The regulatory regions of the CPS gene were analyzed with respect to their role in tissue-specific expression and hormone sensitivity. A 469-bp far-upstream enhancer fragment was found to be responsible for hormone-dependent tissue-specific expression of the CPS gene. It was also investigated whether the proximal promoter and the 5′-UTR of the mRNA contributed to tissue-specific expression. Exploration of the interaction of the enhancer fragment with parts of the CPS promoter revealed an important role for the GAG element in the transduction of the hormonally induced activation signal from the enhancer.

The FCS was selected for its inability to induce CPS expression in cultured hepatocytes. All cells were cultured in a 5% CO2/air atmosphere at 37°C. FTO-2B and MH1C1 cells express CPS, but Rat-1, CHO-K1, and Caco-2 cells do not (see “Results”). Cell lines were tested monthly for the presence of mycoplasms. Exponentially growing cells were transfected by electroporation(24van den Hoff M.J.B. Christoffels V.M. Labruyère W.T. Moorman A.F.M. Lamers W.H. Nickoloff J.A. Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1995Google Scholar). The capacity of CPS gene sequences to direct expression of a reporter gene was analyzed by cloning into the vector pLT1 or pT81luc. The pLT1 vector, based on pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene), contains the firefly luciferase gene (25de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2466) Google Scholar) as a reporter in conjunction with SV40 small t-antigen intron and polyadenylation signal optimized for expression(26van den Hoff M.J.B. Lamers W.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4987-4988Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The vector pT81luc (27Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-457PubMed Google Scholar) contains the firefly luciferase reporter gene driven by the first 81 base pairs of the viral thymidine kinase promoter (28McKnight S.L. Kingsbury R. Science. 1982; 217: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar) and is referred to as “minimized TK promoter.” To transfect equimolar amounts, 3 μg/kbp of CsCl-purified supercoiled plasmid was used. As a control the vector pLT1 without inserted promoter sequences was used. This vector produces 70 × 103 relative light units/mg of protein, which is 1.4 ± 0.4% (S.E., n = 6) of the activity of pLT1 in which the minimal, fully active CPS promoter (−161 to +138 nt with respect to the transcription start site) is inserted (background: 0.1 × 103 relative light units/mg of protein). Differences in transfection efficiency were corrected for by co-transfecting 3 μg of vector pRSVcat (RSV LTR(29Gorman C.M. Merlino G.T. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Howard B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6777-6781Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar)). After each transfection the cell suspension was divided into equal parts, one being grown in culture medium and the other(s) in culture medium supplemented with 100 nM dexamethasone or with 100 nM dexamethasone, 1 mM dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP; Boehringer) and 0.1 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine (IBMX, Sigma) (7Lamers W.H. Zonneveld D. Charles R. Dev. Biol. 1984; 105: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). 44 hours after transfection cells were harvested, lysed in 100 mM KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 7.6, 0.1% Triton X-100, and tested for CAT activity(30Seed B. Sheen J.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar), luciferase activity(31Brasier A.R. Tate J.E. Habener J.F. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 1116-1122PubMed Google Scholar), and protein concentration (bicinchoninic acid reagents, Pierce). FTO-2B hepatoma cells and Rat-1 fibroblasts were transiently transfected as described (24van den Hoff M.J.B. Christoffels V.M. Labruyère W.T. Moorman A.F.M. Lamers W.H. Nickoloff J.A. Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1995Google Scholar) with 31 μg of luciferase construct and 25 μg of pRSV-n-LacZ, encoding β-galactosidase carrying a nuclear translocation signal. 44 hours after transfection, luciferase activity and protein concentration were determined in one well. Cells in the other well were stained for galactosidase activity(32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The specific luciferase activity driven by the promoter of interest (well 1), divided by the transfection efficiency (well 2), is a measure for the activity per transfected cell (24van den Hoff M.J.B. Christoffels V.M. Labruyère W.T. Moorman A.F.M. Lamers W.H. Nickoloff J.A. Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1995Google Scholar). Adult Wistar rats were obtained from the Broekman Institute, B.V., Someren, The Netherlands. Hepatocytes were freshly prepared from 17-day-old fetuses as described(33Blommaart P.J.E. Zonneveld D. Meijer A.J. Lamers W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1610-1617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that DNase was omitted to prevent degradation of plasmid DNA during transfection. Cells were transfected as described, and plated in rat tail collagen-coated dishes containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 and 10% FCS. Non-adhering cells were removed after 5 h. The cultures were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 and 2.5% FCS in the absence or presence of added hormones, and harvested after 20 h. ExoIII-deletion analysis of the 4-kbp fragment that contains the upstream enhancer (15van den Hoff M.J.B. van de Zande L.P.W.G. Dingemanse M.A. Das A.T. Labruyere W. Moorman A.F.M. Charles R. Lamers W.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5) was performed as described in Promega Protocols and Applications Guide. Constructs B, C, D, and E are derived from construct A, in which the 4-kbp enhancer fragment is cloned in positive direction upstream of the 299-bp CPS promoter-containing fragment (−161 to +138). Constructs F and G are derived from a plasmid in which the 4-kbp enhancer fragment was cloned in the opposite direction upstream of the CPS promoter. Constructs H, I, and J are subclones derived from constructs D and F, and are cloned in positive direction upstream of the 299-bp CPS promoter-containing fragment. pRc/RSV-CREB (expression vector expressing CREB) and pRc/RSV-CBP (expression vector encoding full-length mouse CBP) were gifts from R. H. Goodman, 6RGR (expression vector encoding glucocorticoid receptor) was a gift from K. R. Yamamoto, and MT-CEVα (expression vector encoding Cα) was a gift from G. S. McKnight. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the “megaprimer” method (34Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications(35Kuipers O.P. Boot H.J. de Vos W.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4558Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). All CPS promoter constructs are derived from the 299-bp PstIHindIII promoter-containing fragment (position −161 to +138, Fig. 1, HindIII site derived from polylinker of pBluescript SK+) described in (15van den Hoff M.J.B. van de Zande L.P.W.G. Dingemanse M.A. Das A.T. Labruyere W. Moorman A.F.M. Charles R. Lamers W.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To delete sites III and II from the CPS promoter, a 238-bp AflIII-HindIII fragment (position −100 to +138, Fig. 1) was cloned into pLT1. For deletion of sites III, II, and I, primer CAGCCCCTCCTCCCTCTAGAATGTCCAGAGATG (complementary to sense-strand) was used to create a XbaI site (underlined) at position −74 (Fig. 1). The resulting 212-bp XbaI-HindIII fragment was cloned into pLT1. To delete sites III, II, I and the GAG box, a 176-bp AccI-HindIII fragment (position −38 to +138, Fig. 1) was cloned into pLT1. Deletions in the 5′-UTR of the mRNA were made by creating HindIII sites in the 5′-UTR at 50, 89, and 115 nt downstream of the transcription start site of construct 2 (see Fig. 1, construct 2) with oligonucleotides GGGAAGGAAAGCTTTGTGGAGAC, CATGAAAGCTTGTTGTCCAATTTGC and GTGACTAAGCTTAAATCACAAATATCTC, respectively (all complementary to the sense strand; HindIII sites are underlined). The T7 primer of pBluescript was used as complementary primer. All PCR products were sequenced. The putative CRE and GRE element in the 469-bp enhancer fragment (see Fig. 5, construct J) was mutated after subcloning into pBluescript SK+. Primer TTACTTTAGAATCATATTGAGGACTTATTA was used to disrupt the putative CRE and CATCAGAGAAGTTTGATCTGCTCAGCACAT to disrupt the putative GRE. Underlined nucleotides were substituted (see Fig. 6). The T3 and T7 primers were used to fill in both sides flanking the mutagenesis primer. The PCR products were sequenced in both directions. 5 × 106 FTO-2B hepatoma cells were transiently transfected with 30 μg of construct UTR 50, UTR 115, or UTR 138 as described and divided into equal parts. After 48 h the luciferase activity and protein content was determined in the cells of one well, while the cells of the other well were lysed in guanidinium isothiocyanate and loaded onto CsCl cushions for total RNA isolation(36Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16610) Google Scholar). In addition, the RNA samples were treated with 3 units of RNase-free DNase I (RQ1, Promega) for 1 h at 37°C in the presence of 56 units of RNasin (Promega), extracted with phenol and chloroform, and precipitated two times in 2 M LiCl. The concentration of the RNA was determined at 260 nm and the integrity by formaldehyde-agarose gels. The concentration of luciferase-SV40 mRNA hybrids was determined by reverse transcriptase-PCR (avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase, Promega), using a mimic DNA construct as internal standard(37Cottrez F. Auriault C. Capron A. Groux H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2712-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The mimic construct contains identical SV40 sequences, but, in addition, a 129-bp unrelated fragment. The primers (SV40+, CTGTGGTGTGACATAATTGG; and SV40-, TACTAAACACAGCATGACTCA) recognize sites flanking the intron, leading to amplification of a 263-bp fragment from the mRNA, a 328-bp fragment from the unspliced RNA or from the plasmid DNA, and a 465-bp fragment from the mimic construct. In each reaction 1 μg of total RNA was used. The products of the RT-PCR reaction were separated on 3% Metaphor-agarose (FMC). Plasmid DNA isolation, PCR, subcloning, restriction analysis, and Western blot analysis were performed as described(32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were obtained from Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium. Double-stranded DNA was sequenced using the dideoxy procedure(38Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar). Three regions in the CPS gene appeared to be involved in the regulation of expression, viz. the 161-bp proximal promoter, the 138-bp 5′-UTR of the mRNA, and the 4-kbp far-upstream enhancer fragment(15van den Hoff M.J.B. van de Zande L.P.W.G. Dingemanse M.A. Das A.T. Labruyere W. Moorman A.F.M. Charles R. Lamers W.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These regions were systematically investigated for their contribution to tissue specificity and response to physiologically relevant hormones. Two approaches were used to investigate whether the 299-bp CPS promoter-containing fragment (from −161 to +138 relative to the transcription start site(15van den Hoff M.J.B. van de Zande L.P.W.G. Dingemanse M.A. Das A.T. Labruyere W. Moorman A.F.M. Charles R. Lamers W.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar)) confers tissue-specific expression. As a first approach, 5′ sequences of the CPS promoter were deleted, and the resulting derivatives were tested in FTO-2B hepatoma cells and Rat-1 fibroblasts (Fig. 1). Elements upstream of the GAG box did not substantially alter reporter gene expression in either FTO-2B or Rat-1 cells. Deletion of the GAG box, however, decreased activity to 30-40%. In both cell lines the CPS promoter appeared to be sensitive to added hormones, possibly due to enhanced expression of general transcription factors. The minimal fully active CPS promoter was 50 times more active in FTO-2B cells than the minimized TK promoter. Since the activity of the CPS promoter was similar in hepatoma and fibroblast cells (Fig. 1), this sequence probably does not confer tissue specificity. To establish this conclusion more firmly, luciferase activity per transfected cell was determined. This approach (Fig. 2) clearly demonstrated that the activity of the CPS promoter was quantitatively comparable in FTO-2B and Rat-1 cells and, hence, does not confer tissue specificity. The minimized TK promoter, containing only the proximal GC box and a TATA box, was less active in the hepatoma cell lines than in the fibroblasts. The GC box, target of the Sp1 protein and the main determinant of the strength of this promoter (28McKnight S.L. Kingsbury R. Science. 1982; 217: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 39Majumder S. Miranda M. DePamphilis M.L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1131-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) may therefore be hardly functional in hepatoma cell lines, in accordance with the relatively low concentrations of Sp1 in hepatocytes(40Saffer J.D. Jackson S.P. Annarella M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). A promoter fragment lacking the 5′-untranslated region of the mRNA, showed a dramatically lower expression in transfection studies(15van den Hoff M.J.B. van de Zande L.P.W.G. Dingemanse M.A. Das A.T. Labruyere W. Moorman A.F.M. Charles R. Lamers W.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Several promoter fragments lacking parts of the 5′-UTR were therefore transfected into FTO-2B cells. Fig. 3A shows that the entire UTR was needed for high promoter activity. If only 23 nt were deleted (construct U 115), 80% of the activity was lost. In primary hepatocytes the activity of U 115 was 47 ± 5% (S.E., n = 5) of that of construct U 138, showing that the observation does not result from using established cell lines. The ratio between hormone-stimulated expression and basal expression is comparable for all constructs, indicating that the 5′-UTR is not involved in the hormonal sensitivity of promoter. The contribution of the 5′-UTR to tissue specificity was tested by transfection to Rat-1 fibroblasts and MH1C1 hepatoma cells (Table 1). Although promoter activity was most affected by the deletions of the 5′-UTR in FTO-2B, the effects were similar in MH1C1 and Rat-1, indicating that it plays no role in tissue specificity. To test whether the 5′-UTR is an independent stimulator of expression, it was cloned downstream of the minimized TK promoter. Fig. 3B shows that this fragment (+3 to +138) is not able to enhance expression in combination with this promoter. To discriminate between transcriptional and post-transcriptional effects on expression, the levels of RNA obtained from the constructs containing the full-length UTR and two deletion constructs were determined (Fig. 4). Whereas the relative concentrations of luciferase-SV40 mRNA hybrids were found to be similar, the full-length UTR gave a 4-5-fold higher expression than both deletion constructs. This result shows that the 5′-UTR affects expression at the post-transcriptional, and probably at the translational level.Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Figure 4Luciferase mRNA levels produced by full-length and truncated 5′-UTR constructs in FTO-2B cells.

Dingemanse M.A. Das A.T. Labruyere W. Moorman A.F.M. Charles R. Lamers W.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To delineate these cis-acting elements more precisely, the 4-kbp fragment was subjected to an ExoIII-deletion analysis. The fragments from the ExoIII library were tested in combination with the 161-bp CPS promoter (Fig. 5). None of the fragments caused stimulation of basal expression, but the response to both dexamethasone and the combination of dexamethasone and Bt2cAMP was found to be delimited by the 5′ and 3′ borders of constructs D and F, respectively (Fig. 5). This region alone (construct H in Fig. 5) was as active as either construct D or F. Further deletions confined the enhancer activity to a 469-bp fragment (construct J in Fig. 5). The differentially methylated CCGG (15van den Hoff M.J.B. van de Zande L.P.W.G. Dingemanse M.A. Das A.T. Labruyere W. Moorman A.F.M. Charles R. Lamers W.H. Eur. J.

A number of sites resembling known liver-enriched factor binding-sites (HNF3, −4, and −5) and hormone-responsive elements (CRE and GRE) were identified (Fig. 6). The same enhancer fragments that caused hormonal induction of reporter gene expression in FTO-2B hepatomas, also stimulated hormone-dependent expression in Rat-1 fibroblasts (Fig. 5), but 6-fold less. This cell-specific difference in activation properties of the enhancer became more pronounced when the 469-bp enhancer fragment was tested in combination with the minimized TK promoter (Fig. 7). The expression obtained with this fragment in FTO-2B cells was 340-fold induced, compared to the TK promoter itself, while only a 12-fold induction was seen in Rat-1 cells, i.e. an almost 30-fold difference. These results show that the tissue specificity conferred by the enhancer is independent of the promoter. The strength of the 470-bp enhancer fragment was also tested in two hepatoma cell lines (FTO-2B and MH1C1) and two fibroblast lines (Rat-1 and CHO-K1) and compared to the endogenous CPS expression i"
https://openalex.org/W2014480381,"We have previously observed that the chronic effects of streptozotocin-induced diabetes cause a decrease in the total hepatic glycogen phosphorylase activity with a corresponding reduction in the phosphorylase protein levels. These effects were normalized by insulin administration to diabetic rats. There was no change in the total glycogen synthase activity as a result of diabetes or insulin supplementation. These results are extended to examine the effects of diabetes and insulin administration to diabetic animals on the expression of phosphorylase and glycogen synthase enzymes. The expression (i.e. mRNA levels) of phosphorylase was down-regulated (45% of normal levels) in diabetic livers, and this was normalized by insulin supplementation to diabetic animals. Diabetes or insulin supplementation to diabetic rats showed no effect on the transcription rate of phosphorylase. As expected, diabetes (or insulin administration to diabetic animals) did not cause any alteration in the mRNA levels or in the transcription rate of hepatic glycogen synthase. The stability of phosphorylase mRNA was then examined using hepatocytes prepared from normal and diabetic rats. Diabetes caused a decrease in the half-life of phosphorylase mRNA from 14 h in normal hepatocytes to 6.5 h in diabetic hepatocytes. Insulin supplementation to the medium of diabetic hepatocytes increased the half-life of phosphorylase mRNA to a level comparable with normal values. This study indicates that the chronic effect of insulin on the activation of the total hepatic phosphorylase activity (and protein) is mediated through the stabilization of its mRNA levels.

As expected, diabetes (or insulin administration to diabetic animals) did not cause any alteration in the mRNA levels or in the transcription rate of hepatic glycogen synthase. The stability of phosphorylase mRNA was then examined using hepatocytes prepared from normal and diabetic rats. Diabetes caused a decrease in the half-life of phosphorylase mRNA from 14 h in normal hepatocytes to 6.5 h in diabetic hepatocytes. Insulin supplementation to the medium of diabetic hepatocytes increased the half-life of phosphorylase mRNA to a level comparable with normal values. This study indicates that the chronic effect of insulin on the activation of the total hepatic phosphorylase activity (and protein) is mediated through the stabilization of its mRNA levels."

Dimethyl sulfate footprinting allowed the detection of protein-DNA interactions within the rat analogues of the human binding sites for the transcription termination factor mTERF and for the transcription activating factor mtTFA. Although mTERF contacts were localized only at the boundary between the 16S rRNA/tRNALeuUUR genes, multiple mtTFA contacts were detected. Contact sites were located in the light and the heavy strand promoters and, in agreement with in vitro footprinting data on human mitochondria, between the conserved sequence blocks (CSB) 1 and 2 and inside CSB-1. Potassium permanganate footprinting allowed detection of a 25-base pair region entirely contained in CSB-1 in which both strands were permanganate-reactive. No permanganate reactivity was associated with the other regions of the D-loop, including CSB-2 and −3, and with the mTERF contact site. We hypothesize that the single-stranded DNA at CSB-1 may be due to a profound helix distortion induced by mtTFA binding or be associated with a RNA polymerase pause site. In any case the location in CSB-1 of the 3′ end of the most abundant replication primer and of the 5′ end of the prominent D-loop DNA suggests that protein-induced DNA conformational changes play an important role in directing the transition from transcription to replication in mammalian mitochondria.

https://openalex.org/W2002343239,"Insulin resistance is a common clinical feature of obesity and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and is characterized by elevated serum levels of glucose, insulin, and lipids. The mechanism by which insulin resistance is acquired is unknown. We have previously demonstrated that upon chronic treatment of fibroblasts with insulin, conditions that mimic the hyperinsulinemia associated with insulin resistance, the membrane-associated insulin receptor β subunit is proteolytically cleaved, resulting in the generation of a cytosolic fragment of the β subunit, β‘, and that the generation of β‘ is inhibited by the thiol protease inhibitor E64 (Knutson, V.

In this report, we demonstrate that in 3T3-L1 adipocytes: 1) cytosolic β‘ is generated by chronic insulin administration to the cells, and that E64 inhibits the production of β‘; 2) chronic administration of insulin to the adipocytes leads to an insulin-resistant state, as measured by lipogenesis and glycogen synthesis, and E64 totally prevents the generation of this insulin-induced cellular insulin resistance; 3) E64 has no effect on the insulin-induced down-regulation of insulin receptor substrate-1, and therefore insulin resistance is not mediated by the down-regulation of insulin receptor substrate-1; 4) under in vitro conditions, partially purified β‘ stoichiometrically inhibits the insulin-induced autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor β subunit; and 5) administration of E64 to obese Zucker fatty rats improves the insulin resistance of the rats compared to saline-treated animals.

These data indicate that β‘ is a mediator of insulin resistance, and the mechanism of action of β‘ is the inhibition of the insulin-induced autophosphorylation of the β subunit of the insulin receptor. Insulin resistance is a characteristic clinical feature of a number of disease states, chief among them diabetes mellitus, and is associated with hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension (reviewed in (1Sowers J.R. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1992; 32: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and (2Häring H.U. Diabetologia. 1991; 34: 848-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar)). The potential mechanisms by which cellular insulin resistance is generated are many: a mutation in the gene coding for the insulin receptor protein, resulting in a decreased expression of the protein; a decrease in the binding of insulin; a decrease in the number of insulin receptor molecules expressed on the plasma membrane of the target cell; or a so-called “post-receptor defect” in which there is a decreased interaction between the insulin receptor and downstream effector molecules. Natural mutations in the primary sequence of the insulin receptor have been identified in patients with extreme forms of insulin resistance (3O'Rahilly S. Moller D.E. Clin.

Mutations in the extracellular ligand binding domain of the receptor have been shown to result in a decreased affinity of insulin for the receptor(5Kadowaki T. Bevins C.L. Cama A. Ojamaa K.

Mutations have also been documented in the intracellular β subunit of the receptor, especially in the ATP binding domain and the autophosphorylation domain of the receptor protein, resulting in a decreased tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor(10Taylor S.I.

However, of the many individuals who demonstrate insulin resistance, only a small number of them have been shown to have mutations in the primary sequence of the insulin receptor protein (13Moller D.E.

Therefore, sequence abnormalities in the insulin receptor protein cannot alone account for insulin resistance, and is not, therefore, a frequent mechanism leading to the insulin-resistant state (2Häring H.U. Diabetologia. 1991; 34: 848-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Insulin resistance induced by a decrease in receptor number could occur as a result of changes in the mRNA levels for the protein, a decreased efficiency of post-translational processing of the newly synthesized receptor protein, or a down-regulation of the level of the receptor in the cell. A decrease in the cellular levels of insulin receptor mRNA has been documented in a number of cases(18Muller-Wieland D. Taub R. Tewari D.S. Kriauciunas K.M. Reddy S.S. Kahn C.R.

Genet. 1992; 50: 998-1007PubMed Google Scholar), with concomitant decreases in the level of insulin receptor protein. A decreased rate of insertion of the insulin receptor into the plasma membrane has also been demonstrated(10Taylor S.I. Cama A. Accili D. Barbetti F. Imano E. Kadowaki H. Kadowaki T. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1991; 73: 1158-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 11Taylor S.I. Kadowaki T. Kadowaki H. Accili D. Cama A. McKeaon C.

Endocrinol. 1992; 36: 121-136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), primarily as a result of mutations in the primary sequence of the insulin binding α subunit of the receptor. An elevated rate of degradation of the insulin receptor protein, resulting in a decreased steady-state level of cellular receptor, has also been found to be due to specific modifications in the primary sequence of the receptor(5Kadowaki T. Bevins C.L. Cama A. Ojamaa K. Marcus-Samuels B. Kadowaki H. Beitz L. McKeon C. Taylor S.I. Science. 1988; 240: 787-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 6Kadowaki H. Kadowaki T. Cama A. Marcus-Samuels B. Rovira A. Bevins C. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21285-21296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, an extremely consistent finding, both in vivo, in hyperinsulinemic animals models and humans, and in cultured cells, is that the steady-state level of the insulin receptor is decreased by chronic exposure of the cells and tissues to insulin(23Bar R.S. Gorden P. Roth J. Kahn C.R. De Meyts P. J. Clin. Invest. 1976; 58: 1123-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 24Soll A.H. Kahn C.R. Neville D.M. Roth J. J. Clin.

Chem. 1981; 256: 1689-1694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In cultured cells, this down-regulation of the insulin receptor has been demonstrated to be due to an accelerated rate of receptor inactivation and degradation(27Knutson V.P. Ronnett G.V. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2822-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 28Ronnett G.V. Knutson V.P. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4285-4291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, a significant degree of insulin resistance could be explained by the insulin-induced down-regulation of the insulin receptor. Modifications in the insulin signal transduction pathway distal to the actual binding of insulin to the receptor could also account for the insulin-resistant state. These processes could be brought about by a change in the insulin-induced autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor β subunit, a decrease in the tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor, or a decrease in the cellular levels of the substrates of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase. A significant body of work has documented that compared to normal patients, in insulin-resistant patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, insulin binding to the receptor results in a decreased level of tyrosine autophosphorylation in the major catalytic domain of the receptor. This decreased autophosphorylation subsequently leads to the decreased activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase activity(29Caro J.F. Dohm L.G. Pories W.J. Sinha M.K. Diabetes/Metab. Rev. 1989; 5: 665-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 30Obermaier-Kusser B. White M.F. Pongratz D.E. Su Z. Ermel B. Muhlbacher C. Haring H.U. J. Biol.

Decreased levels of the coupling molecules or effector molecules in the insulin signal transduction pathway could also account for insulin resistance. Multiple substrates of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase have been identified(33Kasuga M. Izumi T. Tobe K. Diabetes Care. 1990; 13: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). One of the best characterized substrates is alternately denoted pp160, pp185, or insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1)1(34Rothenberg P.L. Lane W.S. Karasik A. Backer J. White M. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8302-8311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Sun X.J. Rothenberg P. Kahn C.R. Backer J.M. Araki E. Wilden P.A. Cahill D.A. Goldstein B.J. White M.F.

Acta. 1993; 1172: 323-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that upon chronic treatment of cultured cells with insulin, conditions which result in the down-regulation of the receptor, the IRS-1 levels in the cell also down-regulate(37Rice K.M. Turnbow M.A. Garner C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These data suggest that insulin resistance might be a consequence of the insulin-induced down-regulation of coupling molecules in the insulin signaling pathway. We have previously demonstrated that upon chronic treatment of cultured fibroblasts with insulin, the cellular level of the intact insulin receptor protein decreases, and a fragment of the insulin receptor β subunit is produced and released from the cellular membranes into the cytosol of the cell(38Knutson V.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15656-15662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that this fragment, β‘, is also produced in cultured adipocytes, and that inhibition of the generation of β‘ with the thiol protease inhibitor E64 results in the total abrogation of insulin-induced insulin resistance in cultured adipocytes, even though IRS-1 levels are maintained in a down regulated state. Furthermore, administration of E64 to Zucker fatty rats results in a decrease of plasma triglyceride levels compared to control animals, and a decrease in the expression of β‘ in the tissues of the obese treated rats. In vitro, partially purified β‘ inhibits the insulin-induced autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor. These data indicate that β‘ mediates insulin resistance by inhibiting the autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor. Cell culture media and sera were purchased from JRH (Kansas City, MO). Tissue culture plastic was purchased from Falcon, Becton Dickinson (Lincoln Park, NJ). Purified insulin was obtained from Elanco (Indianapolis, IN). Carrier-free Na125I, [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), Hyperfilm x-ray film, and the enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (ECL) for immunoblot analysis were obtained from Amersham Corp.

Magnetized beads for conjugation to antibodies (Dynabeads M-450) were obtained from Dynal Inc. (Great Neck, NY). Female obese Zucker fatty rats (fa/fa), or age-matched lean Zucker rats (Fa/?) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Boston, MA). Serum glucose levels were quantitated by the glucose oxidase method with a kit purchased from Sigma Diagnostics. Blood triglyceride levels were quantitated spectrophotometrically with reagents obtained from Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics. Insulin levels were quantitated by radio-immunoassay with a kit obtained from Pharmacia Diagnostics. Reagents for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and horseradish peroxide-coupled rabbit IgG were obtained from Bio-Rad. Biochemicals were obtained from Sigma or Calbiochem unless otherwise noted. All other reagents were of analytical grade or better and were obtained from common supply houses. Embryonic mouse 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media containing 10% charcoal-filtered calf serum, in a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2, as described previously(39Knutson V.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10306-10312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were induced to differentiate into adipocytes and were subsequently maintained in the differentiated phenotype as described previously (28Ronnett G.V. Knutson V.P. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4285-4291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All experiments were performed with cell monolayers whose cell culture media had been changed 18-24 h before the beginning of the experiment. Cellular membranes containing the intact insulin receptor and cellular cytosol containing the fragment of the insulin receptor β subunit, β‘, were prepared from 10-cm dishes of fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, as we have previously described for 3T3-C2 fibroblasts(38Knutson V.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15656-15662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, monolayers were preincubated with 1.7 μM insulin in complete cell culture media for the indicated periods of time. The monolayers were then removed from the CO2 incubator, washed with phosphate-buffered saline at 4°C, and scraped into cell lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, at 4°C, containing the following protease inhibitors: leupeptin, 1 μg/ml; pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml; chymostatin, 1 μg/ml; benzamidine, 10 μg/ml; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mM; E64, 5 μg/ml; EDTA, 10 μM), homogenized in a glass homogenizer with a tight-fitting, motor-driven Teflon pestle, and the homogenate was subjected to centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 45 min. The fat cake was discarded, the infranatant was utilized as the cytosolic fraction, and the pellet contained the cellular membranes. The pellet was extracted into cell lysis buffer containing 4% Triton X-100. Following homogenization of the pellet, the sample was incubated on ice for 1 h to optimize extraction of the membrane proteins, and then subjected to centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 45 min. Following removal of any residual fat cake, this supernatant contained the extracted membrane proteins, including the intact insulin receptor. The cytosolic fraction contained β‘. This crude cytosolic fraction was either utilized directly for immunoblot analysis of β‘ or IRS-1 (see below) or the β‘ in this fraction was further purified by preparative isoelectric focusing. Preparative isoelectric focusing was performed in the Rotofor apparatus (Bio-Rad), over a pH range of 2-12. The crude cytosol was added to 2 ml of 40% ampholytes, and the mixture was subjected to focusing in the cooled chamber, as described by the manufacturer. During the isoelectric focusing, the temperature was maintained at approximately 5°C. Following focusing, the gradient was fractionated into 20 fractions. The pH of the fractions was determined, and an aliquot of each fraction was subjected to reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblot analysis to localize β‘ (see below). Fractions containing β‘ were pooled and utilized in the insulin receptor autophosphorylation assay (see below). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on discontinuous 7.5% gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with the antibodies, as described previously(40Knutson V.P. Buck R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 285: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The antibody utilized to detect the β subunit of the insulin receptor and β‘ is denoted anti-P5 antibody, and was utilized at a concentration of 5 μg/ml. The antibody against IRS-1 was utilized at a concentration of 4 μg/ml. Enhanced chemiluminescence was used to detect the immunoreactive bands, as described by the manufacturer. In order to reprobe a membrane with a second primary antibody, the nitrocellulose membranes were stripped by incubation with 75 mM dithiothreitol in 50 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl, pH 8, with agitation. After 1 h, this buffer was removed from the membrane, NaSCN was added to the solution to a concentration of 3 M, and the incubation was continued for an additional 18 h. Subsequent detection of antibody bound to the membrane by enhanced chemiluminescence demonstrated no residual signal, and no apparent loss of immobilized proteins by the stripping process for a total of three rounds of stripping and reprobing (data not shown). Quantitation of the immunoblots was performed by densitometry with a Bioimage 60S (Milligen/Bioresearch, Division of Millipore). Lipogenesis and glycogen synthesis, utilizing [14C]glucose as a substrate, and glucose uptake, monitoring the rates of uptake of [3H]2-deoxyglucose, were performed as described previously.2 Briefly, fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes in 6-cm culture dishes were preincubated with 1.7 μM insulin in the presence or absence of E64 for 0-18 h, as indicated in the legends to the figures. Following the preincubation, the monolayers were exhaustively washed with Kreb's-Ringer-phosphate buffer containing 25 mM glucose and 2% bovine serum albumin (radioimmunoassay grade) over a 1-h period. We previously demonstrated that this wash procedure removes all insulin and insulin degradation products from the cell monolayers(27Knutson V.P. Ronnett G.V. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2822-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 28Ronnett G.V. Knutson V.P. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4285-4291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following this wash procedure, the cell monolayers were stimulated with 0-25 nM insulin in 3 ml of Kreb's-Ringer-phosphate buffer for 20 min at 37°C. To each dish was then added the radiolabeled substrate, and the incubation was allowed to proceed for an additional 20 min. Incorporation of radiolabel into cellular lipids and cellular glycogen was a linear function of time from 0 to at least 30 min (data not shown). Uptake of deoxyglucose was a linear function of time from 0 to at least 45 min (data not shown). The monolayers were then washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the cellular material was either extracted into organic solvents for the quantitation of cellular lipids, precipitated with ethanol to quantitate cellular glycogen, or counted directly to assess deoxyglucose uptake. Duplicate or triplicate determinations were made in each experiment, and each experiment was performed at least three times. Quantitation of the radiolabeled material was performed by the method of internal standards. The insulin receptor extracted from the cellular membrane pellet was partially purified by affinity chromatography over wheat germ agarose, and eluted with 0.3 MN-acetyl glucosamine. A constant amount of insulin receptor was incubated with graded concentrations of β‘ for 10 min before the addition of 100 nM insulin or buffer alone. After incubation for 20 min at room temperature, [γ-32P]ATP was added to the assay at a final concentration of 15 μM, 20 μCi/assay (170 μl total volume). The final assay contained 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mM MnCl2, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM molybdate, 0.1% ovalbumin, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The assay was terminated after 1 h by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE as described above, on two replicate gels. One gel was stained, destained, and dried. Radioactivity associated with the insulin receptor β subunit (92 kDa) and β‘ (61 kDa) was quantitated with a Betagen Betascope 603 blot analyzer. The proteins in the second gel were transferred to nitrocellulose and subjected to immunoblot analysis with the antibody against the insulin receptor β subunit. The relative proportions of β subunit and β‘ were calculated from the immunoblot by densitometry. Six female obese (fa/fa) and six female lean (Fa/?) rats were obtained from the breeder at the age of 12 weeks. The animals were fed ad libitum and maintained on 12-h light/dark cycles. Over the following 2-week period, blood was drawn from the tail artery of the animals under mild ether anesthesia, and the levels of insulin, glucose, and triglycerides were quantitated. At the age of 14 weeks, when the insulin resistance of the animals was fully manifest, the E64 protocol was initiated. E64 was dissolved in saturated sodium bicarbonate and diluted with normal saline. Three fatty rats and three lean rats were injected intraperitoneally with E64 (2.5 mg/kg), in a total volume of 0.3 ml, every 24 ± 2 h. Three fatty rats and three lean rats received vehicle alone. Before collecting blood samples, the rats were fasted for approximately 4 h. Following collection from the tail artery, the blood was allowed to clot, and serum was collected. Aliquots for triglyceride analysis were collected and stored at −20°C. The remaining serum was subjected to centrifugation at 210,000 × g for 40 min at 4°C. This procedure resulted in the formation of a fat cake at the top of the sample. The infranatant was collected and stored at −20°C for insulin and glucose determinations. Blood was collected on the following days, where day 1 was the first injection day: −15, −9, −4, 2, 5, 10, 14, and at 7-day intervals thereafter, up to and including day 89. On day 89 of the protocol, the rats were sacrificed by decapitation and liver, abdominal adipose tissue, and hind limb skeletal muscle were quickly excised, blotted, and weighed. The tissues were immediately frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogen, and the tissues were then stored at −70°C. To extract the proteins from the tissues, the tissues were cooled in liquid nitrogen and pulverized in a mortar precooled to −70°C. To extract the intact insulin receptor from the tissue, the powdered tissue was then added to the extraction buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM vanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mM leupeptin, 544 mM iodoacetamide, and 10 mM E64) at approximately 5 ml of buffer/g of tissue. The tissue was extracted for 1.5 h with rocking at 4°C, and the insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet and fat cake were discarded, and the infranatant was utilized for subsequent analyses. To obtain β‘ from the tissues, the identical procedure was utilized, except the Triton X-100 was omitted from the extraction buffer. The intact insulin receptor and β‘ were immunoprecipitated from the tissue extracts with anti-P5 antibody coupled to Dynabeads. The Dynabeads were coupled to either anti-P5 antibody or normal rabbit IgG following the manufacturer's directions. Tissue extracts, either a total of 1 mg of muscle or liver protein or 0.1 mg of adipose protein, were preabsorbed onto 4 ml of Dynabeads coupled to rabbit IgG for 5 h, 4°C with rocking. The beads were pelleted, and the supernatant was then added to 4 ml of anti-P5 antibody-coupled beads. The incubation was continued for an additional 12 h. The beads were pelleted and washed three times with 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% deoxycholate and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. The proteins absorbed onto the beads were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis as described above, utilizing the anti-P5 antibody to detect the intact β subunit and β‘. All experiments were performed at least three times, and within each experiment, each data point was performed in duplicate or triplicate. All data are presented as the mean value ± S.D. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test; where appropriate, p values are indicated in the legends to the figures. To verify in 3T3-L1 adipocytes the precursor-product relationship between the insulin receptor β subunit and the cytosolic fragment β‘, and to verify that E64, the irreversible thiol proteinase inhibitor, inhibits the proteolysis of intact β subunit, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with 1.7 μM insulin for 0, 5, or 18 h in the absence or presence of E64. Immunoblot analysis of the membrane fraction of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with the anti-P5 antibody (specific for the carboxyl terminus of the β subunit of the insulin receptor) is shown in Fig. 1A, and densitometric analysis of the blot is shown in Fig. 1B. After 5 h of insulin incubation (-E64, lanes 3 and 4), the intensity of the intact, 92-kDa β subunit of the insulin receptor is decreased by approximately 35% compared to 0 h of insulin treatment (lanes 1 and 2). By 18 h of insulin treatment, intact β subunit is even further decreased by approximately 67% (+E64, lanes 7 and 8). This insulin-induced loss of immunodetectable β subunit is consistent with the insulin-induced loss of insulin binding activity we have previously reported in 3T3-L1 adipocytes(28Ronnett G.V. Knutson V.P. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4285-4291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When 100 μM E64 was added simultaneously with the insulin, the E64 inhibited the insulin-induced loss of membrane-associated intact β subunit at 5 h (+E64, lanes 5 and 6; compare with control lanes 1 and 2). After coincubation of both insulin and E64 for 18 h (+E64, lanes 9 and 10), E64 was only partially effecti"

Growth Factors. 1991; 5: 3-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Since circulating levels of IGF-I are more responsive to changes in metabolic status than are levels of IGF-II(2Schwander J.

While IGF-I is expressed in many organs and tissues, consistent with paracrine regulation and a role as a local growth factor, its expression is 50-100 times higher in the liver than in other tissues, consistent with hepatic origin of circulating IGF-I, and a role as an endocrine regulator of growth(1Rotwein P.

The single rIGF-I gene gives rise to a complex family of mRNAs with both size and coding sequence heterogeneity (9Lowe Jr., W.L. Roberts Jr., C.T. Lasky S.R. LeRoith D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Multiple in-frame initiator codons within 5′ sequences specify different amino-terminal signal peptides, and preprolGFs with signal peptides containing 22, 32, or 48 amino acids are synthesized depending on utilization of different AUGs(9Lowe Jr., W.L.

Initiation of transcription is also complex, as several laboratories have identified multiple transcription initiation sites in exons 1 and 2 of the rat, sheep, and human genes(12Adamo M. Ben-Hur H. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1677-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 13Adamo M.L. Ben-Hur H. LeRoith D. Roberts C.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In the rIGF-I gene, initiation sites extend over 140 bp in exon 1, and 770 bp in exon 2(13Adamo M.L. Ben-Hur H. LeRoith D. Roberts C.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 887-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, Adamo et al.(13Adamo M.L. Ben-Hur H. LeRoith D. Roberts C.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 887-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) found that two initiation sites in exon 1 could account for 70-80% of IGF-I gene transcription in adult rat liver. Thus, although rat IGF-I gene transcription is regulated by two distinct promoters, the exon 1 promoter appears to be dominant. Since relatively little is known about molecular regulation of IGF-I gene transcription, we have focused on the liver; while several laboratories have begun to study the basis of IGF-I gene transcription in different immortal cell lines(14Hall L.J.

L., (1994) Endocrine Society 76th Annual Meeting, p. 234 (abstr.), Anaheim, CA.Google Scholar), there has been little evaluation of underlying mechanisms in the dominant source of IGF-I production(1Rotwein P.

Bell G.I. Friesen H.G. Endocrinology. 1987; 120: 1279-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Analysis of findings from several laboratories suggests that downstream regions may play a role in IGF-I gene expression(17Sussenbach J.S. Jansen E. Nolten L. Steenbergh P.H. Growth Regul. 1994; 4 (abstr.): 1136Google Scholar, 18Lowe, W. L., Jr., (1994) Endocrine Society 76th Annual Meeting, p. 330 (abstr.), Anaheim, CA.Google Scholar, 19Wang, X., Yang, Y., Adamo, M.

Growth Regul. 1994; 4 (abstr.): 126Google Scholar), but such an hypothesis has not been tested in the liver. In the present study, we demonstrate that sequences downstream from the exon 1 major transcription initiation site are important both for hepatic IGF-I expression and metabolic regulation, we characterize nuclear protein binding to downstream sequences, and we identify two regions that may be involved in the decreased IGF-I gene transcription associated with diabetes mellitus. Restriction endonucleases and DNA modifying enzymes were obtained from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA); streptozotocin from Pfanstiehl (Waukegan, IL); [τ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol), [α-32P]dATP, and [α-32P]dGTP (800 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham Corp. Oligonucleotides were from Operon Technology (Alameda, CA); luciferase and luciferin were from Boehringer Mannheim. Superscript RNase H- reverse transcriptase was from Life Technologies, Inc., and DNase I was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. All other chemicals (of molecular biology grade) were purchased from Sigma. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, Lexington, MA), weighing approximately 120-160 g, were fed ad libitum. Chronic diabetes was produced through tail vein injection of streptozotocin 140 mg/kg. Animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation 5-7 days later, and livers were used for nuclear extract preparation immediately. Streptozotocin at 250 mg/kg was used to produce acute diabetes, with sacrifice of animals two days after injection. Constructs with IGF-I sequences cloned into a luciferase reporter (p0Luc) were generously provided by Dr. Peter Rotwein from Washington University, as reported previously(14Hall L.J. Kajimoto Y. Bichell D. Kim S. James P.L. Counts D. Nixon L.J. Tobin G. Rotwein P. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Relative to the rIGF-I exon 1 major transcription initiation site (181 bp upstream from the leader sequence(7Pao C.-I. Farmer P.K. Begovic S. Goldstein S. Wu G. Phillips L.S. Mol.

Hepatocytes were isolated from 150-200-g male Sprague-Dawley rats using a modification of the collagenase perfusion method of Seglen(21Seglen P.O. Exp. Cell Res. 1973; 82: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar), as reported previously(5Goldstein S. Harp J.B. Phillips L.S. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 6: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 8Pao C.-I. Farmer P.K. Begovic S. Villafuerte B.C. Wu G. Robertson D.G. Phillips L.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1561-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with 6 μg of supercoiled DNA calcium-phosphate precipitate in a volume of 0.3 ml/plate 5 h after plating(22Ginot F. Decaux J. Cognet M. Berbar T. Levrat F. Kahn A. Weber A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Following overnight exposure to the DNA, the cells were rinsed twice with 4 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and placed in 3 ml of serum-free defined medium containing 10-7 M insulin and 500 ng/ml human growth hormone, since both insulin and growth hormone increase IGF-I secretion in primary cultures of hepatocytes(23Phillips L.S. Goldstein S. Pao C.-I. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 1525-1530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After 24 h, the cells were rinsed twice with 4 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 0.7 ml of 50 mM Tris-MES, pH 7.8, containing 1 mM DTT and 1% Triton X-100. Following centrifugation, 50 μl of the supernatant was assayed for luciferase activity in a 200-μl reaction containing 50 mM Tris-MES, pH 7.8, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 2 mM ATP, and 0.5 mM luciferin. Standard curves were performed with purified luciferase to ensure linearity. In all experiments, transfections were performed in triplicate plates for each condition. Liver nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Gorski et al.(24Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar) and Triezenberg et al.(25Triezenberg S.J. LaMarco K.L. McKnight S.L. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 730-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Briefly, 15 g of tissue were homogenized in 120 ml of buffer containing 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.6, 25 mM KCl, 0.15 mM spermine, 0.5 mM spermidine, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 2.0 M sucrose. The homogenate was layered onto a 2 M sucrose cushion and centrifuged at 27,000 rpm in an SW28 rotor at 4°C for 1 h. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in lysing buffer containing 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.6, 100 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 10% glycerol at a concentration of 10 A260/ml. Nuclei were lysed by adding one-tenth of a volume of 4 M (NH4)2SO4, and chromatin was removed by centrifugation at 39,000 rpm in an SW40 rotor for 2 h. Nuclear proteins were concentrated by (NH4)2SO4 precipitation (0.33 g/ml) and dialyzed against buffer containing 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.6, 100 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 10% glycerol for 4 h. Proteinase inhibitors (0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mM benzamidine, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin) were added to buffers just before use. Extracts prepared from animals with either acute or chronic diabetes had comparable activity with in vitro transcription assays. For mutants with deletion of +84 to +152 bp, the wild type template was linearized with BstXI, treated with Bal 31 nuclease, and then religated. Other mutants were constructed by polymerase chain reaction, similar to methods described by Higuchi et al.(26Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar). Primers used are in Table 1. In each case, a −309/+373-bp polymerase chain reaction product with specific internal deletions was digested with BanII and BglII, gel purified, and then subcloned into a wild type template. All mutants were sequenced.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Transcription reactions (30 μl) contained 1.0 μg of linear DNA template, 50 ng of pAML(C2AT)190, 60 μg of liver extract, 50 mM KC1, 6 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM ATP and CTP, 35 μM UTP, 10 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (400 Ci/mmol), 0.1 mM 3′-O-methyl GTP, 10% glycerol, I u/μl RNasin, 0.05 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT. The DNA template and extract were incubated on ice for 20 min. Transcription was then initiated by the addition of nucleotides and carried out for at 30°C for 45 min. The transcripts were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction, ethanol precipitated, separated on an 8 M urea, 6% polyacrylamide gel, and visualized by autoradiography. When transcription assays were performed in the presence of 0.5 mM of ATP, UTP, GTP, and CTP, the DNA template was degraded by 50 units of RNase-free DNase I as described previously (7Pao C.-I. Farmer P.K. Begovic S. Goldstein S. Wu G. Phillips L.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 969-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and the RNA synthesized in vitro was quantitated by primer extension. Oligonucleotides complementary to the sequence from +42 to +61 or +79 to +101 were end-labeled by polynucleotide kinase to a specific activity of 108 cpm/μg. Probe (50 × 104 cpm) was annealed to RNA synthesized in vitro, to 10 μg of yeast tRNA, or to 10-30 μg of liver RNA at 42°C for 3 h. The cDNA was synthesized as described by Boorstein and Craig (27Boorstein W.R. Craig E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 101: 347-368Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar) at 42°C for 1 h, ethanol precipitated, and separated on an 8 M urea, 6% polyacrylamide gel. Plasmid DNA containing an 0.9-kilobase pair SacI/PstI rIGF-I genomic DNA fragment was linearized with BglII or AccI, and end-labeled. After digestion with AccI or BglII, the 272-bp fragment, −54 to +219 bp relative to the exon 1 major transcription initiation site(7Pao C.-I. Farmer P.K. Begovic S. Goldstein S. Wu G. Phillips L.S.

Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1935) Google Scholar). Pairs of oligonucleotides, corresponding to +42/+68 bp (oligo III), +79/+101 bp (oligo IV), and +129/+152 bp (oligo V) downstream from the exon 1 major transcription initiation site, were annealed, labeled, and gel purified. End-labeled 272-bp AccI/BglII fragments were incubated with 0.5-15 μg of nuclear extract in 25 μl of binding buffer containing 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 20 μg of bovine serum albumin, 4 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 10% glycerol at 25°C for 25 min. Protein-DNA complexes were separated from free probe at 4°C on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × TBE (45 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 45 mM boric acid, 1 mM EDTA) at 11 V/cm for 2-3 h, and visualized by autoradiography. For double-stranded oligonucleotides, the probe was incubated with 5-15 μg of extract in same buffer, except that 200 μg/ml of salmon sperm DNA and 24 μg/ml of pBR322 were included to reduce nonspecific binding. End-labeled 272 bp AccI/BglII fragments were incubated with 4-24 μg of nuclear extract in 25 μl of binding buffer containing 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 10% glycerol at 25°C for 25 min. An equal volume of binding buffer containing 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2, and 10 units/ml of DNase I was added, and the sample was incubated at 25°C for 2 min. The reaction was stopped with buffer containing 40 mM EDTA and 10 μg/ml tRNA and deproteinized with plenol. DNA was precipitated with ethanol, electrophoresed on an 8 M urea, 6% polyacrylamide gel, and visualized by autoradiography. 20 μg of extract were mixed with an equal volume of loading buffer containing 5 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 200 mM DTT, 5% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 0.05% pyromin Y. Proteins were denatured at 100°C for 3 min, separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and then blotted onto nitrocellulose paper(29Miskimins W.K. Roberts M.P. McClelland A. Ruddle F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6741-6744Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The blots were incubated with buffer containing 10 mM Hepes, and 5% nonfat dry milk at 25°C for 1 h, and then incubated with binding buffer containing 10 mM Hepes, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.25% nonfat dry milk, 5 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 1 × 106 cpm/ml probe at 25°C for 1 h. After washing with 2 changes of binding buffer containing 300 mM NaCl at 25°C for 2 h, the filter paper was air dried and subjected to autoradiography. Constructs with IGF-I 5′-flanking sequences were transfected into rat hepatocytes in primary culture, as summarized in Fig. 1. Relative to expression of a promoterless luciferase reporter vector (p0LUC), expression was decreased 30% by the presence of IGF-I sequence extending from ~-4 kilobase pairs to −32 bp relative to the exon 1 major transcription initiation site(7Pao C.-I. Farmer P.K. Begovic S. Goldstein S. Wu G. Phillips L.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 969-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 13Adamo M.L. Ben-Hur H. LeRoith D. Roberts C.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 887-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 14Hall L.J. Kajimoto Y. Bichell D. Kim S. James P.L. Counts D. Nixon L.J. Tobin G. Rotwein P. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Expression was increased 40 and 113% with constructs containing 1.86 and 1.26 kilobase pairs of 5′ sequence, respectively, and the same 3′ terminus. Compared with expression of p(−1859/−32)LUC (40% above that of p0LUC), increased expression was obtained with constructs containing additional downstream sequences. Expression was increased 126% above p0LUC with a construct containing 1.86 kilobase pairs of 5′ sequence and 3′ sequence terminating at +55 bp, and maximum expression, 230% above p0LUC, was obtained with a construct containing the same 5′ sequence and 3′ sequence extending to +180 bp; expression was significantly greater than that of the construct with similar 5′ sequence but lacking downstream sequence (p < 0.005). Thus, these findings suggested that downstream sequences enhanced IGF-I gene expression. Because of relatively low expression in transient transfection studies (possibly due to the difficulty in maintaining IGF-I gene expression in hepatocytes (30Harp J.B. Goldstein S. Phillips L.S. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 95-101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as the difficulty of transfecting cells in primary culture(31Jacquemin P. Alsat E. Qury C. Belayew A. Martial J.A. Evain-Brion D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar)), a different model was used to test the hypothesis that downstream sequences contribute to metabolic regulation of IGF-I gene transcription. A genomic IGF-I template containing 471 bp of upstream sequence and 219 bp of downstream sequence was incubated with nuclear extracts from the livers of normal and diabetic rats, and in vitro transcriptional activity was evaluated by primer extension. As shown in Fig. 2A, the dominant transcription initiation site in vitro was identical to that used in vivo. The signal originated from RNA polymerase II transcripts, since it was sensitive to α-amanitin (not shown). Moreover, no signal was detected when extracts were incubated in the absence of a DNA template, indicating that signals originated from transcripts generated in vitro (not shown). Since in vitro transcriptional activity for the adenovirus major late promoter template driven by nuclear extracts from the livers of diabetic rats was comparable or greater to that with extracts from normal rats (Fig. 2B), we concluded that nuclear extracts from the livers of diabetic rats contained adequate transcriptional machinery and that changes in IGF-I gene transcription were likely to be specific. Using templates containing downstream sequence, in vitro transcriptional activity of nuclear extracts from the livers of diabetic rats was reduced 90%, compared with nuclear extracts from the livers of normal rats, (p < 0.05), but transcriptional activity with an IGF-I template lacking downstream sequence was not significantly decreased with extracts from diabetic versus normal rats (p > 0.1, Fig. 2C). Since this observation is consistent with our previous finding(7Pao C.-I. Farmer P.K. Begovic S. Goldstein S. Wu G. Phillips L.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 969-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), that IGF-I gene transcription rates were reduced ~97% in the livers of diabetic rats as compared with normal rats, downstream sequences may be important for both IGF-I expression and metabolic regulation. To search for regions that might be involved in gene regulation, the binding of hepatic nuclear factors to the 272-bp AccI/BglII fragment (−54/+219 bp) was first studied by gel mobility shift analysis, as shown in Fig. 3. Densitometric scanning revealed that the intensity of shifted protein-DNA complexes was reduced 30-60% with extracts from streptozotocin-diabetic as compared with normal rats. Binding was specific, since formation of DNA-protein complexes could be competed with an unlabeled 272-bp fragment but not with pBR322 DNA (not shown). All protein-DNA binding studies were repeated with at least three different batches of extracts, and extract activity was monitored by in vitro transcription assays. Protein binding sites were determined on both coding and noncoding strands, and results are shown in Fig. 4. Region I corresponded to the major transcription initiation site in exon 1. Five additional protected regions were observed consistently, with footprints at +17/+25 (region II), +42/+68 (region III), +79/+101 (region IV), +129/+152 (region V), and +155/+169 (region VI). Binding of factors in nuclear extracts from the livers of diabetic as compared with normal rats was reduced in both region III (especially with the noncoding strand) and region V (especially with the coding strand) (lanes 4, 5, and 6 versus lanes 1, 2, and 3 in panels A and B; differences in binding were not consistent in other regions. Nucleotide sequences and protected regions are summarized in Fig. 5.Figure 5Nucleotide sequence of 272 hp AccI/BglII fragment. Sequence originally determined by Shimatsu and Rotwein (32Shimatsu A. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7894-7900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was confirmed in our laboratory. Protected regions are underlined. The exon 1 major transcription initiation site is indicated by an arrow and designated +1. The transcription initiation sites identified by Adamo et al.(12Adamo M. Ben-Hur H. Roberts Jr., C.T.

A template lacking regions IV and V (+84/+152) no longer provided reduced transcriptional activity with nuclear extracts from diabetic versus normal rats (panel B). Similar results were also obtained with templates lacking regions III (+42/+68) or V (+129/+152) (panel C). In contrast, a template with deletion of region IV continued to exhibit decreased transcriptional activity with nuclear extracts from diabetic versus normal rats (panel D). While the potential involvement of other regions is still being investigated in our laboratory, these data were reproducible with different batches of extracts, and the transcriptional activities of normal and diabetic extracts remained comparable as determined with the adenovirus major late promoter as template. Double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to regions III (+42/+68 bp) and V (+129/+152 bp) were used in gel mobility shift analyses to examine DNA-protein interactions, as shown in Fig. 7. Addition of pBR322 DNA was necessary to decrease nonspecific binding (lanes 2 and 10 versus lanes 4 and 12). The association of nuclear factors with region V was stronger than that with region III, especially in formation of complex II (lanes 3 and 4 versus lanes 11 and 12). While formation of both complexes I and II could be competed with unlabeled oligonucleotides (lane 3 versus lanes 5 and 6 and lane 11 versus lanes 13 and 14), cross-competition was incomplete (lane 3 versus lanes 7 and 8 and lane 11 versus lanes 15 and 16). Thus, binding of nuclear factors to regions III and V was relatively specific, particularly for complex II. Activities of nuclear extracts from the livers of normal and diabetic rats are shown in Fig. 8. Nuclear proteins associated with region IV showed similar affinity with normal and diabetic rat liver extracts. In contrast, nuclear protein binding to regions III and V was reduced with extracts from diabetic animals, typically 30-50% of that of extracts from normal rats.Figure 8Specific interactions of nuclear proteins with oligonucleotides III, IV, and V. Each binding reaction contained 5,000 cpm probe, and different amounts of nuclear proteins as indicated. Protein-DNA complexes were visualized on a 6% polyacrylamide gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To characterize the size and relative abundance of proteins associated with regions III and V, hepatic nuclear extracts from normal and diabetic rats were subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then blotted to nitrocellulose and probed with corresponding oligonucleotides, as shown in Fig. 9. Proteins with apparent molecular weight of ~65 kDa were associated with both regions III and V and were present in extracts from both normal and diabetic animals. However, apparent abundance of the ~65-kDa protein in extracts from diabetic animals was ~75% of normal with region III and ~50% of normal with region V, as determined by densitometric scanning. The IGF-I promoters analyzed to date have several common features, such as lack of a “TATA” box, presence of transcription “initiator” sequences(13Adamo M.L. Ben-Hur H. LeRoith D. Roberts C.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 887-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 32Shimatsu A. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7894-7900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and binding sites for well recognized transcription factors such as Sp1, C/EBP, and HNF-1 located upstream from the major transcription initiation sites(32Shimatsu A. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7894-7900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present studies demonstrate that sequences downstream from the major transcription initiation site in exon 1 are important for both IGF-I gene expression and metabolic regulation. Within the −54/+219 bp region of exon 1, we found six loci of binding with hepatic nuclear factors; protected regions were similar to those described by Thomas et al.(33Thomas M.J. Kikuchi K. Bichell D.P. Rotwein P. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1584-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). With our model, DNase I footprinting and gel mobility shift assays revealed that nuclear factors in the livers of diabetic rats have reduced interactions with region III (+42/+68) and region V (+129/+152). Transfection studies revealed a 230% increase in expression with a construct containing 180 bp of downstream sequence (including both regions III and V). Our findings are consistent with those of Hall et al.(14Hall L.J. Kajimoto Y. Bichell D. Kim S. James P.L. Counts D. Nixon L.J. Tobin G. Rotwein P. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), who observed that the presence of downstream sequence increased IGF-I gene expression when the same constructs were transfected into SK-N-MC cells and Lowe et al.(18Lowe, W. L., Jr., (1994) Endocrine Society 76th Annual Meeting, p. 330 (abstr.), Anaheim, CA.Google Scholar) and Adamo and co-workers (19Wang, X., Yang, Y., Adamo, M. L., (1994) Endocrine Society 76th Annual Meeting, p. 234 (abstr.), Anaheim, CA.Google Scholar) who found that downstream sequence increased IGF expression when constructs were transfected into C6 glioma cells. Further evidence of biological significance was provided by in vitro studies; specific differences in IGF-I transcriptional activity between normal and diabetic rat liver extracts could be detected only in the presence of downstream sequences. The two protein-DNA complexes observed in gel mobility shift assays with oligonucleotides III and V likely result from binding of multiple nuclear factors rather than formation of a dimer, since only complex I could be cross-competed with both oligonucleotides III and V. A putative common factor could interact with motifs such as CCTGC(G/C)CA found within both regions III and V. In both gel mobility shift assays and Southwestern blotting studies, the formation of protein-DNA complexes could be competed with unlabeled oligonucleotides but was not blocked with a great excess of pBR322 DNA, indicating that binding was specific. The DNA-binding protein(s) identified by Southwestern blotting appears to be metabolically regulated, as reduced binding was provided by hepatic nuclear extracts from diabetic as compared with normal rats. While gel mobility shift assays point to the presence of at least two DNA-binding proteins, we do not yet know if other putative factors are metabolically regulated as well. Lack of identification of a second DNA-binding factor by Southwestern blotting may also be attributed to the denaturing conditions used in this procedure, which could interfere with protein-protein interactions that may be stabilized by the caging effect in gel mobility shift analysis. A number of viral and cellular transcriptional units contain essential sequences which are downstream from transcription initiation sites (34Ayer D.E. Dynan W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3635-3645Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 35Park K. Atchison M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1993; 13: 4904-4917Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Such downstream elements may influence RNA elongation, processing, and translation, in addition to transcription initiation. Promoters commonly associated with housekeeping and growth control genes often require downstream elements to achieve full gene expression (38Dynan W.S. Trends Genet. 1986; 2: 196-197Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Moreover, intragenic enhancers or activators have been described for numerous extrahepatic genes such as immunoglobulins(39Banerji J. Olson L. Schaffner W. Cell. 1983; 33: 729-740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar), adenosine deaminase(40Aronow B. Lattier D. Silbiger R. Dusing M. Hutton J. Jones G. Stock J. McNeish J. Potter S. Witte D. Wiginton D. Genes & Dev. 1980; 3 (84-1400): 13Google Scholar), and muscle creatine kinase(41Sternberg E.A. Spizz G. Perry W.M. Vizard D. Weil T. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2896-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Thus, the requirement for both upstream and downstream elements to achieve full gene expression is not unique to the IGF-I gene. There has been relatively little characterization of tissue-specific and hormone response elements of the IGF-I gene. Since this manuscript was submitted, Nolten et al.(42Nolten L.A. van Schaik F.M.A. Steenbergh P.H. Sussenbach J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1636-1645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) recently found that C/EBP and HNF-1 can stimulate hIGF-I gene expression in Hep3B cells through binding ~120 bp upstream from the major exon 1 transcription initiation site. Within regions of interest identified in the present studies, region III includes the AAATAAA silencer motif identified in the rat prolactin gene(43Zhang Z.-H. Kumar V. Rivera R.T. Chisholm J. Biswas D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4785-4788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the (T/A)GATA(A/G) binding motif found in the promoters or enhancers of erythroid-expressed genes(44Plumb M. Frampton J. Wainwright H. Walker M. Macleod K. Goodwin G. Harrison P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 73-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), the histone H-5 gene(37Rousseau S. Asselin M. Renaud J. Ruiz-Carrillo A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4904-4917Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and immunoglobulin genes(45Ho I.-C. Vorhees P. Marin N. Oakley B.K. Tsai S.-F. Orkin S.H. Leiden J.M.

The nontranscribed strand sequence GGNGCAGGA in region V is similar to the silencer binding protein motif GGAGCAGGA found in the rat glutathione transferase P gene(47Imagawa M. Osada S. Okuda A. Muramatsu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A GenBank/EMBL search indicates that there is substantial homology between region III and region V sequences and elements of over 50 eukaryotic and prokaryotic genes. The present studies add to understanding of the regulation of IGF-I biosynthesis. Hepatic IGF-I gene transcription is decreased under conditions of reduced provision of essential amino acids or regulatory hormones, due presumably to differences in nuclear factors that either bind directly to the IGF-I gene or interact with other transcription factors involved in the formation of transcription initiation complexes. Our results suggest that a change in the concentration or activity of factors bound to downstream sequences may lower IGF-I gene transcription in conditions of diabetes mellitus. Additional studies are now aimed at characterization of transcription factors involved in modulation of IGF-I promoter activity.

The presence of Ptp1 resulted in dephosphorylation of multiple tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in yeast expressing a heterologous tyrosine-specific protein kinase, indicating that Ptp1 can dephosphorylate a broad range of substrates in vivo. Correspondingly, several proteins phosphorylated at tyrosine by endogenous protein kinases exhibited a marked increase in tyrosine phosphorylation in ptp1 mutant cells. One of these phosphotyrosyl proteins (p70) was also dephosphorylated in vitro when incubated with recombinant Ptp1. p70 was purified to homogeneity; analysis of four tryptic peptides revealed that p70 is identical to the recently described FPR3 gene product, a nucleolarly localized proline rotamase of the FK506- and rapamycin-binding family. The identity of p70 with Fpr3 was confirmed in the demonstration that the abundance of tyrosine-phosphorylated p70 in ptp1 mutants was strictly correlated with the level of FPR3 expression; immobilized phosphotyrosyl Fpr3 was directly dephosphorylated by recombinant Ptp1. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that the site of tyrosine phosphorylation is Tyr-184, which resides within the nucleolin-like amino-terminal domain of Fpr3.

These enzymes form a distinct superfamily and are unrelated in sequence to serine/threonine-specific phosphoprotein phosphatases (for reviews, see (1Charbonneau H. Tonks N.K. Annu. Rev.

All PTPs possess stretches of sequence similarity within their catalytic domains, including the active site consensus sequence (I/V)HCXAGXGR(S/T)G. This hallmark sequence contains an invariant Cys residue, which acts as the nucleophile during the dephosphorylation reaction, and a GXGXXG motif, which forms a phosphate-binding loop and is also found in nucleotide-binding proteins such as protein kinases and GTPases(4Guan K.

The substrate-binding cleft of PTPs is surrounded by basic amino acids, which may explain the preference for acidic residues near the phosphorylated tyrosines in PTP substrates(5Barford D. Flint A.J.

In the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, dedicated tyrosine-specific protein kinases have not been identified. However, a number of genes encoding PTPs have been reported. These PTPs include both phosphotyrosine-specific and dual-specific enzymes as seen in higher eukaryotes. Two of the S. cerevisiae PTPs appear to be MAP kinase phosphatases. The dual-specific PTP encoded by the MSG5 gene dephosphorylates Fus3 and thereby contributes to the reversal of pheromone arrest(7Doi D. Gartner A. Ammerer G. Errede B. Shinkawa H. Sugimoto D. Matsumoto D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The PTP2 gene product is thought to dephosphorylate Hog1, a MAP kinase involved in osmoregulation(8Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 369: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). At least two S. cerevisiae PTPs are involved in cell cycle control: the CDC14 gene product is required for progression through S phase(9Wan J. Xu H. Grunstein M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11274-11280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the product of the MIH1 gene, the S. cerevisiae homolog of the fission yeast cdc25+, is thought to dephosphorylate the Cdc28 kinase(10Russell P. Moreno S. Reed S.I. Cell. 1989; 57: 295-303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The YVH1 PTP gene is induced by nitrogen starvation and encodes a PTP that is required for maximal growth(11Guan K. Hakes D.J. Wang Y. Park H.-D. Cooper T.G. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12175-12179Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). PTP1, the first PTP gene reported in budding yeast, was identified by the polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotides corresponding to conserved PTP catalytic domain sequences as primers (12Guan K. Deschenes R.J. Qiu H. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12964-12970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ptp1 appears to be phosphotyrosine specific and is comprised of a carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain and a unique 55-residue amino-terminal region of unknown function. Although Ptp1 is active in vitro against artificial substrates, the physiological role of Ptp1 is unknown; PTP1 disruption or overexpression does not overtly effect growth at extreme temperatures, sensitivity to different metal ions, osmotic stability, carbon source utilization, mating, or sporulation(12Guan K. Deschenes R.J. Qiu H. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12964-12970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13James P. Hall B.D. Whelen S. Craig E.A.

However, expression of PTP1 in fission yeast mimics cdc25+ overexpression and leads to precocious mitosis(14Hannig G. Ottilie S. Schievella A.R. Erikson R.L. Yeast. 1993; 9: 1039-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of PTP1 in S. cerevisiae rescues the synthetic lethality resulting from disruption of both PTP2 and PTC1, a gene encoding a putative Ser/Thr-specific phosphoprotein phosphatase of the PP2C class(15Maeda T. Tsai A.Y.M. Saito H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5408-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). These results suggest that when overproduced, Ptp1 may be capable of dephosphorylating Cdc2 and Hog1, but the relevance of these activities to normal Ptp1 function is unclear. Here, we describe the identification of yeast phosphotyrosyl proteins that are dephosphorylated by Ptp1 in vivo and present evidence that one Ptp1 substrate is the nucleolar immunophilin, Fpr3. Yeast strains used in this work are described in Table 1. Yeast transformation was carried out using electroporation(16Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). To generate the strain YBB200, a 3.1-kilobase ClaI fragment containing a HIS3-disrupted ptp1 allele (13James P. Hall B.D. Whelen S. Craig E.A. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 122: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by P. James) was introduced into strain YPH499 (17Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by DNA-mediated transformation. To generate strain YBB300, the same ClaI fragment was used to transform strain YBB100(18Benton B. Zang J.-H. Thorner J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 623-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To generate the strain PJ55300, the fpr3-2::HIS3 insertion mutation was introduced into strain PJ55-16C, following a procedure previously described(18Benton B. Zang J.-H. Thorner J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 623-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To generate YLW200, a 1.25-kilobase PvuII-AseI fragment containing a URA3-disrupted ptp1 allele was excised from plasmid pGEM-ptp1::URA3 (12Guan K. Deschenes R.J. Qiu H. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12964-12970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (kindly provided by R. Deschenes) and used to transform strain BJ2168.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab To induce transcription of genes driven by a GAL promoter, cultures were grown overnight to A600 nm = 1 in defined medium containing 2% raffinose. Galactose was then added to a final concentration of 2%, and the cells were grown for an additional 3 h prior to harvesting. For large scale purification of p70FPR3, strain PJ58-2B (ptp1Δ ptp2Δ mih1Δ) was grown in YPD in a 200-liter fermenter with vigorous aeration to stationary phase (A600 nm = 3.5). For immunoblot analysis, cells were grown to late exponential phase (A600 nm = 1). Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4°C at 1,000 × g for 5 min, resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, and recentrifuged. Cell pellets were resuspended in an equal volume of ice-cold buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 12 μM benzamidine, 5 μM phenanthroline, 30 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μM Na3VO4, and 0.5 μg/ml of each of the following: antipain, leupeptin, chymostatin, aprotinin, and pepstatin). The cells were lysed by vigorous agitation with glass beads as described(18Benton B. Zang J.-H. Thorner J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 623-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, brought to 1 × Laemmli sample buffer (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206514) Google Scholar) by addition of an appropriate amount of a concentrated stock, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Alternatively, where indicated, lysates were prepared by an alkaline lysis method as described(20Silver P.A. Chiang A. Sadler I. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell pellets were incubated at 4°C in 250 mM NaOH, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol for 10 min, and cellular proteins were precipitated in 8% trichloroacetic acid. Protein precipitates were rinsed twice in acetone, dried, and then resuspended prior to SDS-PAGE by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer. Immunoblot analyses were carried out as described (21Liebl E.C. England L.J. DeClue J.E. Martin G.S. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4315-4324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cell proteins (100 μg of protein/lane) were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene-difluoride membrane (PVDF) (Immobilon P, Millipore). Blocking buffer containing 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) was used for all blocking, antibody incubation, and rinsing steps. The following antibodies were used at a concentration of 1 μg/ml to probe immunoblots: anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4G10 (22Drucker B.J. Mamon H.J. Roberts T.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 321: 1383-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) (Upstate Biotechnology), mAb FB2(23Frackelton Jr., A.R. Tremble P.M. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7909-7915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mAb 6G9(24Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3328-3332Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), a polyclonal rabbit anti-phosphotyrosine antibody prepared by the method of Kamps and Sefton(25Kamps M.P. Sefton B.M. Oncogene. 1988; 2: 305-315PubMed Google Scholar), rabbit anti-Fpr3 serum(18Benton B. Zang J.-H. Thorner J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 623-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), anti-Src mAb 2-17 (Microbiological Associates, Rockville, MD), and anti-Myc mAb 9E10 (26Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were detected by incubation with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-immunoglobulin antibodies (Pierce), followed by chemiluminescence detection with Renaissance™ enhanced luminol reagent (Dupont NEN) and exposure of Kodak X-AR film. Immunoblot signals were quantified by densitometry using a ScanMaker MRS-600ZS™ (Microtek, Taiwan). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to introduce a mutation into PTP1 that resulted in a Cys-to-Ala substitution at amino acid residue 252 to generate a catalytically inactive variant. The upstream primer, 5′-TGAAATTCCCGCGGGAACCCCATTATCGTACACGCTTCCGCAGGC-3′, spanning nucleotides 724-766 of PTP1 (counting from the translational start site), incorporated the TG-to-GC mutation (underlined) and a SacII restriction site (italicized). The downstream primer spanned nucleotides 865-886 just downstream of a BsmI restriction site at nucleotides 850-856. YEp51-PTP1, a multi-copy vector containing PTP1 under control of the GAL10 promoter (a gift from P. James), was used as the PCR template, and the reaction was carried out using standard procedures as described(27Delidow B.C. Lynch J.P. Peluso J.J. White B.A. White B.A. Methods in Molecular Biology, PCR Protocols, Current Methods and Applications. 15. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1993: 1-30Google Scholar). The PCR product (162 bp) was treated with the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, digested with SacII and BsmI, and religated into YEp51-PTP1, which had been digested with SacII and BsmI. The wild-type and mutant PTP1 genes were cloned into the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion vector PGEX-3X (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). In preparation for these ligations, an adapter, 5′-CGGGATCCAAATGCAGGCCTCTCGAGATCGATGAATTC-G3′, which contains a BamHI site (boldface type) followed by the first 7 translated nucleotides of PTP1 (underlined), and StuI, ClaI, and EcoRI sites (italicized) was first inserted between the BamHI and EcoRI sites in the vector. This strategy allowed the in-frame insertion of a PvuII-ClaI fragment containing the remainder of PTP1 (nucleotides 8-3042 excised from YEp51-PTP1) into the modified vector between the StuI and ClaI sites. The resulting constructs encode GST-Ptp1 and GST-Ptp1(C252A) fusion proteins with a factor Xa cleavage site between the GST and Ptp1 coding segments. Plasmid YEp352GAL-v-src was described previously (28Florio M. Wilson L.K. Trager J.B. Thorner J. Martin G.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 283-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). FPR3 expression plasmids YEp351-FPR3myc (pYB1010), YEp351GAL-FPR3myc (pYB124), YEp351GAL-FPR3 (pYB123), YEp351GAL-FPR3N (pYB126), YEp351GAL-FPR3C (pYB120), and pGXFPR3A (encoding GST-Fpr3N) are described in (18Benton B. Zang J.-H. Thorner J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 623-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Plasmids expressing mutant derivatives of FPR3 were generated by PCR using a pUC19-derived plasmid containing wild-type FPR3 (pNH2.2; described in (18Benton B. Zang J.-H. Thorner J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 623-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar)) as template. A double mutant (Y184F,Y189F) was generated using two PCR primers, each of which contained both a change in codon 184 from TAT to TTT (nucleotides 550-552) and in codon 189 from TAC to TTC (nucleotides 265-267). Primer 1 spanned nucleotides 546-573 on the coding strand, and primer 2 spanned nucleotides 573-540 on the noncoding strand. In one PCR reaction, primer 1 was used with an additional downstream primer, spanning nucleotides 839-857 (noncoding strand), to generate a 311-bp product. In a separate reaction, primer 2 was used with an upstream primer, spanning nucleotides 363-382 (coding strand), to generate a 210-bp product. In the final PCR reaction, an overlap extension, the 2 initial overlapping products were purified and used as template primers together with the upstream and downstream primers. This reaction generated a 494-bp product spanning nucleotides 363-857 with mutations at codons 184 and 189. The product was digested with BspE1 and EcoRI to generate a 455-bp fragment. This fragment was ligated to the 4.5-kilobase fragment of BspE1 and EcoRI-digested pNH2.2, thus replacing the corresponding region of wild-type FPR3. To generate versions of FPR3 containing each of the single mutations, Y184F and Y189F, a similar procedure was used, except that the primers “1” and “2” were changed to include a mutation only at codon 184 for Y184F and only at codon 189 for Y189F. To express the mutated FPR3 genes in yeast, they were excised from pNH2.2 with AflIII and HindIII, and the AflIII site was filled in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. The resulting fragments were then ligated into the vector YEp351GAL(18Benton B. Zang J.-H. Thorner J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 623-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), which had been opened with SalI, treated with Klenow, and then cut with HindIII. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. To purify GST-Ptp1 fusion proteins, E. coli transformed with plasmids expressing the desired fusion were grown to A600 nm = 1.0, induced with 100 μM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactoside, and harvested by centrifugation. Approximately 1 g of wet cells were resuspended in 5 ml of buffer B (buffer A devoid of vanadate) and broken by sonic disruption. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, diluted in buffer B to 5 mg of protein/ml, and gently rocked for 30 min at 0°C with 0.5 ml (drained volume) glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia). The beads were then collected by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 20 s, resuspended in buffer B, loaded into a column, and washed with 20 volumes of buffer B containing 300 mM NaCl. The GST-Ptp1 beads were stored at 4°C until their use for p70FPR3 dephosphorylation reactions. In these reactions, crude lysates or purified samples containing approximately 0.1 pmol of p70FPR3 in buffer B were incubated with 0.1 μl of GST-Ptp1 beads (0.5 pmol of GST-Ptp1) for 10 min at 30°C. GST-Ptp1 beads (300 μl containing 100 μg of GST-Ptp1) were incubated with 2 μg of factor Xa (New England Biolabs) in 1 mM CaCl2, 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl for 15 h at 4°C to release soluble Ptp1. The beads were removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 20 s. The solution containing Ptp1 was diluted to a concentration of 30 μg/ml (0.5 μM) in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.9), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol. Lysates of strain YBB300 overexpressing Fpr3 (50 μg of protein/lane) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membrane. Strips of membrane (approximately 1 cm2 each) containing Fpr3 were rocked at 30°C with 1 ml of 0.5 μM Ptp1. At intervals, strips were washed three times for 10 min each at 55°C in immunoblot blocking buffer and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb as described above. Strain PJ58-2B was grown in a 200-liter fermenter, harvested by centrifugation in an air-driven Sharples supercentrifuge rotor, and frozen at −80°C until used. Yeast (500 g, wet weight) were processed in five separate batches as follows. For each batch, a block of frozen cells (100 g) was broken into small pieces, mixed with 100 ml of buffer A, and agitated vigorously with 100 ml of glass beads for 4 min at 0°C in buffer A using a Biospec Bead Beater (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation for 15 min at 10,000 × g, and the resulting supernatant fraction was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 40 min. The p70 was eluted from the resulting pellet by stirring the resuspended particulate material for 1 h at 4°C in 50 ml of buffer A containing a final concentration of 1 M NaCl. Insoluble particulate matter was removed from the suspension by centrifugation at 100,000 × g. The supernatant fraction was loaded onto a bed (150 ml) of cellulose gel (GH25, Amicon, Denvers, MA) in a column (60 × 1.8 cm) and eluted with buffer C (40 mM HEPES (pH 6.9), 20 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 100 μM Na3V04, and the same protease inhibitors used in buffer A). The protein-containing fractions were pooled (50-70 ml) and loaded onto a bed (60 ml) of S-Sepharose in a column (2 × 20 cm) (Pharmacia). The column was washed with five column volumes of buffer C containing 220 mM NaCl and eluted with a gradient (550 ml total) from 220 to 500 mM NaCl. Fractions were analyzed for p70 by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and stored at −70°C. S-Sepharose fractions enriched for p70 (300 ml total) collected from the five 100-g batches of yeast were brought to a final concentration of 1% Triton X-100, dialyzed twice for 2.5 h against 4 liters of buffer C containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and precleared by incubation with 0.5 ml of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia) for 4 h at 4°C; the protein A-Sepharose was removed by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 5 min. The resulting supernatant solution was mixed with 1.0 ml of protein A-Sepharose, to which had been coupled anti-phosphotyrosine mAb FB2(23Frackelton Jr., A.R. Tremble P.M. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7909-7915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and incubated with gentle rocking at 4°C for 6 h. The beads were washed with 10 ml of buffer C containing a final concentration of 120 mM NaCl, and p70 was eluted with 2 ml of 60 mM phenylphosphate. The eluted protein was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, treated with 10 mM 4-vinylpyridine to alkylate Cys residues, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon-P. Ponceau S staining revealed a single band in the 70-kDa size range. This procedure yielded approximately 15 μg of p70 from 500 g of yeast. The band was excised and digested with sequencing grade trypsin (Boehringer Mannheim). Tryptic peptides were separated by reverse phase chromatography (Brownlee C8 column, 1 × 250 mm, Applied Biosystems) using a 172A microbore high pressure liquid chromatograph (Applied Biosystems) and subjected to microsequencing by Edman degradation in a 477A protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was conducted as described elsewhere(29O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A sample of the p70 preparation (~0.1 μg) was separated in the first dimension using nonequilibrium isoelectric focusing in a tube containing pH 3-10 ampholytes (Pharmalyte, Pharmacia) and in the second dimension by electrophoresis in a 7.5% SDS slab gel. The staining of separated proteins was carried out with colloidal gold (Aurodye™, Amersham). Strains YPH499 and YBB200 transformed with the plasmid YEp351-FPR3myc were grown overnight to A600 nm = 0.4 in synthetic low phosphate medium(30Julius D. Schekman R. Thorner J. Cell. 1984; 36: 309-318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 31Reneke J. Blumer K. Courchesne W.E. Thorner J. Cell. 1988; 55: 221-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), and then resuspended to A600 nm = 0.8 in 5 ml of prewarmed synthetic low phosphate medium containing 2 mCi of 32P-labeled PO43- (DuPont NEN) (final specific activity, 8 Ci/mmol). After 3 h in a 30°C gyratory water bath, the yeast were harvested by centrifugation, and cell proteins were prepared by alkaline lysis and trichloroacetic acid precipitation as described above. The dried precipitates were resuspended by boiling in 2% SDS for 5 min, clarified by centrifugation, diluted to 0.15% SDS with buffer A, and precleared by incubation with protein A-Sepharose for 1 h. Fpr3 was then immunoprecipitated with 0.4 μg of affinity-purified rabbit antibody raised against a bacterially expressed GST-Fpr3 fusion protein(18Benton B. Zang J.-H. Thorner J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 623-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon P, and exposed to x-ray film. For phosphoamino acid analysis, Immobilon strips containing the Fpr3 bands were excised and subjected to partial acid hydrolysis, and the resulting products were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis (32Boyle W.J. Geer P.V.D. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar) at pH 1.9 (first dimension) and pH 3.7 (second dimension) on thin layer cellulose plates (Merck). Phosphoamino acid standards were included with the samples and were visualized by ninhydrin staining. Autoradiographs were obtained using either a Phosphorimager™ (Molecular Dynamics) or x-ray film. Radioactivity incorporated into individual phosphoamino acids was quantitated by scintillation counting of the corresponding stained spots scraped from the thin layer plates. Strain YLW200 was grown to mid-exponential phase in YPD and harvested by centrifugation. Cells were washed and resuspended in 0.5 ml of extraction buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.8), 75 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 20 mM β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mM Na3V04, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). An extract was prepared by vigorously agitating the resuspended pellet (approximately 50 A600 nm units) with glass beads in 0.5 ml of extraction buffer for 5 min at 4°C. The resulting lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min and adjusted to a protein concentration of 7 mg/ml by dilution with extraction buffer. A GST fusion encoding the amino-terminal 279 residues of Fpr3 (Fpr3N) was purified from bacterial extracts by adsorption to glutathione-Sepharose beads(18Benton B. Zang J.-H. Thorner J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 623-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and a sample (1 μl of beads containing 1 μg of GST-Fpr3N) was mixed with ~200 μl of the lysate. Following incubation (4°C for 120 min) on a rotating mixer, the beads were recovered by brief centrifugation and washed three times with 1 ml binding buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.8), 50 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100). The washed beads were resuspended in 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.8), 20 mM MgCl2, 20 mM β-glycerophosphate, 20 mMp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.1 mM Na3V04), containing 20 μM [γ-32P]ATP (15 Ci/mmol). Reactions were carried out for 30 min at 30°C. The product of the PTP1 gene (Ptp1) dephosphorylates several artificial substrates in vitro(12Guan K. Deschenes R.J. Qiu H. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12964-12970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that it may be capable of dephosphorylating a broad range of substrates in vivo. To explore this possibility, we compared the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of yeast proteins in strain PJ55-16C, which harbors a disruption of the PTP1 gene (ptp1Δ), and the congenic PTP1 strain PJ55-16A. To enhance total cellular tyrosine phosphorylation, these strains were transformed with a multi-copy plasmid expressing a known protein-tyrosine kinase, p60V-src, under the control of the GAL1 promoter(28Florio M. Wilson L.K. Trager J.B. Thorner J. Martin G.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 283-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 33Boschelli F. Uptain S.M. Lightbody J.J. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 519-528PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates prepared from these strains were examined by immunoblotting with anti-Src and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. The level of v-src expression in ptp1Δ cells was similar to that of the control PTP1 cells (Fig. 1, bottom panel). In PTP1 strains, p60V-src expression resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of at least 10 different cellul"
https://openalex.org/W2081878639,"Genetic defects in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a cAMP-activated chloride channel, cause cystic fibrosis. Most defective forms of CFTR show improper intracellular trafficking. Because isoprenylated, small GTP-binding proteins are involved in the vesicular trafficking of other integral membrane proteins, we have investigated the role of isoprenylation in the trafficking of CFTR to the apical membranes of primary cultures of human airway epithelium and of Calu-3 cells, a human lung carcinoma cell line. CFTR function was measured as short circuit current, <sup>125</sup>I efflux, and conductance of cell sheets with permeabilized basolateral membranes. Lovastatin, an inhibitor of isoprenyl lipid biosynthesis, markedly inhibited all measures of CFTR function. The lovastatin-induced declines in CFTR function were corrected by the simultaneous addition of mevalonate or the isoprenyl lipids geranylgeranyl and farnesyl but not cholesterol. Lovastatin reduced total cellular CFTR as assessed by immunoprecipitation. Mevalonate or isoprenyl lipids protected CFTR levels from the actions of lovastatin. Together, these results suggest a role for isoprenyl lipids, presumably through the actions of small GTP-binding proteins, in the trafficking of CFTR to the apical membrane of human airway epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W1999043850,"We have analyzed the human (h) metallothionein (MT)-IG proximal promoter region (−174 to +5) using a TATA box mutation (TATCA) and four trinucleotide mutants of the proximal MREa. Transient transfection of HepG2 cells was complemented by <i>in vitro</i> transcription with rat liver nuclear extracts. In both systems, mutations of the TATA box and conserved core of metal responsive element (MRE)a were detrimental to hMT-IG promoter activity suggesting that both elements make significant contributions to hMT-IG transcription. Although MRE binding factors were active <i>in vitro</i>, further metal activation of MT promoter activity was accomplished only by <i>in vivo</i> metal treatment rather than addition of zinc <i>in vitro</i>. Southwestern blotting identified nuclear proteins in rat liver and HepG2 cells which physically interact with MREa in a zinc-dependent manner and could be responsible for MREa function in each system. In addition, the functional effects of the TATCA mutation correlate with altered physical interaction with TATA box-binding protein as observed using DNase I protection."

The FH phenotype is unexpected based on previous site-directed mutagenesis showing that deletion of exons 2 and 3 resulted in little or no defect in LDL-R activity. In the present study, we took unique advantage of the ability to distinguish the LDL-R Δ5kb from the normal receptor on the basis of size, in order to resolve this apparent discrepancy. Fibroblasts from heterozygotes for the LDL-R Δ5kb displayed 50% of normal capacity to bind LDL and β-VLDL, apparently due to lower receptor number. Cellular mRNA for the Δ5kb allele was at least as abundant as that for the normal allele. Immunoblotting and cell binding assays with anti-LDL-R antibody IgG-4A4 demonstrated normal synthesis and transport of the Δ5kb receptor. Ligand blotting demonstrated that the Δ5kb receptor displayed minimal or no ability to bind LDL or β-VLDL. Thus, in contrast to transfected cell lines, in human fibroblasts, the first two cysteine-rich repeats of the LDL-R appear functionally necessary.

In peripheral cells, it functions to provide the cell with cholesterol needed for membrane synthesis. The LDL-R contains five major structural domains: a seven-repeat, cysteine-rich ligand binding domain encoded by exons 2-6, an epidermal growth factor-precursor homology domain (exons 7-14), a glycosylation domain (exon 15), a membrane-spanning domain (exon 16), and a cytoplasmic tail (exon 17)(1Hobbs H.H. Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 133-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). The LDL-R is one of the few proteins for which knowledge of the structure-function relationship has been generated both from site-directed mutagenesis and from numerous naturally occurring human mutations. low density lipoprotein receptor very low density lipoprotein familial hypercholesterolemia kilobase(s) heterozygote(s) lipoprotein-deficient serum. Mutations in the LDL-R gene resulting in a dysfunctional receptor cause a codominantly inherited disorder of plasma cholesterol catabolism known as familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Human LDL-R mutations have been assigned to five classes of defects based on their phenotypic effects on the receptor protein(1Hobbs H.H. Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 133-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). We have previously described a deletion of approximately 5 kb, which removes exons 2 and 3 of the LDL-R gene (LDL-R Δ5kb)(2Ma Y. Betard C. Roy M. Davignon J. Kessling A.M. Clin. Genet. 1989; 36: 219-228PubMed Google Scholar). In site-directed mutagenesis experiments, deletion of the first repeat (exon 2) has no effect on the binding or internalization of LDL or β-VLDL or recycling of receptors in transfected mammalian cells(3van Driel I.R. Goldstein J.L. Sudhof T.C. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17443-17449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Simultaneous deletion of exons 2 and 3 has resulted in a receptor which binds LDL 70% as well as the normal receptor and which binds β-VLDL equally as well(4Esser V. Limbird L.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13282-13290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results have led to the suggestion that the first two repeats of the LDL-R ligand-binding domain are not necessary for LDL-R function. Some studies have shown that the clinical phenotype resulting from LDL-R mutations correlates with biochemical phenotype or class(5Moorjani S. Roy M. Torres A. Betard C. Gagne C. Lambert M. Brun D. Davignon J. Lupien P.J. Lancet. 1993; 341: 1303-1306Abstract PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 6Gudnason V. Day I.N.M. Humphries S.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1717-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). As such, one would expect that heterozygosity for the LDL-R Δ5kb would result in relatively mild or no expression of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). However, taking advantage of genetic founder effects among French Canadians, we have observed that plasma total and LDL cholesterol levels among 8 probands for this deletion are indistinguishable from those in heterozygotes for a null LDL-R allele. In the context of a clinical genetic study of a kindred with the 5-kb LDL-R gene deletion(7Sass C. Giroux L.M. Ma Y. Roy M. Lavigne J. Lussier-Cacan S. Davignon J. Minnich A. Hum. Genet. 1995; 96: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we noted that heterozygote (HTZ) fibroblasts displayed consistently 50-60% the maximal receptor activity of normal cells. This was again unexpected based on the apparent activity of the LDL-R lacking exons 2 and 3 in transfected cells. Normally, the biochemical consequences of LDL-R mutations in cells from carriers are difficult to study in the absence of a homozygote. Unlike the case for the vast majority of described mutations of the LDL-R, the LDL-R Δ5kb deleted protein is distinguishable from the normal receptor on the basis of size. This situation offers a unique opportunity to examine and compare the mRNA, protein, and ligand binding to the mutant receptor with those of the normal receptor in vivo within the same cell. The present study provides evidence for important differences in the consequences of deletion of exons 2 and 3 from the LDL-R gene as assessed by site-directed mutagenesis and by analysis of heterozygous fibroblasts. Plasma total and LDL cholesterol were measured as described(7Sass C. Giroux L.M. Ma Y. Roy M. Lavigne J. Lussier-Cacan S. Davignon J. Minnich A. Hum. Genet. 1995; 96: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The presence of the French-Canadian LDL-R >10- and 5-kb gene deletions was determined by Southern blotting as described(2Ma Y. Betard C. Roy M. Davignon J. Kessling A.M. Clin. Genet. 1989; 36: 219-228PubMed Google Scholar). Human skin fibroblasts were obtained from normal subjects and from FH patients heterozygous for the Δ5kb deletion. Receptor-negative fibroblasts were obtained from an FH patient homozygous for the >10-kb deletion(8Hobbs H.H. Brown M.S. Russell D.W. Davignon J. Goldstein J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1987; 317: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) and LDL were isolated from human plasma(9Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). β-VLDL were isolated from blood of cholesterol-fed rabbits(10Kovanen P.T. Brown M.S. Basu S.K. Bilheimer D.W. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 1396-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Lipoproteins were iodinated with carrier-free 125I-sodium (Amersham, Oakville, ON) with the IODOGEN (Pierce) method(11Salacinski P.R.P. McLean C. Sykes J.E.C. Clement-Jones V.V. Lowry P.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-LDL-R antibody IgG-4A4 was isolated from hybridoma cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) as described(12Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 245-285Google Scholar), purified with MAC® Protein A Capsules (Amicon) as recommended by the manufacturer, and iodinated with IODOBEADS®(13Ishida B.Y. Frohlich J. Fielding C.J. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 778-786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Pierce). Following a 48-h incubation of the cells in 10% LPDS, cell surface binding at 4°C of 125I-LDL, 125I-β-VLDL, and 125I-IgG-4A4 were performed as described(9Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Estimates of receptor number and affinity were calculated by the method of Scatchard. Cell protein extracts were prepared generally as described(14van Driel I.R. Davis C.G. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16127-16134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 s, cells were lysed in 180 μl of 50 mM Tris-maleate, pH 6.5, 2 mM CaCl2, 1% Triton X-100, and 1.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 20 min. Cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and the lysates were stored at −70°C. Thirty to fifty μg of cell lysate was subjected to SDS-6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a Minigel apparatus (Bio-Rad) at 3.5 mA/gel at 4°C. No reducing agent or heat was used. In some experiments, 40 μg of protein extracts were treated for 1 h at room temperature with 0.016 unit of neuraminidase (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, Ontario) in 50 mM sodium citrate, pH 4.5. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham, Oakville, Ontario) in 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 20% methanol at 115 V for 1 h with refrigeration(15Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar). LDL-R protein was detected as follows. Nitrocellulose membranes were incubated in buffer A (Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.6, 2 mM CaCl2, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% dried non-fat milk for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C in buffer A with monoclonal anti-LDL-R antibody IgG-C7 (Amersham) (1 μg/ml) or IgG-4A4 (25 ng/ml), washed in buffer A, 1 × 15 min, 3 × 5 min, incubated 1 h in buffer A with anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibody (Amersham) (1/5000), and washed 1 × 15 min and 3 × 5 min with buffer A. Detection of the immunoreactive bands was performed with the ECL® chemiluminescence system (Amersham) as recommended by the manufacturer. Intensity of bands corresponding to LDL-R were quantified after densitometry of the autoradiograph with the IS-1000 Digital Imaging System version 1.97 (Alpha Innotech Corp.). Each blot was exposed to autoradiographic film for varying lengths of time (30 s to 5 min), and determination of relative band intensities was accomplished by averaging scans from 3 exposures from which the signal increased linearly with exposure time. Fibroblast culture, cell protein extract preparation, electrophoresis, and blotting were performed as for LDL-R immunoblotting. Ligand blotting was performed essentially as described(16Himber J. Electrophoresis. 1993; 14: 794-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated for 1 h at 37°C in buffer B (10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, pH 8.0) containing 50 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma) followed by an incubation for 2 h at room temperature in buffer B with 125I-LDL or 125I-β-VLDL. Blots were washed in buffer B for 15 min, followed by 3 × 30 min washes. Membranes were subjected to autoradiography. Fibroblast RNA was isolated with the RNAzol™ (Cinna Biotecx, Friendswood, TX) method(17Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63191) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the solid phase triester method on a Pharmacia LKB Gene Assembler Plus DNA synthesizer. The ratio of fibroblast and lymphocyte LDL-R mRNA to that for β-actin was quantified by RT-PCR and fluorescence DNA detection as described(7Sass C. Giroux L.M. Ma Y. Roy M. Lavigne J. Lussier-Cacan S. Davignon J. Minnich A. Hum. Genet. 1995; 96: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In LDL-R Δ5kb HTZ cells, the relative expression of the deleted versus the normal LDL-R allele was determined by amplification of the cDNA with fluorescent primers 5′-cgccgcggcggggactgcag-3′ and 5′-agttttcctcgtcagtttgtc-3′, yielding polymerase chain reaction fragments of 638 and 441 nucleotides for the normal and deleted allele, respectively. The latter oligonucleotide was labeled with Tamra® fluorescent dye (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Aliquots of the reactions were subjected to 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorescence detection and quantification on a model 373A Automated DNA Sequencer® (Applied Biosystems). The HincII polymorphism in exon 12 of the LDL-R gene (18Leitersdorf E. Hobbs H.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7215Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) was detected in cDNA as follows. cDNA from fibroblasts or lymphocytes was amplified with 100 ng each of primers 5′-ctcagtggccgcctctactgggtag-3′ and 5′-ctgtgaggcagctcctcatgtccctg-3′ in the presence of 10 μM fluorescein-12-labeled dUTP (Boehringer Mannheim, Laval, Quebec). Aliquots of the reactions were digested with HincII. Fluorescence peak areas corresponding to DNA fragments of molecular weight 140 and 204 base pairs, corresponding to the presence or absence of the HincII site, were quantified by integration with 672 GeneScanner® software (Applied Biosystems). Plasma total and LDL cholesterol concentrations in 8 probands heterozygous for the LDL-R Δ5kb were not significantly different from those in heterozygotes for a deletion in the LDL-R gene which results in a null allele (8Hobbs H.H. Brown M.S. Russell D.W. Davignon J. Goldstein J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1987; 317: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) (not shown). Binding experiments with 125I-LDL at 4°C and Scatchard analysis (Fig. 1A) revealed that the apparent defect in LDL-R activity in LDL-R Δ5kb fibroblasts was due to an apparently lower number of binding sites (94 versus 159 ng of ligand/mg of cellular protein for LDL-R Δ5kb HTZ and normal fibroblasts, respectively) with no difference in receptor affinity (2.96 and 3.12 μg/ml) compared to normal subjects. A similar experiment with β-VLDL as ligand revealed a defect in binding by Δ5kb fibroblasts of approximately 50% that was also associated with lower receptor number (205 versus 457 ng/mg) and with higher affinity (0.42 versus 0.83 μg/ml) (Fig. 1B). Although LDL-R activity in LDL-R Δ5kb fibroblasts was only 50-60% that of normal cells, the ratio of LDL-R mRNA to that for β-actin in fibroblasts and in lymphocytes was similar in carriers and non-carriers(7Sass C. Giroux L.M. Ma Y. Roy M. Lavigne J. Lussier-Cacan S. Davignon J. Minnich A. Hum. Genet. 1995; 96: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To compare the relative amount of LDL-R mRNA corresponding to the deleted allele with that of the normal allele, primers surrounding the deletion were designed (see “Materials and Methods”). Surprisingly, in fibroblast-derived cDNA from 5 related and 2 unrelated heterozygotes for the LDL-R Δ5kb, the deleted allele was consistently overexpressed compared to the normal allele by approximately 50% (Fig. 2). To see if the apparent overexpression of the deleted allele could result from more efficient amplification of a shorter DNA fragment, the Δ5kb and normal alleles were distinguished with a HincII polymorphism (18Leitersdorf E. Hobbs H.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7215Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) in exon 12 of the LDL-R gene. Haplotype analysis in a kindred (7Sass C. Giroux L.M. Ma Y. Roy M. Lavigne J. Lussier-Cacan S. Davignon J. Minnich A. Hum. Genet. 1995; 96: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) containing LDL-R Δ5kb heterozygotes revealed that the LDL-R Δ5kb allele did not contain the polymorphic HincII site (data not shown). Digestion of the LDL-R exon 12 amplified from cDNA of LDL-R Δ5kb HTZ fibroblasts in which the normal LDL-R allele contained the HincII site revealed approximately 50% greater undigested than digested fragment (data not shown). Thus, low receptor activity in LDL-R Δ5kb HTZ fibroblasts cannot be attributed to defective transcription of the Δ5kb allele. Because the recognition epitope of IgG-C7 is the first repeat of the ligand-binding domain(3van Driel I.R. Goldstein J.L. Sudhof T.C. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17443-17449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this antibody was not expected to recognize the LDL-R Δ5kb. Consistent with this, only one band of apparent molecular mass of 140 kDa (average value from 9 independent experiments) was observed when blots of protein extracts from normal and LDL-R Δ5kb HTZ fibroblasts were probed with this antibody (Fig. 3, left, LDL-R IgG-C7). When similar blots were probed with monoclonal anti-LDL-R antibody IgG-4C4, raised against the carboxyl terminus of the LDL-R(3van Driel I.R. Goldstein J.L. Sudhof T.C. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17443-17449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), only one band was seen for normal fibroblasts, while two bands were seen in LDL-R Δ5kb HTZ fibroblasts (Fig. 3, left, LDL-R IgG-4A4). The second band, not revealed with IgG-C7, appears at approximately 127 kDa, consistent with the deletion of amino acids encoded by 2 and 3 resulting in the loss of 83 amino acids (approximately 10 kDa). The relative amounts of LDL-R protein was assessed by densitometry in 4 independent experiments. The amount of total LDL-R protein was similar in normal and Δ5kb HTZ fibroblasts (Fig. 3, lower right). The amount of protein corresponding to the normal and LDL-R Δ5kb allele was approximately equal in fibroblasts from 4 LDL-R Δ5kb HTZ (Fig. 3, left, LDL-R IgG-4A4, and lower right panel). No LDL-R protein was detected with extracts from receptor-negative fibroblasts with either antibody (Fig. 3, left, Δ10kb HMZ). Thus, the LDL-R Δ5kb protein appears to be synthesized in normal amounts. Treatment of cell protein extracts from LDL-R Δ5kb HTZ fibroblasts with neuraminidase reduced the apparent size of the normal receptor from 147 to 134 kDa (Fig. 4), consistent with previous reports of 10-15-kDa reduction(19Cummings R.D. Kornfeld S. Schneider W.J. Hobgood K.K. Tolleshaug H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15261-15273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Schneider W.J. Beisiegel U. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2664-2673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A reduction of apparent molecular mass was also observed for the Δ5kb protein, from 134 to 117 kDa. The difference in size between the normal and deleted receptor was similar before and after neuraminidase treatment. Thus, no defect in glycosylation of the Δ5kb receptor was detected. To address the possibility that low LDL-R activity in LDL-R Δ5kb HTZ fibroblasts could be attributable to defective transport of the Δ5kb receptor to the cell surface, binding of anti-LDL-R antibodies to fibroblasts was studied. The number of binding sites for 125IgG-4A4, which recognizes both the normal and Δ5kb receptor, did not differ in normal and LDL-R Δ5kb HTZ fibroblasts (13 ng/mg cell protein, Fig. 5), despite lower affinity for the antibody in Δ5kb HTZ fibroblasts (0.43 versus 0.14 μg/ml). A similar result was obtained in a second experiment, in which specific binding of 1 and 5 μg of 125IgG-4A4 by LDL-R Δ5kb HTZ fibroblasts (measured in the presence of a 50-fold excess of unlabeled antibody) was 56 and 75% of normal (data not shown). Binding of 1 and 5 μg of 125IgG-4A4 to LDL receptor-negative fibroblasts was 19 and 21% of that in normal fibroblasts. Ligand blotting of fibroblast protein extracts with 125I-LDL resulted in a band of approximately 140 kDa in normal fibroblasts (Fig. 6, lanes 2 and 6) but none in LDL-R-deficient fibroblasts (Fig. 6, lanes 1, 5, and 10). Ligand blotting of cell protein from LDL-R Δ5kb HTZ fibroblasts revealed the same band as seen in normal subjects, but of lower intensity, and, in only 1 of 4 instances, a faint band of lower molecular mass (Fig. 6, lane 9), corresponding to the Δ5kb form of the LDL-R. In 2 of 3 independent preparations, no binding of 125I-LDL to the Δ5kb receptor was detectable (Fig. 6, lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8), even after 6 days of exposure. Similar experiments with 125I-β-VLDL revealed interaction of this ligand with the deleted receptor which was detectable but weak (Fig. 6B). Immunoblotting performed in parallel on these same protein extracts revealed immunoreactive protein corresponding to both the normal and Δ5kb receptor in equal amounts. Thus, the Δ5kb receptor displays little or no ability to bind LDL or β-VLDL under these experimental conditions. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments have shown minimal loss of LDL and β-VLDL binding, respectively, from an LDL receptor lacking exons 2 and 3 encoding the first two of seven ligand binding repeats (3van Driel I.R. Goldstein J.L. Sudhof T.C. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17443-17449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Esser V. Limbird L.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13282-13290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on this information it is surprising that in French Canadians, with the exception of carriers of the ϵ2 allele(7Sass C. Giroux L.M. Ma Y. Roy M. Lavigne J. Lussier-Cacan S. Davignon J. Minnich A. Hum. Genet. 1995; 96: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), heterozygosity for a 5-kb deletion of the LDL-R gene (LDL-R Δ5kb) encompassing exons 2 and 3 is associated with plasma LDL and total cholesterol levels which are equally as elevated as those associated with heterozygosity for an LDL-R null allele. The present study sought to resolve this apparent contradiction between in vivo phenotype and in vitro consequences of the LDL-R deletion. Among possibilities to explain the association of the LDL-R Δ5kb with FH were decreased mRNA or protein synthesis, slow transport to the cell surface, or poor affinity of the receptor for LDL. The first two possibilities were ruled out by measurements of normal levels of mRNA and normal levels of LDL-R protein in LDL-R Δ5kb HTZ fibroblasts. The receptor appeared to be glycosylated normally, implying normal processing(21Leitersdorf E. Tobin E.J. Davignon J. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1014-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). LDL-R Δ5kb HTZ fibroblasts bound similar amounts of anti-LDL-R antibody IgG-4A4 as did normal cells, also suggesting normal transport of the Δ5kb receptor to the cell surface. However, ligand blotting of cell protein extracts from LDL-R Δ5kb HTZ fibroblasts revealed little or no LDL binding to the Δ5kb receptor. Thus, the apparent reduction of 50% in receptor number in LDL-R Δ5kb HTZ fibroblasts compared to normal is due not to the absence of the receptor on the cell surface, such as in a class 2 receptor defect, but to the inability of the receptor to bind LDL, i.e. a class 3 defect. The deleted receptor was also defective in binding apolipoprotein E, as evidenced by 50% of normal maximal cell surface binding of β-VLDL in Δ5kb HTZ fibroblasts and by weak interaction with the deleted receptor on ligand blots. This result is also in contrast to those observed in the transfected receptor lacking exons 2 and 3, which displayed no defect in β-VLDL uptake and to data which suggest that LDL-R repeat 5 mediates binding of apolipoprotein E-containing lipoproteins(22Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21682-21688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely to the present study, theoretically severe mutations in the LDL receptor gene do not always result in the FH phenotype. A class 2B defective LDL-R receptor (i.e. synthesized but not displayed on cell surface) was reported (23Nora J.J. Lortscher R.M. Spangler R.D. Bilheimer D.W. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1985; 22: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 24Bilheimer D.W. Cara E. Grundy S.M. Nora J.J. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1985; 22: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) in which heterozygous parents of the affected homozygous child did not express consistent or significant hypercholesterolemia. An LDL-R gene deletion of approximately 10 kb, FH-Tonami-2(25Mabuchi H. Kajinami K. Fujita H. Koizumi J. Takeda R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 598: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar), eliminating exons 2 and 3, has been found in 10 Japanese families with hypercholesterolemia and is associated with cholesterol levels lower than those of typical FH patients, including two heterozygous family members with normal plasma cholesterol levels (26Kajinami K.K. Fujita H. Koizumi J. Takeda R. Ohta M. Circulation. 1989; 80: 278Google Scholar). According to the present data, such cases of milder than expected FH phenotype are most likely explained by up-regulation of the normal allele in some cases rather than by residual function of the defective LDL-R. Several possibilities could explain the discrepancy between the consequences of deleting LDL-R exons 2 and 3 described herein and those previously described (4Esser V. Limbird L.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13282-13290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present ~5-kb genomic deletion of the LDL-R gene between introns 1 and 3 (2Ma Y. Betard C. Roy M. Davignon J. Kessling A.M. Clin. Genet. 1989; 36: 219-228PubMed Google Scholar) is predicted to result in an in-frame creation of an Ala residue at the expense of Val2 and Pro84; i.e. an amino-terminal sequence of Ala1-Ala-Pro85. In the site-directed mutagenesis study(4Esser V. Limbird L.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13282-13290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the deletion was of residues 1-83; i.e. an amino-terminal sequence of Pro84-Pro85. The possible functional significance of this difference is not clear but seems unlikely to account for differences in the ligand binding ability of the two deleted receptors. Other examples of discrepancies between apparent effects of gene deletions as assessed by in vitro studies and by phenotypic expression of a naturally occurring deletion is seen when domain 3 (O-linked sugar domain) is deleted in vitro by site-directed mutagenesis resulting in no defect in receptor activity(27Davis C.G. Elhammer A. Russell D.W. Schneider W.J. Kornfeld S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2828-2838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while a homozygote for such a mutation expresses FH(28Kajinami K. Mabuchi H. Itoh H. Michishita I. Takeda M. Wakasugi T. Koizumi J. Takeda R. Arteriosclerosis. 1988; 8: 187-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Soutar A.K. Knight B.L. Br. Med. Bull. 1990; 46: 891-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A variant of lipoprotein lipase containing an Asn291→Ser substitution which is functionally mildly abnormal in vitro(30Reymer P.W.A. Gagne E. Groenemeyer B.E. Zhang H. Forsyth I. Jansen H. Seidell J.C. Kromhout D. Lie K.E. Kastelein J. Hayden M.R. Nature Genet. 1995; 10: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) is associated with type IV hypertriglyceridemia in French Canadians(31Minnich A. Kessling A. Roy M. Giry C. DeLangavant G. Lavigne J. Lussier-Cacan S. Davignon J. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 117-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of lipoprotein lipase, the unexpectedly profound clinical effect of heterozygosity for a mildly defective variant may be attributable to a dominant negative mechanism, wherein the defective variant would interfere with lipoprotein lipase dimerization, which is necessary for function. Although the LDL-R is present on the cell surface as a monomer, one possible locus for a dominant negative effect of heterozygosity for a defective receptor could be in receptor clustering prior to internalization(14van Driel I.R. Davis C.G. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16127-16134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Anderson R.G. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S.

However, such an explanation for the defective LDL-R activity observed in LDL-R Δ5kb HTZ fibroblasts is unlikely based on the observation that the Δ5kb receptor is poorly able to bind ligand. A more likely explanation for the discrepancies between results obtained from site-directed mutagenesis studies and HTZ fibroblasts is the amount of receptor expressed under each set of circumstances. Overexpression of proteins in transfected cells has been observed to result in unphysiological phenomena, such as secretion of immature forms of apolipoprotein A-I (33Rhogani A. Zannis V.I. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7428-7435Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) or constitutive activity of sterol regulatory element binding proteins 1 and 2(34Yang J. Sato R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1910-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, prediction of in vivo phenotypic effects of gene mutations from their functional effects in transfected cells may be complicated by the unphysiologically high levels of expression. It has been estimated that 15-30% of “isolated” O-linked carbohydrate is located on the amino-terminal half of the receptor(27Davis C.G. Elhammer A. Russell D.W. Schneider W.J. Kornfeld S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2828-2838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), more specifically, within the ~40-kDa ligand-binding domain(35Yoshimura A. Yoshida T. Seguchi T. Waki M. Ono M. Kuwano M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13299-13308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of glycosylation in this domain in a monensin-resistant cell line has been shown to reduce LDL-R affinity for LDL by approximately 75%(35Yoshimura A. Yoshida T. Seguchi T. Waki M. Ono M. Kuwano M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13299-13308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, loss of O-linked carbohydrate may at least partially explain the absence of ligand binding of the LDL-R Δ5kb receptor observed in the present study. Although similar decreases in molecular mass after neuraminidase treatment between the LDL-R Δ5kb and normal protein in the present study may imply that significant O-linked glycosylation does not occur in the first two repeats of the LDL-R, it is questionable whether a difference would be detectable. O-Linked sialic acid and galactose residues are expected to contribute approximately 25 kDa to the molecular mass of the LDL-R (27Davis C.G. Elhammer A. Russell D.W. Schneider W.J. Kornfeld S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2828-2838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, if the carbohydrate was evenly distributed among repeats, the expected loss of molecular size after neuraminidase treatment due to glycosylation of the first two repeats is 3 kDa. Thus, it is possible that the effect of deletion of exons 2 and 3 on LDL-R activity is attributable to loss of carbohydrate and subsequent loss of receptor affinity for LDL. As such, possible differences in glycosylation patterns between human fibroblasts and transfected CHO cells may contribute to differences between the present and a previous study (4Esser V. Limbird L.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13282-13290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on the functional consequence of the absence of these two repeats. Another potentially interesting explanation for the surprisingly severe effects of the LDL-R Δ5kb is a regulatory effect of a gene deletion that is not apparent in cells transfected with cDNA. Thus, one possibility is that deletion of a liver-specific enhancer in introns 1 or 2 causes a liver-specific regulatory defect. An LDL-R gene deletion of exons 2 and 3 similar to the LDL-R Δ5kb has been reported to result from Alu recombination(36Kigawa K. Kihara K. Miyake Y. Tajima S. Funahashi T. Yamamura T. Yamamoto A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Alu sequences have been known to act as enhancers (37Hambor J.E. Mennone J. Coon M.E. Hanke J.H. Kavathas P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7056-7070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or repressors(37Hambor J.E. Mennone J. Coon M.E. Hanke J.H. Kavathas P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7056-7070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, however, LDL-R mRNA corresponding to the Δ5kb allele was consistently higher in fibroblasts and lymphocytes than that of the normal allele, suggesting deletion of an element which may act as a repressor, at least in these cell types. Further studies will explore the regulatory consequences of the LDL-R Δ5kb.

Short range order depends on crystallin-crystallin as well as water-crystallin interactions. Light scattering measurements can provide information on the hydration of crystallins.

Their function is to provide a transparent assembly with a refractive index gradient that is capable of focusing light onto the retina(1Benedek G.B. Appl.

Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1993; 49: 223-233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They are located mostly in the regions of the lens with the highest refractive index (11Slingsby C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1985; 10: 281-284Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (55) Google Scholar). β crystallins are of intermediate size between α and γ crystallins forming oligomers from a variety of subunits(12Zigler Jr., J.S. Exp. Eye Res. 1978; 26: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 13Zigler Jr., J.S. Horwitz J. Kinoshita J.H. Exp.

Thus, the lens crystallins can be subdivided into heterogeneous groups on the basis of their apparent size. The largest group is that of α crystallin, which is made of aggregates of two subunits αA and αB (each of them with a mass of about 20 kDa). These subunits are individual gene products exhibiting a very low rate of evolutionary change(15Bloemendal H. Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Eye Lens. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1981: 221-278Google Scholar, 16Wistow G.J. Piatigorsky J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 479-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). They exist as polydisperse high molecular weight aggregates. The β crystallins are also aggregates of many subunits with extensive polydispersity(12Zigler Jr., J.S. Exp. Eye Res. 1978; 26: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 13Zigler Jr., J.S. Horwitz J. Kinoshita J.H. Exp. Eye Res. 1980; 31: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Sequencing studies showed that bovine β crystallins have three acidic (βA2, βA3/A1, and βA4) and three basic (βB1, βB2, and βB3) subunits with apparent mass of 23, 25, and 23 kDa and 32, 26, and 27 kDa, respectively(14Slingsby C. Bateman O.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6592-6599Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Bovine βH crystallin with apparent molecular mass of 160-200 kDa contains all the β subunits in different combinations, whereas the βL crystallin fraction with apparent molecular mass of 46-70 kDa lacks βB1 subunits(14Slingsby C. Bateman O.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6592-6599Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The subunits form homo- and heterodimers and -oligomers. The structure of the βB2 homodimer have been studied extensively(17Bax B. Lapatto R. Nalini V. Driessen H. Lindley P.F. Mahadevan Blundell T.L. Slingsby C.

Biol. 1991; 222: 1067-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Each domain is formed from two “Greek key” motifs, and the connecting peptide is extended. The secondary structure is made of β sheets(18Lapatto R. Nalini V. Bax B. Driessen H. Lindley P.F. Blundell T.L. Slingsby C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 1067-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The dimer stability is provided by the intersubunit β sheet interfaces and the C-terminal extension in βB2 dimerization (18Lapatto R. Nalini V. Bax B. Driessen H. Lindley P.F. Blundell T.L.

These crystallins are the products of different genes, although β and γ crystallins may have had a common ancestral gene. The various crystallin families and their individual members are differentially expressed during development (15Bloemendal H. Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Eye Lens. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1981: 221-278Google Scholar) leading to different mixtures of crystallins along the optical axis. The particular packing of these crystallins depends on the size as well as on the interaction of the crystallins with themselves and with the aqueous surrounding. The combination of these effects results in a protein gradient along the optic axis, and because each crystallin family has its individual refractive index contribution(21Fernald R.D. Wright S.E. Nature. 1983; 301: 618-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), it also results in a refractive index gradient. In addition to the structural features of crystallins, their solvation properties and their specific interactions in homo- and heteroaggregations are of importance(22Veretout F. Tardieu A. Eur. Biophys. J. 1989; 17: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Kenworthy A.K. Magid A.D. Oliver T.N. McIntosh T.J. Exp.

The transparency of the lens depends on its hydration(2Bettelheim F.A. Siew E.L. Biophys. J. 1983; 41: 29-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 3Bettelheim F.A. Maisel H. The Ocular Lens Structure, Function, and Pathology. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1985: 265-300Google Scholar). The hydration of the lens is a complex phenomenon(27Lahm D. Lee L.K. Bettelheim F.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1985; 26: 1162-1165PubMed Google Scholar, 28Bettelheim F.A. Ali S. White O. Chylack Jr., L.T. Invest.

It involves interaction of the crystallins with water, protein-protein interactions, crystallin distribution, and gradient in the lens. The hydration of the lens can be better understood if the role of the individual factors in the hydration process are known. The present study was designed to probe the stability of the crystallins in aqueous solutions by calculating the thermodynamic parameters of solution from light scattering measurements. These parameters are important in assessing the interaction of water with single crystallin molecules, one aspect of the total hydration process. Bovine eyes were obtained from a local slaughterhouse. The lenses were removed and processed within 6 h postmortem. Lenses were homogenized in 7 volumes of 0.05 M Tris buffer at pH 7.5, which also contained 0.1 M KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02% NaN3. After centrifugation the supernatant was applied to a Sephadex G-200 column, and four fractions (α, βH, βL, and γ fractions) were collected and identified by SDS gel electrophoresis (13Zigler Jr., J.S. Horwitz J. Kinoshita J.H. Exp. Eye Res. 1980; 31: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The four crystallin fractions were dialyzed against distilled water using 4 kDa of exclusion dialysis membrane. The two β-fractions were lyophylized, and the γ fraction and a part of the βL fraction were concentrated at room temperature under a vacuum to a 5% concentration to avoid low temperature denaturation(31Bettelheim F.A. Reid M.B. McPhie P. Garland D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The crystallins were dissolved in 0.1 M Na2HPO4 buffer, pH 7.4, or diluted from their concentrated solutions to have a final 0.1 M buffer concentration. Light scattering measurements were performed in a model 3000 Universal Light Scattering Photometer (C. N. Wood Manufacturing Co.). The wavelength of the light source (mercury lamp) was 546 μm. The light scattering intensities of crystallin solutions were measured as a function of protein concentration, scattering angle, and temperature. The temperature control was achieved by thermocouple-regulated heating of the scattering cell wrapped with nickel-iron, and chromium heating wires at the top and the bottom of the cell(32Wang X. Bettelheim F.A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1989; 5: 166-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The temperature was maintained within 0.05°C of the set temperature. The crystallin solutions were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min before the light scattering measurements to eliminate dust particles and incompletely dissolved aggregates. The concentration of centrifuged solution was established by measuring their absorbance at 280 μm and comparing it with previously established calibration curves for each crystallin fraction. The actual readings of the instrument in volts were converted to the appropriate Rayleigh ratio by establishing the instrument constant. The light scattering of triply distilled and filtered water at a 90°C scattering angle was measured, and the instrument constant was calculated using the absolute scattering of water at this angle and wavelength: 1 × 10-6 cm-1(33Zimm B.H. J. Chem. Phys. 1948; 16: 1099-1116Crossref Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). A secondary standard of an opaque light scattering plate was used to recalibrate the instrument after each series of angular measurements to eliminate errors due to voltage fluctuation in the light source. Light scattering measurements were taken between 20 and 60°C scattering angles at temperatures of 16-27°C. In Fig. 1 typical light scattering data are presented in the form of a Zimm plot(33Zimm B.H. J. Chem. Phys. 1948; 16: 1099-1116Crossref Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). The sample in this case was βL crystallin at 19.0°C. This βL crystallin was concentrated at room temperature under a vacuum to a 5% concentration and sequentially diluted for a light scattering study. Another βL fraction was lyophylized and dissolved in buffer. It gave a Zimm plot with identical parameters, indicating the fact that βL does not undergo low temperature denaturation(31Bettelheim F.A. Reid M.B. McPhie P. Garland D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In the Zimm plot the light scattering intensity is presented in the y axis in the form of c/R‘θ, where c is the concentration of the protein in g/cm3 and R‘θ is the Rayleigh ratio for unpolarized light (34Tanford C. Physical Chemistry of Macromolecules. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1961: 200-202Google Scholar) given by the equation R'θ=(Iθ/I0)(r2/1+cos2θ)(Eq. 1) where θ is the scattering angle, Iθ is the intensity of the scattered beam at angle θ, I0 is the intensity of the incident beam (at a scattering angle of 0), and r is the distance between the scattering volume of the sample and the detector in cm. The x axis contains both concentration and scattering angle. K‘ is an arbitrary constant (100 in Fig. 1) to spread the diagram, giving about equal weight to the concentration and to the scattering angle. The intercept of the two extrapolated lines with the y axis is inversely related to the MW, weight average molecular weight of the sample; the slope of the 0 concentration line is related to the RG, radius of gyration, a size parameter. Finally the slope of the 0 scattering angle line yields the second virial coefficient from which the enthalpy and entropy of solution of the crystallins can be calculated. The weight average molecular weights calculated from the intercept of the Zimm plots were as follows: 200,000 for βH, 81,200 for βL (indicating mostly tetrameric form), and 19,800 for γ crystallin. These are in agreement with literature values(7Blundell T. Lindley P. Miller L. Moss D. Slingsby C. Tickle I. Turnell B. Wistow G. Nature. 1981; 289: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 14Slingsby C. Bateman O.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6592-6599Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The second virial coefficients obtained from the Zimm plots are presented in Fig. 2 as a function of the reciprocal temperature. The straight line plot corresponds to the prediction of Flory's theory(35Flory P.J. Principles of Polymer Chemistry. Cornell University Press, Ithaca, NY1953: 495-540Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that in both β fractions the second virial coefficient decreases with temperature while in α crystallin(32Wang X. Bettelheim F.A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1989; 5: 166-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and in γ crystallin it increases with temperature. The second virial coefficient A2 is expressed as A2=(1/2-χ1)V22―/NAVV1(Eq. 2) where V2 is the partial specific volume, V1 is the molar volume of the solvent, NAv is Avogadro's number, and χ1 is an interaction parameter related to the partial molar free energy of the solution. The χ1 interaction parameter has enthalpy (κ1) and entropy (ψ1) contributions(34Tanford C. Physical Chemistry of Macromolecules. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1961: 200-202Google Scholar, 35Flory P.J. Principles of Polymer Chemistry. Cornell University Press, Ithaca, NY1953: 495-540Google Scholar). (1/2-χ1)=ψ1-κ1=ψ1(1-θF/T)(Eq. 3) where T is the absolute temperature and θF is the Flory temperature; at this temperature the interaction parameter becomes ½, and the second virial coefficient equals zero. A plot of A2 against [1/T] such as in Fig. 2 yields the entropy parameter as an intercept and the enthalpy parameters and Flory's temperature as the slope. From these the partial molar enthalpy (ΔH) and the partial molar entropy (ΔS) can be calculated. ΔH―=RTκ1V22(Eq. 4) ΔS―=Rψ1V22(Eq. 5) where R is the gas constant and V2 is the volume fraction of the solute. The partial molar enthalpies of solution for α, βH, βL, and γ crystallins are presented in Table 1 as a function of concentration of crystallins. The ΔH of α crystallin is taken from a previous publication (32Wang X. Bettelheim F.A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1989; 5: 166-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and is presented for comparison. Both α and γ crystallins possess positive enthalpy of solution (endothermic), whereas the β crystallin fractions have small negative enthalpy of solutions (exothermic).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The partial molar entropy values of solutions of α, βH, βL, and γ crystallins are also given in Table 1 as a function of crystallin concentrations. It is interesting to note that βL and γ fractions have identical partial molar entropies of solutions. The present study was intended to illuminate the interaction of crystallins with the aqueous environment. We calculate the partial molar enthalpy and entropy of solutions from the temperature dependence of the second virial coefficients of light scattering measurements. These are extrapolated values, and as such the numerical values of A2 had a standard deviation of ±2.5%, and the temperature dependence of A2 is statistically significant at the 90% confidence level. Thus, it is better to focus on the relative trends shown by the different crystallins than on the absolute values of partial molar enthalpies and entropies. The strong concentration dependence of the partial molar enthalpy of α crystallin indicates polydispersity. The partial molar enthalpy represents the energy expended when 1 mol of crystallin is dissolved in a solution of specified concentration having infinitely large volume. A positive ΔH value means that in order to solvate the crystallin, to surround it with a bound water layer, energy input is necessary. This is what happens in α and γ crystallins. The β crystallin fractions have small but negative partial molar enthalpy values. This implies that the water-β crystallin interaction is less energetic than the average of water-water and crystallin-crystallin interaction. This indicates a tendency for dimeric and oligomeric aggregation. The partial molar entropy values are positive for all crystallin fractions. Thus the randomness on the dispersion of a crystallin in water and the gain in segment mobility of the polypeptide chain upon solvation are greater than the contribution of water immobilization in the bound solvation layer. The entropy of solution values follow the molecular size of the crystallins. α crystallin has entropy values 1 order of magnitude greater than the other groups. The monomeric γ fraction and the mainly tetrameric βL fraction have identical partial molar entropy of solutions indicating the compact nature of these proteins. The βH fraction that is largely made of oligomeric aggregates of subunits has larger albeit the same order of magnitude of partial molar entropy values as those of the smaller molecular weight compounds. The combination of enthalpy and entropy of solution may explain the behavior of the different crystallins in immobilizing water in their solvation layer. The βH crystallin has greater bound (nonfreezable) water content than α crystallin(24Bettelheim F.A. Popdimitrova N. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 50: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Even though the mass of βH is three to five times smaller than that of α crystallin and thus does not gain that much in segment mobility in solubilization, it still binds more water than α crystallin. The negative enthalpy of solution implies strong solute-solute interactions. A strong attraction, possibly among the Greek motifs, would trap more water in the bound form around the extended connecting peptides. The hydration of α crystallin is largely entropy driven. The βL and γ crystallins immobilize water to about the same degree in their solvation layer (26Bettelheim F.A. Bove A. Dolan R. Exp. Eye Res. 1991; 52: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) in the form of nonfreezable water. However, when the same tendency is probed by water vapor sorption, the γ fraction has much less bound water in the solvation layer(24Bettelheim F.A. Popdimitrova N. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 50: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This may be the result of the negative enthalpy of solution of the βL crystallin, which enables strong interactions in the dimerization trapping more water around the dimer than around the monomeric γ crystallins. Bovine lens uses three different families of crystallins to build a protein concentration gradient along the optic axis. For transparency and hence for optimal packing all three crystallins are necessary. The main finding of this study was that the slope of the temperature-dependent second virial coefficients and hence the enthalpy of hydration of β crystallins are negative, whereas that of α and γ crystallins are positive. Thus, one could propose that although the γ crystallins by their size may provide an optimal packing, the β crystallins by their tendency of strong intermolecular association and water immobilization also enhance close packing."
