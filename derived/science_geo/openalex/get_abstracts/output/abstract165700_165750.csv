https://openalex.org/W2033801528,"The Caenorhabditis elegans sel-10 protein is structurally similar to E3 ubiquitin ligases and is a negative regulator of Notch (lin-12) and presenilin signaling. In this report, we characterize the mammalian Sel-10 homolog (mSel-10) and analyze its effects on Notch signaling. We find that mSel-10 localizes to the cell nucleus, and that it physically interacts with the Notch 1 intracellular domain (IC) and reduces Notch 1 IC-mediated activation of the HES 1 promoter. Notch 1 IC is ubiquitinated by mSel-10, and ubiquitination requires the presence of the most carboxyl-terminal region of the Notch IC, including the PEST domain. In the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132, the amount of Notch 1 IC and its level of ubiquitination are increased. Interestingly, this accumulation of Notch 1 IC in the presence of MG132 is accompanied by decreased activation of the HES 1 promoter, suggesting that ubiquitinated Notch 1 IC is a less potent transactivator. Finally, we show that mSel-10 itself is ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome. In conclusion, these data reveal the importance of ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation for the activity and turnover of Notch ICs, and demonstrate that mSel-10 plays a key role in this process.

A Notch receptor is a single transmembrane protein with a large extracellular domain containing multiple epidermal growth factor repeats, and an intracellular domain containing ankyrin repeats and PEST sequence. Notch receptors interact with cell-bound ligands of the DSL (Delta/Serrate/Lag-1) type presented on juxtaposed cells (1Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4855) Google Scholar). Notch signaling requires at least three proteolytic cleavages of the receptor (for review, see Ref. 2Brown M.S. Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). The two first cleavages take place at the extracellular side, whereas the third cleavage is controlled by presenilins and occurs in the transmembrane region close to the cytoplasmic side (3Kopan R. Schroeter E.H. Weintraub H. Nye J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1683-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 4Lecourtois M. Schweisguth F. Curr.

The third cleavage releases the intracellular domain (IC),1 which translocates to the nucleus. In the nucleus, the Notch IC binds to the DNA-binding protein CSL (RBP-Jk) and functions as a transactivating protein, controlling the expression of Notch target genes. The most well characterized target genes are the HES genes, which encode negative transcriptional regulators of the basic helix-loop-helix type (for review, see Ref. 7Kadesch T. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 260: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).The Notch receptor is thus both the sensor of the ligand and the provider of a transactivating domain for regulation of downstream genes. A potential problem associated with using this mode of signaling is that the signal is not controlled by the ligand once the Notch IC is cleaved. Thus, a long-lived Notch IC would keep the cell in a prolonged and uncontrolled “on-state,” in particular since only very small amounts of Notch IC are required for signaling (8Jarriault S. Brou C. Logeat F. Schroeter E.H. Kopan R. Israel A. Nature. 1995; 377: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). It therefore seems reasonable that the activity of the intracellular domain is under strict control, either by Notch-modulating proteins that control its activity (7Kadesch T. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 260: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), or by rapid turnover and proteolysis of the intracellular domain.To gain further insights into the control and degradation of the mammalian Notch IC, we have focused our interest on the gene for Sel-10. Work in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegansdemonstrates that the gene for sel-10 is a negative regulator of Notch. sel-10 was originally identified by Sundaram and Greenwald (9Sundaram M. Greenwald I. Genetics. 1993; 135: 765-783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) inC. elegans through a genetic screen for modifiers of the Notch homolog lin-12. Loss of sel-10 activity rescues a lin-12 hypomorph, suggesting that sel-10 negatively regulates Notch activity (10Hubbard E.J.A. Wu G. Kitajewski J. Greenwald I. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3182-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Furthermore, sel-10 acts at the level of the intracellular domain, since loss-of-function of sel-10 reduces the effects of a lin-12 intracellular domain (10Hubbard E.J.A. Wu G. Kitajewski J. Greenwald I. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3182-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The sel-10 protein contains an F-box and WD40 repeats (10Hubbard E.J.A. Wu G. Kitajewski J. Greenwald I. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3182-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), which are characteristic of E3 ubiquitin ligases. E3 ubiquitin ligases are, together with the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme and E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, responsible for targeting proteins for proteasome-mediated protein degradation (11Ciechanover A. Orian A. Schwartz A.L. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 12Hochstrasser M. Nature Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E153-E157Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). E3 ubiquitin ligases attach ubiquitin to target proteins, thereby allowing them to be recognized and degraded by the 26 S proteasome. There are a large number of E3 ubiquitin ligases, each with specificity for particular target proteins. The fact that sel-10 negatively regulates Notch and presenilins and is structurally similar to E3 ubiquitin ligases has led to the proposal that sel-10 may act by targeting Notch and presenilins for proteasome-mediated degradation (10Hubbard E.J.A. Wu G. Kitajewski J. Greenwald I. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3182-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar).In this report, we characterize a mammalian homolog of Sel-10 (mSel-10) and show that mSel-10 ubiquitinates Notch 1 IC and negatively regulates Notch signaling. We also demonstrate that mSel-10 itself is ubiquitinated and subject to proteasome-mediated degradation. This shows that ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation are important control mechanisms for Notch activity, and it defines a role for mSel-10 in this process.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we describe the characterization of the mammalian Sel-10 gene and its regulation of Notch signaling. We find that the mouse and human genomes contain one highly conserved sel-10 homolog, and that this is true also for Drosophila. When the sel-10 sequences from C. elegans, Drosophila, and man are compared, some of the most highly conserved regions are the F-box and WD40 repeats, in agreement with a role for mSel-10 as an E3 ubiquitin ligase mSel-10 is predominantly localized to the nucleus and reduces the Notch IC-mediated transcriptional activation from a HES promoter in a presenilin-independent manner. The observed reduction of HES promoter activation at the level of the Notch intracellular domain agrees with genetic findings from C. elegans, where loss of sel-10 rescues a lin-12 (Notch) hypomorph and leads to augmentation of a phenotype caused by overexpression of the lin-12 intracellular domain (10Hubbard E.J.A. Wu G. Kitajewski J. Greenwald I. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3182-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). No role has yet been ascribed to the Drosophila sel-10 homolog, but mutations in the 26 S proteasome subunit inDrosophila lead to increased Notch IC levels (17Schweisguth F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11382-11386Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), indicating that there is a link between Notch IC levels and proteasome function also in Drosophila.We demonstrate that Notch IC is ubiquitinated by mSel-10. Ubiquitination of Notch 1 IC requires the 400 most carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues in Notch 1 IC. Interestingly, this region contains a PEST domain, and PEST domains have in a number of other proteins been shown to play a role in the degradation of the protein (for review, see Ref. 11Ciechanover A. Orian A. Schwartz A.L. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Since the PEST domain is highly conserved in all Notch ICs, and thus likely to be important for function, it is possible that a role for the Notch IC PEST domain is to control mSel-10-mediated ubiquitination-dependent turnover of the Notch IC domain. In addition to mSel-10 one other E3 ubiquitin ligase, Itch, has been shown to ubiquitinate Notch IC (18Qui L. Joazeiro C. Fang N. Wang H.Y. Elly C. Altman Y. Fang D. Hunter T. Liu Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275 (35437): 35734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Itch-mediated ubiquitination of Notch 1 IC in T cells appears not to require the PEST domain (18Qui L. Joazeiro C. Fang N. Wang H.Y. Elly C. Altman Y. Fang D. Hunter T. Liu Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275 (35437): 35734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar).It is noteworthy that ubiquitination of Notch 1 IC by mSel-10 is only observed in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132. This suggests that Notch 1 IC ubiquitinated by mSel-10 is normally rapidly degraded by the proteasome, and therefore does not accumulate in cells where proteasome function is not blocked. It was therefore somewhat unexpected that the total amount of Notch 1 IC was not reduced in cells expressing transfected mSel-10, but this may be a consequence of the large amounts of Notch 1 IC produced after transfection, which may mask a small decrease caused by the increased mSel-10 activity. The finding that Notch 1 IC is ubiquitinated and subjected to proteasome-mediated degradation suggests that the Notch IC is turned over faster than the reminder of the Notch receptor. This provides a plausible explanation to why Notch IC is notoriously difficult to observe after cleavage of the full-length Notch receptor, when the extracellular domain can be detected (19Levitan D. Greenwald I. Development. 1998; 125: 3101-3109PubMed Google Scholar). A rapid turnover of the Notch IC would also alleviate the problem inherent to the Notch receptor mode of signaling,i.e. that Notch IC cannot be controlled by extracellular stimuli after receptor cleavage, which transfers the Notch IC to the nucleus. Rapid degradation of Notch 1 IC by the proteasome would quickly extinguish the transactivation signal in the nucleus if no more Notch receptor was cleaved at the cell surface. The ubiquitination-mediated inactivation of Notch IC signaling may in fact not exclusively depend on the degradation of the Notch IC by the proteasome. The observation that, in the presence of MG132, the levels of Notch 1 IC protein increase at the same time as HES activation is reduced (Fig. 5) may argue that ubiquitinated Notch 1 IC is a less potent transactivator, which would lead to attenuation of Notch signaling already at the stage of Notch IC ubiquitination,i.e. before Notch IC is degraded. We do not yet know whether ubiquitination affects binding of Notch 1 IC to the DNA-binding protein CSL or whether it masks a transactivation domain in Notch 1 IC.We found that mSel-10 protein levels were dramatically increased in the presence of MG132, and that immunoprecipitated mSel-10 was ubiquitinated specifically after addition of MG132. This demonstrates that mSel-10 itself is a target for ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. It is interesting to observe that the E3 ubiquitin ligase cdc4p, which is the protein structurally most closely related to mSel-10 (10Hubbard E.J.A. Wu G. Kitajewski J. Greenwald I. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3182-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 16Wu G. Hubbard E.J. Kitajewski J.K. Greenwald I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15787-15791Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), recently was found to be subject to ubiquitination and degradation (20Zhou P. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 571-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In the case of cdc4p, ubiquitination appears to be carried out by an auto-ubiquitination mechanism (20Zhou P. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 571-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), but whether this is the case also for mSel-10 remains to be established.In addition to the role in Notch IC ubiquitination demonstrated here, mSel-10 also functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase in its interaction with its other target protein, presenilin. 2J. Li, A. Pauley, R. L. Myers, R. Shuang, J. R. Brashler, R. Yan, A. E. Buhl, and M. E. Gurney, submitted for publication. Physical interaction between mSel-10 and presenilin 1 is observed only in the presence of proteasome inhibitors and presenilin is ubiquitinated by mammalian Sel-10.2 This observation, combined with the findings presented here and the fact that presenilins are required for the proteolytic processing of Notch receptors (21De Strooper B. Annaert W. Cupers P. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Mumm J.S. Schoreter E.H. Schrijvers V. Wolfe M.S. Ray W.J. Goate A. Kopan R. Nature. 1999; 398: 518-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1786) Google Scholar, 22Struhl G. Greenwald I. Nature. 1999; 398: 522-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 23Ye Y. Lukinova N. Fortini M.E. Nature. 1999; 398: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), reveals a complex interplay between mSel-10, Notch, and presenilin, where ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation play a pivotal role. This is outlined in a hypothetical model in Fig.7. Briefly, the levels of mSel-10 are under control of the proteasome in an ubiquitin-dependent manner, and mSel-10 negatively regulates the activity of both Notch IC and presenilins, also in an ubiquitination-dependent fashion. In this model, increased proteasome activity would initially reduce Notch and presenilin activity, but may also lead to a reduction of mSel-10, which could allow Notch and presenilin signaling to increase again. Conversely, under conditions of reduced proteasome activity, more mSel-10 accumulates, which may contribute to the accumulation of ubiquitinated Notch IC, accompanied by the observed reduced HES activation. Furthermore, as presenilins are positive regulators of the intracellular cleavage of the Notch receptor (21De Strooper B. Annaert W. Cupers P. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Mumm J.S. Schoreter E.H. Schrijvers V. Wolfe M.S. Ray W.J. Goate A. Kopan R. Nature. 1999; 398: 518-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1786) Google Scholar, 22Struhl G. Greenwald I. Nature. 1999; 398: 522-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 23Ye Y. Lukinova N. Fortini M.E. Nature. 1999; 398: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), an interesting consequence of the model in Fig. 7 is that mSel-10 could negatively regulate Notch activity in two separate ways: both by its direct action on Notch IC and by reducing cleavage of Notch as a consequence of reducing presenilin levels.2 In conclusion, the data presented here demonstrate that ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation are important mechanisms for controlling activity and turnover of Notch ICs, and that mSel-10 plays a key role in this process.AddendumDuring the course of this work, another report demonstrating that mSel-10 negatively regulates Notch IC was published by Gupta-Rossi et al. (Gupta-Rossi, N., Le Bail, O., Gonen, H., Brou, C., Logeat, F., Six, E., Ciechanover, A., and Israel, A. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, published on line June 25, 2001). The Notch signaling pathway is important for cellular differentiation in many organs and tissues in most, if not all, multicellular species. A Notch receptor is a single transmembrane protein with a large extracellular domain containing multiple epidermal growth factor repeats, and an intracellular domain containing ankyrin repeats and PEST sequence.

The two first cleavages take place at the extracellular side, whereas the third cleavage is controlled by presenilins and occurs in the transmembrane region close to the cytoplasmic side (3Kopan R.

In the case of cdc4p, ubiquitination appears to be carried out by an auto-ubiquitination mechanism (20Zhou P. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 571-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), but whether this is the case also for mSel-10 remains to be established.In addition to the role in Notch IC ubiquitination demonstrated here, mSel-10 also functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase in its interaction with its other target protein, presenilin. 2J. Li, A. Pauley, R. L. Myers, R. Shuang, J. R. Brashler, R. Yan, A. E. Buhl, and M. E. Gurney, submitted for publication. Physical interaction between mSel-10 and presenilin 1 is observed only in the presence of proteasome inhibitors and presenilin is ubiquitinated by mammalian Sel-10.2 This observation, combined with the findings presented here and the fact that presenilins are required for the proteolytic processing of Notch receptors (21De Strooper B. Annaert W. Cupers P. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Mumm J.S. Schoreter E.H. Schrijvers V. Wolfe M.S. Ray W.J. Goate A. Kopan R.

Fortini M.E. Nature. 1999; 398: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), reveals a complex interplay between mSel-10, Notch, and presenilin, where ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation play a pivotal role. This is outlined in a hypothetical model in Fig.7. Briefly, the levels of mSel-10 are under control of the proteasome in an ubiquitin-dependent manner, and mSel-10 negatively regulates the activity of both Notch IC and presenilins, also in an ubiquitination-dependent fashion. In this model, increased proteasome activity would initially reduce Notch and presenilin activity, but may also lead to a reduction of mSel-10, which could allow Notch and presenilin signaling to increase again. Conversely, under conditions of reduced proteasome activity, more mSel-10 accumulates, which may contribute to the accumulation of ubiquitinated Notch IC, accompanied by the observed reduced HES activation. Furthermore, as presenilins are positive regulators of the intracellular cleavage of the Notch receptor (21De Strooper B. Annaert W. Cupers P. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Mumm J.S. Schoreter E.H.

Nature. 1999; 398: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), an interesting consequence of the model in Fig. 7 is that mSel-10 could negatively regulate Notch activity in two separate ways: both by its direct action on Notch IC and by reducing cleavage of Notch as a consequence of reducing presenilin levels.2 In conclusion, the data presented here demonstrate that ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation are important mechanisms for controlling activity and turnover of Notch ICs, and that mSel-10 plays a key role in this process. In this report, we describe the characterization of the mammalian Sel-10 gene and its regulation of Notch signaling. We find that the mouse and human genomes contain one highly conserved sel-10 homolog, and that this is true also for Drosophila. When the sel-10 sequences from C. elegans, Drosophila, and man are compared, some of the most highly conserved regions are the F-box and WD40 repeats, in agreement with a role for mSel-10 as an E3 ubiquitin ligase mSel-10 is predominantly localized to the nucleus and reduces the Notch IC-mediated transcriptional activation from a HES promoter in a presenilin-independent manner. The observed reduction of HES promoter activation at the level of the Notch intracellular domain agrees with genetic findings from C. elegans, where loss of sel-10 rescues a lin-12 (Notch) hypomorph and leads to augmentation of a phenotype caused by overexpression of the lin-12 intracellular domain (10Hubbard E.J.A. Wu G. Kitajewski J. Greenwald I. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3182-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). No role has yet been ascribed to the Drosophila sel-10 homolog, but mutations in the 26 S proteasome subunit inDrosophila lead to increased Notch IC levels (17Schweisguth F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11382-11386Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), indicating that there is a link between Notch IC levels and proteasome function also in Drosophila. We demonstrate that Notch IC is ubiquitinated by mSel-10. Ubiquitination of Notch 1 IC requires the 400 most carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues in Notch 1 IC. Interestingly, this region contains a PEST domain, and PEST domains have in a number of other proteins been shown to play a role in the degradation of the protein (for review, see Ref. 11Ciechanover A. Orian A. Schwartz A.L. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Since the PEST domain is highly conserved in all Notch ICs, and thus likely to be important for function, it is possible that a role for the Notch IC PEST domain is to control mSel-10-mediated ubiquitination-dependent turnover of the Notch IC domain. In addition to mSel-10 one other E3 ubiquitin ligase, Itch, has been shown to ubiquitinate Notch IC (18Qui L. Joazeiro C. Fang N. Wang H.Y. Elly C. Altman Y. Fang D. Hunter T. Liu Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275 (35437): 35734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Itch-mediated ubiquitination of Notch 1 IC in T cells appears not to require the PEST domain (18Qui L. Joazeiro C. Fang N. Wang H.Y. Elly C. Altman Y. Fang D. Hunter T. Liu Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275 (35437): 35734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that ubiquitination of Notch 1 IC by mSel-10 is only observed in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132. This suggests that Notch 1 IC ubiquitinated by mSel-10 is normally rapidly degraded by the proteasome, and therefore does not accumulate in cells where proteasome function is not blocked. It was therefore somewhat unexpected that the total amount of Notch 1 IC was not reduced in cells expressing transfected mSel-10, but this may be a consequence of the large amounts of Notch 1 IC produced after transfection, which may mask a small decrease caused by the increased mSel-10 activity. The finding that Notch 1 IC is ubiquitinated and subjected to proteasome-mediated degradation suggests that the Notch IC is turned over faster than the reminder of the Notch receptor. This provides a plausible explanation to why Notch IC is notoriously difficult to observe after cleavage of the full-length Notch receptor, when the extracellular domain can be detected (19Levitan D. Greenwald I. Development. 1998; 125: 3101-3109PubMed Google Scholar). A rapid turnover of the Notch IC would also alleviate the problem inherent to the Notch receptor mode of signaling,i.e. that Notch IC cannot be controlled by extracellular stimuli after receptor cleavage, which transfers the Notch IC to the nucleus. Rapid degradation of Notch 1 IC by the proteasome would quickly extinguish the transactivation signal in the nucleus if no more Notch receptor was cleaved at the cell surface. The ubiquitination-mediated inactivation of Notch IC signaling may in fact not exclusively depend on the degradation of the Notch IC by the proteasome. The observation that, in the presence of MG132, the levels of Notch 1 IC protein increase at the same time as HES activation is reduced (Fig. 5) may argue that ubiquitinated Notch 1 IC is a less potent transactivator, which would lead to attenuation of Notch signaling already at the stage of Notch IC ubiquitination,i.e. before Notch IC is degraded. We do not yet know whether ubiquitination affects binding of Notch 1 IC to the DNA-binding protein CSL or whether it masks a transactivation domain in Notch 1 IC. We found that mSel-10 protein levels were dramatically increased in the presence of MG132, and that immunoprecipitated mSel-10 was ubiquitinated specifically after addition of MG132. This demonstrates that mSel-10 itself is a target for ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. It is interesting to observe that the E3 ubiquitin ligase cdc4p, which is the protein structurally most closely related to mSel-10 (10Hubbard E.J.A. Wu G. Kitajewski J. Greenwald I.

These PGN-induced mediators can reproduce most of the major clinical manifestations of bacterial infections, including fever, inflammation, leukocytosis, hypotension, decreased peripheral perfusion, malaise, sleepiness, decreased appetite, and arthritis (5Dziarski R.

Academic Press, London2001: 137-153Google Scholar). One of the antimicrobial mechanisms in insects activated by PGN is prophenoloxidase cascade (18Ashida M. Brey P.T. Brey P.T. Hultmark D. Molecular Mechanisms of Immune Responses in Insects. Chapman & Hall, London1997: 135-172Google Scholar). It is present in hemolymph and cuticle and can be initiated by binding of PGN to a 19-kDa protein, peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP) (22Yoshida H. Kinoshita K. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13854-13860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). PGRP from a moth (Trichoplusia ni) and a silkworm (Bombyx mori) have been recently cloned (23Kang D.

Chem. 1999; 274: 11854-11858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Moreover, mouse and human PGRP homologs have been also cloned (23Kang D. Liu G. Lundstrom A. Gelius E. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10078-10082Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), thus demonstrating that this protein has been highly conserved in evolution. Mouse PGRP binds PGN with nanomolar affinity (25Liu C. Gelius E. Liu G. Steiner H. Dziarski R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24490-24499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and mouse and human PGRP are expressed in the bone marrow and neutrophils (23Kang D. Liu G. Lundstrom A. Gelius E. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10078-10082Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 25Liu C. Gelius E. Liu G. Steiner H. Dziarski R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24490-24499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Mouse PGRP inhibits growth of Gram-positive bacteria and, therefore, it is likely to function as an antibacterial protein in neutrophils (25Liu C. Gelius E. Liu G. Steiner H. Dziarski R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24490-24499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Recent data from the Drosophila melanogaster genome project have identified a family of 12 highly diversified PGRP homologs, distributed in eight loci on three chromosomes (26Werner T. Liu G. Kang D. Ekengren S. Steiner H. Hultmark D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13772-13777Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Based on the predicted structures of the gene products, Drosophila PGRPs could be grouped into two classes: short PGRPs (PGRP-S), which are small extracellular proteins similar to the original PGRP, and long PGRPs (PGRP-L), which have long transcripts and are either intracellular or membrane-spanning proteins. Many of theseDrosophila PGRPs are expressed in immune competent organs, such as fat body, gut, and hemocytes, and their expression is up-regulated by injections of PGN (26Werner T. Liu G. Kang D. Ekengren S. Steiner H. Hultmark D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13772-13777Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Thus, these PGRPs are likely to play a role in insect immunity, although their exact function is unknown. The discovery of a PGRP family in Drosophila (26Werner T. Liu G. Kang D. Ekengren S. Steiner H. Hultmark D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13772-13777Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) raised the possibility of the presence of a PGRP family in mammals. Indeed, by searching the human genome, we have identified three new homologs of human PGRP. Here we report cloning of their cDNA, their differential expression in various tissues, and their ability to bind PGN and bacteria. Thus, we have identified a novel human family of four pattern recognition molecules. We identified genes for PGRP-L, PGRP-Iα, and PGRP-Iβ by searching GenBankTM databases for mammalian homologs of human PGRP-S using TBLASTN. PGRP-L gene was found on chromosome 19, between nt 108,186 and 118,938 in the working draft of clone CTB-187L3 (AC011492). PGRP-L had 74% identity with the unpublished cDNA for a mouse protein of unknown function deposited in GenBankTMunder the name TAGL-α (AF149837). Based on this high homology to mouse TAGL-α (mouse PGRP-L) and on the sequences of three overlapping human EST clones (AV655895, AV719476, and BE672960, representing nt 787–1462, 1155–1731, and 1426–1731, respectively, of PGRP-L ORF, we identified five putative exons coding for human PGRP-L. Based on this putative sequence, we designed primers and used PCR (in a GeneAmp 9600 thermocycler, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Norwalk, CT) to amplify a 697-bp fragment (clone L11) from human universal cDNA (first strand cDNA synthesized from poly(A)+ RNA pooled from 37 human tissues CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Clone L11 spanned from nt 763 to 1459 of 1731 bp-long PGRP-L ORF (sense primer, 5′-CCT CGG ACC TTT ACG CTT TTG GAC-3′; antisense primer, 5′-TGT AGT TGC CCA CTA TGG CCA CGC-3′). Using this fragment, we determined that PGRP-L was highly expressed in the liver (see below). We then used human liver cDNA (CLONTECH) and the PCR method to amplify a 1485-bp fragment (clone L62) covering 84% of PGRP-L ORF (exons 1 through 4, nt −26 through 1459, sense primer, 5′-CTT GGA AGC TGG AAT CCT GCA ACA-3′; antisense primer, 5′-TGT AGT TGC CCA CTA TGG CCA CGC-3′). Both PCR fragments were ligated into the pT-Adv vector (CLONTECH). We then used the L11 fragment as a probe to screen bacteriophage λTriplEx human liver cDNA library (CLONTECH). We identified four partial PGRP-L clones (461–632 bp long), which overlapped with clone L62 and coded for exons 3, 4, and 5 and the untranslated sequence from the stop codon to the poly(A) tail. To obtain full-length PGRP-L cDNA, we joined clone L62 (nt −26 through 1459) with one of the clones obtained from screening the λTriplEx liver cDNA library (nt 1137 through the poly(A) tail) by cutting both clones with SmaI at position 1426 and with SacI in the multiple cloning site of both vectors and then religating the two PGRP-L fragments with T4 DNA ligase (27Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). The cloned PGRP-L sequence was identical to the genomic sequence in clone CTB-187L3 (AC011492). The exon/intron junctions were also identical in all our clones and the three EST clones (AV655895,AV719476, and BE672960). We identified nine exons on human chromosome 1, region q21 of the 236c22 BAC clone (AC011666) located between nt 37,034 and 54,835 coding for PGRP-Iβ. The coding sequence of PGRP-Iβ was highly homologous to the unpublished cDNA of Homo sapiens hypothetical protein SBBI67 (AF242518). In the same 236c22 BAC clone, we also identified eight exons coding for another highly homologous protein, PGRP-Iα, located between nt 74,880 and 87,746. Based on the sequences of the putative exons coding for PGRP-Iα and PGRP-Iβ and the putative adjacent 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions, we designed oligonucleotide primers (sense, 5′-CCT CTC TTC CAG GGC TGC CGT C-3′; antisense, 5′-AGG GGG ACA CAA GGT GCT GAG C-3′ for PGRP-Iα; and sense, 5′-ACA GGA CCC ACA GAT ATC TGC TGC CAT C-3′; antisense, 5′-GCT TCT CTC AGT GTT TGA AAT GAG GCC AG-3′ for PGRP-Iβ). We used these primers in PCR reactions to clone full-length cDNAs coding for PGRP-Iα and PGRP-Iβ from human universal cDNA (first strand cDNA synthesized from poly(A)+ RNA pooled from 37 human tissues from CLONTECH). The PCR products were ligated into the pT-Adv vector (CLONTECH), and clones with the proper full-length PGRP-Iα and PGRP-Iβ inserts were selected and identified by restriction digestion and sequencing the inserts. The sequencing revealed that in PGRP-Iα, the putative exon 2, homologous to a similar exon in PGRP-Iβ, was not expressed, which was responsible for the smaller size of PGRP-Iα than PGRP-Iβ (341versus 373 amino acids). In PGRP-Iβ, the first exon was a part of the untranslated 5′ sequence, and the translated protein was coded by eight exons. The ORF in PGRP-Iβ was 12 bp longer than the ORF in SBBI67 (AF242518). The cloned PGRP-Iα and PGRP-Iβ sequences were 100% identical to the genomic sequences in BAC 236c22 (AC011492), except for a difference in two nucleotides (G-275 and C-967) in PGRP-Iβ ORF. PGRP-S cDNA was cloned from human bone marrow cDNA (CLONTECH) by PCR reaction with sense 5′-CAC CAT GTC CCG CCG CTC TAT G-3′ and antisense 5′-GGG GGA GCG GTA GTG TGG CCA A-3′ primers; whose design was based on the published sequence (23Kang D. Liu G. Lundstrom A. Gelius E. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10078-10082Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) (AF076483). The PCR products were ligated into the pcDNA3.1 mammalian expression vector (from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). PGRP-S sequence was identical to the published cDNA and genomic sequence (AF076483 and AC007785). DNA sequencing was performed on an ABI Prism 377XL automated DNA sequencer at the University of Chicago Cancer Center DNA Sequencing Facility (Chicago, IL). Homology searches of GenBankTM databases were performed with the BLASTN and TBLASTN programs. Signal peptides were predicted with the SPScan program (Genetic Computer Group, Madison, WI). Transmembrane domains were predicted with the Swiss TMpred program (ch.embnet.org). Multiple sequence alignments were performed with the ClustalW program using MacVector (Genetic Computer Group). Phylogenetic analysis to construct the best tree with amino acid sequences was performed by the uncorrected neighbor joining method using MacVector program (Genetic Computer Group). Expression of the four PGRPs in 76 different human tissues was analyzed using the Multiple Tissue Expression Array (CLONTECH), which is a nylon membrane with normalized amounts of poly(A)+ RNA from 76 different human tissues immobilized in separate dots, along with several control RNA and DNA. The following PGRP cDNA fragments, purified from agarose gels using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), were labeled with 32P using the random primer labeling method (27Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) and purified on ChromaSpin columns (CLONTECH): for PGRP-L, nt 763 to 1459 (697-bp fragment, clone L11); for PGRP-Iα, nt 596 to 1019 (424-bp PCR fragment); for PGRP-Iβ, EST clone AI056693, corresponding to nt −53 to 418 (459-bp fragment); and for PGRP-S, EST clone AW076051, corresponding to nt 202 to 690 (489-bp fragment). The specific activity of the probes was 1.0–2.6 × 106 dpm/ng. The membranes were hybridized overnight at 65 °C in ExpressHyb solution (CLONTECH), washed at high stringency as recommended by CLONTECH, and exposed to the Kodak X-Omat x-ray film with intensifying screens at −80 °C. The membranes were then stripped and rehybridized with the ubiquitin probe labeled as above (a positive control fromCLONTECH). All the probes were highly specific as they did not cross-hybridize with other members of the PGRP family. Expression of the four PGRPs in six human immune system and 12 human digestive system tissues and estimation of the sizes of their mRNA transcripts were determined using multiple tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) with 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA per lane. 32P-labeled PGRP cDNA fragments (the same as above, except that EST clone BE762960 was used for PGRP-L) were hybridized to the membranes for 2 h at 68 °C in ExpressHyb solution (CLONTECH), washed at high stringency as recommended by CLONTECH, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat x-ray film with intensifying screens at −80 °C. The membranes were then stripped and rehybridized with the β-actin probe labeled as above (a positive control fromCLONTECH). Expression of the four PGRPs in 26 human tissues was also measured by PCR using multiple tissue cDNA panels that contain normalized first-strand cDNA synthesized from DNA-free poly(A)+RNA (from CLONTECH). PCR amplifications were performed with Advantage 2 polymerase (CLONTECH) for 35 cycles under the conditions optimized for each set of primers with the following primers: for PGRP-L, the L11 clone primers (see above); for PGRP-Iα, sense 5′-ATG ATG GCA GGG TGT ATG AAG G-3′, and antisense, 5′-CTT GAA ATG AGG CCA GGT GCT GAT GA-3′, which yield a 749-bp product; for PGRP-Iβ, the same primers as used for cloning, which yield a 1194-bp product; for PGRP-S, sense 5′-ATG TGG TGG TAT CGC ACA CG-3′, antisense, 5′-GTC CTT TGA GCA CAT AGT TG-3′, which yield a 342-bp product; and for human glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), used as a housekeeping gene control, sense, 5′-ACC ACA GTC CAT GCC ATC AC-3′, and antisense, 5′-TCC ACC ACC CTG TTG CTG TA-3′, which yield a 452-bp product (25Liu C. Gelius E. Liu G. Steiner H. Dziarski R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24490-24499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). PCR products were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. The identity of all amplified PCR products was confirmed by Southern blots with the same probes as used for the Multiple Tissue Expression Arrays and also by automated sequencing following extraction of the bands from the agarose gel and purification using QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). The four PGRPs and human CD4 (GenBankTM accession number M12807, a non-PGRP control) were subcloned from the pT-Adv vectors into the pcDNA3.1 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen) and tagged at the C-terminal with the V5 and His6 epitopes using the TOPO directional cloning and the Platinum Pfx polymerase (Life Technologies) as recommended by Invitrogen. The sequences of all clones were confirmed by automated sequencing. Monkey kidney Cos-7 cells and human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells (ATCC), grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum (28Dziarski R. Wang Q. Miyake K. Kirschning C.J. Gupta D. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1938-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), were transfected with 0.4 μg/ml of PGRP or CD4 using LipofectAMINE, as described (28Dziarski R. Wang Q. Miyake K. Kirschning C.J. Gupta D. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1938-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed with 1% Triton X-100 (28Dziarski R. Wang Q. Miyake K. Kirschning C.J. Gupta D. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1938-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and the recombinant proteins were precipitated from the cell lysates with 2.5 μl of Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen), specific for the His6 tag, as described (28Dziarski R. Wang Q. Miyake K. Kirschning C.J. Gupta D. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1938-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The Ni-NTA-bound proteins were separated on 11% PAGE gels and detected on Western blots with anti-V5 mouse monoclonal antibodies (Invitrogen), peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies (from Sigma), and enhanced chemiluminescence as described (28Dziarski R. Wang Q. Miyake K. Kirschning C.J. Gupta D. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1938-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Triton X-100 cell lysates (1 ml) from a 10-cm (Falcon 3003) plate of Cos-7 cells transiently transfected (as described above) with each PGRP or CD4 (a negative control that does not bind PGN) were incubated for 5 to 12 h at 4 °C on a rocking platform with 6.25 μl of control agarose or PGN-agarose (8Dziarski R.

The agarose was sedimented by centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4 °C and washed three times with the cell lysis buffer (except for lysates from PGRP-Iβ-transfected cells, which were washed once). The agarose-bound proteins were released by boiling in a PAGE sample buffer with 1% SDS and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, separated on 11% PAGE gels, and detected on Western blots with anti-V5 mouse monoclonal antibodies, peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies, and enhanced chemiluminescence as described (28Dziarski R. Wang Q. Miyake K. Kirschning C.J. Gupta D. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1938-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Binding of PGRPs to bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, ATCC 6633, and Micrococcus luteus, ATCC 4698) or microgranular cellulose (from Sigma as a negative control) was performed by incubating the cell lysates (as above) with 120 μg of bacteria or cellulose (used instead of the agarose) and then centrifuging the bacteria or cellulose and washing as described above for agarose (25Liu C. Gelius E. Liu G. Steiner H. Dziarski R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24490-24499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The bacteria-bound proteins were released and detected on Western blots as above. By searching GenBankTM databases for mammalian homologs of human PGRP, we have identified three novel human PGRP homologs: one on chromosome 19 and two on chromosome 1 (Fig.1). We have cloned cDNA for these genes using PCR and cDNA library screening. The first gene, located on chromosome 19, has five exons coding for a 576-amino acid protein, which we named PGRP-L (PGRP-long, based on the nomenclature proposed for Drosophila PGRP with long transcripts, Ref. 26Werner T.

These observations coupled with reports that a Neu5Ac-specific lectin can bind toCampylobacter flagellins, have led to the hypothesis that the glycosyl posttranslational modifications on flagellin include Neu5Ac moieties. Although protein glycosylation was previously considered to be restricted to eukaryotes and archaea, there are increasing examples of prokaryotic glycoproteins (14Messner P. Sleytr U.B.

We have undertaken a comprehensive structural analysis of C. jejuniand C. coli flagellin by mass spectrometry and NMR spectrometry to identify the precise nature of these modifications and the potential structural determinants underlying the selective glycosylation of Campylobacter flagellin. Furthermore, we have determined that a gene encoding a protein of unknown function in the C. jejuni genome sequence is involved in biosynthesis of one of the modifications. C. jejuni strains 81–176, NCTC 11168, OH4384 and C. coli strain VC167 T2 have been described previously (9Logan S.M. Trust T.J. Guerry P. J.

Campylobacter strains were grown in Mueller Hinton broth overnight at 37 °C under microaerobic conditions in batches of 1.6 liters. Flagellin was purified by the method of Poweret al. (10Power M.P. Guerry P. McCubbin W.D. Kay C.M. Trust T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3303-3313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 2 mg of flagellin was digested overnight at 37 °C with trypsin (Promega, Madison WI) and subsequently evaporated using a Speedvac preconcentrator. Preparative HPLC1 separations were conducted on a 25 × 1-cm C18 Vydac 218TP510 column (Hisperia, CA) using a gradient of 5–90% aqueous acetonitrile (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) for 30 min. The UV detector was set to 214 nm. Replicate injections of 200 μg each were made on the column, and fractions were collected every 1 min over the course of the gradient elution. For β-elimination experiments, purified tryptic glycopeptides (previously identified by mass spectrometry) were incubated for periods of 6–16 h in a 25% aqueous solution of ammonium hydroxide. Samples were then evaporated to dryness on a Speedvac preconcentrator and reconstituted in water, and remaining salts were removed by passing the solution on a Millipore Ziptip C18(Bedford, MA) and eluting the peptide using 50% aqueous methanol solution (0.2% formic acid). All mass spectra were obtained on a PerkinElmer/Sciex Q-Star mass spectrometer (Concord, ON, Canada) using liquid chromatography Tune and Biomultiview programs for data acquisition and processing, respectively. An HP 1100 liquid chromatograph was coupled to the Q-Star for cLC-MS experiments. Capillary LC separations were conducted with a 15-cm × 0.32-mm Pepmap C18 column (LC Packings, San Francisco, CA) using a linear gradient of 5–95% aqueous acetonitrile (0.2% formic acid) for 30 min. A pre-column flow splitter was mounted before a Rheodyne 8125 injector to provide a column flow rate of 3.5 μl/min. Injections of typically 1 μg of flagellin tryptic digests were made on the capillary column. For conventional mass spectra of intact flagellin, ∼1 μg of purified protein in 0.2% formic acid was flow-injected into a stream of 50% aqueous acetonitrile (0.2% formic acid). The mass spectrometer was set to record the range m/z 1000–2500. During the cLC-ESMS experiments, a stepped orifice voltage ramp was set over two distinct scanning periods (period 1: 1 s, stepped orifice (OR) 100 V m/z 150–400; period 2: 2 s, OR 30 V, m/z 400–1800) for the acquisition of conventional mass spectra. Tandem mass spectrometry experiments were conducted on the Q-Star using a nanoelectrospray interface. HPLC fractions of tryptic glycopeptides before and after β-elimination were loaded in the open end of a nanoelectrospray type A emitter (Micromass, Manchester, UK). Collision-induced dissociation (CID) of selected precursor ions identified in a preliminary survey scan was achieved using nitrogen as the collision gas at collision energies of typically 50–90 eV (laboratory frame of reference). Fragment ions formed in the rf-only quadrupole were recorded by the time of flight mass analyzer. NMR experiments were performed on a Varian INOVA 600 NMR spectrometer with VNMR 6.1B software using a gradient inverse broadband nano-NMR probe at a spin rate of 2600 Hz (23Gilbert M. Brisson J.R.

HPLC-purified samples (200–500 μg) were evaporated on a Speedvac concentrator and redissolved in 40 μl of D2O with no adjustment of pH. NMR experiments were done at 25 °C with the HOD resonance set at 4.77 ppm. All experiments were performed as described before (25Uhrin D. Brisson J.R. Barbotin J.N. Portais J.C.

For the analysis of the NOE data, coordinates for 5-acetamido-7-acetamido-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-l-glycero-α-l-manno-nonulosonic acid were generated using MM3(92) (QCPE) and InsightII (Molecular Simulations Inc.). The dihedral angles about the C6-C7-C8-C9 bonds were based on the major conformers found in solution (26Knirel Y.A. Kocharova N.A. Shashkov A.S. Dmitriev B.A. Kochetkov N.K. Stanislavsky E.S.

The 81–176 homolog of Cj1317 and adjacent DNA was cloned from a λ-ZAP Express library using as probe a polymerase chain reaction product generated from the Cj1317 sequence (22Parkhill J. Wren B.W. Mungall K. Ketley J.M. Churcher C. Basham D. Chillingworth T. Davies R.M. Feltwell T. Holroyd S. Jagels K. Karlyshev A.V. Moule S. Pallen M.J. Penn C.W.

DNA sequencing was done with dye terminator chemistry on an Applied Biosystems Model 373A sequencer. Mutants were constructed using anin vitro Tn5-based transposition system EZ::Tn pMOD (Epicentre, Madison, WI) containing a Campylobacterchloramphenicol (Cmr) resistance gene from pRY109 as previously described (28Guerry P. Ewing C.P. Hickey T.E. Prendergast M.M. Moran A.P. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6656-6662Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The transposon was polymerase chain reaction-amplified with primers specified by Epicentre and used in anin vitro transposition reaction with the target plasmid. The reaction was transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α, and plasmid DNAs from individual transformants were sequenced using primers within the Cmr cassette to determine the insertion point and orientation with respect to the target gene. Insertions into Cj1314c, Cj1315c, Cj1316c, and Cj1317 were electroporated into 81–176 (29Guerry P. Yao R. Alm R.A. Burr D.H. Trust T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 474-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) with selection on Mueller Hinton agar supplemented with 15 μg/ml chloramphenicol under microaerobic conditions. DNAs from individual Cmr colonies were subjected to polymerase chain reaction using primers bracketing the insertion site of each insertion to confirm that the mutated allele had integrated into the 81–176 chromosome by a double crossover. To perform complementation in trans with the Cj1316c mutant, DNA encoding the wild type alleles from plasmid pSG1854 was subcloned from the excision plasmid of λ-ZAP into the kanamycin resistant (Kmr) shuttle plasmid, pRY107 (30Yao R. Alm R.A. Trust T.J. Guerry P. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 130: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), to generate pRY107/1854. The construction was transformed into E. coliDH5α containing plasmid RK212.2 (31Figurski D.H. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (2442) Google Scholar). Plasmid pRY107/1854 was conjugally mobilized by RK212.2 from E. coli into the Cj1316c mutant of 81–176 with selection on Mueller Hinton agar supplemented with 10 μg/ml trimethoprim, 15 μg/ml chloramphenicol , and 25 μg/ml kanamycin. As a control pRY107 was also transferred into the Cj1316c mutant. Motility of mutants was compared with that of wild type on semi-solid (0.4%) Mueller Hinton agar plates as previously described (4Blaser M.J. Duncan D.J. Infect. Immun. 1984; 44: 297-298Crossref Google Scholar). IEF gels were run using ampholytes ranging from 4 to 6 (Biolyte4/6; Bio-Rad) as previously described (8Doig P. Kinsella N. Guerry P. Trust T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). IEF protein markers were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Automated gas-phase amino acid sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) model 491 Procise protein sequencer incorporating a model 140C microgradient system and a 785A programmable absorbance detector. Whole cells of C. jejuni strains were subjected to proteinase K digestion, electrophoresed on 16% Tricine gels (Invitrogen), and stained with silver (Bio-Rad) as described previously (28Guerry P. Ewing C.P. Hickey T.E. Prendergast M.M. Moran A.P. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6656-6662Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Electrospray mass spectrometry experiments on purified flagellin from C. jejuni 81–176 (Fig. 1) indicated that the molecular mass of the monomeric glycoprotein was ∼10% higher than that predicted from the sequence of flaA, 59,240 Da (GenBankTM accession number AF345999). The reconstructed molecular mass profile obtained from the multiply protonated ions observed in the electrospray mass spectrum (Fig. 1,inset) showed two components at 65,766 and 65,841 Da with a broad peak profile of 600–700 Da, possibly reflecting the heterogeneity in the glycoform distribution. It is noteworthy that no peak was observed for the predicted, unmodified FlaA flagellin (59,240 Da), suggesting extensive modification on the protein backbone structure. Mass spectral analyses on flagellin purified from strains NCTC 11168 and OH 4384 also gave broad heterogeneous molecular mass envelopes ranging from 65,600 to 66,400 Da with a few discrete glycoform peaks. Similarly, flagellin obtained from C. coliVC167 T2 exhibited a broad molecular mass distribution extending from 64,500 to 65,400 Da, also showing a 6,000-Da mass excess from the predicted sequence (11Guerry P. Doig P. Alm R.A. Burr D.H. Kinsella N. Trust T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In all the intact C. jejuni andC. coli flagellins examined, the extent of post-translational modifications was substantial, and this resulted in a quantitative incorporation of glycosyl moieties imparting approximately a 10% molecular mass excess on the gene product (see below). To precisely assign the type and location of these post-translational modifications, mass spectral experiments were performed using cLC-ESMS on tryptic peptides derived from purified flagellin. An OR voltage ramp was set over two distinct scanning periods (period 1: 1 s, OR 100 V m/z150–400; period 2: OR 30 V, m/z 400–1800) to identify characteristic oxonium ions (period 1) together with precursor ions from which these specific carbohydrate fragment ions were derived (period 2). Under these conditions, Neu5Ac-containing glycopeptides typically yield an abundant oxonium ion at m/z292. Although this residue was originally suspected as anO-linked glycan, the cLC-ESMS with high/low OR stepping could not unambiguously confirm its presence. Rather, the combined cLC-ESMS analyses revealed the elution of tryptic peptides with unusual modifications as reflected by distinct fragment ions atm/z 317 (dotted line) and 409 (dashed line) obtained from the extracted ion chromatograms shown in Fig. 2 a. The occurrence of these fragment ions (period 1) was used as a diagnostic tool to identify which eluting tryptic glycopeptides observed in the total ion chromatogram (period 2, solid linein Fig. 2a) comprised these unusual modifications. These analyses enabled the identification of at least 7 tryptic glycopeptides, some of which carried multiple modified residues. The number and types of substitution were calculated by comparing the mass of the modified tryptic peptides with those of the expected proteolytic fragments. For example, Fig. 2 b shows the extracted mass spectrum of the peak eluting at 22.2 min in Fig. 2 a. A number of co-eluting components were observed in Fig. 2 b including a triply and doubly charged ions at m/z 838.1 and 1256.6 corresponding to the unmodified tryptic peptide T135–157. However, ions observed atm/z 1055.7 and 1407.6 (circled) could not be matched to any expected tryptic peptides and were associated with a peptide molecule of 4218.9 Da. The inset of Fig.2 b shows the reconstructed molecular mass profile obtained from these ions. The observed mass for this component was in good agreement with that calculated for the modified tryptic peptide T390–412 comprising 3 neutral 316 residues and 2 neutral 408 residues (4219.0 Da). It is noteworthy that the isotopic profile also suggests the occurrence of a related molecular species of 1 Da lower (4218.0 Da), which was later assigned as a substituted analog where one of the 316 Da residues was replaced by a 315-Da monosaccharide (see below). Similarly, the extracted mass spectrum taken at 22.9 min (Fig. 2 c) shows a single component of 2649.3 Da with triply and doubly protonated ions atm/z 884.2 and 1325.7, respectively (circled). The molecular mass of the modified peptide shown in Fig. 2 c corresponded to T200–222, bearing a single neutral 316 residue. It is noteworthy that this peptide also displayed heterogeneity in the incorporation of a modified residue for which an oxonium ion was observed at m/z 316 (corresponding to a neutral 315-Da residue, data not shown) instead ofm/z 317 (corresponding to a 316-Da residue). The nature of the 316-, 315-, and 408-Da substituents was later assigned as pseudaminic acid (Pse5Ac7Ac), its 5-acetamidino analog (Pse5Am7Ac), and 5,7-N-(2,3-dihydroxyproprionyl)-Pse (Pse5Pr7Pr), respectively (see below). HPLC fractions comprising the suspected tryptic glycopeptides were subjected to tandem mass spectrometry analyses to identify structural features that could be assigned to key functional groups of the unusual carbohydrate residues. As an example, the MS-MS spectrum of the [M + 3H]3+ ions previously observed atm/z 884.2 in Fig. 2 c for tryptic peptide T200–222 yielded an intense oxonium ion atm/z 317 together with consecutive peptide bond cleavages resulting in b- and y-type ions (32Roepstorff P. Fohlman J. Biomed. Mass. Spectrom. 1984; 11: 601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2371) Google Scholar) (Fig.3 a). These ions correspond to fragment ions where the charge is retained on the N and C terminus of the peptide backbone. The latter information was consistent with that predicted for the tryptic peptide T200–222 and confirmed the previous assignment. To determine the potential empirical formula of the oxonium fragment ion at m/z 317, accurate mass measurements were obtained using the predictedm/z values of y2 and b4fragment ions. Upon recalibration the mass measurement accuracy across the entire range was within 5 ppm of that calculated for individual b- and y-type fragment ions. Accordingly, the mass of the neutral carbohydrate moiety was determined to be 316.122 ± 0.004 Da. The precision of this measurement eliminated glycerol phosphatidylinositol as a possible substituent (neutral residue mass 316.0559 Da), although previous investigations have reported the occurrence of a related structure α-glycerophosphate as a post-translational modification on Ser residues of Neisseria meningitidis pili (33Stimson E. Virji M. Barker S. Panico M. Blench I. Saunders J.R. Payne G. Moxon E.R. Dell A. Morris H.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Among the different empirical formulas satisfying the defined mass constraints only C13H20O7N2(Mr 316.126) was retained as a plausible candidate. This was also substantiated by the second generation fragment ions of m/z 317 formed by collisional-induced dissociation of the tryptic glycopeptide ions in the orifice/skimmer region of the mass spectrometer (Fig.3 b). The MS-MS spectrum of this unusual carbohydrate residue was characterized by consecutive losses of neutral groups such as water, ketene (CH2CO) and formic acid (HCOOH). These experiments indicated that the glycosyl moiety was a diamino sugar containing an acid group, two N-acetyl functionalities, and a modified C7 side chain. Together with the NMR studies performed on the same HPLC fraction (see below) these data were consistent with a pseudaminic acid (Pse5Ac7Ac), an unusual carbohydrate residue previously found in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of P. aeruginosa (26Knirel Y.A. Kocharova N.A. Shashkov A.S. Dmitriev B.A. Kochetkov N.K. Stanislavsky E.S. Maskell D.J. Mashilova G.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 639-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition to Pse5Ac7Ac, other related structural modifications were also found in C. jejuni flagellin. For example, a second oxonium ion was observed at m/z 316 in a number of peptides from the wild type strain of C. jejuni81–176, including that of glycopeptide T390–412 (Fig.2 b). Second generation fragment ions ofm/z 316 of this tryptic glycopeptide were achieved using higher quadrupole resolution settings to avoid selection of fragment ion m/z 317. The corresponding MS-MS spectrum showed prominent neutral losses of NH3 and CH3CH(NH)(NH2), consistent with the substitution of one of the two acetamido groups of Pse5Ac7Ac by an acetamidino functionality (Fig. 3 c, CH3C(=NH)NH). This substitution resulted in a glycosyl moiety 1 Da lower than that of Pse5Ac7Ac and was termed 5-acetamidino-7-acetamido-Pse (Pse5Am7Ac). The occurrence of side chain fragment ions corresponding to the C1-C9backbone that are common to both Pse5Ac7Ac and Pse5Am7Ac (m/z 134, 180, and 221) suggested that the C5 and not the C7 acetamido group was substituted. Indeed, if the acetamidino group was located on C7, the backbone fragment ion m/z 180 would have been shifted to m/z 179. Confirmation of this assignment using NMR spectroscopy is presently under way, and results from this investigation will be reported separately. This related structure was observed in tryptic glycopeptides T200–220, T390–412, and T423–466, although some heterogeneity in the incorporation level of this residue was noted in these peptides. AnO-acetyl derivative of Pse5Ac7Ac, Pse5Ac7Ac8OAc, was also found in the tryptic glycopeptide T390–422. However, the precise location of this residue could not be established unambiguously due to the presence of other related O-linked sugars on the same peptide. The glycosidic bonds of the tryptic glycopeptides are more labile than peptide bonds, and deglycosylated fragment ions have a structure identical to that of unglycosylated peptide ions, thus preventing the identification of the modification sites. Another common modification encountered in C. jejuni81–176 flagellin was noted previously in Fig. 2 b and corresponded to a neutral residue of an accurate mass measurement of 408.139 ± 0.003 Da. The mass difference between this residue and Pse5Ac7Ac is 92.027 Da, in good agreement with an incremental C2H4O4 moiety. The second generation product ion from m/z 409 (data not shown) was consistent with a substituted Pse5Ac7Ac, whereby the 2N-acetyl groups were replaced by 2N-2,3-dihydroxypropionyl groups (Mr 408.1368) (Pse5Pr7Pr). Although the modified peptides were identified based on mass differences from the predicted sequence, the individual amino acids bearing the modifications were not as readily assigned. The labile nature of the glycosidic bond between the hydroxyl amino acid Ser/Thr and the carbohydrate residue made it difficult to observe fragment ions comprising the intact modification. To unambiguously assign the site of O-linked attachment, purified glycopeptide fractions were subjected to base-catalyzed hydrolysis in the presence of NH4OH whereby the β-elimination product incorporated a newly formed amino group of a distinct mass (34Rademaker G.J. Pergantis S.A. Blok-Tip L. Langridge J.I. Kleen A. Thomas-Oates J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 257: 149-160Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For example, upon β-elimination,O-linked Ser and Thr residues yield modified amino acids of neutral mass of 86 and 100 Da, respectively. This is illustrated in Fig. 4 for the tryptic glycopeptide previously shown in Figs. 2 c and 3 a whereby a total of four potential O-linked sites are present in the proteolytic fragment T200–222. In this particular case, only Ser206 was"

Very recently we found an anandamide-hydrolyzing enzyme, which was catalytically distinct from the previously known anandamide amidohydrolase, in a human megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line (CMK) (36Ueda N. Yamanaka K. Terasawa Y. Yamamoto S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The enzyme showed an optimal pH value at 5 rather than 8.5–10 and was much less sensitive to phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and MAFP. Interestingly,N-palmitoylethanolamine was 1.5-fold more active than anandamide. For further characterization of the enzyme and elucidation of its physiological significance, we attempted to purify the enzyme and examined its tissue distribution. [1-14C]Arachidonic, [1-14C]linoleic, and [1-14C]oleic acids, Phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B, HiTrap Heparin HP, and HiTrap Butyl FF were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and [1-14C]palmitic, [1-14C]stearic, and [1-14C]myristic acids were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Linoleic and oleic acids were from Nu-Chek-Prep (Elysian, MN), stearic and myristic acids and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine were from Sigma, anandamide, N-palmitoylethanolamine, and MAFP were from Cayman Chemical Company (Ann Arbor, MI), sphingosine was from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA), dithiothreitol (DTT) andp-chloromercuribenzoic acid were from Wako Pure Chemical (Osaka, Japan), Triton X-100 and Tween 20 were from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan), CHAPS was from Dojindo (Kumamoto, Japan),n-octyl-β-d-glucoside was from Katayama Chemical (Osaka, Japan), hydroxyapatite Bio-Gel HTP gel and protein assay dye reagent concentrate were from Bio-Rad, and precoated Silica Gel 60 F254 glass plates for thin-layer chromatography (TLC) (20 cm × 20 cm, 0.25-mm thickness) were from Merck. Various N-[1-14C]acylethanolamines were chemically prepared from ethanolamine and [1-14C]fatty acids (37Ueda N. Yamamoto K. Yamamoto S. Tokunaga T. Shirakawa E. Shinkai H. Ogawa M. Sato T. Kudo I. Inoue K. Takizawa H. Nagano T. Hirobe M. Matsuki N. Saito H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1254: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar).N-[14C]Palmitoyl-1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (1,000 cpm/nmol) was prepared from 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine and [14C]palmitic acid according to the method of Schmidet al. (38Schmid P.C. Reddy P.V. Natarajan V. Schmid H.H.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9302-9306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the synthesis of [14C]ceramide (N-oleoylsphingosine), [14C]oleic acid (1,000 cpm/nmol) was converted to [14C]oleoyl chloride using oxalyl chloride. The produced [14C]oleoyl chloride (0.9 equivalent) was then incubated with sphingosine (1.0 equivalent) in methylene chloride containing triethylamine (1.0 equivalent) at room temperature for 30 min. The synthesizedN-[14C]palmitoyl-1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine and [14C]ceramide were purified by preparative TLC. Male Wistar rats (220–280-g weight; Clea Japan or Charles River Japan) were anesthetized by diethyl ether and sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Various organs were removed and homogenized in 9 times the volume (v/w) of ice-cold 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.32 msucrose with a Polytron homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 800 × g for 15 min and at 12,000 ×g for 30 min, successively. The 12,000 × gpellet was suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and subjected to two cycles of freezing and thawing. The sample was then centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 50 min. The resultant supernatant was used as the solubilized enzyme. The samples thus prepared were stored at −80 °C until use. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217399) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Macrophages were obtained from the peritoneal cavity of male Wistar rats (500–600-g body weight) and were plated on plastic dishes. The adherent cells were used as peritoneal resident macrophages. Alveolar macrophages were obtained from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of rat lung. The macrophages were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and subjected to sonic disruption. The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min. Solubilization of the enzyme from the 12,000 × g pellet was performed as described above. Recombinant rat anandamide amidohydrolase was overexpressed in a baculovirus-Sf9 insect cell system (35Katayama K. Ueda N. Katoh I. Yamamoto S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1440: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and the particulate fraction of the transfected Sf9 cells was used for enzyme assay. The enzyme was incubated with 100 μm [14C]N-palmitoylethanolamine (10,000 cpm in 10 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide) at 37 °C for 30 min in 100 μl of 50 mm citrate-sodium phosphate (pH 5.0) containing 3 mm DTT and 0.1% Triton X-100. The reaction was terminated by addition of 0.35 ml of a mixture of diethyl ether/methanol/1 m citric acid (30:4:1, v/v). The ethereal extract was spotted on a Silica Gel 60 F254 glass plate (10-cm height) and subjected to TLC with a mixture of chloroform/methanol/25% ammonium hydroxide (80:20:2, v/v) for 20 min at 4 °C. Radioactivity on the plate was scanned with a BAS 2000 bioimaging analyzer (Fujix, Tokyo, Japan). Assays were performed in triplicate. For the ceramidase assay (40Gatt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3724-3730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the enzyme was incubated with 100 μm [14C]ceramide (10,000 cpm) at 37 °C for 30 min in a 100-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mmcitrate-sodium phosphate (pH 5.0), 0.1% sodium cholate, and 0.05% Triton X-100. The produced [14C]oleic acid and the remaining [14C]ceramide were extracted with 300 μl of a mixture of chloroform and methanol (2:1, v/v) and separated by TLC using a mixture of chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (94:1:5, v/v) for 20 min at room temperature. The activity of the phosphodiesterase hydrolyzingN-[14C]palmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine was measured as described (41Ueda N. Liu Q. Yamanaka K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1532: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The solubilized protein of lung (160 mg of protein in 100 ml) was adjusted to pH 4 with HCl and kept at 4 °C for 1 h. Resultant-insoluble proteins were removed by centrifugation at 260,000 × g for 40 min. The supernatant was further kept at 4 °C overnight and was subjected to centrifugation again. The supernatant (10 ml) was then loaded onto Phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B (1-ml bed volume) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). After the column was washed with 10 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), adsorbed proteins were eluted in 1.0-ml fractions with 1% octyl glucoside. This chromatography was performed 10 times using 100 ml of the sample in total, and all the active fractions were pooled. The sample was then loaded on a HiTrap Heparin column (1-ml bed volume) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1% octyl glucoside. The flow-through fraction was applied onto a hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Gel HTP; 1-ml bed volume) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). After washing the column with 5 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), the enzyme was eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 10 mm sodium phosphate. The enzyme was finally loaded onto a HiTrap Butyl FF (1-ml bed volume) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1 m ammonium sulfate. After the column was washed with 6 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1m ammonium sulfate, 6 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.1 m ammonium sulfate and 1 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), the enzyme was eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1% octyl glucoside. The soluble fractions prepared by freezing and thawing from the 12,000 × g pellet of various rat organs were assayed for theN-palmitoylethanolamine-hydrolyzing activity. To rule out a possible contribution of the contaminated membrane-bound anandamide amidohydrolase, we pretreated the enzyme preparation with 1 μm MAFP, which almost completely inhibited theN-palmitoylethanolamine hydrolysis catalyzed by anandamide amidohydrolase as shown later in Fig. 4 B. The results revealed a wide distribution of the MAFP-insensitive enzyme (Fig.1). The highest activity was observed in lung with a specific activity of 7.1 nmol/min/mg protein at 37 °C, followed by spleen, small intestine, thymus, and cecum. The other organs tested showed lower activities. The radioactive product was identified as [14C]palmitic acid by TLC using four different solvent systems. It was likely that the enzyme was derived from blood cells contained in the organs. However, the removal of blood from the lung by the perfusion with saline did not decrease the specific enzyme activity. Furthermore, the leukocyte-rich fraction of rat blood cells showed a low activity (about 0.3 nmol/min/mg protein), and the platelet-rich fraction was almost inactive. Interestingly, we detected a high activity in the solubilized proteins from alveolar macrophages (13.1 ± 1.9 nmol/min/mg protein; n = 3) and peritoneal macrophages (19.6 ± 0.8 nmol/min/mg protein;n = 3).Figure 1Distribution of theN-palmitoylethanolamine hydrolysis activity in rat organs. The solubilized enzyme (10 μg of protein) from each rat organ was allowed to react with 100 μm[14C]N-palmitoylethanolamine at pH 5 in the presence of 1 μm MAFP.

As shown in Table I, 46% of the total activity was recovered in the 12,000 × g pellet, which showed the highest specific activity. When the enzyme was solubilized from the 12,000 × g pellet by two cycles of freezing and thawing without detergent, the yield through this step was 174%, suggesting the presence of endogenous inhibitors for the enzyme in the 12,000 × g pellet. The specific enzyme activity increased 10-fold by the solubilization. The heat-treated enzyme was totally inactive.Table ISubcellular distribution of the N-palmitoylethanolamine hydrolysis activity in rat lungTotal activitySpecific activitynmol/min (%)nmol/min/mg proteinHomogenate293 ± 7 (100)0.13 ± 0800 × g pellet59 ± 2 (20)0.11 ± 012,000 × g pellet136 ± 3 (46)0.47 ± 0.01105,000 × g pellet12 ± 0 (4)0.06 ± 0105,000 × gsupernatant46 ± 2 (16)0.05 ± 0Soluble fraction after freezing and thawing1-aThe 12,000 ×g pellet was suspended in phosphate-buffered saline, subjected to two cycles of freezing and thawing, and centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 50 min.236 ± 18 (81)4.90 ± 0.38Insoluble fraction after freezing and thawing1-aThe 12,000 ×g pellet was suspended in phosphate-buffered saline, subjected to two cycles of freezing and thawing, and centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 50 min.18 ± 1 (6)0.12 ± 0.01The homogenate of rat lung (2.22 g of protein) was subjected to subcellular fractionation.

Open table in a new tab The homogenate of rat lung (2.22 g of protein) was subjected to subcellular fractionation.

The reaction rate of the solubilized enzyme increased depending on the concentrations of N-palmitoylethanolamine, and the apparentK m value was about 35 μm (Fig.2). When the pH value was changed between 3 and 11, the activity was the highest at pH 5.0 and was hardly detectable above pH 8 (Fig. 3). At pH 7.0, the activity was considerably higher with Tris-HCl than with citrate-sodium phosphate. The recombinant rat anandamide amidohydrolase showed the highest activity at pH 9 withN-palmitoylethanolamine as substrate under the same assay conditions (Fig. 3).Figure 3pH dependence of the enzymaticN-palmitoylethanolamine hydrolysis. The solubilized lung enzyme (solid line; 16.5 μg of protein) or the particulate fraction of Sf9 cells expressing anandamide amidohydrolase (broken line; 0.38 μg of protein) was allowed to react with 100 μm[14C]N-palmitoylethanolamine at the indicated pH value. The pH value was adjusted with the following buffers (50 mm): citrate-Na2HPO4 (closed circles), Tris-HCl (open circles), Na2CO3-NaHCO3 (closed triangles). The highest activities were considered as 100% as follows: the solubilized lung enzyme (pH 5.0), 5.6 nmol/min/mg protein; the recombinant anandamide amidohydrolase (pH 9.0), 316 nmol/min/mg protein. Mean values ± S.D. are shown (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The addition of DTT increased the enzyme activity dosedependently up to 6-fold (Fig.4 A). Other sulfhydryl-reducing agents (2-mercaptoethanol, glutathione, and cysteine) showed weakly stimulatory effects. In accordance with this finding, the activity was inhibited almost completely by low concentrations of sulfhydryl blockers, namely 10 μm p-chloromercuribenzoic acid and 20 μmHgCl2. The lung enzyme was hardly inhibited by MAFP at least up to 10 μm, whereas MAFP inhibitedN-palmitoylethanolamine-hydrolyzing activity of recombinant anandamide amidohydrolase with an IC50 of 30 nm (Fig. 4 B). We also examined the effect of several detergents on theN-palmitoylethanolamine hydrolysis by the lung enzyme (Fig. 4 C). Triton X-100 increased the enzyme activity 7-fold at maximum. The reaction rate was the highest in the presence of 0.1–0.3% of Triton X-100. Interestingly, Tween 20 acted as a potent inhibitor. The enzyme was little affected by CHAPS or octyl glucoside. The enzymes prepared from peritoneal and alveolar macrophages were also characterized (Fig. 5). The enzymes were almost inactive at pH 9 and were only slightly affected by 1 μm MAFP. When DTT or Triton X-100 was removed from the standard reaction mixture, the enzyme activity was markedly reduced. Furthermore, the enzymes were much less active with anandamide. These results strongly suggest that the macrophage enzyme is identical to the lung enzyme. Because acid ceramidase is an amidase hydrolyzing ceramide (N-acylsphingosine) with an optimal pH value around 5 (40Gatt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3724-3730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was likely that the N-palmitoylethanolamine-hydrolyzing activity was attributable to this enzyme. When the solubilized lung enzyme (7.1 nmol/min/mg protein with N-palmitoylethanolamine as substrate) was incubated with [14C]ceramide (N-oleoylsphingosine) at pH 5, a low ceramidase activity was observed (specific activity, 0.17 ± 0.01 nmol/min/mg protein at 37 °C; n = 3). However, the solubilized enzymes from the other organs, which were used for the experiment of Fig. 1, also showed a ceramidase activity with specific activities of 0.38 ± 0.01 nmol/min/mg protein (brain), 0.28 ± 0.01 (liver), 0.25 ± 0 (submaxillary gland), 0.24 ± 0.01 (kidney), 0.20 ± 0.01 (small intestine), 0.10 ± 0 (stomach), 0.08 ± 0 (spleen), 0.08 ± 0.01 (testis), 0.08 ± 0.01 (cecum), 0.03 ± 0 (thymus), 0.02 ± 0.01 (large intestine), and 0.01 ± 0 (heart), respectively (n = 3). Thus, the organ distribution of acid ceramidase was different from that of theN-palmitoylethanolamine hydrolysis activity. In an attempt to purify the enzyme, the solubilized lung enzyme was subjected sequentially to acid treatment and chromatographies using Phenyl-Sepharose, HiTrap Heparin, Hydroxyapatite, and HiTrap Butyl as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Through this procedure the specific enzyme activity was increased 310-fold from 5.9 nmol/min/mg protein to 1.8 μmol/min/mg protein. The yield was 0.5% starting from the solubilized protein. The purified enzyme preparation gave a major protein band around 31 kDa as analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.6). The purified enzyme was allowed to react with various ethanolamides of long-chain fatty acids (Fig. 7). In the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100, N-palmitoylethanolamine was found to be the best substrate for the lung enzyme. Relative reactivity was as follows: N-palmitoylethanolamine, 100%;N-myristoylethanolamine, 48%;N-stearoylethanolamine, 21%;N-oleoylethanolamine, 20%;N-linoleoylethanolamine, 13%;N-arachidonoylethanolamine (anandamide), 8%. When Triton X-100 was removed from the assay mixture, the reactivity with all the ethanolamides of saturated fatty acids was decreased to negligible levels (Fig. 7). In contrast, considerable reactivities with the ethanolamides of unsaturated fatty acids were observed in the absence of Triton X-100. The purified enzyme also required DTT for its full activity, was inactive at pH 9, and was insensitive to 1 μm MAFP. Oleamide (30Cravatt B.F. Giang D.K. Mayfield S.P. Boger D.L. Lerner R.A. Gilula N.B. Nature. 1996; 384: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1805) Google Scholar), 2-arachidonoylglycerol (42Goparaju S.K. Ueda N. Yamaguchi H. Yamamoto S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), and methyl arachidonate (43Kurahashi Y. Ueda N. Suzuki H. Suzuki M. Yamamoto S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 512-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) were reported to be good substrates of anandamide amidohydrolase. However, the lung enzyme hydrolyzed oleamide only at a low rate (12% of the N-palmitoylethanolamine hydrolysis), and 2-arachidonoylglycerol and methyl arachidonate were almost inactive with this enzyme. The reverse reaction, namely the condensation of 100 μm [14C]palmitic acid with 250 mm ethanolamine to formN-palmitoylethanolamine, occurred at only about 2% of the rate of the N-palmitoylethanolamine hydrolysis. The purified enzyme still showed a ceramidase activity (38 nmol/min/mg protein), which corresponded to about 3% of theN-palmitoylethanolamine hydrolase activity. However, DTT hardly affected the ceramidase activity, and the activity at pH 9 was as high as that at pH 5. Moreover, because a stimulatory effect of Triton X-100 was also reported for a phosphodiesterase hydrolyzingN-acylphosphatidylethanolamine toN-acylethanolamine and phosphatidic acid (38Schmid P.C. Reddy P.V. Natarajan V. Schmid H.H.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9302-9306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Ueda N. Liu Q. Yamanaka K. Biochim. Biophys.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we examined whether the purified enzyme possesses the phosphodiesterase activity. However, the production ofN-[14C]palmitoylethanolamine fromN-[14C]palmitoyl-1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine was not observed with the purified enzyme. The phosphodiesterase partially purified from rat heart (41Ueda N. Liu Q. Yamanaka K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1532: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) was used as a positive control in this assay. Biological functions of N-acylethanolamines are currently the subjects of active investigations,e.g. anandamide as a cannabimimetic compound (2Di Marzo V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1392: 153-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) and N-palmitoylethanolamine as an anti-inflammatory compound (14Schmid H.H.O. Schmid P.C. Natarajan V. Prog. Lipid Res. 1990; 29: 1-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 25Lambert D.M. Di Marzo V. Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 757-773PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymatic hydrolysis of these N-acylethanolamines has been observed in a variety of mammalian organs and cell lines and attributed mostly to an enzyme termed as anandamide amidohydrolase (31Katayama K. Ueda N. Kurahashi Y. Suzuki H. Yamamoto S. Kato I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1347: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar,45Bisogno T. Katayama K. Melck D. Ueda N. De Petrocellis L. Yamamoto S. Di Marzo V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 634-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As presented in this study, we isolated and purified for the first time an N-acylethanolamine hydrolase that hydrolyzesN-palmitoylethanolamine actively and is distinct from the previously known anandamide amidohydrolase. The enzyme was distributed widely in various mammalian organs and could be efficiently solubilized from the 12,000 × g pellet of the homogenate of rat lung by freezing and thawing without detergent. The enzyme activity was the highest at pH 5, increased by DTT, and hardly inhibited by 10 μm MAFP. These catalytic properties were similar to those of the hydrolase, which we recently found in a human megakaryoblastic cell line (CMK), and were clearly distinguished from the properties of anandamide amidohydrolase, which has an optimal pH at 8.5–10, is not activated by DTT, and is inhibited completely by 1 μmMAFP (36Ueda N. Yamanaka K. Terasawa Y. Yamamoto S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the molecular mass of the enzyme purified from rat lung was estimated as 31 kDa. This value was different from that of anandamide amidohydrolase (about 63 kDa) (30Cravatt B.F. Giang D.K. Mayfield S.P. Boger D.L. Lerner R.A. Gilula N.B. Nature. 1996; 384: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1805) Google Scholar). Substrate specificity was also different between this new enzyme and anandamide amidohydrolase. Among the testedN-acylethanolamines, the lung enzyme was the most active with N-palmitoylethanolamine.N-Palmitoylethanolamine was hydrolyzed 13 times faster than anandamide. This substrate specificity was in contrast with that of anandamide amidohydrolase, which prefers anandamide toN-palmitoylethanolamine (9Bisogno T. Maurelli S. Melck D. De Petrocellis L. Di Marzo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3315-3323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 28Desarnaud F. Cadas H. Piomelli D. J. Biol.

Acta. 1999; 1440: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, we refer to the enzyme with higher reactivity forN-palmitoylethanolamine asN-palmitoylethanolamine hydrolase. The difference in substrate specificity between the two enzymes suggests that anandamide and N-palmitoylethanolamine are degraded in different manners in vivo. In addition, anandamide amidohydrolase was reported to have a high esterase activity for 2-arachidonoylglycerol (42Goparaju S.K. Ueda N. Yamaguchi H. Yamamoto S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) and methyl arachidonate (43Kurahashi Y. Ueda N. Suzuki H. Suzuki M. Yamamoto S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 512-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), whereas these compounds were almost inactive with the lung enzyme. Furthermore, we should note that the distribution of the new enzyme in rat organs is considerably different from that of anandamide amidohydrolase. Namely, the former enzyme is abundant in lung, spleen, small intestine, thymus, and cecum, but shows low activities in liver and brain (Fig. 1) whereas the latter enzyme is highly expressed in liver, small intestine, brain, and testis (26Schmid P.C. Zuzarte-Augustin M.L. Schmid H.H.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14145-14149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Desarnaud F. Cadas H. Piomelli D. J. Biol.

Acta. 1997; 1347: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The different distribution of the two enzymes may reflect their different physiological roles. The abundance of the new enzyme in the organs related to immune system is interesting in the light of anti-inflammatory activity of N-palmitoylethanolamine (14Schmid H.H.O. Schmid P.C. Natarajan V. Prog. Lipid Res. 1990; 29: 1-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 15Facci L. Dal Toso R. Romanello S. Buriani A. Skaper S.D. Leon A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In relation to this unique organ distribution, we found a high activity of the enzyme in alveolar and peritoneal resident macrophages. Therefore, the enzyme found in lung and immune organs may be derived at least in part from the resident macrophages of each organ. It is known that a large amount ofN-acylethanolamine, especiallyN-palmitoylethanolamine, is produced in degenerating tissues (4Epps D.E. Schmid P.C. Natarajan V. Schmid H.H.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 90: 628-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 5Schmid P.C. Krebsbach R.L. Perry S.R. Dettmer T.M. Maasson J.L. Schmid H.H.O.

Acta. 1995; 1258: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The enzyme of macrophages may be responsible for the degradation of N-acylethanolamines in the degenerating tissues. N-Palmitoylethanolamine, together with smaller amounts of other N-acylethanolamines, was also found in mouse peritoneal macrophages (8Schmid P.C. Kuwae T. Krebsbach R.J. Schmid H.H.O. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1997; 87: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The enzyme activity with ethanolamides of saturated fatty acids, but not with ethanolamides of unsaturated fatty acids, was increased by Triton X-100. Such different effects of Triton X-100 on the reactivity with different substrates may be explained in terms of solubility of the substrates. It was discussed previously that low solubility ofN-palmitoylethanolamine compared with anandamide may cause a low affinity for anandamide amidohydrolase (25Lambert D.M. Di Marzo V. Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 757-773PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, an appropriate concentration of Triton X-100 may enhance the solubility ofN-palmitoylethanolamine and hence its affinity for the enzyme. Interestingly, only Triton X-100 stimulated theN-palmitoylethanolamine hydrolysis among the detergents tested. As reported earlier, ceramidase was inhibited byN-oleoylethanolamine (46Sugita M. Williams M. Dulaney J.T. Moser H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 398: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Because acid ceramidase shows optimal pH around 5, a possibility could not be ruled out that the N-palmitoylethanolamine-hydrolyzing activity was derived from acid ceramidase. Our results clearly showed a different organ distribution between the two enzymes. Previously, Spence et al. (47Spence M.W. Beed S. Cook H.W. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1986; 64: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) also measured the ceramidase activity at pH 5 in the homogenates of various rat organs and showed that the specific activity was higher in the order of kidney > brain stem > cerebrum > cerebellum > liver > spleen > cardiac muscle > lung > psoas muscle (47Spence M.W. Beed S. Cook H.W. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1986; 64: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the molecular mass of the previously reported acid ceramidase (13- and 40-kDa subunits) (48Koch J. Gartner S. Li C.-M. Quintern L.E. Bernardo K. Levran O. Schnabel D. Desnick R.J. Schuchman E.H. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33110-33115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) was different from that of our enzyme (31 kDa). Our purified enzyme still showed a low but detectable ceramidase activity (about 3% of theN-palmitoylethanolamine hydrolase activity). Therefore, the enzyme may also act as a ceramidase that is different from the known acid ceramidase. However, the contamination of ceramidase in the final preparation could not be rigorously ruled out. In summary, we purified and characterizedN-palmitoylethanolamine hydrolase as a catalytically distinct enzyme from the previously known anandamide amidohydrolase and revealed the expression of the enzyme in a variety of rat organs and macrophages. The presence of a hydrolase withN-palmitoylethanolamine as a predominant substrate suggests a physiological or pathophysiological role of this compound.

As expected, incubation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected THP-1 cells or human peripheral blood, monocyte-derived macrophages with hormone resulted in the induction of antimycobacterial activity. This effect was significantly abrogated by pretreatment of cells with either of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) inhibitors, wortmannin or LY294002, or with antisense oligonucleotides to the p110 subunit of PI 3-Kα. Cells infected with M. tuberculosisalone or incubated with D3 alone produced little or undetectable amounts of superoxide anion (O⨪2). In contrast, exposure of M. tuberculosis-infected cells to D3 led to significant production of O⨪2, and this response was eliminated by either wortmannin, LY294002, or p110 antisense oligonucleotides. As was observed for PI 3-K inactivation, the reactive oxygen intermediate scavenger, 4-hydroxy-TEMPO, and degradative enzymes, polyethylene glycol coupled to either superoxide dismutase or catalase, also abrogated D3-induced antimycobacterial activity. Superoxide production by THP-1 cells in response to D3 required prior infection with liveM. tuberculosis, since exposure of cells to either killed M. tuberculosis or latex beads did not prime for an oxidative burst in response to subsequent hormone treatment. Consistent with these findings, redistribution of the cytosolic oxidase components p47phox and p67phox to the membrane fraction was observed in cells incubated with liveM. tuberculosis and D3 but not in response to combined treatment with heat-killed M. tuberculosis followed by D3. Redistribution of p47phox and p67phox to the membrane fraction in response to live M. tuberculosis and D3 was also abrogated under conditions where PI 3-K was inactivated. Taken together, these results indicate that D3-induced, human monocyte antimycobacterial activity is regulated by PI 3-K and mediated by the NADPH-dependent phagocyte oxidase.

Current estimates are that one-third of the world's population is infected with the etiological agentMycobacterium tuberculosis (1Kaufmann S.H. van Embden J.D. Trends Microbiol. 1993; 1: 2-5Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and that the incidence of new cases with active disease is anticipated to rise from the current 7 million per year to 10 million per year by 2015 (2Day M. New Sci. 1998; 2127: 21Google Scholar). These statistics highlight the importance of developing new, more effective anti-tuberculous drugs, an effort dependent on acquiring more insights into host-pathogen interactions that determine the outcome of infection. M. tuberculosis primarily infects mononuclear phagocytes, where it resides and multiplies within a host-derived phagosome (3Armstrong J.A. Hart P.D. J. Exp. Med. 1975; 142: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Its success as a pathogen is largely attributable to its ability to evade or resist the multiplicity of antimicrobial mechanisms available to this host cell. The macrophage is not only the primary site for M. tuberculosis growth but also ordinarily provides the primary line of host defense against invading pathogens in its role as an effector of innate immunity. Macrophages use varied strategies to kill and destroy invading organisms, including production of reactive nitrogen and oxygen intermediates, phagosome maturation and acidification, fusion with lysosomes, exposure to defensins and host cell apoptosis (4Hingley-Wilson S.M. Sly L.M. Reiner N.E. McMaster W.R. Mod. Aspects Immunobiol. 2000; 1: 96-101Google Scholar). Augmentation of any of these processes during macrophage activation may contribute to control of disease. Vitamin D3 is a steroid hormone that regulates several cellular and physiological responses. The classical mechanism of action of D31 involves genomic signaling where hormone binds to the vitamin D receptor (VDR), a ligand-dependent transcription factor. The D3·VDR complex then translocates to the nucleus, where it directly regulates transcription by binding to the vitamin D response element consensus sequence located upstream of D3-activated genes (5Malloy P.J. Feldman D. Am. J. Med. 1999; 106: 355-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Recently, nongenomic signaling in response to D3 (i.e. cellular responses brought about independent of de novo transcription from a classical vitamin D response element) has been recognized to regulate important cellular processes (6Hmama Z.

Vitamin D3 is known to possess a variety of immunomodulatory properties including effects on both myeloid and lymphoid cells (11Manolagas S.C. Hustmyer F.G. Yu X.P. Kidney Int. Suppl. 1990; 29: 9-16PubMed Google Scholar). Among these are its ability to induce the differentiation of immature myeloid cells into more mature monocytes and macrophages (12Abe E. Miyaura C.

Several lines of evidence indicate that D3 regulates host resistance to M. tuberculosis. D3 deficiency and vitamin D receptor polymorphisms have been linked to increased susceptibility toM. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae (17Davies P.D. Tubercle. 1985; 66: 301-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 18Roy S. Frodsham A. Saha B. Hazra S.K. Mascie-Taylor C.G. Hill A.V. J. Infect.

In this regard, D3 productionin vivo is promoted by exposure to ultraviolet light, and this may provide a link between exposure to sunlight and antimycobacterial resistance mechanisms (17Davies P.D.

In addition, D3 has been shown to activate mononuclear phagocyte antimycobacterial activity (20Crowle A.J. Ross E.J. May M.H. Infect.

Until now, the molecular basis through which D3 regulates host resistance to M. tuberculosis has not been identified. Class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) is a lipid kinase that phosphorylates the 3′-position of the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol (PI) and its derivatives. It is composed of an 85-kDa Src homology 2 domain containing regulatory subunit (p85) and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit (p110). It is a multifunctional signaling molecule that has been implicated in a wide range of cellular processes including nuclear signaling, vesicle transport, organization of the cytoskeleton, cell growth, transformation, and survival (22Fry M.J.

It was recently found that PI 3-K is required for D3-induced cell differentiation in the human macrophage cell lines THP-1 and U937 and in peripheral blood monocytes (6Hmama Z. Nandan D. Sly L. Knutson K.L. Herrera-Velit P. Reiner N.E. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1583-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In the latter study, vitamin D3 was observed to activate PI 3-K, and D3-induced expression of the monocyte differentiation markers, CD14 and CD11b, required PI 3-K. Furthermore, D3treatment induced the formation of a vitamin D receptor·PI 3-K complex, representing a novel nongenomic signaling pathway activated by D3. In light of these results, this study examined whether PI 3-K is involved in regulating D3-induced antimycobacterial activity and investigated the mechanistic basis for this effector function. The results obtained show that D3-induced monocyte resistance to M. tuberculosis is regulated by PI 3-K and that this effect is due to activation of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. RPMI 1640 and HBSS were from Stem Cell Technologies (Vancouver, Canada). Wortmannin, LY294002,l-NMMA, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, 1α-hydroxyvitamin D3, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 were from Calbiochem.l-α-Phosphatidylinositol, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, pepstatin A, aprotonin, microcystin, vanadate, ferricytochrome c, superoxide dismutase, latex beads, 4-hydroxy-TEMPO, PEG-catalase, and PEG-superoxide dismutase were from Sigma. Protein A-agarose, Griess reagent, and electrophoresis reagents were from Bio-Rad. [γ-32P]ATP was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotides were synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. Mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan was provided by D. John T. Belisle. Mouse monoclonal anti-p85 UB93–3 was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Mouse monoclonal anti-p110α was from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-p47phoxand anti-p67phox antibodies were prepared as described previously (25Allen L.A. DeLeo F.R. Gallois A. Toyoshima S. Suzuki K. Nauseef W.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 3521-3530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The human promonocytic cell line THP-1 and murine macrophage-like cell line RAW264.7 were from the American Type Culture Collection. Cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone), 2 mml-glutamine and maintained between 2 and 10 × 105 cells/ml. The human myeloid cell line THP-1 was used as a model for M. tuberculosis infection studies because of its similarity to human MDM (26Stokes R.W. Doxsee D. Cell. Immunol. 1999; 197: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) in M. tuberculosis infection models and its availability for use. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated as described previously (27Liu M.K. Herrera-Velit P. Brownsey R.W. Reiner N.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2642-2652PubMed Google Scholar). Mononuclear cells were allowed to adhere for 45 min at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Nonadherent cells were removed with three washes with HBSS. Adherent cells were maintained for 3 days at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 prior to use for infections or treatments. A virulent strain of M. tuberculosis (H37Rv) was grown to late log phase in Middlebrook 7H9 with OADC (Difco). Aliquots were frozen at −70 °C, and representative samples were thawed and evaluated for colony-forming units (CFUs) on Middlebrook 7H10 agar with OADC (Difco Laboratories). Heat-killed bacteria were prepared by heating at 80 °C for 2 h. Formaldehyde-fixed bacteria were prepared by fixation in 30% formaldehyde in methanol for 30 min. UV-irradiated bacteria were prepared by UV irradiation for 16 h. Each treatment reduced the viability of M. tuberculosis by greater than 5 logs. Cells were infected as described previously (28Hmama Z. Gabathuler R. Jefferies W.A. de Jong G. Reiner N.E. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4882-4893PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, prior to infection, THP-1 cells were seeded at a density of 105/cm2 in either six-well flat bottom or 10-cm diameter tissue culture plates (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and allowed to adhere and differentiate in the presence of 20 ng/ml PMA at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere for 24 h. Cells were washed, and medium without PMA was replenished 4 h prior to the addition of bacteria. Prior to infection, bacteria were opsonized with fresh serum as described previously (28Hmama Z. Gabathuler R. Jefferies W.A. de Jong G. Reiner N.E. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4882-4893PubMed Google Scholar). Monolayers were infected with opsonized M. tuberculosis at a 50:1 ratio. Latex beads were opsonized as for M. tuberculosis and incubated with cells at a ratio of 20:1. After 4 h, noningested bacilli or beads were removed by washing three times with HBSS, and medium was replenished. This resulted in infection of 80–90% of cells with 1–5 bacteria/cell. Infection was evaluated by Kinyoun staining (BBL Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, MD). For latex beads, ∼90% of cells contained beads with 1–7 beads per cell. Immediately after infection, macrophages were treated with inhibitors at final concentrations as follows: LY, 14 μm; Wm, 50 nm, and l-NMMA, 8 μm. Cells were incubated with these inhibitors for 15 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2 prior to the addition of D3. 4-Hydroxy-TEMPO (0.1 mm), PEG-SOD (100 units/ml), or PEG-cat (100 units/ml) were added during the 4-h infection, and reagents remaining in the culture medium were washed away from treated cells along with noningested bacteria. Heat-inactivated PEG-SOD and PEG-cat were used as negative controls for the active enzymes. Vitamin D3 (1 μm) was added to monolayers after treatment with inhibitors and was left in the medium for the remainder of the experiment. In vitro PI 3-K assays were performed as described previously (6Hmama Z. Nandan D. Sly L. Knutson K.L. Herrera-Velit P. Reiner N.E. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1583-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Colony-forming units were determined as described previously (20Crowle A.J. Ross E.J. May M.H. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 2945-2950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bacilli were plated immediately after infection (time 0) and at 2 and 4 or 4 and 7 days after infection. Organisms were released in cold phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Triton X-100, serially diluted in Middlebrook 7H9, and 20 μl of three dilutions were plated in triplicate on Middlebrook 7H10 agar. CFUs were counted after 14 days of incubation and maintained for 21 days to ensure that no additional CFUs became visible. Phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotides were prepared and incorporated into cells as described previously (6Hmama Z. Nandan D. Sly L. Knutson K.L. Herrera-Velit P. Reiner N.E. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1583-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 29Volinia S. Hiles I. Ormondroyd E. Nizetic D. Antonacci R. Rocchi M. Waterfield M.D. Genomics. 1994; 24: 472-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotides to the α-isoform of the p110 subunit were synthesized and high pressure liquid chromatography-purified by Life Technologies, Inc. Oligonucleotides were phosphorothioate-modified to prevent intracellular degradation and were purified to remove incomplete synthesis products. 21-mers were produced to the human α isoform of the p110 subunit of PI 3-K, including the presumed translation initiation site in both sense and antisense directions with the following sequences: sense (5′-ATG CCT CCA AGA CCA TCA TCA-3′) and antisense (5′-TGA TGA TGG TCT TGG AGG CAT-3′). THP-1 cells (5 × 106) were resuspended in 500 μl of RPMI containing 2.5% LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies) and 5 μm phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotides and incubated on a rotary shaker for 4 h at 37 °C prior to adherence and differentiation. NO3− Assays—Nitrite secreted by cells was measured using the Griess reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Sigma). Superoxide assays were performed in triplicate as described previously (30DeLeo F.R. Jutila M.A. Quinn M.T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 198: 35-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) by measuring the superoxide dismutase inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome c. To separate membrane and cytosol fractions, 107 cells were resuspended in 1 ml of cold 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and placed on ice for 20 min. Cell suspensions were homogenized on ice by 20 passages through a 22-gauge needle. Nuclei and intact cells were removed by centrifugation at 800 rpm for 2 min in a Microfuge. Sodium chloride was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 0.15 m. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min. The resulting supernatant contained cytosolic proteins. The pellet was solubilized in 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.15 mNaCl, 10% glycerol and incubated with rotation at 4 °C for 1 h. The resulting suspension was filter-sterilized through a 0.22-μm filter and contained membrane and membrane-associated proteins. 5′-nucleotidase and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays were done to monitor for membrane contamination of cytosol and cytosolic contamination of membrane fractions, respectively. 5′-Nucleotidase activity was measured by the cleavage of phosphate from 5′-AMP (1.25 mm) in reaction buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15m NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2 for 15 min at room temperature. Liberated phosphate was measured by adding malachite green in 0.01% Tween 20 and allowing color to develop for 15 min at room temperature. The amount of phosphate released was determined from a standard curve. LDH assays were performed using an LDH assay kit from Sigma. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed by the method of Laemmli et al. (31Laemmli U.K. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Membranes were developed by ECL as described previously (32Nandan D. Reiner N.E. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4495-4500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Apoptosis was evaluated using the TUNEL assay (Calbiochem) including controls provided with the kit and incubation with actinomycin D as a positive control. Data in graphs are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analyses for superoxide and nitrite assays were done by an unpaired Student's ttest. Comparisons for CFUs were done by analysis of variance for each time point. Differences were considered significant at a level ofp < 0.05. Incubation of M. tuberculosis-infected THP-1 cells with the bioactive metabolite of vitamin D3 resulted in the induction of antimycobacterial activity. In contrast, no effect was observed using either the D3 precursor, 1-hydroxyvitamin D3 (1-OH D3) or an inactive analog, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25-OH D3) (Fig.1 A). Whereas D3had no effect on the growth of M. tuberculosis in broth culture (data not shown), the number of CFUs recovered from THP-1 cells 4 and 7 days after treatment with D3 was 36 ± 3 and 20 ± 4%, respectively, compared with untreated, control cells (Fig. 1 A). Vitamin D3 has previously been shown to initiate a signaling pathway in human mononuclear phagocytes involving activation of PI 3-K (6Hmama Z. Nandan D. Sly L. Knutson K.L. Herrera-Velit P. Reiner N.E. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1583-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Similarly, D3 treatment of M. tuberculosis-infected THP-1 cells activated PI 3-K (Fig.1 B, lanes 5, 7, and9 versus lane 4). To examine the role of PI 3-K in D3-induced antimycobacterial activity, the growth of M. tuberculosis was evaluated in D3-treated cells in the presence and absence of the PI 3-K inhibitors, LY and Wm, as well as in cells treated with antisense phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotides to the p110 subunit of PI 3-Kα. Treatment with either LY or Wm inhibited PI 3-K activity in M. tuberculosis-infected, D3-treated THP-1 cells (Fig.2 A, lanes 4 and 6 versus lane 2). Treatment with either LY or Wm also significantly reduced the antimycobacterial effect of D3 at both day 4 and day 7 in THP-1 cells and day 2 and day 4 in human peripheral blood MDM (Fig. 2, B and C). The effect of LY or Wm was independent of effects on viability of the THP-1 cells. LDH activity was measured in culture supernatants of M. tuberculosis-infected, D3-treated cells 24 h after D3 treatment. Cells were treated with LY, Wm, or diluent. LDH activity at 25 °C was 124.4 units in diluent-treated or LY-treated culture supernatants and 125.9 units in Wm-treated culture supernatants. Analysis of apoptosis in similarly treated cells by TUNEL assay revealed 19.1% TUNEL-positive cells in control samples, 18.5% in LY-treated cells, and 17.2% in Wm-treated cells. Treatment with antisense, but not sense, oligonucleotides to the p110α subunit of PI 3-K eliminated the expression of this protein subunit in M. tuberculosis-infected, D3-treated THP-1 cells (Fig.3 A, lane A versus lane S). Further, treatment of M. tuberculosis-infected THP-1 cells with p110 antisense oligonucleotides also significantly attenuated the antimycobacterial action of D3. At day 4, M. tuberculosis growth was restored from 37 ± 3 to 78 ± 18% of control cells, and at day 7 growth was restored from 21 ± 2 to 77 ± 9% of control cells (Fig. 3 B). Treatment with antisense oligonucleotides to the p110 subunit of PI 3-Kα did not alter either the infection rate or M. tuberculosis growth in non-D3-treated THP-1 cells (Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, the reconstitution of CFUs by antisense to the p110α isoform was as effective as was the use of either nonspecific inhibitor, LY or Wm. Taken together, these findings suggest that the antimycobacterial action of D3 is regulated by class I PI 3-K, p85/p110α. The potential role of NO in mediating the effects of D3 inM. tuberculosis-infected cells was examined using the inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitor l-NMMA and by direct measurement of nitrite production. Treatment ofM. tuberculosis-infected THP-1 cells withl-NMMA did not reduce the antimycobacterial action of D3 (Fig. 4 A), and neither THP-1 cells nor human MDM produced nitrite in response to D3 (data not shown). In contrast, D3-induced antimycobacterial activity in M. tuberculosis-infected, murine RAW 274.1 cells was significantly reduced by pretreatment with l-NMMA. Consistent with the implication that NO contributed to D3-induced antimycobacterial activity in murine cells, D3 treatment of infected RAW cells resulted in significant secretion of nitrite (Fig. 4 B), and this was markedly reduced in the presence of l-NMMA (Fig. 4 B). Also, in contrast to human macrophages, PI 3-K inhibitors did not affect the induction of antimycobacterial activity in infected RAW cells (data not shown). These findings demonstrate that the antimycobacterial action of D3 is NO-independent in human macrophages, whereas the converse is true in murine cells. Moreover, in the latter, this process is independent of any effects of PI 3-K. To examine further mechanisms accounting for the antimycobacterial action of D3, superoxide anion production by THP-1 cells and MDM was measured. M. tuberculosis-infected macrophages secreted large amounts of O⨪2 when treated with D3, and this effect was inhibited by LY and Wm (Fig.5, A and C) as well as by antisense phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotides to the p110α subunit of PI 3-K (Fig. 5 B). Superoxide production occurred within the first 1 h following treatment with D3. There was no detectable superoxide produced by macrophages during the remainder of the experiment. M. tuberculosis infection alone induced the production of 20 ± 3 nmol of O⨪2/106 THP-1 cells/h, and similar values were observed for treatment with D3 alone. However, infection with M. tuberculosis followed by treatment with D3 was observed to result in the production of significantly more O⨪2 (88 nmol of O⨪2/106 macrophages/h). The amount of O⨪2 secreted by infected THP-1 cells in response to D3 was reduced to 41 ± 14 and 33 ± 13 nmol of O⨪2/106 macrophages/h by pretreatment with LY or Wm, respectively (Fig. 5 A). Antisense oligonucleotides to PI 3-K also reduced O⨪2 secretion by M. tuberculosis-infected, D3-treated THP-1 cells from 94 ± 3 to 17 ± 2 nmol/106 macrophages/h, while sense oligonucleotides had no effect (Fig. 5 B). Similar results were obtained using MDM (Fig. 5 C).M. tuberculosis infection alone induced the production of 28 ± 1 nmol of O⨪2/106macrophages/h, and D3 alone induced production of 16 ± 2 nmol of O⨪2/106 macrophages/h. However, infection followed by D3 treatment resulted in the production of significantly higher amounts of O⨪2(78 nmol of O⨪2/106 macrophages/h) by MDM. This amount was reduced to 36 ± 2 and 36 ± 3 nmol of O⨪2/106 macrophages/h by pretreatment with either LY or Wm, respectively. Taken together, these results suggest an interaction between M. tuberculosis infection and D3 in triggering the phagocyte oxidative burst in human MDM as well as in THP-1 cells and that this process is regulated by PI 3-K. Superoxide production was measured in cells treated with either live M. tuberculosis, latex beads, or killed M. tuberculosis alone or in combination with D3. As individual stimuli, live M. tuberculosis, latex beads, heat-killed M. tuberculosis, formaldehyde-fixed M. tuberculosis, UV-irradiatedM. tuberculosis, and D3 elicited comparable and only minimal amounts of O⨪2 production (less than 30 nmol of O⨪2/106 macrophages/h) by THP-1 cells (Fig. 6). However, infection with live M. tuberculosis primed cells for a marked increase in O⨪2 production in response to D3, and this was not observed with either killedM. tuberculosis or latex beads. These findings indicate that phagocytosis per se is not sufficient to prime cells and that viable M. tuberculosis actively contribute to the observed potentiation of the oxidative burst in response to D3. To assess the role of the phagocyte oxidative burst in the antimycobacterial action of D3, 4-hydroxy-TEMPO, PEG-SOD, and PEG-cat were used to examine whether killing of M. tuberculosiswas related to the production of reactive oxygen intermediates. Whereas none of these compounds alone affected the growth of M. tuberculosis in untreated cells, each of them significantly attenuated the ability of D3 to induce resistance toM. tuberculosis in THP-1 cells and MDM (Fig. 7, A and B). Heat-inactivated PEG-SOD or PEG-cat, however, had no effect on D3-induced anti-mycobacterial activity (data not shown). These results indicate that removal of reactive oxygen intermediates, either by scavenging (4-hydroxy-TEMPO) or enzymatically (PEG-cat or PEG-SOD) significantly nullifies the antimycobacterial action of D3. Phagosome oxidase activity requires recruitment of the cytosolic components, p47phox and p67phox, to the membrane for assembly with flavocytochrome b 558(33Clark R.A. Volpp B.D. Leidal K.G.

https://openalex.org/W2113805681,"To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying cutaneous wound repair, we performed a large scale screen to identify novel injury-regulated genes. Here we show a strong up-regulation of the RNA and protein levels of the two Ca2+-binding proteins S100A8 and S100A9 in the hyperthickened epidermis of acute murine and human wounds and of human ulcers. Furthermore, both genes were expressed by inflammatory cells in the wound. The increased expression of S100A8 and S100A9 in wound keratinocytes is most likely related to the activated state of the keratinocytes and not secondary to the inflammation of the skin, since we also found up-regulation of S100A8 and S100A9 in the epidermis of activin-overexpressing mice, which develop a hyperproliferative and abnormally differentiated epidermis in the absence of inflammation. Furthermore, S100A8 and S100A9 expression was found to be associated with partially differentiated keratinocytes in vitro. Using confocal microscopy, both proteins were shown to be at least partially associated with the keratin cytoskeleton. In addition, cultured keratinocytes efficiently secreted the S100A8/A9 dimer. These results together with previously published data suggest that S100A8 and S100A9 are novel players in wound repair, where they might be involved in the reorganization of the keratin cytoskeleton in the wounded epidermis, in the chemoattraction of inflammatory cells, and/or in the defense against microorganisms.

Among them are the migration, proliferation, and differentiation of inflammatory, epithelial, and mesenchymal cells. These cells exert specific functions in a temporally and spatially coordinated manner such as the removal of irreversibly destructed tissue, the deposition of new extracellular matrix, and the reestablishment of the cutaneous barrier (1Clark A.F.

These processes are well described at the histological level, but little is known about their molecular basis. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms that underlie the repair process, we performed a large scale subtractive hybridization screen to systematically identify genes that are differentially expressed in injured compared with normal skin. To minimize the risk of detecting differences in gene expression levels due to changes in cellular composition rather than to transcriptional regulation, we compared normal skin with early (24 h) wounds, because only minor changes in cell type composition occur during the initial wound healing period. One of the cDNA clones that we obtained encodes the murine S100A8 protein (also known as calgranulin A, MRP8, leukocyte protein L1, or cytokine CP-10). S100 proteins are intracellular Ca2+-binding and Ca2+-modulated proteins that form antiparallel noncovalently linked dimers in solution and play a role in various Ca2+-mediated cellular functions including cell growth and differentiation, energy metabolism, cytoskeletal-membrane interactions; some of the S100 proteins regulate kinase activities or are secreted and perform extracellular functions (3Harrison C.A.

S100A8 and its dimerization partner, S100A9 (MRP14), are expressed constitutively in neutrophils and monocytes and, after activation, in macrophages and are secreted by these cells, whereas they are absent from normal skin (4Gabrielsen T.

Here we demonstrate that S100A8 and S100A9 expression is strongly induced during wound healing. We show that these genes are expressed at high levels in the hyperproliferative wound epithelium during the first week after skin injury as well as in inflammatory neutrophils and macrophages that have infiltrated the wound. Moreover, we detected increased levels of S100A8 and S100A9 in the non-inflamed but hyperproliferative, abnormally differentiated epidermis of activin-overexpressing transgenic mice (19Munz B. Smola H. Engelhardt F. Bleuel K. Brauchle M. Lein I. Evans L.W. Huylebroeck D. Balling R. Werner S.

We further show that normal and activin-transfected HaCaT cells secrete a substantial fraction of the S100A8/9 proteins they produce into the culture medium. The results presented in this paper indicate that the induction of these genes is not a consequence of the inflammation but rather correlates with an alternative differentiation pathway of the keratinocytes and suggest a novel role for secreted S100A8/9 during wound healing. BALB/c mice were obtained from Charles River Wiga, Sulzfeld, Germany and from RCC Ltd., Füllinsdorf, Switzerland.

Several independent wound healing experiments were performed. For each experiment, 24 BALB/c mice (8–10 weeks of age) were anesthetized with a single intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine. The hairs on the back of the animals were cut, and the skin was wiped with 70% alcohol. Four full-thickness excisional wounds (5-mm diameter, 8–10 mm apart) were generated on the back of each animal by excising skin and panniculus carnosus. The excised skin pieces were saved and used as unwounded control samples. The wounds were allowed to dry to form a scab. At different time points after injury (1, 3, 5, 7, and 14 days), animals were sacrificed, and the complete wounds including 2 mm of the wound margins were isolated. For preparation of RNA, the tissue from four animals was combined, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until used for RNA isolation. Total cellular RNA was prepared as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (20Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar). For in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence, wounds were bisected and fixed for 4 h in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).1 Half of each wound was transferred to 15% sucrose in PBS before embedding in tissue-freezing medium (Jung, Köln, Germany) and preparation of frozen sections, and the other half was embedded in paraffin wax and processed according to standard procedures. Biopsies were taken by consent from patients presenting ulcera crura (n = 4) of more than 4 months' duration, due to primary or secondary venous insufficiency (size of ulcer >30 cm2). The biopsies were obtained from the wound edge of chronic wounds and showed no clinical sign of infection. As a control, intact skin from the same patients was taken. For the analysis of physiological wound healing, biopsies were taken from healthy volunteers (n = 4), including day-5 wounds (6-mm diameter) and intact skin. After paraformaldehyde fixation, one biopsy was embedded in tissue freezing medium, and the other biopsy (from the same site and the same patient) was embedded in paraffin wax and processed according to standard procedures. All procedures were approved by the local ethics committee of the Technical University of Munich. Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized starting from 1 μg of total RNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and the SMART PCR cDNA synthesis kit (CLONTECH, Heidelberg, Germany). cDNA subtraction was performed using the PCR-Select cDNA subtraction kit (CLONTECH). cDNA synthesis and subtraction were performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. 50 ng of subtracted cDNA were cloned directly into 50 ng of the pT-Adv vector (CLONTECH). The ligation mixture was introduced into Escherichia coli SURE (Stratagene, Amsterdam, Netherlands) by electroporation (1.7 kV) using an E. coli pulser (Bio-Rad). The resulting library was separated into aliquots and frozen in 15% glycerol. An aliquot was plated on selective media containing 100 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 50 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside. A total of 3840 individual recombinant clones were picked and used to inoculate 40 sterile 96-well microtiter plates containing LB medium and ampicillin at 100 μg/ml. After PCR amplification of the cDNA insertions according to the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH), the products were dotted in an array onto nylon membranes for duplicate screening using a 384 pin replicator (NUNC, Denmark). The cDNAs were denatured by incubating the prepared membranes on polyethylene-coated Whatman paper soaked in 0.4 m NaOH for 20 min followed by washing the membranes with Tris EDTA buffer. Fixation was performed by baking (30 min at 80 °C) followed by UV-cross-linking (256 nm, 120 mJ/cm2). The filters were hybridized under stringent conditions (25 mm sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.5, 125 mm NaCl, 7% SDS at 67 °C) with equivalent amounts of32P-labeled subtracted double-stranded cDNAs of equal specific activity derived from the wound minus skin and the skin minus wound subtractions. Filters were washed under stringent conditions (hybridization buffer diluted 1:10 at 67 °C) and analyzed using the PhosphorImager (Storm 860, Molecular Dynamics, Krefeld, Germany). Differentially expressed cDNAs were identified by comparison of the resulting signals. RNase protection assays were performed according to (21Werner S. Weinberg W. Liao X. Peters K.G. Blessing M. Yuspa S.H. Weiner R.I. Williams L.T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2635-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). 276- and 267-base pair fragments corresponding to the full-length coding sequence of S100A8 and nucleotides 108–375 of the coding sequence of S100A9 served as templates for the generation of 32P-labeled antisense riboprobes. The template for the human activin βA probe was recently described (19Munz B. Smola H. Engelhardt F. Bleuel K. Brauchle M. Lein I. Evans L.W. Huylebroeck D. Balling R. Werner S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5205-5215Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Frozen sections (6 μm) from the middle of 5-day-old wounds were hybridized as described (22Wilkinson D. Bailes J. Champion J. McMahon A. Development. 1987; 99: 493-500PubMed Google Scholar). 246- and 267-base pair fragments corresponding to nucleotides 97–343 of the coding and 3′-untranslated sequence of S100A8 and nucleotides 108–375 of the coding sequence of S100A9 served as templates for the generation of 35S-labeled antisense riboprobes. After hybridization, sections were coated with Kodak NBT2 nuclear emulsion (Integra Bioscience AG, Wallisellen, Switzerland) and exposed in the dark for 3 weeks. After development, sections were counterstained with Mayer's hemalum and eosin, mounted, and analyzed using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with a Jenoptik ProgRes 3008 CCD camera. Partial cDNA fragments of human S100A8 (nucleotides 72–241) and human S100A9 (nucleotides 13–375) were amplified under standard PCR conditions. The primers used were as follows: 5′-AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGG GAA TTT CCA TGC CGT CTA CAG G-3′ (S100A8 sense primer, with T3 promoter sequence underlined); 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC CCA CGC CCA TCT TTA TCA CCA G-3′ (S100A8 antisense-primer, with T7 promoter sequence underlined); 5′-AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGG GTG GCT CCT CGG CTT TGA CA-3′ (S100A9 sense primer, with T3 promoter sequence underlined); 5′-ATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAATAC CCC GAG GCC TGG CTT ATG GT-3′ (S100A9 antisense primer, with Sp6 promoter sequence underlined). Human cDNA of 5-day-old wounds was subjected to 40 cycles of PCR (94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min 30 s). Resultant PCR products were subcloned into the vector pCR 2.1 TOPO (Invitrogen, Leek, Netherlands) and verified by sequencing. Digoxigenin-labeled sense and antisense riboprobes were synthesized with T3, T7, or Sp6 polymerase using the digoxigenin RNA labeling mix from Roche Molecular Biochemicalsaccording to the manufacturer's protocol. Non-radioactive in situ hybridization was performed as previously described (23Komminoth P. Merk F.B. Leav I. Wolfe H.J. Roth J. Histochemistry. 1992; 98: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, deparaffinized sections were treated with proteinase K and acetylated. For prehybridization, the sections were overlaid with hybridization mix (50% formamide, 4× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 5% dextran sulfate, 1× Denhardt's solution, 250 μg/ml tRNA, 500 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA) for at least 1 h at 55 °C. Hybridization was performed overnight at 55 °C with 80 ng of sense or antisense probe (diluted in hybridization mix) per section. After stringent washing steps (2× SSC for 30 min at room temperature, 50% formamide, 2× SSC for 30 min at room temperature, 50% formamide, 2× SSC for 30 min at 50 °C, 1× SSC for 15 min at room temperature) and RNase A digestion, the hybridized digoxigenin-labeled probes were detected by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody (DAKO, Hamburg, Germany). Hybridization signals were visualized using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium. Some sections were counterstained with Nuclear Fast Red (Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, England). Sections were processed for immunoperoxidase staining as described previously (17Roth J. Sunderkötter C. Goebeler M. Gutwald J. Sorg C. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1992; 98: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, acetone-fixed sections (5 μm) were placed in PBS containing 0.1% hydrogen peroxide (v/v) and 0.12 m sodium azide (Merck) to inhibit endogenous peroxidase activity. After blocking nonspecific protein binding with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in PBS, sections were incubated with 1 μg/ml antibodies against S100A8 or S100A9 (24Goebeler M. Roth J. Henseleit U. Sunderkötter C. Sorg C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 53: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 25Roth J. Burwinkel F. van den Bos C. Goebeler M. Vollmer E. Sorg C. Blood. 1993; 82: 1875-1883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or with the monoclonal antibody 27E10, which exclusively detects the S100A8/A9 heterodimer but not single monomers (27Bhardwaj R. Zotz C. Zwadlo-Klarwasser G. Roth J. Goebeler M. Mahnke K. Falk M. Meinardus-Hager G. Sorg C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 1891-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dianova). Peroxidase activity was detected with 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (Sigma). Sections were counterstained with Mayer's hemalum (Merck). For negative controls, specific antibodies were replaced by isotype-matched antibodies of irrelevant specificity. Paraffin was removed from sections that had been prepared from the middle of 5-day-old wounds and tail skin of activin-overexpressing and wild-type mice. After rehydration, sections were allowed to dry. HaCaT cells were grown to confluence on positively charged microscope slides (Superfrost; Menzel Gläser, Germany), and some specimens were incubated with 10 μmCa2+ ionophore A23187 (Calbiochem) for 1 h to ensure the activation of Ca2+-dependent cellular processes before fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, washing with PBS, and postfixation with ice-cold acetone for 10 min. Specimens were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with specific antisera to S100A8 or S100A9 (24Goebeler M. Roth J. Henseleit U. Sunderkötter C. Sorg C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 53: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 25Roth J. Burwinkel F. van den Bos C. Goebeler M. Vollmer E. Sorg C. Blood. 1993; 82: 1875-1883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and, in some instances, with a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against human cytokeratin 10 (DAKO), diluted in PBS containing 12% bovine serum albumin. After washing with PBS, sections were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody directed against rabbit and/or mouse immunoglobulins (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After washing with PBS, sections were allowed to dry and mounted with Mowiol (Hoechst, Frankfurt, Germany) orn-propyl gallate/Tris/glycerol, and fluorescence was analyzed either by using a Zeiss Axioplan microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu three-color CCD camera or by using a Leica DM IRBE fluorescence microscope equipped with a TCSNT confocal laser system. Tissues were homogenized in Tris buffer containing 8m urea, protein concentration was determined by the BCA method, and 30-μg aliquots were boiled in sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol before SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotting onto nitrocellulose membrane (Protran, Schleicher &Schuell). Membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with specific antisera to S100A8 or S100A9 (24Goebeler M. Roth J. Henseleit U. Sunderkötter C. Sorg C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 53: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 25Roth J. Burwinkel F. van den Bos C. Goebeler M. Vollmer E. Sorg C. Blood. 1993; 82: 1875-1883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) followed by alkaline phosphate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Promega, Heidelberg, Germany). Antibody binding was visualized using nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Promega). Vector-transfected and activin βA-transfected HaCaT cells were grown in 100-mm tissue culture dishes in 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Amimed; Bioconcept, Allschwil, Switzerland) and 200 mg/liter Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). For determination of secreted S100A8/9, the medium was replaced by serum-free DMEM at confluence, and aliquots of 300 μl of supernatant were sampled from the dishes immediately and at different time points thereafter. Cells were pelleted from the supernatant, and the supernatant was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. In one experiment, the number of dead cells floating in the supernatant was analyzed using trypan blue exclusion and found to be not greater than 0.5% of the total number of cells. At the end of the experiment, the cells on each plate were trypsinized and counted for normalization to cell number. For determination of intracellular S100A8/9, cells were trypsinized at confluence, and an aliquot was counted using a hemocytometer. Cells were then pelleted and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. A quantitative sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for S100A9 was performed as described previously (26Frosch M. Strey A. Vogl T. Wulffraat N.M. Kuis W. Sunderkötter C. Harms E. Sorg C. Roth J. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 628-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Using the PCR-Select kit we constructed a subtractive cDNA library of normal versus wounded murine skin and vice versa in order to identify genes that are either up- or down-regulated after skin injury. One of the ESTs we obtained from the screen for up-regulated genes corresponded to the full-length murine S100A8 (mS100A8) cDNA. To confirm the differential expression, we analyzed the mS100A8 mRNA levels during the different stages of wound repair by RNase protection assay. As shown in Fig.1 A, mS100A8 mRNA expression, which was barely detectable in healthy skin, was dramatically up-regulated during the first week after injury and subsequently decreased until it had reached low levels by the end of the second week after wounding, when the wounds were fully healed. Identical results were obtained with probes that were either transcribed from the initial EST or from the full-length sequence (shown is the result obtained with the full-length probe). Moreover, this result was confirmed by analysis of independently prepared RNAs using real time reverse transcriptase-PCR. By this technique, a 40-fold increase in mS100A8 mRNA levels in 1-day wounds compared with intact skin was measured (data not shown). Because S100A8 is usually co-expressed with its dimerization partner, S100A9, we determined whether mS100A9 mRNA is also up-regulated after injury. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 1 B, mS100A9 expression was strongly induced in 1–7-day-old wounds. Moreover, mS100A8 and mS100A9 mRNA levels seemed to be regulated in a strictly coordinated fashion. This result was reproduced twice with different sets of RNAs from independent wounding experiments. To determine the expression levels of mS100A8 and mS100A9 proteins within the wounds, Western blot analysis was performed with specific antisera and an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. As described previously, the specificity of these antisera has been verified by Western blot analysis of lysates prepared from monocytes and granulocytes as well as by immunoreactivity against recombinant S100A8 and S100A9 and against S100A8 and/or S100A9 transfected fibroblastic cell lines (24Goebeler M. Roth J. Henseleit U. Sunderkötter C. Sorg C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 53: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 25Roth J. Burwinkel F. van den Bos C. Goebeler M. Vollmer E. Sorg C. Blood. 1993; 82: 1875-1883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of wound lysates revealed that mS100A8 and mS100A9 proteins were also induced after injury, with kinetics that correlated with those of the mRNAs (Fig.1, D and E). To identify and localize the mS100A8/A9-expressing cell types within the wound, we performedin situ hybridization on sections of 5-day-old wounds. At this stage after injury, a thick hyperproliferative epithelium as well as extensive granulation tissue containing various inflammatory cells is present in the wound. As shown in Fig.2, 35S-labeled antisense probes for mS100A8 (Fig. 2, A and B) and mS100A9 (Fig. 2, C and D) yielded striking hybridization signals throughout the suprabasal layers of the hyperproliferative epithelium (Fig. 2, A–D), indicating that differentiating wound keratinocytes express high levels of mS100A8 and mS100A9 mRNAs. By contrast, keratinocytes at a distance from the wound did not express these genes (data not shown). Inspection of the granulation tissue at high magnification also revealed a specific population of cells that were decorated with silver grains (Fig. 2, G andH). The shape of their nuclei suggests that these cells are neutrophils and macrophages, which are known producers of S100A8 and S100A9 (4Gabrielsen T. Dale I. Brandtzaeg P. Hoel P.S. Fagerhol M.K.

No signals were obtained with probes transcribed in the sense direction (Fig. 2, E and F, for mS100A9; data not shown for mS100A8). Subsequently, we performed immunohistochemical stains and immunofluorescence analysis with specific antisera to localize the mS100A8 and mS100A9 proteins. Fig. 3,A-C, shows overviews of sections through 5-day-old wounds that were immunostained using a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. In sections stained for mS100A8 (Fig. 3 A) and S100A9 (Fig. 3 B), the reaction product was seen within the hyperthickened wound epidermis (arrows in Fig. 3,A and B) as well as in punctate locations throughout the deeper layers of the dermis and the granulation tissue, whereas control sections stained with preimmune sera did not show this specific stain (Fig. 3 C). To localize both mS100A8 and mS100A9 in the hyperproliferative epidermis at the wound edge at higher resolution, we performed indirect immunofluorescence on serial sections of several 5-day-old wounds. A typical result is shown in Fig. 3,D–F. Immunofluorescent label decorated the cytoplasm of the suprabasal differentiating wound keratinocytes in the sections that were stained for mS100A8 (Fig. 3 D) and mS100A9 (Fig.3 E), whereas no epidermal stain was seen when the first antibody was omitted (Fig. 3 F). Furthermore, by staining sections of earlier and later wounds, we determined that in 3-day-old wounds, the suprabasal cells of the emerging hyperproliferative epithelium already were highly immunopositive for mS100A8 and mS100A9, whereas at day 13 after injury, when the epidermis reversed to a non-hyperproliferative state, no immunoreactivity was seen in keratinocytes (data not shown). To determine whether the up-regulation of S100A8 and S100A9 also occurs in injured human skin, we prepared digoxigenin-labeled antisense probes for the human homologs, hS100A8 and hS100A9, and hybridized them to sections of human wounds. As seen in Fig. 4, both mRNAs were strongly expressed in suprabasal epithelial cells of acute full-thickness excisional skin wounds that were taken from healthy adult volunteers (n = 4) 5 days after injury (Fig. 4, C–F). Moreover, in sections prepared from chronic venous ulcers (n = 3 for S100A8 and n = 1 for S100A9), we observed a strong hybridization signal in the suprabasal layers of the stro"
https://openalex.org/W2089001126,"The yeast Mps1p protein kinase acts in centrosome duplication and the spindle assembly checkpoint. We demonstrate here that a mouse Mps1p ortholog (esk, which we designate mMps1p) regulates centrosome duplication. Endogenous mMps1p and overexpressed GFP-mMps1p localize to centrosomes and kinetochores in mouse cells. Overexpression of GFP-mMps1p causes reduplication of centrosomes during S phase arrest. In contrast, a kinase-deficient mutant blocks centrosome duplication altogether. Control of centrosome duplication by mMps1p requires a known regulator of the process, Cdk2. Inhibition of Cdk2 prevents centrosome reduplication and destabilizes mMps1p, causing its subsequent loss from centrosomes, suggesting that Cdk2 promotes mMps1p's centrosome duplication function by regulating its stability during S phase. Thus, mMps1p, an in vitro Cdk2 substrate, regulates centrosome duplication jointly with Cdk2."

In wild-type mice, syndecan-3, the predominantly neural syndecan, is expressed in hypothalamic regions that control energy balance.

FR-α expression in Jurkat cells facilitated MBG or EBO entry, and FR-blocking reagents inhibited infection by MBG or EBO. Finally, FR-α bound cells expressing MBG or EBO GP and mediated syncytia formation triggered by MBG GP. Thus, FR-α is a significant cofactor for cellular entry for MBG and EBO viruses."

The accessory protein dynactin has been proposed to mediate the association of dynein with vesicular cargo.

Here, we demonstrate that Arp1 binds directly to the Golgi-associated βIII spectrin isoform. We identify two Arp1-binding sites in βIII spectrin, one of which overlaps with the actin-binding site conserved among spectrins. Although conventional actin binds weakly to βIII spectrin, Arp1 binds robustly in the presence of excess F-actin. Dynein, dynactin, and βIII spectrin co-purify on vesicles isolated from rat brain, and βIII spectrin co-immunoprecipitates with dynactin from rat brain cytosol. In interphase cells, βIII spectrin and dynactin both localize to cytoplasmic vesicles, co-localizing most significantly in the perinuclear region of the cell. In dividing cells, βIII spectrin and dynactin co-localize to the developing cleavage furrow and mitotic spindle, a novel localization for βIII spectrin.

One possibility is that dynactin increases the processive nature of the movement of dynein along cellular microtubules (3Waterman-Storer C.M. Karki S. Holzbaur E.L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1634-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 10King S.J. Schroer T.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). A second but not mutually exclusive hypothesis is that dynactin links dynein to its cellular cargo (11Holleran E.A. Tokito M.K. Karki S. Holzbaur E.L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1815-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Although a dynactin-independent association between a dynein light chain and the rhodopsin receptor has been detected in rod cell vesicles (12Tai A.W. Chuang J.Z. Bode C. Wolfrum U. Sung C.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 877-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), other studies suggest that dynactin is required to mediate the interaction of dynein with vesicular cargo. Antibodies that block the dynein-dynactin interaction deplete dynein from vesicles and inhibit microtubule-based vesicular transport (6Waterman-Storer C.M. Karki S. Kuznetsov S.A. Tabb J.S.

Holzbaur E.L.F. Weiss D.G. Kuznetsov S.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2077-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Furthermore, disruption of the dynein-dynactin interaction by dynamitin overexpression inhibits dynein-mediated vesicle trafficking in cells (9Presley J.F. Cole N.B. Schroer T.A. Hirschberg K. Zaal K.J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Nature. 1997; 389: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The nature of the interaction between dynactin and vesicular cargo is not yet clear. Dynactin might interact directly with components of the lipid bilayer (13Karki S. Tokito M.K. Holzbaur E.L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4834-4839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), but extraction studies suggest that dynactin is more peripherally associated with organelle membranes via protein-protein interactions (1Holleran E.A. Karki S. Holzbaur E.L.F. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 182: 69-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on observations of cells overexpressing the Arp1 subunit of dynactin, we previously proposed that the association of dynactin with vesicles is mediated by an interaction between Arp1 and an organelle-associated spectrin (11Holleran E.A. Tokito M.K. Karki S. Holzbaur E.L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1815-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 14Holleran E.A. Holzbaur E.L.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 26-29Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Conventional spectrin associates with the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane, forming orthogonal arrays that are connected by 37-nm actin filaments and that are attached to the membrane by peripheral and integral membrane proteins (15Hartwig J. Protein Profiles. 1994; 1: 711-714Google Scholar, 16De Matteis M.A. Morrow J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A noncortical role for spectrin has also been proposed. Immunocytochemical evidence suggests that spectrin isoforms localize to the Golgi, and Golgi and lysosomal isoforms of the spectrin-binding protein ankyrin have been identified (17Devarajan P.

Spectrin arrays may form vesicular coats that, in conjunction with a motile force, mediate vesicle sorting and trafficking. Here we report a direct interaction between the Arp1 subunit of dynactin and βIII spectrin, an isoform that localizes to vesicles and the Golgi (20Stankewich M.C. Tse W.T. Peters L.L. Ch'ng Y. John K.M. Stabach P.R. Devarajan P. Morrow J.S. Lux S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14158-14163Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We define two Arp1-binding sites on βIII spectrin and demonstrate that βIII spectrin binds preferentially to Arp1 rather than actin. Biochemical assays demonstrate that βIII spectrin co-purifies with dynein and dynactin on vesicles and that βIII spectrin co-immunoprecipitates with dynactin. Further, we compare the distributions of βIII spectrin and dynactin by immunocytochemistry. These data support a model in which an Arp1-βIII spectrin interaction mediates the direct interaction of dynein and dynactin with vesicles, providing for the active, dynein-mediated transport of specific vesicular cargo along cellular microtubules. Rabbit and chicken polyclonal antibodies raised to residues 1019–1464 of βIII spectrin were described previously (20Stankewich M.C. Tse W.T. Peters L.L. Ch'ng Y. John K.M. Stabach P.R. Devarajan P. Morrow J.S. Lux S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14158-14163Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar); rabbit-anti-βIII spectrin was affinity-purified against the antigen. Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies to dynactin subunits p150Glued, Arp1, and dynamitin and an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody to the dynein intermediate chain are as described (11Holleran E.A.

Cell. 1996; 7: 1167-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies to tubulin (YL1/2 from Serotec and DM1A from Sigma), p150Glued (P41920from Transduction Laboratories), dynamitin (D74620 from Transduction Laboratories), and α-fodrin (nonerythroid spectrin, clone AA6 from ICN) were obtained commercially. Gel samples were resolved by electrophoresis through SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). The blots were blocked using 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline, pH 8.0, 0.05% IGEPAL (non-ionic detergent from Sigma; (octylphenoxy)polyethoxyethanol), and 0.05% sodium azide and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Detection was accomplished by means of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch) and Renaissance Western blot chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunoprecipitations using a monoclonal antibody to dynamitin to isolate dynactin from rat brain cytosol were performed as described previously (21Tokito M.K. Howland D.S. Lee V.M.-Y. Holzbaur E.L.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1167-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A control precipitation using protein A beads without antibody was performed in parallel to test for nonspecific binding to beads, as described (13Karki S. Tokito M.K. Holzbaur E.L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4834-4839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For immunocytochemistry, either PtK2 (a rat kangaroo kidney cell line from ATCC), COS-7 (an African green monkey kidney cell line from ATCC), or Rat2 (a rat embryo fibroblast cell line from ATCC) cells were fixed in −20 °C methanol for 5–10 min, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, blocked in phosphate-buffered saline with 5% goat serum and 1% bovine serum albumin, and then incubated either overnight at 4 °C or for 1 h at room temperature with the primary antibodies indicated. The primary antibodies were followed by incubation in the appropriate fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). The interaction of Arp1 and βIII spectrin was tested in the yeast two-hybrid assay using reagents and protocols from CLONTECH. Full-length human cDNAs encoding Arp1 (11Holleran E.A. Tokito M.K. Karki S. Holzbaur E.L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1815-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) or p150Glued (21Tokito M.K. Howland D.S. Lee V.M.-Y. Holzbaur E.L.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1167-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) were subcloned into the vector pACT2 to yield plasmids pACT2-Arp1 and pACT2-p150, respectively, with the Arp1 or p150Gluedsequences fused in-frame to the GAL4 transcription activation domain. A 2.6-kilobase fragment of βIII spectrin was subcloned into the vector pGBT9 to yield the plasmid pGBT-BIII with βIII fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain. Both the pACT2 and pGBT plasmids were introduced into yeast strains PJ69–2A and Y187, which carry the ADE2 and lacZ reporter genes, respectively. The ADE2 strain cannot grow in medium lacking adenine unless the ADE2 reporter is activated. The pGBT-BIII construct alone gave some background activation of the lacZ reporter gene, but neither pGBT-BIII nor pACT2-Arp1 activated the ADE2 reporter gene alone or in combination with complementary vectors that included the activation and binding domains but lacked the Arp1 or βIII inserts. GST,1either alone or fused to the amino termini of spectrin βIII constructs encoding amino acid residues 1- 851, 1–304, 1019–1464, and 2092–2390 (see Fig. 1a) was expressed in the BL21 strain ofEscherichia coli. Expression was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and then cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 mmTris, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and stored at −80 °C. The cells were lysed in the presence of protease inhibitors either by sonication or using a microfluidizer (Microfluidics Inc., Newton, MA). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 39,000 × g, and the soluble supernatant fractions were loaded onto glutathione-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed extensively in phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, and 1.8 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.3) prior to use in affinity experiments. The Promega TNT T7 Quick coupled transcription/translation system was used to express Arp1 (human cDNA described in Ref. 11Holleran E.A. Tokito M.K. Karki S. Holzbaur E.L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1815-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), p150Glued (human cDNA described in Ref. 21Tokito M.K. Howland D.S. Lee V.M.-Y. Holzbaur E.L.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1167-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and actin (human β-actin cDNA obtained from Dr. E. Kislauskis, University of Massachusetts Medical School) in vitro. TNT T7 Master mix, [35S]methionine, and 1 μg of cDNA for either Arp1, actin, or p150Glued (each subcloned in the vector pcDNA3) were incubated at 30 °C for 1.5 h. In vitro synthesized Arp1 or p150Glued was then loaded onto GST, GST-βIII 1–304, GST-βIII 1019–1464, or GST-βIII 2092–2390 beads as noted and batchbound with gentle shaking at 25 °C for 1–2 h. After extensive washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the columns were eluted with 1 and 2 m NaCl, and the resulting fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Rat brains were homogenized in either PHEM buffer (50 mm NaPIPES, 50 mm NaHEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 6.9) or 0.5× motility buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, 175,l-aspartic acid, 65 mm taurine, 85 mm betaine, 25 mm glycine, 6.5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmd-glucose, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.2) (22Muresan V.

Cell. 2001; 7: 173-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), as noted, supplemented with the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Nα-p-tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester A protease inhibitor, leupeptin, and pepstatin. Rat brain cytosol was prepared by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 60 min (13Karki S. Tokito M.K. Holzbaur E.L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4834-4839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The pellet from the second centrifugation step was resuspended in buffer to provide a membrane-enriched fraction. Parallel aliquots of this membrane-enriched fraction were either left untreated or extracted with either 0.6 mm KI or 1 mm neomycin. The vesicles were isolated from these fractions by flotation upward through a sucrose step gradient, with steps of 2, 1.5, and 0.6 msucrose as described (6Waterman-Storer C.M. Karki S. Kuznetsov S.A. Tabb J.S. Weiss D.G. Langford G.M. Holzbaur E.L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12180-12185Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Soluble proteins were retained in the bottom layer of 2 m sucrose, whereas vesicles were isolated from the 1.5/0.6 m sucrose interface. The Golgi-targeting region in spectrin (23Devarajan P. Stabach P.R. Dematteis M.A. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10711-10716Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), which spans the amino-terminal domain and first five spectrin repeats (βIII-GT; Fig.1a), was used to test for a direct interaction between Arp1 and βIII spectrin. For yeast two-hybrid binding analysis, Arp1 was fused to the GAL4 activation domain (vector pACT2), and the Golgi-targeting region in βIII spectrin (βIII-GT) was fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (Fig.1a). An interaction was monitored by observing for growth on medium lacking adenine. Co-expression of the Arp1 and βIII-GT fusion proteins was required for growth (Fig. 1b). Expression of either of the fusion proteins with the complimentary empty vector did not activate the ADE2 reporter gene (Fig.1b). As an additional control for specificity, co-expression of the p150Glued subunit of dynactin and βIII-GT spectrin did not activate the ADE2 reporter gene (data not shown). We conclude that the Arp1 subunit of dynactin binds directly to βIII spectrin. To confirm the Arp1/βIII interaction, we used affinity chromatography. An affinity column was generated in which the βIII Golgi-targeting domain (Fig. 1a) was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (GST-βIII-GT) and then bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. In vitrotranslated Arp1 was loaded over the GST-βIII-GT column or a GST control column, and bound protein was eluted with salt (Fig.1c). Arp1 bound to the GST-βIII-GT column but was not significantly retained on the GST control column. To verify the specificity of this interaction, we tested another subunit of dynactin, p150Glued, for binding to the GST-βIII-GT affinity matrix (Fig. 1c). 35S-labeled p150Glued did not bind to either the βIII spectrin column or the GST column. These results support the yeast two-hybrid assay results indicating that the Arp1 subunit of dynactin binds directly to βIII spectrin. βIII spectrin can be divided into three domains (Fig. 1a): an amino-terminal domain (amino acids 1–304) that contains a region homologous to the minimal actin-binding domain identified in other β-spectrins, a central domain (amino acids 304–2092) containing 17 spectrin repeats of ∼106 amino acid residues each, and a carboxyl-terminal domain (amino acids 2092–2390) that includes a pleckstrin homology domain thought to be involved in membrane association (15Hartwig J. Protein Profiles. 1994; 1: 711-714Google Scholar, 20Stankewich M.C. Tse W.T. Peters L.L. Ch'ng Y. John K.M. Stabach P.R. Devarajan P. Morrow J.S. Lux S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14158-14163Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 24Karinch A.M. Zimmer W.E. Goodman S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11833-11840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We generated three GST-βIII spectrin constructs to determine the region with which Arp1 interacts: DI, which spans residues 1–304; DII, which spans residues 1019–1464 (repeats 7 through 11); and DIII, which spans residues 2092–2390 (Fig.1a). Affinity matrices of each construct were tested for Arp1 binding. 35S-Labeled Arp1 bound to both the DI and DIII constructs but did not bind significantly to the DII construct or to the GST control column (Fig.2a). We conclude that Arp1 binds to the conserved actin-binding domain of βIII spectrin and that there is an additional Arp1-binding site in domain III. In the absence of additional co-factors such as adducin and band 4.1, actin binds relatively weakly to previously characterized β-spectrins (25Li X. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15695-15702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To determine whether actin binds to the βIII isoform of spectrin, we examined the binding of 35S-labeled actin to affinity matrices of the two constructs that showed Arp1 binding. Actin bound poorly to DI and did not bind detectably to DIII (Fig. 2b). A qualitative comparison of the Arp1 and actin binding data suggests that Arp1 binds more efficiently than actin to the GST-βIII DI construct in this assay (Fig. 2). To examine the relative affinities of Arp1 and actin for βIII spectrin, we investigated the effect of excess filamentous actin (F-actin) on the binding of Arp1 binding to βIII spectrin. The affinity matrices of the DI and DIII constructs were preincubated with 100 μm purified F-actin and tested for the binding of35S-labeled Arp1 in the continued presence of excess F-actin. The binding of Arp1 to either of the βIII spectrin constructs was not reduced by the presence of excess F-actin (Fig.3), suggesting that βIII spectrin binds to Arp1 with a higher affinity than it does to conventional actin. Thus, the interaction between Arp1 and βIII spectrin is possible even under cellular conditions in which actin is present in great excess over dynactin (see “Discussion”). If a dynactin-spectrin interaction is involved in linking dynein to intracellular vesicles, then dynein, dynactin, and βIII spectrin should co-purify with biochemically isolated vesicles. To examine this hypothesis, a membrane-enriched fraction isolated by differential centrifugation of rat brain homogenate was further fractionated on a sucrose step gradient. Under these conditions, soluble proteins remain in the bottom layer of 2 m sucrose, whereas membrane-associated proteins float upward through a 1.5m sucrose cushion to concentrate at the interface between the 1.5 and 0.6 m sucrose layers (6Waterman-Storer C.M. Karki S. Kuznetsov S.A. Tabb J.S. Weiss D.G. Langford G.M. Holzbaur E.L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12180-12185Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We blotted fractions from the 2 and 1.5 m layers, as well as from the 1.5/0.6m interface using antibodies to βIII spectrin, dynactin subunits p150Glued, dynamitin (p50), Arp1, and dynein intermediate chain. βIII spectrin, dynactin, and dynein were all found in the membrane-enriched layer at the 1.5/0.6 minterface (Fig. 4), demonstrating that these proteins co-purify with vesicles. However, there were also significant soluble pools of each of these proteins (Fig. 4). The presence of both soluble and membrane-associated pools of dynein and dynactin has been described by numerous groups (see for example Ref.26Reese E.L. Haimo L.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These data suggest that there are both soluble and membrane-associated pools of βIII spectrin as well. Dynein, dynactin, and βIII spectrin are thought to be peripherally associated with the lipid bilayer of intracellular organelles (27Fath K.R. Trimbur G.M. Burgess D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1169-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We examined how readily these proteins could be extracted from vesicles by potassium iodide, a reagent that dissociates peripherally associated proteins from membranes. Dynein was readily extracted from vesicles by 0.6 m KI, but dynactin and βIII spectrin were only partially extracted under these conditions (Fig. 4), suggesting that both dynactin and spectrin are more tightly associated with vesicles than is dynein. The antibiotic neomycin interferes with the interaction between pleckstrin homology domains and phospholipids and has been shown to strip both dynactin and spectrin from squid axonal vesicles (22Muresan V. Stankewich M.C. Steffen W. Morrow J.S. Holzbaur E.L.F. Schnapp B.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 173-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Neomycin treatment did not, however, dissociate spectrin or dynactin from rat brain vesicles (Fig. 4). These data may indicate that βIII spectrin and dynactin are more strongly associated with vesicular membranes in vertebrates than in squid. To further test the hypothesis that βIII spectrin associates with dynactin within the cell, we immunoprecipitated dynactin from rat brain cytosol using an antibody to the dynamitin subunit and probed for the co-immunoprecipitation of βIII spectrin. We have previously demonstrated that each of the dynactin subunits co-immunoprecipitates under these conditions and that actin does not co-precipitate (11Holleran E.A. Tokito M.K. Karki S. Holzbaur E.L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1815-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Dynactin was precipitated by the anti-dynamitin (p50) antibody, as judged by the presence of the p150Glued subunit, whereas no p150Glued was seen in the control precipitation (Fig.5). βIII spectrin co-immunoprecipitated with dynactin but was not found in the control precipitation. To examine the specificity of this interaction, we also probed the immunoprecipitate for fodrin, an αII/βII spectrin expressed in brain, but saw no evidence for the co-immunoprecipitation of this protein with dynactin. Together, these data indicate that dynactin and βIII spectrin are associated in vivo. We compared the cellular localization of dynein, dynactin, and βIII spectrin using double label immunofluorescence. In interphase PtK2 cells, dynein, dynactin, and βIII spectrin show similar punctate cytoplasmic distributions consistent with the association of these proteins with vesicles (Fig.6). All three proteins are concentrated in the perinuclear region of the cell where they partially co-localize with markers of the Golgi (data not shown), but none are restricted to that region. Although these observations are consistent with the hypothesis that spectrin is involved in linking dynactin to intracellular vesicles such as those undergoing dynein-mediated trafficking into the Golgi, we do not see complete co-localization. However, dynein and dynactin do not completely co-localize either (for example, see Ref. 28Karki S. LaMonte B. Holzbaur E.L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), despite extensive genetic and biochemical data demonstrating that the functions of these proteins are interdependent. The βIII staining (Fig. 6) is more clearly tubulovesicular than that observed with antibodies to either dynein or dynactin, consistent with biochemical observations that this protein is most robustly associated with the vesicular fraction. Further, it has been proposed that βIII spectrin forms a membrane-associated coat (23Devarajan P. Stabach P.R. Dematteis M.A. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10711-10716Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and therefore is expected to be highly enriched on vesicles. Although we observed only partial co-localization of dynactin and βIII spectrin in interphase cells, we saw more obvious co-localization of these proteins in cells undergoing division. Dynactin and cytoplasmic dynein are required for multiple aspects of cell division, including mitotic spindle organization and orientation and microtubule-kinetochore interactions (1Holleran E.A. Karki S. Holzbaur E.L.F. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 182: 69-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both dynactin, and dynein localize to the developing cleavage furrow during cytokinesis of cultured mammalian cells (28Karki S. LaMonte B. Holzbaur E.L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), suggesting an additional role for these proteins late in cell division. Dynactin has been localized to the midzone, perpendicular to the spindle axis, as well as to a ring surrounding the midbody (28Karki S. LaMonte B. Holzbaur E.L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 29Skop A.R White J.G. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1110-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that in dividing cells, dynactin may be associated with the membrane or underlying cortical region specifically at the cleavage furrow and midbody. Therefore, we used immunofluorescence to determine whether there was a similar localization of βIII spectrin in dividing cells. We used either an affinit"
https://openalex.org/W2004401468,"A relationship between life span and cellular glucose metabolism has been inferred from genetic manipulations and caloric restriction of model organisms. In this report, we have used the Snf1p glucose-sensing pathway ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae to explore the genetic and biochemical linkages between glucose metabolism and aging. Snf1p is a serine/threonine kinase that regulates cellular responses to glucose deprivation. Loss of Snf4p, an activator of Snf1p, extends generational life span whereas loss of Sip2p, a presumed repressor of the kinase, causes an accelerated aging phenotype. An annotated data base of global age-associated changes in gene expression in isogenic wild-type,sip2Δ, and snf4Δ strains was generated from DNA microarray studies. The transcriptional responses suggested that gluconeogenesis and glucose storage increase as wild-type cells age, that this metabolic evolution is exaggerated in rapidly agingsip2Δ cells, and that it is attenuated in longer-livedsnf4Δ cells. To test this hypothesis directly, we applied microanalytic biochemical methods to generation-matched cells from each strain and measured the activities of enzymes and concentrations of metabolites in the gluconeogenic, glycolytic, and glyoxylate pathways, as well as glycogen, ATP, and NAD+. The sensitivity of the assays allowed comprehensive biochemical profiling to be performed using aliquots of the same cell populations employed for the transcriptional profiling. The results provided additional evidence that aging in S. cerevisiae is associated with a shift away from glycolysis and toward gluconeogenesis and energy storage. They also disclosed that this shift is forestalled by two manipulations that extend life span, caloric restriction and genetic attenuation of the normal age-associated increase in Snf1p activity. Together, these findings indicate that Snf1p activation is not only a marker of aging but also a candidate mediator, because a shift toward energy storage over expenditure could impact myriad aspects of cellular maintenance and repair. A relationship between life span and cellular glucose metabolism has been inferred from genetic manipulations and caloric restriction of model organisms. In this report, we have used the Snf1p glucose-sensing pathway ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae to explore the genetic and biochemical linkages between glucose metabolism and aging. Snf1p is a serine/threonine kinase that regulates cellular responses to glucose deprivation. Loss of Snf4p, an activator of Snf1p, extends generational life span whereas loss of Sip2p, a presumed repressor of the kinase, causes an accelerated aging phenotype. An annotated data base of global age-associated changes in gene expression in isogenic wild-type,sip2Δ, and snf4Δ strains was generated from DNA microarray studies. The transcriptional responses suggested that gluconeogenesis and glucose storage increase as wild-type cells age, that this metabolic evolution is exaggerated in rapidly agingsip2Δ cells, and that it is attenuated in longer-livedsnf4Δ cells. To test this hypothesis directly, we applied microanalytic biochemical methods to generation-matched cells from each strain and measured the activities of enzymes and concentrations of metabolites in the gluconeogenic, glycolytic, and glyoxylate pathways, as well as glycogen, ATP, and NAD+. The sensitivity of the assays allowed comprehensive biochemical profiling to be performed using aliquots of the same cell populations employed for the transcriptional profiling. The results provided additional evidence that aging in S. cerevisiae is associated with a shift away from glycolysis and toward gluconeogenesis and energy storage. They also disclosed that this shift is forestalled by two manipulations that extend life span, caloric restriction and genetic attenuation of the normal age-associated increase in Snf1p activity. Together, these findings indicate that Snf1p activation is not only a marker of aging but also a candidate mediator, because a shift toward energy storage over expenditure could impact myriad aspects of cellular maintenance and repair. wild-type glucose 6- phosphate glucose 1-phosphate glucose phosphorylation rate 2-deoxyglucose AMP-activated protein kinase phosphate-buffered saline phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase Genetic studies in model organisms imply that changes in glucose and energy metabolism can alter life span (1Ewbank J.J.

De Vreese A. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1355-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an attractive model for studying how glucose and energy metabolism are linked to aging. Age-associated alterations in energy metabolism can be analyzed more readily in a unicellular eukaryote than in a multicellular organism with diverse specialized cell types (6Wolkow C.A. Kimura K.D. Lee M.S. Ruvkun G. Science. 2000; 290: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Mother yeast cells undergo replicative senescence, with different strains having characteristic mean and maximum life spans (7Muller I. Arch. Microbiol. 1971; 77: 20-25Google Scholar, 8Kennedy B.K. Austriaco Jr., N.R. Zhang J. Guarente L. Cell. 1995; 80: 485-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar).

Cell. 1996; 84: 633-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In addition, genetic studies suggest that changes in glucose metabolism affect replicative life span. For example, increased longevity occurs with mutations affecting the glucose-responsive cAMP-dependent protein kinase A pathway, hexokinase (catalyzing the first step in the glycolytic pathway), or the Snf1 pathway (10Lin S.J. Defossez P.A. Guarente L. Science. 2000; 289: 2126-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1469) Google Scholar, 11Ashrafi K. Lin S.S. Manchester J.K. Gordon J.I. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1872-1885PubMed Google Scholar).Snf1p is a serine/threonine kinase required for the normal cellular response to glucose starvation and represents the yeast homolog of AMP kinase, a mammalian cellular “fuel gauge” (12Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). Snf1p is incorporated into a complex that contains Snf4p, Sip1p, Sip2p, and Gal83p. When there is limited glucose, Snf4p activates Snf1p kinase, which phosphorylates a number of target proteins including transcriptional regulators of genes involved in alternative carbon source utilization, gluconeogenesis, and respiration (12Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). The best characterized of these transcription factors is Mig1p, which represses many glucose-repressed genes (13Klein C.J. Olsson L. Nielsen J. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Snf1p phosphorylation of Mig1p results in Mig1p accumulation in the cytoplasm and transcriptional derepression (14DeVit M.J. Johnston M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1231-1241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Mig1p undergoes progressive redistribution from the nucleus to the cytoplasm as wild-type (WT)1 cells age, consistent with a progressive generational increase in Snf1p activity (11Ashrafi K. Lin S.S. Manchester J.K. Gordon J.I. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1872-1885PubMed Google Scholar). Loss of the Snf1p activator Snf4p produces a 20% increase in life span, whereas forced expression of SNF1 produces rapid aging (11Ashrafi K. Lin S.S. Manchester J.K. Gordon J.I. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1872-1885PubMed Google Scholar). Loss of Sip2p also causes a rapid aging phenotype that appears to be related to increased Snf1p activity; cytoplasmic accumulation of Mig1p is augmented and the rapid aging phenotype is completely rescued bysnf4Δ (11Ashrafi K. Lin S.S. Manchester J.K. Gordon J.I. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1872-1885PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these findings suggest that Snf1p kinase inhibition (loss of Snf4p) extends life span, whereas kinase activation (loss of Sip2p) shortens life span. The effects of Snf1p kinase activation on life span must extend beyond its phosphorylation of Mig1p, because mig1Δ cells do not undergo rapid aging (11Ashrafi K. Lin S.S. Manchester J.K. Gordon J.I. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1872-1885PubMed Google Scholar).In this report, we have used three isogenic strains, WT,sip2Δ (rapid aging phenotype), and snf4Δ(extended life span phenotype), as models to explore further the link between glucose metabolism and aging. High density oligo-based microarrays were employed to compare first transcriptional responses as these cells aged. Microanalytic biochemical methods were then used to correlate observed transcriptional responses of genes involved in glucose and energy metabolism with the activities of several key enzymes and metabolites in the gluconeogenic and glycolytic pathways. Finally, because caloric restriction extends the life spans of diverse eukaryotes (10Lin S.J. Defossez P.A. Guarente L. Science. 2000; 289: 2126-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1469) Google Scholar, 15Jiang J.C. Jaruga E. Repnevskaya M.V. Jazwinski S.M.

Science. 1999; 285: 1390-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar), we compared glucose metabolism in calorically restricted and normally fed WT yeast as they aged. Our data indicate that aging in yeast is accompanied by a shift of glucose metabolism away from glycolysis and toward gluconeogenesis and energy storage. This shift is deferred by removing Snf4p or by caloric restriction.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrainsIsogenic strains YB332 (WT;S288CMATaNMT1ura3–52his3Δ200ade2–101lys2–801leu2 3, 112), YB810 (sip2::HIS3), and YB614 (snf4::HIS3) are described in Ref. 11Ashrafi K. Lin S.S. Manchester J.K. Gordon J.I. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1872-1885PubMed Google Scholar.Isolation of Young and Older Yeast Cell PopulationsThe sorting procedure is based on the finding that when surface proteins of a mother yeast cell are labeled with biotin, the daughter does not inherit the biotinylated proteins, because their surface is generated de novo at the budding site (9Smeal T. Claus J. Kennedy B. Cole F. Guarente L. Cell. 1996; 84: 633-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). This allows mothers to be isolated from their descendants by streptavidin-magnetic bead sorting. To obtain cells at generation 7–8, 2 × 108 cells were harvested from a mid-log phase culture of yeast grown in YPD at 30 °C. Cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS containing 16 mg of EZ-link Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC biotin (Pierce). Following gentle shaking for 15 min at 24 °C, unbound biotin was removed by washing cells four times in PBS (1 ml/wash). Cells were placed in 1 liter of YPD (2 or 0.5% glucose), grown at 30 °C to an A 600 of 0.8, recovered by centrifugation (8 min at 4,400 × g), resuspended in 35 ml of PBS containing streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads (PerSeptive Biosystems; final concentration, 70 μg/ml), and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Biotin-coated cells bound to magnetic beads were recovered with a magnetic sorter. After eight washes in ice-cold YPD, the average bud scar count of the sorted cell population was determined by staining an aliquot with fluorescent brightener 28 (Sigma) and counting bud scars under a fluorescence microscope. Generation 0–1 refers to the population of cells that remain after old cells are removed by magnetic sorting; on average, 50% of cells in this population are newly formed daughters and, 25% are mothers that have undergone one division.DNA Microarray AnalysisGeneration 0–1 and 7–8 cells were obtained from the same culture by magnetic bead sorting (n = 3 independent cultures/strain). Sorted young or old cells (∼5 × 107/sort) were immediately incubated in YPD at 25 °C for 20 min (temperature equilibration step), recovered by centrifugation, and washed three times in ice-cold PBS. Cell pellets were frozen in liquid N2, dried under vacuum, lysed by adding RLT buffer (RNeasy kit; Qiagen; 200 μl buffer/cell pellet), and RNA was purified (RNA binding column protocol from Qiagen). For each strain, equivalent amounts of RNA from generation-matched cells from the triple sorts were pooled. Two cRNA target sets were independently prepared from each RNA pool (20 μg of RNA/pool). Each set of cRNA targets was hybridized to duplicate high density oligonucleotide-based Ye98 GeneChips (Affymetrix; www.affymetrix.com) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The overall fluorescence intensity across each chip was scaled to a target intensity of 2500 using Affymetrix GeneChip software. Pairwise comparisons of expression levels in old versus young cells were performed for each strain. Differences of 2-fold or greater were considered significant if they met three criteria; the mRNA was called “present” by the GeneChip software, in both the difference was reported as “increased” or “decreased,” and the difference was observed in duplicate microarray hybridizations.Microanalytic Biochemical AssaysGeneral Comments about Enzyme CyclingThis sensitive, versatile, and well established analytic method (18Passoneau J.V. Lowry O.H. Enzymatic Analysis: A Practical Guide. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1993Crossref Google Scholar) allows the levels of enzymes, metabolites, and nucleotides to be measured through reactions that generate reduced or oxidized forms of NAD or NADP. The usefulness of employing NAD and NADP for analytic purposes has been described by Lowry and Passoneau (18Passoneau J.V. Lowry O.H. Enzymatic Analysis: A Practical Guide. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1993Crossref Google Scholar). This method was adapted forS. cerevisiae as outlined below.Preparation of Cellular ExtractsGeneration 0–1 and 7–8 cells were recovered by sorting at 4 °C. Cell number was defined by hemocytometer. Cells from each sort were divided into three aliquots of 107 cells each, one for RNA extraction (and subsequent DNA microarray profiling of gene expression), another for enzyme assay, and the other aliquot for measurement of cellular metabolites. Cells were incubated at 25 °C in YPD for 20 min, followed by three washes in PBS (4 °C). After the final wash, cell pellets were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and freeze-dried under vacuum for 4 days at −35 °C.To prepare lysates for assaying cellular enzyme activities, freeze-dried cells were incubated for 1 min at 25 °C in 1 ml of extraction buffer (20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.02% bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 25% glycerol, and 0.5% Triton X-100). The lysates were stored at −80 °C until further use. With the exception of fructose 6-phosphate kinase, which was measured in fresh lysates, all other enzymes studied were stable in lysates even after several cycles of freezing and thawing.To measure cellular metabolites, 500 μl of ice-cold 0.05m NaOH/1 mm EDTA was added to 107freeze-dried cells, and the extract was quickly divided into two 200-μl aliquots. 200 μl of 0.1 m HCl was added to one of the aliquots to generate an acid extract. The remaining alkali extract plus the acid extract were incubated at 60 °C for 30 min to destroy endogenous enzyme activities and pyridine nucleotides. The alkali extract was neutralized by adding 100 μl of a solution containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and 0.05 mHCl. The acid extract was neutralized with 100 μl of 0.4m Tris base. All extracts were stored at −80 °C prior to use.Enzyme CyclingThe low levels of some enzyme activities, metabolites, and nucleotides in the extracts required that NAD+ or NADP+, generated in the primary analytic reaction, be amplified through a series of cycling steps. For NAD+ or NADH, each cycling step involved coupled reactions (Scheme FSI). The scheme used for NADP+ and NADPH is shown in SchemeFSII. Cycling was performed in 10 × 75-mm borosilicate glass tubes. After an appropriate number of cycles were performed, the reaction was terminated by heating at 100 °C for 5 min. Once the samples were cooled to room temperature, 1 ml of indicator reagent was added to convert the cycled product (malate in the case of NAD+cycling (Scheme Figure FSIII, Figure FSIV), and 6-phosphogluconate in the case of the NADP+ cycling) to NADH or NADPH, respectively.Figure FSIIView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure FSIIIView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure FSIVView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The NAD+ cycling indicator step involved addition of 1 ml of malate reagent (50 mm amino-methylpropanol (pH 9.9), 5 mml-glutamate (pH 9.9), 0.2 mmNAD+, 5 μg/ml malic dehydrogenase (3000 units/mg protein; Sigma), and 2 μg/ml glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (200 units/mg; Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). The NADP cycling indicator step was initiated by adding 1 ml of 6-phosphogluconate reagent (50 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 7.0), 25 mm acetic acid, 1 mm EDTA, 30 mmammonium acetate, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm NADP+, and 2.5 μg/ml 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (20 units/mg; Sigma)).Indicator reactions were incubated for 10 min at 25 °C. The NADH generated from malate or the NADPH produced from 6-phosphogluconate was measured fluorimetrically (excitation at 365 nm, emission monitored at 460 nm).Some assays were performed in reaction volumes that were less than 10 μl. To prevent evaporation, these small volume reactions were placed under a mixture of 40% hexadecane and 60% mineral oil in a Teflon block that contained 50 μl-capacity wells.Care was taken to ensure that for each enzyme, metabolite, or nucleotide determination, product formation was linear with respect to the range of lysate or extract used. For each experiment, several types of reference standards were also analyzed. Standards consisting of either the nucleotide or metabolite of interest, or the product of the enzyme being assayed, were run in parallel with cell lysates or extracts. NAD+ or NADP+ standards were always added at the cycling step in a minus extract or minus lysate control to coincide with levels produced by the experimental reactions. A known amount of malate or 6-phosphogluconate, corresponding to the predicted concentration of pyridine nucleotide produced from the cycling reaction, was included as a third reference control. Details of the protocols for each yeast enzyme and metabolite surveyed in this study are presented as Supplemental Material.To define cell volume, aliquots from each sort of each strain were fixed in 4% glutaraldehyde and embedded in Polybed (PolyScience, Warrington, PA). 70 nm-thick sections were counter-stained with uranyl acetate and lead and viewed under a JOEL × 100 electron microscope. Cell diameters were measured (n = 30 cells/generation/sort), and the average cell volume was defined assuming a spheroidal shape. The volumes (in femtoliters) for generation 0–1 and 7–8 cells were as follows: WT (incubated in YPD containing 2% glucose), 22 ± 1.6 and 49 ± 7.2, respectively; calorically restricted WT (YPD/0.5% glucose), 21 ± 1.1 and 37 ± 4.8; sip2Δ (YPD/2% glucose), 134 ± 11.4 and 114 ± 10.9; snf4Δ (YPD/2% glucose) 26 ± 2.9 and 57 ± 5.4. In addition, volumes were determined for WT cells at various phases of growth in YPD (2% glucose) as follows: mid-log, 19.6 ± 1.6; early diauxic, 51.3 ± 5.7; late diauxic, 61.5 ± 6.6. These volumes were used to calculate concentrations of various metabolites.DISCUSSIONCombining DNA microarray-based transcriptional profiling with well established, but no longer commonly used, pyridine nucleotide-based microanalytic biochemical methods has provided a view of aging inS. cerevisiae as a metabolic evolution toward enhanced gluconeogenesis and augmented energy storage.The age-associated changes in glucose metabolism observed in S. cerevisiae may be conserved over the course of metazoan evolution. As noted in the Introduction, genetic studies in model organisms have implied that changes in glucose and energy metabolism can alter life span. For example, in Caenorhabditis elegans, increased longevity is produced by loss-of-function mutations affectingdaf-2, encoding a protein with homology to the insulin receptor, or the age-1 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase that functions immediately downstream of daf-2 in a signal transduction cascade (reviewed in Ref. 3Guarente L. Kenyon C. Nature. 2000; 408: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). An inactivating mutation in the Drosophila Indy gene, specifying a protein with sequence similarities to mammalian cotransporters involved in uptake of di- and tricarboxylic intermediates generated by the tricarboxylic acid cycle, doubles life span (4Rogina B. Reenan R.A. Nilsen S.P. Helfand S.L. Science. 2000; 290: 2137-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). In C. elegans a null allele ofClk-1, encoding a protein with homology to an activator of gluconeogenesis in S. cerevisiae (Cat5p), leads to life span extension (1Ewbank J.J. Barnes T.M. Lakowski B. Lussier M. Bussey H. Hekimi S. Science. 1997; 275: 980-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 2Arking R. Biology of Aging. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA1998: 417-420Google Scholar), a finding consistent with the correlation between reduced gluconeogenesis and increased life span we observed in yeast. Lee et al. (17Lee C.K. Klopp R.G. Weindruch R. Prolla T.A. Science. 1999; 285: 1390-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar) performed a DNA microarray-based survey of changes in gene expression in aging mouse skeletal muscle. A review of their published data set provides circumstantial evidence for an age-associated decrease in glycolysis (i.e. ≥2-fold drop in the levels of glucose 6-phosphate isomerase and α-enolase mRNAs) and an increase in glycogen synthesis (decrease in mRNA encoding IPP-2, an inhibitor of glycogen synthesis. These age-associated decreases in isomerase, enolase, and IPP-2 mRNAs were forestalled when mice were subjected to chronic caloric restriction (17Lee C.K. Klopp R.G. Weindruch R. Prolla T.A. Science. 1999; 285: 1390-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar).We have found that a prominent feature of the metabolic evolution of aging yeast cells is activation of the Snf1p kinase pathway. Evidence for this activation includes the following. First, Mig1p, a known substrate of Snf1p, undergoes relocalization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm as cells age. This correlates with the derepression of Mig1p-repressed genes defined by DNA microarray profiling of gene expression. sip2Δ cells undergo accelerated aging, precocious relocalization of Mig1p to the cytoplasm, and more pervasive derepression of Mig1p repressed genes. Inhibiting Snf1p activation by removing Snf4p delays Mig1p derepression and extends life span. Second, the biochemical responses of aging cells are entirely consistent with increased Snf1p kinase activity. The observed age-associated increase in glycogen accumulation correlates with the known Snf1p activation of Gac1p-Glc7p (activator of glycogen synthases; see Ref. 25Francois J. Parrou J.L. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 125-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Our finding that fructose 1,6 bisphosphatase activity rises in aging yeast cells is consistent with previous reports that Snf1p phosphorylation of another transcription factor, Sip4p, activates the gene encoding this key regulator of gluconeogenesis (FBP1; see Ref. 26Vincent O. Carlson M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7002-7008Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Snf1p activation has also been shown to inhibit fatty acid biosynthesis through its phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (12Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). Our biochemical profiling experiments provide evidence for increased fatty acid degradation in aging yeast cells, as manifested by increased glycoxylate cycle activity.The interaction between Snf1p and its activator, Snf4p, appears to be promoted as cellular glucose levels fall (27Lesage P. Yang X. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1921-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the age-associated increases in Snf1p kinase activity, gluconeogenesis, and glucose storage occur in absence of any decrease in cellular glucose concentrations (Fig. 3). This raises the as yet unanswered question of why these cells are responding as if they are glucose-deprived.The mammalian homolog of Snf1p is AMP-kinase (AMPK). The AMPK pathway is activated in response to various stresses, including glucose deprivation, heat shock, hypoxia, and exercise (12Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). Once activated, AMPK phosphorylates some of the same downstream targets that are recognized by Snf1p, including acetyl-CoA carboxylase and glycogen synthase (12Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). Moreover, both Snf1p and AMPK are activated by phosphorylation. Although the kinase that phosphorylates Snf1p has yet to be identified, it can be activated in vitro by the mammalian AMP-kinase kinase (12Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). Together, these observations suggest that it may be informative to assess the effects of aging on the activity of the AMPK pathway in various mammalian species.In summary, our studies indicate that Snf1p activation is not only a new marker of aging but may also be one of its mediators. A progressive shift toward energy storage, rather than energy expenditure, could have important consequences to myriad aspects of cellular function. The idea that we age because we become more “conservative” should be testable in genetically manipulatable multicellular eukaryotes and in humans, using the same transcriptional and biochemical profiling methods employed for S. cerevisiae. Genetic studies in model organisms imply that changes in glucose and energy metabolism can alter life span (1Ewbank J.J. Barnes T.M. Lakowski B. Lussier M. Bussey H. Hekimi S. Science. 1997; 275: 980-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 2Arking R. Biology of Aging. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA1998: 417-420Google Scholar, 3Guarente L. Kenyon C.

https://openalex.org/W2026633602,"Fibrillin-1 is a major constituent of the 10–12 nm extracellular microfibrils. Here we identify, characterize, and localize heparin/heparan sulfate-binding sites in fibrillin-1 and report on the role of such glycosaminoglycans in the assembly of fibrillin-1. By using different binding assays, we localize two calcium-independent heparin-binding sites to the N-terminal (Arg45–Thr450) and C-terminal (Asp1528–Arg2731) domains of fibrillin-1. A calcium-dependent-binding site was localized to the central (Asp1028–Thr1486) region of fibrillin-1. Heparin binding to these sites can be inhibited by a highly sulfated and iduronated form of heparan sulfate but not by chondroitin 4-sulfate, chondroitin 6-sulfate, and dermatan sulfate, demonstrating that the heparin binding regions represent binding domains for heparan sulfate. When heparin or heparan sulfate was added to cultures of skin fibroblasts, the assembly of fibrillin-1 into a microfibrillar network was significantly reduced. Western blot analysis demonstrated that this effect was not due to a reduced amount of fibrillin-1 secreted into the culture medium. Inhibition of the attachment of glycosaminoglycans to core proteins of proteoglycans by β-d-xylosides resulted in a significant reduction of the fibrillin-1 network. These studies suggest that binding of fibrillin-1 to proteoglycan-associated heparan sulfate chains is an important step in the assembly of microfibrils. Fibrillin-1 is a major constituent of the 10–12 nm extracellular microfibrils. Here we identify, characterize, and localize heparin/heparan sulfate-binding sites in fibrillin-1 and report on the role of such glycosaminoglycans in the assembly of fibrillin-1. By using different binding assays, we localize two calcium-independent heparin-binding sites to the N-terminal (Arg45–Thr450) and C-terminal (Asp1528–Arg2731) domains of fibrillin-1. A calcium-dependent-binding site was localized to the central (Asp1028–Thr1486) region of fibrillin-1. Heparin binding to these sites can be inhibited by a highly sulfated and iduronated form of heparan sulfate but not by chondroitin 4-sulfate, chondroitin 6-sulfate, and dermatan sulfate, demonstrating that the heparin binding regions represent binding domains for heparan sulfate. When heparin or heparan sulfate was added to cultures of skin fibroblasts, the assembly of fibrillin-1 into a microfibrillar network was significantly reduced. Western blot analysis demonstrated that this effect was not due to a reduced amount of fibrillin-1 secreted into the culture medium. Inhibition of the attachment of glycosaminoglycans to core proteins of proteoglycans by β-d-xylosides resulted in a significant reduction of the fibrillin-1 network. These studies suggest that binding of fibrillin-1 to proteoglycan-associated heparan sulfate chains is an important step in the assembly of microfibrils. epidermal growth factor bovine serum albumin calcium-binding calcium-binding EGF phosphate-buffered saline Microfibrils are supramolecular filaments, 10–12 nm in diameter, found in many extracellular matrices (1Low F.N.

However, for most of these ligands direct interaction studies with fibrillins are lacking, and it is not known how these components contribute to structure and function of microfibrils in tissues. The assembly of fibrillins into complex supramolecular tissue microfibrils is a multistep process. Several steps within the continuum of microfibrillar assembly have been described. One of the first steps in the assembly process is the oligomerization of fibrillin-1 into disulfide-bonded multimers, which occurs within a few hours after the secretion of fibrillin-1 from cells (13Reinhardt D.P.

It has not been demonstrated whether this process occurs in the extracellular space without the participation of cells or whether it is a cell-mediated process perhaps involving integrin receptors (14Pfaff M.

Godfrey M. Sakai L.Y. Pyeritz R.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 323: 152-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). However, it takes several weeks of culture for fibroblasts to produce the typical bead-on-a-string structures, discernible by electron microscopy (18Kielty C.M. Phillips J.E. Child A.H. Pope F.M. Shuttleworth C.A. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Tissue microfibrils do not appear as bead-on-a-string structures but as simple thread-like filaments (3Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Engvall E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for the morphological differences during the formation of microfibrils is obscure. Controversial models have been proposed for the arrangement of fibrillin-1 within assembled microfibrils, based on cross-linking patterns (19Qian R.-Q. Glanville R.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15841-15847Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), on the solution structure of epidermal growth factor (EGF)1 like modules (20Downing A.K. Knott V. Werner J.M.

Kielty C.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1045-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Many mutations in the fibrillin-1 protein lead to a heritable autosomal dominant disorder, the Marfan syndrome (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man number 154700), with major complications in the skeletal, the cardiovascular, and the ocular system (26Pyeritz R.E. Annu. Rev. Med. 2000; 51: 481-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The mutant fibrillin-1 is thought to exert a dominant negative effect on the structure or stability of microfibrils that precipitates the defects characteristic to Marfan syndrome, although the precise molecular pathogenetic pathway is not known. Central to these discussions are issues related to the effect of mutant fibrillin-1 molecules on the assembly of microfibrils. Are mutant fibrillin-1 molecules incorporated into microfibrils, where they may destabilize the microfibrils by proteolytic degradation (27Reinhardt D.P. Ono R.N. Notbohm H. Müller P.K.

Pulse-chase experiments have revealed that many fibroblast strains isolated from patients with Marfan syndrome deposit reduced amounts of fibrillin into the extracellular matrix, suggesting that many mutations in fibrillin-1 impair the ability of the molecules to assemble (28Milewicz D. Pyeritz R.E. Crawford E.S. Byers P.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar,29Aoyama T. Franke U. Dietz H.C. Furthmayr H. J. Clin.

Here, we report on the occurrence, the identification, the characterization, and the localization of heparin/heparan sulfate-binding sites in fibrillin-1. The interaction of fibrillin-1 with heparin/heparan sulfate has an important role in the assembly of microfibrils. Recombinant subdomains of human fibrillin-1 rF6, rF18 (23Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 12339-12345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) have been described in detail previously. The expression plasmid for rF6 has been designed to express the entire C-terminal half of fibrillin-1 (position 1487–2871; Ref. 23Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Pöschl E. Bächinger H.P. Gambee J.E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). However, it has been shown that the C-terminal unique domain of fibrillin-1 is proteolytically processed between position 2731 and 2732 by furin-type proteases (31Lönnqvist L. Reinhardt D. Sakai L. Peltonen L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 2039-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Consequently, rF6 spans amino acid residues 1487–2731 of fibrillin-1 and thus is almost identical to recombinant subdomain rF6H (position 1487–2725)2 except for a hexahistidine tag at the C-terminal end of rF6H. Similarly, the subdomain rF23 has been shown to be processed between positions 44 and 45, resulting in a truncated N-terminal end (7Reinhardt D.P. Sasaki T. Dzamba B.J. Keene D.R. Chu M.-L. Göhring W. Timpl R. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19489-19496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To produce a new recombinant subdomain (rF51), spanning calcium-binding (cb) EGF 6 to cbEGF 10 of fibrillin-1, human fibrillin-1 cDNA (32Corson G.M. Chalberg S.C. Dietz H.C. Charbonneau N.L. Sakai L.Y. Genomics. 1993; 17: 476-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with sense oligonucleotide 5′-CGTAGCTAGCAGACATTAACGAGTGTGAAACCC-3′ and antisense oligonucleotide 5′-ACCGCTCGAGCTATTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGAAGACAGATCCTTCCTGTGGC-3′ introducing a restriction site for NheI at the 5′ end and a restriction site for XhoI plus a sequence for a hexahistidine tag and a stop codon at the 3′ end. TheNheI-XhoI restricted 1048-base pair amplification product was ligated into the NheI-XhoI restricted plasmid pDNSP-rF162 in frame to the sequence for a signal peptide (23Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Pöschl E. Bächinger H.P. Gambee J.E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The correct sequence was verified by DNA sequencing. The resulting plasmid was termed pDNSP-rF51 and was used to recombinantly express the polypeptide rF51 with the amino acid sequence Ala-Pro-Leu-Ala-Asp613-Leu951(His)6. The first four amino acid residues (Ala-Pro-Leu-Ala) result from the cloning strategy. The methods for transfection, selection of stable clones, and production of recombinant medium were described in detail previously (33Fox J.W. Mayer U. Nischt R. Aumailley M. Reinhardt D. Wiedemann H. Mann K. Timpl R. Krieg T. Engel J. Chu M.-L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3137-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Purification of rF51 was performed as described for rF18 (23Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Pöschl E. Bächinger H.P. Gambee J.E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Correct folding of rF51 was verified by binding to monoclonal antibody 201 that is dependent on correct disulfide bonds. A polyclonal antiserum (α-rF6H) was produced according to standard procedures in rabbit using the recombinant C-terminal half of fibrillin-1 rF6H as antigen.2 The specificity of this antiserum was verified by immunoblotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays with rF6H, fibrillin-1 from cell culture medium, and other matrix proteins. The polyclonal antiserum B9543 was generated against an N-terminal half of fibrillin-1 and was characterized previously (34Pereira L. Andrikopoulos K. Tian J. Lee S.Y. Keene D.R. Ono R. Reinhardt D.P. Sakai L.Y. Jensen-Biery N. Bunton T. Dietz H.C. Ramirez F. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The B9543 antiserum as well as monoclonal antibodies 201 and 84 were a generous gift from Prof. Lynn Y. Sakai, Shriners Hospitals for Children, Portland, OR. Affinity chromatography on heparin-Sepharose columns (HiTrap Heparin HP, 1 ml;Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, and either 2 mmCaCl2 or 5 mm EDTA were typically performed at room temperature (∼20 °C) with highly purified recombinant fibrillin-1 subdomains (100–200 μg) applied to the columns in equilibration buffer at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min. After washing the columns with equilibration buffer, bound material was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0.05–1 m NaCl in 20 ml) in the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml generated by a Gradient Programmer GP-250 Plus and two P-500 pumps (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The flow-through and the eluted volume was continuously fractionated in 0.7-ml aliquots by a Frac-100 collector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), whereas the amount of protein in each fraction was monitored at 280 nm using a Ultrospec 3000 spectrophotometer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The NaCl concentrations in each individual fraction were determined by measurement of the conductivity and comparison to standards using a Microprocessor Conductivity Meter (LF3000; WTW, Germany). The correlation of the amount of individual recombinant fibrillin-1 subdomains with the absorbance recorded at 280 nm was verified by SDS-gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining. Solid phase binding assays of fibrillin-1 subdomains to heparin were performed on 96-well plates (MaxiSorp; Nalge Nunc International). Since plastic surfaces cannot be coated with soluble heparin or other glycosaminoglycans by adsorption due to their high negative charge, heparin coupled to bovine serum albumin (BSA-heparin; Sigma) was used for coating. Albumin adsorbs readily to plastic surfaces. The wells were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with 100 μl of BSA-heparin (20 μg/ml) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl. All subsequent steps were performed at room temperature (∼20 °C). The wells were washed 3 times with 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 and either 2 mm CaCl2 or 10 mmEDTA (washing buffer). Blocking of nonspecific binding sites was achieved with incubation of the wells for 1–2 h with 100 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk and either 2 mm CaCl2 or 10 mm EDTA (binding buffer). The wells were incubated with serial dilutions (1:2; 100 μl each) of the fibrillin-1 subdomains starting at 75 μg/ml for 2 h, washed 3 times with washing buffer, and incubated for 1 h with 100 μl of polyclonal antiserum B9543 (1:250, diluted in binding buffer) for rF18, rF23, rF45, and rF51 or α-rF6H (1:250, diluted in binding buffer) for rF6H. After washing 3 times, the wells were incubated with 100 μl of goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:800 diluted in binding buffer; Bio-Rad) for 1 h and washed again. The color reaction of the assay was performed with 1 mg/ml 5-aminosalicylic acid (Sigma) in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 0.045% (v/v) H2O2 (100 μl/well) for 3–4 min and stopped by adding 2 m NaOH (100 μl/well). Color yields were determined at 490 nm using a Microplate EL310 Autoreader (Bio-Tek Instruments). For inhibition assays, an identical procedure was employed except the following alterations. The recombinant subdomains were used at fixed concentrations of 20 μg/ml for rF6H and rF18, or, depending on the experiment, 20–30 μg/ml rF23 in order to produce an absorption at 490 nm of ∼0.5–0.8 after 3–4 min of color reaction. The binding and washing buffers used always contained 2 mmCaCl2. Heparin, chondroitin 4-sulfate, chondroitin 6-sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and BSA-heparin (all from Sigma), as well as heparan sulfate 2 and heparan sulfate 6 were added as inhibitors in serial dilutions (1:3) at concentrations indicated in individual experiments. Heparan sulfate 2 and 6 preparations were kindly provided by Prof. Anders Malmström, University of Lund, Sweden. These preparations were characterized in detail previously as HS2 and HS6, respectively (35Arroyo-Yanguas Y. Cheng F. Isaksson A. Fransson L.-Å. Malmström A. Westergren-Thorsson G. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). All cell culture experiments were performed with normal human skin fibroblasts grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. For inhibition studies with glycosaminoglycans, confluent fibroblasts were trypsinized and seeded at 7.5 × 104 cells/well of a 8-well chamber slide (Permanox; Nalge Nunc International) in a total volume of 0.5 ml together with serial dilutions of heparin, heparan sulfate 6, and BSA-heparin at concentrations indicated in individual experiments. During the entire cultivation period, no differences in the morphology of the cells or in the cell numbers were observed. After 5 days, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 70% (v/v) methanol, 30% (v/v) acetone for 5 min, and rehydrated in PBS. After blocking of nonspecific binding sites with normal goat serum (1:10 diluted in PBS; Dako) for 30 min, the wells were incubated with α-rF6H antiserum against fibrillin-1 (1:250 diluted in PBS) for 1 h followed by washing three times with PBS. After incubation with a goat anti-rabbit fluorescein conjugate (diluted 1:200 in PBS; Jackson ImmunoResearch), the fibrillin-1 network was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy with a Axioplan2 microscope (Zeiss). Digital images were recorded using a 3CCD color video camera (Sony) and the AxioVision 2.0 software (Zeiss). For inhibition studies with β-d-xylosides, the fibroblasts were first grown to confluency in the presence of 1 mm 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-xylopyranoside (Sigma) and 1 mm p-nitrophenyl β-d-xylopyranoside (Sigma). The cells were trypsinized and seeded at 5 × 104 cells/well of an 8-well chamber slide in a total volume of 0.5 ml together with 0.125 mm 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-xylopyranoside and 0.125 mm p-nitrophenyl β-d-xylopyranoside. Since the β-d-xylosides were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, the final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide in the cell culture wells was 0.05% (v/v). To monitor potential toxic effects, the control without β-d-xylosides was supplemented with 0.06% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide. The formation of the fibrillin-1 network was analyzed as described above. Normal human skin fibroblasts were seeded at 5 × 105 cells/3.8-cm2 plate (12-well plates; Nalge Nunc International) in the presence of 0–4 mg/ml heparin. The cells were grown confluent for 1 day, washed twice with PBS, and incubated with 2 ml serum-free culture medium including 0–4 mg/ml heparin for 3 days. In the presence and absence of heparin, no differences in the morphologies of the cells were observed. After harvesting and filtrating (0.22 μm pore size) the conditioned medium, the proteins were precipitated from 1-ml aliquots with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The non-reduced samples were analyzed by a standard Western blotting procedure using monoclonal antibodies (∼10 μg/ml) 201 to detect fibrillin-1 and 84 to detect fibronectin. Previously, it has been shown by others (15Sakamoto H. Broekelmann T. Cheresh D.A. Ramirez F. Rosenbloom J. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4916-4922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) that denatured (6 m guanidine HCl) and reduced fibrillin, isolated from fetal bovine ligamentum nuchae, bound to heparin-Sepharose. Since it was not clear whether this binding represented an authentic binding interaction or whether it was conferred by the reduced and denatured state of fibrillin, binding of native authentic fibrillin-1 to heparin was tested. Conditioned medium produced by skin fibroblasts was incubated with immobilized heparin in a solid phase assay. A specific antiserum was used to detect fibrillin-1, which bound in a dose-dependent manner to heparin (Fig.1). This result clearly established that authentic non-denatured fibrillin-1 has binding affinity to heparin. To examine the fibrillin-1/heparin interaction in more detail, overlapping recombinant subdomains of fibrillin-1 were tested in heparin-Sepharose affinity experiments and in solid phase assays with immobilized heparin. An overview of the recombinant subdomains of fibrillin-1 used in this study is shown in Fig.2. In heparin-Sepharose affinity binding experiments various fibrillin-1 subdomains showed distinctive binding characteristics (Fig. 3). The N-terminal subdomain rF23 (position 45–489) bound to heparin in the presence of calcium and in the presence of EDTA. NaCl concentrations to elute bound rF23 were in the range of 170–480 mm NaCl in the calcium-containing buffer and ∼300–370 mm NaCl in the EDTA-containing buffer. Fragment rF45 (position 451–1027) showed no binding in the presence of calcium and only very minor binding in the presence of EDTA. Fragment rF51 (position 613–951) did not bind under any condition (not shown). The central fragment rF18 (position 910–1527) bound to heparin-Sepharose in the presence of calcium. However, in the presence of EDTA, binding of rF18 was virtually abolished. About 375–470 mm NaCl displaced rF18 from the heparin-Sepharose under calcium conditions. The C-terminal half rF6 (position 1487–2731) bound to some extent (∼34–35%) in the presence of calcium as well as in the presence of EDTA. About 110–310 mm NaCl was necessary to displace rF6 from the heparin-Sepharose in calcium-containing buffer and ∼200–375 mm NaCl in EDTA-containing buffer. In summary, the NaCl concentrations used to displace the fibrillin-1 subdomains from heparin-Sepharose were above the physiological ionic strength indicating that these interactions potentially occur in tissues.Figure 3Mapping of heparin-binding sites in fibrillin-1 by affinity chromatography. Recombinant polypeptides (see Fig. 2) were chromatographed in a CaCl2-containing or in an EDTA-containing buffer using heparin-Sepharose affinity columns. The presence of protein in the fractions was monitored at 280 nm (solid lines). Bound material was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (dotted lines).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A solid phase binding assay was used to further confirm these binding data, whereby various recombinant fibrillin-1 subdomains were used in the soluble phase with immobilized heparin (Fig.4). Saturable binding profiles in the presence of calcium were observed for rF6H, rF18, and rF23, whereas rF45 and rF51 showed no or only very minor binding (Fig.4 A). When the binding tests were performed in the presence of EDTA, the binding of rF18 to heparin was significantly reduced, whereas binding of rF23 and rF6H did remain on similar levels (Fig.4 B). Taking the overlapping regions of the recombinant polypeptides into account, three regions with heparin binding affinity within the fibrillin-1 molecule have been identified as follows: one calcium-dependent binding region in the center of the molecule (position 1028–1486) and two calcium-independent binding regions, one at the N-terminal end (position 45–450) and one within the C-terminal half (position 1528–2731). Although heparin is not a component of extracellular matrices, it initially was used in this study because of its structural similarity with other glycosaminoglycans that can be found in the extracellular matrix. Subsequently, it was tested whether glycosaminoglycans such as various forms of chondroitin sulfates and heparan sulfates can compete with heparin binding of the fibrillin-1 subdomains rF6H, rF18, and rF23 (Fig. 5). Heparin itself inhibited the interaction between all three subdomains with immobilized heparin (Fig.5 A). These data demonstrate that the observed interactions are specific. The amounts of heparin that resulted in 50% inhibition (IC50 value) were in a range of 770–1730 μg/ml (51–115 μm). Chondroitin-4-sulfate (Fig. 5 B), dermatan sulfate (Fig. 5 C), and chondroitin 6-sulfate (Fig.5 D) had none or very minor inhibitory effects on the interaction of all three recombinant fibrillin-1 subdomains with immobilized heparin. On the other hand, inhibition with the highly sulfated and iduronated heparan sulfate 6 resulted in inhibition of the heparin interaction with all three fibrillin-1 subdomains (Fig. 5 E). The IC50 values for heparan sulfate 6 were in a range between 235 and 720 μg/ml (12–36 μm), slightly lower than what has been observed with heparin as inhibitor. The high sulfation and/or iduronation pattern of heparan sulfate 6 was necessary for binding since the lower sulfated and iduronated heparan sulfate 2 did not have any inhibitory activity (Fig. 5 F). These experiments demonstrate that the identified heparin binding regions in fibrillin-1 represent unique binding sites for a highly sulfated form of heparan sulfate but not for various forms of chondroitin sulfates. However, these results do not exclude the possibility that binding sites other than those for heparin/heparan sulfate exist in the fibrillin-1 molecule for binding to chondroitin sulfates. It is known that clustering of binding sites within a narrow physical region can enhance binding strengths by several magnitudes (36Engel J. Kammerer R.A. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Glycosaminoglycans attached to the protein core of proteoglycans are almost always clustered. To mimic the clustered glycosaminoglycan pattern on proteoglycans, we used heparin coupled to bovine serum albumin (∼4–5 heparin chains per molecule albumin) in inhibition assays instead of soluble heparin (Fig.6). For the interactions between the recombinant fragments rF6H, rF18, rF23 and heparin, the IC50 values of clustered heparin (BSA-heparin) were in the range of 0.07–0.77 μg/ml (2–26 nm heparin), which is 4400–25,500-fold less as compared with non-clustered soluble heparin (Fig. 5 A and Fig. 6). These data demonstrate that the affinity of heparin significantly increases when the molecules are presented as clusters to the fibrillin-1 subdomains, as compared with non-clustered heparin molecules. It further suggests that potential binding of fibrillin-1 to glycosaminoglycan chains of proteoglycans are of hig"

Previous work has shown that NE induces interleukin-8 (IL-8) gene expression and protein secretion in bronchial epithelial cells. We sought to determine the intracellular mechanisms by which NE up-regulates IL-8 in bronchial epithelial cells. The data show that stimulation of 16HBE14o− cells with NE induced IL-8 protein production and gene expression. Both responses were abrogated by actinomycin D, indicating that regulation is at the transcriptional level. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that nuclear factor κB (NFκB) was activated in 16HBE14o− cells stimulated with NE. Western blot analysis demonstrated that activation of NFκB by NE was preceded by phosphorylation and degradation of IκB proteins, principally IκBβ. In addition, we observed that interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) was degraded in 16HBE14o− cells stimulated with NE. Quantification of IL-8 reporter gene activity by luminometry demonstrated that dominant negative MyD88 (MyD88Δ) or TRAF-6 (TRAF-6Δ) inhibited IL-8 reporter gene expression in response to NE. Furthermore, MyD88Δ inhibited NE-induced IRAK degradation. These results show that NE induces IL-8 gene up-regulation in bronchial epithelial cells through an IRAK signaling pathway involving both MyD88 and TRAF-6, resulting in degradation of IκBβ and nuclear translocation of NFκB. These findings may have implications for therapeutic treatments in the cystic fibrosis condition.

Although airway obstruction and infection are clearly major pathogenic factors in CF, there is increasing recognition that the pulmonary inflammatory response is of key importance (3Boat T.F.

Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L33-L41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Even in young infants with CF, studies have demonstrated elevated numbers of neutrophils and increased neutrophil products on the respiratory epithelial surface (4Birrer P. McElvaney N.G. Rudeberg A.

While neutrophil accumulation on the airway epithelial surface is an essential component of normal host defense against infection, when exaggerated it can cause progressive damage to the bronchial epithelium. In CF, this damage is mediated most significantly by neutrophil elastase (NE), a powerful proteolytic enzyme released by activated neutrophils (10Nakamura H. Yoshimura K. McElvaney N.G. Crystal R.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1478-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 11McElvaney N.G. Crystal R.G. Crystal R.G. West J.B. Barnes P.F. Weibel E. The Lung. Lippincott-Raven, New York1997: 2205-2218Google Scholar). NE can impair local host defense mechanisms by degrading many extracellular matrix molecules and adversely affecting mucociliary clearance (5Konstan M.W. Hilliard K.A. Norvell T.M. Berger M. Am. J.

Lippincott-Raven, New York1997: 2205-2218Google Scholar). NE also cleaves immunoglobulin and complement proteins, thereby reducing phagocytosis and killing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by neutrophils (12Breuer R. Christensen T.G. Niles R.M. Stone P.J.

In CF epithelial lining fluid (ELF), NE has been identified as a major signal capable of inducing the expression of IL-8 in bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) (10Nakamura H. Yoshimura K. McElvaney N.G. Crystal R.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1478-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). IL-8, a member of the CXC chemokine family, is a potent activator and chemoattractant of neutrophils (16Leonard E.J. Yoshimura T. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1990; 2: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and has been shown to be expressed in BECs in response to a variety of stimuli (17Baggiolini M. Walz A. Kunkel S.L. J. Clin.

In CF, IL-8-induced recruitment of additional neutrophils to the airways results in further release of NE and additional induction of IL-8 gene expression by bronchial epithelial cells, thereby perpetuating a chronic cycle of respiratory inflammation (10Nakamura H. Yoshimura K. McElvaney N.G. Crystal R.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1478-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). In vivo studies have demonstrated that NE induction of IL-8 gene expression in the CF respiratory epithelial surface and subsequent neutrophil-dominated inflammation may be attenuated by NE inhibitors (20McElvaney N.G. Nakamura H. Birrer P. Hébert C.A. Wong W.L. Alphonso M. Baker J.B. Catalano M.A. Crystal R.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1296-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), demonstrating a new potential therapeutic target for the respiratory manifestations of CF. While NE appears to be a major signal for CF bronchial epithelial IL-8 gene expression, the intracellular mechanisms of this response are unknown. NE increases the relative rate of transcription of the IL-8 gene in BECs but does not influence the IL-8 mRNA transcript stability, suggesting that the transcriptional process dominates in the response (10Nakamura H. Yoshimura K. McElvaney N.G. Crystal R.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1478-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). With this as background, we have elucidated the intracellular signaling pathways involved in NE induction of IL-8 gene expression in BECs. The data demonstrate that as previously shown BECs are capable of producing IL-8 protein and expressing the IL-8 gene, and these responses are up-regulated by NE. In addition, we have demonstrated that NE-stimulated IL-8 gene expression results in increased activation of NFκB in BECs via a pathway involving IκBβ. We have also identified that interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) (21Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 22Martin M.

In summary, these data show that NE activates IL-8 gene expression through a MyD88/IRAK/TRAF-6-dependent pathway, a breakthrough that may enable better targeting of novel anti-inflammatory therapy for the CF condition. 16HBE14o− cells, an SV-40-transformed human bronchial epithelial cell line (31Cozens A.L.

The cells were cultured at 37 °C in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Biowhittaker, Berkshire, United Kingdom) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The surface of the culture dishes was coated with a mixture of fibronectin (1 mg/ml; Sigma), collagen (Vitrogen 100, 2.9 mg/ml; Collagen Corp., Palo Alto, CA), and bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml; Sigma). To eliminate the effect of different factors in the growth media and any effect contributed by trypsin, 24 h prior to agonist treatment cells were washed twice with 1× PBS and placed under serum-free conditions. Before agonist treatment, cells were again washed twice with 1× PBS and covered with serum-free media for 1 h. Neutrophil elastase was purchased from Elastin Products Company, Inc. (Owensville, MO). Recombinant human TNFα and secretory leukoprotease inhibitor (rSLPI) were purchased from R&D Systems (Oxon, UK), and actinomycin D, MeO-Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-chloromethyl ketone, and PMSF were all purchased from Sigma. HBE cells were seeded at 1 × 106 on coated 24-well plates (16-mm diameter) 24 h before stimulation. Cells were left untreated or were stimulated with different doses of NE for different time periods or with TNFα (10 ng/ml, 3 h). In some experiments, cells were pretreated with actinomycin D (10 μg/ml) for 1 h before NE or TNFα treatment. The dose dependence studies with NE were carried out using 0–50 nm purified NE for 4 h. The time course studies used 10 nm NE and subsequent incubation of the HBE cells for 0–24 h. IL-8 protein concentrations in the cell supernatants were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (R&D Systems). Following the removal of supernatants, the cells were lysed using RIPA buffer (1% Igepal CA-630, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 1% PMSF (10 mg/ml), 1% sodium orthovanadate (100 mm), and 3% aprotinin) (Sigma), and protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar). Cell viability assessed by trypan blue exclusion was >95% in all studies. Total RNA was isolated from 1 × 106 HBE cells that had been left untreated or been stimulated with NE (10 nm, 4 h) or TNFα (10 ng/ml, 3 h) ± actinomycin D (10 μg/ml, 1 h) using TRI reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For both quantitative LightCyclerTM (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) PCRs and semiquantitative RT-PCRs, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA with an oligo(dT)15primer using the first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described in the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA amplifications were done by quantitative PCR using the light cycler and the double-stranded DNA binding dye SYBR Green 1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The samples were continuously monitored during the PCR, and fluorescence was acquired every 0.1 °C. PCR mixtures contained 0.5 μm of either GAPDH- (MWG Biotech, Milton Keynes, UK) or IL-8-specific primers (BIOSOURCE). The samples were denatured at 95 °C for 10 min followed by 45 cycles of annealing and extension at 95 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 5 s, and 72 °C for 10 s. The melting curves were obtained at the end of amplification by cooling the samples to 65 °C for 15 s followed by further cooling to 40 °C for 30 s. Serial 10-fold dilutions were prepared from known quantities of GAPDH and IL-8 PCR products, which were then used as standards to plot against the unknown samples. Quantification of data was analyzed using the LightCyclerTM analysis software, and values were normalized to GAPDH expression. In semiquantitative RT-PCR, the integrity of RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis was verified by PCR by measuring the amounts of GAPDH cDNA in each sample using GAPDH-specific primers. PCR mixtures contained 10× reaction buffer (Promega, Madison, WI), 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1.25 units of Taqpolymerase, and 0.2 mm of each dNTP (Promega). Thermocycling conditions for IL-8 cDNA were 95 °C for 5 min, 35 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. Twenty cycles were used to amplify the more abundant GAPDH cDNA. A final extension step of 72 °C for 10 min was followed by resolution of the 227-base pair IL-8 products and the 211-base pair GAPDH products on a 1.5% Tris borate-EDTA agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide (Sigma). IL-8 PCR products were quantified by densitometry using the GeneGenius Gel Documentation and Analysis System (Cambridge, UK) and Syngene GeneSnap and GeneTools software. HBE cells (1–4 × 106/ml) were seeded on coated six-well plates (34-mm diameter) 24 h before stimulation. Cells were activated with NE (10 nm) or TNFα (10 ng/ml) for different time periods ± actinomycin D (10 μg/ml, 1 h), and nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were isolated. Briefly cells were washed and resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold PBS and kept on ice for 5 min. Cells were lifted from plates with a cell scraper and pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) (Sigma). Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and then lysed for 10 min on ice in 20 μl of hypotonic buffer containing 0.1% Igepal CA-630. Lysates were centrifuged as before, and the cytoplasmic extract was removed. The remaining nuclear pellet was lysed in 15 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm PMSF) (Sigma) for 15 min on ice. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, nuclear extracts were removed into 35 μl of storage buffer (10 mmHepes (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol). Protein concentrations of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were determined (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar), and extracts were stored at −80 °C until required for use. Nuclear extracts (5 μg of protein) were incubated with 10,000 cpm of a 22-base pair oligonucleotide containing the NFκB consensus sequence (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) that previously had been labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (10 mCi/mmol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). Incubations were performed for 30 min at room temperature in binding buffer (4% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mg/ml nuclease-free bovine serum albumin) and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Sigma). In some experiments, unlabeled mutant or wild-type oligonucleotides or antibodies to p50, p65, or c-Rel (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to the extracts before incubation with the labeled oligonucleotide. All incubations were subjected to electrophoresis on native 4% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels that were subsequently dried, analyzed on a Molecular Dynamics Storm 820 Phosphorimagery Scanner (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for quantification, and autoradiographed. Cytoplasmic extracts (10 μg of protein) were separated by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Sigma) in 20 mm Tris, 150 mm glycine, 0.01% SDS, and 20% (v/v) methanol at 75 mA for 2 h using a semidry electrophoretic blotting system. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 0.2% I-Block (Tropix, Bedford, MA) and PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma). Immunoreactive proteins were detected by incubating the membrane with specific antibodies (IκBα and IκBβ from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and IRAK from Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Following six 5-min washes with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, immunoreactive proteins were detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Promega) (IRAK and IκBα) or goat anti-rabbit IgG (Tropix) (IκBβ) and CDP-Star chemiluminescent substrate solution (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To construct the IL-8 luciferase reporter plasmid, the human IL-8 promoter was PCR-amplified using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, Cambridge, UK) from genomic DNA with 5′-GCACTCGAGTAACCCAGGCATTATT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCTAAGCTTAGTGCTCCGGTGGCTTTT-3′ (reverse) and was cloned on a XhoI-HindIII fragment (underlined) into pGL3-PV (Promega). HBE cells were seeded at 5 × 105 on coated six-well plates 24 h before transfection. Transfections were performed with TransFast Transfection Reagent (Promega) in a 1:1 ratio according to the manufacturer's instructions using 500 ng of IL-8 luciferase and 500 ng of either pRK5, TRAF-6Δ, TRAF-2Δ (a gift from Tularik, San Francisco, CA), pCDNA3, or MyD88Δ (a gift from M. Muzio (26Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar, 27Muzio M. Natoli G. Saccani S. Levrero M. Mantovani A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 2097-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar)). Uniform transfection efficiencies were achieved by initially optimizing transfection conditions using a constitutive luciferase expression vector, pGL3-control (Promega). Transfections were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were then supplemented with additional growth medium (4 ml/well) for 48 h at 37 °C before being left untreated or stimulated with NE or TNF as indicated. Cells were lysed with Reporter Lysis buffer (Promega) (250 μl/well), protein concentrations were determined (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar), and IL-8 reporter gene activity was quantified by luminometry (Wallac Victor2, 1420 multilabel counter) using the Promega luciferase assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reporter gene expression was expressed as light units/μg of total protein. Data were analyzed with the GraphPad Prism 3.0 software package (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. and were compared by Mann-Whitney test or analysis of variance with post hoc analysis. Differences were considered significant when the p value was ≤0.05. Basal and NE-induced IL-8 protein levels in cell supernatants from HBE cells were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. HBE cells produced a mean basal level of IL-8 of 267 ± 17 pg/mg of protein. Time course and dose-response experiments (data not shown) demonstrated that 10 nm NE for 4 h induced maximal IL-8 protein production from HBE cells, increasing IL-8 levels to 538 ± 24 pg/mg of protein (p ≤ 0.001) and confirming a previous report using a Bet1A cell line (10Nakamura H. Yoshimura K. McElvaney N.G. Crystal R.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1478-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). It was not feasible to investigate whether doses higher than 10 nm NE could further potentiate IL-8 protein production because at higher concentrations NE degrades IL-8 protein (33Leavell K.J. Peterson M.W. Gross T.J. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1997; 61: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and renders the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay inaccurate. NE did not induce apoptosis in HBE cells at doses up to 50 nm NE over 4 h, and the cells retained >90%viability (data not shown). Control TNFα stimulations (10 ng/ml for 3 h) increased IL-8 protein to 4134 ± 125 pg/mg of protein (p ≤ 0.007). Preincubation of NE with the synthetic serine protease inhibitor PMSF (1 μm), a recombinant form of the naturally occurring serine protease inhibitor, rSLPI (500 nm), or the specific NE inhibitor MeO-Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-chloromethyl ketone (1 μm) abolished its ability to induce IL-8 production (Fig.1 A) (p < 0.005, analysis of variance). This indicated that the elastase activity of NE is required for IL-8 up-regulation. In Fig. 1 B IL-8 gene expression in response to NE and TNFα was measured in HBE cells by quantitative LightCyclerTMPCRs and also by semiquantitative RT-PCRs using IL-8-specific primers and comparison with expression of GAPDH mRNA. To evaluate whether NE increased IL-8 by a transcriptional mechanism, HBE cells were pretreated with actinomycin D (10 μg/ml, 1 h). Real time RT-PCR demonstrated that in HBE cells, NE induced a 4-fold increase in IL-8 mRNA that was inhibited by actinomycin D pretreatment (p ≤ 0.05) (Fig. 1 B). TNF strongly induced IL-8 mRNA, an effect that was also blocked by actinomycin D (p ≤ 0.02). Resolution of the semiquantitative RT-PCR samples on a 1.5% Tris borate-EDTA agarose gel qualified the real time RT-PCR data. Actinomycin D also significantly decreased NE- and TNFα-induced IL-8 protein levels to lower than basal levels (171 ± 21 pg/mg of protein (p ≤ 0.0001) and 191 ± 11 pg/mg of protein (p ≤ 0.0001), respectively). The transcription factor NFκB regulates IL-8 gene expression (34Mukaida N. Mahe Y. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21128-21133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NFκB activation in nuclear extracts from HBE cells was measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Cells were left untreated or were stimulated with either NE or TNFα. Time course studies (data not shown) demonstrated that 10 nm NE induced maximum NFκB activation at 5 min, while TNFα (10 ng/ml) induced a similar effect at 10 min. NFκB nuclear translocation was increased 3- and 4-fold compared with control for NE and TNFα, respectively, as measured by phosphorimagery (Fig.2 A). Concomitant Western blotting of cytoplasmic extracts was performed using anti-IκBα and anti-IκBβ antibodies. Stimulation with either NE or TNFα led to degradation of IκBβ. TNF also degraded IκBα, however, NE had only a modest effect on IκBα degradation. In Fig. 2 B competition studies with unlabeled mutant and wild-type NFκB probes demonstrated that NE activated NFκB specifically. Antisera to NFκB components identified the subunit composition of the NE-induced NFκB complexes as heterodimers of p50 and p65 but not c-Rel (Fig. 2 C). Given our interest in Toll/IL-1 receptor signaling (24O'Neill L.A.J. Greene C. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1998; 63: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 25Greene C. O'Neill L.A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we examined a role for IRAK in the activation of NFκB in response to NE. Cytoplasmic extracts from control HBE cells or cells stimulated with either NE (10 nm, 5 min) or TNFα (10 ng/ml, 10 min) were Western blotted to measure IRAK degradation (Fig.3). An immunoreactive band of 80 kDa was detected in extracts from control cells. This was degraded following stimulation with NE but not TNFα, implicating IRAK in the NE pathway. To further elucidate signaling events activated in response to stimulation with NE, IL-8 promoter activity using an IL-8 promoter luciferase reporter gene was measured in HBE cells. NE time course (data not shown) and dose-response studies demonstrated that NE stimulation (50 nm, 4 h) induced optimal IL-8 promoter activity (Fig.4 A) and indicated that increasing doses of NE can potentiate IL-8 expression. However, at higher doses (100 nm) NE caused cell detachment and necrosis and thereby prevented further IL-8 promoter activity. The induction of IL-8 promoter activity was significantly down-regulated by transfection of HBE cells with dominant negative TRAF-6 (TRAF-6Δ) but not dominant negative TRAF-2 (TRAF-2Δ) (Fig.4 B), indicating that TRAF-6, but not TRAF-2, is a component of the NE/IL-8 signaling cascade. TNFα (10 ng/ml, 3 h) also increased IL-8 promoter activity. The TNFα effect was not affected by transfection with TRAF-6Δ but was significantly inhibited by TRAF-2Δ (p ≤ 0.0001). To elucidate additional upstream components in the NE/IL-8 signaling pathway in HBE cells, the effect of dominant negative MyD88 (MyD88Δ) on NE-induced IRAK degradation was determined (Fig.5 A). HBE cells were left untreated or were stimulated with NE (10 nm, 5 min) in the absence or presence of MyD88Δ. Western blotting using an anti-IRAK antibody showed, as before, that NE could induce IRAK degradation. However, this effect was blocked by MyD88Δ, indicating that MyD88 is positioned upstream from IRAK and both components are involved in intracellular events activated by NE. This result was further verified in Fig. 5 B by measuring the effect of MyD88Δ on IL-8 promoter activity in HBE cells in response to NE. IL-8 reporter gene activity was significantly up-regulated in HBE cells following NE stimulation. However, this response was inhibited when the cells were co-transfected with MyD88Δ (p < 0.0001), providing further evidence for the involvement of MyD88 in the NE/IL-8 signaling pathway. W"
https://openalex.org/W1516409823,"SPA1 is a phytochrome A (phyA)-specific signaling intermediate that acts as a light-dependent repressor of photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis seedlings. It contains a WD-repeat domain that shows high sequence similarity to the WD-repeat region of the constitutive repressor of light signaling, COP1. Here, using yeast two-hybrid and in vitro interaction assays, we show that SPA1 strongly and selectively binds to COP1. Domain mapping studies indicate that the putative coiled-coil domain of SPA1 is necessary and sufficient for binding to COP1. Conversely, similar deletion analyses of the COP1 protein suggest that SPA1 interacts with the presumed coiled-coil domain of COP1. To further investigate SPA1 function in the phyA signaling pathway, we tested whether SPA1, like COP1, mediates changes in gene expression in response to light. We show that spa1 mutations increase the photoresponsiveness of certain light-regulated genes within 2 h of light treatment. Taken together, the results suggest that SPA1 may function to link the phytochrome A-specific branch of the light signaling pathway to COP1. Hence, our data provide molecular support for the hypothesis that COP1 is a convergence point for upstream signaling pathways dedicated to individual photoreceptors.

Sunlight, the primary source of energy for plants, is one of the most important environmental factors and is perceived by plants through the actions of several photoreceptors (1Kendrick R.E. Kronenberg G.H.M. Photomorphogenesis in Plants. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994Crossref Google Scholar). The members of the phytochrome photoreceptor family monitor the red (660 nm) and far-red (730 nm) region of the electromagnetic spectrum and control light responses such as seed germination, deetiolation, shade avoidance, and the induction of flowering. There is evidence for differential activities among members, with phytochrome A (phyA)1sensing mainly continuous far-red light (FRc) signals and phytochrome B (phyB) controlling responses to continuous red light (Rc) (1Kendrick R.E. Kronenberg G.H.M. Photomorphogenesis in Plants. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994Crossref Google Scholar, 2Whitelam G.C. Devlin P.F.

Efforts to identify components involved in phytochrome signal transduction have included genetic screens for signaling defective mutants and screens for phytochrome-interacting factors using the yeast two-hybrid system (3Smith H. Nature. 2000; 407: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 4Deng X.-W. Quail P.H. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 5Neff M.M.

These screens identified two types of signaling proteins, those that appear dedicated to a single phytochrome photoreceptor, phyA or phyB, and those that function in a transduction pathway segment common to several photoreceptors, suggesting that phytochrome signaling involves an interplay of highly selective and less specific partners. A number of signaling components that apparently play a selective role in transducing the phyA-perceived light signal have been identified through genetic screens (EID1, FAR1, FHY1, FHY3, FIN2, FIN219, HFR1 (REP1, RSF1), PAT1, SPA1; Refs. 7Dieterle M.

The SPA1 locus was identified in a screen for extragenic mutations capable of suppressing the phenotype of a weak phyA mutant in a light-dependent fashion. Recessive spa1 mutants are hypersensitive specifically to the phyA-perceived light signal, suggesting that SPA1 functions as a phyA-dependent negative regulator of light signaling activity (17Hoecker U. Xu Y. Quail P.H. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 19-33PubMed Google Scholar). SPA1 encodes a nuclear-localized 114-kDa protein with several features of potential functional importance (16Hoecker U. Tepperman J.M. Quail P.H. Science. 1999; 284: 496-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In the C-terminal portion, it displays four WD-repeats, a structural motif that is common to many eukaryotic proteins with diverse functions and is thought to mediate protein-protein interactions (18Smith T.F. Gaitatzes C. Saxena K. Neer E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 181-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). N-terminal to the WD-repeats, SPA1 contains a putative coiled-coil structure and two likely nuclear localization sequences. The N terminus of SPA1 shares weak sequence homology with Ser/Thr/Tyr protein kinases. A downstream convergence of several photoreceptor-specific branches of the light signaling pathway is supported by the isolation of various constitutively photomorphogenic mutants exhibiting features of light-grown seedlings in complete darkness (4Deng X.-W. Quail P.H. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 19Deng X.-W. Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1998; 51: 93-96PubMed Google Scholar, 20McNellis T.W. Deng X.-W. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1749-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The corresponding loci code for negative regulators of photomorphogenesis that are active in dark-grown Arabidopsis and are thought to be inactivated by light through the functions of several phytochromes and other types of photoreceptors (4Deng X.-W. Quail P.H. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 19Deng X.-W. Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1998; 51: 93-96PubMed Google Scholar, 20McNellis T.W. Deng X.-W. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1749-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Among these repressors, the RING finger-containing WD-repeat protein COP1 appears to be a key regulatory player that is nuclear-localized in the dark and excluded from the nucleus in the light (21von Arnim A.G. Deng X.-W. Cell. 1994; 79: 1035-1045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Through its WD-repeat domain COP1 physically interacts with HY5, a bZIP-type transcription factor that functions as a positive regulator of photomorphogenesis (22Ang L.H. Chattopadhyay S. Wei N. Oyama T. Okada K. Batschauer A. Deng X.-W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). It is hypothesized that COP1 inactivates HY5 in the dark by targeting it for degradation in the nucleus (23Osterlund M.T. Hardtke C.S. Wei N. Deng X.-W. Nature. 2000; 405: 462-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). While genetic data are consistent with the postulated function of COP1 as a convergence point for upstream photoreceptor-specific signaling pathways, there is thus far no direct molecular evidence supporting this hypothesis. Three principal pieces of evidence suggested to us that SPA1 might be a phyA-specific signaling intermediate acting in concert with the COP1 protein. First, SPA1, like COP1, appears to function in repressing photomorphogenesis, although, in contrast to COP1, it requires light for activity. Second, SPA1 and COP1 are related by sequence in that they contain highly similar WD-repeat domains in their C-terminal regions. We considered this sequence similarity to be particularly significant, because the COP1 WD-repeat domain had been identified as an autonomous repressor module (24Torii K.U. McNellis T.W. Deng X.-W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5577-5587Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Third, both SPA1 and COP1 are nuclear localized in etiolated seedlings. In this study we therefore investigated the possibility that SPA1 and COP1 are physically interacting proteins. For yeast two-hybrid interaction experiments, GAD-SPA1 and GAD-SPA1-NT696 were constructed by PCR-amplifying the full-length SPA1 open reading frame (ORF) or the N-terminal part of SPA1 encoding the first 696 amino acids using primers with restriction sites and ligation of the digested PCR products into the NcoI-XhoI sites of pACT2 (CLONTECH). The full-length COP1 ORF was ligated into the EcoRI site of pGBKT7 (CLONTECH) to produce GBT-COP1. For expression of proteins in vitro, all constructs were made by ligating a PCR-amplified ORF into theNcoI-XhoI sites of the vector pET15b (Novagen). The construct SPA1 expresses the complete ORF of SPA1, SPA1-NT696 the amino acids 1–696, SPA1-NT545 the amino acids 1–545, and SPA1-cc the amino acids 521–696. COP1 expresses the complete ORF of COP1, COP1-Δcc the amino acids 1–119 and 221–675, and COP1-NT268 the amino acids 1–268. GAD-SPA1 and GAD-COP1 were constructed by ligating a PCR-amplified fragment that contains the sequences coding for GAD and the hemagglutinin epitope tag from pACT2 into the NcoI site of the constructs SPA1 and COP1, respectively. The construct GAD was made by PCR-amplifying GAD-hemagglutinin from pACT2 and ligating it into the NcoI-XhoI sites of pET15b. All constructs made using PCR-amplified fragments were sequenced to confirm the accuracy of the sequence. Cultures of the yeast strain SFY526 co-transformed with bait and prey plasmids were grown to an A600 of approximately 0.7. Cells were washed once in Z-buffer (60 mmNa2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, pH 7.0), resuspended in Z-buffer, and frozen in liquid N2. After thawing, β-mercaptoethanol ando-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside were added to final concentrations of 0.19% and 0.64 mg/ml, respectively, and extracts were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by adding Na2CO3 to a final concentration of 0.3 m. Absorbance at 420 nm was determined spectrophotometrically, and β-galactosidase activity was determined in Miller units. All proteins were synthesized in the reticulocyte TnT in vitro transcription/translation system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Prey proteins were produced in the presence of 35S-labeled methionine, while bait proteins were produced in the presence of either unlabeled methionine (domain mapping experiments) or a mixture of35S-labeled and unlabeled methionine. Ten μl each of TnT-produced bait and prey proteins were added to 0.1 ml of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 20) with protease inhibitors (Complete, EDTA-free, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and incubated on a rotating platform at 4 °C for 2–3 h. Following addition of 1 μg of monoclonal antibody against GAD (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) incubation continued for one more hour. Subsequently, 20 μl of protein A-coated magnetic beads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway) was added. After another hour of incubation, beads were washed three times with 1 ml of binding buffer. Pellet and supernatant fractions were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels with 6–15% acrylamide and visualized using a phosphorimager (Fudji). Wild-type and mutant Arabidopsis lines used were described previously (17Hoecker U. Xu Y. Quail P.H. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 19-33PubMed Google Scholar). Seeds were plated on growth medium and induced to germinate as described previously (17Hoecker U. Xu Y. Quail P.H. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 19-33PubMed Google Scholar). Seedlings were grown in the dark for 3 days and subsequently transferred to the following light conditions: 0.01 μmol m−2 s−1 FRc for 0–10 h (PORA transcript analysis), 2.3 μmol m−2 s−1 FRc for 0–28 h (for CHStranscript analysis), and 10 min of 10 μmol m−2s−1 FR followed by transfer to darkness for 0–18 h (forCAB transcript analysis). Tissue was harvested in green safe light, and total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plant Miniprep kit (Qiagen). Five μg of total RNA was separated on a formaldehyde-containing agarose gel and was subsequently transferred to a nylon membrane (Micron Separations). The membrane was hybridized with the following 32P-labeled probes recognizing light-regulated genes: a 170-base pair fragment from the 5′-untranslated region of the Arabidopsis PORA gene (25Armstrong G.A. Runge S. Frick G. Sperling U. Apel K. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 1505-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), a 0.5-kilobase pair BamHI-SacI fragment corresponding to the Arabidopsis CAB3 coding region, and a 0.95-kilobase pair EcoRI cDNA fragment coding for the Arabidopsis CHS gene. To normalize for unequal loading, membranes were subsequently hybridized with a 18 S rRNA probe from pea. Signals were quantified by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) analysis. We employed the yeast two-hybrid system to test the possibility that SPA1 physically interacts with COP1. Fig. 1 shows that COP1 selectively bound full-length SPA1, as well as a truncated form of SPA1 lacking the C-terminal 333 amino acids (SPA1-NT696). These results indicate that SPA1 and COP1 interact in yeast and that the domain responsible for binding of COP1 lies in the N-terminal domain of SPA1. To verify the interaction detected in yeast, we conducted an in vitrobinding assay based on co-immunoprecipitation of COP1 with the GAD-SPA1 fusion protein using antibodies raised against the Gal4 activation domain (GAD) segment of the GAD-SPA1 fusion protein. Prey proteins and GAD-tagged bait proteins were synthesized by coupled in vitro transcription and translation. In these reactions prey proteins were fully radioactively labeled with [35S]methionine, while bait proteins were only partially labeled by the addition of a mixture of unlabeled and35S-labeled methionine to facilitate resolving of the co-immunoprecipitated proteins. COP1 bound strongly to GAD-SPA1, but not to GAD, indicating that COP1 selectively interacted with SPA1 (Fig.2A). We quantitatively determined the proportion of added COP1 that was co-immunoprecipitated with the bait by PhosphorImager analysis and found that GAD-SPA1 bound 18.6% of the added COP1 protein, while GAD bound 0.3% of the added COP1 (Fig. 2B). The molar ratio of bound COP1 to immobilized GAD-SPA1 or GAD was calculated as well (Fig.2C). These data indicate that COP1 bound to GAD-SPA1 with 190-fold higher apparent affinity than to GAD. We also performed the reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiment, using GAD-COP1 as the bait and SPA1 as the prey. As shown in Fig. 2,D–F, SPA1 strongly and selectively bound to COP1 also in this configuration. To define the COP1-interacting region in SPA1, we tested truncated versions of SPA1 for in vitro binding to COP1 (Fig.3, A–C). In these experiments, we used 35S-labeled SPA1 and SPA1 deletion derivatives as prey and GAD-COP1 and GAD as bait. SPA1-NT696 lacking the C-terminal region, including all four WD-repeats, bound to COP1 as efficiently as the full-length SPA1 protein, indicating that the WD-repeat domain of SPA1 is not necessary for the interaction with COP1. These results are consistent with the COP1 binding activity of SPA1-NT696 that we observed in the yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 1). Removal of 151 more amino acids, including the predicted coiled-coil domain of SPA1, (SPA1-NT545), abolished COP1 binding activity. The data suggest that the coiled-coil domain of SPA1 may be the COP1-interacting domain. We therefore tested whether the coiled-coil domain of SPA1 is sufficient for binding of COP1. Indeed, the putative coiled-coil domain of SPA1 alone (SPA1-cc) displayed similar binding activities compared with the full-length SPA1 protein, allowing COP1 to co-immunoprecipitate 25% of the added SPA1-cc protein. None of the SPA1 proteins showed strong interaction with the control bait GAD, indicating that the observed binding activities of SPA1-cc and SPA1-NT696 were specific for COP1. We also conducted the reciprocal experiment using GAD-tagged SPA1 deletion derivatives as bait and 35S-labeled COP1 as prey. GAD-SPA1, GAD-SPA1-NT696, and GAD-SPA1-cc strongly co-immunoprecipitated COP1 (22, 20, and 29% of the added COP1, respectively), while GAD-SPA1-NT 545 and GAD did not show strong interaction with COP1 (binding of 0.6 and 0.5% of the added COP1, respectively) (data not shown). Thus, the data from the reciprocal experiment support the conclusion that the coiled-coil domain of SPA1 is necessary and sufficient for binding of COP1 in vitro. To determine the domain in COP1 necessary for interaction with SPA1, we then employed deletion derivatives of COP1 in the in vitrobinding assay with full-length SPA1 (Fig.4, A–C). Here, we used GAD-SPA1 and GAD as bait and 35S-labeled truncated COP1 proteins as prey. Because the COP1 protein contains a putative coiled-coil domain, we first tested whether this domain is important for binding of SPA1. A deletion derivative of COP1 lacking the coiled-coil domain (COP1-Δcc) did not exhibit any detectable interaction with SPA1, indicating that the coiled-coil domain of COP1 is necessary for the SPA1 binding activity of COP1. We were unable to investigate whether the coiled-coil domain of COP1 is sufficient for interaction with SPA1, because the coiled-coil domain alone could not be expressed in vitro. However, the N-terminal 268 amino acids of COP1 comprising the predicted RING finger and coiled-coil domains (COP1-NT268) displayed strong and selective interaction with SPA1, binding 17% of the added SPA1 protein. These results indicate that the N terminus of COP1 is sufficient for binding to SPA1. Because we previously only described the morphological phenotype of the spa1 mutant, we wished to investigate whether spa1 mutations also affect the expression of known phyA-regulated genes. Moreover, a branching of the phyA signaling pathway was suggested by the isolation of mutants (fhy1, hfr1/rep1) that were altered in the expression of only a subset of genes regulated by light (1 2, 13, 26). We therefore wished to place SPA1 within this branched network of phyA signaling. We compared transcript levels of light-regulated genes in dark-grownspa1 mutant and wild-type seedlings exposed to FR for only several hours. We selected three genes that were shown to be regulated by separate branches of the phyA signaling pathway (13Soh M.-S. Kim Y.-M. Han S.-J. Song P.-S. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 2061-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 26Barnes S.A. Quaggio R.B. Whitelam G.C. Chua N.-H. Plant J. 1996; 10: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar): the light-inducible genes coding for chalcone synthase (CHS), the chlorophyll ab-binding protein (CAB), and the light-repressible gene encoding protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase A (PORA). Fig. 5, Aand B, show that CHS and CAB mRNA abundance was considerably higher in light-exposed spa1mutants than in wild-type. Here a small but reproducible difference between spa1 mutant and wild-type seedlings was also observed in the dark. This effect, however, was fully dependant on phyA, as it was no longer observed in the phyA-deficient spa1–2 phyA-101 double mutant (Fig. 5D), suggesting that germinating Arabidopsis seeds may contain active phyA and/or active SPA1. Thus, CHS and CAB genes appeared hypersensitive to FR in the absence of functional SPA1, and this effect was evident as early as 2 h after the initiation of light treatment. Transcript levels of the light-repressible PORAgene exhibited an enhanced down-regulation by FRc in spa1mutants when compared with wild-type (Fig. 5C). This differential response was detectable after an FRc irradiation of at least 4 h. Changes in the rate of transcript synthesis, however, may have been initiated earlier but not immediately observed due to the time required for the degradation of mRNA produced in the preceding dark treatment. Taken together, these results indicate thatspa1 mutations enhance light responses of all three examined phyA-regulated genes. We therefore conclude that SPA1 is not involved in a known branched part of the phyA signaling pathway. In this study, we have investigated the possibility that the phytochrome signaling factors SPA1 and COP1 are physically interacting proteins. Using two experimental approaches, the yeast two-hybrid system and an in vitro interaction assay, we have provided evidence that SPA1 directly binds to COP1. The observed strength and selectivity of the SPA1-COP1 interaction together with in vivo findings reported here and previously that both proteins act as repressors of light-regulated responses in the plant (17Hoecker U. Xu Y. Quail P.H. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 19-33PubMed Google Scholar, 27Deng X.W. Casper T. Quail P.H. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1172-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 28Deng X.W. Quail P.H. Plant J. 1992; 2: 83-95Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar) suggest that this interaction may be functionally significant to SPA1-mediated phyA signal transduction. The isolation of various types of light signaling mutants has led to the hypothesis that separate photoreceptor-specific segments of the light signaling pathway converge further downstream in a common pathway shared by several photoreceptors (4Deng X.-W. Quail P.H. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 5Neff M.M. Fankhauser C. Chory J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 257-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that COP1 may be a protein where signals from several photoreceptors come together, because COP1 appears to respond to Rc, FRc, and blue light (20McNellis T.W. Deng X.-W. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1749-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). We have now provided the first molecular evidence that COP1 may indeed be such a convergence point by showing that a protein apparently dedicated to signaling from an individual photoreceptor physically interacts with COP1. Hence, our data suggest that SPA1 may be a component responsible for linking a phyA-specific input pathway to COP1 (Fig. 6). Similar convergence points have been identified in proteins PIF3, PKS1, and NDPK2, which bind to both phyA and phyB and appear to represent signaling intermediates shared by phyA and phyB (29Ni M. Tepperman J.M. Quail P.H. Cell. 1998; 95: 657-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 30Ni M. Tepperman J.M. Quail P.H.

Nature. 1999; 401: 610-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Thus, light signal transduction appears to occur through a complex network that involves interactions of photoreceptor-specific components with shared partners at at least two different points in the pathway. While SPA1 and COP1 both function as nuclear repressors of photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis, they appear to be oppositely regulated by light: COP1 activity is high in the dark and reduced by light, while SPA1 function requires light. At least two nonmutually exclusive models may be evoked to reconcile the light regulation of SPA1 and COP1 with the observed physical interaction of the two proteins. First, SPA1, once activated by light in a phyA-dependent fashion, may increase COP1 repressor activity by producing SPA1·COP1-containing protein complexes in the cell that cause stronger repression than COP1 does alone. It has been established that the WD-repeat domain of COP1 functions as an autonomous repressor of photomorphogenesis (24Torii K.U. McNellis T.W. Deng X.-W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5577-5587Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The findings that SPA1 contains a WD-repeat domain that is highly similar in sequence to that of COP1 and, moreover, is essential for SPA1 function in vivo (16Hoecker U. Tepperman J.M. Quail P.H. Science. 1999; 284: 496-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) support the idea that SPA1 and COP1 may act in concert in repressing photomorphogenesis. An alternative possibility for SPA1 function may be that active SPA1, when bound to COP1, may interfere with the light-induced inactivation of COP1, thus prolonging its repressive activity. One mechanism by which light inactivates COP1 is the light-induced depletion of COP1 from the nucleus (21von Arnim A.G. Deng X.-W. Cell. 1994; 79: 1035-1045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). This process requires at least 24 h of light exposure and is considered too slow to account for rapid COP1-mediated changes observed in response to light (34von Arnim A.G. Osterlund M.T. Kwok S.F. Deng X.-W. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Therefore, the existence of an additional, early inactivation mechanism has been proposed. Our findings that spa1 mutations cause early changes in the expression of the light-regulated genes CHS,CAB, and PORA suggest that, in this model, SPA1 more likely modulates an early COP1 inactivation mechanism. Our deletion analyses aimed at defining the domains in SPA1 and COP1 responsible for the interaction of the two proteins indicate that the putative coiled-coil domain of SPA1 most likely binds to the presumed coiled-coil domain of COP1. To investigate whether otherArabidopsis proteins exist with a coiled-coil domain similar to that of SPA1, we searched the Arabidopsis data base containing the complete sequence of the Arabidopsis genome. We detected only two hypothetical proteins with significant sequence similarity (GenBankTM accession numbers T08190 andAAF87859), both exhibiting 32% identity with the amino acid sequence of the SPA1 coiled-coil domain. These hypothetical proteins are indeed predicted to form coiled-coil structures and, moreover, show additional high sequence similarity to the WD-repeat region of SPA1. Hence, if these proteins are indeed synthesized in the cell, they might represent COP1-interacting proteins as well. Interestingly, COP1 function requires its coiled-coil domain for homodimerization, which in turn is necessary for the COP1-HY5 interaction (24Torii K.U. McNellis T.W. Deng X.-W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5577-5587Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus, the coiled-coil domain of COP1 may be a possible site for regulation of COP1 activity by interacting proteins such as SPA1. Several other COP1-interacting proteins have been identified of which three proteins (CIP1, CIP4, CIP7) also appear to bind to the coiled-coil domain of COP1 (35Matsui M. Stoop C.D. von Arnim A.G.

There is evidence that CIP4 and CIP7 may function as positive regulators of light-regulated genes (36Yamamoto Y.Y. Matsui M. Ang L.H. Deng X.-W. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1083-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 37Yamamoto Y.Y. Deng X.-W. Matsui M. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 399-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to investigate the interplay of the various COP1-binding proteins. Taken together, we have provided evidence that SPA1 may physically link an upstream phyA-specific branch of the light signaling pathway to the repressor COP1. A future biochemical analysis of the SPA1·COP1 complex in planta under different light conditions and in photoreceptor-deficient backgrounds will shed new light on the mechanisms involved in phyA signaling that are as yet not understood. We thank N. Wei for the gift ofCHS and CAB probes, G. Armstrong for the gift of the PORA probe, X.-W. Deng for providing us with the COP1 cDNA, and P. Westhoff and members of the laboratory for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2052930354,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), a member of the TNF family, induces apoptosis in many transformed cells. We report TRAIL-induced NF-κB activation, concomitant with production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine Interleukin-8 in the relatively TRAIL-insensitive cell line, HEK293. In contrast, TRAIL-induced NF-κB activation occurred in HeLa cells only upon pretreatment with the caspase inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-(OMe) fluoromethyl ketone (z-VAD.fmk), indicating that this was due to a caspase-sensitive component of TRAIL-induced NF-κB activation. NF-κB activation was mediated by the death receptors, TRAIL-R1 and -R2, but not by TRAIL-R3 or -R4 and was only observed in HeLa cells in the presence of z-VAD.fmk. Receptor-interacting protein, an obligatory component of TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation, was cleaved during TRAIL-induced apoptosis. We show that receptor-interacting protein is recruited to the native TRAIL death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) and that recruitment is enhanced in the presence of z-VAD.fmk, thus providing an explanation for the potentiation of TRAIL-induced NF-κB activation by z-VAD.fmk in TRAIL-sensitive cell lines. Examination of the TRAIL DISC in sensitive and resistant cells suggests that a high ratio of c-FLIP to caspase-8 may partially explain cellular resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis was also modulated by inhibition or activation of NF-κB. Thus, in some contexts, modulation of NF-κB activation possibly at the level of apical caspase activation at the DISC may be a key determinant of sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis."

There are several possibilities (Fig.1). In mammals the conversion of serine to Etn occurs by an indirect, lipid-linked route in which serine is first incorporated into phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) by a base exchange reaction with pre-existing phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn). The PtdSer is then decarboxylated by PtdSer decarboxylase to give PtdEtn, from which Etn can be released by base exchange or hydrolysis (3Voelker D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 4Kent C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 315-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Yeast and bacteria also have PtdSer decarboxylases but form PtdSer by condensing the phosphatidyl moiety of CDP-diacylglycerol with serine in a reaction catalyzed by PtdSer synthase (3Voelker D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 5Cronan Jr., C.E. Rock C.O. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1996: 612-636Google Scholar). PtdSer synthase and serine base exchange have been demonstrated in several plants (6Delhaize E Hebb D.M. Richards K.D. Lin J.M. Ryan P.R.

Biochem. 1974; 52: 469-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 10Marshall M.O. Kates M. FEBS Lett. 1973; 31: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 11Kinney A.J. Moore Jr., T.S. Plant Physiol. 1987; 84: 78-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, none of these data establish that the reaction sequence serine → PtdSer → PtdEtn → Etn is a major one in vivo. Another potential mechanism for Etn synthesis is direct decarboxylation of free serine, and the pattern of radiolabeled serine metabolism in the aquatic plant Lemna is most readily reconciled with this possibility (1Mudd S.H. Datko A.H. Plant Physiol. 1989; 91: 587-597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also apparently supporting direct decarboxylation are reports that extracts of Lemna fronds (1Mudd S.H. Datko A.H. Plant Physiol. 1989; 91: 587-597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cucurbit seedlings (12Crocomo O.J. Fowden L. Phytochemistry. 1970; 9: 537-540Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar) contain serine decarboxylase (SDC) activity. However, in both cases SDC was assayed by release of 14CO2from [1-14C]serine, and this type of assay is subject to serious artifacts if used with crude plant extracts (13Birecka H. Bitonti A.J. McCann P.P. Plant Physiol. 1985; 79: 509-514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Mazelis M. Ingraham L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 109-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, oxidases can convert amino acids to 2-oxo acids that are then chemically decarboxylated by the H2O2 that the oxidases generate (13Birecka H. Bitonti A.J. McCann P.P. Plant Physiol. 1985; 79: 509-514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, there is no unequivocal evidence for SDC in plants. SDC has not been definitively demonstrated in any organism, although there is circumstantial evidence for its presence in malarial parasites, Plasmodium spp. (15Elabbadi N. Ancelin M.L. Vial H.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We therefore set out (a) to find whether plants have SDC by using an unambiguous assay based on measuring the Etn product, (b) to identify candidate SDCs by genomic analysis and by complementation of yeast psd1 psd2 and cho1mutants that are Etn auxotrophs, and (c) to verify the activity of the SDCs using heterologous expression in bacteria and partial purification of the recombinant enzyme. These studies clearly identify a soluble SDC in plants. l-[U-14C]Serine (160 or 165 μCi/μmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. l- andd-[1-14C]Serine (55 μCi/μmol),l-[U-14C]histidine (331 μCi/μmol),l-[U-14C]tyrosine (450 μCi/μmol),l-[U-14C]glutamate (200 μCi/μmol), andl-[3-14C]tryptophan (55 μCi/μmol) were from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). l-[U-14C]Serine was freed of basic impurities before use by shaking with 0.05 volume of AG-50 (NH4+) resin for 1 min.l-[U-14C]Phosphoserine (160 μCi/μmol) was synthesized from l-[U-14C]serine and isolated by chromatography on a 3-ml column of AG-1 (formate) (1Mudd S.H.

Fatty acid methyl esters were prepared from each lipid class by methanolysis at 80 °C for 3 h in 5% (w/v) HCl in methanol, with an additional 47.8 nmol of pentadecanoic acid as an internal standard and 50 nmol of 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-methylphenol as an antioxidant. The resultant methyl esters were extracted with hexane and quantified with a gas-liquid chromatograph (GC-18A, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a fused silica capillary column (0.25 mm × 50 cm, HR-SS-10, Shinwa Chemical Industries, Kyoto, Japan) and a data processor (C-R6A, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). E. coli cultures (50 ml) were routinely grown at 37 °C to an A 600 of 0.6–1.0 in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, at which point isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added (final concentration, 1 mm), and incubation was continued at 37 °C for a further 2–3 h or at 25 °C for 1 h in the case of histidine-tagged protein destined for purification. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed in buffer A (100 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 1 mm K2EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm PLP, 10% glycerol), and recentrifuged. Subsequent operations were at 0–4 °C. The cells were resuspended in buffer A (0.5 ml/50-ml culture) and broken with a Mini-BeadBeater (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK) using 0.1-mm zirconia/silica beads. The beads were then washed with 1 ml of buffer A, and the pooled extract plus wash was cleared by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 5 min) and desalted on PD-10 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in buffer A. Dithiothreitol was omitted from buffer A and other buffers used during isolation of histidine-tagged protein. Leaf tissue (fresh weight, 2 g) was frozen in liquid N2, ground in a mortar to a fine powder, and thawed in 3 ml of buffer B (200 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 1 mm K2EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm PLP, 10% glycerol, Na2ascorbate 5 mg/ml). Leaf extracts were then centrifuged and desalted as above except that in some cases the potassium phosphate concentration was reduced to 50 mm. E. coli and leaf extracts were routinely stored at −80 °C after freezing in liquid N2; this was shown to preserve SDC activity. The protein was estimated by Bradford's method (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (218585) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. SDC activity was routinely assayed in buffer A in 10- or 30-μl reaction mixtures containing 45–65 μml-[U-14C]serine (160 or 165 μCi/μmol). After incubation for 1 h at 25 °C, the reaction was stopped with 0.1 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid containing 0.2–1 μmol of carrier Etn, mixed with 1 ml of water and applied to a 1-ml column of AG-1 (OH−) in series with a 1-ml column of BioRex-70 (H+). After washing the column series with 5 ml of water and the BioRex-70 column with a further 10 ml, [14C]Etn was eluted from the BioRex-70 column with 5 ml of 1 n HCl, and an aliquot of the eluate was taken for scintillation counting. The recovery of authentic [14C]Etn from this procedure was 81%; all data were corrected accordingly. In some cases, a portion of the eluate was freeze-dried, redissolved, and analyzed by TLC on silica gel G plates developed with methanol:acetone:concentrated HCl (90:10:4 v/v/v); radioactive zones were detected by autoradiography. To determine the stoichiometry of the reaction and when using l- ord-[1-14C]serine as substrate, the assays were run at 21–22 °C and 14CO2 was trapped as described (32Kocsis M.G. Hanson A.D. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 1153-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Other l-amino acid decarboxylase activities were assayed by using U-14C- or 3-14C-labeled substrates and measuring [14C]amine formation. The conditions were as for SDC assays except that reactions were stopped with 1 ml of ice-cold water, appropriate amines replaced Etn as carrier, and amine products other than histamine were isolated using different ion exchange columns (1 ml). For tyrosine or tryptophan decarboxylase, a BioRex-70 (H+) column was used and washed with 50 ml of water before eluting tyramine or tryptamine with 5 ml of 1 n HCl. For glutamate decarboxylase, a column series of AG-1 (acetate) followed by AG-1 (OH−) was used, and γ-aminobutyrate was eluted from the AG-1 (OH−) column with 5 ml of 2.5 n HCl. For phosphoserine decarboxylase, a column series of AG-1 (formate) followed by AG-4 (OH−) was used, and phosphoethanolamine was eluted from the AG-4 column with 5 ml of 6 n NH4OH. TLC analyses confirmed that carrier amines were recovered in the amine fractions. Blanks with no enzyme (for leaf extracts) or containing extracts of E. colicells harboring empty vector were included for all assays and used to correct the results. These corrections were always small. PtdSer decarboxylase activity was assayed as described for the yeast mitochondrial enzyme (28Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21416-21424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Histidine-tagged AtSDC was purified by affinity chromatography on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid superflow resin (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, except that 1 mm PLP was added to the elution buffer. The eluate fraction with the highest SDC activity was desalted on a PD-10 column equilibrated with 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, and concentrated using a Centricon-30 unit (Millipore) before spectral analysis. Native molecular mass was estimated using a Waters 626 high performance liquid chromatography system equipped with a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the reference proteins cytochrome c, carbonic anhydrase, bovine serum albumin, and β-amylase. By measuring [14C]Etn formation froml-[U-14C]serine, SDC activity was readily detected in soluble extracts of leaves from taxonomically diverse plants, including Arabidopsis, rapeseed, and spinach (Fig.2 A). Activity was highest in spinach and was further increased by salinization, as reported for other enzymes involved in choline synthesis (24Nuccio M.L. Ziemak M.J. Henry S.A. Weretilnyk E.A. Hanson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14095-14101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 33Summers P.S. Weretilnyk E.A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 1269-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Extracts of salinized spinach leaves were therefore used to further characterize the activity. Formation of [14C]Etn proceeded linearly for at least 2 h (Fig. 2 B) and was dependent on the presence of PLP. When PLP was omitted from extraction and assay buffers the activity was <3% of that when it was included (Fig.2 C); the removal of PLP from the enzyme was presumably facilitated by adduct formation with the dithiothreitol present in the extraction buffer (34Tanase S. Guirard B.M. Snell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6738-6746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of chemical decarboxylation ofl-[U-14C]serine in the PLP-containing assay buffer was negligible. The K m value for l-serine was 10 mm, and the activity in crude extracts at saturating serine concentration was 6 nmol h−1 mg−1 protein, which is sufficient to account for the estimated in vivorate of Etn synthesis in salinized spinach (33Summers P.S. Weretilnyk E.A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 1269-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The activity was maximal around pH 8 and was almost unaffected (≤20% inhibition) by a 200-fold molar excess of Etn, choline, or their phosphoesters (not shown). When 14CO2 evolution was measured it was found that 4.9 mol of 14CO2 were released per mol of [14C]Etn. This large excess of14CO2 fits with the massive artifactual decarboxylation observed for other amino acids in crude plant extracts (13Birecka H. Bitonti A.J. McCann P.P. Plant Physiol. 1985; 79: 509-514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It also suggests that the SDC activities previously reported for plants (1Mudd S.H. Datko A.H. Plant Physiol. 1989; 91: 587-597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Crocomo O.J. Fowden L. Phytochemistry. 1970; 9: 537-540Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar) may be major overestimates because they were based on14CO2 release assays. Having shown that Arabidopsis has SDC activity and that SDC is PLPdependent, we searched the Arabidopsisgenome for genes encoding unidentified homologs of PLP-dependent amino acid decarboxylases. Several enzymes from each of the four decarboxylase groups (I–IV) (35Sandmeier E. Hale T.I. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 997-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) were used as the query sequences for BLASTp and tBLASTn algorithms (27Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60532) Google Scholar). These searches identified a single candidate gene (F2J6.7), specifying hypothetical protein AAF63121 (annotated as “putative histidine decarboxylase”). A BLASTn search of the GenBankTM EST data base using the deduced AAF63121 cDNA as query sequence revealed nine cognate Arabidopsis ESTs. The longest of these (W43626) was sequenced and shown to encode a protein identical to the predicted protein AAF63121. To find whether this protein has SDC activity, it was expressed inE. coli without or with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag. Extracts of cells harboring these constructs had high SDC activities (104-fold greater than those in Arabidopsisleaves), whereas there was no activity in extracts of cells harboring the empty vector (Fig. 3 A). The Arabidopsis protein was accordingly designated AtSDC. To show that AtSDC functions as an SDC in vivo, the open reading frame was subcloned into a yeast expression vector and introduced into the yeast strain RYY51, a psd1 psd2 double disruptant that lacks PtdSer decarboxylase activity and is consequently an Etn auxotroph (17Trotter P. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6062-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The AtSDC construct yielded a high frequency of Etn-independent transformants whose growth on plates was comparable with that of the wild type (Fig. 3 B). No complementation was seen with vector alone (Fig. 3 B). Retransformation of RYY51 with AtSDC plasmid rescued from complemented cells restored Etn prototrophy, establishing that complementation was due to the encoded plant protein. Phospholipid analysis confirmed that expression of AtSDC restored the ability of RYY51 cells to produce normal amounts of PtdEtn and also significantly increased the PtdEtn content of wild type SEY6210 cells (Fig. 4). AtSDC is able to complement the psd1 psd2 mutant because the Etn produced from free serine can re-enter phospholipids via the Kennedy pathway (4Kent C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 315-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), i.e. AtSDC installs a bypass around the blocked PtdSer decarboxylation.Figure 4Arabidopsis SDC restores phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis to a yeast psd1 psd2mutant. Cells of psd1 psd2 mutant strain RYY51 harboring the pVT103-U plasmid alone (psd null) or containing AtSDC (psd null + SDC) were grown in synthetic minimal medium minus or plus 5 mm Etn (+ Etn). For the psd null minus Etn treatment, cells from a logarithmically growing plus Etn culture were transferred to medium without Etn and incubated for three normal doubling times. During this period, the cells underwent approximately one doubling and then ceased growth. The results for wild type strain SEY6210 (WT) and this strain harboring the AtSDC plasmid (WT + SDC) are included for comparison. The data are the means of three replicates and S.E. PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In a different approach to cloning SDC, we transformed a yeastcho1 mutant with a rapeseed cDNA expression library. Thecho1 mutant lacks PtdSer synthase activity and therefore cannot produce PtdSer or its decarboxylation product PtdEtn; growth of the mutant can be supported by Etn in the medium (16Hikiji T. Miura K. Kiyono K. Shibuya I. Ohta A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 104: 894-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 20Nishida I. Swinhoe R. Slabas A.R. Murata N. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) (Fig.5). Twenty Etn-independent clones (Fig.5) were isolated, of which five harbored the same sequence. One representative clone was used for further studies. Phospholipid analysis confirmed that expression of this cDNA in thecho1 mutant enhanced synthesis of PtdEtn and of its metabolite phosphatidylcholine (Table I). Expression of the cDNA in E. coli confirmed that it specified a protein with high SDC activity (Fig. 3 A). The protein was accordingly designated BnSDC. Of the other 14 clones that were Etn prototrophs, seven represented a sequence very similar to BnSDC (to be reported elsewhere), and the rest were not effective in plasmid rescue experiments; no PtdSer synthase clones were found.Table IRapeseed SDC restores phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis in a yeast cho1 mutantPlasmidMediumPhospholipid contentPtdEtnPtdChoPtdInsPtdOHmol %Vector+Etn8.6 ± 1.339.0 ± 1.350.9 ± 2.21.5 ± 1.3BnSDC+Etn14.2 ± 2.638.6 ± 3.745.6 ± 3.61.6 ± 0.2Vector−Etn3.5 ± 1.526.2 ± 1.068.0 ± 5.02.4 ± 4.1BnSDC−Etn17.5 ± 9.347.7 ± 7.430.6 ± 12.64.0 ± 2.0Cells of the cho1 mutant strain INY102B/YCpGPSS harboring plasmid pFL61 alone (vector) or containing BnSDC (BnSDC) were grown in synthetic minimal medium containing 2% glucose, plus or minus 1 mm Etn.

We also investigated one mechanism for regulating this phosphatase. Myosin phosphatase activity, myosin light chain phosphorylation, guanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) concentration, and phosphorylation of the inhibitory protein CPI-17 were all assayed in homogenates of one carotid media ring at each time point during nitric oxide-induced relaxation. The application of sodium nitroprusside to histamine-contracted media caused rapid declines in light chain phosphorylation and force. These were temporally correlated with a rapid elevation of cGMP and a large transient increase in myosin phosphatase activity. During the early response to nitroprusside, when force declined, increases in myosin phosphatase activity, concurrent with cGMP-mediated decreases in calcium and myosin light chain kinase activity, could accelerate light chain dephosphorylation. CPI-17 was dephosphorylated upon application of nitroprusside at the same time that myosin phosphatase activity increased, suggesting that the removal of inhibition by phospho-CPI-17 contributed to the increase in myosin phosphatase activity. After 20 min of nitroprusside, myosin phosphatase activity had declined to basal levels, however low force was sustained. Additional light chain phosphorylation-independent mechanisms may be involved in sustaining the relaxation.

Stull J.T. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1985; 25: 593-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hartshorne D.J. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1987: 423-482Google Scholar). The extent of phosphorylation is determined by the balance of the activities of the Ca2+-calmodulin-activated myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and the myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) (3Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Nature. 1994; 372: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). Initially MLCP was presumed to be constitutively active, and MRLC phosphorylation and steady-state force were reported to be proportional to myoplasmic [Ca2+] (4Rembold C.M. Murphy R.A. Circ. Res. 1986; 58: 803-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Relaxation occurred when a stimulus was removed, the myoplasmic [Ca2+] and MLCK activity were reduced, and MRLC phosphorylation declined. However, relaxation can be induced in the presence of excitatory stimuli without proportional decreases in steady-state MRLC phosphorylation by various treatments (5Tansey M.G. Hori M. Karaki H. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. FEBS Lett. 1990; 270: 219-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 6McDaniel N.L. Chen X.-L. Singer H.A. Murphy R.A. Rembold C.M. Am. J.

Life Sci. 1998; 63: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) including nitrovasodilators. These relaxations could involve a change in MLCP activity. Nitric oxide released from endothelial cells, nonadrenergic noncholinergic inhibitory innervation, or exogenous nitrovasodilators is an important inhibitory agent in smooth muscle. Nitric oxide activates soluble guanylyl cyclase to generate cGMP (10McDonald L.J. Murad F. Ignarro L. Murad F. Nitric Oxide: Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Therapeutic Implications. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1995: 263-275Google Scholar). Elevated [cGMP] presumably activates cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). The phosphorylation of several intracellular mechanisms by PKG results in a reduction in myoplasmic [Ca2+] (11Lincoln T.M. Komalavilas P. Cornwell T.L. Hypertension. 1994; 23: 1141-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Nitrovasodilators such as sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and nitroglycerin cause a rapid relaxation of activated swine carotid media that is associated with an increase in [cGMP] and decreases in [Ca2+]i and MRLC phosphorylation (6McDaniel N.L. Chen X.-L. Singer H.A. Murphy R.A. Rembold C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C461-C467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In carotid media submaximally contracted by 3 μm histamine, relaxation was attributed to nitrovasodilator-induced decreases in [Ca2+]i with proportional decreases in MRLC phosphorylation (6McDaniel N.L. Chen X.-L. Singer H.A. Murphy R.A. Rembold C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C461-C467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In media maximally contracted by 10 μm histamine, there was a decrease in the Ca2+ sensitivity of MRLC phosphorylation (phosphorylation was disproportionately low for the measured [Ca2+]i) (6McDaniel N.L. Chen X.-L. Singer H.A. Murphy R.A. Rembold C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C461-C467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Van Riper D.A. McDaniel N.L. Rembold C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1355: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) early during the NO-induced relaxation. This decrease was not caused by the phosphorylation of site A on MLCK or a change in MLCK activity (12Van Riper D.A. McDaniel N.L. Rembold C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1355: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and therefore could reflect an increase in MLCP activity. The steady-state force measured later during NO-induced relaxation was much lower than would be predicted by the measured MRLC phosphorylation (6McDaniel N.L. Chen X.-L. Singer H.A. Murphy R.A. Rembold C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C461-C467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Changing the dependence of force on MRLC phosphorylation could be the result of changes in MLCP activity or caused by some MRLC phosphorylation-independent regulatory mechanism (thin filament-associated) that supersedes regulation by phosphorylation (13Murphy R.A. Walker J.S. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1998; 164: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). cGMP and cGMP-activated PKG decrease the Ca2+ sensitivity of contraction in permeabilized smooth muscle at constant [Ca2+]i (14Nishimura J. van Breeman C.

Nonhydrolyzable analogs of cGMP accelerate MRLC dephosphorylation in the absence of MLCK activity in permeabilized tissues, implying that cGMP mediates an increase in MLCP activity (16Lee M.R. Li L.

In intact femoral artery, Thr-38 of CPI-17 was phosphorylated in response to vasoconstrictors including histamine (38Kitazawa T. Eto M. Woodsome T.P. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9897-9900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), suggesting that CPI-17 mediates agonist-induced inhibition of MLCP. There is evidence that PKG activates MLCP (and other phosphatases (39Zhou X.-B. Ruth P. Schlossmann J. Hofmann F. Korth M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19760-19767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar)). PKG was shown to bind directly to MYPT1 and to phosphorylate itin vitro (40Surks H.K. Mochizuki N.

Cell Signal. 1999; 11: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) reported that the in vitro phosphorylation of MYPT1 had no effect on MLCP activity to isolated myosin light chains and suggested a more indirect mechanism for MLCP activation in vivo. Sauzeau et al. (42Sauzeau V. Le Jeune H. Cario-Toumaniantz C. Smolenski A. Lohmann S.M. Bertoglio J. Chardin P. Pacaud P. J. Biol.

Our objectives in this study were to determine whether MLCP activity changes during the SNP-induced relaxation of maximally contracted intact carotid media and to investigate how the changes in MLCP activity are involved in regulating this relaxation. Adjacent rings from a single artery were frozen at various times during relaxation and multiple assays were performed in each arterial ring to obtain a time course of simultaneous changes in [cGMP], MLCP activity, MRLC phosphorylation, and force. We also compared changes in [Thr-38]CPI-17 phosphorylation and MLCP activity to investigate whether CPI-17 phosphorylation regulates MLCP activity in intact carotid media. Swine common carotid arteries were obtained from a slaughterhouse and transported at 4 °C in physiological salt solution, and experiments were performed within 2 days. Media tubes were dissected from intact arteries by peeling connective tissue and adventitia away from the media (43Wingard C.J. Browne A.K. Murphy R.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 488: 729-739Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A series of 8 or 16 adjacent rings (3-mm wide) cut from one media tube and de-endothelialized were mounted on Grass (Quincy, MA) FT.03 force transducers and maintained at 37 °C in physiological saline solution containing: 140 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mmNa2HPO4, 1.6 mm CaCl2, 5.6 mmd-glucose, 1.2 mmMgCl2, 2.0 mm MOPS buffer (pH 7.4 at 37 °C), and 0.02 EDTA. Isometric force was recorded continuously. Each ring was stretched to its optimum length for force development and then maximally contracted for 10 min with 109 mmK+ physiological saline solution to assess viability (43Wingard C.J. Browne A.K. Murphy R.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 488: 729-739Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Tissues that did not produce a stress greater than 1.0 × 105n/m2 during maximal contraction were discarded. Carotid media rings were stimulated to contract by 10 μm histamine. When steady-state contraction was achieved after 10 min, 30 μm SNP was applied in the continued presence of histamine. Each point in the time course of MLCP activity or MRLC phosphorylation was measured in a different ring from the same artery. Individual rings were quick-frozen at the appropriate time during contraction or relaxation by rapid submersion in liquid nitrogen or an acetone/dry ice slurry. One half of each frozen ring was used to assay MLCP activity. The remaining half was homogenized to measure MRLC phosphorylation and CPI-17 phosphorylation or alternatively homogenized to assay [cGMP]. In some experiments two rings were frozen at each time point so that all four assays could be performed in the same artery. Native smooth muscle myosin was isolated from frozen turkey gizzard (PelFreez) using the method of Sellers et al. (44Sellers J.R. Pato M.D. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 13137-13142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The ionic strength of the actomyosin extract of washed turkey gizzard myofibrils was elevated slowly by adding 0.6 m KCl, 20 mm MgSO4, and 5 mm ATP (pH 7.0). After the two precipitations with (NH4)2SO4, the pellet was dissolved in and then dialyzed overnight against 5 mmKH2PO4, 0.6 m KCl, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm NaN3, and 0.5 mm DTT at pH 7.0. The dialysate was centrifuged at 27,000 × gfor 45 min. The solubilized myosin was dialyzed two times for 3 h in 5 mm KH2PO4, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmNaN3, and 0.5 mm DTT (pH 6.5) and then dialyzed overnight in the same solution with 20 mmMgCl2 at pH 6.5. The precipitated myosin was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was reconstituted in and then dialyzed twice against 20 mmKH2PO4, 0.6 m KCl, 2 mmEGTA, 2 mm NaN3, and 0.5 mm DTT (pH 7.5). Glycerol (50%) was added, and the aliquots were stored at −20 °C. Native myosin was phosphorylated (45Walsh M.P. Hinkins S. Dabrowska R. Hartshorne D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 279-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) in 0.8-ml aliquots containing 100 mmNaH2PO4 (pH 7.0), 25 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm DTT, 5 μm calmodulin, 2 mg/ml myosin, 10 μg/ml MLCK, 1 mm ATP, 0.5 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 1 μmmicrocystin-LR for 1.5 h at 25 °C. The reactants were dialyzed eight times for 12 h against 100 mmNaH2PO4, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA to remove ATP and microcystin. The stoichiometry of32P phosphorylation of the myosin substrate (moles of phosphate/moles of myosin) ranged from 0.8 to 1.0. MLCP activity in intact smooth muscle was assayed using the method of Gong et al. (19Gong M.C. Cohen P. Kitazawa T. Ikebe M. Masuo M. Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14662-14668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. Liquid nitrogen-frozen carotid media rings were weighed, pulverized at −60 °C, and homogenized in a glass homogenizer on ice in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mmbenzamidine, and 25 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin in the proportion of 1 mg of tissue (wet weight)/10 μl of buffer. This slurry was further homogenized with a Teflon pestle in an Eppendorf tube on ice. Homogenates were diluted 25-fold in ice-cold 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol. After 3 min of warming to 25 °C in the water bath, reactions were initiated by adding 10 μl of 32P-labeled myosin substrate per 40 μl of diluted homogenate. The reaction was stopped at 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 min after the addition of substrate by pipetting a 50-μl aliquot of reactants into 100 μl of cold 25% trichloroacetic acid and 25 μl of 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The stopped reactions were incubated 10 min on ice and then centrifuged for 3 min at 13,000 × g. One hundred microliters of the supernatant were counted by the Cerenkov method. The32Pi released due to phosphatase activity was expressed as a percentage of the 32P-labeled myosin present to correct for the possibility that different amounts of somewhat insoluble myosin substrate were pipetted into each reaction tube; the cpm for each sample was divided by the cpm for the total myosin present in 50 μl of reactants. Series of measurements at different times were fitted with rising single exponentials (which often collapsed to straight lines) to determine the initial reaction rate (Fig. 1). The rates were normalized by the protein concentration (measured by the Bradford method (46Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 72: 248-254Crossref Scopus (214455) Google Scholar)) of the homogenate. We expressed MLCP activity as the percentage of Pi released/(min·μg homogenate protein). The activity for each artery was normalized by the stoichiometry of the substrate to enable comparison between arteries. This method was validated by results showing that incremented additions of unphosphorylated myosin to reactions caused classic competitive inhibition of MLCP activity. Daily assays of “blank” reactions of32P-labeled myosin substrate without homogenate exhibited undetectable phosphatase activity. Frozen pieces of media rings were slowly thawed in acetone over a 2.5-h period, air-dried, weighed, and homogenized in 1% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 20 mm DTT on ice. The phospho and dephospho forms of MRLC were separated by isoelectric focusing in glycerol urea gels with a pI ampholyte range of 4.0–6.5. To provide an internal calibration that covers the potential range of variations in the amounts of the two MRLC species, a series of homogenate dilutions (1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, and 1/32) of each homogenate was loaded onto each gel (47Walker J.S. Walker L.A. Etter E.F. Murphy R.A. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 284: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The protein was transferred to nitrocellulose and immunodetected using a polyclonal smooth muscle light chain-specific primary antibody (Dr. James Stull), a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Bio-Rad), and a chemiluminescent substrate (ECL RPN 22109). X-ray film (Kodak Bio- Max) was exposed by the luminescent signal for several different durations (30, 60, and 180 s) to record the signals from all the dilutions. The film was scanned to produce digital images using a Molecular Dynamics laser densitometer. Image analysis software (NIH Image) was used to measure the integrated intensity of the bands in digital images. A few immunoblots were visualized using the colorimetric Amplified Opti-4CN substrate (Bio-Rad) and scanned on a Hewlett Packard ScanJet IIc scanner, and the images were analyzed using UN_SCAN_IT software. Previous comparisons indicated that values for MRLC phosphorylation obtained by the two methods were similar. The integrated intensity of the dephosphorylated band was plotted against the log of the dilution (a measure of the relative amount of protein) for each exposure. Using the linear portion of the resulting curve and the measured intensities of the phosphorylated bands, values for dilution (or relative amount of protein) of the phosphorylated MRLC were obtained by interpolation. The ratio, p/(d +p), where d and p are the dilutions of the dephosphorylated and phosphorylated MRLC, respectively, was used to calculate the percentage phosphorylated for a given sample. Several measurements (from the different film exposures) were obtained for each sample that varied by < 5%. Pieces of frozen rings were thawed in acetone, air-dried, weighed, and homogenized in 0.1 nHCl at 0 °C. The homogenates were centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant was subjected to radioimmunoassay for cGMP content (48Harper J.F. Brooker G. J. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1975; 1: 207-218PubMed Google Scholar) by the Diabetes Core Lab at the University of Virginia School of Medicine. The data were expressed as picomol of cGMP/mg of tissue dry weight. Phosphorylation of [Thr-38]CPI-17 was measured as described by Kitazawa et al. (38Kitazawa T. Eto M. Woodsome T.P. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9897-9900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Aliquots of homogenates used to measure MRLC phosphorylation that contained 400 μm PEFABLOC (protease inhibitors) and 1 μm microcystin-LR were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (49Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose. Phospho-[Thr-38]CPI-17 was immunolabeled using an anti-phospho-[Thr-38]CPI-17 antibody. Then the blot was stripped for 30 min with 50 mm imidazole-HCl containing 1% SDS and 1% β-mercaptoethanol at 55 °C and was reprobed with an anti-CPI-17 antibody to determine the total amount of CPI-17 present. The relative phosphorylation of [Thr-38]CPI-17 was obtained from the ratio of the intensities of phospho and total CPI-17 labeling on the blots. The data are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by Student's ttest. The number of measurements is given by n. Ap value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Native whole myosin phosphorylated by MLCK was used as substrate to selectively measure myosin light chain phosphatase activity. Although several types of phosphatase can dephosphorylate isolated 20-kDa myosin light chains, only MLCP dephosphorylates intact myosin at appreciable rates (50Erdodi F. Ito M. Hartshorne D. Bárány M. Biochemistry of Smooth Muscle Contraction. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996: 131-142Crossref Google Scholar, 51Alessi D. Macdougall L.K. Sola M.M. Ikebe M. Cohen P. Eur. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 31598-31606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The homogenates assayed in this study were diluted 25-fold during the assay reaction. This was determined by comparing the time course of dephosphorylation of 32P-labeled myosin by four different dilutions of one homogenate (Fig.1 A). The 25-fold dilution of this homogenate is shown by filled circles (2 μl/50 μl). The plot of the initial rate versus homogenate concentration (Fig.1 B) shows that at this dilution phosphatase activity was linearly proportional to the amount of homogenate (phosphatase) present. The reaction was not substrate limited at the phosphatase activities measured in this study. The measurement of phosphatase activity in a given homogenate was reproducible; on average, the difference between duplicate measurements of a given homogenate was 15% of the measurement (n = 10). The phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid has been used to distinguish the activities of different phosphatases. Concentrations near 1 nm completely inhibit protein phosphatase type 2A, whereas concentrations near 1 μm are required to inhibit PP1 (53Cohen P. Klumpp S. Schelling D.L. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 596-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). MLCP is considered to be a PP1 phosphatase (50Erdodi F. Ito M. Hartshorne D. Bárány M. Biochemistry of Smooth Muscle Contraction. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996: 131-142Crossref Google Scholar). Myosin phosphatase activity measured in carotid artery homogenates was unaffected by concentrations of okadaic acid up to 1 nm, indicating that protein phosphatase type 2A contributed little to the MLCP activity. For comparison, the phosphorylase phosphatase activity of carotid homogenates, which would include both PP1 and protein phosphatase type 2A, was inhibited 22–40% by 1 nm okadaic acid. Okadaic acid at 1 μm inhibited 88% of myosin phosphatase activity, which is consistent with a predominantly PP1-type activity. Measurements of MLCP activity might be underestimated if MLCK in the homogenate or substrate rephosphorylated the substrate. The addition of 30 μm1-(5-chloronaphthalene-1-sulfonyl)-1H-hexahydro-1,4-diazepine, a kinase inhibitor most specific to MLCK, reduced MLCP activity 12% (n = 4), suggesting there was no significant myosin rephosphorylation. The application of 30 μm SNP to histamine-activated media rings caused a 66 ± 5.8% (n = 10) reduction in force. The force declined rapidly and reached the lowest level at about 4 min (Fig. 2 A). Over the next 10 min a slight rebound was seen in the force traces for individual arteries before the force leveled off at a low final steady state. MRLC phosphorylation decreased rapidly during the first 2 min of SNP treatment (Fig. 2 B). The average decrease was 10.2 ± 1.8% MRLC phosphorylation (n = 9) or 50% of suprabasal phosphorylation. In some individual arteries, MRLC phosphorylation increased after 5 min in the continued presence of SNP. MLCP activity increased 3–4-fold during the SNP-induced relaxation (Fig. 2 C). MLCP activity rose within 1 or 2 min, reached a peak value by 5 min, and then declined over the next 10–15 min to the level measured in the presence of histamine alone. Variations in the early time course and in the time to peak among different arteries underlie the irregular rise to peak in the average activity shown in Fig. 2. MLCP activity measured at 5 min of SNP was significantly different from the activity measured after 10 min of histamine alone (p = 0.001, n = 10). The concentration of cGMP was low and did not change during 40 min of 10 μm histamine alone (data not shown). As expected, SNP caused a rapid increase in [cGMP] within 2 min (Fig. 2 D). The [cGMP] level remained elevated 2–4-fold for at least 30 min. [Thr-38]CPI-17 phosphorylation (Fig. 3) was measured as well as MLCP activity, [cGMP], and MRLC phosphorylation in five arteries. When SNP was applied in the presence of histamine, CPI-17 phosphorylation rapidly declined during the first 5 min. The decrease in CPI-17 phosphorylation coincided in time with the rise in [cGMP] in response to SNP (Fig. 2 D) and the rise in MLCP activity. At later times, although [cGMP] remained significantly elevated, CPI-17 phosphorylation rebounded at the same time that MLCP activity declined to basal levels. There was a close temporal correlation between the reciprocal changes in CPI-17 phosphorylation and MLCP activity, particularly during the early response to SNP in the presence of histamine. The NO-induced relaxation in the presence of excitatory stimuli has been attributed to cGMP-mediated decreases in [Ca2+]i and MLCK activity (11Lincoln T.M. Komalavilas P. Cornwell T.L. Hypertension. 1994; 23: 1141-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). There is also a decrease in the Ca2+ sensitivity of MRLC phosphorylation early during the relaxation (12Van Riper D.A. McDaniel N.L. Rembold C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1355: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that the SNP-induced relaxation involves a large transient increase in MLCP activity. During the initial response to SNP, the large increase in MLCP activity at the same time as a decrease in Ca2+-dependent MLCK activity (resulting in a decrease in the Ca2+ sensitivity of MRLC phosphorylation) could accelerate MRLC dephosphorylation and the decline in force. Decreases in MRLC phosphorylation resulting from changes in both MLCK and MLCP activity determine the decline in force during this early period of relaxation. At later times during the NO-induced relaxation, maintenance of the low force may involve additional MRLC phosphorylation-independent mechanisms. In the continued presence of SNP and elevated [cGMP], MLCP activity declined to levels measured before SNP was applied. Other studies (6McDaniel N.L. Chen X.-L. Singer H.A. Murphy R.A. Rembold C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C461-C467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Chuang A.T. Strauss J.D. Steers J.D. Murphy R.A. Life Sci. 1998; 63: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) have shown that the dependence of force on MRLC phosphorylation is altered or uncoupled during sustained relaxation in response to nitrovasodilators. During the nitroglycerin-induced relaxation of maximally activated carotid media, [Ca2+]i and MRLC phosphorylation rebounded toward levels measured in the absence of the nitrovasodilator, and force remained low (6McDaniel N.L. Chen X.-L. Singer H.A. Murphy R.A. Rembold C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C461-C467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The decline in MLCP activity we report, in conjunction with changes in Ca2+-dependent MLCK activity, could account for an elevated steady-state MRLC phosphorylation. However, the uncoupling of force from phosphorylation suggests that some additional regulatory mechanism is determining the steady-state force. Cyclic GMP-mediated processes such as phosphorylation of telokin (54Wu X. Haystead T.A.J. Nakamoto R.K. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11362-11369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 55Walker L.A. MacDonald J.A. Liu X. Nakamoto R.K. Haystead T.A. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2001; 91: 1460-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) may contribute to an inhibition of cross-bridge interaction with actin thin filaments that results in sustained low force. The rise in MLCP activity and decline in CPI-17 phosphorylation coincided with the rise in [cGMP], suggesting that the initial change in MLCP activity was cGMP-mediated and could involve PKG. After the first 5 min of SNP, [cGMP] remained elevated, however there was a decline in MLCP activity and a rebound in CPI-17 phosphorylation. CPI-17 phosphorylation was highest after 10 min in histamine when MLCP activity was lowest. The time course of dephosphorylation of CPI-17 in response to SNP coincided reciprocally with the rise in MLCP activity, suggesting that dephosphorylation of CPI-17 resulted in disinhibition of MLCP activity. The physiological phosphatase(s) for phospho-CPI-17 is yet to be determined. Kinetic analysis indicated competitive and noncompetitive-mixed inhibition of MLCP activity by phospho-CPI-17 (58Senba S. Eto M. Yazawa M. J. Biochem. 1999; 125: 354-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Therefore it is possible that phospho-CPI-17 bound to the catalytic site of MLCP is quite slowly dephosphorylated by MLCP itselfin situ, and dephospho-CPI-17 dissociates from MLCP. Surkset al. (40Surks H.K. Mochizuki N. Kasai Y. Georgescu S.P. Tang K.M. Ito M. Lincoln T.M. Mendelsohn M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1583-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) reported that PKG directly associates with the MYPT1 subunit of MLCP and suggested that this interaction was necessary for a cGMP-mediated dephosphorylation of MRLC. The direct binding of PKG on MYPT1 might activate MLCP to dephosphorylate phospho-CPI-17. Thus, the cGMP-associated increase in MLCP activity might be caused, in part, by a removal of inhibition by CPI-17. The rebound in CPI-17 phosphorylation and decline in MLCP activity suggest that the disinhibition was overcome in the continuous presence of histamine. We directly measured an increase in MLCP activity in homogenates of intact carotid media. Our results indicate that relaxation induced by a physiologically important pathway mediated by NO and cGMP involves the activation of MLCP activity in intact arterial smooth muscle. The increase in MLCP activity early during the relaxation would accelerate MRLC dephosphorylation attributable to the decline in MLCK activity and enhance the drop in force. The previously described decrease in Ca2+ sensitivity of MRLC phosphorylation is a correlate of the increase in MLCP activity. When MLCP activity returns to basal levels, the sustained low force seems to be determined by other (cGMP-mediated) MRLC phosphorylation-independent mechanisms. We also provide evidence that the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of CPI-17 plays a role in the activation of MLCP activity during cGMP-mediated relaxation. We are grateful to Drs.

For these cysteines, loss of activity correlated with loss of metal binding. molybdopterin high performance liquid chromatography cysteine sulfinate desulfinase ubiquitin-activating enzyme dithiothreitol SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis In Escherichia coli, several loci (moa, mob, mod, moe, and mog) have been implicated in the pleiotrophy of the molybdenum enzymes. With the exception of mod, all of these are involved in the biosynthesis of the molybdenum cofactor (1Rajagopalan K.V. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 674-679Google Scholar). Molybdenum cofactor contains a tricyclic pterin derivative termed molybdopterin (MPT)1 that bears the cis-dithiolene group essential for molybdenum ligation. The dithiolene group is generated by MPT synthase, a heterotetrameric protein consisting of two large MoaE subunits (16.9 kDa) and two small MoaD subunits (8.8 kDa) (2Rudolph M.J. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry has identified a thiocarboxylate in the activated form of MoaD that serves as the sulfur donor for the synthesis of MPT from precursor Z. This reaction can be carried out in vitro with the purified components (3Pitterle D.M. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13506-13509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The high-resolution crystal structure of MPT synthase revealed that the C terminus of each MoaD subunit is inserted into a MoaE subunit to form the active site (2Rudolph M.J. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In addition, the small subunit of MPT synthase shows high structural similarity to the eukaryotic protein ubiquitin (2Rudolph M.J. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The observation that an E. coli moeB mutant accumulates precursor Z indicated the absence of an active form of MPT synthase in the mutant (4Pitterle D.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13499-13505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This led to the conclusion that MoeB is the MPT synthase sulfurase, the protein responsible for regenerating the thiocarboxylate group at the C terminus of MoaD in an ATP-dependent reaction (5Rajagopalan K.V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Significant sequence similarities between MoeB and a number of other proteins have been identified (6Furukawa K. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7462-7465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Particularly noteworthy is the amino acid sequence identity of 23% between MoeB and the eukaryotic ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, encoded by Uba1 (5Rajagopalan K.V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As part of the process for ubiquitin-targeted degradation of proteins, Uba1 was shown to activate ubiquitin in an ATP-dependent reaction with the initial formation of an Uba1-ubiquitin adenylate complex. This reaction is followed by generation of a thioester linkage between the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin and a cysteine residue of Uba1 (7Varshavsky A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin is subsequently transferred to one of the ubiquitin carrier proteins (ubiquitin carrier protein (E2)/ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3)) before its attachment to the target protein by the formation of an isopeptide bond with a lysine residue. The functional similarity of MoeB to Uba1 (5Rajagopalan K.V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 6Furukawa K. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol.

Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) has led to the proposal that the mechanism of activation of MPT synthase by MoeB might resemble the process of ubiquitin activation by Uba1. It has been proposed that the initial formation of a MoaD-adenylate leads to a thioester linkage with MoeB before sulfuration of the C-terminal carboxyl group of MoaD to create the reactive thiocarboxylate (5Rajagopalan K.V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 6Furukawa K. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7462-7465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Significantly, MoeB contains several conserved cysteine residues, one of which has been postulated to be involved in the formation of a thioester linkage between MoaD and MoeB (5Rajagopalan K.V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 6Furukawa K. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol.

It has been shown recently that the physiological sulfur donor for the formation of the dithiolene group of MPT is likely to be l-cysteine and that a NifS-like protein is involved in the mobilization and transfer of sulfur from cysteine to MPT synthase (9Leimkühler S. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22024-22031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This article describes the characterization of the mechanism of action of E. coli MoeB. Studies on cysteine to alanine mutants of MoeB revealed that all of them retained activity, with the exception of mutations in the cysteine residues of the two conserved Zn-binding sequences. No evidence was found for the formation of a thioester intermediate between MPT synthase and MoeB or for the covalent binding of the cysteine-derived sulfur to MoeB. We propose a model for the role of MoeB in the activation of MPT synthase in which MoeB is only involved in the formation of an acyl-adenylate of MoaD, a mechanism that only partially resembles the first step of the ubiquitin-targeted degradation of proteins in eukaryotes. E. coli moeB − (DE3) andmoaD − mutant strains used in this study are isogenic mutants described previously (9Leimkühler S. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22024-22031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 10Johnson M.E. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 117-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coliBL21(DE3) cells and pET15b were obtained from Novagen. Cell strains containing expression plasmids were grown aerobically at 30 °C in LB medium in the presence of 150 μg/ml ampicillin or 50 μg/ml carbenicillin. Superdex 75, Superose 12, and Phenyl-Sepharose resins were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and Q-Sepharose resin was purchased from Sigma. Inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy was performed by Garrat Callahan Company (Millbrae, CA). Precursor Z was isolated from E. coli moaD − cells by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using reverse phase and anion exchange columns (11Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13493-13498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cloned MPT synthase was expressed from a pET15b vector (Novagen) in E. coli moeB −(DE3) cells, and the protein was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and gel filtration as described by Rudolph et al. (2Rudolph M.J. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). E. coli cysteine sulfinate desulfinase (CSD) was expressed in a pET15b vector in BL21(DE3) cells and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography (9Leimkühler S. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22024-22031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The gene encoding E. coli moeB was cloned from genomic DH5α DNA by polymerase chain reaction. The published gene sequence (12Nohno T. Kasai Y. Saito T. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4097-4102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to design primers that permitted cloning into the NcoI and BamHI sites of the multiple cloning region of the pET15b expression vector. The resulting plasmid was designated pMW15eB. For expression, 6-liter cultures of BL21(DE3) cells transformed with pMW15eB were grown in LB medium containing carbenicillin to anA600 of 0.6. The cultures were then induced by the addition of 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After 4 h of aerobic growth at 30 °C, the cells were harvested, resuspended with a total of 60 ml of 50 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and frozen at −20 °C. The cell suspension was lysed by two passes through a French pressure cell, and the resulting extract was centrifuged at 17,000 ×g. All subsequent steps were carried out in buffers containing 5 mm DTT. The volume of the extract was increased to 800 ml with suspension buffer, and 88 ml of 2% w/v streptomycin sulfate was added. After centrifugation, solid ammonium sulfate (243 g/liter) was slowly added to the supernatant. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation, and a second aliquot of ammonium sulfate (48.5 g/liter) was added to the supernatant. After centrifugation, the pellet was suspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and dialyzed overnight against the same buffer. The dialyzed sample was applied to a Q-Sepharose column (50-ml bed volume) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and MoeB was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.25–0.7 m NaCl using anAmersham Pharmacia Biotech FPLC system. Fractions containing MoeB were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The sample was then divided in half, and each half was brought to 15% saturation with ammonium sulfate immediately before injection onto a Phenyl-Sepharose column (25-ml bed volume) equilibrated in the same buffer. MoeB was subsequently eluted from the column with a 15% to 0% saturated ammonium sulfate gradient. After concentration, the protein was chromatographed on a 100-ml Superose 12 column. Fractions containing pure MoeB were pooled and dialyzed against 25 mm Tris, 10 mm NaCl, and 5 mm DTT, pH 7.5. The transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH) was employed for the generation of the single and double amino acid substitutions C44A, C128A, C128Y, C142A, C172A, C175A, C187A, C142A/C187A, C231A, C244A, and C247A within MoeB expressed from pMW15eB. The nucleotide sequence substitutions were verified by automated sequencing. E. coli moeB −(DE3) cells containing the mutant forms of pMW15eB were grown in 3 liters of LB medium containing ampicillin and induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside as described for the wild type. For the purification of the MoeB variants, the cell pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, and lysed as described above. After streptomycin sulfate treatment, each MoeB variant was precipitated by the addition of 277 g/liter ammonium sulfate. After centrifugation, the protein was resolubilized and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm DTT, pH 7.5. The dialyzed sample was applied to a 25-ml Q-Sepharose FPLC column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mmDTT, pH 7.5, and the mutant protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl. The pool of fractions containing MoeB was concentrated to 1 ml and chromatographed on a Superose 12 column equilibrated and eluted with 50 mm Tris, 1 mmEDTA, 5 mm DTT, and 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. For the in vitro formation of MPT, inactive MPT synthase, MoeB, MgCl2, ATP, precursor Z, and CSD-bound persulfide were incubated in a total volume of 400 μl of 100 mm Tris, pH 7.2, as described previously (9Leimkühler S. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22024-22031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For the generation of CSD-bound persulfide, CSD was incubated for 5 min with l-cysteine at 4 °C, followed by passage through a PD10 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to remove excess l-cysteine as described by Leimkühler and Rajagopalan (9Leimkühler S. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22024-22031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In vitroproduction of MPT was quantitated by conversion to form A, its stable, fluorescent degradation product. For this conversion, the incubation mixtures were adjusted to pH 2.5 and excess iodine was added (13Johnson J.L. Hainline B.E. Rajagopalan K.V. Arison B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5414-5422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Leimkühler S. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1837-1844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Form A was quantitated by subsequent HPLC analysis with an Alltech C18 HPLC column equilibrated with 50 mm ammonium acetate and 10% methanol, pH 6.8 (9Leimkühler S. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22024-22031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, eluates of a Superdex 75 gel filtration column were heated at 95 °C in buffer containing 2% SDS and 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Perfect Protein Markers from Novagen were used as molecular mass standards. Electrophoresis was carried out on 15% polyacrylamide Ready Gels (Bio-Rad), and the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R (Sigma). Mass spectrometric data were acquired on a Micromass Quattro LC triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Altrincham) equipped with a pneumatically assisted electrostatic ion source operating at atmospheric pressure and in a positive ion mode. The protein samples in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.2, were analyzed in 50% aqueous acetonitrile containing 1% formic acid by loop injection into a stream of 50% aqueous acetonitrile flowing at 10 ml/min. The native protein samples were electrosprayed in 0.01 mammonium acetate. Spectra were acquired in the multichannel analyzer mode from m/z 1000–1800 (scan time, 5 s). The mass scale was calibrated using the multiply charged envelope of myoglobin (16,951.48 Da). The raw mass spectra were transformed to a molecular mass scale using a maximum entropy-based method (MaxEnt) that uses the MemSys5 program (MaxEnt Solutions Ltd., Cambridge, United Kingdom) and is part of the MassLynx software suite. Homologous expression of MoeB cloned from genomic E. coli DNA yielded a protein with an approximate monomeric mass of 25 kDa as the major soluble protein after cell lysis (Fig. 1). This value corresponds closely to the calculated molecular mass of 26,719 Da for MoeB. The protein was purified by fractionated ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by chromatography on Q-Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose, and Superose 12 columns as shown in Fig. 1. By this procedure, ∼50 mg of MoeB can be obtained from a 6-liter E. coli culture. After Superose 12 gel filtration chromatography, the purified protein displayed a single band on Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-stained SDS gels, and gel filtration experiments showed that in its native state, MoeB is a dimer with a molecular mass of about 52 kDa (data not shown). From the amino acid sequence alignment shown in Fig.2, it can be seen that E. coliMoeB shares significant sequence identities with E. coliThiF, a protein involved in thiamine biosynthesis (15Begley T.P. Downs D.M. Ealick S.E. McLafferty F.W. Van Loon A.P. Taylor S. Campobasso N. Chiu H.J. Kinsland C. Reddick J.J. Xi J. Arch.

Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7462-7465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These proteins and S. cerevisiae Uba1 (data not shown) (8Appleyard M.V.C.L. Sloan J. Kana'n G.J.M. Heck I.S. Kinghorn J.R. Unkles S.E. J. Biol.

In addition, two CXXC motifs were identified near the C terminus of MoeB, which are also highly conserved in ThiF, HesA, and Uba4 (Fig. 2) but are not present in Uba1 (8Appleyard M.V.C.L. Sloan J.

The sequence similarity of E. coli MoeB and Uba1 from a variety of sources has led to the proposal that the mechanisms of ATP-dependent MPT synthesis and ATP-dependent ubiquitination are similar (2Rudolph M.J. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 5Rajagopalan K.V. Biochem. Soc.

Chem. 2000; 275: 7462-7465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The process of ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation is initiated by the adenylation of the carboxylate of the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin, followed by attachment of ubiquitin to a cysteine of the activating enzyme Uba1 to form a thioester. It has been shown that the active site cysteines of E1-like enzymes in eukaryotes are located ∼10–20 amino acid residues from a metal-binding motif (6Furukawa K. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7462-7465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Several conserved cysteine residues have been identified in theE. coli MoeB protein (Fig. 2). To ascertain which E. coli MoeB cysteine residue was involved in the formation of the putative thioester linkage with MoaD, site-directed mutagenesis was performed to replace each MoeB cysteine residue with an alanine (Fig.1). Appleyard et al. (8Appleyard M.V.C.L. Sloan J. Kana'n G.J.M. Heck I.S. Kinghorn J.R. Unkles S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14869-14876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) have reported that mutation of residue Cys-263 in Aspergillus nidulans CnxF (the MoeB equivalent in this organism) to a tyrosine results in a loss of function of the protein for MPT biosynthesis. Accordingly, the C128Y mutant was generated in E. coli MoeB. In addition, the C142A/C187A double mutant was created. To characterize the MoeB mutants and determine their activities in comparison to the wild type protein, all MoeB variants were expressed and purified from an E. coli moeB − strain. The activities of the purified proteins were analyzed by their ability to activate inactive MPT synthase in vitro in mixtures containing precursor Z, Mg-ATP, and CSD-bound persulfide (9Leimkühler S. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22024-22031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). CSD, described as sulfinate desulfinase (17Mihara H. Kurihara T. Yoshimura T. Soda K. Esaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22417-22424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), has been shown to form an internal persulfide by transfer of sulfur from freel-cysteine to a thiol group within itself. This CSD-persulfide can act as the in vitro sulfur donor for the sulfuration of MPT synthase in an ATP-dependent reaction requiring the MoeB protein (9Leimkühler S. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22024-22031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The formation of activated MPT synthase is demonstrated by its ability to convert precursor Z to MPT in vitro. Subsequent acidic iodine treatment converts the generated MPT to its oxidized fluorescent degradation product, form A, which is quantitated by HPLC analysis (13Johnson J.L. Hainline B.E. Rajagopalan K.V. Arison B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5414-5422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the in vitro production of MPT, the assays contained precursor Z, inactive MPT synthase, CSD-persulfide, Mg-ATP, and wild type or mutated MoeB. As shown in Fig. 3, the majority of the MoeB mutants exhibit activities comparable to that of wild type MoeB. The exceptions are mutations C172A, C175A, C244A, and C247A in the highly conserved Zn-binding motifs. Because all other cysteine to alanine mutations showed MPT production equivalent to that of the wild type, it can be concluded that none of the cysteine residues within MoeB are required for the sulfur transfer reaction for the activation of MPT synthase. The C128Y variant exhibited no activity as seen for the equivalent mutant in A. nidulans (8Appleyard M.V.C.L. Sloan J. Kana'n G.J.M. Heck I.S. Kinghorn J.R. Unkles S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14869-14876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, because the C128A mutant was completely active, it can be postulated that insertion of a tyrosine at this position disrupts the structure of the protein. Inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy was performed on purified MoeB and the mutated variants C172A, C175A, C244A, and C247A to determine the Zn content of the proteins. TableI shows that whereas the wild type protein contains a near stoichiometric amount of Zn, no Zn was identified in the mutated variants analyzed. These results agree with the previous suggestion that the two conserved CXXC motifs are responsible for the binding of Zn (5Rajagopalan K.V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The residual activities exhibited by the C244A and C247A variants (Fig. 3) are probably a reflection of the traces of other metals (e.g. Cu) found in the purified proteins. This suggests that other metals may be able to at least partially fulfill the role of Zn in the activity of MoeB.Table IAnalysis of the Zn content of MoeB and MoeB variants by inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopyMoeB variantZn contentaInductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy was performed by Garrat Callahan Company.(%)MoeB75C172A-b-, below the limit of detection.C175A-b-, below the limit of detection.C244A-b-, below the limit of detection.C247A-b-, below the limit of detection.a Inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy was performed by Garrat Callahan Company.b -, below the limit of detection. Open table in a new tab It was shown earlier that in an in vitrosystem, inorganic sulfide can circumvent the requirement forl-cysteine and a sulfurtransferase in the activation of MPT synthase (9Leimkühler S. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22024-22031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To investigate the possibility that a sulfur atom is attached to MoeB during the activation of MPT synthase, purified MoeB was incubated with inorganic sulfide for 30 min at room temperature. Excess sulfide was then removed by gel filtration. The filtered protein was incubated with inactive MPT synthase, Mg-ATP, and precursor Z for 30 min at room temperature under aerobic conditions to determine the ability of sulfide-treated MoeB to produce MPT in vitro. As shown in Table II, no form A was detected after acidic iodine treatment of the incubation mixture, implying that MoeB is not directly sulfurated by inorganic sulfide. Inclusion of Mg-ATP in the incubation mixture before gel filtration did not alter the results (Table II). Similarly, direct treatment of MPT synthase with sulfide in the presence or absence of Mg-ATP did not produce a sulfurated form of MPT synthase because no MPT was formed by the gel-filtered sample after the addition of precursor Z (Table II). However, when both MoeB and MPT synthase were incubated in the presence of inorganic sulfide and Mg-ATP before gel filtration, MPT was formed after the addition of precursor Z (Table II). In addition, the sulfide-dependent activation of MPT synthase by MoeB is ATP-dependent since MPT formation was only observed when Mg-ATP was included in the mixture before gel filtration (TableII).Table IIFormation of MPT after the incubation of MoeB and MPT synthase with sulfide and Mg-ATPTreatmenta82 μm MoeB, 34 μm MPT synthase, 50 mm sodium sulfide, or 20 mm Mg-ATP was incubated for 30 min at room temperature.

Open table in a new tab The data presented above suggested that MoeB itself is not sulfurated during the sulfur transfer reaction for the activation of MPT synthase and that its role is limited to generation of the acyl adenylate of MoaD.

Fig. 4 Ashows that MoeB and MoaD coelute and are well separated from the MoaE subunit during gel filtration, indicating that the MoaD subunit is released from the MPT synthase tetramer during the formation of the MoeB-MoaD adenylate complex. The clear separation of the MoeB-MoaD adenylate complex from the 33.9-kDa MoaE dimer indicates that the complex is a tetramer with a mass of 71.8 kDa. We propose that the two MoaD bands visualized in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 A) represent the difference in molecular mass between the adenylated (9.1 kDa) and the nonadenylated (8.8 kDa) forms of MoaD. In the absence of Mg-ATP, no separation of the MoaD subunit from the MoaE subunit was observed, revealing that the formation of the MoeB-MoaD complex is ATP-dependent (Fig. 4 B). Because of the similar molecular masses of the MPT synthase tetramer (51.6 kDa) and the MoeB dimer (53.4 kDa), these proteins have similar elution profiles during gel filtration (Fig. 4 B). To obt"

Although this protein is known to function as an essential ferroxidase, the role of ceruloplasmin in copper transport and metabolism remains unclear. To elucidate the role of ceruloplasmin in copper metabolism, the kinetics of copper absorption, transport, distribution, and excretion were examined utilizing64Cu in wild-type and aceruloplasminemic mice. No differences in gastrointestinal absorption, hepatic uptake, or biliary excretion were observed in these animals. Furthermore, steady state measurements of tissue copper content utilizing 64Cu and atomic absorption spectroscopy revealed no differences in the copper content of the brain, heart, spleen, and kidney. Consistent with these findings, the activity of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase in these tissues was equivalent in wild-type and ceruloplasmin-deficient mice. Hepatic iron was elevated 3.5-fold in aceruloplasminemic mice because of the loss of ferroxidase function. Hepatic copper content was markedly increased in aceruloplasminemic mice. As no differences were observed in copper absorption or biliary copper excretion, these data suggest that in these animals, hepatocyte copper intended for ceruloplasmin incorporation is trafficked into a compartment that is less available for biliary copper excretion. Taken together, these data reveal no essential role for ceruloplasmin in copper metabolism and suggest a previously unappreciated complexity to the subcellular distribution of this metal within the hepatocyte secretory pathway."

We report that the use of alternate exons, each coding for 48 amino acids, generates isoforms of human CYP4F3 that differ in substrate specificity, tissue distribution, and biological function. Both isoforms contain a total of 520 amino acids. CYP4F3A, which incorporates exon 4, inactivates LTB4 by ω-hydroxylation (Km = 0.68 μm) but has low activity for arachidonic acid (Km = 185 μm); it is the only CYP4F isoform expressed in myeloid cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow. CYP4F3B incorporates exon 3 and is selectively expressed in liver and kidney; it is also the predominant CYP4F isoform in trachea and tissues of the gastrointestinal tract. CYP4F3B has a 30-fold higherKm for LTB4 compared with CYP4F3A, but it utilizes arachidonic acid as a substrate for ω-hydroxylation (Km = 22 μm) and generates 20-HETE, an activator of protein kinase C and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II. Homology modeling demonstrates that the alternative exon has a position in the molecule which could enable it to contribute to substrate interactions. The results establish that tissue-specific alternative splicing of pre-mRNA can be used as a mechanism for changing substrate specificity and increasing the functional diversity of cytochrome P450 genes.

Fifty-five human CYP genes have been classified into 17 families and 40 subfamilies. 2Web address: drnelson.utmem.edu/CytochromeP450.html.2Web address: drnelson.utmem.edu/CytochromeP450.html. Phylogenetic studies indicate that all CYPs derive from duplication and divergence of an ancestral gene, and this radiation of CYP genes accounts for the diverse substrate utilization by the superfamily. To date, alternative splicing of CYP pre-mRNAs is not considered a mechanism that contributes to this functional diversity. CYP-dependent oxidation of arachidonic acid generates biologically active eicosanoids that function as intracellular mediators in normal physiology and disease. Members of the CYP2C and CYP2J subfamilies act as arachidonic acid epoxygenases and generate eicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which regulate ion channels and are candidates for endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (1Fisslthaler B.

CYP4 enzymes catalyze ω-hydroxylation of fatty acids including arachidonic acid and are a potential source of 20-HETE. 20-HETE is a potent activator of protein kinase C and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II and has roles in regulating vascular tone, natriuresis, and cell proliferation (3Nowicki S.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15110-15120Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The identity and distribution of enzymes generating 20-HETE in humans is poorly understood. This determination is complicated by wide-ranging Kmvalues of different enzymes for arachidonic acid, distinct patterns of tissue expression of the relevant enzymes, close homology between subfamily members, and variation between species. The human enzyme CYP4A11 has been shown to generate 20-HETE (9Palmer C.N. Richardson T.H. Griffin K.J. Hsu M.H. Muerhoff A.S. Clark J.E. Johnson E.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1172: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), but it exhibits very low activity for arachidonic acid (10Hoch U. Zhang Z. Kroetz D.L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Recently it was suggested that ω-hydroxylation of arachidonic acid in human liver and kidney is mediated primarily by CYP4F2 (11Powell P.K. Wolf I. Jin R. Lasker J.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Therap. 1998; 285: 1327-1336PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lasker J.M. Chen W.B. Wolf I. Bloswick B.P. Wilson P.D. Powell P.K. J. Biol.

In addition to activating arachidonic acid, CYPs can inactivate LTB4 and prostaglandins by ω-hydroxylation. CYP4F3 was originally identified as the enzyme that catalyzes ω-oxidation of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway product LTB4 with a lowKm (0.5–1.0 μm) in human neutrophils (13Shak S. Goldstein I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10181-10187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Soberman R.J. Harper T.W. Murphy R.C. Austen K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Smith M.J.H. Nature. 1980; 286: 26465Crossref Scopus (1584) Google Scholar, 17Migliorisi G. Folkes E. Pawlowski N. Cramer E.B. Am. J. Pathol. 1987; 127: 157-167PubMed Google Scholar), and CYP4F3 has been projected to play a role in the termination of LTB4-mediated inflammation. We identified an alternative splice form of CYP4F3 in liver (18Christmas P. Ursino S.R. Fox J.W. Soberman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21191-21199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and designated the two isoforms CYP4F3A (the original isoform detected in neutrophils) and CYP4F3B (the isoform detected in liver). Both isoforms have 520 amino acids but are distinguished by the alternate use of exons that code for amino acids 67–114. CYP4F3B contains exon 3, whereas CYP4F3A contains exon 4. These exons are identical in size but code for sequences that share only 27% amino acid identity. CYP4F3B has lower activity for LTB4 and is not expressed in myeloid cells, whereas CYP4F3A is not expressed in liver. We analyzed the tissue distribution and kinetic properties of CYP4F3B to determine its functional significance. CYP4F3B has an expression pattern that is distinct from CYP4F3A and is the predominant CYP4F enzyme in liver and other non-hematopoietic tissues. It has aKm for arachidonic acid of 22 μm and generates 20-HETE as the major product of ω-hydroxylation. In contrast, arachidonic acid is a very poor substrate for CYP4F3A. We used molecular modeling to predict the position of amino acids 67–114 within the molecule. These studies suggest that exons 3 and 4 code for a region that contributes to the active site and substrate access channel. Selection between these exons determines the ability of the enzyme to either inactivate LTB4 (CYP4F3A) or activate arachidonic acid (CYP4F3B). The results demonstrate that tissue-specific alternative splicing of pre-mRNA must now be considered a mechanism for generating functional diversity of cytochrome P450s. Microsomes containing human CYPs (specific content of 640 pmol of 4F3B/mg of protein or 36 pmol of 4F3A/mg of protein), P450 reductase, and cytochrome b5(SupersomesTM) were prepared from baculovirus-infected BTI-TN-5B1-4 cells by Gentest Corporation. To assay the conversion of LTB4 to 20-hydroxy-LTB4, reaction mixtures containing Supersomes (10 pmol of CYP enzyme), LTB4, 1 mm NADPH, and 100 mm KPO4buffer, pH 7.4 were incubated in a final volume of 0.1 ml for 20 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated with 0.1 ml of 94% acetonitrile, 6% glacial acetic acid and centrifuged at 10,000 × gfor 3 min. The supernatant (60–85 μl) was injected into a Zorbax C18-SB reverse phase HPLC column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm) coupled to a 5-μm Waters Sentry guard column and separated with a linear gradient of 30% acetonitrile, 2 mm perchloric acid to 70% methanol over 24 min at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The product was detected by absorbance at 270 nm using a Waters 2487 UV detector and its identity confirmed by comparing the retention time of a 20-hydroxy-LTB4 standard (Cayman). Kinetic results were analyzed by non-linear regression (Sigma Plot Software, SPSS inc., Chicago, IL) using eight substrate concentrations in a range of 0.2–20 μm (4F3A) or 2–80 μm (4F3B). To assay the conversion of arachidonic acid to 20-HETE, reaction mixtures containing Supersomes (10 pmol of CYP enzyme), arachidonic acid, 0.15 μCi of [14C]arachidonic acid (810 Ci/mmol), 1 mmNADPH, and 100 mm KPO4 buffer, pH 7.4 were incubated in a final volume of 0.1 ml for 10 min at room temperature. The reactions were terminated and injected into a C18reverse phase HPLC column as before and separated with a linear gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H20 to 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile over 24 min at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The product was detected by on-line monitoring with a RadioFlow detector (Flo-One Beta 150TR, Packard BioScience). The retention time of a 20-HETE standard (Cayman) was determined by absorbance at 205 nm. Kinetic results were analyzed by linear regression using 8 substrate concentrations in a range of 1.0–150 μm (4F3A) or 0.5–60 μm (4F3B). The kinetic experiments were performed under conditions where less than 10% of the substrate was converted to product. CYP4F3 cDNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming. The full-length coding region of CYP4F3A and a partial cDNA betweenNsiI and EagI sites (nucleotides 561–1268) were used to generate probes of 1560 bp and 708 bp, respectively. Multiple Tissue Northern (MTN) Blots from CLONTECH were hybridized with the 1560-bp probe for the full-length coding region (5 ng/ml, ∼106 cpm/ng) in 10 ml of ExpressHyb (CLONTECH) for 1 h at 68 °C. The blots were washed in 2× SSC, 0.05% SDS at room temperature for 4 × 10 min and then 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C for 2× 20 min. A Human Multiple Tissue Expression (MTE) Array fromCLONTECH was hybridized with the 708-bp probe (2 ng/ml, ∼2 × 106 cpm/ng) for 6 h at 65 °C in 10 ml of ExpressHyb supplemented with 300 μg of sheared salmon testes DNA (Sigma), 60 μg C0t-1 DNA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 100 μl of 20× SSC. The partial cDNA probe was used because it gave lower background than the full-length probe, and nucleotides 561–1268 were selected for this probe to ensure that both isoforms of CYP4F3 would be recognized with equal efficiency. The array was washed in 2× SSC, 1% SDS at 65 °C for 5× 20 min and then 0.1× SSC, 0.5% SDS at 55 °C for 2× 20 min. The MTN Blots and MTE Array were exposed to Kodak XAR film overnight at −70 °C with an intensifying screen. Hybridization signals on the MTE Array were quantified with a phosphorimager (Cyclone, Packard BioScience) and expressed relative to peripheral blood leukocytes. RNA was extracted from freshly isolated human bone marrow cells (1–2 × 106 cells) using the RNeasy Kit (QIAGEN) with QIAshredder columns for cell homogenization. Total RNA was purified from peripheral blood neutrophils as previously described (18Christmas P. Ursino S.R. Fox J.W. Soberman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21191-21199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Total and poly(A)+ RNA from liver, fetal liver, kidney, prostate, ileum, and trachea were from CLONTECH. First-strand cDNA synthesis for PCR was performed using the cDNA Cycle Kit (Invitrogen) with AMV reverse transcriptase and random primers. The cDNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Primers B, C, G, and H (TableI) were used to detect CYP4F3A (primer pair B-C), CYP4F3B (B-G), and CYP4F2 (H-G) by isoform-specific PCR as previously described (18Christmas P. Ursino S.R. Fox J.W. Soberman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21191-21199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The PCR conditions were 94 °C for 1 min, 52 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min; 30 cycles were followed by 1 cycle with a 10 min extension time. Primers specific for CYP4F8 (K-L) and CYP4F11 (M-N) were used under the same PCR conditions except for annealing temperatures of 65 °C and 62 °C, respectively.Table ISummary of primersNameDirectioncDNAPositionSequence (5′ to 3′)Asense4F3A, 4F3B, 4F2, 4F1176–97GGGGCCTCCTGGCTCCTGGCCCBsense4F3A, 4F3B165–184GAAACGGAATTGGTTCTTGGCantisense4F3A340–322GAGCAAAGAGCACAGGCTTDantisense4F3A, 4F3B, 4F2, 4F11524–507TGCATGATGTTCACACTCEantisense4F3A, 4F3B1212–1186TTGGGTGCAGCAGCGAGAGACGGCAGGFsense4F3B277–307GGCCCCATCTTCCCCGTCATCCGTTTTTGCCGantisense4F3B, 4F2340–322AGGCGTTGATGACAGACCGHsense4F2165–184AAGACGGAACTGGTTTTGGGIsense4F2277–306GGACCCATCTCCCCCCTCCTCAGTTTGTGCJantisense4F21212–1186CTGGGTGACATGGCGGGAGATGACCGGKsense4F8281–313CCATCACTCCCATCATCAACTTGTGCCACCCTGLantisense4F81212–1187CTGGGTGCAGCCGCGGGCGAATGTAGMsense4F11203–229CTCCCACGGAAGAGGGCATGAAGACATNantisense4F11349–325CAGCAGCTGAGGCACTGGTGATAGGGDHFsenseGAPDH31–61TTTGGTCGTATTGGGCGCCTGGTCACCAGGGGDHRantisenseGAPDH488–458ACCTTGGCCAGGGGTGCTAAGCAGTTGGTGGSequences of primers referred to in text are shown. cDNA positions are relative to the ATG initiation codon (A = +1). Open table in a new tab Sequences of primers referred to in text are shown. cDNA positions are relative to the ATG initiation codon (A = +1). cDNA samples generated as described above were used to estimate the relative levels of expression of different CYP4F gene products. A variety of primers specific for CYP4F gene products (CYP4F3A, CYP4F3B, CYP4F2) and internal standards (GAPDH, cyclophilin A, 18 S rRNA) were tested in semiquantitative PCR experiments. Primer pair E-F (CYP4F3B-specific, 962-bp product), or I-J (CYP4F2-specific, 962-bp product), worked well in combination with the internal standard primers GDHF and GDHR (GAPDH-specific, 458-bp product). The PCR conditions were 94 °C for 1 min, 68 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, 20 cycles. This cycle number was selected after comparing the linear range of 32P incorporation for the different cDNAs and primer pairs used, and it represents a point within the linear range for all samples. Each reaction contained 5 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP, unlabeled dNTPs at a final concentration of 0.2 mm each, and 20 pmol of each primer. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 6% sequencing gel (SequaGel System, National Diagnostics). The gel was dried onto filter paper, and the products were visualized by exposure to Kodak XAR film and quantified with a phosphorimager. The relative CYP4F isoform expression level in each sample was determined by comparing the intensity of the CYP4F and GAPDH signals. The results of four experiments using different RNA batches were used to determine the mean ± S.D. A limited number of primers can be designed that are specific for CYP4F3A, and these failed to give PCR products when combined with primers for the internal standards required in quantitative PCR experiments. We attempted to use a variety of primer sequences, primer lengths, and annealing temperatures for CYP4F3A and internal standards that included GAPDH, cyclophilin A, and 18 S rRNA + competimers (Ambion) to eliminate this problem. None of these was successful, though the reasons for the inhibition were not clear. An alternative method for quantifying the relative levels of CYP4F3A in tissues was developed using a generic CYP4F primer pair (A-D), which generates a 449-bp PCR product from CYP4F3A, CYP4F3B, CYP4F2, and CYP4F11. PCR was performed: 94 °C for 1 min, 52 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min; 20 cycles were followed by 1 cycle with a 10 min extension time. The PCR products obtained from each tissue were then ligated into pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and transformed into TOP10 cells. Individual colonies were picked for isolation of plasmid DNA and sequence analysis. A minimum of 50 colonies from each tissue were analyzed. Two methods of analysis of plasmid DNA were performed, which gave identical results: plasmid DNA from 50% of colonies were sequenced; alternatively, restriction digests were used to predict the outcome of sequence analysis. The 449-bp PCR products generated by primer pair A-D contain sites for both MscI andHincII (CYP4F2), HincII only (CYP4F11),MscI only (CYP4F3B), or neither enzyme (CYP4F3A). A comparison of the restriction pattern generated with MscIversus HincII predicts the identity of the PCR product. CYP4F8 and CYP4F12 are excluded from this analysis. Initial alignments of P450BM3 and CYP4A1 from rat were taken from the work of Hasemannet al. (19Hasemann C.A. Kurumbail R.G. Boddupalli S.S. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. Structure. 1995; 3: 41-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). CYP4A1 was aligned with the CYP4F enzymes with the multiple sequence alignment program ClustalW and the PAM250 similarity matrix. A second alignment was performed on amino acids 50–150 using ClustalW and the sequences for 4A7, 4A11, 4B1, 4F2, 4F3A, 4F3B, 4F12, and BM3. A three-dimensional homology model was constructed from these alignments using the program Modeler (20Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10512) Google Scholar). This program uses a combination of molecular dynamics and restraints based on the known structures of homologous enzymes. Thus, this program will give a three-dimensional representation of an alignment that has a predicted structure similar to the known structure. The degree of similarity between target and model is dependent on the degree of implied homology in the alignments. Thus, structure in areas with inserts will be determined solely by the molecular dynamics force field, and areas without inserts will give a weighted average of the restraints and the force field. Five members of the human CYP4F subfamily have been described: 4F3 (15Kikuta Y. Kusunose E. Endo K. Yamamoto S. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Kusunose M. J. Biol.

Our analysis of the 4F3 gene identified an additional exon which can participate in alternative splicing reactions (18Christmas P. Ursino S.R. Fox J.W. Soberman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21191-21199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The 4F3 and 4F2 genes are now considered to have 14 exons as shown in Fig.1. Exons 3 and 4 in the 4F3gene are identical in size (145 bp) and are mutually exclusive, each coding for amino acids 67–114. The cDNA of 4F3 originally isolated from human neutrophils (now designated 4F3A) contains exon 4, which lacks a homologous counterpart in other 4F cDNAs. 4F3B contains exon 3, which shows high identity with the exon coding for amino acids 67–114 in all other 4F members. Exon 3 in 4F3B has 83, 75, 66, and 60% amino acid identity with the corresponding exon in 4F2, 4F8, 4F11, and 4F12, respectively. This identity is highest for 4F2, and in all cases is much greater than the 27% seen between exons 3 and 4 within the 4F3 gene. Analysis of genomic sequences determined that a homolog of 4F3 exon 4 is present in the 4F2gene (18Christmas P. Ursino S.R. Fox J.W. Soberman R.J. J. Biol.

A reassignment of 14 exons to the 4F2gene, analogous to 4F3, is shown in Fig. 1. To determine the significance of alternative splicing we investigated whether 4F3B has a distinct substrate preference and tissue distribution compared with 4F3A, and whether a novel isoform of 4F2 containing exon 4 is expressed. The 4F3B enzyme converts LTB4 to 20-hydroxy-LTB4 (Fig.2A) with aKm of 20.6 μm using a substrate concentration range of 1–80 μm. Substrate inhibition was observed at higher concentrations of LTB4 (onset > 80 μm) for 4F3B, but not 4F3A. The Km of 4F3A for LTB4 was 0.68 μm, consistent with previous reports (14Soberman R.J.

Minor products with retention times of 16.8 min and 13.7 min likely correspond with the oxidation products 20-aldehyde-AA and 20-carboxy-AA, respectively, analogous to the conversion of 20-hydroxy-LTB4 to 20-aldehyde-LTB4 and 20-carboxy-LTB4 (13Shak S.

These products were not observed with higher concentrations of arachidonic acid or at shorter times of incubation and appear to result from the sequential oxidation of 20-HETE. 4F3B has a Km for arachidonic acid of 22 μm and a Vmax of 13.3 pmol of product/min/pmol of P450. As a comparison, the Km of 4F3A for arachidonic acid was determined to be 185.6 μmwith a Vmax of 11.5 pmol of product/min/pmol of P450. A summary of the kinetic data obtained for 4F3 isoforms using the Supersome system is shown in Table II. 4F3B has a V/K value that is 44-fold lower than 4F3A for LTB4, and 10-fold higher than 4F3A for arachidonic acid.Table IILTB4 and arachidonic acid ω-hydroxylation by CYP4F3 isoformsLTB4Arachidonic acidKmVmax2-bVmax values measured as pmol of product/min/pmol of P450.V/KKmVmaxV/Kμmmin−1μmmin−1CYP4F3A0.68 ± 0.252-aValues ± S.D.,n = 3.32.8 ± 1548.2185.6 ± 1.511.5 ± 0.30.06CYP4F3B20.6 ± 10.723.3 ± 1.11.122.0 ± 813.3 ± 5.60.62-a Values ± S.D.,n = 3.2-b Vmax values measured as pmol of product/min/pmol of P450.

The identities of the CYP4F transcripts expressed in each tissue were determined by isoform-specific RT-PCR (Fig.4A). Distinct patterns of expression were observed in different tissues. 4F3A was the only transcript that could be detected in RNA from peripheral blood neutrophils and bone marrow after 30 cycles of PCR. Fetal liver, kidney, prostate, and ileum contain 4F3B and 4F2 in addition to 4F3A. Trachea contains 4F3A and 4F3B, but not 4F2. Liver contains 4F3B and 4F2 but not 4F3A. The expression of exon 4 from the 4F2 gene was not detected in any of the tissues examined. Primers specific for 4F8 (K-L) or 4F11 (M-N) were included in RT-PCR experiments (data not shown). 4F8 could only be detected in prostate and required more than 30 cycles of PCR to give a visible band; 4F11 was detected in liver, kidney, prostate, ileum, and trachea. The relative levels of 4F3B and 4F2 in tissues were determined by quantitative RT-PCR using GAPDH primers as an internal standard (Fig.4B). The results are summarized in Table III. In addition, a sample of PCR products generated by the isoform-generic primer pair A-D (recognizes 4F3A, 4F3B, 4F2, and 4F11) was cloned and sequenced. Sequence analysis of cloned PCR products provides confirmation of isoform identity, and analysis of 50 PCR products (50 colonies from each tissue) predicted a similar ratio of 4F3B to 4F2 to that obtained by quantitative PCR (Table III).

The enzyme involved in this conversion has been identified recently as a cytochrome P-450 species denoted CYP46 (4Lund E.G. Guileyardo J.M. Russell D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7238-7243Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). This enzyme is almost exclusively located in the brain (4Lund E.G. Guileyardo J.M. Russell D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7238-7243Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), and evidence has been presented that more than 90% of the 24S-hydroxycholesterol in the human circulation originates from this organ (3Björkhem I.

Measurements of arteriovenous concentration differences across the brain and liver have shown that the liver eliminates an amount of 24-hydroxycholesterol similar to that produced by the brain (3Björkhem I.

Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1594-1600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In view of the fact that a hydroxyl group is introduced in the 24 position during the normal transformation of cholesterol into bile acids (6Björkhem I. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 455-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a conversion of 24S-hydroxycholesterol into bile acids would be expected. In the major pathway for biosynthesis of bile acids, the first and rate-limiting step is the introduction of a hydroxyl group in the 7α position by the cytochrome P-450 enzyme CYP7A. When human CYP7A was expressed in Escherichia coli and in simian COS cells, there was a significant activity toward 24-hydroxycholesterol (7Norlin M. Toll A. Björkhem I. Wikvall K. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1629-1639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is an alternative pathway for the conversion of cholesterol into bile acids in humans, starting with the oxidation of the steroid side chain followed by a 7α-hydroxylation catalyzed by the oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7B) (8Rose K.A. Stapleton G. Dott K. Kieny M.P. Best R. Schwarz M. Russell D.W. Björkhem I. Seckl J. Lathé R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4925-4930Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Surprisingly this enzyme has no significant activity toward 24S-hydroxycholesterol (7Norlin M. Toll A. Björkhem I. Wikvall K. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1629-1639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Zhang J. Akwa Y. El-Etr M. Baulieu E.-E. Sjövall J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Very recently, a new species of cytochrome P-450 denoted CYP39 was identified and found to have a high 7α-hydroxylase activity toward 24S-hydroxycholesterol (10Li-Hawkins J. Lund E.G. Bronson A.D. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16543-16549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).Because both CYP7A and CYP39 are present in human liver and because both are able to 7α-hydroxylate 24-hydroxycholesterol, one would expect an efficient conversion of 24-hydroxycholesterol into bile acids. In a recent pilot study, we incubated a racemic mixture of tritium-labeled 24R- and 24S-hydroxycholesterol with human primary hepatocytes. The conversion of this racemic mixture into the primary bile acids cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid was less than 10% of that of 7α-hydroxycholesterol. However, because only the 24S isomer occurs naturally and one isomer may inhibit the metabolism of the other, no firm conclusions could be drawn, from that study.To our knowledge, there is only one previous report concerned with the metabolism of 24-hydroxycholesterol in the mammalian liver (11Saucier S.F. Kandutsch A.A. Clark D.S. Spencer T.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1166: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In that report tritium-labeled 24R- and 24S-hydroxycholesterol were administered to mice. Because the tritium was located in positions 3 and 24 and would be expected to be lost in a conversion of the oxysterol into bile acids, no conclusion could be drawn regarding a possible metabolism into bile acids. More polar metabolites were formed from the two oxysterols, but their identities were never established.In the present work we have prepared 24R and 24S isomers of tritium-labeled 24-hydroxycholesterol and incubated them separately with human primary hepatocytes. In addition we have injected tritium-labeled 24S-hydroxycholesterol together with14C-labeled 7α-hydroxycholesterol in two human volunteers and studied the relative conversion of the two oxysterols into bile acids. Furthermore, we have identified and quantitated conjugates and a major hydroxylated metabolite of 24S-hydroxycholesterol in ileocecal contents from patients with ileocecal fistulae. The results show that 24S-hydroxycholesterol is less efficient than 7α-hydroxycholesterol as a precursor to bile acids in humans and that a considerable part is excreted as conjugates in bile with or without an additional hydroxyl group.DISCUSSIONThere are several mechanisms by which the liver may eliminate 24S-hydroxycholesterol. The oxysterol may be excreted as such or in conjugated form. Another possibility is that the steroid may be hydroxylated and then excreted as such or as a conjugate. Finally the oxysterol may be converted into cholic or chenodeoxycholic acid before excretion in bile. According to the present investigation all these mechanisms are operating in humans.The rate of conversion of 24S-hydroxycholesterol into bile acids was found to be ∼40% of that of 7α-hydroxycholesterol in most of the experiments with human hepatocytes and ∼50% of that of 7α-hydroxycholesterol in the in vivo experiment with the two volunteers. In the experiments with human hepatocytes, the major bile acids formed were cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid in proportions almost identical to those obtained in experiments with labeled 7α-hydroxycholesterol. The rate of conversion of 24R-hydroxycholesterol, an isomer not normally present in human tissues, was similar to that of 24S-hydroxycholesterol, with a similar pattern of products.Interestingly, 27-hydroxylated 24S-hydroxycholesterol (5-cholestene-3β,24S,27-triol) was found to be a quantitatively important metabolite in the experiments with the hepatocytes. This triol may be formed by the action of sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27) on 24S-hydroxycholesterol, and it was confirmed here that 24-hydroxycholesterol is a substrate for human CYP27. The rate of 27-hydroxylation of 24-hydroxycholesterol by reconstituted CYP27, however, was relatively low: lower than the rate of 27-hydroxylation of cholesterol by the same enzyme. The possibility can thus not be completely excluded that an enzyme other than CYP27 may be involved in the conversion. Another possibility is that it is a conjugate of 24S-hydroxycholesterol rather than the free steroid that is a substrate for CYP27 under in vivo conditions. In any case, it is evident that a substantial portion of 24S-hydroxycholesterol is converted into 5-cholestene-3β,24,27-triol as a first step, possibly as a consequence of a relatively inefficient 7α-hydroxylation. In contrast to 25-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol, both of which are 7α-hydroxylated efficiently by astrocytes and Schwann cells, 24-hydroxycholesterol is not 7α-hydroxylated by these cells (9Zhang J. Akwa Y. El-Etr M. Baulieu E.-E. Sjövall J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that 24S-hydroxycholesterol is not a substrate for the oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7B) (7Norlin M. Toll A. Björkhem I. Wikvall K. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1629-1639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this is probably the case also with 5-cholestene-3β,24S,27-triol. This may increase the biological half-life of the latter triol and may explain its relatively high excretion in ileocecal fluid. The extent to which 5-cholestene-3β,24S,27-triol is a natural intermediate in the conversion of 24S-hydroxycholesterol into bile acids cannot be evaluated from the present work.The results of the above experiments are consistent with a relatively inefficient conversion of 24S-hydroxycholesterol into bile acids and show that glucuronidation, sulfation, and 27-hydroxylation of the steroid side chain are important metabolic steps in the elimination of the steroid. This is in agreement with our previous finding of the sulfated and glucuronidated form of 24S-hydroxycholesterol as a major oxysterol in the plasma of infants with severe intrahepatic cholestasis (19Meng L.J. Griffith W.J. Nazer H. Yang Y. Sjövall J. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 926-934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Doubly conjugated cholestanetriols were also present in these samples. It is difficult, however, to quantitate the relative importance of the different metabolic events with use of these experimental models. Quantitative data could be obtained from the patients with an ileostomy, in which all steroid metabolites excreted in bile should be present in the ileocecal content. It was shown clearly that the amount of 24S-hydroxycholesterol excreted as free, sulfated, and/or glucuronidated steroid with or without an additional hydroxyl group in the 27-position was ∼3.5 mg/24 h. Because we have shown that the daily production of 24S-hydroxycholesterol in humans is 6–7 mg (3Björkhem I. Lütjohann D. Diczfalusy U. Ståhle L. Ahlborg G. Wahren J. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1594-1600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it can be concluded that the normal conversion of 24S-hydroxycholesterol into of bile acids is about 3 mg/24 h.Approximately 10% of the 24S-hydroxycholesterol present in circulation and brain has been reported to be sulfated (1Lütjohann D. Breuer O. Ahlborg G. Nennesmo I. Sidén Å. Diczfalusy U. Björkhem I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9799-9804Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 23Prasad V.V. Ponticorvo L. Liebermann S. J. Steroid Biochem. 1984; 21: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and sulfated 24S-hydroxycholesterol has also been reported to be present in human feces (24Gustafsson J.-Å. Sjövall J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 8: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The present study shows that glucuronidation is a most important reaction in the metabolism of 24S-hydroxycholesterol in humans without liver disease. Thus, the formation of the double conjugate is not limited to patients with severe cholestatic conditions (19Meng L.J. Griffith W.J. Nazer H. Yang Y. Sjövall J. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 926-934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The sites of conjugation have not been determined and neither has the order in which conjugation occurs. However, it is reasonable to assume that the double conjugate is a 3-sulfate,24-glucuronide, as was found to be the case in cholestatic infants (19Meng L.J. Griffith W.J. Nazer H. Yang Y. Sjövall J. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 926-934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The relatively slow hepatic metabolism of 24S-hydroxycholesterol may explain the relatively high concentration of this oxysterol in the circulation. We have shown previously that the half-life of deuterium-labeled racemic 24-hydroxycholesterol is 10–14 h, whereas the corresponding half-life of 7α-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol is less than 1 h (3Björkhem I.

Lütjohann D. von Bergmann K. Wennmalm Å. Diczfalusy U. Björkhem I. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 70-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the low production of 24S-hydroxycholesterol, its plasma concentration is higher than that of any other oxysterol in infants and only slightly lower than that of 27-hydroxycholesterol in adults (12Dzeletovic S. Breuer O. Lund E. Diczfalusy U. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 225: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar).Based on its inhibitory action on hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase in isolated cells and the concentration of this oxysterol in mouse liver, 24S-hydroxycholesterol has been suggested to be an important physiological regulator of cholesterol homeostasis (25Saucier S.E. Kandutsch A.A. Gayen A.K. Swahn D.K. Spencer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6863-6869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this connection it is of interest that 24S-hydroxycholesterol has a relatively high affinity to the nuclear receptor LXRα (26Janowski B.A. Willy P.J. Devi T.R. Falck J.R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar), which is known to mediate cholesterol-induced effects on cholesterol degradation (27Peet D.J. Turley S.D. Ma W. Janowski B.A. Lobaccaro J.-M.A. Hammer R.E. Mangelsdorf D.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 693-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). The biological half-life of a regulator of cholesterol turnover would be expected to be short. The relatively slow rate of elimination of 24S-hydroxycholesterol demonstrated here does not support the contention that 24S-hydroxycholesterol is an important regulator of cholesterol homeostasis in humans, at least not for short-term regulation. However, at the present state of knowledge the possibility can not be excluded that the rates of conjugation might be of some importance in keeping the intracellular concentration of the free sterol at a regulatory level. A new mechanism was described for the elimination of cholesterol from the brain involving conversion of cholesterol into 24S-hydroxycholesterol and a flux of this oxysterol over the blood-brain barrier into the circulation (1Lütjohann D.

The enzyme involved in this conversion has been identified recently as a cytochrome P-450 species denoted CYP46 (4Lund E.G. Guileyardo J.M. Russell D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7238-7243Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). This enzyme is almost exclusively located in the brain (4Lund E.G. Guileyardo J.M. Russell D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7238-7243Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), and evidence has been presented that more than 90% of the 24S-hydroxycholesterol in the human circulation originates from this organ (3Björkhem I.

Lütjohann D. von Bergmann K. Wennmalm Å. Diczfalusy U. Björkhem I. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 70-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Measurements of arteriovenous concentration differences across the brain and liver have shown that the liver eliminates an amount of 24-hydroxycholesterol similar to that produced by the brain (3Björkhem I. Lütjohann D. Diczfalusy U. Ståhle L. Ahlborg G. Wahren J. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1594-1600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In view of the fact that a hydroxyl group is introduced in the 24 position during the normal transformation of cholesterol into bile acids (6Björkhem I. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 455-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a conversion of 24S-hydroxycholesterol into bile acids would be expected. In the major pathway for biosynthesis of bile acids, the first and rate-limiting step is the introduction of a hydroxyl group in the 7α position by the cytochrome P-450 enzyme CYP7A. When human CYP7A was expressed in Escherichia coli and in simian COS cells, there was a significant activity toward 24-hydroxycholesterol (7Norlin M. Toll A. Björkhem I. Wikvall K. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1629-1639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is an alternative pathway for the conversion of cholesterol into bile acids in humans, starting with the oxidation of the steroid side chain followed by a 7α-hydroxylation catalyzed by the oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7B) (8Rose K.A. Stapleton G. Dott K. Kieny M.P. Best R. Schwarz M. Russell D.W. Björkhem I. Seckl J. Lathé R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4925-4930Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Surprisingly this enzyme has no significant activity toward 24S-hydroxycholesterol (7Norlin M. Toll A. Björkhem I. Wikvall K. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1629-1639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Zhang J. Akwa Y. El-Etr M. Baulieu E.-E. Sjövall J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Very recently, a new species of cytochrome P-450 denoted CYP39 was identified and found to have a high 7α-hydroxylase activity toward 24S-hydroxycholesterol (10Li-Hawkins J. Lund E.G. Bronson A.D. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16543-16549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Because both CYP7A and CYP39 are present in human liver and because both are able to 7α-hydroxylate 24-hydroxycholesterol, one would expect an efficient conversion of 24-hydroxycholesterol into bile acids. In a recent pilot study, we incubated a racemic mixture of tritium-labeled 24R- and 24S-hydroxycholesterol with human primary hepatocytes. The conversion of this racemic mixture into the primary bile acids cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid was less than 10% of that of 7α-hydroxycholesterol. However, because only the 24S isomer occurs naturally and one isomer may inhibit the metabolism of the other, no firm conclusions could be drawn, from that study. To our knowledge, there is only one previous report concerned with the metabolism of 24-hydroxycholesterol in the mammalian liver (11Saucier S.F. Kandutsch A.A. Clark D.S. Spencer T.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1166: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In that report tritium-labeled 24R- and 24S-hydroxycholesterol were administered to mice. Because the tritium was located in positions 3 and 24 and would be expected to be lost in a conversion of the oxysterol into bile acids, no conclusion could be drawn regarding a possible metabolism into bile acids. More polar metabolites were formed from the two oxysterols, but their identities were never established. In the present work we have prepared 24R and 24S isomers of tritium-labeled 24-hydroxycholesterol and incubated them separately with human primary hepatocytes. In addition we have injected tritium-labeled 24S-hydroxycholesterol together with14C-labeled 7α-hydroxycholesterol in two human volunteers and studied the relative conversion of the two oxysterols into bile acids. Furthermore, we have identified and quantitated conjugates and a major hydroxylated metabolite of 24S-hydroxycholesterol in ileocecal contents from patients with ileocecal fistulae. The results show that 24S-hydroxycholesterol is less efficient than 7α-hydroxycholesterol as a precursor to bile acids in humans and that a considerable part is excreted as conjugates in bile with or without an additional hydroxyl group. DISCUSSIONThere are several mechanisms by which the liver may eliminate 24S-hydroxycholesterol. The oxysterol may be excreted as such or in conjugated form. Another possibility is that the steroid may be hydroxylated and then excreted as such or as a conjugate. Finally the oxysterol may be converted into cholic or chenodeoxycholic acid before excretion in bile. According to the present investigation all these mechanisms are operating in humans.The rate of conversion of 24S-hydroxycholesterol into bile acids was found to be ∼40% of that of 7α-hydroxycholesterol in most of the experiments with human hepatocytes and ∼50% of that of 7α-hydroxycholesterol in the in vivo experiment with the two volunteers. In the experiments with human hepatocytes, the major bile acids formed were cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid in proportions almost identical to those obtained in experiments with labeled 7α-hydroxycholesterol. The rate of conversion of 24R-hydroxycholesterol, an isomer not normally present in human tissues, was similar to that of 24S-hydroxycholesterol, with a similar pattern of products.Interestingly, 27-hydroxylated 24S-hydroxycholesterol (5-cholestene-3β,24S,27-triol) was found to be a quantitatively important metabolite in the experiments with the hepatocytes. This triol may be formed by the action of sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27) on 24S-hydroxycholesterol, and it was confirmed here that 24-hydroxycholesterol is a substrate for human CYP27. The rate of 27-hydroxylation of 24-hydroxycholesterol by reconstituted CYP27, however, was relatively low: lower than the rate of 27-hydroxylation of cholesterol by the same enzyme. The possibility can thus not be completely excluded that an enzyme other than CYP27 may be involved in the conversion. Another possibility is that it is a conjugate of 24S-hydroxycholesterol rather than the free steroid that is a substrate for CYP27 under in vivo conditions. In any case, it is evident that a substantial portion of 24S-hydroxycholesterol is converted into 5-cholestene-3β,24,27-triol as a first step, possibly as a consequence of a relatively inefficient 7α-hydroxylation. In contrast to 25-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol, both of which are 7α-hydroxylated efficiently by astrocytes and Schwann cells, 24-hydroxycholesterol is not 7α-hydroxylated by these cells (9Zhang J. Akwa Y. El-Etr M. Baulieu E.-E. Sjövall J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that 24S-hydroxycholesterol is not a substrate for the oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7B) (7Norlin M. Toll A. Björkhem I. Wikvall K. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1629-1639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this is probably the case also with 5-cholestene-3β,24S,27-triol. This may increase the biological half-life of the latter triol and may explain its relatively high excretion in ileocecal fluid. The extent to which 5-cholestene-3β,24S,27-triol is a natural intermediate in the conversion of 24S-hydroxycholesterol into bile acids cannot be evaluated from the present work.The results of the above experiments are consistent with a relatively inefficient conversion of 24S-hydroxycholesterol into bile acids and show that glucuronidation, sulfation, and 27-hydroxylation of the steroid side chain are important metabolic steps in the elimination of the steroid. This is in agreement with our previous finding of the sulfated and glucuronidated form of 24S-hydroxycholesterol as a major oxysterol in the plasma of infants with severe intrahepatic cholestasis (19Meng L.J. Griffith W.J. Nazer H. Yang Y. Sjövall J. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 926-934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Doubly conjugated cholestanetriols were also present in these samples. It is difficult, however, to quantitate the relative importance of the different metabolic events with use of these experimental models. Quantitative data could be obtained from the patients with an ileostomy, in which all steroid metabolites excreted in bile should be present in the ileocecal content. It was shown clearly that the amount of 24S-hydroxycholesterol excreted as free, sulfated, and/or glucuronidated steroid with or without an additional hydroxyl group in the 27-position was ∼3.5 mg/24 h. Because we have shown that the daily production of 24S-hydroxycholesterol in humans is 6–7 mg (3Björkhem I. Lütjohann D. Diczfalusy U. Ståhle L. Ahlborg G. Wahren J. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1594-1600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it can be concluded that the normal conversion of 24S-hydroxycholesterol into of bile acids is about 3 mg/24 h.Approximately 10% of the 24S-hydroxycholesterol present in circulation and brain has been reported to be sulfated (1Lütjohann D. Breuer O. Ahlborg G. Nennesmo I. Sidén Å. Diczfalusy U. Björkhem I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9799-9804Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 23Prasad V.V. Ponticorvo L. Liebermann S. J. Steroid Biochem. 1984; 21: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and sulfated 24S-hydroxycholesterol has also been reported to be present in human feces (24Gustafsson J.-Å. Sjövall J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 8: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The present study shows that glucuronidation is a most important reaction in the metabolism of 24S-hydroxycholesterol in humans without liver disease. Thus, the formation of the double conjugate is not limited to patients with severe cholestatic conditions (19Meng L.J. Griffith W.J. Nazer H. Yang Y. Sjövall J. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 926-934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The sites of conjugation have not been determined and neither has the order in which conjugation occurs. However, it is reasonable to assume that the double conjugate is a 3-sulfate,24-glucuronide, as was found to be the case in cholestatic infants (19Meng L.J. Griffith W.J. Nazer H. Yang Y. Sjövall J. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 926-934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The relatively slow hepatic metabolism of 24S-hydroxycholesterol may explain the relatively high concentration of this oxysterol in the circulation. We have shown previously that the half-life of deuterium-labeled racemic 24-hydroxycholesterol is 10–14 h, whereas the corresponding half-life of 7α-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol is less than 1 h (3Björkhem I.

Lütjohann D. von Bergmann K. Wennmalm Å. Diczfalusy U. Björkhem I. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 70-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the low production of 24S-hydroxycholesterol, its plasma concentration is higher than that of any other oxysterol in infants and only slightly lower than that of 27-hydroxycholesterol in adults (12Dzeletovic S. Breuer O. Lund E. Diczfalusy U. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 225: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar).Based on its inhibitory action on hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase in isolated cells and the concentration of this oxysterol in mouse liver, 24S-hydroxycholesterol has been suggested to be an important physiological regulator of cholesterol homeostasis (25Saucier S.E. Kandutsch A.A. Gayen A.K. Swahn D.K. Spencer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6863-6869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this connection it is of interest that 24S-hydroxycholesterol has a relatively high affinity to the nuclear receptor LXRα (26Janowski B.A. Willy P.J. Devi T.R. Falck J.R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar), which is known to mediate cholesterol-induced effects on cholesterol degradation (27Peet D.J. Turley S.D. Ma W. Janowski B.A. Lobaccaro J.-M.A. Hammer R.E. Mangelsdorf D.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 693-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). The biological half-life of a regulator of cholesterol turnover would be expected to be short. The relatively slow rate of elimination of 24S-hydroxycholesterol demonstrated here does not support the contention that 24S-hydroxycholesterol is an important regulator of cholesterol homeostasis in humans, at least not for short-term regulation. However, at the present state of knowledge the possibility can not be excluded that the rates of conjugation might be of some importance in keeping the intracellular concentration of the free sterol at a regulatory level. There are several mechanisms by which the liver may eliminate 24S-hydroxycholesterol. The oxysterol may be excreted as such or in conjugated form.

In addition, we showed that nitric oxide inhibits purified ornithine decarboxylase by S-nitrosylation.

Despite the fact that polyamines are present in all mammalian cells, extensive research efforts have failed to fully elucidate their physiological functions. That polyamines are required, however, to maintain cell growth and function is clearly established (1Williams-Asman H.G. Canellakis Z.N. Perspect. Biol.

Many early studies indicate that polyamine synthesis is enhanced during growth and that growth-promoting stimuli lead to increases in polyamine biosynthesis. Direct evidence for this has been provided by experiments in which polyamine synthesis was prevented in mammalian cells in culture by mutations to key enzymes (such as ODC) or by the application of enzyme inhibitors (2Pegg A.E.

Increases in nitric-oxide synthase activity and addition of exogenous NO have been widely recognized to result in inhibition of cell proliferation (11Blachier F. Robert V. Selamnia M. Mayeur C.

In many of these studies, cyclic GMP did not account for the cytostatic effect of NO, and the evidence for cyclic GMP-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation is at best inconsistent and indirect. We have consistently observed cyclic GMP-independent cytostatic effects of NO in a variety of mammalian cell types including Caco-2 human tumor cells, murine macrophages, and rat aortic endothelial and smooth muscle cells (15Buga G.M. Wei L.H. Bauer P.M. Fukuto J.M. Ignarro L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: R1256-R1264PubMed Google Scholar,16Ignarro L.J. Buga G.M. Wei L.H. Bauer P.M. Wu G. del Soldato P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

One such mechanism appears to be the inhibition of ODC by NO. In our studies, the cytostatic effect of NO on tumor cells or rat aortic smooth muscle cells was reversed by the addition of exogenous polyamines but not by ornithine, suggesting that NO inhibited ODC. ODC is a homodimer and forms two active sites at the interface between the two monomers. It contains 2 cysteine residues (Cys-70 and Cys-360) in each active site (19Kern A.D. Oliveira M.A. Coffino P. Hackert M.L. Structure. 1999; 7: 567-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and a total of 12 cysteine residues/monomer. Cys-360 is required for enzymatic activity because mutating Cys-360 to alanine reduces enzyme activity by 98% (20Coleman C.S. Stanley B.A. Pegg A.E. J. Biol.

Nitrogen oxide species have been shown to readily react with both protein and low molecular weight thiols to formS-nitrosothiols (22Stamler J.S. Jaraki O. Osborne J.A. Simon D.I. Keany J. Vita J.

An increasing number of proteins such as albumin, p21ras, caspase 3, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, hemoglobin, and NFκ-B as well as the low molecular weight thiols, cysteine and glutathione, have been found to be S-nitrosylated in vivo (22Stamler J.S.

In addition, many proteins, including ODC, have been shown to be S-nitrosylated in vitro (29Bauer P.M. Buga G.M. Fukuto J.M. Pegg A.E. Ignarro L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The objective of this study was 3-fold: 1) to provide further evidence for the S-nitrosylation of ODC and the chemical mechanism by which it is S-nitrosylated, 2) to determine whether Cys-360, the critical cysteine residue in the active site of ODC, isS-nitrosylated, and 3) to determine whether ODC isS-nitrosylated in intact cells. Unless otherwise noted all chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma.l-[1-14C]Ornithine was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Ecolite scintillation mixture was purchased from ICN, Costa Mesa, CA. S-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) (30Hart T.W.

Soc. 1960; 82: 96-98Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar) were synthesized as described previously. 1-Diethyl-2-hydroxy-2-nitroso-hydrazine (DEA/NO) was a kind gift from David A. Wink, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. Saturated NO solutions were prepared by bubbling pure NO gas through water under anaerobic conditions. pHIS-ODC was prepared as described previously (29Bauer P.M. Buga G.M. Fukuto J.M. Pegg A.E. Ignarro L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid codes for an ODC protein with the following amino terminus: MRGSHHHHHHGS. For the pHIS-ODC C360A mutant, cysteine 360 was mutated to alanine in pGEM-ODC using the Chameleon mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The pGEM construct was then digested with SphI andSalI, and the fragment containing the mutation was isolated and inserted into pHIS-ODC. pCMVZeo-ODC was prepared as described previously (32Shantz L.M. Coleman C.S. Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5136-5140PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid codes for ODC truncated at amino acid residue 425. The truncated protein maintains activity comparable with wild type ODC but is no longer degraded by the proteasome. pHIS-ODC or pHIS-ODC C360A was expressed and purified from XL1-Blue Escherichia coli (Stratagene) as described previously (33Pegg A.E. Williams-Ashman H.G. Morris D.R. Marton L.J. Polyamines in Biological Medicine. Marcel Dekker, New York1981: 3-42Google Scholar). ODC activity was determined by monitoring the formation of [14C]CO2 froml-[1-14C]ornithine (29Bauer P.M. Buga G.M. Fukuto J.M. Pegg A.E. Ignarro L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Dithiothreitol (DTT) was separated from the enzyme by gel filtration through a Sephadex G-25 column in all experiments. For anaerobic experiments all solutions were deoxygenated either by bubbling argon through the solution or by purging the headspace with argon for at least 20 min. All anaerobic experiments were performed in a glove bag (I2R, Cheltenham, PA) under positive pressure argon. Samples were injected directly into a photolysis chamber that consists of borosilicate glass capillary tubing coiled around a 200-watt high-pressure mercury vapor lamp (Hanovia, Newark, NJ). A carrier stream of nitrogen carries the effluent through the photolysis chamber where the photolabile S–NO bond is broken resulting in the formation of NO and thiyl radical (S⋅). NO, in the gas phase, is then carried through a cold trap (−75 °C) and swept into the chemiluminescence detector. Chemiluminescence was performed as described previously (15Buga G.M. Wei L.H. Bauer P.M. Fukuto J.M. Ignarro L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: R1256-R1264PubMed Google Scholar). Authentic GSNO was used to make a standard curve, and the concentration of the GSNO stock solution was confirmed by spectrophotometry. NO release from GSNO was not detectable when the light source was off. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford Coomassie Brilliant Blue method (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Purified ODC or C360A ODC was gel filtered on a Sephadex G-25 column preequilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mmdiethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, pH 7.5 (assay buffer) to remove DTT. The buffer was then exchanged twice using Microcon centrifugal filter devices (Amicon) with a 30,000-kDa cut-off to further remove DTT and concentrate the protein. ODC, C360A ODC, or bovine serum albumin was incubated for 15 min at room temperature with 1 mmsodium cyanoborohydride, a mild reducing agent, to assure that thiols were in the reduced state. The samples were then incubated 1:1 (v/v) with a saturated NO solution (∼2 mm NO as determined by spectrophotometry) in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. Excess NO was removed from the solution by purging the headspace with argon for at least 20 min and then analyzed by photolysis-chemiluminescence. NIH 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-Hepes supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cell cultures were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air and were subcultured by trypsinization. 5 × 105 cells were seeded in 10-cm plates and transfected the next day with 10 μg of pCMVZeo-ODC or pCMVZeo using SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the methods of the manufacturer. The cells were then allowed to grow for another 48 h before use. Cell lysates from untransfected, pCMVZeo-transfected, or pCMVZeo-ODC-transfected NIH 3T3 cells were prepared using ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin. 20 μg of total protein from each sample were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide (10%) gel electrophoresis, and proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was then probed with rabbit anti-ODC antiserum (0.5 μg/ml) followed by goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000 dilution) (Cell Signaling Technologies, Beverly, MA). Blots were then visualized using LumiGlo chemiluminescent detection reagent (Cell Signaling Technology) as described by the manufacturer. Cell lysates from 1–2 × 108 pCMVZeo-transfected or pCMVZeo-ODC-transfected NIH 3T3 cells were prepared as described above. The lysates were aliquoted into five tubes so that immunoprecipitations were carried out on lysates from 2–4 × 107 cells. Immunoprecipitations were performed using control rabbit IgG or rabbit anti-ODC antiserum and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Before dissociation of the immunocomplexes, the original five aliquots of each sample were again pooled. The antigen-antibody complexes were then dissociated from the beads with 500 μl of 100 mm glycine buffer (pH 2.5). The protein G-Sepharose beads were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was kept on ice prior to analysis. We previously reported that NO donor agents inhibit purified ODC viaS-nitrosylation (29Bauer P.M. Buga G.M. Fukuto J.M. Pegg A.E. Ignarro L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We show here that the NO donor agents GSNO and DEA/NO inhibited purified ODC in a concentration-dependent manner under aerobic conditions (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the inhibition of ODC by both NO donor agents was reversible by the addition of 2.5 mm DTT and to a lesser extent by 5 mm GSH, providing evidence that NO acts to inhibit the enzyme byS-nitrosylation (Fig. 1). GSNO was more potent than DEA/NO as an inhibitor of ODC despite the fact that GSNO does not readily release NO. DEA/NO, on the other hand, has a half-life of NO release of ∼2 min. This led us to investigate the mechanism of S-nitrosylation by the two NO donor agents. We set forth the hypothesis that GSNO acts by participating in anS-transnitrosation reaction with cysteine residue(s) on ODC, whereas DEA/NO likely acts through the reaction of NO with O2 to form N2O3 and N2O4, both of which are nitrosating agents (Fig. 2). We first tested the capacity of GSNO and DEA/NO to inhibit ODC under anaerobic conditions. According to our hypothesis, GSNO should inhibit ODC under anaerobic conditions, whereas DEA/NO should not because the formation of N2O3 or N2O4 from NO is oxygen-dependent. As predicted, GSNO was equipotent under aerobic and anaerobic conditions (Fig. 3). The inhibition of ODC caused by GSNO under anaerobic conditions was, like under aerobic conditions, reversible by DTT and GSH (Fig. 4). This suggests that GSNO acts by the same mechanism under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.Figure 4The inhibition of purified ODC by GSNO under anaerobic conditions is reversible by thiols. Experiments were conducted either under positive pressure argon (anaerobic) or in room air (aerobic). DTT was separated from the enzyme by gel filtration through a Sephadex G-25 column in all experiments. ODC was preincubated with 10 μm GSNO at 37 °C for 15 min and then assayed in the presence or absence of 2.5 mm DTT or 5 mm GSH as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data represent the mean ± S.E. of duplicate determinations from four separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) DEA/NO failed to significantly inhibit ODC under anaerobic conditions at all concentrations tested (Fig. 5), demonstrating that NO released from DEA/NO must react with oxygen to inhibit ODC. This result lends credence to the hypothesis that DEA/NO acts through the reaction of NO and O2. To provide further evidence for this we took advantage of the reaction between NO and the NO scavenger 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-imidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide (PTIO) (35Maeda H. Akaike T. Yoshida M. Suga M. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1994; 56: 588-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). PTIO acts to scavenge NO by oxidizing it to NO2 (Fig. 2). However, NO2, as shown in Fig. 2, can react with another molecule of NO or dimerize to form the nitrosating agents N2O3 or N2O4, respectively. Under anaerobic conditions, 100 μm DEA/NO in the presence of 30 μm PTIO inhibited ODC by ∼80%, whereas DEA/NO or PTIO alone had no effect (Fig. 6). The inhibition of ODC by the combination of DEA/NO and PTIO was reversible by the addition of DTT or GSH, again suggesting that ODC was S-nitrosylated (Fig.7).Figure 6The effects of PTIO and DEA/NO on purified ODC under anaerobic conditions. Experiments were conducted under positive pressure argon. DTT was separated from the enzyme by gel filtration through a Sephadex G-25 column in all experiments. ODC was preincubated with or without 100 μm DEA/NO and/or 30 μm PTIO at 37 °C for 15 min and then assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data represent the mean ± S.E. of duplicate determinations from three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 7The inhibition of ODC by PTIO and DEA/NO under anaerobic conditions is reversible by thiols.

Jaraki O. Osborne J.A. Simon D.I. Keany J. Vita J. Singel D.J. Valeri C.R. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7674-7677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). We, therefore, developed our own apparatus to use photolysis-chemiluminescence to study theS-nitrosylation of ODC by NO. The present method was somewhat less sensitive than that previously described by Stamleret al. (22Stamler J.S. Jaraki O. Osborne J.A. Simon D.I. Keany J. Vita J. Singel D.J. Valeri C.R. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7674-7677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar, 36Stamler J.S. Simon D.I. Osborne J.A. Mullins M.E. Jaraki O. Michel T. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). This was not a limitation because we were able to repeat Stamler's earlier work showing that albumin, when in its native state, is S-nitrosylated on a single cysteine residue. 250 μl of a 100 μg/ml solution of albumin was mixed 1:1 (v/v) with a saturated NO solution and incubated for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. Excess NO was removed from the solution by purging the headspace with argon for 20 min. The sample was then analyzed by photolysis-chemiluminescence. A standard curve was prepared using authentic GSNO (Fig. 8 A). The concentration of GSNO stock solution was verified by spectrophotometry. In agreement with Stamler, albumin was determined to contain 0.91 ± 0.14 mol of SNO/mol of protein (Fig. 8 B). The same procedure using purified ODC and treatment of ODC with NO resulted in the S-nitrosylation of 3.89 ± 0.23 thiol residues/ODC monomer (Fig. 8 B), strengthening the hypothesis that NOS-nitrosylates ODC. As a means of determining if Cys-360 is one of the 4 residues in ODCS-nitrosylated by NO, C360A ODC in which Cys-360 is mutated to alanine was analyzed as above. C360A ODC was determined to contain 2.81 ± 0.17 SNO molecules/ODC monomer (Fig. 8 B). This is 1 less SNO molecule/monomer than wild type ODC and was significantly different as determined by the Student's t test (p < 0.01). Our final objective was to determine whether S-nitrosylated ODC could be isolated from cells that had been treated with NO. ODC was overexpressed in NIH 3T3 cells by transfection with pCMVZeo-ODC. This plasmid codes for an ODC protein that is truncated at the carboxyl terminus at amino acid residue 425. Because the carboxyl terminus is required for ODC to be degraded by the proteasome, the truncated form of the protein is stable and can accumulate to very high levels within the cell. pCMVZeo-ODC-transfected cells showed a marked increase in ODC protein as determined by Western blot analysis (Fig.9 A) and an approximate 200-fold increase in ODC activity (Fig. 9 B) when cell lysates from untransfected or pCMVZeo-transfected cells were compared with pCMVZeo-ODC-transfected cells. Control cells or cells overexpressing ODC were then treated with 1 mm CysNO and incubated for 30 min. The cells were harvested, lysed, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with control rabbit IgG or rabbit anti-ODC polyclonal antibody and protein G-Sepharose as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The immunocomplexes were then eluted from the protein G-Sepharose, and the eluate was analyzed by photolysis-chemiluminescence.S-Nitrosylated protein was not detected in pCMVZeo-transfected cells immunoprecipitated with the anti-ODC antibody or pCMVZeo-ODC-transfected cells immunoprecipitated with normal rabbit IgG (Fig. 10). This suggests that in both cases there was either no S-nitrosylated ODC or that it was below the detectable limit. In pCMVZeo-ODC-transfected cells immunoprecipitated with anti-ODC antibody, 36.8 ± 4.5 pmol ofS-nitrosylated protein/mg of total cell protein was detected (Fig. 10). In addition, there was no detectableS-nitrosylated ODC in immunoprecipitates from pCMVZeo-ODC-transfected cells that were not treated with CysNO (data not shown). When ODC is inactivated by the enzyme-activated, irreversible inhibitor α-difluoromethylornithine, a stoichiometric amount of a covalent adduct is formed with the protein with the major site for this reaction being Cys-360 (37Poulin R. Lu L. Ackermann B. Bey P. Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 150-158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that Cys-360 must be located in the active site of ODC, which was recently confirmed by x-ray crystallography (19Kern A.D. Oliveira M.A. Coffino P. Hackert M.L. Structure. 1999; 7: 567-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The importance of this residue has been established by mutation of this cysteine to serine or alanine (20Coleman C.S. Stanley B.A. Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24572-24579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is ample evidence that NO inhibits ODC. The initial evidence supporting this came from a study in which sodium nitroprusside was shown to inhibit cell proliferation by inhibiting putrescine synthesis (11Blachier F. Robert V. Selamnia M. Mayeur C. Duee P.H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Further evidence of this has been provided by studies in our laboratory in which inhibition of Caco-2 cell proliferation or vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation by NO was shown to be reversible by the addition of excess putrescine, spermidine, or spermine but not ornithine (15Buga G.M. Wei L.H. Bauer P.M. Fukuto J.M. Ignarro L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: R1256-R1264PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ignarro L.J. Buga G.M. Wei L.H. Bauer P.M. Wu G. del Soldato P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4202-4208Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). It was also shown that NO could inhibit ODC in crude cell lysates of Caco-2 cells or vascular smooth muscle cells. Similar studies have since been published showing inhibition of ODC in crude cell lysates by NO donor agents (17Satriano J. Ishizuka S. Archer D.C. Blantz R.C. Kelly C.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C892-C899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Blachier F. Briand D. Selamnia M. Robert V. Guihot G. Mayeur C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 1235-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that NO donor agents inhibit purified ODC byS-nitrosylation (17Satriano J. Ishizuka S. Archer D.C. Blantz R.C. Kelly C.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C892-C899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study, NO, in the form of GSNO or DEA/NO, inhibited ODC in a concentration-dependent manner. Inhibition of ODC by both NO donor agents was reversible by the addition of DTT or GSH, supporting the hypothesis that NO inhibits ODC viaS-nitrosylation of a critical cysteine residue(s) on ODC. The present data further support the hypothesis that NO and related species inhibit ODC by S-nitrosylation. Photolysis-chemiluminescence is an effective tool for determining not only whether a protein is S-nitrosylated but also for quantifying the number of residues modified byS-nitrosylation (22Stamler J.S. Jaraki O. Osborne J.A. Simon D.I. Keany J. Vita J. Singel D.J. Valeri C.R. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7674-7677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). It combines both specificity and sensitivity because SNOs are photolabile, and the chemiluminescence detectors used for detecting NO are both specific for NO and very sensitive. Exposure to ultraviolet light may result in the formation of NO also from nitrite, nitrosamines, and dinitrosyliron complexes and was controlled for in our experiments. Using this method we show that ∼4 cysteine residues/ODC monomer are S-nitrosylated when the enzyme is treated with a saturated NO solution. In addition, we provide evidence that Cys-360, which is critical for enzyme activity, is S-nitrosylated because the C360A ODC mutant isS-nitrosylated on only 3 cysteine residues. These findings led us to investigate whether S-nitrosylated ODC could be isolated from cells treated with NO. NIH 3T3 cells transfected with pCMVZeo-ODC and treated with 1 mm CysNO were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-ODC antibody. This resulted in the detection of 36.8 ± 4.5 pmol of SNO/mg of total cellular protein by photolysis-chemiluminescence.S-Nitrosylated protein was not detected in cells transfected with pCMVZeo and immunoprecipitated with anti-ODC antibody. pCMVZeo-ODC-transfected cells immunoprecipitated with normal rabbit IgG also resulted in no detection of S-nitrosylated protein, demonstrating that the positive result was not because of nonspecific protein interactions or conversion of nitrite, nitrosamines, or dinitrosyliron complexes to NO by exposure of the sample to UV light. These data demonstrate that ODC is S-nitrosylated in intact cells and suggest that the same may occur in vivo. Both S-nitrosothiol NO donor agents and the diazeniumdiolate NO donor agents inhibit purified ODC. TheS-nitrosothiol GSNO, however, is ∼6-fold more potent than the diazeniumdiolate DEA/NO. Not all classes of NO donor agents release NO by common mechanisms. GSNO releases NO only under specific conditions such as in the presence of transition metals or light. DEA/NO, on the other hand, spontaneously releases NO at pH 7.4 with a half-life of 2 min at 37 °C and releases 2 mol of NO/mol of DEA/NO. The mechanisms by which NO donor agents causeS-nitrosylation of ODC are dependent on the class of NO donor agent. The inhibition of ODC by DEA/NO was O2-dependent, suggesting that the NO released from DEA/NO is autoxidized to N2O3 or N2O4. This was substantiated by experiments in which ODC was incubated under anaerobic conditions in the presence or absence of PTIO. PTIO is an NO scavenger that acts by oxidizing NO to NO2, which is essentially equivalent to the reaction of NO with O2 to form NO2 (35Maeda H. Akaike T. Yoshida M. Suga M. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1994; 56: 588-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The reaction of NO with O2 is third order overall and second order with respect to NO, indicating that the rate of formation of NO2is dependent on the square of the NO concentration. Therefore, as the NO concentration decreases the reaction rate slows dramatically. Under physiological conditions where the NO concentration is very low (less than 100 nm), the reaction of NO with O2 is very slow, which allows for the diffusion of NO away from its source enabling NO to react with other biological targets. In fact, the suggestion has been made that the reaction between NO and O2 may not be relevant under physiological conditions. However, both NO and O2 are lipophilic molecules and tend to concentrate in biological membranes, perhaps facilitating this reaction. Indeed this reaction takes place ∼1500 times faster in micelles as compared with aqueous solution (39Liu X. Miller M.J.S. Joshi M.S. Thomas D.D. Lancaster J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2175-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Therefore, whereas this reaction may not take place in the cell cytosol, it may be important in biological membranes. The inhibition of ODC by GSNO on the other hand was independent of O2. Furthermore, the enzyme inhibition caused by GSNO was equipotent in the presence and absence of oxygen and was reversible by the addition of DTT or GSH under both conditions. These data suggest that GSNO acts by the same mechanism under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. Furthermore, these data rule out the possibility that GSNO simply acts through release of NO because NO by itself does not readily react with thiol residues. Besides being able to release NO under the appropriate conditions, S-nitrosothiols can react with thiols resulting in either the release of nitroxyl (HNO) or donation of nitrosonium (NO+) to another thiol viaS-transnitrosation. Generation of HNO and its subsequent attack on thiol residues would likely lead to the formation of anN-hydroxysulfenamide, sulfinamide, or sulfinic acid (40Wong P.S.-Y. Hyun J. Fukuto J.M. Shirota F.N. DeMaster E.G. Shoeman D.W. Nagasawa H.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5362-5371Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar).S-Transnitrosation reactions result in the transfer of an NO+ equivalent from one thiol to another resulting in the formation of a new S-nitrosothiol.S-Transnitrosation is considered to be the predominant mechanism for the biological actions of GSNO (41Park J.W. Billman G.E. Means G.E. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 30: 885-891PubMed Google Scholar), andS-transnitrosation has been demonstrated in vivobetween S-nitrosylated albumin and low molecular weight thiols (42Scharfstein J.S. Keaney Jr., J.F. Slivka A. Welch G.N. Vita J.A. Stamler J.S. Loscalzo J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1432-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). S-Transnitrosation reactions are relatively fast reactions and are O2-independent, which is consistent with the higher potency of GSNO as an inhibitor of ODC and explains why GSNO inhibits ODC under anaerobic conditions. Although the presence of low molecular weightS-nitrosothiols such as GSNO and CysNO has been demonstrated in extracellular environments such as plasma, most of the evidence for intracellular low molecular weight S-nitrosothiols is indirect. For example, Mayer et al. (43Mayer B. Pfeiffer S. Schrammel A. Koesling D. Schmidt K. Brunner F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3264-3270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) demonstrated that in rat isolated hearts a Cu+-specific chelator prevented bradykinin-induced cyclic GMP accumulation but did not affect cyclic GMP accumulation due to exogenous NO sources. Because Cu+is known to catalyze the release of NO from nitrosothiols, it was concluded that an S-nitrosothiol must be involved. However, Stamler et al. (44Liu L. Hausladen A. Zeng M. Que L. Heitman J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 490-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar) recently described the identification of an enzyme termed “GSNO reductase” that metabolizes GSNO, therefore regulating intracellular levels of GSNO. They demonstrate that deleting the reductase gene abolishes the GSNO-consuming activity of cells and increases intracellular levels of GSNO. The regulation of GSNO within the cell supports the idea that GSNO is an important intracellular molecule and provides evidence for the formation of GSNO intracellularly. Biologically speaking, however, the problem arises as to howS-transnitrosation reactions are targeted to specific thiols on proteins when intracellular GSH concentrations can be as high as 5–10 mm and the concentration of total cellular protein thiols is significantly higher than that. Specificity may come from the reactivity of the target thiol, which can vary by several orders of magnitude. For example thiolates, unprotonated thiols, are more reactive than the protonated form. In addition,S-transnitrosation reactions are reversible with the equilibrium favoring the more stable protein nitrosothiols over low molecular weight nitrosothiols (45Liu Z. Rudd M.A. Freedman J.E. Loscalzo J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 284: 526-534PubMed Google Scholar). Another theory, proposed by Stamler et al. (38Stamler J.S. Toone E.J. Lipton S.A. Sucher N.J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 691-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar), is that basic and acidic amino acids in the vicinity of the target thiol residue catalyzeS-transnitrosation reactions by acid-base catalysis, leading to enhanced reactivity of that cysteine residue. In fact, Stamleret al. (38Stamler J.S. Toone E.J. Lipton S.A. Sucher N.J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 691-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar) have proposed that (K/R/H)C(D/E) is a consensus motif for the S-nitrosylation of proteins byS-transnitrosation with the acidic amino acid following the cysteine residue being the most important. Although ODC does not have a basic amino acid immediately preceding Cys-360, it does have an aspartate residue immediately following Cys-360. The crystal structure of ODC further reveals that the active site contains several acidic and basic amino acids in the vicinity of Cys-360. We provide evidence herein of the S-nitrosylation of ODC on 4 cysteine residues including Cys-360, a critical thiol residue in the active site of ODC. In addition, we demonstrate the isolation ofS-nitrosylated ODC from cells overexpressing ODC, suggesting that ODC may be S-nitrosylated in vivo. We further reveal that low molecular weight S-nitrosothiols inhibit ODC with a greater potency than NO itself and by a different mechanism. The hypothesis is put forth that low molecular weightS-nitrosothiols may be physiological regulators of ODC activity and, therefore, cell proliferation. We recently demonstrated that NO inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation by inhibiting ODC. However, low molecular weightS-nitrosothiols and not NO may be the physiological regulator of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation because the former are found in vivo (41Park J.W. Billman G.E. Means G.E. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 30: 885-891PubMed Google Scholar) and are more potent inhibitors of ODC."

Activation of Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) by matrix attachment protects cells from anoikis. In this study, we establish a link between anoikis and Akt/PKB-mediated survival by demonstrating that Akt/PKB is cleaved by caspases in matrix-detached epithelial cells by a mechanism that involves death receptors. Reduced levels of Akt/PKB protein were observed in detached Madin-Darby canine kidney cells relative to cells attached to collagen. Equivalent levels of Akt/PKB, however, were detected in matrix-adherent and detached cells after inhibition of caspase activity or expression of an Akt/PKB mutant (D108+119A) that is resistant to caspase cleavage. The contribution of death domain-containing proteins to Akt/PKB cleavage was evidenced by the ability of dominant negative Fas-associated death domain to restore normal levels of Akt/PKB in matrix-detached cells. Importantly, expression of a cleavage-resistant Akt/PKB mutant protected matrix-detached cells from apoptosis.

Cell. 1993; 4: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar) cells undergo apoptosis when they are deprived of matrix attachment, a phenomenon that has been termed anoikis. Matrix receptors (integrins) activate key signaling molecules that inhibit this form of apoptosis. One of the most important signaling molecules in this respect is the Akt/PKB1 serine/threonine kinase (3Khwaja A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). The regulation of Akt/PKB kinase activity by integrins and growth factor receptors has been a focus of intense investigation because of its widespread importance in cell survival (4Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3714) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is essential for Akt/PKB activation because the D3 phosphoinositide products of PI3K bind to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Akt/PKB (5Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar, 6Frech M. Andjelkovic M. Ingley E. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol.

This interaction results in the recruitment of Akt/PKB to the cell membrane and an Akt/PKB conformational change, events that are required for its phosphorylation on threonine residue 308 by PI3K-dependent kinase 1 (7Alessi D.R.

After this phosphorylation event, Akt/PKB is phosphorylated at serine residue 473, resulting in the stimulation of its kinase activity toward exogenous substrates (10Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol.

Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2723) Google Scholar) has been suggested to contribute to its critical role in maintaining cell survival. Recent studies have implicated the TNF family of death receptors in anoikis (16Rytomaa M. Martins L.M. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1043-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 17Frisch S.M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1047-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). These transmembrane receptors contain one or more intracellular death domains, which mediate the recruitment and activation of initiator caspases (e.g. caspase 8) thatin turn stimulate the activity of executioner caspases (e.g. caspases 3 and 9). As implied by their name, the executioner caspases promote apoptosis by directing the cleavage of key substrates in cells. The finding that inhibitors of death receptors block anoikis indicates that these receptors regulate the activity of caspases, which in turn cleave key substrates in these cells to promote their apoptosis. In fact, several substrates of caspase activity have been identified in matrix-detached epithelial cells including β-catenin (18Steinhusen U. Badock V. Bauer A. Behrens J. Wittman-Liebold B. Dorken B. Bommert K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16345-16353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and MEKK (19Cardone M.H. Salvesen G.S. Widmann C. Johnson G. Frisch S.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). An important issue that arises from these findings is whether the caspase-mediated cleavage of such substrates is necessary for anoikis. For example, although β-catenin is a target of caspase activity during anoikis (18Steinhusen U. Badock V. Bauer A. Behrens J. Wittman-Liebold B. Dorken B. Bommert K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16345-16353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), the importance of this cleavage event in the induction of apoptosis has not been established. In addition, MEKK is activated in matrix-detached epithelial cells as a result of its cleavage by caspases (19Cardone M.H. Salvesen G.S. Widmann C. Johnson G. Frisch S.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). However, the expression of a cleavage-resistant MEKK in matrix-detached epithelial cells only partially inhibits their apoptosis, suggesting that other caspase targets are important for anoikis (19Cardone M.H. Salvesen G.S. Widmann C. Johnson G. Frisch S.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Given the importance of Akt/PKB in inhibiting apoptosis, we hypothesized that this kinase is a critical target of negative regulation by death receptor signaling during anoikis. The results obtained in this study demonstrate that death domain-containing proteins promote the caspase-dependent cleavage of Akt/PKB in matrix-detached epithelial cells. Importantly, our data suggest that Akt/PKB cleavage contributes to anoikis. MDCK cells were provided by Dr. Karl Matlin (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA) and maintained in low-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The following primary antibodies were used for immunoblots: (a) sheep antiserum specific for the PH domain of Akt/PKB (Upstate Biotechnology; 1:150 final dilution), (b) a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for FLAG (Sigma; 1:1000 final dilution), (c) mouse anti-HA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals; 1:1000 dilution), (d) rabbit anti-actin (Sigma; 1:1000 final dilution), and (e) rabbit anti-p85 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:1000 final dilution). Akt/PKB activity was assessed using a rabbit antiserum specific for Akt/PKB molecules phosphorylated on serine residue 473 (New England Biolabs). HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and mouse IgG (Sigma) were used at a blotting dilution of 1:15,000, whereas HRP-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (BIOSOURCE) was used at a final concentration of 1:25,000. MDCK cells were co-transfected using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) with a green fluorescent protein-expressing vector (pEGFP-1;CLONTECH; 1 μg) in addition to either a control vector (pcDNA; 1 μg) or the indicated Akt/PKB-expressing construct (1 μg). Akt/PKB constructs included FLAG-tagged vectors expressing wild type Akt/PKB, an Akt/PKB mutant containing an alanine substitution at aspartic acid residue 108, an Akt/PKB mutant containing an alanine substitution at aspartic acid residue 119, and an Akt/PKB double point mutant containing alanine substitutions at aspartic acid residues 108 and 119. The construction of these FLAG-tagged constructs has been described previously (20Rokudai S. Fujita N. Hashimoto Y. Tsuruo T. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To assess the importance of TNF receptor signaling in Akt/PKB proteolysis, MDCK cells were co-transfected using the LipofectAMINE reagent with pGFP (1 μg) and either a control vector (pEBB; 1 μg) or a plasmid expressing dominant negative FADD (1 μg), both of which were provided by Roya Khosravi-Far (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center). Wells of a 6-well tissue culture plate were incubated with either poly-HEME (1% solution in ethanol) or collagen (25 μg/ml in PBS) overnight. After washing extensively with PBS, the wells were blocked with serum-free media containing 1% bovine serum albumin. MDCK cells transfected with the indicated constructs were plated onto poly-HEME- or collagen-precoated wells at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/well in serum-free media containing 1% bovine serum albumin. For caspase inhibitor experiments, MDCK transfectants were pretreated for 30 min on ice with either Me2SO (1:500 dilution) or Z-DEVD-FMK (4 μg/ml; Calbiochem), a cell-permeable inhibitor of caspase 3 family members. These cells were then incubated on either poly-HEME or collagen as described above in the continual presence of the indicated caspase inhibitor. Nonadherent cells were collected from poly-HEME-coated wells, washed twice with PBS, and lysed in Akt/PKB lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.14m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). After removing nonadherent cells, collagen-attached cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed by adding 200 μl of Akt/PKB lysis buffer directly to the wells. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, and equivalent amounts of total cellular protein were subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE (8%). These proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with the indicated Akt/PKB- or FLAG-specific antibody. To confirm equal protein loading, these blots were stripped with stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 0.1 mβ-mercaptoethanol) and reprobed with actin or p85-specific antisera, followed by the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. The relative intensity of Akt/PKB, actin, and p85 bands was assessed by densitometry using IP Lab Spectrum software (Scanalytics). Adherent cells plated on collagen wells were washed with PBS and harvested with trypsin. Nonadherent cells were collected from poly-HEME-coated wells and washed with PBS. For annexin V stains, cells were washed sequentially with serum-containing medium, PBS, and annexin V buffer (10 mmHepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, and 2.5.mM CaCl2). These samples were then incubated at room temperature for 15 min with annexin V-FITC (BIOSOURCE) or annexin V-PE (PharMingen) at a final concentration of 2.5 μg/ml in annexin V buffer. After washing once with annexin V buffer, the cells were resuspended in 250 μl of annexin V buffer and analyzed by flow cytometry. For annexin V-FITC-stained samples, propidium iodide was added at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml immediately before analysis as a means of distinguishing between apoptotic and necrotic cells. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by assessing the percentage of cells that bound annexin V-FITC but were negative for PI uptake. In addition, the percentage of necrotic cells was assessed by determining the percentage of the total cell population that was positive for PI uptake. At least 5000 cells were analyzed for each sample. For annexin V-PE stains of GFP transfectants, GFP-positive cells were gated and analyzed for annexin V-PE positivity. Because of an observed overlap between FL1 and FL2 channels at high FL1 intensities, the brightest GFP-positive cells were excluded from analysis. A minimum of 2500 GFP-positive cells were analyzed for each sample. The percentage of anoikis was determined as the difference between the percentage of collagen and HEME-plated cells that were positive for annexin V-PE staining. Based on the finding that detachment of adherent cells from matrix stimulates their apoptosis (1Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2756) Google Scholar, 2Meredith J.E.J. Fazeli B. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar), we investigated the hypothesis that the matrix detachment of epithelial cells promotes apoptosis by inhibiting Akt/PKB. Initially, we established a time course for the detachment-induced apoptosis of MDCK cells. Cells were maintained in serum-free medium and either plated on collagen or deprived of matrix attachment by plating on poly-HEME. These cells were harvested at various times, and the level of apoptosis was determined by staining with annexin V-FITC and PI. As shown in Fig.1, MDCK cells that had been maintained in suspension for 30 min exhibited significantly higher annexin V staining than MDCK cells plated on collagen. These cells were in the early stages of apoptosis based on their ability to bind annexin V and exclude propidium iodide. After maintaining these cells for 2 h in suspension, we observed an increase in annexin V-positive, PI-negative cells, as well as a 3-fold increase in the percentage of cells stained by propidium iodide, confirming the ability of matrix detachment to induce cell death (Fig. 1). Subsequently, we investigated the effects of detachment-induced apoptosis on Akt/PKB expression. MDCK cells were transfected with a HA-tagged, full-length Akt/PKB construct and plated on either collagen or poly-HEME for 2 h. Equivalent amounts of total cellular protein obtained from these cells were then subjected to immunoblotting with a HA-specific antibody. As shown in Fig.2 A, total cellular levels of HA-tagged Akt/PKB were reduced by 70% in MDCK cells that had been detached from matrix relative to the levels observed in the same cells plated on collagen. Similarly, we observed a significant reduction in the level of endogenous Akt/PKB in matrix-detached MDCK cells (Fig.2 B). As evidence that the matrix detachment of these cells does not reduce total cellular protein levels, we detected similar levels of actin in MDCK cells, regardless of whether they were maintained in suspension or plated on collagen (Fig. 2 A). Furthermore, the level of the p85 subunit of PI3K, the enzyme responsible for Akt/PKB activation, was not reduced in matrix-detached MDCK cells relative to collagen-plated MDCK cells (Fig. 2 B). These data demonstrate that anoikis is coincident with a specific reduction in Akt/PKB protein levels. Based on recent reports that members of the TNF death receptor family mediate detachment-induced apoptosis (16Rytomaa M. Martins L.M. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1043-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 17Frisch S.M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1047-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether these receptors are also important in reducing Akt/PKB protein levels in matrix-deprived cells. MDCK cells were co-transfected with HA-tagged Akt/PKB and either a control plasmid or dominant negative FADD, an inhibitor of death domain-containing proteins (21Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2155) Google Scholar, 22Chinnaiyan A.M. Tepper C.G. Seldin M.F. O'Rourke K. Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4961-4965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). These transfectants were plated on either collagen or poly-HEME, and the amount of Akt/PKB in extracts obtained from these cells was assessed by immunoblotting with a HA-specific antibody. Similar to the results observed in Fig.2 A, Akt/PKB protein levels were reduced by 90% in control transfectants that had been plated on poly-HEME relative to those plated on collagen (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, Akt/PKB protein levels were not reduced in suspension relative to matrix-attached MDCK cells that expressed dominant negative FADD (Fig. 2 C). These results demonstrate that TNF death receptor signaling, which has been shown to be critical in detachment-induced apoptosis (16Rytomaa M. Martins L.M. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1043-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 17Frisch S.M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1047-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), is important in reducing the level of Akt/PKB in matrix-detached MDCK cells. Based on the results from previous studies establishing the importance of caspase activity in anoikis (23Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Kelaita D. Sicks S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1377-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the reduction in Akt/PKB protein levels observed in matrix-deprived MDCK cells was caspase-dependent. HA-Akt/PKB-transfected MDCK cells that had been pretreated with either Me2SO or an inhibitor of caspase 3 subfamily proteases (Z-DEVD-FMK) were plated on either collagen or poly-HEME for 2 h. Equivalent amounts of total cellular protein from extracts of these cells were then subjected to immunoblotting with a HA-specific antibody. In agreement with the results from Fig. 2 A, a 70% reduction in total Akt/PKB protein was observed in Me2SO-treated cells maintained in suspension relative to those plated on collagen (Fig.3). In contrast, equivalent amounts of Akt/PKB were detected in MDCK cells that had been pretreated with the caspase 3 subfamily inhibitor, regardless of whether they were maintained in suspension or attached to collagen (Fig. 3). These results suggest that the reduction in Akt/PKB protein levels observed in matrix-deprived MDCK cells is the result of Akt/PKB cleavage by caspases. We demonstrated previously that Akt/PKB can be cleavedin vitro by recombinant caspase 3 at aspartic acid residues 108 and 119, resulting in the generation of a 44-kDa PH-deficient fragment (Fig. 4 A) (20Rokudai S. Fujita N. Hashimoto Y. Tsuruo T. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To determine whether these sites are cleaved by caspases during the detachment-induced apoptosis of epithelial cells, MDCK cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged Akt/PKB mutants containing alanine substitutions at either aspartic acid residue 108 or 119 (D108A and D119A, respectively) or with a FLAG-tagged Akt/PKB double point mutant containing alanine substitutions at both aspartic acid residues 108 and 119 (D108+119A). As a control, MDCK cells were also transfected with FLAG-tagged wild-type Akt/PKB. These transfectants were plated on either collagen or poly-HEME for 2 h, and extracts from these cells were immunoblotted with a FLAG-specific antibody. As shown in Fig. 4 B, significantly reduced levels of both the D108A and D119A mutants were observed in matrix-detached MDCK transfectants relative to collagen-plated MDCK transfectants. In contrast, equivalent levels of the double mutant (D108+119A) Akt/PKB protein were detected in both poly-HEME- and collagen-plated cells (Fig. 4 B). As a loading control, we observed equivalent levels of the p85 subunit of PI3K in these transfectants, regardless of whether they were maintained in suspension or plated on matrix (Fig. 4 B). These results indicate that Akt/PKB is cleaved by caspases during detachment-induced apoptosis at aspartic acid residues 108 and 119. In addition, these data identify an Akt/PKB mutant (D108+119A) that is resistant to caspase cleavage. Collectively, our results support a pathway of detachment-induced apoptosis that consists of TNF death receptor-dependent caspase activation, followed by the caspase-dependent cleavage of Akt/PKB at aspartic acid residues 108 and 119. Our results demonstrate that during anoikis, Akt/PKB is cleaved at aspartic acid residues 108 and 119 by caspases. To assess the functional importance of Akt/PKB cleavage in anoikis, MDCK cells were co-transfected with a GFP construct and either wild-type Akt/PKB or the Akt/PKB double point mutant (D108+119A). Expression of these Akt/PKB constructs was confirmed by immunoblotting extracts from these cells with an antibody specific for the FLAG tag (Fig.5 A). These transfectants were plated on either poly-HEME or collagen for either 2 or 4 h, and the level of apoptosis in GFP-positive cells was quantified by annexin V-PE staining (Fig. 5 B). We observed that expression of the Akt/PKB double point mutant (D108+119A) inhibited detachment-induced apoptosis in these cells by ∼60% at both of these time points, whereas expression of wild-type Akt/PKB inhibited apoptosis by less than 20% (Fig. 5 B). Importantly, the Akt/PKB D108+119A mutant did not exhibit increased activity over wild-type Akt/PKB in transfected MDCK cells (Fig. 5 C), confirming that this mutant construct did not promote cell survival because of an intrinsic ability of these mutations to increase Akt/PKB activity. We also observed that neither the Akt/PKB D108A mutant nor the Akt/PKB D119A mutant promoted the survival of matrix-detached MDCK cells (data not shown), consistent with the observation that these mutants are efficiently cleaved by caspases in matrix-detached MDCK cells (Fig.4 B). Collectively, these results suggest that the proteolytic removal of the PH domain of Akt/PKB contributes to detachment-induced apoptosis. Although Akt/PKB is known to be essential in promoting cell survival, little attention has been given to the hypothesis that Akt/PKB is regulated negatively by apoptotic signaling pathways. Recent work by our groups foreshadowed this possibility by demonstrating that Akt/PKB is a substrate for caspase 3 (20Rokudai S. Fujita N. Hashimoto Y. Tsuruo T. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 24Bachelder R.E. Ribick M.J. Marchetti A. Falcioni R. Soddu S. Davis K.R. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1063-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In the current study, we demonstrate that the activation of TNF death receptors in response to the detachment of epithelial cells from matrix induces the caspase-mediated cleavage of Akt/PKB. Moreover, our data identify Akt/PKB cleavage as an important event in anoikis. Although previous studies established that the Akt/PKB pathway can inhibit the activity of proapoptotic molecules (11Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E.

Chem. 1999; 274: 16741-16746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), our studies identify a reciprocal form of regulation, namely, the effect of death receptor signaling on Akt/PKB. In addition to its role in anoikis, the regulation of Akt/PKB by death receptors likely has widespread implications for cell survival. The caspase-mediated proteolysis of Akt/PKB appears to contribute to anoikis because we observed a 60% inhibition of apoptosis in matrix-detached MDCK cells upon the expression of a caspase-resistant Akt/PKB construct. Importantly, the expression of wild-type Akt/PKB in MDCK cells inhibited anoikis only marginally, demonstrating that the restored survival of cells transfected with the caspase-resistant Akt/PKB mutant was not simply an artifact of Akt/PKB overexpression. Because we were unable to assess the ability of the caspase-resistant Akt/PKB mutant to inhibit anoikis at time points later than 4 h (see the figure legends), we cannot rule out the possibility that Akt/PKB cleavage delays anoikis. The ability of caspases to delay detachment-induced apoptosis by inducing the cleavage of Akt/PKB may contribute to a postcommitment amplification step in anoikis, similar to that which occurs upon the caspase-mediated cleavage of bcl-2 (25Cheng E.H. Kirsch D.G. Clem R.J. Ravi R. Kastan M.B. Bedi A. Ueno K. Hardwick J.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1966-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar,26Clem R.J. Cheng E.H. Karp C.L. Kirsch D.G. Ueno K. Takahashi A. Kastan M.B. Griffin D.E. Earnshaw W.C. Veliuona M.A. Hardwick J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 554-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, our findings suggest that the ability of apoptotic proteins to impact signaling molecules associated with cell survival is an important determinant of cell fate. Moreover, our data indicate that the serine/threonine kinase Akt/PKB is a relevant target of caspase activity in the induction of apoptosis. Our results indicate that caspases cleave Akt/PKB at aspartic acid residues 108 and 119 during anoikis. Specifically, we observed that an Akt/PKB double point mutant containing alanine substitutions at aspartic acid residues 108 and 119 is resistant to caspase cleavage during anoikis (Fig. 4 B). Both aspartic acid residues 108 and 119 are cleaved by caspases during anoikis, as indicated by the fact that the mutation of both sites, but not single mutations at either residue, conferred resistance to caspase cleavage in matrix-detached MDCK cells (Fig. 4 B). The caspase-mediated cleavage of Akt/PKB at these sites is expected to produce an Akt/PKB fragment of ∼44 kDa. In previous work, we identified a 44-kDa Akt/PKB cleavage product resulting from the incubation of recombinant caspase 3 with Akt/PKB in vitro (20Rokudai S. Fujita N. Hashimoto Y. Tsuruo T. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 24Bachelder R.E. Ribick M.J. Marchetti A. Falcioni R. Soddu S. Davis K.R. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1063-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In contrast, we were not able to detect an Akt/PKB fragment in matrix-detached MDCK cells either by immunoblotting extracts from these cells with Akt/PKB-specific antibodies or by silver staining (data not shown). Our inability to detect this fragment in vivo likely reflects the fact that Akt/PKB is cleaved by multiple proteases in vivo, resulting in the generation of fragments that are too small to be detected by routine methods. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that Akt/PKB can be cleaved at multiple sites in vitro by recombinant caspases 3, 6, and 7 (20Rokudai S. Fujita N. Hashimoto Y. Tsuruo T. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Although the activity of some caspase targets is enhanced by cleavage (19Cardone M.H. Salvesen G.S. Widmann C. Johnson G. Frisch S.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), other signaling molecules are inactivated after their caspase-dependent proteolysis (25Cheng E.H. Kirsch D.G. Clem R.J. Ravi R. Kastan M.B. Bedi A. Ueno K. Hardwick J.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1966-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar, 26Clem R.J. Cheng E.H. Karp C.L. Kirsch D.G. Ueno K.

The caspase-dependent cleavage of Akt/PKB at amino acids 108 and 119 generates two fragments of predicted molecular masses of 44 and 16 kDa, corresponding to a PH-deficient kinase domain and an isolated PH domain, respectively (Fig. 4 A). The importance of the PH domain of Akt/PKB in the stimulation of its serine/threonine kinase activity is controversial. Although an Akt/PKB deletion mutant lacking amino acids 1–117 exhibits reduced activity relative to wild-type Akt/PKB (27Andjelkovic M. Jakuboqica T. Cron P. Ming X.-F. Han J.-W. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5699-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), the deletion of amino acids 4–129 has been reported to enhance the activity of this kinase (28Kohn A.D. Kovacina K.S. Roth R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4288-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 29Kohn A.D. Takeuchi F. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21920-21926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Importantly, our previous results indicated that the PH-deficient Akt/PKB fragment resulting from its cleavage at amino acids 108 and 119 does not exhibit reduced activity relative to wild-type Akt/PKB (20Rokudai S. Fujita N. Hashimoto Y. Tsuruo T. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, the subsequent cleavage of Akt/PKB by other caspases, which likely occurs based on our inability to detect the predicted Akt/PKB fragmentsin vivo, may inhibit its kinase activity. The ability of death receptor signaling pathways to impact Akt/PKB has numerous implications for cell survival. It is possible that a critical level of Akt/PKB activity must be maintained for cell survival and that caspases induce anoikis by reducing Akt/PKB activity below this threshold. In addition, the caspase-mediated proteolysis of Akt/PKB may render cells resistant to secondary survival signals. In fact, the ability of caspases to induce the cleavage of Akt/PKB in matrix-detached cells may explain why the growth factor-mediated stimulation of Akt/PKB is significantly enhanced in matrix-attached cells relative to epithelial cells in suspension (3Khwaja A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar, 30Fujio Y. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16349-16354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). This ability of caspases to impact Akt/PKB signaling irreversibly explains why tumor cells, which must grow in matrix-deficient environments, must acquire mutations that prevent this death receptor-associated negative regulation of the Akt/PKB pathway. For example, oncogenic Ras inhibits the expression of the TNF death receptor family member Fas (31Fenton R.G. Hixon J.A. Wright P.W. Brooks A.D. Sayers T.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3391-3400PubMed Google Scholar, 32Peli J. Schroter M. Rudaz C. Hahne M. Meyer C. Reichmann E. Tschopp J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1824-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), a finding that may explain why Ras-transformed epithelial cells are resistant to anoikis (3Khwaja A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). It is also interesting to consider the possibility that the caspase-directed cleavage of Akt/PKB results in the generation of an Akt/PKB fragment that promotes apoptosis. In this manner, Akt/PKB would be converted by caspases from an antiapoptotic to a proapoptotic signaling molecule, similar to the caspase-generated cleavage products of bcl-2 (25Cheng E.H. Kirsch D.G. Clem R.J. Ravi R. Kastan M.B. Bedi A. Ueno K. Hardwick J.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1966-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar) and bcl-XL (26Clem R.J. Cheng E.H. Karp C.L.

In support of this model, the overexpression of an Akt/PKB fragment consisting of amino acid residues 1–147 has been previously shown to induce apoptosis in matrix-attached MDCK cells (3Khwaja A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). In addition to its central importance in the maintenance of cell survival, Akt/PKB is amplified in numerous tumors (33Staal S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although the Akt/PKB signaling pathway has been shown to protect cells from numerous apoptotic stimuli, our studies highlight the impact of apoptotic signaling molecules on Akt/PKB. Specifically, we show that in the absence of integrin signaling, Akt/PKB is cleaved by death receptor-dependent pathways. The identification of such signaling pathways that inhibit the activity of proteins necessary for cell survival will be important for the development of therapeutics that inhibit tumor growth.

The potential of vanadate to stimulate glucose transport independent of the early steps in insulin signaling prompted us to test its effectiveness in an in vitro model of insulin resistance. In primary rat adipocytes cultured for 18 h in the presence of high glucose (15 mm) and insulin (10−7m), sensitivity to insulin-stimulated glucose transport was decreased. In contrast, there was a paradoxical enhanced sensitivity to vanadate of the insulin-resistant cells (EC50 for control, 325 ± 7.5 μm; EC50 for insulin-resistant, 171 ± 32 μm; p < 0.002). Enhanced sensitivity was also present for vanadate stimulation of insulin receptor kinase activity and autophosphorylation and Akt/protein kinase B Ser-473 phosphorylation consistent with more effective PTP inhibition in the resistant cells. Investigation of this phenomenon revealed that 1) depletion of GSH with buthionine sulfoximine reproduced the enhanced sensitivity to vanadate while preincubation of resistant cells withN-acetylcysteine (NAC) prevented it, 2) intracellular GSH was decreased in resistant cells and normalized by NAC, 3) exposure to high glucose and insulin induced an increase in reactive oxygen species, which was prevented by NAC, 4) EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) spectroscopy showed a decreased amount of vanadyl (+4) in resistant and buthionine sulfoximine-treated cells, which correlated with decreased GSH and increased vanadate sensitivity, while total vanadium uptake was not altered, and 5) inhibition of recombinant PTP1Bin vitro was more sensitive to vanadate (+5) than vanadyl (+4). In conclusion, the parodoxical increased sensitivity to vanadate in hyperglycemia-induced insulin resistant adipocytes is due to oxidative stress and decreased reduction of vanadate (+5) to vanadyl (+4). Thus, sensitivity of PTP inhibition and glucose transport to vanadate is regulated by cellular redox state.

Recent studies in human diabetic subjects suggest that these vanadium compounds can lower glycemia and improve lipid levels (38Cohen N. Halberstam M. Shlimovich P. Chang C.J. Shamoon H. Rossetti L.

Cohen N. Shlimovich P. Rossetti L. Shamoon H. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which vanadate mimics insulin is not completely clear. Although protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) inhibition appears to be important, the role of the IR and/or other Tyr kinases remains controversial (41Green A. Biochem. J. 1986; 238: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 42D'Onofrio F. Le M.Q. Chiasson J.L. Srivastava A.K.

In some studies, IR kinase activation by vanadate has been documented (44Tamura S. Brown T.A. Whipple J.H. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. Dubler R.E. Cheng K. Larner J. J. Biol.

However, it has been found that insulin-mimetic effects can be stimulated independent of any IR activation (41Green A. Biochem. J. 1986; 238: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 42D'Onofrio F. Le M.Q. Chiasson J.L. Srivastava A.K.

Chem. 1993; 268: 6463-6469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and membrane-associated (49Ida M. Imai K. Hashimoto S. Kawashima H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 1061-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) low molecular weight tyrosine kinases have been linked with some of these metabolic effects. However, since these associations were based on inhibition by staurosporine, which inhibits a wide spectrum of kinases, their role remains unclear. In other studies, glucose transport stimulation by vanadate, in contrast to that stimulated by insulin, was found to be independent of the enzymes PI 3-kinase (49Ida M. Imai K. Hashimoto S. Kawashima H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 1061-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 50Tsiani E. Bogdanovic E. Sorisky A. Nagy L. Fantus I.G.

Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1676-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These data raised the possibility that vanadium compounds may have a unique ability to stimulate and/or enhance insulin metabolic effects in some states of insulin resistance. To determine the efficacy of vanadate to stimulate glucose transport in an insulin resistant target tissue, we examined its actions in the insulin-resistant rat adipocyte model induced by high glucose and insulin. We found that there was a paradoxical enhanced sensitivity of glucose uptake to vanadate in the insulin-resistant cells,i.e. a leftward shift in the vanadate dose-response curve. This was associated with a concomitant enhanced sensitivity of the insulin-resistant cells to vanadate-stimulated Tyr phosphorylation of the IR and of its intrinsic Tyr kinase activity as well as Ser-473 phosphorylation of the downstream kinase PKB. Investigation of the possible mechanism showed that there was a greater intracellular concentration of vanadate (+5) relative to vanadyl (+4) in the insulin-resistant adipocytes. In vitro studies showed that inhibition of PTP1B phosphatase activity was more sensitive to vanadate (+5) than vanadyl (+4). These data demonstrate that vanadate (+5) is a more potent PTP inhibitor than vanadyl (+4) and that there is decreased reduction of vanadate (+5) to vanadyl (+4) in the insulin-resistant adipocytes. They are also consistent with our observations of increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in adipocytes exposed to high glucose and insulin and of the influence of altered cellular levels of GSH (glutathione) on vanadate sensitivity Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were from Charles River (St. Constant, Quebec, Canada). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), penicillin, streptomycin, and fetal bovine serum were from Life Technologies, Inc. Type I collagenase was from Worthington Biochemical Corp. (Freehold, NJ). Human insulin was a gift from Eli Lilly (Indianapolis, IN). 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose (10 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). The GSH assay kit was from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Nitex nylon was from Thompson (Scarborough, ON). 5,6-Carboxy-22,72-dichlorofluorescein-diacetate (DCF-DA) was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Bovine serum albumin (fraction V), buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), sodium orthovanadate (vanadate), andN-acetylcysteine (NAC) were from Sigma. Vanadyl sulfate was from BD PharMingen (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Anti-Tyr(P) antibody (PY20) was from UBI (Lake Placid, NY) anti-PKB and anti-phosphoserine 473-PKB antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), and anti-IR antibody was a kind gift from Dr. C. Yip (University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) or from Santa Cruz. Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 180–200 g were gassed with O2/CO2, killed by cervical dislocation, and epididymal fat pads collected in 3% BSA-DMEM. Adipocytes were isolated as described (51Fantus I.G. Ahmad F. Deragon G. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 2716Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In brief, adipose tissue was incubated in 3% BSA-DMEM containing 2 mg/ml collagenase for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were then filtered through Nitex nylon (1000 μm), centrifuged at 500 rpm for 30 s, and washed twice with 3% and then 1% BSA-DMEM to remove collagenase. The isolated adipocytes were incubated in 1% BSA-DMEM (pH 7.4) supplemented with 0.5% fetal bovine serum and 25 mm HEPES, 1% antibiotics in 250-ml conical culture flasks at 37 °C with cells floating on top of the medium in a thin layer. Cells were incubated for 18 h in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and air. To induce insulin resistance, 10−7m insulin and 15 mmd-glucose (final concentrations) were added to the medium. Control cells contained no added insulin, and final glucose concentration was 5.6 mm. Cells treated with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) were incubated in control medium supplemented with 80 μm BSO. Preliminary experiments revealed that this concentration was nontoxic by visual assessment of adipocyte integrity, by trypan blue exclusion, as well as by maintenance of basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake similar to that in control cells. The NAC treatment of insulin-resistant adipocytes was carried out with a 2-h pre-exposure of cells to 30 mm NAC at 37 °C prior to the induction of insulin resistance for 18 h as described above. After the 18-h incubation, cells were washed twice in 3% BSA-KR30H, pH 7.0 (137 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mmKH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 30 mm HEPES, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 3% BSA), and then further incubated in the same buffer for an additional 30 min at 37 °C to remove any remaining receptor-bound insulin. Cells were then resuspended in 3% BSA-KRBH, pH 7.4 (118 mm NaC1, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mmKH2PO4, 5 mm NaHCO3, 30 mm HEPES, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 3% BSA) and washed twice in the same buffer before 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake assay. The 2-DG uptake assay was performed as described previously (52Olefsky J.M. Biochem. J. 1978; 172: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Adipocytes (5 × 105 cells/ml) were preincubated at 37 °C with vanadate concentrations from 0 to 2 mm for 60 min. Initial rates of glucose uptake were measured by adding 1 μCi of 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose and unlabeled 2-DG (final substrate concentration, 100 μm) to a final volume of 500 μl. At the end of 3 min, the reaction was terminated by adding 500 μl of ice-cold 0.25 mm phloretin. Nonspecific uptake mediated by simple diffusion and trapping was determined by measuring [3H]2-DG uptake in the presence of 0.25 mmphloretin and was subtracted from total uptake to yield specific uptake. In each experiment, glucose uptake was derived from the mean of duplicate determinations. After 18 h of incubation and washing as described above, adipocytes were incubated at 37 °C in KRBH in the presence of the indicated concentrations of vanadate for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by immediate freezing to −70 °C in liquid N2 followed by the addition of ice-cold solubilization buffer (1% Triton X-100, 4 mmEDTA, 2 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 trypsin inhibitor unit/ml of aprotinin, 1 mmvanadate, and 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.6). Adipocytes were homogenized and solubilized for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. After removal of the fat cake by centrifugation at 1800 ×g for 10 min, the cell extract was centrifuged further at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a 1 ml column of WGA-agarose and the IRs eluted with 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.6, containing 150 mmNaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.3 m N-acetyl-d-glucosamine. 125I-Insulin binding to the lectin purified extract was performed as described previously (53Kadota S. Fantus I.G. Deragon G. Guyda H.J. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8252-8256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments IRs were immunoprecipitated from the solubilized adipocyte extracts with anti-IR antibody. Equal amounts of IR from the WGA-purified fractions or immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. After electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose membranes the latter were washed and blocked with PBS, pH 7.4, containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 1 h at 22 °C. The immunoblotting with anti-Tyr(P) and anti-IR was performed as described previously (45Fantus I.G. Ahmad F. Deragon G. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) except that in some experiments the secondary antibodies were conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and detection was with ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A procedure similar to that reported previously was followed (45Fantus I.G. Ahmad F. Deragon G. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 53Kadota S. Fantus I.G. Deragon G. Guyda H.J. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8252-8256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lectin-purified IRs (10–20 fmol of insulin binding) were placed in a buffer at 22 °C containing 50 mm HEPES, 1 mmMnCl2, 15 mm MgSO4, 2.5 mg/ml poly(Glu-Tyr) (4:1), and 25 μm[γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi/tube, pH 7.6) in a total volume of 160 μl. After 10 min, the reaction was terminated by spotting 100 μl of the reaction mixture on filter paper, which was then placed in 10% trichloroacetic acid containing 10 mmsodium pyrophosphate. After extensive washing in this solution, the paper was dried and placed in 20 ml of Aquasol-II for determination of radioactivity. The extent of Ser-473 phosphorylation of PKB was determined as described previously (50Tsiani E. Bogdanovic E. Sorisky A. Nagy L. Fantus I.G. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1676-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Cell lysates (50 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10%) followed by electrotransfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). After blocking for 1 h at 22 °C in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk, the membranes were incubated overnight with a 1:1000 dilution of either the anti-phospho-PKB antibody or anti-PKB. The membranes were washed and treated for 1 h with secondary antibody (1:10000) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins were visualized by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After the 18-h incubation, the different groups of adipocytes were washed and 5 ml of packed cells were resuspended in an equal volume of 5% metaphosphoric acid. After homogenization using a Teflon pestle, the homogenate was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant (100 μl) was used for the GSH assay, which was performed according to the procedure provided by the manufacturer (Calbiochem). Adipocytes were prepared and added to the various culture conditions described above. DCF-DA (20 μmfinal concentration) was added at time 0, and the incubation continued at 37 °C. At the times indicated, a 1-ml aliquot of cell suspension was removed, resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS, and subjected to flow cytometry analysis (Epics Elite cell sorter, Beckman-Coulter) using an excitatory wavelength of 488 nm and detection wavelength of 525 nm (range, 500–545). The mean fluorescence intensity of 10,000 cells from each sample was determined. Signals detected from cells incubated in the absence of probe were considered as background and subtracted. Exposure of adipocytes to H2O2 was used as a positive control. Dead cells and debris were excluded by electronic gating of forward and side scatter measurements (54Banki K. Hutter E. Colombo E. Gonchoroff N.J. Perl A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32994-33001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). After the 18-h incubation, the different groups of cells were washed and incubated with 1 mm vanadate in 3% BSA-KRBH for 120 min. At the end of the incubation, samples were centrifuged and the infranatant buffer was removed. Three hundred μl of packed cells were pipetted into 500-μl glass tubes, which were flushed with N2. The tubes were inserted directly into the Bruker TE102 pre-cooled cavity by means of a Teflon sample holder. EPR spectra were collected using a Bruker ECS-106 spectrometer equipped with a model B-VT2000 temperature controller. Liquid N2 was used to maintain the temperature of the sample, which was measured to an accuracy of ± 0.1 K with a chromium-alumel thermocouple located in the glass Dewar and positioned just below the cavity. The EPR measurements were performed at 223 K. The EPR instrument parameters were as follows: microwave frequency, 9.4 GHz; microwave power, 25.0 milliwatts; magnetic field, 3365 ± 1000 G; modulation frequency, 50 Hz; modulation amplitude, 8 G. Scanning interval of the magnetic field ranged from 1000 to 1200 G. The EPR spectra parameters were determined by the ECS-106 Bruker data manipulation program. The temperature was chosen to increase the sensitivity and stability of the measurements of rapidly oxidizing paramagnetic centers in biological samples. After the 18-h incubation, the different groups of cells were washed and incubated for 0–120 min in the presence of 1 mm vanadate in 3% BSA-KRBH. At the times indicated, the adipocytes were washed five times with PBS made up in double distilled (dd) de-ionized H2O at 22 °C. In preliminary experiments we determined that there was no vanadium detectable in the fourth or fifth washes after adipocytes were exposed to up to 10 mmvanadate. The cells were separated by centrifugation, and 100-μl aliquots were digested overnight at 23 °C in 100 μl of concentrated (60%) nitric acid. The solubilized supernatant was diluted 50 times in dd de-ionized water. Total vanadium concentrations were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry (55Degani H. Gochin M. Karlish S.J. Shechter Y. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 5795-5799Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). A standard curve was measured using vanadate dissolved in 0.1% nitric acid made with dd de-ionized water. Sodium orthovanadate was dissolved in water and was stored at −20 °C. Vanadyl sulfate was dissolved in water just prior to use to limit oxidation, and N2 was bubbled through all solutions to prevent oxidation. Recombinant glutathione S-transferase/PTP-IB (GST/PTP-1B) fusion protein bound to glutathione-agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) was washed three times with Buffer A (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mm DTT, and 150 mm NaCl). The GST/PTP-1B fusion protein was then resuspended at a concentration of 1.25 ng/μl in Buffer A supplemented with 125 μg/ml BSA. Five μl of vanadate or vanadyl solution (final assay concentration of 0–4000 mm) were placed in the wells of a flat-bottomed, 96-well plate (Corning). Twenty μl of Buffer A was added followed by 20 μl (25 μg)"
https://openalex.org/W2061887210,"Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) are key regulators of the eukaryotic cell division cycle. Cdk1 (Cdc2) and Cdk2 should be bound to regulatory subunits named cyclins as well as phosphorylated on a conserved Thr located in the T-loop for full enzymatic activity. Cdc2- and Cdk2-cyclin complexes can be inactivated by phosphorylation on the catalytic cleft-located Thr-14 and Tyr-15 residues or by association with inhibitory subunits such as p21Cip1. We have recently identified a novel Cdc2 regulator named RINGO that plays an important role in the meiotic cell cycle of Xenopus oocytes. RINGO can bind and activate Cdc2 but has no sequence homology to cyclins. Here we report that, in contrast with Cdc2- cyclin complexes, the phosphorylation of Thr-161 is not required for full activation of Cdc2 by RINGO. We also show that RINGO can directly stimulate the kinase activity of Cdk2 independently of Thr-160 phosphorylation. Moreover, RINGO-bound Cdc2 and Cdk2 are both less susceptible to inhibition by p21Cip1, whereas the Thr-14/Tyr-15 kinase Myt1 can negatively regulate the activity of Cdc2-RINGO with reduced efficiency. Our results indicate that Cdk-RINGO complexes may be active under conditions in which cyclin-bound Cdks are inhibited and can therefore play different regulatory roles.

The activity of Cdk-cyclin complexes can be inhibited by phosphorylation of residues present within the ATP-binding region of the Cdk, Thr-14 and Tyr-15 in higher eukaryotes (24Gould K.L. Nurse P. Nature. 1989; 342: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 25Krek W. Nigg E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Two kinases, Wee1 and Myt1, have been shown to phosphorylate Cdc2 either only on Thr-14 or Tyr-15 or on both residues, depending on the species (26Liu F. Stanton J.J. Wu Z.Q. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 27Atherton-Fessler S. Liu F. Gabrielli B. Lee M.S. Peng C.Y. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Biol.

Both kinases are down-regulated by phosphorylation just before entry into the M phase of the cell cycle (28Mueller P.R. Coleman T.R. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Science. 1995; 270: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 29Mueller P.R. Coleman T.R. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 119-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 30Tang Z.H. Coleman T.R. Dunphy W.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3427-3436Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Cdk-cyclin complexes can also associate with small inhibitory molecules, the CKIs (Cdk inhibitors) (31Pines J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 143-145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). CKIs interact both with the amino-terminal lobe of the Cdk and with the cyclin subunit (32Chen J. Saha P. Kornbluth S. Dynlacht B.D. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4673-4682Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), and they can inhibit cyclin-bound Cdks by disrupting the correct folding of the catalytic cleft of the kinase and by interfering with CAK-induced phosphorylation (reviewed in Ref.4). During the progesterone-induced meiotic maturation (G2/M phase progression) of Xenopus oocytes, two different Cdc2 populations need to be activated. In the G2-arrested oocyte, about 10% of the Cdc2 is associated with cyclin B and phosphorylated on Thr-161 but maintained inactive by phosphorylation on Thr-14 and Tyr-15. The remaining 90% of the Cdc2 is free, not complexed with cyclins, but it also appears to be required for progesterone-triggered M phase entry. Thus, the G2/M progression in oocytes involves dephosphorylation of Thr-14/Tyr-15 residues of the cyclin B-associated Cdc2, which is preceded by the activation of monomeric Cdc2 by newly synthesized proteins (reviewed in Ref. 33Nebreda A.R. Ferby I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 666-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This free Cdc2 recruited to newly formed complexes during maturation should be able to escape the mechanisms that normally ensure the inhibition of Cdc2-cyclin complexes in the G2-arrested oocyte. A candidate for this triggering role is a recently identified protein named RINGO (rapid inducer of G2/M progression in oocytes) (34Ferby I. Blazquez M. Palmer A. Eritja R. Nebreda A.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2177-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) or Speedy (35Lenormand J.L. Dellinger R.W. Knudsen K.E. Subramani S. Donoghue D.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1869-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This protein is required for the meiotic G2/M progression in Xenopus oocytes and can bind to and stimulate the kinase activity of Cdc2 (34Ferby I. Blazquez M. Palmer A. Eritja R. Nebreda A.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2177-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) as well as bind to Cdk2 (35Lenormand J.L. Dellinger R.W. Knudsen K.E. Subramani S. Donoghue D.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1869-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Here we have shown that RINGO binding also activates Cdk2 and have analyzed the biochemical mechanisms that regulate Cdc2 and Cdk2 activation by RINGO. Our results indicate that RINGO-bound Cdc2 and Cdk2 are active in the absence of the conserved T-loop located Thr phosphorylation and at the same time are more resistant to negative regulation via inhibitory phosphorylations and association with CKIs. MalE-RINGO was expressed in Escherichia coliand purified as described (34Ferby I. Blazquez M. Palmer A. Eritja R. Nebreda A.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2177-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The GST fusion proteins of Xenopus Cdc2 wild type, K33R, and T161A,Xenopus Cdk2 wild type, K33R, and T160A, human p21Cip1, and human cyclin A were bacterially expressed and purified as described (36Palmer A. Gavin A.C. Nebreda A.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5037-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Human His-cyclin B1 was expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells and purified as described (37Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 564-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Human Myt1 purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells was provided by R. Booher (38Booher R.N. Holman P.S. Fattaey A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22300-22306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Cak1/Civ1-His (both wild type and the kinase-dead mutant K31A) was purified from yeast and provided by C. Mann (20Thuret J.Y. Valay J.G. Faye G. Mann C. Cell. 1996; 86: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Fully grown stage VI Xenopus oocytes were microinjected with 50 nl of the indicated recombinant proteins or in vitrotranscribed capped mRNAs prepared using the MEGAscript kit (Ambion). The RINGO and Cdc2 constructs for in vitrotranscription have been described previously (34Ferby I. Blazquez M. Palmer A. Eritja R. Nebreda A.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2177-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 39Nebreda A.R. Gannon J.V. Hunt T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5597-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The Cdc2 T161A mutant was prepared by polymerase chain reaction using as a template the same Cdc2 construct and the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Oocyte lysates were prepared in 4 volumes of EB buffer (80 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm EGTA, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.3, and protease inhibitors) and fractionated exactly as described in Ref.40 to obtain the 40–60% ammonium sulfate fraction F60, which was stored in aliquots at −80 °C. Aliquots of the F60 cytosolic fraction corresponding to 80 oocytes were thawed, and the ammonium sulfate pellet was dissolved in 400 μl of EB buffer. The reconstituted F60 was then concentrated on a Microcon-10 filter device (Amicon-Millipore) to a final volume of 80 μl, supplemented with 10 μl of 1 mm ATP and 10 μl of 0.5 mmprotein kinase A inhibitor peptide (Sigma). In a typical reaction, 15 μl of freshly reconstituted F60 were preincubated with 10 μl of purified Cak1/Civ1 or p21Cip1 for 15 min at 30 °C followed by a further incubation with 10 μl of His-cyclin B1 or MalE-RINGO for 15 min at 30 °C. Myt1 (10 μl) was added after cyclin B1 or RINGO. In some cases, Myt1 was added in the F60 in the presence of RINGO or cyclin B1 and 100 μm ATP. When any of these components were not included in the reaction, 10 μl of EB buffer were added. The histone H1 kinase activity was measured in a final volume of 50 μl in the presence of 100 μm ATP, 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.3 mg/ml of histone H1 (Sigma). After 15 min at 30 °C, the kinase reactions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. For quantification, the histone H1 bands were excised from the gel, and radioactive phosphate incorporation was determined by liquid scintillation counting (Wallac 1409 counter). In some experiments, phosphorylated bands were directly quantified on the gels using a Fuji phosphorimaging device. Bacterially expressed GST·Cdc2 proteins could not directly be activated in vitro but require prior incubation in concentratedXenopus oocyte extracts (34Ferby I. Blazquez M. Palmer A. Eritja R. Nebreda A.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2177-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), perhaps for the correct folding of the proteins. The GST·Cdc2 proteins were then recovered on glutathione-Sepharose beads (10 μl, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and washed three times with EB buffer before being used for kinase reactions. In contrast, purified bacterially produced GST·Cdk2 was directly used for the Cdk2 activation assays. Typically 1–2 μm GST-fused Cdc2 or Cdk2 were used per assay following the same protocol as indicated above for the F60 cytosolic fraction except that we used a final volume of 12 μl. Immunoprecipitations and immunoblottings were performed as described in Ref. 36Palmer A. Gavin A.C. Nebreda A.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5037-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, using the anti-Cdc2 monoclonal antibody A17 coupled to beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), the anti-Cdc2 monoclonal antibody 3E1 (a kind gift from Julian Gannon and Tim Hunt), and affinity-purified rabbit anti-RINGO antibodies (34Ferby I. Blazquez M. Palmer A. Eritja R. Nebreda A.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2177-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To recover GST·p21Cip1 and its associated proteins, 45 μl of the F60 fraction were diluted to 100 μl with EB buffer, and then 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads were added. After a 45-min incubation, the beads were recovered by centrifugation and washed three times. Both supernatant and bead fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting using the anti-Cdc2 antibody 3E1. We have previously shown that purified recombinant RINGO can stimulate the kinase activity of Cdc2 expressed in insect cells or in Xenopus oocytes as well as bacterially produced GST·Cdc2 (34Ferby I. Blazquez M. Palmer A. Eritja R. Nebreda A.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2177-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). As full activation of Cdc2-cyclin complexes requires phosphorylation of Cdc2 on Thr-161 (3Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar, 4Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar), we investigated whether this phosphorylation was also required for activation of Cdc2 by RINGO. We incubated purified RINGO or cyclin B1 proteins with the F60 fraction prepared from G2-arrested oocyte extracts by ammonium sulfate precipitation, which contains only monomeric Cdc2 but not A- and B-type cyclins or Cdk2 (40Karaiskou A. Jessus C. Brassac T. Ozon R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3747-3756PubMed Google Scholar) (see supplementary data). The experiment was performed in the absence or presence of the monomeric yeast Cdk-activating kinase Cak1/Civ1, which can efficiently phosphorylate Thr-161 in Cdc2 (20Thuret J.Y. Valay J.G. Faye G. Mann C. Cell. 1996; 86: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 21Kaldis P. Sutton A. Solomon M. Cell. 1996; 86: 553-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 22Espinoza F.H. Farrell A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Morgan D.O. Science. 1996; 273: 1714-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). When the F60 was preincubated in the presence of Cak1/Civ1, we observed a strong increase in the H1 kinase activity triggered by purified cyclin B1, as expected (Fig.1, A, B, andE). The addition of RINGO to the F60 induced H1 kinase activity (Fig. 1, C–E). However, Cak1/Civ1 did not increase but rather partially inhibited the RINGO-induced H1 kinase activity in the same F60 fraction (Fig. 1,C–E). Cak1/Civ1 had the same effect when added to the extract before or after the addition of RINGO (data not shown). This suggests that T-loop phosphorylation is not needed for (and may even impair) Cdc2 activation by RINGO. The reduction of RINGO-induced Cdc2 activity in the presence of Cak1/Civ1 may be attributable to an inhibitory effect of the phosphate bound to Thr-161 or to the interference between RINGO and Cak1/Civ1 for Cdc2 interaction. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we compared the effect of wild type Cak1/Civ1 and a kinase-inactive Cak1/Civ1 mutant on the RINGO-induced H1 kinase activity of the F60 fraction (Fig. 1 F). Both wild type and kinase-dead Cak1/Civ1 proteins inhibited Cdc2 activity to the same extent, indicating that the inhibitory effect of Cak1/Civ1 on Cdc2-RINGO probably involves steric interference. To confirm these results, we used bacterially produced GST·Cdc2 preincubated in concentrated Xenopus oocyte extracts (34Ferby I. Blazquez M. Palmer A. Eritja R. Nebreda A.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2177-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). RINGO was able to stimulate the H1 kinase activity of wild type GST·Cdc2 but not of an inactive GST·Cdc2 K33R mutant protein processed in parallel (Fig.2 A). We then incubated wild type GST·Cdc2 or the GST·Cdc2 T161A mutant in the absence or presence of Cak1/Civ1 and assayed their kinase activity on histone H1 (Fig. 2 B). As expected, cyclin B1 was able to activate the H1 kinase activity of GST·Cdc2, and this was strongly enhanced by the presence of Cak1/Civ1 in the case of Cdc2 wild type but not the Cdc2 T161A mutant (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, RINGO activated both Cdc2 wild type and the T161A mutant to similar extents (Fig.2 B), and their kinase activities were not further increased in the presence of Cak1/Civ1. In fact, Cak1/Civ1 partially inhibited the RINGO-dependent activation of Cdc2 but did not inhibit the nonphosphorylable T161A mutant (Fig. 2 B). This suggests that the inhibition might not require Cak1/Civ1 catalytic activity but is apparently abolished by replacing the Thr-161 of Cdc2 with an Ala residue. Altogether, the results indicate that the activation of Cdc2 by RINGO, either endogenous Cdc2 present in oocyte extracts or purified recombinant GST·Cdc2, can occur in the absence of Thr-161 phosphorylation. Furthermore, we reproducibly observed that Cdc2-RINGO complexes exhibit a lower specific activity toward histone H1 than Thr-161-phosphorylated Cdc2-cyclin B complexes. Consistent with these in vitro results, we also found that overexpression in Xenopus oocytes of either wild type Cdc2 or the T161A Cdc2 mutant resulted in similar levels of RINGO-triggered H1 kinase activity (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, the level of H1 kinase activity triggered by ectopic cyclin B1 was strongly reduced in Cdc2 T161A-expressing oocytes (Fig.3 A). These results indicate that RINGO is also able to induce Cdc2 activation independently of Thr-161-phosphorylation in oocytes. Moreover, RINGO binds Cdc2 under these conditions since we could co-immunoprecipitate Cdc2 and RINGO from oocyte extracts but only upon overexpression of the proteins (Fig. 3 B). RINGO has been shown to bind to Cdk2 upon overexpression in Xenopus oocytes, although it was not reported whether this resulted in the activation of Cdk2 by RINGO (35Lenormand J.L. Dellinger R.W. Knudsen K.E. Subramani S. Donoghue D.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1869-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We found that the kinase activity of bacterially produced GST·Cdk2 was directly activated (without any prior incubation in oocyte extracts) by recombinant RINGO, as determined by using histone H1 as anin vitro substrate (Fig.4 A). Moreover, the addition of Cak1/Civ1 did not modify the extent of RINGO-triggered Cdk2 activation, whereas Cak1/Civ1 was absolutely required for the cyclin A-induced activation of GST·Cdk2 (Fig. 4 A). Under these conditions, we confirmed that Cak1/Civ1 phosphorylated Cdk2 with similar efficiency in the presence of either cyclin A or RINGO and that RINGO did not induce any Cdk2 autophosphorylation in the absence of Cak1/Civ1 (Fig.4 B). These results indicate that RINGO can directly activate Cdk2 and that this activation occurs in the absence of Thr-160 phosphorylation, as in the case of Cdc2. However, in contrast to Cdc2-cyclin B, the level of activation of Cdk2 was similar using either RINGO alone or cyclin A plus Cak1/Civ1. Interestingly, preincubation of Cdk2 with RINGO led to poor subsequent phosphorylation by Cak1/Civ1 in comparison with Cdk2 alone or Cdk2 preincubated with cyclin A (Fig.4 C, upper panel). This lower level of Cdk2 phosphorylation did not affect the H1 kinase activity of the Cdk2-RINGO complex (Fig. 4 C, lower panel). These results indicate that RINGO binding may interfere with the accessibility of Cak1/Civ1 to Cdk2. To confirm that Cdk2 activation by RINGO is truly independent of Thr-160 phosphorylation, we used the Cdk2 T160A mutant. We found that RINGO stimulated the H1 kinase activity of the T160A mutant protein as efficiently as (or perhaps even slightly better than) in the case of the wild type Cdk2 (Fig. 4 D). As a control, RINGO did not activate the Cdk2 K33R mutant. Because the phosphorylation of the conserved Thr located in the T-loop was not required for the activation of Cdc2 and Cdk2 by RINGO, we investigated whether the inhibitory phosphorylation on Thr-14/Tyr-15 could affect the activity of the Cdc2-RINGO complex. We used the human Myt1 kinase, which has been shown to phosphorylate Cdc2-cyclin complexes preferentially on Thr-14 and to inhibit their kinase activity (26Liu F. Stanton J.J. Wu Z.Q. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 38Booher R.N. Holman P.S. Fattaey A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22300-22306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). We found that the addition of 1 μm Myt1 to F60 oocyte extracts significantly reduced the H1 kinase activity triggered by either cyclin B1 or RINGO, suggesting that the Cdc2-RINGO complex is also subjected to inhibition by Myt1 (Fig.5 A). However, lower concentrations of Myt1 (below 0.3 μm) were more efficient inhibitors of histone H1 kinase activity of Cdc2-cyclin B than of Cdc2-RINGO. Using recombinant GST·Cdc2, we confirmed the reduced inhibitory effect of Myt1 on Cdc2-RINGO (Fig. 5 B). The different concentrations of recombinant GST·Cdc2 (1 μm)versus endogenous Cdc2 present in the F60 (about 0.05 μm) could explain the differences in the degree of inhibition between both systems. We also found that the reduced inhibitory effect of Myt1 on Cdc2-RINGO correlated with less efficient phosphorylation of Cdc2 in the presence of RINGO than in the presence of cyclin B1 (data not shown). Another important mechanism that down-regulates the activity of Cdks is their association with small proteins termed CKIs (4Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar). We investigated the effect of the CKI family member p21Cip1 on the RINGO-induced activation of Cdc2. As expected, when the F60 oocyte extract was preincubated with 1 μm p21Cip1 (a concentration sufficient to inhibit most of the known Cdks (41Xiong Y. Hannon G.J. Zhang H. Casso D. Kobayashi R. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (3179) Google Scholar)), the cyclin B1-induced H1 kinase activation was completely blocked. However, the H1 kinase activity triggered by RINGO was only partially inhibited (Fig.6 A). This indicates that p21Cip1 has lower affinity and/or inhibitory efficiency for the Cdc2-RINGO complex than for the Cdc2-cyclin B complex. We also investigated the ability of p21Cip1 to inhibit the Cdk2-RINGO complex. We found that 1 μmp21Cip1 had no inhibitory effect on the GST·Cdk2-RINGO complex assembled in vitro using purified recombinant proteins, although the GST·Cdk2-cyclin A complex was efficiently inhibited by the same concentration of p21Cip1 (Fig.6 B). We also found evidence that Cdc2-RINGO complexes may be more resistant to p21Cip1 inhibition in Xenopusoocytes. Injection of p21Cip1 in oocytes prevented Cdc2 activation induced by progesterone. In contrast, RINGO was still able to induce significant Cdc2 activation in p21Cip1-injected oocytes (Fig. 6 C). It therefore appears that both Cdc2- and Cdk2-RINGO complexes are less susceptible to inhibition by p21Cip1. As the interaction mediated by the MRAIL motif of cyclins is essential for the ability of p21Cip1 to inhibit Cdks, a simple interpretation of our results is that RINGO lacks the MRAIL hydrophobic patch, leading to a weak Cdk-CKI association (32Chen J. Saha P. Kornbluth S. Dynlacht B.D. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4673-4682Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 42Adams P.D. Sellers W.R. Sharma S.K. Wu A.D. Nalin C.M. Kaeling W.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6623-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, GST·p21Cip1 was added to F60 (which contains only monomeric Cdc2) in the presence of either RINGO or cyclin B1 and then recovered on glutathione-Sepharose beads to investigate binding of Cdc2 to p21Cip1 by immunoblot (Fig. 6 D). In these experiments, the addition of cyclin B1 led to the recovery of a significantly higher amount of Cdc2 associated with p21Cip1than the addition of RINGO (Fig. 6 D), suggesting that p21Cip1 has lower affinity for Cdc2-RINGO complexes. Cdks are catalytically inactive as monomers and, for full activity, should be bound to a cyclin as well as phosphorylated on a Thr located on the T-loop, whereas the catalytic cleft-located Thr-14 and Tyr-15 residues should be dephosphorylated. We have investigated the mechanism of activation of Cdks by a new protein named RINGO that has no similarity to cyclins at the amino acid sequence level. We found that Cdk-RINGO complexes respond to Cdk regulatory mechanisms in a different way than Cdk-cyclin complexes. Thus, the RINGO-induced kinase activity of Cdc2 and Cdk2 can bypass the requirement for phosphorylation of Thr located on the T-loop both in vitro and in oocytes. Moreover, Cdk-RINGO complexes appear to be less susceptible to inhibition by Thr-14/Tyr-15 phosphorylation and CKI binding. How can the activity of Cdc2- and Cdk2-RINGO complexes be independent of Thr-160/161 phosphorylation, which is essential for full activation of these Cdks by cyclins? Crystallographic studies have revealed that phosphorylation of the Thr located in the T-loop induces subtle but important conformational changes; this phosphate acts as an organizing center, stabilizing the T-loop region (which probably participates in substrate recognition) as well as the Cdk-cyclin complex (14Russo A.A. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). In fact, one of the functions of the T loop phosphorylation may be to improve the binding of protein substrates independently of the catalytic activity per se (reviewed in Ref. 4Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar). A hypothesis consistent with our results is that RINGO binding to Cdc2 and Cdk2 induces the conformational changes in the T-loop region that are normally induced upon Thr-160/161 phosphorylation. It should be noted that, in contrast to Cdc2 and Cdk2, other Cdks have been reported to be active in the absence of phosphorylation in the T-loop (for example the Cdk7-cyclin H-Mat1 complex (reviewed in Ref. 4Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar)). This is also the case for Cdk5, which associates with and is activated by a brain-specific 35-kDa subunit, p35, as well as by its 25-kDa truncated form (p25) produced by the action of proteases (43Lew J.

Interestingly, a recent crystallographic study of the neuronal Cdk5-p25 complex reveals that the interaction between the p25 activator and the T-loop of Cdk5 results in a T-loop conformation closely resembling that of the Thr-160-phosphorylated Cdk2 associated with cyclin A. 2A. Musacchio, personal communication. These data suggest a common mechanism by which non-cyclin Cdk activators could bypass the requirement for T loop phosphorylation. RINGO-bound Cdc2 and Cdk2 are also less susceptible to two mechanisms that negatively regulate the activity of Cdk-cyclin complexes: interaction with CKIs and phosphorylation on Thr-14/Tyr-15. This appears to correlate with weaker interaction with p21Cip1and less efficient phosphorylation by Myt1 of the Cdk-RINGO complexes. Interestingly, the similarity between RINGO and other non-cyclin Cdk activators also extends to the negative regulators as p25 allows Cdk5 to escape inhibition by the Tyr-15-specific kinase Wee1 (44Poon R.Y. Lew J. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5703-5708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and by CKIs such as p27Kip1 (45Lee M.H. Nikolic M. Baptista C.A. Lai E. Tsai L.H. Massague J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3259-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The absence of the MRAIL hydrophobic motif, typical of cyclins, could be responsible for the reduced inhibitory efficiency of p21Cip1, as well as Myt1, on Cdc2-RINGO. It will be interesting to test the activity of Cdk-RINGO complexes on other substrates that require the MRAIL motif (for example the retinoblastoma family (42Adams P.D. Sellers W.R. Sharma S.K. Wu A.D. Nalin C.M. Kaeling W.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6623-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar)). It is also conceivable that RINGO may provide Cdks with a substrate recognition and recruitment patch, perhaps also of a hydrophobic nature as in the MRAIL motif of cyclins (8Schulman B.A. Lindstrom D.L. Harlow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10453-10458Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Our biochemical findings confirm the properties expected for RINGO to have a triggering role in the activation of the meiotic cell cycle inXenopus oocytes. Previous results indicated that newly synthesized RINGO protein is likely to be implicated in the activation of monomeric Cdc2 during the progesterone-induced oocyte maturation (34Ferby I. Blazquez M. Palmer A. Eritja R. Nebreda A.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2177-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). About 90% of the Cdc2 present in the oocyte is not associated with cyclins (46Kobayashi H. Minshull J. Ford C. Golsteyn R. Poon R. Hunt T. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 755-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), and only part of this monomeric Cdc2 appears to be already phosphorylated on Thr-161. 3V. De Smedt, R. Poulhe, X. Cayla, A. Karaiskou, C. Jessus, and R. Ozon, submitted for publication. During the progesterone-triggered G2/M transition, newly synthesized cyclin and RINGO proteins could target the two different Cdc2 populations, phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated on Thr-161, respectively. The Cdc2-RINGO complexes would be excellent triggers of the G2/M progression of the oocyte. Firstly, they are poor substrates for Myt1, the kinase that phosphorylates Cdc2 on Thr-14/Tyr-15 and is probably responsible for the maintenance of Cdc2-cyclin B complexes inactive in G2-arrested oocytes (36Palmer A. Gavin A.C. Nebreda A.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5037-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 47Nakajo N. Yoshitome S. Iwashita J. Iida M. Uto K. Ueno S. Okamoto K. Sagata N. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 328-338PubMed Google Scholar). Secondly, Cdc2-RINGO complexes can also be active in the absence of Thr phosphorylation in the T-loop and can therefore bypass negative regulation by Thr-161 phosphatases potentially present in the oocyte, such as PP2C (48Cheng A. Ross K.E. Kaldis P. Solomon M.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2946-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Thus, the RINGO-activated Cdc2 generated in response to progesterone would not be affected by negative regulators of Cdc2 activity present in the oocyte and would be able to trigger the maturation process. Our results are also consistent with the possibility that newly synthesized RINGO may directly activate Cdk2, which is present in G2-arrested oocytes and accumulates in response to progesterone (49Rempel R.E. Sleight S., B Maller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6843-6855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Previous work based on the use of the p21Cip1 inhibitor had concluded that Cdk2 activity might be dispensable for the meiotic cell cycle in oocytes (50Furuno N. Ogawa Y. Iwashita J. Nakajo N. Sagata N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3860-3865Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, these results need to be re-evaluated in light of our observations that p21Cip1 is not an efficient inhibitor of Cdk2-RINGO. What the actual substrates of the RINGO-activated Cdc2 and Cdk2 could be in oocytes remains to be investigated. However, it should be noted that either the activation of Cdc25 or the inhibition of Myt1 should suffice to convert the inactive Cdc2-cyclin B complexes into active M-phase promoting factor and thus start the auto-amplification feedback loops that would induce entry into M-phase of meiosis of the oocyte.

Activities of pX likely relevant to hepatocyte transformation include activation of the mitogenic RAS-RAF-MAPK and JNK pathways. To assess the importance of mitogenic pathway activation by pX in transformation, we employed a cellular model system composed of two tetracycline-regulated, pX-expressing cell lines, constructed in AML12-immortalized hepatocytes. This system includes the differentiated 3pX-1 and the de-differentiated 4pX-1 hepatocytes. Our studies have demonstrated that conditional pX expression transforms only 3pX-1 cells. Here, comparative in vitro kinase assays and variousin vivo analyses demonstrate that pX affects an inverse activation of RAS-RAF-MAPK and JNK pathways in 3pX-1 versus4pX-1 cells. Sustained pX-dependent RAS-RAF-MAPK pathway activation is observed in pX-transforming 3pX-1 cells, whereas sustained pX-dependent JNK pathway activation is observed in pX non-transforming 4pX-1 cells. This differential, pX-dependent mitogenic pathway activation affects differential activation of cAMP-response element-binding protein and c-Jun and determines the proliferative response of 3pX-1 and 4pX-1 cells. Furthermore, tetracycline-regulated, pX-NLS-expressing cell lines demonstrate that expression of the nuclear pX-NLS variant minimally activates the RAS-RAF-MAPK pathway and results in markedly reduced transformation.

Schneider R.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4747-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 25Benn J. Schneider R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Virol. 1996; 70: 4798-4985Crossref Google Scholar) pathways, resulting in enhanced transcription from AP-1 and NF-κB cis-acting elements. pX-mediated activation of the RAS-RAF-MAPK pathway has been linked to accelerated entry of cells into S phase (4Benn J. Schneider R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furthermore, the significance of the pX-dependent activation of the JNK pathway also remains unclear, since JNK pathway activation in some cases has been linked to transformation (27Antonyak M.A. Moscatello D.K.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2439-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To understand the significance of pX-induced reprogramming of the mitogenic process in hepatocyte transformation, we employed a new cellular model, composed of immortalized hepatocytes, AML12 cells (34Wu J.C. Merlino G. Fausto N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), expressing pX via the tetracycline-regulated expression system (35Tarn C. Bilodeau M.L. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2327-2336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We have characterized two hepatocyte lineages derived from AML12 cells as follows: 1) a differentiated hepatocyte (3pX-1) cell line, similar to the parental AML12 cells, and 2) a de-differentiated hepatocyte (4pX-1) cell line. We have demonstrated that conditional expression of pX leads to transformation in the differentiated 3pX-1 hepatocyte cell line; by contrast, expression of pX in the de-differentiated 4pX-1 cell line does not lead to transformation (35Tarn C. Bilodeau M.L. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2327-2336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Importantly, our observations agree with clinical data reporting the majority of HCC is derived from differentiated hepatocytes (36Craig J.R. Peters R.L. Edmondson H.A. Atlas of Tumor Pathology, 2nd Series. Armed Forces Inst. Pathol., Washington, D. C.1989Google Scholar) versus the progenitor “oval cells.” Thus, our cellular model system is ideal for investigating physiologically relevant, early signaling events activated by pX during hepatocyte transformation, and for comparing these to signaling events occurring in a cellular environment refractory to pX-mediated cellular transformation. Herein, we characterize the mitogenic status of the 3pX-1 and 4pX-1 cell lines affected by pX, thus providing for the first time information regarding early mechanistic events linked to pX-mediated transformation. We observe a differential and sustained pX-dependent activation of RAS-RAF-MAPK pathway in the pX-transforming 3pX-1 cells and a sustained pX-dependent JNK pathway activation in the pX-non-transforming 4pX-1 cells. We demonstrate that this differential pX-mediated mitogenic pathway activation results in differential activation of the downstream effectors, c-Jun and CREB. In addition, we demonstrate that the proliferative response of each cell line is mediated via the mitogenic pathway that displays sustained activation by pX. Furthermore, we report that tetracycline-regulated cell lines expressing a pX-NLS variant, localized exclusively to the nucleus (19Doria M. Klein N. Lucito R. Schneider R.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4747-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), display minimal mitogenic pathway activation and markedly reduced transformation. Our results demonstrate the causal role of the sustained RAS-RAF-MAPK pathway activation in pX-mediated hepatocyte transformation. Cell lines 3pX-1, 4pX-1, and 3pX-NLS, derived from AML12 cells (34Wu J.C. Merlino G. Fausto N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), were propagated as described (35Tarn C. Bilodeau M.L. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2327-2336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). All experiments employed the tetracycline-regulated cell lines at passages 4–10. Tetracycline-regulated, pX-NLS-expressing cell lines were constructed in AML12 clones 3 and 4 (G418r, tTA+), stably transfected with 5 μg of PUHD10–3-X-NLS plasmid via selection with hygromycin (35Tarn C.

Putative and conditional pX-NLS-expressing clones were selected by transiently transfecting the CRE3-CAT reporter in the presence of 10 μm forskolin, ±5 μg/ml tetracycline, and further verified with TRE- and NF-κB-luciferase expression as negative controls. All experiments were carried out under serum starvation, as described previously (35Tarn C. Bilodeau M.L. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2327-2336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium without fetal bovine serum (0%) and insulin/transferrin/selenium (ITS) for 18–24 h, in the presence of 5 μg/ml tetracycline, 10 μmepidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor PD 153035 (Calbiochem), and 25 μm PD 98059 (Calbiochem). Following serum starvation, cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated an additional 2 h in medium lacking ITS and containing 2% fetal bovine serum and 10 μm PD 153035 before removal of tetracycline. pX synthesis by tetracycline removal was carried out for the indicated time course in medium lacking ITS and containing 2% fetal bovine serum and 10 μm PD 153035. The in vivo signal transduction pathway trans-reporting system (Stratagene) includes the pFR-luciferase reporter and expression vectors pFC-dbd (negative control), pFC-MEK1 (positive control for Elk-1), pFC-MEKK1 (positive control for c-Jun), and the transactivators pFA-c-Jun, pFA-Elk-1, pFA-CREB, and pFA-CHOP. Each transfection was performed in triplicate 3.5-cm plates, employing Fugene 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemistry). Transfected plasmids included 500 ng of pFR-luciferase reporter, co-transfected in the presence of 50 ng of pFA-Elk-1 or 100 ng of pFA-c-Jun. Positive and negative controls also contained 50 ng each of pFC-MEK1, pFC-MEKK, or pFC-dbd, respectively. CREB transreporter assays employed 100 ng of pFR-luciferase with 100 ng of pFA-CREB in 4pX-1 cells and 200 ng of pFR-luciferase with 50 ng of pFA-CREB in 3pX-1 cells. CHOP-10 transreporter assays employed 100 ng of pFR-luciferase and 100 ng of pFA-CHOP for 4pX-1 cells, and 100 ng of pFR-luciferase and 500 ng of pFA-CHOP for 3pX-1 cells. Cyclin A-luciferase assays (37Wang E.H. Zou S. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2658-2669Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) were performed in serum-starved cells (10-h serum starvation for 3pX-1 cells and 18–24 h for 4pX-1 cells) using 400 ng of cyclin A-luciferase for 3pX-1 cells and 200 ng for 4pX-1 cells, in the presence of 100 ng plasmid encoding dn RasN17, dn ACREB, or dn MEKK1. DNAs were added onto serum-starved cells, which were washed three times with PBS and placed in media containing 2% fetal bovine serum, 10 μm PD 153035, and 5 μg/ml tetracycline. Following 12–24 h incubation, transfected cells were washed three times in PBS and incubated for an additional 24 h in media containing 2% fetal bovine serum, 10 μm PD 153035, ±5 μg/ml tetracycline, and ± 25 μm PD 98059, as indicated in figure legends. Luciferase assays were performed as described previously (16Barnabas S. Hai T. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20684-20690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and expressed per μg of total protein extract. 3pX-1 and 4pX-1 cells plated in 96-well dishes were serum-starved for 10 h, washed three times in PBS, and incubated in media containing 2% fetal bovine serum, 10 μm PD 153038, ±5 μg/ml tetracycline, and ± 25 μm PD 98059. DNA synthesis was measured at 6, 18, and 30 h following tetracycline removal by labeling cells in medium containing 20 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]thymidine, for the last 4, 12, and 18 h, respectively. Each measurement was performed in triplicate, and the data represent averages from three independent experiments. For MAPK (ERK1,2) enzyme assays, serum-starved cells grown for the indicated interval ± 5μg/ml tetracycline were collected in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm orthovanadate, 10 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate decahydrate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and normalized for protein content. 500 μg of whole cell extract (WCE) was assayed for ERK1,2 activity using the immunoprecipitation-immunocomplex kinase assay (38Ramocki M.B.

ERK1,2 immunoprecipitations were performed in RIPA buffer with 4 μl of polyclonal MAPK antibody (38Ramocki M.B. Johnson S.E. White M. Ashendel C.L. Konieczny S.F. Taparowsky E.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3547-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) in the presence of 30 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) slurry for 30 min at room temperature. The protein A-Sepharose-antibody complex was washed with 500 μl of buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, and 3 mm KCl) and resuspended in 20 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 5.4 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 50 μm ATP, 2.5 mg/ml myelin basic protein (MBP, Sigma), and 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP). Kinase reactions were performed for 30 min at 30 °C and terminated by addition of 1× SDS sample buffer. Analysis was by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. JNK kinase assays employed cellular extracts prepared from serum-starved cells (35Tarn C. Bilodeau M.L. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2327-2336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Kinase assays were performed with modifications of the solid phase kinase protocol (39Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch E.J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar), using 1 μg of GST-c-Jun-(1–79) (Stratagene) as substrate. WCE (500 μg) was assayed for JNK activity for 20 min at 30 °C. Analysis was by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Kinase assays were quantitated by digital densitometry using OPTIMAS 6.1 software. The value obtained for the phosphorylated substrate (i.e. MBP or GST-c-Jun) was normalized to that of the corresponding total ERK1,2 or JNK1,2 enzyme detected by Western blot analyses. The ratio (−Tet/+Tet) of these values is plotted in the histograms, derived from at least three independent assays. For detecting total ERK1,2 or JNK1,2 enzymes, 10 μg of WCE was analyzed by Western blot assays using the ECL detection reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and anti-MAPK (Promega) or anti-JNK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively. For detecting phosphorylated CREB, cells were grown for the indicated time course ±5 μg/ml tetracycline, ±10 μm SB 203580, or ±25 μm PD 98059. Incubation with SB 203580 (10 μm) was initiated during the serum starvation period and was extended during the length of pX synthesis following tetracycline removal. Prior to harvesting, cells were washed in PBS containing 5 mm NaF, and nuclear extracts were prepared in buffer (Nonidet P-40 (0.2% for 3pX-1 cells and 0.5% for 4pX-1 cells), 5 mm NaF, 5 mm orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). For detecting phosphorylated c-Jun, cells were lysed directly in 1× SDS sample buffer, (62.5 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.15 mβ-mercaptoethanol). Western blot analyses were performed with 15 μg of extract per lane, employing phospho-CREB and phospho-c-Jun antibodies (New England Biolabs), respectively. OPTIMAS 6.1 software was used for quantitation of Western blot assays. Values obtained by digital densitometry for phosphorylated CREB or c-Jun were normalized to those of total CREB or c-Jun, respectively. The ratio (−Tet/+Tet) of these values, plotted in the histogram, is derived from five independent experiments. Prism software was employed for statistical analyses. We demonstrated previously (35Tarn C. Bilodeau M.L. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2327-2336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) that pX expression, following tetracycline removal, affects a differential induction of the immediate-early genes (IEG) c-fos and ATF3 in the 3pX-1 and 4pX-1 cell lines. Induction of IEGs follows activation of the mitogenic cascades (40Hai T.W. Wolfgang C.D. Marsee D.K. Allen A.E. Sivaprasad U. Gene Expr. 1999; 7: 321-335PubMed Google Scholar, 41Treisman R. Curr.

Therefore, the distinct, pX-dependent expression pattern of IEGs in 3pX-1 and 4pX-1 cells suggests that pX differentially activates mitogenic RAS-RAF-MAPK and JNK pathways and that this differential activation may be linked to different cell growth outcomes (35Tarn C. Bilodeau M.L. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2327-2336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In support of our hypothesis, recent studies (43Cook S.J. Aziz N. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 330-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the repertoire of IEG expression is determined by the duration of activation of mitogenic cascades. Sustained mitogenic pathway activation was shown to elicit a different IEG expression profile, when compared with transient activation (43Cook S.J. Aziz N. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 330-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To study the kinetics of pX activation of the RAS-RAF-MAPK and JNK pathways, we measured activation of ERK1,2 (Fig.1) and JNK (Fig.2) enzymes by in vitro assays employing cellular extracts prepared at different intervals after pX synthesis. Importantly, we have demonstrated previously by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction that expression of X mRNA is detected as early as 1 h after tetracycline removal in serum-starved 3pX-1 and 4pX-1 cells (35Tarn C. Bilodeau M.L. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2327-2336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the present study we employ these same serum starvation conditions (35Tarn C. Bilodeau M.L. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2327-2336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), including treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor PD 153035 (44Fry D.W. Kraker A.J.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Following serum starvation, pX synthesis is initiated by tetracycline removal, in media containing 2% fetal bovine serum and 10 μm PD 153035. Under these growth conditions we prepared cellular extracts from 3pX-1 (Fig. 1 A) and 4pX-1 (Fig.1 B) cells grown for 1–15 h, ± tetracycline.Figure 2Differential pX-dependent JNK enzyme activation in 3pX-1 and 4pX-1 cells.

Representative ERK1,2 assays using cellular extracts from 3pX-1 and 4pX-1 cells are shown in Fig. 1, A and B, respectively. Quantitation of at least three independent assays is shown in Fig. 1 C. In the pX-transforming 3pX-1 cells (Fig. 1, A and C), we observe a modest 1.5-fold activation of ERK1,2 1 h after pX synthesis is initiated that progressively increases to nearly 2-fold by 6 h, returning to basal level activation after 6 and before 15 h. This moderate activation of ERK1,2 by pX (Fig.1 A) is in agreement with observations by others (45Klein N. Schneider R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6427-6436Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 46Klein N.P. Bouchard M.J. Wang L.H. Kobarg C. Schneider R.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5019-5027Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). By contrast, activation of ERK1,2 in 4pX-1 cells (Fig. 1, B andC) is more pronounced at 1–2 h after pX synthesis is initiated, reaching nearly 3-fold activation by 1 h, but returning to basal activation after only 2 and before 6 h. Western blot analyses of the same cellular extract with antibody detecting total MAPK demonstrated equal amounts of total ERK1,2. Likewise, in vitro JNK assays were performed with cellular extracts from 3pX-1 and 4pX-1 cells, using the solid phase kinase assay and GST-c-Jun as the substrate (39Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch E.J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar). Representative JNK assays are shown in Fig. 2, A and B; quantitation of at least three independent assays is shown in Fig. 2 C. In 3pX-1 cells, activation of JNK by pX is not detectable in the intervals analyzed (Fig. 2, A and C). By contrast, in 4pX-1 cells, activation of JNK is observed as early as 30 min after pX synthesis is initiated. A 3.5-fold activation of JNK is observed within 1 h after pX synthesis in 4pX-1 cells and remains detectable even at 15 h after tetracycline removal (Fig. 2 B). Equivalent amounts of total JNK were analyzed in the respective tetracycline treated and untreated samples, verified by Western blot analyses (Fig. 2), using antibody detecting total JNK. To assess thein vivo consequence of pX-dependent mitogenic pathway activation observed in our in vitro kinase assays (Figs. 1 and 2), we examined activation of their downstream effectors, namely activation of Elk-1 (47Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar), CREB (48Ginty D. Bonni A. Greenberg M. Cell. 1994; 77: 713-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar), and c-Jun (49Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). These transcription factors are activated by phosphorylation at serine residues within their transactivation domains (47Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). Elk-1 and c-Jun phosphorylation is mediated directly by activated ERK1,2 and JNK enzymes, respectively, whereas CREB is a distal target of ERK1,2 (48Ginty D. Bonni A."

This effect of insulin on glucose transporter translocation is mediated largely through the activation/action of phosphatidylinositol (PI)1 3-kinase and 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK-1) and their downstream effectors, viz. atypical protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, ζ and/or λ (1Bandyopadhyay G.

In diabetes mellitus, however, insulin is either deficient or ineffective, but, despite impaired insulin-stimulated glucose transport, whole body glucose disposal rates are surprisingly normal or increased (9DeFronzo R.A. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 667-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Vaag A. Hother-Nielsen O Skott P. Andersen P. Richter E.A. Beck-Nielsen H.

The maintenance of glucose transport in diabetes mellitus apparently occurs at the expense of hyperglycemia, which concomitantly causes “glucotoxicity” (i.e. clinical insulin resistance and diabetic pathological complications). In promoting glucotoxicity, hyperglycemia most likely increases glucose uptake by simple mass action, but there is uncertainty as to whether hyperglycemia, like insulin, may also increases the translocation of glucose transporters to the plasma membrane (12Galante P.

This uncertainty is heightened by the fact that there is little or no insight into potential signaling mechanisms that glucose might use to stimulate glucose transporter translocation. Presently, we evaluated the effects of glucose on signaling mechanisms that may be relevant to glucose transporter translocation/glucose transport in rat adipocytes and skeletal muscles. Our findings suggest that glucose does in fact increase GLUT4 translocation/glucose transport in these tissues, apparently by activating PKC-ζ/λ through a mechanism that is independent of PI 3-kinase but, interestingly, dependent upon both (a) the PYK2/GRB2/SOS/RAS/RAF/MEK1/ERK pathway, which we have recently reported to be activated by glucose (16Bandyopadhyay G. Sajan M.P. Kanoh Y. Standaert M.L. Burke Jr., T.R. Quon M.J. Reed B.C. Dikic I. Noel L.E. Newgard C.B. Farese R.V. J. Biol.

This novel mechanism for activating PKC-ζ/λ and stimulating GLUT4 translocation sharply contrasts with that of insulin, which utilizes PI 3-kinase and PDK-1, rather than PYK2/ERK/PLD, to activate PKC-ζ/λ and stimulate GLUT4 translocation/glucose transport.

After this equilibration period, 25 mm mannitol (to provide an osmotically balanced “control”) or 25 mmd-glucose was added along with tracer quantities of 2-[3H]deoxyglucose (2 μCi/ml) to reflect glucose uptake and l-[14C]glucose (0.2 μCi/ml) to correct for trapping of extracellular medium and associated nonspecific radioactivity (see Ref. 28Yu B.

Over a concentration range of 0–30 mm, glucose provoked incremental dose-dependent increases in Myc-GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane of rat adipocytes (Fig.1 A). Glucose-dependent increases in Myc-GLUT4 translocation were maximal within 10 min (Fig. 1 B) and largely sustained for 30 min (Fig. 1 B) but tended to diminish at longer times of incubation, viz. at 60–240 min (Fig.2 B). Insulin-induced increases in GLUT4 translocation appeared to develop more slowly over 30 min (Fig. 1 B), were surprisingly similar to or only modestly greater than those of 20–30 mm glucose (Fig. 1,B and C; also see below), and were not additive to those of glucose (Fig. 1 C). This nonadditivity may reflect the fact that relevant signaling pathways used by insulin and glucose, while initially different, appeared to converge distally, as described below.Figure 2Acute effects of glucose and insulin on translocation of endogenous GLUT4 and GLUT1 glucose transporters to the plasma membrane of rat adipocytes (A) and more prolonged effects of glucose on Myc-GLUT4 translocation in rat adipocytes (B). A, freshly isolated adipocytes were incubated in glucose-free KRP medium without treatment, incubated for 15 min with 25 mm glucose, or incubated for 30 min with 10 nm insulin. After incubation, plasma membranes and low density microsomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation and blotted for GLUT4 and GLUT1. Shown at thetop of A are representative immunoblots, below which are shown bar graphs that depict mean ± S.E. of percentage changes (relative to the control, set at 100%) of four determinations, as quantitated by measurement of chemiluminescence in a Bio-Rad Chemiluminescence/Phosphorescence Molecular Analyst Imaging System. All changes in levels of GLUT4 and GLUT1 in plasma membranes and microsomes were significant to at leastp < 0.05 (paired t test). B, adipocytes were transfected with plasmids encoding Myc-GLUT4, and after overnight incubation in DMEM/BSA medium, cells were incubated in glucose-free KRP medium for 240 min without or with 20 mmglucose being present for the indicated times, i.e. prior to termination of the experiment. Values are mean ± S.E. of four determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effects of glucose on Glut4 translocation were not due to hyperosmolality, as 20–30 mm mannitol (see Fig.1 A) or l-glucose (data not shown) had little or no effect. Of further note, glucose-dependent Myc-GLUT4 translocation was dependent upon the continued presence of glucose and was lost within 5 min of glucose removal (Fig. 1 D). In addition to increasing the translocation of transfected epitope-tagged GLUT4, glucose, like insulin, increased the translocation of endogenous GLUT4 from microsomes to the plasma membranes of rat adipocytes (Fig. 2). Also, glucose, like insulin, increased endogenous GLUT1 (Fig. 2), as well as epitope-tagged GLUT1 (Fig. 3 A), translocation to the plasma membrane. In contrast to insulin effects, glucose-dependent increases in Myc-GLUT4 translocation were not inhibited by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin (Fig.1 B). Further, as seen in Fig. 3 B, glucose effects on Myc-GLUT4 translocation were inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, the M"

We show here that mGluR1/5 activation results in oscillatory G protein coupling to phospholipase C thereby stimulating oscillations in both inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate formation and intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. The mGluR1/5-stimulated Ca2+ oscillations are translated into the synchronized repetitive redistribution of PKCβII between the cytosol and plasma membrane. The frequency at which mGluR1a and mGluR5a subtypes stimulate inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate, Ca2+, and PKCβII oscillations is regulated by the charge of a single amino acid residue localized within their G protein-coupling domains. However, oscillatory mGluR signaling does not involve the repetitive feedback phosphorylation and desensitization of mGluR activity, since mutation of the putative PKC consensus sites within the first and second intracellular loops as well as the carboxyl-terminal tail does not prevent mGluR1a-stimulated PKCβII oscillations. Furthermore, oscillations in Ca2+ continued in the presence of PKC inhibitors, which blocked PKCβII redistribution from the plasma membrane back into the cytosol. We conclude that oscillatory mGluR signaling represents an intrinsic receptor/G protein coupling property that does not involve PKC feedback phosphorylation.

However, it is unknown whether mGluR-stimulated Ca2+ oscillations are effectively translated into the cyclical activation of PKC leading to the repetitive desensitization of mGluR-mediated responses. The oscillatory activation of the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores in response to GPCR stimulation represents a fundamental mechanism of cell signaling in both non-excitable and excitable cells. Ca2+ oscillations not only fine tune gene expression during inflammatory immune responses (8Uhlen P. Laestadius A. Jahnukainen T. Soderblom T. Backhed F. Celsi G. Brismar H. Normark S. Aperia A. Richter-Dahlfors A. Nature. 2000; 405: 694-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) but are also involved in both the activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and the selective activation of different transcription factors (9De Koninck P. Schulman H. Science. 1998; 279: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, 10Dolmetsch R.E. Xu K. Lewis R.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 933-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar). Moreover, Ca2+ oscillation at different frequencies may be critically important for differential gene transcription in developing systems, since the transcription factor NF-κB is activated by low frequency Ca2+ oscillations, whereas higher frequency Ca2+ oscillations are needed to switch on the transcription factor NF-AT (10Dolmetsch R.E. Xu K. Lewis R.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 933-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar). It is also reported that Ca2+oscillations cause sustained activation of mitochondrial metabolism and may be decoded by PKCγ (11Hajnoczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 12Oancea E. Meyer T. Cell. 1998; 95: 307-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). In the present study, we explore the mechanism(s) underlying oscillatory mGluR Ca2+ signaling and test two hypotheses. 1) mGluR-stimulated Ca2+ oscillations are translated into the repetitive activation and plasma membrane translocation of PKC. 2) PKC oscillations contribute directly to oscillatory receptor/G protein-coupling. We find that repetitive G protein activation by mGluR1a and mGluR5a results in the cyclical activation of PLC resulting in oscillations in InsP3 formation and Ca2+release from intracellular stores. These mGluR-stimulated Ca2+ oscillations are effectively translated into the synchronized repetitive cytosol to plasma membrane translocation of PKCβII. However, the mutation of 10 putative PKC phosphorylation consensus sites within the intracellular domains of mGluR1a reveals that PKC phosphorylation does not underlie oscillatory mGluR signaling. Furthermore, mGluR1 and mGluR5 each stimulate InsP3, Ca2+, and PKCβII oscillations at distinct frequencies, a response that is determined by the charge of a single amino acid residue within the G protein-coupling domain of these receptors. We conclude that oscillatory mGluR signaling represents an intrinsic receptor/G protein coupling property that does not require PKC feedback phosphorylation.

To construct DsRed1-PKCβII, PKCβII cDNA was first amplified by PCR from the plasmid pBK-CMV containing the GFP-PKCβII construct (13Feng X. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10755-10762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The 5′ and 3′ primers used in this PCR contained XhoI andBamHI restriction site sequences, respectively. The PCR product generated was subsequently digested with the restriction enzymes XhoI and BamHI, and the PKCβII cDNA was cloned into the corresponding sites of the vector pDsRed1-C1 (CLONTECH). To construct GFP-PHPLC-δ1, the phospholipase C δ1 (PLC-δ1) cDNA was amplified by PCR and used as the template for generating the 522-base pair fragment, which contained the PH domain (14Stauffer T.P. Ahn S. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 343-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′ and 3′ primers used in this reaction contained HindIII andXbaI restriction site sequences, respectively. The PHPLC-δ1-containing PCR product was digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and was cloned into the corresponding sites of the vector pEGFP-C3 (CLONTECH). PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuickChangeTMSite-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). For mGluR1a the following mutations were made at position 854: D854T, D854A, and D854G. For mGluR5a the following mutations were made at position 840 (this corresponds to position 854 in mGluR1a): T840D and T840G. In addition, mGluR1a PKC consensus site mutants were constructed to create four mutants: Loop 1 (T620A and S627G), Loop 2 (T679A, S689G, and T695A), Loop 1/2 (T620A, S627G, T679A, S689G, and T695A), and C-tail (S892A, S940A, S950G, S1068A, and S1108A). Mutations and sequence integrity were confirmed by DNA sequencing. HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected using a modified calcium phosphate method as described previously (15Dale L. Bhattacharya M. Anborgh P.H. Murdoch B. Bhatia M. Nakanishi S. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38213-38220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Following transfection cells were reseeded on collagen-coated 35-mm glass-bottomed culture dishes. Prior to visualization, the cells were washed three times with HEPES-buffered salt solution, HBSS (1.2 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm NaHCO3, 20 mm HEPES, 11 mm glucose, 116 mm NaCl, 4.7 mmKCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2.5 mmCaCl2, pH 7.4) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in HBSS. Confocal microscopy was performed on a Zeiss LSM-510 laser-scanning microscope using Zeiss 63× 1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion lens. Enhanced GFP and Oregon Green 488 BAPTA fluorescence was visualized with excitation at 488 nm and emission 515–540 nm emission filter set. DsRed1 and Calcium Orange fluorescence were visualized with excitation at 543 nm and emission 590–610 nm filter set. For calcium imaging by confocal microscopy, following the manufacturer's instructions, the cells were preloaded for 30 min with 10 μm Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1 AM or Calcium Orange. Fluorescent signals were collected sequentially every 6.8–12.5 s using the Zeiss LSM software time scan function. PKC translocation time courses and Ca2+ oscillations were recorded as time series of 100–200 confocal images for each experiment. Image analysis was performed using the Zeiss LSM-510 analysis software and defined as the relative change in cytoplasmic fluorescence intensity over time in a 5-μm diameter region of interest. The time courses for GFP-PKCβII, GFP-PHPLC-δ1, and DsRed1-PKCβII translocation responses as well as increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations were plotted using GraphPad Prism. Because mGluR1a and mGluR5a stimulate Ca2+ oscillations, we sought to test whether a ubiquitously expressed conventional PKC isoform (PKCβII) (16Ron D. Kazanietz M.G. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1658-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) also exhibits cyclical patterns of cytosol to plasma membrane translocation in response to mGluR activation. Fig. 1,A and C, shows confocal images of GFP-tagged PKCβII (GFP-PKCβII) distribution in the absence (0 s) and presence of 100 μm quisqualate (20–140 s) in mGluR1a and mGluR5a-expressing HEK 293 cells. In response to the continued activation of mGluR1a and mGluR5a, GFP-PKCβII repetitively redistributes from the cytosol to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1,A and C). Three examples of the patterns of GFP-PKCβII plasma membrane oscillations in response to either mGluR1a or mGluR5a activation are shown in Fig. 1, B andD, respectively. GFP-PKCβII plasma membrane translocations occur at a frequency of 31 ± 13 oscillations/h (1 oscillation every 70–300 s, mean = 116 ± 48 s) in response to mGluR1a activation and 90 ± 28 oscillations/h (1 oscillation every 25–60 s, mean = 40 ± 12 s) in response to mGluR5a activation (Table I).Table ISummary of GFP-PKCβII oscillation frequencies in cells expressing wild-type and mutant mGluR1a and mGluR5a constructsmGluR1aOscillations/hmGluR5aOscillations/hWild type31 ± 13 (n = 52)Wild type90 ± 281-ap < 0.05versus wild-type mGluR1a.

Open table in a new tab Because mGluR activation stimulates oscillations in intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations, we investigated whether mGluR1/5-stimulated GFP-PKCβII oscillations are synchronized with mGluR1/5-induced Ca2+ oscillations. In response to mGluR1a activation with 100 μm quisqualate, increases in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration are followed rapidly by the translocation of DsRed1-PKCβII to the plasma membrane (Fig.2 A, 20 s and120 s). When intracellular free Ca2+concentrations fall to base line, DsRed1-PKCβII redistributes back into the cytosolic compartment of each cell (Fig. 2 A,70 s). Analysis of concomitant Ca2+ and DsRed1-PKCβII oscillations reveals that the frequency of Ca2+ oscillation induced by mGluR1a (Fig. 2 B) activation is mirrored exactly by the repetitive translocation of GFP-PKCβII between the cytosol and plasma membrane. Detailed examination of a single Ca2+ and DsRed1-PKCβII response (Fig. 2 B, dashed box) reveals that the rise in intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations slightly precedes the plasma membrane translocation of DsRed1-PKCβII (Fig. 2 C). Similarly, the release of DsRed1-PKCβII from the plasma membrane back into the cytosol following the inactivation of the Ca2+transient is also slightly delayed (Fig. 2 C). PKCβII oscillations in response to mGluR5a activation are also coupled to Ca2+ oscillations (Fig.3).Figure 3Oscillations in GFP-PKCβII are synchronous with mGluR5a-stimulated Ca2+ oscillations.

The treatment of cells with 50 μm BAPTA-AM to chelate intracellular free Ca2+ effectively blocked both mGluR1a- and mGluR5a-stimulated GFP-PKCβII oscillations (Fig. 4, Aand B). The role of intracellular Ca2+ stores in promoting GFP-PKCβII oscillations was investigated using thapsigargin to deplete intracellular Ca2+ stores (17Lytton J. Westlin M. Hanley M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17067-17071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thapsigargin treatment resulted in a transient increase in GFP-PKCβII localized to the plasma membrane of mGluR1a-expressing cells but eventually resulted in the inhibition of both mGluR1a- and mGluR5a-stimulated GFP-PKCβII oscillations (Fig. 4, C and D). Finally, the addition of 2.5 mm EGTA to mGluR5a-expressing cell cultures to chelate extracellular Ca2+ had very little effect on mGluR5a-stimulated GFP-PKCβII oscillations but significantly reduced the periodicity of GFP-PKCβII translocation responses to mGluR1a activation (Fig. 4, E and F). These observations indicate that both intracellular and extracellular Ca2+regulate mGluR1a but not mGluR5a-stimulated translocations in GFP-PKCβII. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), the precursor for the second messenger InsP3, is metabolized in response to the activation of GPCRs coupled to the activation of PLC (18Lee S.B. Rhee S.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Consequently, the hydrolysis of PIP2 and InsP3 formation represents a receptor-proximal event upstream of the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Changes in both PIP2 and InsP3 levels can be measured in single cells using the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of PLC-δ1 fused to GFP (GFP-PHPLC-δ1) as a fluorescent indicator (14Stauffer T.P. Ahn S. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 343-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hirose K. Kadowaki S. Tanabe M. Takeshima H. Iino M. Science. 1999; 284: 1527-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Therefore, we utilized GFP-PHPLC-δ1 to assess whether mGluR1a- and mGluR5a-stimulated Ca2+ and PKC oscillations might be associated with oscillatory G protein coupling to PLC. In the absence of mGluR1a activation, GFP-PHPLC-δ1 is localized at the plasma membrane (Fig.5 A, 0 s) due to the interaction of PLC-δ1 PH domain with membrane PIP2 (20Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.A. Sclessinger J. Cell. 1996; 85: 621-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). In response to mGluR1a activation, GFP-PHPLC-δ1 is released from the plasma membrane and accumulates in the cytosol of the cell (Fig. 5 A, 150 s). The release of GFP-PHPLC-δ1 from the plasma membrane is the consequence of both PIP2 hydrolysis and the high affinity of the PLC-δ1 PH domain for InsP3 (19Hirose K. Kadowaki S. Tanabe M. Takeshima H. Iino M. Science. 1999; 284: 1527-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Subsequently, as the mGluR-mediated response inactivates, GFP-PHPLC-δ1 is observed to redistribute back to the plasma membrane (Fig.5 A, 300 s). The persistent exposure of both mGluR1a (Fig. 5 B) and mGluR5a (Fig. 5 C) to 100 μm quisqualate results in oscillatory increases in intracellular InsP3 as measured by the cyclical movement of GFP-PHPLC-δ1 between the plasma membrane and cytosol. The oscillations in GFP-PHPLC-δ1 between the plasma membrane and cytosol in response to mGluR1a stimulation are also matched by the synchronous translocation of DsRed1-PKCβII from the cytosol to the plasma membrane (Fig. 5 D); similar results are obtained for mGluR5a (data not shown). It is possible that mGluR1a- and mGluR5a-stimulated PKC oscillations between the cytosol and plasma membrane may be sufficient to mediate repetitive cycles of mGluR phosphorylation. To investigate whether PKC-mediated phosphorylation contributes to oscillatory mGluR1a signaling, we mutated the 10 putative PKC phosphorylation consensus sites localized within Loop 1 (T620A and S627G), Loop 2 (T679A, S689G, and T695A), Loop 1/2 (T620A, S627G, T679A, S689G, and T695A), and the C-tail (S892A, S940A, S950G, S1068A, and S1108A), and we tested the resulting mutants for their capacity to stimulate oscillation in PKCβII distribution between the cytosol and plasma membrane (Fig.6 A). The mutation of the PKC phosphorylation consensus sites in Loop 1, Loop 2, Loop 1/2, and the C-tail of mGluR1a did not prevent mGluR1a-stimulated GFP-PKCβII oscillations (Fig. 6, B–E). mGluR1a mutant-stimulated GFP-PKCβII oscillation frequencies were not significantly different from those observed following the stimulation of the wild-type mGluR1a (31 ± 13 oscillations/h versus 20 ± 7 to 28 ± 8 oscillations/h) (Table I). The time courses of the representative traces shown in Fig. 6, B—E, match the time courses for wild-type mGluR1a-stimulated GFP-PKCβII oscillations shown in Fig. 1 B. Mutation of all 10 putative PKC phosphorylation consensus sites resulted in an mGluR1a mutant that was completely uncoupled from G protein (data not shown). To examine further the role of PKC phosphorylation in mGluR1-stimulated Ca2+ and GFP-PKCβII oscillations, we treated mGluR1a-expressing cells with two PKC inhibitors, staurosporine, a broad spectrum protein kinase inhibitor that inhibits multiple protein kinases, and bisindolylmaleimide I (Bis I), a PKC-selective inhibitor. The treatment of HEK 293 cells with 1 μm staurosporine inhibited mGluR1a-stimulated GFP-PKCβII oscillations resulting in the accumulation of GFP-PKCβII at the plasma membrane (Fig.7 A, top panel) but did not block mGluR1a-stimulated Ca2+ oscillations in the same cell (Fig. 7 A, bottom panel). The treatment of mGluR1a-expressing cells with 1 μm Bis I resulted in the gradual accumulation of GFP-PKCβII at the plasma membrane and the eventual inhibition of GFP-PKCβII oscillations (Fig. 7 B, top panel) but had no effect on mGluR1a-stimulated Ca2+oscillations in the same cell (Fig. 7 B, bottom panel). Identical results were observed following the staurosporine and Bis I treatment of mGluR5a-expressing cells (data not shown). These data provide additional evidence that mGluR phosphorylation by PKC is not required for mGluR-stimulated oscillations in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. It is proposed that mGluR subtype-specific Ca2+ oscillations may be regulated by differences in PKC phosphorylation of a PKC consensus site in mGluR5a (Thr-840) that is not conserved at the analogous position in mGluR1a (Asp-854) (3Kawabata S. Tsutsumi R. Kohara A. Yamaguchi T. Nakanishi S. Okada M. Nature. 1996; 383: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 4Kawabata S. Kohara A. Tsutsumi R. Itahana H. Hatashibe S. Yamaguchi T. Okada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17381-17385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6 A). The substitution of threonine residue 840 for an aspartic acid residue in mGluR5a (mGluR5a-T840D) reduces the mGluR5a-stimulated GFP-PKCβII oscillation frequency from 90 ± 28 to 38 ± 8 oscillations/h (Fig.8 A and Table I). In contrast, the replacement of aspartic acid residue 854 with a threonine residue (mGluR1a-D854T) to reconstitute a PKC phosphorylation consensus site (3Kawabata S. Tsutsumi R. Kohara A. Yamaguchi T. Nakanishi S. Okada M. Nature. 1996; 383: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) increases the frequency of mGluR1a-mediated GFP-PKCβII oscillations by 3-fold from 31 ± 13 to 94 ± 27 oscillations/h (Fig. 8 B) (Table I). A similar response is obtained for mGluR-stimulated Ca2+ oscillations (data not shown). Taken alone, these data are consistent with the idea that PKC-mediated phosphorylation accelerates the rate of mGluR-stimulated Ca2+ and PKC oscillations. However, the substitution of aspartic acid residue 854 with an alanine in mGluR1a not only increases the frequency of agonist-stimulated GFP-PKCβII oscillations to 92 ± 27 oscillations/h but also results in spontaneous GFP-PKCβII oscillations (Fig. 8 B and Table I). Because the substitution of alanine and glycine residues at aspartic acid residue 854 supports mGluR5a-like oscillation patterns, it is unlikely that repetitive phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of threonine residue 840 can account for the observed mGluR subtype differences in Ca2+ and GFP-PKCβII oscillation frequencies. Spontaneous oscillations in intracellular Ca2+concentrations play a critical role in neuronal development (21Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 268: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar, 22Katz L.C. Shatz C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (2376) Google Scholar). Endogenous glutamate acting at Group I mGluRs is responsible for these spontaneous oscillations in the neocortex (6Flint A.C. Dammerman R.S. Kriegstein A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12144-12149Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Moreover, during long term potentiation in the hippocampus, the plasma membrane translocation of PKCγ is dependent upon mGluR activation (23Angenstein F. Riedel G. Reyman K.G. Staak S. Neuroscience. 1999; 93: 1289-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is essential to understand how oscillatory mGluR signaling patterns are decoded by downstream effector enzymes. In the present study, we find that mGluR-stimulated oscillations in intracellular Ca2+concentrations are faithfully recapitulated by the synchronous cytosol to plasma membrane translocation of PKCβII. The oscillatory patterning of the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and PKCβII activation by mGluRs is mediated by the repetitive activation of PLC, resulting in oscillations in InsP3 formation. The activation of Gq-mediated signaling by mGluR1a and mGluR5a occurs at distinct frequencies that are regulated by the identity of a single amino acid residue found within a conserved stretch of amino acids within the mGluR1/5 G protein-coupling domains. However, the spatial-temporal dynamics of mGluR signaling does not involve PKC-mediated receptor phosphorylation because Ca2+ oscillations continue in the presence of PKC inhibitors that block PKCβII oscillations. Taken together, our data indicate that oscillatory mGluR signaling may represent a unique intrinsic receptor property. Two potential mechanisms have been proposed to explain the generation of base-line separated Ca2+ oscillations in response to GPCR activation. The receptor-controlled model of Ca2+oscillations suggests that Ca2+ oscillations arise in response to receptor-mediated oscillations in InsP3formation and require feedback receptor phosphorylation by PKC (24Woods N.M. Cuthbertson K.S. Cobbold P.H. Nature. 1986; 319: 600-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release model of Ca2+ oscillations proposes that low levels of InsP3 stimulate local rises in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations that sensitize the InsP3receptor, giving rise to a Ca2+ spike. Subsequently, inhibition of InsP3 receptors at the higher concentrations of intracellular Ca2+ attained at the peak of the Ca2+ release limits the duration of the Ca2+spike (25Dupont G. Goldbeter A. Cell Calcium. 1993; 14: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Until now, mGluR-stimulated oscillations in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations have been best modeled by a receptor-controlled mechanism requiring cyclical mGluR phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events (3Kawabata S. Tsutsumi R. Kohara A. Yamaguchi T. Nakanishi S. Okada M. Nature. 1996; 383: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 4Kawabata S. Kohara A. Tsutsumi R. Itahana H. Hatashibe S. Yamaguchi T. Okada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17381-17385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In particular, rapid mGluR5a-mediated Ca2+ oscillations are proposed to involve the phosphorylation of a threonine residue at position 840 that forms a PKC phosphorylation consensus site that is not conserved in mGluR1a (3Kawabata S. Tsutsumi R. Kohara A. Yamaguchi T. Nakanishi S. Okada M. Nature. 1996; 383: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In contrast to the above models, we find that mGluR-stimulated Ca2+ oscillations do not require feedback PKC phosphorylation. This conclusion is based on three lines of experimental evidence. First, the mutation of putative PKC phosphorylation consensus sites localized within the intracellular domains of mGluR1a does not prevent mGluR1a-stimulated oscillations in PKC distribution. Second, the treatment of HEK 293 cells with protein kinase C inhibitors results in the accumulation of PKC at the plasma membrane without blocking concomitant Ca2+ oscillations in the same cells. Third, the reconstitution of a PKC phosphorylation consensus site in mGluR1a at position 854 is not required to establish a mGluR5a-like oscillation frequency. Taken together, these observations do not support the feedback phosphorylation component of the receptor-controlled model of mGluR-stimulated Ca2+oscillations. Furthermore, the observation that mGluR stimulation evokes receptor subtype-specific repetitive activation of PLC also argues against a Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release model for mGluR-mediated Ca2+ oscillations. We propose a model of oscillatory mGluR signaling that is independent of PKC-mediated feedback receptor phosphorylation but that is dependent upon the repetitive coupling of mGluRs to G proteins leading to oscillations in InsP3 formation, release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, and PKC activation (Fig.9). In support of this model, we find that mGluR-stimulated InsP3 formation mirrors mGluR subtype-specific PKC oscillation frequencies. Furthermore, the identity of a single amino acid residue within the highly conserved G protein-coupling domain of Group I mGluRs regulates the frequency of PLC activity, Ca2+ release, and PKC activation. The oscillation frequency is dependent upon the nature of the amino acid residue found at either position 854 of mGluR1a or 840 of mGluR5a. Alanine and threonine residues at the corresponding positions in mGluR1a and mGluR5a support rapid mGluR-stimulated oscillations, whereas a charged aspartic acid residue reduces the frequency of mGluR/G protein coupling. Therefore, the localization of an aspartic acid residue at position 854 of mGluR1a antagonizes and/or slows mGluR1a coupling to G proteins. We propose that the observed differences in the oscillatory coupling of mGluR1a and mGluR5a represent intrinsic differences in the rate at which mGluR1a and mGluR5a recouple to the Gq-dependent activation of PLC. However, we cannot definitively exclude the possibility that either 1) Ca2+ feedback regulation of the InsP3receptor contributes in part to the basal rate of mGluR-stimulated Ca2+ oscillations or 2) differences in the rate of coupling are determined by observed differences in mGluR1a and mGluR5a sensitivity to extracellular Ca2+. Several studies have reported the cytosol to plasma membrane translocation of GFP-tagged conventional PKC isoforms in response to GPCR activation (13Feng X. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Meyer T. Caron M.G.

The presumption has been that the inactivation phase of PKCβII redistribution from the plasma membrane back into the cytosol is associated with receptor desensitization (13Feng X. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10755-10762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, our data show that the inactivation of mGluR-stimulated PKCβII plasma membrane localization does not appear to be associated with PKCβII-mediated receptor phosphorylation. Furthermore, the translocation of PKCβII back into the cytosol occurs subsequent to the return of intracellular Ca2+ concentrations to basal levels (Fig. 2 C). Also, we find that the treatment of cells with PKC inhibitors following the initiation of mGluR-stimulated oscillations in Ca2+ and PKCβII results in the plasma membrane accumulation of PKCβII rather than the redistribution of the enzyme back into the cytosol. These observations are consistent with recent data showing that the autophosphorylation of threonine residue 641 and serine residue 660 is not only important for the activation of PKCβII but is also required for the dissociation of the activated kinase from the plasma membrane (28Feng X. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26870-26874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 29Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations indicate that the decoding of mGluR-stimulated Ca2+ oscillations also involves PKC autophosphorylation. In conclusion, the temporal regulation of Ca2+ signaling represents a universal mechanism exploited by both excitable and non-excitable cells to regulate specific cellular responses. Ca2+ oscillations in response to mGluR activation are observed in immature neuronal cultures and developing neocortex (6Flint A.C. Dammerman R.S. Kriegstein A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12144-12149Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). During neuronal development, Ca2+ spikes regulate neurotransmitter and channel expression, neuronal differentiation of the neural crest, the extension and path finding of growth cones, and synapse formation and elimination (30Spitzer N.C.

Yanagihara D. Nakao K. Shigemoto R. Katsuki M. Aiba A. Science. 2000; 288: 1832-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). These developmental events are regulated, at least in part, by the activation of Group I mGluRs (6Flint A.C. Dammerman R.S. Kriegstein A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12144-12149Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 33Ichise T. Kano M. Hashimoto K. Yanagihara D. Nakao K. Shigemoto R. Katsuki M. Aiba A.

In the mature brain, repetitive mGluR-stimulated increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations may contribute to increases in neuronal excitability associated with memory and learning. In particular, mGluR-stimulated increases in intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations and PKC activation are implicated in long term depression in the cerebellum (35Hansel C. Linden D.J. Neuron. 2000; 26: 473-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In the hippocampus, Group I mGluR activation is required for the transient translocation of PKCγ during long term potentiation (24Woods N.M. Cuthbertson K.S. Cobbold P.H. Nature. 1986; 319: 600-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Furthermore, long term potentiation is substantially reduced in both PKCγ and mGluR1 knockout mice (36Abeliovich A. Chen C. Goda Y. Silva A.J. Stevens C.F. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1993; 75: 1253-1262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 37Aiba A. Chen C. Herrup K. Rosenmund C. Stevens C.F. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1994; 79: 365-375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Consequently, the delineation of the molecular mechanisms by which Ca2+ oscillations are decoded in both a receptor subtype- and effector isoform-specific manner will be essential for understanding the role of mGluR signaling during development and in the adult brain. Because PKCα and PKCγ isoforms are also activated in a Ca2+-dependent manner, it is likely that the oscillatory regulation of these PKC isoforms will also contribute to mGluR1a modulation of neuronal activity during neuronal development and in the adult brain. It will also be of interest to determine whether novel and atypical PKC isoforms are activated and oscillate in response to mGluR activation.

The ability of NO− to cause oxidations and of SOD to inhibit such oxidations was therefore explored. The decomposition of Angeli's salt (AS) produces NO− and that in turn caused the aerobic oxidation of NADPH, directly or indirectly. O⨪2 was produced concomitant with the aerobic oxidation of NADPH by AS, as evidenced by the SOD-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c. Both Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD inhibited the aerobic oxidation of NADPH by AS, but the amounts required were ∼100-fold greater than those needed to inhibit the reduction of cytochrome c. This inhibition was not due to a nonspecific protein effect or to an effect of those large amounts of the SODs on the rate of decomposition of AS. NO− caused the reduction of the Cu(II) of Cu,Zn-SOD, and in the presence of O⨪2, SOD could catalyze the oxidation of NO− to NO. The reverse reaction, i.e. the reduction of NO to NO− by Cu(I),Zn-SOD, followed by the reaction of NO− with O2 would yield ONOO− and that could explain the oxidation of dichlorofluorescin (DCF) by Cu(I),Zn-SOD plus NO.

The biological significance of these latter activities remain to be solidified, but interest in them is increased by the finding that point mutations in Cu,Zn-SOD, most of which do not effect the SOD activity, have been associated with ∼20% of the cases of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS) (10Okado-Matsmoto A.

We will now present data supporting the ability of SODs to catalyze the oxidation of NO−, utilizing O⨪2 as the oxidant; and of Cu,Zn-SOD to catalyze the HCO3−-dependent oxidation of DCF by H2O2. These findings could provide an alternative explanation for the observations of Estevez et al. (12Estevez A.G. Crow J.P. Sampson J.B. Reiter L. Zhuang Y. Richardson G.J. Tarpey M.M. Barbeito L. Beckman J.S. Science. 1999; 286: 2498-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). These findings will also shed ambiguity on the use of DCF oxidation as a measure of intracellular H2O2 and ONOO− production, in agreement with Rota et al. (13Rota C. Chignel C.F. Mason R.P.

Since DCF was oxidized by aerobic ascorbate + Cu(II)-SOD + NO, and is known to be oxidized by ONOO−, but not by NO, O⨪2, or H2O2, they proposed that the Cu(I) enzyme was reducing O2 to O⨪2, that then reacted with NO to give ONOO−. This mechanism had special significance in view of reports that the FALS-associated mutant Cu,Zn-SODs exhibit lowered affinity for Zn(II) (14Crow J.P. Sampson J.C. Zhuang Y. Thompson J.A.

The ONOO− thus produced would oxidize DCF. That reduced SODs can act as univalent reductants for NO was shown by Murphy and Sies (6Murphy M.E. Sies H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

An alkaline stock solution of AS, when diluted into neutral buffer to 0.175 mm, decomposed at an initial rate of 9 μm/min as shown byline 1 in Fig. 1. When 100 μm NADPH was present it was oxidized by the AS at a rate of 5 μm/min (line 2). Thus the ratio of AS decomposed to NADPH oxidized was almost 2:1, in agreement with earlier reports (22Reif A.

Since AS decomposition is known to be a source of NO− (7Fukuto J.M. Hobbs A.J. Ignarro J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 18Miranda K.M.

Acta. 1999; 1411: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), it appears that NO−, or a species derived therefrom, under aerobic conditions, probably ONOO−, oxidizes NADPH. Both Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD were able to inhibit the oxidation of NADPH by NO− as shown in Fig.2 and in agreement with Reif et al. (22Reif A. Zecca L. Riederer P. Feelisch M. Schmidt H.H.H.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This was not due to an effect on the rate of decomposition of AS, which was not influenced by Cu,Zn-SOD (not shown). Moreover it was not due to a nonspecific protein effect, since comparable levels of serum albumin caused only a small and transient effect (Fig. 3) that was probably due to the consumption of NO− by oxidation of albumin cysteine and methionine residues. Thus GSH was also able to inhibit the oxidation of NADPH by NO− in a way that suggested consumption of the GSH (Fig. 4).Figure 2SODs prevent the oxidation of NADPH by AS. The conditions were the same as described in the legend to Fig. 1.

An interesting possibility is that NO− can reduce the redox-active metals (Cu(II) or Mn(III)) of the SODs and that O⨪2 then reoxidizes these metal centers, thus providing for catalytic consumption of NO−. The reactions envisioned are as follows.Me(n)+NO−⇄Me(n−1)+NOREACTION 1 Me(n−1)+O⨪2+2H+⇄Me(n)+H2O2REACTION 2 Exploration of this possibility required demonstration that NO− could reduce the redox-active metals at the active sites of the SODs and that O⨪2 was produced during the oxidation of NADPH by NO−. Addition of AS to 0.2 mm to a buffered solution of 4 mg/ml of Cu,Zn-SOD resulted in bleaching of the enzyme (Fig. 5). That this bleaching was due to reduction of the Cu(II) to Cu(I) was shown by the ability of ferricyanide to restore the lost absorbance. Catalase did not prevent the reduction of Cu,Zn-SOD by NO− (not shown). Thus H2O2 was not involved. This attests to the reality of Reaction 1. The less than complete bleaching shown in Fig. 5 probably was due to our stopping the process after 30 min or to limitation in the amount of AS. Production during the Oxidation of NADPH by NO−—When AS (0.175 mm) was oxidizing aerobic 0.1 mm NADPH, in the presence of 10 or 40 μmcytochrome c, reduction of the cytochrome c was seen (Fig. 6), and this could be inhibited by very low levels of Cu,Zn-SOD. It should be noted that the low levels of Cu,Zn-SOD, that were sufficient to compete with cytochrome c for O⨪2, were unable to detectably inhibit NADPH oxidation by NO−. Thus O⨪2 was produced during the oxidation of NADPH and that O⨪2 could drive Reaction 2. A likely source of that O⨪2 would be the oxidation of NADPH to NADP⋅ by NO−, followed by the autoxidation of NADP⋅ to NADP+. There was no reduction of cytochrome c by aerobic AS in the absence of NADPH. The oxidation of DCF to its fluorescent product has been widely used as a measure of intracellular production of H2O2 (11Ahmed M.S. Hung W.Y. Zu J.S. Hockberger P. Siddique T. J. Neurol. Sci. 2000; 176: 88-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 13Rota C. Chignel C.F. Mason R.P. Free Radic Biol.

Med. 1999; 27: 873-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Nevertheless increased DCF oxidation as a consequence of the overproduction of normal Cu,Zn-SOD, or of the FALS-associated mutants, thereof, have been so interpreted (11Ahmed M.S. Hung W.Y. Zu J.S. Hockberger P. Siddique T. J. Neurol. Sci. 2000; 176: 88-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar,25Ying W. Anderson C.M. Chen Y. Stein B.A. Fahlman C.S. Copin J.C. Chan P.H. Swanson R.A. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2000; 20: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We now present data that should decrease enthusiasm for this use of DCF. Thus Fig. 7 demonstrates that DCF is not oxidized by H2O2 per se but is oxidized by Cu,Zn-SOD plus H2O2 and that HCO3− markedly stimulates this oxidation. HCO3−-dependent peroxidations catalyzed by Cu,Zn-SOD have been reported previously (3Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Free Radic. Biol.

Fridovich I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 1444-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 28Zhang H. Joseph J. Felix C. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14038-14045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Thus the data in Fig. 7 indicates that increased oxidation of DCF within cells could signal increased oxidation of HCO3− by Cu,Zn-SOD plus H2O2due to increased Cu,Zn-SOD, or due to increased H2O2, or to increased peroxidase activities of the FALS-associated, or of the Zn-depleted, enzymes. DCF can also be oxidized by ascorbate + SOD + a source of NO under aerobic conditions (12Estevez A.G. Crow J.P. Sampson J.B. Reiter L. Zhuang Y. Richardson G.J. Tarpey M.M. Barbeito L. Beckman J.S.

Catalase at 260 units/ml had no significant effect, in the presence or absence of SOD. When 10 μm DCF was exposed to 50 μm AS in an argon-purged buffer, a slow and rapidly decreasing rate of DCF oxidation was seen. Subsequent aeration increased this rate dramatically (line 2). Dihydrorhodamine has similarly been seen to be oxidized by AS in an oxygen-dependent manner (18Miranda K.M. Espey M.G. Yamada K. Krishna M. Ludwick N. Kim S.M. Jourd'heuil D. Grisham M.B. Feelisch M.

It appears that NO− + O2 yields an oxidant capable of rapid oxidation of DCF or DHR. We assume that this oxidant is ONOO− or something derived from it. It has been shown that NO− produced by reduction of NO by Cu(I),Zn-SOD is in the triplet ground state (9Kim W.-K. Choi Y.-B. Rayudu P.V. Das P. Asaad W. Arnelle D.R. Stamler J.S. Lipton S.A. Neuron. 1999; 24: 461-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), which is known to most readily react with triplet ground state O2 yielding ONOO− (24Hughes M.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar,29Jay-Gerin J.-P. Ferradini C. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It should be noted that Miranda et al. (18Miranda K.M. Espey M.G. Yamada K. Krishna M. Ludwick N. Kim S.M. Jourd'heuil D. Grisham M.B. Feelisch M. Fukuto J.M. Wink D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1720-1727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) proposed that the product of the AS-generated NO− + O2reaction is somehow different from ONOO−. That could be an isomeric form of ONOO− produced by the reaction of singlet NO− with O2. However, when NO− is produced biologically, as in the measurements of Estevez et al. (12Estevez A.G. Crow J.P. Sampson J.B. Reiter L. Zhuang Y. Richardson G.J. Tarpey M.M. Barbeito L. Beckman J.S. Science. 1999; 286: 2498-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), it would be triplet NO−, and this would yield ONOO-, per se, when reacting with O2. In any case ONOO−, or the similar product proposed by Miranda et al. (18Miranda K.M. Espey M.G. Yamada K. Krishna M. Ludwick N. Kim S.M. Jourd'heuil D. Grisham M.B. Feelisch M. Fukuto J.M. Wink D.A.

The sum of Reactions 1 plus 2 is as follows.NO−+O⨪2+2H+⇄NO+H2O2REACTION 3 In essence this is an expression of the superoxide reductase activity (5Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38482-38485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) of Cu,Zn-SOD and is in accord with Murphy and Sies (6Murphy M.E. Sies H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10860-10864Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). It should be noted that Cu,Zn-SOD was not inactivated by incubation with 0.25 mm AS for 50 min (not shown). NO−/HNO can oxidize NADPH anaerobically as well as aerobically (22Reif A. Zecca L. Riederer P. Feelisch M. Schmidt H.H.H.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 23Wink D.A. Feelisch M. Fukuto J. Christodoulou D. Jourd'heuil D. Grisham M.B. Vodovotz Y. Cook J.A. Krishna M. DeGraff W.G. Kim S.M. Gamson J. Mitchell J.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 351: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The anaerobic reaction presumably involves the divalent oxidation of NADPH and the concomitant reduction of HNO to NH2OH, while the aerobic reaction could additionally be due to univalent oxidation of NADPH by ONOO− formed from the rapid reaction of NO− with O2 (24Hughes M.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 29Jay-Gerin J.-P. Ferradini C. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). There are reasons for believing that nitric-oxide synthase can produce both NO− and O⨪2, particularly when tetrahydrobiopterin is limiting (30Stuehr D. Pou S. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14533-14536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 31Adak S. Wang Q. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 26736-26742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and the observation that Cu,Zn-SOD increases the yield of NO produced per NADPH consumed could be partially explained by the superoxide reductase activity of Cu,Zn-SOD as expressed in Reaction 3. Nitric-oxide synthase plus NADPH and l-arginine produces more O⨪2 in the absence of tetrahydrobiopterin (32Vasquez-Vivar J. Hogg N. Martasek P. Karoui H. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26736-26742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). That can partially be explained on the basis of NO− production. Thus the NO− plus O2 would yield ONOO−, which would oxidize NADPH to NADP⋅, and that in turn would reduce O2 to O⨪2. Hence the stoichiometry of NADPH consumed per NO produced, by nitric-oxide synthase, could be influenced by SOD both on the basis of the oxidation of NO− to NO and by the prevention of the nonenzymic oxidation of NADPH by NO−/ONOO−, in agreement with Reif et al. (22Reif A. Zecca L. Riederer P. Feelisch M. Schmidt H.H.H.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It has been suggested by Stoyanovsky et al. (33Stoyanovsky D. Clancy R. Cederbaum A.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 5093-5094Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar) that HNO can dimerize and then decompose to N2 + 2HO⋅. If this were the case under our conditions, then NADPH oxidation should have been appreciably due to HO⋅ and should have been noticeably inhibited by an HO⋅ scavenger such as ethanol. However ethanol, added to 2% of the reaction volume, did not at all inhibit the oxidation of NADPH by NO− (not shown). Having previously noted that the oxyethyl radical does not oxidize NADPH (34Liochev S. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 291: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) we can now exclude HO⋅ from having a role in the oxidation NADPH by NO− under our conditions. It should be noted that Stoyanovsky et al. (33Stoyanovsky D. Clancy R. Cederbaum A.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 5093-5094Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar), using spin trapping, observed maximal HO⋅ production from HNO at pH 5, but very little at neutrality, while we worked at pH 7.4. The reduction of the Cu(II) at the active site of Cu,Zn-SOD by NO− is viewed as a reversible reaction, in accord with Murphy and Sies (6Murphy M.E. Sies H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10860-10864Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). That being said, the observation of Estevezet al. (12Estevez A.G. Crow J.P. Sampson J.B. Reiter L. Zhuang Y. Richardson G.J. Tarpey M.M. Barbeito L. Beckman J.S. Science. 1999; 286: 2498-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) might now be explained in terms of the reduction of NO to NO− by the ascorbate-reduced Cu-SOD, rather than by the reduction of O2 to O⨪2. The NO−, thus produced, would lead to formation of ONOO− that would account for the oxygen-dependent DCF oxidation that they observed. Another possible explanation is based on the observations of McBride et al. (16McBride A.G. Boritaite V. Brown G.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1454: 275-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) who suggested that O⨪2, derived from the oxidation of H2O2 by the Cu(II) of Cu,Zn-SOD, might then react with NO, yielding ONOO− that could oxidize DHR. In the work of Estevez et al. (12Estevez A.G. Crow J.P. Sampson J.B. Reiter L. Zhuang Y. Richardson G.J. Tarpey M.M. Barbeito L. Beckman J.S. Science. 1999; 286: 2498-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) the autoxidation of ascorbyl radical is another possible source of O⨪2, and that, in the presence of NO, would yield ONOO−. The differences in reactivity between singlet and triplet NO− adds complexity to the data presented herein and to that in the literature (8Fukuto J.M. Wink D.A. Sigel A. Sigel H.

Thus GSH may be oxidized by1NO− and not by 3NO−(9Kim W.-K. Choi Y.-B. Rayudu P.V. Das P. Asaad W. Arnelle D.R. Stamler J.S. Lipton S.A. Neuron. 1999; 24: 461-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Hence if the biologically generated NO− is in the triplet state then GSH might not be as effective a scavenger of NO− as proposed by Miranda et al. (18Miranda K.M. Espey M.G. Yamada K. Krishna M. Ludwick N. Kim S.M. Jourd'heuil D. Grisham M.B. Feelisch M. Fukuto J.M. Wink D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1720-1727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The oxidations of NADH and of DCF could have been due to NO−or to ONOO− derived therefrom. NO− is a small anion, akin to O⨪2, and should readily gain access to the active site of SOD, but the possibility of SOD reacting with ONOO−cannot be excluded. If the effect of SOD was mainly due to reaction with NO−, we can now attempt to estimate the rate constant for that interaction. The NO− produced by the decomposition of AS is said to be 1NO−(18Miranda K.M. Espey M.G. Yamada K. Krishna M. Ludwick N. Kim S.M. Jourd'heuil D. Grisham M.B. Feelisch M. Fukuto J.M. Wink D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1720-1727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), which can relax to 3NO− and that, in turn, reacts with 3O2 to yield ONOO−. We have seen that ∼2 × 10−6m SOD 50% inhibited the oxidation of NADPH, or of DCF, by AS. Suppose that SOD only reacts with 1NO− and not with 3NO−. Then 2 × 10−6 SOD must halve the [1NO−] in competition with its conversion to 3NO−, plus its reactions with all targets for 1NO−attack. If there are no scavengers for 1NO−, or if we disregard them, we will get a minimal estimate for the rate constant and we can write: k 1 [SOD] [1NO−] = k 2[1NO−], where k 1 is the rate constant for the oxidation of 1NO− by SOD, and k 2 is the rate of relaxation of1NO− to 3NO−, thenk 1 [SOD] = k 2. The rate constant for the relaxation of 1NO− is not known, but we can assume that it is similar to that for the relaxation of 1O2, which is of the order of 2 × 105 s−1 (35Wilkinson F. Helman W.P. Ross A.B. J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data. 1995; 24: 663-1021Crossref Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). Then k 1 = 1011m−1 s−1. This is unrealistically fast and might suggest that the relaxation of1NO− is slower than that of1O2. But even if k 2 was 2 × 103 s−1 the value of k1would be 109m−1 s−1and that is comparable with the rate constant for the reaction of O⨪2 with SOD. Now suppose that SOD reacts with 3NO− and not with 1NO−. In that case the SOD would be competing with the reaction of 3NO− with O2 and any other scavengers for3NO−. If we again ignore reactions with other targets we can write: k 1[SOD][3NO−] = k 2[3NO−][3O2] ork 1 [SOD] = k 2[3O2]. [SOD] is 2 × 10−6m and [3O2] in aqueous solutions equilibrated with air is ∼2 × 10−4m. Two values have been reported for k 2 and these are 4 × 107m−1 s−1 (29Jay-Gerin J.-P. Ferradini C. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and 7 × 107m−1s−1 (24Hughes M.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). If we take the lower value we getk 1 = 4 × 109m−1 s−1, and this is again a minimal estimate. Thus whether SOD reacts with1NO− or 3NO−, or both, its rate constant must be very high to account for its observed ability to inhibit the oxidations caused by NO−. Whether this has relevance in the biological milieu is not yet known. There is uncertainty in the literature concerning the pK a, redox potential, and even the spin state of NO− in aqueous solution. That being the case we must explain repeatable observations as best we can and hope that, in time, the physical chemistry and theoretical treatments of this fascinating molecule will yield certain results, which in turn, will lead to refinements of those currently reasonable explanations. It should be noted that we were not necessarily dealing with free NO/NO− but rather with these species at the active site of SOD, and binding may substantially change their physicochemical character. Thus the interaction of NO with reduced SOD could give rise to a bound nitroxyl, which can be represented by the following equilibrium: Enz-Cu(I)NO ⇄ Enz-Cu(II)NO− (where Enz indicates enzyme) and which could react with O2yielding ONOO− that could diffuse into the bulk solvent and there oxidize DCF or DHR. A similar scenario applies to the results of Sharpe and Cooper (36Sharpe M.A. Cooper C.E. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) who reported that aerobic ferrocytochromec plus NO oxidized DHR. This recalls the proposal made by Estevez et al. (12Estevez A.G.

Science. 1999; 286: 2498-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) with respect to the putative bound O⨪2 made by the autoxidation of Cu(I)-SOD. The oxidation of NAD(P)H by ONOO−, with subsequent production of O2− by autoxidation of NAD(P)⋅, has been described by Kirsch and de Groot (37Kirsch M. de Groot H. J. Biol.

Cell Res. 2000; 256: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Regardless of the nature of the stimulus, the commitment to apoptosis occurs as a result of the activation of members of the caspase family of cysteine proteases (5Cohen G. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4123) Google Scholar). These enzymes are present in cells as inactive precursors that are proteolytically activated on induction of apoptosis. At least 14 members of the caspase family have been identified to date, all of which require an aspartic acid residue at the cleavage sites of their substrates (5Cohen G. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4123) Google Scholar, 6Song Z. Steller H. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: M49-M52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These proteases can be divided into two major groups: initiator and executor caspases. The initiator caspases are responsible for converting the external death signal into an internal signal with the participation of death receptor-associated molecules and mitochondria. Once activated, the initiator caspases trigger the activation of the executor caspases, such as caspase-3, -6, and -7, which, in turn, results in the destruction of cellular components required for maintenance of structural and functional integrity. This destruction of cellular components leads to the phenotypic changes characteristic of apoptosis, including membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation, and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. DNA fragmentation is thought to be an important step in the disposal of genomic DNA from dying cells. Concomitant with cleavage of nuclear lamin, DNA is degraded into large fragments of 50–300 kb, which are then processed into internucleosomal repeats of ∼200 base pairs that are responsible for generation of the characteristic ladder pattern apparent on electrophoresis (7Cohen G.M. Sun X.M. Fearnhead M. MacFarlane M. Brown D.G. Snowden R.T. Dinsdale D. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 507-516PubMed Google Scholar). The initial cleavage of DNA into ∼50-kb fragments is thought to be required for subsequent DNA fragmentation (7Cohen G.M. Sun X.M. Fearnhead M. MacFarlane M. Brown D.G. Snowden R.T. Dinsdale D. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 507-516PubMed Google Scholar, 8Neamati N. Fernandez A. Wright S. Kiefer J. McConkey D.J. J.

Several endonucleases have been implicated in the DNA fragmentation process (4Nagata S. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 9Robertson J.D. Orrenius S.

For example, we recently described the cloning and expression of a human Ca2+- and Mg2+-dependent endonuclease, termed DNAS1L3 and its regulation by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (10Yakovlev A.G. Wang G.

DNA fragmentation factor (DFF), also known as caspase-activated DNase (CAD) or caspase-activated nuclease (CPAN), has also been suggested to contribute to this process (4Nagata S. Exp.

DFF is composed of two subunits of 40 and 45 kDa termed DFF40 (CAD) and DFF45 (ICAD), respectively (12Liu X. Li P. Widlak P. Zou H. Luo X. Garrard W. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The endonuclease activity of this enzyme, which is intrinsic to DFF40, is induced on cleavage of DFF45 by caspase-3. DFF45 functions as both an inhibitor of DFF40 activity and as a chaperone for this subunit, given that it is required for DFF40 expression (13Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A.

Both DFF45-deficient (DFF45−/−) mice and thymocytes isolated from these animals exhibit resistance to apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli (16Zhang J. Wang X. Bove K.E. Xu M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37450-37454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The lack of DFF45 is associated with a reduced extent of chromatin condensation and the absence of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in thymocytes (16Zhang J. Wang X. Bove K.E. Xu M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37450-37454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). DFF has been implicated in the fragmentation of DNA into 50-kb pieces during apoptosis in part on the basis of the observation that expression of a caspase-3-resistant DFF45 mutant prevented the generation of such DNA fragments in Jurkat cells exposed to staurosporine (17Sakahira H. Enari M. Ohsawa Y. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 543-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). More recently, a role for DFF in the processing of genomic DNA into 50-kb fragments was further demonstrated using thymocytes derived from DFF45−/− mice (18Zhang J. Lee H. Lou D.W. Bovin G.P. Xu M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The introduction of breaks into DNA molecules, including those generated by the production of 50-kb and internucleosomal DNA fragments, results in the activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), which has an absolute requirement for binding to the ends of DNA strands for activity. As a result of the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of nuclear proteins and automodification of PARP itself, the activation of this enzyme results in a marked decrease in the intracellular concentrations of NAD and ATP, creating an energy crisis that is thought to contribute to acceleration of the death process (19Pieper A.A. Verma A. Zhang J. Snyder S.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 171-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). We have now investigated the roles of DNA fragmentation into 50-kb pieces and PARP activation in the death process by examining the relation of these events to the resistance of DFF45−/−cells to apoptosis. We show that DFF45−/− fibroblasts lack the ability to generate 50-kb DNA fragments in response to TNF. The absence of such DNA fragmentation protected the cells from excessive activation of PARP and thereby prevented depletion of intracellular NAD. The delay apparent in PARP activation correlated with delays both in caspase-3 activation and in proapoptotic mitochondrial events, including loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of cytochromec. We propose that the generation of 50-kb DNA fragments by DFF is not merely a passive step in DNA degradation but rather, together with PARP, mitochondria, and caspase-3, contributes to an amplification phase of apoptosis. Mice homozygous for DFF45 gene disruption were kindly provided by M. Xu (University of Cincinnati) through A. Faden (Georgetown University). For isolation of thymocytes, thymi from adult DFF45−/− and control (wild-type) mice were removed aseptically, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then passed through a wire screen to produce a single-cell suspension. The thymocytes were separated by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and a mixture of penicillin and streptomycin. The cells were cultured in the same medium and immediately used for experiments. They were treated with TNF (10 ng/ml) in RPMI 1640 with serum. Primary fibroblasts were prepared from adult control or DFF45−/− mice according to standard protocols. They were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin and were used for experiments after several passages. PARP−/− and PARP+/+ fibroblasts, kindly provided by Dr. Z. Q. Wang by way of Dr. S. Snyder, were maintained as described for DFF45−/− and DFF45+/+ fibroblasts. Fibroblasts were treated with a combination of TNF (10 ng/ml) and cycloheximide (1 μg/ml) or, as indicated, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with serum. Transient transfection of a luciferase reporter plasmid under the control of a promoter containing several repeats of the consensus sequence for NF-κB DNA binding, kindly provided by Dr. Giardina (University of Connecticut), was performed using MIRUSTransIT-LT1 (Panvera, Madison, WI) according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Luciferase assays were performed using the standard luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) and normalized using pSV2-CAT plasmid. After treatment with TNF, cells cultured in 24-well plates were washed with Locke's solution (154 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 3.6 mmNaHCO3, 2.3 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 5 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4)) and then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with the same solution containing 2.5 μmcalcein-AM (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Fluorescence resulting from the deesterification of calcein-AM was monitored with a CytoFluor 4000 fluorometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 488 and 520 nm, respectively. DNA was isolated from cells as previously described (20Boulares H. Yakovlev A. Ivanova I. Stoica B.A. Wang G. Iyer S. Smulson M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22932-22940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar) and subjected to electrophoresis through 1.5% agarose gels in Tris borate-EDTA buffer. The gels were stained with ethidium bromide. Transverse alternating field electrophoresis was performed essentially as described (20Boulares H. Yakovlev A. Ivanova I. Stoica B.A. Wang G. Iyer S. Smulson M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22932-22940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed as described (20Boulares H. Yakovlev A. Ivanova I. Stoica B.A. Wang G. Iyer S. Smulson M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22932-22940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). A portion (30 μg of protein) of each lysate was fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 4–20% gradient gel, and the separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose filter. The filter was stained with Ponceau S to confirm equal loading and transfer of samples and was then probed with antibodies to DFF45 (Biovision, Palo Alto, CA), to DFF40 (kindly provided by X. Wang, University of Texas), to poly(ADP-ribose) (10H-A) (20Boulares H. Yakovlev A. Ivanova I. Stoica B.A. Wang G. Iyer S. Smulson M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22932-22940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar), or to PARP (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). Immune complexes were detected with appropriate secondary antibodies and chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce). Nuclear extracts were prepared, and EMSA analysis of DNA binding activity was performed as described previously (21Boulares A.H. Ferran M.C. Lucas-Lenard J. Virology. 1996; 218: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The NF-κB binding oligonucleotide (Promega, Madison, WI) was end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase using [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Caspase-3 activity was measured essentially as described (20Boulares H. Yakovlev A. Ivanova I. Stoica B.A. Wang G. Iyer S. Smulson M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22932-22940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). In brief, cell extracts (25 μg of protein) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 40 μmDEVD-aminomethylcoumarin (AMC) peptide substrate in a total volume of 200 μl. The fluorescence of free AMC, generated as a result of cleavage of the aspartate-AMC bond, was monitored continuously over 30 min with a CytoFluor 4000 fluorometer at excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 and 460 nm, respectively. The emission from each well was plotted against time, and linear regression analysis of the initial velocity (slope) for each curve yielded the activity. After treatment with TNF, cells cultured in six-well dishes at a density of 1.0 × 106 cells/well were scraped into the culture medium, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and then extracted with 0.5 ml of ice-cold 0.5 m perchloric acid. After the addition of 0.47 ml of a solution prepared from 1 m KOH, 0.33 mK2HPO4, and 0.33 mKH2PO4 to adjust the pH of the extract to 7.3, cell debris and salt precipitates were removed by centrifugation. The amount of NAD in the resulting supernatant was determined with an enzymatic cycling assay as described (22Jacobson E. Jacobson M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 280: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Cells were collected, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, suspended in 5 volumes of a hypotonic buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm 4-(aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin (20 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), 250 mm sucrose), and incubated for 15 min on ice. They were then homogenized by 15–20 passages through a 22-gauge needle. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The second (mitochondrial) pellet was suspended in the hypotonic buffer and then subjected to sonication with three 10-s pulses. Samples (15 μg of protein) of the mitochondrial and cytosolic (post-12,000 × g supernatant) fractions were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to cytochrome c (RDI, Flanders, NJ). Thirty minutes before collection by exposure to trypsin, cells were stained with 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1) (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), a cell-permeable dye that aggregates and generates red fluorescence in mitochondria with a high ψmito. This aggregation and consequent fluorescence of JC-1 dissipates as ψmito is lost. Fluorescence was analyzed with a Becton Dickinson fluorescence-activated cell sorting flow cytometer. Disruption of the DFF45 gene has recently been shown to block dexamethasone-induced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and cell death in isolated thymocytes as well as in vivo (16Zhang J. Wang X. Bove K.E. Xu M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37450-37454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of the apoptosis inducer TNF on internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in primary thymocytes isolated from DFF45−/− mice. Thymocytes isolated from control or DFF45−/− mice were exposed to TNF (10 ng/ml) for 12 h, after which DNA was extracted and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Whereas TNF induced marked internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in control thymocytes, it had no such effect in thymocytes from DFF45−/− mice (Fig.1A), suggesting that DFF45 is required for the processing of genomic DNA in response to apoptotic stimuli. Similar results were obtained when primary thymocytes or splenocytes from DFF45−/− mice were treated with the apoptosis inducers etoposide or staurosporine (data not shown) (23Yakovlev A.G. Di X. Movsesyan V. Mullins P.G. Wang J. Boulares H. Zhang J. Xu M. Faden A.I. Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 205-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the requirement for DFF45 is not stimulus- or cell type-specific. To investigate further the role of DFF-mediated DNA fragmentation in apoptosis, we isolated fibroblasts from DFF45−/− and control mice. We confirmed by immunoblot analysis that the primary fibroblasts from DFF45−/− mice lacked DFF45, whereas the DFF45+/+ fibroblasts expressed this protein at a level similar to that apparent in the human monocytic cell line, U937 (Fig. 1B). The abundance of DFF40 in DFF45−/− cells was also greatly reduced compared with that in DFF45+/+ cells, consistent with the chaperone function of DFF45 in DFF40 expression (14Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar, 15Liu X. Zou H. Widlak P. Garrard W. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13836-13840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). These results are also consistent with the abundance of these proteins in the brain of DFF45−/− and control mice (23Yakovlev A.G. Di X. Movsesyan V. Mullins P.G. Wang J. Boulares H. Zhang J. Xu M. Faden A.I. Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 205-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We then compared the effects of the combination of TNF (10 ng/ml) and cycloheximide (1 μg/ml) on the viability of DFF45−/− and control fibroblasts. The DFF45−/− fibroblasts exhibited a marked resistance to TNF-induced apoptosis compared with the sensitivity of control cells (Fig. 1C). To exclude the possibility that DFF45−/− cells are resistant to TNF-induced cell death as a result of a dysfunctional TNF receptor, we examined the ability of this cytokine to activate the transcription factor NF-κB, a known target of TNF signaling (24Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar, 25Cao Z. Tanaka M. Regnier C. Rothe M. Yamit-hezi A. Woronicz J.D. Fuentes M.E. Durnin M.H. Dalrymple S.A. Goeddel D.V. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1999; 64: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). DFF45−/− and control cells were treated with TNF for 30 min, after which nuclear extracts were prepared and assayed for NF-κB DNA binding activity by EMSA with an oligonucleotide probe containing a specific NF-κB binding site. No difference was apparent between DFF45−/− and control fibroblasts in their ability to activate NF-κB (Fig. 1D), indicating that TNF receptor is equally functional in both cell types. To further test TNF signaling, DFF45−/− and DFF45+/+ cells were transiently transfected with a reporter plasmid encoding for the luciferase gene under the control of a promoter containing several repeats of the consensus sequence for NF-κB DNA binding. Transfected cells were then treated with TNF in the absence of cycloheximide for 6 h, after which cell extracts were prepared and assayed for luciferase activity. No significant difference in luciferase activity was observed in TNF-treated DFF45−/− (2.3-fold) and DFF45+/+ (2-fold) cells when compared with their respective controls. Additionally, no difference was observed in the expression of the TNF receptor protein as assessed by immunoblot analysis using antibodies against mouse TNF-R1 (data not shown). The fragmentation of DNA into 50-kb pieces is thought to precede internucleosomal DNA degradation. DFF40 has been implicated in the cleavage of DNA into 50-kb DNA fragments in response to various apoptotic stimuli (17Sakahira H. Enari M. Ohsawa Y. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 543-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 18Zhang J. Lee H. Lou D.W. Bovin G.P. Xu M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of DFF45 deficiency on the generation of such DNA fragments in response to TNF. DFF45−/− and control fibroblasts were incubated with TNF and cycloheximide for various times, after which DNA was isolated and subjected to transverse alternating field electrophoresis. Whereas TNF induced the generation of 50-kb DNA fragments within 3 h in control cells, such DNA fragmentation was not detected in DFF45−/− fibroblasts even after 12 h (Fig.2A). These results suggested that the resistance of DFF45−/− cells to apoptosis might be due to a lack of cleavage of DNA into 50-kb fragments. Excessive DNA damage that is beyond repair is thought to constitute a signal for triggering of apoptosis (19Pieper A.A. Verma A. Zhang J. Snyder S.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 171-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 26Berger N.A. Radiat. Res. 1985; 101: 4-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts from a variety of species have been shown to lack the ability to undergo internucleosomal DNA fragmentation (4Nagata S. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 11Yakovlev A.G. Wang G. Stoica B.A. Boulares H.A. Spoonde A.Y. Yoshihara K. Smulson M.E. J. Biol.

Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar). Consistent with these previous observations, primary DFF45−/− and DFF45+/+ fibroblasts did not exhibit internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in response to TNF (Fig.2B). The lack of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in these cells provided us with a good model with which to examine the role of the cleavage of DNA into 50-kb fragments in TNF-induced apoptosis. Excessive DNA damage induces PARP activation, as manifested by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of nuclear proteins, including PARP itself, and a consequent depletion of NAD and of ATP (27Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Watkins T.A. Gill P.K. Reed J.L. Mendoza-Alvarez H. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 193: 19-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), from which NAD is derived by nuclear NAD synthetase. We therefore examined the effect of the lack of cleavage of DNA into 50-kb fragments in DFF45−/− fibroblasts on TNF-induced PARP activation and NAD depletion. Immunoblot analysis of cell extracts with antibodies to poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) revealed that TNF induced marked poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of PARP (the predominant target for this modification under these conditions) in control cells that was maximal after 3 h (Fig. 3A), a time at which cleavage of DNA into 50-kb fragments was apparent (Fig.2A). The extent of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of PARP had decreased by 6 h and was no longer apparent after 12 h. In contrast, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of PARP was not detected in DFF45−/− fibroblasts until 12 h after the initial exposure to TNF (Fig. 3A). To determine whether DFF45 deficiency affects the expression of PARP, we subjected the same cell lysates to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to PARP. The abundance of PARP was identical in both untreated cell types. Whereas the amount of PARP remained unchanged after exposure of DFF45−/− fibroblasts to TNF for 6 h, PARP was proteolytically processed to an 89-kDa polypeptide in control cells as early as 1 h after exposure to TNF, and this effect was more pronounced at 6 h (Fig. 3B). These results thus suggested that PARP cleavage might be related to the apparent decrease in the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of this protein in DFF45+/+ fibroblasts 6 h after exposure to TNF. We also examined the effect of TNF on the intracellular concentration of NAD in DFF45−/− and control fibroblasts. Whereas the intracellular abundance of NAD in DFF45+/+ cells decreased on exposure to TNF in a time-dependent manner, the amount of NAD in DFF45−/− cells was largely unaffected by treatment with this cytokine (Fig. 3C). These results are thus consistent with the kinetics of the generation of 50-kb DNA fragments, of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, and of the loss of cell viability in the two cell types. They suggest that DFF45 deficiency protects cells, at least temporarily, from apoptosis by preventing the depletion of intracellular NAD, an effect that is achieved by blocking DNA fragmentation and the consequent activation of PARP. Given that PARP was cleaved early during incubation of control fibroblasts with TNF and that cleavage of this enzyme during apoptosis is thought to be mediated by caspase-3 (13Enari M. Sakahira H.

Under nitrogen-deficient conditions, transcription of the stm1 gene was induced; deletion of stm1 was associated with early entry into G1 arrest. Under nutritionally sufficient conditions, overexpression of Stm1 inhibited vegetative cell growth, resulted in decreased intracellular cAMP levels, increased the expression of the meiosis-specific genes ste11, mei2, andmam2, and facilitated sexual development in homothallic cells. However inhibition of vegetative cell growth and reduction of cAMP levels were not observed in a deletion mutant of the heterotrimeric G protein Gα2 gene, gpa2, that is responsible for regulating intracellular cAMP levels, a key factor in determining the sexual development in S. pombe. Stm1 protein was shown to interact with Gpa2 through its C-terminal transmembrane domains 5–7. Mutation at Lys199 in the C-terminal domain (stm1K199A) abolished the Stm1 overexpression effect on lowering cAMP levels.

On the other hand small G proteins, including Ras, modulate effector elements in response to external signaling, which can influence cell growth and differentiation (9Barbacid M. Annu. Rev.

The interactions of different effectors with Ras can activate different downstream signaling pathways, including those that stimulate the cell division cycle, alter cell shape, or induce cellular differentiation (17Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1990; 348: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1832) Google Scholar). Thus signals emanating from the cell surface are delivered to diverse downstream effectors by switching G protein functions on and off. The integrated G protein signals are responsible for orchestrating a coherent specific biological response. Fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, possesses two genes encoding heterotrimeric G protein α-subunits,gpa1 and gpa2 (18Obara T. Nakafuku M. Yamamoto M. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gpa1 is responsible for pheromone-responsive sexual development, and Gpa2 relays the nutritional status information necessary to initiate the sexual differentiation of S. pombe. The Gβ subunit, Gpb1, functions as a negative factor in sexual development (20Kim D.U. Park S.K. Chung K.S. Choi M.U. Yoo H.S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 20-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Whereas only one ras gene, ras1+, has been identified in S. pombe, it is required for at least two distinct cellular functions: sexual differentiation, including conjugation and sporulation, and the control of cell morphology (21Chang E.C. Barr M. Wang Y. Jung V. Xu H-P. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1994; 79: 131-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Ras1 plays a major role in the initiation of meiotic differentiation when cells endure nutritionally unfavorable conditions (22Fukui Y. Kozasa T. Kaziro Y. Takeda T. Yamamoto M. Cell. 1986; 44: 329-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). UnlikeSaccharomyces cerevisiae, in which rasgenes are essential for cell growth and modulate adenylate cyclase activity (16Cantor S. Urano T. Feig L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4578-4584Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 23Cannon J.F. Gibbs J.B. Tatchell K. Genetics. 1986; 113: 247-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Fasano O. Kahn P. Graf T.

Cell. 1985; 40: 27-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar), S. pombe cells carrying a null mutation in the ras1 gene proliferate normally. These cells are deficient, however, in terms of sexual differentiation in that haploid cells are completely sterile and homozygous diploid cells have a very low frequency of sporulation. Mutated Ras1 does not affect the intracellular cAMP levels in S. pombe, indicating that Ras1 does not act primarily by modulating adenylate cyclase activity. Instead, when a mating pheromone binds to its serpentine receptor (Mam2 or Map3), Ras1 activates a mitogen-activated protein (MAP)1 kinase module composed of Byr2, Byr1, and Spk1 protein kinases in concert with a heterotrimeric G protein α-subunit, Gpa1 (18Obara T. Nakafuku M. Yamamoto M. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5877-5881Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 21Chang E.C. Barr M. Wang Y. Jung V. Xu H-P. Wigler M.H.

This leads to the initiation of conjugation and sporulation. However, the activation of MAP kinases by Ras1 should be preceded by cell cycle arrest at G1. It has been observed that in S. pombe, when the nitrogen source is depleted, cell growth is arrested at G1 first (30Fukui Y. Kaziro Y. Yamamoto M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1991-1993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Nardin-Davis S.A. Nasim A. Beach D. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2963-2971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Nardin-Davis S.A. Nasim A.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1391-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and then the heterotrimeric G protein α-subunit, Gpa2, which regulates adenylate cyclase in accordance with nutritional state of the cells (19Isshiki T. Mochizuki N. Maeda T Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2455-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), lowers the intracellular cAMP levels. This in turn triggers the induction of expression of genes such as mam2, ste11, andmei2, which are required in the initial stage of meiosis (22Fukui Y. Kozasa T. Kaziro Y. Takeda T. Yamamoto M. Cell. 1986; 44: 329-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Thus the decision to exit the cell cycle and initiate mating requires the integration of signal information concerning both the nutrient status and the presence of mating partners. Theras1+ gene is considered to be involved in integrating these two signals by increasing the sensitivity to pheromone in the appropriate pathways when nutrients are in short supply (22Fukui Y. Kozasa T. Kaziro Y. Takeda T. Yamamoto M. Cell. 1986; 44: 329-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, the link between the acceptance of the nutritional starvation signal and the activation of the differentiation cycle is poorly understood. In this report, we describe the isolation of the stm1 + gene encoding a putative seven-loop transmembrane protein, which may function as a receptor that couples with the heterotrimeric Gα2 protein, Gpa2. Our studies indicate that Stm1 can interact with Gpa2 through the C-terminal domain. This interaction may provide the initiating signal that links signals triggered by nutritional deficiency and pheromone-dependent sexual differentiation, to allow Ras1 to activate sexual differentiation in S. pombe. The S. pombestrains used in this study are listed in TableI. The newly isolated synthetic lethal mutant of ras1, KSC3, was derived from the KSC1 strain.S. pombe cells were grown in YEPD (0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% peptone, and 3% glucose), YES (0.5% yeast extract and 3% glucose with supplement), EMM (Edinburgh minimal medium) (34Gutz H. heslot H. Leupold U. Loprieno N. King R.C. Handbook of Genetics. Plenum, New York1974: 395-446Google Scholar), EMM2 (EMM without supplements, CLONTECH), and ME (0.3% malt extract) media supplemented with adenine, uracil, and/or leucine as described previously (35Chung K.S. Kim K.W. Yoo H.S. Mol. Cell. 1997; 7: 800-806Google Scholar, 36Chung K.S. Hoe K.L. Kim K.W. Yoo H.S. Gene. 1998; 210: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For detection of dead cells, phloxine B (Sigma) was added to the YES and EMM plates at a concentration of 20 mg/liter (37Jang Y.J. Chung K.S. Park C.K. Yoo H.S. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1358: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Prior to analyzing the effects of nitrogen starvation on transcript levels of the genes ofS. pombe, cells were grown in EMM overnight and resuspended at 107 cells/ml in EMM containing different nitrogen sources (0.5% NH4Cl, 0.5% proline, or no NH4Cl). For flow cytometry, cells were grown in EMM to log phase, harvested, washed, and then transferred to EMM devoid of a nitrogen source. Transformation of S. pombe cells was carried out using the lithium acetate method and standard yeast genetic techniques as described by Moreno et al. (38Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P.

Open table in a new tab To isolate a gene that may function in association with Ras1 in sexual differentiation ofS. pombe, we used a mutant, KSC3, that exhibits a lethal phenotype when the Ras1 function is absent. This synthetic lethal mutant of Ras1 was isolated by UV mutagenesis from the strain KSC1, which contains the ras1 gene under the nmt1promoter regulated by thiamine (nmt1-ras1 +-ura4) (35Chung K.S. Kim K.W. Yoo H.S. Mol. Cell. 1997; 7: 800-806Google Scholar, 36Chung K.S. Hoe K.L. Kim K.W. Yoo H.S. Gene. 1998; 210: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Approximately 2.5 × 105 cells on EMM plates were treated with UV (dose: 254 nm, 115 V, 60 Hz, 0.16 A), which empirically is known to generate on average one point mutation/chromosome and leads to 20% survival of S. pombecells. The mutagenized cells were incubated at 30 °C for 6 days. The resulting 5×104 colonies that survived were patched onto EMM plates and then replica-plated on EMM plates containing phloxine B (20 µg/ml) with or without thiamine. KSC3 was selected from 50 candidate colonies that grew on EMM plates but did not grow on EMM containing thiamine. This mutant grew normally only when theras1 gene under the nmt1 promoter was expressed in the absence of thiamine. To clone a gene complementing this lethal phenotype, the mutant KSC3 strain was cultured in EMM in the absence of thiamine and was transformed with the genomic library constructed by Chung et al. (36Chung K.S. Hoe K.L. Kim K.W. Yoo H.S. Gene. 1998; 210: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The transformed cells were plated onto EMM plates and incubated at 30 °C for 4 days. The transformants grown in EMM were replica-plated onto EMM containing phloxine B and thiamine. Approximately 1×105 transformants were screened, and 18 independent colonies that grew on EMM containing thiamine, where the Ras1 function was turned off, were selected. DNAs were recovered from these transformants, and the insert DNAs were subcloned and tested for complementation of the mutant phenotype of KSC3. The shortest insert DNA showing complementation was used for Northern blot and sequencing analysis. Total RNAs were prepared fromS. pombe cells grown to log phase in different growth media as reported previously (20Kim D.U. Park S.K. Chung K.S. Choi M.U. Yoo H.S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 20-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and resolved on a 1% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde. RNAs were transferred to a nylon membrane and hybridized (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with the probe DNAs radioactively labeled with a Redipriming kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To determine the location of Stm1 protein in cells, the HA (hemagglutinin A) tagging method (40Field J. Nikawa J. Broek D. MacDonald B. Rodgers L. Wilson I, A. Lerner R.A. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2159-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar) was used. An oligonucleotide encoding three copies of HA epitope sequences was synthesized and inserted at the 3′-end of thestm1 gene, which is under the nmt1 promoter sequence (pnmt1-stm1-HA). The cells containing the plasmid pnmt1-stm1-HA were grown at 2 × 107cells/ml in EMM in the absence of thiamine. 40 ml of the cells were harvested, washed with cold TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA), and resuspended in 300 µl of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). The cells were broken by a bead beater and centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 3 min (41Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Ausubel F.M. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Press, New York1995Google Scholar). The supernatant was centrifuged again at 100,000 × g for 10 min, and this clarified supernatant was used as a cytosolic fraction. The pellet fraction was treated with 2% Triton X-100 and 1.5% Sarcosyl for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant was used as a membrane fraction. Proteins (40 µg from each fraction) were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels (PAGE), and electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schull). The proteins on the membrane were treated first with HA antibody (12CA5) according to the procedure described previously (42Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The immune complexes retained on the membrane were visualized using anti-mouse IgG antibody as a secondary antibody and an alkaline phosphatase detection system (Promega). To determine the in situ location of Stm1, the coding region DNA of the green fluorescent protein gene (GFP) from the jellyfishAequorea victoria (43Prasher D.C. Eckenrode V.K. Ward W.W. Prendergast F.G. Cormier M. Gene. 1992; 111: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar, 44Song K. Mach K.E. Chen C.Y. Reynolds T. Albright C.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1307-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) was fused in frame to the C terminus of the stm1 + gene. The cells carrying the plasmid pnmt1-stm1-GFP were grown in minimal medium containing 25 nm thiamine, and Stm1-GFP fusion protein was detected by immunofluorescent microscopy. The stm1 + gene was disrupted using the one-step gene disruption method (38Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3125) Google Scholar). The 0.9-kbHindIII-HpaI fragment containing the entirestm1 coding region DNA of genomic clone pWH031 (Fig.2A) was replaced with the ura4 + gene. The resulting plasmid was treated with XbaI andHindIII, and the 3.2-kb XbaI-HindIII fragment so obtained was isolated and then used to replace one chromosomal copy of the stm1+ gene in a diploid strain, SP286. After obtaining stable Ura4+ transformants, genomic DNA was prepared from each transcript (38Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3125) Google Scholar), and these were analyzed by Southern blotting with the probes of stm1and ura4. The diploid strain containing one wild type and one disrupted copy of stm1 + was selected. After sporulation, the resulting tetrads were analyzed, and the DNA content of the stm1-disrupted haploid cells that were cultured under nitrogen-starved conditions was analyzed using a Becton Dickinson flow cytometer (FACScan) as reported previously (46Jang Y.J. Won M.S. Chung K.S. Kim D.U. Hoe K.L. Park C.K. Yoo H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19993-20002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), with some modifications. The cells pre-grown in EMM were transferred to ammonium chloride-free EMM. Aliquots of the cells were withdrawn every 2 h and analyzed by FACScan. To examine the effects of overexpression of Stm1, the coding region sequence of stm1 + was prepared by PCR and placed under the thiamine-regulatednmt1 promoter at the BamHI site of the pREP1 vector (45Maundrell K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10857-10864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, pnmt1-stm1, was introduced into either the heterothallic haploid (ED665 or various mutants strains) or the homothallic haploid strain (h90). These transformants were initially allowed to grow in EMM containing thiamine. The cells were then transferred into thiamine-free fresh EMM and pre-incubated at 30 °C for 12 h. These conditions allowed induction of stm1 gene transcription. 4 × 106 cells/ml were then transferred into thiamine-free fresh EMM at a cell density of A 600 = 0.2 and incubated at 30 °C. Aliquots of the cells were removed at the designated times, and cell morphologies were examined under a phase contrast microscope (Carl Zeiss). The amounts of stm1 and sporulation-specific gene transcripts in each cell sample were analyzed by Northern blotting. To examine the interactions between Stm1 protein and other proteins of S. pombe, a yeast two-hybrid assay using GAL4 binding and activation domains was used. The DNAs in the coding region of the test protein genes were amplified by PCR from the genomic DNAs or cDNAs with the corresponding primers. The amplified DNAs were inserted at the 3′-end of the GAL4 binding or GAL4 activation domain sequences of the plasmids pGBT9 and pGAD424, respectively. The 1.2-kb fragment of the G protein α-subunit gpa1 gene was amplified with the primers 5′-CCGGATCCGGATGGGATGCATGTCGAGT-3′ and 5′-CCGGATCCAAACAGCAAACTAGTGTC-3′ (genomic and c-DNA sequences are underlined in all primers). The 1.06-kb fragment of thegpa2 gene was amplified from the cDNA using the primers 5′-CCGGATCCGGATGACGATTTTTAATGGA-3′ and 5′-CCGGATCCAAACATTCCCGCTTCTTT-3′. These amplified fragments were cloned into the BamHI site of pGBT9 (CLONTECH) or pGAD424 to generate pGBT-Gpa1 and pGBT-Gpa2 or pGAD-Gpa1 and pGAD-Gpa2. The 0.96-kb fragment of the G protein β-subunit gene, gpb1, was amplified from the genomic DNA with the primers 5′-CCGAATTCATGATATTAGACGGAATACT-3′ and 5′-CCGTCGACCCCTGACGAAGACCAGAG-3′ and cloned into theEcoRI and SalI sites of pGBT9 to generate pGBT-Gpb1. The 0.8-kb fragment of the stm1 gene was amplified from genomic DNA with the primers 5′-CCGGATCCGGATGTCTGTGATAGCTCCTTC-3′ and 5′-CCGGATCCATAATGATTACGATACTTGATAA-3′ and cloned into theBamHI site of pGAD424 or pGBT9 to produce pGAD-Stm1 or pGBT-Stm1, respectively. The 1.0-kb fragment of the mam2gene of a pheromone receptor was amplified from genomic DNA with the primers 5′-CGCGAATTCATGAGACAACCATGGTGGAAA-3′ and 5′-GCGGATCCGTCCACTTTTTAGTTTCAGAT -3′, and cloned into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pGAD424 or pGBT9 to generate pGAD-Mam2 or pGBT-Mam2, respectively. The pGBT and pGAD fusion plasmids were co-transformed into reporter strain SFY526, and these transformants were selected on appropriate synthetic minimal medium (CLONTECH). Transformants were assayed for β-galactosidase activity, and the colonies showing a blue color on an indicator filter were retested for β-galactosidase activity. As a positive control for specific protein interactions, plasmids pGBT-p53 (pVA3) and pGAD-SV40 large T-antigen (pTD1) were co-transformed. To exclude the possibility of nonspecific interactions, pGBT-Stm1 and pGAD424, or pGBT9 and pGAD-Gpa2, were also co-transformed and used as negative controls. To investigate whether Stm1 binds to Gpa2 directly in vitro, GST or maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion proteins were prepared by cloning stm1 into anE. coli expression vector, pGEX-3X, encoding isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside-inducible glutathioneS-transferase (GST) and by cloning gpa2 into pMAL-c1, containing the MBP gene. The coding region DNA or each fraction of stm1 DNA or the coding region DNA ofgpa2 was amplified by PCR under denaturing conditions of 95 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and polymerizing at 72 °C for 2 min. The resulting DNAs were fused at the 3′-end of either the GST or MAL gene. The clones expressing proteins of the correct size were selected and used for in vitro binding experiments. Expression of GST-Stm1 or MBP-Gpa2 fusion proteins was induced in the presence of 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside at 25 °C as described previously (46Jang Y.J. Won M.S. Chung K.S. Kim D.U.

By disrupting the α-subunit gene of PCC, we created a mouse model of PA (PCCA−/−), which died in 24–36 h after birth due to accelerated ketoacidosis. A postnatal, liver-specific PCC expression via a transgene in a far lower level than that in wild-type liver, allowed PCCA−/− mice to survive the newborn and early infant periods, preventing a lethal fit of ketoacidosis (SAP+PCCA−/− mice). Interestingly, SAP+PCCA−/− mice, in which the transgene expression increased after the late infant period, continued to grow normally while mice harboring a persistent low level of PCC died in the late infant period due to severe ketoacidosis, clearly suggesting the requirement of increased PCC supplementation in proportion to the animal growth. Based on these results, we propose a two-step strategy to achieve an efficient PA prevention in human patients: a partial PCC supplementation in the liver during the newborn and early infant periods, followed by a larger amount of supplementation in the late infant period.

Propionic acidemia (PA) is the most frequent autosomal recessive disorder of organic acid metabolism in humans. It is caused by a deficiency of propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC), a ubiquitously expressed, heteropolymeric mitochondrial enzyme involved primarily in the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids and fatty acids, which harbor odd-numbered chain lengths (1Fenton W.A. Rosenberg L.E. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, NY1995: 1423-1440Google Scholar). A variety of mutations in the genes of either subunit (PCCA, PCCB) abolish or reduce the PCC function, resulting in a considerable clinical heterogeneity; some patients die in early childhood due to rapid and furious acceleration of the ketoacidosis in proportion to the increase of protein intake (2Perez-Cerda C.

Despite improvement of the dietary therapy, however, its long-term efficacy still appears controversial, and the overall outcome of severe forms of PA often remains disappointing (1Fenton W.A.

Pediatr. 1999; 158: 65-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As in other genetic disorders, supplementation of PCC activity, perhaps primarily via gene therapy, may efficiently temper even the severe forms of PA (6Wang F. Raab R.M. Washabaugh M.W. Buckland B.C. Metab. Eng. 2000; 2: 126-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 7Tsai S.Y. Schillinger K. Ye X. Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther. 2000; 2: 515-523PubMed Google Scholar, 8Morse M.A. Curr.

It seemed important, then, to generate an animal model of PA to test possible therapeutic strategies. We therefore created a strain of mice lacking PCC activity by disrupting the α-subunit gene (PCCAgene) via homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. To address the potentiality of a tissue-specific gene supplementation as a PA therapy, we also generated a transgenic mouse strain expressing PCCA exclusively in the liver and then crossbred these two types of mice. By analyzing these mice, we determined the potential therapeutic efficacy of the liver-specific PCC supplementation and propose a new mode of treatment to achieve an efficient PA prevention in human patients. A mouse genomic DNA clone containing exons of the PCCA gene was isolated by screening a genomic DNA library derived from the 129/sv strain. The targeting vector was prepared using the 12-kb EcoRI-HindIII genomic DNA fragment, pMC-1-neo-poly(A) (Stratagene) plasmid and the pBluescript plasmid (Stratagene). This construct was designed to delete a 2-kbEcoRI-XbaI fragment from PCCA, encompassing exons 1–4 as schematized in Fig. 1 A. The linearized targeting vector was electroporated into the E14.1 embryonic stem line as we previously described (10Miyazaki T. Hirokami Y. Matsuhashi N. Takatsuka H. Naito M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). G418-resistant clones were isolated and screened by polymerase chain reaction and Southern blotting. Two of 146 Gly-418-resistant clones had undergone the desired homologous recombination. Positive clones were injected into C57BL/6 (B6) blastocysts, and male chimeric offspring were mated to B6 females. Mice carrying the mutation in the heterozygous state (PCCA+/−) were intercrossed to produce homozygote mutants (PCCA−/−). A cDNA clone containing the whole mouse PCCA coding sequence was isolated by screening a mouse spleen cDNA library (CLONTECH) using a human PCCA cDNA fragment as a probe. The 2.8-kb mouse PCCA cDNA fragment was subcloned into the EcoRI site of the pSG-1 expression vector, which contains human SAP promoter and rabbit β-globin non-coding exon/intron (11Toyonaga T. Hino O. Sugai S. Wakasugi S. Abe K. Shichiri M. Yamamura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 614-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The complete plasmid (SAP-PCCA) was digested withHindIII and XhoI, and the transgene fragment no longer containing vector sequence was purified by Geneclean II kit (Bio101, Vista, CA). DNA was microinjected into fertilized eggs of (B6xDBA/2)F1 mice. Resulting founders were screened for transgene by polymerase chain reaction and Southern blotting. Three independent founders carried the transgene. All three mice were crossbred with PCCA+/− mice. Progenies harboring Transgene+PCCA+/− genotype were intercrossed to obtain SAP-Transgene+PCCA−/−(SAP+PCCA−/−) mice. PCC activity in the liver tissues was determined by fixation of [14C]bicarbonate as described elsewhere (12Gravel R.A. Lam K.F. Scully K.I. Hsia Y. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1977; 29: 378-388PubMed Google Scholar). Liver and kidney specimens were fixed in 10% formalin. 10 μm-thick sections were cut from paraffin-embedded samples and stained by hematoxylin-eosin or periodic acid-Schiff (PAS). For fat detection, frozen liver sections, which had been embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT compound, were cut at 10-μm thickness and then stained with oil red O (Sigma) as described elsewhere (13Novikoff A.B. Novikoff P.M. Rosen O.M. Rubin C.S. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 87: 180-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). We created PCC-deficient mice by disrupting the gene encoding the α-subunit of PCC protein (PCCA). Null mutation of the PCCA gene was generated by replacing an ∼2-kb fragment of the PCCA gene, which contains exons encoding the N-terminal sequence of PCCA protein, with the neomycin resistance gene (neor), via homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells (Fig.1 A). Although thePCCA gene is expressed ubiquitously from the early embryonic stage throughout the whole development, 2T. Miyazaki and T. Ohura, unpublished result. PCCA-null (PCCA−/−) mice were born at the expected Mendelian frequency, and were indistinguishable from wild-type (PCCA+/+) littermate mice at birth. This is compatible with human PA patients, most of whom have no clinical complaints at birth (1Fenton W.A. Rosenberg L.E. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, NY1995: 1423-1440Google Scholar). During embryogenesis, the toxic propionic acid derived from propionyl-CoA that has accumulated within cells might be purified via maternal circulation. The abolished expression of PCCA in PCCA−/− mice was confirmed by Northern blot analysis of the liver RNA (Fig. 1 B), and by the absence of PCC enzyme activity in the liver tissue (1590 ± 18 in PCCA+/+ versus 15 ± 17 in PCCA−/−, mice;n = 3 for each, pmol/min/mg) (12Gravel R.A. Lam K.F. Scully K.I. Hsia Y. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1977; 29: 378-388PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty-four h after birth, PCCA−/− mice showed remarkably high concentrations of serum propionyl-carnitine, urinary 3-OH-propionate (3-HP) and urinary methylcitrate, all of which increase in human PA patients as the result of abnormal metabolism of the accumulated propionyl-CoA, and thus are useful for PA diagnosis (1Fenton W.A. Rosenberg L.E. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, NY1995: 1423-1440Google Scholar, 15Wolf B. Hsia Y.E. Sweetman L. Gravel R. Harris D.J. Nyhan W.L. J. Pediatr. 1981; 99: 835-846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) (Table I). Interestingly, the serum propionyl-carnitine concentration was significantly high in PCCA−/− mice even at birth (Table I), suggesting that the maternal circulation appears not to be able to completely overcome the accumulation of the catabolites of propionyl-CoA. Probably due to the intake of protein from the milk, as well as to the lack of the maternal circulation, the concentrations of propionyl-carnitine, methylcitrate, and 3-HP were strikingly increased in PCCA−/− mice within 10 h after birth (Table I). The ketonuria, which indicates the presence of acidosis caused by the catabolism of the accumulated propionyl-CoA (1Fenton W.A. Rosenberg L.E. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease.

As a consequence of progressed acidosis, PCCA−/− mice no longer took milk after 10–12 h, although both PCCA−/−and PCCA+/+ mice started sucking milk right after birth. This decrease of intake is also often observed in human PA infants as a primary symptom of the disease (1Fenton W.A. Rosenberg L.E. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, NY1995: 1423-1440Google Scholar). Twenty-four h after birth, PCCA−/− mice were apparently dehydrated (dry skin, poor urination), poor in movements, and possessed little or no milk in their stomachs, whereas PCCA+/+ littermate mice were healthy and their stomachs were filled with milk. A vicious circle by the acceleration of dehydration and the progression of acidosis resulted in death of all PCCA−/− mice in 24–36 h after birth. In the histology of tissues at 24 h after birth, PCCA+/+ mice harbored significant amounts of a PAS-positive product in the liver (Fig.2 A), which was identified as glycogen by a glycogen-specific tissue staining method using ethanol-fixed liver specimens (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, PCCA−/− mice showed no or very little glycogen in the liver (Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, PCCA−/− mice did possess glycogen in the liver like PCCA+/+ mice at the very late gestation, E18.5 (Fig. 2, D and E). Therefore, this disappearance of glycogen in PCCA−/− mice appears to be due to a drastic consumption. Serum concentration of either glucose or insulin was comparable in PCCA+/+ and PCCA−/− mice (data not shown), clearly indicating that there was no defect in the glucose metabolism pathway that may cause a complemental consumption of glycogen. In the kidney of PCCA−/− mice, the collecting ducts were enlarged with marked incorporation of hyaline droplet casts, which implicated an acceleration of reabsorption (Fig. 2, F and G). All of these pathological changes in the liver and kidney of PCCA−/− mice might be primarily caused by the dehydration and malnutrition due to no intake of milk after 10–12 h of age, since similar phenotypes were also observed in PCCA+/+ mice that had undergone dietary treatment for 16 h at the newborn period (Fig. 2, H–K). Remarkable deposition of fat was observed in the liver of PCCA−/− mice at 24 h after birth (Fig. 2,L and M). This fat-deposition was, however, not detected at the late embryonic stage (E18.5) (data not shown), implying that the deposition appeared to be rapidly generated in proportion to the progression of acidosis after birth. Also in human, a few cases of similar fat deposition in the liver of infant severe-form PA patients have been also reported (17Glasgow A.M. Chass H.P. Pediatr. Res. 1976; 10: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 18Linseisen J. Wolfam G. J. Parenter. Enteral. Nutr. 1993; 17: 522-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Accelerated dehydration and malnutrition in addition to accumulation of propionyl-CoA might disturb the general oxidation of fatty acids in the liver, perhaps resulting in their accumulation and deposition in the liver tissue of PCCA−/− mice (17Glasgow A.M. Chass H.P. Pediatr. Res. 1976; 10: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 18Linseisen J. Wolfam G. J. Parenter. Enteral.

There was, however, no difference in RNA expression of various genes related to either synthesis or oxidation of fatty acids, e.g. SREBP-1 (a transcription factor), fatty acid synthase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenas, acyl-CoA oxidase, and carnitine palmitoyl CoA transferase in PCCA+/+ and PCCA−/− mice as assessed by Northern blotting (data not shown). Further study will be required to clarify the precise mechanism of the fat deposition in the liver. This fat deposition in the liver does not seem to provoke hepatic dysfunction because serum concentrations of various parameters for hepatic damage, such as GOT, GPT, γ-GTP and bilirubin, were within the normal range in PCCA−/− mice and comparable with those in PCCA+/+ mice (data not shown). Overall, the PCCA−/− mouse properly represents the severe form of PA patients and thus is a useful animal model to test therapies for the disease. By using PCCA−/− mice, we attempted to address the potential efficacy of PCC gene supplementation as an alternative strategy that might prevent PA more efficiently. In general, gene transfer via the DNA vaccination or the virus-based vectors has been studied extensively (6Wang F. Raab R.M. Washabaugh M.W. Buckland B.C. Metab. Eng. 2000; 2: 126-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 7Tsai S.Y. Schillinger K. Ye X. Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther. 2000; 2: 515-523PubMed Google Scholar, 8Morse M.A. Curr. Opin. Mol.

It appears, however, impossible to directly test either strategy in PCCA−/− mice because unlike human patients, PCCA−/− mice die very shortly (in 24–36 h) after birth, and that is not sufficient time for transferred genes to yield efficient expression. Thus, we designed a PCCA transgenic mouse system, in which the transgene expression pattern is similar to that in postnatal gene transfer therapies i.e. 1) the transgene will not express during the embryonic stages, 2) the transgene will express in a tissue specific fashion, and 3) the supplementation of PCC activity per a tissue by the transgene will be within an achievable level by gene therapies in general according to the previous reports of various other genes (27Kozlowski D.A.

To satisfy these conditions, we generated transgenic mice expressing PCCA under the regulation of the serum amyloid P component (SAP) gene promoter based on the following characteristics of SAP promoter (11Toyonaga T. Hino O. Sugai S. Wakasugi S. Abe K. Shichiri M. Yamamura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 614-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). First, the SAP promoter regulates the target gene to express exclusively in the liver (11Toyonaga T. Hino O. Sugai S. Wakasugi S. Abe K. Shichiri M. Yamamura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 614-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 31Zhao X. Araki K. Miyazaki J. Yamamura K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 736-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 32Takashima H. Araki K. Miyazaki J. Yamamura K. Kimoto M. Immunology. 1992; 75: 398-405PubMed Google Scholar). The liver appears ideal as a recipient organ for PCC gene transfer because the liver tissue is one of the primary organs that metabolize the odd-numbered amino acids and fatty acids. Second, it is known that a transgene under the SAP promoter regulation starts its expression only after birth, preserving a low expression level for the first few days and increases its expression thereafter (31Zhao X. Araki K. Miyazaki J. Yamamura K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 736-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 32Takashima H. Araki K. Miyazaki J. Yamamura K. Kimoto M. Immunology. 1992; 75: 398-405PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, SAP-PCCA transgenic mouse on a PCCA−/− background (SAP+PCCA−/−) appears to enable one to address the therapeutic efficacy of supplementation of a low amount of PCC activity in the liver during the newborn and the early infant periods. Three lines of SAP-PCCA transgenic mice were generated and crossbred to PCCA−/− background to obtain SAP+PCCA−/− mice. As expected, the transgene expression was restricted in the liver in all of three transgenic mouse lines as assessed by Northern blotting (data not shown). Two lines of SAP+PCCA−/− mice were analyzed together with PCCA−/− and PCCA+/+ littermate mice (both two SAP+PCCA−/− lines revealed identical phenotypes). At birth, all of these types of mice were indistinguishable and started sucking milk. After 24 h, most of PCCA−/− mice revealed severe ketonuria, and died as described above. At the same time point, however, SAP+PCCA−/− mice were healthy and continued sucking, thus their stomachs were full with milk like PCCA+/+ mice. The ketouria of SAP+PCCA−/− mice was significantly milder than that of PCCA−/− mice (+ ∼ ++ in SAP+PCCA−/− versus ++++ in PCCA−/−). After 36 h, in contrast to PCCA−/− mice that had all died, all of SAP+PCCA−/− littermate mice had survived. SAP+PCCA−/− mice continued growing comparatively in size with PCCA+/+ mice, and showed no abnormalities in behavior, responses to various stimuli, sleep, and sexuality. Both male and female adult SAP+PCCA−/− mice revealed no defect in breeding efficiency. Fig. 3 demonstrates the RNA expression of the transgene and the PCC activity in the liver as well as the concentrations of the serum propionyl-carnitine and the urine 3-HP in SAP+PCCA−/− mice at various ages. As expected, no transgene expression, thus also no PCC activity, was detected in the E12 embryonic liver. Transgene was not expressed even at the late embryonic stage, E18.5, which is immediately before the birth (data not shown). Twenty-four h after birth, the PCC activity in the SAP+PCCA−/− mouse liver was 10–20% of that in the PCCA+/+ mouse liver, supplemented by a low expression of the transgene (∼20% of the level of the endogenous PCCA mRNA expression in PCCA+/+ liver; compare with 24 h +/+ lane). The concentrations of both propionyl-carnitine and 3-HP in these mice were significantly decreased as compared with those in PCCA−/− mice. Thus, supplementation of 10–20% PCC activity only in the liver was sufficient to prevent the lethal fate of neonatal PCCA−/−mice. This low PCCA transgene expression in SAP+PCCA−/− mice was preserved until 6–8 days of age, resulting in persistence of high propionyl-carnitine concentration and ketonuria, which were in the comparable levels to those at 24 h after birth (data not shown). SAP+PCCA−/− mice, however, showed no growth abnormality as compared with PCCA+/+ mice, as described above. The transgene expression started to increase after 8–10 days of age (data not shown), and at 3 weeks of age, SAP+PCCA−/− mice gained comparable PCC activity in the liver with PCCA+/+ mice (Fig. 3). This increase of PCC activity was followed by further decrease of propionyl-carnitine and 3-HP concentrations. Thereafter, these concentrations in SAP+PCCA−/− mice were at plateau levels similar to those at 3 weeks of age. The glycogen storage in the liver, which seemed to be consumed rapidly in PCCA−/− mice in 24 h after birth, was entirely recovered by transgene expression, and was comparable in SAP+PCCA−/− and PCCA+/+ mice either at 24 h or 3 weeks of age (Fig.4, A–E). In addition, the pathological change observed in the kidney of PCCA−/−mice, the enlargement of collecting ducts with marked incorporation of hyaline droplet casts, was decreased in SAP+PCCA−/− mice (Fig. 4, F–H). These results may be explained mainly by the prevention of dehydration and malnutrition in SAP+PCCA−/− mice. Fat deposition in the liver was apparently decreased in SAP+PCCA−/− mice at 24 h of age, though the severity was varied in each individual: some mice were entirely free from the fat-deposition whereas others harbored the deposition that was, however, obviously milder than that in PCCA−/−mice (data not shown). Interestingly, at 3 weeks of age, most of SAP+PCCA−/− mice revealed no fat-deposition in the liver (data not shown). These results clearly demonstrate that the fatty-change of the liver is reversible, and in addition, supplementation in the liver of at least 10–20% of the level of the endogenous PCC activity is sufficient for decreasing the fat-deposition in PCCA−/− mice. The lack of marked dehydration and malnutrition might have also contributed to the prevention of the fat deposition in SAP+PCCA−/− mice. Interestingly, the third line of SAP+PCCA−/− mouse revealed different expression pattern of transgene, probably due to the influence of the transgene integrating site in the chromosome. In this specific SAP+PCCA−/− line (SAPlow+PCCA−/−), unlike in the other two lines of SAP+PCCA−/− mice described above, a low level of transgene expression, thus low PCC activity (10–20% of that in PCCA+/+) in the liver, persisted even after 2 weeks of age (data not shown). Although these SAPlow+PCCA−/− mice survived for the first 2 weeks, which is the newborn and early infant periods, they died before 3 weeks of age, demonstrating severe ketonutia (+++ ∼ ++++) and dehydration. This result strongly implicated that a larger amount of PCC supplementation is required in proportion to the increase of protein intake as mice grow. This result may also explain the diversity of the age in the first onset of the severe ketoacidosis in human PA patients, each of which possesses different PCC activity depending on the type of PCC gene (either PCCA or PCCB) mutation (2Perez-Cerda C. Merinero B. Rodriguez-Pombo Perez B. Desviat L.R. Muro S. Richard E. Garcia M.J. Gangoiti J. Ruiz-Sala P. et al.Eur. J. Hum.

Acta. 1999; 1453: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In this report, we established a mouse model that resembles newborn PA patients who have undergone PCC gene transfer in a liver-specific fashion. These mice, SAP+PCCA−/−, provided important information as summarized bellow. First, a postnatal supplementation of at least 10–20% of endogenous PCC activity exclusively in the liver prevents the fatal fit of severe ketoacidosis during the newborn and early infant periods. Second, a persistent mild ketoacidosis (revealing ∼6- to 8-fold higher concentration of propionyl-carnitine than that in wild-type mice and a mild ketonuria) appears not to essentially influence infant development. This is reminiscent of the normal embryonic development in PCCA−/− mice, in which a certain accumulation of propionic acid appeared to be present during the embryonic period as described above. Lastly, 10–20% supplementation of PCCA activity efficiently tempers the fat-deposition observed in the liver of PCCA−/− mice. Therefore, it is also very likely that in human, the PCC gene transfer into the liver may be effective to prevent the fatal acceleration of ketoacidosis in neonatal PA patients, thus preserving normal growth during the early infant period. In addition, the early death of SAPlow+PCCA−/−mice, which harbored a persistent low level expression ofPCCA transgene even after the late infant stage, clearly implicated that a larger amount of PCC supplementation appears to be required in proportion to the growth of patients. Based on these results of SAP+PCCA−/−and SAPlow+PCCA−/− mice, we propose a two-step therapy to achieve efficient prevention of PA complaints in human patients: a partial supplementation of PCC activity exclusively in the liver, followed by a high amount of PCC supplementation in the late infant period. Because the “first step” treatment requires partial (at least 10–20%) and transient (only during the newborn and early infant periods) supplementation, a virus-based gene transfer in the liver (of either PCCA or PCCB gene depending on which gene is defected in each patient) (34Connelly S. Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther. 1999; 1: 565-572PubMed Google Scholar) may be a plausible strategy despite the following disadvantages implicated for the virus-based gene transfer. For example, 1) low supplementation efficiency (in a whole tissue) due to the low expression and limited distribution of the virus-infected area, and 2) difficulty of long term persistence of expression due to the instability of the transfected gene or production of antibodies against either the virus or the introduced gene (35Hackett N.R. Kaminsky S.M. Sondhi D. Crystal R.G. Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther. 2000; 2: 376-382PubMed Google Scholar). For the “second step” therapy, a more drastic treatment, such as liver-transplantation, which has been attempted so far in two infant PA patients (5Saudubray J.M. Touati G. Delonlay P. Jouvet P. Schlenzig J. Narcy C. Laurent J. Rabier D. Kamoun P. Jan D. Revillon Y. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1999; 158: 65-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), might be required. The second step therapy, however, will be performed in late infant patients who have been well controlled by the first step therapy. This will lead to less severe damage for patients than such a drastic therapy done in the newborn or the early infant periods as the initial treatment. Judging by the observation from SAP+PCCA−/− mice, whether the serum propionyl-carnitine concentration is within ∼6- to 8-fold higher than that in the normal population, might be referred to as a criterion to decide the frequency of the first step gene-transfer treatment as well as the opportunity to perform the second step treatment. It may be worth emphasizing that SAP+PCCA−/−mice showed no apparent clinical complaints without any dietary limitation. This suggests that the two-step therapy in human PA patients also might require no strict dietary limitation. It is, however, strongly possible that more efficient therapeutic results may be obtained if dietary limitation therapy is combined. In summary, PCCA−/− mice enabled us to observe the PA progression in a kinetic fashion from various aspects, including histology, which provided us new insights on the pathogenesis contributing to the severe illness. In addition, SAP+PCCA−/− mice indicated the potential efficacy of the two-step PCC supplementation therapy for human PA patients to prevent the fatal acceleration of ketoacidosis, which appears to result in essentially no clinical complaints even without a strict dietary limitation. These two types of mice will be useful animal models for further understanding of PA pathogenesis, as well as to test a variety of strategies toward establishment of the thorough therapy of PA.

Co-expression of these two polypeptides, however, produced a significant stimulation. Co-transfection of the α1b-adrenoreceptor with the palmitoylation-resistant C9S,C10S Gα11 also failed to produce a signal, and much reduced and kinetically delayed signals were obtained using either C9S Gα11 or C10S Gα11. Expression of a fusion protein between the α1b-adrenoreceptor and Gα11 allowed [Ca2+]i elevation, and this was also true for a fusion protein between the α1b-adrenoreceptor and C9S,C10S Gα11, since this strategy ensures proximity of the two polypeptides at the cell membrane. For both fusion proteins, co-expression of transducin α, as a β·γ-sequestering agent, fully attenuated the Ca2+signal. Both of these fusion proteins and one in which an acylation-resistant form of the receptor was linked to wild type Gα11 were also targets for agonist-regulated [3H]palmitoylation and bound [35S]guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPγS) in an agonist concentration-dependent manner. The potency of agonist to stimulate [35S]GTPγS binding was unaffected by the palmitoylation potential of either receptor or G protein. These studies provide clear evidence for coordinated, agonist-mediated regulation of the post-translational acylation of both a receptor and partner G protein and demonstrate the capacity of such fusions to bind and then release β·γ complex upon agonist stimulation whether or not the G protein can be palmitoylated.

Although double Gαq/Gα11 knockout mice are not viable, cells derived from such embryos have been extremely useful, particularly in the elucidation of function of the G12/G13 class of ubiquitously expressed, pertussis-insensitive G proteins (11Gohla A.

Such cells have also been used to demonstrate that agonist-induced internalization of Gαq/Gα11-coupled GPCRs is not dependent upon the presence of these G proteins (13Yu R. Hinkle P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15745-15750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Post-translational palmitoylation close to the N terminus of the α subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins appears to be central to their effective interaction with the plasma membrane and thus their capacity to transduce signals from GPCRs to effectors (14Ross E.M. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 107-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 15Mumby S.M. Curr. Opin.

Since the thioester bond between the protein and the fatty acid is easily cleaved, there is the potential for dynamic regulation of G protein acylation. This has been best examined for the adenylyl cyclase stimulatory G protein Gs, where activation mediated by GPCRs or cholera toxin has been shown to alter [3H]palmitoylation of the G protein (17Degtyarev M.Y. Spiegel A.M. Jones T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23769-23772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Linder M.E. Middleton P. Helper J.R. Taussig R. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Gα11 possesses two adjacent cysteine residues at positions 9 and 10, which have been established to be sites of acylation (20McCallum J.F. Wise A. Grassie M.A. Magee A.I. Guzzi F. Parenti M. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21Wise A. Parenti M. Milligan G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Mutation of these two cysteine residues results in production of a soluble polypeptide. Few reports have provided evidence for regulation of the palmitoylation of Gαq/Gα11, although elevated incorporation of [3H]palmitate into these G proteins by stimulation of the gonadotrophin-releasing hormone receptor has been reported (22Stanislaus D. Janovick J.A. Brothers S. Conn P.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 738-746PubMed Google Scholar) and by molecularly undefined receptors for 5-hydroxytryptamine in rat brain cortical membranes (23Bhamre S. Wang H.-Y. Friedman E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 1482-1489PubMed Google Scholar).Production of fusion proteins between GPCRs and G protein α subunits has become a popular means to explore many aspects of the detailed interactions between these protein classes (24Milligan G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 24-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 25Seifert R. Wenzel-Seifert K. Kobilka B.K. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 383-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Because the N terminus of the G protein α subunit is fused directly to the C terminus of the GPCR in such constructs, it is often unclear whether this might limit interaction with the G protein β·γ complex. This uncertainty reflects that the N terminus of the α subunit is an important contact interface for β·γ, although key amino acids for this interaction are thought to be located some 15 amino acids away from the site(s) of palmitoylation (26Evanko D.S. Thiyagarajan M.M. Wedegaertner P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1327-1336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).Herein, we use fusion proteins between the α1b-adrenoreceptor and forms of Gα11 to demonstrate that the fusion proteins are activated and regulate their palmitoylation status in response to agonist. By examining fusion constructs in which either the receptor or the G protein is resistant to palmitoylation, we also demonstrate that the acylation status of both polypeptide partners is dynamically regulated by agonist. Moreover, palmitoylation of Gα11 is not necessary for the binding and release of β·γ complex and further transduction of the signal.MATERIALS AND METHODSA fibroblast cell line (EF88) derived from a combined Gαq/Gα11 double knockout mouse (9Zywietz A.

In the first step, the coding sequence of each form of Gα11 (20McCallum J.F. Wise A. Grassie M.A. Magee A.I. Guzzi F. Parenti M. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21Wise A. Parenti M. Milligan G.

Using the C-terminal primer 5′-TTGTGCGGCCGCCGGTCACACCAGGTT-3, a NotI restriction site (underlined) was introduced downstream of the stop codon of Gα11. The amplified fragments digested withKpnI and NotI were subcloned into similarly digested pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). To obtain the various α1b-adrenoreceptor-Gα11 fusion proteins, the coding sequence of the wild type or C365A, C367G hamster α1b-adrenoreceptor was amplified by PCR. Using the amino-terminal primer 5′-GACGGTACCTCTAAAATGAATCCCGAT-3′, aKpnI restriction site (underlined) was introduced upstream of the initiator Met. Using the carboxyl-terminal primer 5′-GTCCCTGGTACCAAAGTGCCCGGGTG-3′, a second KpnI restriction site (underlined) was introduced immediately upstream of the stop codon. Finally, the Gα11 constructs in pcDNA3 were digested with KpnI and ligated together with the PCR product of the α1b-adrenoreceptor amplification also digested with KpnI. The open reading frames thus produced represent the coding sequence of either α1b-adrenoreceptor-Gα11, C365A,C367G α1b-adrenoreceptor-Gα11, or α1b-adrenoreceptor-C9S,C10S Gα11. Each was fully sequenced before its expression and analysis.Transient Transfection of HEK293 CellsHEK293 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 0.292 g/literl-glutamine and 10% (v/v) newborn calf serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Cells were grown to 60–80% confluence before transient transfection in 60-mm dishes. Transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions.3H PalmitoylationCells were labeled with 0.5 mCi/ml [9,10-3H]palmitic acid in DMEM supplemented with 0.292 g/liter l-glutamine, 5% (v/v) dialyzed newborn calf serum, and 5 mm pyruvic acid at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. After incubation for the appropriate time in the presence and absence of varying concentrations of phenylephrine, reactions were terminated by the addition of 200 μl of 1% (w/v) SDS.

The precleared supernatants were then incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with protein-A-Sepharose and 10 μl of antiserum CQ (27Mitchell F.M. Buckley N.J. Milligan G. Biochem.

For transfection experiments, a portion of the cells harvested during trypsinization were plated onto glass coverslips (22-mm diameter, grade 0 thickness), and after a 24-h growth period, cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 3 h, cells were washed twice with OPTI-MEM-1 and then cultured in DMEM growth medium for a further 24 h. In some experiments, after an initial 24-h transfection/growth period, the transfected cells were treated with pertussis toxin (25 ng/ml, 24 h).Measurement of [Ca2+]iTransfected cells growing on coverslips were loaded with the Ca2+-sensitive dye Fura-2 by incubation (15–20 min, 37 °C) in physiological control saline solution, 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, 10 mmd-glucose, pH adjusted to 7.4 using NaOH) containing the dye's membrane-permeant acetoxymethylester form (1.0 μm). A rise in [Ca2+]i causes a corresponding rise in the Fura-2 fluorescence ratio recorded from cells loaded with this dye, which allows receptor-mediated changes in [Ca2+]i to be monitored using standard, microspectrofluorimetric techniques (29Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 265: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). An Optoscan monochromator (Cairn Research, Faversham, Kent, UK) was used to alternate the excitation wavelength between 340 and 380 nm (band pass of 10 nm) and to control the excitation frequency. Fura-2 fluorescence emission at 510 nm was monitored either by a low noise COHU CCD camera or a photomultiplier tube with a bialkali photocathode. Images acquired with the CCD camera were stored and analyzed digitally under the control of Meta Fluor imaging software (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA).Agonist-evoked [Ca2+]i responses were quantified by peak height (i.e. difference between the base-line resting ratio level and that attained at the peak response). Responses were pooled and are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of at least five experiments, with vertical lines (see Fig.3) representing S.E. Statistical significance of any difference between means was determined using Student's t test. Differences in the magnitude of [Ca2+]i responses evoked by phenylephrine in untreated and pertussis toxin-treated cells were evaluated by Student's paired t test.RESULTSCells of a fibroblast-derived line (EF88) from the embryo of a combined Gαq/Gα11 double knockout mouse were grown on glass coverslips. These were transiently transfected with either the hamster α1b-adrenoreceptor or the mouse G protein Gα11. Co-transfection with enhanced green fluorescent protein allowed identification of positively transfected cells. Following loading of the cells with the Ca2+indicator Fura-2/AM (1 μm, 15 min, 37 °C), single cell Ca2+ imaging was performed in the absence of external Ca2+. In both cases, the addition of the α1-adrenoreceptor-selective agonist phenylephrine (10 μm) failed to alter basal intracellular [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i) (Fig.1, A and B). However, co-expression of both the α1b-adrenoreceptor and Gα11 resulted in a robust and rapid elevation of [Ca2+]i (Fig. 1, C and D). We have previously demonstrated that Gα11 can be post-translationally acylated on both Cys9 and Cys10 (20McCallum J.F. Wise A. Grassie M.A. Magee A.I. Guzzi F. Parenti M. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and that mutation of both of these amino acids to Ser prevents membrane association of the G protein (20McCallum J.F. Wise A.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Co-transfection of EF88 cells with the α1b-adrenoreceptor and C9S,C10S Gα11 thus also failed to result in a phenylephrine-mediated elevation of [Ca2+]i (Fig.2). Equivalent studies with either C9S Gα11 or C10S Gα11 did produce an agonist-dependent rise in [Ca2+]i(Fig. 2), but the magnitude of the response was substantially less than with wild type Gα11 and was kinetically much slower. In both of these regards, C10S Gα11 performed more poorly than C9S Gα11 (Fig. 2).Figure 1Co-expression of the α1b-adrenoreceptor and the G protein Gα11 is required to elevate [Ca2+] levels in EF88 cells. EF88 cells were transiently transfected with either the hamster α1b-adrenoreceptor (A) or the mouse G protein Gα11 (B) or co-transfected with the α1b-adrenoreceptor and Gα11 (C). Green fluorescent protein was co-expressed as a marker for positively transfected cells. Cells were loaded with Fura-2/AM and [Ca2+]i levels imaged before and during exposure of the cells to phenylephrine (Phe; 10 μm).

Data are the traces from six individual cells for each set of transfections.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To potentially overcome these deficits, fusion proteins were constructed between the α1b-adrenoreceptor and forms of Gα11. The G protein sequence was attached directly to the C-terminal tail of the receptor cDNA from which the stop codon was eliminated. This allows production of single open reading frames containing the features of both polypeptides (24Milligan G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 24-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 25Seifert R. Wenzel-Seifert K. Kobilka B.K. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 383-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Expression in EF88 cells of the chimeric polypeptide containing the wild type sequences of both receptor and G protein resulted in an elevation of [Ca2+]i upon the addition of phenylephrine (Fig.3 A), although the kinetics of the response were markedly slower than for the isolated but co-transfected receptor and G protein. Now the same was true when a fusion protein between the α1b-adrenoreceptor and C9S,C10S Gα11 was used (Fig. 3 B). This was also the case when a C365A,C367G α1b-adrenoreceptor-Gα11 fusion protein was expressed (data not shown). Elevation of [Ca2+]iin response to activation of a GPCR can proceed from activation of members of the phosphoinositidase C family by either α subunits of the Gq/G11 family or β·γ complexes (Fig.4 A). To ascertain if the signal from the fusion proteins derived from the receptor-attached G protein α subunit, EF88 cells were co-transfected with the α1b-adrenoreceptor-Gα11 fusion protein and transducin α. Transducin α is used regularly as a β·γ-sequestering agent, and in this situation the effect of phenylephrine was fully attenuated (Fig. 3 A). The N-terminal region of Gα subunits is an important binding interface for β·γ (30Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R.

Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). However, transducin α also fully attenuated the phenylephrine signal from the α1b-adrenoreceptor-C9S,C10S Gα11 fusion protein (Fig. 3 B).Figure 4Elevation of [Ca2+]i by the α1b-adrenoreceptor-Gα11fusion protein is not via activation of Gi family G proteins. A, receptor-mediated elevation of [Ca2+]i may proceed via either G protein α subunits or the β·γ complex. The β·γ-mediated elevation of [Ca2+]i (Fig. 3) could potentially derive from release of β·γ from the α1b-adrenoreceptor-Gα11 fusion protein or from pertussis toxin (Ptx)-sensitive, Gi family G proteins expressed endogenously by EF88 cells. B, membranes from either EF88 (2) or HEK 293 (1) cells were immunoblotted to detect the presence of Gα11/Gαq (upper panel) or Gαi (lower panel). C, EF88 cells expressing the α1b-adrenoreceptor-Gα11 fusion protein were treated with pertussis toxin (25 ng/ml) or with vehicle for 24 h. The capacity of phenylephrine to elevate [Ca2+]iwas then measured.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Elevation of [Ca2+]i could also potentially arise from β·γ complex released by interaction of the fusion proteins with members of the pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi family (Fig. 4 A), which, unlike Gαq and Gα11, are expressed in EF88 cells (Fig. 4 B). Expression of receptors in heterologous systems can result in a reduction in specificity of G protein coupling (32Selbie L.A. Hill S.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 87-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). To eliminate this possibility, experiments were repeated following sustained treatment with pertussis toxin of EF88 cells that had been transfected to express the α1b-adrenoreceptor-Gα11 fusion protein. This did not alter the phenylephrine-mediated elevation of [Ca2+]i (Fig. 4 C). The combined data of Figs. 3 and 4 demonstrate that the α1b-adrenoreceptor-Gα11 fusion protein both binds endogenous β·γ and is able to release it upon agonist occupancy and that the palmitoylation status and potential of Gα11 does not limit either its binding or release of β·γ complex.To directly explore palmitoylation of the fusion proteins and its regulation, α1b-adrenoreceptor-Gα11 was expressed transiently in HEK293 cells. Both these and mock-transfected cells were labeled with [3H]palmitate for 2 h, and the samples were immunoprecipitated with an antiserum (CQ) that identifies the C-terminal 10 amino acids shared by Gαqand Gα11 (27Mitchell F.M. Buckley N.J. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 28Kim G.-D. Carr I.C. Anderson L.A. Zabavnik J. Eidne K.A. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19933-19940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography, a band of some 42 kDa was observed in both mock-transfected and positively transfected cells (Fig.5). This corresponds to a mixture of Gαq and Gα11, which are co-expressed by HEK293 cells and not resolved by the gel conditions employed. A 100-kDa [3H]palmitoylated polypeptide corresponding to the α1b-adrenoreceptor-Gα11 fusion protein was also observed but only in the positively transfected cells (Fig. 5). When the time course of [3H]palmitoylation of the fusion protein was monitored in the presence and absence of phenylephrine, the rate, but not the maximal extent, of [3H]palmitoylation was markedly enhanced by the agonist (Fig.6). This effect was specific for agonist, since the presence of phentolamine, an antagonist/inverse agonist at the α1b-adreno"

This reductase has been shown to require glutathione and glutaredoxin, suggesting that thiol chemistry might be involved in the reaction mechanism. Acr2p has a HC(X)5R motif, the signature sequence of the phosphate binding loop of the dual-specific and protein-tyrosine phosphatase family. In Acr2p these are residues His-75, Cys-76, and Arg-82, respectively. Acr2p has another sequence, 118HCR, that is absent in phosphatases. Acr2p also has a third cysteine residue at position 106. Each of these cysteine residues was changed individually to serine residues, whereas the histidine and arginine residues were altered to alanines. Cells ofEscherichia coli heterologously expressing the majority of the mutant ACR2 genes retained wild type resistance to arsenate, and the purified altered Acr2p proteins exhibited normal enzymatic properties. In contrast, cells expressing either the C76S or R82A mutations lost resistance to arsenate, and the purified proteins were inactive. These results suggest that Acr2p utilizes a phosphatase-like Cys(X)5Arg motif as the catalytic center to reduce arsenate to arsenite.

These results suggest that Acr2p utilizes a phosphatase-like Cys(X)5Arg motif as the catalytic center to reduce arsenate to arsenite. glutaredoxin protein-tyrosine phosphatase dual-specific protein-tyrosine phosphatase Three unrelated families of arsenate reductases have been identified, two in prokaryotes and one in eukaryotes (1Bhattacharjee H.

Society for General Microbiology, Leeds1999: 58-79Google Scholar). One group is typified by the ArsC enzyme of Escherichia coli plasmid R773 (2Gladysheva T.B. Oden K.L. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7288-7293Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 3Oden K.L. Gladysheva T.B. Rosen B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). A second group includes the ArsC enzyme ofStaphylococcus aureus plasmid pI258 (4Ji G. Silver S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9474-9478Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), which is homologous to low molecular weight acid phosphatases (5Wo Y.Y. Zhou M.M. Stevis P. Davis J.P. Zhang Z.Y. Van Etten R.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1712-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Both the pI258 and R773 ArsCs utilize cysteine residues in their reactions. The thiolate group of Cys-12 in the R773 ArsC is required for catalysis (6Liu J. Gladysheva T.B. Lee L. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13472-13476Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The pI258 arsenate reductase has been suggested to form a disulfide bond between Cys-82 and Cys-89 during the reduction of arsenate to arsenite (7Messens J. Hayburn G. Desmyter A. Laus G. Wyns L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16857-16865Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Both prokaryotic reductases utilize small thiol transfer proteins. The R773 ArsC enzyme uses glutaredoxin (2Gladysheva T.B. Oden K.L. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7288-7293Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 8Shi J. Vlamis-Gardikas A. Åslund F. Holmgren A. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36039-36042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and the pI258 reductase uses thioredoxin (9Ji G. Garber E.A.E. Armes L.G. Chen C.M. Fuchs J.A. Silver S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7294-7299Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The first identified member of the third family is the 130-residue Acr2p of the eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae. TheACR2 gene was shown to be required for high level arsenate resistance (10Bobrowicz P. Wysocki R. Owsianik G. Goffeau A. Ulaszewski S. Yeast. 1997; 13: 819-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and disruption of this gene resulted in arsenate sensitivity (11Mukhopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 168: 127-136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently shown that Acr2p purified fromE. coli is a homodimer that catalyzes arsenate reductionin vitro and utilizes GSH and glutaredoxin (Grx)1 as the source of reducing equivalents (12Mukhopadhyay R. Shi J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21149-21157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The S. cerevisiae ACR2 gene can replace the unrelated R773 arsC gene in vivo inE. coli, facilitating structure-function analysis. Acr2p is a member of the Cdc25A superfamily of protein phosphotyrosyl phosphatases (PTPases) and is unrelated to the prokaryotic arsenate reductases. Two other Acr2p homologues in S. cerevisiae are YGR203W, a 148-residue protein of unknown function (GenBankTM accession number S0003435), and YMR036C (GenBankTM accession number S0004639), a PTPase (13Fauman E.B. Cogswell J.P. Lovejoy B. Rocque W.J. Holmes W. Montana V.G. Piwnica-Worms H. Rink M.J. Saper M.A. Cell. 1998; 93: 617-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Each of these three proteins has the consensus sequence HC(X)5RS(T), which corresponds to the PTPase active site (14Fauman E.B. Saper M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 413-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Although the histidine residue is conserved in PTPases and dual-specific phosphatases (ds-PTPases), it is not conserved in low molecular weight acid phosphatases (15Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1995; 92: 5910-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The histidine residue has been suggested to function in stabilizing the active site thiolate anion in PTPases and ds-PTPases but is not essential (16Zhang Z.Y. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9340-9345Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Comparison of the three-dimensional structure of PTPases and low molecular weight acid phosphatases reveals no structural homology outside the active site sequence, C(X)5RS(T). The active site loop forms a phosphate binding pocket where the phosphate would be positioned between the cysteine and arginine residues (15Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1995; 92: 5910-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Analysis of mutagenesis data and the crystal structure of the E. coli ArsC also identifies an anion binding pocket composed of three arginine residues, Arg-60, Arg-94, and Arg-107, which stabilize arsenate in the binding site for attack by the active site residue Cys-12. 2P. Martin, J. Shi, S. Demel, B. Edwards, and B. P. Rosen, unpublished results. Substitution of the invariant cysteine residue with serine in the phosphatase signature motif C(X)5R of several enzymes abolished hydrolytic activity in vitro and functionin vivo (17Wishart M.J. Denu J.M. Williams J.A. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26782-26785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Initial binding of phosphotyrosine substrates in the phosphate binding pocket of PTPases requires the coordination of two oxygen atoms present on the phosphoryl group with the guanidium side chain of the conserved active site arginine residue. Replacing the arginine residue with alanine increased the Km∼30-fold and decreased the Kcat by ∼8000-fold (18Zhang Z.Y. Wang Y. Wu L. Fauman E.B. Stuckey J.A. Schubert H.L. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15266-15270Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Similar mutations in an equivalent arginine residue of a receptor-like PTPase, the late airway response PTPase, resulted in the complete loss of enzymatic activity (19Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Thai T. Tang M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2399-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Acr2p has a PTPase-like HC(X)5R motif corresponding to residues His-75, Cys-76, and Arg-82. At the C terminus of ACR2p, there is another HCR motif corresponding to residues His-118, Cys-119, and Arg-120 that is not present in PTPases. In addition, Acr2p has a third cysteine at position 106. To examine the role of these residues in Acr2p catalysis, those residues were changed to serines or alanines by site-directed mutagenesis. The effects of the mutations were determined in vivo by expression in an arsenate-sensitive strain of E. coli. Altered proteins were purified, and their catalytic activity was measured. Substitution of His-75, His-118, Cys-106, Cys-119, or Arg-120 had no effect on arsenate resistance in vivo or on arsenate reductase activityin vitro. In contrast, the C76A, C76S, and R82A mutants lost both arsenate resistance in vivo and reductase activity in vitro. These results indicate that the PTPase-like C(X)5R motif of Acr2p may be part of the active site of this arsenate reductase. We propose that the two types of enzymes possess a common oxyanion binding site and that the first step in both the phosphatase and reductase reactions utilize a conserved active site cysteine thiolate.

Plasmid isolation, DNA restriction endonuclease analysis, ligation, and transformation were performed as described (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Either a Qiaprep spin miniprep kit or Qiaquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) was used to prepare plasmid DNA for restriction enzyme digestion, sequencing, and recovering DNA fragments from agarose gels. The sequence of each mutant gene product was confirmed by DNA sequencing of the entire gene using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Cy5-labeled autosequence kit and an ALF express apparatus by the method of Sanger et al.(22Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52650) Google Scholar). The phenotype of each of mutant ACR2 gene product was measured in E. coli strain WC3110 (ΔarsC) and in yeast strain RM1(ACR2Δ) as described previously (12Mukhopadhyay R. Shi J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21149-21157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Mutations in the sequence of ACR2 were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikchangeTM site-directed mutagenesis procedure (Stratagene). Plasmid pGEM-T-ACR2 was used as the template for creating single mutants. For the C106S/C119S double mutant, plasmid pGEM-T-ACR2C119S was used as the template with the same primers used to construct the C106S mutant. The mutagenic oligonucleotide used for both the strands, and the respective changes (underlined) introduced were as follows: C76S, CAAAGTGATATTTCATTCTACTGGGTCCAAGAATAGGGG and CCCCTATTCTTGGACCCAGTAGAATGAAATATCACTTTG; C76A, CGTCAAAGTGATATTTCATGCTACTGGGTCCAAGAATAGGG and CCTATTCTTGGACCCAGTAGCATGAAATATCACTTTGACG; C106S, AAGTAAGTTTGAGAGTAGCATCCTCGTTGGAGG and CCTCCAACGAGGATGCTACTCTCAAACTTACTTG; C119S, CGCTTGGGAGACCCATTCTAGAGAGAGTAACCTTAAATTG and CAATTTAAGGTTACTCTCTCTAGAATGGGTCTCCCAAGCG; R82A, GTACTGGGTCCAAGAATGCGGGACCAAAAGTAGCTGC and GCAGCTACTTTTGGTCCCGCATTCTTGGACCCAGTAC; R82K, CATTGTACTGGGTCCAAGAATAAAGGACCAAAAGTAGCTGC and GCAGCTACTTTTGGTCCTTTATTCTTGGACCCAGTACAATG; R120A, CGCTTGGGAGACCCATTGTGCAGAGAGTAACCTTAAATTG and CAATTTAAGGTTACTCTCTGCACAATGGGTCTCCCAAGCG; H75A, CGTCAAAGTGATATTTGCTTGTACTGGGTCCAAGAATAGGGG and CCCCTATTCTTGGACCCAGTACAAGCAAATATCACTTTGACG; and H118A, GGTTTTTACGCTTGGGAGACCGCTTGTAGAGAGAGTAACC and GGTTACTCTCTCTACAA- GCGGTCTCCCAAGCGTAAAAACC. Cultures ofE. coli WC3110 or Top10 bearing the indicated plasmids were grown in LB medium at 37 °C to an A600 = 0.5, at which point expression of ACR2 was induced by the addition of the 0.02% arabinose for strain Top10 or 0.2% arabinose for strain WC3110. To determine the ability of ACR2 mutants to be expressed, 2 ml of cells of E. coli WC3110 bearingACR2 genes in pBAD-Myc-HisA were induced at 37 °C for 4 h with 0.2% arabinose and centrifuged, and the pellets were suspended in 0.2 ml of SDS sample buffer. Samples were prepared by boiling in SDS sample buffer for 10 min, and the proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar). Immunological blotting with antibody to a six-histidine tag was performed as described previously (12Mukhopadhyay R. Shi J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21149-21157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To examine the solubility of mutant proteins, ACR2 genes in pBAD-Myc-HisA were expressed inE. coli TOP10. Cells were induced at 20 °C for 10 h, and production of cytosolic-soluble Acr2p was determined as described previously (12Mukhopadhyay R. Shi J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21149-21157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Acr2p was purified from cultures of E. coli strain Top10 bearing pBAD constructs with wild type or mutant ACR2 genes. Purification and assay of arsenate reductase activity was as described previously (12Mukhopadhyay R. Shi J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21149-21157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The data were analyzed using a SigmaPlot 2000. The concentration of purified Acr2p was from the absorbance at 280 nm (24Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5058) Google Scholar) using an extinction coefficient of 14,300 m−1cm−1 for the wild type, arginine, and histidine mutants and 14,180 m−1 cm−1 for the cysteine mutants. Acr2p residues Cys-76, Cys-106, and Cys-119 were individually changed to alanine or serine residues, producing the C76A, C76S, C106S, and C119S mutants. Cells bearing the mutated ACR2 genes were characterized phenotypically for arsenate resistance inE. coli strain WC3110 in which the chromosomalarsC gene was disrupted (Fig.1). Cells expressing the wild typeACR2 gene could grow in medium containing 1 mmsodium arsenate. Cells bearing ACR2C76S were as sensitive to arsenate as the WC3110 cells bearing just vector plasmid pBAD-Myc-HisA. In contrast, cells expressing either pBAD-ACR2C106S or pBAD-ACR2C119Swere as resistant to sodium arsenate as cells with the wild type ACR2 gene. A double mutant, pBAD-ACR2C106S/C119S, exhibited an arsenate-sensitive phenotype. Cells bearing ACR2C76A were as sensitive to arsenate as cells bearing ACR2C76S (data not shown). However, expression of the C106S/C119S protein was extremely poor in strain WC3110, and no soluble mutant reductase was observed in strain Top10, suggesting that this mutant could not fold properly (data not shown). Each of the two arginine residues, Arg-82 and Arg-120, were individually changed to alanine residues, producing mutants R82A and R120A. Cells of E. coli strain WC3110 expressing these mutant genes were characterized phenotypically (Fig.2). Cells bearing plasmid pBAD-ACR2R82A were nearly as sensitive to sodium arsenate as the cells with vector only. However, cells bearing plasmid pBAD-ACR2R120A were as resistant as the wild type to arsenate. Arg-82 was also modified to lysine, another basic residue, and cells bearing plasmid pBAD-ACR2R82K were as sensitive to arsenate as the R82A mutant. However, the R82K protein was poorly expressed in WC3110, and the majority of the protein was found in inclusion bodies as determined by cellular fractionation and immunoblotting (data not shown). Two histidine residues, His-75 and His-118, were altered individually to alanines, producing the H75A and H118A derivatives. Cells expressing either of the altered genes exhibited arsenate resistance similar to that of the wild type (Fig.3), demonstrating that neither of the two histidines is required for activity. To demonstrate that the phenotype observed by heterologous expression in E. coli was a predictor of the phenotype of the mutants in yeast, a representative sensitive mutant, C76S, and a representative resistant mutant, H118A, were cloned in vector pYES2.0 and transformed into S. cerevisiae strain RM1 (ACR2Δ). As anticipated, yeast cells bearing plasmid pYES2.0-ACR2C76S were as sensitive to arsenate as cells bearing vector only, and cells bearing plasmid pYES2.0-ACR2H118A were as resistant to arsenate as the cells bearing a wild type ACR2 gene (data not shown). These results provide a measure of confidence that expression ofACR2 genes in E. coli can be used to evaluate the effects of mutagenesis of this yeast gene. The steady state level of production of most of the altered Acr2p proteins was approximately the same as the wild type as demonstrated by immunoblotting using an anti-His tag monoclonal antibody (data not shown). Two exceptions were C119S/C106S and R82K, which were found exclusively in inclusion bodies. Except for those two, each of the other altered Acr2p proteins were as soluble as the wild type when produced in E. coli strain Top10 induced with 0.02% arabinose at 20 °C. Each purified mutant Acr2p protein was shown to be a homodimer by gel filtration chromatography, and each eluted from chromatographic matrices at the same position as the wild type protein. Similarly, there was no difference between the wild type and altered proteins in mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis nor was abnormal degradation of the altered proteins observed. These results indicate that the overall tertiary structure of the altered proteins was not significantly different from the wild type, although local changes cannot be ruled out. Acr2p reduces arsenate to arsenite with GSH and any of several glutaredoxins serving as the source of reducing equivalents (12Mukhopadhyay R. Shi J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21149-21157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). As a function of arsenate concentration, Acr2p has been shown to exhibit sigmoidal kinetics, although the basis for this apparent cooperativity is not known. The reductase activity of the cysteine, arginine, and histidine mutants was measured using a coupled assay (12Mukhopadhyay R. Shi J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21149-21157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Purified C76S or C76A exhibited no arsenate reductase activity over background, even when assayed at a 3-fold higher concentration than the wild type (data not shown). Under these conditions the limit of detection of reductase activity would be 1–2% of wild type, so catalytic rates of less than 1% of wild type would not be detected. C106S and C119S exhibited similar sigmoidal kinetics as the wild type enzyme (Fig. 4) with apparent Hill coefficient (napp) values of 2.0 and 3.2, respectively, compared with 2.1 for the wild type (TableII). The Kappvalues were slightly higher in both the cysteine mutants when compared with the wild type. The Vmax of the two altered enzymes was approximately the same as the wild type.Table IIKinetic parameters of Acr2p mutantsProteinVmaxaCalculated per mg of Acr2p.KappbKapp for sodium arsenate at 5 μm Acr2p and 1 μm Grx1p.nappWT337312.1C106S343472.03C119S317583.18H75A3401171.3H118A340322.1R120A389492.3a Calculated per mg of Acr2p.b Kapp for sodium arsenate at 5 μm Acr2p and 1 μm Grx1p. Open table in a new tab When the activity of the two arginine mutants was examined, purified R82A exhibited no arsenate reductase activity over background, even when 3-fold more protein was used. R120A exhibited sigmoidal kinetics. The apparent Hill coefficient (napp) was 2.3, similar to that of the wild type (Fig.5). The Vmax was approximately the same as the wild type, and theKapp value was slightly higher (Table II). Both the histidine mutants H75A and H118A were purified, and their arsenate reductase activity was determined (Fig.6). The sigmoidal kinetics of H118A was similar to the wild type protein with an apparent Hill coefficient (napp) of 2.1. H75A exhibited sigmoidal kinetics, although the napp was only 1.3. TheKapp of H118A was the same as the wild type, but the H75A Kapp was approximately 4-fold higher (Table II). The Vmax for each of the histidine mutants was approximately the same as the wild type. Acr2p is a 30-kDa homodimeric yeast enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of As(V) to As(III) (12Mukhopadhyay R. Shi J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21149-21157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Both GSH and Grx are required for catalysis in vitro, and the data suggested the formation of a mixed disulfide between Acr2p and glutathione. These results imply that at least one cysteinyl residue in the enzyme is involved in catalysis. Acr2p exhibits sequence similarity with members of the Cdc25A family of PTPases, and Cys-76 in Acr2p can be aligned with the catalytic Cys-430 of the human Cdc25A (13Fauman E.B. Cogswell J.P.

PTPases possess a catalytic domain with a highly conserved HC(X)5R signature motif (25Xu X. Burke S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5118-5124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Mutational and chemical modification experiments suggest that the invariant cysteine residue in this signature motif is essential for enzymatic activity (18Zhang Z.Y. Wang Y. Wu L. Fauman E.B. Stuckey J.A. Schubert H.L. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15266-15270Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and is directly involved in the formation of a covalent phosphoenzyme intermediate (26Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 19688-19696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the conserved arginine residue is essential and has been suggested to participate both in substrate binding and in stabilization of the transition state (18Zhang Z.Y. Wang Y. Wu L. Fauman E.B. Stuckey J.A. Schubert H.L. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15266-15270Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In this study Acr2p residues Cys-76 and Arg-82 in the conserved HC(X)5R motif were individually changed to serine and alanine, respectively. In vivo, cells expressing the altered proteins exhibited an arsenate-sensitive phenotype.In vitro, the purified C76A, C76S, and R82A mutant proteins were inactive. Thus, the data indicate that both Cys-76 and Arg-82 are required for catalysis. On the other hand, the conserved histidine residue at the start of the signature sequence of PTPases does not appear to have an essential role in catalysis. Similarly, in Acr2p, the Vmax of the H75A mutant of Acr2p was the same as the wild type enzyme, but the apparent Km was increased 4-fold (Table II). Although His-75 is not required for catalysis, it could play a less direct role. In PTPases the conserved histidine has been suggested to have a structural role. For example, a H445N mutant of Cdc25B, an isoform of Cdc25A, exhibited catalytic activity similar to that of the wild type enzyme but had an increased Km (25Xu X. Burke S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5118-5124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the human PTP1B, the equivalent residue, His-214, helps to maintain the conformation of the catalytic Cys-215 and the structure of the phosphate binding loop (28Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1397-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). The conserved histidine may also affect protonation of the catalytic cysteine residues. In the Yersinia enterocolitica PTPase, changes in His-402 raised the pKa of the catalytic Cys-403 by disrupting the surrounding hydrogen bond network (29Stuckey J.A. Schubert H.L. Fauman E.B. Zhang Z.Y. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Nature. 1994; 370: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). These data strongly imply that the C76(X)5R82 motif in the yeast Acr2p arsenate reductase is involved in catalysis. Thus, Acr2p shares an active site motif with phosphatases, yet it does not exhibit phosphatase activity. It seems reasonable that the initial step in the two enzymatic reactions could utilize a common oxyanion binding site. In both cases, attack by the thiolate of the conserved cysteine residue would result in the formation of a thiol phosphate or a thiol arsenate bond. Considering that Acr2p is a homologue of PTPases and that the pI258 ArsC is a homologue of the low molecular weight acid protein-tyrosine phosphatases, it may be that all arsenate reductases are evolutionarily descended from phosphates, retaining remnants of the ancestral active site."

The receptor mediating the action of the mammalian bombesin (Bn) peptide, gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR), is an exception, because numerous classes of peptide antagonists are described. To investigate the molecular basis for their high affinity for the GRPR, two classes of peptide antagonists, a statine analogue, JMV594 ([d-Phe6,Stat13]Bn(6–14)), and a pseudopeptide analogue, JMV641 (d-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Leuψ(CHOH-CH2)-(CH2)2-CH3), were studied. Each had high affinity for the GRPR and >3,000-fold selectivity for GRPR over the closely related neuromedin B receptor (NMBR). To investigate the basis for this, we used a chimeric receptor approach to make both GRPR loss of affinity and NMBR gain of affinity chimeras and a site-directed mutagenesis approach. Chimeric or mutated receptors were transiently expressed in Balb/c 3T3. Only substitution of the fourth extracellular (EC) domain of the GRPR by the comparable NMBR domain markedly decreased the affinity for both antagonists. Substituting the fourth EC domain of NMBR into the GRPR resulted in a 300-fold gain in affinity for JMV594 and an 11-fold gain for JMV641. Each of the 11 amino acid differences between the GRPR and NMBR in this domain were exchanged. The substitutions of Thr297 in GRPR by Pro from the comparable position in NMBR, Phe302 by Met, and Ser305 by Thr decreased the affinity of each antagonist. Simultaneous replacement of Thr297, Phe302, and Ser305 in GRPR by the three comparable NMBR amino acids caused a 500-fold decrease in affinity for both antagonists. Replacing the comparable three amino acids in NMBR by those from GRPR caused a gain in affinity for each antagonist. Receptor modeling showed that each of these three amino acids faced inward and was within 5 Å of the putative binding pocket. These results demonstrate that differences in the fourth EC domain of the mammalian Bn receptors are responsible for the selectivity of these two peptide antagonists. They demonstrate that Thr297, Phe302, and Ser305 of the fourth EC domain of GRPR are the critical residues for determining GRPR selectivity and suggest that both receptor-ligand cation-π interactions and hydrogen bonding are important for their high affinity interaction.

Trends Neurosci. 1991; 14: 524-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Both the GRPR and NMBR are widely distributed in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues including in the GI tract (1Tache Y. Melchiorri P. Negri L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1988; 547: 1-541Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 35Lebacq-Verheyden A.M. Trepel J. Sausville E.A. Battey J.F. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 1990; 95: 71-124Crossref Google Scholar). Which of the widespread effects of these peptides (1Tache Y. Melchiorri P. Negri L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1988; 547: 1-541Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar) are important physiologically or in pathologic processes is largely unknown at present. The availability of potent Bn receptor subtype-specific antagonists and a molecular understanding of their basis of action are important steps in addressing these questions.In the present study, we have examined the molecular basis for the GRPR selectivity of two different classes of closely related high affinity Bn receptor peptide antagonists: a Bn statine analogue, JMV594 (36Llinares M. Devin C. Chaloin O. Azay J. Noel-Artis A.M. Bernad N. Fehrentz J.A. Martinez J. J. Pept. Res. 1999; 53: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and a Bn pseudopeptide analogue, JMV641 (37Azay J. Gagne D. Devin C. Llinares M. Fehrentz J.A. Martinez J. Regul. Pept. 1996; 65: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A receptor chimeric and site-directed mutagenesis approach was used to identify critical domain and amino acid(s) responsible for these antagonists' selectivity and high affinity for GRPR. In this study we show that the selectivity of peptide antagonists JMV594 and JMV641 for the GRPR over the NMBR depends primarily on interactions with amino acids in the fourth extracellular region of the GRPR. Site-directed mutagenesis studies demonstrate that Thr297, Phe302, and Ser305 in this region of GRPR are the critical amino acids for high affinity binding and selectivity of these two antagonists. Computer modeling of this region of the GRPR demonstrates that these amino acids all face inward forward the proposed binding pocket and are all within 5 Å of it, suggesting that cation-π and hydrogen bonding interactions between these antagonists and the above three amino acids are essential for receptor subtype selectivity and high affinity interaction.DISCUSSIONIn general, the roles of GPCRs mediating the action of most GI hormones/neurotransmitters in physiological or in pathological processes are still unclear. This is in large part because, for many, specific receptor antagonists do not exist, and for others, only recently have high affinity antagonists been developed (51Jensen R.T. Lewis J.H. Dubois A. Current Clinical Topics in Gastrointestinal Pharmacology. Blackwell Science, Inc., Malden, MA1997: 144-223Google Scholar). The antagonists for these receptors generally fall into one of three types: nonpeptide antagonists (the largest group); peptide antagonists; or, in a few cases, peptoid antagonists, which have features of both peptides and nonpeptides (52Horwell D.C. Howson W. Rees D.C. Drug Des. Discov. 1994; 12: 63-75PubMed Google Scholar, 53Horwell D.C. Trends Biotechnol. 1995; 13: 132-134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).

This has occurred in large part, because potent peptide antagonists have been described for only a few GI hormone/neurotransmitter receptors (51Jensen R.T. Lewis J.H. Dubois A. Current Clinical Topics in Gastrointestinal Pharmacology. Blackwell Science, Inc., Malden, MA1997: 144-223Google Scholar). One of these exceptions is GRPR, which mediates the actions of the mammalian bombesin-related peptide, GRP, in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues (1Tache Y. Melchiorri P. Negri L. Ann.

At present, for each of these peptide GRPR antagonists, their molecular basis of action (the molecular determinants of their receptor selectivity or for their high affinity receptor interaction) is unknown. In this study, we examined the molecular basis of action of two of the most potent GRPR peptide antagonists, the statine analogue, JMV594, and the pseudopeptide analogue, JMV641 (36Llinares M.

Each of the antagonists had >3,000-fold higher affinity for GRPR than NMBR, despite the fact that these receptors share an ∼50% overall amino acid identity (2Kroog G.S. Jensen R.T. Battey J.F. Med. Res. Rev. 1995; 15: 389-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 33Corjay M.H. Dobrzanski D.J. Way J.M. Viallet J. Shapira H. Worland P. Sausville E.A. Battey J.F. J. Biol.

The analyses of both the loss of affinity GRPR chimera and gain of affinity NMBR chimera support the conclusion that differences in the fourth extracellular domains of these two receptors play the major role in determining selectivity of these two different classes of peptide antagonists.This result has both similarities with and differences from studies on the interaction of peptide antagonists and agonists with other GPCRs. Studies of several GPCRs demonstrate that the receptor extracellular domains can be an important receptor region for determining high affinity ligand binding (63Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Graziano M.P. Tota M.R. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). However, only a few studies have explored whether the determinants of high affinity interaction or selectivity for a peptide antagonist are due to interactions with the receptor extracellular domains. Such an interaction is not important for determining high affinity interaction of the peptide antagonistd-Arg-[Hyp3,d-Phe7]bradykinin (NPC567) with the B2 bradykinin receptor (16Nardone J. Hogan P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4417-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) or BQ-123 with the endothelin A receptor (14Krystek Jr., S.R. Patel P.S. Rose P.M. Fisher S.M.

However, it is important for the high affinity interaction of the peptide antagonists JMV179 with the human CCK-A receptor (55Gigoux V. Escrieut C. Fehrentz J.A. Poirot S. Maigret B. Moroder L.

For a number of peptide GI receptor neurotransmitter/hormone agonists, high affinity receptor binding or receptor subtype selectivity depends on interaction with receptor extracellular domains, including CCK-8 with the CCK-A or CCK-B receptor (64Silvente-Poirot S. Escrieut C. Wank S.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 364-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), bradykinin with B2 bradykinin receptor (65Novotny E.A. Bednar D.L. Connolly M.A. Connor J.R.

Shapira H. Jensen R.T. Battey J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14622-14626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), endothelin (ET) with the ETA receptor (57Breu V. Hashido K. Broger C.

Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the high affinity interaction or selectivity is primarily determined by amino acids in the transmembrane regions. Similarly, with many nonpeptide antagonists such as the interaction of L365,260 with the CCK-B receptor (54Beinborn M. Lee Y.M. McBride E.W. Quinn S.M. Kopin A.S. Nature. 1993; 362: 348-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), losartan with the AT1B angiotensin II receptor (69Ji H. Leung M. Zhang Y. Catt K.J. Sandberg K. J. Biol.

Swain C.J., Yu, H. Ber E. Sadowski S. Wu M.T. Strader C.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 660-665PubMed Google Scholar), the extracellular domains do not contain determinants for high affinity interactions or receptor subtype selectivity.To determine which amino acids in the fourth extracellular domain of the GRPR account for the high affinity of these two antagonists for the GRPR and its selectivity for this receptor over the NMBR, we performed a comparative alignment of the amino acids in this region between the GRPR and the NMBR. Our results support the conclusion that the threonine residue in position 297 of GRPR instead of a proline in the NMBR, a phenylalanine in position 302 of GRPR instead of a methionine in NMBR, and a serine in position 305 of GRPR rather than a threonine in NMBR are the key amino acid differences responsible for the high affinity of the two peptides for the GRPR and their high selectivity for the GRPR over the NMBR. Whereas the individual replacement of these three amino acids caused only a 10-fold change in affinity for each antagonist, a combined substitution of these three residues by the comparable NMBR amino acids led to potentiated effect with a marked decrease in affinity (∼500-fold) for each of the antagonists. This result demonstrates that amino acid differences at the both the amino and carboxyl terminus of the fourth extracellular domain are involved in determining the high affinity and selectivity for the GRPR of both antagonists.This result has both similarities and differences from studies of binding of other peptide ligands to GI hormone/transmitter GPCRs. It is similar to results with interaction of the peptide antagonist [Sar1,Ile8]angiotensin II (18Hjorth S.A. Schambye H.T. Greenlee W.J. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30953-30959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the AT1 receptor, in which a cooperative interaction between His24, Tyr26, and Ile27 in the first extracellular domain is required for high affinity ligand interaction or for the peptide antagonistd-Arg-[Hyp3,d-Phe7]bradykinin's interaction with the B2 bradykinin receptor, in which the ligand's interaction with multiple amino acids in the sixth transmembrane domain is required for high affinity interaction and selectivity. Similarly, with almost all studies on peptide agonists, such as bradykinin's interaction with the bradykinin 1 or 2 receptor (65Novotny E.A. Bednar D.L. Connolly M.A. Connor J.R. Stormann T.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); CCK-8 interaction with the CCK-B receptor (64Silvente-Poirot S. Escrieut C. Wank S.A. Mol.

J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25664-25667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cooperative interactions with a number of residues in the same extracellular domain are required for high affinity interaction and selectivity for the one receptor subtype. In contrast to these cooperative interactions, with some peptide antagonists such as the interaction of the pentapeptide BQ123 with the ETA receptor (14Krystek Jr., S.R. Patel P.S. Rose P.M.

Treating HEK293 cells expressing ACVI with tunicamycin to block the addition ofN-linked oligosaccharide or removing theN-linked oligosaccharide by in vitropeptidyl-N-glycosidase F digestion reduced the molecular mass of ACVI. Furthermore, tunicamycin treatment suppressed the forskolin-stimulated activity of ACVI. Mutation of either one or both potential N-glycosylation sites (Asn805and Asn890, located on extracellular loops 5 and 6, respectively) also reduced the molecular mass of ACVI. Therefore, ACVI was glycosylated at both Asn805 and Asn890. Confocal analysis indicated that glycosylation was not required for the delivery of ACVI to the cell surface. Although no significant alterations in K m values for ATP or sensitivity to divalent cations were detected, the glycosylation-deficient ACVI mutant N805Q/N890Q-ACVI exhibited much lower forskolin-, Mn2+-, and Mg2+-stimulated cyclase activities than did wild-type ACVI. By contrast, the Gαs-stimulated cyclase activities of wild-type ACVI and N805Q/N890Q-ACVI were indistinguishable. Furthermore, compared with wild-type ACVI, N805Q/N890Q-ACVI was less sensitive to inhibition mediated by dopamine D2 receptors or by protein kinase C. Collectively, glycosylation of ACVI not only affected its catalytic activity in an activator-dependent manner, but also altered its ability to be regulated by a Gαi protein-coupled receptor or by protein kinase C.

To date, at least nine mammalian membrane-bound ACs have been isolated and characterized (1Tang W.-J. Hurley J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). All membrane-bound ACs contain two hydrophobic regions that comprise six transmembrane helices and three large cytoplasmic domains (N, C1a/b, and C2) (see Fig. 1). The basic catalytic unit is very conserved among ACs and is composed of the C1a and C2 domains (2Yan S.-Z. Huang Z.-H. Andrews R.K. Tang W.-J. Mol.

The α-subunit of the Gs protein (Gαs), which activates all membrane-bound ACs, at leastin vitro, was shown to interact with the catalytic complex of ACs at the C2 domain (5Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K.

On the contrary, the α-subunit of the Gi protein (Gαi) only effectively suppresses some of these membrane-bound AC isozymes (i.e. type I, V, and VI ACs) (7Taussig R. Tang W.-J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Gαi protein was reported to interact with the C1 domain of type V AC (3Dessauer C.W. Tesmer J.J.G. Sprang S.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25831-25839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domains of ACs are highly variable and were shown to play modulating roles (9Lai H.-L. Lin T.-H. Kao Y.-Y. Lin W.-J. Hwang M.-J. Chern Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 644-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar,10Gu C. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8012-8021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A recent study by Chen et al. (11Chen G. Sorkin A. Cooper D.M.F. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 185-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) suggests that the two tandem six-transmembrane segments are critical for the targeting and functional assembly of ACs. The regulatory roles of the transmembrane domains and of the six extracellular loops of ACs remain largely uncharacterized. Members of the AC superfamily are tightly controlled by various signals and therefore contribute significantly to the complexity and fine-tuning of cellular signaling mechanisms (12Chern Y. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We are particularly interested in type VI AC (ACVI) because we (9Lai H.-L. Lin T.-H. Kao Y.-Y. Lin W.-J. Hwang M.-J. Chern Y.

Moreover, ACVI exists mostly in neurons and thus might play a critical role in integrating multiple signals in the central nervous system (16Liu F.-C. Wu G.-C. Hsieh S.-T. Lai H.-L. Wang H.-F. Wang T.-W. Chern Y. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Protein phosphorylation is a very important regulatory mechanism of ACVI. We previously demonstrated that PKC-mediated phosphorylation suppresses the catalytic activity of ACVI and that the N-terminal domain of ACVI is required for this regulation (9Lai H.-L. Lin T.-H. Kao Y.-Y. Lin W.-J. Hwang M.-J. Chern Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 644-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 13Lai H.-L. Yang T.-H. Messing R.O. Ching Y.-H. Lin S.-C. Chern Y. J. Biol.

Except for protein phosphorylation, the effects of other potential post-translational modifications on the functional properties of ACVI have not been explored. The effect of glycosylation on ACs is of particular interest because alignment of the amino acid sequences of all membrane-bound ACs revealed a striking conservation of the locations of their potential glycosylation sites. As listed in TableI, all potential N-linked glycosylation sites of ACs are located on the predicted extracellular loop 5 and/or loop 6. Indeed, several AC isozymes (including type II, III, and type VIII ACs) were previously shown to be glycosylated (17Bol G.-F. Hulster A. Pfeuffer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1358: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 18Cali J.J. Parekh R.S. Krupinski J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24231-24235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The glycosylation state of type VIII AC affects its catalytic activity without altering its K m values or its calmodulin dependence (18Cali J.J. Parekh R.S. Krupinski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1089-1095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For type III AC, only the fully glycosylated (but not the non-glycosylated) enzyme can be phosphorylated by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase (19Wei J. Wayman G. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24231-24235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that ACVI is a glycoprotein. In addition, we define the sites (Asn805 and Asn890) of the N-linked glycosylation of ACVI. The results from this study suggest that the glycosylation state of ACVI significantly affects its catalytic activity in an activator-dependent manner and also alters the sensitivity of ACVI to the inhibition induced by a Gαi-coupled receptor or by PKC.Table IPotential glycosylation sites of all membrane-bound AC isoforms are located on extracellular loop 5 and/or loop 6AC isozymePotential glycosylation sitesLocationType I ACAsn706Extracellular loop 5Type II ACAsn712, Asn717Extracellular loop 5Type III ACAsn734Extracellular loop 5Asn827Extracellular loop 6Type IV ACAsn694, Asn701Extracellular loop 5Type V ACAsn871, Asn888Extracellular loop 5Asn973Extracellular loop 6Type VI ACAsn805Extracellular loop 5Asn890Extracellular loop 6Type VII ACAsn702Extracellular loop 5Type VIII ACAsn814, Asn818Extracellular loop 5Asn885Extracellular loop 6Type IX ACAsn955, Asn964Extracellular loop 6Sequences of type I–IX ACs were derived from the GenBank™/EBI Data Bank (accession numbers M25579.Gb_Om, M80550.Gb_Ro,M55075.Gb_Ro, M80633.Gb_Ro, M96159.Gb_Ro, M96160.Gb_Ro, U12919.Gb_Ro,L26986.Gb_Ro, and U30602.Gb_Ro, respectively).

Potential glycosylation sites were predicted using the GCG software program. Quinelorane (Quin) and CGS21680 were obtained from Research Biochemicals Inc. (Natick, MA). Forskolin, cAMP, and ATP were obtained from Sigma. Tunicamycin and N-glycosidase F were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). Protein kinase C was obtained from Calbiochem. MnCl2, MgCl2, and other chemicals were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Rat ACVI cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. R. Iyengar (20Premont R.T. Chen J. Ma H.-W. Ponnapalli M. Iyengar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9809-9813Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The potential N-linked glycosylation sites of rat ACVI were identified using the GCG software program (Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison, WI). Site-directed mutagenesis of Asn805 and Asn890 of ACVI was carried out using the Altered Sites® II in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mutant cDNA was cloned into a hygromycin-resistant vector (pCEP4, Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) using standard molecular biology techniques. HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) in an incubation chamber supplied with 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. The CHOP cell line (21Heffernan M. Dennis J.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. J. W. Dennis (Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). These CHOP cells were derived from the widely utilized Chinese hamster ovary cells, which express the polyoma large T antigen, and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 200 μg/ml Geneticin in 10% CO2 and 90% air. The coding region of wild-type ACVI or the desired ACVI variant was subcloned into pCEP4. Expression of ACVI in transfected cells was driven by the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early gene enhancer-promoter. The expression construct of the dopamine D2 receptor (D2-R) (22Huang C.-L. Chen H.-C. Huang N.-K. Yang D.-M. Kao L.-S. Chen J.-C. Lai H.-L. Chern Y. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2437-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. J.-C. Chen (Chang-Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan). The coding region of the rat adenosine A2A receptor (A2A-R) (23Chern Y. King K. Lai H.-L. Lai H.-T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 304-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) was subcloned into a eukaryotic expression vector (pcDNA3, Invitrogen) driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. To obtain HEK293 cells overexpressing ACVI, HEK293 cells were transfected with the desired construct using LipofectAMINETM (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. One day post-transfection, the cells were treated with hygromycin at 500 μg/ml for 2∼3 weeks to select clones that overexpressed the indicated ACVI variant as determined by Western blot analysis. Multiple colonies of HEK293 cells expressing the indicated ACVI were pooled together for further analysis. For transient transfection experiments, CHOP cells were transfected with the desired construct using the DEAE-dextran method (24Wong Y.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) or LipofectAMINE 2000TM (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol, which gave ∼40 and 80% transfection efficiencies, respectively. Cells were harvested 48–72 h post-transfection for analysis. Membrane fractions were separated on 8% separating gels according to the method of Laemmli (Ref. 25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar; see Ref. 13Lai H.-L.

Following electrophoresis, the gel was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, blocked with 5% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then incubated with the desired antiserum at 4 °C overnight. The polyclonal antibody AC6D was raised against amino acids 987∼1187 (the C2 domain) of ACVI (13Lai H.-L. Yang T.-H. Messing R.O. Ching Y.-H. Lin S.-C. Chern Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4970-4977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Typically, a 1:5000 dilution was used for AC6D unless stated otherwise. The membranes were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000 dilution;Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at room temperature and washed three times with PBS, and the immunoreactive bands were stained using a light-emitting nonradioactive method (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HEK293 cells expressing the indicated ACVI variant were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides and cultured in 6-well (35-mm) dishes. For immunofluorescence staining, cells were first fixed with ice-cold acetone. Slides were preincubated with 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and then stained with an anti-ACVI antibody (AC6D, 1:5000 dilution) (13Lai H.-L. Yang T.-H. Messing R.O. Ching Y.-H. Lin S.-C. Chern Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4970-4977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) in the presence of 3% normal goat serum at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were washed with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS, incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG at 37 °C for 30 min, washed with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and mounted in 50% glycerol in PBS. The pattern of ACVI immunostaining was studied with the aid of a laser confocal microscope (MRC-1000, Bio-Rad). Controls for the specificity of immunofluorescence were determined by omission of the primary antibody in the staining process, which resulted in a loss of immunofluorescence staining. Intracellular cAMP content was determined as described (26Brooker G. Harper J.F. Terasaki W.I. Moylan R.D. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1979; 10: 2-32Google Scholar, 27Chern Y. Lai H.-L. Fong J.C. Liang Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 950-958PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modification. For HEK293 cells expressing wild-type ACVI or an empty vector, cells were washed twice with Locke's solution (150 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES adjusted to pH 7.4) containing 0.5 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and resuspended in the same solution at 1 × 105 cells/0.45 ml in each 1.5-ml tube. To assess cAMP accumulation upon stimulation, 50 μl of 10-fold concentrated test reagent was added to each tube and gently mixed at room temperature for 10 min. Cells were then washed twice rapidly with ice-cold Locke's solution. We extracted cellular cAMP by adding 0.3 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and 20 mm Tris adjusted to pH 7.5) to each tube with gentle mixing. The cAMP content was assayed using the 125I-cAMP assay system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). cAMP accumulation resulting from activation of ACVI was determined as the difference between cAMP levels measured in HEK293 cells expressing wild-type ACVIversus an empty vector (pCEP4). For CHOP cells transiently transfected with the indicated cDNAs, cells were seeded ∼16 h before transfection at 3.9 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates and transfected with the desired construct(s) using the DEAE-dextran method (24Wong Y.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested for analysis 48–72 h post-transfection. To perform cAMP assays, cells were washed with Locke's solution containing 0.5 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and incubated in the same solution for 10 min at room temperature in the presence or absence of the indicated reagent(s). We extracted cellular cAMP by adding 0.3 ml of lysis buffer to each well with gentle mixing. The efficiency of transfection was monitored by cotransfection of the cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase plasmid as an internal control. β-Galactosidase activity was measured as described elsewhere (28Nielsen D.A. Chou J. Mackrell A.J. Casadaban M.J. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5198-5202Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) using o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside as the substrate. cAMP was assayed using the 125I-cAMP assay system and was normalized to the activity of β-galactosidase for transfection efficiency. cAMP accumulation resulting from activation of the indicated ACVI variant was determined as the difference between cAMP levels measured in HEK293 cells expressing the ACVI variant versus an empty vector (pCEP4). AC activity was assayed as previously described (27Chern Y. Lai H.-L. Fong J.C. Liang Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 950-958PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were sonicated using a W-380 sonicator (Ultrasonics, Farmingdale, NY) at a setting of 20% output power for a total of 90 s. The homogenate was centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 30 min to collect the P1 membrane fractions. Unless addressed specifically, the AC activity assay was performed at 37 °C for 10 min in a 400-μl reaction mixture containing 1 mm ATP, 100 mm NaCl, 0.4 units of adenosine deaminase, 50 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 6 mmMgCl2, 1 μm GTP, 0.2 mm EGTA, and 20 μg of membrane protein. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.6 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid. The cAMP formed was isolated by Dowex chromatography (Sigma) and assayed by radioimmunoassay. The enzyme activity was linear for up to 30 min with membrane proteins up to 40 μg. The ACVI activity was determined as the difference between the cyclase activities measured in the membrane fractions collected from HEK293 cells transfected with the indicated ACVI cDNA versus an empty vector (pCEP4). For HEK293 cells expressing wild-type ACVI, endogenous cyclase activities represented ∼30% of the total activity. The estimated concentration of Mg2+ was determined by subtraction of the ATP and EDTA concentrations from the total added MgCl2 concentration as described by Pieroni et al. (30Pieroni J.P. Harry A. Chen J. Jacobowitz O. Magnusson R.P. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21368-21373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The expression construct pQE60/H6-Gαs of the Gαs protein was a generous gift from Dr. W.-J. Tang (University of Chicago, Chicago, IL). The hexahistidine-tagged Gαs protein was expressed in Escherichia coliand purified using His·Bind® metal chelation resin (Novagen, Madison, WI) as described (2Yan S.-Z. Huang Z.-H. Andrews R.K. Tang W.-J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To stimulate AC activity, the indicated concentration of Gαs protein was activated by GTPγS (20 μm) in a 100-μl reaction mixture containing 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmdithiothreitol for 20 min at 20 °C. To carry out the protein phosphorylation study, membrane fractions collected from CHOP cells transiently transfected with the indicated ACVI variant using LipofectAMINE 2000TM were purified by immunoprecipitation using AC6D as previously described (13Lai H.-L. Yang T.-H. Messing R.O. Ching Y.-H. Lin S.-C. Chern Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4970-4977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Immunocomplexes were purified using Sephadex-conjugated protein A (Sigma) and then washed three times with ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mm Tris, pH 8). Phosphorylation by PKC was carried out in a final volume of a 0.1-ml reaction mixture containing 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.25% bovine serum albumin, 10 μm H-89, 50 μm ATP, 50 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, 1 Ci = 37 GBq; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 0.1 mm leupeptin, 40 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 30 nm okadaic acid, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, and 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The phosphorylation reaction was initiated by the addition of PKC (35 milliunits; Calbiochem) purified from rat brain for 60 min at 30 °C and terminated by three washes with ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and the addition of 2× SDS sample treatment buffer. Samples were then boiled for 5 min, analyzed by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and autoradiographed. Based on computer analysis of the amino acid sequence of rat ACVI (20Premont R.T. Chen J. Ma H.-W. Ponnapalli M. Iyengar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9809-9813Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), there are two potential glycosylation sites (Asn805and Asn890) (Fig. 1) that lie within the predicted extracellular loops 5 and 6 of ACVI. These sites are accessible to N-linked glycosylation enzymes in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen. Five other predicted glycosylation sites are unlikely to be functional because they are located in the cytosolic N (Asn160), C1a (Asn389), and C2 (Asn999, Asn1056, and Asn1124) domains of ACVI. To determine whether ACVI is indeed glycosylatedin vivo, HEK293 cells expressing ACVI were treated with tunicamycin to block N-linked glycosylation (31Elbein A.D. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 661-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Typically, an ACVI-specific immunoreactive band (128 kDa) was observed. Using tunicamycin (5 μg/ml) to block glycosylation, the size of this ACVI-immunoreactive band was significantly reduced to ∼119 kDa (Fig.2 A), suggesting that the higher electrophoretic mobility of ACVI might be due to deglycosylation. To verify this hypothesis, membranes expressing ACVI were deglycosylated with N-glycosidase F (Endo-F), which releases N-linked oligosaccharides by cleaving the bond between asparagine andN-acetyl-d-glucosamine. Deglycosylation of ACVI was carried out in the presence of different concentrations of Triton X-100 to ensure proper unfolding of ACVI so that all glycosylation sites were accessible to Endo-F (32Steube K. Gross V. Heinrich P.C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5587-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig. 2 B, incubation of ACVI with Endo-F in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100 increased the electrophoretic mobility of ACVI. These data suggest that ACVI expressed in HEK293 cells appears to be N-linked glycosylated. Interestingly, tunicamycin treatment reduced the forskolin-induced ACVI activity determined by cAMP accumulation (Fig. 2 C), implying that glycosylation of ACVI might play an important role in the functional properties of ACVI. Since tunicamycin abolishes glycosylation in all glycoproteins, caution should be taken in interpreting the effect of glycosylation using tunicamycin. The effect of Endo-F on ACVI activity was not examined because ACVI activities could no longer be detected after only a 1-h incubation in the buffer for Endo-F treatment (0.1% Triton X-100) in the absence of Endo-F (data not shown). This inactivation of ACVI was not due to protein degradation because intact ACVI proteins were observed via Western blot analysis under this experimental condition (data not shown). We therefore did not proceed with further purification or enzymatic analysis of Endo-F-treated ACVI. To further evaluate the role of glycosylation in the functional properties of ACVI, we then mutated either separately or simultaneously the two potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn805 and Asn890) from asparagine to glutamine and expressed wild-type ACVI and the indicated mutant of ACVI in HEK293 cells. On immunoblots of plasma membranes from HEK293 cells expressing the indicated ACVI variant, N805Q-ACVI and N890Q-ACVI exhibited lower molecular masses than did wild-type ACVI (Fig.3). In addition, a further reduction in molecular mass was observed for the double mutant (N805Q/N890Q-ACVI). Thus, both Asn805 and Asn890 are functionalN-linked glycosylation sites in vivo. Notably, the expression levels of wild-type ACVI and the three glycosylation-deficient mutants of ACVI in the plasma membrane fractions were similar (Fig. 3). Confocal analysis further showed that the expression patterns of wild-type ACVI and the glycosylation-deficient ACVI mutant N805Q/N890Q-ACVI were indistinguishable (Fig. 4). HEK293 cells overexpressing wild-type ACVI or N805Q/N890Q-ACVI were stained with an anti-ACVI antibody (AC6D) (13Lai H.-L. Yang T.-H. Messing R.O. Ching Y.-H. Lin S.-C. Chern Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4970-4977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). ACVI staining was observed at cell margins, indicating that ACVI was targeting plasma membranes. Perinuclear staining and intracellular distribution of both wild-type ACVI and N805Q/N890Q-ACVI were also found, suggesting that ACVI is located in intracellular organelles (e.g. the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus) during biosynthesis in transfected cells. No immunoreactive signals were observed in untransfected cells. Thus, N-linked oligosaccharide moieties are apparently not required for proper intracellular transport of ACVI. The enzymatic properties of wild-type ACVI and the glycosylation-deficient ACVI mutant N805Q/N890Q-ACVI were then assessed. Plasma membranes prepared from HEK293 cells expressing the indicated ACVI were assayed for AC activity. As shown in TableII, the apparent maximal forskolin-induced AC activity of N805Q/N890Q-ACVI was significantly lower than that of wild-type ACVI. Consistent with this observation, the Mn2+-stimulated cyclase activity of N805Q/N890Q-ACVI was markedly lower than that of wild-type ACVI (Fig.5 A). Mn2+ was shown to stimulate AC by interacting with the metal ion-binding sites in the catalytic core complex (33Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Johnson R.A. Gosselin G. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). We also examined the dose-dependent effect of Mg2+ on the forskolin-stimulated activity of wild-type ACVI and the glycosylation-deficient ACVI mutant. As shown in Fig. 5 B, N805Q/N890Q-ACVI exhibited much lower activity with Mg2+ in the presence of forskolin than did wild-type ACVI. The activities of wild-type ACVI and N805Q/N890Q-ACVI in the absence of forskolin were too low to assess the dose-dependent effect of Mg2+ accurately (data not shown). For both wild-type ACVI and N805Q/N890Q-ACVI, the stimulatory effect of Mn2+ and Mg2+ (in the presence of forskolin) was saturated at ∼5 and 9 mm, respectively. In contrast to the much lower cyclase activities of N805Q/N890Q-ACVI induced by forskolin or Mn2+ compared with those of wild-type ACVI, no significant difference in the apparent maximal Gαs-stimulated AC activity of N805Q/N890Q-ACVI or wild-type ACVI was observed.

Multiple, alternative, overlapping nucleosome positions were mapped on TAC-DNA. For the 58 positioned nucleosomes identified, the relative positioning strengths and the stabilities to salt and temperature were determined. These positions were, with a few exceptions, identical to those observed in native, remodeled TAC chromatin containing an activated CUP1 gene. Only some of these positions are utilized in native, unremodeled chromatin. These observations suggest that DNA sequence is likely to play a very important role in positioning nucleosomes in vivo.

We suggest that events occurring in yeastCUP1 chromatin determine which positions are occupiedin vivo and when they are occupied. base pair(s) upstream activating sequences micrococcal nuclease Eukaryotic DNA is packaged into chromatin, the basic structural repeat unit of which is the nucleosome. The nucleosome core contains 147 bp1 of DNA wrapped in about 1.75 superhelical turns around a central octamer composed of two each of the four core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Its structure has been solved at high resolution by x-ray crystallography (1Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6991) Google Scholar). In recent years, it has become clear that the nucleosome is not just a means of packaging large amounts of DNA into the nucleus but is also involved in regulation of gene expression (2Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2419) Google Scholar, 3Wolffe A.P. Chromatin. Ed. 3. Academic Press, London1999Google Scholar). The latter role stems from the fact that sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins often cannot recognize their sites when they are tightly wrapped in a nucleosome. The solution to this problem apparently resides in the activities of the many different chromatin remodeling and histone acetylase complexes recently identified. These facilitate the disruption or displacement of nucleosomes, allowing factors to bind, transcription complexes to form, and RNA polymerase II to initiate transcription. One of the most interesting aspects of nucleosome structure is that the histone octamer does not bind to DNA randomly but exhibits preferences for some sequences over others, a phenomenon referred to as nucleosome positioning (4Simpson R.T. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 143-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 5Wallrath L.L. Lu Q. Granok H. Elgin S.C.R. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Positioning is actually determined by the central H3-H4 tetramer (6Dong F. van Holde K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10596-10600Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The translational position of a nucleosome is defined by the 147-bp DNA sequence it occupies (see Ref.7Lowary P.T. Widom J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1183-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar for a detailed analysis). The affinity of the histone octamer for a particular 147-bp DNA sequence defines its positioning strength. Strongly positioned nucleosomes are those that contain sequences that bind the octamer much more tightly than neighboring sequences. There are many examples of these, the most well known being the 5 S RNA gene (8Simpson R.T. Stafford D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). There is a great deal of evidence for the importance of positioned nucleosomes in gene regulation (4Simpson R.T. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 143-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In budding yeast, the best studied example is that of the four nucleosomes positioned on thePHO5 promoter that are disrupted or displaced when the gene is activated for transcription (9Svaren J. Hörz W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 93-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).

We have shown recently that nucleosome repositioning also occurs in vivoand that this process requires the presence of the transcriptional activator (20Shen C.-H. Leblanc B.P. Alfieri J.A. Clark D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 534-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We have adopted CUP1 as a model for understanding the role of chromatin structure in gene regulation. It encodes a metallothionein responsible for protecting cells from the toxic effects of excess copper ions (21Butt T.R. Sternberg E.J. Gorman J.A. Clark P. Hamer D. Rosenberg M. Crooke S.T. Proc.

Cell. 1988; 55: 705-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 24Buchman C. Skroch P. Welch J. Fogel S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4091-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar): the N-terminal domain of a transcriptional activator, Ace1p (also called Cup2p), exhibits copper-dependent DNA binding at upstream activating sequences (UASs) in the CUP1 promoter. Ace1p activates transcription through its C-terminal acidic activation domain. TheCUP1 promoter also contains two consensus TATA boxes (25Culotta V.C. Hsu T. Hu S. Fürst P. Hamer D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8377-8381Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and an initiation element (26Leblanc B.P. Benham C.J. Clark D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10745-10750Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Recently, we described the native chromatin structure of a 2468-bp plasmid, TAC, purified from yeast cells, which contains CUP1inserted into TRP1ARS1, an autonomously replicating yeast plasmid (20Shen C.-H. Leblanc B.P. Alfieri J.A. Clark D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 534-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Nucleosome positions were mapped over the entire TAC sequence using the monomer extension technique (27Yenidunya A. Davey C. Clark D.J. Felsenfeld G. Allan J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), revealing a complex chromatin structure with multiple, overlapping nucleosome positions (see Fig. 4 A for a summary). In the presence of copper-activated Ace1p, 48 positioned nucleosomes were mapped in TAC minichromosomes. In its absence, the chromatin structure was simplified by the elimination of 16 of the positions on CUP1 and immediate flanking regions. The nucleosomes remaining onCUP1 were organized in clusters of positions separated by linker DNA of various lengths. It was proposed that Ace1p recruits a remodeling complex to the CUP1 promoter, which then directs the repositioning of nucleosomes over the entire gene and its flanking sequences. Here, we have investigated the role of DNA sequence in determining nucleosome positions in vivo by comparing the positions adopted by nucleosomes reconstituted on TAC-DNA in vitrousing purified core histones with those in native TAC chromatin. We demonstrate that the positions adopted by reconstituted nucleosomesin vitro are very similar to those observed in native, remodeled TAC minichromosomes. The nucleosomes positioned on inactive, unremodeled CUP1 represent a restricted subset of the same positions. Thus, DNA sequence plays a major role in determining nucleosome positions in yeast CUP1 chromatin. The 261-bpSpeI-BsrGI CUP1 promoter fragment was obtained from pCP2 (20Shen C.-H. Leblanc B.P. Alfieri J.A. Clark D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 534-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The fragment was treated with phosphatase, purified from a gel, and end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Reconstitution was as described (28Clark D.J. Felsenfeld G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), with modifications as follows. Labeled DNA fragment (4 μg) was mixed with chicken erythrocyte core histones at a ratio of 0.9 histone octamer per DNA fragment in a final volume of 300–400 μl of 2 m NaCl, 10 mmHEPES-Na (pH 7.5), 1 mm Na-EDTA, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF). For reconstitution of pGEM-TAC (20Shen C.-H. Leblanc B.P. Alfieri J.A. Clark D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 534-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), 6 μg of purified core histones were mixed with either 10 or 40 μg of DNA (high and low input ratios, respectively) in a final volume of 400 μl of buffer as above. The mixture was dialyzed into the same buffer containing 5 m urea overnight at 4 °C, using SpectraPor 7 dialysis tubing (molecular weight cut off = 8000). The next day, the NaCl concentration was reduced in steps by dialysis for 1 h each into 1.2, 1.0, 0.8, and 0.6 m NaCl in the same buffer. The urea was removed by dialysis into 0.6 m NaCl for about 3 h. Finally, the salt was removed by dialysis overnight into 10 mm HEPES-Na (pH 7.5), 1 mm Na-EDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm AEBSF (HEM1 buffer). Reconstitutes were stored at 4 °C. Nucleosomes reconstituted on the CUP1 promoter fragment were analyzed in native polyacrylamide gels (29Studitsky V.M. Clark D.J. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1994; 76: 371-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Reconstitutes were adjusted to 10 μg of DNA/ml in 40 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES-Na (pH 7.5), 1 mm Na-EDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm AEBSF and warmed briefly to 37 °C. Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) (Worthington) was added to 0.1 unit/μg of DNA, and 300-μl aliquots were removed after 1, 2, 3, and 6 min at 37 °C. EDTA was added to 10 mm, SDS to 1%, and potassium acetate to 1 m. DNA was extracted with chloroform and precipitated with isopropanol in the presence of 20 μg of glycogen. Core DNA was purified from a 6% (19:1) polyacrylamide gel (the time point with a tight core DNA size distribution was chosen; usually 3 min). For the experiments shown in Fig. 3, pGEM-TAC reconstituted at low histone:DNA ratio was concentrated using a Centricon-30 device (Millipore) prewashed with HEM1 buffer containing 10 μg of bovine serum albumin (to prevent adsorption of chromatin to the filter). Aliquots containing 4 μg of DNA were adjusted to about 150 μg/ml on ice with an equal volume of the same buffer (ice-cold) containing 80, 300, or 1200 mmNaCl to give final concentrations of 40, 150, and 600 mm, respectively. One aliquot of each was placed at 37 °C, and another was left on ice for 2 h. The samples were then diluted to 10 μg of DNA/ml with buffer at the same temperature to give a final salt concentration of 40 mm and a final CaCl2concentration of 2 mm. All samples were warmed briefly to 37 °C and digested with MNase as above. Monomer extension mapping of reconstituted and native TAC chromatin was performed as described (20Shen C.-H. Leblanc B.P. Alfieri J.A. Clark D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 534-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Nucleosomes were reconstituted by salt/urea dialysis (28Clark D.J. Felsenfeld G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) on an end-labeled 261-bp BsrGI-SpeI DNA fragment containing the CUP1 promoter, including both TATA boxes and the upstream activating sequences, using purified chicken erythrocyte core histones. Chicken histones were used rather than the ideal choice of yeast histones because of technical difficulties we encountered in preparing intact yeast histones. The products of reconstitution were analyzed in a native gel that preserves nucleosomal structure (Fig.1 A). Nucleosomes migrate in these gels according to their position with respect to the center of the fragment; nucleosomes positioned at one end of a fragment migrate faster than those at the center (29Studitsky V.M. Clark D.J. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1994; 76: 371-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 30Meersseman G. Pennings S. Bradbury E.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2951-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Thus, the major, fast migrating band represents nucleosomes positioned close to the end of the DNA fragment, and the slower, less intense band represents nucleosomes in more central positions. The most slowly migrating band is probably a histone-DNA aggregate. To determine their precise positions, reconstituted nucleosomes were completely digested to core particles using MNase. Core particle DNA (∼147 bp) was extracted, purified from a gel and end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase. The positions were determined by restriction mapping (29Studitsky V.M. Clark D.J. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1994; 76: 371-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 31Clark D.J. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1992; 71: 11-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). When core DNA is digested with a unique restriction enzyme, two end-labeled fragments adding up to about 147 bp are obtained. A double digest is performed to determine which of the two fragments represents DNA upstream and downstream of the restriction site, using a second enzyme that cuts only one of the two fragments. Undigested core particle DNA (Fig. 1 B, lane 1) migrated as a tight band adjacent to the 147-bp band in the marker, as expected. To determine the positions of nucleosomes located near theBsrGI end of the fragment, core DNA was digested withMfeI (Fig. 1 B, lane 2), MseI (lane 3), or both enzymes (lane 4). Two main bands of 132 and 14 bp were obtained with MseI, adding up to 146 bp. The MseI site is only 15 bp from theBsrGI end of the DNA, and so the 132-bp fragment must derive from the other end; this nucleosome is positioned right at theBsrGI end of the fragment (Fig. 1 C, nucleosome 1). Digestion of core DNA with MfeI gave rise to many bands, the most intense of which were 52–57, 62–66, 72, 76, 84, and 92–97 bp. These can be paired as follows to give totals of about 147 bp: 72 with 76 (totaling 148 bp), 84 with 62–66 (146–150 bp), and 92–97 with 52–57 (144–154 bp). Clusters of bands (e.g. 52–57 bp) were assumed to reflect different degrees of trimming of the same core particle by MNase. The first pair of bands corresponds to nucleosome 1; the 76-bp band is sensitive to MseI (Fig.1 B, lane 4) and so maps to the BsrGI end of the fragment. The second pair of bands (84 and 66) derives from a nucleosome at 11–157 (nucleosome 2; the 84-bp fragment must derive from the SpeI side of the MfeI site because there are only 73 bp on the other side). The third pair of bands (97 and 52–57 bp) defines nucleosome 3 at 21–170. The MfeI digest also gave rise to some weak bands at 21, 26, 34, 42–47, 105, 112, 121, and 128 bp, corresponding to nucleosomes 4–7 (Fig. 1 C). To determine the positions of nucleosomes located near theSpeI end of the fragment, core DNA was digested withXbaI (Fig. 1 B, lane 5), AlwNI (lane 6), or both enzymes (lane 7). The major bands in the XbaI digest (lane 5) were 85 and 63 bp (totaling 148 bp). Because the XbaI site is only 66 bp from the SpeI end and the 63-bp band is sensitive toAlwNI (lane 7), this nucleosome must be positioned at 110–258 (Fig. 1 C, nucleosome 10). The major bands (20–23 and 118 bp) in the AlwNI digest (Fig.1 B, lane 6) also correspond to this nucleosome. Nucleosome 9 at 99–242 is defined by the 96- and 47–54-bp bands (147–150 bp) in Fig. 1 B, lane 5, and the 130- and 15-bp bands in lane 6. Nucleosome 8 at 77–221 is defined by the 118- and 31-bp bands (144 bp) in lane 5. Quantitative analysis using a phosphorimager indicated that nucleosome 10 is the most dominant position, representing about 30% of nucleosomes. Nucleosomes 1, 2, 3, 8, and 9 accounted for 10–20% each. Nucleosomes 4–7 are relatively weak (only about 2% each). Nucleosomes 1, 2, and 3 might be rotationally related, because their positions differ by units of about 10 bp, the helical repeat of DNA. Nucleosomes 8, 9, and 10 might also be rotationally related. In conclusion, thisCUP1 promoter fragment contains six strong and four weak nucleosome positioning signals. The nucleosome positions mapped on the CUP1promoter fragment were compared with those mapped previously on a plasmid containing CUP1 purified as native chromatin from yeast cells (20Shen C.-H. Leblanc B.P. Alfieri J.A. Clark D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 534-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This 2468-bp minichromosome TRP1ARS1CUP1(TAC) contained CUP1 inserted into the autonomously replicating yeast TRP1ARS1 plasmid. There were four positioned nucleosomes present on the SpeI-BsrGI region in native TAC, which were numbered 25–28. Taking into account the standard errors reported by Shen et al. (20Shen C.-H. Leblanc B.P. Alfieri J.A. Clark D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 534-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) (which reflect the difficulty of obtaining completely trimmed core particles from native chromatin), nucleosome 25 corresponds to reconstituted nucleosomes 1, 2, and perhaps 3. Nucleosome 26 in TAC corresponds to reconstituted nucleosomes 6 and 7. Nucleosomes 27 and 28 in TAC correspond to reconstituted nucleosomes 9 and 10, respectively. Thus, reconstituted nucleosomes adopted very similar positions to nucleosomes in native chromatin containing the CUP1 promoter. The next step was to determine to what extent this was true for the entire TAC sequence. The positions adopted by nucleosomes reconstituted on the entire TAC sequence were mapped using the monomer extension method, which is ideal for long range mapping and can resolve arrays of overlapping positions in complex chromatin structures, without ambiguity (20Shen C.-H. Leblanc B.P. Alfieri J.A. Clark D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 534-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 27Yenidunya A. Davey C. Clark D.J. Felsenfeld G. Allan J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 32Davey C. Pennings S. Meersseman G. Wess T.J. Allan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11210-11214Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 33Davey C. Pennings S. Allan J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Nucleosomes were reconstituted on pGEM-TAC, a plasmid that contains the 2468-bp TAC sequence inserted using the HindIII site inside the TRP1 open reading frame (20Shen C.-H. Leblanc B.P. Alfieri J.A. Clark D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 534-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A map of TAC is shown in Fig. 2 B; coordinates (1–2468) are numbered from the HindIII site, in the direction ofTRP1 transcription. The reconstitute was digested completely with MNase to obtain core particles. Core DNA (147–160 bp) was purified from a gel and end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase. Labeled core DNA was used as primer for extension by Klenow enzyme with single-stranded pGEM-TAC DNA as template. The replicated DNA was digested with different restriction enzymes (with unique sites) to resolve different regions of TAC. The lengths of the resulting DNA fragments were determined accurately in sequencing gels: each band defines the distance from the border of a nucleosome to the chosen restriction site. A control for sequence-dependent termination by Klenow enzyme involves omission of the restriction enzyme. The borders of each nucleosome were located precisely, one using the + strand as template, the other using the – strand. The data from one template strand define all of the “upstream” nucleosome borders unambiguously and are sufficient to define the chromatin structure. The other strand should give the same nucleosome positions, this time defined by the “downstream” borders. The degree to which the two sets of positioning data are consistent can be assessed by calculating the average distance between the nucleosome borders, which should be close to 147 bp, the size of the core particle. A slight underdigestion of chromatin by MNase results in core particles that are not completely trimmed to 147 bp. Consequently, bands close together are likely to represent different degrees of trimming of the same positioned nucleosome. In the analysis, clusters of bands within 10 bp were assumed to derive from the same nucleosome. If core particles are overdigested by MNase, nicks begin to appear. Labeled core DNA was routinely checked in denaturing gels; the size range was typically 140–160 bp, with little nicking. In any case, nicking would not affect the result, because kinase does not label nicks, and end-labeled nicked DNA strands liberated on denaturation of core DNA would give the correct result on extension. Nucleosomes were reconstituted at high and low histone:DNA ratios, corresponding to 1 histone octamer per 260 or 1000 bp, respectively. Reconstitution at low ratios is expected to limit the influence of possible nucleosome-nucleosome interactions on positioning (27Yenidunya A. Davey C. Clark D.J. Felsenfeld G. Allan J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Monomer extension mapping for the entire TAC insert is presented in Fig. 2 and data from several experiments are summarized in Table I. A total of 58 positioned nucleosomes were identified on the TAC sequence, many of which are overlapping and therefore mutually exclusive. The average distance between matched borders (Table I) was 148 ± 8 bp, as expected for core particle DNA. This indicates that the chromatin structures mapped in the analysis of each strand are in agreement. The band intensities (Fig. 2) were normalized to the strongest positions in the list, which were assigned a value of 10. Strongly positioned nucleosomes 1 and 2 (Table I) both include the ABF1 binding site (coordinates 104–160), a naturally bent DNA in ARS1 (34Snyder M. Buchman A.R. Davis R.W. Nature. 1986; 324: 87-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar); bent DNA typically positions nucleosomes strongly. There was a 10-fold range in positioning strength. The histone:DNA ratio had no effect on nucleosome positioning (compare pairs of lanes in Fig. 2 A), suggesting that nucleosome-nucleosome interactions, if they are occurring, have little influence on positioning.Table IComparison of nucleosome positions in reconstituted and native TAC chromatinNucleosome positionTAC coordinates in vitroTAC coordinates (native chromatin)Positioning strength at 4 °C, 40 mmsaltEffects of salt and temperature 1.24–160 1. 14–16410 2.123–285 3. 131–2779Enhanced at 0.6 m, 37 °C 3.209–345 5. 197–3521 4.247–398 6. 244–3902 5.274–414 7. 292–4531 6.339–4701 7.389–535 8. 410–5452Lost at 37 °C 8.414–563 8. 410–5453Enhanced at 0.6m, 37 °C 9.429–586 9. 441–5912Lost at 37 °C10.490–63010. 487–642311.523–669612.579–722813.670–82112. 666–8189Lost at 37 °C14.733–87713. 739–889715.779–92714. 782–924616.827–97815. 840–995117.879–103016. 872–1028418.947 –17. 923–1073–Appears at 0.6m, 37 °C19.963–111318. 964–1120320.993–1148421.1048–119519. 1028–1188222.1098–12402Lost at 37 °C23.1133–127320. 1143–12911024.1153–130820. 1143–12916Lost at 40/150 mm, 37 °C25.1170–13272Reduced at 37 °C26.1200–134321. 1196–1347327.1235–138722. 1238–1394328.1291–143823. 1269–1429229.1314–147324. 1311–1464530.1341–1487831.1365–151125. 1367–15163Enhanced at 0.6 m, 37 °C32.1389–1546333.1432–156926. 1413–15522Reduced at 0.6 m on ice34.1458–159727. 1454–1595135.1469–160528. 1479–1651736.1483 –28. 1479–16511Enhanced at 0.6 m, 37 °C37.1502–164928. 1479–16512Enhanced at 0.6 m, 37 °C38.1516–1669239.1558–170329. 1550–1690240.1670–182432. 1651–1810141.1704–184933. 1695–1866342.1747–189334. 1748–1893143.1795–195035. 1789–1939244.1809–1974245.1837–199436. 1842–2005246.1864–201536. 1842–2005447.1919–205637. 1903–2052348.1962–210038. 1973–2106349.1974–211938. 1973–2106150.1999–2156251.2034–217939. 2035–2179252.2071–221440. 2071–2227453.2126–228941. 2123–2268254.2164 –42. 2163–2311355.2177 –43. 2185–23462Reduced at 0.15, 0.6 m, 37 °C56.2217–236944. 2221–2373357.2247–239545. 2247–24112Reduced at 0.15, 0.6m, 37 °C58.2269–241946. 2270 –1The table includes data from multiple monomer extension mapping experiments using both + and − strands and different restriction enzymes, as in Fig. 2.

Monomer extension analysis of the CUP1 promoter region is in broad agreement with the analysis presented in Fig. 1. Five positioned nucleosomes were observed at + borders 1365, 1389, 1432, 1458, and 1469 (see the BamHI lanes in Fig. 2 A; positions 31–35 in Table I), corresponding to nucleosomes 2/3, 5, 8, 9, and 10 on the promoter fragment, respectively. Nucleosome 1 on the promoter fragment (Fig. 1 C) was not detected on the plasmid, perhaps reflecting end-effects on the fragment. Nucleosome 3 (Fig.1 C) is probably represented by a band at 1375 (Fig.2 A), but this is too close to the band at 1365 to be certain that it is a different nucleosome (as discussed above, in the monomer extension analysis, all bands"
https://openalex.org/W2160330498,"Programmed cell death by thehok/sok locus of plasmid R1 relies on a complex translational control mechanism. The highly stablehok mRNA is activated by 3′-end exonucleolytical processing. Removal of the mRNA 3′ end releases a 5′-end sequence that triggers refolding of the mRNA. The refolded hok mRNA is translatable but can also bind the inhibitory Sok antisense RNA. Binding of Sok RNA leads to irreversible mRNA inactivation by an RNase III-dependent mechanism. A coherent model predicts that during transcription hokmRNA must be refractory to translation and antisense RNA binding. Here we provide genetic evidence for the existence of a 5′ metastable structure in hok mRNA that locks the nascent transcript in an inactive configuration in vivo. Consistently, the metastable structure reduces the rate of Sok RNA binding and completely blocks hok translation in vitro. Structural analyses of native RNAs strongly support that the 5′ metastable structure exists in the nascent transcript. Further structural analyses reveal that the mRNA 3′ end triggers refolding of the mRNA 5′ end into the more stable tac-stem conformation.

Accordingly, the question of how the linear sequence of ribonucleotides dictates the overall folding of an RNA has received much attention (1Westhof E. Masquida B. Jaeger L.

Folding of RNA, whether occurring from a denatured state or sequentially in concomitance with its synthesis, involves the formation of a number of hierarchically ordered intramolecular interactions leading to increasing levels of structural organization. In both cases, structural rearrangements of kinetically favored folding intermediates may occur before the thermodynamically most stable conformation is reached (7Kramer F.R. Mills D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 5109-5124Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar,8Pan J. Thirumalai D. Woodson S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In the course of folding, RNA molecules face the risk of being trapped in nonequilibrium conformations. Because of the high thermodynamic stability of RNA secondary structures, rearrangement of such nonequilibrium conformations can constitute a substantial energy barrier, thus leading to kinetic trapping of the RNA in thermodynamically suboptimal conformations termed metastable structures (9Walstrum S.A.

The hok/sok locus of plasmid R1 mediates plasmid maintenance by the killing of plasmid-free cells, also termed post-segregational killing (PSK)1 (24Gerdes K. Gultyaev A.P. Franch T. Pedersen K. Mikkelsen N.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The PSK mechanism, which restricts synthesis of Hok toxin to newborn plasmid-free cells, is controlled entirely at the post-transcriptional level. The hok/sok locus, presented schematically in Fig. 1, specifies two transcripts: the toxin-encoding hok (hostkilling) mRNA and the labile antisense inhibitor Sok RNA (suppression of killing).mok (mediator of killing) is a reading frame, the translation of which is required for the translation of Sok (because of translational coupling ofhok to mok). Sok RNA is complementary to the hok mRNA 5′ end and inhibitshok translation indirectly by occluding themok ribosome-binding site (25Franch T. Gultyaev A.P. Gerdes K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 38-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Full-length versions of hok mRNA (1 and 2) are unusually stable because of extensive secondary structure formation and specific base pairings between their 5′ and 3′ ends (26Franch T. Gerdes K. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The structure ofhok-2 mRNA is shown in Fig.2 B. The 5′-to-3′ base pairing in the full-length molecules yields compact structures, andhok mRNA-1 and -2 are inactive with respect to translation and antisense RNA binding (25Franch T. Gultyaev A.P. Gerdes K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 38-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 26Franch T. Gerdes K. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 27Gerdes K.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1950-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Translation ofhok mRNA-2 is activated by slow 3′-exonucleolytical removal of the fbi (fold-back inhibition) element (Fig. 2 B). The 3′ processing releases the 5′ tac (translational activator) element and thereby triggers a series of structural rearrangements prerequisite for translation and rapid Sok RNA binding (27Gerdes K. Thisted T. Martinussen J. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1807-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 28Thisted T. Nielsen A.K. Gerdes K.

Thus, the activated refolded hok mRNA contains the energy-rich tac stem and the antisense RNA target hairpin (Fig. 2 C), the latter of which is required both for translation and rapid antisense RNA binding (25Franch T. Gultyaev A.P. Gerdes K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 38-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 26Franch T. Gerdes K. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 29Thisted T. Sorensen N.S. Wagner E.G. Gerdes K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1960-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 30Gultyaev A.P. Franch T. Gerdes K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 26-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The presence of tac in the mRNA 5′ end suggested the existence of a regulatory element that would prevent initiation of translation during transcription. Nucleotide covariations in the aligned family ofhok mRNAs indicated that the mRNAs could form small metastable hairpins at their 5′ ends (30Gultyaev A.P. Franch T. Gerdes K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 26-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, the function of these hairpins is not known. Here we present evidence thathok mRNA specifies a structure that simultaneously prevents antisense RNA binding and synthesis of Hok toxin during transcription. This molecular safeguard consists of two small metastable hairpins at the mRNA 5′ end (Fig. 2 A). During transcription, the metastable hairpins prevent formation of the tac stem and ultimately inhibit formation of the target hairpin. Our data indicate that the metastable hairpins exist until completion of transcription and that their disruption is triggered by the fbi sequence at the mRNA 3′ end. Thus, we reveal here thathok mRNA follows a specific folding pathway that seems to have evolved to allow translation of hok in plasmid-free cells only. Ampicillin was added to a concentration of 30 μg/ml for mini-R1 plasmids and 100 μg/ml otherwise. Rifampicin (Ciba-Geigy) was added to cells prior to RNA extraction at a concentration of 250 μg/ml. Restriction endonucleases were purchased from Roche. All other enzymes were purchased from Promega. The partially Hok-resistantEscherichia coli mutant strain NWL37 (HokR, CmlR, KanR) (31Poulsen L.K. Larsen N.W. Molin S. Andersson P. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was used for the establishment of plasmids carrying mutated hok/sokloci. The E. coli K-12 strain CSH50 (Δ(lac pro)rpsL) (32) was used for plasmid stability tests (33Gerdes K. Larsen J.E. Molin S. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 292-298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and rifampicin induction experiments. Both strains were cultured in Luria-Bertani broth (34Bertani G. J. Bacteriol. 1951; 62: 293-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at 37 °C. Plasmid pPR633 carries the 580-base pair wild-typehok/sok locus from plasmid R1 cloned between the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pBR322. Plasmids pJMJ210 (U21A), pJMJ216 (A9U), and pJMJ218 (U21A/A9U) are mutant derivatives of pPR633. The probe plasmid, pGEM342, carries thehok/sok 240 base pairs downstreamSau3A-EcoRI fragment cloned under the T7 promoter of pGEMblue. The U21A,A9U, and U21A/A9U mutations were introduced using double PCR as described in Ref. 35Barettino D. Feigenbutz M. Valcarcel R. Stunnenberg H.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 541-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar using the following primers: −20 primer, 5′-GTAAAACGACGGCCAGT; EcoRI clockwise, 5′-GTATCACGAGGCCCTTTCG; U21A, 5′-CACGTCATGTGGCAGAAAGCC; and A9U, 5′-GGCAGAAAGCCACAAGCGCCGGGCAC (mutant nucleotides are printed in bold face). The preparation of total RNA from E. coli and Northern transfer analysis were performed as described previously (27Gerdes K. Thisted T. Martinussen J. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1807-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The preparation and purification of uniformly 3H- or32P-labeled RNA molecules were performed essentially as described by Franch and Gerdes (26Franch T. Gerdes K. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The RNA species were synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase and templates generated by PCR. In all PCRs, pPR633 was used as template. The T7 promoter region and wild-type mRNA 5′ end was specified by the upstream oligonucleotide T7-hok, 5′-TGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGCGCTTGAGGC, whereas the upstream oligonucleotides of hok metastable andhok super-tac was T7-meta, 5′-TGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGCGCTTGAGGCTTTCTGCCTCAAGCGCCAAGGTGGTTTGTTGCC, and T7-perfect, 5′-CGGGATCCTGTATACGACTCACTATAGGGGCTA- TCTTCTTTCTGCCTCATGACGTGAAGGTGG, respectively. The downstream oligonucleotides specifying the 3′ end of the RNA run-off transcripts were: T7-3N, 5′-AAGGCGGGCCTGCGCCCGCCTCCAGG for truncated molecules; T7-4, 5′-AAGGCGCTTCAGTAGTCAG forhok mRNA-2; and T7-2, 5′-GCAAGGAGAAAGGGGCTAC forhok mRNA-1. Sok RNA was prepared as described elsewhere (36Dam M.N. Gerdes K. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used to generate PCR templates for Sok RNA synthesis were T7-sok wild type, 5′-CGGGATCCTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGACTAGACATAGGGATG- CCTCG, and NDM8, 5′-AGAAGATAGCCCCGTAGTAA. Translation of purified and native wild-type and mutated truncated hok mRNAs was performedin vitro by use of the E. coli-coupled transcription/translation system (37Zubay G. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1973; 7: 267-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) purchased from Promega. For translational analysis of native mRNA in vitro, mRNA was synthesized from purified PCR-generated templates by T7 RNA polymerase. RNA synthesis was performed by incubation of 5 pmol of DNA template with 10 mm DTT, 40 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 6 mm MgCl2, 2 mm spermidine, 10 mm NaCl, 16 μm CTP, 10 μCi of [α-32P]CTP, 18 units of RNAguard (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 15 units of T7 RNA polymerase for 12 min at room temperature. After incubation, 2-μl aliquots were transferred to prewarmed E. coli S30 extract followed by the addition of 0.2 μml-[35S]methionine. Sample preparation and subsequent SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out as described by Franch and Gerdes (26Franch T. Gerdes K. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Binding experiments were performed as described previously (25Franch T. Gultyaev A.P. Gerdes K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 38-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). DNA templates for in vitro transcription were prepared by PCR. The PCR templates were identical to those used for the purification of labeled in vitro transcripts (as described above). PCR products were purified by a PCR purification kit (Qiagen), extracted with phenol/CHCl3, and precipitated with NH4OAc and ethanol. Transcription assays were carried out by incubation of 5 pmol of DNA template with 10 mm DTT, 40 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 6 mm MgCl2, 2 mmspermidine, 10 mm NaCl, 16 μm of CTP, 10 μCi of [α-32P]CTP, 125 mm GTP and UTP, 18 units of RNAguard (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 20 units of T7 RNA polymerase for 8 min at room temperature. After incubation, 125 mm ATP was added to the preincubation mixture for initiation of transcription. Four-microliter aliquots were removed for RNase H probing at various time points after the initiation of transcription. Probing mixtures contained 4 μl of transcription mix, TMK-glutamate (see above) supplemented with 5 mm DTT, 10 pmol of DNA oligo, and 1 unit of RNase H. After 30 s of probing, samples were frozen in dry ice/ethanol, extracted with phenol/CHCl3, and precipitated. The transcripts were redissolved in formamide dye and analyzed by autoradiography on a 6% denaturing acrylamide gel. The oligonucleotide sequence used was 5′-CCTCGTGGTG. As a molecular marker, uniformly 32P-labeled purified truncated hok mRNA (100 fmol) was equilibrated in TMK-glutamate buffer (see above) supplemented with 5 mmDTT for 3 min at 37 °C prior to cleavage with RNase H. PCR-generated templates for RNA synthesis were prepared as described above. Native RNA transcripts were generated by incubating 5 pmol of DNA template with 10 mm DTT, 40 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 6 mmMgCl2, 2 mm spermidine, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm nucleoside triphosphates, and 20 units of T7 RNA polymerase for 15 min at 37 °C. Native and purified RNA molecules were purified using gel-filtration spin columns (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in TMK-glutamate buffer (see above) and probed immediately. RNase T2 cleavage reactions were carried out in TMK-glutamate buffer for 5 min at 37 °C. Cleavage patterns were analyzed by primer extension using the hokA primer, 5′-GTGGTAGTTTCATGGC, according to Ref. 28Thisted T. Nielsen A.K. Gerdes K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1950-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar. Based on folding simulations and phylogenetic analyses of the hok family of mRNAs, two hairpin structures were proposed to form at the hok mRNA 5′ end (30Gultyaev A.P. Franch T. Gerdes K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 26-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The secondary structure of the nascent hoktranscript is shown in Fig. 2 A. By completion of transcription the hairpins must give way for the thermodynamically more stable structures, characteristic of the full-length molecule shown in Fig. 2 B. Notably, the full-length molecule contains the fbi-tac interaction and the top of the long tac stem. The U21A mutation that destabilizes the proposed metastable structure (Fig.2 A) while increasing the energy of the alternative tac stem (Fig. 2 C) is expected to increase the rate of the structural transition from the metastable structure to the tac stem (see Fig. 2,A and C). Along with the U21A mutation, we introduced the second-site A9U mutation, which restores the possibility of forming the metastable hairpin. The effects of U21A and A9U mutations on the stability and processing pattern of hokmRNA in vivo was assayed by Northern analysis. In the wild-type case (Fig. 3 A,first panel), the processing pattern is explained as follows (24Gerdes K. Gultyaev A.P. Franch T. Pedersen K. Mikkelsen N.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar): truncated hok mRNA is slowly and constitutively generated by exonucleolytical processing of hok mRNA-2. In the presence of Sok RNA, truncated hok mRNA is removed rapidly by RNase III cleavage of the hok/sokduplex RNA. Therefore, truncated hok mRNA is not observed in cells growing in steady state (i.e. before the addition of rifampicin in Fig. 3 A). However, after rifampicin, Sok RNA decays rapidly. This in turn allows for accumulation of the stable truncated hok mRNA. The U21A mutation dramatically reduced the levels of both full-length molecules (Fig. 3 A, second panel) and inactivated the ability of the system to mediate plasmid stabilization by the PSK mechanism (data not shown). During steady-state cell growth, a band corresponding to the major product of Sok-mediated RNase III cleavage of hok mRNA is visible, indicating that the predominant fraction of the molecules is degraded by RNase III (-2 minsample in second panel). This in turn indicates that mutatedhok mRNA binds Sok RNA prematurely or, less likely, that Sok RNA exhibits enhanced binding to the full-length RNAs. We then investigated whether disruption of the metastable structure by the U21A mutation could be back-complemented by the U9A mutation (Fig.2 C). As seen from Fig. 3 A (fourth panel), the U21A/A9U double mutation restored the processing pattern to that of the wild-type mRNA. This provides genetic evidence for the existence of the 5′ metastable hairpin. The A9U single mutation had no effect on the mRNA processing pattern, probably because it simultaneously reduces the energy of the metastable and tac stems (see “Discussion”). To further investigate the function of the metastable structurein vivo, we analyzed hok mRNA band patterns in the absence of Sok RNA (Fig. 3 B). In the wild-type case, truncated hok mRNA is now present in steady state, because it cannot be removed by antisense RNA-mediated RNase III cleavage (first panel). Importantly, the mRNA level of the U21A is no longer reduced (second panel), implying that the U21A mutation accelerates Sok RNA binding to hokmRNA. The band patterns of hokA9U andhokU21A/A9U were also similar to that of the wild-type mRNA (Fig. 3 B). We find this result consistent with the proposal that the metastable structure functions to keep the nascent hok transcript in an inactive configuration. To gain more direct insight, we turned to in vitro analyses. Two mutant mRNAs were constructed (Fig.4). In one RNA termed “hoksuper-metastable” mRNA, the metastable hairpins were forced by the introduction of five base changes in the 5′ stem. In the second RNA termed “hok super-tac,” the tac stem was forced by five different base changes (Fig. 4). The secondary structures of the forced mutant RNAs were confirmed experimentally (data not shown). Sok RNA and variants of truncated hok mRNA were synthesized in vitro, gel-purified, and renatured. Using an in vitro binding assay (38Persson C. Wagner E.G. Nordstrom K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3279-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the apparent second-order binding-rate constants (K app) of Sok RNA association with truncated wild-type and mutant hokmRNAs were determined (Table I). Sok RNA bound with similar high rates to truncated wild-type and super-tachok mRNAs. However, the binding rate was reduced ∼10-fold in the case of the super-metastable hok mRNA. Thus in this assay the forced metastable structure reduced antisense RNA binding significantly. This is consistent with the notion that the super-metastable structure prevents the formation of the antisense RNA target hairpin (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, Sok RNA bound rapidly to both purified wild-type and super-tac hok mRNAs, indicating that these molecules contain the antisense RNA target hairpin that mediates that highest rate of antisense binding (25Franch T. Gultyaev A.P. Gerdes K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 38-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 39Franch T. Petersen M. Wagner E.G. Jacobsen J.P. Gerdes K. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1115-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Note that the molecules used above were denatured and renatured during their purification.Table IIn Vitro Sok RNA binding ratesTruncated RNASecond-order binding-rate constantsRelative binding rates105M−1 s−1hok wild type8.01super-tac8.01super-metastable0.90.11The numbers were obtained by standard RNA binding assays as described previously (25Franch T.

Open table in a new tab The numbers were obtained by standard RNA binding assays as described previously (25Franch T. Gultyaev A.P. Gerdes K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 38-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The numbers given are averages of at least three independent measurements. To test the effect of the metastable structure on hoktranslation, wild-type and mutant hok mRNAs were translated in a cell-free S30 extract (37Zubay G. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1973; 7: 267-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). When gel-purified and renatured, the wild-type truncated hok mRNA was translated efficiently (Fig. 5, +,upper panel). This result is consistent with the finding that renatured truncated hok mRNA folds into the translatable configuration that contains the energy-rich tac stem (26Franch T. Gerdes K. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 C). To examine if this was also the case for the native molecule, transcripts were synthesized in vitro and added directly to the S30 extract without denaturation and renaturation. Strikingly, truncated wild-type hok mRNA in its native form was not translated at all (Fig. 5). Native truncated hok mRNA carrying the forced metastable structure was also translated very inefficiently. In contrast, the native forms of hokmRNAs carrying the super-tac and U21A mutations were translated efficiently. Truncated hok mRNA carrying the A9U was not translated, probably because the mutation destabilizes the tac stem required for translation. As expected the two full-lengthhok mRNAs also were not translated (Fig. 5). These results indicate that mutations or conditions that favor the metastable structure prevent translation, whereas the presence of the tac stem allows translation. An important inference from the above-described results was that gel-purified truncated hok mRNA should contain the tac stem, whereas the native form of the molecule should contain the metastable structure. To investigate this directly, we performed a structural analysis. As seen in Fig.6 A, the RNase T2 cleavage patterns (T2 cleaves 3′ of unpaired nucleotides) of the two forms of the RNA are strikingly different. The purified form has prominent bands corresponding to the tac-stem loop (tac in Fig.6 A), whereas these bands are reduced in the native isoform of the mRNA. In contrast, the native isoform exhibits enhanced cleavage at bases corresponding to the loops of the metastable hairpins (m1 and m2 in Fig. 6 A). The clear differences between the RNAs indicate that the metastable hairpins exist in truncated hok mRNA. Leaving the native truncated hok mRNA at room temperature for 30 min before probing does not change the probing pattern (data not shown), indicating that this configuration is stable throughout the probing experiment. To study the refolding kinetics of native hok mRNA, a coupled transcription/RNase H-probing time-course assay was conducted (Fig. 7; see “Experimental Procedures”). Native wild-type and mutated truncated hok mRNAs were generated with T7 RNA polymerase and structure-probed with RNase H using an oligonucleotide complementary to the region of the mok ribosome-binding site (see Fig. 2, A and C). Samples were withdrawn from the transcription mix at various time points after initiation to monitor structural rearrangements. Native hok mRNA containing the forced tac stem exhibited efficient cleavage (Fig. 7,third panel), indicating that in this RNA the mokribosome-binding site exists in an open configuration. This is consistent with the translatability of the RNA (Fig. 5). In contrast,hok mRNA containing the forced metastable structure was not cleaved at all (Fig. 7, second panel), indicating that the mok ribosome-binding site is in a closed configuration. Again, the closed structure is consistent with the observed lack of translation (Fig. 5). Note that the mok SD region is located 70 nucleotides downstream of the mutational changes in the RNAs, showing that the mutations impose long-range structural changes in the RNAs. Most importantly, wild-type native hok mRNA exhibited the same RNase H cleavage pattern as the RNA containing the forced metastable structure, and the pattern did not change in time (Fig. 7,first panel). These results support that the metastable structure exists stably in native truncated hok mRNA and that it keeps the mok SD region in a closed configuration. Fig. 6 B shows a structural analysis of purifiedversus native full-length hok mRNA-1. Both the purified and native isoforms were cleaved at positions corresponding to the loop of the tac stem, indicating that the native molecule contains this structure. This stands in contrast to truncated wild-type hok mRNA, in which case the native form exhibited a cleavage pattern compatible with the metastable structure (Fig. 6 A). Thus, the presence of the 3′ fbi element eliminates the existence of the metastable hairpins. By inference, this suggests that the 3′ fbi element triggers the disruption of the metastable hairpins in the native full-length mRNA. The previous identification of a translational activator element (tac) in the 5′ end of hok mRNA posed the following question: during transcription, how is lethal translation and Sok RNA-mediated degradation of hok mRNA avoided? A possible answer to this question came from the phylogenetic observation that allhok homologous mRNAs (including hok itself) have the possibility to form local hairpins at their 5′ ends. In all RNAs, these metastable hairpins would preclude formation of the longer tac stems (30Gultyaev A.P. Franch T. Gerdes K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 26-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). By preventing tac-stem formation, the metastable hairpins would favor the formation of downstream inhibitory structures, thereby keeping the mRNA translationally inert and relatively inaccessible for antisense RNA binding. Recently, the metastable structure comprising the two local hairpins (Fig. 2 A) has been shown to exist in vitro in a minimal molecule consisting of the 5′-end 74 nucleotides of hok mRNA (40Nagel J.H. Gultyaev A.P. Gerdes K. Pleij C.W. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 1408-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The presence of this structure in the native molecule in vivo as well as its function was, however, not investigated. Here, a single nucleotide change that simultaneously disrupted the metastable structure and favored the tac stem (U21A) reduced the intracellular amount of hok mRNA. This reduction was accompanied by a PSK-negative phenotype. Furthermore, the reduction depended on Sok RNA, indicating increased antisense RNA binding to the mutated hok mRNA (Fig. 3). These results are consistent with the proposal that the U21A-mutated hoktranscript refolds prematurely into the tac-stem configuration. The tac stem favors the formation of the antisense RNA target hairpin that in turn would increase the binding rate of Sok RNA during transcription (25Franch T. Gultyaev A.P. Gerdes K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 38-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The deleterious effect of the U21A mutation on hok mRNA stability was complemented by the A9U mutation (Fig. 3). This observation provides genetic evidence for the formation of the metastable structure in vivo (Fig. 2 A). The A9U mutation itself had no effect on the processing pattern ofhok mRNA. This indicates that destabilization of the metastable structure per se does not account for the observed effect of the U21A mutation. However, U21A also increases the energy of the tac stem (Fig. 2 C). Hence, during transcription U21A may increase the rate of refolding into the stable tac stem that in turn would favor rapid antisense RNA binding. The in vivo results presented in Fig. 3 corroborate the proposed function of the metastable structure. To obtain more direct evidence, we employed in vitro techniques. Enforcement of the metastable structure of hok mRNA led to a 10-fold decrease in the in vitro Sok RNA binding rate (Table I). The enforced metastable structure precludes the formation of the tac and target stem loops (Figs. 2 A and 6 A). The target hairpin contains a specialized structure (the U-turn) that is required for rapid antisense binding (39Franch T. Petersen M. Wagner E.G. Jacobsen J.P. Gerdes K. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1115-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). As in tRNA, the U-turn exposes three bases in the target loop, thereby enhancing the Sok RNA binding rate ∼10-fold. Thus, if the target hairpin cannot form, the U-turn structure cannot form either, and rapid antisense binding is prevented. This explains the slower binding rate for a target RNA that contains the enforced metastable structure. On the other hand, purified wild-type and super-metastable hok mRNAs bound Sok RNA rapidly, indicating that both of these RNAs are in the tac-stem form (Table I). Previously, we found that gel-purified truncated hokmRNA was translated efficiently, whereas full-length hokmRNA-1 and -2 were translated poorly (25Franch T. Gultyaev A.P. Gerdes K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 38-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 26Franch T. Gerdes K. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 28Thisted T. Nielsen A.K. Gerdes K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1950-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Here we expand our analyses using native RNAs that were not denatured and renatured before being subjected to translation (Fig. 5). Native full-length mRNA-1 and -2 were translated poorly, consistent with the finding that native full-length mRNA-1 did not contain the target stem-loop known to be present in the active translatable mRNA (Fig.6 B). This is consistent with the native full-length RNAs being in the closed configuration containing the fbi-tac interaction but lacking the target stem-loop (Figs. 2 B and6 B). Gel-purified truncated hok mRNA was translated efficiently. In contrast, the native isoform of the RNA was not translated at all (Fig. 5). Structure mappings of the two isoforms showed patterns consistent with the metastable structure being present in the native RNA and the tac/target stem-loops in the purified species (Fig. 6 A). Thus, we conclude that the metastable structure prevents translation in native truncated hok mRNA. This conclusion is corroborated by translational analysis of the series of mutant mRNAs (Fig. 5). Mutations favoring the metastable structure (super-metastable and U21A/A9U) reduce translation, whereas mutations favoring the tac/target configuration (super-tac and U21A) favor translation. The native mRNA carrying the A9U mutation was translated at a lower rate than the one carrying U21A. Both mutations disrupt the metastable structure, but only U21A increases the stability of the tac stem. The low translation rate conferred by A9U may be caused by secondary effects on tac-stem stability (e.g.disruption of a possible noncanonical GA/AG base pairing at the bottom of the tac stem, see Fig. 2 C). Native and purified full-length hok mRNA-1 was also structure-probed (Fig. 6 B). In this case, the cleavage patterns were indistinguishable. The cleavage pattern is consistent with previous structure-probing of purified RNAs (25Franch T. Gultyaev A.P. Gerdes K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 38-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and indicates that the native full-length molecules do not contain the metastable structure but rather the top of the tac stem (Fig. 2 B). Thus, in contrast to native truncated hok mRNA, native full-length molecules do not exhibit a cleavage pattern compatible with the metastable configuration (Fig. 6, A and B). However, both molecules are in closed configurations lacking the antisense target hairpin. A reasonable inference from these results is that the 3′-end fbi element triggers disruption of the metastable structure by forming the fbi-tac interaction (the transition fromA to B in Fig. 2). In turn, this triggers formation of the top of the tac stem in the full-length molecule. Hence, in the course of transcription, one inactive form of the mRNA (containing the metastable structure) is replaced actively by the formation of a second inactive form (the full-length transcript). In other words, co-transcriptional repression ofhok translation by the metastable structurein vivo does not rely on refolding kinetics but rather assumes a “lock and key” mechanism, in which the fbi element constitutes the key for unlocking the metastable structure. This is in keeping with hok/sok biology, because spontaneous refolding of the 5′ end into a translatable conformation could be lethal to the cell. Because of the considerable thermodynamic stability of the two metastable hairpins, refolding is unlikely to involve complete unwinding of the two hairpins prior to the formation of thermodynamically more stable structures. Such a transition would require a large activation energy and thus becomes extremely slow at physiological temperatures. Rather the refolding occurs through a number of folding intermediates by an RNA strand exchange mechanism in which one secondary structure is formed at the expense of another. Such mechanisms have been proposed to account for the rapid interchange of RNA secondary structures in Leptomonas collosoma spliced leader RNA (41LeCuyer K.A. Crothers D.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5301-5311Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and the P(−1)/P1 region of Tetrahymenagroup I intron (17Cao Y. Woodson S.A. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 901-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). One possibility is that the extreme 5′-end nucleotides serve as a toehold for nucleation of fbi-tac formation and concomitant unwinding of the metastable hairpin I. Analysis of a hok G30C mutant, however, suggests that this is not the case. The G30C mutation, which creates a base pair with the extreme 5′-end guanosine, has no effect on PSK, indicating that refolding is unaffected by this substitution (data not shown). Alternatively, refolding can be nucleated by the formation of a pseudoknot intermediate by long range interaction between loop nucleotides (U13-C16) of metastable hairpin I and their downstream complementary subset (G60-A63). Such an intermediate structure has been proposed for the spliced leader RNA (42LeCuyer K.A. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3373-3377Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The present identification of a metastable structure formed during transcription extends the concept of hok mRNA folding dynamics to involve two refolding events that are separated in time. Initially, during early stages of transcription two metastable hairpins are formed in the very 5′ end of the mRNA. As the rate of RNA secondary structure formation exceeds that of RNA synthesis by orders of magnitude, their formation is favored kinetically. By sequestering the 5′-end tac element, the metastable hairpins facilitate subsequent formation of downstream inhibitory structures, protecting the RNA against premature degradation and the cell against Hok-toxin synthesis. Upon completion of transcription, the long range fbi-tac interaction together with the partial tac stem replace the metastable structure. Eventually, slow constitutive processing of the full-length mRNA leads to the second refolding event, which produces the active version of the hok mRNA (Fig. 2 C). Finally, depending on the presence of Sok RNA, the mRNA is either translated or inactivated. We thank C. W. A. Pleij, Alexander P.

Our results show that scrapie infection induces a 4-fold increase in the level of IGF-1R in two independently scrapie-infected neuroblastomas, ScN2a and ScN1E-115 cells, and that the increased IGF-1R level was accompanied by increased IGF-1R mRNA levels. In contrast to the elevated IGF-1R expression in ScN2a, receptor binding studies revealed an 80% decrease in specific125I-IGF-1-binding sites compared with N2a cells. This decrease in IGF-1R-binding sites was shown to be caused by a 7-fold decrease in IGF-1R affinity. Furthermore, ScN2a showed no significant difference in IGF-1 induced proliferative response, despite the noticeable elevated IGF-1R expression, putatively explained by the reduced IGF-1R binding affinity. Additionally, IGF-1 stimulated IGF-1Rβ tyrosine phosphorylation showed no major change in the dose-response between the cell types, possibly due to altered tyrosine kinase signaling in scrapie-infected neuroblastoma cells. Altogether these data indicate that scrapie infection affects the expression, binding affinity, and signal transduction mediated by the IGF-1R in neuroblastoma cells.

In addition, IGF-1 even acts as a rescuing agent when administered after neuronal injury (9Wang J.M. Hayashi T. Zhang W.R. Sakai K. Shiro Y. Abe K.

Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 140: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The IGF-1R is a heterotetrameric tyrosine kinase receptor, very similar both in structure and function to the insulin receptor. Binding of IGF-1 to the extracellular α-subunits leads to autophosphorylation of the intracellular part of the β-subunits through a transphosphorylation mechanism, resulting in the activation of their tyrosine kinase domains. This enables the receptor kinase to phosphorylate the intermediate docking proteins Shc and insulin receptor substrate-1/2 (IRS-1/2) which subsequently recruit various intracellular proteins (20Butler A.A.

This results in the activation of downstream signaling pathways including the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade and the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, which in neuronal cells maintain an anti-apoptotic machinery through activation of PKB/AKT (21Dudek H.

Several studies have indeed shown major changes in the expression of IGF-1, IGF-binding protein, and IGF-1R in afflicted brain regions in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimers patients as well as in the pathologically aging brain (2Dore S.

The experimental transmissible form (to hamsters, mice, and cell cultures) is also named scrapie. Characteristic for prion diseases is the conformational change of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) to the pathogenic isoform (PrPSc), which accumulates intra- and extracellularly (24Prusiner S.B. Scott M.R. DeArmond S.J. Cohen F.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 337-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Neuropathological changes include astrogliosis and vacuolization of nerve cell processes, resulting in the typical spongiform neurodegeneration.PrPC is a membrane-associated protein, mainly expressed in neurons and located to sphingolipid- and cholesterol-rich membrane domains or “lipid rafts” by virtue of its C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (25Vey M. Pilkuhn S. Wille H. Nixon R. DeArmond S.J. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G. Taraboulos A. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It was recently shown that antibody-mediated cross-linking of PrPC in differentiated neuronal cells induced a caveolin-1-dependent activation of the tyrosine kinase Fyn, suggesting a possible role of PrPC in lipid rafts as a signaling molecule (29Mouillet-Richard S.

Science. 2000; 289: 1925-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar).Although the function of PrPC is still unknown, several lines of evidence indicate that PrPC may be involved in maintaining the proper oxidative balance of the cell through a regulation of intracellular copper transport (30Brown D.R. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 85-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). PrPCbinds copper in the N-terminal octapeptide repeat region and prion protein-deficient mice show a severe reduction in the copper content of synaptic membranes, together with a reduced Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase activity, presumably as a consequence of reduced incorporation of copper into the enzyme (31Brown D.R.

Accordingly, recent studies implicate the involvement of increased oxidative stress (34Guentchev M. Voigtlander T. Haberler C. Groschup M.H. Budka H. Neurobiol.

Alterations in the IGF-1 system in scrapie-infected neurons may contribute to the prion-induced degenerative cascade by rendering these cells more susceptible to neuronal death because of changed expression and/or function of the IGF-1R. Our results show that scrapie infection induces a 4-fold increase in the expression of the IGF-1R protein accompanied by elevated IGF-1R mRNA levels. However, no increase in binding sites or cell growth was observed in these cells, albeit the massive increase in IGF-1R expression. This discrepancy was further shown to be caused by a 7-fold decrease in receptor binding affinity in scrapie-infected neuroblastoma cells.DISCUSSIONThese studies were undertaken to investigate if the generation and presence of prions may alter the regulation, function, and mitogenic response of IGF-1R in scrapie-infected neuroblastoma cells. Our results show that scrapie infection induced a 4-fold increase in IGF-1R protein expression (Fig. 2, A and B) as measured in WGA-purified proteins, and this phenomenon of scrapie-induced IGF-1R up-regulation was further confirmed in an independently prion-infected neuroblastoma cell line ScN1E-115 (Fig. 2, A andB), indicating that up-regulated IGF-1R expression is a scrapie-induced and not a clonal effect. This assumption was further substantiated since the IGF-1R expression returned to the same level as in non-infected N2a and N1E-115 cells when these cells spontaneously lost scrapie infection. This suggests that increased IGF-1R expression is indeed a scrapie-induced effect and not a clonal effect or a survival selection of cells overexpressing the IGF-1R during and after the prion infection period, which could be the case as the IGF-1R exhibits an anti-apoptotic effect and a large portion of the cells die during the in vitro prion infection.Since the amount of immunoreactive IGF-1R was studied in WGA bead-precipitated proteins, the seemingly increased expression in ScN2a cells could be due to enhanced N-linked glycosylation and stability and therefor higher extent of bound IGF-1R to WGA-lectin in proteins from ScN2a compared with N2a cells. N-Linked glycosylation occurs co-translationally in the endoplasmic reticulum (44Hart G.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 1017-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 45Hirschberg C.B.

Biochem. 1987; 56: 63-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) and depends on de novo synthesized dolichyl phosphate, a long-chain nonsterol isoprene which acts as a membrane-bound carrier of oligosaccharides in the assembly of glycoproteins such as the IGF-1R (45Hirschberg C.B. Snider M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 63-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The level of dolichyl phosphate was recently shown to be important for the rate of N-linked glycosylation of the IGF-1R, as shown by higher N-linked glycosylation by the addition of dolichyl phosphate (46Dricu A. Kanter L. Wang M. Nilsson G. Hjertman M. Wejde J. Larsson O. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) or mevalonate (a precursor of dolichyl phosphate biosynthesis) (47Carlberg M. Dricu A. Blegen H. Wang M. Hjertman M. Zickert P. Höög A. Larsson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17453-17462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and conversely inhibition of dolichyl phosphate biosynthesis reduced theN-glycosylation and expression of IGF-1R (48Doyle J.W. Ward-Bailey P.F. Kandutsch A.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Of interest here is that the level of dolichyl phosphate was shown to be significantly elevated in scrapie-infected brains (49Guan Z. Söderberg M. Sindelar P. Prusiner S.B. Kristensson K. Dallner G. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To verify if an enhanced N-linked glycosylation of the IGF-1R contributed to the elevated IGF-1R level detected in ScN2a cells, we also performed immunoprecipitation of the IGF-1R from N2a and ScN2a cells with anti-IGF-1R α-and β-subunit-specific antibodies, followed by immunblotting (Fig. 2C). These experiments showed the same increase of both IGF-1R α- and β-subunits in immunoprecipitates, indicating that the observed increase was not biased by the method which was used, but reflects a scrapie-induced increase in the IGF-1R protein level. This is further strengthened by the significantly higher IGF-1R mRNA level in ScN2a compared with N2a, as measured by semiquantitative RT-PCR, which showed a 2-fold increase in IGF-1R mRNA in ScN2a (Fig. 2D).A possible mechanism underlying the increased IGF-1R expression in the scrapie-infected neuroblastomas could be increased oxidative stress induced by elevated levels of reactive oxygen and/or nitrogen species, as recently described in both scrapie-infected neuronal cell lines and brains (34Guentchev M. Voigtlander T. Haberler C. Groschup M.H. Budka H. Neurobiol. Dis. 2000; 7: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 35Milhavet O. McMahon H.E. Rachidi W. Nishida N. Katamine S. Mange A.

Reactive oxygen species, specifically H2O2 and lipid peroxides, activate IGF-1R transcription directly (50Delafontaine P. Ku L. Cardiovasc. Res. 1997; 33: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and several growth factors, including angiotensin II (51Du J. Peng T. Scheidegger K.J. Delafontaine P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2119-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and platelet-derived growth factor (52Rubini M. Werner H. Gandini E. Roberts C.T.J. LeRoith D. Baserga R. Exp.

In addition, IGF-1R expression in retinal cells was shown to be increased under hypoxic conditions (54Averbukh E. Weiss O. Halpert M. Yanko R. Moshe R. Nephesh I. Flyvbjerg A. Yanko L. Raz I. Metabolism. 1998; 47: 1331-1336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which are associated with elevated free radical formation and oxidative stress. Of special interest here is the finding that in the spinal cord of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a motor neuron disease associated with mutations in Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase, the number of125I-IGF-1-binding sites were substantially increased (2Dore S. Kar S. Quirion R. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 326-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar,22Adem A. Ekblom J. Gillberg P.G. Jossan S.S. Höög A. Winblad B. Aquilonius S.M. Wang L.H. Sara V. J. Neural Transm. Gen. Sect. 1994; 97: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We are currently investigating whether increased free radicals in ScN2a may participate in the induction of IGF-1R expression.The scrapie-induced up-regulation of IGF-1R mRNA and protein levels in ScN2a may be part of a trophic response to increased oxidative stress, as IGF-1R activation supports neuronal survival and inhibits cell death in various neurodegenerative disorders (9Wang J.M.

Changes in the IGF-1 system has been reported in various brain insults (2Dore S. Kar S. Quirion R. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 326-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and evidence indicates that IGF-1R mRNA is up-regulated as a function of aging and cognitive deficits (23Stenvers K.L. Lund P.K. Gallagher M. Neuroscience. 1996; 72: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 55Sonntag W.E. Lynch C.D. Bennett S.A. Khan A.S. Thornton P.L. Cooney P.T. Ingram R.L. McShane T. Brunso-Bechtold J.K. Neuroscience. 1999; 88: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), consistent with a neuroplastic role of the IGF-1R under degenerative conditions. However, functional impairment of the IGF-1R was also reported in several regions of the pathologically aging brain as demonstrated by decreased125I-IGF-1-binding and IGF-1-stimulated protein synthesis, despite unchanged mRNA levels (55Sonntag W.E. Lynch C.D. Bennett S.A. Khan A.S. Thornton P.L. Cooney P.T. Ingram R.L. McShane T. Brunso-Bechtold J.K. Neuroscience. 1999; 88: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 56D'Costa A.P. Xu X. Ingram R.L. Sonntag W.E. Neuroscience. 1995; 65: 805-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus the up-regulation of the IGF-1R may be an attempt by the affected neurons to increase the trophic support, however, unsuccessful because of defective receptor binding and/or signaling.A similar scenario may account for our results showing that despite the scrapie-induced 4-fold increase of IGF-1R in ScN2a there was no corresponding increase in the proliferative response to IGF-1 compared with N2a (Fig. 3). N2a cells respond dose-dependently to 0–100 ng/ml IGF-1 with increased cell growth. Under conditions of submaximal growthi.e. doubling times below a cell types inherent maximal doubling rate (∼15 h for N2a cells), it has been demonstrated that the proliferation rate depends, among other factors, on the number of mitogenic receptors, in our case the IGF-1R, where only a small increase in the number of receptors per cell may modulate the mitogenic response (41Rubini M. Hongo A. D'Ambrosio C. Baserga R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 230: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 42Baserga R. Hongo A. Rubini M. Prisco M. Valentinis B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F105-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) and conversely, down-regulation or blockade of the IGF-1R potently inhibits IGF-1 induced cell growth (43Damon S.E. Plymate S.R. Carroll J.M. Sprenger C.C. Dechsukhum C. Ware J.L. Roberts C.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 57Sell C. Rubini M. Rubin R. Liu J.P. Efstratiadis A.

Science. 1993; 259: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Consequently, the unaffected proliferation rate in ScN2a cells may indicate that the up-regulated IGF-1Rs in ScN2a cells are functionally inhibited.A putative explanation was offered by receptor binding studies showing that the number of specific IGF-1-binding sites in ScN2a in relation to the 4-fold increase in immunoreactive IGF-1R revealed a 80% decrease in binding sites (Fig. 4B), indicating that scrapie infection may inhibit the proliferative response to IGF-1 by inhibition of IGF-1 binding. This decrease in specific binding was further shown to be due to a decrease in IGF-1 binding affinity, with calculatedKd values of 0.6 ± 0.1 and 4.2 ± 0.5 nm in N2a and ScN2a, respectively (Fig. 4A). This decrease in binding affinity suggests that although these receptors are expressed, the processing, folding and/or membrane integration is disturbed by scrapie infection, resulting in the decreased binding affinity.Altered expression, processing, localization, and function have previously been described for several proteins in scrapie-infected cells and brains. For example, in ScN2a cells and scrapie-infected hamster brain cells (ScHaB), platelet-derived growth factor- and bradykinin-induced calcium responses were significantly reduced. Although 125I-bradykinin-binding sites were increased, the receptor affinity was strongly decreased (40Wong K. Qiu Y. Hyun W. Nixon R. VanCleff J. Sanchez-Salazar J. Prusiner S.B. DeArmond S.J. Neurology. 1996; 47: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and these authors suggested decreased membrane fluidity as causative for the reduced receptor affinity. Autoradiographic studies of hippocampus from scrapie-infected mice revealed a marked decrease in neuropeptide Y2-receptor binding, although corresponding Y2 mRNA levels were essentially unchanged (39Diez M. Koistinaho J. Dearmond S.J. Groth D. Prusiner S.B. Hökfelt T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13267-13272Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Abnormal intracellular localization linked to functional impairment of heat shock proteins (59Tatzelt J. Voellmy R. Welch W.J. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1998; 18: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (60Keshet G.I. Ovadia H. Taraboulos A. Gabizon R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1224-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) has also been demonstrated in scrapie-infected brain and in ScN2a.Further analysis of the IGF-1R function in ScN2a cells showed that IGF-1 induced a dose-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGF-1R β-chain in N2a and ScN2a (Fig. 5). Densitometric measurments of IGF-1 stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation compared with the amount of IGF-1R β-subunit, as detected in WGA-lectin-precipitated proteins revealed, however, no major change in the dose response between the cell types. The inconsistency between a significantly reduced IGF-1R binding affinity in ScN2a on one hand, but no difference in the IGF-1-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation on the other, may reflect an increased IGF-1R tyrosine kinase activity in ScN2a or an increased total tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGF-1R β-subunits resulting from receptor autophosphorylation in addition to the activity of soluble tyrosine kinases/phosphatases, as measured by phosphotyrosine staining of the lectin precipitated receptors. Although we have no explanation for this discrepancy at this moment, it is of interest to note that antibody-mediated cross-linking of PrPC stimulated the Src family tyrosine kinase Fyn localized to the specialized membrane domains or rafts, also containing PrPSc (29Mouillet-Richard S. Ermonval M. Chebassier C. Laplanche J.L. Lehmann S. Launay J.M. Kellermann O. Science. 2000; 289: 1925-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar).Co-localization of misfolded prions and various protein tyrosine kinases in membrane rafts could affect the latter, with a subsequently altered tyrosine kinase signaling originating in these microdomains. Currently the localization of the IGF-1R to lipid rafts is not known, however, as many of its signal transduction partners and both receptor tyrosine kinases and Src family kinases are harbored in these (27Wu C.B.

Signal. 1998; 10: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), IGF-1R signal transduction, i.e. tyrosine phosphorylation, may also be altered.In conclusion, our data shows that scrapie infection affects the expression, binding affinity and signal transduction of IGF-1R in neuroblastoma cells.

In this study, we report the reconstitution of phagosome-lysosome fusion in vitro, using an assay based on resonance energy transfer between fluorescent phospholipid analogues that were inserted into whole human NB4-neutrophil membranes from liposomes containing positively charged lipids. Cytosol was required for fusion, and fusion was stimulated 3-fold if this cytosol had been prepared from neutrophils activated by using opsonized zymosan or a combination of the calcium ionophore (A23187) and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Fusion was inhibited by the addition of PP1, an inhibitor of Src family protein kinases, or GTPγS. We have previously reported that the biogenesis of phagolysosomes in human neutrophils is inhibited by mycobacteria.

Phagosomes fuse with endosomal and lysosomal compartments, delivering enzymes, bactericidal proteins, and proton pumps to the phagosomes (1DesJardins M. Huber L.A. Parton R.G. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). These factors are thought to play a major role in the intracellular killing of microorganisms (2Haas A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1998; 15: 103-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Contributing to the intracellular survival of mycobacteria, phagosomes containing ingested live mycobacteria do not reach a pH lower than 6.3, as they do not acquire the lysosomal proton pump (3Sturgill-Koszycki S.

Little is known about the mechanism of phagosome-lysosome fusion and its inhibition by mycobacteria, although some of the proteins involved in these processes have been identified (8Shukla A. Berglund L. Nielsen L.P. Nielsen S. Hoffmann H.J. Dahl R. Respir. Med. 2000; 94: 10-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 9Ferrari G. Langen H. Naito M. Pieters J.

We have previously shown that in human neutrophils, fusion between phagosomes and azurophil granules (specialized lysosomes) does not occur during infection with mycobacteria (11N′Diaye E.-N. Darzacq X. Astarie-Dequeker C. Daffé M. Calafat J. Maridonneau-Parini I. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4983-4991PubMed Google Scholar). Upon phagocytosis of zymosan by human neutrophils or macrophages, followed by phagosome-lysosome fusion, a tyrosine kinase of the Src family, Hck, was found to be activated on lysosomes and translocated to phagosomes (12Mohn H. Le Cabec V. Fischer S. Maridonneau-Parini I. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 13Astarie-Dequeker C. N′Diaye E.N. Le Cabec V. Rittig M.G. Prandi J.

Translocation and activation did not take place during phagocytosis of mycobacteria, suggesting a role for this protein in regulating the biogenesis of phagolysosomes (11N′Diaye E.-N. Darzacq X. Astarie-Dequeker C. Daffé M. Calafat J. Maridonneau-Parini I. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4983-4991PubMed Google Scholar). The major experimental problem in studying the mechanism of phagosome-lysosome fusion is the lack of an efficient in vitro assay for fusion (15Mayorga L.S. Bertini F. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6511-6517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, it is difficult to purify lysosomes from macrophages, lacking a specific marker for this compartment. In this study, we took advantage of the fact that in neutrophils, lysosomes have specific markers such as myeloperoxidase and a high density and are thus easy to isolate by fractionation of the postnuclear supernatant on a discontinuous Percoll gradient (16Borregaard N. Heiple J.M. Simons E.R. Clark R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). However, we have previously shown that centrifugation through Percoll removes peripheral proteins from the surface of vesicles (12Mohn H. Le Cabec V. Fischer S. Maridonneau-Parini I. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 17Vaissière C. Le Cabec V. Maridonneau-Parini I. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Differential centrifugation avoids this problem, but neutrophils contain other types of granules that could potentially contaminate the lysosome preparation. Therefore, we have used NB4 cells that contain only one type of granule, the azurophil granule/lysosome (18Gregoire C. Welch H. Astarie-Dequeker C. Maridonneau-Parini I. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 175: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These promyeolytic human cells were differentiated to neutrophil-like cells by means of all-trans retinoic acid (14Welch H. Maridonneau-Parini I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 102-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar,19Lanotte M. Martin-Thouvenin V. Najman S. Balerini P. Valensi F. Berger R. Blood. 1991; 77: 1080-1086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We developed a method to label NB4 cells with the fluorescent probes N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl) phosphatidylethanolamine (N-Rhodamine-PE)1and N-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl) phosphatidylethanolamine (N-NBD-PE). We then measured fusion between labeled lysosomes that were isolated from these cells and unlabeled phagosomes. Dry lipid films were produced from a mixture of N-NBD-PE,N-Rhodamine-PE, and 1,2-dioleoyl-3-N, N,N,-trimethylammoniumpropane (DOTAP) (2:2:1 molar ratio; Avanti Polar Lipids, Birmingham, AL) and taken up into double-distilled water to produce liposomes. The promyelocytic human cells NB4 (obtained from the Institut National de Santé et de la Recherche Médicale, Ref. 19Lanotte M. Martin-Thouvenin V. Najman S. Balerini P. Valensi F. Berger R. Blood. 1991; 77: 1080-1086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were grown and differentiated into neutrophils by all-trans retinoic acid as previously described (14Welch H. Maridonneau-Parini I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 102-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). 156 nmol of the lipids in 500 μl of water were added to 2.5 × 107 cells in a volume of 25 ml of tissue culture medium (MEM), buffered with 10 mm HEPES pH 7.4 (MEM/HEPES) for 15 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed by centrifugation and incubated in culture medium for 50 min at 37 °C, after which A23187 and PMA were added to final concentrations of 5 μm and 100 ng/ml, respectively. After an additional 10 min at 37 °C, the cells were collected by centrifugation, suspended in 1 ml of buffer and subjected to nitrogen at 375 psi for 10 min (14Welch H. Maridonneau-Parini I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 102-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). After cavitation, a crude lysosomal pellet was produced from a postnuclear supernatant by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min (14Welch H. Maridonneau-Parini I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 102-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Phagosomes containing 3-μm latex beads (Polysciences, Eppelheim, Germany), which had been incubated overnight at 20 °C with human serum from healthy volunteers to increase the extent of phagocytosis, were produced by the method of DesJardins et al. (1DesJardins M. Huber L.A. Parton R.G. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (5 × 106/ml in MEM/HEPES) were incubated at a ratio of 15 beads per cell for 90 min at 37 °C, resuspended in 2 ml of sucrose 250 mm, 10 mmHEPES pH 7.4, and cavitated at 350 psi for 10 min. After cavitation, sucrose was added to the postnuclear supernatant to 40% w/w and loaded between the 62 and 35% layers of a 62:40:35:25:10% (w/w) sucrose gradient. After centrifugation in a SW41 rotor (Beckman) at 100,000 × g for 1 h, latex bead-containing phagosomes were recovered from the 10 to 25% interface (1DesJardins M. Huber L.A. Parton R.G. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Sucrose was then removed from the phagosomes by pelleting the phagosomes at 50,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in fusion buffer as described in the legend to Fig. 3. For thin layer chromatography, lipids were extracted according to Folch et al. (20Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and run on silica gel plates using chloroform/methanol/water (60:25:4) as a solvent. Spots were visualized by excitation with broad spectrum UV light. Fusion was measured using a Photon Technologies International (PTI, South Brunswick, NJ) or SAFAS flx (Monte Carlo, Monaco) fluorometer, with continuous stirring in a thermostated cuvette at excitation and emission wavelengths of 465 and 530 nm, respectively. For calibration of the fluorescence scale, the initial residual fluorescence intensity was set to zero and the intensity at infinite probe solution 100%. The latter value was obtained after lysis of the liposomes with Triton X-100 (0.5% v/v) with correction for the quenching of NBD by this detergent (21Struck D.K. Hoekstra D. Pagano R.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar), as described before (22Bonnafous P. Stegmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6160-6166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To prepare cytosol, a postnuclear supernatant of cells fractionated as described for lysosome preparation was centrifuged at 100,000 × g, and the supernatant was used. Spectra were obtained by excitation at 465 nm, using 2-nm slits throughout, on the PTI fluorimeter. The phospholipid analogues N-NBD-PE andN-Rhodamine-PE are widely used to quantify membrane fusion with liposomes by a resonance energy transfer assay (21Struck D.K. Hoekstra D. Pagano R.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar), because they do not spontaneously exchange between membranes by lipid transfer, in contrast to other probes that may give false positive results (23Stegmann T.

However, no efficient method existed for introducing these probes into biological membranes. In order to incorporate them into the membranes of live cells, we produced dry lipid films consisting ofN-NBD-PE, N-Rhodamine-PE, and the positively charged lipid DOTAP (2:2:1 molar ratio) and added pure water, producing liposomes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” DOTAP is widely used to transfect cells because it mixes with the lipids of cellular membranes, delivering the DNA into the cell (24Hope M.J. Mui B. Ansell S. Ahkong Q.F. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1998; 15: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). After 15 min of incubation of NB4 cells with these liposomes at 4 °C, we found that cellular plasma membranes were labeled by the fluorescent probes (Fig. 1 a). After 15 min of incubation at 37 °C, followed by a chase in the absence of liposomes for 1 h at 37 °C, we found that intracellular vesicles were labeled, most likely by endocytosis of plasma membrane material (Fig.1, b and c). Fluorescent NB4-neutrophils retained their capacity to mount bactericidal responses, as demonstrated by measuring superoxide generated by NADPH oxidase from cells stimulated by the calcium ionophore A23187 and PMA (results not shown). To isolate fluorescent lysosomes, cells labeled using a pulse-chase protocol were activated by incubation for 10 min at 37 °C in the presence ofA23187 and PMA according to Welch and Maridonneau-Parini (14Welch H. Maridonneau-Parini I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 102-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), a treatment that activates NADPH oxidase and stimulates lysosome exocytosis. Subsequently, the cells were lysed by nitrogen cavitation as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the fluorescent lysosomes were isolated by differential centrifugation (14Welch H. Maridonneau-Parini I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 102-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Fluorescence spectra of the lysosomes (Fig.2 a) showed that both probes were present in the granule fraction, and resonance energy transfer from NBD to Rhodamine (21Struck D.K. Hoekstra D. Pagano R.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar) was observed. By comparison with a calibration curve generated from phosphatidylcholine liposomes containing the fluorescent probes in different concentrations, at a 1:1 ratio, (not shown) it was estimated that the concentration of the probes was about 1.6 mol % each with respect to total membrane lipids, implying that the liposomal material was diluted 25 times by mixing with the lysosomal material. This also means that the concentration of DOTAP in the labeled lysosomal membranes was about 0.8 mol %. Notice that the DOTAP-, N-NBD-PE-, andN-Rhodamine-PE-containing liposomes that were used to label the cells are not at all fluorescent at the excitation wavelength ofN-NBD-PE because of quenching and self-quenching of the probes at these high concentrations (Fig. 2 a). The fluorescent probes were not degraded or otherwise chemically altered by their incorporation into lysosomes (Fig. 2 b). Unlabeled phagosomes then were produced by nitrogen cavitation of NB4 cells that had taken up latex beads, separated from other cellular material by flotation of the latex bead-containing phagosomes on sucrose density gradients (1DesJardins M. Huber L.A. Parton R.G. Griffiths G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), and pelleted by centrifugation to remove the sucrose.Figure 2Dilution of the liposomal fluorescent probes in the membrane of lysosomes and their chemical stability during pulse chase and fusion. Panel a, emission spectra of liposomes (a, b) and lysosomes (c, d) before (b, c) and after (a,d) addition of the detergent Triton X-100, with excitation of N-NBD-PE at 465 nm, normalized to the NBD peak after addition of Triton. Notice that the N-NBD-PE present in liposomes is completely quenched by the N-Rhodamine-PE and self-quenched at these high concentrations, and therefore the liposomes are not fluorescent when excited at the wavelength ofN-NBD-PE. The somewhat lower Rhodamine peak after liberation of the probes from the lysosomes is probably due to absorption by proteins present in the sample.

However, when cytosol from differentiated, but not activated NB4 cells was added, an increase in fluorescence was observed after a lag of 2–3 min. Dilution of the lysosomal membrane lipids into the much larger phagosomal membrane by fusion would result in the almost complete dequenching of the NBD, and therefore a 1% increase in fluorescence would mean that 1% of the lysosomes fused with the phagosomes. In the presence of cytosol, the initial rate of fluorescence increase was 4.2%/h (Fig. 3 c). Importantly, addition of cytosol from NB4 cells activated by using a calcium ionophore and PMA tripled the activity to 12.6%/h (Fig.3 a), reaching a final level of 25% after several hours. Similar results were obtained using cytosol prepared from cells activated by phagocytosis of zymosan opsonized with human serum (Fig.3 b). After 1 h in the presence of non-activated cytosol, the fluorescence increase was 2.5%, compared with 8.2% for activated cytosol. We found that the removal of sucrose from the phagosome preparation was essential for activity. Lowering the concentration of phagosomes decreased the rate and extent of fusion, whereas increasing the concentration of lysosomes had no effect, indicating that a limited number of lysosomes fuse with phagosomes. The increase in fluorescence was not due to chemical changes in the probes caused by their incubation with cytosol (Fig. 2 b). The above experiments were performed with a rather crude preparation of lysosomes obtained by differential centrifugation. Considering that phagosome-lysosome fusion has been much harder to reconstitute in vitro than phagosome-endosome fusion (15Mayorga L.S. Bertini F. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6511-6517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the observed activity could have been due to contamination of this preparation by endosomes. Endosomes were separated from the crude lysosome preparation and identified by the presence of endosomal markers as previously published (25Marie-Cardine A. Fischer S. Gorvel J.P. Maridonneau-Parini I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20734-20739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Endosomes were found to induce an increase in fluorescence when mixed with phagosomes; a 3.2-μg preparation of endosomes produced a 9.6%/h increase in fluorescence, compared with 12%/h for 3.2 μg of purified lysosomes. The endosomal fraction was found to represent 2.1% of the protein present in the purified lysosomal fraction. Therefore, the crude and purified lysosome preparations had similar fusion activities, and a maximum of 1.6% of the total increase in fluorescence measured with the crude lysosome preparation was contributed by contaminating endosomes. The addition of GTP and ATP or an ATP-regenerating system to the cytosol was not essential for the fluorescence increase, in contrast to what was reported for phagosome-lysosome fusion in permeabilized J774 cells (26Funato K. Beron W. Yang C.Z. Mukhopadhyay A. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16147-16151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, in our system, activated cytosol was added at concentrations that produced maximal extents of fluorescence increase. In the presence of less cytosol, the initial rate of fluorescence increase was similar, but the final extent of fusion was lower, indicating that factors contained in the cytosol are present in sufficient quantities to support the activity initially, but soon become exhausted. Intercellular membrane traffic is regulated by GTPases. These are thought to act as switches, actuated by a conformational change in the protein upon GTP hydrolysis. To test the involvement of such proteins, we used the non-hydrolysable GTP analogue GTPγS. It was found that GTPγS reduced the initial rate of fluorescence increase induced by activated cytosol to the level of non-activated cytosol (Fig.4). Inhibition at a comparable GTPγS concentration was seen for phagosome-lysosome fusion in permeabilized J774 cells (26Funato K. Beron W. Yang C.Z. Mukhopadhyay A. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16147-16151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) while fusion of endosomes with phagosomes was shown to be activated by GTPγS (27Jahraus A. Tjelle T.E. Berg T. Habermann A. Storrie B. Ullrich O. Griffiths G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30379-30390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), confirming that fusion with endosomes does not contribute significantly to the measured increase in fluorescence. During phagocytosis-linked lysosome fusion in neutrophils and macrophages, the Src family kinase Hck translocates to phagosomes and is activated. Src family kinases are specifically inhibited by PP1 (28Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). To test the involvement of these proteins, phagosomes and lysosomes were pretreated with PP1, and fusion was measured in the presence of activated cytosol and PP1. It was found that PP1 inhibited the fluorescence increase with a half-maximal concentration of 1 μm (Fig. 4). Half-maximal concentrations for Src kinase inhibition in PMA stimulated intact T cells were around 26 μm (28Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar); in human neutrophils, Hck activity was reported to be completely blocked at 10 μm (29Mocsai A. Ligeti E. Lowell C.A. Berton G. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1120-1126PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these data indicate that specific, efficient phagosome-lysosome fusion was reconstituted in our assay, allowing the quantitative measurement of fusion in real time. M. smegmatis inhibits the biogenesis of phagolysosomes in human neutrophils as much as pathogenic mycobacteria (11N′Diaye E.-N. Darzacq X. Astarie-Dequeker C. Daffé M. Calafat J. Maridonneau-Parini I. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4983-4991PubMed Google Scholar). We then sought to reconstitute the specific inhibitory effect of mycobacteria on phagosome-lysosome fusion in vitro. To this end, NB4 cells were infected with live M. smegmatis (50 bacteria per cell) by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by three washes. This incubation inhibited lysosome exocytosis as witnessed by the lack of β-glucuronidase release during the incubation, compared with β-glucuronidase release from NB4-neutrophils incubated with opsonized zymosan instead of mycobacteria (data not shown). We then prepared cytosol from these M. smegmatis-infected cells and measured fusion in the presence of mixtures of cytosol from these cells and cytosol activated as described above, compared with mixtures of activated cytosol with non-activated cytosol from uninfected cells. The lysosomes and latex bead-containing phagosomes used in these fusion experiments were prepared from non-infected cells, as in the experiments described above. Cytosol from infected cells was found to have a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on fusion (Fig.5 a), thus indicating that it contains factors inhibitory of phagosome-lysosome fusion after a brief incubation of cells with mycobacteria. Inhibition could be due to factors associated with or secreted by mycobacteria, passing into the cytosol through the membrane of the phagosomes, or the neutrophils could produce these factors after interaction with mycobacteria. To test these possibilities, cells were first incubated with heat-killedM. smegmatis, and then cytosol was prepared from these cells (Fig. 5 b). No inhibition of fusion was seen. We then incubated either activated cytosol or a preparation of the plasma membranes plus the cytosol of activated cells with live M. smegmatis and used the cytosol to assay fusion. In both cases, fusion was reduced to the level of non-activated cytosol. These data suggest that factors directly involved in inhibiting fusion are present in the cytosol. The method that we have developed for the labeling of cells with a pair of phospholipid analogues allows quantitative and kinetic measurement of phagosome-lysosome fusion in vitro, without the false positive results that are often produced by assays based on other fluorescent probes that are more easily incorporated into membranes (23Stegmann T. Schoen P. Bron R. Wey J. Bartoldus I. Ortiz A. Nieva J.L. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11330-11337Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The fusion that we measured had the hallmarks of specific phagosome-lysosome fusion; it was not significantly due to contaminating endosomes and it was stimulated by cytosol prepared from cells activated by A23187 and PMA or opsonized zymosan, agents known to mobilize and induce fusion of lysosomes with the plasma membrane and phagosomes, respectively (11N′Diaye E.-N.

Chem. 1997; 272: 102-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Phagocytosis signaling pathways are not well understood; receptor clustering, tyrosine or serine/threonine phosphorylation of substrates such as MARCKS, Ca2+ ions, and arachidonic acid are thought to be involved (30Kwiatkowska K. Sobota A. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 31Ligeti E. Mocsai A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 1209-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Inhibition of phagolysosome biogenesis by PP1 2C. Cougoule and I. Maridonneau-Parini, unpublished data. and other less selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors (33Welch H. Mauran C. Maridonneau-Parini I. Methods. 1996; 9: 607-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) suggest the involvement of tyrosine phosphorylation in intact human neutrophils. In addition we found that activation of Hck, a tyrosine kinase mostly expressed in phagocytes, correlates with phagosome-lysosome fusion in neutrophils (11N′Diaye E.-N. Darzacq X. Astarie-Dequeker C. Daffé M. Calafat J. Maridonneau-Parini I. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4983-4991PubMed Google Scholar, 14Welch H. Maridonneau-Parini I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 102-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the present study, we report that PP1 reduces phagosome-lysosome fusion induced by cytosol from activated cells to the level of non-activated cytosol, providing clear evidence for the involvement of Src family tyrosine kinases in the activation of fusion. Similar to PP1, M. smegmatis also inhibited fusion induced by activated cytosol to the level of non-activated cytosol. It seems as though there are two different types of lysosome-phagosome fusion: one that can be inhibited by these treatments and is only found in activated cells and a non-inhibitable component. However, we think that the non-inhibitable component is due to cytosol that is activated in a fraction of the cells by the act of preparing the cytosol itself, involving various manipulations of the cells, like centrifugation. We have made similar observations using neutrophils isolated from blood; a fraction of the lysosomal enzymes is secreted by non-activated cells (11N′Diaye E.-N. Darzacq X. Astarie-Dequeker C. Daffé M. Calafat J. Maridonneau-Parini I. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4983-4991PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we provide evidence that factors associated with or released by live mycobacteria are present in the cytosol and inhibit phagosome-lysosome fusion. These factors acted when mycobacteria were simply incubated with cytosol, indicating that their phagocytosis is not required for inhibition. Once enclosed in phagosomes, these factors would have to pass the phagosomal membrane to inhibit fusion. Phagosomes containing M. bovis BCG were shown to be permeable to dextrans as large as 70 kDa from the cytoplasm in murine macrophages (34Teitelbaum R. Cammer M. Maitland M.L. Freitag N.E. Condeelis J. Bloom B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15190-15195Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and a number of mycobacterial surface proteins are released from phagosomes into subcellular compartments (35Beatty W.L. Russell D.G. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6997-7002Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Therefore, mycobacterial factors that could be inhibitors of fusion or affect fusion-regulating proteins may be released into the cytosol from phagosomes. Additionally, the entry pathway of mycobacteria into its host cell determines the fate of the phagosome (13Astarie-Dequeker C. N′Diaye E.N. Le Cabec V. Rittig M.G. Prandi J. Maridonneau-Parini I. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 469-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Peyron P. Bordier C. N′Diaye E.-N. Maridonneau-Parini I. J.

Immun. 2000; 68: 4736-4745Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), for example by triggering specific signaling involving host cell proteins and a peripheral murine membrane protein called TACO involved in inhibition of phagolysosome biogenesis in macrophages recruited to the sites of mycobacterial entry and retained on phagosomes containing mycobacteria (9Ferrari G. Langen H. Naito M. Pieters J. Cell. 1999; 97: 435-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 10Gatfield J. Pieters J. Science. 2000; 288: 1647-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide evidence that inhibition of phagosome-lysosome fusion in human neutrophils also involves mycobacterial factors acting in the cytosol. In conclusion, the in vitro reconstitution of fusion and a quantitative and kinetic assay have allowed us to identify the role of Src family tyrosine kinases in phagosome-lysosome fusion stimulated by cytosol from activated cells. Moreover, the in vitro assay could facilitate the search for the mycobacterial factors involved in inhibition of fusion and help to unravel the mechanism of fusion.

We have demonstrated that the association of the auxiliary subunits δ, δ′, χ, and ψ with DnaX4 results in a DnaX complex with an overall stoichiometry of DnaX3δ1δ′1χ1ψ1(29Pritchard A.E. Dallmann H.G. Glover B.P. McHenry C.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6536-6545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DnaX complex formation-mediated transition of DnaX4 to DnaX3 occurs for DnaX complexes containing either or both τ and γ. The portion of DnaX present in τ, and absent in γ (domains IV and V), has recently been shown to be a monomeric (26Dallmann H.G. Kim S. Pritchard A.E. Marians K.J. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15512-15519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, the N-terminal 430 residues common to both τ and γ not only have the minimal protein sequence necessary to bind the auxiliary subunits δ, δ′, χ, and ψ, and load the β processivity factor onto a primed template in an ATP-dependent manner, but also the sequence required to oligomerize DnaX protomers. The binding of the auxiliary subunits to domain III influences the oligomerization state of DnaX during DnaX complex assembly, suggesting that domain III could provide the protein-protein interface responsible for DnaX oligomerization. The focus of this report is to determine which structural domain contained within the portion of DnaX common to both γ and τ (domains I-III) is responsible for the oligomerization of the DnaX protein.

Yeast extract (Ardamine Z) and tryptone used in the fermentor growth of bacteria for protein overexpression were from Universal Flavors (Juneau, WI) and DMV International Nutrition (Fraser, NY), respectively. [3H]Deoxythymidine 5′-triphosphate was purchased from ICN. Nonlabeled nucleotides were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. BS3 was from Pierce. BS3 stock solutions were prepared fresh before every reaction by dissolving BS3 in buffer B (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 5% glycerol, and 50 mm NaCl). An aliquot of the BS3 stock solution was added to the protein immediately and reacted at room temperature for 40 min. Reactions were quenched by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Domain I-II, domain III-V, τ, and γ were cross-linked with 10 μm BS3. Proteins were loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and separated at 25 mA for 2.5 h. The separated proteins were electrotransferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane at 500 mA for 6 h and blocked in MTBS (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5% nonfat milk) overnight at 4 °C. Membrane containing lanes of biotin-tagged domain I-II and domain III-V were biotin-blotted by incubating the membrane with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1:1000 dilution in MTBS) and developed with the enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes containing lanes of τ and γ were immunoblotted with DnaX-specific antibody 527G1 (1:1000 dilution in MTBS). Immunostaining was visualized using a biotinylated secondary anti-mouse antibody (1:1000 dilution in MTBS) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1:1000 dilution in MTBS) and developed with the enhanced chemiluminescent method. Membranes were washed in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) following incubations with the primary antibody, secondary antibody, and the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1 × 15 min and 2 × 5 min). A 24-ml Superose 12 FPLC gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in buffer G (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 250 mm sodium chloride and 5% glycerol) was calibrated with high and low molecular weight gel filtration calibration kits (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blue dextran (A 600 = 650), thyroglobulin (630 μg), ferritin (500 μg), catalase (400 μg), aldolase (200 μg), albumin (500 μg), ovalbumin (500 μg), chymotrypsinogen A (400 μg), ribonuclease A (500 μg), τ (690 μg), γ (630 μg), domain III-V (445 μg), and domain I-II (155 μg) were dissolved in buffer G and loaded (250-μl injection volume) onto the Superose 12 column and developed in buffer G in separate experiments. Gel filtration fractions (0.5 ml) were collected at 4 °C in buffer G with a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Proteins were identified in eluted fractions using the Pierce Coomassie Plus protein assay. Bovine serum albumin (fat-free; Sigma) was used as a protein assay standard. Superose 12 fractions containing NΔ221τ and CΔ422τ were subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at 25 mA for 2.5 h. Subsequently, gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in 20% methanol and 10% acetic acid with destaining being done in 10% methanol and 10% acetic acid. The elution position of blue dextran was used as the Superose 12 void volume. The potential for domain I-II or domain III-V to form heterooligomeric DnaX complexes with intact τ was tested by in vitro incubation followed by a streptavidin bead procedure described elsewhere (36Pritchard A.E. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35217-35222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Either domain I-II or domain III-V (0.17 nmol) was incubated at 15 °C with τ (12.6 μg, 0.17 nmol) in a volume made up to 20 μl with buffer S (20 mmTris (pH 7.5), 25 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol) and NaCl added to a final concentration of 90 mm. After 2 h the incubation mixture was added to an 11.2-μl volume on ice containing δ′ (8.25 μg, 0.22 nmol), δ (8.6 μg, 0.22 nmol), and χψ (6.9 μg, 0.22 nmol). The mixtures were flash-frozen and stored at −70 °C prior to the streptavidin bead procedure, which purifies biotinylated proteins and their associated complexes away from nonbiotinylated proteins (36Pritchard A.E. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35217-35222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The purified complexes were removed from the beads by boiling in an SDS-PAGE loading buffer and then analyzed by gel electrophoresis. We utilized two plasmids, each encoding specific structural domains of τ (Fig.1 A) under control of an inducible promoter described previously (20Gao D. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4447-4453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Plasmid PA1-NΔ221τ encoded protein NΔ221τ (domain III-V). This protein has 221 amino acids deleted from the full-length τ's N terminus with a fusion peptide added to the new N terminus. The plasmid pET11-CΔ422τ encoded protein CΔ422τ (domain I-II). This protein has 422 amino acids deleted from the full-length τ's C terminus with a fusion peptide added to the new C terminus. Each of these proteins possessed a fusion peptide that contained a hexahistidine sequence allowing purification via Ni2+-NTA metal affinity chromatography, and a short biotinylation sequence facilitating their detection by biotin blotting. Both domain III-V (Fig. 1 B,lanes 1–3) and domain I-II (Fig. 1 C, lanes 1–3) were purified to >85% purity as determined by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels. Biotin blotting demonstrated that domain III-V (Fig. 1 B, lane 6) and domain I-II (1C, lane 6) were the only biotinylated proteins present in the final purified preparation. Neither domain III-V nor domain I-II possess the ability to reconstitute DNA polymerase activity due to the absence of the δδ′χψ binding domain (domain III) and ATPase active site, respectively. Chemical cross-linking is a well established method allowing for the identification of protein-protein interactions within multisubunit complexes (37Wolf B.B. Gonias S.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11270-11277Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 38Handler C.G. Eisenberg R.J. Cohen G.H. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6067-6070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Carter G.J. van Holde K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12477-12488Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Previously we employed the homobifunctional cross-linking reagent BS3 in demonstrating that the auxiliary subunits δ, δ′, χ, and ψ bind to γ, and not τ, within authentic holoenzyme (6Glover B.P. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3017-3020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We found that treatment of DnaX or the DnaX complex with BS3 produced covalent cross-links between proteins within the same complex. We used BS3 as a tool to determine whether domain I-II and domain III-V formed homooligomers. We treated DnaX domains I-II, III-V, γ, and τ with 10 μm BS3. Reaction products were visualized by biotin blotting (domain I-II and domain III-V) and Western blotting with a DnaX-specific monoclonal antibody (for γ and τ). No high molecular weight cross-link bands were evident in reactions containing domain I-II (Fig. 2, compare lanes 1and 2). A distinct band that migrates as a 159-kDa protein relative to markers was observed in domain III-V BS3 cross-linking reaction (compare lanes 3 and 4). The predicted molecular weights for a dimer, trimer, and tetramer of domain III-V are 100, 150, and 200 kDa, respectively. Because only one high molecular weight cross-link band is observed with no intermediate, smaller bands being apparent, the 150-kDa species is probably a dimer of domain III-V. Cross-linked proteins joined near their termini would be expected to migrate with a molecular weight consistent with the additive weights of the their components. Proteins within the same complex, which cross-link at internal positions to each other, exhibit apparent molecular weights larger than the additive weights of the complex components. These “X-shaped” cross-linked protein complexes migrate more slowly through the SDS-polyacrylamide matrix during electrophoresis. Thus, our observation is consistent with the conclusion that the 159-kDa cross-link band is a dimer of domain III-V. That we observe only cross-link dimers and not significant levels of higher order proteins likely reflects that the single lysine in domain III is not symmetrically distributed within either the native DnaX tetramer or cross-linked species after distortions induced by the initial cross-link. We observed that both γ and τ, which are each homotetramers in solution (29Pritchard A.E. Dallmann H.G. Glover B.P. McHenry C.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6536-6545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), produced principal BS3-dependent cross-linking products that migrate as 153 kDa (compare lanes 5 and 6) and 219 kDa (compare lanes 7 and8), respectively. These bands probably represent dimeric species that migrated larger than their predicted size (95 and 142 kDa, respectively) for reasons explained in the preceding paragraph. Therefore, just like domain III-V, cross-linking of τ and γ produced one high molecular weight cross-link band as the only significant cross-linked species, suggesting that the DnaX tetramer is not symmetrical but perhaps a dimer of dimers. This would permit cross-linking between two protomers within the dimer but not cross-linking between associated dimers (or vice versa). Domain III, absent in the domain I-II protein, is the only domain in common to domain III-V, γ, and τ implying that BS3 cross-linking is domain III-dependent. We have demonstrated previously that domain IV-V is monomeric and does not form higher ordered complexes either with itself or full-length DnaX (26Dallmann H.G. Kim S. Pritchard A.E. Marians K.J. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15512-15519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because we observed high molecular weight cross-link bands only in DnaX proteins that contain domain III suggests that BS3 cross-links arise from a domain III-domain III self-interaction within the same DnaX homooligomer. The ability of domain III-containing DnaX proteins to produce high molecular weight cross-link bands suggests that domain III-V forms an oligomer, and domain I-II is monomeric. To test this hypothesis further, we gel-filtered domain I-II and domain III-V in addition to protein standards on a 24-ml Superose 12 FPLC column. We found that domain III-V eluted in fractions 16–21 corresponding to an elution volume of 9.5 ml (Fig. 3, A andB). Fraction 16 contained aggregated domain III-V protein running near the void volume just like we often observe for a fraction of full-length recombinant DnaX during the purification. Domain I-II eluted as a single peak in fractions 28–30 corresponding to an elution volume of 14.5 ml (Fig. 3, C and D). A plot of elution position of domain I-II and domain III-V relative to standards (Fig. 3 E) yielded Stokes radii of 24 and 70 Å for domain I-II and domain III-V, respectively. Gel filtration indicates that domain I-II elutes at a volume consistent with its monomeric molecular mass of 28.1 kDa, while domain III-V appears much larger than its monomeric molecular mass of 49.9 kDa. Using the Stokes radii of domain I-II and domain III-V alone, without correction for asymmetry, we obtain predicted globular molecular masses of 30.1 kDa for domain I-II and 490 kDa for domain III-V. As a control we gel filtered γ and τ and determined their Stokes radius to be 57 and 79 Å, respectively. These radii are similar to the reported values of 67 Å for γ and 80 Å for τ (40Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Naktinis V. Turner J. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13348-13357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Using the measured Stokes radii of γ and τ we obtain predicted molecular masses of 312 and 611 kDa, respectively. These predicted values are substantially larger than the calculated values expected for γ and τ tetramers (190 and 284 kDa) if the proteins behaved as ideal globular proteins. This aberrant behavior observed with γ and τ was also observed with the oligomeric domain III-V protein. To determine a molecular mass for domain III-V accounting for the asymmetry of DnaX oligomers, a standard graph was prepared correlating the apparent and the calculated tetrameric molecular masses of τ and γ. Using the experimentally determined domain III-V uncorrected molecular mass of 490 kDa, a value of 245 kDa was determined for the domain III-V oligomer from the standard graph. Taken together, these data indicate that domain I-II is monomeric, lacking the oligomerization domain, whereas domain III-V does contain the protein interaction surface (domain III) required for DnaX self-association. In the absence of the other holoenzyme subunits, DnaX exists as a tetramer. We have demonstrated that the association of the auxiliary subunits δ, δ′, χ, and ψ with domain III of DnaX4 results in a DnaX complex with an overall stoichiometry of DnaX3δδ′χψ (20Gao D. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4447-4453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 29Pritchard A.E. Dallmann H.G. Glover B.P. McHenry C.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6536-6545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After having identified domain III as the sequence necessary to facilitate DnaX oligomerization, we determined whether domain III-V could assemble into a mixed DnaX complex containing τ and the auxiliary subunits δ, δ′, χ, and ψ. We examined whether domain III could bind τ along with δ, δ′, and χψ forming a mixed DnaX complex. We have previously demonstrated that complexes containing biotin-tagged DnaX can be purified on streptavidin-coated agarose beads and then eluted from the beads and analyzed by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels (36Pritchard A.E. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35217-35222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We found that individually, the biotin-tagged domain I-II and domain III-V proteins were capable of binding streptavidin-coated agarose beads (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1and 2). Domain I-II protein (arrow), migrating slightly larger than a contaminant protein band from the streptavidin beads, is much less intense than the domain III-V protein (arrow), although equimolar amounts of each were applied to the beads. This result is consistent with domain I-II binding as a monomer but domain III-V as an oligomer. The fact that only a portion of expressed fusion proteins are biotinylated magnifies the difference in domain I-II versus domain III-V binding to beads. From studies with the intact biotin-tagged τ fusion protein, we know that only 10–30% of the total protein applied to the streptavidin beads actually binds, and it can be calculated, assuming a binomial distribution of biotinylated τ, that only 3–8% of τ fusion protein monomers are biotinylated (36Pritchard A.E. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35217-35222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Most of the tetramers that bind to the beads therefore contain only one biotinylated monomer. If domain III-V binds to the beads as a tetramer with only one biotin per tetramer, and domain I-II binds as a monomer, the former would bind 7-fold more protein than the latter if differences in monomer molecular masses are also considered. A 6-fold difference was measured by scanning the gel (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1 and2) with a laser densitometer. Domain I-II or domain III-V was incubated with wild-type τ, lacking a biotin tag, to allow τ protomers to interact with protomers of tagged domain proteins. It has been demonstrated that the addition of the auxiliary subunits δ, δ′, χ, and ψ prevents the incorporation of a DnaX protomer into a DnaX complex (36Pritchard A.E. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35217-35222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 41Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Turner J. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13366-13377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We incubated a mixture of τ and the auxiliary subunits, which form a τ-only DnaX complex, with domain I-II or domain III-V to establish a “zero” time point (Fig. 4 A, lanes 3 and 4). No τ is seen associated with domain I-II, and only a small amount of τ is bound to domain III-V. However, when domain I-II or domain III-V was incubated with τ for 2 h before the reaction was quenched by the addition of δ, δ ′, χ and ψ, a large amount of τ is seen associated with the domain III-V protein but none with the domain I-II protein (Fig. 4 A, lanes 5 and 6). This demonstrates that domain I-II could not recruit τ and the auxiliary subunits onto the beads, while domain III-V, because it contained domain III, was able to form a mixed DnaX complex containing τ, δ, δ′, χ, and ψ. In a control experiment containing τ, δ, δ′, χ, and ψ,but no tagged domain protein, no τ was seen associated with the streptavidin beads due to nonspecific interactions. (Fig.4 A, lane 7). We conclude domain III-V is capable of forming a DnaX complex with τ and the auxiliary subunits (Fig.4 B). The DnaX complex from the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme is a multiprotein subunit complex that assembles the β processivity factor onto DNA in an ATP-dependent reaction. In this study, we identified the DnaX oligomerization domain by examining the properties of truncated τ proteins lacking specific domains. Our results indicate that domain III (amino acid residues 222–382) shared by γ and τ binds to domain III of other DnaX protomers, leading to oligomerization. BS3, which chemically cross-links primary amines, has been used extensively as an assay for protein-protein interactions, not only between different proteins, but also between protomers within homooligomeric complexes (6Glover B.P. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3017-3020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 37Wolf B.B. Gonias S.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11270-11277Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 38Handler C.G. Eisenberg R.J. Cohen G.H. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6067-6070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Carter G.J. van Holde K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12477-12488Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We employed BS3 cross-linking to determine whether domain III functions as the oligomerization domain in DnaX. As a positive control, we cross-linked tetrameric DnaX proteins, which contain domain III (γ and τ) and a protein that lacks domain III (domain I-II). Previously we have demonstrated that the portion of DnaX present in τ and absent in γ (domain IV-V) is monomeric and does not form oligomers either with itself or with full-length DnaX (29Pritchard A.E. Dallmann H.G. Glover B.P. McHenry C.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6536-6545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We observed that BS3 cross-linking of domain III-V, τ, and γ, but not domain I-II, resulted in the appearance of high molecular mass cross-link bands. Specifically, cross-linking results with domain III-V mirrored those of the positive control reactions with τ and γ. When domain III was absent (negative control) in the DnaX protein (domain I-II), no high molecular mass cross-link bands are observed. Because BS3 cross-linking was only observed in DnaX proteins containing domain III, and that both γ and τ have been previously demonstrated to be oligomeric, implies that domain III-V is also oligomeric. In addition to the cross-linking results, the Stokes radii measured for domain III-V (70 Å) and domain I-II (24 Å) demonstrate different oligomerization states for domain III-V and domain I-II. Domain I-II behaved as a monomeric protein in gel filtration, while domain III-V eluted at a volume consistent with it being oligomeric. Just like in the purification of native DnaX, we observed some aggregated, presumably incompletely folded, material eluting in the excluded volume. The majority of domain III-V eluted in the included volume in a defined peak and at a molecular mass consistent with it being an asymmetrically shaped tetramer just like τ and γ. Oligomers of DnaX proteins are asymmetric in shape as the Stokes radii of domain III-V, γ, and τ predict molecular mass values for the proteins substantially larger than values expected for tetrameric forms (5Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29563-29569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Using the experimentally determined domain III-V molecular mass of 490 kDa, a value of 245 kDa was estimated for the domain III-V oligomer from a standard graph. The estimated molecular mass of domain III-V suggests that it exists either as a tetramer or pentamer in solution. This value is an approximation and may reflect domain III-V's further asymmetry over γ and τ due to its long unstructured biotin/hexahistidine tag absent in the native DnaX standards. Nevertheless, whether domain III-V is a tetramer or pentamer does not change the overall conclusion that DnaX proteins containing domain III are oligomeric, while those lacking domain III are monomeric. The concentration of domain III-V and domain I-II in the gel filtration column load and peak fraction was 35 and 3.6 μm (as monomer) for domain III-V and 22 and 2.1 μm (as monomer) for domain I-II. The K D for the γ and τ monomer-tetramer equilibrium is 170 nm (29Pritchard A.E. Dallmann H.G. Glover B.P. McHenry C.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6536-6545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Assuming that a single domain contains all the protein sequence required for DnaX oligomerization, either domain I-II or domain III-V would be expected to be able to form a DnaX oligomer under the gel filtration experimental conditions if it contained the self-association domain. This infers that the inability of domain I-II to oligomerize was not due to dilution on the gel filtration column but because it lacked domain III. Domain III-V recruited full-length τ into heteromeric DnaX complexes containing δ, δ′, χ, and ψ. Using a streptavidin-coated bead procedure, we found that the presence of domain III was sufficient to form a DnaX complex, which contained domain III-V, τ, δ, δ′, χ, and ψ (Fig. 4B). Domain I-II, which lacks domain III, was unable to recruit τ, δ, δ′, χ, and ψ onto the beads. We have demonstrated previously that domain IV-V present in τ is unable to form oligomers with itself and cannot bind the auxiliary subunits δ, δ′, χ, and ψ (26Dallmann H.G. Kim S. Pritchard A.E. Marians K.J. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15512-15519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This demonstrates that domain III not only binds the auxiliary subunits (20Gao D. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4447-4453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) but also functions as the DnaX oligomerization domain recruiting τ to the beads through a direct domain III-domain III interaction. Like clamp-loading complexes from eukaryotes, subunit components within the DnaX complex share both a sequence and possible structural similarity with each other. The auxiliary subunit δ′ shares a high sequence similarity to the N-terminal domain I-III of DnaX but cannot form higher homooligomeric complexes (27Guenther B. Onrust R. Sali A. O'Donnell M.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6536-6545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have proposed that this mechanism involves the replacement of one homologous protein (one DnaX protomer) with another (δ′) during complex formation. Perhaps it is because DnaX oligomerizes through domain III that the binding of δ′ to domain III affects the oligomerization state of τ and γ. When δ′ binds to domain III, it may replace a DnaX protomer by substituting a DnaX-DnaX interaction with a DnaX-δ′ contact."

The receptor for this hormone has also been demonstrated to represent a clinically useful pharmacological target, activated by erythromycin (3Janssens J. Peeters T.L. Vantrappen G. Tack J.

Using a unique high throughput screen of compounds that can interact with cloned orphan receptors, the cDNA encoding the human motilin receptor (originally isolated as orphan clone GPR38) was finally identified in 1999 (8Feighner S.D. Tan C.P. McKee K.K. Palyha O.C. Hreniuk D.L. Pong S.S. Austin C.P. Figueroa D. MacNeil D. Cascieri M.A. Nargund R. Bakshi R. Abramovitz M. Stocco R. Kargman S. O'Neill G. VanDerPloeg L.H.T. Evans J.

Sequence analysis demonstrated that this represents a member of a new subgroup within the Class I family of G protein-coupled receptors that is defined by structural homology with a series of growth hormone secretagogue receptors (9Howard A.D.

The motilin receptor is 52% identical to the human growth hormone secretagogue receptor, with 86% sequence identity in the predicted transmembrane domains (8Feighner S.D. Tan C.P. McKee K.K.

Because this group of receptors has only been recognized for a short time, no specific receptor domains of importance for binding or activation have yet been identified. Better understanding of the molecular basis of activation of this receptor by its natural ligand may provide important insights for drug development. Many existing structure-activity studies have focused on the relationship between the structure of motilin, the natural peptide ligand, and its ability to bind to or to stimulate contractile activity of natural motilin receptor-bearing gastrointestinal smooth muscle tissue (5Peeters T.L.

Protein Res. 1995; 46: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). These studies have demonstrated that the amino-terminal portion of motilin, including residues 1–9, is devoid of any activity, while extension of this domain beyond the first nine residues restores binding and biological activity (6Poitras P. Gagnon D. St Pierre S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 8Feighner S.D. Tan C.P. McKee K.K. Palyha O.C. Hreniuk D.L. Pong S.S. Austin C.P.

Science. 1999; 284: 2184-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Such observations have established that the pharmacophoric domain of this hormone represents its amino-terminal decapeptide. The carboxyl-terminal region of motilin forms an α-helix that is thought to stabilize the interaction of the critical amino-terminal residues at the active site of the receptor (7Miller P. Gagnon D. Dickner M. Aubin P. St-Pierre S. Poitras P. Peptides. 1995; 16: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this work, we have attempted to develop the tools necessary to begin to gain an understanding of the molecular basis of motilin binding to its receptor. This included the establishment of a cell line that expresses a high density of functional motilin receptors and the development of a radioiodinatable motilin analogue that incorporates a photolabile residue within this critical pharmacophoric domain of the natural peptide ligand. In the present work, we have developed and fully characterized these reagents and have applied them to the photoaffinity labeling of the motilin receptor and to the initial identification of distinct subdomains within that molecule. The [Bpa1,Ile13]motilin probe was shown to covalently label the motilin receptor within two cyanogen bromide fragments, with one including its large second extracellular loop, a structurally unique and functionally important region. The solid phase oxidant,N-chlorobenzenesulfonamide (Iodo-beads), was from Pierce Chemical Co. Endoglycosidase F was prepared in our laboratory, as we have reported (13Pearson R.K. Miller L.J. Hadac E.M. Powers S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13850-13856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fura-2AM was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Other reagents were analytical grade. The wild type human motilin receptor cDNA was kindly provided by Merck Research Laboratories, Rahway, NJ. We established a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line stably expressing the wild type human motilin receptor (CHO-MtlR) by transfecting CHO-K1 cells with the motilin receptor cDNA construct (8Feighner S.D. Tan C.P. McKee K.K. Palyha O.C. Hreniuk D.L. Pong S.S. Austin C.P. Figueroa D. MacNeil D. Cascieri M.A. Nargund R. Bakshi R. Abramovitz M. Stocco R. Kargman S. O'Neill G. VanDerPloeg L.H.T. Evans J. Patchett A.A. Smith R.G. Howard A.D. Science. 1999; 284: 2184-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). A clonal cell line was selected by repeated cycles of limiting dilution, screening for motilin radioligand binding (as described below). This cell line was used as a source of receptor for the current study. Cells were cultured at 37 °C on tissue culture plasticware in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% Fetal Clone-2 (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT). Cells were passaged twice a week and were lifted mechanically after incubation in cell dissociation medium before membrane preparation or study of intact cells. Enriched plasma membranes from these cell lines were prepared as previously described (14Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Mutant motilin receptor constructs were prepared using an oligonucleotide-directed approach (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis system, Stratagene). Two such constructs were prepared for this work, representing replacement of motilin receptor residues Leu98and Ile185 with Met residues (L98M and I185M motilin receptors). These residues were in positions predicted to reside in the second transmembrane segment and in the second extracellular loop domain. Sequences of these constructs were confirmed by direct DNA sequencing (15Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52250) Google Scholar). These receptor constructs were expressed transiently on COS cells after transfection using a modification of the DEAE-dextran method (16Lopata M.A. Cleveland D.W. Sollner-Webb B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5707-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Sixty hours after transfection, cells were lifted mechanically, and enriched plasma membranes were prepared using the method previously described (14Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Human motilin-(1–22) (motilin), [Ile13]motilin, and [Bpa1,Ile13]motilin peptides (Fig.1) were synthesized by manual solid-phase techniques using Boc-protected amino acids, hydroxybenzotriazol, and Pam resin. d,l-Bpa was prepared as described (17Kauer J.C. Erickson-Viitanen S. Wolfe H.R. DeGrado W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10695-10700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Nakamoto C. Behar V. Chin K.R. Adams A.E. Suva L.J. Rosenblatt M. Chorev M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10546-10552Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The synthetic products were purified to homogeneity by sequential reversed-phase HPLC separations (19Powers S.P. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. Int. J. Pept. Protein. Res. 1988; 31: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Identities of the peptides were determined by quantitative amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry. l- and d-Bpa stereoisomers were identified using the technique of Miller and Kaiser (20Miller W.T. Kaiser E.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5429-5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), involving the full cleavage of the peptide containing the L form and limited or absent cleavage of the peptide containing the D form with amino peptidase M. The l-Bpa peptide was used in the current studies. [Ile13]motilin and [Bpa1,Ile13]motilin were radioiodinated oxidatively on Tyr residues in position 7 of each peptide using Na125I and a 15 s exposure to the solid phase oxidant,N-chlorobenzene-sulfonamide (Iodo-beads). The products were purified to homogeneity by reversed-phase HPLC to yield specific radioactivities of 2,000 Ci/mmol (19Powers S.P. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. Int. J. Pept. Protein. Res. 1988; 31: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The agonist activities of motilin and [Bpa1,Ile13]motilin were studied using an assay for stimulation of intracellular calcium activity in the CHO-MtlR cell line or COS cells expressing motilin receptor mutants. In this assay, ∼2 million cells were loaded with 5 μm Fura-2AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in Krebs-Ringer-HEPES medium (KRH) containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 104 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm KH2PO4, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor. They were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. After washing, cells were stimulated with variable concentrations of motilin or [Bpa1,Ile13]motilin at 37 °C. Fluorescence was quantified in a Perkin-Elmer LS50B luminescence spectrometer (Norwalk, CT). Excitation was performed at 340 and 380 nm, and emissions were determined at 520 nm, with calcium concentration calculated from the ratios, as described by Grynkiewicz et al. (21Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The peak intracellular calcium transient was utilized to determine the agonist concentration dependence of the biological responses. All assays were performed in duplicate and repeated at least three times in independent experiments. Radioligand binding assays utilized intact motilin receptor-bearing cells or an enriched plasma membrane fraction of these cells (1–10 μg per tube),125I-[Ile13]motilin (3–5 pmradioligand) and KRH medium. Incubations were for 60 min at 25 °C. The intact cell binding assay was performed in a 24-well tissue culture plates, while the membrane binding assay utilized separation of bound and free radioligand using the Skatron apparatus (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and receptor-binding filtermats. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm motilin and represented less than 20% of total binding. Photoaffinity labeling was performed using enriched plasma membrane preparations (100 μg per tube) and the radioiodinated photolabile analogue of motilin described above (100 pm). Incubations were performed for 60 min in the dark at 25 °C. After binding, membranes were exposed to photolysis for 30 min at 4 °C using a Rayonet Photochemical Reactor (Southern New England Ultraviolet, Hamden, CT) equipped with 3500 Å lamps. For selected experiments, the affinity-labeled motilin receptor and its relevant fragments were deglycosylated with endoglycosidase F under the conditions we previously reported (22Hadac E.M. Pinon D.I. Ji Z. Holicky E.L. Henne R. Lybrand T. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12988-12993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Membranes were then washed, solubilized, and separated by gel electrophoresis using either Laemmli conditions with 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels or 10% NuPAGE gels (InVitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Labeled products were visualized by autoradiography. Gel-purified, affinity-labeled native and deglycosylated motilin receptor were digested with cyanogen bromide in 70% formic acid, according to the procedure previously described (22Hadac E.M. Pinon D.I. Ji Z. Holicky E.L. Henne R. Lybrand T. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12988-12993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The products of cleavage were separated on 10% NuPAGE gels using MES running buffer, with labeled products visualized by autoradiography. The apparent molecular masses of radiolabeled receptor fragments were determined by interpolation on a plot of the mobility of Multimark™ protein standards (InVitrogen) versus the log values of their apparent masses. All observations were repeated at least three times in independent experiments and are expressed as means ± S.E. Binding curves were analyzed using the LIGAND program of Munson and Rodbard (23Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7759) Google Scholar) and were plotted using the nonlinear regression analysis routine for radioligand binding in the Prism software package (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). A clonal cell line stably expressing motilin receptors was established (CHO-MtlR). The binding of motilin to the human motilin receptors expressed on these cells was specific, saturable, and high affinity, with a K i of 2.3 ± 0.4 nm motilin (Fig. 2). The calculated receptor density on these cells was 175,000 sites per cell. Motilin induced a rise in intracellular calcium concentration in CHO-MtlR cells in a concentration-dependent manner, with an EC50 = 0.3 ± 0.1 nm motilin (Fig. 2). [Bpa1,Ile13]motilin contains a photolabile Bpa in the position of Phe1 as a site for covalent attachment to the receptor and a Tyr residue that is naturally present in position 7 as a site for radioiodination. An Ile residue was incorporated in the position of Met13 to eliminate a site for potential oxidative damage during radiolabeling. This motilin analogue was synthesized by manual solid-phase techniques, purified by reversed-phase HPLC, and characterized chemically by mass spectrometry. The l- and d-Bpa stereoisomers of this probe were separated and identified (20Miller W.T. Kaiser E.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5429-5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), with thel-stereoisomer used in the described studies. The binding of [Bpa1,Ile13]motilin to the human motilin receptor was saturable and specific, but displayed a slightly lower affinity (K i = 12.4 ± 1.0 nm) than natural motilin (Fig.3). This analogue was a full agonist, inducing a rise in intracellular calcium concentration in CHO-MtlR cells in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC50 = 1.5 ± 0.2 nm (Fig. 3). Membranes prepared from CHO-MtlR were used as source of receptor for affinity labeling. The125I-[Bpa1,Ile13]motilin analogue covalently saturably labeled two membrane proteins from these cells that migrated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel at M r= 78,000 and at M r = 58,000, with the former representing greater than 90% of labeling (Fig.4). Photoaffinity labeling of each of these bands was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner with increasing concentrations of competing unlabeled motilin (IC50 between 1 and 10 nm motilin). Each band had similar apparent affinity for this probe, raising the possibility that they represented distinct glycoforms of a single protein, representing the motilin receptor. Deglycosylation of each of the glycoprotein bands with endoglycosidase F resulted in bands that migrated similarly at approximate M r = 45,000 (Fig. 5). This corresponds with the expected mass of the core receptor protein. As control, labeled bands of this size were absent in affinity-labeled CHO cell membranes lacking the human motilin receptor.Figure 5Deglycosylation of the human motilin receptor. Shown are representative autoradiographs of the deglycosylation of the saturably labeled bands from the CHO-MtlR cell membranes using endoglycosidase F. This treatment resulted in similar electrophoretic migration of both of the receptor glycoforms atM r = 45,000.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig.6 shows the ten fragments that would theoretically be obtained after cyanogen bromide cleavage of the human motilin receptor, ranging in mass from less than 1 to 12 kDa. Conditions for quantitative cleavage of this receptor with cyanogen bromide were established and applied. The spectrum of molecular masses and the presence of glycosylation at distinct sites within the amino terminus and second extracellular loop may, therefore, provide suggestive evidence for the identification of the domain being labeled using this single manipulation. Cyanogen bromide cleavage of the M r = 78,000 band covalently labeled by125I-[Bpa1,Ile13]motilin resulted in two distinct labeled bands (Fig. 6). These had apparent migrations of M r = 6,000 and M r = 31,000. The migration of the M r = 6,000 fragment did not shift further after deglycosylation with endoglycosidase F. Similar treatment of the M r = 31,000 fragment resulted in its shifting to apparent M r = 21,000. Considering the mass of the covalently bound ligand probe (2,909 Da) and the glycosylation status of the labeled bands, the most probable identifications of these bands were the cyanogen bromide fragments that included the first and second extracellular loop domains. To further establish these identities, two motilin receptor mutants were constructed that introduced additional sites of cyanogen bromide cleavage at new Met residues within each of these candidate domains. These included L98M and I185M motilin receptor constructs. Fig.7 shows that motilin bound with normal affinity (K i values of 3.4 ± 2.5 nm motilin at the L98M receptor and 7.0 ± 0.8 nm motilin at the I185M receptor) and stimulated a normal intracellular calcium concentration response in both of these receptor constructs (EC50 values of 1.8 ± 0.6 nmmotilin at the L98M receptor and 3.7 ± 0.6 nm motilin at the I185M receptor). The 125I-[Bpa1,Ile13]motilin probe efficiently and saturably labeled the wild type and mutant motilin receptor constructs expressed on the COS cells (Fig.8). Glycosylation of the motilin receptor was different in the COS cells from that in the CHO cell line, with the labeled glycosylated cyanogen bromide fragment in the COS cells migrating as a broad band between M r = 42,000–52,000 rather than at M r = 31,000 (observed in the CHO cell line). Each of the non-glycosylated fragments from both cell types migrated similarly. Fig. 8 shows the effects of cyanogen bromide cleavage of the labeled receptor constructs. As predicted, the labeled M r = 6,000 band from the wild type receptor shifted to approximately M r = 5,000 in the L98M receptor. Also as expected, the labeled glycosylatedM r = 42,000 band from the wild type receptor shifted to a non-glycosylated M r = 12,000 band in the I185M receptor construct. These results definitively confirmed the identities of the labeled cyanogen bromide fragments of the motilin receptor and refined the labeled domains. The domains labeled include the region between receptor residues 99 and 129 and that between residues 130 and 185. The G protein-coupled receptor superfamily is remarkable for the diversity of structures of its natural agonist ligands, ranging from extremely small photons, odorants, and biogenic amines to larger peptides, glycoproteins, and even viral particles. It is well recognized that these receptors can be clustered based on sequence homology, with structurally related groups often representing targets of structurally related ligands (24Kolakowski L.F. Recept. Channels. 1994; 2: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar). It has been assumed that themes of ligand binding are analogous in closely related receptors within this superfamily. There is substantial structural homology between the motilin receptor and the previously cloned growth hormone secretagogue receptors (8Feighner S.D. Tan C.P. McKee K.K. Palyha O.C. Hreniuk D.L.

With the recent identification of natural ligands for one of the growth hormone secretagogue receptors (a 28-amino acid peptide, ghrelin, and its splice variant representing des-Gln14-ghrelin) (25Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Nature. 1999; 402: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (7104) Google Scholar, 26Hosoda H. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21995-22000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), a structural relationship between these ligands and motilin also became clear. Alignment of motilin with ghrelin revealed that 8 of its 22 amino acid residues were identical (motilin residues Phe5, Glu9, Gln11, Arg12, Gln14, Lys16, Glu17, and Lys20). Of interest, these were distributed throughout motilin, with several of these residues present within the amino-terminal pharmacophoric domain of this hormone. In this work, we have established a CHO-MtlR cell line that overexpresses the fully functional recombinant human motilin receptor, and we have developed a radioiodinatable analogue of motilin that incorporates a photolabile residue within the pharmacophoric domain, in position 1 of this peptide. This probe represents a full agonist that binds to the motilin receptor with high affinity and that efficiently covalently labels two glycoforms of this molecule that are expressed on these cells. It efficiently labeled two cyanogen bromide fragments of the receptor that include the first and second extracellular loop domains. This is consistent with the pharmacophoric domain of motilin being held in close proximity to these regions of the receptor. These data provide the first direct evidence for molecular approximations between a residue within a motilin-like agonist and this receptor, and begin the definition of important domains within this receptor. It is of particular interest that alignment of the motilin receptor with the growth hormone secretagogue receptors reveals that this large second extracellular loop domain that is covalently labeled in this study is absent in the growth hormone secretagogue receptors. There is a 40-residue insertion in the motilin receptor relative to those receptors in this region. An analogous region can, therefore, not be involved in the binding of ghrelin ligands to those receptors. It is noteworthy that ghrelin and des-Gln14-ghrelin both have a unique post-translational modification, representingN-octanoylation of Ser3, that has been shown to be necessary for their biological activity, the pulsatile secretion of growth hormone (25Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Nature. 1999; 402: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (7104) Google Scholar, 26Hosoda H. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21995-22000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). No such modification has been described for motilin. It is quite possible that this biologically essential fatty acid acylation of the natural ligands for the growth hormone secretagogue receptors establishes a distinct mode of binding from that observed for the receptor that normally interacts with non-acylated motilin. The incorporation of a modification that is so hydrophobic may bring these ligands closer to the lipid bilayer for their sites of recognition than for a non-modified peptide ligand. The active sites of G protein-coupled receptors are of substantial interest for rational drug design. The identification of the ligand-binding domain of the human motilin receptor may lead to the development of more selective and potent agonists acting at this important receptor. Particularly in view of the well described gastrointestinal prokinetic properties of motilin and of the established clinical efficacy for the non-peptidyl motilin receptor ligand, erythromycin (4Peeters T.L.

https://openalex.org/W1986635147,"The Maf oncoprotein is a basic leucine zipper (bZip)-bearing transcriptional activator that recognizes the Maf recognition element (MARE) DNA sequence. In this study, we investigated the role of Maf's transactivation function in cell transformation. Replacement of the conserved amino terminus transactivator domain of Maf by a heterologous and stronger transactivator domain (the acidic transactivator domain of VP16) resulted in enhanced transformation of chicken embryo fibroblast cells. In contrast, the fusing of a transcriptional repressor domain (Sin3 interaction domain of Mxi1) with the whole Maf protein masked the transactivator function of Maf, which in turn inhibited its transforming activity. Furthermore, the leucine zipper domain of Maf, which defines its dimer-forming specificity, was exchangeable with that of GCN4 yeast protein in terms of its transactivating and cell transforming activities. Thus, heterodimer formation with other bZip factors is not required for Maf's ability to transform. These results together suggest that transactivation through MARE is necessary for Maf-induced transformation and that there exist downstream target gene(s) for transformation. Since the MARE sequence overlaps with the recognition element of another bZip oncoprotein Jun, we assessed whether Jun and Maf induce cell transformation through activating the same genes. We thus constructed a mutated version of Jun that has a GCN4 leucine zipper and lacks the transactivator domain. This mutant repressed the cell transformation not only by Jun but also by Maf. Thus, Maf and Jun share downstream target gene(s) that are involved in cell transformation.

It induces musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma in chickens and transforms primary chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF)1 cells (1Nishizawa M. Kataoka K. Goto N. Fujiwara K.T. Kawai S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7711-7715Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Analysis of the genome structures of the AS42 provirus and its cellular counterpart c-maf revealed that v-Maf does not differ structurally from c-Maf except that it fused to viral Gag protein at the initiator methionine residue of c-Maf (2Kawai S. Goto N. Kataoka K. Saegusa T. Shinno-Kohno H. Nishizawa M. Virology. 1992; 188: 778-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Supporting this finding is the observation that c-maf efficiently transforms CEF cells when it is expressed under the control of the retroviral promoter (3Kataoka K. Nishizawa M. Kawai S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2133-2141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, c-maf was found to be overexpressed in some human multiple myelomas due to its chromosomal translocation to the immunoglobulin locus (4Chesi M. Bergsagel P.L. Shonukan O.O. Martelli M.L. Brents L.A. Chen T. Schrœck E. Ried T. Kuehl W.M. Blood. 1998; 91: 4457-4463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Up-regulation of c-maf expression was also found in mouse melanoma cells that were induced by the insertion of the melanoma-associated retrovirus (5Li M. Huang X. Zhu Z. Gorelik E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9178-9186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Maf protein bears a basic leucine zipper (bZip) structure at its carboxyl terminus, through which the protein forms homodimers (1Nishizawa M. Kataoka K. Goto N. Fujiwara K.T. Kawai S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7711-7715Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Maf preferably binds to the palindromic DNA sequences TGCTGACTCAGCA and TGCTGACGTCAGCA, which we have denoted as Maf recognition elements (MAREs) (6Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kerppola T.K. Curran T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 675-684PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 53-62PubMed Google Scholar). The MAREs are related in sequence to the phorbol 12-O-tetradecanoate-13-acetate-responsive element (TRE; TGACTCA) and to the cyclic AMP-responsive element (TGACGTCA), to which the AP-1 and CREB/ATF family of bZip transcription factors bind. The DNA binding specificity of the Maf homodimer thus overlaps partly with that of the AP-1 transcription factor (6Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kerppola T.K. Curran T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3149-3158PubMed Google Scholar). AP-1 is composed of homo- and heterodimers of the Jun and Fos family of proto-oncogene products. Maf also can form heterodimers with both Jun and Fos. The Maf/Jun and Maf/Fos heterodimers preferably recognize nonpalindromic DNA sequences composed of each half-site of MARE and TRE. It has been shown that MARE, TRE, and the related cis-DNA elements exhibit their unique and important roles in transcriptional regulation through their interaction with homo- and heterodimers of bZip-bearing transcription factors. For example, the antioxidant-responsive element in the glutathioneS-transferase P gene promoter, which contains TRE and is very similar to the consensus MARE sequence, has been shown to be regulated by both Maf and AP-1 factors (10Sakai M. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Nishizawa M. Nishi S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5370-5376PubMed Google Scholar). Such regulation may participate in the transcription of glutathioneS-transferase P in response to a wide variety of extracellular stimuli. In contrast, the MARE found in the interleukin-4 gene promoter is quite different from TRE and is bound by Maf but not by Jun or Fos (11Ho I.-C. Hodge M.R. Roony J.W. Glimcher L.H. Cell. 1996; 85: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), which confers a lineage-specific expression of interleukin-4 in the Th2 subset of helper T-cells. The bZip domains of v-/c-Maf are indispensable in their DNA binding and transforming abilities. They are also highly conserved throughout evolution among the Maf family members MafA/L-Maf, MafB, and Nrl (3Kataoka K. Nishizawa M. Kawai S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2133-2141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,6Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amino-terminal domain of Maf is also conserved among these family members and is rich in acidic and serine, threonine, and proline residues. The central part of v-/c-Maf contains a cluster of histidine residues and three clusters of glycine residues. The histidine cluster is also found in MafA/L-Maf and MafB, but the glycine clusters are unique to the v-/c-Maf protein. Structure-function analysis has revealed that the deletion of the amino-terminal regions of Maf inhibits its transactivator function and transforming ability (3Kataoka K. Nishizawa M. Kawai S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2133-2141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 53-62PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that these two biological activities may be correlated. This notion, however, is disputed by the artificial mutant Maf protein termed Q5H, which has a glutamine to histidine substitution in the hinge between the basic domain and the leucine zipper. Q5H is significantly better at transformation despite the fact that its transactivation activity is similar to that of the wild type Maf protein (3Kataoka K. Nishizawa M. Kawai S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2133-2141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 53-62PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the precise role of the transactivator function of Maf in cell transformation is unclear to date. The downstream target gene(s) of Maf (if any) that are responsible for cell transformation are also unknown. To elucidate the mechanism by which Maf transforms cells, we constructed a series of chimeric molecules that contained portions of Maf fused with heterologous transactivator, transrepressor, or dimerization domains. These molecules were tested for their transactivation and transforming activities. We also attempted to determine whether the downstream target gene(s) of Maf are the same as those of Jun oncoproteins. To make pEF/Gal4-VP16, theHincII (SalI)-EcoRI fragment containing the SV40 promoter and the rabbit β-globin intron sequence of the pSG-GalVP plasmid was replaced by theHindIII-EcoRI fragment of the human polypeptide chain elongation factor 1α promoter derived from the pEF-BOS plasmid (12Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar). The pSG-GalVP plasmid is a pSG5 (Stratagene)-based eukaryotic expression vector that contains an EcoRI-BamHI fragment that links the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of Gal4 (amino acids 1–147) to the acidic transactivator domain of VP16 (amino acids 413–490) by a HindIII-BglII linker, AAGCTTAGATCT. pEF/Gal4-Maf(CD4) was constructed as follows. First, aHindIII restriction site was introduced at the 5′-end of the open reading frame of c-maf by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers (5′-gagaagcttATGGCATCAGAGCTCGCAA-3′ and 5′-ACCGAGCTGCAGGGCGTGCTCATG-3′). The PCR fragment was digested with HindIII and NcoI (nucleotide 53 of v-maf) and then inserted into theHindIII-NcoI site of pCd4 (3Kataoka K. Nishizawa M. Kawai S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2133-2141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus generating pUC9/c-maf-Cd4, which encodes amino acids 1–254 of chicken c-Maf. The HindIII-BamHI (nucleotide 1036 of v-maf) fragment was then introduced into the pEF/Gal4-VP16 plasmid by replacing itsHindIII-BamHI fragment. pEF/Gal4-DBD was made from pEF/Gal4-Maf(CD4) by deleting theHindIII-NheI fragment by T4 DNA polymerase treatment and self-ligation. The NheI restriction site is derived from a synthetic linker sequence that was inserted into theBstEII site at nucleotide 756 of v-maf. The plasmids that contain maf Pt, which is a nearly full-length version of v-maf (pRAM-GEM), and the amino-terminally deleted maf mutant Nd5(pNd5) have been described (3Kataoka K. Nishizawa M. Kawai S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2133-2141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the Mxi1-Maf fusion construct, human mxi1 cDNA (13Zervos A.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 72: 223-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar) was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR from the total RNA of the TIG1 cell line using specific primers (5′-aatgcaTGCCCATGGAGCGGGTGAAG-3′ and 5′-agtgcaTGCATCATGAACCCAATTTAAG-3′). The product was then digested with SphI and subcloned into theSphI site of the pUC118 vector in theHindIII-EcoRI direction. An MluI linker was inserted into the HindIII site of the polylinker. The BglII site of the mxi1 cDNA and theNcoI site (nucleotide 53 of v-maf) of pRAM-GEM plasmid were then ligated after T4 polymerase treatment. AnMluI fragment coding for a fusion protein consisting of amino acids 1–70 of Mxi1 that contains the Sin3 interaction domain (SID) fused to amino acids 19–369 of v-Maf was excised and inserted into the pGEM-4-MluI vector (14Fujiwara K.T. Kataoka K. Nishizawa M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2371-2380PubMed Google Scholar) to make pGEM-4/MluI/mxi1-maf. For the VP16-ND5 chimera, a DNA fragment containing the VP16 transactivator domain was amplified from the pSG-GalVP plasmid by PCR using specific primers (5′-agagtcgaccatgGCCCCCCCGACCGATGTC-3′ and 5′-agagtcgacgtcatgaaCCCACCGTACTCGTCAA-3′). It was then digested with NcoI and SalI. A SalI restriction site was introduced at the 5′ end of the open reading frame of pNd5 by PCR using a specific primer (5′-agagtcgaccCTGCACTTCGACGACCGCTTCTCC-3′) and the SP6 sequencing primer. The product was then digested with SalI and BstEII (at nucleotide 756). These two DNA fragments were circularized by ligation with the NcoI- andBstEII-digested pRAM-GEM plasmid to make pGEM-4/MluI/VP16-Nd5, which thus encodes a fusion protein of amino acids 413–490 of VP16 and amino acids 241–369 of Maf linked by Phe-Met-Thr-Ser-Thr. For the GCN4 fusion proteins, the entire open reading frame of the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) GCN4 was first subcloned from the pC101-9 plasmid (a gift from S. Harashima (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan) (15Penn M.D. Thireos G. Greer H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 520-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) as follows. The first 11 codons of GCN4 were replaced by a double-stranded oligonucleotide (5′-cATGagCGAATATCAGCCAAGTTTATTTGCTTT-3′ and 5′-AAAGCAAATAAACTTGGCTGATATTCGct-3′) by ligation to the DraI site at the 11th codon. An MluI linker was added to thePvuII site at the 3′-noncoding region. The resulting fragment was inserted into the pRAM-GEM plasmid by replacing itsNcoI-MluI fragment to make pGEM-4/MluI/GCN4. For domain exchange between v-Maf, v-Jun, and GCN4, an XhoI restriction site was generated at the first leucine residue of the zipper structure by site-directed mutagenesis (16Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar) using oligonucleotides (5′-CTCCGACTCgAGGACGTGCCGC-3′ for v-Maf, 5′-CACTTTTTCcTCgAgCCTGGCAATCC-3′ for v-Jun, and 5′-CAACCTTGTCcTCgAGTTGTTTCATT-3′ for GCN4). The plasmid carrying the v-jun coding region has been described previously (6Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The maf-GCN4 chimera (pGEM-4/MluI/maf-GCN4) was generated from the v-maf(+XhoI) andGCN4(+XhoI) constructs. TheND5-GCN4 chimera (pGEM-4/MluI/ND5-GCN4) was constructed from pNd5 and pGEM-4/MluI/maf-GCN4. A plasmid coding for a fusion protein containing the GCN4 zipper region and the amino-terminally deleted version of v-Jun (pGEM-4/MluI/NDjun-GCN4) was constructed from pGEM-4/MluI/GCN4(+XhoI) and pGEM-4/MluI/NDjun(+XhoI). The latter construct was generated from pGEM-4/MluI/v-jun(+XhoI) by PCR using a specific primer (5′-gagccATGGGCTACGCGCCGCAG-3′) and the SP6 sequencing primer followed by NcoI and EcoRI digestion and subcloning into the NcoI-EcoRI site of pRAM-GEM. Constructions of point mutants of the v-maf gene were previously described (3Kataoka K. Nishizawa M. Kawai S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2133-2141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The deletion and fusion constructs described above were linearized by digestion with the appropriate restriction enzyme and then transcribed and translatedin vitro using the TNT Coupled Wheat Germ Extract System (Promega). The resulting extracts were subjected to gel mobility shift analysis as described previously (6Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A double-stranded competitor oligonucleotide spanning the αCE2 element of chicken α-crystallin promoter (17Matsuo I. Yasuda K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3701-3712Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was made from 5′-GATCCAGGTCAGTCTCCGCATTTCTGCTGACCACGTTGCCTA-3′ and 3′-GTCCAGTCAGAGGCGTAAAGACGACTGGTGCAACGGATCTAG-5′. The other oligonucleotides used as probes or competitors have been described previously (6Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell.

For eukaryotic expression, eachMluI fragment containing one of the deletion or fusion constructs described above was inserted into the uniqueBssHII site of the pEF-BssHII expression vector (19Kataoka K. Fujiwara K.T. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7581-7591Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), which is a derivative of pEF-BOS. The pG4x5/TATA/luc plasmid that contains five copies of the Gal4-binding sequence was a gift from K. Igarashi (Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan) (20Nagai T. Igarashi K. Akasaka J. Furuyama K.

The construct 3xMARE/RBGP-luc that contains three copies of MARE (oligonucleotide 7) and the rabbit β-globin minimal promoter has been described (8Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 53-62PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kataoka K. Fujiwara K.T. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7581-7591Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Three copies of a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing an E-box (5′-GATCCCCCCACCACGTGGTGCCTGA-3′ and 5′-GATCTCAGGCACCACGTGGTGGGGG-3′) were introduced into the 5′-end of the MARE-containing oligonucleotides of 3xMARE/RBGP-luc to make 3xE-box/3xMARE/RBGP-luc. pEF-Rluc, used to normalize transfection efficiencies, has been described previously (18Kataoka K. Yoshitomo-Nakagawa K. Shioda S. Nishizawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 819-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). CEF cells (1.2 × 106) grown on 60-mm dishes were transfected with 2.5 μg of plasmid DNA (0.2 μg of reporter plasmid, 2.0 μg of expression plasmid, and 0.3 μg of pEF-Rluc plasmid) using 6.25 μl of Superfect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) as recommended by the manufacturer. The cells were harvested 18 h post-transfection, and luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). To monitor expression of Gal4 fusions and mutant Maf proteins, aliquots of total extracts of the transfected CEF cells were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Gal4 monoclonal antibody (sc-510; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-v-Maf serum (3Kataoka K. Nishizawa M. Kawai S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2133-2141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or anti-c-Maf serum (sc-7886; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For the focus formation assay,MluI fragments containing chimeric Maf constructs were introduced into the unique MluI site of the replication-competent avian retroviral vector pRV-2 (3Kataoka K. Nishizawa M. Kawai S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2133-2141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or its modified version, pRV-9 (18Kataoka K. Yoshitomo-Nakagawa K. Shioda S. Nishizawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 819-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The NotI cassette plasmid pUC/NotI/IRES that contains an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) was described previously (18Kataoka K. Yoshitomo-Nakagawa K. Shioda S. Nishizawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 819-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). pGEM-4/MluI/ND5-GCN4 and pGEM-4/MluI/NDjun-GCN4 were digested withEcoRI at the 3′ polylinker site, treated with T4 DNA polymerase, digested with NcoI, and inserted into theNcoI-SmaI site of the cassette plasmid. TheNotI fragments containing IRES-ND5-GCN4 and IRES-NDjun-GCN4 were then introduced into another uniqueNotI site of pRV-9. Subsequently, MluI fragments containing c-maf, v-jun, or v-myc were introduced into the MluI site of the plasmids. The entire open reading frame of the v-myc gene of MC29 avian myelocytomatosis virus (21Reddy E.P. Reynolds R.K. Watson D.K. Schultz R.A. Lautenberger J. Papas T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Preparation and maintenance of CEF cells, DNA transfection, and the focus formation assay of recombinant viruses were performed as described previously (18Kataoka K. Yoshitomo-Nakagawa K. Shioda S.

The amino-terminal two-thirds of v-/c-Maf contain the acidic and serine/threonine/proline-rich region and clusters of histidine or glycine residues (Fig.1A). We previously reported that deleting all of these parts of Maf resulted in a great reduction of its transactivating activity, although its ability to bind to MARE was unimpaired (6Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 53-62PubMed Google Scholar). To define the transactivation potential of the amino-terminal region of Maf, we generated a plasmid that encoded a fusion protein consisting of the first 254 amino acids of c-Maf linked to the DBD of the Gal4 yeast transcription factor (Fig. 1A). As a control, a fusion construct consisting of the DBD of Gal4 linked to the strong transactivator domain of the VP16 protein from Herpes simplex virus-1 (Gal4-VP16) was also generated. In addition, the construct containing only the DBD of Gal4 was made. The eukaryotic expression plasmids for all three constructs were individually co-transfected with the Gal4 reporter plasmid into CEF cells, and luciferase activities were measured. As shown in Fig. 1B, the presence of the transactivator domain of VP16 caused a 20-fold enhancement of luciferase activity relative to that induced when only the Gal4-DBD was present. Similarly, the presence of the amino-terminal sequences of Maf also significantly induced transcription (6-fold). Western blot analysis of the extracts of the transfected cells using anti-Gal4 antibody showed significant accumulation of the fusion proteins (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that this region of Maf is an intrinsic transactivator domain, although weaker than VP16. We next tested the relationship between the abilities of Maf to activate transcription and to transform CEF cells. For this purpose, we designed a series of mutant Maf constructs that are shown schematically in Fig.2A. Maf(PT) is a nearly full-length version of Maf whose transforming ability is comparable with that of full-length Maf (3Kataoka K. Nishizawa M. Kawai S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2133-2141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ND5 lacks two-thirds of the amino-terminal portion and has been shown to be unable to transform CEF cells (3Kataoka K. Nishizawa M. Kawai S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2133-2141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test if the transactivator domain of Maf can be exchanged with heterologous transactivator domains, the VP16 activator domain was fused to the bZip domain contained in ND5 to create VP16-ND5. Another chimeric construct, Mxi1-Maf, fuses the SID of the Mxi1 transcriptional repressor protein to the PT form of Maf. SID has been shown to interact with Sin3 proteins to recruit the histone deacetylase complex and to repress transcription mediated by several types of transactivation domains (22Schreiber-Agus N.

Armstrong A.P. Eisenman R.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5772-5781Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). These four constructs were each transcribed and translated in vitro and tested for binding to the MARE sequence by gel mobility shift analysis. As shown in Fig.2B, all proteins bound efficiently to the MARE-containing oligonucleotide probe. The translation products of the Mxi1-Maf construct also resulted in a DNA-protein complex of lower mobility. The identity of this complex is unknown at present, but it could be the Mxi1-Maf fusion protein bound to the endogenous histone deacetylase complex present in the translation system we used. We next tested the ability of these four constructs to regulate transcription. Each construct was introduced into a eukaryotic expression vector and co-transfected into CEF cells together with the luciferase reporter plasmid that drives transcription under the control of the rabbit β-globin promoter (RBGP) TATA-box and three tandem MARE repeats (3xMARE/RBGP-luc). Luciferase activities were then measured. We found that all Maf constructs were efficiently translated in the transfected cells as revealed by Western blot analysis using anti-v-Maf serum (Fig. 3). We also found that they all accumulated in the nucleus of the transfected cells as observed by immunofluorescent staining using anti-v-Maf serum (data not shown). The luciferase data are summarized in TableI. Luciferase activity in cells co-transfected with 3xMARE/RBGP-luc and the empty expression vector was set at 1. The luciferase activity was increased by about 20-fold by the co-expression of Maf(PT) protein, while deletion of the amino-terminal two-thirds of Maf (ND5) resulted in complete loss of transactivation as previously observed using NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cells (8Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 53-62PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, the VP16-ND5 chimera activated transcription more efficiently (160-fold) than Maf(PT), which is consistent with the transactivation potentials of Gal4-Maf(CD4) and Gal4-VP16 seen previously (Fig. 1B). On the other hand, Mxi1-Maf was transcriptionally inert, indicating that the presence of Mxi1-SID successfully blocks the function of the Maf transactivation domain. However, it was not clear whether Mxi1-Maf acts as a transcriptional repressor, because the basal activity of the 3xMARE/RBGP-luc reporter plasmid is relatively low in CEF cells. Thus, in order to test the repressor function of Mxi1-Maf, we used another reporter plasmid, namely 3xE-box/3xMARE/RBGP-luc. This reporter plasmid contains three copies of the E-box sequence and has a 7-fold higher basal activity when transfected into CEF cells compared with 3xMARE/RBGP-luc (TableI). Consistent with the patterns seen previously with the 3xMARE/RBGP-luc reporter, the luciferase activity of 3xE-box/3xMARE/RBGP-luc was enhanced by co-transfection with either Maf(PT) (5-fold) or VP16-ND5 (56-fold). In addition, however, co-transfection of Mxi1-Maf resulted in a significant reduction of luciferase activity, indicating that it does act as transcriptional repressor.Table ITransactivation and transforming activity of various Maf chimeras on CEF cellsTransactivationFocus formation3xMARE/RBGP-luc3xE-box 3xMARE/RBGP-lucVector17.1 (1)−Maf(PT)20.937.6 (× 5.3)+ND51.7ND−VP16-ND5159.0400.4 (× 56.4)++Mxil-Maf0.61.0 (× 0.16)−The luciferase activity induced by each Maf chimera is expressed relative to the luciferase activity when cells are co-transfected with 3xMARE/RBGP-luc plasmid and empty expression vector (pEF-BssHII).

We then tested the abilities of these Maf constructs to transform CEF cells by introducing them into a replication competent avian retroviral vector that was then transfected into CEF cells. The recombinant viruses were then assayed for their focus-forming activities. As previously demonstrated, the recombinant virus carrying Maf(PT) could induce foci on CEF cells, while the ND5 deletion mutant could not (Fig.4 and Table I) (3Kataoka K. Nishizawa M. Kawai S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2133-2141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The VP16-ND5 containing virus, however, induced foci more efficiently and rapidly (5–20 × 103 focus forming units/ml, 10–14 days after infection) than the Maf(PT) virus (2–3 × 103focus forming units/ml, 13–18 days after infection). Thus, the amino-terminal domain of Maf can be replaced by the heterologous transactivator domain of VP16, and the magnitude of the transforming ability seems to correlate with the transactivation potential. In contrast, the Mxi1-Maf-containing virus could not induce foci despite the fact that it contained the full Maf sequence. The most likely explanation for this observation is that the presence of"

By using the BLNK-deficient DT40 chicken B cell system, we demonstrated MIST functions through distinct intramolecular domains in immunoreceptor signaling depending on the availability of linker for activation of T cells (LAT). MIST can partially restore the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling in the BLNK-deficient cells, which requires phosphorylation of the two N-terminal tyrosine residues. Co-expression of LAT with MIST fully restored the BCR signaling and dispenses with the requirement of the two tyrosines in MIST for BCR signaling. However, some other tyrosine(s), as well as the Src homology (SH) 2 domain and the two proline-rich regions in MIST, is still required for full reconstitution of the BCR signaling, in cooperation with LAT. The C-terminal proline-rich region of MIST is dispensable for the LAT-aided full restoration of MAP kinase activation, although it is responsible for the interaction with LAT and for the localization in glycolipid-enriched microdomains. On the other hand, the N-terminal proline-rich region, which is a binding site of the SH3 domain of phospholipase Cγ, is essential for BCR signaling.

Among these adaptor/linker proteins are SLP-76 and its close relative BLNK (also known as BASH or SLP-65), which are pivotal for T and B cell development and for T cell antigen receptor (TCR)1 and B cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling, respectively.

In a SLP-76-deficient Jurkat T cell line, elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and the activation of the Ras pathway following TCR cross-linking are severely impaired (10Yablonski D. Kuhne M.R. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Science. 1998; 281: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Moreover, a profound block in thymocyte development in SLP-76-deficient mice indicates an essential role for SLP-76 in pre-TCR signaling (11Clements J.L. Yang B. Ross-Barta S.E. Eliason S.L.

Similarly, a BLNK-deficient DT40 cell line, a chicken B lymphoma, displayed severe defects in tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ, [Ca2+]i increase, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAP kinase activation following BCR stimulation (13Ishiai M.

Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 2 activation was also moderately affected by the absence of PLCγ activation in BLNK-deficient DT40 cells. In addition, we and others have reported abnormal B cell differentiation and functions in BLNK-deficient mice (14Hayashi K. Nittono R. Okamoto N. Tsuji S. Hara Y. Goitsuka R. Kitamura D. Proc. Natl.

The third member of SLP-76/BLNK adaptor family was recently isolated and called either MIST (for mast cell immunoreceptor signal transducer) (18Goitsuka R. Kanazashi H. Sasanuma H. Fujimura Y. Hidaka Y. Tatsuno A. Ra C. Hayashi K. Kitamura D. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) or Clnk (for cytokine-dependent hemopoietic cell linker) (19Cao M.Y. Davidson D., Yu, J. Latour S. Veillette A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1527-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). MIST/Clnk is constitutively expressed in several mast cell lines, and its expression was induced by cytokines in T cells and a variety of cytokine-dependent cell lines of myeloid and lymphoid origins (18Goitsuka R. Kanazashi H. Sasanuma H. Fujimura Y. Hidaka Y. Tatsuno A. Ra C. Hayashi K. Kitamura D. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 19Cao M.Y. Davidson D., Yu, J. Latour S. Veillette A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1527-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). MIST shares structural features with SLP-76 and BLNK and is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon either the high affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI) or TCR stimulation. MIST can associate with PLCγ, Vav, Grb2, and LAT either constitutively or inducibly. Overexpression of a phosphorylation-deficient form of MIST in the rat mast cell line RBL-2H3 inhibited FcεRI-mediated mast cell degranulation, [Ca2+]i increase, and phosphorylation of LAT (18Goitsuka R. Kanazashi H. Sasanuma H. Fujimura Y. Hidaka Y. Tatsuno A. Ra C. Hayashi K. Kitamura D. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the transient expression of Clnk in Jurkat T cells augmented TCR-induced NF-AT activation (19Cao M.Y. Davidson D., Yu, J. Latour S. Veillette A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1527-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that, similarly to SLP-76 and BLNK, MIST/Clnk functions as a signaling molecule downstream of the FcεRI in mast cells and the TCR in T cells. To clarify domains/motifs required for MIST function in immunoreceptor signal transduction, we utilized BLNK-deficient DT40 cells as a signal reconstitution system. This B cell line expresses none of the SLP-76 family members and thus can be the simplest system currently available to test the function of various mutant forms of MIST. By this reconstitution system, we studied a structure-function relationship of MIST in linking immunoreceptor signal to the downstream biochemical events.

COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) protein fused to the C-terminal SH2 domain or the SH3 domain of PLCγ1 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The monoclonal Ab against chicken IgM (M4) was provided from Dr. C-L. H. Chen (University of Alabama at Birmingham). The rabbit Abs against chicken PLCγ2 and mouse MIST were described previously (18Goitsuka R. Kanazashi H. Sasanuma H. Fujimura Y. Hidaka Y. Tatsuno A. Ra C. Hayashi K. Kitamura D. Int.

The following antibodies were purchased: anti-ERK2 and anti-Grb2 Abs from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, anti-phosphotyrosine PY20 Ab conjugated with horseradish peroxidase from Transduction Laboratories, anti-LAT Ab from Upstate Biotechnology, anti-JNK Ab from PharMingen, and anti-T7 Ab from Novagen. The mutant mouse MIST containing tyrosine to phenylalanine substitutions (YF) or arginine to lysine substitution at the SH2 domain (R335K) were generated using a QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The MIST mutants lacking PR regions (160PLPPPR165 or/and178PPAPP182) were also generated by PCR-mediated mutagenesis as described previously (23Imai Y. Matsushima Y. Sugimura T. Terda M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Their sequences were verified by automated sequence analysis. Wild-type and the mutant MIST cDNAs were subcloned into pApuro2 and pCAT7neo expression vectors (5Goitsuka R. Fujimura Y. Mamada H. Umeda A. Morimura T. Uetsuka K. Doi K. Tsuji S. Kitamura D. J.

Human LAT cDNA was also inserted in pAzeo expression vector (24Ishiai M. Kurosaki M. Inabe K. Chan A.C. Sugamura K. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Human Grb2 expression vector was provided by Dr. M. Tanaka (Hamamatsu Medical College). COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmid vectors by using a TransIT-LT1 reagent (Pan Vera) as described previously (5Goitsuka R. Fujimura Y. Mamada H. Umeda A. Morimura T. Uetsuka K. Doi K. Tsuji S. Kitamura D. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5804-5808PubMed Google Scholar). The MIST or LAT expression vectors were transfected into wild-type and mutant DT40 cell lines by electroporation, and selected in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) for pApuro-based constructs or 0.4 mg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen) for pAzeo-LAT. The BLNK-deficient DT40 cell clone stably expressing human LAT (2H12) was further transfected with expression vectors containing various forms of MIST. Cell surface expression of BCR on each transfectants was analyzed by FACSsort (Becton Dickinson) using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-chicken IgM Ab (Bethyl Laboratories), and transfectants expressing similar levels of MIST/LAT proteins as well as surface IgM were used for the analysis. Cells were lysed with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors, and precipitated with indicated Abs or GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The precipitates and aliquots of total cell lysates were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were immunoblotted with Abs described above, and the secondary Ab was conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and then developed with the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). DT40 cell clones (5 × 106 cells) were loaded with 5 μm Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes) at 37 °C for 30 min, washed twice with RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and adjusted to 106 cells/ml. Cells were then stimulated with 10 μg/ml of anti-IgM Ab at 37 °C. [Ca2+]i was monitored at a 510 nm emission wavelength excited by 340 nm and 360 nm using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-2000, Hitachi). The assay conditions were described previously (25Hashimoto A. Okada H. Jiang A. Kurosaki M. Greenberg S. Clark E.A. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1287-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In brief, lysates from 5 × 106 cells were immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of anti-ERK2 Ab or anti-JNK Ab and protein-G Sepharose. Half of the immunoprecipitates was suspended in 30 μl of kinase assay buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP, 5 μm cold ATP, and 5 μg of GST-Elk or GST-Jun fusion proteins as a substrate. After 20 min of incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer, followed by boiling for 5 min. The samples were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels, and then the gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. The other half of the immunoprecipitates were used for Western blot analysis to quantify immunoprecipitated proteins. BLNK-deficient DT40 cells were transfected with 10 μg of a luciferase reporter plasmid driven by NF-AT and AP-1 response element from the mouse interleukin 2 gene promoter (a gift from Dr. K. Arai, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo), together with 15 μg of either empty vector or an expression vector harboring various forms of MIST, BLNK, or LAT, in serum-free RPMI at a density of 107 cells/400 μl with a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad Laboratories) set at 250 V and 975 μF. After electroporation, the cells were transferred to complete RPMI and incubated at 40 °C for 24 h. Triplicates of 5 × 105 viable cells were then left unstimulated or stimulated with anti-IgM Ab for 6 h and subsequently assayed for luciferase activity, as described previously (5Goitsuka R. Fujimura Y. Mamada H. Umeda A. Morimura T. Uetsuka K. Doi K. Tsuji S. Kitamura D. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5804-5808PubMed Google Scholar). Light emission was measured in a Lumat LB9501 luminometer (Berthold). GEM fractions were prepared as described previously (24Ishiai M. Kurosaki M. Inabe K. Chan A.C. Sugamura K. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In brief, cells (2.5 × 108) were either unstimulated or stimulated with anti-IgM Ab for 2 min and then lysed in 1 ml of 0.5% Triton X lysis buffer. Cell lysates were mixed with 1 ml of 80% sucrose in lysis buffer, overlaid with 6.5 ml of 30% sucrose and 2.5 ml of 5% sucrose in lysis buffer, and then subjected to ultracentrifugation at 35,000 rpm for 16 h at 4 °C. Eleven aliquots (1 ml each) were collected from the top of the gradient fraction and subjected to Western blot analysis. Mouse MIST contains eight tyrosine residues potentially phosphorylated by PTKs, two PR regions, and a C-terminal SH2 domain (Fig.1 A). Of these tyrosine residues, five are conserved with those in human homologue (18Goitsuka R. Kanazashi H. Sasanuma H. Fujimura Y. Hidaka Y. Tatsuno A. Ra C. Hayashi K. Kitamura D. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and two of them are located in the sequence context (DY69EDP and EY96ADT) similar to those in mouse SLP-76 (DY113ESP, DY128ESP, and DY145EPP) and BLNK (DY72ENP and EY119VDN). These tyrosine residues in SLP-76 are essential for TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of whole molecule and for its function in TCR-induced NF-AT transcriptional activation (26Fang N. Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Koretzky G.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3769-3773PubMed Google Scholar). We first determined PTKs responsible for MIST phosphorylation in the context of BCR signaling by introducing MIST into wild-type and PTK-deficient DT40 cell lines. A low level of tyrosine phosphorylation of MIST was detected before stimulation, and it was markedly increased within 1 min after BCR stimulation in wild-type DT40 cells (Fig. 1 B). By contrast, the level of BCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of MIST was profoundly decreased in Lyn-deficient DT40 cells, modestly decreased in Syk-deficient DT40 cells, and not decreased at all in Btk-deficient DT40 cells (Fig. 1 A). This result indicates that both Lyn and Syk, but not Btk, mainly mediate tyrosine phosphorylation of MIST in the context of BCR signaling. In order to determine whether the two conserved tyrosine residues of MIST are the targets for BCR-associated PTKs, we generated mutant forms of MIST that contain either single (Y69F or Y96F) or double (YF2) tyrosine to phenylalanine substitutions at positions 69 and 96 and examined their tyrosine phosphorylation in wild-type DT40 cells. As shown in Fig. 1 C, Y69F and Y96F were poorly tyrosine-phosphorylated upon BCR stimulation, whereas YF2 was not, indicating that tyrosines 69 and 96 of MIST are the main targets of BCR-associated PTKs and required for the phosphorylation of MIST in the BCR-signaling context. To clarify the role of MIST as a component of the immunoreceptor signaling complex and to verify the significance of the tyrosine phosphorylation of MIST, we introduced wild-type and mutant forms of MIST into BLNK-deficient DT40 cells (13Ishiai M. Kurosaki M. Pappu R. Okawa K. Ronko I. Fu C. Shibata M. Iwamatsu A. Chan A.C. Kurosaki T. Immunity. 1999; 10: 117-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). All transfectants expressed comparative levels of MIST protein (Fig.2 A) and surface IgM (data not shown). The level of BCR-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Y69F was markedly lower, whereas that of Y96F was slightly lower, compared with that of wild-type MIST (Fig. 2 A). Tyrosine phosphorylation of YF2 was undetectable. As reported previously, no [Ca2+]i increase was induced by BCR stimulation in parental BLNK-deficient cells. Remarkably, the introduction of wild-type MIST into BLNK-deficient DT40 cells partially restored the calcium response, whereas the response was not restored in BLNK-deficient cells expressing Y69F, Y96F, or YF2 (Fig.2 B). This result indicates that both Tyr-69 and Tyr-96 of MIST are required for the BCR-induced calcium response. Because PLCγ2 is required for BCR-induced [Ca2+]i increase in DT40 cells (22Takata M. Homma Y. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and the activation of PLCγ2 is accompanied with its tyrosine phosphorylation (27Nishibe S. Wahl M.I. Hernandez-Sotomayor S.M. Tonks N.K. Rhee S.G. Carpenter G. Science. 1990; 250: 1253-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), we next examined tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2 upon BCR stimulation in BLNK-deficient DT40 cells expressing various forms of MIST. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2 was restored in BLNK-deficient cells expressing wild-type MIST but not in transfectants expressing Y69F, Y96F, and YF2 mutants (Fig. 2 C). BLNK has been reported to interact with PLCγ2 and thus recruit PLCγ2 to the membrane proximal compartment, where PLCγ2 is phosphorylated by Syk (13Ishiai M. Kurosaki M. Pappu R. Okawa K. Ronko I. Fu C. Shibata M. Iwamatsu A. Chan A.C. Kurosaki T. Immunity. 1999; 10: 117-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). To test whether MIST can play such a role, we assessed the interaction of MIST with PLCγ by an in vitro binding assay using a GST fusion protein containing the C-terminal SH2 domain of PLCγ1 (GST-PLCγ-SH2). COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type or tyrosine mutants of MIST, in combination with Lyn, and cell lysates were precipitated with GST-PLCγ-SH2 fusion protein. As shown in Fig. 2 D, GST-PLCγ-SH2 interacted with Lyn-phosphorylated wild-type MIST but not with unphosphorylated MIST. Of five single tyrosine mutants that were equivalently phosphorylated by Lyn, only Y96F mutant did not interact with GST-PLCγ-SH2. A MIST mutant (YF6) containing six tyrosine to phenylalanine substitutions at positions 69, 96, 101, 153, 174, and 188, which showed no detectable tyrosine phosphorylation by Lyn, also failed to associate with GST-PLCγ-SH2. These results indicate that MIST interacts with the SH2 domain of PLCγ via its phosphorylated tyrosine 96, which may lead to the recruitment of PLCγ to the site of PTKs for its activation and the subsequent [Ca2+]i increase. It remains to be examined, however, how tyrosine 69 is involved in the PLCγ activation. As Y69F mutation more severely affected BCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of MIST than Y96F, phosphotyrosine 69 may serve as a binding site for a PTK, which subsequently phosphorylates tyrosine 96. Alternatively, the PTK bound to the phosphotyrosine 69 may be responsible for the phosphorylation of PLCγ2. BCR-induced activation of ERK2 has been shown to require both PLCγ2 and Ras pathways in DT40 cells (25Hashimoto A. Okada H. Jiang A. Kurosaki M. Greenberg S. Clark E.A. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1287-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and reduced ERK2 activity in BLNK-deficient DT40 cells has principally been ascribed to a defect of the PLCγ2-mediated pathway (13Ishiai M. Kurosaki M. Pappu R. Okawa K. Ronko I. Fu C. Shibata M. Iwamatsu A. Chan A.C. Kurosaki T. Immunity. 1999; 10: 117-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). ERK activity after the BCR cross-linking was partially restored in BLNK-deficient DT40 cells expressing wild-type MIST. However Y69F, Y96F, and YF2 mutants failed to restore BCR-induced ERK2 activation in BLNK-deficient cells (Fig.2 E). These results indicate that MIST can restore the PLCγ2-mediated pathway of BCR signaling in BLNK-deficient cells by molecular interactions through tyrosines 69 and 96. It is of note that the restoration of the PLCγ2 pathway by MIST is partial in any biochemical events examined here. A possible explanation for the incomplete reconstitution of BCR signaling by MIST in the BLNK-deficient DT40 cells is that the B cells lack some signaling molecules required for full activity of MIST. One molecule that is known to be expressed in T cells and mast cells in which MIST is also expressed, but not in B cells, is LAT (28Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). LAT is a membrane-anchored adaptor protein that localizes to specific plasma membrane compartments known as GEMs (29Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar) and has been demonstrated to be required for SLP-76-mediated NF-AT activation upon TCR stimulation (30Finco T.S. Kadlecek T. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Weiss A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 617-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 31Zhang W. Irvin B.J. Trible R.P. Abraham R.T. Samelson L.E. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Because LAT is one of the signaling proteins associated with MIST in FcεRI-signaling (18Goitsuka R. Kanazashi H. Sasanuma H. Fujimura Y. Hidaka Y. Tatsuno A. Ra C. Hayashi K. Kitamura D. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), LAT seems to be required for MIST to fully exhibit its function in BCR signaling. To assess this possibility, we transiently expressed various forms of MIST in combination with LAT in BLNK-deficient cells and examined BCR-mediated NF-AT activation by luciferase-reporter assay. As shown in Fig. 3, transfection of wild-type MIST or LAT alone showed weak restoration of the BCR-induced NF-AT activation as compared with chicken BLNK. Combined expression of wild-type MIST and LAT resulted in a marked synergy in reconstituting BCR-induced NF-AT activation in BLNK-deficient cells. Surprisingly, Y69F, Y96F, and YF2 mutants, which were not functional without LAT (data not shown), restored BCR-mediated NF-AT activation when co-expressed with LAT, to a similar level that was achieved by wild-type MIST with LAT (Fig. 3). Similarly, MIST co-expressed with LAT fully reconstituted BCR-mediated calcium response in BLNK-deficient cells, independently of the two tyrosines 69 and 96 (see below). These findings indicate that LAT cooperatively functions with MIST and dispenses with the requirement of two tyrosines 69 and 96 of MIST to restore BCR-mediated [Ca2+]i increase and the following NF-AT activation in BLNK-deficient cells. To dissect the mechanism for the LAT-MIST cooperation in the immunoreceptor signaling, we generated BLNK-deficient DT40 cells stably expressing LAT together with various forms of MIST, including mutants with a deletion of PR regions (dPR1, dPR2, and dPR1/2), a mutant containing the nonfunctional SH2 domain (R335K), and the tyrosine mutants (YF2 and YF6) (Fig.4 A). Introduction of LAT alone into BLNK-deficient DT40 cells partially restored the calcium response to a level similar to that observed in transfectants expressing wild-type MIST alone (Figs. 2 B and4 B). Consistent with the restoration of BCR-induced NF-AT activation, BCR-induced [Ca2+]i increase in cells expressing both LAT and wild-type MIST was restored to an equivalent level to that observed in wild-type DT40 cells (Figs. 2 B and4 B). In the presence of LAT, YF2 restored the BCR-induced calcium response to a level comparable to that achieved by wild-type MIST. By contrast, YF6 and the SH2 domain mutant, as well as mutants lacking either of the two PR regions, rather weakly restored calcium response. The mutant lacking both PR regions failed to restore the response. We next assessed BCR-induced activation of MAP kinases, ERK2 and JNK, in the BLNK-deficient DT40 cells reconstituted with LAT and the mutant forms of MIST using in vitro kinase assay. Wild-type DT40 cells exhibited sustained ERK2 activation until 10 min, with a peak response at 3 min following BCR stimulation, whereas in BLNK-deficient cells expressing either wild-type MIST or LAT alone, ERK2 activation was transient and decreased at 10 min (Figs.2 E and 4 C). Co-expression of wild-type MIST and LAT restored both peak and sustained responses of BCR-induced ERK2 activation. The SH2 mutant, YF6, or dPR2 co-expressed with LAT showed the reconstitution activity comparable to the wild-type MIST. By contrast, dPR1 lacking the N-terminal PR region of MIST failed to augment ERK activation above the level that was achieved by LAT alone, suggesting that the N-terminal PR region of MIST is responsible for cooperation with LAT in BCR-induced ERK2 activation. As with the calcium response, the cells expressing dPR1/2 and LAT showed even weaker ERK2 response than the cells expressing LAT alone. The reason for this is currently unclear, but it is possible that the dPR1/2 lacking two PR regions behaves as dominant-negative mutant in BCR signaling through LAT. Maximal JNK activation was observed 10 min after BCR stimulation in wild-type DT40 cells, whereas no BCR-induced JNK activation was detected in the absence of BLNK, as previously reported (13Ishiai M. Kurosaki M. Pa"

Here we show that the guanylyltransferase activity of Ceg1 is highly thermolabile in vitro (98% loss of activity after treatment for 10 min at 35 °C) and that binding to recombinant Cet1 protein, or a synthetic peptide Cet1(232–265), protects Ceg1 from heat inactivation at physiological temperatures. Candida albicansguanylyltransferase Cgt1 is also thermolabile and is stabilized by binding to Cet1(232–265). In contrast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and mammalian guanylyltransferases are intrinsically thermostable in vitro and they are unaffected by Cet1(232–265). We show that the requirement for the Ceg1-binding domain of Cet1 for yeast cell growth can be circumvented by overexpression in high gene dosage of a catalytically active mutant lacking the Ceg1-binding site (Cet1(269–549)) provided that Ceg1 is also overexpressed. However, such cells are unable to grow at 37 °C. In contrast, cells overexpressing Cet1(269–549) in single copy grow at all temperatures if they express either the S. pombe or mammalian guanylyltransferase in lieu of Ceg1. Thus, the cell growth phenotype correlates with the inherent thermal stability of the guanylyltransferase. We propose that an essential function of the Cet1-Ceg1 interaction is to stabilize Ceg1 guanylyltransferase activity rather than to allosterically regulate its activity. We used protein-affinity chromatography to identify the COOH-terminal segment of Ceg1 (from amino acids 245–459) as an autonomous Cet1-binding domain. Genetic experiments implicate two peptide segments,287KPVSLYVW295 and337WQNLKNLEQPLN348, as likely constituents of the Cet1-binding site on Ceg1.

The genetic and physical organization of these two capping enzymes differs in higherversus lower eukaryotes (1Shuman S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 66: 1-40Crossref Google Scholar). Mammals encode a bifunctional capping enzyme (Mce1; 597 aa)1 consisting of an NH2-terminal triphosphatase domain Mce1(1–210) fused to a COOH-terminal guanylyltransferase domain Mce1(211–597). The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiaeencodes separate triphosphatase (Cet1; 549 aa) and guanylyltransferase (Ceg1; 459 aa) proteins that interact in trans to form a heteromeric capping enzyme complex. The binding of yeast Cet1 to Ceg1 elicits two apparently beneficial outcomes. First, Cet1-Ceg1 interaction stimulates the guanylyltransferase activity of Ceg1 by increasing the extent of formation of the covalent Ceg1-GMP reaction intermediate (2Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5189-5198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Ho C.K. Lehman K. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4671-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Second, the physical tethering of Cet1 to Ceg1 may facilitate recruitment of the capping apparatus to the RNA polymerase II elongation complex. Ceg1 binds in vitro and in vivo to the phosphorylated carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (4McCracken S. Fong N. Rosonina E. Yankulov K. Brothers G.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar), whereas Cet1 by itself does not interact in vitro with the phosphorylated CTD (8Cho E.J. Rodriguez C.R. Takagi T. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3482-3487Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that Cet1 binding to Ceg1 antagonizes negative effects of CTD-PO4 binding on the guanylyltransferase activity of Ceg1 (8Cho E.J. Rodriguez C.R. Takagi T. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3482-3487Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cet1 consists of three domains: (i) a 230-aa NH2-terminal segment that is dispensable for catalysis in vitro and for Cet1 function in vivo, (ii) a protease-sensitive segment from residues 230 to 275 that is dispensable for catalysis, but essential for Cet1 function in vivo, and (iii) a catalytic domain from residues 276 to 539 (9Lehman K. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Rouzankina I. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22668-22678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain by itself is a monomeric protein and does not support yeast cell growth, whereas the biologically active triphosphatase has a homodimeric quaternary structure (9Lehman K.

Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Mutational disruption of the Cet1 homodimer interface is uniquely deleterious in vivo when the yeast RNA triphosphatase functions in concert with the endogenous yeast guanylyltransferase Ceg1. Lethal or severe temperature-sensitive (ts) growth phenotypes elicited by mutations of the Cet1 homodimer interface are suppressed by fusion of the mutated triphosphatase to the guanylyltransferase domain of mammalian capping enzyme (11Lehman K. Ho C.K. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14996-15002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Genetic evidence indicates that the Cet1-Ceg1 interaction is important. ceg1-ts mutations are suppressed in an allele-specific manner by overexpression of CET1 (2Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. Mol.

(i) What is the basis for stimulation of Ceg1 guanylyltransferase activity by Cet1? Specifically, is the stimulation attributable to allosteric interactions or to other factors, such as protein stabilization? (ii) Is the stimulation of Ceg1 by Cet1 important in vivo?

The enzyme preparations were dialyzed against buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.03% Triton X-100 and then stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by using the Bio-Rad dye reagent with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Guanylyltransferase activity was assayed by the formation of the covalent enzyme-GMP intermediate. Reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.17 μm[α-32P]GTP, and enzyme as specified were incubated for 10 min at 22 °C. The reaction was halted by adding SDS to 1% final concentration. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The guanylyltransferase-32P[GMP] complex was resolved and visualized by autoradiography of the dried gel and quantitated by scanning the gel with a FUJIX BAS2500 PhosphorImager. Reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MnCl2, 1 mm[γ-32P]ATP, and enzyme were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. The reactions were quenched by adding 2 μl of 5m formic acid. Aliquots (2 μl) of the mixtures were applied to a polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plate, which was developed with 1 m formic acid, 0.5 m LiCl. The extent of32Pi release was quantitated by scanning the chromatogram with a PhosphorImager. Purified guanylyltransferase (2 μm of Ceg1, Cgt1, Pce1, or Mce1(211–597)) was incubated for 15 min on ice either alone or with 12 μm purified Cet(201–549), with 20 μm Cet(232–265) peptide, or the mutant peptide Cet1(232–265)4xAla in 50 μl of binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.03% Triton X-100). Aliquots (5 μl) of the guanylyltransferase alone or guanylyltransferase plus Cet1(201–549) or Cet1(232–265) mixtures were preincubated for 10 min at 22, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50 °C and then quenched on ice. Control aliquots were kept on ice throughout the pretreatment. An aliquot (2 μl) of each sample was then assayed at 22 °C for enzyme-GMP complex formation. The signal intensities of the enzyme-32P[GMP] complexes formed by the preheated enzyme mixtures were normalized to that of the unheated control (defined as 100%). The normalized activities were plotted as a function of preincubation temperature (Fig. 1, A-E). Purified Cet1(201–549) (2.2 μm) was incubated for 15 min on ice either alone or with 12 μm purified Ceg1. Aliquots (5 μl) of the mixtures were preincubated for 10 min at 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, or 55 °C and then quenched on ice. Control aliquots were kept on ice throughout the pretreatment. An aliquot (2 μl) of each sample was then assayed at 30 °C for manganese-dependent ATP hydrolysis. The extent of ATP hydrolysis by preheated enzyme was normalized to that of the unheated control enzyme (14 nmol of 32P release; defined as 100%). The normalized activities are plotted as a function of preincubation temperature in Fig. 1F. Yeast 2μ plasmids encoding chimeric capping enzymes composed of an NH2-terminal segment derived fromS. cerevisiae Cet1 fused to either S. cerevisiaeCeg1 or S. pombe Pce1 were constructed as follows.CET1 gene fragments coding residues 201–549, 269–549, and 276–549 were PCR amplified using an antisense primer that changed the Val548 codon to alanine and introduced an NcoI restriction site at the codons for the COOH-terminal Cet1 dipeptide Ala548-Met549. The PCR products were digested with NcoI and then inserted into the NcoI site of pYX232-CEG1 (2μ TRP1) and pYX232-PCE1 (2μTRP1) to yield plasmids encoding in-frame fusion proteins Cet1(201–547)-Ceg1, Cet1(269–547)-Ceg1, Cet1(276–547)-Ceg1, Cet1(201–547)-Pce1, Cet1(269–547)-Pce1, and Cet1(276–547)-Pce1. Expression of the chimeric genes in these plasmids is under control of the yeast TPI1 promoter. The CET1 inserts were sequenced completely to confirm the in-frame fusion to CEG1or PCE1 and to exclude the introduction of unwanted coding changes during amplification and cloning. Yeast 2μ plasmids encoding chimeric capping enzymes composed of mammalian RNA triphosphatase Mce1(1–210) fused to either Ceg1 or Pce1 were constructed as follows. The Mce1(1–210) reading frame was subjected to two-stage PCR amplification using primers designed to eliminate an internal NcoI site (without altering the protein sequence), to introduce an NcoI site at the start codon, and to change the Glu211 codon to alanine and introduce an NcoI restriction site at the codons for the Ser210-Ala211 dipeptide. The PCR product was digested with NcoI and inserted into the NcoI site of pYX232-CEG1 (2μ TRP1) or pYX232-PCE1 (2μTRP1) to yield plasmids encoding the in-frame fusion proteins Mce1(1–210)-Ceg1 and Mce1(1–210)-Pce1. Expression of the chimeric mammalian-fungal capping enzymes in these plasmids is under the control of the yeast TPI1 promoter. TheMCE1(1–210) inserts were sequenced completely to confirm the in-frame fusion to CEG1 or PCE1 and to exclude the introduction of unwanted coding changes during amplification and cloning. Yeast CEN plasmids containing the chimeric genes were constructed by excising from the 2μ plasmids anAatI-NheI fragment containing the fusion gene and transferring the fragment into pYX132 (CEN TRP1). Expression of the fusion genes in the CEN plasmids is also under control of the TPI1 promoter. The ORF encoding full-length Ceg1(1–459) fused to an NH2-terminal His10 tag leader peptide was inserted into the pGEX-KG vector between the NcoI andBamHI sites. The resulting plasmid encodes a glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-His10Ceg1(1–549) fusion protein. Plasmids for expression of Ceg1 domains and domain fragments fused to GST were engineered as follows. An ORF encoding the NH2-terminal domain Ceg1(1–244) was amplified by PCR using an antisense primer that introduced a translation stop codon in lieu of the codon for Leu245 and a BamHI site 3′ of the stop codon. An ORF encoding the COOH-terminal domain Ceg1(245–459) was amplified by PCR using a sense primer that changed the Ser243-Leu244 codons to Met243-Gly244 and introduced an NcoI site at the new start codon. An ORF encoding the fragment Ceg1(245–360) was amplified by PCR using an antisense primer that introduced a translation stop codon in place of the codon for Gly361 and a BamHI site 3′ of the stop codon. An ORF encoding Ceg1(361–459) was amplified by PCR using a sense-strand primer that introduced an NcoI site and a methionine codon in lieu of the codon for Thr360. The PCR products were digested with NcoI and BamHI and then inserted into pGEX-KG to generate plasmids encoding fusion proteins GST-Ceg1(1–244), GST-Ceg1(245–459), GST-Ceg1(245–360), and GST-Ceg1(361–459). Plasmids encoding GST and the GST-Ceg1 fusion proteins were transformed into E. coli BL21(pLysE). Exponentially growing cultures were induced with 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 2% ethanol for 20 h at 17 °C. GST and the GST-Ceg1 fusion proteins were purified from soluble lysates by affinity chromatography on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin according to the instructions of the vendor (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST and GST-Ceg1 fusion proteins were eluted from the resin with buffer containing 10 mmglutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol. The eluates were dialyzed against binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.03% Triton X-100) and then stored at −80 °C. Purified GST and the GST-Ceg1 fusion proteins (either 10–15 μg of the proteins specified in in Fig. 5A or 30–40 μg of the proteins in Fig.5B) were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with glutathione-Sepharose beads (either 20–25 μl of beads in Fig.6A or 50–60 μl of beads in Fig. 6B) in 350 μl of binding buffer. The beads were then washed three times with 1 ml of binding buffer to remove any unbound protein. Affinity chromatography was performed by mixing the GSH beads containing bound GST-Ceg1 fusion proteins or GST with purified yeast triphosphatase Cet1(201–549) (either 4 μg in Fig. 6A or 8 μg in Fig.6B) in 50 μl of binding buffer. After incubation for 1 h on ice, the beads were concentrated by microcentrifugation and the supernatant was withdrawn. The beads were resuspended in 1 ml of binding buffer and subjected to three rounds of concentration and washing. After the third wash, the protein bound to the beads was eluted by beads were resuspended in 50 μl of binding buffer containing 10 mm glutathione. Aliquots (20 μl) of the input Cet1(201–549) sample, the first supernatant fraction (containing the “free” protein), and the bead-bound fraction were mixed with 5 μl of SDS sample buffer, heated at 90 °C for 3 min, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Polypeptides were visualized by staining the gel with Coomassie Blue dye.Figure 6Ceg1 affinity chromatography. Purified Cet1(201–549) (4 μg in panel A or 8 μg in panel B) was mixed with GSH-Sepharose beads bearing immobilized GST-Ceg1(1–459), GST-(1–244), GST-(245–459), or GST proteins and the mixtures were processed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Aliquots of the input Cet1(201–549) protein (lane L) (equivalent to 40% of material loaded), the free unbound protein (lanes F) (comprising 40% of the supernatant fraction), and the bead-bound fraction (lanes B) (comprising 40% of the glutathione/SDS eluate) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE.

The mutated CEG1 genes were inserted into the yeast plasmid pGYCE-358 (CEN TRP1) (17Schwer B. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The inserts were sequenced completely to confirm the presence of the programmed changes and to exclude the introduction of unwanted coding changes during amplification and cloning. The in vivo activity of the protein encoded by the mutated CEG1 alleles in supporting the growth of aceg1Δ strain was tested by plasmid shuffle as described previously (16Wang S.P. Deng L. Ho C.K.

Growth of YBS30 depends on maintenance of plasmid pGYCE-360 (CEN URA3 CEG1). Yeast strain YBS50 (MATa leu2 ade2 trp1 his3 ura3 can1 ceg1::hisG cet1::LEU2p360-CET1/CEG1) is deleted at the chromosomal CET1 andCEG1 loci. Growth of YBS50 is contingent on the maintenance of plasmid p360-CET1/CEG1 (CEN URA3 CET1 CEG1). Prior studies showed that the binding of full-length Cet1 or the truncated enzyme Cet1(201–549) to Ceg1 stimulated the guanylyltransferase activity of Ceg1 by an order of magnitude when guanylyltransferase activity was measured at 37 °C (2Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5189-5198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An equivalent stimulation was elicited by a synthetic peptide Cet1(232–265), which binds quantitatively and with high affinity to Ceg1 in vitro (3Ho C.K. Lehman K. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4671-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We show here that the purified recombinant Ceg1 protein is extremely thermolabile in vitro(Fig. 1A). Guanylyltransferase activity was abolished by preincubation of the protein for 10 min at 35 °C or higher and reduced by a factor of 5 after 10 min at 30 °C. Thus, Ceg1 is rapidly inactivated at physiological temperatures. The instructive finding was that mixture of Ceg1 with recombinant Cet1(201–549) protein effected a dramatic shift to the right in the guanylyltransferase thermal inactivation profile, such that the Cet1(201–549)-Ceg1 complex was impervious to preincubation for 10 min at 30 °C and retained 50% of the original activity after incubation at 35 °C (Fig. 1A). The synthetic peptide Cet1(232–265) also had a profound protective effect against thermal inactivation of Ceg1, whereby the Cet1(232–265)-Ceg1 complex retained 70% of the original activity after incubation for 10 min at 35 °C (Fig.1B). A synthetic Cet1(232–265) peptide containing a quadruple alanine-cluster mutation of the WAQKW motif had no salutary effect on the stability of Ceg1 (Fig. 1B). The 4xAla mutant peptide does not bind Ceg1 and does not stimulate its activity at 37 °C (3Ho C.K. Lehman K. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4671-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We conclude that the stimulation of Ceg1 by Cet1 is attributable to protein stabilization. In contrast to the instability of Ceg1, we found that the triphosphatase activity of Cet1(201–549) was stable to preincubation at 30–35 °C and its thermal inactivation profile was unaffected by prior binding to the yeast guanylyltransferase Ceg1 (Fig.1F). Thus, the protective effects of Cet1-Ceg1 complex formation on enzyme stability in vitro are not reciprocal. To test whether the inactivation of Ceg1 at physiological temperatures can be reversed ex post facto by Cet1, we varied the order of addition of the protective Cet1(232–265) peptide with respect to the heat treatment. Mixture of Ceg1 with the Cet1 peptide on ice before heating the protein for 10 min at 35 °C resulted in 11-fold higher guanylyltransferase activity compared with heat-treated Ceg1 that had not been exposed to Cet1(232–265). Yet, mixing the already heat-treated Ceg1 with the Cet1 peptide on ice had no restorative effect on the guanylyltransferase activity (Fig.2). Thus, Cet1 could not reverse the inactivation of Ceg1, implying that Cet1 is not serving as a chaperone that promotes refolding of Ceg1 or resumption of an active conformation. Rather, Cet1 binding to Ceg1 stabilizes the guanylyltransferase only prospectively against thermal inactivation. The guanylyltransferase-binding peptide domain is conserved in C. albicans RNA triphosphatase CaCet1 and we have shown that the C. albicans guanylyltransferase Cgt1 binds avidly to the Cet1(232–265) peptide in vitro (3Ho C.K. Lehman K. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4671-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To gauge if stabilization of guanylyltransferase by triphosphatase is a general phenomenon in fungal systems, we examined the thermal stability of Cgt1 in the absence and presence of Cet1(232–265). Two notable findings emerged. First, Candida guanylyltransferase was more stable than the Saccharomyces enzyme. Cgt1 retained 40% of the original activity after 10 min at 35 °C (Fig.1C) compared with 2% activity for Ceg1 (Fig.1A). Second, the Candida guanylyltransferase was protected from thermal inactivation by the Cet1(232–265) peptide. This was especially clear during treatment at 40 °C, whereby the Cet1(232–265)-Cgt1 complex retained 55% activity compared with 5% for Cgt1 alone (Fig. 1C). In contrast, the S. pombe RNA guanylyltransferase Pce1 (18Shuman S. Liu Y. Schwer B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12046-12050Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) was clearly more thermostable than either Ceg1 or Cgt1. Pce1 was unaffected by preincubation at up to 35 °C (which abolished Ceg1 activity), retained 70% of basal activity after heating at 40 °C (compared with 5% activity for Cgt1) and 25% activity after treatment a 45 °C. Moreover, its thermal inactivation profile was unaffected by the Cet1(232–265) peptide (Fig. 1D). We found that the Cet1(232–265) peptide interacts very weakly with Pce1 in vitro as gauged by peptide-affinity chromatography (data not shown) (3Ho C.K. Lehman K. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4671-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These experiments show that the stabilizing effect of RNA triphosphatase on guanylyltransferase is conserved in two species of budding yeast, but not in fission yeast. The guanylyltransferase component of the mammalian capping enzyme, Mce1(211–597), was also much more thermostable than S. cerevisiae Ceg1. The mammalian capping enzyme was unaffected by pretreatment at 35 °C and retained 25% of its activity after heating at 45 °C (Fig. 1E). The heat inactivation profile of Mce1(211–597) was unaffected by Cet1(232–265) (Fig.1E). This result was not surprising given that: (i) the RNA triphosphatase component of mammalian capping enzyme is structurally unrelated to the fungal triphosphatases (19Changela A. Ho C.K. Martins A. Shuman S. Mondragon A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2575-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and (ii) the Cet1(232–265) peptide binds very weakly to Mce1(211–597) (3Ho C.K. Lehman K. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4671-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain Cet1(276–549) lacks the high-affinity guanylyltransferase-binding site and does not interact with Ceg1in vitro (9Lehman K. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Rouzankina I. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22668-22678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cet1(269–549) also lacks the Ceg1-binding site. Neither CET1(269–549) nor CET1(276–549)was able to complement growth of S. cerevisiae cet1Δ cells, even when the truncated enzymes were expressed in high gene dosage under the control of the strong constitutive yeastTPI1 promoter (Ref. 9Lehman K.

Remarkably, thein vivo function of Cet1(276–549) was restored when it was fused to the guanylyltransferase domain of the mammalian capping enzyme (9Lehman K. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Rouzankina I. Shuman S.

An autosomal recessive form of severe combined immunodeficiency in humans has been described as resulting from mutations within the gene encoding ZAP-70. This deficiency is characterized by an absence of CD8+ T cells and an increased number of nonfunctional CD4+ T cells with a mature phenotype in the periphery. These CD4+ T cells are unresponsive to either antigenic stimulation in vivo or CD2- and CD3-mediated activation in vitro (1Chan A.C. Kadlecek T.A. Elder M.E. Filipovich A.H. Kuo W.L. Iwashima M.

Biol. 1994; 4: 731-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). According to current concepts, binding of antigen to the T cell receptor (TCR)1 initiates a cascade of early signaling events, which includes activation of the protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) of the Src family. These PTKs phosphorylate the immune-receptor tyrosine-based activation motifs, which are present in all the chains of the CD3-ζ complex. This allows the recruitment of ZAP-70, which is then phosphorylated and activated and subsequently phosphorylates a number of key substrates including LAT, SLP-76, and Vav. These tyrosine kinase reactions are required for CD3-induced mobilization of intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i) and activation of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), leading to cytokine production and proliferation, responses that are all defective in the absence of ZAP-70 (4Chan A.C. Desai D.M. Weiss A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 555-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). ZAP-70 not only plays a crucial role in CD3-mediated T cell activation but also in CD2-mediated activation (5Ueno H. Matsuda S. Katamura K. Mayumi M. Koyasu S. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 6Meinl E. Lengenfelder D. Blank N. Pirzer R. Barata L. Hivroz C. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3578-3583Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). CD2 constitutes the so-called alternative pathway of T cell activation (7Meuer S.C. Hussey R.E. Fabbi M. Fox D. Acuto O.

Cell. 1984; 36: 897-906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar); simultaneous triggering of two distinct epitopes on CD2 by two mAbs induces T cells to proliferate and secrete lymphokines in the absence of antigen and antigen-presenting cells. A mutual activation via CD2 is the basis of the autocrine growth of human T cells transformed by Herpesvirus saimiri (8Mittrücker H.W. Müller-Fleckenstein I. Fleckenstein B. Fleischer B. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).H. saimiri is an oncogenic virus that induces leukemia and lymphoma in New World and Old World primates (9Knappe A. Feldmann G.

This virus transforms human T cells to stable growth in vitro (10Biesinger B. Müller-Fleckenstein I. Simmer B. Lang G. Wittmann S. Platzer E. Desrosiers R.C. Fleckenstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3116-3119Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Human T cells transformed by this virus retain essential properties of native T cells. In particular they display a structurally and functionally intact TCR and show a grossly unaltered sensitivity to different apoptotic pathways. The preservation of an intact TCR distinguishesH. saimiri-transformed T cells from T cells transformed with human T cell leukemia virus-1, which tend to lose their TCRs (11Meinl E. Hohlfeld R. Wekerle H. Fleckenstein B. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 55-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). An essential difference between native uninfected T cells and H. saimiri-transformed T cells is their differential requirement for CD2-mediated activation. Native uninfected T cells are activated via CD2 only by certain pairs of mAbs but not by the binding of CD2 to its ligand CD58. In contrast, H. saimiri-transformed T cells are activated by interaction with CD58-bearing cells or, alternatively, by a single mAb to the T11.1 epitope of CD2 provided the mAb is cross-linked (8Mittrücker H.W. Müller-Fleckenstein I. Fleckenstein B. Fleischer B. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to obtain further insights into the mechanisms responsible for the transformation of T cells by H. saimiri. To this end, we studied activation of H. saimiri-transformed T cell lines established from primary T cells of two severe combined immunodeficiency patients with ZAP-70 deficiencies. We report herein that H. saimiri transforms ZAP-70-deficient T cells to stable growth and can overcome the requirement of ZAP-70 for T cell activation. CD2 and CD3 activation of these T cell lines induces activation of MAPK, increase of [Ca2+]i, and cytokine production. We studied two unrelated severe combined immunodeficiency patients presenting with defects in ZAP-70 expression. The first patient has been described previously (6Meinl E. Lengenfelder D. Blank N. Pirzer R. Barata L. Hivroz C. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3578-3583Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and has a homozygous deletion in the zap-70 gene, which leads to a complete absence of ZAP-70 protein expression. The second patient had clinical phenotype typical for ZAP-70 deficiency (3Hivroz C. Fischer A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 731-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and biochemically a complete lack of ZAP-70 protein expression (Fig. 1), but the genetic abnormality is not yet defined. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from both ZAP-70-defective patients were activated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate + ionomycin and expanded in IL-2 for a few days. Subsequently the cells were infected with H. saimiri strain C488 and cultured as described (11Meinl E. Hohlfeld R. Wekerle H. Fleckenstein B. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 55-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As controls, we used several H. saimiri-transformed T cell clones and lines (ES-8T, SS-8T, Wi-4T, DT, and HT) established from control donors and the transformed cell line CB15 obtained from cord blood. mAbs directed to CD3, CD4, CD8, CD69, TCRαβ, TCRγδ, and HLA-DR, and labeled isotype controls were obtained from Becton Dickinson (Heidelberg, Germany). CD2 expression was detected with supernatant of the hybridoma TS2/18.1.1 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse-IgG F(ab)2 fragment (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). Flow cytometry analysis was performed on a FACScalibur or FACScan® flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). For CD2-mediated activation, the mAb 39C1.5, which recognizes the T11.1 epitope (Coulter Immunotech, Hamburg, Germany), was applied, and for CD3-mediated activation, the mAb OKT-3 was applied. The mAbs were cross-linked with murine A20 cells, which express high amounts of Fc receptors. Alternatively, the stimulating mAbs were cross-linked by absorbing to the plastic plates. As a control a mAb recognizing CD58 (purified from the hybridoma TS2/9.1.4.3, which was obtained from ATCC) was used. The Src family-specific inhibitor PP2 (Calbiochem, Bad Soden, Germany) and the Syk/ZAP-70-specific inhibitor piceatannol (Sigma) were applied. PP2 was dissolved in Me2SO at 20 mg/ml (66 mm) and used at a final concentration of 10 μm. Piceatannol was dissolved in Me2SO at 10 mg/ml (41 mm) and used at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. Both inhibitors were used immediately after dissolving. The T cells were preincubated with the diluted inhibitors in the incubator for 30 min and subsequently stimulated. At the applied concentrations, the inhibitors were not cytotoxic, and the solvent Me2SO did not interfere significantly with T cell activation. About 5 × 104 T cells were seeded per well in a volume of 200 μl of medium without IL-2. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Supernatants were collected 24 h after activation. Production of TNF-α, interferon-γ, and IL-2 was determined by ELISA. H. saimiri-transformed T cells were seeded in 96-well flat-bottom plates at a density of 2.5 × 104 or 1 × 105cells/well in 200 μl of culture medium without IL-2. The anti-CD2 mAb 39C1.5 or control rat Ig was added at 4 μg/ml at four time points. Three days later, 0.2 μCi of [3H]thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added for another 16 h. Cultures were harvested and analyzed with the direct β counter Matrix TM96 (Packard Instrument Co.). H. saimiri-transformed T cells or primary T cells prepared as described (6Meinl E. Lengenfelder D. Blank N. Pirzer R. Barata L. Hivroz C. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3578-3583Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) were left unactivated or activated for 3 min at 37 °C in the presence of the anti-TCR mAb UCHT1 (ascitic fluid at 1/1000) or a combination of the two anti-CD2 mAbs X11 and D66 (kindly given by Dr L. Boumsel, INSERM U448, France). Cells were then lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100 μmNa3VO4, and protease inhibitors) for 20 min at 4 °C. Nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation. Protein concentrations were determined in the post-nuclear lysates using a Bio-Rad kit. For immunoprecipitations, the same amount of lysate was precleared at 4 °C by rocking with mouse or rabbit purified IgG for 1 h at 4 °C. Then protein G-Sepharose beads were added and the nonspecific immunoprecipitates recovered by centrifugation. After this preclearing, lysates were incubated overnight with anti-Syk Abs (Santa Cruz, sc-1077), with anti-ζ mAb (Santa Cruz, sc-1239), or anti-ZAP-70 Abs. Specific immunoprecipitates were recovered by the addition of protein G-Sepharose beads for 1 h and were washed three times in lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates or post-nuclear cell lysates were then run on standard SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore). Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween. The following first antibodies were used: anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10; anti-Syk mAb (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) or anti-Syk polyclonal Ab (Santa Cruz); anti-ZAP-70 mAb (Transduction Laboratory) and polyclonal Ab (kindly given by B. Malissen, Marseille, France); anti-ζ-chain mAb (Santa Cruz); anti-p56Lck and anti-p59Fyn Abs (Santa Cruz); anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK mAb (New England Biolabs); and anti-ERK2 polyclonal Abs (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The antibody/antigen complexes were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system according to the manufacturer's instruction (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using anti-mouse Ig or anti-rabbit Ig Abs coupled to horseradish peroxidase as secondary antibodies. For quantitative Western blot, an anti-mouse Ig coupled to alkaline phosphatase (Dako, Hamburg) and the substrate CDP-star (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were applied. The quantification was done with the LumiImager (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Afterward, Coomassie Blue staining of the blotted membranes assessed equal loading of the different lanes. [Ca2+]i was determined as described previously (6Meinl E. Lengenfelder D. Blank N. Pirzer R. Barata L. Hivroz C. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3578-3583Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The T cells were activated via CD3 with the mAb OKT3 and via CD2 with the mAbs 39C1.5 and 6F10.3. Cross-linking was achieved with goat anti-mouse Ig or goat anti-rat Ig, respectively. After infection with H. saimiri, stable growing cells were obtained from both of the ZAP-70-deficient donors. The transformed T cell lines were designated ZAP-70–1T and ZAP-70–2T. These cells had the phenotype of mature activated CD4+ T cells expressing CD2, CD3, and the TCRαβ along with the activation markers CD69 and HLA-DR (Fig.1A for ZAP-70–1T and data not shown for ZAP-70–2T). Phenotypically, the ZAP-70-deficient transformed T cells could not be distinguished from other CD4+ H. saimiri-transformed cell lines. Western blot experiments performed on both total cell lysates and ZAP-70 immunoprecipitates demonstrated that the H. saimiri-transformed T cell lines did not recover ZAP-70 expression (Figs. 1B and 2, Aand B). The expression of the two Src-PTKs, Fyn and Lck, was normal in the H. saimiri-transformed T cell lines from both patients (Fig. 1C). We analyzed the expression of the ZAP-70-related PTK Syk in primary and transformed T cells. Syk was not over-expressed in the primary T cells from the two patients (Fig. 2). We noted that H. saimiri-transformed T cell lines and uninfected T cell lines from control donors showed a similar expression level of ZAP-70 and of Syk (Fig. 2). However, when ZAP-70-deficient transformed T cells were infected withH. saimiri, the outgrowing transformed T cells displayed a strong overexpression of Syk (Fig. 2, A and B). This observation was confirmed using a quantitative Western blot (Fig.2C). It showed that Syk was expressed at least 20-fold more than in other transformed cell lines obtained from control donors, which exhibit low, barely detectable, and variable levels of Syk. To analyze CD3-mediated [Ca2+]i, the mAb OKT-3 was used with and without cross-linking. In two independent experiments, the increase in [Ca2+]i triggered by CD3-mediated activation was found to be defective in primary T cells derived from ZAP-70-deficient patients in that no or only a marginal [Ca2+]iwas observed (Fig. 3C), in accordance with Refs. 1Chan A.C. Kadlecek T.A. Elder M.E. Filipovich A.H. Kuo W.L. Iwashima M. Parslow T.G. Weiss A. Science. 1994; 264: 1599-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar and 2Arpaia E. Shahar M. Dadi H. Cohen A. Roifman C.M. Cell. 1994; 76: 947-958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). In contrast, CD3 activation induced a strong increase in [Ca2+]i in ZAP-70-defective T cells after transformation (Fig. 3D) in each of four independent experiments with the H. saimiri-transformed T cell line ZAP-70–1T. The complete lack of CD2-induced [Ca2+]i in primary ZAP-70-deficient T cells has been described previously in detail (6Meinl E. Lengenfelder D. Blank N. Pirzer R. Barata L. Hivroz C. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3578-3583Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Here we analyzed the [Ca2+]i inH. saimiri-transformed T cells after CD2 activation. Fig. 3(compare panels A and B) demonstrates that ZAP-70-deficient T cells are rendered responsive to CD2 activation after transformation with H. saimiri. It is a unique feature of H. saimiri-transformed T cells to become activated via CD2 with one cross-linked mAb directed to the T11.1 epitope (8Mittrücker H.W. Müller-Fleckenstein I. Fleckenstein B. Fleischer B. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Our study shows that ZAP-70-deficient H. saimiri-transformed T cells respond with an increase of [Ca2+]i after cross-linking of the T11.1 epitope (Fig. 3F). CD2- and CD3-mediated phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 was defective in the ZAP-70-defective nontransformed T cells (Fig.4). By contrast, in ZAP-70-deficientH. saimiri-transformed T cells the MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2 are activated upon CD2 or CD3 activation as reflected by their phosphorylation (Fig. 4). The activation-induced phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 was comparable in cell lines established from the ZAP-70-deficient patients and from control donors. Because H. saimirirestored MAPK activation and [Ca2+]i, we analyzed to what extent the CD2- and CD3-dependent signal cascades were restored. CD2 or CD3 triggering of H. saimiri-transformed T cells induced no phosphorylation of ζ (Fig. 5). By contrast, activation of cell lines established from control donors readily induced a phosphorylation of the ζ chain (Fig. 5). Because we found that Syk was heavily overexpressed in ZAP-70-deficient H. saimiri-transformed T cells, we studied whether the Syk expressed in the transformed cell lines could be activated. Triggering of CD2 and CD3 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk in H. saimiri-transformed cell lines established from both control donors and ZAP-70-deficient patients (Fig. 5). Because primary ZAP-70-deficient T cells do not respond to CD2 and CD3 triggering in terms of cytokine production (6Meinl E. Lengenfelder D. Blank N. Pirzer R. Barata L. Hivroz C. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3578-3583Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the ZAP-70-deficientH. saimiri-transformed T cells ZAP-70–1T and ZAP-70–2T derived from both patients were analyzed for CD2- and CD3-mediated cytokine production. To this end, a mAb recognizing the T11.1 epitope on CD2 or the CD3-specific mAb OKT-3 was added and cross-linked either with Fc receptor-expressing A20 cells (Fig.6, A and B) or after binding to the microtiter plate (Fig. 6C). As control, a mAb directed to CD58, which is abundantly expressed on H. saimiri-transformed T cells, was applied. The H. saimiri-transformed T cell lines obtained from both of the ZAP-70-defective patients responded to this activation via CD2 or CD3 in a manner similar to the other ZAP-70-expressing transformed T cells with increased production of TNF-α (Fig. 6) and interferon-γ (data not shown). PP2, an inhibitor of Src family kinases, and piceatannol, an inhibitor of Syk/ZAP-70 kinases, blocked the CD2-induced production of IL-2 and TNF-α of both the ZAP-70-deficient and control H. saimiri-transformed T cell lines (Fig.7).Figure 7Inhibitors of Src and Syk/ZAP-70 kinases interfere with CD2-mediated activation. H. saimiri-transformed T cell lines from the first and second patient as well as the transformed control cell line SS-8T were preincubated in the presence of 10 μm PP2 or 10 μg/ml piceatannol and then activated with the CD2-specific mAb 39C1.5 cross-linked by A20 cells. Supernatants were collected after 24 h and analyzed by ELISA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because ZAP-70-deficient H. saimiri-transformed T cells were responsive to CD2- and CD3-mediated T cell activation, we analyzed whether their autocrine growth was mediated via CD2. To this end we cultured ZAP-70-deficientH. saimiri-transformed T cells and control T cells in the presence of a mAb that blocks the CD2-CD58 interaction. In the presence of this mAb, the spontaneous proliferation of the ZAP-70-expressing and ZAP-70-deficient transformed T cells was reduced to a similar extent (Fig. 8). We demonstrate that the infection by H. saimiri of T cells from two patients with ZAP-70 deficiencies restores T cell activation by CD2 and CD3. H. saimiri does not encode for a gene that has homology to ZAP-70 (13Albrecht J.C. Nicholas J. Biller D. Cameron K.R. Biesinger B. Newman C. Wittmann S. Craxton M.A. Coleman H. Fleckenstein B. Honess R.W. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5047-5058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but it can replace this tyrosine kinase. Different cellular and biochemical events occurring as a consequence of TCR or CD2 activation were analyzed to gain insight into the mechanisms used by the virus to substitute for ZAP-70. When comparing a series of wild type H. saimiri-transformed T cells with the patient-derived T cell lines, we found that Syk, which belongs to the same family of PTK as ZAP-70, was heavily overexpressed in the ZAP-70-deficient transformed T cells. In contrast, primary T cells from the same patients expressed low levels of Syk that are comparable to the ones observed in mature T cells (14Chu D.H. van Oers N.S. Malissen M. Harris J. Elder M. Weiss A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2610-2620PubMed Google Scholar). These low levels of Syk could not substitute for ZAP-70 for CD2- or CD3-triggered activation (6Meinl E. Lengenfelder D. Blank N. Pirzer R. Barata L. Hivroz C. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3578-3583Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In H. saimiri-transformed cell lines, the enormously overexpressed Syk becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated upon CD2 and CD3 activation. This suggests that Syk overexpression in the ZAP-70-deficient lines may be responsible for the CD2- and CD3-induced activation observed in these cell lines. Syk has indeed been shown to be able to substitute to some extent for ZAP-70 in other models. In ZAP-70−/− mice, thymocyte development can be restored by Syk expression (15Gong Q. White L. Johnson R. White M. Negishi I. Thomas M. Chan A.C. Immunity. 1997; 7: 369-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), indicating that ZAP-70 and Syk have overlapping functions. In the P116 Jurkat clone lacking both Syk and ZAP-70 expression, tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins and NF-AT activation are restored by Syk expression (16Williams B.L. Schreiber K.L. Zhang W. Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Leibson P.J. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1388-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown in T cell blasts obtained from two siblings presenting with ZAP-70 deficiency and overexpressing Syk after expansion that CD3 activation was restored to some extent (17Noraz N. Schwarz K. Steinberg M. Dardalhon V. Rebouissou C. Hipskind R. Friedrich W. Yssel H. Bacon K. Taylor N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15832-15838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The results obtained in our present study on ZAP-70-deficient H. saimiri-transformed T cells present some similarities to but also has properties distinct from the ones obtained on blasts from ZAP-70-deficient patients. In this study, we showed that upon transformation with H. saimiri, ZAP-70-deficient T cells became responsive to CD3 and CD2 activation in terms of an increase in [Ca2+]i, MAPK activation, cytokine production, and cell proliferation, whereas these responses were impaired in the primary T cells from the ZAP-70-deficient patients. In contrast, in the study published by Noraz et al. (17Noraz N. Schwarz K. Steinberg M. Dardalhon V. Rebouissou C. Hipskind R. Friedrich W. Yssel H. Bacon K. Taylor N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15832-15838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), CD3-induced MAPK activation and proliferation were not fully restored in the ZAP-70-deficient T cell blasts expressing high levels of Syk. Moreover, the CD3-induced increase in [Ca2+]i obtained in the ZAP-70 T cell blasts presented unique features compared with those obtained in normal T cell blasts. Altogether, this suggests that the overexpression of Syk, as we observed in this study, can partially but not completely explain the restoration of CD2- and CD3-mediated signaling events after transformation with H. saimiri. Remarkably, as reported in primary T cells from the ZAP-70-deficient patients (6Meinl E. Lengenfelder D. Blank N. Pirzer R. Barata L. Hivroz C. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3578-3583Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), CD2 or CD3 activation of the transformed cell lines from the patients did not induce any tyrosine phosphorylation of the ζ chain, showing that Syk does not induce exactly the same signaling events as ZAP-70 in T cells. These data are consistent with another study showing that ζ phosphorylation is defective in the P116 Jurkat cells transfected with Syk (16Williams B.L. Schreiber K.L. Zhang W. Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Leibson P.J. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1388-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the Src homology-2 domains of ZAP-70 might protect the phosphorylated immune-receptor tyrosine-based activation motifs of the ζ chain from dephosphorylation (4Chan A.C. Desai D.M. Weiss A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 555-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Because this defect remains in H. saimiri-transformed T cells overexpressing Syk, this argues that Syk cannot replace ZAP-70 for the protection of ζ from dephosphorylation. The mechanisms underlying the overexpression of Syk in ZAP-70-deficient transformed cells are unclear. Infection with H. saimiri and subsequent transformation as such are not responsible for the overexpression of Syk, because in none of the transformed T cells from normal donors was Syk expressed at higher levels than in noninfected T cells. One possible explanation for Syk overexpression could be the following. During the process of growth transformation after infection with H. saimiri, there is a selective advantage for cells that can be activated by CD2 because stable growth after infection with H. saimiri is based on CD2-mediated activation. Indeed, we demonstrate that in the ZAP-70-deficient transformed T cells, as in ZAP-70-expressing T cell lines (8Mittrücker H.W. Müller-Fleckenstein I. Fleckenstein B. Fleischer B. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), an autocrine growth was mediated via CD2 activation. This suggests that after H. saimiri infection of ZAP-70-deficient T cells there is a selective growth advantage for T cells expressing high levels of Syk. During T cell ontogeny, Syk expression is down-regulated; however, there is a small population of TCRαβ CD4+ T cells that expresses a high level of Syk (14Chu D.H. van Oers N.S. Malissen M. Harris J. Elder M. Weiss A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2610-2620PubMed Google Scholar). This population may be the one that is transformed by H. saimiriand has a selective advantage to grow. We observed that a specific inhibitor of the Syk tyrosine kinase family blocked CD2-induced production of TNF-α and IL-2 in H. saimiri-transformed T cells from both normal donor and ZAP-70-deficient patients. These results argue that ZAP-70, in the control H. saimiri T cell lines, and Syk, in the ZAP-70-deficient T cell lines, are implicated in T cell activation. Src tyrosine kinases are also involved in both cases, because PP2 inhibited T cell activation of H. saimiri-transformed T cell lines. These results support the notion that this virus utilizes T cell activation pathways to ensure stable growth of the infected T cells. As previously discussed overexpression of Syk cannot fully explain the restoration of CD2 and CD3 activation observed in the ZAP-70-deficient T cells transformed by H. saimiri. It is possible that viral proteins cooperate with Syk to restore CD2 and CD3 responsiveness. In human transformed T cells, H. saimiri persists episomally, and only two viral genes are transcribed constitutively in human transformed T cells (18Fickenscher H. Bökel C. Knappe A. Biesinger B. Meinl E. Fleischer B. Fleckenstein B. Bröker B.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2252-2263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both corresponding proteins, tyrosine kinase-interacting protein (Tip) and H. saimiritransformation-associated protein of C strains (STP-C), are absolutely required for growth transformation (19Duboise S.M. Guo J. Czajak S. Desrosiers R.C. Jung J.U. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1308-1313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and interact with signaling proteins. Tip binds to Lck and is phosphorylated by Lck (20Biesinger B. Tsygankov A.Y. Fickenscher H. Emmrich F. Fleckenstein B. Bolen J.B. Bröker B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4729-4734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In most (21Wiese N. Tsygankov A.Y. Klauenberg U. Bolen J.B. Fleischer B. Bröker B.M. J. Biol.

Virol. 1995; 69: 7814-7822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) Tip activated Lck. Tip also activates STAT-1, STAT-3, and NF-AT-dependent transcription (22Hartley D.A. Amdjadi K. Hurley T.R. Lund T.C. Medveczky P.G. Sefton B.M. Virology. 2000; 276: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 25Lund T.C. Garcia R. Medveczky M.M. Jove R. Medveczky P.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6677-6682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A model has been proposed in which Lck phosphorylates Tip and the phosphorylated Tip then recruits STATs (26Hartley D.A. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16925-16932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The other viral protein essential for transformation, STP-C, binds to Ras, favoring its active GTP-bound state and stimulating MAPK activity (27Jung J.U. Desrosiers R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6506-6512Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). STP-C also binds to TRAFs (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor) leading to NF-κB activation (28Lee H. Choi J.K. Li M. Kaye K. Kieff E. Jung J.U. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3913-3919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oncogenic Ras can replace STP-C for T cell transformation (29Guo J. Williams K. Duboise S.M. Alexander L. Veazey R. Jung J.U. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3698-3704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of these studies indicate that H. saimiri proteins may contribute to modifications of the signaling pathways. Normal T cellular activation pathways are not only preserved during transformation but, as we show here, are even reconstituted. H. saimiri reconstituted the CD2-mediated activation pathway, probably because the virus needs this to ensure the growth of the infected T cells. Remarkably, the CD3-mediated activation pathways were also restored, although CD3-mediated activation is not needed for stable growth because antigen-specific T cell clones can be stably transformed independently of the presence of their antigen (11Meinl E. Hohlfeld R. Wekerle H. Fleckenstein B. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 55-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The reconstitution of the CD3 pathway along with the CD2 pathway probably reflects the fact that CD2 and CD3 signaling pathways share common features as already described (30Howard F.D. Moingeon P. Moebius U. McConkey D.J. Yandava B. Gennert T.E. Reinherz E.L. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 31Ley S.C. Davies A.A. Druker B. Crumpton M.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 2203-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The substitution of ZAP-70 by H. saimiri transformation is a special feature of this virus and not a mere consequence of growth transformation, because ZAP-70-deficient T cells that have been transformed by human T cell leukemia virus-1 essentially continue to display the same activation deficits that are characteristic of native ZAP-70-deficient T cells (5Ueno H. Matsuda S. Katamura K. Mayumi M. Koyasu S. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 32Taylor N. Bacon K.B. Smith S. Jahn T. Kadlecek T.A. Uribe L. Kohn D.B. Gelfand E.W. Weiss A. Weinberg K. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2031-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Moreover, in contrast to H. saimiri, human T cell leukemia virus-1 down-regulates the expression of ZAP-70 (12Weil R. Levraud J.P. Dodon M.D. Bessia C. Hazan U. Kourilsky P. Israel A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3709-3717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, our study shows that transformation by H. saimiri replaces ZAP-70 for most CD2- and CD3-mediated activation events. This replacement of ZAP-70 was not achieved with a genetically engineered virus but rather with the wild type virus that does not code for a ZAP-70 homologue. To our knowledge this is the first report showing that a wild type virus can restore CD2- and CD3-mediated activation in signaling-deficient human T cells. Because autocrine activation is dependent on CD2 activation, the virus needs to restore this to ensure growing of the latently infected cells. This study shows that thereby CD3 responsiveness is also restored, suggesting that CD3-mediated proliferation shares the signaling pathways with CD2-mediated proliferation. We are grateful to I.

In this study we examined the molecular and biochemical changes associated with carcinogen resistance in a series of aryl hydrocarbon-resistant MCF-7 cell lines developed by exposure to benzo[a]pyrene (BP). The cell lines were designated as AHR40, AHR100, and AHR200 to denote their increasing fold resistance to BP compared with wild type cells. These cell lines were also resistant to another aryl hydrocarbon (AH), dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, but not to pleiotropic drugs (doxorubicin, vinblastine, and taxol). The resistant cell lines showed an increase in the level of the primary intracellular antioxidant, reduced glutathione, corresponding to increasing AH resistance. However, there was no change in glutathione reductase activity. The generation of reduced glutathione requires NADPH, and we therefore examined the activity and expression of the rate-limiting enzyme in NADPH production, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). An increase in G6PD specific activity was associated with increasing aryl hydrocarbon resistance. This was due to an increased expression of G6PD in resistant cells, which was demonstrated by increases in both protein and mRNA levels. However, there was no increase in the transcription rate of G6PD in the resistant cell lines, indicating that the increase G6PD expression is due to a post-transcriptional modulation, which was confirmed by actinomycin D chase experiments. These results demonstrate that modulation of G6PD expression and activity is an important mechanism in AH resistance.

Chem. 1997; 272: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and glutathioneS-transferase (6Xia H. Pan S.S. Hu X. Srivastava S.K. Pal A. Singh S.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 353: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Both Phase 1 and Phase 2 enzymes require NADPH as a co-factor. NADPH is the primary intracellular reductant whose synthesis is regulated by the oxidative arm of glucose metabolism, the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). The rate-limiting enzyme of the PPP (Fig. 1) is glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) (7Chayen J. Howat D.W. Bitensky L. Cell Biochem. Funct. 1986; 4: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), whose major physiological role is to supply NADPH by the conversion of glucose 6-phosphate (Glu-6-P) to 6-phosphogluconate. NADPH is also generated by the next step in the PPP, the conversion of 6-phosphogluconate to ribulose 5-phosphate by 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. The essentiality of G6PD in mammalian cells has been well recognized. It is highly conserved during evolution (8Luzzatto L. Cell Biochem. Funct. 1987; 5: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and it has been shown to be necessary for cell growth (9Tian W.N. Braunstein L.D. Pang J. Stuhlmeier K.M. Xi Q.C. Tian X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10609-10617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). G6PD, normally thought of as a “housekeeping” enzyme whose expression is constitutive, is, in fact, induced by agents which cause oxidative stress (10Cramer C.T. Cooke S. Ginsberg L.C. Kletzien R.F. Stapleton S.R. Ulrich R.G. J. Biochem. Toxicol. 1995; 10: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 11Ursini M.V. Parrella A. Rosa G. Salzano S. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and is essential for resistance to oxidative stress (12Salvemini F. Franze A. Iervolino A. Filosa S. Salzano S. Ursini M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2750-2757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). G6PD is also induced by other agents such as insulin and epidermal growth factor (13Molero C. Benito M. Lorenzo M. Exp. Cell. Res. 1994; 10: 26-32Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and by dietary conditions (14Stabile L.P. Hodge D.L. Klautky S.A. Salati L.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 322: 269-279Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar,15Hodge D.L. Salati L.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Because of the essential role of NADPH in carcinogen detoxification, we hypothesize that modulation of G6PD activity may be directly associated with carcinogen resistance. To test this hypothesis, we developed a series of aryl hydrocarbon-resistant (AHR) cells derived from MCF-7 human breast epithelial cancer cells by continuous exposure to BP. These cells were grown in escalating concentrations of BP, reserving surviving cells at each level of BP. We thereby generated a series of cells with increasing resistance to the cytotoxic effects of BP. These cell lines were also resistant to another AH, dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) but not to pleiotropic drugs (doxorubicin, vinblastine, and taxol). We found that AH resistance is associated with changes in G6PD activity and expression, indicating that G6PD is a central mechanism involved in carcinogen resistance. Dicoumarol, Glu-6-P, NADP+, NADPH, G6PD, anti-G6PD, Tween 20, flavin adenine dinucleotide, glutathione reductase, oxidized glutathione, 2,6-dichloroindophenol, BP, DMBA, menadione, and dimethyl sulfoxide were purchased from Sigma. Colorimetric assay for glutathione reductase was from Oxis International, Inc. (Portland, OR) and glutathione assay kit was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Omniscript reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) kit was from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Primers for G6PD RT-PCR were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). RPMI 1640, glutamine, fetal bovine serum, trypsin/EDTA, normal saline, TBE buffer, Trizol, and LipofectAMINE were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). The β-galactosidase-containing reporter vector was fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). 10% TBE gels, sample and running buffers were from Novex (San Diego, CA). To generate MCF-7 cell lines with different levels of resistance to AH, wild type (WT) MCF-7 cells were initially grown and serially passed in 0.05 μm BP. A stock of the surviving cells was preserved by freezing in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide. The remaining cells were then grown with stepwise increases of BP concentrations for 6–9 months, with a stock of surviving cells preserved by freezing after each increase in BP. From the many resistant subclones thus generated, we selected 3 for this study, demonstrating 40-, 100-, and 200-fold increase in the BP concentration needed to inhibit cell growth by 50% (IC50). These cell lines were designated AHR40, AHR100, and AHR200. The AHR cell lines were maintained by continuous exposure to their IC50 concentration of BP for five passages, and the cells were subsequently passed in BP-free medium for at least 4 passages prior to experimental use. For the experiments, AHR cells in the 4th to the 10th passages without BP were used. All experiments were carried out on 75% confluent cells in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine, unless otherwise indicated. Cells were plated in triplicate at 500,000 cell/25-cm2 flask in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. BP or DMBA dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide was added at different concentrations after 24 h of plating. Cells were counted by hemocytometer daily for 5 continuous days. Enzyme assays were performed using the cytosolic fraction of each cell line. Cytosol was prepared as follows: the cells were washed twice with normal saline (0.9% NaCl), scraped, and pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in normal saline and sonicated for 45 s on ice using a Branson sonifier at setting 2. The sonicate was then centrifuged at 500,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and the supernatant saved and stored at −80 °C until use. The protein was assayed by the method of Bradford (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) and enzyme assays were conducted within 1 week of the sample preparation. G6PD activity was assayed by spectrophotometric measurement of the rate of appearance of NADPH at 340 nm (17Deutsch J. Bergmeyer H.U. Bergmeyer J. Grabi M. Enzyme I: Oxidoreductases, Transferases. Deerfield Beach, FL1982: 190-197Google Scholar). Glutathione reductase (18Glatzle D. Korner W.F. Christeller S. Wiss O. Int. J. Vitam.

Enzymol. 1978; 46: 383-414PubMed Google Scholar) activities were measured as described. Reduced glutathione (GSH) was measured colorimetrically using a kit from Calbiochem as directed. Cell cytosolic protein (15 μg) from WT and AHR cells was separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane 0.2 μm (Trans-Blot Transfer Medium, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk, exposed to an anti-G6PD antibody, treated with goat anti-rabbit conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and then developed using ECL chemiluminescence kit as directed (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ). Quantitation of the film image was achieved by scanning densitometry. Total RNA was isolated from WT and AHR cells using guanidine isothiocyanate and a cesium chloride gradient as reported previously (23Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar). Total RNA (15 μg) was applied to a denaturing 2.2 m formaldehyde, 1% agarose gel. After transfer onto nylon membrane, the membrane was hybridized at 42 °C overnight with [32P]dCTP-labeled G6PD cDNA probes (24Persico M.G. Viglietto G. Martini G. Toniolo D. Paonessa G. Moscatelli C. Dono R. Vulliamy T. Luzzatto L. D'Urso M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 2511-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Probes were labeled by random priming (25Fairchild C.R. Ivy S.P. Rushmore T. Cowan K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7701-7705Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). A 1.2-kilobase fragment of the human G6PD proximal promoter was amplified with primers chosen using OligoPrimer Analysis (National Biosciences Inc., Plymouth, MN). Primer 1 was 5′-GGACTGTGAACGCTGGTAG-3′ and Primer 2 was 5′-CATCTCATTCCCGACTGTTAG-3′. The amplified product was cloned into vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen Inc., Carlsbad, CA), digested withKpnI and XhoI, and the resulting fragment (−1126 to +76) was ligated into a luciferase reporter vector, pGL3 Basic (Promega, Madison, WI). The insert sequence was confirmed by the dideoxy chain termination DNA sequencing and contained sequences spanning the transcription start site that were previously demonstrated to be necessary for full promoter activity (26Chen E.Y. Cheng A. Lee A. Kuang W.J. Hillier L. Green P. Schlessiner D. Ciccodicola A. D'Urso M. Genomics. 1991; 10: 792-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). For assays of promoter activity, cells were plated at 60,000 cells per well in 24-well plates. After 24 h the cells were transiently transfected with 12.0 μg of the luciferase reporter using LipofectAMINE as directed. To control for transfection efficiency, the cells were co-transfected with 1.0 μg of pβ-Gal control vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) containing β-galactosidase. Luciferase activity was determined using a kit from Promega (Madison, WI) as directed. The activity of β-galactosidase was determined by the method of Rosenthal (27Rosenthal N. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 704-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). WT and AHR200 cells were plated into 6-well plates and grown to confluence. Total RNA was isolated 8, 16, 24, and 48 h after the addition of 5 μg/ml actinomycin D to stop transcription (28Ciolino H.P. Yeh G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35186-35190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), using Trizol as directed. cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA using an Omniscript RT-PCR kit as instructed. Semi-quantitative PCR for G6PD was performed in the presence of 1.5 μCi of [32P]dATP. Hot start was performed by pre-mixing AmpliTaq (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Foster City, CA) with anti-Taq antibody (CLONTECH). Primer sequences for G6PD were from Stratagene and PCR was carried out as directed. The optimum cycle number that fell within the exponential range of response (22 cycles) was used. Following PCR, 5 μl of high-density sample buffer was added to the samples and they were subjected to electrophoresis on a 10% TBE gel in 1 × TBE running buffer. The gel was dried and the results were visualized and quantified on a Bio-Rad GS-363 Molecular Imaging System (Hercules, CA). We developed a series of BP-resistant human breast cancer MCF-7 cells by continuous exposure to BP. The BP concentration which inhibited cell growth by 50% (IC50) in WT, AHR40, AHR100, and AHR200 was 0.6 ± 0.07, 20 ± 0.67, 85 ± 7.3, and 164 ± 6.0 μm, respectively (Fig. 2). The resistant cells are designated for their 40-, 100-, and 200-fold increase in resistance to BP. We found that these cells are cross-resistant to another aryl hydrocarbon, DMBA. The IC50for DMBA in WT, AHR40, AHR100, and AHR200 was 0.4 ± 0.03, 18 ± 0.8, 94 ± 5.0, and 131 ± 12 μm, respectively (Fig. 2). In contrast, the AH-resistant cell lines showed no increased resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs such as doxorubcin, vinblastine, and taxol (data not shown). In addition, the resistant cell lines showed no increase in P-glycoprotein or multidrug resistance protein as determined by Western blot (data not shown). We measured G6PD activity underVmax conditions in cell cytosol and found that the activity of G6PD in WT, AHR40, AHR100, and AHR200 was 41.2 ± 2.65, 85.5 ± 3.96, 126 ± 8.16, and 165 ± 12.2 nmol/min/mg protein, respectively (Fig.3 A). We further examined the enzyme kinetics of G6PD in WT and AHR cells. Results are illustrated in the form of a Hanes-Woolf plot (Fig. 3 B) and reveal an increase in Vmax with increasing NADP+ concentrations, while the Km value is unchanged. In contrast, there was no change in 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activity in the resistant cells (TableI).Table IPhase II enzyme activities in human breast cancer MCF-7 wild type and AHR cellsCellsGST e.u./mgae.u./mg, enzyme unit/mg protein.GST-π ng/mlGlutathione peroxidase k/mgbk/mg, first-order kinetic constant/mg protein.Catalase k/mgQR nm/min/mgGlutathione reductase nm/min/mgcnm/min/mg = nmole/min/mg protein.6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase nm/min/mgWT3.2 ± .12<0.782.1 ± .320.2 ± .06136 ± 2.88.2 ± 1.3931.3 ± 1.02AHR403.7 ± .13<0.784.6 ± .440.3 ± .02128 ± 1.36.9 ± 0.9727.2 ± 2.04AHR1002.9 ± .08<0.783.7 ± .260.4 ± .06293 ± 3.59.0 ± 0.7537.0 ± 1.75AHR2002.4 ± .17<0.784.2 ± .110.3 ± .01342 ± 4.27.6 ± 1.1232.3 ± 1.26a e.u./mg, enzyme unit/mg protein.b k/mg, first-order kinetic constant/mg protein.c nm/min/mg = nmole/min/mg protein. Open table in a new tab The activities of glutathione peroxidase, GST, GST-π, and catalase were not significantly changed in the AHR cell lines compared with the WT (Table I). The level of QR activity was increased in AHR100 and AHR200 cells compared with the WT, but the AHR40 cells did not have any significant increase in QR activity (Table I). The expression of G6PD in the cell lines was examined at the protein and mRNA levels. The amount of G6PD protein, as measured by Western immunoblotting, was increased in resistant cell lines compared with WT (Fig.4). The amount of G6PD mRNA also increased with increasing resistance, as measured by Northern analysis (Fig. 5). The relative levels, as determined by densitometry and normalized to actin mRNA, were 1.0, 2.5, 3.7, and 5.6 in WT, AHR40, AHR100, and AHR200, respectively.Figure 5Relative levels of G6PD mRNA. The amounts of G6PD mRNA expression in WT and AHR cells were determined by Northern analysis. The relative amounts of G6PD mRNA were determined by densitometry and normalized to actin mRNA. This experiment was repeated once with different cell preparations with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) G6PD promoter-driven transcription was examined by transiently transfecting WT and AHR cells with a luciferase reporter vector containing the full-length G6PD promoter. As shown in Fig.6, there was no increase in luciferase transcription in AHR cells when compared with WT. In order to demonstrate the responsiveness of this vector to known inducers of G6PD transcription, we treated transfected WT cells with diamide, a well characterized inducer of G6PD transcription (11Ursini M.V. Parrella A. Rosa G. Salzano S. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous results, diamide caused a 2-fold increase in G6PD transcription (Fig. 6). As an additional positive control, transfected WT cells were deprived of glucose and then refed, a treatment which is known to induce G6PD transcription. This caused an 8-fold increase in G6PD-promoter controlled transcription (data not shown). The stability of G6PD mRNA in the WT and AHR200 cells was determined by an actinomycin D chase experiment using RT-PCR. There was a greater amount of mRNA in the AHR200 cells compared with WT cells at 8, 16, 24, or 48 h following exposure to actinomycin D (Fig.7). GSH levels were measured in the cell lines. There was an increase in GSH with increasing AH resistance (Fig. 8). Environmental carcinogens such as BP exert their deleterious effects in at least two ways: epoxide metabolites generated by Phase 1 enzymes such as cytochrome P450 1A1 are highly electrophilic and bind nucleophilic residues in DNA, forming adducts (29Seo K.Y. Jelinsky S.A. Loechler E.L. Mutat. Res. 2000; 463: 215-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Second, the epoxide can enter quinone/semiquinone redox cycling, generating free radicals which can oxidize DNA (30Joseph P. Jaiswal A.K. Br. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 709-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The end result of both mechanisms is the introduction of specific mutations which may lead to cellular transformation. Cells have developed a number of defense mechanisms to deal with xenobiotics. These include the Phase 2 enzymes, which conjugate AH metabolites, forming relatively inert compounds that are easily excreted. Cells also synthesize glutathione, a cysteine-containing tripeptide ubiquitously found in eukaryotic cells at concentrations of 0.5 to 10 mm. GSH has reducing and nucleophilic properties that make it a key element in cellular protection from oxidative damage. Furthermore, GSH is a cofactor of GST, which is responsible for detoxification of xenobiotics. Regeneration of GSH from oxidized glutathione by glutathione reductase, as well as many of the Phase 2 enzymes such as QR, requires NADPH as a co-factor. The intracellular level of NADPH is therefore a critical factor in carcinogen detoxification. The enzyme that regulates NADPH synthesis, G6PD, is now recognized as an important and highly regulated enzyme (31Kletzien R.F. Harris P.K. Foellmi L.A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Despite the central role of the PPP in supplying NADPH and hence, GSH, for carcinogen detoxification, little is known about the modulation of this pathway by exposure to xenobiotics. We hypothesized that modulation of G6PD is important for detoxification mechanisms because of its role in providing reducing potential for the regeneration of GSH. To test this hypothesis, we developed a series of carcinogen-resistant cells from the carcinogen-sensitive human breast cancer MCF-7 cells. MCF-7 cells have been used extensively as a model for the study of G6PD by our laboratory (32Yeh C.C. Occhipinti S.J. Cowan K.H. Chabner B.A. Myers C.E. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 5994-5999PubMed Google Scholar) and others (33Koren R. Hadari-Naor I. Zuck E. Rotem C. Liberman U.A. Ravid A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1439-1444PubMed Google Scholar, 34Di Monaco M. Pizzini A. Gatto V. Leonardi L. Gallo M. Brignardello E. Boccuzzi G. Br. J. Cancer. 1997; 75: 589-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We examined the following two questions. 1) Do cells modulate G6PD to adapt to carcinogen exposure? 2) How do cells carry out this modulation? We found that the enzymatic activity of G6PD was significantly increased in AH-resistant cells compared with the WT cell, and that this increase in activity was positively correlated with increasing resistance (Fig. 3). To test whether this increase in specific activity was the result of changes in the enzyme/substrate interaction, we performed kinetic analysis by Hanes-Woolf plot. This analysis showed that there was an increase in the Vmax of G6PD in AHR compared with the WT, but no change inKm, indicating that the enzymatic mechanism of action is similar in the different cell lines. It has been previously documented that exogenous chemicals which cause oxidative stress, such as diquot (10Cramer C.T. Cooke S. Ginsberg L.C. Kletzien R.F. Stapleton S.R. Ulrich R.G. J. Biochem. Toxicol. 1995; 10: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) or diamide (11Ursini M.V. Parrella A. Rosa G. Salzano S. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), enhance G6PD activity, but this is the first observation, to our knowledge, of an increase in G6PD activity associated with carcinogen exposure. Because the above result indicates an increase in the amount of G6PD in resistant cells, we examined protein levels by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 4, there was an increase in the enzyme in AHR that was correlated with the increase in AH resistance. This was supported by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 5) which showed an increase in G6PD mRNA correlated with AH resistance. These results clearly demonstrate that the resistant cell lines have an increase in G6PD expression that varies with the level of resistance. Interestingly, there was no change in the level of transcriptional activity of a reporter vector containing the G6PD promoter in AHR cells compared with WT (Fig. 6). Treatments that are known to increase G6PD transcription, such as glucose deprivation/refeeding and diamide, increased transcription in transfected WT cells, demonstrating the appropriate responsiveness of this vector. These results indicate that the increase in G6PD expression that is associated with AH resistance is not the result of an increased rate of G6PD transcription. This leaves the possibility of a post-transcriptional mechanism of modulation. This was examined by treating the WT and AHR200cells with actinomycin D to inhibit transcription. The stability of G6PD mRNA was assessed using RT-PCR (Fig. 7). This experiment showed that the rate of G6PD mRNA degradation was faster in the WT cells than in the AHR200 cells, indicating that the mRNA in the AHR200 cells was more stable. Thus, the increase in G6PD expression in AHR cells is due to a post-transcription stabilization of G6PD mRNA. There is precedent for this type of post-transcriptional control of G6PD expression. Prostko et al. (35Prostko C.R. Fritz R.S. Kletzien R.F. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) found that a high-carbohydrate diet increased G6PD mRNA stability, resulting in an increase in enzyme activity. Other post-transcriptional modes of regulation have also been demonstrated for G6PD expression (14Stabile L.P. Hodge D.L. Klautky S.A. Salati L.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 322: 269-279Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 15Hodge D.L. Salati L.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 36Amir-Ahmady B. Salati L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10514-10523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although mRNA stability plays a major role in the determination of gene expression, the regulation of mRNA stability is poorly understood, and the mechanism which modulates G6PD mRNA stability remains to be studied. Since it is well established that the activity of G6PD is directly linked with the maintenance of GSH levels, we examined the cell lines for GSH. As shown in Fig. 8, there is an increase in GSH levels that corresponds with the increase in AH resistance. This was not due to increases in glutathione reductase activity, which was unchanged in the AHR cell lines (Table I). The increase in G6PD activity therefore has functional significance for carcinogen detoxification. These results do not prove that the increase in G6PD expression is the sole or definitive mechanism responsible for AH resistance. We have examined several other mechanisms which may contribute to resistance. Although there was no significant increase in total GST, GST-π, glutathione peroxidase, or catalase activities in resistant cells, there was an increase in QR activity in the AHR100 and AHR200 cell lines (Table I), although not in the AHR40 cell line, indicating that increased QR may be involved in higher-stage resistance. Furthermore, we 2G. C. Yeh and H. P. Ciolino, unpublished data. and others (37Moore M. Wang X. Lu Y.F. Wormke M. Graig A. Gerlach J.H. Burghardt R. Barhoumi R. Safe S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11751-11759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that BP resistance in vitro is also associated with changes in aryl hydrocarbon receptor activity, resulting in impaired induction of cytochrome P450 1A1, a major AH activating enzyme in these cells. This results in a decrease in AH activation. This suggests that both carcinogen activation and detoxification mechanisms work in concert for cellular defense against carcinogen insult. These results clearly demonstrate that there is an increase in the expression and activity of G6PD in our AHR cells that is correlated with AH resistance, and that this modulation is the result of a post-transcriptional regulation. The major site of AH metabolism and detoxification is the liver, which expresses high levels of G6PD. Although not specifically addressed in the current experiments, similar induction of hepatic G6PD expression and activity upon long-term exposure to AH would result in an increase in the detoxification capacity of the liver and provide an additional level of AH resistance. Thus, modulation of G6PD expression may be an important part of the adaptation of cells to long-term exposure to AH. This is a heretofore unrecognized cellular defense mechanism against carcinogen exposure. We thank Dr. Janice Chou (NICHD, National Institutes of Health) and Dr. M. Graziella Persico (International Institute of Genetics and Biophysics, CNR) for supplying us with the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe for our Northern analysis."

The pol III core contains the α, ε, and θ subunits and provides the polymerase function. The multiprotein DnaX complex recognizes the primer terminus, loads β onto DNA in an ATP-dependent manner, and functions as a communications and organizational node for the various replication and primosomal proteins at the replication fork (1Fay P.J.

The DnaX complex contains the ATPases τ and γ, which are the alternative frameshift products of the dnaX gene, plus the auxiliary subunits δ, δ′, χ, and ψ. The τ subunit, but not the shorter translation product γ, dimerizes the pol III core through interactions between structural domain V of τ and the α subunit to coordinate leading and lagging strand synthesis (6Gao D.

There is also a τ-mediated interaction between holoenzyme and DnaB that is essential for coupling the replicase and the primosomal apparatus at the replication fork (4Kim S. Dallmann H.G.

In the elongation complex, τ protects β2 from removal by exogenous γ complex, increasing the processivity of the replicase (12Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21406-21412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The τ subunit also is a bridge between α and a χ single-stranded DNA-binding protein interaction, strengthening the holoenzyme interactions with the protein that coats the lagging strand at the replication fork (13Glover B.P.

The DnaX-δ′ and DnaX-ψ interactions occur through structural domain III, which is common to both τ and γ (8Gao D. McHenry C.S. J. Biol.

Various forms of the clamp-loading complex have been characterized including a γ complex (γ3δδ′χψ), a τ complex (τ3δδ′χψ), and two different τγ mixed DnaX complexes (τ1γ2δδ′χψ and τ2γ1δδ′χψ) (15Onrust R.

A novel assembly mechanism for the DnaX complex has been discovered recently; free DnaX is a tetramer in equilibrium with a free monomer (KD = 170 nm), but the DnaX4stoichiometry is altered upon δδ′ association, leading to the formation of a DnaX3δδ′ complex (21Pritchard A.E. Dallmann H.G. Glover B.P. McHenry C.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6536-6545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both τ and γ are found co-assembled in purified holoenzyme and in pol III*, a subassembly of holoenzyme that lacks only β (22Hawker J.R.J. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12722-12727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Maki H. Maki S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6570-6578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the assembly mechanism is not well understood. When the 10 subunits of holoenzyme are mixed simultaneously, they rapidly form a nine-subunit assembly containing τ but not γ (15Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Naktinis V. Turner J. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13348-13357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).

Chem. 1982; 257: 2657-2663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was also investigated, but the γ complex and pol III′ did not associate upon mixing (17Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Turner J. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13366-13377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). If the entire complement of DnaX proteins is overexpressed from a single operon, τγ mixed DnaX complexes are formed and can be purified by SP-Sepharose chromatography (21Pritchard A.E. Dallmann H.G. Glover B.P. McHenry C.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6536-6545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, two in vitro protocols have been developed that produce a pol III* that contains both τ and γ in the same complex (17Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Turner J. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13366-13377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In view of the important roles for the DnaX complex in replication and its unusual mechanism of assembly, we investigated the effects of various accessory proteins on the time course of the co-assembly of τ and γ. We hoped to discover the factors required for the assembly of τ and γ into the same complex and to eventually dissect the steps in the assembly pathway. In addition, efficient in vitroassembly of a proper mixed complex will be useful in future studies on the roles of specific proteins and their interactions. We have determined that τγ association proceeds slowly and the presence of the DnaX complex auxiliary proteins impedes this association. We looked at the assembly of τ and γ into pol III* and discovered that pol III core, in the absence of DnaX complex accessory proteins, stimulates co-assembly, suggesting that the holoenzyme assembly pathway proceeds through the initial formation of pol III′. The buffers used were: buffer SP (50 mmTris (pH 7.5), 10% (w/v) glycerol, 5 mm DTT); buffer 25T5 (25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mmDTT); buffer G (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 25 mmNaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 5 mmDTT); buffer SW (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 200 mmNaCl, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 5 mm DTT); and buffer T2 (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 20% (w/v) glycerol, 5 mm DTT). C(O)τ is the τ subunit with a C-terminal fusion peptide that includes a short 13-amino acid biotinylation sequence, a hexahistidine sequence, and a thrombin cleavage site. The activity of C(O)τ is nearly identical to that of τ in holoenzyme reconstitution assays (6Gao D. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4433-4440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A fusion protein-overproducing strain was obtained by transforming the plasmid PA1-C(0)τ (6Gao D. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4433-4440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) into the E. coli B strain AVB101 (hsdRlon11su1A1, purchased from Avidity, Inc., Denver, CO), which also harbors a plasmid, pBirAcm, with an isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside-induciblebirA gene. The E. coli B strain AVB101 was used in hopes of increasing the C(O)τ biotinylation density. Although this expectation was not realized, lower quantities of C(O)τ degradation products were obtained from strain AVB101 compared with strain BL21(DE3) for unknown reasons. Cells were grown at 37 °C in F medium (24Cull M.G. McHenry C.S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 22-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 10 μg/ml chloramphenicol to anA600 nm of 1.0 followed by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside to 1 mm andd-biotin to 50 μm and harvesting 2 h post induction. The cells were lysed in the presence of lysozyme (3 mg/g of cells), 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm benzamidine, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 2 h on ice followed by a 4-min incubation at 37 °C (24Cull M.G. McHenry C.S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 22-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). After lysis, protein was precipitated by adding 0.226 g of ammonium sulfate for each ml of lysate supernatant. The ammonium sulfate pellet was redissolved in sufficient volumes of buffer 25T5 to achieve a conductivity equal to that of buffer SP + 50 mm NaCl and applied to an SP-Sepharose column equilibrated with the latter buffer. After a 1-column volume wash, C(O)τ was eluted with an 8-column volume 50–400 mm NaCl gradient in buffer SP. From 17 g of cells, 11 mg of purified C(O)τ was obtained. SDS-polyacrylamide gels showed a purity of >90%. Purifications of τ and γ (25Dallmann H.G. Thimmig R.L. McHenry C.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20681-20689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) have already been described. The kinetics of association of C(O)τ and γ to form a mixed τγ complex at 15 °C was determined in the presence and absence of various combinations of the DnaX complex accessory proteins, δδ′χψ, and pol III core. With the exception of the pol III core reaction, each association reaction was initiated by the addition of C(O)τ (12.7 μg, 0.17 nmol as monomer, 5.3 μm, for each time point) to a solution pre-equilibrated at 15 °C, containing the γ subunit (16.8 μg, 0.35 nmol as monomer, 11 μm) and, if present, δ (13.2 μg, 0.34 nmol, 11 μm), δ′ (12.4 μg, 0.35 nmol, 11 μm), and χψ (11.2 μg, 0.36 nmol, 11 μm) complexes. For pol III core reactions, C(O)τ (0.17 nmol) and pol III core (0.32 nmol) were incubated first in a volume of 20.4 μl for 10 min at 15 °C followed by the addition of γ (0.35 nmol) to initiate the association reaction. All reactions were adjusted to a final total volume of 32 μl/time point by the addition of buffer G. For each kinetic series a reaction pot was made, and 32-μl volumes were withdrawn at selected time points and then quenched by mixing with a 17-μl volume on ice that contained any missing DnaX complex subunits needed to comprise the complete τγδδ′χψ complex. After a further 2-min incubation on ice, the mixtures were flash-frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C until the streptavidin bead procedure was performed. For each time point, 80 μl of a streptavidin agarose bead slurry containing ∼40 μl of streptavidin agarose beads (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was washed twice with 0.8 ml of buffer SW in an Eppendorf tube by mixing, briefly spinning in a microcentrifuge, and removing the supernatant. Each quenched kinetic reaction aliquot was thawed on ice, adjusted to 200 mm NaCl/0.02% Nonidet P-40, and added to the washed beads on ice. The bead mixture was vortexed for 10 min at 4 °C and spun in a microcentrifuge for 1.5 min, and the supernatant was removed. The remaining unbound protein was removed by adding 0.8 ml of buffer SW, vortexing for 10 min at 4 °C, spinning for 1.5 min in a microcentrifuge, and removing the supernatant. The wash was repeated two more times. Bound protein was eluted from the washed beads by adding 40 μl of 0.09 m Tris (pH 6.8), 15% sucrose, 3% SDS, 90 mm DTT, and .03% bromphenol blue, boiling for 5 min, and briefly spinning. The supernatant was removed and subsequently loaded onto an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (0.75-mm thick, either 7.5–17.5% or 10% acrylamide). After staining for ∼2 h in 0.05% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad), 45% methanol, and 10% acetic acid, the gels were destained overnight in at least two changes of 20% methanol and 5% acetic acid. The amount of C(O)τ that binds to the streptavidin beads (in the absence of auxiliary DnaX subunits) was estimated by using the binding, washing, and elution procedures described in the preceding paragraph followed by gel quantification. 10–30% of the C(O)τ that was applied to the beads was bound. The binding capacity of the beads had not been exceeded, because the total amount of C(O)τ bound increased approximately linearly with increasing amounts of protein applied. At the concentrations used in this bead-binding protocol, more than 90% of C(O)τ exists as a tetramer (21Pritchard A.E. Dallmann H.G. Glover B.P. McHenry C.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6536-6545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because any tetramer with between one and four biotinylated C(O)τ monomers will bind, it can be calculated, assuming a binomial distribution of biotinylated and nonbiotinylated monomers, that 10–30% of total C(O)τ binding to beads corresponds to 3–8% biotinylation of the C(O)τ monomers. Gel scans for quantification were obtained using a Molecular Dynamics laser densitometer. Stain intensities were measured as integrated volumes of boxes drawn around subunits with appropriate background subtraction. The γ/τ stain intensity ratios were converted to molar ratios by using a molecular weight ratio conversion factor. We know from previous studies that for γ/τ ratios, this method is nearly as accurate as having purified subunit standards on the same gel (21Pritchard A.E. Dallmann H.G. Glover B.P. McHenry C.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6536-6545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The τ + γ association kinetics are depicted as the γ/τ molar ratio versus time of incubation. For each kinetic series three controls were included. 1) An untagged control contained all of the DnaX complex subunits (and pol III core if appropriate) except τ was substituted for C(O)τ. 2) A background control contained C(O)τ, δ, δ′, and χψ (and pol III core if appropriate) but not γ. Background stain intensity at the position expected for the γ subunit was measured as a percentage of the C(O)τ stain intensity. This value, which was caused by slight contaminants or degradation products of C(O)τ, ranged from 5 to 10% of the C(O)τ signal and was subtracted (as a percentage of the C(O)τ intensity for a particular time point) from the measured γ subunit stain intensity for each of the time points. 3) A zero-point control was accomplished by adding, on ice, C(O)τ to a preincubated mixture of γ, δ, δ′, and χψ, which comprised the quench. Higher levels than expected of γ associated with C(O)τ were seen in this control (γ/τ molar ratios ranging from 0.08 to 0.18). This did not indicate that the quench was ineffective, because the γ/τ ratio in the presence of δδ′χψ (i.e. the quench conditions) did not increase with time (see below). Variations in the zero-point control such as adding γ to preincubated τδδ′χψ or adding τδδ′χψ to γδδ′χψ also gave similar γ/τ ratios. It is possible that the γ seen associated with τ in this control is a consequence of the streptavidin bead procedure or caused by aggregation by nonspecific binding of C(O)τ and γ proteins. The γ/τ value of the zero point control was subtracted from all time points. For experiments investigating the effect of SP-Sepharose on τγ dissociation, τ (146 μg, 2.0 nmol as monomer) was incubated with γ (196 μg, 4.1 nmol) in a volume of 373 μl (achieved by adding buffer G) for 1.5 h at 15 °C and then transferred to ice. After the mixed τγ complex formation, auxiliary DnaX complex subunits, if present in the particular experiment, were added: δ (83 μg, 2.1 nmol), δ′ (79 μg, 2.1 nmol), and χψ (131 μg, 4.1 nmol). The conductivity of the resulting solution was adjusted to the equivalent of ∼35 mm NaCl by the addition of buffer 25T5 and then injected onto a 1-ml HiTrap SP-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been attached to an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech FPLC apparatus and equilibrated with buffer T2 + 20 mm NaCl. Protein was eluted with a 20-ml 20–300 mm NaCl gradient in buffer T2. The two DnaX proteins, τ and γ, unassociated with other subunits of holoenzyme, exist as tetramers in equilibrium with monomers. If purified τ and γ are mixed they can associate to form a mixed tetramer, a reaction that is blocked by the presence of the DnaX complex auxiliary proteins, δ, δ′, χ, and ψ (17Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Turner J. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13366-13377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Here, we refer to the co-assembly of τ and γ as an exchange of DnaX protomers in complexes initially homomeric in DnaX. To study the parameters affecting these exchange reactions, we developed an assay that takes advantage of a biotin tag near the C terminus of C(O)τ, a τ fusion protein. γ was allowed to exchange into complexes with C(O)τ under varying experimental conditions, the exchange reaction was quenched at various time points by forming a complete DnaX complex (DnaX3δδ′χψ), and complexes containing γ associated with C(O)τ were purified away from unassociated γ by the binding of C(O)τ to streptavidin beads. The purified complexes were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the γ/τ molar ratios were determined. An example of the procedure, the τγ exchange in the presence of δ′ (Fig.1), shows that a τγ mixed DnaX complex did form, and the relative amount of γ increased with time. However, when χψ as well as δ′ were present, the amount of γ did not increase with time (Fig. 1 B). Thus, the association of C(O)τ and γ was blocked in the presence of δ′ plus χψ, which is consistent with an earlier study showing that δδ′χψ prevented co-assembly (17Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Turner J. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13366-13377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In each series of experiments a control, in which wild-type τ was substituted for the tagged τ, showed that the bead wash procedure removed nonbiotinylated proteins that were not associated with C(O)τ (untagged τ, Fig. 1 B). Another control, lacking only γ, was used to subtract any background signal in the gel (no γ lane, Fig. 1 B) caused by for example minor contaminants migrating at the γ position. In the zero point control (Zero Pt lane, Fig. 1 B), C(O)τ was added to a reaction at 0 °C that was quenched already because it contained γ preincubated with δδ′χψ. The γ/τ molar ratio for zero-point control was subtracted from all of the experimental time points. When C(O)τ was added to a preformed complex of γ3δδ′χψ maintained at 15 °C, there was no increase in the γ/τ ratio over time (Fig.2 A); δδ′χψ blocked the association of C(O)τ and γ, confirming an earlier study (17Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Turner J. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13366-13377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). After 120 min the γ/τ ratio was zero after the background control, and zero-point corrections were applied. In contrast, when C(O)τ and γ were allowed to exchange in the absence of accessory proteins, the average γ/τ ratio was 1.0 after 120 min. This result demonstrates the effectiveness of the quench used in the assay. Two other combinations of subunits, δδ′ and δ′χψ, were nearly as effective in suppressing the association of C(O)τ and γ with γ/τ ratios of 0.17 and 0.02, respectively, after 120 min. All the accessory protein combinations that exhibited the maximal kinetic inhibition contain δ′ (Fig. 2 A). Other combinations of subunits, when allowed to form complexes with γ, slowed but did not abrogate the association of C(O)τ and γ into the same complex (Fig. 2 B). The curves for the C(O)τ plus γχψ or γδ′ complexes were overlapping and revealed slightly slower kinetics than the C(O)τ plus γ only curve. After 80 min the average γ/τ ratio was 1.0 with no added accessory proteins, 0.7 in the presence of χψ, and 0.66 in the presence of δ′. We did not observe a significant effect on the τγ association kinetics when only δ was added to the reaction (data not shown). Similarly, the curve for the association of C(O)τ and γ in the presence of χψ was not altered when δ was also included (data not shown). Thus, any accessory protein that binds directly to DnaX in the complex retards rather than accelerates the association τ and γ. The magnitude of the inhibition varies for the different combinations of proteins tested. The effect of another τ-binding protein, pol III core, on the assembly of τ and γ into pol III* was also examined. Because pol III core binds to τ but not to γ, we first incubated τ with a 2-fold molar excess of pol III core for 10 min before adding γ to initiate the exchange reaction. The reactions were quenched at various times by the addition of δδ′χψ. Pol III core accelerated the τγ exchange reaction approximately 3-fold compared with the reaction with only τ and γ present (Fig. 2 C). After only 2 min, the γ/τ ratio was increased from 0.15 to 0.40. This rate increase is in marked contrast to the inhibitory effects of the other τ-binding protein. The actual measured rate increase depends on solution conditions and possibly the presence of the C-terminal tag on C(O)τ. It is known that the KD for the α-C(O)τ association is in the nm range compared with a pm range for the interaction of α with the N-terminal fusion τ (6Gao D. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4433-4440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), but because our experiments were conducted in the μm range, it is unlikely that the decreased α-τ affinity caused by the C-terminal tag affected the results. It should be noted that we did not observe γ associated with pol III′ in the absence of added δδ′ and χψ (data not shown). However, δδ′ and χψ were not responsible for stimulating the association kinetics, only for trapping an intermediate, because if δ, δ′, χ, and ψ were present along with pol III′ when γ and τ were mixed, no γ was found associated with τ. This indicates that γ can interact with pol III′ in a time-dependent reaction, but the association is weak and does not survive the streptavidin bead-washing procedure without forming a stable DnaX complex. It is clear from the streptavidin bead assay with C(O)τ and from previous work (17Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Turner J. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13366-13377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) that τ and γ by themselves can associate in vitroto form a heterologous DnaX oligomer. Yet it has also been demonstrated that a mixture of τ and γ, even if obtained by co-expression from a plasmid, elute from S-Sepharose as separate τ and γ peaks with no evidence of a mixed τγ complex (25Dallmann H.G. Thimmig R.L. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29555-29562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This enigma was investigated in a series of SP-Sepharose chromatography experiments (Fig. 3). To form a τγ mixed complex, τ was allowed to associate with a 2-fold molar excess of γ at 15 °C for 1.5 h, which is enough time to form an equilibrated mixed complex based on our streptavidin bead experiments. The resulting mixture was then chromatographed on a 1-ml SP-Sepharose column that was developed with a 20-ml 20–300 mm NaCl gradient run slowly (0.02 ml/min). The two DnaX proteins eluted separately as γ and τ peaks at salt concentrations equivalent to ∼100 and 210 mm NaCl, respectively. There was no evidence of any mixed τγ oligomers confirming our earlier observation (25Dallmann H.G. Thimmig R.L. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29555-29562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, when the SP-Sepharose column gradient was developed rapidly (0.5 ml/min), in addition to the γ peak several overlapping peaks comprising τγ mixed complexes were observed eluting between 155 and 190 mm NaCl. The τ/γ ratio in the eluted complex increased with increasing salt concentration. Although the mixed complex species were not purified to homogeneity for characterization, we expect that there were three species present corresponding to τ1γ3, τ2γ2, and τ3γ1. The SP-Sepharose method therefore promotes the dissociation of τγ mixed oligomers, a process that was completed if the proteins were eluted at a slow flow rate but not at the faster flow rate. Can accessory DnaX complex subunits stabilize the τγ mixed complex subassemblies and prevent dissociation on SP-Sepharose? After the association of τ and γ at 15 °C for 1.5 h, three combinations (δδ′χψ, δδ′, or χψ) of the auxiliary proteins in separate experiments were added to the τγ mixture, and the resulting subassemblies were chromatographed at the slow rate of 0.02 ml/min (Fig. 3). In all three experiments, we observed subassemblies containing both τ and γ eluting between 170 and 210 mm NaCl. Therefore, δδ′χψ, δδ′, or χψ can stabilize τγ mixed oligomers against dissociation on the column. However, δδ′ was more effective than χψ in stabilizing mixed τγ complexes (compare the bottom panel of Fig. 3 with the two panels above it). We have shown that various combinations of the auxiliary DnaX complex proteins, δ, δ′, χ, and ψ, slow the co-assembly of τ and γ into the same complex; τ and γ exchange into the same complexes faster in the absence of these proteins. This result implies that if the holoenzyme assembly pathway is through the DnaX complex, the formation of a τγ mixed oligomer occurs before any other auxiliary protein enters the complex. Because τ and γ are translated from the same RNA, co-translational formation of a mixed DnaX oligomer before the accessory proteins become associated is likely. Any DnaX complex accessory protein that is known to bind to DnaX slows the exchange of γ into τ-containing complexes. The accessory proteins interact with DnaX through its domain III (8Gao D. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4447-4453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), where the DnaX oligomerization domain is also located. 2Glover, B. P., Pritchard, A. E., and McHenry, C. S. (July 19, 2001) J. Biol. Chem.10.1074/jbc.M103719200. All the auxiliary protein combinations that prevent the exchange of γ and τ into the same complex include δ′. Although δ′, which binds very weakly to DnaX by itself, is an ineffective inhibitor, all agents that synergistically increase the apparent affinity of δ′ for DnaX (δ and/or χψ) enhance the efficacy of δ′-mediated inhibition. We know that the binding of δδ′ promotes a DnaX4 to DnaX3δδ′ transition, an event that may tighten DnaX-DnaX interactions precluding exchange. For the association of τ and γ in the absence of any other proteins, the C(O)τ and γ concentrations are 5.3 and 11 μm, respectively, and therefore, from theKD of 170 nm (21Pritchard A.E. Dallmann H.G. Glover B.P. McHenry C.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6536-6545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), ∼7 and 4% of the two DnaX proteins, respectively, exist in a monomeric rather than a tetrameric state. The association of τ and γ in vitrocould occur hypothetically via either oligomeric state. In contrast to the DnaX accessory proteins, pol III core stimulates the co-assembly of τ and γ into the same complex; τ incubated with pol III core and then mixed with γ co-assembles faster than τ and γ incubated alone. This result suggests a pathway for the formation of pol III* in the cell via pol III′ (τ2 (pol III core)2). We know from previous work that our protocol used in the kinetic analysis, incubating C(O)τ with a 2-fold molar excess of pol III core, reconstitutes pol III′ in vitro (11Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19833-19841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A pathway via pol III′ is particularly attractive, because the holoenzyme replicase almost certainly contains two τs and one γ, whereas free DnaX, unassociated with any accessory protein, is a tetramer in equilibrium with a free monomer (21Pritchard A.E. Dallmann H.G. Glover B.P. McHenry C.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6536-6545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pol III core may stimulate τγ co-assembly by dissociating the DnaX tetramer, a potential kinetic barrier in the assembly pathway (Fig. 4). The fact that pol III′ mixed with γ complex is a dead end in the assembly pathway (17Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Turner J. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13366-13377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) is because of the stability of the γ3δδ′χψ complex. Based on our observations and knowledge of the mechanism of DnaX synthesis, we favor a model in which DnaX forms heterologous τγ oligomers by co-translational assembly from the same DnaX mRNA (Fig. 4). High local concentrations of DnaX should facilitate rapid interaction. Then, pol III is proposed to bind to τ-containing complexes, with those containing two or more τs being favored in the formation of pol III′. Monomeric γ in equilibrium with DnaX tetramers could then associate with pol III′ weakly, forming a heterologous intermediate. This unstable pol III′-γ intermediate is then proposed to associate with δδ′ and χψ, which stabilize DnaX-DnaX interactions and favor the formation of stabile pol III* (Fig. 4)."

Cell surface expression of Pactolus is dramatically increased following activation of bone marrow neutrophils with known agonists, and cross-linking of cell surface Pactolus, suggesting the bulk of the protein is in intracellular stores. The mature protein is found in two forms depending upon the extent of N-linked glycosylation. There is no evidence to suggest that Pactolus requires an associated α chain for expression. In some mouse strains, a truncated form of the protein is predicted based upon alternative splicing: this form, however, is unstable and rapidly degraded after synthesis. Differences in the quantities of these Pactolus mRNA isoforms have defined two alleles. BALB/c and C3H/HeJ mice possess allele B and preferentially express the truncated, unstable product, whereas C57BL/6 mice possess allele A and only produce the membrane-bound form. Sequence analysis has shown the difference between these two alleles is due to a single base pair difference at the splice acceptor site for the truncated product. The increased expression of the membrane form of Pactolus by granulocytes of C57BL/6 mice suggests a compensatory adhesion function that is reduced in cells from the low producing strains.

Garrison S. Weis J.J. Weis J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8711-8718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Pactolus was expressed in those cells maintained in stem cell factor, but lost when cells were grown in interleukin-3. In the mature animal, the tissue of highest expression was the bone marrow. The Pactolus gene encodes, via alternative splicing, two distinct isoforms of products that share homology with the β-integrins, primarily β2 and β7. The full-length form, dubbed Pac A, resides on the membrane as a class I type glycoprotein (1Chen Y. Garrison S. Weis J.J. Weis J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8711-8718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The truncated form, Pac B, lacks transmembrane and cytoplasmic sequences and, if stable, is predicted to be a soluble and/or secreted form. These differing transcripts are due to an alternative splicing event within exon 13 of the gene. A third form of Pactolus transcript, Pac C, which also predicts a truncated protein, is also due to alternative splicing near this exon; however, it represents only a minor constituent of Pactolus transcripts in the mature animal (2Margraf R.L. Chen Y. Garrison S. Weis J.J. Weis J.H. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 1075-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Pactolus has been referred to as β-integrin-like due to the lack of conservation within the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS)1 domain that is maintained in the integrin subunits (3Humphries M.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 632-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Pactolus has a point mutation in the critical DXSXS motif required for a functional MIDAS domain and has an apparent deletion of 28 amino acids immediately carboxyl-terminal to this site (1Chen Y. Garrison S. Weis J.J. Weis J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8711-8718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Mutations within the MIDAS domains of other integrin subunits abrogates heterodimer formation and ligand recognition (4Bajt M.L. Loftus J.C. J. Biol.

Immunoprecipitation analyses of Pactolus have not identified an α partner chain even when such experiments were performed under conditions that maintained other α/β-integrin pairs (1Chen Y. Garrison S. Weis J.J. Weis J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8711-8718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The high degree of sequence homology between Pactolus and the β-integrins is evident in the extracellular domains; however, the cytoplasmic region of the Pactolus protein does not possess similar sequences (9Wilson R.W. O'Brien W.E. Beaudet A.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5397Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Exon/intron mapping of the Pactolus gene suggests Pactolus and β2-integrin arose from a common precursor even though they now reside on different mouse chromosomes (2Margraf R.L. Chen Y. Garrison S. Weis J.J. Weis J.H. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 1075-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In this article we report our investigations pertaining to the genetics and biology of the production of the truncated and full-length Pactolus products. Using a variety of anti-Pactolus antisera, we demonstrate that the maturing and mature neutrophil is the major cell type that expresses Pactolus. We show that the full-length Pactolus product is stably expressed on the cell surface and undergoes extensiveN-linked glycosylation, whereas the truncated Pactolus product is unstable and rapidly degraded immediately after synthesis. Cross-linking of cell surface Pactolus leads to neutrophil activation and the rapid mobilization of intracellular stores of Pactolus to the cell surface. Finally, a number of mouse strains have been analyzed and two distinct Pactolus alleles have been found. These alleles appear to be directly responsible for the quantities of Pactolus transcript (and protein) isoforms found in selected strains; these differences are due to single nucleotide alteration in a splice acceptor site of the truncated product. Inbred mice (BALB/c, C57BL/6, C3H/HeJ) and outbred mice (Swiss NIH) were obtained from NCI, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD). Tissues were isolated from adults (greater than 10 weeks of age) or immature animals (10 days). Bone marrow cells were obtained by flushing femurs with RPMI without fetal calf serum. Activation of purified bone marrow cells was done using 20 ng/ml PMA for FACS analysis and 100 ng/ml PMA for degranulation assays. Cells were activated with the Bac Pac antiserum at a 1:500 dilution of that serum (or the pre-immune control). The extracellular Pactolus coding sequence (minus the Pactolus signal sequence and missing those sequences encoding the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains) was PCR-amplified with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, San Diego, CA) and inserted within the Baculovirus cloning vector pAcGP67B at the EcoRI site (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). This vector supplies the signal sequence for membrane insertion and secretion into the supernatant, and adds the 6-His tag sequence to the carboxyl terminus of the protein. Sf9 cells were transfected with the Pactolus expression plasmid and BaculoGold, the linear recombination substrate to generate a stable line of cells producing the recombinant baculovirus. Virus supernatants were used to infect 1.8 × 107 cells. Supernatants were collected 6 days after infection. After overnight dialysis against PBS, pH 8.0, the supernatants were brought up to 20 mm imidazole. They were then incubated for 60 min with 2 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid slurry (Qiagen). After the incubation, the mixture was bound to a column, washed two times with 10 ml of wash solution (1× PBS, pH 8.0, and 20 mm imidazole), and protein eluted in 1-ml aliquots using elution buffer (1× PBS, pH 8.0, and 500 mmimidazole). Two rabbits were injected with the purified Bac Pac protein (5 μg/animal). Although both animals responded to the immunization, the highest titer antiserum from one of the animals was used for experimentation purposes. The antiserum was defined to be specific for Pactolus based upon its FACS, Western blot, and immunoprecipitation analyses (detailed in the present report). Lewis rats were immunized with the Pactolus recombinant protein. Rat sera were tested until Pactolus-specific antibodies were detected. Splenic cells were disassociated from the spleen, washed, and counted. Cells (2.8 × 107) were incubated with equal amounts of SP2/0 cells. Splenocytes and SP2/0 cells were fused over 1 min using 30% polyethylene glycol. Cells were then centrifuged and plated in complete media (RPMI 1640, 10% penicillin/streptomycin, 10%l-glutamine, 10% nonessential amino acids, 10% fetal calf serum, and 20 μg/ml insulin) over 10 96-well plates. 24 h after fusion, cells were incubated in complete media with 1× HAT. Cells were fed every 3 days. The supernatants from every well were then screened for a Pactolus-specific antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with the His-tagged Bac Pac protein. Positive wells were diluted down serially to obtain a single cell in a single well. The B10 anti-Pactolus monoclonal antibody recognizes the Pactolus protein in denaturing (RIPA solution; see below) immunoprecipitations but does not recognize the protein via FACS or Western blot analyses. RNA transcription was performed with an RNA transcription kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Briefly, 1 μg of template DNA was incubated with 5 μl of 5× transcription buffer, 4 μl of 10 mm rNTP, 1 μl of 0.75m dithiothreitol, 10 units of T7 RNA polymerase, and water to a final volume of 25 μl. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The RNA was phenol/chloroform-extracted and precipitated in ethanol. The translation of the purified RNA was performed with a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, 2 μg of template RNA was incubated with 35 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate, 1 μl of 1 mm methionine minus amino acid mix, 15 mCi/ml [35S]methionine, and water to a final volume of 50 μl. The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 90 min. Samples were immunoprecipitated and visualized as described under immunoprecipitation. Total RNA was isolated using CsCl guanidine (10Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar). RNA was resuspended in water and quantified byA 260 absorbance. cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of RNA, 10 μl of 5× first strand buffer, 5 μl of 5 mm dNTP, 5 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 2 μl of 1.25 mm random primers (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 μl of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, and water to final volume of 50 μl. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. 2 μl of DNase-free RNase (1 mg/ml) was added, and the reaction incubated for an additional 5 min followed by cDNA isolation via ethanol precipitation. PCR using radioactive detection was performed with 10-μl reactions containing 200 ng of cDNA, 70 pm amounts of each primer, 0.72 unit of Ampli-Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.), 0.8 mm dNTP, 1× Taq buffer (50 mm TriS, pH 8.3, 3 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, and 500 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), and 2.5 μCi of [32P]dCTP. Samples were loaded into capillary tubes and incubated in an air thermocycler (Idaho Technology, Idaho Falls, ID) for denaturing at 94 °C for 1 s, for annealing at 60 °C for 1 s, and for extension at 72 °C for 3 s (11Tan S.S. Weis J.H. Genome Res. 1992; 2: 137-143Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This cycle was repeated 14 times for amplification of β-actin transcripts and 23 times for amplification of Pactolus transcripts. After amplification, 10 μl of stop solution (U. S. Biochemical Corp) was added, and 5 μl was resolved in a 6% acrylamide sequencing gel for autoradiography. Gene-specific oligonucleotides (which span an intron) were: β-actin, 62GTA ACA ATG CCA TGT TCA AT and339CTC CAT CGT GGG CCG CTC TAG; Pactolus,827TGT ACT TCC TGA TGG GCC TC, 828TGT ACT TCC TGA TGG GCC TC, 837CGA GTG CGA CAA TGT CAA CTG, and848TAG TAC TCG GAG CAG CGA TGG. Bone marrow cells were harvested from mice, and red blood cells were lysed with red blood cell lysis solution (0.15 m NH4Cl, 1.0 mmKHCO3, and 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2) for 4 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed in methionine- and serum-free RPMI two times, incubated for 1 h in methionine- and serum-free RPMI, then labeled for 1 h with 0.5 mCi/ml [35S]methionine. Chase after labeling was for 1–6 h with normal serum/media. Cells were then centrifuged and lysed in RIPA solution (50 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and complete TM (Mini protease inhibitor mixture tablet; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 12 min. Cell lysates were collected and precleared by incubating with pre-immune rabbit serum and 10 mg of protein A-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C. The lysates were then precleared two times with 12.5 mg of protein G-Sepharose to remove native labeled IgG. The supernatants were then incubated with either polyclonal rabbit antiserum against the Bac Pac extracellular protein or the cytoplasmic tail sequence. The protein antibody complex was then absorbed with protein A-Sepharose for 30 min at 4 °C. After absorption the Sepharose beads were washed five times: one time with 1 m NaCl and RIPA, two times with RIPA buffer, and twice with a final wash solution (50 mmNaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA). The samples were then boiled under reducing (+ dithiothreitol) or non-reducing (− dithiothreitol) 2× sample buffer (4× Tris/SDS, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, ± 0.2 m dithiothreitol, 0.012% bromphenol blue) for 5 min before they were loaded on to an 8% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis the gel was treated with Coomassie stain for 15 min, destain solution (40% methanol and 10% acetic acid) for 15 min, and Amplify solution (Amersham Life Sciences) for 20 min. Gel was then dried and placed overnight on Kodak X-Omat-AR film. Deglycosylation enzymes were purchased from Glyko (Novato, CA) unless otherwise stated: NANase III, specific for α2–3,6,8,9 N-acetylneuraminic acid; sialadase, specific for α2–3,6,8 N-acetylneuraminic acid;N-glycanase, specific for β-aspartyl-glycosylamine bond at asparagine residue; and endoglycosidase H (Endo H; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), cleavage between the GlcNAc residues of the chitobiose unit of N-glycans linked to asparagine. The glycoproteins were first immunoprecipitated with the B10 Pactolus monoclonal antibody, and the precipitates were incubated with the appropriate enzyme using standard protocols and buffers supplied by Glyko. Endo H cleavage was performed by first placing the pellet in 0.1m 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% SDS and then heat-denaturing for 5 min at 90 °C. Sample was centrifuged, and the supernatant was removed and incubated in cleavage buffer (75 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5, 0.05% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 unit/ml Endo H) overnight at 37 °C. SDS-PAGE was then performed on all samples followed by Western analysis. SDS-PAGE was performed on immunopreciptitation samples under reducing conditions. After electrophoresis PVDF membrane (polyvinylidene fluoride, Immobilon-P, Millipore) was prepared following the company's protocol, and the proteins were transferred for 1.25 h at 30 V. After transfer, the membrane was soaked in 100% methanol for 20 s and then dried for 20 min. Membrane was then placed in blocking solution (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5% milk) for 15 min and incubated with 1:1000 dilution of the anti-Pactolus Bac Pac polyclonal antibody for 1 h. Membrane was then washed twice (10 min each wash) in Tris-buffered saline-Tween (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20). Membrane was then placed in blocking buffer containing 1:5000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit HRP (Bio-Rad) for 30 min. Membranes were again washed twice (10 min each wash) in Tris-buffered saline-Tween and then incubated for 5 min with SuperSignal® chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) and visualized on blue x-ray film. The Western blot performed using avidin-HRP used blocking solution consisting of PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin followed by washes in PBS-Tween. Mouse bone marrow cells were obtained from adult or immature animals. Red blood cells were lysed as described previously. 2 × 106 cells were used for each staining reaction. Peritoneal neutrophils were obtained by injection of 1 ml of a 1% solution of oyster glycogen into the peritoneal cavity of mice, followed by aspiration of the cavity 16 h later. Cells were collected, red blood cells lysed, and the resulting cells analyzed by FACS. The rabbit anti-Bac Pac was detected using a FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig antibody (Cappel). Antibodies specific for Gr-1(clone RB6–8C5), B220 (clone RA3–6B2), and Mac-1 (clone M1/70) were obtained from the University of Utah Stem Cell core facility and were directly conjugated with phycoerythrin (PE). We previously documented the expression of the full-length, transmembrane form of Pactolus on adult bone marrow cells using antisera generated against the cytoplasmic region (anti-CT) (1Chen Y. Garrison S. Weis J.J. Weis J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8711-8718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To generate Pactolus-specific antisera, the extracellular portion of the full-length form (excluding the signal sequence, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains of Pactolus) was inserted into the Baculovirus vector pAcGP67B. The Baculovirus-derived Pactolus protein (termed Bac Pac) was used to generate a polyclonal rabbit antiserum (Bac Pac antiserum) (Fig.1 A). This antiserum can detect the Pactolus gene product by immunoprecipitation, Western blot, and FACS analysis (see below). The Baculovirus-derived Pactolus protein was also used to create a monoclonal antibody (see below). The anti-Pactolus Bac Pac polyclonal antiserum was tested for recognition of the Pactolus protein using in vitrotranscription and translation. The open reading frame of the Pac A transcript was placed in a T7 promoter expression plasmid. The coding sequence was truncated by digestion of the plasmid with single cutting enzymes SmaI (which would be predicted to encode a truncated protein of M r 62,000) and HpaI (which would be expected to encode a truncated protein ofM r 41,000) (Fig. 1 B). The full-length Pactolus peptide sequence encodes a protein ofM r 81,000. Translation and immunoprecipitation of these truncated proteins indicated that the polyclonal Bac Pac antiserum recognizes epitopes present in the HpaI- andSmaI-generated products. Therefore the Bac Pac antiserum should be functional for the detection of both the Pac A (full-length) and Pac B (truncated) protein products. The Bac Pac antiserum was then tested for its ability to recognize Pactolus expressed on the surface of cells. Previously we had determined bone marrow samples expressed the highest level of Pactolus transcripts (1Chen Y. Garrison S. Weis J.J. Weis J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8711-8718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Therefore, we obtained bone marrow from 10-day-old and 10-week-old C57BL/6, C3H/HeJ, and BALB/c mice and analyzed by FACS using Bac Pac antiserum with pre-immune serum as control. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the Bac Pac antiserum specifically stained ∼50% of the bone marrow cells from the adult and juvenile C57BL/6 mouse (M1) marrow. The marrow from the C3H/HeJ and BALB/c mice demonstrated a slight positive shift regardless of age. The depressed levels of Pactolus protein on the surface of the BALB/c and C3H/HeJ bone marrow cells, compared with the C57BL/6 cells, suggested either 1) there are fewer Pactolus transcripts in the C3H/HeJ and BALB/c cells or 2) the production of the spliced isoform of Pactolus to produce the full-length, transmembrane form of the protein is decreased in the BALB/c and C3H/HeJ cells compared with those of the C57BL/6 animal. cDNA was prepared from RNA isolated from total bone marrow cells obtained from these mice and analyzed, via semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR, for either total Pactolus transcripts or those forms that, through alternative splicing, produce either the full-length, transmembrane protein or the truncated form. For the former assessment oligonucleotides were used that span a region of the gene present in all Pactolus transcripts, and for the latter oligonucleotides that span the alternatively spliced junction were used. The C57BL/6 sample appeared to possess only slightly more total Pactolus transcripts than the BALB/c samples (Fig. 2 B). In the C57BL/6 sample, the only Pactolus transcript was that encoding the transmembrane, Pac A form whereas the BALB/c cells were highly enriched for transcripts encoding the Pac B, truncated form. Since the truncated form of Pactolus does not encode a transmembrane-spanning region for cell surface localization, this protein must be degraded, stored within the cell, or secreted (see below). This difference in transcript profile between the C57BL/6 and the other strains could easily account for the difference in cell surface staining intensity for Pactolus. Major populations of cells in the marrow include B cell and granulocyte lineages that can be distinguished with monoclonal antibodies specific for B220 and Gr-1, respectively (12Hathcock K.S. Hirano H. Murakami S. Hodes R.J. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2286-2294PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hestdal K. Ruscetti F.W. Ihle J.N. Jacobsen S.E. Dubois C.M. Kopp W.C. Longo D.L. Keller J.R. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 22-28PubMed Google Scholar). In order to determine the lineage of cells that express Pactolus, bone marrow cells from C57BL/6, C3H/HeJ, and BALB/c mice were analyzed by two-color FACS analysis with anti-Gr-1, anti-B220, and anti-Mac-1 (14Springer T. Galfre G. Secher D.S. Milstein C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1979; 9: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). Shown in Fig.3 A, cells from the C57BL/6 strain that expressed Pactolus also possessed the Gr-1 marker and did not express B220. Pactolus-positive cells also did not stain with CD19 (15Tedder T.F. Zhou L.J. Engel P. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 437-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) (data not shown). These results indicated that cells of the granulocytic, but not lymphocytic, lineage express Pactolus. Mac-1 expression indicated that there is a subset of cells within the marrow that stain brightly for both Mac-1 and Pactolus, another that only stains for Mac-1, and a third subset that is not recognized by either antibody. These data also demonstrate that the Bac Pac antiserum does not cross react with the β2-integrin subunit, which is part of the Mac-1 complex. The analysis of bone marrow cells from the C3H/HeJ and BALB/c strains demonstrated only slight staining of Pactolus on the Gr-1 subset, as expected from the transcript data described above. Bone marrow was further analyzed by FACS Vantage cell sorting using the Bac Pac antiserum to fractionate the marrow (Fig. 3 B). Two populations (positive and negative for Pactolus staining) were collected, spun onto glass coverslips, and analyzed by Wright stain. The cells found within the negative population were heterogeneous but included a large percentage of immature B lymphocytes. The majority of cells in this population stained with B220 (see Fig. 3 A). Alternatively, the Pactolus-positive subset was highly enriched for cells of the neutrophil lineage. Cells representing each stage of neutrophil development were apparent in this stain. Gr-1-positive cells in the bone marrow express Pactolus. A key question was whether Pactolus is preferentially expressed in the bone marrow or if Gr-1-positive cells (primarily neutrophils) still express Pactolus once they enter the periphery of the animal. The anti-Pactolus Bac Pac antiserum was used with two-color staining, using anti-Gr-1, to analyze total splenocytes from C57BL/6 animals. As shown in Fig.4 A, only a small percentage of cells in the spleen stain brightly with Gr-1 (R2). Of these, virtually all possess Pactolus (R3). Again, these data demonstrate that the Bac Pac antiserum does not react with the β2-integrin, which is expressed on splenic T and B cells. To test for Pactolus expression by mature neutrophils in the periphery, oyster glycogen was injected into the peritoneal cavity to recruit neutrophils (16Mulligan M.S. Lentsch A.B. Ward P.A. Inflammation. 1998; 22: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). After 16 h, aspirated cells from the peritoneal cavity are highly enriched for neutrophils. We performed such a strategy using C57BL/6, BALB/c, and C3H/HeJ mice and analyzed the resulting cells for the co-expression of Pactolus and Gr-1 (Fig.4 B). In the C57BL/6 sample, all of the peritoneal cells that stained for Gr-1 also expressed Pactolus. As expected, the same subset of Gr-1-positive cells in the BALB/c and C3H/HeJ stained only minimally for Pactolus. These data indicate that the primary cell of the mouse that expresses Pactolus is the maturing and mature neutrophil, and that the mouse strain differences in Pactolus cell surface expression identified for the bone marrow granulocytes were recapitulated in peripheral neutrophils. The Pactolus gene encodes two primary transcripts that utilize alternative splicing at exon 13 to generate the full-length form, Pac A, or a truncated form, Pac B (1Chen Y. Garrison S. Weis J.J. Weis J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8711-8718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 2Margraf R.L. Chen Y. Garrison S. Weis J.J. Weis J.H. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 1075-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The Pac B transcript predicts a primary protein ofM r 55,000, whereas the full-length form predicts a primary protein of M r 81,000. The reactivity of the Bac Pac antiserum with the in vitrotranscription/translation products suggests it should detect both of these Pactolus products. Mouse bone marrow cells from C57BL/6 mice were labeled with [35S]Met and chased with cold methionine for different periods of time. Samples were immunoprecipitated with pre-immune serum, the Bac Pac antiserum, and the antiserum raised against the Pactolus cytoplasmic tail sequence (1Chen Y. Garrison S. Weis J.J. Weis J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8711-8718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Both the cell pellet and the supernatant were analyzed for Pactolus protein products (Fig. 5 A). At the 0 chase time (left panel), the M r98,000 mature Pactolus product was observed with the Bac Pac and cytoplasmic region antisera. After the 6-h label, a second diffuse band of M r ∼130,000 was evident in addition to theM r 98,000 protein, suggesting that the smaller protein had been further modified during the time course of the labeling. We have never been able to fully “chase” theM r 98,000 form into theM r 130,00 form, suggesting that a portion of the Pactolus product does not bear this increased modification. TheM r 98,000 form is also the size of the full-length Pactolus protein expressed on the surface of Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with an expression construct encoding the full-length Pactolus product (data not shown). The same type of analysis was carried out with bone marrow cells obtained from BALB/c mice. Cells were labeled with [35S]Met and chased with cold methionine for 0 and 6 h. Lysates and cell supernatants were immunoprecipitated with the Bac Pac and pre-immune antisera. As shown in Fig. 5 B, neither the full-length or truncated Pactolus product was evident. Less than 10% of the Pactolus transcripts from the BALB/c cells encode the full-length Pac A product and since we can only barely detect Pactolus expression on the surface of BALB/c bone marrow neutrophils by FACS analysis, it is not surprising that we do not readily observe theM r 98,000 protein. However, the truncated Pac B product should be evident in either the supernatant as a secreted product or within a storage compartment of the BALB/c cells. Since the level of total Pactolus transcripts between t"
