https://openalex.org/W2130790725,"In this paper we present the first mathematical analysis of the protein interaction network found in the yeast, S. cerevisiae. We show that, (a) the identified protein network display a characteristic scale-free topology that demonstrate striking similarity to the inherent organization of metabolic networks in particular, and to that of robust and error-tolerant networks in general. (b) the likelihood that deletion of an individual gene product will prove lethal for the yeast cell clearly correlates with the number of interactions the protein has, meaning that highly-connected proteins are more likely to prove essential than proteins with low number of links to other proteins. These results suggest that a scale-free architecture is a generic property of cellular networks attributable to universal self-organizing principles of robust and error-tolerant networks and that will likely to represent a generic topology for protein-protein interactions."

https://openalex.org/W1957039784,"The interplay of magnetic interactions, the dimensionality of the crystal structure and electronic correlations in producing superconductivity is one of the dominant themes in the study of the electronic properties of complex materials. Although magnetic interactions and two-dimensional structures were long thought to be detrimental to the formation of a superconducting state, they are actually common features of both the high transition-temperature (Tc) copper oxides and low-Tc material Sr2RuO4, where they appear to be essential contributors to the exotic electronic states of these materials. Here we report that the perovskite-structured compound MgCNi3 is superconducting with a critical temperature of 8 K. This material is the three-dimensional analogue of the LnNi2B2C family of superconductors, which have critical temperatures up to 16 K (ref. 2). The itinerant electrons in both families of materials arise from the partial filling of the nickel d-states, which generally leads to ferromagnetism as is the case in metallic Ni. The high relative proportion of Ni in MgCNi3 suggests that magnetic interactions are important, and the lower Tc of this three-dimensional compound-when compared to the LnNi2B2C family-contrasts with conventional ideas regarding the origins of superconductivity."

https://openalex.org/W2135743455,"The two most abundant secreted isoforms of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF<sub>165</sub> and VEGF<sub>121</sub>) are formed as a result of differential splicing of the VEGF-A gene. VEGF<sub>165</sub> and VEGF<sub>121</sub> share similar affinities at the isolated VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-2 but have been previously demonstrated to have differential ability to activate VEGFR-2-mediated effects on endothelial cells. Herein we investigate whether the recently described VEGF<sub>165</sub> isoform-specific receptor neuropilin-1 (Npn-1) is responsible for the difference in potency observed for these ligands. We demonstrate that although VEGFR-2 and Npn-1 form a complex, this complex does not result in an increase in VEGF<sub>165</sub> binding affinity. Therefore, the differential activity of VEGF<sub>165</sub> and VEGF<sub>121</sub>cannot be explained by a differential binding affinity for the complex. Using an antagonist that competes for VEGF<sub>165</sub> binding at the VEGFR-2·Npn-1 complex, we observe specific antagonism of VEGF<sub>165</sub>-meditated phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 without affecting the VEGF<sub>121</sub> response. These data indicate that the formation of the complex is responsible for the increased potency of VEGF<sub>165</sub><i>versus</i> VEGF<sub>121</sub>. Taken together, these data suggest a receptor-clustering role for Npn-1, as opposed to Npn-1 behaving as an affinity-converting subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1494507441,"Integrin-mediated cell adhesion is necessary for the survival of many cell types, and loss of adhesion causes apoptosis. We have previously shown that the α5β1 integrin supports cell survival on fibronectin and increases Bcl-2 protein expression. Here we show that bcl-2 transcription is elevated in cells that attach to fibronectin through αvβ1 or to vitronectin through αvβ3 but is not elevated in cells attaching through the αvβ1 integrin. Bcl-2 protein expression and protection from apoptosis under serum-free conditions correlated withbcl-2 transcription. This integrin-mediated regulation ofbcl-2 is Shc- and FAK-dependent, and activation of Ras by FAK is required. Furthermore, Ras mediates this up-regulation of bcl-2 by activating the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT pathway. Mitogen-activated protein kinase did not appear to be necessary for the activation of bcl-2 transcription. Therefore, our work characterizes the pathway that mediates the effect of integrins on bcl-2 transcription and cell survival.

Chinese hamster ovary focal adhesion kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase phosphate-buffered saline 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide hemagglutinin mitogen-activated protein kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase Cell-matrix interactions are important for promoting survival in a variety of cell types, and failure of cells to adhere to the extracellular matrix results in apoptosis, a phenomenon known as anoikis (1Frisch S.M. Ruoslahti E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). These interactions and the resulting signaling events are mediated by integrins. The ability to prevent anoikis varies among integrins. Adhesion mediated by the α5β1integrin protects Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)1 cells from apoptosis, whereas the αvβ1 integrin does not (2Zhang Z. Vuori K. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6161-6165Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). α5β1-mediated adhesion has also been shown to protect cultured HT29 colon carcinoma cells from apoptosis caused by serum deprivation (3O'Brien V. Frisch S.M. Juliano R.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 224: 208-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and neuronal cells from β-amyloid-induced apoptosis (4Matter M.L. Zhang Z. Nordstedt C. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1019-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The α1β1 and αvβ3 integrins are similar to α5β1 in that they are able activate an anti-anoikis pathway (5Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Mammary epithelial cells are protected from apoptosis when bound to laminin through the α6β1 integrin (6Farrelly N. Lee Y.J. Oliver J. Dive C. Streuli C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1337-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibiting αvβ3 signaling results in endothelial cell apoptosis (7Brooks P.C. Montgomery A.M. Rosenfeld M.

Armstrong L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 251: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Therefore, at least the α5β1, αvβ3, α1β1, and α6β1integrins can play a role in cell survival. Some of the downstream molecules involved in integrin-mediated cell survival are known. Thus, activated or overexpressed focal adhesion kinase (FAK) can protect Madin-Darby canine kidney cells from anoikis (9Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134 (b): 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar, 10Hungerford J.E. Compton M.T. Matter M.L. Hoffstrom B.G. Otey C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). PI3K can similarly render cells resistant to anoikis (11Khwaja A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Mammary epithelial cells use α6β1 in conjunction with insulin signaling to activate PI3K and its downstream effector AKT (PKB) to promote cell survival (6Farrelly N. Lee Y.J. Oliver J. Dive C. Streuli C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1337-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In intestinal epithelial cells, the α5β1 pathway is AKT-dependent (12Lee J.W. Juliano R.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1973-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), whereas a FAK-Ras-JNK pathway has been found to be responsible for the survival effect of fibronectin attachment on primary rabbit synovial fibroblasts (13Almeida E.A. Ilic D. Han Q. Hauck C.R. Jin F. Kawakatsu H. Schlaepfer D.D. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 741-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Shc activation initiates an anti-anoikis signal from a subset of integrins including α5β1, α1β1, and αvβ3 (5Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Therefore, integrins can mediate cell survival by activating a number of anti-apoptotic pathways. Earlier studies by our laboratory have shown that adhesion mediated by α5β1, but not by αvβ1, up-regulates the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in CHO cells, whereas Bax expression is not affected (2Zhang Z. Vuori K. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6161-6165Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). In this study, we set out to examine the downstream components of this integrin-initiated pathway. We report here that transcription of the bcl-2 gene is elevated in cells that attach to the substrate through integrins α5β1 or αvβ3and identify Shc, FAK, Ras, PI3K, and AKT as the signaling molecules required for the increased bcl-2transcription. The CHO cells deficient in α5β1 (CHO-B2) were from Dr. Rudolf Juliano (School of Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC; Ref. 14Schreiner C.L. Bauer J.S. Danilov Y.N. Hussein S. Sczekan M.M. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The CHO-B2/α5β1 and CHO-B2/αvβ1 cells were generated by introducing cDNAs coding for the α5 and αv integrin subunits into α5β1-deficient CHO-B2 cells (15Bauer J.S. Schreiner C.L. Giancotti F.G.

Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The CHO-B2/α5Δcβ1 cells were obtained by transfection of the B2-CHO cells with a truncated α5construct that lacked the cytoplasmic domain. Transfectants expressing the integrin were cloned and expanded (2Zhang Z. Vuori K. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6161-6165Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). All cells were maintained in a modified Eagle's medium (α-MEM; Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and glutamine/penicillin-streptomycin (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA). G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added to the medium of transfected cells at a concentration of 250 µg/ml. The cDNAs for constitutively active Ha-Ras (V12) and dominant negative Ras (N17) were provided by Dr. Alan Hall (University College, London; Ref. 17Rey I. Taylor-Harris P. van Erp H. Hall A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 685-692PubMed Google Scholar). Constitutively active PI3K (p110-CAAX) and dominant negative PI3K (p85D) cDNAs were from Dr. Kristiina Vuori at this institute. The chemical inhibitor of the MAPK pathway UO126 was from Promega (Madison, WI) and was used at 50 µm/ml to treat cells. CD2-FAK and FRNK cDNAs were from Dr. Jun-Lin Guan (Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, Ithaca, NY; Ref. 18Chen H.C. Appeddu P.A. Isoda H. Guan J.L. J. Biol.

The cDNAs for MEK (pCHA-MEK2 222/226D) and dominant-negative MEK were from Dr. M. J. Weber (University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA; Ref. 19Catling A.D. Schaeffer H.J. Reuter C.W. Reddy G.R.

Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). The bcl-2 promoter was from Dr. John. C. Reed at this institute (21Harigai M. Miyashita T. Hanada M. Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1369-1374PubMed Google Scholar). The full-length humanbcl-2 promoter was cloned into the BglII andHindIII cloning sites of the promoterless enhanced green fluorescent protein vector (pEGFP-1; CLONTECH). The construct was sequenced to determine that the bcl-2promoter-GFP construct was in frame. The pcDNA1 vector was used as a control. Cells were plated on 75-mm2 bacterial culture plates that had been coated with human fibronectin (25 µg/ml; Chemicon, Temecula, CA) or human vitronectin (10 µg/ml; from Dr. Kristiina Vuori) overnight at 4 °C. Cells were plated at 1 × 106 cells/plate in serum-free medium (α-MEM; Sigma) and allowed to attach at 37 °C for 4 h. Spread cells were rinsed with PBS and transiently transfected with various cDNAs using the LipofectAMINE reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies). Transfection efficiency was measured using immunoblotting as described below. bcl-2 promoter up-regulation was analyzed in transiently transfected cells at 24 and 48 h. Cells were examined under a Zeiss fluorescence microscope (× 20) at various time points to detect the GFP marker. A FluoroMax-2 fluorimeter (ISA, Jobin Yvon-Spex, Horiba) was used to quantitate GFP fluorescence within cells. At various time points, cells were trypsinized (trypsin-EDTA; Life Technologies), washed twice with serum-containing medium, and washed once with PBS. Cells were resuspended in 2 ml of PBS, and GFP fluorescence was measured at 467-nm excitation and 507-nm emission. Cell viability was assessed using the MTT assay (22Tada H. Shiho O. Kuroshima K. Koyama M. Tsukamoto K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 93: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Cells cultured in microtiter wells were pulsed with 25 µl of a 2.5 mg/ml MTT stock (Sigma) in PBS and incubated for 4 h, after which 100 µl of a solution containing 10% SDS, 0.01n HCl was added. The plates were incubated overnight. Absorption was read on a V max Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA) using a reference wavelength of 650 nm and a test wavelength of 590 nm. Test reagents were added to medium alone to provide a blank. CHO-B2/α5β1, αvβ1, and α5Δcβ1 cells were lysed with lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (0.1 units/ml aprotinin, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 28,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of cell lysates were resolved on 4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P nylon membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and immunoblotted. Membranes were blocked for 1 h with blocking buffer (5% milk, 3% bovine serum albumin/PBS-T) and incubated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-Bcl-2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) at a 1:500 dilution for 2 h. Membranes were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad) at a 1:3000 dilution for 1 h. Immunoblots were developed by Renaissance Chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Expression ofbcl-2 was detected by immunoblotting with anti-bcl-2 antiserum as described (2Zhang Z. Vuori K. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6161-6165Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Expression levels from transfected cDNAs were measured by immunoblotting as described above. Blots were probed with an antibody to hemagglutinin (HA) or FLAG. Anti-HA and anti-FLAG antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc. A cell line deficient in the expression of the α5 integrin subunit (CHO-B2; Ref. 14Schreiner C.L. Bauer J.S. Danilov Y.N. Hussein S. Sczekan M.M. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) was used to generate three cell lines by stable transfection with cDNAs. The cDNAs encoded the human α5 integrin subunit (CHO-B2/α5β1), the α5 subunit lacking the cytoplasmic domain (CHO-B2/α5Δcβ1), or the αvsubunit (CHO-B2/αvβ1; Refs. 15Bauer J.S. Schreiner C.L. Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar and 16Zhang Z. Morla A.O. Vuori K. Bauer J.S. Juliano R.L. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). These cell lines were transiently transfected with a reporter construct in which the bcl-2 promoter drives expression of the enhanced GFP. Thus, activation of bcl-2 transcription could be measured by GFP fluorescence. Adherence to fibronectin activated thebcl-2 promoter in the α5β1 cells but not in the α5Δcβ1 or αvβ1 cells (Fig.1, A–D). Control α5β1 cells that were transfected with the vector alone (pcDNA1) were not fluorescent. The quantitated results for bcl-2 promoter-GFP expression (Fig. 1 E) correlated with Bcl-2 protein expression (Fig. 1 F). The average transfection efficiency was about 40%. To determine if bcl-2 transcription corresponded to cell survival, we assessed cell survival by the MTT assay, which measures cell viability by detecting the ability of a mitochondrial enzyme to reduce its substrate. In agreement with earlier results (2Zhang Z. Vuori K. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6161-6165Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar), cells lacking the full-length α5 integrin subunit (α5Δcβ1, αvβ1, and pcDNA1-transfected cells) were not viable when cultured on fibronectin in serum-free conditions, whereas α5β1-expressing cells survived for an extended period of time (Fig. 1 G). Because Shc-dependent signaling is activated by a subset of integrins, including α5β1 (5Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), we examined whether Shc would mediate activation of bcl-2 transcription. The α5Δcβ1 (Fig.2B) and αvβ1 cells (not shown) transfected with wild type Shc showed elevated bcl-2 transcription (Fig.2 A). In addition, forced expression of dominant negative Shc, which contains a mutation at Tyr317 (317F; Ref. 5Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), inhibited α5β1-initiated activation ofbcl-2 transcription (Fig. 2 B). Immunoblot analysis indicated that these and all other cDNAs used in these experiments were expressed in the transfected cells and that expression levels were approximately equal (results not shown). We also examined whether another integrin, αvβ3, which shares with α5β1 the ability to activate Shc-dependent signaling (5Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), could activatebcl-2 transcription. Indeed, a CHO-B2 cell line expressing αvβ3 when cultured on vitronectin (a ligand for αvβ3) up-regulated bcl-2transcription (Fig. 2 C). Furthermore, forced expression of dominant negative Shc inhibited the αvβ3-dependent bcl-2transcription in these cells (Fig. 2 C). These results suggest that the integrins that are capable of activating Shc specifically activate bcl-2 transcription. A rapid response of integrin adhesion to the extracellular matrix is the recruitment and activation of FAK, and activated FAK can suppress apoptosis in a number of cell types (8Brassard D.L. Maxwell E. Malkowski M. Nagabhushan T.L. Kumar C.C. Armstrong L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 251: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 9Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P.Y. J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). FAK promotes phosphorylation of Shc at tyrosine residue 317 (23Schlaepfer D.D. Jones K.C. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2571-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). This phosphorylated site on Shc serves as a binding site for the SH2 domain of Grb2 (23Schlaepfer D.D. Jones K.C. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2571-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Because Shc associates with FAK, we examined whether FAK played a role in the integrin-mediated bcl-2 survival pathway. Expression of an activated form of FAK (CD2-FAK) caused elevatedbcl-2 transcription in the α5Δcβ1 cells (Fig.3A) and in the αvβ1 cells (not shown). In contrast,bcl-2 was not activated in cells expressing FAK-related nonkinase (FRNK; Ref. 24Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar), which encompasses the carboxyl-terminal domain of FAK (Fig. 3 A). Moreover, FRNK, which can act as a dominant negative of FAK by interfering with integrin-mediated activation of FAK (24Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar, 25Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 151-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), blocked the α5β1-mediated enhancement ofbcl-2 transcription (Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, expression of FRNK blocked the activation of bcl-2transcription by wild type Shc (compare Figs. 2 A and3 A) in the α5Δcβ1 cells. Forced expression of FRNK also inhibited αvβ3-mediated activation ofbcl-2 transcription in the αvβ3cells (Fig. 3 C). These results indicate that integrins enhance bcl-2 expression through a pathway that is dependent on both FAK and Shc. Activated FAK associates with Grb2/Sos, activating Ras (9Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134 (b): 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether Ras was involved in bcl-2 up-regulation by integrins and FAK. The α5Δcβ1 cells transiently transfected with activated Ha-Ras (Ras V12) showed elevatedbcl-2 transcription (Fig. 4), whereas dominant-negative Ha-Ras (Ras N17), blocked activation of thebcl-2 promoter by CD2-FAK (Fig. 4). Therefore, Ras may, at least in part, mediate the enhancement of bcl-2 expression initiated by integrins. Integrins and FAK activate the PI3K and MAPK pathways through Ras (26Clark E.A. Hynes R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14814-14818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 27Marte B.M. Downward J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar) and through direct binding of the p85 subunit of PI3K (28Egan S.E. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 781-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 29Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 67-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 30Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3829) Google Scholar). Shc also interacts with Grb2 and can activate MAPK through Ras upon cell adhesion (5Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). We examined MAPK involvement in regulating bcl-2 transcription by using UO126, a chemical inhibitor that blocks the activation of the ERK-MAPK pathway by MEK. UO126 did not prevent bcl-2 expression induced by activated Ras (Fig. 4). Moreover, α5Δcβ1 cells expressing activated FAK maintained high levels of bcl-2 expression in the presence of UO126 (Fig. 5A). UO126 also did not inhibit bcl-2 transcription induced by α5β1-mediated cell attachment of the α5β1 cells; ERK activation was inhibited by UO126 in these cells shown for Ras-transfected cells in Fig.5 B. Finally, activated MEK2, a kinase that activates MAPK, did not activate bcl-2 transcription (Fig. 5 A), and forced expression of the MAPK phosphatase, MKP1, did not affect α5β1-induced bcl-2 transcription (not shown). Both the activated MEK2 and dominant-negative MEK2 were expressed in the transfected cells as shown by immunoblotting (Fig.5 C). These results indicate that the α5β1-mediated survival pathway is independent of the MAPK pathway. We next examined PI3K involvement. The α5Δcβ1 cells (Fig.6A) and αvβ1 cells (not shown) expressing activated PI3K (p110-CAAX) exhibited elevated bcl-2 transcription levels. We also used p85D, the regulatory subunit of PI3K that lacks the binding site for the catalytic p110 subunit and acts as a dominant negative by binding PI3K regulatory proteins (31Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J. Cell. 1997; 89: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). Forced expression of p85D inhibited bcl-2 transcription induced by FAK (Fig.6 A) and Ras (Fig. 6 B) in the α5Δcβ1 cells and by α5β1 (Fig. 6 C) and αvβ3 (not shown) in the cells expressing these integrins. The p85D dominant negative alone had no effect onbcl-2 transcription (Fig. 6 A). Furthermore, when cells were cultured in the presence of the PI3K chemical inhibitor, Ly294002, bcl-2 transcription was inhibited (data not shown). These results indicate that PI3K is a component of the α5β1-bcl-2 pathway and that PI3K is downstream of Ras in this pathway. PI3K activates the downstream effector AKT, which has an antiapoptotic function under a variety of culture conditions (12Lee J.W. Juliano R.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1973-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 32Downward J. Nature. 1998; 396: 416-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 33Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z.

Therefore, we examined whether AKT would affect bcl-2 transcription. Expression of a dominant negative AKT (34Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar, 35Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4957) Google Scholar), which has a mutation in its kinase domain, inhibited α5β1-initiated activation ofbcl-2 transcription to the same extent as p85D (Fig.7A). In addition, α5Δcβ1 cells transiently transfected with activated AKT (34Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar, 35Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4957) Google Scholar) showed elevated bcl-2 transcription, and dominant negative AKT blocked bcl-2 up-regulation by activated PI3K (Fig. 7 B). These findings indicate that the integrin-mediated bcl-2 survival pathway operates through PI3K and AKT. We next tested whether expression of Shc or the expression of activated forms of FAK, Ras, PI3K, or AKT would prevent apoptosis induced by serum deprivation in the α5Δcβ1 cells. Each of these proteins counteracted the apoptosis-inducing effect of serum withdrawal in these cells (Fig. 8) and in the αvβ1 cells (not shown). Activated MEK did not convey any protection to apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal (not shown). Moreover, the α5Δcβ1 cells when transfected with FRNK, dominant negative Shc, p85D, or dominant negative AKT also survived poorly without serum (Fig. 8). Thus, α5β1 appears to promote cell survival via a Shc/FAK-Ras-PI3K-AKT pathway that up-regulates bcl-2expression. We report here that transcription from the bcl-2promoter is enhanced in cells that attach to extracellular matrix substrates through α5β1 or αvβ3 but not in cells that attach through αvβ1. Bcl-2 protein expression and protection from apoptosis under serum-free conditions correlate withbcl-2 transcription in this system. We define a pathway that starts with integrin-mediated activation of Shc and FAK, followed by FAK-dependent activation of Ras. Subsequent activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway by Ras then leads to the enhanced bcl-2transcription. Three integrins, α5β1, αvβ3, and α1β1, have been shown to be capable of activating Shc, and the Shc activation by these integrins supports cell survival (5Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Our results show that the two Shc-activating integrins we tested, α5β1 and αvβ3, enhance bcl-2 transcription. Thus, it seems that the integrin-mediated survival pathway linked to Shc activation is, at least in part, mediated by elevated transcription ofbcl-2. Our results show that the integrin-mediatedbcl-2 survival pathway also requires FAK. Expression of an activated form of FAK elevated bcl-2 transcription, whereas expression of a dominant negative form, FRNK, inhibited α5β1-mediated up-regulation ofbcl-2. FAK can interact directly with the β1integrin subunit, and β1 integrins recruit FAK to focal adhesions (36Guan J.L. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 37Lin T.H. Aplin A.E. Shen Y. Chen Q. Schaller M. Romer L. Aukhil I. Juliano R.L. J.

Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). However, in our system, the FAK-mediated elevation of bcl-2 transcription in the α5β1 expressing cells appears to be specific to the α5 subunit, because αvβ1 does not enhance bcl-2expression. Moreover, since αvβ3 also activates this survival pathway, it seems that the α and β subunits jointly initiate the bcl-2 pathway. This specificity agrees with the involvement of Shc, which is activated by α5β1 and αvβ3(5Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) and interacts with FAK. The functional consequences of the Shc-FAK association upon integrin signaling are not well understood, but our results indicate that activation of Ras by this signaling pathway is of particular significance to bcl-2 expression. FAK interacts with a number of downstream signaling molecules including Grb2/Sos, Src, p130cas, tensin, paxillin, and the p85 subunit of PI3K (5Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E.

Sci. 1997; 22: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar) and can promote the activation of Ras (11Khwaja A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). As we find that Ras is required for enhanced bcl-2 expression, the ability of FAK to activate Ras through the Grb2/Sos association, perhaps in concert with Shc-mediated Ras activation, may be particularly important for this pathway. The enhanced bcl-2 transcription initiated by α5β1 and αvβ3that we have documented here appears to depend on the activation of PI3K by Ras. The ability of activated Ras to increase bcl-2transcription was blocked by expression of dominant negative PI3K, and activated PI3K elevated bcl-2 transcription and protected cells from apoptosis. Ras overexpression protects cells in suspension from apoptosis, and PI3K rather than MAPK activation mediates the Ras effect (31Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J. Cell. 1997; 89: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). Furthermore, integrin-mediated activation of MAPK has been shown to be independent of FAK activation in fibroblasts (37Lin T.H. Aplin A.E. Shen Y. Chen Q. Schaller M. Romer L. Aukhil I. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1385-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Our integrin-initiated survival pathway is similarly independent of the MAPK pathway, because expression of activated MEK and treatment of cells with a chemical inhibitor of MAPK activation had no effect in our system. This conclusion agrees with the integrin specificity ofbcl-2 expression, since MAPK activation is affected by most, if not all, integrins (30Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3829) Google Scholar). Therefore, the integrin-mediatedbcl-2 survival pathway appears to be distinct from the integrin-mediated activation of MAPK. Our data indicate that integrin-mediated regulation of bcl-2transcription occurs through a PI3K-dependent pathway and that this pathway involves activation of AKT. Recently, α5β1 expression has been reported to protect intestinal epithelial cells from apoptosis through a pathway that is dependent on PI3K and AKT (12Lee J.W. Juliano R.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1973-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). αvβ3 has been found to activate AKT in a manner that is dependent on the activation state of the integrin, and the substrate cells were plated on (39Zheng D.Q. Woodard A.S. Tallini G. Languino L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24565-24574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These authors did not analyze Bcl-2 expression or the upstream elements of the AKT pathway. Moreover, unlike in CHO cells (2Zhang Z. Vuori K. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6161-6165Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar), the α5β1 survival effect described by Lee and Juliano (12Lee J.W. Juliano R.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1973-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) was independent of the cytoplasmic domain of α5. Thus, while the α5β1 survival pathways in CHO cells and intestinal epithelial cells show some similarities, cell type-specific differences may exist. In primary rabbit synovial fibroblasts, a FAK-Ras-JNK survival pathway is activated on fibronectin under serum-free conditions (13Almeida E.A. Ilic D. Han Q. Hauck C.R. Jin F. Kawakatsu H. Schlaepfer D.D. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 741-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). While Ras may activate both the PI3K and JNK pathways, in our study activation of bcl-2 transcription through the PI3K pathway is a more prominent pathway for cell survival than the JNK pathway. AKT phosphorylates a number of downstream molecules including Bad, NF-κB, CREB, survivin, and a member of the Forkhead transcription factor family, FKHRL1 (33Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z.

It is interesting to note that enhanced CREB activity can increase bcl-2 expression levels in cells stimulated with insulin-like growth factor-1 (43Pugazhenthi S. Nesterova A. Sable C.

It will be informative to determine whether NF-κB or FKHRL1 regulatebcl-2-expression, because both NF-κB and FKHRL1 play a role in cell survival. Elevated bcl-2 transcription may be a downstream signal derived from a number of different AKT-dependent survival pathways. PI3K-dependent regulation of Bcl-2 expression is not limited to integrins. Interestingly, VEGF may use the same survival pathway. VEGF has been shown to both activate PI3K and elevatebcl-2 expression (45Gerber H.P. Dixit V. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13313-13316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar, 46Gerber H.P. McMurtrey A. Kowalski J. Yan M. Keyt B.A. Dixit V. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30336-30343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1746) Google Scholar). In addition, insulin-like growth factor-1 protects cells from apoptosis by elevating bcl-2transcription in an AKT-dependent manner (42Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). Receptors for both of these growth factors as well as the platelet-derived growth factor-β receptor physically associate with the αvβ3 integrin, with a resulting synergistic effect on cell growth (47Schneller M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5600-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 48Soldi R. Mitola S. Strasly M. Defilippi P. Tarone G. Bussolino F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 882-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). This synergy may explain the pronounced dependence of endothelial cell survival during angiogenesis on αvβ3 (7Brooks P.C. Montgomery A.M. Rosenfeld M. Reisfeld R.A. Hu T. Klier G. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1157-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar). In mammary epithelial cells, the α6β1 integrin in conjunction with insulin signaling activates PI3K and AKT, promoting cell survival (6Farrelly N. Lee Y.J. Oliver J. Dive C. Streuli C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1337-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Thus, activation of the PI3K-AKT axis appears to be a point of integration for cell survival signals mediated both by integrins and growth factor receptors. The results reported here show that one effector of this pathway is bcl-2. We thank Dr. E. Pasquale for comments on the manuscript."

By the yeast two-hybrid screen, we found that a glycine-rich extracellular protein, AtGRP-3, binds to the extracellular domain of Wak1. Further in vitro binding studies indicated that AtGRP-3 is the only isoform among the six tested AtGRPs that specifically interacts with Waks, and the cysteine-rich carboxyl terminus of AtGRP-3 is essential for its binding to Wak1. We also show that Wak1 and AtGRP-3 form a complex with a molecular size of ∼500 kDa in vivo in conjunction with the kinase-associated protein phosphatase, KAPP, that has been shown to interact with a number of plant receptor-like kinases. Binding of AtGRP-3 to Wak1 is shown to be crucial for the integrity of the complex. Wak1 and AtGRP-3 are both induced by salicylic acid treatment. Moreover, exogenously added AtGRP-3 up-regulates the expression of Wak1, AtGRP-3, and PR-1 (for pathogenesis-related) in protoplasts.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 634-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). ECM molecules interact with plasma membrane proteins to initiate and modulate diverse signaling pathways that play key roles in essential cellular processes (2Boudreau N. Bissell M.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 640-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Although these events are well understood in animals (3Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3809) Google Scholar), their study in land plants is in its infancy (4Braun D.M. Walker J.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 70-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 5Cosgrove D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1997; 13: 171-201Crossref Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 6Kohorn B.D.

Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 299-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The interactions of cell surface receptors with ligands and extracellular molecules in ECM or cell wall may be involved in these events. Waks, cell wall-associated receptor kinases, physically link the plant ECM to the plasma membrane and can also serve as signaling molecules (10He Z.-H. Fujiki M. Kohorn B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19789-19793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 11Kohorn B.D. Lane S. Smith T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10989-10992Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). They contain an extracellular domain that mediates tight association with the cell wall, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic protein kinase domain (12He Z.-H. Cheeseman I. He D. Kohorn B.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 39: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Although Waks are highly conserved in the kinase domains, they share only 40–64% sequence identities in the extracellular domains. Waks have in their extracellular domains epidermal growth factor-like repeats and regions similar to the known ECM proteins that include tenascins, collagens, and neurexins (12He Z.-H. Cheeseman I. He D. Kohorn B.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 39: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Considering the less conserved sequences and the sequence similarity with various ECM proteins in the extracellular domains, it is supposed that the Wak isoforms are functionally distinct and mediate diverse extracellular signals from ECM to the cells. Wak1 was shown to be implicated in the defense mechanism against pathogen (13He Z.-H. He D. Kohorn B.D. Plant J. 1998; 14: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Wak1 is induced by pathogen or by exogenously added salicylic acid (SA) or 2,6-dichloroisonicotinic acid (INA), which requires a positive regulator, NPR1/NIM1 (14Cao H. Glazebrook J. Clarke J.D. Volko S. Dong X. Cell. 1997; 88: 57-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). Although Wak1 has thus been regarded as a pathogen-related protein, the physiological functions of Waks are largely unknown. Identification of the upstream and/or downstream molecules of Waks is crucial for the elucidation of the physiological roles of Waks and the molecular mechanisms underlying Wak activities. In this study, we report that a glycine-rich secreted protein, AtGRP-3 (15de Oliveira D.E. Seurinck J. Inze D. Van Montagu M. Botterman J. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), specifically binds to the extracellular domain of Wak1. Coimmunoprecipitation and size exclusion chromatography experiments combined with Western blotting show that Wak1, AtGRP-3, and kinase-associated protein phosphatase (KAPP) are associated into a multimeric complex of 500 kDa in size in vivo; the binding of AtGRP-3 to Wak1 is essential for the structural integrity of the complex. We also demonstrate that AtGRP-3 induces PR-1, a pathogen-related gene, and triggers a positive feedback loop that up-regulates the expression of Wak1 and AtGRP-3. We propose that AtGRP-3 is an extracellular molecule that binds to and regulates Wak functions in Arabidopsis. The MATCHMAKER two-hybrid system (CLONTECH) was used for screening. TheArabidopsis cDNA library was constructed in GAL4 activation domain vector (pGAD424) as described (16Choi G. Yi H. Lee J. Kwon Y.K. Soh M.S. Shin B. Luka Z. Hahn T.R. Song P.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 610-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The bait construct was prepared by cloning the region for the extracellular domain of Wak1 (amino acids 178–334) into the GAL4 binding domain vector (pGBT9). The HF7c yeast strain was sequentially transformed with the bait construct and then with the cDNA library. Transformants (9 × 106) were screened for activation of theHIS3 and lacZ reporter genes. The full-lengthAtGRP-3 and AtGRP-3S genes were isolated from the cDNA library by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The interaction between the two proteins was quantitated by a liquid β-galactosidase assay usingO-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (ONPG) as substrate. For Waks, the coding region for the extracellular domain was cloned into pGEX vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusions include amino acids 25–334 of Wak1, 23–328 of Wak2, 23–327 of Wak3, 23–331 of Wak4, and 20–280 of Wak5. AtGRP-3 (amino acids 25–145) was constructed in pET15b vector (Novagen), which produced a fusion protein with the carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine tag. Escherichia coli BL21 cells transformed with the constructs were grown in LB containing 50 µg/ml ampicillin to an A 600 0.4–0.5. The expression of Wak and AtGRP-3 proteins was then induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 4 h at 30 °C or for 2 h at 37 °C, respectively. Cells were harvested, resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 10 µg/ml leupeptin), and sonicated. Lysates were centrifuged to remove insoluble material and incubated with Glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for Waks or with Ni2+ProBond (Invitrogen) for AtGRP-3. Fusion proteins were purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. GST-Wak fusion proteins (3–5 µg) and [35S]Met or [35S]Cys-labeled in vitro translated AtGRPs were incubated in binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 10 µg/ml leupeptin). Glutathione-Sepharose 4B resins were added and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with constant rotation. The resins were washed three times with the binding buffer and resuspended in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. Proteins were separated on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. Polyclonal antibodies were raised in mouse to recombinant AtGRP-3 protein and in rabbit to Wak1-specific peptide (amino acids 98–112). The specificities of antibodies were confirmed with both recombinant proteins and plant extracts (Fig. 3, A and B). In Western analysis, the proteins were separated on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with these antibodies. The antibody-bound proteins were detected by incubation with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Arabidopsis leaf tissues were incubated in protoplast isolation buffer (1% Cellulase Onozuka R-10, 0.25% Macerozyme R-10, 400 mm mannitol, 8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MES, pH 5.6, 1 mm PMSF, 10 µg/ml leupeptin) at 25 °C for 2.5–3 h with gentle shaking at 50–75 rpm, as described (17Abel S. Theologis A. Martinez-Zapater J.M. Salinas J. Arabidopsis Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1998: 209-217Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The isolated protoplasts were filtered through a 70-µm nylon mesh and centrifuged for 10 min at 60 × g. The pelleted protoplasts were gently resuspended and washed two times with 500 mmmannitol. The protoplasts were resuspended to 1 × 106cells/ml in K3 medium (400 mm sucrose, 4.3 g/l Murashige and Skoog salts, 100 mg/liter myo-inositol, 250 mg/liter xylose, 460 mg/liter CaCl2, 10 mg/liter thiamine, 1 mg/liter pyridoxine, 1 mg/liter nicotinic acid, pH 5.8, 1 mm PMSF, 10 µg/ml leupeptin). The isolated protoplasts were incubated with phosphate-buffered saline or purified AtGRP-3 proteins at room temperature for the indicated time. The protoplasts were then harvested by centrifugation. In this step, most of unbound AtGRP-3 proteins are removed from protoplasts. Protein extracts fromArabidopsis seedlings and protoplasts were prepared in extraction buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, protein phosphatase inhibitor cocktail I (Sigma), 1% Triton X-100). For gel filtration, proteins were extracted in extraction buffer B (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, protein phosphatase inhibitor cocktail I, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100). Protein extracts were further centrifuged to remove insoluble materials. Protein concentration was determined with the Bio-Rad assay system. An aliquot (1 mg of protein) in buffer A was incubated with preimmune or immune serum in the same buffer overnight at 4 °C. Protein A/G PLUS-Agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added and further incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitate was washed and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Protein extracts in buffer B were applied to size exclusion fast protein liquid chromatography. Proteins were fractionated over a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with the running buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl). Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. RNA was extracted using 0.5 ml of Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.)/106 cells of protoplasts. Contaminated genomic DNA from total RNA was removed as described (18Penninckx I.A.M.A. Eggermont K. Terras F.R.G. Thomma B.P.H.J. De Samblanx G.W. Buchala A. Métraux J.-P. Manners J.M. Broekaert W.F. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 2309-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Total RNA (1 µg) was treated with 6 units of RNase-free DNase I (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 5 min at 37 °C. The activity of DNase I was inactivated by boiling. The RNA was then cleaned up using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR was performed with 0.1 µg of total RNA using the Acess RT-PCR system (Promega). To identify proteins that bind to the extracellular domain of Wak1, we performed the yeast two-hybrid screen (19Fields S. Song O.K. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4853) Google Scholar). A library of Arabidopsis seedling cDNAs fused to the GAL4 activation domain was screened against the construct encoding the extracellular domain of Wak1 fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain. Among the positive clones, of interest was AtGRP-3, which is a member of a previously described family of glycine-rich secreted cell wall proteins (20Keller B. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 1127-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 21Sachetto-Martins G. Franco L.O. de Oliveira D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1492: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 22Showalter A.M. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). While we were trying to isolate full-length AtGRP-3 cDNA by PCR, we identified a closely related sequence that is 81% identical to AtGRP-3 and lacks ∼25 amino acids near the amino terminus (Fig. 1 A). This short form of AtGRP-3 will hereafter be referred to as AtGRP-3S. To confirm the interaction between Wak1 and AtGRP-3, the extracellular domain of Wak1 (ED/pGBT9) and full-length AtGRP-3 (AtGRP-3/pGAD424) or AtGRP-3S (AtGRP-3S/pGAD424) fusion constructs were cotransformed into a yeast reporter strain HF7c. The transformants were then tested for their ability to grow on selective plates lacking histidine and the expression of β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 1 B). The results indicated that both AtGRP-3 and AtGRP-3S bind to the extracellular domain of Wak1. To further confirm the interaction of Wak1 with AtGRP-3 and AtGRP-3S, an in vitro binding assay was performed (Fig.1 C). Purified GST (lane 1) or GST-extracellular domain of the Wak1 fusion protein (GST-ED) (lane 2) was incubated with the in vitro translated [35S]Cys-labeled AtGRP-3S (lane 3) or AtGRP-3 (lane 4). The resulting complexes were isolated by glutathione-Sepharose beads. Both AtGRP-3S and AtGRP-3 bound to GST-ED (lanes 6 and 8) but not to GST alone (lanes 5 and 7), indicating that Wak1 specifically interacts with both AtGRP-3 and AtGRP-3S. FiveWak genes (Wak1–Wak5) (12He Z.-H. Cheeseman I. He D. Kohorn B.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 39: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and multipleAtGRP genes (15de Oliveira D.E. Seurinck J. Inze D. Van Montagu M. Botterman J. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 23de Oliveira D.E. Franco L.O. Simoens C. Seurinck J. Coppieters J.

Biol. 1993; 21: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) from Arabidopsis have been identified previously. The complete Arabidopsis genome sequence also reveals the existence of additional Wak and GRP family members. Therefore, we tested whether the interaction between Wak1 and AtGRP-3 shown above is isoform-specific or whether it merely represents one of the general interactions between Waks and AtGRPs. The purified GST-ED was incubated with the in vitro translated [35S]Cys- or [35S]Met-labeled AtGRPs. The resulting complexes were collected by glutathione-Sepharose beads and separated on an SDS-gel (Fig.2 A). The results demonstrated that Wak1 binds only to AtGRP-3 but not to other tested AtGRPs (AtGRP-2, 4, 6, 7, 8). The binding specificity of AtGRP-3 was then tested against the five Wak isoforms. The in vitrotranslated [35S]Cys-labeled AtGRP-3 was incubated with the purified GST-ED of the Wak fusion proteins, and the complexes were analyzed (Fig. 2 B). The results indicated that AtGRP-3 binds to Wak1, Wak3, and Wak5. We obtained the same results with AtGRP-3S (data not shown), implying that AtGRP-3 and AtGRP-3S may play similar physiological roles. Notably, AtGRP-2, -4, -6, -7, and -8 did not bind to any of the Wak isoforms (data not shown), indicating that AtGRP-3 and AtGRP-3S are unique among AtGRPs in their ability to interact with Waks. We next localized the region in AtGRP-3 that is responsible for the interaction with Wak1. Constructs for the amino- and carboxyl-terminal deleted forms (AtGRP-dN and AtGRP-dC, respectively) and the carboxyl-terminal region (AtGRP-CT) of AtGRP-3 were generated (Fig.2 C). The proteins were in vitro translated and subjected to the in vitro binding assay with GST alone or GST-ED (Fig. 2 D). Interactions were observed with full-length AtGRP-3, AtGRP-dN, and AtGRP-CT but not with AtGRP-dC, indicating that the cysteine-rich carboxyl terminus is essential for the association of Wak1 and AtGRP-3. We have generated anti-Wak1 and anti-AtGRP-3 antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The anti-Wak1 antibody specifically recognized only the ED of Wak1 but not those of other tested Wak proteins (Fig. 3 A). Western blotting of Arabidopsis protein extracts with anti-Wak1 antibody detected two bands that migrate as ∼78- and 100-kDa proteins on an SDS-gel. Because the expected size of Wak1 is 78 kDa, the slowly migrating band is likely to be a post-translationally modified form (e.g. glycosylated) of Wak1 (Fig. 3 B, lane 1). Anti-AtGRP-3 antibody recognized an 18-kDa band that is larger than the expected 12 kDa of AtGRP-3 (lane 2). This discrepancy is unlikely to be due to a post-translational modification, because the in vitro translated (Fig. 1 C) or recombinant AtGRP-3 protein purified from E. coli (Fig.3 A) also migrated as an 18-kDa protein. Protein extracts from Arabidopsis seedlings were subjected to immunoprecipitation with preimmune or anti- AtGRP-3 antibody (Fig.3 C). The precipitated proteins were separated on an SDS-gel and probed with anti-Wak1 antibody. The results showed that both 78- and 100-kDa Wak1 proteins were co-precipitated with AtGRP-3, indicating that Wak1 and AtGRP-3 form a complex in vivo. As KAPP has been shown to interact with a number of plant receptor-like kinases (26Braun D.M. Stone J.M. Walker J.C. Plant J. 1997; 12: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), we tested whether KAPP is also associated with the Wak1·AtGRP-3 complex. The proteins immunoprecipitated by anti-AtGRP-3 antibody were probed with anti-KAPP antibody, which recognized a 65-kDa KAPP protein on a Western blot (Fig. 3 B, lane 3). The presence of KAPP in the immunoprecipitates (Fig.3 C) suggests that KAPP is a component of the complex that includes Wak1 and AtGRP-3. To further analyze the protein complex of Wak1, AtGRP-3, and KAPP, protein extracts of Arabidopsis seedlings were subjected to size exclusion chromatography. The fractions were then probed with anti-Wak1, anti-AtGRP-3, and anti-KAPP antibodies (Fig.4 A). The molecular sizes were extrapolated from a standard curve prepared with a set of marker proteins. Wak1 proteins were present in two complexes with the apparent molecular sizes of 500 and 200 kDa, respectively. It is noticeable that 100- and 78-kDa Wak1 proteins were separated into the 500- and 200-kDa complexes. AtGRP-3 was fractionated along with the 500-kDa complex but not with the 200-kDa complex. This suggests that AtGRP-3 is stably associated with the 100-kDa Wak1 in the 500-kDa complex. AtGRP-3, which runs as a 48-kDa protein, is likely the unbound form of AtGRP-3. KAPP was detected mostly in the range of 500 to 600 kDa, implying the association of KAPP with a number of receptor-like kinases as reported (26Braun D.M. Stone J.M. Walker J.C. Plant J. 1997; 12: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To elucidate the role of AtGRP-3 in the formation of the 500-kDa complex, we analyzed protein extracts of protoplasts by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 4 B). AtGRP-3 was completely absent in the protoplasts as determined by Western blotting. In the absence of AtGRP-3, Wak1 was detected mostly in the 200-kDa complex (−AtGRP-3). Upon the addition of the recombinant AtGRP-3 protein to protoplasts, Wak1 reappeared associated with the 500-kDa complex, and the added AtGRP-3 was also eluted along with the 500-kDa complex (+AtGRP-3). These data suggest that AtGRP-3 is essential to the structural integrity and/or probably the formation of the 500-kDa complex that includes Wak1 and AtGRP-3. The recombinant AtGRP-dC, which lacks the 35 carboxyl-terminal amino acids, was ineffective (+AtGRP-dC), suggesting that the direct interaction between Wak1 and AtGRP-3 is critical for the formation and/or maintenance of the integrity of the 500-kDa complex. In an effort to evaluate the biological relevance of the interaction between Wak1 and AtGRP-3, we examined the expression pattern of Wak1 and AtGRP-3 inArabidopsis tissues by Northern analysis. Wak1and AtGRP-3 were co-expressed predominantly in leaves and stems (Fig. 5 A), which is consistent with previous reports (12He Z.-H. Cheeseman I. He D. Kohorn B.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 39: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 13He Z.-H. He D. Kohorn B.D. Plant J. 1998; 14: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 15de Oliveira D.E. Seurinck J. Inze D. Van Montagu M. Botterman J. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). It was also shown thatWak1 expression is induced by SA and that this induction requires the positive regulator NPR1/NIM1 (12He Z.-H. Cheeseman I. He D. Kohorn B.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 39: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). We thus analyzed the expression of Wak1 and AtGRP-3 in response to SA. Northern analysis showed that both AtGRP-3 andWak1 were induced upon SA treatment (Fig. 5 B). This induction was abolished by mutation in npr1 and by overexpression of nahG, which degrades SA (14Cao H. Glazebrook J. Clarke J.D. Volko S. Dong X. Cell. 1997; 88: 57-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar, 28Friedric L. Vernooij B. Gaffney T. Morse A. Ryals J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 C). These data suggest that the functions of Wak1 and AtGRP-3 are closely related and implicated in the SA signaling. We tested by RT-PCR whether the treatment of protoplasts with AtGRP-3 resulted in the regulation of gene expression (Fig. 6). The expression ofWak1 and AtGRP-3 was up-regulated by the addition of AtGRP-3 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6, Aand C), indicating that Wak1 andAtGRP-3 are in a positive feedback loop that enhances AtGRP-3·Wak1 signaling. The addition of AtGRP-3 to protoplasts also induced PR-1, a molecular marker of SA-dependent defense response, but not PDF1.2 (for plantdefensin), a molecular marker of jasmonic acid-dependent defense response (29Thomma B.P.H.J. Eggermont K. Penninckx I.A.M.A. Mauch-Mani B. Vogelsang R. Cammue P.A. Broekaert W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15107-15111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar, 30Bowling S.A. Clarke J.D. Liu Y. Klessig D.F. Dong X. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1573-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). It is worth noting that the expression of Wak1 andAtGRP-3 was induced by SA (Fig. 5 B). In contrast to AtGRP-3, the exogenously added AtGRP-dC and bovine serum albumin scarcely affected the expression level of the tested genes (Fig. 6,B and D). Taken together with the fact that AtGRP-3 binds to Wak1 in a specific manner, these data suggest that AtGRP-3 is a physiological ligand of Wak1 and that the AtGRP-3·Wak1 signaling pathway is involved in the SA-dependent defense response. Plant cells are encompassed by the cell wall or ECM, which is complex in structure and function (5Cosgrove D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1997; 13: 171-201Crossref Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 8Pennel R. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 504-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 20Keller B. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 1127-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 22Showalter A.M. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). In addition to conferring physical strength, the plant cell wall regulates cell growth, development, and cell-cell and cell-environment interactions. Although the plant cell wall harbors carbohydrates and proteins that actively change in structure and composition, little is known about the precise functions of the cell wall components and their interactions. Waks are cell wall-associated kinases, and the different isoforms vary significantly in the extracellular domains (12He Z.-H. Cheeseman I. He D. Kohorn B.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 39: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that the extracellular domains of Wak proteins may be involved in the interaction with diverse wall components in a cell type- or stage-dependent manner. Waks may perceive differential signals from the changing environment through the interaction of the extracellular domain with cell wall molecules and transduce the signals to the cell. AtGRP-3 is a member of the GRP family and is likely a cell wall protein with a predicted signal peptide at the amino terminus (15de Oliveira D.E. Seurinck J. Inze D. Van Montagu M. Botterman J. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Its amino acid sequence has a high glycine (31%) content, and its mid-region is marked by a glycine-rich domain of 57 amino acids with the sequence Gly4-Asn/Arg-Tyr-Gln repeated six times. The signal peptide and carboxyl-terminal cysteine-rich motif show sequence similarity to several nodule-specific plant-encoded proteins (nodulins) (31Sandal N.N. Bojsen K. Richter H. Sengupta-Gopalan C. Marcker K.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 18: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In a recent report, the cysteine-rich carboxyl-terminal region of NtTLRP, a cell wall protein in tobacco that is highly homologous to that of AtGRP-3, was sufficient for cross-linking of proteins to cell walls (32Domingo C. Sauri A. Mansilla E. Conejero V. Vera P. Plant J. 1999; 20: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, the physiological functions of GRPs are unknown. The sequences of the GRP family members are divergent with few conserved regions, which suggests that GRPs may play diverse biological roles (21Sachetto-Martins G. Franco L.O. de Oliveira D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1492: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown that AtGRP-3 specifically binds to Wak1 both in vitro and in vivo. We also provide several lines of evidence suggesting that Wak1-AtGRP-3 interaction is physiologically relevant and the binding of AtGRP-3 regulates the signaling activity of Wak1. First, Wak1, AtGRP-3, and KAPP are associated into a 500-kDa complex in vivo that may represent the activated signalosome (33Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 100: 113-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2261) Google Scholar, 34Wei N. Deng X.W. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 98-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 35Zhang S.Q. Kovalenko A. Cantarella G. Wallach D. Immunity. 2000; 12: 301-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar); the direct binding of AtGRP-3 to Wak1 is critical for the integrity of the 500-kDa complex. These interactions share many features with the regulation of the CLAVATA1 (CLV1) receptor kinase (36Trotochaud A.E. Hao T. Wu G. Yang Z. Clark S.E. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 37Trotochaud A.E. Jeong S. Clark S.E. Science. 2000; 289: 613-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Second, exogenously added recombinant AtGRP-3 to protoplasts up-regulated the expression of PR-1as well as Wak1 and AtGRP-3. In the previous report, it was shown that the expression of the antisenseWak1 allele in transgenic plants inhibits the induction ofPR-1 response (13He Z.-H. He D. Kohorn B.D. Plant J. 1998; 14: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Involvement of both Wak1 and AtGRP-3 inPR-1 induction suggests that these molecules are closely related in their biological functions. On an SDS-gel, Wak1 migrates as two bands with the molecular sizes of 78 and 100 kDa, respectively. The slowly migrating 100-kDa protein appears to be the functional Wak1 because this protein but not the 78-kDa protein is associated with AtGRP-3 and KAPP to form the 500 kDa complex. In protoplasts, all of the Wak1 proteins exist as the seemingly incompetent 78-kDa protein. Upon the addition of recombinant AtGRP-3, the 100-kDa Wak1 reappeared. It is possible that either AtGRP-3 invokes the modification of 78 kDa, resulting in the appearance of 100-kDa Wak1, or AtGRP-3 prevents the 100-kDa Wak1 from being cleaved to 78-kDa Wak1, thus resulting in the accumulation of 100-kDa Wak1. The detailed molecular mechanism underlying the communication between Wak1 and ArGRP-3 remains to be seen. However, switching between active and inactive forms of Wak1 by the post-translational modification triggered by AtGRP-3 provides a unique mechanism for the modulation of receptor function by ligand molecules. The noticeable feature of the carboxyl-terminal region of AtGRP-3 is the presence of six conserved cysteine residues. The sequence alignment of Wak isoforms also exhibits the conserved cysteine residues in 24 places (12He Z.-H. Cheeseman I. He D. Kohorn B.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 39: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). It would be interesting to see whether the conserved cysteine residues in AtGRP-3 and Wak1 participate in the interaction between these two molecules and with others. Disulfide bonding is reversibly dependent on the redox state in the cell wall, which would change in different developmental stages. The reactive oxygen species generated under various stress conditions such as wounding, pathogen attack, cold, or ozone stress would also affect the redox condition of the cell wall (38Lamb C. Dixon R.A. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 251-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (2538) Google Scholar, 39Mudd J.B. Yunus M. Iqbal M. Plant Response to Air Pollution.

Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). There have been reports that the oxidative cross-linking of the cell wall proteins plays an important role as a defense mechanism in response to pathogen attack (42Brady J.D. Fry S.C. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 43Brisson L.F. Tenhaken R. Lamb C.J. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1703-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that the oxidative modifications of cysteine and other residues may regulate the interaction of AtGRP-3, Wak1, and other proteins and therefore the signaling of Wak1. In view of the finding that both Wak1 and AtGRP-3 are induced in response to SA and modulate PR-1 in a positive way as shown in this study and others (13He Z.-H. He D. Kohorn B.D. Plant J. 1998; 14: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 15de Oliveira D.E. Seurinck J. Inze D. Van Montagu M. Botterman J. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), it appears likely that Wak1 and AtGRP-3 are involved in pathogen response. AtGRP-3 and its homologues in tobacco and petunia have expression patterns that suggest a role in the defense mechanism (44Hooft Van Huijsduijnen R.A.M. Van Loon L.C. Bol J.F. EMBO J. 1988; 5: 2057-2061Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 45Linthorst H.J.M. Van Loon L.C. Memelink J. Bol J.F. Plant Mol. Biol. 1990; 15: 521-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It is also conceivable that oxidative change in AtGRP-3 and Wak1 proteins may be the underlying mechanism of the pathogenesis-related response of Wak1 and AtGRP-3. To date only a few plant plasma membrane receptors have been characterized in association with their ligands. A good example is the meristem regulator CLV1, the Arabidopsis receptor kinase that regulates cell proliferation and organ formation at the meristems (46Clark S.E. Williams R.W. Meyerowitz E.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Both genetic and biochemical studies provided evidence that CLV3 acts as the ligand for CLV1 as part of a multimeric comlex (34Wei N. Deng X.W. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 98-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 35Zhang S.Q. Kovalenko A. Cantarella G. Wallach D.

Science. 1999; 283: 1911-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). Another example would be BRI1 and SRK, which are implicated in brassinosteroid signaling and self-incompatibility, respectively (27McCubbin A.G. Kao Th. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

https://openalex.org/W1485293801,"Cortical areas are generally assumed to be uniform in their capacity for adaptive changes or plasticity. Here we demonstrate, however, that neurons in the cat striate cortex (V1) show pronounced adaptation-induced short-term plasticity of orientation tuning primarily at specific foci. V1 neurons are clustered according to their orientation preference in iso-orientation domains that converge at singularities or pinwheel centres. Although neurons in pinwheel centres have similar orientation tuning and responses to those in iso-orientation domains, we find that they differ markedly in their capacity for adaptive changes. Adaptation with an oriented drifting grating stimulus alters responses of neurons located at and near pinwheel centres to a broad range of orientations, causing repulsive shifts in orientation preference and changes in response magnitude. In contrast, neurons located in iso-orientation domains show minimal changes in their tuning properties after adaptation. The anisotropy of adaptation-induced orientation plasticity is probably mediated by inhomogeneities in local intracortical interactions that are overlaid on the map of orientation preference in V1."

Both activation and autocatalytic maturation of pro-MMP-2 in trans suggest that MT1-MMP should exist as oligomers on the cell surface. To better understand the functions of MT1-MMP, we designed mutants with substitutions in the active site (E240A), the cytoplasmic tail (C574A), and the RRXR furin cleavage motifs (R89A, ARAA, and R89A/ARAA) of the enzyme. The mutants were expressed in MCF7 breast carcinoma cells that are deficient in both MMP-2 and MT1-MMP. Our results supported the existence of MT1-MMP oligomers and demonstrated that a disulfide bridge involving the Cys574 of the enzyme's cytoplasmic tail covalently links MT1-MMP monomers on the MCF7 cell surface. The presence of MT1-MMP oligomers also was shown for the enzyme naturally expressed in HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells. The single (R89A and ARAA) and double (R89A/ARAA) furin cleavage site mutants of MT1-MMP were processed in MCF7 cells into the mature proteinase capable of activating pro-MMP-2 and stimulating cell locomotion. This suggested that furin cleavage is not a prerequisite for the conversion of pro-MT1-MMP into the functionally active enzyme. A hydroxamate class inhibitor (GM6001, or Ilomastat) blocked activation of MT1-MMP in MCF7 cells but not in HT1080 cells. This implied that a matrixin-like proteinase sensitive to hydroxamates could be involved in a furin-independent, alternative pathway of MT1-MMP activation in breast carcinoma cells. The expression of the wild type MT1-MMP enhanced cell invasion and migration, indicating a direct involvement of this enzyme in cell locomotion. In contrast, both the C574A and E240A mutations render MT1-MMP inefficient in stimulating cell migration and invasion. In addition, the C574A mutation negatively affected cell adhesion, thereby indicating critical interactions involving the cytosolic part of MT1-MMP and the intracellular milieu.

The intrans mechanisms of pro-MMP-2 activation implicate at least two molecules of MT1-MMP, a “receptor” molecule in a complex with TIMP-2 and an “activator” TIMP-2-free molecule. Accordingly, these two molecules of MT1-MMP should be co-localized in immediate proximity on the plasma membrane in order to bring together the binding and the activation of pro-MMP-2 (12Kinoshita T.

Dimerization of MT1-MMP could accomplish this co-localization. However, direct evidence for dimerization of MT1-MMP has been missing.To better understand functions of MT1-MMP, we designed MT1-MMP proteins with mutations in the active site, the two furin cleavage motifs and the cytoplasmic tail (MT1-MMP-E240A, -R89A, -ARAA, -R89A/ARAA, and -C574A, respectively). The wild type and mutant MT1-MMPs were expressed in MCF7 cells that are deficient in both MMP-2 and MT1-MMP. The absence of any MMP-2 and MT1-MMP activities in the parental cells facilitated the analysis of MT1-MMP in the transfected cells.Our observations suggest that MT1-MMP is capable of oligomerization on cell surfaces. Homodimerization was most evident for the enzyme's autolytic ectodomain forms. These inactive forms of MT1-MMP, 39 kDa (presumably, starting from Gly285) and 42 kDa (presumably, starting from Ile256) both lacking the zinc-binding catalytic site domain were identified and characterized in previous reports of other groups (14Hernandez-Barrantes S.

Valtanen H. Keski-Oja J. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). While our manuscript was in preparation, dimerization was demonstrated for MT1-MMP naturally expressed by platelets (53Kazes I. Elalamy I. Sraer J.D. Hatmi M. Nguyen G. Blood. 2000; 96: 3064-3069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Apparently, the Cys574 residue of the cytoplasmic tail is involved in an intermolecular disulfide bond linking monomers of the wild type MT1-MMP.Since the C574A mutant was quite proficient in MMP-2 activation, we suggest that this mutation and, accordingly, the absence of a covalent link between monomers, does not completely abolish dimerization of the enzyme. The existence of self-proteolyzed forms as well as efficacy of the mutant in pro-MMP-2 activation indirectly supports the presence of non-S-S dimers on the surface of cells expressing the MT1-MMP-C574A construct. Association of the homodimer is likely to be initiated by the motif involving the PRXXLYC574 XRSXXXXV sequence of the cytoplasmic tail. This motif is fully conserved in MT1-, MT2-, and MT3-MMPs while MT5-MMP lacks several essential residues of this motif (54Llano E. Pendas A.M. Freije J.P. Nakano A. Knauper V. Murphy G. Lopez-Otin C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2570-2576PubMed Google Scholar). MT4- and MT6-MMPs are entirely missing the motif (55Pei D. Cell Res. 1999; 9: 291-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 56Velasco G.

J. 1999; 339: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) is involved in the mechanisms that facilitate a disulfide bridge formation and stabilization of MT1-MMP dimers.Further, there is evidence of the extensive self-proteolysis of MT1-MMP-wt, -R89A, -ARAA, -R89A/ARAA, and -C574A in our cell system that is devoid of MMP-2 (22Deryugina E.I. Bourdon M.A. Jungwirth K. Smith J.W. Strongin A.Y. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 86: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The catalytically inactive MT1-MMP-E240A protein was incapable of self-proteolysis. In agreement, a hydroxamate inhibitor, Ilomastat, blocked autolytic cleavage of MT1-MMP. Autolysis of MT1-MMP that occurs under deficiency of TIMP-2 (14Hernandez-Barrantes S. Toth M. Bernardo M.M. Yurkova M. Gervasi D.C. Raz Y. Sang Q.A. Fridman R. J. Biol.

Our observations suggest that the soluble activity of MMP-2 is not a prerequisite for the degradation of MT1-MMP on cell surfaces (11Ellerbroek S.M. Fishman D.A. Kearns A.S. Bafetti L.M. Stack M.S.

Seiki M. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37280-37284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 28Sato T. Kondo T. Seiki M. Ito A. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Our data confirmed the hypothesis that furin cleavage of both putative RRXR motifs of MT1-MMP is not necessary for the processing of MT1-MMP and the subsequent activation of pro-MMP-2 in breast carcinoma cells. In our experiments, MT1-MMP-ARAA, -R89A, -R89A/ARAA, and -wt displayed similar, if not identical pattern in immunocapture and MMP-2 activation studies. Resistance of the double MT1-MMP-R89A/ARAA mutant to furin cleavage did not cause any accumulation of the respective proenzyme in MCF7 cells. However, MCF7 cells accumulated the MT1-MMP proenzyme in the presence of Ilomastat. A putative matrixin-like proteinase involved in activation of MT1-MMP remains to be identified. These findings extend the physiological implications of the recent report that furin-independent pathway of MT1-MMP activation exists in rabbit dermal fibroblasts (27Sato T. Kondo T. Fujisawa T. Seiki M. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37280-37284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition, we expressed MT1-MMP in furin-deficient LoVo lung carcinoma cells. Our studies correlate well with the observations of Yana and Weiss (36Yana I. Weiss S.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2387-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) and indicated that LoVo cells were fully capable of MT1-MMP activation (data not shown). These data support the existence of furin-independent cellular pathways involved in the processing of the full-length membrane-anchored MT1-MMP proenzyme.MT1-MMP-wt, -ARAA, and -C574A were efficient in TIMP-2 binding and, with the exception of MT1-MMP-C574A, facilitated migration and invasion of the respective cells through basement membrane-like matrices. The catalytically inactive E240A construct failed to promote cell locomotion. In agreement, Ilomastat inhibited invasion of cells expressing MT1-MMP-wt. Thus, our results indicate that MT1-MMP is directly involved in cell invasion and migration and support our earlier report that, in functional cooperation with integrin αvβ3, MT1-MMP facilitated migration of MCF7 cells devoid of MMP-2 (9Deryugina E.I.

In addition, our studies extend the recent observations that MT1-, MT2-, and MT3-MMP confer invasion-incompetent Madin-Darby canine kidney cells with the ability to penetrate collagen type I matrices (43Hotary K. Allen E. Punturieri A. Yana I. Weiss S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1309-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Hence, the previously underestimated function of MT1-MMP to support cell locomotion appears to be a general phenomenon (44Quaranta V. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1167-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 60Koshikawa N. Giannelli G. Cirulli V. Miyazaki K. Quaranta V. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar).Intriguingly, the proteolytically active mutant MT1-MMP-C574A failed to stimulate migration and invasion of transfected cells. In contrast to all other MT1-MMP constructs, the expression of C574A also negatively affected the adhesive ability of the respective cells. Poor adhesion of C574A cells may result in their inefficient migration and invasion. Immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, TIMP-2 binding, and MMP-2 activation studies demonstrated that the expression levels of this mutant were similar to those of MT1-MMT-wt. However, MT1-MMP-C574A cells were unable to efficiently accomplish adhesion and locomotion. Similarly, a chimeric MT1-MMP protein containing the interleukin-2 receptor α chain transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains failed to localize to invadopodia and to facilitate invasion of melanoma cells (45Nakahara H.

In contrast, Hotary et al.(43Hotary K. Allen E. Punturieri A. Yana I. Weiss S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1309-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) observed that truncation of the MT1-MMP cytoplasmic domain did not affect the invasive phenotype of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells stimulated with hepatocyte growth factor. However, the assays of Hotary et al. (43Hotary K. Allen E. Punturieri A. Yana I. Weiss S.J. J.

Biosynthetically active microsomes isolated from Sinapis alba convertedp-hydroxyphenylacetaldoxime and cysteine intoS-alkylatedp-hydroxyphenylacetothiohydroximate,S-(p-hydroxyphenylacetohydroximoyl)-l-cysteine, the next proposed intermediate in the glucosinolate pathway. The production was shown to be dependent on a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase. We searched the genome of A. thaliana for homologues of CYP71E1 (P450ox), the only known oxime-metabolizing enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of the evolutionarily related cyanogenic glucosides. By a combined use of bioinformatics, published expression data, and knock-out phenotypes, we identified the cytochrome P450 CYP83B1 as the oxime-metabolizing enzyme in the glucosinolate pathway as evidenced by characterization of the recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that the oxime-metabolizing enzyme in the cyanogenic pathway (P450ox) was mutated into a “P450mox” that converted oximes into toxic compounds that the plant detoxified into glucosinolates.

They co-occur with endogenous thioglucosidases called myrosinases that upon tissue damage hydrolyze glucosinolates into a wide range of degradation products such as e.g. isothiocyanates, nitriles, and thiocyanates. Glucosinolates (or rather their degradation products) are involved in plant defense and constitute characteristic flavor compounds and cancer-preventive agents in Brassicavegetables.The biosynthetic pathway from precursor amino acid to the core glucosinolate structure has been well studied, and many of the intermediates are known, including oximes, thiohydroximic acids, and desulfoglucosinolates (1Fahey J.W.

Recently, it has been shown that cytochromes P450 belonging to the CYP79 family catalyze the conversion of amino acids to oximes (3Wittstock U. Halkier B.A. J. Biol.

Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 351-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Little is known about the formation of thiohydroximic acids from oximes. The remaining part of the pathway for the core structure involves a UDP-glucose:thiohydroximic acid glucosyltransferase and a sulfotransferase (for review, see Ref.2Halkier B.A. Ikan R. Naturally Occurring Glycosides: Chemistry, Distribution and Biological Properties. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, United Kingdom1999: 193-223Google Scholar).It has been proposed that aci-nitro compounds are intermediates in the conversion of oximes to thiohydroximic acids (8Ettlinger M.G. Kjær A. Recent Adv. Phytochem. 1968; 1: 59-144Google Scholar). This was supported by isolation of 1-nitro-2-phenylethane fromTropaeolum majus shoots and by in vivo conversion of phenylacetaldoxime into 1-nitro-2-phenylethane and of 1-nitro-2-[1,2-14C]phenylethane into benzylglucosinolate (9Matsuo M. Kirkland D.F. Underhill E.W. Phytochemistry. 1972; 11: 697-701Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The aci-nitro is proposed to be conjugated with a sulfur donor to produce an S-alkyl thiohydroximate, possibly by a glutathione S-transferase (2Halkier B.A. Ikan R. Naturally Occurring Glycosides: Chemistry, Distribution and Biological Properties. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, United Kingdom1999: 193-223Google Scholar). Biochemical studies indicate that the S-alkyl thiohydroximate is subsequently hydrolyzed to the thiohydroximic acid by a C-S lyase (10Kiddle G.A. Bennett R.N. Hick A.J. Wallsgrove R.M. Plant Cell Environ. 1999; 22: 433-445Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Glucosinolates are related to cyanogenic glucosides because both groups of natural plant products are derived from amino acids and have oximes as intermediates. This suggests that the oxime-metabolizing enzyme is the branching point between the cyanogenic glucoside and the glucosinolate pathway. In the biosynthetic pathway of the tyrosine-derived cyanogenic glucoside dhurrin from Sorghum bicolor, the oxime-metabolizing enzyme (designated P450ox or CYP71E1) catalyzes the conversion of oxime to α-hydroxynitrile by dehydrating the oxime to a nitrile, which is then C-hydroxylated to form the β-hydroxynitrile (11Kahn R.A.

The tyrosine-derived p-hydroxybenzylglucosinolate is the major glucosinolate in S. alba. In the present study, we characterize biochemically the oxime-metabolizing enzyme in microsomes from S. alba and show that the enzyme is dependent on a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase. In addition, we show that CYP83B1 is the oxime-metabolizing enzyme in glucosinolate biosynthesis inArabidopsis thaliana as evidenced by biochemical characterization of the recombinant protein. The data substantiate the results recently obtained with the rnt1-1CYP83B1 knock-out mutant (29Bak S. Tax F.E. Feldmann K.A. Galbraith D.A. Feyereisen R.

The same procedure was used to prepare microsomes from seedlings of T. majus, S. bicolor, and Zea mays.Measurements of Oxime-metabolizing Enzyme Activities in Microsomes from S. alba[U-14C]p-Hydroxyphenylacetaldoxime was produced enzymatically by CYP79A1 as previously described (14Halkier B.A. Nielsen H.L. Koch B. Møller B.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In a typical enzyme assay, 1 mg of microsomal protein was incubated in buffer containing 30 mm KPi, pH 7.9, 3 mm NADPH, 38 nCi (66 pmol) of [U-14C]p-hydroxyphenylacetaldoxime, and 6 mm cysteine or N-acetylcysteine in a total volume of 200 μl. After incubation at 29 °C for 1 h, the reaction mixtures were extracted twice with 400 μl of ethyl acetate. If N-acetylcysteine was used as a sulfur donor, the remaining water phases were acidified by addition of 200 μl of 1% formic acid and extracted three times with 800 μl of ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate phases were combined and dried in vacuo.The extracts were redissolved in 30 μl of 50% ethanol and analyzed by TLC. If cysteine was used as a sulfur donor 400 μl of 96% ethanol were added to the remaining water phases, and the solution was clarified by centrifugation for 15 min at 20,000 × g. The supernatants were concentrated in vacuo, redissolved in 30 μl of 50% ethanol, and analyzed by TLC. Boiled microsomes were used in control assays. For analysis of the effect of treatment with cytochrome P450 inhibitor, standard microsomal reaction mixtures were incubated in the presence of 0.1 mm tetcyclasis. The TLC was performed on Silica Gel 60 F254 sheets (Merck) using 2-propanol:ethyl acetate:water (7:1:2, v/v) as eluent. The TLC plates were eluted twice to improve separation. Radiolabeled bands were visualized and quantified on a STORM 840 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). For LC-MS analysis, 5 × 200 μl of reaction mixtures were made as described above except that [U-14C]p-hydroxyphenylacetaldoxime was exchanged for 3 mm unlabeled oxime. The compounds were extracted from the reaction mixtures as described above.LC-MS AnalysisElectrospray ionization LC-MS analysis was done on a HP1100 LC coupled to a Bruker Esquire-LC ion trap mass spectrometer. The reversed-phase LC conditions were as follows: column: XTerra MS C18 3.5 μm, 2.1 × 100 mm (Waters Corp.); mobile phases A: 0.03% HCOOH, B: 80% MeCN, 0.1% HCOOH. The flow rate was 0.2 ml/min, and the gradient program was 0–2 min isocratic 5% B, 2–30 min linear gradient 5–100% B, and 30–35 min isocratic 100% B. The mass spectrometer was run in positive ion mode using a low sampling cone voltage to minimize fragmentation. Authentic standards ofS-(benzohydroximoyl)-l-cysteine andS-(benzohydroximoyl)-N-acetyl-l-cysteine were synthesized and used to develop conditions for the recording of mass spectra of analogue compounds (see above).Phylogenetic TreesThe protein sequences of all the members of the CYP71 family were corrected for prediction errors, and the full-length sequences were aligned including one member of each of the families CYP76, CYP98, and CYP84 using ClustalW (15Thompson J.D.

The PCR fragment was digested withEcoRI and BamHI, ligated into pBluescript II SK, and transferred from pBluescript II SK to aNdeI/BamHI-digested pSP19 g10L vector. All constructs were sequenced to exclude PCR errors.Expression in E. coliE. coli cells of strain C43(DE3) (18Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar) were transformed with the expression constructs and grown overnight in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg ml−1 ampicillin. 2 ml of culture was used to inoculate 200 ml of modified TB medium containing 50 μg ml−1 ampicillin (14Halkier B.A. Nielsen H.L. Koch B. Møller B.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The cultures were grown at 37 °C at 250 rpm until A 600 = 0.5–0.7. Then 1 mm thiamine and 75 μg ml−1δ-aminolevulinic acid were added, and after an additional 1 h of growth, the cultures were induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside and subsequently grown at 28 °C for 40 h at 125 rpm. Spheroplasts were prepared as previously described (14Halkier B.A. Nielsen H.L. Koch B. Møller B.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) except that glycerol was omitted in the final buffer. The amount of expressed functional cytochrome P450 was monitored by Fe2+·CO versus Fe2+difference spectroscopy and quantified using an extinction coefficient of 91 mm−1 cm−1.Characterization of Enzyme Activity of Recombinant CYP71B6, CYP71B7, and CYP83B1The enzyme activity of CYP71B6, CYP71B7, and CYP83B1 was measured in reaction mixtures in which spheroplasts of E. coli transformed with the respective expressing construct were reconstituted with recombinant NADPH:cytochrome P450 reductase (ATR1) from A. thaliana.In a typical enzyme assay, 25 μl of spheroplasts and 0.06 units of NADPH:cytochrome P450 reductase were incubated in buffer containing 50 mmTricine, pH 8.1, 3 mm NADPH, 38 nCi (66 pmol) of [U-14C]p-hydroxyphenylacetaldoxime, and 6 mm cysteine or N-acetylcysteine in a total volume of 100 μl. Spheroplasts of E. coli C43(DE3) transformed with empty vector were used as controls. After incubation at 29 °C for 1 h, the reaction mixtures were extracted and analyzed as described for the microsomal assays. Product formation from the oxime was linear with time within the first 10 min of incubation. For kinetic analysis, 5–50 μm p-hydroxyphenylacetaldoxime was added to the standard reaction mixture, which was incubated for 5 min and analyzed by TLC as described above. Radiolabeled bands were visualized and quantified on a STORM 840 PhosphorImager. For LC-MS analysis, 10 reactions of 100 μl were done as described above except that radiolabeledp-hydroxyphenylacetaldoxime was exchanged with 3 mm unlabeled oxime.Substrate Binding SpectraSubstrate binding spectra were measured for recombinant CYP83B1 using partially purified enzyme. Purification was obtained by temperature-induced Triton X-114 phase partitioning of E. coli spheroplasts as previously described (14Halkier B.A. Nielsen H.L. Koch B. Møller B.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The substrate binding spectra were performed on an SLM Aminco DW-2000 TM spectrophotometer (SLM Instruments, Urbana, IL) at 12 °C using 10 μl of the Triton X-114-rich phase in 990 μl of 50 mmKPi, pH 7.5, and 0.2 mm of eitherp-hydroxyphenylacetaldoxime,p-hydroxyphenylacetonitrile, 1-nitro-2-(p-hydroxyphenyl)ethane, orp-hydroxyphenylacetamide.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have characterized biochemically the conversion of p-hydroxyphenylacetaldoxime toS-(p-hydroxyphenylacetohydroximoyl)-l-cysteine in microsomes from S. alba and shown that the enzyme activity was dependent on a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase. By combined use of bioinformatics, published expression data, and knock-out phenotypes, we identified CYP83B1 as the oxime-metabolizing enzyme in the glucosinolate pathway. We have used the tyrosine-derived oxime as substrate, although A. thaliana does not produce the tyrosine-derived p-hydroxybenzylglucosinolate. We have, however, previously shown that A. thaliana is capable of converting p-hydroxyphenylacetaldoxime intop-hydroxybenzylglucosinolate (22Bak S. Olsen C.E. Petersen B.L. Møller B.L. Halkier B.A. Plant J. 1999; 20: 663-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).S-(Hydroximoyl)-l-cysteine is the most likelyS-alkyl thiohydroximate in the glucosinolate pathway for several reasons. First, in vivo feeding studies have shown that among other sulfur donors, cysteine is most efficiently incorporated into glucosinolates (23Wetter L.R. Chrisholm M.D. Can. J. Biochem. 1968; 46: 931-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Second, the enzyme that convertsS-alkyl thiohydroximate to thiohydroximate is likely to be a C-S lyase, and the characterized C-S lyases from plants hydrolyzeS-substituted cysteine derivatives and have an absolute requirement for the presence of the α-hydrogen atom and an unsubstituted amino group in the cysteine moiety (10Kiddle G.A. Bennett R.N. Hick A.J. Wallsgrove R.M. Plant Cell Environ. 1999; 22: 433-445Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 24Schwimmer S. Kjær A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1960; 42: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We have succeeded for the first time in obtaining a mass spectrum providing evidence for enzymatic synthesis of the proposed intermediateS-(p-hydroxyphenylacetohydroximoyl)-l-cysteine.In vitro S-(p-hydroxyphenylacetohydroximoyl)-l-cysteine undergoes cyclization, which indicates that the proposed C-S lyase is tightly coupled to the sulfur-conjugating enzyme in vivo.For the oxime to be converted into the S-alkyl thiohydroximate, it needs to be oxidized prior to conjugation with the sulfur donor. We have shown the production of 1-nitro-2-(p-hydroxyphenyl)ethane fromp-hydroxyphenylacetaldoxime in microsomes from S. alba, T. majus, and Z. mays. Although recombinant CYP83B1 is able to bind the nitro to the active site, no nitro production or metabolism by the enzyme was detected, indicating that nitro compounds are not intermediates in the glucosinolate pathway. The form of the oxidized oxime might be the corresponding aci-nitro compounds (8Ettlinger M.G. Kjær A. Recent Adv. Phytochem. 1968; 1: 59-144Google Scholar) or nitrile oxides 4A. Kjær, personal communication. (Fig. 8), which are interconvertible by a simple dehydration/hydration reaction and which are very reactive compounds and subject to nucleophilic attack bye.g. cysteine. Based on the expected strong reactivity of the oxidized oxime, conjugation of the sulfur donor is likely to be under strict control. The proposed cysteine conjugation might be carried out by a glutathioneS-transferase. Alternatively, CYP83B1 may have a binding site not only for the oxime but also for cysteine. In the absence of added sulfur donor, an unidentified compound (X) accumulated in the reaction mixture. This compound might be a furoxan (1,2,5-oxadiazole 2-oxide) formed by dimerization of nitrile oxide, or it might be a conjugate derived from a nucleophile present in the reaction mixture. Further studies are in progress to elucidate the mechanism for the formation of the cysteine conjugate.Cyanogenic glucosides and glucosinolates are related groups of natural plant products derived from amino acids and with oximes as intermediates. Cyanogenic glucosides occur throughout the plant kingdom. This indicates that cyanogenesis arose as a very early evolutionary event. In contrast, glucosinolates are restricted to the order Capparales and the genus Drypetes in the distant order Euphorbiales (25Rodman J.E. Soltis P.S. Soltis D.E. Sytsma K.J. Karol K.G. Am. J. Bot. 1998; 85: 997-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Cytochromes P450 belonging to the CYP79 family have been shown to catalyze the conversion of amino acids to oximes in both the cyanogenic and the glucosinolate pathway (3Wittstock U. Halkier B.A. J.

Phytochem. 2000; 34: 191-247Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar), supporting the speculation that the biosynthesis of glucosinolates has evolved from the cyanogenic pathway (27Rodman J.E. Young D.A. Seigler D.S. Phytochemistry and Angiosperm Phylogeny. Praeger, New York1981: 43-79Google Scholar).If evolution of glucosinolates is based on a “cyanogenic predisposition,” this raises the question of how glucosinolates evolved. In the biosynthetic pathway of the cyanogenic glucoside dhurrin in S. bicolor, the oxime-metabolizing enzyme P450ox (CYP71E1) converts the oxime to a α-hydroxynitrile (26Jones P.R. Andersen M.D. Nielsen J.S. Høj P.B. Møller B.L. Recent Adv. Phytochem. 2000; 34: 191-247Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Our working hypothesis has been that a mutated homologue of P450ox, P450mox, catalyzes the oxime-metabolizing step in the biosynthetic pathway of glucosinolates (Fig.9). According to the hypothesis, P450mox would oxidize the oxime to a toxic or reactive compound such as an aci-nitro or a nitrile oxide, which the plant subsequently would have to detoxify. The post-oxime enzymes include the proposed glutathione S-transferase and C-S lyase in addition to the known glucosyltransferase and sulfotransferase. These enzyme groups are known to be involved in general detoxification reactions. This makes it likely that post-oxime enzymes have been recruited from the detoxification processes but now are specialized for glucosinolate production.Figure 9The evolutionary relationship between cyanogenic glucosides and glucosinolates. Identification of the oxime-metabolizing enzyme in the glucosinolate pathway (CYP83B1/P450mox) as related to the oxime-metabolizing enzyme in the cyanogenic pathway (CYP71E1/P450ox) is consistent with the hypothesis that the P450ox in the cyanogenic pathway was mutated into a “P450mox” that converted the oxime into a toxic compound that the plant detoxified into a glucosinolate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Several mutants of CYP83B1 have been reported (20Winkler R.G.

Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Recently, CYP83B1 was described as a regulator of auxin production by controlling the flux of indole-3-acetaldoxime into indole-3-acetic acid and indole glucosinolates (29Bak S. Tax F.E. Feldmann K.A. Galbraith D.A. Feyereisen R. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Characterization of recombinant CYP83B1 expressed in yeast showed that indole-3-acetaldoxime is a high affinity substrate for CYP83B1. The product obtained was shown to form adducts with a number of thiol compounds (29Bak S. Tax F.E. Feldmann K.A. Galbraith D.A. Feyereisen R. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the glucosinolate pathway evolved from an indole-3-acetic acid biosynthetic pathway and not necessarily from the cyanogenic pathway (29Bak S. Tax F.E. Feldmann K.A. Galbraith D.A. Feyereisen R. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Cyanogenic glucosides are derived from only five protein amino acids (Tyr, Phe, Leu, Ile, and Val). The same few protein amino acids are also precursors for glucosinolates together with tryptophan, alanine, methionine, and chain-elongated derivatives of methionine and phenylalanine, which are not precursors of cyanogenic glucosides. This suggests that CYP79s of the glucosinolate pathway have acquired new substrate specificities after having diverged from the “cyanogenic” CYP79s. The biosynthesis of tryptophan-derived and chain-elongated amino acid-derived glucosinolates seems to be recent evolutionary events because indole glucosinolates are present in only four families in the order Capparales, namely in the Brassicaceae, Resedaceae, Tovaraceae, and Capparaceae (30Rodman J.E. Syst. Bot. 1991; 16: 598-618Crossref Google Scholar), and because glucosinolates from chain-elongated amino acids are only found in Brassicaceae, Resedaceae, and Capparaceae (1Fahey J.W.

At pH ≤ 6.5 ANA induced45Ca2+ uptake either in primary cultures of DRG neurons or cells ectopically expressing C-terminally tagged recombinant forms of VR1 with an EC50 = ∼10 µm at pH 5.5.

Vanilloids displaced [3H]ANA in VR1-expressing cells, suggesting competition for binding to VR1. Ratiometric determination of intracellular free calcium and confocal imaging of the VR1-green fluorescent fusion protein revealed that, at low pH (≤6.5), ANA could induce an elevation of intracellular free Ca2+ and consequent intracellular membrane changes in DRG neurons or transfected cells expressing VR1.

The ligand-induced changes in Ca2+ at pH ≤ 6.5 are consistent with the idea that ANA and other eicosanoids act as endogenous ligands of VR1 in a conditional fashion in vivo.The pH dependence suggests that tissue acidification in inflammation, ischemia, or traumatic injury can sensitize VR1 to eicosanoids and transduce pain from the periphery.

It is hypothesized that acidification and eicosanoid release during inflammation may synergize to produce nociceptor sensitization, but the molecular mechanisms require elucidation.

Martenson M.E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 80Crossref Google Scholar). However, H+ alone (i.e. pH 5.0–6.0) does not activate VR1 in cultured DRG neurons (13Jung J. Hwang S.W. Kwak J. Lee S.Y. Kang C.J. Kim W.B. Kim D. Oh U. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 529-538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chemodenervation with capsaicin has demonstrated that the majority of epidermal “C” type axons belong to the capsaicin/vanilloid-sensitive population of sensory neurons (14Dux M. Sann H. Schemann M. Jancso G. Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 296: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Capsazepine (CPZ), a well known antagonist of vanilloids, reduces hyperalgesic responses to inflammation, indicating that endogenous, vanilloid-like substances may be inhibited from acting viaVR1 (15Kwak J.Y. Jung J.Y. Hwang S.W. Lee W.T. Oh U. Neuroscience. 1998; 86: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Although these nerve endings respond to capsaicin and other plant-derived vanilloids (16Sterner O. Szallasi A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 459-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), the endogenous pain signaling analog(s) of capsaicin have not been fully identified nor has their potential for toxicity been evaluated. Recently, the endocannabinoid, anandamide (ANA), an analog of both eicosanoids and vanilloids, was shown to evoke inward current and depolarization in cells expressing recombinant VR1 (17Zygmunt P.M. Petersson J. Andersson D.A. Chuang H. Sorgard M. Di Marzo V. Julius D. Hogestatt E.D. Nature. 1999; 400: 452-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1859) Google Scholar). Other arachidonic acid metabolites or analogs such as PGE2 and arvanil, which are distant homologs of vanilloids, also are active on both their cognate receptors as well as on VR1 (18Vyklicky L.

It can be hypothesized that eicosanoids need other inflammatory factors, such as tissue acidification for their action on VR1. Thus, conditionally released or otherwise weak endogenous ligands at neutral pH can be potentiated by protonation of VR1. To study the potential role of arachidonic acid metabolites in pain signaling, assays were carried out on cultured DRG neurons and cells expressing C-terminally tagged recombinant versions of VR1. We used two methods to examine ligand-induced VR1 ionophore activity: 45Ca2+uptake from the media and changes in [Ca2+]idetermined with calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye labeling and ratiometric confocal microscopy. Two rat VR1 expression constructs were examined. The first was a short, ε-epitope-tagged VR1 recombinant (VR1ε) stably expressed in NIH 3T3 cells under the control of a weak cellular promoter. The second construct, a VR1-enhanced green fluorescent fusion protein (VR1eGFP), was used for the real time imaging of the dynamics of agonist-induced intracellular membrane remodeling in vivo. We have shown previously that membrane remodeling that involves ER (32Subramanian K. Meyer T. Cell. 1997; 89: 963-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 33Grimaldi M.

Confocal microscopy of vanilloid- or ANA-treated live DRG neurons and VR1eGFP-expressing cells disclosed an elevation of [Ca2+]i, followed by fragmentation of the ER and mitochondria. The eicosanoid-induced Ca2+ toxicity can result in intracellular dysfunction and axonal damage of VR1-positive DRG neurons. If the cell bodies of nociceptors are exposed to ANA or inflammatory eicosanoids, cell death may ensue through toxic accumulation of [Ca2+]i. Our data suggest that low pH acts as a switch to convert VR1 to a form that binds ANA and eicosanoids. Thus, at low pH ANA and eicosanoids can have algesic or pro-algesic effects via VR1 at nociceptive endings as well as contribute to potential neuropathological processes in the peripheral nerve or sensory ganglia. C-terminally tagged chimeric rat VR1eGFP and VR1ε were prepared in the pEGFP-N3 (CLONTECH) and pεMTH (36Olah Z. Lehel C. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) plasmid vectors, respectively, as described (35Olah Z. Szabo T. Karai L. Hough C. Fields R.D. Caudle R.M. Blumberg P.M. Iadarola M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 11021-11030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The plasmid constructs were transiently transfected in COS7, HEK293, and NIH 3T3 cells, and the expressed chimeric VR1 proteins were extensively characterized using biochemical and electrophysiological assays and fluorescence confocal microscopy (35Olah Z. Szabo T. Karai L. Hough C. Fields R.D. Caudle R.M. Blumberg P.M. Iadarola M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 11021-11030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). HEK 293 and COS7 cells (105) were plated on 25-mm glass slides for live cell confocal microscopy or seeded in 24-well plates for calcium transport experiments 1 day before transfection. GenePorter purchased from Gene Therapy Systems (San Diego, CA) was used as the transfection reagent. Transfections were carried out according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. For the 25-mm slides 3 µg and for the 24-well plates 2 µg of DNA/well were used together with 25 and 10 µl of GenePorter reagent, respectively. The DNA and the GenePorter were mixed in serum free Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 15 min at room temperature then placed on the cultured cells. After 3 h at 34 °C the incubation medium was supplemented with an equal volume of complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% streptomycin, and 1% glutamine. To prevent acidification of the culture medium, the pH was buffered to 7.4 with 20 mm HEPES. To diminish heat-induced activation of VR1, cells were cultured in an incubator adjusted to 34 °C. Transient transfected cells with green VR1eGFP fluorescence were counted on an inverted fluorescence microscope or quantified in a microplate fluorimeter at 515 nm, employing the 488 nm absorption band of eGFP. To develop cell lines permanently expressing VR1ε, we used NIH 3T3 cells, which we determined to have a low endogenous level of Ca2+ transport that was not inducible with vanilloids or ANA. To avoid toxicity that occurs with VR1 overexpression, VR1ε was expressed using only the basal activity of the metallothionein (pMTH) promoter. The C-terminal 12-amino acid ε-epitope allowed immunological detection and verification of ectopic expression. To prepare a cell line permanently expressing VR1ε, NIH 3T3 cells were transiently transfected with the pMTH-VR1ε plasmid. After 24 h cells were transferred into 24-well plates and incubated with complete DMEM and selection medium, containing 0.8 mg/ml geneticin (G418) buffered with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) to stabilize the pH. Cell lines expressing VR1ε were selected at 34 °C. In addition, to minimize heat-induced VR1 channel activation and Ca2+cytotoxicity, the selection medium was changed every second day. After 1 month G418-resistant colonies were tested with vanilloid-induced Ca2+ transport assays. A colony exhibiting RTX-induced45Ca2+ uptake 20-fold above the base line determined in comparison with parental NIH3T3 cells was chosen for further studies. DRG neuron-enriched cultures were prepared from embryonic rats (embryonic day 16) (35Olah Z. Szabo T. Karai L. Hough C. Fields R.D. Caudle R.M. Blumberg P.M. Iadarola M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 11021-11030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Briefly, DRGs were dissected and then processed in fresh dissection medium (Lebowitz medium; Life Technologies, Inc.) until plated in DMEM. The DMEM contained 20 mm HEPES (to prevent acidification and stabilize pH at 7.4), 7.5% fetal bovine serum, 7.5% horse serum, 5 mg/ml uridine supplemented with 2 mg/ml 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine, and 40 ng/ml nerve growth factor to inhibit cell division and to promote differentiation of long neuronal processes, respectively. Cells were seeded on 25-mm glass coverslips or on multi-well microtiter plates. Surfaces were coated with poly-d-lysine and laminin. The cultures were selected in this medium for 1 week, at which point well differentiated neurons and nondividing cells dominated the population. Primary DRG cultures in this stage were used in Ca2+transport assays and confocal microscopy. 45Ca2+uptake experiments were carried out on the primary DRG cultures (104 cells/well) after 1 week of neuronal growth factor and 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine treatment and on transiently transfected HEK293 cells (105/well) expressing VR1eGFP for at least 36–48 h. For comparison, 45Ca2+ transport assays were performed on NIH 3T3 cells permanently expressing the ε-tagged VR1 under control of the basal activity of the metallothionein promoter. The cells were washed once in Hanks' balanced salt solution (pH 6.0) supplemented with 10 µm Ca2+ and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (HCB) and adapted to room temperature (24 °C) for 5 min. 45Ca2+ uptake was performed for 10 min at 24 °C in HCB using 0.2 µCi of45Ca2+ as radioactive tracer in a 200-µl final volume. To determine the pH dependence of the45Ca2+ uptake, HCB was buffered with 20 mm Tris-HCl, adjusted to the indicated pH with 1m MES (HCBTM). Anandamide was prepared in a Soya oil/water (1:4) emulsion. RTX and CAP were diluted at least 10,000-fold from 10 mm ethanol stock solutions to the indicated final concentrations. To stop 45Ca2+ uptake, cells were rapidly changed back into 1 ml of HCB, washed two additional times with 1 ml HCB, and then lysed in 200 µl/well RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA) for 30 min. Aliquots of the solubilized cell extracts were counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Transfected HEK293 cells (105/well) expressing VR1eGFP for 48 h were washed once in Ca2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution (pH 6.0) supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (HB). Binding experiments were performed for 40 min at 4 °C in HB, except as radioactive tracer 0.5 µCi of [3H]ANA/ml was added in 500 µl incubation volume. To stop the binding, cells were rapidly changed back into 1 ml of ice-cold HB and washed rapidly two additional times with HB at 4 °C. The cells were lysed and processed for scintillation counting as described for 45Ca2+uptake. An inverted Nikon microscope equipped with the 1024 MRC Bio-Rad laser confocal system was used for fluorescence studies. For ratiometric determination of cytosolic [Ca2+]i DRG cultures were preloaded with 5 µm Indo-1 AM dye. After incubation for 30 min at 34 °C, the cells were washed three times in HCB to remove excess dye and kept in the dark for at least 15 min before starting the experiments. The recordings were carried out in 1 ml of HCB. The ratio of emitted fluorescence intensity at 405 and 485 was calculated from images taken at 10-s intervals. Following of recording of the base line, the drug was added in 100 µl of HCB. To monitor the consequence of drug treatments and the effect of Ca2+ on intracellular membranes, cells were transfected with VR1eGFP. After 1 day and just before microscopy they were loaded with 0.5 µm MitoTracker dye as recommended by the manufacturer (Molecular Probes). Mitochondria and VR1eGFP were observed in live cells by dual fluorescence confocal microscopy employing appropriate filter sets to separate green (VR1eGFP) and red (MitoTracker) epifluorescence. To facilitate drug treatment, the experiments were performed in an open chamber system. Total protein extracts were prepared in denaturing SDS buffer and analyzed for immunoreactivity by Western blotting as described previously (36Olah Z. Lehel C. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). VR1-specific antibody was raised in rabbits immunized with the N-terminal MEQRASLDSEESESPPQE peptide of rat VR1 conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Antigen affinity-purified antibody was diluted 1000-fold for Western blot and immunocytochemistry experiments. This antibody preparation recognizes native rat VR1, as illustrated in Fig. 8, and chimeric VR1eGFP (35Olah Z. Szabo T. Karai L. Hough C. Fields R.D. Caudle R.M. Blumberg P.M. Iadarola M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 11021-11030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Stripping of nitrocellulose blotting filters (Bio-Rad) was carried out in 200 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 2% SDS and 0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol at 65 °C for 1 h. To demonstrate the eGFP portion of VR1eGFP, blots were incubated either with GFP specific rabbit antiserum (CLONTECH) and then with a cytochromec-specific monoclonal antibody as suggested by the manufacturer (PharMingen International) to assess equality of protein loading and transfer. Enhanced chemiluminescence was used to visualize primary antibody binding according to the manufacturer's protocol (New England Biolabs). ANA (1:4 soy bean oil:water emulsion), olvanil (OLV) and RTX were purchased from Tocris. ANA in ethanol, 12(S)HPETE, 12(S)HETE, PGE2, and PGD2 were from Biomol, and CPZ and CAP were obtained from Calbiochem.45Ca was from ICN, and [3H]ANA was purchased from ARC. Concentration-response curves from rat DRG cultures indicated that acidic pH markedly enhanced the actions of ANA on Ca2+uptake (Fig. 1 a). At pH 5.5 and 6.0 the EC50 values of ANA-induced Ca2+transport were determined from Hill plots fitted to the data to be 7 and 10 µm, respectively. At pH ≥ 6.5, Ca2+ uptake in DRG cells did not increase with increasing ANA concentrations, although the base-line Ca2+ uptake was higher at pH 6.5 than at pH 7.0. Application of the highest concentration of vehicle (1:10 dilution of the 1:4 soy oil:water emulsion stock) was without effect on cultured DRG neurons (not shown). The observed effect of ANA was specific to primary nociceptive neurons. No similar pH-dependent, ANA-induced Ca2+uptake was found in embryonic rat spinal cord cultures. In fact, in spinal cord cultures a decrease in pH alone (i.e. pH 5.5) inhibited the short term (10 min) Ca2+ uptake. Furthermore, treatment of spinal cord cultures with the same amounts of ANA did not induce Ca2+ transport (not shown). In NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing VR1ε, Ca2+ uptake assays were carried out at similar pH and ANA concentrations. As with the DRG neurons, ANA treatment at progressively lower pH produced progressively more Ca2+ uptake (Fig. 1 b). The EC50 values of ANA were comparable with those of the DRG neurons: 14 ± 5, 25 ± 5, and 63 ± 12 µm, at pH 5.5, 6.0, and 6.5, respectively, indicating an increasing affinity of VR1 toward ANA at lower pH. At pH ≥ 7.0 little or no effect was found with increasing ANA concentration (Fig. 1 b). In the parental NIH 3T3 cell line, in repeated experiments, H+, ANA, and the vehicle (soy oil:water (1:4) emulsion at a 1:10 dilution) had no effect on basal Ca2+uptake (not shown). The vehicle also did not affect Ca2+uptake in NIH 3T3 cells expressing VR1ε. We next compare at pH 6.0, under mildly acidic conditions, the efficacy of ANA to RTX and CAP, which are known vanilloid agonists. In primary DRG cultures nanomolar RTX or 0.5 µm CAP induced ∼15–20-fold elevation over the basal Ca2+ uptake. Under the same experimental conditions, ANA was effective in the 10–100 µm range, increasing the influx levels more than 3-fold over basal Ca2+ uptake (Fig.2 a). The induction of Ca2+ uptake by 0.01 µm RTX, 1 µm CAP, and 100 µm ANA was almost completely inhibited by 10 µm CPZ, a VR1 antagonist (Fig.2 a). Treatment with maximal amounts of vanilloid vehicle (i.e. final concentration of 0.05% EtOH added with CAP and CPZ) was without effect on the cultured DRG neurons (not shown). The results determined in DRG cultures were compared with VR1-mediated Ca2+ uptake in cells transiently expressing VR1eGFP (35Olah Z. Szabo T. Karai L. Hough C. Fields R.D. Caudle R.M. Blumberg P.M. Iadarola M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 11021-11030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The expression levels of VR1eGFP can be estimated in situ by fluorescence microscopy, which showed that VR1eGFP-transfected cells represented ∼30% of the population. In Fig. 2 b 45Ca2+ uptake experiments in HEK293 cells transiently expressing VR1eGFP are shown. These cultures were treated with increasing concentrations of CAP, RTX, and ANA during the 10-min period of the 45Ca2+ uptake assay. The uptake kinetics of the transfected HEK293 cells were similar to those determined in primary DRG culture (Fig. 2 a). In both cultures, vanilloids increased the 45Ca2+uptake more than 10-fold over base line in nanomolar to micromolar concentrations. In comparison, ANA was somewhat more effective in DRG neurons. At pH 6.0 ANA stimulated 45Ca2+ uptake about 5–10-fold in the 10–100 µm concentration range. The EC50 determined for RTX, CAP, and ANA were about 1.0, 200, and 30,000 nm, respectively (Fig. 2 b). Similar results were obtained with transiently transfected COS7 cells expressing VR1eGFP (not shown). Nontransfected HEK293 or COS7 cells did not show any increase in 45Ca2+ uptake in response to these compounds. In the absence of drug treatment, expression of VR1eGFP in different cell lines usually doubled the basal45Ca2+ uptake, an effect most likely caused by spontaneous channel activity of VR1 (data not shown). H+ dependence of RTX- and ANA-induced Ca2+uptake was studied in side-by-side experiments (Fig.3) using the NIH 3T3 cell line stably expressing VR1ε. Ca2+ uptake assays were carried out in buffered HCBTM in which the pH was adjusted between 7.5 and 5.5 with 1m MES, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Nanomolar RTX and micromolar ANA induced Ca2+ uptake at both high and low pH, although with different characteristics. At pH 5.5 ANA was a full agonist of VR1 and produced maximal transport comparable with nanomolar concentrations of RTX. At pH 7.5, RTX exhibited a lower affinity but produced a much higher maximal Ca2+ uptake. ANA at this pH, even at a 70 µmconcentration, had very low affinity and capacity. These data suggest that VR1 can be protonated and that protonation substantially alters the channel function of VR1. Nontransfected NIH 3T3 cells did not respond to these ligands or acidification of the medium. The activity of other eicosanoids with structural similarity to ANA and the ability of CPZ to antagonize their activity were examined using Ca2+ uptake experiments in primary DRG cultures. The rank order of activity of four eicosanoids was 12(S)HPTE > PGD2 > PGE2, with 12(S)HETE being inactive. Like ANA, these compounds activated45Ca2+ uptake in the micromolar range (5 µm each in this experiment). For each active eicosanoid, the induced 45Ca2+ uptake was completely inhibited by co-treatment with 10 µm CPZ, indicating the vanilloid receptor specificity of the uptake (Fig.4). The direct binding of [3H]ANA to VR1 was investigated in ectopic expression systems. In addition to the CB1 and CB2 cann"

We utilized phage-display technology to identify polypeptides that mimic the binding domains of proteins with which Endostatin interacts.

We show that recombinant human Endostatin binds tropomyosin in vitro and to tropomyosin-associated microfilaments in a variety of endothelial cell types. The most compelling evidence that tropomyosin modulates the activity of Endostatin was demonstrated when E37 blocked greater than 84% of the tumor-growth inhibitory activity of Endostatin in the B16-BL6 metastatic melanoma model. We conclude that the E37 peptide mimics the Endostatin-binding epitope of tropomyosin and blocks the antitumor activity of Endostatin by competing for Endostatin binding.

Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from existing capillaries, is required for tumors to expand beyond 1–2 mm3 in size and is the principal determinant for tumor growth (1Folkman J. N.

In fact, the first demonstration of tumor dormancy was achieved with systemic treatment of rmEndostatin (7Boehm T. Folkman J. Browder T. O'Reilly M.S. Nature. 1997; 390: 404-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar).It is increasingly recognized that alterations in the actin cytoskeleton play a crucial role regulating the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells (8Shuster C.B. Herman I.M. Microcirculation. 1998; 5: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 9Morales-Ruiz M. Fulton D. Sowa G. Languino L.R. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Sessa W.C. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 892-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Tropomyosins are a large family of proteins; at least 20 different isoforms exist that are generated by alternative splicing of a multigene family (Refs. 10Pittenger M.F. Kazzaz J.A. Helfman D.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 11Lin J.J. Warren K.S. Wamboldt D.D. Wang T. Lin J.L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 170: 1-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). They bind the α-helical groove of actin filaments to stabilize actin in the polymerized state directly influencing the integrity of microfilaments and thus play a role regulating reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Tropomyosins have been identified in organisms as diverse as yeast and man and are core components of the cell cytoskeleton. Many vertebrate non-muscle cells express between five and eight isoforms of tropomyosin in a tissue-specific manner, leading to speculation that tropomyosin isoforms may have evolved to perform specific functions in the microfilaments of non-muscle cells. Indeed, mutational analysis indicates that tropomyosin isoforms have distinct functions and that they play important roles in a variety of cellular functions, including contraction, cytokinesis, intracellular transport, secretion, motility, morphogenesis, and cell transformation (Ref. 11Lin J.J. Warren K.S. Wamboldt D.D. Wang T. Lin J.L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 170: 1-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and references therein).The mechanism of action of the antiangiogenic activity of Endostatin is unknown. To elucidate the mode of action of Endostatin, we screened a phage-display library to identify the binding domains of proteins with which Endostatin potentially interacts. Here we present evidence that human tropomyosin isoform 3 (hTM3) shares an epitope with an Endostatin-binding peptide, demonstrate an interaction between rhEndostatin and hTM3 in vitro, and show that rhEndostatin protein binds tropomyosin-containing mircofilaments of endothelial cells. We further show that the peptide mimotope of the hTM3 Endostatin-binding site blocks the antitumor activity of rhEndostatinin vivo and suggest that the antitumor activity of Endostatin results from an interaction with tropomyosin-containing microfilaments that leads to inhibition of microfilament function and an induction of apoptosis.DISCUSSIONWe identified hTM3 as an Endostatin-binding protein. Using an epitope-specific antibody (Fig. 1B) we further demonstrated that the Endostatin-binding epitope of hTM3 is not present in all tropomyosins and consequently that Endostatin-binding is presumably not a characteristic of all tropomyosin isoforms. This finding has broad significance. Endostatin inhibits the growth of tumors by inhibiting endothelial cell function (3O'Reilly M.S. Boehm T. Shing Y. Fukai N. Vasios G. Lane W.S. Flynn E.

Our finding that Endostatin may only affect specific isoforms of tropomyosin provides an explanation for how this tight control could be achieved and maintained. It is possible that specific isoforms of tropomyosin are expressed and regulated in endothelial cells during tumor angiogenesis. We speculate that these specific isoforms bind Endostatin preferentially leading to potent inhibition of tumor growth. We also postulate that expression of such isoforms of tropomyosin that interact with Endostatin with different affinities and dissociation constants provides the natural homeostatic balance of endothelial cell growth under normal physiological conditions.The binding of rhEndostatin to immobilized rhTM3 displays both rapid rates of association and dissociation and a K D of ∼100 μm (Fig. 3A). Similar binding kinetics have been observed between T cell receptors and their cognate ligands on the surfaces of antigen-presenting cells and between the glycosylation-dependent cell-adhesion molecule-1 (GlyCAM-1) and l-selectin (17van der Merwe P.A.

Kinetic analysis of these interactions shows they have relatively low affinities that are also the result of rapid dissociation rates. Such kinetics are suggestive of highly dynamic interactions. It is possible that Endostatin may have higher affinity for an as yet undefined isoform of tropomyosin or that a third, as yet unidentified component is involved in stabilizing the Endostatin/hTM3 interaction in vivo, and that in the presence of this molecule(s) the K Dof binding would be significantly lower.Whereas pharmacokinetic analysis indicates that parenteral administration of rhEndostatin results in circulating levels in the nm range (6Sim B.K.L.

Angiogenesis. 1999; 3: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), local concentrations in the tumor microenvironment may be significantly higher. Planar imaging of mammary tumor-bearing rats following i.v. injection of technetium (99mTc) labeled rhEndostatin (100 μCi/rat) showed that the tumor could be visualized from 0.5–4 h post-injection. 5D. Yang, personal communication. This observation suggests that Endostatin targets the tumor microenvironment and indicates significantly higher Endostatin concentrations at the tumor bed in comparison to circulating levels. These elevated local concentrations may favor the interaction of Endostatin with hTM3 in the tumor vasculature.Whereas normally located intracellularly, tropomyosin has been localized to the surface of colon epithelial cells in ulcerative colitis (20Kesari K.V. Yoshizaki N. Geng X. Lin J.J. Das K.M. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1999; 118: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) but surface expression has not been reported for endothelial cells. This does not eliminate the possibility that tumor endothelial cells more closely resemble damaged colonic epithelium in this regard. Dixelius et al. (13Dixelius J. Larsson H. Sasaki T. Holmqvist K. Lu L. Engstrom A. Timpl R. Welsh M. Claesson-Welsh L. Blood. 2000; 95: 3403-3411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) recently showed that endothelial cells, but not fibroblasts internalized Endostatin by an endocytic pathway. This observation together with well established differences that exist between the endothelial cells of normal and tumor tissues, may explain the anti-endothelial cell activity of Endostatin in vitro and the tumor specificity in vivo. However, the precise mechanism(s) by which endocytosed Endostatin gains access to the cytosolic compartment remains to be elucidated.For the first time we present evidence that links a mechanism of action to the in vivo antitumor activity of Endostatin. Co-injection of the E37 peptide with rhEndostatin resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of the antitumor activity of rhEndostatin in the B16-BL6 experimental metastasis assay (Fig. 6). We postulate that the E37 peptide mimics the Endostatin protein-binding epitope of hTM3 to compete for Endostatin binding and consequently inhibits the antitumor activity of Endostatin.We believe that the antiangiogenic effect of Endostatin is mediated via an interaction with tropomyosin-containing microfilaments. Rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton has been reported to be characteristic of, and sufficient to induce endothelial cell apoptosis (21DeMeester S.L. Cobb J.P. Hotchkiss R.S. Osborne D.F.

Taken together, the ability of rhEndostatin to induce endothelial cell apoptosis (3O'Reilly M.S. Boehm T. Shing Y. Fukai N. Vasios G. Lane W.S. Flynn E. Birkhead J.R. Olsen B.R. Folkman J.

Further observations consistent with Endostatin exerting an effect upon the actin cytoskeleton come from an endothelial cell monolayer-wound assay (6Sim B.K.L. Fogler W.E. Zhou X. Liang H. Madsen J.W. Luu K. O'Reilly M.S. Tomaszewski J. Fortier A.H. Angiogenesis. 1999; 3: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 25Sato Y. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1199-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). In this assay, cell migration at the wound edge has been correlated with increased incorporation of monomeric actin into filaments and a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (26Moldovan L. Moldovan N.I. Sohn R.H. Parikh S.A. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Endostatin binding to microfilaments may inhibit the cytoskeletal reorganization required for cell migration, leading to an inhibition of migration.Whereas the mechanism by which the Endostatin and hTM3 interaction may induce endothelial cell apoptosis is poorly defined, tropomyosin and the cytoskeleton have critical roles in cell survival. Ingber and co-workers (27Ingber D.E. Folkman J. Cell. 1989; 58: 803-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 28Ingber D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Prusty D. Frangioni J.V. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Lechene C. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1803-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Progression through the cell cycle is inhibited following disruption of the cytoskeleton or by release of cytoplasmic tension, implicating the actin-based cytoskeleton and its ability to generate tension against integrin-ECM contacts in the regulation of endothelial cell cycle progression and cell fate (29Huang S. Chen C.S. Ingber D.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3179-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 32Pourati J. Maniotis A. Spiegel D. Schaffer J.L. Butler J.P. Fredberg J.J. Ingber D.E. Stamenovic D. Wang N. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1283-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we surmise that Endostatin, which has been reported to regulate cell cycle progression in endothelial cells (13Dixelius J. Larsson H. Sasaki T. Holmqvist K. Lu L. Engstrom A. Timpl R. Welsh M. Claesson-Welsh L. Blood. 2000; 95: 3403-3411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Dhanabal M. Volk R. Ramchandran R. Simons M. Sukhatme V.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), may bind cytoskeletal tropomyosin leading to a release of cytoskeletal tension and subsequent induction of cell apoptosis.Our data indicate that Endostatin exerts its antitumor and antiangiogenic effects as a result of its interaction with tropomyosin isoforms containing the E37 mimotope. We suggest that this interaction leads to disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, that blocks cell migration and contributes to the induction of apoptosis. Interestingly troponin I, better known for its role in muscle contraction where it forms a regulatory complex with troponin T, troponin C, and tropomyosin, has been identified as cartilage-derived inhibitor of tumor angiogenesis and metastasis (33Moses M.A. Wiederschain D. Wu I. Fernandez C.A. Ghazizadeh V. Lane W.S. Flynn E. Sytkowski A. Tao T. Langer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2645-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Troponin I is the actin-binding component of the troponin complex, and thus may inhibit endothelial cells via an interaction with microfilaments that disrupts cytoskeletal function. Thus, troponin I and Endostatin may represent a family of naturally occurring antiangiogenic proteins that block microfilament function.We recognize that the antiangiogenic activity of Endostatin is complex and potentially involves multiple mechanistic pathways, the convergence of which results in the inhibition of endothelial cell migration, proliferation, differentiation, and an induction of apoptosis. Our study has identified tropomyosin as an Endostatin-binding protein, thus providing a mechanism that may explain the antitumor activity of Endostatin. Endothelial cells rapidly internalize Endostatin (13Dixelius J. Larsson H. Sasaki T. Holmqvist K. Lu L. Engstrom A. Timpl R. Welsh M. Claesson-Welsh L. Blood. 2000; 95: 3403-3411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we showed here that rhEndostatin and tropomyosin co-localize to the microfilaments of formalin-fixed human endothelial cells (Fig. 4). The biological relevance of the tropomyosin/rhEndostatin interaction to the antiangiogenic activity of Endostatin was demonstrated by blocking antitumor activity of rhEndostatin with a peptide mimotope of tropomyosin. We postulate that the antiangiogenic activity of Endostatin may result, at least in part, from internalization of Endostatin by endothelial cells and its subsequent interaction with tropomyosin; leading to a disruption of microfilament integrity, inhibition of cell motility and induction of apoptosis, and ultimately tumor growth inhibition. Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from existing capillaries, is required for tumors to expand beyond 1–2 mm3 in size and is the principal determinant for tumor growth (1Folkman J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1971; 285: 1182-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 2Folkman J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 4-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar). Consequently, antiangiogenic molecules offer promise as novel therapeutic modalities for the treatment of cancer. Endostatin, a 20-kDa cleavage fragment of collagen XVIII first identified in the conditioned medium of hemangioendothelioma cells (3O'Reilly M.S. Boehm T. Shing Y. Fukai N. Vasios G. Lane W.S. Flynn E. Birkhead J.R. Olsen B.R. Folkman J.

Fortier A.H. Angiogenesis. 1999; 3: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Both recombinant murine (rm) and rhEndostatin have been successfully produced and shown to inhibit endothelial cell proliferation and migration in vitro, as well as tumor growth in in vivo tumor models (3O'Reilly M.S.

Luu K. O'Reilly M.S. Tomaszewski J. Fortier A.H. Angiogenesis. 1999; 3: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In fact, the first demonstration of tumor dormancy was achieved with systemic treatment of rmEndostatin (7Boehm T. Folkman J. Browder T. O'Reilly M.S. Nature. 1997; 390: 404-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar). It is increasingly recognized that alterations in the actin cytoskeleton play a crucial role regulating the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells (8Shuster C.B. Herman I.M. Microcirculation. 1998; 5: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 9Morales-Ruiz M. Fulton D. Sowa G. Languino L.R. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Sessa W.C. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 892-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Tropomyosins are a large family of proteins; at least 20 different isoforms exist that are generated by alternative splicing of a multigene family (Refs. 10Pittenger M.F. Kazzaz J.A. Helfman D.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 11Lin J.J. Warren K.S. Wamboldt D.D. Wang T. Lin J.L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 170: 1-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). They bind the α-helical groove of actin filaments to stabilize actin in the polymerized state directly influencing the integrity of microfilaments and thus play a role regulating reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Tropomyosins have been identified in organisms as diverse as yeast and man and are core components of the cell cytoskeleton. Many vertebrate non-muscle cells express between five and eight isoforms of tropomyosin in a tissue-specific manner, leading to speculation that tropomyosin isoforms may have evolved to perform specific functions in the microfilaments of non-muscle cells. Indeed, mutational analysis indicates that tropomyosin isoforms have distinct functions and that they play important roles in a variety of cellular functions, including contraction, cytokinesis, intracellular transport, secretion, motility, morphogenesis, and cell transformation (Ref. 11Lin J.J. Warren K.S. Wamboldt D.D. Wang T. Lin J.L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 170: 1-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). The mechanism of action of the antiangiogenic activity of Endostatin is unknown. To elucidate the mode of action of Endostatin, we screened a phage-display library to identify the binding domains of proteins with which Endostatin potentially interacts. Here we present evidence that human tropomyosin isoform 3 (hTM3) shares an epitope with an Endostatin-binding peptide, demonstrate an interaction between rhEndostatin and hTM3 in vitro, and show that rhEndostatin protein binds tropomyosin-containing mircofilaments of endothelial cells. We further show that the peptide mimotope of the hTM3 Endostatin-binding site blocks the antitumor activity of rhEndostatinin vivo and suggest that the antitumor activity of Endostatin results from an interaction with tropomyosin-containing microfilaments that leads to inhibition of microfilament function and an induction of apoptosis. DISCUSSIONWe identified hTM3 as an Endostatin-binding protein. Using an epitope-specific antibody (Fig. 1B) we further demonstrated that the Endostatin-binding epitope of hTM3 is not present in all tropomyosins and consequently that Endostatin-binding is presumably not a characteristic of all tropomyosin isoforms. This finding has broad significance. Endostatin inhibits the growth of tumors by inhibiting endothelial cell function (3O'Reilly M.S. Boehm T. Shing Y. Fukai N. Vasios G. Lane W.S. Flynn E.

Systemic rhEndostatin therapy was shown to induce a 50% reduction of intratumoral blood flow whereas other non-tumor affected organs in the same animal were unaffected. 4D. R. Sørensen, T. A. Read, T. Porosol, B. R. Olsen, R. Timpl, T. Sasaki, P. O. Iversen, H. B. Benestad, B. K. L. Sim, and R. Bjerkvig, manuscript in preparation. Furthermore, other events that require angiogenesis such as wound healing remained unaffected by rhEndostatin (15Berger A.C. Feldman A.L. Gnant M.F. Kruger E.A. Sim B.K. Hewitt S. Figg W.D.

FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2373-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the antiangiogenic effects of Endostatin are tightly controlled. Our finding that Endostatin may only affect specific isoforms of tropomyosin provides an explanation for how this tight control could be achieved and maintained. It is possible that specific isoforms of tropomyosin are expressed and regulated in endothelial cells during tumor angiogenesis. We speculate that these specific isoforms bind Endostatin preferentially leading to potent inhibition of tumor growth. We also postulate that expression of such isoforms of tropomyosin that interact with Endostatin with different affinities and dissociation constants provides the natural homeostatic balance of endothelial cell growth under normal physiological conditions.The binding of rhEndostatin to immobilized rhTM3 displays both rapid rates of association and dissociation and a K D of ∼100 μm (Fig. 3A).

We suggest that this interaction leads to disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, that blocks cell migration and contributes to the induction of apoptosis. Interestingly troponin I, better known for its role in muscle contraction where it forms a regulatory complex with troponin T, troponin C, and tropomyosin, has been identified as cartilage-derived inhibitor of tumor angiogenesis and metastasis (33Moses M.A. Wiederschain D. Wu I. Fernandez C.A. Ghazizadeh V. Lane W.S. Flynn E. Sytkowski A. Tao T. Langer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2645-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Troponin I is the actin-binding component of the troponin complex, and thus may inhibit endothelial cells via an interaction with microfilaments that disrupts cytoskeletal function. Thus, troponin I and Endostatin may represent a family of naturally occurring antiangiogenic proteins that block microfilament function.We recognize that the antiangiogenic activity of Endostatin is complex and potentially involves multiple mechanistic pathways, the convergence of which results in the inhibition of endothelial cell migration, proliferation, differentiation, and an induction of apoptosis. Our study has identified tropomyosin as an Endostatin-binding protein, thus providing a mechanism that may explain the antitumor activity of Endostatin. Endothelial cells rapidly internalize Endostatin (13Dixelius J. Larsson H. Sasaki T. Holmqvist K. Lu L. Engstrom A. Timpl R. Welsh M. Claesson-Welsh L. Blood. 2000; 95: 3403-3411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we showed here that rhEndostatin and tropomyosin co-localize to the microfilaments of formalin-fixed human endothelial cells (Fig. 4). The biological relevance of the tropomyosin/rhEndostatin interaction to the antiangiogenic activity of Endostatin was demonstrated by blocking antitumor activity of rhEndostatin with a peptide mimotope of tropomyosin. We postulate that the antiangiogenic activity of Endostatin may result, at least in part, from internalization of Endostatin by endothelial cells and its subsequent interaction with tropomyosin; leading to a disruption of microfilament integrity, inhibition of cell motility and induction of apoptosis, and ultimately tumor growth inhibition. We identified hTM3 as an Endostatin-binding protein. Using an epitope-specific antibody (Fig. 1B) we further demonstrated that the Endostatin-binding epitope of hTM3 is not present in all tropomyosins and consequently that Endostatin-binding is presumably not a characteristic of all tropomyosin isoforms. This finding has broad significance. Endostatin inhibits the growth of tumors by inhibiting endothelial cell function (3O'Reilly M.S. Boehm T. Shing Y. Fukai N. Vasios G. Lane W.S. Flynn E.

Systemic rhEndostatin therapy was shown to induce a 50% reduction of intratumoral blood flow whereas other non-tumor affected organs in the same animal were unaffected. 4D. R. Sørensen, T. A. Read, T. Porosol, B. R. Olsen, R. Timpl, T. Sasaki, P. O. Iversen, H. B. Benestad, B. K. L. Sim, and R. Bjerkvig, manuscript in preparation. Furthermore, other events that require angiogenesis such as wound healing remained unaffected by rhEndostatin (15Berger A.C. Feldman A.L. Gnant M.F. Kruger E.A. Sim B.K. Hewitt S. Figg W.D.

FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2373-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the antiangiogenic effects of Endostatin are tightly controlled. Our finding that Endostatin may only affect specific isoforms of tropomyosin provides an explanation for how this tight control could be achieved and maintained. It is possible that specific isoforms of tropomyosin are expressed and regulated in endothelial cells during tumor angiogenesis. We speculate that these specific isoforms bind Endostatin preferentially leading to potent inhibition of tumor growth. We also postulate that expression of such isoforms of tropomyosin that interact with Endostatin with different affinities and dissociation constants provides the natural homeostatic balance of endothelial cell growth under normal physiological conditions. The binding of rhEndostatin to immobilized rhTM3 displays both rapid rates of association and dissociation and a K D of ∼100 μm (Fig. 3A). Similar binding kinetics have been observed between T cell receptors and their cognate ligands on the surfaces of antigen-presenting cells and between the glycosylation-dependent cell-adhesion molecule-1 (GlyCAM-1) and l-selectin (17van der Merwe P.A. Brown M.H. Davis S.J. Barclay A.N. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4945-4954Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 18Silkowski H. Davis S.J. Barclay A.N. Rowe A.J. Harding S.E. Byron O. Eur. Biophys.

Chem. 1998; 273: 763-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis of these interactions shows they have relatively low affinities that are also the result of rapid dissociation rates. Such kinetics are suggestive of highly dynamic interactions. It is possible that Endostatin may have higher affinity for an as yet undefined isoform of tropomyosin or that a third, as yet unidentified component is involved in stabilizing the Endostatin/hTM3 interaction in vivo, and that in the presence of this molecule(s) the K Dof binding would be significantly lower. Whereas pharmacokinetic analysis indicates that parenteral administration of rhEndostatin results in circulating levels in the nm range (6Sim B.K.L. Fogler W.E. Zhou X. Liang H. Madsen J.W. Luu K. O'Reilly M.S. Tomaszewski J. Fortier A.H. Angiogenesis. 1999; 3: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), local concentrations in the tumor microenvironment may be significantly higher. Planar imaging of mammary tumor-bearing rats following i.v. injection of technetium (99mTc) labeled rhEndostatin (100 μCi/rat) showed that the tumor could be visualized from 0.5–4 h post-injection. 5D. Yang, personal communication. This observation suggests that Endostatin targets the tumor microenvironment and indicates significantly higher Endostatin concentrations at the tumor bed in comparison to circulating levels. These elevated local concentrations may favor the interaction of Endostatin with hTM3 in the tumor vasculature. Whereas normally located intracellularly, tropomyosin has been localized to the surface of colon epithelial cells in ulcerative colitis (20Kesari K.V. Yoshizaki N. Geng X. Lin J.J. Das K.M. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1999; 118: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) but surface expression has not been reported for endothelial cells. This does not eliminate the possibility that tumor endothelial cells more closely resemble damaged colonic epithelium in this regard. Dixelius et al. (13Dixelius J. Larsson H. Sasaki T. Holmqvist K. Lu L. Engstrom A. Timpl R. Welsh M. Claesson-Welsh L. Blood. 2000; 95: 3403-3411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) recently showed that endothelial cells, but not fibroblasts internalized Endostatin by an endocytic pathway. This observation together with well established differences that exist between the endothelial cells of normal and tumor tissues, may explain the anti-endothelial cell activity of Endostatin in vitro and the tumor specificity in vivo. However, the precise mechanism(s) by which endocytosed Endostatin gains access to the cytosolic compartment remains to be elucidated. For the first time we present evidence that links a mechanism of action to the in vivo antitumor activity of Endostatin. Co-injection of the E37 peptide with rhEndostatin resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of the antitumor activity of rhEndostatin in the B16-BL6 experimental metastasis assay (Fig. 6). We postulate that the E37 peptide mimics the Endostatin protein-binding epitope of hTM3 to compete for Endostatin binding and consequently inhibits the antitumor activity of Endostatin. We believe that the antiangiogenic effect of Endostatin is mediated via an interaction with tropomyosin-containing microfilaments. Rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton has been reported to be characteristic of, and sufficient to induce endothelial cell apoptosis (21DeMeester S.L. Cobb J.P. Hotchkiss R.S. Osborne D.F.

Taken together, the ability of rhEndostatin to induce endothelial cell apoptosis (3O'Reilly M.S. Boehm T. Shing Y. Fukai N. Vasios G. Lane W.S. Flynn E. Birkhead J.R. Olsen B.R. Folkman J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 11721-11726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar) and our observations that rhEndostatin binds tropomyosin-containing mircofilaments, suggests that Endostatin disrupts microfilament function to initiate apoptosis. Further observations consistent with Endostatin exerting an effect upon the actin cytoskeleton come from an endothelial cell monolayer-wound assay (6Sim B.K.L. Fogler W.E. Zhou X. Liang H. Madsen J.W. Luu K. O'Reilly M.S. Tomaszewski J. Fortier A.H. Angiogenesis. 1999; 3: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 25Sato Y. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1199-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). In this assay, cell migration at the wound edge has been correlated with increased incorporation of monomeric actin into filaments and a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (26Moldovan L. Moldovan N.I. Sohn R.H. Parikh S.A. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Endostatin binding to microfilaments may inhibit the cytoskeletal reorganization required for cell migration, leading to an inhibition of migration. Whereas the mechanism by which the Endostatin and hTM3 interaction may induce endothelial cell apoptosis is poorly defined, tropomyosin and the cytoskeleton have critical roles in cell survival. Ingber and co-workers (27Ingber D.E. Folkman J. Cell. 1989; 58: 803-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 28Ingber D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Prusty D. Frangioni J.V. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Lechene C. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1803-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Progression through the cell cycle is inhibited following disruption of the cytoskeleton or by release of cytoplasmic tension, implicating the actin-based cytoskeleton and its ability to generate tension against integrin-ECM contacts in the regulation of endothelial cell cycle progression and cell fate (29Huang S. Chen C.S. Ingber D.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3179-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 32Pourati J. Maniotis A. Spiegel D. Schaffer J.L. Butler J.P. Fredberg J.J. Ingber D.E.

Thus, we surmise that Endostatin, which has been reported to regulate cell cycle progression in endothelial cells (13Dixelius J. Larsson H. Sasaki T. Holmqvist K. Lu L. Engstrom A. Timpl R. Welsh M.

The guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos mediates the activation of Ras in response to extracellular signals. We have previously solved the crystal structure of nucleotide-free Ras in complex with the catalytic domain of Sos (Boriack-Sjodin, P. A., Margarit, S. M., Bar-Sagi, D., and Kuriyan, J. (1998)Nature 394, 337–343). The structure demonstrates that Sos induces conformational changes in two loop regions of Ras known as switch 1 and switch 2. In this study, we have employed site-directed mutagenesis to investigate the functional significance of the conformational changes for the catalytic function of Sos. Switch 2 of Ras is held in a very tight embrace by Sos, with almost every external side chain coordinated by Sos. Mutagenesis of contact residues at the switch 2-Sos interface shows that only a small set of side chains affect binding, with the most important contact being mediated by tyrosine 64, which is buried in a hydrophobic pocket of Sos in the Ras·Sos complex. Substitutions of Ras and Sos side chains that are inserted into the Mg2+- and nucleotide phosphate-binding site of switch 2 (Ras Ala59 and Sos Leu938 and Glu942) have no effect on the catalytic function of Sos. These results indicate that the interaction of Sos with switch 2 is necessary for tight binding, but is not the critical driving force for GDP displacement. The structural distortion of switch 1 induced by Sos is mediated by a small number of specific contacts between highly conserved residues on both Ras and Sos. Mutations of a subset of these residues (Ras Tyr32 and Tyr40) result in an increase in the intrinsic rate of nucleotide dissociation from Ras and impair the binding of Ras to Sos. Based on this analysis, we propose that the interactions of Sos with the switch 1 and switch 2 regions of Ras have distinct functional consequences: the interaction with switch 2 mediates the anchoring of Ras to Sos, whereas the interaction with switch 1 leads to disruption of the nucleotide-binding site and GDP dissociation.

The conversion of Ras·GDP to Ras·GTP following receptor activation is catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)1; and in the context of receptor tyrosine kinases, this process is dependent on the Sos (Son of sevenless) GEF (1Bar-Sagi D. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 5: 165-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells contain two sos genes,sos1 and sos2, encoding highly relatedM r 150,000 proteins (2Chardin P. Mattei M.G. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1994; 66: 68-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The Ras-specific guanine nucleotide exchange activity of Sos proteins is mediated by a central region of ∼450 amino acids that is structurally and functionally related to the catalytic domain of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ras exchanger Cdc25 and has been designated the Cdc25 homology domain (2Chardin P.

This domain is flanked at the N terminus by 600 amino acids containing a Dbl homology domain and a pleckstrin homology domain and at the C terminus by 300 amino acids containing proline-rich SH3 domain-binding sites.

Although specific residues within these regions have been shown to be critical for either GEF binding or GEF responsiveness, the molecular mechanisms underlying these requirements have not been established. Likewise, the sites on GEFs that are required for interactions with Ras remain undefined. We have previously determined the crystal structure of human Ha-Ras (Ras) complexed with the catalytic region of Sos, hereafter referred to as Sos (33Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). The structure reveals that the interface between Ras and Sos is extensive, encompassing >30 contacting side chains. The switch 1 region of Ras is displaced by a helical hairpin structure of Sos (α-H and α-I), resulting in the opening of the nucleotide-binding site. The switch 2 region of Ras is held tightly by Sos through a cluster of hydrophobic interactions surrounded by polar and charged interactions. The structural changes induced by these interactions result in the insertion of side chains of Ras and Sos into the nucleotide phosphate- and Mg2+-binding sites. In this study, we have utilized the information derived from the crystal structure to test specific predictions concerning the functional interactions between Ras and Sos. By analyzing the biochemical properties of Ras and Sos proteins harboring single amino acid substitutions, we have identified residues that play a role in the activation of Ras by Sos. All Ras constructs contained full-length Ha-Ras (amino acids 1–188), and all Sos constructs contained the Sos catalytic domain (amino acids 564–1049). Point mutations in both Ras and Sos were produced via a polymerase chain reaction-based strategy. Primers encoding each individual mutation were mixed with the template gene in the presence of Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and exposed to 30 rounds of polymerase chain reaction in a Robocycler Gradient 96 (Stratagene). Mutations were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing using a T7 Sequenase kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Ras constructs were subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at cloning sites BamHI andEcoRI, which allow the expression of genes fused to an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag. Sos catalytic domain constructs were cloned into the bacterial expression vector pET-28 (Novagen) at cloning sites BamHI andXhoI, which allow the expression of genes fused to a polyhistidine tag and a T7 epitope tag. The bacterial expression plasmids were transformed into the BL21 strain of Escherichia coli. GST-Ras fusion proteins and polyhistidine-tagged Sos proteins were expressed in E. coliBL21 by induction with 500 µM isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a cell density absorbance of A 600 = 0.5. Pellets were resuspended in buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 200 mm NaCl, 2 µm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% aprotinin, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm benzamidine, 10 µg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 10 µg/ml pepstatin and sonicated using a Branson Cell Disrupter 200. Expressed proteins were purified by affinity chromatography. Lysates containing polyhistidine-tagged Sos proteins were incubated with charged nickel resin (Invitrogen), and lysates containing GST-Ras fusion proteins were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C for 30 min. The resins were washed five times in the resuspension buffer. Ras proteins were eluted with buffer containing 10 mm glutathione in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6) and 200 mm NaCl, and Sos proteins were eluted with buffer containing 200 mm imidazole in 20 mmTris (pH 7.6) and 200 mm NaCl. Eluates were dialyzed against buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6) and 200 mm NaCl. GST-Ras fusion protein (100 nm) and the indicated amount of T7-tagged Sos protein were added to 1 ml of binding buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmEDTA, and 1% Triton X-100) and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. Following incubation, 60 µl of 1:1 slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads resuspended in binding buffer were added to each sample. Samples were incubated for an additional 20 min at 4 °C. Beads were subsequently pelleted, washed five times with binding buffer, and resuspended in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blots were probed with anti-T7 antibody (diluted 1:10,000; Novagen) to detect Sos. Changes in binding affinity were assessed via comparing the amount of Sos precipitated by mutant and wild-type proteins. GST-Ras fusion proteins were loaded with labeled guanine nucleotide by incubating 40 pmol of Ras in 100 µl of buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA with 200 pmol of [3H]GDP (25–50 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or 200 pmol of [α-32P]GTP (25 Ci/mmol; ICN) for 15 min at 30 °C on a Thermoshaker. Following incubation, MgCl2 was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated on ice for 10 min. The dissociation reaction was initiated by adding 100 µl of ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 50 mmNaCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm GTPγS with or without Sos protein. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C, with 20-µl aliquots being removed at indicated time points, and terminated by adding 1 ml of ice-cold stop solution (20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, and 15 mm MgCl2). Stopped reactions were filtered through 0.45-µm nitrocellulose filter discs (Millipore HAWPO2500), which were washed twice with 15 ml of ice-cold stop solution. Radioactivity retained was measured in a Packard Instrument 1900TR liquid scintillation analyzer using 10 ml of Scintiverse scintillation fluid/filter. Data points were plotted and curve-fitted using the SigmaPlot Version 5.0 program (SPSS Inc.). Fig. 1 Aillustrates the general architecture of the Ras·Sos complex. As can been seen, the interaction between the two proteins is predominantly mediated by the switch 1 and switch 2 regions of Ras (33Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the Ras·Sos complex shows that the switch 2 region of Ras is coordinated extensively by Sos through hydrophobic, polar, and charged interactions. We have employed site-directed mutagenesis to examine the role of these interactions in Ras-Sos binding. In the Ras·Sos complex, the side chain of Tyr64 of Ras is inserted into a hydrophobic pocket created by Ile825, Leu872, and Phe929 of Sos (Fig. 1 B). To determine the contribution of these hydrophobic interactions to Ras-Sos binding, we first mutated Tyr64 of Ras to Ala (Y64A). GST fusion proteins of wild-type Ras and Y64A Ras were immobilized on glutathione beads and incubated with increasing concentrations of purified T7-tagged Sos. The amount of bound Sos was then assessed by immunoblotting with anti-T7 antibodies. The Y64A mutation resulted in a decrease of at least 50-fold in the apparent binding affinities of Ras for Sos (Fig. 1 C), but had no effect on the intrinsic rate of nucleotide dissociation of Ras alone (data not shown). Next, we mutated Phe929 of Sos to Ala (F929A) and performed a similar binding assay using wild-type Ras. Similar to the Y64A mutation, the F929A Sos mutant displayed a reduction of >50-fold in binding affinity for Ras (Fig.1 C). These observations indicate that Tyr64mediates hydrophobic contacts that are essential for the formation of a stable Ras·Sos complex. In contrast, polar and charged interactions appear to contribute much less to the binding affinity of Ras for Sos, as indicated by the observation that single alanine substitutions of Sos residues Glu1002, Thr935, and Arg826 exerted a relatively small effect on Ras binding and activation (Fig. 2, A–C).Figure 2Role of switch 2-mediated charged and polar interactions in Sos binding and guanine nucleotide exchange activity. A, ribbon representation of the interface between Ras switch 2 and Sos. The backbone traces of Ras switch 2 (residues 57–70) and Sos (α-B, α-K, and α-H; residues 805–832, 935–944, and 998–1006) are shown in yellow and green, respectively. Side chain groups of Sos residues that have been mutated and the contacting Ras residues are colored white andred, respectively. B, effects of alanine mutations of Sos residues Glu1002, Arg826, and Thr935 on Ras binding. GST-wild-type Ras fusion protein (100 nm) was incubated with increasing concentrations of the indicated T7-tagged wild-type or mutant Sos proteins. Ras·Sos complexes were isolated by incubation with glutathione-Sepharose beads. Bound material was eluted, and the amount of associated Sos was determined by blotting with anti-T7 antibodies. Data shown are from a single experiment and are representative of three independent experiments. C, effects of alanine mutations of Sos residues Glu1002, Arg826, and Thr935 on guanine nucleotide exchange activity. Ras protein (40 pmol) was loaded with [3H]GDP and incubated with 40 pmol of the indicated mutant Sos proteins and excess unlabeled GTPγS for 10 min at 30 °C. Following incubation, the radioactivity remaining bound to Ras was determined by a nitrocellulose filter assay. Results are expressed as percentages of the [3H]GDP dissociation stimulated by wild-type Sos. Each value is the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The backbone conformation of the switch 2 region of Ras is significantly altered in the presence of Sos. One of the consequences of this structural remodeling is that the orientation of Ala59 of Ras is changed such that its methyl side chain now occupies the Mg2+-binding site. To investigate whether the occlusion of the Mg2+-binding site resulting from this conformational change is of consequence for the guanine nucleotide exchange reaction, we replaced Ala59 of Ras with Gly (A59G). This substitution was chosen because glycine is the only residue lacking a methyl side chain and therefore would be expected not to occlude the Mg2+-binding site. The A59G Ras protein appeared equivalent to wild-type Ras in its ability to bind to Sos (Fig. 3 A). We next tested whether the A59G mutation influences Sos-mediated guanine nucleotide exchange. For this purpose, purified wild-type and A59G Ras proteins were first complexed with 3H-labeled GDP or32P-labeled GTP and then diluted in buffer containing Sos and excess unlabeled GTP. Aliquots were taken at different intervals, and the amount of protein-bound radioactive nucleotide was measured by nitrocellulose filtration and scintillation counting. As shown in Fig.3 B, the rate of Sos-catalyzed GDP dissociation was not altered by the A59G mutation. In contrast, the A59G mutant displayed a >50% inhibition of Sos-catalyzed GTP dissociation. This inhibitory effect was partially abolished by lowering the free Mg2+concentration from 10 mm to 1 µm (Fig.3 C), suggesting that the displacement of Mg2+ by Ala59 is a critical step in Sos-catalyzed GTP (but not GDP) dissociation. Helix α-H of Sos presents two residues, Leu938 and Glu942, that interfere with Mg2+ and phosphate binding, respectively. Leu938 is inserted into the Mg2+-binding site, and Glu942 forms a hydrogen bond with Ser17 of Ras, thereby displacing the α-phosphate of GDP. To determine the contribution of these interactions to the guanine nucleotide exchange reaction, Leu938 and Glu942 were both replaced by alanines. As shown in Fig. 3 (D and E), these mutations interfered only slightly with the exchange and binding activities of Sos for either wild-type Ras or the A59G mutant. These results suggest that the destabilization of Mg2+ and phosphate coordination resulting from the molecular contacts between Sos and the switch 2 region of Ras is not critical for Sos-catalyzed GDP dissociation. The most pronounced structural change in Ras following the binding of Sos is the displacement of switch 1 from the nucleotide-binding site. This change is mediated by the insertion of a helical hairpin formed by helices H and I of Sos into the switch 1 region. Tyr32 of Ras forms hydrophobic contacts with Lys939 of Sos, and Tyr40 of Ras makes a stacking interaction with His911 of Sos (Fig.4 A). To investigate the role of the switch 1 region in the interaction with Sos, Tyr32and Tyr40 of Ras were mutated to Ser (Y32S) and Ala (Y40A), respectively. As shown in Fig. 4 B, both the Y32S and Y40A mutations reduced the binding of Sos to Ras, suggesting that these residues are important for Ras-Sos recognition. Consistent with this interpretation, alanine substitutions of Sos Lys939 and His911 also resulted in a decrease in Ras-Sos binding (Fig.4 B). In addition, the Y32S and Y40A Ras mutations accelerated the rate of intrinsic GDP/GTP exchange by factors of 2 and 4, respectively, indicating that the contacts mediated by these residues contribute to nucleotide stabilization (Fig. 4 C). The Y40A mutation had no significant effect on Sos-catalyzed guanine nucleotide exchange (Fig. 4 D), whereas the disruption of the contact between Tyr32 of Ras and Lys939 of Sos reduced the sensitivity of Ras to the exchange activity of Sos (Fig. 4,E and F). This effect persisted even when the concentration of Sos in the reaction was increased 10-fold (Fig. 4,E and F), indicating that the defect in Sos-mediated guanine nucleotide exchange displayed by these mutants cannot be attributed solely to a reduction in binding affinity. In an attempt to examine whether switch 1 and switch 2 mutations have an additive effect on Sos-catalyzed exchange, we generated a G59A/Y40A Ras double mutant. This mutant displayed a severe defect in Sos binding and thus could not be utilized for further analysis. The crystal structure of the Ras·Sos complex identifies two structural domains within the exchange factor region of Sos: an N-terminal domain (residues 568–741) that does not have direct contacts with Ras and a C-terminal domain containing all the residues that interact with Ras. The N-terminal domain consists of six α-helices, two of which, helices α-1 and α-2, form a hydrophobic groove containing Leu609 and Phe623, into which two conserved hydrophobic residues from the helical hairpin, Ile956 and Phe958, are inserted (Fig.5 A). These hydrophobic interactions would be predicted to be important for the stability and correct orientation of the helical hairpin structure. To investigate the significance of the interaction between the N-terminal domain and the helical hairpin structure for the catalytic activity of Sos, Ile956 of the helical hairpin and Phe623 of the N-terminal domain were individually mutated to Glu (I956E and F623E, respectively). As shown in Fig. 5 (B and C), the I956E Sos mutant was slightly defective in Ras binding, but displayed a pronounced decrease in exchange activity. The F623E Sos mutant showed no apparent defect in Ras binding (Fig. 5 B), but it did display a decrease in exchange activity (Fig. 5 D). These results indicate that the N-terminal domain plays a role in maintaining Sos in a catalytically active conformation. In this study, we have investigated the interaction of Ras with its GEF Sos using structure-guided mutagenesis. In agreement with earlier predictions, the three-dimensional structure of the Ras·Sos complex identifies the switch 2 region of Ras as a potential binding site for Sos (33Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). The binding interface between switch 2 and Sos consists of both hydrophobic and polar intermolecular contacts. Individual replacement of contact residues with alanine showed that the binding affinity is mediated principally by Tyr64 of Ras, which is inserted into a hydrophobic pocket of Sos formed by Phe929, Leu872, and Ile825. Phe929 is highly conserved among GEFs for members of the Ras family; and in a recent study, it has been shown that Phe64 of Rap1A is important for its interaction with the C3G exchange factor (34vandenBerge N. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11078-11085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition, the structure of Rac1 in complex with Tiam1 shows that Tyr64 of Rac is buried in a hydrophobic pocket formed by Tiam1 (35Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Sondek J. Nature. 2000; 408: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). This suggests that the binding reaction between Ras-related proteins and their GEFs might be governed by similar affinity determinants. The hydrophobic contact region between Ras and Sos is surrounded by polar and charged residues (Glu1002, Arg826, and Thr935) whose mutation to alanine had little effect on binding affinity or guanine nucleotide exchange activity. Thus, rather then contributing directly to binding energy, these polar contacts might be important for the specificity and/or reversibility of the binding interaction between Ras and Sos. A mutation of the residue analogous to Arg826 of Sos in the yeast Ras-specific GEF Cdc25 has been reported to interfere with its binding to Ras (28Park W. Mosteller R.D. Broek D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8117-8122Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and a mutation of the residue analogous to Sos Thr935 in the mammalian Ras-specific GEF CDC25Mm has been reported to abolish catalytic activity (36Vanoni M. Bertini R. Sacco E. Fontanella L. Rieppi M. Colombo S. Martegani E. Carrera V. Moroni A. Bizzarri C. Sabbatini V. Cattozzo M. Colagrande A. Alberghina L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36656-36662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The discrepancy between these findings and our observations might be due to differences in protein constructs and experimental conditions used to assay the biochemical properties of the GEF mutants. Several structural features of the Ras·Sos complex suggest that Sos might promote the dissociation of guanine nucleotide by perturbing the Mg2+ and phosphate groups. Specifically, Sos inserts Leu938 and Glu942 into the Mg2+- and phosphate-binding sites, respectively. In addition, the position adopted by the methyl side chain of Ala59 of Ras in the Ras·Sos complex occludes Mg2+ binding. Surprisingly, we have found that E942A, L938A, and A59G mutations had no significant effect on the ability of Sos to stimulate GDP dissociation, suggesting that disruption of Mg2+ coordination by these residues is not critical for Sos-mediated exchange reaction. The fact that Glu942 is not highly conserved among different Ras GEFs is consistent with this interpretation. That the mechanism of GEF-mediated nucleotide release from Ras is independent, at least in part, of the removal of Mg2+ is indicated by the finding that CDC25Mm induces a significant increase in the GDP dissociation rate even in the presence of saturating concentrations of EDTA (19Lenzen C. Cool R.H. Prinz H. Kuhlmann J. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7420-7430Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The reason for the selective impairment of Sos-mediated GTP dissociation displayed by the A59G Ras mutant is not known. The observation that this defect was partly corrected by lowering the Mg2+ concentration suggests that Mg2+coordination and/or GTP-binding properties of this mutant might be altered. The interaction of Ras with Sos induces the displacement of switch 1 via injection of the helical hairpin structure, moving it away from the nucleotide-binding site. The observed increase in the intrinsic rate of nucleotide dissociation caused by mutations in switch 1 Tyr residues that form side chain-specific interactions with Sos (Y32S and Y40A) indicates the importance of these interactions in stabilizing the bound nucleotide. Moreover, the reduction in Sos-mediated guanine nucleotide exchange activity displayed by the Y32S Ras and K939A Sos mutants highlights the critical role of switch 1 conformational change in the exchange reaction. It has been noted before that substitution of residue 40 of Ras to Ile or Ser leads to an increase in intrinsic exchange rates (30Leonardsen L. DeClue J.E. Lybaek H. Lowry D.R. Willumsen B.M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2177-2187PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we have found that mutation of residue 40 of Ras to Cys similarly causes an increase in the intrinsic rate of nucleotide dissociation (data not shown). This is of particular interest since the Y40C Ras mutant has been extensively used as a partial loss-of-function mutant in studying the biological roles of Ras effector pathways (37White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. Aelst L.V. Karin M. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). It remains to be established to what extent the signaling activities of this mutant are influenced by its altered properties with respect to guanine nucleotide exchange. The minimal region of Ras GEFs required for catalytic activity consists of ∼250 amino acids containing three regions that are highly conserved among known Ras GEFs (3Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar). However, it has been shown that, in the case of the yeast Ras-specific GEF Cdc25, a larger fragment of ∼450 amino acids is necessary for full exchange activity in vivo (38Lai C.C. Boguski M. Broek D. Powers S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1345-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The N terminus of this fragment (defined previously as the N-terminal domain) (33Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar) contains an additional conserved region of ∼50 amino acids found exclusively in Ras-specific GEFs. In the crystal structure of the Ras·Sos complex, two conserved residues within this region, Leu609 and Phe623, form a hydrophobic groove that accommodates the side chains of two conserved hydrophobic residues from the helical hairpin of Sos, Ile956 and Phe958. The disruption of these hydrophobic interactions was shown to cause a reduction in Sos exchange activity presumably due to the destabilization of the helical hairpin. Because the stability and correct placement of the helical hairpin are principally important for Sos-induced structural changes in switch 1, these results provide additional support for the idea that the movement of switch 1 is a critical aspect of the exchange reaction. Recently, Shimizu et al. (39Shimizu T. Ihara K. Maesaki R. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Hakoshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18311-18317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) described the crystal structure of the Mg2+-free form of GDP-bound RhoA. It is difficult to assess the direct relevance of the information derived from this structure to the Sos-mediated nucleotide exchange mechanism because of the differences that exist between the nucleotide-binding properties of Ras and Rho GTPases. For example, the nucleotide-binding affinities of Ras are in the nanomolar range, and Mg2+ is required for high affinity binding. In contrast, the nucleotide-binding affinities of the Rho GTPases are in the submicromolar range, and Mg2+is not essential for nucleotide binding (40Zhang B. Zhang Y. Wang Z. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25299-25307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In addition, the Mg2+-chelating residues of RhoA·GDP are different from those of Ras·GDP, and the switch 1 region of Rho GTPases is more flexible compared with that of Ras (41Feltham J.L. Dotsch V. Raza S. Manor D. Cerione R.A. Sutcliffe M.J. Wagner G. Oswald R.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8755-8766Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 42Hirshberg M. Stockley R.W. Dodson G. Webb M.R. Nat.

Chem. 1998; 273: 9656-9666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is of interest to note that the conformational changes in switch 1 and switch 2 of RhoA·GDP induced by the absence of Mg2+ bear a striking resemblance to the conformation adopted by switch 1 and switch 2 of nucleotide-free Ras when complexed to Sos (33Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 39Shimizu T. Ihara K. Maesaki R. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Hakoshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18311-18317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This similarity raises the possibility that the major function of Mg2+ displacement from Ras might be the induction of structural changes that result in a conformation that is compatible with Sos binding. Our mutagenesis studies suggest that the disruption of Mg2+ coordination is not dependent on Sos. Since Mg2+ is in fast equilibrium with the solvent, it is possible that the initial step in the exchange reaction involves the binding of Sos to Mg2+-free, but nucleotide-bound Ras molecules. Based on kinetic analysis of CDC25Mm-mediated nucleotide dissociation, it has been proposed that the binding interaction of the GEF with Ras consists of two distinct steps: a fast association reaction involving the formation of a ternary complex of a tightly bound nucleotide, Ras, and CDC25Mm, followed by a conformational transition to a ternary complex in which the nucleotide is loosely bound (19Lenzen C. Cool R.H. Prinz H. Kuhlmann J. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7420-7430Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The formation of a complex between Sos and Mg2+-free Ras, if it occurs, might be equivalent to the first step identified in the kinetic studies. Although the structural features of this complex would not permit Mg2+ binding, they would not be sufficient to induce a decrease in nucleotide affinity, and a second step involving Sos-mediated conformational changes that destabilize the nucleotide would be required to promote nucleotide dissociation. A detailed kinetic analysis of the Sos exchange mechanism would be required to dissect these reaction steps. In addition to Ras·Sos, there are two other structures of a GEF bound to a small GTPase that have been described recently: the Sec7 domain bound to nucleotide-free Arf1 and Tiam1 bound to nucleotide-free Rac1 (35Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Sondek J. Nature. 2000; 408: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 45Goldberg J. Cell. 1998; 95: 237-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The overall structural features of the Ras·Sos, Arf1·Sec7, and Rac1·Tiam1 complexes share similarities in that, in all complexes, the GEF interacts extensively with switch 2 and induces the displacement of switch 1. However, the postulated exchange mechanisms for the Sec7 domain and Tiam1 appear to be different from that observed for Sos. The conformational change in switch 1 of Arf1 allows the insertion of a glutamate residue (Glu97) from the Sec7 domain into the Mg2+-binding site. This glutamate residue plays a critical role in the exchange reaction, as indicated by the finding that mutants of the Sec7 domain containing substitutions at Glu97 display a >1000-fold reduction in exchange factor activity (46Beraud-Dufour S. Robineau S. Chardin P. Paris S. Chabre M. Cherfils J. Antonny B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3651-3659Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 47Mossessova E. Gulbis J.M. Goldberg J. Cell. 1998; 92: 415-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In contrast, mutation of a glutamate residue of Sos (Glu942) that appears to be structurally equivalent to Glu97 of Sec7 had no effect on the ability of Sos to catalyze guanine nucleotide exchange activity. The structural changes in switch 2 of Rac induced by the binding of Tiam1 lead to the repositioning of Ala59 toward the Mg2+-binding site. This rearrangement is supported by Lys1195 of Tiam1, and substitution of this lysine residue with alanine has been shown to impede the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of Tiam1 (35Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Sondek J. Nature. 2000; 408: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In the Ras·Sos complex, Ala59 of Ras undergoes a nearly identical conformational change that is supported by Thr935, but substitution of either Ala59 with Gly or Thr935 with Ala had no effect on nucleotide exchange. Thus, although the structural transitions that accompany the binding of different GEFs to their cognate GTPases might share common features, the molecular details of the reaction mechanisms are likely to be specific for each GEF.

https://openalex.org/W1969095467,"This study was designed to analyze whether ceramide, a bioeffector of growth suppression, plays a role in the regulation of telomerase activity in A549 cells. Telomerase activity was inhibited significantly by exogenous C<sub>6</sub>-ceramide, but not by the biologically inactive analog dihydro-C<sub>6</sub>-ceramide, in a time- and dose-dependent manner, with 85% inhibition produced by 20 μm C<sub>6</sub>-ceramide at 24 h. Moreover, analysis of phosphatidylserine translocation from the inner to the outer plasma membrane by flow cytometry and of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase degradation by Western blotting showed that ceramide treatment (20 μm for 24 h) had no apoptotic effects. Trypan blue exclusion, [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine incorporation, and cell cycle analyses, coupled with clonogenic cell survival assay on soft agar, showed that ceramide treatment with a 20 μmconcentration at 24 h resulted in the cell cycle arrest of the majority of the cell population at G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> with no detectable cell death. These results suggest that the inhibition of telomerase by ceramide is not a consequence of cell death but is correlated with growth arrest. Next, to determine the role of endogenous ceramide in telomerase modulation, A549 cells were transiently transfected with an expression vector containing the full-length bacterial sphingomyelinase cDNA (b-SMase). The overexpression of b-SMase, but not exogenously applied purified b-SMase enzyme, resulted in significantly decreased telomerase activity compared with controls, showing that the increased endogenous ceramide is sufficient for telomerase inhibition. Moreover, treatment of A549 cells with daunorubicin at 1 μm for 6 h resulted in the inhibition of telomerase, which correlated with the elevation of endogenous ceramide levels and growth arrest. Finally, stable overexpression of human glucosylceramide synthase, which attenuates ceramide levels by converting ceramide to glucosylceramide, prevented the inhibitory effects of C<sub>6</sub>-ceramide and daunorubicin on telomerase. Therefore, these results provide novel data showing for the first time that ceramide is a candidate upstream regulator of telomerase."
https://openalex.org/W2168776160,"Localization of Ras and Ras-like proteins to the correct subcellular compartment is essential for these proteins to mediate their biological effects. Many members of the Ras superfamily (Ha-Ras, N-Ras, TC21, and RhoA) are prenylated in the cytoplasm and then transit through the endomembrane system on their way to the plasma membrane. The proteins that aid in the trafficking of the small GTPases have not been well characterized. We report here that prenylated Rab acceptor protein (PRA1), which others previously identified as a prenylation-dependent receptor for Rab proteins, also interacts with Ha-Ras, RhoA, TC21, and Rap1a. The interaction of these small GTPases with PRA1 requires their post-translational modification by prenylation. The prenylation-dependent association of PRA1 with multiple GTPases is conserved in evolution; the yeast PRA1 protein associates with both Ha-Ras and RhoA. Earlier studies reported the presence of PRA1 in the Golgi, and we show here that PRA1 co-localizes with Ha-Ras and RhoA in the Golgi compartment. We suggest that PRA1 acts as an escort protein for small GTPases by binding to the hydrophobic isoprenoid moieties of the small GTPases and facilitates their trafficking through the endomembrane system.

Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19925-19928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). In addition to regulating cell proliferation, Ras proteins also regulate differentiation, cell death, and cell survival (1Vojtek A.B. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19925-19928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The Ras proteins are members of a large superfamily of low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins, which include members that regulate the actin cytoskeleton (Rho and Rac), vesicle trafficking (Rabs), and nuclear transport (Ran). The biological activity of Ras proteins is controlled by a regulated GTP/GDP cycle (2Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar). The GTP-bound, or active, Ras relays signals to downstream effector proteins. In the case of Ha-Ras, numerous effector proteins have been described, including serine/threonine kinases (c-Raf, A-Raf, and B-Raf), lipid kinases (type I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase), and guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulators for Ral (Ral GDS1 and RGL) (1Vojtek A.B. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19925-19928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Activation of Ras effector pathways leads to proliferation, differentiation, cell death, and cell survival. Which biological outcome predominates is somewhat of a mystery but seems to depend on cell type and the coordinate integration of signaling pathways activated and/or inhibited within a cell. Members of the Ras superfamily are subject to post-translational modifications. The spectrum of modifications depends on the composition of the carboxyl terminus. In the case of Ha-Ras, the protein is subject to prenylation, proteolysis, carboxylmethylation, andS-acylation/palmitoylation (3Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar). Prenylation is the covalent attachment of farnesyl or geranylgeranyl isoprenoids at or near the carboxyl terminus of the GTPase. For Ras family members, prenylation occurs at a conserved cysteine in the carboxyl-terminal motif termed the CAAX box, where C represents cysteine, A is an aliphatic amino acid, and X is usually Ser, Met, Gln, or Leu (3Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar, 4Gelb M.H. Science. 1997; 275: 1750-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Whereas Ha-Ras, N-Ras, K-Ras4B, and yeast Ras2 are farnesylated, most other small GTPases are geranylgeranylated (5Gibbs J.B. Oliff A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 143-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). RhoB can be either farnesylated or geranylgeranylated (5Gibbs J.B. Oliff A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 143-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The enzymes that catalyze prenylation, farnesyltransferase and geranylgeranyltransferase-I and II, reside in the cytoplasm. Prenylation is followed by proteolysis of the carboxyl-terminal tripeptide and methylation of the newly generated carboxyl-terminal amino acid in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (3Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar, 4Gelb M.H. Science. 1997; 275: 1750-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Some Ras proteins, including Ha-Ras, N-Ras, yeast Ras2, and Rac1 are further modified byS-acylation (palmitoylation) of cysteine(s) located near the carboxyl terminus of the protein (3Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar, 4Gelb M.H. Science. 1997; 275: 1750-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). S-acylation is likely to occur in the ER, since Erf2, a novel integral membrane protein required for palmitoylation of Ras in yeast, is localized to the ER (6Bartels D.J. Mitchell D.A. Dong X. Deschenes R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6775-6787Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Other proteins, such as K-Ras4B, that are not subject toS-acylation have a polybasic stretch of amino acids, also located near the CAAX box, within the 20-amino acid hypervariable domain of the Ras proteins. The combination of two signals, prenylation and S-acylation or prenylation and a polybasic stretch of amino acids, are required for plasma membrane targeting of Ras proteins. Ras proteins (Ha-Ras, N-Ras) transit through the ER and Golgi and finally reach the plasma membrane via exocytic transport vesicles (7Magee T. Marshall C. Cell. 1999; 98: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 8Choy E. Chiu V.K. Silletti J. Feoktistov M. Morimoto T. Michaelson D. Ivanov I.E. Philips M.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). The trafficking of K-Ras4B, however, is unlikely to involve the Golgi compartment; rather, once prenylated and further modified in the ER, the trafficking of K-Ras4B to the plasma membrane involves a microtubule network (9Thissen J.A. Gross J.M. Subramanian K. Meyer T. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30362-30370Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 10Chen Z. Otto J.C. Bergo M.O. Young S.G. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41251-41257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). As a consequence of the post-translational modifications, Ras is membrane-localized. In mammalian cells, membrane localization of Ras is necessary for transformation and differentiation. Membrane localization of Ras creates a docking site for effectors, including the Raf kinases and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Membrane localization of Raf may also facilitate and/or enable the subsequent events needed for activation of its catalytic activity, including interactions with phospholipids and phosphorylation by serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases. Membrane localization of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase may accelerate its enzymatic activity by localizing the enzyme to a site rich in substrate lipids. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, membrane localization of Ras is required for the transient increase in cAMP in response to glucose addition but is not required for Ras to fulfill its essential function in the cell (11Bhattacharya S. Chen L. Broach J.R. Powers S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2984-2988Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A number of studies have demonstrated that prenylation of Ras is a critical determinant in initiating membrane attachment. Without prenylation, the subsequent processing events do not take place, and the Ras proteins remain soluble (3Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar, 4Gelb M.H. Science. 1997; 275: 1750-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In addition to initiating the process that ultimately leads to membrane attachment of the small GTPases, farnesylation may also contribute to protein-protein interactions. Studies using an activated Ras2 protein mutated at the farnesylation site reported a decreased interaction between the mutant Ras2 and its effector in yeast, adenylyl cyclase, suggesting that the farnesyl moiety itself or the conformation imposed on the protein by modification may play a role in mediating productive Ras-effector interactions (12Kuroda Y. Suzuki N. Kataoka T. Science. 1993; 259: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In addition, in vitro studies have suggested that farnesylation of Ras may be needed for SOS to promote nucleotide exchange (13Porfiri E. Evans T. Chardin P. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22672-22677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, although farnesylation by itself is not sufficient to target proteins to the plasma membrane, this modification may contribute to stable membrane binding (23Booden M.A. Baker T.L. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Punke S.G. Buss J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1423-1431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that prenylation is crucial for Ras function. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified Ha-Ras-interacting proteins (14Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). We demonstrate in this report that one of these proteins, Rip69, interacts with multiple members of the Ras superfamily, including Ha-Ras, RhoA, and TC21, and that the interaction of Rip69 with the small GTPases requires their post-translational modification by prenylation. Rip69 encodes residues 20–186 of PRA1, prenylated Rab acceptor protein. PRA1 was identified as a Rab-interacting protein in yeast two-hybrid screens, and PRA1 was reported to interact with Rab proteins but not other members of the Ras superfamily (15Martincic I. Peralta M.E. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26991-26998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 16Hutt D.M. Da-Silva L.F. Chang L.H. Prosser D.C. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol.

Commun. 1999; 258: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition to binding Rab proteins, PRA1 also associates with GDP dissociation inhibitor 1 (GDI1) and the v-SNARE VAMP2 (15Martincic I. Peralta M.E. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26991-26998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 16Hutt D.M. Da-Silva L.F. Chang L.H. Prosser D.C. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18511-18519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In vitro PRA1 can block the ability of GDI1 to extract Rab3A from membranes, and therefore the opposing actions of GDI1 and PRA1 on Rab proteins may influence the membrane localization of the Rab proteins (16Hutt D.M. Da-Silva L.F. Chang L.H. Prosser D.C. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18511-18519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Further, Rab3A can displace VAMP2 from VAMP2-PRA1 complexes, so displacement of PRA1 from VAMP2 by Rab may also facilitate v-SNARE/t-SNARE interactions and vesicle fusion (15Martincic I. Peralta M.E. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26991-26998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). With this report, we demonstrate that PRA1 is not a specific partner for Rab proteins but also partners with other members of the Ras superfamily. The association of Ras family members with PRA1 requires their post-translational modification by prenylation. Further, our results suggest that an isoprenoid moiety, either farnesyl or geranylgeranyl, is the critical recognition target for PRA1. The interaction between Ha-Ras and PRA1 and between RhoA and PRA1 is observed in vivo by co-precipitation experiments and co-localization in mammalian cells. The co-localization of Ha-Ras and PRA1 and RhoA and PRA1 to the Golgi compartment suggests that PRA1 may play a role in facilitating the trafficking of small GTPases through the endomembrane system. In addition, we have cloned the yeast PRA1 gene and demonstrate that, like its higher eukaryotic counterpart, the yeast PRA1 protein also interacts with multiple small GTPases, and the interaction requires prenylation of the small GTPase. Thus, PRA1 is predicted to play a conserved role in the biology of small GTPases in all eukaryotic cells. Rip69 was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a 9.5- and 10.5-day short insert size, random primed mouse embryo library using LexA-Ha-RasV12 as bait (14Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). Rip69 encodes residues 20–186 of PRA1 fused in frame to a nuclear localized VP16 protein in pVP16. pLexA-Ha-Ras V12, pLexA-RhoAL63, pLexA-TC21, and pLexA-Rap1a have been described (14Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar, 18Graham S.M. Vojtek A.B. Huff S.Y. Cox A.D. Clark G.J. Cooper J.A. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6132-6140Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); these plasmids all express the full-length small GTPase fused in frame to the LexA DNA binding domain in pLexA or pLexA-Ade. pLexA-Ha-RasV12K6 and pLexA-Ha-RasV12 S181 S184 were constructed by inserting aBamHI–EcoRI fragment generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a Ha-RasV12 template, Expand polymerase (BM), and the following forward and two reverse primers, respectively: 5′-CGGAATTCATGACGGAATATAAGCTGG-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCTCACTTCTTCTTCTTCTTCTTGAGCACACACTTGCAGCT-3′ or 5′-CGGGATCCTCAGGAGAGCACACACTTGGAGCTCATGGAGCCGGGGCCAC-3′. pLexA-GFP and pLexA-GFPCAAX were generated by PCR using pCS2 + eGFPBglII as template and the following forward and two reverse oligonucleotide primers: 5′-CGGGATCCGCACCATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAG-3′ and 5′-CGGAATTCTTGCGGCCGCAATTATCCACCGCCCTTGTACAG-3′ or 5′-CGGAATTCTTGCGGCCGCAATTAGGAGAGCACACATCCACCGCCCTTGTACAG-3′. Inserts generated after PCR were sequenced after subcloning. Ha-RasV12 and RhoAL63 were expressed as fusion proteins in HEK293 cells to glutathione S-transferase (GST) in the expression vector pEBG-3X. Full-length yeast PRA1 was isolated from yeast genomic DNA using PCR with gene-specific oligonucleotide primers with appropriate restriction sites for subcloning into pVP16. Full-length mouse PRA1 was isolated by reverse transcription-PCR from mouse brain RNA, as described (19Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 777-785PubMed Google Scholar), using gene-specific oligonucleotide primers. The full-length mouse PRA1 cDNA was subcloned into pCS3 + MT and sequenced. The S. cerevisiae strain L40 was transformed with plasmids expressing fusions to the LexA DNA binding domain in pLexAde or pLexAdeNot and with plasmids expressing fusions to a nuclear localized VP16 acidic activation domain in pVP16 (14Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). Transactivation of the HIS3 reporter was assessed by growing yeast overnight while maintaining selection for the plasmids and then plating 10-fold serial dilutions to YC-WHULK and YC-LW plates. The plates were incubated for 3 days at 30 °C and then photographed. GST-Ha-RasV12, GST-RhoAL63, or GST-Rap1a and MT-PRA1 were co-transfected into HEK293 cells using a calcium phosphate transfection protocol. Approximately 36 h after transfection, cells were lysed in Triton IP buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mmNaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1% aprotinin, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Glutathione-agarose beads were added to the cell lysates to purify GST-Ha-Ras, GST-RhoA, or GST-Rap1a and associated protein(s). The beads were washed three times with Triton IP buffer and suspended in sample buffer. A GST expression vector was included as a negative control. The proteins bound to glutathione Sepharose beads were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-GST and anti-Myc tag epitope antibodies. HEK293 cells were transfected with expression vectors for GST-Ha-RasV12 and GST, pEBG3X-Ha-RasV12, or pEBG, respectively. Processed and unprocessed GST-Ha-Ras proteins were prepared by Triton X-114 partitioning essentially as described (20Hancock J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) followed by purification of the processed and unprocessed GST-Ras proteins on glutathione-Sepharose resin. VP16-Rip69 and VP16 proteins were prepared in the presence of [35S]methionine by coupled in vitrotranscription-translation (TNT, Promega) of the appropriate expression vector, pRip69 or pVP16. The labeled Rip69 and VP16 proteins were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose bound processed GST-Ha-Ras protein, unprocessed GST-Ha-Ras protein, or control GST protein. After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, the resin was washed three times in Triton IP buffer. The GST-fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads and any co-associated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon. [35S]Methionine-labeled Rip69 was detected by autoradiography. The GST fusion proteins were detected by Western blot analysis using an anti-GST antibody. COS cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors for eGFP-PRA1 and either GST-Ha-Ras or GST-RhoA, pCS2 + eGFP-PRA1, pEBG-3X-Ha-RasV12, and pEBG-RhoAL63, respectively. Cells were fixed 36 h post-transfection on polylysine-coated coverslips with 3.7% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized for 15 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, and blocked with 10% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. Fixed and permeabilized cells were incubated with monoclonal hybridoma supernatant harvested from 9E10 cells (Myc epitope tag antibody) or with anti-GST antisera, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated with Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). After washing, the coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Prolong (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). The cells were viewed on a Noran OZ laser-scanning confocal microscope, and the data were collected in a UNIX-based Silicon Graphics INDY R5000 work station or viewed on a Nikon deconvolution microscope. The figures were prepared using Photoshop 5.5 (Adobe), and the relative intensities have been adjusted to visualize spatial overlap. Rip69 was identified as a Ha-Ras-interacting protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a mouse embryo cDNA library (14Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). Among the clones recovered in this screen were those that required an intact Ras effector domain for the Ras-Rip interaction. The proteins encoded by these isolates, which include Raf family members (14Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar), the catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (21Chantry D. Vojtek A. Kashishian A. Holtzman D.A. Wood C. Gray P.W. Cooper J.A. Hoekstra M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19236-19241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), and guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Ral, were subsequently shown to be direct downstream targets of Ras. In addition, isolates were recovered that associated with Ras proteins mutated in the effector domain; among these was Rip69. The lack of a requirement for an intact Ras effector domain for the Ras-Rip69 protein-protein interaction suggests that the Rip69 isolate does not encode an effector of Ras function but is more likely to be either a regulator of Ras or a protein involved in the trafficking of Ras to the plasma membrane. Rip69 encodes residues 20–186 of prenylated Rab acceptor protein PRA1. Three published reports demonstrate that PRA1 interacts with members of the Rab family of GTPases, including Rab1, Rab3A, Rab5, and Rab6 (15Martincic I. Peralta M.E. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26991-26998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 17Bucci C. Chiariello M. Lattero D. Maiorano M. Bruni C.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14801-14808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Among small GTPases, PRA1 is thought to be a relatively specific partner for Rab proteins because, in two reports, PRA1 failed to interact with other members of the Ras superfamily, Ras, Rho, and Rac (15Martincic I. Peralta M.E. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26991-26998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 17Bucci C. Chiariello M. Lattero D. Maiorano M. Bruni C.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because we had identified PRA1 in a two-hybrid screen with Ha-Ras, we investigated the ability of the full-length mouse PRA protein, PRA1, to interact with RhoA and TC21. In addition to interacting with Ha-Ras, PRA1 interacts with TC21 and RhoA, Fig.1. These results indicate that the interaction of PRA1 with small GTPases is not specific to Rab proteins; instead, PRA1 interacts with multiple members of the Ras superfamily, including Ha-Ras, RhoA, and TC21. Although Rap1a does not interact with PRA1 in a yeast two-hybrid experiment, Rap1a does interact with PRA1in vivo in mammalian cells (as described below and in Fig.2). Perhaps the LexA-Rap1a fusion protein is not prenylated efficiently in yeast, or it may not localize to the nucleus as efficiently as the unprenylated form.Figure 2Ha-Ras, RhoA, and Rap1a interact with PRA1 in vivo. GST or GST fusion proteins were purified from lysates prepared from HEK293 cells transfected with the indicated constructs using glutathione-Sepharose. The pull-downs were subject to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with antibodies directed against the epitope tags on Ha-Ras, RhoA, or Rap1a (GST) or PRA1 (Myc).A, GST-Ha-RasV12, but not GST or GST-Ha-RasV12ΔCAAX, associates with PRA1. B, GST-RhoAL63 but not GST associates with PRA1. C, GST-Rap1a but not GST associates with PRA1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To confirm our yeast two-hybrid experiments, we examined the association of Ha-Ras and RhoA with PRA1 in vivo. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, Ha-Ras and PRA1 and RhoA and PRA1 associate in HEK293 cells overexpressing these proteins. In addition, because we did not observe an association of PRA1 with Rap1a in yeast, we examined the interaction in mammalian cells. As shown in Fig. 2 C, Rap1a and PRA1 co-associate in vivo in HEK293 cells. Thus, PRA1 associates with multiple members of the Ras superfamily in vivo. Ha-Ras proteins undergo a series of post-translational modifications: 1) attachment of an isoprenoid farnesyl moiety to a cysteine located 4 residues from the carboxyl terminus of the protein; 2) removal of the carboxyl-terminal tripeptide; 3) methylation of the carboxyl group of the farnesylated cysteine; and, 4) palmitoylation of two cysteines near the carboxyl terminus of the protein, Cys181 and Cys184 (3Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar, 4Gelb M.H. Science. 1997; 275: 1750-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To investigate the requirement for post-translational modification of Ha-Ras on the association of PRA1 with Ha-Ras, we examined the association of PRA1 with mutant Ras proteins missing key post-translational modifications (Fig.3). Ha-RasV12ΔCAAX is an activated Ras that lacks all post-translational modifications. Ha-RasV12K6 is an activated Ras with polylysine substituted for Ser189, the last residue of the CAAX box; this mutant Ras is palmitoylated but not farnesylated (23Booden M.A. Baker T.L. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Punke S.G. Buss J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1423-1431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Ha-RasV12 S181 S184 is an activated Ras that is farnesylated, proteolyzed, and methylated but not palmitoylated (23Booden M.A. Baker T.L. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Punke S.G. Buss J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1423-1431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). PRA1 interacts with Ha-RasV12 S181 S184 but not Ha-RasV12ΔCAAX or Ha-RasV12K6 (Fig. 3). Thus, Ras proteins that are not palmitoylated are still capable of associating with PRA1, indicating that palmitoylation of Ras is not required for the association of the proteins. Ras proteins that are not farnesylated or are not modified in any way do not interact with PRA1, suggesting that farnesylated Ras is the binding partner for PRA1. In order to determine whether the modified carboxyl-terminal tetrapeptide of Ha-Ras is both necessary and sufficient for recognition by PRA1, we assessed the association of PRA1 with GFP-CAAX, a GFP protein to which only the last 4 amino acids of Ha-Ras, CVLS, were added. This tetrapeptide is both necessary and sufficient for farnesyltransferase and geranylgeranyl transferase I to recognize and prenylate Protein A and Giα, which have been mutated to end in a CAAX sequence (24Goldstein J.L.

Cell. 1989; 57: 1167-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar). Likewise, we expect that in yeast this tetrapeptide will be recognized and prenylated by yeast farnesyltransferase and probably proteolyzed and methylated because mammalian Ha-Ras when expressed in yeast is appropriately modified. As shown in Fig. 4, PRA1 interacts with GFP-CAAX but not GFP. This result suggests that the molecular determinants for the binding of PRA1 reside within the CAAX box of Ha-Ras and that a modified tetrapeptide (farnesylated, proteolyzed, and/or methylated) is both necessary and sufficient to mediate the protein-protein interaction. The sole post-translational modification in common among the PRA1 interacting proteins, Rabs, Ras, Rho, and TC21, is isoprenylation, the attachment of farnesyl or geranylgeranyl moieties to the proteins (Table I). To demonstrate that post-translational processing events subsequent to prenylation (proteolysis and/or methylation) are not essential for PRA1 binding, we examined the association of PRA1 with GFP-CVYS. GFP-CVYS contains a substitution of Tyr for Leu at the A2 position of the CA1A2X box. A K-Ras Tyr187 CAAX box mutant protein is prenylated but not further processed (33Kato K. Cox A.D. Hisaka M.M. Graham S.M. Buss J.E. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6403-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 B, PRA1 interacts with GFP-CVYS. Taken together, our observations suggest that an isoprenoid moiety, either farnesyl or geranylgeranyl, is the critical recognition target for PRA1.Table IPRA1 associates with multiple GTPases: The sole feature in common is prenylationGTPaseC-terminal sequencePrenylationAAXMethylationPalmitoylationTwo-hybrid interactionHa-RasDESGPGCMSCKCVLSFYYY++TC21TRKEKDKKGCHCVIFFYYY++RhoALQARRGKKKSGCLVLGYYN++Rap1APVEKKKPKKKSCLLLGYYN−1-aAlthough Rap1a fails to interact with PRA1 in a yeast two-hybrid test, Rap1a interacts with PRA1 in vivo in mammalian cells (see Fig. 2 and “Results”).Rab3aQLSDQQVPPHQDCACGNYN+*Rab1KIDSTPVKSASGGCCGNNN+*The carboxyl-terminal sequence of each GTPase is shown, and the post-translational modifications each GTPase undergoes are indicated.

To confirm the prenylation dependence observed in yeast two-hybrid experiments, modified and unmodified GST-Ha-Ras was purified from mammalian cells after Triton X-114 partitioning. GST-Ha-Ras from the detergent phase (modified Ras) interacted with PRA1 in vitro, whereas GST-Ha-Ras from the aqueous phase (unmodified Ras) did not interact with PRA1 in vitro (Fig.5). Taken together, our observations in yeast and in vitro indicate that PRA1 preferentially associates with post-translationally modified (prenylated) Ras. Sequences homologous to PRA1 are present in S. cerevisiae,Schizosaccaromyces pombe, Arabidopsis thaliana,Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans. To determine if the association of PRA1 with small GTPases was conserved, we cloned the yeast homolog and assessed its ability to interact with Ha-Ras and RhoA. The yeast PRA1 protein, yPRA1, interacts with both Ha-Ras and RhoA (Fig.6). The association of Ha-Ras and yPRA1 is dependent on the post-translational modification of Ras because Ha-RasΔCAAX is unable to bind to yPRA1 (Fig. 6). Thus, the interaction of PRA1 with Ras family members is conserved in evolution. Recent studies have demonstrated an association of Ha- and N-Ras with endomembranes (8Choy E. Chiu V.K. Silletti J. Feoktistov M. Morimoto T. Michaelson D. Ivanov I.E. Philips M.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 26Apolloni A. Prior I.A. Lindsay M. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2475-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Ha- and N-Ras are prenylated in the cytoplasm and then undergo additional modifications as they transit through the ER and then Golgi. RhoA also is present in the ER and/or endosomal vesicles (27Adamson P. Paterson H.F. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 28Allal C. Favre G. Couderc B. Salicio S. Sixou S. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Lajoie-Mazenc I. Pradines A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31001-31008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The prenylation-dependent association of small GTPases with PRA1, together with the ability of PRA1 to interact with small GTPases with effector domain mutations (a result that strongly suggests that PRA1 is not an effector of the small GTPases with which it interacts) suggested to us that PRA1 may function in an endomembrane compartment. Therefore, we compared the spatial distribution of PRA1 and Ha-Ras and RhoA in COS1 cells. Both Ha-Ras and PRA1 exhibit perinuclear staining, indicative of Golgi localization, and Ha-Ras and PRA1 co-localize in this perinuclear region, Fig.7A. In addition, RhoA and PRA1 also co-localize in the Golgi compartment (Fig. 7 B). Recent studies have shown that PRA1 is present in the Golgi compartment (16Hutt D.M. Da-Silva L.F. Chang L.H. Prosser D.C. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18511-18519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and our studies using Golgi markers confirm this (data not shown). The 15 carbon farnesyl and 20 carbon geranylgeranyl isoprenoid groups are hydrophobic, although the hydrophobicity of these groups do not support stable membrane localization. Since PRA1 specifically recognizes the isoprenoid moieties of small GTPases, the binding of PRA1 to prenylated small GTPases may facilitate their trafficking through the endomembrane system by masking the hydrophobicity of the isoprenoid groups. With this report, we demonstrate that PRA1 associates with multiple members of the Ras superfamily. We show that PRA1 associates with Ha-Ras, RhoA, TC21, and Rap1a. Others have shown that PRA1 associates with Rab family members (15Martincic I. Peralta M.E. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26991-26998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 16Hutt D.M. Da-Silva L.F. Chang L.H. Prosser D.C. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol.

Commun. 1999; 258: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The sole feature in common among these small GTPases is the presence of farnesyl or geranylgeranyl isoprenoid moieties covalently linked to cysteines located at or near the carboxyl terminus of the small GTPases (Table I). Our Ras CAAX box mutant studies (Fig. 3), Triton-X114 partitioning studies (Fig. 5), and GFP-CAAX/PRA1 protein-protein interaction studies (Fig. 4) are consistent with the farnesyl or geranylgeranyl moiety of the small GTPase as being the key recognition target for PRA1. Small GTPases are not the only proteins subject to modification by prenylation. Prelamin A, lamin B, γ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins, and serine/threonine kinases such as LKB1 are prenylated (3Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar,29Collins S.P. Reoma J.L. Gamm D.M. Uhler M.D. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine whether PRA1 associates with proteins outside the Ras superfamily. A search of the data bases reveals the presence of PRA1 homologs in many organisms. PRA1 homologs are present in both budding and fission yeast, in A. thaliana, C. elegans, D. melanogaster, and Mus musculus. yPRA1, the PRA1 homolog from budding yeast, interacts with multiple prenylated small GTPases (Fig. 6). Thus, the interaction of PRA1 with multiple small GTPases is conserved in evolution, and this conservation of the association suggests that the function of the PRA1-small GTPase interaction may also be conserved in evolution. Experiments are in progress to genetically decipher the physiological role of PRA1 in yeast. The association of PRA1 with multiple small GTPases in vitroand in vivo suggests that PRA1 has a role that is held in common with all small GTPases that it interacts with. The feature in common among the small GTPases that PRA1 interacts with is their post-translational modification by farnesyl or geranylgeranyl isoprenoid moieties. We suggest that PRA1 binds prenylated GTPases to act as an escort protein for the GTPases. Biochemical fractionation and localization experiments show that PRA1 is found both in the cytoplasm and in the Golgi (16Hutt D.M. Da-Silva L.F. Chang L.H. Prosser D.C. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18511-18519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). PRA1 may associate with small GTPases after prenylation occurs in the cytoplasm to “solubilize” the hydrophobic prenyl motifs and thus facilitate trafficking through the endomembrane system. Alternatively, PRA1 may function in the Golgi to facilitate the entry of small GTPases into vesicles for transport to cellular compartments. PRA1 is found in synaptic vesicle membranes, so PRA1 may cycle with the Ras proteins in the exocytic vesicles out to the plasma membrane (30Fenster S.D. Chung W.J. Zhai R. Cases-Langhoff C. Voss B. Garner A.M. Kaempf U. Kindler S. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. Neuron. 2000; 25: 203-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). PRA1 also associates with GDI1 (16Hutt D.M. Da-Silva L.F. Chang L.H. Prosser D.C. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18511-18519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The addition of recombinant GDI1 to membranes prepared from PC12 cells was effective at removing Rab3A from the membrane; the addition of PRA1 blocked the ability of GDI to extract Rab3A (16Hutt D.M. Da-Silva L.F. Chang L.H. Prosser D.C. Ngsee J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18511-18519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the opposing actions of GDI1 and PRA1 may influence the membrane localization of the Rab proteins. GDIs have been described that solubilize membrane-associated Rho proteins (31Fukumoto Y. Kaibuchi K. Hori Y. Fujioka H. Araki S. Ueda T. Kikuchi A. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1321-1328PubMed Google Scholar). Possibly, the opposing action of GDI and PRA1 is a general mechanism for regulating the membrane status of small GTPases that are acted upon by GDIs. The prevalence of Ras mutations in human tumors and the requirement of plasma membrane localization of Ras for cellular function suggested early on that inhibitors of farnesyltransferase might be a promising class of cancer therapeutics (5Gibbs J.B. Oliff A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 143-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Some of these inhibitors of farnesyltransferase are presently being evaluated in phase II clinical trials. However, small GTPases, such as RhoC, which has been recently associated with promotion of metastasis (32Clark E.A. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Hynes R.O. Nature. 2000; 406: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar), are geranylgeranylated, so inhibitors of geranylgeranyl transferase may also prove to be a promising class of cancer therapeutics. In addition, some GTPases are “switch-hitters,” subject to either farnesylation or geranylgeranylation. Therefore, inhibiting one pathway may not necessarily prove efficacious in cancer treatment. PRA1 binds both farnesylated and geranylgeranylated small GTPases and may act as a receptor or escort protein for Ras superfamily members. Thus, inhibitors directed against PRA1 may provide a means to pharmacologically intervene to inhibit the signaling pathways activated aberrantly by both farnesylated and geranylgeranylated small GTPases, which can result in sustained cell growth (tumorigenesis) and metastasis.

Here, we demonstrate that IL-6 activates Rac-1 and SEK-1/MKK-4 of the stress-activated protein kinase pathway, as well as protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ), as indicated by PKCδ Thr-505 phosphorylation. However, JNK-1, the end point kinase of the stress-activated protein kinase pathway signal transduction cascade, is not activated by IL-6. PKCδ was found to be associated with SEK-1/MKK-4 in unstimulated HepG2 cells but rapidly dissociates from SEK-1/MKK-4 upon IL-6 stimulation to become associated with STAT3. Inhibition of PKCδ using rottlerin (6 µm) or by overexpression of dominant negative PKCδ demonstrates that PKCδ kinase activity is required for STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation and transactivation but not for STAT3 Tyr-705 phosphorylation or nuclear import. PKCδ signals downstream of Rac-1 and SEK-1/MKK-4, because enhanced STAT3 transactivation induced by overexpression of constitutive active RacV12 was strongly abrogated by rottlerin, whereas IL-6-induced SEK-1/MKK-4 Thr-223 phosphorylation was not affected under these conditions. Studying the kinetics of STAT3 and PKCδ phosphorylation in cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions revealed that STAT3 Tyr-705 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation precedes PKCδ Thr-505 and STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation. Furthermore, the IL-6-induced PKCδ Thr-505 and STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation were only observed in nuclear fractions of HepG2 cells. These results demonstrate that IL-6-induced STAT3 transactivation involves the sequential activation of Rac-1 and SEK-1/MKK-4, which leads to nuclear translocation of PKCδ by release from a SEK-1/MKK-4-containing complex.

In addition to tyrosine phosphorylation, STAT3 is serine-phosphorylated at a single residue (Ser-727) in response to IL-6 as well as other extracellular factors, including interferon γ and epidermal growth factor (13Wen Z.

Chem. 1999; 274: 31055-31061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that stress treatment could induce STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation via JNK-1, whereas we demonstrated that IL-6-induced STAT3 transactivation and Ser-727 phosphorylation involves the activation of the GDP-GTP exchange factor Vav, the GTPase Rac-1, and the kinases mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase kinase 1 and SEK-1/MKK-4 in human hepatoma cells (18Schuringa J.J. Jonk L.J. Dokter W.H. Vellenga E. Kruijer W. Biochem. J. 2000; 347 Pt 1: 89-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been described that PKCδ associates with and phosphorylates STAT3 on Ser-727 in an IL-6-dependent manner (24Jain N. Zhang T. Kee W.H. Li W. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24392-24400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Activation of G protein-coupled receptors, tyrosine kinase receptors, and non-tyrosine kinase receptors can activate PKCs, and it has been demonstrated that PKCδ undergoes both tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation upon activation (25Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 26Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar). So far, the signal transduction cascade(s) involved in IL-6-induced activation of PKCδ is not well defined. Here, we further explored the role of Rac-1, SEK-1/MKK-4, and PKCδ in IL-6-induced STAT3 transactivation and Ser-727 phosphorylation. We provide evidence that PKCδ is activated by IL-6 and signals downstream of Rac-1 and SEK-1/MKK-4 in IL-6-induced STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation. The human hepatoma cell line HepG2 was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Integro B.V., Zaandam, The Netherlands). Cells were stimulated with 25 ng/ml human recombinant IL-6 (a generous gift from Dr. S. C. Clark, Genetics Institute, Cambridge, MA) or 100 ng/ml TPA (Sigma). The PKCδ inhibitor rottlerin (Calbiochem) was used at a final concentration of 6 µm unless stated otherwise. Antibodies against STAT3, SEK-1/MKK-4 and PKCδ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used in dilutions of 1:4000, unless stated otherwise. Antibodies against phosphorylated SEK-1/MKK-4 Thr-223, PKCδ Thr-505, STAT3 Tyr-705, and STAT3 Ser-727 were obtained from New England Biolabs and used at a 1:1000 dilution. The pIRE-ti-LUC reporter was made by inserting a synthetic oligonucleotide (5′-ctagcaggTTTCCGGGAAAgcacagcttaggTTTCCGGGAAAgcac-3′) containing two copies of the IL-6 response element (IRE) of the ICAM-1 promoter in theNheI site of the pGL3ti minimal promoter luciferase construct (27Jonk L.J. Itoh S. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Kruijer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21145-21152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). pTRE-ti-LUC was constructed by inserting a synthetic oligonucleotide (5′-gatctcgcttgatgAGTCAGccggaag-3′) with a TRE site in the BglII–BamHI sites of the pGL3ti reporter. Constructs were verified by sequencing. pUAS-LUC contains five copies of the GAL4 binding site in front of the luciferase gene. Furthermore, the following plasmids were used (18Schuringa J.J. Jonk L.J. Dokter W.H. Vellenga E. Kruijer W. Biochem. J. 2000; 347 Pt 1: 89-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar): pSG5-STAT3, which expresses STAT3 from the SV40 promoter; pEFlink-dominant-negative PKCδ, which expresses the regulator domain of PKCδ (amino acids 1–298) that functions as a dominant negative from the EF1a promoter; pCS2+-RacN17 and pCS2+-RacV12, expressing the dominant negative and constitutive active mutant variants of Rac; pSEK-1/MKK-4(A-L), which expresses dominant negative SEK-1/MKK-4; pGAL-4-JNK-1, which expresses the GAL4 DNA binding domain fused to JNK-1; pSEK-VP16, which expresses the VP16 transactivation domain fused to SEK-1/MKK-4; and pDM2-LacZ, which was used as an internal control for transfection efficiencies. HepG2 cells were seeded at 3 × 105 cells/well in six-well plates (Costar), and 24 h later, cells were transfected with 10 µg of plasmid DNA using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (28Graham F.L. Van der Eb A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1973; 2: 607-616Google Scholar). Transfection mixtures consisted of a mixture of 3 µg of pIRE LUC reporter, 3 µg of pDM2-LacZ as a control to determine transfection efficiency, and 1–4 µg of expression plasmids for dominant negative or constitutive active signal transduction components, as mentioned under “Results.” When necessary, pUC18 was added to the transfection mixture to obtain a total of 10 µg of DNA. Cells were incubated with precipitate for 24 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and stimulated for an additional 24 h. Cells were collected in 200 µl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega) and subjected to the assays for luciferase and β-galactosidase as previously described. The data represent two independent experiments using different batches of DNA, and in each experiment, transient transfections were performed in triplicate. Standard deviations were calculated using Sigmaplot (Jandel Corp.). A total of 1 × 107 cells were lysed on ice in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm Na2VO3(ortho), 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, and 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Prior to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoprecipitations, protein concentrations were determined (Bio-Rad), and equal amounts were used in the experiments. Whole-cell extracts were boiled for 5 min in the presence of Laemmli sample buffer prior to separation on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose filter (Millipore) in Tris-glycine buffer at 100 Volts for 1.5 h using an electroblotter (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were blocked with PBS buffer containing 5% nonfat milk prior to incubation with antibodies. Binding of each antibody was detected by chemiluminescence using ECL according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For immunoprecipitations, whole cell lysates were incubated with anti-SEK-1/MKK-4 or anti-PKCδ antibodies, precipitated with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and washed two times with lysis buffer. The precipitates were boiled for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Blots were scanned and quantified using Image-Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). HepG2 cells were grown overnight on glass coverslips and pretreated with 6 mm rottlerin where indicated, followed by stimulation with IL-6 for 15 min. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min and permeabilized in 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS for 5 min. Cells were stained by incubation with antibodies against STAT3 (1:100 for 60 min) and washed with PBS followed by incubation with Oregon Green 488 goat-anti rabbit IgG conjugate (Molecular Probes) (1:400 for 60 min). Coverslips were washed with PBS for 15 min, nuclei were stained using 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and fluorescence was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss). To study the interaction and co-activation of PKCδ and SEK-1/MKK-4 upon IL-6 initiated signal transduction, we first set out to investigate whether PKCδ can associate with both STAT3 and SEK-1/MKK-4. SEK-1/MKK-4 was immunoprecipitated from total extracts of HepG2 cells either left unstimulated or stimulated with IL-6 for 15 min and analyzed for co-immunoprecipitated PKCδ. As depicted in Fig.1, PKCδ strongly co-immunoprecipitated with SEK-1/MKK-4 in unstimulated cells; this effect was diminished after 15 min of IL-6 stimulation. In addition, it was shown that PKCδ interacted with STAT3, which was significantly increased following IL-6 stimulation, as was determined by quantification of the blots (Fig. 1). Taken together, these results indicate that PKCδ is dynamically associated with both SEK/MKK4 and STAT3 in an IL-6-dependent manner. Previously, it was demonstrated that JNK-1 activated by stress stimuli, including UV and Anisomycin, is capable of phosphorylating STAT3 on Ser-727 (23Lim C.P. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31055-31061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether JNK-1 can phosphorylate STAT3 in response to IL-6. Because activated JNK-1 strongly enhances c-Jun mediated transactivation of a TPA response element (TRE) (29Smeal T. Binetruy B. Mercola D.A. Birrer M. Karin M. Nature. 1991; 354: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 30Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar), we tested whether a TRE-luciferase reporter was activated by IL-6. As depicted in Fig.2 A, no TRE transactivation was observed in response to IL-6, whereas TPA enhanced the transactivation ∼15-fold. In view of the observed absence of JNK-1 activation in response to IL-6, the SEK-1/MKK-4-JNK-1 association was studied using a mammalian two hybrid approach. JNK-1 and SEK-1/MKK-4 were fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 and the VP16 transactivation domain, respectively, and the SEK-1/MKK-4-JNK-1 interaction was studied in response to IL-6 and TPA on an UAS-luciferase reporter containing five GAL4 binding sites cloned upstream of a minimal promoter. As depicted in Fig. 2 B, TPA induced a strong interaction between SEK/MKK-4 and JNK-1, whereas IL-6 did not. Analysis of JNK-1 localization using fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that IL-6, unlike the stress inducers UV, Anisomycin, and TPA, did not induce JNK-1 nuclear translocation (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that the end point kinase JNK-1 of the stress-activated protein kinase pathway signal transduction cascade is not involved in IL-6-induced STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation and transactivation. Because JNK-1 is not involved in IL-6-induced STAT3 transactivation and PKCδ physically interacts with STAT3 in an IL-6-dependent manner, the role of PKCδ on STAT3 Tyr-705 and Ser-727 phosphorylation, nuclear import, and STAT3 transactivation was studied. Pretreatment of HepG2 cells with the PKCδ inhibitor rottlerin, which effectively inhibits PKCδ activity but does not affect the activity of other PKC isoforms at concentrations ranging from 0 to 6 µm (31Gschwendt M. Muller H.J. Kielbassa K. Zang R. Kittstein W. Rincke G. Marks F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 32Frasch S.C. Henson P.M. Kailey J.M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 23065-23073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), strongly reduced STAT3 transactivation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3 A). Rottlerin did not inhibit luciferase activity because the dose-dependent inhibition of rottlerin on IL-6-induced STAT3 transactivation was still observed in experiments on a shorter time-scale in which cells were stimulated with IL-6 for 6 h instead of 24 h (data not shown). The reduced STAT3 transactivation in the presence of rottlerin was coupled to a reduced IL-6-induced STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation, whereas the IL-6-induced STAT3 Tyr-705 phosphorylation was unaffected (Fig.3 B). Inhibition of PKCδ activity only affects IL-6-induced STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation and not STAT3 nuclear import, as determined by Western blotting of nuclear fractions (Fig.3 C) and intracellular localization studies using fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3 D). To specifically determine the role of PKCδ in IL-6-induced STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation and transactivation, the regulatory domain of PKCδ (amino acids 1–298) was overexpressed; this domain functions as a dominant-negative as determined by in vitro kinase assays using purified PKCδ and GAP-43 as a substrate. In in vitro kinase assays, PKCδ-induced phosphorylation of GAP-43 was strongly reduced by the addition of the purified regulatory domain of PKCδ, indicating that this dominant-negative PKCδ inhibits the phosphorylation potential of wild-type PKCδ (data not shown). Accordingly, overexpression of dominant-negative PKCδ reduced IL-6-induced STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation, whereas the IL-6-induced STAT3 Tyr-705 phosphorylation remained unaffected (Fig. 3 E). In addition, overexpression of dominant-negative PKCδ reduced STAT3 transactivation, although at high concentrations of dominant-negative PKCδ, inhibition of STAT3 transactivation was less effective (Fig. 3 F). Furthermore, the kinetics of nuclear translocation and activation of PKCδ and STAT3 were studied. IL-6-induced PKCδ Thr-505 phosphorylation was transient, reaching maximal levels between 5 and 30 min, and was only detected in nuclear and not cytoplasmic fractions of HepG2 cells. IL-6-induced STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation was also only observed in the nuclear fractions, reaching maximal levels between 10 and 30 min. In contrast, STAT3 Tyr-705 phosphorylation and STAT3 nuclear import occurred with faster kinetics, which were first detected at 2 min after IL-6 stimulation (Fig.4). Because PKCδ is activated by IL-6 and dynamically associated with both SEK-1/MKK-4 and STAT3 in an IL-6-dependent manner, we questioned whether PKCδ signals downstream of the signal transduction cascade that includes Rac-1 and SEK-1/MKK-4 in IL-6-induced STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation and transactivation. First, constitutive active RacV12 was overexpressed in HepG2 cells and STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation was studied. In control pUC transfected cells, IL-6 induced Ser-727 phosphorylation within 15 min, whereas no basal STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation was observed (Fig.5 A). Overexpression of RacV12 strongly enhanced both basal and IL-6-induced STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation, whereas dominant negative RacN17 had the opposite effect (Fig. 5 A). STAT3 Tyr-705 phosphorylation (Fig.5 A) and STAT3 nuclear import (data not shown) were not affected by RacV12 overexpression. Overexpression of constitutive active RacV12 also enhanced both basal and IL-6-induced SEK/MKK-4 Thr-223 phosphorylation, whereas overexpression of dominant negative RacN17 abrogated the IL-6-induced activation of SEK-1/MKK-4 (Fig.5 A), indicating that Rac-1 signals upstream from SEK/MKK-4. Furthermore, the IRE-LUC reporter was transiently transfected together with expression vectors encoding dominant negative RacN17 or constitutive active RacV12 mutants, and PKCδ activity was blocked with rottlerin. As depicted in Fig. 5 B, rottlerin augmented the inhibitory effects of RacN17, whereas the enhancing effects of RacV12 were completely inhibited. Similarly, rottlerin augmented the inhibitory effects of overexpressed dominant negative SEK(A-L) on IL-6-induced STAT3 transactivation (Fig. 5 C). Because rottlerin did not inhibit IL-6-induced SEK-1 Thr-223 phosphorylation (Fig. 5 D), these results strongly suggest that PKCδ signals downstream of Rac-1 and SEK-1/MKK-4 in the IL-6-induced STAT3 transactivation. In addition to STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation, STAT3 is phosphorylated on a specific Ser-727 residue in response to growth factors and cytokines (13Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E.

In this study, we have investigated the involvement of PKCδ and members of the stress-activated protein kinase cascade in IL-6-induced STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation and transactivation. Our results demonstrate that in unstimulated HepG2 cells, PKCδ strongly associates with SEK-1/MKK-4 and is released from this complex in an IL-6-dependent manner, which subsequently leads to STAT3 association and Ser-727 phosphorylation independent of JNK-1. Based on these findings, we conclude that PKCδ might be considered as the end point kinase of the IL-6-activated Rac-1, SEK-1/MKK-4 signal transduction cascade and that activated PKCδ is responsible for STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation and transactivation through an increased interaction with STAT3. In HepG2 cells, IL-6 induces both SEK-1/MKK-4 Thr-223 and PKCδ 84 h-505 phosphorylation. PKCδ threonine 505 is located in the activation loop, and it has been demonstrated that phosphorylation at this site is required for its maximal catalytic activity in eukaryotic cells (34Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Previously, it has been demonstrated that IL-6 induces PKCδ kinase activity in HepG2 cells (24Jain N. Zhang T. Kee W.H. Li W. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24392-24400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and here we identify the residue threonine 505 as a regulatory PKCδ phosphorylation site in response to IL-6 stimulation. Blocking PKCδ kinase activity with rottlerin does not affect the activity of SEK-1/MKK-4, suggesting that IL-6 first activates and phosphorylates SEK-1/MKK-4, followed by the phosphorylation and release of PKCδ. Because IL-6 induces Thr-505 phosphorylation of PKCδ, it is plausible that SEK-1/MKK-4 kinase activity is required for this phosphorylation event, and experiments are currently under way to support this hypothesis. Further support of the idea that PKCδ signals downstream of SEK-1/MKK-4 in IL-6-induced STAT3 transactivation is derived from overexpression of constitutive active and dominant negative variants of SEK-1/MKK-4 and its upstream regulator Rac-1. Overexpression of constitutive active RacV12 strongly enhanced both SEK-1/MKK-4 Thr-223 and STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation, as well as STAT3 transactivation. Inhibition of PKCδ activity with rottlerin completely abolished the RacV12 enhanced STAT3 transactivation, but did not affect the IL-6-induced SEK-1/MKK-4 Thr-223 phosphorylation. These data imply that IL-6-induced SEK-1/MKK-4 activation via Rac-1 leads to phosphorylation and activation of PKCδ and the concomitant dissociation of the PKCδ-SEK-1/MKK-4 complex. Activated PKCδ is now available for its association with STAT3. These data are in agreement with a recent report demonstrating that PKCδ associates with and phosphorylates STAT3 on Ser-727 in response to IL-6 (24Jain N. Zhang T. Kee W.H. Li W. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24392-24400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The association of PKCδ and SEK-1/MKK-4 in IL-6 signal transduction is somewhat remarkable, as JNK-1 is generally regarded as the end point kinase of the stress-activated signal transduction cascade. However, in HepG2 cells, neither JNK-1 activation nor JNK-1 association with SEK-1/MKK-4 could be demonstrated in response to IL-6. These results strengthen the view that in unstimulated HepG2 cells, JNK-1 and PKCδ are anchored in different signal transduction protein complexes through physical association with SEK-1/MKK-4. These complexes are activated in a strictly ligand-dependent manner, which may further involve segregation of the activated components into different cellular compartments. Further studies are required to clarify these issues. PKCδ activity is essential for IL-6-induced STAT3 signaling based on the following observations: (i) the PKCδ specific inhibitor rottlerin inhibits IL-6-induced STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation, and (ii) rottlerin strongly reduces IL-6-induced STAT3 transactivation. Although rottlerin also inhibits calmodulin-kinase III activity, we confirmed the role of PKCδ in IL-6-induced STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation by overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of PKCδ, which reduced STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation as well as STAT3 transactivation, whereas IL-6-induced STAT3 Tyr-705 phosphorylation remained unaffected. The role of serine 727 phosphorylation in STAT3 transactivation has not yet been unambiguously determined, but the present study demonstrates a direct correlation between STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation and transactivation. Treatment with rottlerin severely reduced the IL-6-induced STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation, as well as STAT3 transactivation, whereas STAT3 Tyr-705 phosphorylation or nuclear import was not affected. In addition, we and others demonstrated that overexpression of either STAT3β, which lacks the C-terminal transactivation domain that includes residue Ser-727, or a STAT3 S727A mutant severely impairs the IL-6-induced STAT3 transactivation, confirming the role of Ser-727 phosphorylation on STAT3 transactivation (13Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar, 18Schuringa J.J. Jonk L.J. Dokter W.H. Vellenga E. Kruijer W. Biochem. J. 2000; 347 Pt 1: 89-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to these findings, it has also been reported that overexpression of constitutive active mutants of PKCδ strongly enhanced STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation but severely impair IL-6-induced STAT3 DNA binding and its transcriptional activities (24Jain N. Zhang T. Kee W.H. Li W. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24392-24400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Also, STAT3 Tyr-705 phosphorylation induced by the tyrosine kinase Bmx has been shown to be inhibited by overexpression of PKCδ (35Saharinen P. Ekman N. Sarvas K. Parker P. Alitalo K. Silvennoinen O. Blood. 1997; 90: 4341-4353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is conceivable that these observations are due to secondary effects such as the activation of tyrosine phosphatases or the up-regulation of negative feedback proteins such as suppressors of cytokine signaling, rather than a direct consequence of STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation. These results suggest that besides a positive effect on STAT3 phosphorylation and transactivation, PKCδ may also participate in negative control mechanisms that need to be further explored. Comparing the kinetics of IL-6-induced STAT3 Ser-727 and PKCδ phosphorylation in the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of HepG2 cells suggests that STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation is mainly a nuclear event. Upon IL-6 stimulation, STAT3 is quickly phosphorylated on Tyr-705 and translocated to the nucleus; both of these event occur rapidly, within 2 min after stimulation. In contrast, PKCδ Thr-505 phosphorylation and STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation were observed with delayed kinetics and reached maximal levels at 5 and 10 min after IL-6 stimulation, respectively. Furthermore, both PKCδ Thr-505 and STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation was observed only in nuclear and not in cytoplasmic fractions of HepG2 cells, even upon a long exposure of the blots. Although it has recently been reported that PKCδ-STAT3 associations occur mainly in the cytoplasm (24Jain N. Zhang T. Kee W.H. Li W. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24392-24400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), our data suggest that STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation in response to IL-6 occurs predominantly in the nucleus. This also implies that STAT3 Tyr-705 phosphorylation is a prerequisite for PKCδ-induced STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation. Indeed, stimulation of HepG2 cells with PMA, which is a very potent activator of PKCδ, does not induce STAT3 Tyr-705 phosphorylation 2J. J. Schuringa, E. Vellenga, and W. Kruijer, unpublished observations. or result in its association with STAT3 (24Jain N. Zhang T. Kee W.H. Li W. Cao X. J. Biol.

Here, we have identified rapid non-nuclear estrogen effects on the expression of the early growth response gene-1 (Egr-1) in cardiomyocytes. Egr-1mRNA and protein were rapidly and strongly induced by estrogen in an estrogen receptor-dependent manner via the extracellular signal-regulated kinase, ERK1/2. A promoter analysis study of a 1.2-kilobase Egr-1 promoter fragment revealed that the serum response elements (SREs) but not the estrogen response elements or AP-1 sites are responsible for Egr-1 induction by estrogen, identifying a novel mechanism of estrogen receptor-dependent gene activation in the myocardium. Both estrogen receptor-α and -β induced the Egr-1 promoter via the SREs as well as an artificial promoter consisting of only five SREs in cardiomyocytes. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that a protein complex containing serum response factor or an antigenically related protein was recruited to the SREs by estrogen treatment of primary cardiomyocytes. The recruitment of the protein complex was inhibited by the specific estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780 as well as the MEK inhibitor PD 98059. Taken together, these results identify SREs as important promoter control elements for an estrogen receptor-dependent mechanism of gene activation in the myocardium.

Med. 1999; 131: 463-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These findings call for a better understanding of the role and function of estrogen and estrogen-like substances in the heart. The vast majority of studies have concentrated on vascular hormone effects (4Karas R.H. Baur W.E. van Eickles M. Mendelsohn M.E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 5Mendelsohn M.E. Karas R.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 1801-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2524) Google Scholar). However, cardioprotection by estrogen is not necessarily restricted to the vasculature. We have previously shown that functional estrogen receptors in the myocardium regulate the expression of relevant target genes such as connexin 43 (6) and α-myosin heavy chain, one of the major contractile proteins in the heart (7Pelzer, T., De Jager, T., Muck, J., Stimpel, M., and Neyses, L. (1999) in Scientific Conference on Molecular, Cellular and Integrated Physiological Approaches to the Failing Heart, Snowbird, UT, August 18–22, 1999 (Izumo, S., and Shannon, P., eds) Abstr. 207, American Heart Association's Council on Basic Cardiovascular Sciences, Snowbird, UT.Google Scholar). In addition to the classical genomic regulation of target gene expression, a new role for estrogens as mediators of rapid non-genomic effects has recently been identified. These rapid effects include the stimulation of nitric oxide release in vascular cells (8Chen Z. Yuhanna I.S. Galcheva-Gargova Z. Karas R.H. Mendelsohn M.E. Shaul P.W. J. Clin.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In the present work we have for the first time analyzed in detail one of the mechanisms of rapid gene induction by estrogen in the myocardium by performing a detailed promoter analysis of a bona fide estrogen target gene identified by us, the early growth response gene 1 (Egr-1). Surprisingly, a cluster of serum response elements (SREs) turned out to be the determinants of transcriptional Egr-1activation by estrogen in primary cardiomyocytes. Contrary to our original hypothesis neither the estrogen response elements (EREs) nor the AP-1 sites in the Egr-1 promoter fragment are relevant in this context. Primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were isolated from 2-day-old Wistar rats as described previously (17Hammes A. Oberdorf-Maass S. Rother T. Nething K. Gollnick F. Linz K.W. Meyer R. Hu K. Han H. Gaudron P. Ertl G. Hoffmann S. Ganten U. Vetter R. Schuh K. Benkwitz C. Zimmer H.G. Neyses L. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 877-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Cells were preplated for 1.5 h to remove non-myocytes, and the supernatant containing the cardiomyocytes was collected. Cells were counted in a Fuchs-Rosenthal chamber and seeded onto Petri dishes at a density of 8 × 104 cells/cm2 in phenol-red free minimum Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 292 mg/liter l-glutamine, 350 mg/liter sodium bicarbonate (Sigma), and 5% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum (CC-Pro). Cells were cultured for 24 h at 37 °C with 1% CO2 after which myocytes were washed with PBS and the medium was changed to phenol-red free minimum Eagle's medium containing 2% controlled process serum replacement-1 (CPSR-1, Sigma). Cardiomyocyte cultures contained 95% myocytes as assessed by immunofluorescence staining with an antibody against the cardiomyocyte-specific troponin-T (Sigma). Myocytes were treated with 10 nm water-soluble 17β-estradiol (E2, Sigma) ± 1 µm specific estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780 (Zeneca) for the indicated times. Cells were washed with 1× PBS, and total RNA was isolated using the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). 10 µg of total RNA was electrophoresed in 1% agarose gels containing formaldehyde and blotted onto nylon membranes (Hybond N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridizations were performed at 68 °C in Quickhyb solution (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's suggestions. cDNA probes for Egr-1and GAPDH were labeled radioactively using a random primed labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were washed by several changes of washing buffer (2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS) at 68 °C, and radioactivity was detected by exposure to x-ray film or by phosphorimaging. After E2 treatment for the indicated number of times, cells were washed with 1× PBS and lysed in 6-well plates by adding 200 µl of Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad). Samples were sonicated to break up DNA strands and boiled for 5 min, and proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Resolved proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk powder, 0.05% Tween 20 in 1× PBS. Immunoblotting was performed with polyclonal antibodies directed against Egr-1 (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), actin (1:500, Santa Cruz), phospho-specific polyclonal antibodies against activated ERK1/2 (1:500, New England Biolabs), polyclonal antibodies against SRF (1:1000, Santa Cruz), and monoclonal antibodies against ERK1/2 (1:500, New England Biolabs). Immunoreactive proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The 1.2-kilobase Egr-1 promoter (GenBank™ accession number X12617) as well as the deletion constructs were cloned in the SalI site of the pXP2 luciferase vector (Invitrogen) and have been described previously (18Cohen D.M. Gullans S.R. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12903-12908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The sizes and positions of the deletions are shown in Fig. 2B. Briefly, construct B consisted of the Egr-1 promoter fragment between positions −689 and −1200 plus nucleotides −1 to −311. Construct C consisted of 501 base pairs containing 5 SREs located between positions −199 and −700 of the Egr-1 promoter. Construct D consisted of 186 base pairs containing 3 SREs located between positions −514 and −700 of the Egr-1 promoter. The cis-reporter plasmid pSRE-luc contains a basic promoter element (TATA box) joined to five tandem repeats of thec-fos SRE cloned in front of the luciferase reporter gene (Stratagene catalog no. 219080). Primary cardiomyocytes were transfected using an adenovirus-based carrier system for myocardial cells extensively modified by our group (19Kohout T.A. O'Brian J.J. Gaa S.T. Lederer W.J. Rogers T.B. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). 4 × 1010 particles/ml replication-deficient RR5 adenovirus were coated with 2 mg/ml poly-l-lysine (Sigma) for 50 min. 1 µg of DNA was added to the virus/poly-l-lysine mixture and incubated for 30 min to bind the DNA to the poly-l-lysine. Another coat of poly-l-lysine was added, and the DNA-bound virus was incubated with the cells in serum- and antibiotic-free minimum Eagle's medium/OptiMEM (4:1, Life Technologies, Inc.) for 2.5 h. After 2.5 h, virus particles in the transfection medium were removed by washing, and fresh growth medium was added and incubated overnight. Luciferase activity was measured using a luciferase assay kit (Promega), and protein measurement served to standardize the transfections. Data are expressed as the fold induction compared with untreated controls ± S.E. for the indicated number of experiments. Statistical analyses were performed using Student'st test. Nuclear extracts of cardiomyocytes were prepared according to standard methods (20Marienfeld R. Neumann M. Chuvpilo S. Escher C. Kneitz B. Avots A. Schimpl A. Serfling E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1601-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For each EMSA 3 µg of nuclear extract were incubated with 50,000–100,000 cpm of a 32P-labeled SRE probe derived from the murine Egr-1 promoter. Oligonucleotide probes used were as follows: SRE 3, 5′-CAGCGCCTTATATGGAGTGG-3′; SRE 4, 5′-ACAGACCTTATTTGGGCAGC-3′; SRE 5, 5′-AAACGCCATATAAGGAGCAG-3′. The reaction contained 1 µg of poly(dI·dC) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)/3 µg of nuclear protein as nonspecific competitor. Samples were incubated at 4 °C for 10 min before loading onto 5% polyacrylamide gels that were pre-run for 2 h in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA. Electrophoresis was continued at 220 V to fractionate the protein-DNA complexes. Gels were vacuum-dried in a gel dryer (Bio-Rad) and exposed to x-ray film. For supershift assays 1 µg of a polyclonal rabbit antibody against SRF (Santa Cruz) was added to the reaction mixture. Controls containing antibodies incubated with labeled oligo in the absence of protein were included to ensure that the antibodies did not bind to the DNA directly (not shown). Treatment of isolated neonatal cardiomyocytes with 10 nm E2 resulted in a rapid and transient induction of Egr-1 mRNA after 15 min of treatment (Fig.1A), followed by induction of Egr-1 protein after 90 min (Fig. 1 B). The rapid induction of Egr-1 was completely inhibited by the pure estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780 (Fig. 1, A and B). Because Egr-1 is rapidly induced via ERK1/2 in other cell types, we tested whether this mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathway is relevant to Egr-1 induction by E2 in cardiomyocytes. Cells were treated with the MEK inhibitor PD 98059 or the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB 202190 to differentiate between the involvement of both signaling pathways. PD 98059 completely blocked Egr-1 protein induction by estrogen. This was not the case when the p38 MAPK was inhibited by SB 202190 (Fig. 1 B). The activation through phosphorylation of ERK1/2 by estrogen was tested. E2 treatment resulted in a rapid activation of ERK1/2 within 5 min in a similar manner to fetal calf serum and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulation (Fig.1 C). Egr-1 was therefore rapidly activated by E2in an estrogen receptor-dependent pathway comprising ERK1/2 but not p38 MAPK. To characterize the mechanisms underlying Egr-1 induction, we analyzed a 1.2-kilobase Egr-1 promoter fragment for potential estrogen response elements. The presence of two putative AP-1 sites in the upstream region of the Egr-1 promoter has been described by others (18Cohen D.M. Gullans S.R. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12903-12908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 21Schwachtgen J.L. Houston P. Campbell C. Sukhatme V. Braddock M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2540-2549Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Two ERE half-palindromic sites separated by 20 base pairs in close vicinity to the 2 AP-1 sites were identified. It has previously been shown that estrogen receptors can regulate the expression of genes via repetitive half-palindromic ERE sites (22Aumais J.P. Lee H.S. DeGannes C. Horsford J. White J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12568-12577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and through AP-1 sites (23Paech K. Webb P. Kuiper G.G. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J. Kushner P.J. Scanlan T.S. Science. 1997; 277: 1508-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (2074) Google Scholar). Further binding sites for regulatory factors in the Egr-1 promoter fragment include 5 SREs. The Egr-1 promoter fragment cloned in front of a luciferase reporter (Egr-1-luc) was induced 6-fold by E2 in primary rat cardiomyocytes (n = 11, p≤ 0.001). This induction was mediated specifically by estrogen receptors, as it was significantly inhibited by the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780 (Fig.2 A, n = 11,p ≤ 0.001). To identify control elements in the Egr-1promoter through which estrogen induces Egr-1, a deletion construct containing two ERE half-sites as well as two AP1 sites (Construct B; see Fig. 2 B) was analyzed first, because it contains known target sites for estrogen receptors. The basal activity of this construct was 7% compared with the entire promoter fragment, and E2 treatment resulted in only a minor induction (Fig.2 B). This suggested that ERE half-sites and AP-1 sites are not major contributors to the estrogen effect on Egr-1in this cell system. Therefore, other deletion constructs containing the cluster of 5 SREs (Construct C) as well as a deletion construct containing only the 3 most upstream SREs (Construct D) were analyzed. Constructs C and D were induced 6- and 4-fold, respectively, by E2 (Fig. 2 B, n= 7, p ≤ 0.001). These results showed that E2-dependent regulation of Egr-1 in myocardial cells resides in the SRE-containing promoter region. This finding has not been described before. Because we have recently identified both estrogen receptor α and β in cardiac muscle cells (6Grohe C. Kahlert S. Loebbert K. Stimpel M. Karas R.H. Vetter H. Neyses L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), co-transfection experiments were performed to delineate the respective roles of these two receptors in the rapid induction of an estrogen target gene in the heart. Co-transfection of ERα or ERβ with Egr-1-luc resulted in a 21- and 19-fold induction, respectively, of the promoter fragment in the presence of E2 (Fig. 3A). This showed that both estrogen receptors are able to activate Egr-1expression to an approximately similar extent. Because constructs containing SREs but no estrogen receptor DNA binding sites (constructs C and D) reacted to E2 stimulation in a manner similar to the entire promoter fragment, it was investigated as to whether ERα and/or ERβ could induce the transcriptional activity of these constructs. Overexpression of ERα resulted in a 13- and 9-fold induction of constructs C and D, respectively, whereas ERβ overexpression resulted in a 20- and 12-fold induction, respectively (Fig. 3, B and C). Taken together these results showed that both estrogen receptors are able to activate Egr-1expression. Furthermore, this demonstrated that the SRE-containing promoter region and not the ERE/AP-1-containing region is the main control region for both ERα- and ERβ-mediated induction of Egr-1 induction in cardiomyocytes. To test whether the SREs in the Egr-1 promoter are responsible for the induction by estrogen, an artificial promoter containing 5 SREs cloned in front of a luciferase reporter gene was transfected into primary neonatal cardiomyocytes (Fig.4A). Estrogen treatment resulted in a 3.3-fold induction of this artificial promoter construct (n = 7; p < 0.05). The specific estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780 inhibited the induction by estrogen, showing a specific estrogen-receptor mediated induction via SREs. Overexpression of ERα as well as ERβ resulted in a 9- and 6.5-fold induction of this artificial SRE-containing promoter construct (Fig. 4 B). These data therefore demonstrates that SRE motifs alone can confer an estrogen response to a heterologous promoter and that this response is mediated specifically via both ERα and ERβ. EMSAs were performed utilizing nuclear extracts prepared from E2-treated and untreated cardiomyocytes to investigate whether estrogen treatment induced binding of transcription factors to the SREs in the Egr-1 promoter. Oligonucleotide probes matching the 3 upstream SREs (the SREs contained in Construct D; see Fig.2 B) were used in EMSAs. These SREs were chosen because construct D (containing only these SREs) was still significantly induced by estrogen (see Fig. 2 B). The formation of specific protein-DNA complexes was induced by E2 treatment when oligonucleotides representing either SRE 3, 4, or 5 were used (Fig.5A, representative data for SRE 5 are shown), indicating that hormone treatment altered the transcription factor recruitment in an estrogen-dependent fashion. Analysis of the effect of inhibitors of the different signaling pathways on complex formation showed that ICI 182,780 as well as the MEK inhibitor PD 98059, but not the p38 MAPK inhibitors SB 202190 and SB 203580, inhibited the formation of specific protein-DNA complexes (Fig. 5 B). This finding is in accordance with the induction pattern of Egr-1 observed at the endogenous protein level (see Fig. 1 B). Supershift assays with polyclonal antibodies against the serum response factor (SRF) identified a protein with the antigenic characteristics of SRF as one of the proteins in the protein-DNA complex (Fig. 5 A). Taken together these results identify a novel mechanism of gene activation by estrogen receptors: in the myocardium estrogen results in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Activation of the MAPK pathway ultimately leads to the recruitment of transcription factors that are antigenically related to SRF, to the SREs of the Egr-1 promoter, and to subsequent gene induction. In this study we show the following. 1) The early growth response gene-1 (Egr-1), a zinc finger transcription factor (24Gashler A. Sukhatme V.P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 50: 191-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), is rapidly induced by physiological concentrations of 17β-estradiol in cardiomyocytes. 2) This induction is estrogen receptor-dependent and mediated via activation of the ERK1/2 pathway. 3) The serum response elements and not the estrogen response elements or AP-1 sites in the Egr-1 promoter are responsible for the activation by estrogen. 4) SRE motifs alone are able to confer an estrogen receptor-dependent estrogen response to a heterologous promoter. 5) Estrogen treatment leads to the recruitment of a transcription factor(s), which includes SRF or a SRF-like protein, to the SREs. 6) Together, these results identify a novel rapid mechanism of gene activation by estrogen in the myocardium. Egr-1 is a transcription factor with an important function in various tissues including the cardiovascular system. In atherosclerotic lesions of mice and humans, elevated levels of Egr-1 mRNA as well as elevated levels of Egr-1-inducible genes such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), platelet-derived growth factor-α (PDGF-A), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), transforming growth factor-β1 and -β3 (TGFβ1 and -β3), and superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) were detected implying a function for Egr-1 in repair of vascular lesions after injury (25McCaffrey T.A. Fu C. Du B. Eksinar S. Kent K.C. Bush Jr., H. Kreiger K. Rosengart T. Cybulsky M.I. Silverman E.S. Collins T. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a function for Egr-1 in the myocardium has been indicated by studies showing that Egr-1 is highly induced in hypertrophied hearts (26Saadane N. Alpert L. Chalifour L.E. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 1165-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Our group has shown that Egr-1 can also be induced by hypertrophic stimuli such as endothelin, angiotensin II, adrenoreceptor stimulation, or stretch treatment of cardiomyocytes (27Shamim A. Pelzer T. Grohe C. Neyses L. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 195: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 28Neyses L. Nouskas J. Luyken J. Fronhoffs S. Oberdorf S. Pfeifer U. Williams R.S. Sukhatme V.P. Vetter H. J. Hypertens. 1993; 11: 927-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A pathophysiologically relevant function for Egr-1 in the myocardium is also suggested by the results from Saadane et al. (29Saadane N. Alpert L. Chalifour L.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: H796-H805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) who showed that the lack of Egr-1 in mice results in altered expression of pathophysiologically relevant myocardial genes. It has also been shown that the overexpression of Egr-1 in neonatal cardiomyocytes resulted in the induction of α-myosin heavy chain, indicating a role of Egr-1 as a mediator of myocardial contractile gene expression (30Gupta M.P. Gupta M. Zak R. Sukhatme V.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12813-12816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The induction of Egr-1 by estrogen in the myocardium provides evidence that estrogen directly acts on cardiomyocytes and represents a possible mechanism by which estrogen could modulate the expression of important myocardial genes downstream of Egr-1 such as the major contractile protein α-myosin heavy chain. In another study we have in fact shown that estrogen does modulate the expression of α-myosin heavy chain in spontaneously hypertensive rats, an in vivo model of cardiac hypertrophy (7Pelzer, T., De Jager, T., Muck, J., Stimpel, M., and Neyses, L. (1999) in Scientific Conference on Molecular, Cellular and Integrated Physiological Approaches to the Failing Heart, Snowbird, UT, August 18–22, 1999 (Izumo, S., and Shannon, P., eds) Abstr. 207, American Heart Association's Council on Basic Cardiovascular Sciences, Snowbird, UT.Google Scholar). Although this was a long-term animal study, the induction of Egr-1 by estrogen might represent a possible mechanism for the alteration of α-myosin heavy chain expression by estrogen. The focus of the present work was on the molecular mechanisms of estrogen action in the myocardium. The results revealed a novel way of estrogen receptor-dependent gene induction in the heart. Promoter analysis showed that transcriptional activation of myocardial genes by estrogen receptors can be mediated via serum response elements. The Egr-1 promoter contains two estrogen response element half-sites, two AP-1 sites in the distal region, and a proximal region with five functional serum response elements. In transfection experiments we could show that, contrary to our original hypothesis, the ERE/AP-1 sites do not play a role in the induction of the Egr-1 promoter by estrogen. This result was unexpected because it has been shown that estrogen receptors are able to bind to repetitive ERE half-sites or half-sites separated by several base pairs, resulting in gene activation (22Aumais J.P. Lee H.S. DeGannes C. Horsford J. White J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12568-12577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that differential effects of the two known estrogen receptors on gene activation may be mediated via AP-1 sites (23Paech K. Webb P. Kuiper G.G. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J. Kushner P.J. Scanlan T.S. Science. 1997; 277: 1508-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (2074) Google Scholar). This is, however, not the case for the Egr-1 promoter in cardiomyocytes, where both receptors have an activation function. The serum response elements in the Egr-1 promoter region were instead essential for estrogen inducibility. A construct containing all 5 SREs as well as a construct containing only the three most upstream sites were both induced by estrogen, showing that serum response elements play important roles in gene activation by estrogen. A study has provided indirect evidence for the involvement of SREs and AP-1 sites in the activation of c-Fos by estrogen via MAPK in neuroblastoma cells (14Watters J.J. Campbell J.S. Cunningham M.J. Krebs E.G. Dorsa D.M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4030-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), but no direct experiments for the induction via SREs were shown. While this manuscript was in the revision process, a paper was accepted for publication in this journal showing that estrogen induced the c-fos promoter via the SRE (the c-fos promoter contains only one SRE and no EREs) in MCF-7 cells (31Duan R. Xie W. Burghardt R.C. Safe S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11590-11598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The authors also showed that the induction was mediated in an estrogen receptor-dependent manner via ERK1/2. This study in mammary carcinoma cells is therefore in accordance with our work in cardiomyocytes, showing that the estrogen receptor-mediated gene induction via SREs may be a rather general phenomenon that can be extrapolated to other target genes and cell types. Our analysis of the signaling pathways involved in Egr-1 activation in cardiomyocytes demonstrated that it is specifically mediated via ERK1/2 but not the p38 MAPK pathway, because Egr-1 activation was abolished by the MEK inhibitor PD 98059 but not by the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB 202190. This finding is in accordance with observations in other cell systems showing that Egr-1 activation is mediated by an ERK1/2-dependent mechanism (32Chiu J.J. Wung B.S. Hsieh H.J. Lo L.W. Wang D.L. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 33Hodge C. Liao J. Stofega M. Guan K. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31327-31336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 34Zhang Z. Yang X.Y. Cohen D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1104-C1112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p38 MAPK has also been implicated in the activation of Egr-1 (35Lim C.P. Jain N. Cao X. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2915-2926Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), but this is clearly not the case in cardiomyocytes. Analysis of the protein complex bound to the SREs upon E2 treatment revealed that a protein complex containing a factor antigenically similar to SRF is recruited to the SREs in response to physiological estrogen levels. An anti-SRF antibody resulted in a supershift of this complex. Because transcription factors of the TCF (ternary complex factor) family are phosphorylated specifically by ERK1/2 and have also been shown to interact directly with SRF resulting in the activation of target genes via serum response elements (36Ling Y. West A.G. Roberts E.C. Lakey J.H. Sharrocks A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10506-10514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the possibility cannot be completely excluded that a TCF member, in addition to SRF, is involved in the induction of Egr-1 by estrogen. Bernal-Mizrachi et al. (37Bernal-Mizrachi E. Wice B. Inoue H. Permutt M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25681-25689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) showed that Egr-1 is induced upon glucose treatment of pancreatic β-cells via the proximal 2 SREs in the Egr-1 promoter and that this induction is, at least in part, mediated via the protein kinase A and Ca2+/CaM pathways and not via the ERK1/2 pathways. Interestingly, this induction is mediated via the proximal SREs, whereas the distal SREs are relevant for induction by estrogen, suggesting differential functions for these elements. Nevertheless, these data, together with our data suggest that the SREs in the Egr-1 promoter might act as a point of convergence of different signaling pathways activated upon various stimuli in the cell. However, because different cell types were used in the experiments, no definite conclusion can be drawn. Evidence for activation of MAPK by estrogen is also provided by a study showing that estrogen receptors are capable of activating c-Src kinase, putatively by direct interaction, leading to activation of the downstream c-src effectors in MCF-7 breast cancer cells (38Migliaccio A. Di Domenico M. Castoria G. de Falco A. Bontempo P. Nola E. Auricchio F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1292-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar,39Migliaccio A. Piccolo D. Castoria G. Di Domenico M. Bilancio A. Lombardi M. Gong W. Beato M. Auricchio F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2008-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), as well as by a more recent study showing that estrogen induced the prolactin gene via MAPK activation in rat pituitary cells (40Watters J.J. Chun T.Y. Kim Y.N. Bertics P.J. Gorski J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1872-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In both of these mechanisms of MAPK activation, extranuclear estrogen receptors are involved, and in the latter study the involvement of a membrane-bound estrogen receptor-α is postulated. It has been shown in primary Chinese hamster ovary cells that overexpression of ERα and ERβ leads to expression of intracellular receptors as well membrane-associated receptors (41Razandi M. Pedram A. Greene G.L. Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). It is therefore not possible to draw any conclusions on the involvement of potentially membrane-bound estrogen receptors in the rapid effects described here. Investigation of the role of the two estrogen receptor subtypes revealed that both ERα and ERβ were able to induce transcriptional activation of the Egr-1 promoter in co-transfection experiments. No statistically significant differential effects of the two receptors on Egr-1 promoter induction were observed. These effects were also due to specific action of the transfected receptors, because the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780 inhibited induction by both ERα and ERβ. Analysis of the SRE-containing promoter region as well as a heterologous promoter containing only 5 SREs also showed that both ERα and ERβ, or eventually heterodimers formed between transfected and endogenous receptors, were able to induce the Egr-1 promoter via the SREs, indicating that each receptor individually may be involved in rapid non-nuclear estrogen effects. It will be interesting to investigate whether ERα and ERβ behave differently with respect to rapid activation of the pathway we describe when different estrogenic ligands and/or different cellular contexts are used. Taken together, this study shows that rapid non-nuclear action of estrogen receptors is relevant to myocardial gene activation and can lead to a genomic nuclear response. The rapid induction of Egr-1 by both ERα and ERβ may in theory represent a mechanism by which estrogen, via extranuclear estrogen receptors, exerts an array of effects through modulation of Egr-1 target gene expression. Conceptually it is possible that modulation of gene expression by estrogen or estrogen-like substances through the pathway we describe here might have a therapeutic potential in the treatment of myocardial disease.

The library was constructed with complete randomization of 19 of the 23 CDR3 residues and was panned against two monoclonal antibody targets to generate VH sequences for determination of the antigen contact residue positions. Furthermore, the feasibility and desirability of introducing a disulfide bridge between CDR1 and CDR3 was investigated. Sequences derived from the library showed a bias toward the use of C-terminal CDR3 residues as antigen contact residues. Mass spectrometric analyses indicated that CDR1-CDR3 disulfide formation was universal. However, surface plasmon resonance and NMR data showed that the CDR3 constraint imposed by the disulfide bridge was not always desirable. Very high yields of soluble protein products and lack of protein aggregation, as demonstrated by the quality of the1H-15N HSQC spectra, indicated that the VH sequence for library construction was a good choice. These results should be useful in the design of VHlibraries with optimal features. We have constructed a human VHlibrary based on a camelized VH sequence.

Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), lack light chains and as a result have variable domains that reflect the absence of a VL partner. Single domain antibodies (dAbs)1 derived from the variable domains (VHHs) of these antibodies are highly soluble and the structural basis of solubility has been partially elucidated. First, conserved human/murine interface residues are generally replaced in heavy chain antibodies by residues that increase the hydrophilicity of the VL interface either by non-polar to polar substitutions or, in a more subtle way, by inducing local conformational changes (3Desmyter A. Transue T.R. Ghahroudi M.A. Thi M.H. Poortmans F. Hamers R. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 4Spinelli S. Frenken L.

This explanation is supported by experiments in which an insoluble human VH was made soluble by introducing these substitutions (5Davies J. Riechmann L. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Second, in the solved structures of two camel dAbs, the CDR3s fold back on the VHsurface, masking a significant surface area of the VLinterface (3Desmyter A. Transue T.R. Ghahroudi M.A. Thi M.H. Poortmans F. Hamers R. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 4Spinelli S. Frenken L. Bourgeois D. de Ron L. Bos W. Verrips T.

Structure. 1999; 7: 361-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Two other features of VHHs are noteworthy. One is the frequent occurrence of cysteine residues in CDR1 and CDR3 (7Nguyen V.K. Hamers R. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 8Muyldermans S. Atarhouch T. Saldanha J. Barbosa J.A. Hamers R. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 9Lauwereys M. Arbabi G.M. Desmyter A. Kinne J. Holzer W. De Genst E. Wyns L. Muyldermans S.

While the location of the CDR1 cysteine is typically fixed, that of the CDR3 cysteine varies. These two residues form a disulfide linkage between CDR1 and CDR3 (3Desmyter A. Transue T.R. Ghahroudi M.A. Thi M.H. Poortmans F. Hamers R. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 11Davies J. Riechmann L. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of a dAb-lysozyme complex, the disulfide linkage imparts rigidity on the CDR3 loop that extends out of the combining site and penetrates deep into the active site of lysozyme (3Desmyter A. Transue T.R. Ghahroudi M.A. Thi M.H. Poortmans F. Hamers R. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). A second feature is the longer average length of the VHH CDR3, relative to human or murine VHs (8Muyldermans S. Atarhouch T. Saldanha J. Barbosa J.A. Hamers R. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). A longer CDR3 increases the antigen-binding surface and partially compensates for the absence of the antigen-binding surface provided by the VL in conventional antibodies (3Desmyter A. Transue T.R. Ghahroudi M.A. Thi M.H. Poortmans F. Hamers R. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). As antigen-binding fragments, dAbs are an attractive alternative to scFvs because of their much smaller size and the fact that they have affinities comparable to those of scFvs (4Spinelli S. Frenken L. Bourgeois D. de Ron L. Bos W. Verrips T. Anguille C. Cambillau C. Tegoni M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 752-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 9Lauwereys M. Arbabi G.M.

Biol. 1999; 290: 685-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Smaller size is an advantage in applications requiring tissue penetration and rapid blood clearance. Smaller molecules also offer a tremendous advantage in terms of structural studies (5Davies J. Riechmann L. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 16Constantine K.L. Goldfarb V. Wittekind M. Anthony J. Ng S.C. Mueller L.

NMR. 1993; 3: 41-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Phage antibody library construction is much simpler and more efficient with dAbs as compared with Fabs or scFvs. Randomization can be introduced at a much higher percentage of CDR positions without exceeding practical library size. The problem of shuffling original VL-VH pairings is also avoided. Camelid phage dAb libraries constructed from the VHH repertoire of camels immunized with target antigens have performed well (6Decanniere K. Desmyter A. Lauwereys M. Ghahroudi M.A. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. Structure. 1999; 7: 361-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 9Lauwereys M. Arbabi G.M. Desmyter A. Kinne J. Holzer W. De Genst E. Wyns L. Muyldermans S.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). However, in addition to the obvious problems of this approach, the non-human nature of products from these libraries limits their usefulness. Synthetic dAb libraries (13Davies J. Riechmann L. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 15Reiter Y. Schuck P. Boyd L.F. Plaksin D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 685-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), particularly those based on a human VH framework, alleviate these problems. Here we describe the construction of camelized human dAb library that is based on the VH of the human monoclonal antibody BT32/A6 (18Dan M.D. Earley E.M. Griffin M.C. Maiti P.K. Prashar A.K. Yuan X.Y. Friesen A.D. Kaplan H.A. J. Neurosurg. 1995; 82: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In prior experimental studies with this VH, 2J. Tanha, S. Narang, H. Kaplan, M. Dan, and C. R. MacKenzie, unpublished results. the length of its CDR3 and its solubility properties were found to be remarkable, features which were later determined to be characteristic of camelid heavy chain antibodies (1Hamers-Casterman C. Atarhouch T. Muyldermans S. Robinson G. Hamers C. Songa Baiyana B. Bendahman N. Hamers R. Nature. 1993; 363: 446-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (2205) Google Scholar). To generate the library, the CDR3 was randomized and cysteine residues were introduced at key positions with the expectation that the residues would form the CDR1-CDR3 disulfide bridge found in the camel antibody cAb-Lys3 (3Desmyter A. Transue T.R. Ghahroudi M.A. Thi M.H. Poortmans F. Hamers R. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The library was evaluated by panning against two monoclonal antibody targets. Wild type dAb (Fig.1) was constructed from BT32/A6 (18Dan M.D. Earley E.M. Griffin M.C. Maiti P.K. Prashar A.K. Yuan X.Y. Friesen A.D. Kaplan H.A. J. Neurosurg. 1995; 82: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Two camelized versions, BT32/A6.ERG and BT32/A6.ERI (TableI), were constructed by standard protocols (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). BT32/A6.ERG was used as the template in PCR to amplify a shorter fragment using primers 5′-TGTTCAGCTAGCGGATTCACCTTCAGTAGCTATTGTATGCACTGGGTCCGC-3′ (A6VH.33C) containing the NheI site (underlined) and 5′-TGCTGCACAGTAATACACAGCCGT-3′. At the protein level this introduces Cys and two Ala residues at positions 33, 93, and 94, respectively. In camelid VHHs, positions 93 and 94 are predominantly occupied by Ala residues and Cys is frequently found at position 33 (8, 10). The mutated fragment was used as the template in a second PCR using the primers A6VH.33C and 5′-GCCCCAGATATCAAA(A/CNN)9GCA(A/CNN)10TGCTGCACAGTAATA-3′. The second primer results in the randomization of the first 19 residues in CDR3, with the exception of 100e where a Cys is introduced to facilitate the formation of intramolecular disulfide linkage between 33Cys and 100eCys in CDR1 and CDR3, respectively. The amplified fragments were used as templates in a third round of PCR employing primers A6VH.33C and 5′-TGAGGAGACGGTGACCGTTGTCCCTTGG-CCCCAGATATCAAA-3′ to incorporate a 3′ end BstEII site (underlined). The amplified fragments were purified, digested with NheI andBstEII, and ligated toNheI/BstEII-treated pSJF6-BT32/A6VH phagemid. 3S. J. Foote, personal communication. The product was desalted using spin columns and used to transform Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue. Growth of the library was performed as described by Harrison et al. (20Harrison J.L. Williams S.C. Winter G. Nissim A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 267: 83-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To sub-clone the library into a phage vector, library phagemid DNA template (180 pmol) and two primers which were complimentary to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the dAb genes, and incorporated flanking ApaLI and NotI restriction sites, were used to PCR amplify the dAb genes. The products were purified, cut with ApaLI and NotI, purified, and ligated to the ApaLI/NotI-digested phage vector fd-tetGIIID (21MacKenzie R. To R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1998; 220: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Following this, 1.5 μg of the desalted ligated product was mixed with 40 μl of competent E. colistrain TG1 and the cells were transformed by electroporation. Using standard methods, the sizes of the phagemid and phage libraries were determined to be 2.1 × 107 and 6.6 × 107, respectively. Phage were produced and purified as described previously (20Harrison J.L. Williams S.C. Winter G. Nissim A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 267: 83-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One clone, R3A10 (Table I), was selected from the phage library because of its higher yield of soluble product. Two mutated versions of R3A10, R3A10.G47I and R3A10.G47I/Cys− (Table I), were constructed by standard protocols.Table IVariable residues and solution properties of BT32/A6 VH sDesignationVariable residuesCDR3Solution properties1-aThe solution properties of the various VH molecules are characterized as soluble (s) and structurally folded (f) with broad (b), sharp (s), or partially-sharp (ps) NMR spectra.

Immuno MaxiSorp™ (Nunc) microtiter plate wells were coated overnight by adding 150 μl of 100 μg/ml antigen in PBS. Plates were rinsed three times with PBS, blocked with 400 μl of PBS, 2% (w/v) skim milk (2% MPBS) at 37 °C for 2 h and rinsed as above. Phage (1012transducing units in 2% MPBS) were added and incubated at room temperature for 1.5 h after which unbound phage were removed. The wells were rinsed 10 times with PBS, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and then 10 times with PBS. Bound phage were eluted by adding 200 μl of freshly prepared 100 mm triethylamine and neutralized with 100 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Exponentially growing TG1 cultures (10 ml) were infected with 150 μl of eluted phage at 37 °C for 30 min. Serial dilutions of infected cells were used to determine the titers of eluted phage as described above. The remainders of the infected cells were pelleted, re-suspended in 900 μl of 2 × YT (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), mixed in 300-μl aliquots with 3 ml of 0.7% agarose in LB (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) at 50 °C and the phage propagated on plates overnight at 37 °C. Phage were purified, the titers were determined, and a total of 1011 transducing units of phage were used for further rounds of selection. Clones selected for expression were transferred to an expression vector that added C-terminal c-Myc and His5 tags and were grown as described previously (23Anand N.N. Mandal S. MacKenzie C.R. Sadowska J. Sigurskjold B. Young N.M. Bundle D.R. Narang S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21874-21879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dAbs were purified from periplasmic fractions (24Anand N.N. Dubuc G. Phipps J. MacKenzie C.R. Sadowska J. Young N.M. Bundle D.R. Narang S.A.

To detect the presence of dimer/multimer dAb in protein preparations, gel filtration chromatography was performed using Superdex 75 (Amersham Phamacia Biotech) (26Deng S.J. MacKenzie C.R. Hirama T. Brousseau R. Lowary T.L. Young N.M. Bundle D.R. Narang S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4992-4996Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cold acetone (5 × volume) was added to 200 μg of dAb solution and the contents were mixed and then centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at maximum speed at 4 °C for 10 min. The pellet was dissolved in 500 μl of 6 mguanidine hydrochloride and 55 μl of 1 m Tris buffer, pH 8.0, were added. Subsequently, a 25 m excess of DTT, relative to Cys residues, was added and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. A 2.2 m excess, relative to DTT, of freshly made iodoacetic acid was added and the reaction was incubated as described above. The alkylated product was then concentrated in 50 μl of distilled water using an Ultrafree-MC 10,000 NMWL filter unit (Millipore). Control experiments were identical except that DTT was replaced with water. The molecular sizes of native and iodoacetate-treated dAbs were determined by infusion-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (positive ion mode) using Quatro triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass). Following panning, phage clones were screened by standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay procedures using a horseradish peroxidase/anti-M13 monoclonal antibody conjugate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as the detection reagent. Surface plasmon resonance was performed using a BIACORE Upgrade (Biacore AB) (27Jönsson U. Fågerstam L. Ivarsson B. Johnsson B. Karlsson R. Lundh K. Löfås S. Persson B. Roos H. Rönnberg I. Sjölander S. Sternberg E. Ståhlberg R. Urbaniczky C. Östlin H. Malmqvist M. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 620-627PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 14,000 resonance units of anti-FLAG M2 IgG or control IgG were immobilized on research grade CM5 sensor chips by amine coupling. Single-domain antibodies were passed over the sensor chips surfaces in 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% P-20 (Biacore AB) at 25 °C and at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. To assess the effect of the CDR1-CDR3 disulfide bridge on dAb binding to M2, dAbs were incubated with DTT prior to injection and the above buffer was supplemented with an appropriate amount of DTT. The influence of the disulfide bridge on binding was also investigated by construction and characterization of a mutant, M2R2–1.Cys− (Table I), that lacks the bridge. Surfaces were regenerated with 10 mm HCl. Sensorgram data were analyzed using the BIAevaluation 3.0 software package (Biacore AB). Isotopically labeled proteins were prepared from cells grown in 15N- or15N/13C-enriched Bioexpress medium (Cambridge Isotopes Laboratory). Six-ml amounts of LB (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin were inoculated with single colonies and incubated at 37 °C and 260 rpm until an A 600 of ∼5 was reached. The cells were centrifuged and re-suspended in 3 ml of sterile PBS. Aliquots were transferred to 25 ml of Bioexpress, 100 μg/ml ampicillin in 125-ml Erlenmeyer flasks, to give anA 600 = 0.06, and incubated at 37 °C at 200 rpm for 9–10 h. The dAbs were purified as described above and dialyzed extensively in 10 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mmNaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, at either pH 5.5 or 6.8. NMR samples were prepared by concentrating the protein to ∼1 mm using a YM10 membrane (Amicon). NMR experiments were performed at 298 and/or 308 K on a Bruker Avance-800 spectrometer equipped with pulse field gradient accessories. Two-dimensional1H-15N HSQC spectra (28Bodenhausen G. Ruben D.J. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1980; 69: 185-188Crossref Scopus (2435) Google Scholar) were acquired using solvent suppression via the WATERGATE method implemented through the 3-9-19 pulse train (29Piotto M.

The NMR data were processed using NMRPipe/NMRDraw (32Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol.

Sequence-specific assignments of the backbone NH,15N, and13Cα/13Cβresonances were achieved only for the residues having strong1H-15N HSQC cross-peaks through a combined analysis of the HNCα, HNCαCβ, and CβCα(CO)NH spectra. Chemical-shift values were referenced internally to the proton resonance of sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate and indirectly for15N and 13C assuming γ15N/γ1H = 0.101329118 and γ13C/γ1H = 0.251449530 (34Wishart D.S.

The library was panned, in both formats, against 3B1 scFv. With the phagemid format, panning failed to enrich for binders and PCR analysis of clones selected at different stages of the panning process revealed almost universal deletion of the dAb inserts. This is probably the result of monovalent display since multivalent display with the phage vector format gave seven different dAbs that bound to 3B1 (Table II). As shown in Fig.2, these dAbs bound to the target antigen, 3B1, in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiments with no detectable binding to control BSA. In each instance, the consensus sequence was present at the extreme C-terminal end of CDR3 (TableII).Table IIThe CDR3 sequences of dAbs isolated by panning against 3B1 scFvdAbCDR3 sequence3B1R3–1PITGGAPRAVCKHAKAWFLPFDI3B1R2–3SSQPRVTSSPCVASKSWFLPFDI3B1R2–2PTTGIRGEKDCTPKKMWRLPFDI3B1R2–4RDPSVTDTGCCTPRWQAWLPFDI3B1R3–3PGEPPEASAPCLRHRVGWLPFDI3B1R3–15KTVKMRDDEVCTKRTNWLLPFDI3B1R3–19PGNVASQQNLCGLRATRWLPFDIThe consensus sequence is shown in bold.

In the phage vector format, the library was also panned against M2 IgG, an antibody raised against the FLAG peptide DYKDDDDK (35Knappik A. Plückthun A. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 754-761PubMed Google Scholar) and shown to recognize the consensus sequence XYKXXD (36Miceli R.M. Degraaf M.E. Fischer H.D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 167: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Twenty-four different dAbs with the FLAG consensus sequence were identified by sequencing of clones randomly selected after 3 rounds of panning (Table III). No consensus sequence other than XYKXXD could be identified. Interestingly, like the 3B1 binders, all the FLAG consensus sequences occurred in the C-terminal half of CDR3 and, with two exceptions, occupied identical positions. To ascertain if this observation was related to the presence of CDR1-CDR3 disulfide linkage, the reduced version of the same library was also panned against M2 IgG. Panning, including the washing steps, was performed in the presence 1 μm, 1 mm, 10 mm, and 100 mm DTT. In 13/13, 6/8, 8/8, and 10/10 instances for dAbs obtained by panning in the presence of 1 μm, 1 mm, 10 mm, and 100 mm DTT, respectively, the FLAG consensus sequence was located C terminus of CDR3 (data not shown).Table IIIThe CDR3 sequences of dAbs isolated by panning against M2 IgG in the absence of DTTVQYGKHRRGSCIEVHPEYKDFDI3-aM2R2–1.PRPARTGHKTCFVRPKNYKDFDINPPKPGAQARCVTTVKDYKEFDI3-bM2R2–2.AEAHSQLPPRCRRKTDEYKIFDIAAIQTETARWCDRHPVSYKMFDI3-cM2R2–4.SHKTSQPVRNCSATDNSYKLFDIQTETQPLYNDCILRQAGYKWFDI3-dM2R2–5.TMGTLHSPHECMKSLVTYKNFDIMHTLQHYRNLCSYQLADYKHFDIGRYFQSKITSCENNDRDYKLFDIGLSGSRPNEQCDYKTGDHVQFDI3-eM2R2–10.ELGWRPRVQACHYSRNDYKYFDILSGQNYTKTRCLVMQNDYKMFDI3-fM2R2–13.KDVTRTNTVSCSKDRQDYKMFDITAEPALSPQACMTKERQYKDFDIYSATAKWRDKCYEKSRDYKMFDIETYMYTRGKYCRALSADYKLFDIYEIVPFIASRCVIERADYKLFDIESKASRTADQCSGPTPGYKNFDIADAPNRQKERCVVAVHGYKRFDIGSQAIKNLSECLVRSDDYKKFDI3-gM2R3–4.NEEKFSVYSECELYLPTYKMFDIGRYFQSKITSCENNDRDYKLFDIIWEGEKHYAECVTGTYKQPDFDIThe FLAG consensus sequence is shown in bold.3-a M2R2–1.3-b M2R2–2.3-c M2R2–4.3-d M2R2–5.3-e M2R2–10.3-f M2R2–13.3-g M2R3–4.

Size exclusion chromatography of the non-camelized product revealed three components corresponding to monomer, dimer, and higher oligomer on the basis of their elution volumes. The monomer peak eluted unusually late suggesting that the dAb interacted nonspecifically with the gel matrix. This is a property of human and murine-derived dAbs that is not unusual and which has been documented previously (5Davies J. Riechmann L. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 12Ward E.S. Gussow D. Griffiths A.D. Jones P.T. Winter G. Nature. 1989; 341: 544-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). Camelized BT32/A6 dAbs gave products that were exclusively monomer and which eluted at the expected volume. Formation of the CDR1-CDR3 disulfide linkage was verified by mass spectrometric analysis of alkylated dAbs isolated from the library. The mass spectrum obtained for M2R2-5 after treatment with iodoacetic acid had a major peak with a mass of 16,545.19 ± 2.4 Da (Fig. 3 A) which corresponds to the mass of the untreated protein. In contrast, the major peak observed following reduction and alkylation had a mass of 16,783.29 ± 2.94 Da (Fig.3 B). The mass increase of 237.70 ± 2.94 Da indicates alkylation of 4 Cys residues. Theoretically, alkylation of four cysteines should give a mass increase of 236.16 Da. The 2 additional cysteine residues are the conserved ones at positions 22 and 92. In Fig. 3 A a minor peak corresponding to the M r of a dAb alkylated at one position may have resulted from a side reaction involving alkylation of another amino acid such as histidine. Identical experiments were performed for eight additional anti-M2 dAbs as well as R3A10.G47I and in all instances formation of the CDR1-CDR3 disulfide bridge was confirmed. This demonstrates that disulfide linkage formation is independent of the CDR3 sequence and is likely a function of the overall fold of the protein. The binding to M2 IgG of six of the dAbs listed in Table III (M2R2-1, M2R2-2, M2R2-4, M2R2-10, M2R2-13, and M2R3-4) was investigated by surface plasmon resonance. The binding data fit poorly to a 1:1 interaction model in all instances, making the derivation of kinetic and affinity constants impossible. However, when binding studies were conducted in the presence of DTT it was observed that the amount of binding increased significantly, particularly for M2R2-2. Furthermore, data collected in the pr"

Here, we examine the expression of various orphan receptors in H9c2 cells during ischemic hypoxia and reoxygenation. Among orphan receptors examined, the level of G protein-coupled receptor 41<i>(</i> <i>GPR41</i> <i>)</i> mRNA increases significantly, with a peak at 2 h after reoxygenation, and recovers to the control level by 3 h after reoxygenation. The level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA used as an internal control remains almost constant. The levels of <i>c-fos</i> and <i>c-jun</i>mRNA increase significantly with ischemic hypoxia and reoxygenation. The transfection of GPR41 into H9c2 cells results in a significant decrease in cell number, with DNA fragmentation observed by<i>in vitro</i> and <i>in situ</i> assay. The amount of p53 protein increases significantly in the nuclei of cells expressing GPR41, accompanying an increase in the transcriptional activity of p53. Consistent with the activation of p53, the level of <i>bax</i>mRNA is significantly increased, which leads to an increase in Bax protein. Furthermore, the expression of a deletion mutant of a GPR41, which lacks the G protein binding site and shows an attenuation of intracellular phosphorylation signals to H9c2 cells, inhibits cell death and the increase in p53 protein within 24 h after reoxygenation. These observations demonstrate that GPR41 is a novel receptor that activates p53 leading to apoptosis during reoxygenation after ischemic hypoxia in H9c2 cells. We have designated GPR41 as the hypoxia-induced apoptosis receptor, HIA-R."
https://openalex.org/W1964653442,"To understand the mechanisms that control the cell-specific visual pigment gene transcription, theXenopus rhodopsin 5′ regulatory region has been characterized in vivo using transient transfection ofXenopus embryos and transgenesis. The principal control sequences were located within −233/+41, a region with significant conservation with mammalian rhodopsin genes. DNase footprinting indicated seven distinct regions that contain potentialcis-acting elements. Sequences near the initiation site (−45/+41, basal region) were essential, but not sufficient, for rod-specific transcription. Two negative regulatory regions were found, one between −233 to −202, with no apparent similarity to known elements, and a second Ret-1-like CAAT (−136/−122) motif. Deletion of either sequence led to a 2–3-fold increase in expression levels, without a change in rod specificity. Sequences between −170 to −146, which contain an E-box motif, were necessary for high level expression in transgenic tadpoles but not in transient transfections. Sequences between −84 and −58, which contained an NRE-like consensus were found to be necessary for high level expression in both assays. Although expression levels were modulated by various proximal sequences in the rhodopsin promoter, none of the tested sequences were found to be necessary for rod specificity. Promoter constructs with a consensus BAT-1 sequence in conjunction with an NRE-like element upstream of the basal promoter directed low level green fluorescent protein expression in the central nervous system in transgenic tadpoles. These results suggest that rod cell-specific expression of rhodopsin is controlled by redundant elements in the proximal promoter.

The Retina: An Approachable Part of the Brain. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA1987: 12-41Google Scholar). These cells express a number of specific proteins that regulate the light-dependent currents mediating vision (2Hargrave P.A. McDowell J.H. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2323-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar,3Yarfitz S. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14329-14332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among these cell-specific proteins are the visual pigments, which combine with 11-cis-retinal to form the light-sensitive component of the transduction cascade. The visual pigments are a large family of genes, which contain rod-specific rhodopsins and at least four classes of cone-specific opsins (4Yokoyama S. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Rhodopsin, required for nocturnal vision, is the most abundant opsin in many vertebrate retinae by virtue of the size of the rod outer segments, abundance of the rod cells, and the high level of transcription. As such, the regulation of rhodopsin expression has been a focus for understanding mechanisms of cell-specific gene expression in the retina (5Kumar R. Zack D.J. Wiggs J.L. Molecular Genetics of Ocular Diseases. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1995: 139-160Google Scholar). Transcription initiation has been identified as the major control point for rhodopsin gene expression (6Treisman J.E. Morabito M.A. Barnstable C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1570-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 7DesJardin L.E. Timmers A.M. Hauswirth W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6953-6960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A variety of studies using different approaches have demonstrated that important transcriptional control sequences lie within the 5′ upstream regions of various rhodopsin genes. Functional assays using transgenic mice have shown that 2–4 kb1 of upstream sequences from the mouse and bovine rhodopsin genes direct reporter gene expression to the photoreceptor layer (8Lem J. Applebury M.L. Falk J.D. Flannery J.G. Simon M.I. Neuron. 1991; 6: 201-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 9Zack D.J. Bennett J. Wang Y. Davenport C. Klaunberg B. Gearhart J. Nathans J. Neuron. 1991; 6: 187-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), with sequences proximal to the initiation site (−500 and −222) being sufficient for retina-specific expression. The importance of the proximal sequences is highlighted by the high degree of homology found in this region among vertebrate rhodopsins (10Batni S. Scalzetti L. Moody S.A. Knox B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3179-3186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, the immediate upstream sequences from the mammalian opsins were not able to limit expression of the reporter to rods as expected for rhodopsin (11Gouras P. Kjeldbye H. Zack D.J. Visual Neurosci. 1994; 11: 1227-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 12Woodford B.J. Chen J. Simon M.I. Exp. Eye Res. 1994; 58: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Expression levels are also regulated by a sequence termed rhodopsin enhancer region, located ∼2 kb upstream of the initiation site (13Nie Z. Chen S. Kumar R. Zack D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2667-2675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The binding of retina-specific nuclear factors to rhodopsin upstream sequences have been localized in both proximal and distal upstream regions, suggesting a role for these elements in regulating expression (5Kumar R. Zack D.J. Wiggs J.L. Molecular Genetics of Ocular Diseases. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1995: 139-160Google Scholar). However, a complete description of the cis-acting elements that control transcription in rod photoreceptors is not yet available. Transcription factors that potentially regulate gene expression have been identified in the mammalian retina and several have been shown to activate rhodopsin expression in heterologous systems, e.g. Nrl (14Swaroop A.

Commun. 1998; 250: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which the differentcis-acting elements in the rhodopsin upstream regions function, either independently or in concert, to produce rod-specific expression are not known. We have used Xenopus embryos for transient transfection studies and transgenesis to investigate rod-specific transcription. Previously, we found that a 5.5-kb rhodopsin upstream fragment was transcriptionally active, driving the expression of reporter both inXenopus embryo transfections (10Batni S. Scalzetti L. Moody S.A. Knox B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3179-3186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and in transgenic frogs (18Knox B.E. Schlueter C. Sanger B.M. Green C.B. Besharse J.C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In this paper, we map the rhodopsin promoter to an upstream region spanning nucleotides −508 to +41, capable of directing reporter expression to the abundant rod cells as detected by immunolocalization and GFP expression in transgenic Xenopus rod cells. Furthermore, we have used mutational analysis and DNase footprinting to define the functional limits of the promoter to the proximal ∼233 nucleotides and found multiple regulatory regions that contribute to the transcriptional activity in rod photoreceptors. The plasmids pXOP(−5500/+41)luc and pXOP(+41/−5500)luc contain the 5.5-kb upstream sequences from theXenopus rhodopsin gene, XOP, in the forward and reverse directions, respectively, in pGL2 vector (Promega, WI) and were constructed as described previously (10Batni S. Scalzetti L. Moody S.A. Knox B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3179-3186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). pXOP(−1300/+41)luc was derived from pXOP(−5500/+41)luc by SacI digestion and religation of the 6.9-kb vector-containing fragment. pXOP(−503/+41)luc was derived from pXOP(−1300/+41)luc by digestion with PstI and KpnI. The resulting ends were filled-in using Klenow DNA polymerase and religated. pXOP(−503/+41)luc (5800) was generated by cloning a 5.8-kb BamHI genomic fragment containing theXenopus rhodopsin exons and downstream sequences, into theBamHI site downstream of the luciferase gene in pXOP(−503/+41)luc. The deletion series was constructed using exonuclease III and mung bean nuclease digestion (Stratagene). The plasmid containing a deletion of the TATA box region, pXOP(−503/−46)luc, was constructed by digestion of pXOP(−503/+41) with HindIII and subsequent religation. The TATA box region was isolated as a HindIII fragment from pXOP(−503/+41)luc and cloned into pGL2 in both orientations, pXOP(−46/+41)luc and pXOP(+41/−46)luc, as well as a dimer, pXOP(−46/+41)2luc. All deletion constructs were sequenced using the dideoxy chain termination method to confirm the sequence and orientation of inserts. For transgenic experiments, pXOP(−508/+41)GFP was generated by subcloning aPstI-BamHI fragment into pEGFP− (18Knox B.E. Schlueter C. Sanger B.M. Green C.B. Besharse J.C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Targeted disruptions of conserved regions in the Xenopus rhodopsin promoter (−503/+41) were generated using a PCR-based approach using primers (Table I) with aPstI overhang (19Tomic-Canic M. Sunjevaric I. Blumenberg M. Meth. Mol. Biol. 1996; 57: 259-267PubMed Google Scholar). To generate the Δ(−84/−58), the PCR primer (Table I) contained aHindIII overhang, permitting direct cloning of the product into pXOP(−52/+41)luc. A second construct that disrupted −84 to −58 but maintained the spacing of the native promoter was made by cloning a synthetic oligonucleotide (5′-CTTGTACGGAGCTCTACTGTGCA-3′) into thePstI site in the Δ(−84/−58) construct. PCR was performed using Ultma DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The 5′ products were digested with KpnI-PstI, the 3′ products were digested with PstI-BamHI, and constructs were generated by three-part ligation ofKpnI-PstI product with thePstI-BamHI product. These were cloned directionally into the KpnI-BglII sites of pGL2 (Promega, WI). All mutant promoter constructs were verified by sequencing. The Δ(−136/−122) contained a single base change (G to C at −386) in addition to the intended replacement of the Ret-1 site byPstI.Table IList of primer sequences used in generating targeted deletion and artificial constructsConstructSense primer (5′–3′)Antisense primer (5′–3′)Δ (−233/−203)AACTGCAGACACTTTCTTCTTGTGTGTTTAACTGCAGGACCTACAGGAGATAATTCCATΔ (−170/−146)AACTGCAGGTTTAAGGGAAGCCAATTAACACTAACTGCAGCTCTCTCTGTTAAACACACAAGΔ (−136/−122)AACTGCAGTTGCAATTTTAGCTTGGATTACAACTGCAGCCCTTAAACGTATTAAGTCTACACΔ (−120/−109)AACTGCAGTTGGATTACAGTGATTAATAGTGAACTGCAGAAGTGTTAATTGGCTTCCCTΔ (−107/−91)AACTGCAGTAGTGCGCTAAATCCTTTGAACTGCAGAGCTAAAATTGCAAAGTGTTAATTGGΔ (−98/−91)AACTGCAGTAGTGCGCTAAATCCTTTGAACTGCAGTGTAATCCAAGCTAAAATTGCΔ (−84/−58)—aNo sense primer was necessary for this construct (see “Experimental Procedures”).CCCAAGCTTGCAACCTGCAGCACTATTAATCACTGTAΔ (−52/−38)AACTGCAGTGGGACTTTAAAAGGACGAACTGCAGCAACCCCCAGCGTCACGA−96/+41CACTAGGATTAATAGTGCGCTAAATCCTTTGTTC GTGACGCTGGGGGTTGCAAGCTTGCAACCCCCAGCGTCACGAACAAAGG ATTTAGCGCACATATTAATCCTAGTGGTACThe gene-specific forward primers were used in PCR reaction with GL2 3′ primer (5′-CGGGATCCAAGCTT-ACCAACAGTACCGGAATGCC-3′).

Rhodopsin-targeted deletion luciferase constructs were digested withKpnI/HindIII and cloned into theKpnI-HindIII sites of pEGFP XOP basal to generate rhodopsin-targeted deletion constructs in EGFP. The Δ(−52/−38)KpnI-HindIII fragment was cloned directly into EGFP digested with the same enzymes. The clones were verified by restriction digestion and sequencing. Plasmid preparations were performed using the Qiagen protocol (Chatsworth, CA). Wild typeXenopus rhodopsin promoter luciferase construct (−503/+41) was digested with HindIII to liberate the basal region (−52/+41). The 93-bp basal region was replaced by synthetic oligonucleotides encoding Xenopus rhodopsin basal region (−52/−37) and Xenopus cardiac actin (CAR) basal region (−36/+36) or with the CMV promoter basal region (−36/+28) withHindIII linkers on either end. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing, and plasmid DNA preparations were performed using the Qiagen protocol. The cardiac actin promoter (−3270/+23; Ref. 20Mohun T.J. Taylor M.V. Garrett N. Gurdon J.B. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1153-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) was liberated as aKpnI-HindIII fragment and cloned directionally into KpnI-HindIII sites in pGL2 (Promega, WI). The clones were verified by restriction analysis and sequencing of junctions to confirm the orientations. Luciferase constructs containingXenopus cardiac actin TATA and +1 (pCARTATA) were generated by removing the XOP (−503/−52) region from XOP-CAR usingHindIII and SmaI. The ends were filled in using Klenow and religated. This construct contains XOP (−52/−37 and the cardiac actin basal region (−36/+36) driving the expression of luciferase. Artificial promoter was made by design of synthetic oligonucleotides (IDT, Coralville, IA). p(−96/+41)GFP contained wild type sequence of the rhodopsin proximal promoter from −96 to +41. Oligonucleotides were designed with overhanging KpnI and HindIII sites, ligated into the same sites in the XOP basal construct, and confirmed by sequencing.

Transfections were performed as described elsewhere (23Batni S. Mani S.S. Schlueter C. Ji M. Knox B.E. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 50-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In early experiments, Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used; in later experiments,N-[1-(2,3-dioleyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-triethylammonium methylsulfate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were used during these studies and the amount of DNA and the DNA:lipid ratio were 6–12 μg and 1:3, respectively. DNA used for transfections were either purified by twice banding in CsCl (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

Groupwise comparisons of mean activities (RLU/head) generated in individual transfection trials were performed using single-factor analysis of variance (α = 0.05 for planned comparisons; Ref. 25Sokal R.R.

The luciferase assay gave 50,000–100,000 relative light units/pg of purified luciferase (Sigma)/30 s using the single-channel luminometer (Berthold). Protein estimations were done using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin standards, and ranged from 10 to 20 μg/head. Luciferase activity is reported as the mean (including all trials, ngiven in figure legend) ± S.E. DNA was digested with XhoI to linearize the plasmid and purified after digestion (High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit,Roche Molecular Biochemicals), with final elution in water. TransgenicXenopus embryos were produced using restriction enzyme-mediated integration as described (23Batni S. Mani S.S. Schlueter C. Ji M. Knox B.E. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 50-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Normal embryos were selected and cultured in 0.1× MMR at 18–20 °C until approximately stage 41 (3–4 days), at which point non-mosaic green fluorescence above the weak background fluorescence from the yolk could be observed. Normal tadpoles were maintained in 0.1× MMR and used for analysis. GFP-positive transgenic tadpoles were fixed overnight in phosphate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde. Frozen sections (10–15 μm thickness) were photographed under bright field and fluorescent lighting conditions (18Knox B.E. Schlueter C. Sanger B.M. Green C.B. Besharse J.C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Photographic slides were scanned and figures produced using Photoshop (Adobe). The brightness and contrast of the images in sections from the various Δ construct transgenic tadpoles were adjusted in order to visualize the cell type expressing the GFP reporter. At least three or four independent transgenic lines for each construct were sectioned and analyzed. The pattern and intensity of GFP expression between the various lines for any one construct was consistent. Nuclear proteins were extracted from adult Xenopusretinae as described (26Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). Glutathione S-transferase-tagged bovine Crx homeodomain and flanking regions (residues 37–107, GST-CrxHD) and a hexahistidine-tagged mouseNrl (residues 16–237, His-Nrl) were overexpressed and purified from Escherichia coli as described previously (16Chen S.

Varying concentrations of purified transcription factors (as indicated in Fig.2 legend) were used in the footprinting reactions. 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) was included only in the reactions containing retinal extracts. Vertebrate rhodopsin 5′-flanking regions possess significant interspecies homology, with many short stretches of sequence identity in the 250-bp region immediately upstream of the TATA box/initiation site (Fig.1). The overall sequence identity in this region ranged from 45% to 55% over a 200-bp stretch of sequence between Xenopus rhodopsin and other vertebrate rhodopsin sequences, suggesting a potential role for these conserved sequences in rhodopsin gene regulation. Several of the conserved regions inXOP are similar to binding sites for transcription factors in mammalian promoters: Ret4-like (−53/−38), which is a binding site for Crx (16Chen S. Wang Q.L. Nie Z.

Such high proximal promoter sequence homology highlights a potential conservation of the mechanism regulating rhodopsin gene expression in vertebrate photoreceptors. In order to locate binding sites for potential transcription factors, DNase footprinting was performed on the rhodopsin proximal promoter. Using an adult Xenopusretinal extract, numerous extended regions were protected from digestion, including those predicted from sequence comparisons in the proximal promoter (Fig. 2A). At present, no Xenopus homologues of Crx, Nrl, or other rod-specific transcription factors have been identified. Therefore, footprinting of the proximal promoter was done using recombinant mammalian proteins purified from E. coli: the bovine Crx homeodomain (GST-CrxHD; Ref. 16Chen S. Wang Q.L. Nie Z. Sun H. Lennon G. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Zack D.J. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1017-1030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) and the DNA binding domain and surrounding bZIP regions of murine Nrl containing a hexahistidine tag (His-Nrl; Ref. 27Kerppola T.K. Curran T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 675-684PubMed Google Scholar). Both proteins protected the rhodopsin proximal region (Fig. 2, B and C). GST-CrxHD produced an extended footprint encompassing the Crx consensus sites from −153/−73 on the sense strand and −70/−156 on the antisense strand, respectively. Nrl protected a number of regions (−81/−56 on the sense strand and −57/−84 on the antisense strand) that included an AP1 consensus region and NRE, adjacent to two Crx sites. These results strongly suggest that the sequences in the Xenopus rhodopsin proximal promoter contain binding sites for members of the Otx2-related and neural retinal leucine zipper families. A comparison of promoter activity was performed using an improved transfection protocol (23Batni S. Mani S.S. Schlueter C. Ji M. Knox B.E. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 50-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which allows direct comparison between the mean activities observed for different DNA constructs, without normalization with a second reporter plasmid. Initial experiments were performed using three upstream fragments: (−5500/+41, −1300/+41, and −508/+41), which were all capable of driving tissue-specific expression in embryos (TableII). Comparative transfections performed at equimolar concentrations showed that the activity from the −5500/+41 fragment was ∼35% lower compared with the other two promoters, which did not differ, although this difference was not significant at p < 0.05. Size of the plasmid used in the transfection appeared to have little influence on reporter gene expression, as two derivatives containing additional sequences produced similar results (Table II). One of the derivatives contained theXenopus rhodopsin gene and 3′ sequences, suggesting no significant transcriptional control regions downstream of the initiation region. Unlike that observed in heads, reporter expression from the upstream sequences in trunks was <2-fold over that obtained using GL2, which produced a relatively consistent but very low level of activity compared with heads transfected without DNA. We conclude that the major regulatory elements are located in the 508-bp proximal region.Table IIComparison of luciferase activity in embryos transfected with upstream regionsConditionDNAActivityaActivity measured as RLU/head is presented as: mean ± S.E. and data analyzed using analysis of variance (single-factor; α = 0.05) yielded p < 0.13 (*) and p < 0.11 (**) relative to −5500/+41.TransfectionsConstruct−5500/+4128,035 ± 4,530n = 13−1300/+4141,216 ± 7,727n = 10*−508/+4144,725 ± 9,473n = 12**Controls−DNA187 ± 19n = 13DNA only227 ± 43n = 3GL2479 ± 121n = 26TrunksbMean ± S.E.

To identify the domain of DnaC that interacts with DnaB, a genetic selection was used based on the lethal effect of induced dnaC expression and a model that inviability arises by the binding of DnaC to DnaB to inhibit replication fork movement. The analysis of dnaC alleles that preserved viability under elevated expression revealed an N-terminal domain of DnaC involved in binding to DnaB. Mutant proteins bearing single amino acid substitutions (R10P, L11Q, L29Q, S41P, W32G, and L44P) that reside in regions of predicted secondary structure were inert in DNA replication activity because of their inability to bind to DnaB, but they retained ATP binding activity, as indicated by UV cross-linking to [α-32P]ATP. These alleles also failed to complement a dnaC28 mutant. Other selected mutations that map to regions carrying Walker A and B boxes are expected to be defective in ATP binding, a required step in DnaB-DnaC complex formation. Lastly, we found that the sixth codon from the N terminus encodes aspartate, resolving a reported discrepancy between the predicted amino acid sequence based on DNA sequencing data and the results from N-terminal amino acid sequencing (Nakayama, N., Bond, M.

J. Bacteriol. 1975; 121: 594-599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This replication protein is also required for the propagation of many phage and plasmid DNAs. Indeed, DnaC protein was first isolated based on its requirement for in vitro φX174 DNA replication and shown to be required for assembly of the primosome, a multiprotein complex that forms at a specific site on the single-stranded DNA-binding protein-coated φX174 single-stranded DNA to form RNA primers at multiple sites on the viral DNA (recently reviewed in Ref. 5Sandler S.J. Marians K.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In the primosome assembly process, DnaC binds to DnaB helicase to form a complex that is thought to be stabilized by the binding of ATP to DnaC (6Wahle E. Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2463-2468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Once DnaB has become assembled into the primosome, hydrolysis of the ATP bound to DnaC is thought to result in its release from DnaB (7Funnell B.E. Baker T.A. Kornberg A. J. Biol.

In the initiation process at the E. coli replication origin,oriC, the initial events involve the ordered binding of the replication initiator, DnaA protein, to the four (or perhaps five) DnaA boxes (reviewed in Refs. 10Messer, W., and Weigel, C. (1996) in Escherichia coli and S. typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology (Neidhardt, F. C., Ingraham, J. L., Low, K. B., Magasanik, B., Schaechter, M., and Umbarger, H.

Helix opening of an AT-rich region near the left oriC border then occurs (12Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1988; 52: 743-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) to form a nucleoprotein complex that serves as a structure needed for the assembly of intermediate complexes at each subsequent stage of the initiation process (9Sutton M.D. Carr K.M. Vicente M. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34255-34262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). DnaC in the DnaB-DnaC complex is then proposed to ferry DnaB to the DnaA-oriC complex, and the oriented binding of DnaB is assisted by a physical interaction between the replicative helicase and DnaA protein (13Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The site of entry of DnaB at oriC appears to be at the unwound region, based on the ability of DnaB to bind to naked single-stranded DNA (14Arai K. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4308-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 15Fang L. Davey M.J. O'Donnell M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 541-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, this property of DnaB is insufficient because DnaC is absolutely needed to escort DnaB to oriC (16Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. Cell. 1984; 38: 183-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The mechanism involving the transfer of DnaB to this DNA site is poorly understood. For DnaB to function at oriC or in φX174 DNA replication and other physiologically relevant replication systems, it must first be in a complex with DnaC (17Wickner S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 921-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 18Lanka E. Schuster H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 987-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 19Kobori J.A. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13770-13775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Formation of the DnaB-DnaC complex is stabilized by ATP that is apparently bound by DnaC (6Wahle E. Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2463-2468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with a stoichiometry of one DnaC monomer per DnaB protomer (17Wickner S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 921-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 18Lanka E. Schuster H.

After the stable binding of DnaB to DNA, the release of DnaC is thought to be induced by the hydrolysis of the bound ATP (6Wahle E. Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2463-2468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wahle E. Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2469-2475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is a necessary step to unmask the helicase activity of DnaB; when DnaC is bound to the helicase, its unwinding activity is undetectable (6Wahle E. Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2463-2468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because DnaB must be in the DnaB-DnaC complex for it to enter atoriC, DnaC has been assigned a delivery role. It is unclear what this delivery function is. The biochemical activities essential for DnaC function are also not well understood. To learn more about how this indispensable protein acts in DNA replication, we embarked on a genetic approach to obtain novel dnaC alleles in order to study the mutant proteins at the biochemical level. As a beginning, we developed a selection method to obtain novel dnaC mutants that are defective in binding to DnaB. This report describes their isolation and the identification of an N-terminal domain within DnaC that interacts with DnaB protein. Also, mutations in or near the Walker A and B boxes that presumably function in ATP binding were obtained. We expect that mutant proteins in this latter category are inactive in DNA replication because of their inability to bind to ATP, and cannot form a complex with DnaB as a consequence. In other experiments, mutant proteins carrying single amino acid substitutions near the N terminus of DnaC were purified and shown to be inactive in DNA replication because of their failure to bind to DnaB. In contrast, the mutant proteins retained the ability to bind ATP based on ATP cross-linking experiments. These results identify a functional domain of DnaC that is specifically required for binding to DnaB and identify specific amino acid residues important for this interaction. E. coli MC1061 (genotype,araD139 Δ(ara-leu)7696 ΔlacX74 galU galK hsdR2 (rK– mK+)mcrB1 rpsL (F-) and plasmid-bearing derivatives were routinely grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium supplemented, as indicated, with ampicillin (50 µg/ml) or kanamycin (40 µg/ml).E. coli CT28–3b (thr-1 ara-14 leuB6Δ(gpt-proA)62 lacY1 tsx-33 glnV44(AS)galK2 λ– thyA705 rpsL31(strR)xylA5 mtl-1 argE3(Oc) thi-1 dnaC28) was obtained from the E. coli Genetic Stock Center. The expression plasmid pdnaC113 was constructed by insertion of a 997-base pair BamHI fragment carrying the dnaC gene and its natural ribosome binding site into the BamHI site of pING1 to place the dnaC gene under araB promoter control. 1D. Siemieniak and J. M. Kaguni, unpublished results. Expression from thearaB promoter is regulated by araC, which is also plasmid-encoded. The second expression plasmid (pINCssd) (20Allen G.J. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22096-22101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. Elliott Crooke at Georgetown University. This plasmid places the translation initiation sequences of bacteriophage T7 gene 10 upstream of the dnaC coding region inserted at theSmaI site of pINGK (20Allen G.J. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22096-22101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a derivative constructed by insertion of the kanamycin resistance gene in a 1.2-kilobase pairPstI fragment into the PstI site of pING1 (21Johnston S. Lee J.H. Ray D.S. Gene. 1985; 34: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Transformants of MC1061 carrying the mutagenized dnaC gene in the plasmid vector were selected for on LB plates containing kanamycin (50 µg/ml) and arabinose (0.5% w/v) (see Table I). Growth was at 37 °C. Colonies were then replica-plated onto LB plates with kanamycin at the above concentration, and isolates that grew up overnight were transferred to nitrocellulose filters by replica plating. To induce dnaCexpression, the filters were placed on LB plates supplemented with kanamycin and 0.5% arabinose and incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C. The bacteria adhering to the filters were then lysed in chloroform vapor essentially as described (22Marszalek J. Zhang W. Hupp T.R. Margulies C. Carr K.M. Cherry S. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18535-18542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). After placing the filters on Whatman 3-mm paper saturated with 6 m urea followed by a blocking step, DnaC protein was detected with affinity-purified rabbit anti-DnaC antibody shown to be specific for DnaC (data not shown) and then with goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (22Marszalek J.

Luminol provided the chemiluminescent signal to identify those transformants that expressed DnaC at a level comparable to the nonmutagenized dnaC plasmid in MC1061. These were colony-purified and subjected to a second immunoblot analysis performed as stated above to confirm the results. Plasmid DNA was then isolated from these mutants and reintroduced into MC1061. Those transformants that grew with equal efficiency on LB medium with or without arabinose were then analyzed by Western blotting of whole cell lysates to identify those encoding full-length DnaC protein (see accompanying study). Plasmid-bearing transformants that expressed DnaC at a lesser level or produced a truncated form were discarded. The remaining plasmids were purified (Qiagen midiprep) and sequenced by the dye-terminator method using DNA sequencing facilities at Michigan State University or Cornell University. Sequence data was analyzed with Sequencher software.Table IElevated expression of dnaC is lethalStrain and plasmidEfficiency of platingMC10610.84MC1061 (pING1)0.94MC1061 (pdnaC113)8.3 × 10−4MC1061 (pINCssd)2.2 × 10−8E. coli MC1061 harboring the indicated plasmids was spread at various dilutions on LB medium with or without 0.5% arabinose, and the appropriate antibiotic to select for plasmid-bearing cells.

Open table in a new tab E. coli MC1061 harboring the indicated plasmids was spread at various dilutions on LB medium with or without 0.5% arabinose, and the appropriate antibiotic to select for plasmid-bearing cells. Overnight growth was at 37 °C. Plating efficiency is the ratio of colony formation on medium supplemented with arabinose to that without arabinose. Two mutagenesis methods were used. The first relied on a strain carrying the mutD5 allele. This gene, under control of the trp promoter, encodes a defective epsilon subunit of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. When expressed, the mutant subunit confers a defect in the 3′-to-5′ exonuclease activity of the DNA polymerase to decrease its fidelity by ∼103-fold. Consequently, we passaged the dnaC plasmid pINCssd through the mutD5 strain to introduce mutations into dnaC. Plasmid DNA was then isolated and transformed into E. coli MC1061. As noted in Table II, this approach yielded one dnaC mutation. For all others, error-prone PCR2amplification of the dnaC gene was the second mutagenesis method. Taq DNA polymerase was used essentially following the manufacturer's conditions but with 5 mmMn2+ instead of Mg2+ and a nucleotide bias for cytosine and thymidine under reaction conditions described in Table IIthat yield a misincorporation rate of 0.66–2%. Alternatively, error-prone PCR was performed as above but with 1 mmMn2+ and without the nucleotide bias. After PCR mutagenesis, the amplified fragment was digested with EcoRI and SalI, ligated to the corresponding ends of the vector to place the mutagenized dnaC gene as in pINCssd, and then transformed into strain MC1061.Table IIMissense mutations and amino acid substitutions of novel dnaC allelesPlasmidNucleotide substitution2-aNucleotide substitutions indicate the natural base, its position in the coding region relative to the start of the dnaC gene, and the substituting nucleotide.Amino acid substitutionpdnaC116T131C/C378T (silent)L44PpdnaC193G21A (silent)/G29C/T285C (silent)R10PpdnaC203T94GW32GpdnaC212T94AW32RpdnaC246T121C/T579C (silent)S41PpdnaC250T32AL11QpdnaC322T86A/G501A (silent)/G522A (silent)L29QpdnaC351A341G/G420A (silent)H114RpdnaC374C127G/T249C (silent)A43PpdnaC383T68C/G240C (silent)F23SpdnaC482A341GH114GpdnaC527T89C/C555T (silent)/T567C (silent)L30PpdnaC5462-bThese alleles encode proteins that accumulate in inclusion bodies when expression is induced.

Open table in a new tab To confirm that elevated expression of DnaC is the cause of lethality, whole cell lysates of the plasmid-containing strains (TableI) and known amounts of purified DnaC protein were detected by immunoblot analysis essentially as described above. Strains carrying either dnaC expression plasmid were grown in LB medium at 37 °C with the appropriate antibiotic to anA 595 nm of 0.6, and then expression was induced by addition of arabinose to 0.5% (w/v). After an additional 1.5 h of growth, the turbidity of each culture was nearly identical (1.56 A 595 nm for MC1061(pINCssd), and 1.46 A 595 nmfor MC1061(pdnaC113). To determine the relative level of expression, increasing volumes of whole cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting in comparison to known amounts of purified DnaC protein, and the image from chemiluminescence recorded on Eastman Kodak Co. X-Omat film was analyzed using Kodak's electrophoresis documentation and analysis system with Kodak 1D image analysis software (version 3.5). Fresh transformants of MC1061 carrying the individual mutant plasmids listed in Table II were grown in 25 ml of LB medium supplemented with 50 µg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C to an A 595 nmof about 0.6. A portion (1 ml) was removed at this point to serve as a negative control, and arabinose was added to the remainder of the cultures at a final concentration of 0.5% (w/v) to inducednaC expression. Cultures were incubated for an additional 1.5 h at 37 °C with shaking. Whole cell lysates were then prepared by resuspension of the cell pellet from 100 µl of culture before and after addition of arabinose in 200 µl of Laemmli sample buffer. With most of the remainder of the induced cultures (20 ml), soluble extracts were prepared by resuspension of cell pellets in 200 or 250 µl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 10% sucrose (w/v), and then ammonium sulfate to 5%(w/v), Na2-EDTA to 20 mm, spermidine-HCl to 20 mm, dithiothreitol to 5 mm, and lysozyme to 200 µg/ml were added. The mixtures were incubated on ice for 45 min before addition of Brij 58 to 0.1%. After centrifugation at 20,000 rpm in an SS-34 rotor at 4 °C, the supernatants were removed, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. The lysate supernatants (2 µl) and whole cell lysates (10 µl) were analyzed by Western blotting to identify mutant proteins that were expressed at a level comparable to wild type DnaC protein and were comparably soluble in the lysate supernatants. E. coli MC1061 (genotype, araD139 Δ(ara-leu)7696Δ lacX74 galU galK hsdR2 (rK–mK+) mcrB1 rpsL (F–)) harboring the respective plasmid-borne alleles was grown in LB medium (6 liters) containing 50 µg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C to an A 595 nm of about 0.6. Arabinose was added to 0.5% (w/v), and the culture was incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C to allow for protein expression. Cell pellets collected by centrifugation were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 10% sucrose (w/v) to a finalA 595 nm of about 250. Soluble extracts were prepared by proportionally scaling up the procedure described above. Protein purification was as described (23Hwang D.S. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10633-10640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and involved chromatography of the ammonium sulfate precipitate on DEAE cellulose. DnaC protein in the flow-through was chromatographed over blue dextran-Sepharose. On elution with buffer containing a linear gradient from 0.05 to 2m KCl, DnaC (mutant as well as wild type) eluted at a conductivity equivalent to buffer containing 1 m KCl. DnaC116 (L44P) and DnaC250 (L11Q) required an additional purification step to remove contaminating proteins. The blue dextran-Sepharose fraction for these mutants was chromatographed over a HE2/M Heparin column on a BioCad Sprint system (Perseptive Biosystems). Due to the elevated expression of DnaC, purification was monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein concentration was determined by the dye binding method with BSA as a standard (24Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213637) Google Scholar).

Investigations into the downstream targets involved have identified the MAPK cascade as a target. Expression of Δp85 and incubation with LY294002 both inhibited IL-3-induced activation of Mek, Erk1, and Erk2. This was most pronounced during the initial phase of Erk activation. The Mek inhibitor, PD98059, blocked IL-3-driven proliferation, an effect enhanced by Δp85 expression, suggesting that inhibition of Mek and Erks by Δp85 contributes to the decrease in IL-3-induced proliferation in these cells but that additional pathways may also be involved. To investigate the mechanism leading to decreased activation of Erks, we investigated effects on SHP2 and Gab2, both implicated in IL-3 regulation of Erk activation. Expression of Δp85 led to a reduction in SHP2 tyrosine phosphorylation and its ability to interact with Grb2 and Gab2 but increased overall tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab2. LY294002 did not perturb SHP2 interactions, potentially related to differences in the effects of these inhibitors on levels of phosphoinositides. These results imply that the regulation of Erks by class IA phosphoinositide 3-kinase may contribute to IL-3-driven proliferation and that both SHP2 and Gab2 are possibly involved in this regulation.

Recent challenges have been to determine the functional requirement of these pathways in IL-3 action. Phosphoinositide 3-kinases are a family of lipid kinases, whose products, phosphoinositide 3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2) and phosphoinositide 3,4,5-triphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3), are important intracellular second messengers (8Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). IL-3 activates members of the class IA family of PI3Ks, which consist of a regulatory subunit (p85) and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit (8Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Three forms of p110 (α, β, and δ) have been identified, with the p110δ isoform being largely restricted in its expression to cells of the immune system (7Vanhaesebroeck B. Welham M.J. Kotani K. Stein R. Warne P.H. Zvelebil M.J. Higashi K. Volinia S. Downward J. Waterfield M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4330-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 9Chantry D.

PI3Ks have been implicated in regulating a broad range of physiological processes, including the control of proliferation, cell survival, vesicle trafficking, and glucose transport. We reported previously that expression of dominant negative p85 (Δp85), which specifically targets class IA PI3Ks, results in a dramatic reduction in IL-3-induced proliferation (10Craddock B.L.

However, we observed only minimal effects on apoptosis, and we proposed that class IA PI3Ks play a major role regulating IL-3-dependent proliferation rather than cell survival (10Craddock B.L.

One of the major pathways that has been widely implicated in the regulation of proliferation is the Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK module (18Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4208) Google Scholar). This protein kinase cascade is activated by a wide variety of agents, including IL-3 (4Duronio V. Welham M.J.

Immunol. 1992; 149: 1683-1693PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of this pathway in fibroblasts culminates in translocation of activated Erk1 and -2 to the nucleus, where they phosphorylate members of the Ets family of transcription factors, including Elk-1 and components of the AP1 complex (19English J. Pearson G. Wilsbacher J. Swantek J. Karandikar M. Xu S. Cobb M.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). This leads to transcriptional activation of genes important for cell cycle progression, DNA synthesis, and cell division. Recent evidence has shown that G1 cyclins, including cyclin D1, are transcriptionally regulated by MAPK-dependent pathways (20Greulich H. Erikson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13280-13288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar,21Treinies I. Paterson H.F. Hooper S. Wilson R. Marshall C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), providing a direct link between Erks and cell cycle regulation. PI3Ks have been implicated in the regulation of the MAPK cascade. Inhibitors of PI3K (the fungal metabolite wortmannin or the LY294002 compound) lead to inhibition of agonist-stimulated Erk1 and -2 activation (22Conway A.-M. Rakhit S. Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochem.

However, it has also been reported that PI3K inhibition does not influence Erk activity (28Scheid M.P. Duronio V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18134-18139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 29Ferby I.M. Waga I. Hoshino M. Kuma K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11684-11688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This issue has been more closely addressed, and it appears that there may be cell- and receptor-specific requirements for the effects observed. For example, Erk activation by EGF in COS7 cells can be inhibited by PI3K inhibitors at low doses of EGF but not at maximal doses (30Wennstrom S. Downward J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4279-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Similarly, both platelet-derived growth factor- and insulin-induced activation of Erk1 and -2 can be inhibited by PI3K inhibitors in cells expressing low levels of their respective receptors but not in cells overexpressing these receptors (31Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27665-27670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Therefore, the involvement of PI3Ks in the regulation of Erks may depend on the dose of agonist received, with lower levels of receptor and agonist more closely paralleling the situation in vivo. Our demonstration that expression of dominant negative p85 inhibits IL-3-driven proliferation of BaF/3 cells, without significantly affecting apoptosis, led us to investigate in greater detail the downstream targets of PI3K that may contribute to this decrease in proliferation. Here, we demonstrate that expression of Δp85, or treatment with the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, led to consistent decreases in the ability of IL-3 to induce Mek, Erk1, and Erk2 activation. The Mek activation inhibitor, PD98059, blocked IL-3-induced proliferation, and this effect was enhanced in combination with Δp85 expression. The alterations in Mek and Erk activation in Δp85-expressing cells were coupled with alterations in tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP2 and its association with both Grb2 and the scaffolding protein Gab2. However, LY294002 did not lead to altered SHP2 interactions, which could be related to differences in the effect of Δp85 expression versus LY294002 on in vivolevels of phosphoinositides. We propose that PI3K activity is involved in the initial phase of activation of Erks by IL-3 and that the decrease in Erk activation observed upon Δp85 expression may contribute to the decrease in IL-3-induced proliferation we observe. Murine IL-3-dependent BaF/3 cells and derivatives expressing the tetracycline transactivator from the plasmid pUHD15-1, containing a puromycin-selectable marker, were the kind gifts of DNAX, Palo Alto, CA (32Mui A.L.F. Wakao H. Kinoshita T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2425-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The generation, characterization, and growth of clones inducibly expressing Myc epitope-tagged Δp85 and control cells containing empty vector have been described previously (10Craddock B.L.

All cells were maintained at 37 °C, 5% (v/v) CO2 in a humidified incubator in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 20 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units of penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine (RPMI media), with the addition of 5% (v/v) conditioned media from WEHI3B cells as a source of murine IL-3. Δp85-expressing clones and empty vector controls were cultured in the presence of 2 μg/ml tetracycline. For sodium 3′-(1-[(phenylamino)-carbonyl]-3,4-tetrazolium]-bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro)benzenesulfonic acid hydrate (XTT) dye reduction assays, recombinant murine IL-3 (rmIL-3, R & D Systems) was set up in triplicate at a range of doses (0.5 pg/ml to 2 ng/ml), in serum-free AIM-V media (Life Technologies, Inc.) in the presence or absence of 2 μg/ml tetracycline and in flat-bottomed 96-well trays (Nunc). Transfectants were washed three times in HBSS, resuspended at 2 × 104 cells in AIM-V media, and plated at 1000 cells/well in 100 μl total volume. Cells were incubated for 72 h at 37 °C. 25 μl of a solution containing 1 mg/ml XTT and 25 μm phenazine methosulfate was added/well for the final 4 h of incubation. The soluble formazan product was measured at 450 nm on a Dynatech MR5000 plate reader. Transfectants were washed three times with Hanks' buffered saline solution, pH 7.5, and resuspended in IL-3-containing RPMI at 1 × 105cells/ml in the absence (to induce expression) or the presence of 2 μg/ml tetracycline (Tet, to suppress expression) and were incubated at 37 °C for 16–20 h. In some cases cells were incubated for a further 14 h in media containing 0.5%(v/v) WEHI3B conditioned media in the presence or absence of Tet. This IL-3 deprivation was used to increase IL-3 receptor cell surface expression. Treatment of all cells with IL-3 was carried out as described previously (33Welham M.J. Schrader J.W. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2772-2783PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, recombinant murine IL-3 was used at a concentration of 20 ng/ml, which we had determined previously to induce maximal levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular substrates. Cell pellets were lysed in solubilization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium molybdate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 40 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at concentrations between 1 and 2 × 107cells/ml. Nuclei and insoluble material were removed by centrifugation for 3 min at full speed in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C. Clarified supernatants were used for immunoprecipitations, which were performed as described previously (33Welham M.J. Schrader J.W. J.

The following antibodies were used: 5 μg of 9E10 (anti-Myc) monoclonal antibody; 2 μg of rabbit polyclonal antibody against SHP-2 (sc-280, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); 5 μg of rabbit polyclonal antibody against Gab2 (06-967, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc), 2 μg of rabbit polyclonal antibody against Grb2 (sc-255, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein containing the SH2 domain of Grb2 has been described previously (34Welham M.J. Duronio V. Leslie K.B. Bowtell D. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21165-21176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Precipitations were carried out using 10 μg of fusion protein per sample. Following stimulation, cell pellets were resuspended in 400 μl of ice-cold nuclear extract buffer 1 (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium molybdate, 10 mmsodium fluoride, 40 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin) and left on ice for 15 min. 15 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added to each sample. The samples were vortexed briefly and then the nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at full speed in a Hereaus Biofuge at 4 °C. The supernatant was retained as the cytosolic extract. Nuclear pellets were rinsed briefly in nuclear extract buffer 1 and then resuspended in 30–50 μl of nuclear extract buffer 2 (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium molybdate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 40 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin) for examination of nuclear proteins alone, or 400 μl when relative distribution experiments were performed, and rotated at 4 °C for 30 min. Debris was removed by centrifugation for 5 min as described previously. Clarified supernatants were retained and used for immunoblotting. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting were carried out as described previously (34Welham M.J. Duronio V. Leslie K.B. Bowtell D. Schrader J.W. J. Biol.

Primary antibodies were used at the following concentrations: 0.1 μg/ml anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 (05-321, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.); 1:1000 for polyclonal antibodies against phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of Erk1 and Erk2 (9101, New England Biolabs), phosphorylated Mek and Mek (9120, New England Biolabs), and phosphoserine 473 Akt/PKB (New England Biolabs); 0.5 μg/ml for anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10, 0.2 μg/ml polyclonal antibodies against SHP-2 (sc-280 Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and Erk1 (sc-93 Santa Cruz Biotechnology); 1:2000 for anti-Gab2 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.); 1:4000 for anti-Aic2A antibody (sc-677 Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and 1:2000 for anti-Grb2 antibody (sc-255 Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In vivolipid labeling and measurement of levels of deacylated lipids were performed essentially as described (35Ward S.G. Proudfoot A.E.I. Wells T.N.C. Pawer C.A. Methods in Molecular Biology.in: Humana Press Inc, Totowa, NJ2000Google Scholar). Cells were washed and preincubated for 30 min in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% (v/v) dialyzed fetal bovine serum and then incubated for 3 h at 2 × 107/ml in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5 mCi/ml 32Pi. After extensive washing 107 cells were either left untreated as controls or stimulated for 1 min with 20 ng/ml rmIL-3. Reactions were terminated by addition of 500 μl (chloroform/methanol/water; 32.6:65.3:2.1 v/v) and vortexing. Phases were separated first by addition of 200 μl of chloroform containing 10 μg/ml Folsch lipids and 200 μl of 2.4m HCl, 5 mm tetrabutylammonium sulfate, and centrifugation. A second separation was carried out with 400 μl of 1m HCl, 5 mm EDTA. Dried lipids were deacylated at 53 °C for 40 min in 25% (w/v) methylamine/methanol/butanol-1 (4:4:1) and re-dried. Water-soluble lipids were washed twice with butanol-1/petroleum ether (b.p. 40–60 °C)/ethyl formate (20:4:1 v/v), re-dried, and deacylated 32P-labeled lipids analyzed by HPLC using a 12.5-cm Whatman Partisphere SAX column. Samples were eluted using a gradient of buffers A (water) and B (1.25 m(NH4)2HPO4 adjusted to pH 3.8 with phosphoric acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min: 0 min, 0% B; 5 min, 0% B; 45 min, 12% B; 60 min, 30% B; 61 min, 100% B; 66 min, 0% B; 90 min, 0% A and B. Counts were analyzed using an on-line radiodetector. Elution of lipids was calibrated using CD28-activated Jurkat cells (35Ward S.G. Proudfoot A.E.I. Wells T.N.C. Pawer C.A.

When effects of Δp85 expression on D3 phosphoinositide levels were examined, cells were incubated for 18 h ±Tet prior to labeling. When the effects of LY294002 were examined, cells were labeled, separated, and half-incubated for 30 min with 30 μm LY294002, or Me2SO alone, prior to IL-3 stimulations. Our previous demonstration (10Craddock B.L. Orchiston E.A. Hinton H.J. Welham M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10633-10640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) that class IAPI3Ks play a major role in controlling IL-3-driven proliferation prompted us to investigate the downstream targets of PI3Ks involved in this response. The extracellular regulated/mitogen-activated protein kinases (Erk1 and -2) have been linked to regulation of cellular proliferation in many systems (18Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4208) Google Scholar), and a number of reports support a role for PI3Ks in regulating the activation of Erks (22Conway A.-M. Rakhit S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 18528-18537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether expression of Δp85 influenced activation of the MAPKs, Erk1 and Erk2, by IL-3. To address the involvement of PI3Ks in regulation of Erk by IL-3 we used IL-3-dependent BaF/3 transfectants that express dominant negative p85 (Δp85) in a tetracycline-regulated manner (10Craddock B.L. Orchiston E.A. Hinton H.J. Welham M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10633-10640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Transfectants were induced to express Δp85 by removal of tetracycline or left uninduced in the presence of Tet. Cells were subsequently stimulated for different times with maximal doses of IL-3 (previously determined as 20 ng/ml), and the activity of Erk1 and -2 was assessed by immunoblotting extracts with antibodies that detect the dual phosphorylated (activated) forms of both Erk1 and Erk2. The results in Fig. 1 A clearly demonstrate that expression of Δp85 reduces the activation of Erk1 and Erk2 following IL-3 simulation. Interestingly, the effect is most pronounced at early time points (Fig. 1 A,α-pErk, compare lanes 3 and9, left panel) with little to no effect at later time points (Fig. 1 A, compare lanes 5 and11, left panel). These results suggest either that (i) PI3K is required during the early phase of Erk activation by IL-3 or (ii) at early time points maximal occupancy of IL-3 receptors has not been achieved, and the reduced activation of Erks is due to the ability of Δp85 expression to affect IL-3 signaling at suboptimal levels of receptor engagement. No effect of removing tetracycline on IL-3-induced Erk1 and -2 activation was observed in cells containing empty vector (see Fig. 1 A, right panel, CONTROL). These membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti-Erk (α-Erk) antibodies to assess loading of the gels (Fig. 1 B). The immediate upstream activators of Erks are the MAPK kinases, Mek1 and Mek2. To investigate whether inhibition of class IA PI3K by expression of Δp85 affects IL-3-induced activation of Mek, we utilized an antibody that specifically detects the phosphorylated and hence active form of Mek1 and -2. The same immunoblots as in Fig. 1, A and B, were stripped and reprobed with the anti-phospho-Mek antibody (α-pMek), with the results shown in Fig. 1 C. Expression of Δp85 clearly reduces the activation of Mek in response to IL-3. As with the effect on Erk1 and -2 activation, Mek phosphorylation is significantly reduced at early time points following IL-3 treatment. No effect on Mek activation was observed in control cells incubated in the presence or absence of Tet (Fig. 1 C, right panel, CONTROL). Fig. 1 D shows expression of Δp85 in this experiment. It has been demonstrated in some systems that the requirement for PI3K activity in activation of Erks is dependent on the dose of stimulating factor used and level of receptor expression (30Wennstrom S. Downward J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4279-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 31Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27665-27670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Given that we observed a decrease in Erk activation upon Δp85 expression at early time points following IL-3 treatment, we wanted to examine if this was related to the dose of cytokine used. IL-3 dose-response analyses were performed using a stimulation time of 5 min, and the effects of Δp85 expression on IL-3-induced Erk1, Erk2, and Mek activation were examined. Maximal activation of all three kinases was consistently observed at concentrations of IL-3 of 5 ng/ml and above (see Fig.2). Expression of Δp85 resulted in significant inhibition of Erk1, Erk2, and Mek activation at all concentrations of IL-3 tested (see Fig. 2, A andC). When time course analyses using 5 ng/ml IL-3 were performed (Fig. 3), maximal activation in the presence of Tet was observed after 10 min of IL-3 treatment, with significant inhibition of Mek, Erk1, and -2 activation observed when Δp85 was expressed at both early and later time points (2-, 10-, and 20-min treatment times; Fig. 3, A and C). At times of 30 min, little difference was observed in activation of Erk1 and Erk2, but Mek was still clearly inhibited, suggesting it is very sensitive to expression of Δp85. The same membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti-Erk (Figs. 2 B and 3 B) and/or anti-Mek antibodies (Fig. 3 D) for loading controls and p85 antibodies to monitor induction of p85 expression (Figs. 2 Dand 3 E). In Fig. 2 B mobility shifts are apparent for both Erk1 and Erk2 in the + Tet samples treated with IL-3, due to their phosphorylation (see Fig. 2 A). This complicates the assessment of loading, although in the untreated cells, the levels appear similar, as do the levels of endogenous p85 observed (see Fig. 2 D). Also, we consistently noted that the anti-Mek antibody appeared to recognize the phosphorylated forms of Mek better than the unphosphorylated forms. These results suggest that expression of Δp85 can inhibit IL-3-induced activation of Mek and Erks across a range of doses of IL-3, but at sub-optimal doses, the inhibition appears to be more sustained. We have attempted to investigate if expression of a constitutively active form of p110α (p110*, see Ref. 37Klippel A. Reinhard C. Kavanaugh W.M. Apell G. Escobedo M.A. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W2076234060,"A major unanswered question of glucocorticoid and progesterone action is how different whole cell responses arise when both of the cognate receptors can bind to, and activate, the same hormone response elements. We have documented previously that the EC50 of agonist complexes, and the partial agonist activity of antagonist complexes, of both glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) and progesterone receptors (PRs) are modulated by increased amounts of homologous receptor and of coregulators. We now ask whether these components can differentially alter GR and PR transcriptional properties. To remove possible cell-specific differences, we have examined both receptors in the common environment of a line of mouse mammary adenocarcinoma (1470.2) cells. In order to segregate the responses that might be due to unequal nucleosome reorganization by the two receptors from those reflecting interactions with other components, we chose a transiently transfected reporter containing a simple glucocorticoid response element (i.e. GREtkLUC). No significant differences are found with elevated levels of either receptor. However, major, qualitative differences are seen with the corepressors SMRT and NCoR, which afford opposite responses with GR and PR. Studies with chimeric GR/PR receptors indicate that no one segment of PR or GR is responsible for these properties and that the composite response likely involves interactions with both the amino and carboxyl termini of receptors. Collectively, the data suggest that GR and PR induction of responsive genes in a given cell can be differentially controlled, in part, by unequal interactions of multiple receptor domains with assorted nuclear cofactors.

Beato M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 459-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar) even though each receptor-steroid complex can bind to the same DNA sequences to induce gene transcription (2Roche P.J. Hoare S.A.

After binding to biologically active DNA sequences, called hormone response elements (HREs),1 the activated complexes are thought to recruit transcriptional coregulators and components of the transcriptional complex prior to modifying the transcription rates of target genes. Different ligands bind to the various steroid receptors with different affinities. However, this specificity for the different steroid hormones would seem to soon disappear as the activated form of each complex of the above four steroid receptors can bind to, and activate transcription from, the same HREs. The actions of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) and progesterone receptors (PRs) have been extensively studied in an effort to understand how biological diversity can be maintained when the activated receptor complexes act on a common HRE. Several explanations have been proposed, including different levels of the receptor within a given cell (4Strahle U. Boshart M. Klock G. Stewart F. Schutz G. Nature. 1989; 339: 629-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). HRE mutations have also been reported to affect differentially GR versus PR transactivation (5Ricousse S.L. Gouilleux F. Fortin D. Joulin V. Richard-Foy H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5072-5077Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), although the differences seem to be less pronounced when receptor concentrations are about equal (6Thackray V.G. Lieberman B.A. Nordeen S.K. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 66: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Nelson et al. (7Nelson C.C. Hendy S.C. Shukin R.J. Cheng H. Bruchovsky N. Koop B.F. Rennie P.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2090-2107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found that the flanking and spacer DNA of the palindromic HRE can contribute to the affinity and specificity of receptor binding. Similarly, DNA binding specificity has been implicated in the androgen receptor (AR)versus GR-specific induction of the probasin gene (8Schoenmakers E. Verrijdt G. Peeters B. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Claessens F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12290-12297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and in GR versus AR activation of the aspartate aminotransferase gene (9Massaad C. Garlatti M. Wilson E.M. Cadepond F. Barouki R. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 123-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, subtle differences in HRE sequence may regulate the relative activities of GR and PR. Chromatin architecture has recently emerged as another promising modifier for receptor-regulated expression of some, but not all (10Archer T.K. Lee H.-L. Cordingley M.G. Mymryk J.S. Fragoso G. Berard D. Hager G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 568-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), genes. Chromatin structure can repress gene expression (11Wu C. J. Biol.

Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6623) Google Scholar), thereby increasing the fold induction by receptor-steroid complexes, especially in cell-free systems (13Kraus W.L. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 14Liu Z. Wong J. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9485-9490Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Chromatin environment can control gene inducibility by PR (15Smith C.L. Archer T.K. Hamlin-Green G. Hager G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11202-11206Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 16Archer T.K. Zaniewski E. Moyer M.L. Nordeen S.K. Mol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 32708-32714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and chromatin structure has been proposed to be a determinant for PR induction (10Archer T.K. Lee H.-L. Cordingley M.G. Mymryk J.S. Fragoso G. Berard D. Hager G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 568-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 15Smith C.L. Archer T.K. Hamlin-Green G. Hager G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11202-11206Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, alterations in chromatin structure do not appear to be a prerequisite for all steroid receptor-induced gene transactivation. In several cases, chromatin reorganization appears to precede the actions of receptor-steroid complexes in inducing gene expression (14Liu Z. Wong J. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9485-9490Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 18Fryer C.J. Archer T.K. Nature. 1998; 393: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 19Wong J. Patterton D.

Chem. 2000; 275: 20061-20068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in other cases chromatin disruption or remodeling is not sufficient for transactivation, which requires a second step (21Mymryk J.S. Archer T.K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1366-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In T47D cells lacking both PR and GR, or expressing only GR, the responsive B nucleosome of the MMTV enhancer is in a constitutively “open” state, indicating that GR transcriptional activation is independent of chromatin remodeling (20Kinyamu H.K. Fryer C.J. Horwitz K.B. Archer T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20061-20068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The low homology of the amino-terminal halves of GR and PR (<15%) has been advanced as an additional possible cause for selective gene expression (22Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6326) Google Scholar). One mechanism by which this could be achieved is through differential interactions with the recently discovered transcriptional coregulators such as coactivators and corepressors. Although the initially determined interactions of these coregulators were with the ligand binding domain (LBD) of receptors (23McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar, 24Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Robyr D. Wolffe A.P. Wahli W. Mol.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) have been described to be specific coactivators for ARs, whereas a 68-kDa protein (p68) appears to be a coactivator for estrogen receptor (ER) α but not for ERβ, AR, mineralocorticoid receptors, or retinoic acid receptor α (36Endoh H. Maruyama K. Masuhiro Y. Kobayashi Y. Goto M. Tai H. Yanagisawa J. Metzger D. Hashimoto S. Kato S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5363-5372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Repressor of estrogen receptor activity selectively interacts with ERs to decrease both the activity of agonists and the concentration of antiestrogens required for half-maximal inhibition of estrogens (37Montano M.M. Ekena K. Delage-Mourroux R. Chang W. Martini P. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6947-6952Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). NRIF3 is a ligand-dependent specific coactivator that binds (and augments transactivation of) thyroid and retinoid receptors but not retinoic acid, vitamin D, or steroid receptors (38Li D. Desai-Yajnik V. Lo E. Schapira M. Abagyan R. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7191-7202Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). More evidence exists for differential effects of coactivators and corepressors on GR versus PR activities. The nuclear orphan receptor estrogen receptor-related receptor 2 is described to be a repressor of GR transcriptional activity but does not affect PR activity (39Trapp T. Holsboer F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9879-9882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Conversely, PIAS1 enhances GR transactivation but represses PR transactivation in the same system (40Tan J.-a. Hall S.H. Hamil K.G. Grossman G. Petrusz P. Liao J. Shuai K. French F.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 14-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A 130-kDa auxiliary protein increases the DNA binding of full-length GR but not truncated PRs (41Kupfer S.R. Marschke K.B. Wilson E.M. French F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17519-17527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar quantitative differences have been noted for other steroid receptors. SRC-1 has a greater effect on ER than AR action in the brain of developing rats (42Auger A.P. Tetel M.J. McCarthy M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7551-7555Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), which may result from SRC-1 interacting with the ER LBD via the LXXLL motifs of SRC-1 but with the amino-terminal region of AR in a manner that does not depend on the SRC-1 LXXLL motifs (34Bevan C.L. Hoare S. Claessens F. Heery D.M. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8383-8392Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). SRC-1e interacts with the fragments containing the DNA binding domain and LBD of ER but not of AR (28Alen P. Claessens F. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Peeters B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6085-6097Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). RIP140 represses GR (43Subramaniam N. Treuter E. Okret S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 29821-29828Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) transactivation. Whether Zac1 augments or represses the activity of GRIP1 with AR versus ER depends on the target gene and cell (45Huang S.-M. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1855-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Recently we have found that varying concentrations of the homologous receptor, coactivators, and corepressors can alter the EC50of agonist complexes, and the partial agonist activity of antagonist complexes, for both GRs (46Szapary D. Xu M. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30576-30582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 47Szapary D. Huang Y. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 30106-30117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and PRs (49Giannoukos G. Szapary D. Smith C.L. Meeker J.E.W. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Preliminary evidence suggested that the responses of GR and PR to these factors might be different (47Szapary D. Huang Y. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2108-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 48Chen S. Sarlis N.J. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine whether the quantitative activities of those factors known to alter PR and GR transactivation properties are the same or different for PR and GR. To answer this question, we have performed multiple dose-response curves to determine the EC50 of agonists and the partial agonist activity of antagonists. It was important to conduct these assays in the same cells so that cell-specific contributions to transcriptional activities could be eliminated. Similarly, we needed to use the same reporter so that effects of chromatin organization would be minimized. In the context of such an assay system, we found two instances in which the induction properties of PR and GR were qualitatively different, with almost opposite effects being produced by the same added component. Further studies with PR/GR chimeras indicated that no one segment of PR or GR was responsible for these differences. Collectively, the data suggest that the differences between GR and PR induction in a selected cell can be controlled, in part, by unequal responses from the combination of amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains of each receptor to assorted nuclear components. Unless otherwise indicated, all operations were performed at 0 °C. [3H]Dexamethasone (Dex, 91 Ci/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and non-radioactive Dex from Sigma. Dex-Ox (50Pons M. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Org. Chem. 1981; 46: 3262-3264Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and Dex-Mes (51Simons Jr., S.S. Pons M. Johnson D.F. J. Org. Chem. 1980; 45: 3084-3088Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar) were prepared as described. Restriction enzymes and digestions were performed according to the manufacturer's specifications (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The Renilla null luciferase reporter was purchased fromPromega (Madison, WI). GREtkLUC (52Sarlis N.J. Bayly S.F. Szapary D. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 68: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) has been described previously. The cDNA plasmids of GR (pSVLGR from Keith Yamamoto, University of California, San Francisco), MMTVLUC (pLTRLUC from Gordon Hager, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda), TIF2, and the B form of human progesterone receptor (hPR-B) (Hinrich Gronemeyer, IGBMC, Strasbourg, France), NCoR (Michael Rosenfeld, University of California, San Diego), and s-SMRT (53Ordentlich P. Downes M. Xie W. Genin A. Spinner N.B. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2639-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) (Ron Evans, Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA) were each received as gifts. The cDNA encoding GR or PR was recombined through a compatible site (NspI/SphI) that coincides with the position of cysteine 495 of the rat GR. No amino acids were added or subtracted or changed at this junction. Both expression vectors for the chimeric receptors start with the unrelated sequence ASGSWP, which is due to the thymidine kinase promoter AUG followed by a BamHI linker. The PR/GR chimera bears a PR, which is lacking the first 24 amino acids of PR. This deletion has no observable influence on the transactivation capacity of the PR. 2B. Huse, unpublished data. The GR/PR chimera starts with a rat GR that misses 3 amino acids of the amino terminus. Various experiments since this construct was first employed (54Severne Y. Wieland S. Schaffner W. Rusconi S. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2503-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) have confirmed that there is no substantial difference between this GR and the wild type GR. 3S. Rusconi, unpublished data. Monolayer cultures of COS-7 and 1470.2 cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc., and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4.5 g glucose/liter, Quality Biologicals, Inc., respectively) supplemented with 5 and 10% of fetal bovine serum, respectively. We had previously used charcoal-stripped serum with 1470.2 cells to prevent any PR-mediated induction by endogenous progestins (49Giannoukos G. Szapary D. Smith C.L. Meeker J.E.W. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, we have confirmed the observations of others (55Smith C.L. Wolford R.G. O'Neill T.B. Hager G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 956-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) that this is not necessary (data not shown). Therefore, charcoal-stripped serum was no longer used with 1470.2 cells. CV-1 cells were grown as described (46Szapary D. Xu M. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30576-30582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Coregulator plasmids were transiently cotransfected into 1470.2 cells using LipofectAMINE (LIfe Technologies, Inc.) with hPR-B receptor-containing plasmid, 1 μg of GREtkLUC, and 50 ng Renilla null luciferase, with the total transfected DNA brought up to 3 μg/60-mm dish with pBSK+ DNA (56Kaul S. Blackford Jr., J.A. Chen J. Ogryzko V.V. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1010-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In experiments with varying amounts of receptor or coregulator cDNA plasmids, equimolar amounts of the same plasmid vector were cotransfected to control for artifacts of the vector DNA. The cells were treated for 24 h with 1% ethanol ± steroids in media containing 10% fetal bovine serum and harvested in 1× Passive Lysis Buffer (0.5 ml/dish, Promega). Fifty μl of the cell lysates were used to assay for luciferase activity using the Dual-luciferase Assay System from Promega (Madison, WI) according to the supplier. The data were then normalized for the cotransfected Renilla activity. Transient transfection of COS-7 cells with 1 μg/10-cm plate of GR or PR/GR plasmid DNA and 19 μg of single-stranded DNA was performed as described (57Szapary D. Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 941-952PubMed Google Scholar). Cytosols of transfected cells containing the steroid-free receptors were obtained by the lysis of cells on dry ice and centrifugation at 15,000 ×g (58Simons Jr., S.S. Miller P.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6876-6882Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thirty percent cytosol with 20 mm sodium molybdate was added to varying concentrations of [3H]Dex ±100-fold excess of non-radioactive Dex and incubated at 0 °C for 18 h. Unbound [3H]Dex was removed by dextran-coated charcoal. Whole cell steroid binding was performed by incubating suspensions of cells (1.5–2 × 106) with increasing concentrations of [3H]Dex (1.5 to 50 nm) in 200 μl of serum-free medium in the presence or absence of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled Dex (each with 1.2% ethanol) for 30–45 min at 37 °C. The binding was terminated by the addition of 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, followed by centrifugation for 15 s, all at room temperature. Cells were washed three more times with phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature. In both cases, the total binding was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The specific binding was calculated by subtracting the background disintegrations/min (100-fold Dex) from the total [3H]Dex binding. The binding capacity and affinity were determined by Scatchard plot analysis by plotting the ratio of bound steroid/free steroidversus bound steroid. The activity for subsaturating concentrations of agonist, or saturating concentrations of antagonist, was expressed as percent of maximal activity with saturating concentrations of agonist (30 nm R5020 or 1 μm Dex unless otherwise noted). The fold induction was calculated as the luciferase activity (relative firefly light units/relative Renilla light units) with 30 nmR5020, or 1 μm Dex, divided by the basal activity obtained with ethanol. Individual values were generally within ±20% of the average, which was plotted. The dose-response curves were constructed from the theoretical sigmoidal curve for the binding isotherm, which is described by the equation of y = x/(x + k), wherey is the fractional response; x is the concentration of free steroid, and k is an arbitrary value for the binding affinity of steroid to receptor. This theoretical curve was then aligned with the experimental data so as to give the best visual fit. Unless otherwise noted, all statistical analyses were by two-tailed Student's t test using the program “InStat 2.03” for Macintosh (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). A bioassay with transiently transfected receptors and reporters to analyze possible differences in the biological properties of PR and GR was chosen for several reasons. First, bioassays measure the cumulative effect of the proceeding steps in the induction of protein synthesis. Bioassays are also often more sensitive than other assays, like DNA binding (8Schoenmakers E. Verrijdt G. Peeters B. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Claessens F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12290-12297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Furthermore, not allin vitro interactions are sufficiently strong to elicit an effect in whole cell bioassays (59Chen D. Huang S.M. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40810-40816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). A transiently transfected template, in which nucleosome reorganization does not occur (60Archer T.K. Lefebvre P. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Science. 1992; 255: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), was used in order to minimize the possible complications of differential chromosomal reorganization by receptors. The ideal cells for this study would lack both GR and PR but would display dynamic, induction responses over a range of transiently transfected receptors. CV-1 cells lack both GR and PR and respond well to transfected GR (46Szapary D. Xu M. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30576-30582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, in our hands, CV-1 cells give a low fold induction with transfected PR over a very narrow range of transfected receptors (49Giannoukos G. Szapary D. Smith C.L. Meeker J.E.W. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). 4D. Szapary and S. S. Simons, Jr., unpublished results. The 1470.2 mouse mammary adenocarcinoma cells do contain some GR but possess excellent properties regarding gene induction by transfected human PR-B (49Giannoukos G. Szapary D. Smith C.L. Meeker J.E.W. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As both transiently and stably transfected PR induce transactivation with transiently transfected MMTVLUC reporters (49Giannoukos G. Szapary D. Smith C.L. Meeker J.E.W. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 55Smith C.L. Wolford R.G. O'Neill T.B. Hager G.L. Mol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 14227-14235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the use of transiently transfected PR should not pose a problem. PR is limiting for transactivation and capable of displaying increasing levels of gene induction over a range of transiently transfected receptors. PR also responds to a variety of coactivators and corepressors in these cells (49Giannoukos G. Szapary D. Smith C.L. Meeker J.E.W. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Increasing concentrations of transiently transfected PR produce a progressive left shift in the dose-response curve to lower EC50 values for R5020 induction of transiently transfected MMTVLUC reporters in 1470.2 cells (49Giannoukos G. Szapary D. Smith C.L. Meeker J.E.W. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Steroid hormone induction of MMTV is complicated, due to the binding of NF1 and Oct1 to the MMTV promoter (62Lee H.-L. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 32-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to avoid these additional complications, we elected to use the simpler GREtkLUC reporter, which does not contain cis-acting binding sequences for other transcription factors.

Binding of chicken HSP47 to native bovine type I collagen was studied by fluorescence quenching and cooperative binding with a collagen concentration at half saturation (K half) of 1.4 × 10−7m, and a Hill coefficient of 4.3 was observed. Similar results are observed for the binding of mouse HSP47 recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli. Chicken HSP47 binds equally well to native type II and type III procollagen without the carboxyl-terminal propeptide (pN type III collagen), but binding to triple helical collagen-like peptides is much weaker. Weak binding occurred to both hydroxylated and nonhydroxylated collagen-like peptides, and a significant chain length dependence was observed. Binding of HSP47 to native type I collagen had no effect on the thermal stability of the triple helix. Refolding of type I collagen in the presence of HSP47 showed minor changes, but these are probably not biologically significant. Binding of HSP47 to bovine pN type III collagen has only minor effects on the thermal stability of the triple helix and does not influence the refolding kinetics of the triple helix.

Bateman J.F. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). It was shown that HSP47 (also known as colligin, J6, gp46, and CB48) is co-expressed with collagens in cells such as fibroblasts and chondrocytes (4Hirayoshi K. Kudo H. Takechi H. Nakai A.

Cytochem. 1994; 42: 833-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In mouse embryo development, HSP47 is expressed mainly in mesoderm and mesoderm-derived tissues, and the expression correlates both temporally and spatially with that of type I and II collagen (6Tanaka Y. Kobayashi K. Kita M. Masuda H. Kinoshita S. Nagata K. Imanishi J. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 63: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). HSP47 knockout mice show an embryonic lethal phenotype (7Nagai N. Hosokawa M. Itohara S. Adachi E. Matsushita T. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1499-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). HSP47 is isolated easily by affinity chromatography on gelatin-Sepharose (8Nagata K. Saga S. Yamada K.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 153: 428-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 9Saga S. Nagata K. Chen W.T. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and was later shown to interact also with triple helical collagen types I–V (10Natsume T. Koide T. Yokota S. Hirayoshi K. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31224-31228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was found that all these collagens have a similar affinity for HSP47 with dissociation constants of about 10−7m (10Natsume T. Koide T. Yokota S. Hirayoshi K. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31224-31228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction of HSP47 with both unfolded and folded procollagens is unusual and distinguishes HSP47 from other molecular chaperones. A number of potential functions for HSP47 during procollagen biosynthesis have been described. HSP47 binds to nascent procollagen chains and therefore may help prevent the premature association of procollagen chains and/or assist with the translocation of procollagen chains into the rough endoplasmic reticulum (11Sauk J.J. Smith T. Norris K. Ferreira L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3941-3946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HSP47 also interacts with procollagen chains in the rough endoplasmic reticulum when triple helix formation is inhibited by α,α′-dipyridyl, an inhibitor of prolyl-4-hydroxylase (9Saga S. Nagata K. Chen W.T. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). A potential role in vesicular trafficking was explored with Brefeldin A and monensin (9Saga S. Nagata K. Chen W.T. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 12Smith T. Ferreira L.R. Hebert C. Norris K. Sauk J.J. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 469-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In Brefeldin A-treated cells HSP47 remained associated with procollagen, whereas in cells treated with monensin no HSP47 binding was detected. Together this shows that HSP47 seems to release procollagen on entry to the Golgi. Procollagens are not secreted as individual molecules, but rather are secreted in aggregates by a cisternal maturation pathway (14Bonfanti L. Mironov Jr., A.A. Martinez-Menarguez J.A. Martella O. Fusella A. Baldassarre M. Buccione R. Geuze H.J. Mironov A.A. Luini A. Cell. 1998; 95: 993-1003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), and HSP47 could potentially be involved in this process. Conflicting results were obtained with co-expression of HSP47 and procollagens. In human embryonic kidney 293 cells, the secretion of type III procollagen was delayed when HSP47 was co-expressed (15Hosokawa N. Hohenadl C. Satoh M. Kühn K. Nagata K. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), whereas an enhancement of the secretion of human type I procollagen was found in mouse HSP47-expressing insect cells (16Tomita M. Yoshizato K. Nagata K. Kitajima T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 1118-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The exact function of HSP47 during procollagen biosynthesis has not been established. The structural requirements for HSP47 binding to procollagens have been studied recently using synthetic collagen-like peptides (17Koide T. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34523-34526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and also in a yeast two-hybrid system (18Koide T. Aso A. Yorihuzi T. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27957-27963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It was found that the collagen-like peptide (Gly-Pro-Pro)n possesses sufficient information to bind to HSP47 and that hydroxylation of the peptide (Gly-Pro-Hyp)n prevents this interaction (17Koide T. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34523-34526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). By using the two-hybrid system in yeast it was shown that the (Gly-Pro-Pro) tripeptide unit is essential to binding and that HSP47 preferentially recognized the triple helical conformation in these peptides (18Koide T. Aso A. Yorihuzi T. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27957-27963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Another study suggested that HSP47 interacts with and stabilizes correctly folded procollagen (19Tasab M. Batten M.R. Bulleid N.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2204-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In this report we show that HSP47 binds triple helical type I collagen cooperatively and with a much higher affinity than synthetic peptides. We also explore the effect of HSP47 on the thermal stability and refolding of type I and pN type III collagen.1 The purification method was based upon previously published protocols for the purification of HSP47 (9Saga S. Nagata K. Chen W.T. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 20Vaillancourt J.P. Cates G.A. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) but has been modified to improve both the yield and purity of HSP47. After removal of the heads, 6 dozen 15–17-day-old chick embryos were homogenized in an equal volume of homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm each phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride andN-ethylmaleimide, and 1 μg/ml each leupeptin and pepstatin A) in an ice-cold Waring blender at full speed for 2 min in a 4 °C cold room. All further steps were carried out at 4 °C. Large tissue debris was removed by centrifugation of the homogenate at 5,000 ×g in an H-6000A rotor (Sorval) for 15 min. The supernatant from this step was then centrifuged at 150,000 × g in a 45 TI rotor (Beckman) for 1–2 h. The pelleted material from this step was transferred to a plastic specimen container and frozen at −20 °C for storage until later purification steps could be carried out. After four such microsomal pellets had been prepared and stored, they were thawed together in an equal volume of extraction buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.2 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and all the previously used protease inhibitors). After the pellets had completely thawed, 0.5–1.0 μl of diisopropyl fluorophosphate/ml of extract was added, and this solution was stirred vigorously for 4 h on ice. The final microsomal extract was obtained by centrifugation of this solution at 150,000 ×g in a 45 TI rotor (Beckman) for 1–2 h. Using a peristaltic pump, the crude microsomal extract (∼400 ml) was loaded at 0.5–1.0 ml/min onto a 200-ml column (XK50, 5.0 × 10.1 cm) of gelatin-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with gelatin-Sepharose buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.2 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride). After loading the extract, the column was washed with 200 ml gelatin-Sepharose buffer B (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1.0 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonylfluoride) and re-equilibrated with 400 ml of gelatin-Sepharose buffer A. Gelatin-binding proteins were eluted with a 200-ml pH gradient from 7.5 to 5.0 of gelatin-Sepharose Buffer A followed by 200 ml of gelatin-Sepharose buffer A, pH 7.5, and collected in 10-ml fractions. The protein-containing fractions (identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) were pooled, neutralized with Tris base to pH 7.5, concentrated to 45 ml, and dialyzed overnight against 1 liter of monoQ buffer A (20 mmtriethanolamine/HCl, pH 7.0, containing 80 mm NaCl and 0.1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzolsulfonylfluoride.) The dialyzed gelatin-Sepharose pH eluate was loaded into a 50-ml fast protein liquid chromatography Superloop (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), run over a monoQ HR 5/5 column, washed with 25 ml of monoQ buffer A, and collected in 5-ml fractions. The flow-through fractions were highly enriched with the protein HSP47 but also contained some of the endoplasmic reticulum-resident cyclophilin B. Bound proteins were eluted with a 40-ml gradient of 0–100% monoQ buffer B (20 mmtriethanolamine/HCl, pH 7.0, containing 0.8 m NaCl), followed by 5 ml of 100% monoQ buffer B, and collected in 1-ml fractions. The monoQ flow-through fractions were pooled and concentrated to 6–8 ml using Centricon-10 concentrators (Amicon) according to manufacturer recommendations. The HSP47 and cyclophilin B were separated in runs of 2 ml each by chromatography in gelatin-Sepharose buffer A over two tandemly arranged Superose 12 HR 16/50 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and collected in 2-ml fractions. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the peak fractions containing HSP47 were pooled, concentrated to about 1 mg/ml, and stored on ice for later analysis. Type I and pN type III collagens were extracted from fetal bovine skin. Type II collagen was extracted from fetal bovine cartilage. (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 and (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10 was purchased from the Peptide Institute, Inc. (Osaka, Japan), and (Pro-Gly-Pro)n was from Sigma-Aldrich. (Pro-Gly-Pro)n (average molecular mass of about 10 kDa, which corresponds to an average chain length of n = 40) was fractionated on a Sephadex 75 column and divided into two pools with a K av of 0.41 and 0.66, respectively. The measurement of fluorescence spectra was performed on an SLM8000C instrument (SLM Instruments, Inc., Urbana, IL) using the software provided by the manufacturer. For most experiments the excitation wavelength was 275 nm (4-nm bandwidth), but in some cases excitation was at 295 nm. Emission scans were obtained over the wavelength range of 300–400 nm (2-nm bandwidth) for excitation at 275 nm or 310–410 nm for excitation at 295 nm. In most of the binding assays, stock solutions of bovine collagens (0.5–2.0 mg/ml) were added to a solution of tissue-purified chicken HSP47 (0.05–0.2 mg/ml) in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.2 m NaCl in a 1 × 1-cm cell in a thermostatted block at 25 °C with constant stirring. A constant temperature was maintained by a circulating water bath (RCS, Lauda Division, Brinkmann Instruments). After each addition of substrate, the samples were equilibrated for 2 min before emission spectra were acquired. In some experiments recombinant mouse HSP47 was used instead of chicken HSP47. Analysis of the binding data was done by subtracting the emission of the collagens (this is a very small correction) and correcting for dilution. The thermal stability and refolding of bovine type I and pN type III collagen was monitored at 365 nm using a 241MC polarimeter (Perkin-Elmer) with a 10-cm path-length thermostatted cell. The temperature was controlled by two circulating water baths (RCS, Lauda Division, Brinkmann Instruments) and measured with a digital thermometer (Omega Engineering, Inc., Stamford, CT) and a thermistor inserted into the cell. Both the temperature and the ORD signals were recorded and digitized on an HP9070A measurement and plotting system (Hewlett-Packard) connected to an IBM-compatible computer. Protein concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis. Chicken HSP47 was extracted and purified from chick embryos, and mouse HSP47 was expressed in Escherichia coli. Fig.1A shows a 5–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel of purified chicken HSP47. The final yield of highly purified HSP47 from 6 dozen chick embryos was 4–8 mg. Fig.1B shows a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel of purified mouse HSP47 expressed in E. coli. The yield of purified and refolded mouse HSP47 was about 30 mg from a 500-ml culture. Binding of HSP47 to type I collagen was measured by observing the tryptophane fluorescence of HSP47 that is quenched by the addition of type I collagen. These measurements are facilitated by the fact that type I collagen and collagen-like peptides do not contain tryptophane. Fig.2 shows the change in fluorescence as a function of added type I collagen. A sigmoidal curve is observed, indicating cooperative binding. The data were analyzed using the Hill equation. For the binding of chicken HSP47 to type I collagen, aK half of 1.4 × 10−7m and a Hill coefficient P of 4.3 were found (Fig.2A). For recombinantly expressed mouse HSP47 binding to type I collagen, a K half of 1.1 × 10−7m and a Hill coefficient P of 3.2 were determined (Fig. 2B).Figure 2Binding of HSP47 to native type I collagen. The fluorescence of HSP47 was monitored at 340 nm, and the quenching observed by binding to type I collagen is plotted against the type I collagen concentration. A, binding of chicken HSP47; B, binding of recombinant mouse HSP47. Thecurves represent best fits to the equation F= F maxC P/(K halfP +C P), where F is the fluorescence of HSP47 at concentration C of type I collagen,F max is the fluorescence of HSP47 at maximum quenching, K half is the collagen concentration at half saturation, and P is the Hill cooperativity parameter.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine the structural determinants of the HSP47 binding to the triple helix, binding studies using different collagens and collagen-like peptides were done using the same technique. Fig.3 shows the fluorescence quenching of chicken HSP47 by type I collagen, type II collagen, and pN type III collagen. All three collagens seem to bind about equally to HSP47. However, binding of collagen-like peptides is much weaker. Again, a cooperative effect is observed when the high and low molecular weight fractions of (Pro-Gly-Pro)n are compared; the higher molecular weight fraction shows better binding to HSP47. Binding of the classical collagen-like peptides (Gly-Pro-Pro)10 and (Gly-Pro-Hyp)10 to HSP47 is very weak, and these peptides seem to be a poor choice for determining a change in binding between hydroxylated and nonhydroxylated triple helices. Binding of HSP47 to collagen could influence the properties of the triple helix. The effect of HSP47 on the thermal stability of type I and pN type III collagen was studied. Because the interaction of HSP47 with collagen is abolished at pH 5, and collagens tend to form fibrils at neutral pH and elevated temperatures, measurements were done in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.4 mNaCl. Fig. 4A shows that the thermal stability of type I collagen is not affected by the presence of HSP47. There is a small effect on the melting behavior of pN type III collagen. We have observed previously that pN type III collagen has a tendency to form aggregates even in the high salt buffer. This is evident from a fraction of higher melting material. In the presence of HSP47, this aggregation is not observed, and the melting curve is slightly shifted to lower temperatures (Fig. 4B). Because HSP47 interacts with both folded and unfolded triple helices, the refolding of type I collagen in Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl was measured. The type I collagen was denatured for 15 min at 45 °C, and refolding was observed at 25 °C. Type I has been shown previously to refold very poorly, and also in these experiments we only get less than 30% of the initial signal back after 90 min of refolding. In the presence of HSP47, the recovered signal is slightly higher (Fig. 5A). More remarkable is the change from an exponential kinetic to a zero-order kinetic typically observed for the refolding of type III collagen (21Bächinger H.P. Bruckner P. Timpl R. Prockop D.J. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 106: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). However, these changes are quite small. Refolding of pN type III collagen proceeds with an initial zero-order reaction and reaches at least 90% of the initial signal. The initial rate was independent of the presence or absence of HSP47 (Fig.5B). Binding of HSP47 to native type I–V collagens was investigated previously by surface plasmon resonance measurements. A dissociation constant of 1.1 × 10−6m was determined for the binding of recombinantly expressed mouse HSP47 to porcine type I collagen (10Natsume T. Koide T. Yokota S. Hirayoshi K. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31224-31228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This dissociation constant results from a relatively high association rate of 2.08 × 104m−1 s−1 and a rapid dissociation rate of 2.36 × 10−2 s−1. No cooperativity in binding was reported. The K halfdetermined here by fluorescence quenching is about an order of magnitude smaller (1.4 × 10−7), and binding is cooperative with a Hill coefficient of 4.3. Cooperative binding is consistent with the finding that a strong chain length dependence is observed for (Pro-Gly-Pro)n. The fraction with aK av of 0.41, corresponding to a greater chain length than the fraction with a K av of 0.66, binds HSP47 better. On a per tripeptide unit basis, increased fluorescence quenching is observed going from (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 to larger (Pro-Gly-Pro)npolypeptides. However, the native collagens type I and pN III bind HSP47 much stronger. Type I collagen (Gly-Xaa-Yaa)336quenches the HSP47 fluorescence much more than even the longest collagen-like peptides measured. The reason for this can be that there is still a chain length effect or that HSP47 prefers other tripeptide units over (Gly-Pro-Pro). Binding of (Gly-Pro-Pro)10 and (Gly-Pro-Hyp)10 to HSP47 is weak, and not much difference in fluorescence quenching is observed. It was proposed recently that HSP47 binds to (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 but not to (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10 and that this is a possible mechanism for the release of HSP47 from collagen (17Koide T. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34523-34526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The collagens measured here are extracted from tissues and believed to be fully hydroxylated. Because HSP47 binds these collagens well, the proposed mechanism seems unlikely. Because HSP47 binds to folded collagens, there is the potential that HSP47 modifies the properties of the collagen triple helix. The stability of type I collagen in the presence and absence of HSP47 shows no differences. It was shown previously that the interaction of HSP47 with collagen is strongly pH-dependent, with binding being abolished below pH 6.3 (9Saga S. Nagata K. Chen W.T. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Measuring the stability of the collagen triple helix around a neutral pH is difficult, because collagens tend to form fibrils at that pH and elevated temperatures. Aggregation has been observed previously with pN type III collagen, but these aggregates can be minimized by the addition of 0.4 m NaCl. Interestingly, during the measurement of the stability of pN type III collagen in the presence of HSP47, no aggregation was observed, whereas in the absence of HSP47, some higher melting aggregates were found under the same conditions. Thus binding of HSP47 influences the aggregation behavior of collagens, and this was shown in a recent paper (22Thomson C.A. Ananthanarayanan V.S. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Because HSP47 binds both unfolded and folded collagens, we tested the effect on the rate of refolding of the triple helix of type I and pN type III collagen. The folding mechanism for pN type III collagen has been described (21Bächinger H.P. Bruckner P. Timpl R. Prockop D.J. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 106: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), and HSP47 does not have an effect on the rate of folding. In refolding experiments with type I collagen, HSP47 binding seems to provide a nucleation site for refolding. However, the increase in refolding is probably not biologically relevant. From these studies, we conclude that HSP47 preferentially binds to folded triple helices but does not influence the stability and folding of the collagen triple helix. Therefore, it seems likely that HSP47 is involved in the segregation of procollagen to the cisternal maturation pathway. We thank Diane Mechling, Bruce Boswell, Jay Gambee, and Bruce Donaldson for expert technical assistance."

Secretion of HasASM is limited to the HasSM system. However, HasA proteins from Pseudomonas fluorescens (HasAPF) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were exported through the Lip and HasSMsystems. To investigate the specificity in Lip exporter-mediated secretion, secretion analysis was performed using chimeras containing the HasAPF and HasASM sequences. The segment Val-Ala-Leu (designated R1 to R3 sites), which is present close to the C terminus of HasAPF but not HasASM, was revealed to be involved in the substrate specificity of the Lip exporter. Introduction of amino acid substitutions into the R1–R5 region demonstrated that R1, R3, R4, and R5 sites require some specific amino acid residues for Lip-mediated secretion. The amino acid sequence of the region was conserved considerably among the proteins secreted by the Lip exporter. On the contrary, the region was not related to HasA secretion through the HasSM system. Interestingly, a typical C-terminal motif, so far regarded as a secretion signal, was not necessary for secretion through either the Lip or the HasSM exporter. In LipASM secretion via the Lip system, the typical C-terminal motif was not essential either, but the presence of a sequence similar to Val-Ala-Leu and its location from the C terminus greatly affect the secretion level. Secretion analyses using hybrid exporters and competitors exhibited that the R1–R5 region was recognized by an ABC protein of the Lip exporter, LipB, and that the mutations aborting Lip-mediated secretion in the region resulted in a loss of the affinity to LipB. Thus, a determinant within the secretory protein for Lip-mediated secretion was fully defined."

Here we show that particles can also be refracted and even totally internally reflected, as evidenced by an electron beam of 28.5 × 109 electron volts being deflected by more than a milli-radian upon exiting a passive boundary between a plasma and a gas — the electron beam is bent away from the normal to the interface, just like light leaving a medium of higher refractive index. This phenomenon could lead to the replacement of magnetic kickers by fast optical kickers in particle accelerators, for example, or to compact magnet-less storage rings in which beams are guided by plasma fibre optics."
https://openalex.org/W2026319826,"Expression of the COOH-terminal residues 179–330 of the LSP1 protein in the LSP1+ B-cell line W10 increases anti-IgM- or ionomycin-induced apoptosis, suggesting that expression of this LSP1 truncate (B-LSP1) interferes with a Ca2+-dependent step in anti-IgM signaling. Here we show that inhibition of Ca2+-dependent conventional protein kinase C (cPKC) isoforms with Gö6976 increases anti-IgM-induced apoptosis of W10 cells and that expression of B-LSP1 inhibits translocation of PKCβI but not of PKCβII or PKCα to the plasma membrane. The increased anti-IgM-induced apoptosis is partially reversed by overexpression of PKCβI. This shows that the B-LSP1-mediated inhibition of PKCβI leads to increased anti-IgM-induced apoptosis. Expression of constitutively active PKCβI protein in W10 cells activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK2, whereas expression of B-LSP1 inhibits anti-IgM-induced activation of ERK2, suggesting that anti-IgM-activated PKCβI is involved in the activation of ERK2 and that inhibition of ERK2 activation contributes to the increased anti-IgM-induced apoptosis. Pull-down assays show that LSP1 interacts with PKCβI but not with PKCβII or PKCα in W10 cell lysates, while in vitro LSP1 and B-LSP1 bind directly to PKCβI. Thus, B-LSP1 is a unique reagent that binds PKCβI and inhibits anti-IgM-induced PKCβI translocation, leading to inhibition of ERK2 activation and increased apoptosis. Expression of the COOH-terminal residues 179–330 of the LSP1 protein in the LSP1+ B-cell line W10 increases anti-IgM- or ionomycin-induced apoptosis, suggesting that expression of this LSP1 truncate (B-LSP1) interferes with a Ca2+-dependent step in anti-IgM signaling. Here we show that inhibition of Ca2+-dependent conventional protein kinase C (cPKC) isoforms with Gö6976 increases anti-IgM-induced apoptosis of W10 cells and that expression of B-LSP1 inhibits translocation of PKCβI but not of PKCβII or PKCα to the plasma membrane. The increased anti-IgM-induced apoptosis is partially reversed by overexpression of PKCβI. This shows that the B-LSP1-mediated inhibition of PKCβI leads to increased anti-IgM-induced apoptosis. Expression of constitutively active PKCβI protein in W10 cells activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK2, whereas expression of B-LSP1 inhibits anti-IgM-induced activation of ERK2, suggesting that anti-IgM-activated PKCβI is involved in the activation of ERK2 and that inhibition of ERK2 activation contributes to the increased anti-IgM-induced apoptosis. Pull-down assays show that LSP1 interacts with PKCβI but not with PKCβII or PKCα in W10 cell lysates, while in vitro LSP1 and B-LSP1 bind directly to PKCβI. Thus, B-LSP1 is a unique reagent that binds PKCβI and inhibits anti-IgM-induced PKCβI translocation, leading to inhibition of ERK2 activation and increased apoptosis. membrane immunoglobulin M leukocyte-specific protein 1 protein kinase C conventional protein kinase C glutathioneS-transferase mitogen-activated protein myelin basic protein Hanks' buffered saline solution forward scatter side scatter Many mouse and human B-lymphoma cell lines are susceptible to anti-IgM-induced apoptosis (1Benhamou L.E.

However, anti-IgM treatment also activates potentially anti-apoptotic signaling pathways such as activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and its downstream target Akt/PKB or activation of PKC (10Gold M.R.

Thus, the outcome of anti-IgM signaling depends on a balance of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic signals. Activation and translocation of PKC by phorbol ester protects normal immature and mature mouse B-lymphocytes, the mouse B-lymphoma cell line WEHI-231, human B-lymphoma cell lines and human B-CLL cells from anti-IgM-induced apoptosis (1Benhamou L.E.

The precise PKC isoform involved in protection from anti-IgM-induced apoptosis is not yet known. Evidence for a role of one or more of the Ca2+-dependent cPKC isoforms α, βI, βII, or γ in this protection comes from experiments showing that the protective action of phorbol esters on immature B-lymphocytes (13King L.B. Norvell A. Monroe J.G. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2655-2662PubMed Google Scholar) is abrogated by a cPKC-specific inhibitor. This inhibitor also renders mature B-lymphocytes susceptible to anti-IgM-induced apoptosis (13King L.B. Norvell A. Monroe J.G. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2655-2662PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that anti-IgM-induced activation of cPKC isoforms plays an important role in regulating susceptibility of different B-lymphocyte lineage cells to anti-IgM-induced apoptosis. The mouse leukocyte-specific protein 1 (LSP1) is a 330-amino acid residue intracellular protein expressed in B- and T-lymphocytes and in macrophages and neutrophils (15Jongstra J. Tidmarsh G.F. Jongstra-Bilen J. Davis M.M. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 3999-4004PubMed Google Scholar, 16Klein D.P. Jongstra-Bilen J. Ogryzlo K. Chong R. Jongstra J. Mol. Cell.

Immunology. 1999; 96: 262-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Transfection experiments using the LSP1+ B-lymphoma cell line WEHI-231/89 or a single cell subclone, W10, showed that expression of an LSP1 truncate containing residues 179–330 (designated B-LSP1) significantly increased the extent of apoptosis induced by anti-IgM or by ionomycin but not by sorbitol, nocodazole, C2-ceramide, or H2O2 (20Jongstra-Bilen J. Wielowieyski A. Misener V. Jongstra J. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Expression of B-LSP1 had no effect on anti-IgM-induced growth arrest. Consistent with a role of LSP1 in the early induction phase of apoptosis, we found that, after anti-IgM treatment, the number of cells showing loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) increased faster in the B-LSP1 transfectant than in the parental cells (20Jongstra-Bilen J. Wielowieyski A. Misener V. Jongstra J. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). From these experiments we concluded that LSP1 regulates an early step in the induction of anti-IgM-mediated apoptosis, downstream of the anti-IgM-induced increase in [Ca2+]i , but upstream of the loss of ΔΨm. Given the protective role of the Ca2+-dependent cPKC isoforms in anti-IgM-induced apoptosis, we asked whether the expression of B-LSP1 inhibits anti-IgM-induced translocation of cPKC isoforms and, if so, whether this increases anti-IgM-induced apoptosis by inhibiting the cPKC-regulated activation of the MAP kinase ERK2. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium as described (20Jongstra-Bilen J. Wielowieyski A. Misener V. Jongstra J. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The W10 cell line is a single cell subclone of the B-lymphoma cell line WEHI-231/89, and the TW10.1 cell line is a stable G418 resistant transfectant derived from W10 cells expressing the LSP1 truncate B-LSP1 containing LSP1 residues 179–330 (20Jongstra-Bilen J. Wielowieyski A. Misener V. Jongstra J. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To overexpress PKCβI, TW10.1 cells were co-transfected with the pcDNA3 vector containing a rat PKCβI cDNA and with the pBABE-puro vector, mixed in a 2:1 molar ratio. Cells were selected in 1 mg/ml G418 and 0.25 μg/ml puromycin. The constitutively active PKCβIΔNPS construct encoding rat PKCβI without the pseudosubstrate containing residues 1–30 was expressed following electroporation of W10 cells and selection in 1 mg/ml G418. Parental and transfected cells were cultured in 24-well plates with or without the addition of 5 μg/ml goat anti-mouse IgM (Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, Ontario, Canada). Apoptosis was assessed using fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis to determine the fraction of viable cells identified by their normal forward scatter/side scatter (FSC/SSC) profile after 72 h in culture or by determination of the fraction of cells containing subdiploid DNA 48 h after the initiation of culture (20Jongstra-Bilen J. Wielowieyski A. Misener V. Jongstra J. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 21Nicoletti I. Migliorati M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4431) Google Scholar). Inhibitors were added either alone or 15 min before the addition of anti-IgM. For PKC translocation experiments, W10 or TW10.1 cells were washed twice in Hank's buffered saline solution (HBSS) and resuspended at 25 × 106 cells/ml in HBSS. Three aliquots of 1 ml in microcentrifuge tubes were then warmed at 37 °C for 10 min in a water bath. Goat anti-mouse IgM was added to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml to two tubes, and incubation at 37 °C was then continued. Cells from the third tube served as the unstimulated controls and were recovered by centrifugation for 30 s in a microcentrifuge, washed once in cold HBSS, and stored on ice. Anti-IgM-stimulated cells were recovered after 5 or 20 min of incubation. To prepare plasma membrane fractions, cells were resuspended for 30 min in cold hypotonic fractionation buffer (Buffer A: 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (22Klein D.P. Galea S. Jongstra J. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 2967-2973PubMed Google Scholar,23Jongstra-Bilen J. Janmey P.A. Hartwig J.H. Galea S. Jongstra J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1443-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and then disrupted by 50 strokes in a small Potter homogenizer. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 5 min at 500 ×g. Supernatants were layered on top of 1.2 ml of 1.2m sucrose in buffer A and spun at 10,000 ×g for 15 min to remove the majority of mitochondria. The lysates were then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The high speed pellet was designated as the plasma membrane fraction and was solubilized in buffer A, while the supernatant was designated as the cytoplasmic fraction. Protein concentrations were determined according to the Bradford method using reagents from Bio-Rad (Oakville, Ontario, Canada). Equal amounts of protein were separated on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and analyzed by using antibodies specific for PKCα (Sigma-Aldrich) or PKCβI or PKCβII (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Blots were developed with ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Oakville, Ontario, Canada) followed by exposure to film or with SuperSignal West Femto reagent (Pierce) followed by imaging in a Bio-Rad Fluor-Smax. Film exposures were converted to .tif files using a scanner, and differences in band intensities were quantitated using Quantity One software from Bio-Rad. Each gel contained a set of 2-fold dilutions of a total cell lysate from W10 or TW10.1 cells to construct a standard curve used for quantitation of protein signals. Total lysates were prepared by lysing 107 cells directly in 1 ml of Laemmli sample buffer. Cells (25 × 106cells/ml) were warmed to 37 °C for 10 min and then stimulated with 50 μg/ml anti-IgM with or without pretreatment with 0.25 μm Gö6976 or 25 μm PD098059 for 15 min. Cells were harvested at different times after addition of anti-IgM, pelleted for 30 s in a microcentrifuge, lysed in 1× sample buffer, and immersed in boiling water for 3 min. Phosphorylation of ERK2 was then analyzed on polyacrylamide gels with an acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio of 118:1 (24Scheid M.P. Duronio V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7439-7444Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), followed by Western analysis with anti-ERK2 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., catalog no. sc-154). ERK2 kinase activity was measured in an in vitro immune kinase assay. Cells were harvested as above and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mmNaVO3, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After incubation on ice for 15 min, the insoluble material was pelleted for 15 min at 13,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge and ERK2 was precipitated from the soluble lysates by addition of 5 μg of anti-ERK2 antibody followed by incubation at 4 °C. After 1 h, 20 μl of protein G-agarose slurry (Pierce) was added and incubation was continued for an additional 30 min. Protein G-agarose beads were recovered by centrifugation, washed three times in lysis buffer, and washed once in kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA). To measure kinase activity, beads were resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 2 mm sodium vanadate, 5 mm β-2-mercaptoethanol, 7 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP), and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 mCi/mmol) and incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 30 μl of 3× Laemmli sample buffer prewarmed to 55 °C, followed by immersion in boiling water for 3 min. Phosphorylation of MBP was then analyzed on 12.5% SDS-acrylamide gels and quantitated using a phosphoimager (Personal FX, Bio-Rad). To probe for LSP1/PKC interactions in cell lysates, 4 × 107 W10 cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and a mixture of protease inhibitors as described (22Klein D.P. Galea S. Jongstra J. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 2967-2973PubMed Google Scholar, 23Jongstra-Bilen J. Janmey P.A. Hartwig J.H. Galea S. Jongstra J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1443-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and incubated with 1–2 μg of a GST-LSP1 fusion protein containing the intact LSP1 (residues 1–330). After 1 h of incubation at 4 °C, 10 μl of a 1:1 slurry of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) was added and incubated for an additional 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were recovered by brief centrifugation in a microcentrifuge and washed five times with 1 ml of lysis buffer + 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and the recovered proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. To determine binding of LSP1 with PKCβI in vitro, 1 μg of GST fusion protein containing LSP1 residues 1–330, 1–178, or 179–330 was mixed with 50 ng of recombinant human PKCβI (PanVera Corp., Madison, WI) in 250 μl of 1× PKC buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2). After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, glutathione-Sepharose beads were added and the incubation was continued for an additional 30 min. Beads were recovered by centrifugation and washed four times in 1 ml of 1× PKC buffer, and the amounts of bound PKCβI and recovered GST and GST fusion protein were analyzed by Western blotting. Treatment of mature B-cells with a cPKC-specific inhibitor renders these cells susceptible to anti-IgM-induced apoptosis, suggesting that anti-IgM-activated cPKC plays a role in the protection of B-cells from anti-IgM-induced cell death (13King L.B. Norvell A. Monroe J.G. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2655-2662PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether activated cPKC has a similar role in the B-lymphoma cell line W10, we treated these cells with anti-IgM in the presence or absence of Gö6976, a PKC inhibitor that preferentially inhibits the cPKC isoforms α, βI, and βII (25Gschwendt M. Dieterich S. Rennecke J. Kittstein W. Mueller H.J. Johannes F.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 26Wenzel-Seifert K. Schachtele C. Seifert R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1536-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The extent of apoptosis was determined by measuring changes in the FSC/SSC profile of the cells at 72 h (20Jongstra-Bilen J. Wielowieyski A. Misener V. Jongstra J. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 21Nicoletti I. Migliorati M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4431) Google Scholar). Treatment of W10 cells with 0.25 μm Gö6976 or with 5 μg/ml anti-IgM results in only a slight reduction of viable cells; 70.6% of anti-IgM-treated cells and 76.4% of Gö6976-treated cells display a normal FSC/SSC profile after 72 h of culture (Fig.1). In contrast, the addition of both agents reduces the number of cells with a normal FSC/SSC profile to 10.4%. The addition of Gö6976 could be delayed for at least 20 min after addition of anti-IgM, which shows that the protective action of cPKC depends on a relatively late event and that activation of cPKC immediately following anti-IgM stimulation is not sufficient to protect W10 cells from anti-IgM-induced apoptosis (data not shown). The combined effect of Gö6976 and anti-IgM on apoptosis of W10 cells is similar to the effect of expressing B-LSP1 as only 16.8% of the anti-IgM-treated TW10.1 cells display a normal FSC/SSC profile after 72 h. To confirm that cell death occurs by apoptosis, we determined the number of cells containing subdiploid DNA after 48 h of culture. W10 cells treated with anti-IgM or with Gö6976 contain 20.8% or 20.7% cells with subdiploid DNA, respectively, whereas W10 cells treated with both agents contain 50.1% cells with subdiploid DNA. Again, the effect of expressing B-LSP1 is similar to the effect of treatment with Gö6976, as 55.2% of anti-IgM-treated TW10.1 cells contain subdiploid DNA (data not shown). Since the cPKCγ isoform is not expressed in these cells (27Tsutsumi A. Freire-Moar J. Ransom J.T. Cell. Immunol. 1992; 142: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), these results suggest that the anti-apoptotic effect of activated cPKC is due to activation of one or more of the PKCα, -βI, or -βII isoforms. Increased anti-IgM-induced apoptosis was evident after treatment of W10 cells with Gö6976 or after transfection with B-LSP1 containing LSP1 residues 179–330. To determine whether expression of B-LSP1 inhibits the activation of cPKC, we measured the extent of anti-IgM-induced translocation of PKCα, -βI, and -βII to the plasma membrane fractions of W10 cells and of the transfectant TW10.1. Translocation of PKC is often used as a measure of activation (28Liu W.S. Heckman C.A. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 529-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Plasma membrane fractions were prepared from unstimulated cells and from cells stimulated at 37 °C with anti-IgM for 5 or 20 min. Equal amounts of plasma membrane protein were analyzed for the presence of PKCα, -βI, and -βII by Western blotting. All three PKC isoforms tested translocated to the plasma membrane after treatment of W10 cells with anti-IgM (Fig.2). Translocation was evident after 5 min of stimulation and did not change significantly for the next 15 min. Translocation of PKCα and PKCβII in TW10.1 cells did not differ significantly from that measured in W10 cells. Interestingly, translocation of PKCβI was significantly inhibited in TW10.1 cells, when measured 5 or 20 min after addition of anti-IgM. We conclude from these data that expression of B-LSP1 specifically inhibits anti-IgM-induced PKCβI translocation to the plasma membrane. To determine whether the increased anti-IgM-induced apoptosis of TW10.1 cells is due to the inhibition of PKCβI activation, we transfected TW10.1 cells with an expression vector encoding intact rat PKCβI and selected four colonies in which the expression levels of PKCβI were 2–3 times higher than in the untransfected TW10.1 cells. We also isolated four control colonies that express the puromycin resistance gene but have no increased levels of PKCβI. Stimulation with anti-IgM showed that overexpression of PKCβI rendered the TW10.1 cells less susceptible to anti-IgM-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1). Although only 16.8% of TW10.1 cells or 17.1% of the puromycin resistant control colonies (data not shown) were viable after 72 h of anti-IgM stimulation, 35.4% of PKCβI-overexpressing TW10.1 transfectants remained viable. This shows that the B-LSP1-mediated inhibition of PKCβI contributes significantly to the B-LSP1-mediated increase in anti-IgM-induced apoptosis of TW10.1 cells. The partial reversal may be related to the level of overexpression of PKCβI. Alternatively, it may indicate that expression of B-LSP1 also affects anti-IgM-induced apoptosis through mechanisms that do not involve PKCβI activation. To determine whether the specific inhibition of anti-IgM-induced translocation of PKCβI affects a known cPKC-regulated, anti-IgM-stimulated signaling pathway, we measured the anti-IgM-induced activation of the MAP kinase ERK2 in W10 and TW10.1 cells. Activation of ERK2 is associated with survival in many cell types (29Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar, 30Cross T.G. Scheel-Toellner D. Henriquez N.V. Deacon E. Salmon M. Lord J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar), and results in Fig. 1 show that this is the case in W10 cells as well. Treatment of W10 cells with 25 μmPD098059, an inhibitor specific for MEK1 (31Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar), the direct activator of ERK2, does not significantly affect cell viability as 89.1% of W10 cells displayed a normal FSC/SSC profile after 72 h of culture. However, in cultures treated with PD098059 and 5 μg/ml anti-IgM, only 34.3% of cells were viable, showing that anti-IgM-induced activation of ERK2 protects W10 cells from anti-IgM-induced apoptosis. Anti-IgM stimulation activates ERK2 in a PKC-independent manner through the RAS/Raf-1/MEK1 pathway (12Campbell K.S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 256-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 32Tordai A. Franklin R.A. Patel H. Gardner A.M. Johnson G.L. Gelfand E.W. J. Biol.

Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar) and in a PKC-dependent manner through activation of Raf-1 (34Hashimoto A. Okada H. Jiang A. Kurosaki M. Greenberg S. Clark E.A. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1287-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 35Jiang A. Craxton A. Kurosaki T. Clark E.A. J. Exp.

Different PKC isoforms can contribute to Raf-1 activation when overexpressed in COS cells (37Schoenwasser D.C. Marais R.M. Marshall C.J. Parker P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 790-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar), but the specific PKC isoform involved in anti-IgM-induced Raf-1/MEK1/ERK2 activation in B-cells is not yet known. Fig. 3 A shows that treatment of W10 cells with 0.25 μm Gö6976 or with 25 μm PD098059 significantly inhibits anti-IgM-induced ERK2 activation as measured by the appearance of phosphorylated ERK2, which has a slightly lower mobility on SDS-PAGE than the non-phosphorylated form of ERK2. These results confirm that, in W10 cells, activated cPKC isoforms contribute to the activation of ERK2 and that activation of ERK2 depends on active MEK1. It is interesting to note that the effect of Gö6976 is more pronounced after 20 min than after 2 min of anti-IgM stimulation, whereas the MEK1 inhibitor PD098059 acts equally well at both time points. Increasing the pre-incubation time for Gö6976 to 35 min gave a similar result (data not shown). This suggests that the early activation of MEK1/ERK2 by anti-IgM stimulation is less dependent on activation of cPKC, whereas at later times activated cPKC contributes significantly to ERK2 activation. The early activation of ERK2 activation may be more dependent on activated RAS. We determined the involvement of PKCβI in anti-IgM-induced ERK2 activation by two approaches. First, W10 cells were transfected with a pcDNA3-based expression vector encoding a constitutively active PKCβI protein (PKCβIΔNPS, lacking the NH2-terminal pseudosubstrate region) and two colonies expressing the PKCβIΔNPS protein were selected. Two G418-resistant colonies that do not express PKCβIΔNPS were selected as control cells. Fig. 3 B shows that ERK2 activity is 4–5 times higher in the PKCβIΔNPS-expressing transfectants than in the control cells, showing that activation of PKCβI leads to activation of the ERK2 pathway. Second, we analyzed ERK2 activation in W10 and TW10.1 cells in which the anti-IgM-induced translocation of PKCβI is inhibited. ERK2 activation was measured 2, 10, and 20 min after anti-IgM treatment, using the decreased mobility of phosphorylated ERK2 on SDS-PAGE as a read-out (Fig. 3 C) or by measuring ERK2 activity in an immune kinase assay (Fig. 3,D and E). In W10 cells, ERK2 is activated efficiently after 2 min of anti-IgM stimulation and does not change significantly over the next 15 min. The extent of activation of ERK2 in TW10.1 cells is similar to that found in W10 cells when measured 2 or 10 min after stimulation but after 20 min is significantly less than in W10 cells. These data show that inhibition of cPKC with Gö6976 or inhibition of PKCβI by expression of B-LSP1 both inhibit only the late but not the early activation of ERK2 by anti-IgM. This is strong evidence that anti-IgM-induced activation of PKCβI contributes significantly to the late activation of ERK2. Given that inhibition of ERK2 by PD098059 increases the extent of anti-IgM-induced apoptosis, we suggest that the inhibition of ERK2 activation in TW10.1 cells contributes to the increase in anti-IgM-induced apoptosis. The designation of ERK2 as an anti-apoptotic protein does not agree with a report showing that inhibition of anti-IgM-induced activation of ERK2 in WEHI-231 cells protects from anti-IgM-induced apoptosis (38Lee J.R. Koretzky G.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1637-1644PubMed Google Scholar). These discordant findings may be related to the different methods used to inhibit ERK2 activation. Whereas we established a protective role for ERK2 using the MEK1 inhibitor PD098059 to inhibit ERK2, the pro-apoptotic role of ERK2 was established using expression of the phosphatase MKP-1 to inhibit ERK2. However, this phosphatase is not specific for ERK2 and inhibits other members of the MAP kinase family, p38 and stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase 1 as well (39Chu Y. Solski P.A. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Kelly K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6497-6501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). We used pull-down experiments to determine whether LSP1 interacts with PKCβI. A GST fusion protein containing the intact LSP1 or the GST protein was mixed with Nonidet P-40-soluble lysates from W10 cells. After incubation for 1 h, the GST protein and the LSP1/GST fusion proteins were recovered using glutathione-Sepharose beads and analyzed by Western blotting. Using this protocol PKCβI but not PKCα or PKCβII were recovered from lysates when mixed with the LSP1/GST fusion protein. No detectable amounts of PKCα, -βI, or -βII were recovered using the GST protein, indicating a specific interaction of LSP1 with PKCβI (Fig. 4 A). To determine whether PKCβI and LSP1 interact directly, we performedin vitro binding assays using human recombinant PKCβI and GST fusion proteins containing different LSP1 sequences. One μg of GST or GST fusion protein was incubated with 50 ng of recombinant human PKCβI. Fig. 4 B shows that PKCβI interacts preferentially with intact LSP1 or with the COOH-terminal domain residues 179–330. In replicate experiments, binding to the NH2-terminal residues 1–178 is not significantly higher than binding to the GST protein alone, indicating that the preferential binding site or sites for PKCβI are located between LSP1 residues 179 and 330. We do not as yet know why expression of LSP1 residues 179–330 in the LSP1+ TW10.1 cells inhibits translocation of PKCβI, but we propose that the endogenous, intact LSP1 sequesters inactive PKCβI to a cytosolic localization and that, in response to anti-IgM-generated signals, the LSP1/PKCβI complex dissociates, allowing for the translocation of PKCβI. The release of PKCβI from B-LSP1 in response to anti-IgM stimulation may be less efficient, leading to inhibition of PKCβI translocation. LSP1 is a Ca2+-binding protein and contains two putative Ca2+-binding EF-hand motifs near the NH2 terminus (16Klein D.P. Jongstra-Bilen J. Ogryzlo K. Chong R. Jongstra J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3043-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, binding of Ca2+ to the NH2-terminal domain may result in a structural change in the COOH-terminal domain, leading to dissociation of PKCβI. Since both EF-hand motifs are absent from B-LSP1, suggesting that B-LSP1 does not bind Ca2+, the B-LSP1/PKCβI complex may not dissociate after the anti-IgM-induced increase in [Ca2+]i thereby inhibiting the movement of PKCβI to the plasma membrane. Alternatively, since the NH2-terminal domain of LSP1 contains a phosphorylation site for casein kinase II (40Gimble J.M. Dorheim M.A. Youkhana K. Hudson J. Nead M. Gilly M. Wood Jr., W.J. Hermanson G.G. Kuehl M. Wall R. Kincade P.W. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 115-121PubMed Google Scholar) and several putative PKC phosphorylation sites, it is possible that the binding of PKCβI to LSP1 residues 179–330 is regulated by phosphorylation of specific sites in the LSP1 NH2-terminal domain. Thus, LSP1 may protect from apoptosis only in response to certain signals such as increased [Ca2+]i . Apoptosis induced by sorbitol, nocodazole, C2-ceramide, or H2O2 is not regulated by LSP1 (20Jongstra-Bilen J. Wielowieyski A. Misener V. Jongstra J. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), possibly because these signals do not lead to dissociation of PKCβI from LSP1. The study of PKC isoform-specific functions is hampered by the lack of isoform-specific activators or inhibitors. Our data suggest that B-LSP1 is a unique reagent that specifically inhibits the anti-IgM-induced activation of PKCβI. Experiments to determine whether B-LSP1 also inhibits PKCβI translocation in response to other Ca2+-generating signals such as ionomycin or anti-CD20 stimulation are currently under way. We have used expression of B-LSP1 to inhibit anti-IgM-induced translocation of PKCβI in a transformed B-cell line, which significantly impacted on the susceptibility of these cells to anti-IgM-induced apoptosis. Many B-lymphoma cell lines are susceptible to anti-IgM-induced apoptosis, a characteristic that forms the basis for using anti-Ig antibodies as therapy for B-lymphomain vivo (41Hsu F.J. Caspar C.B.

We demonstrate that phosphorylation of cHMGA by CK2 alters its conformation and modulates its DNA binding properties such that a subsequent phosphorylation by Cdc2 kinase changes the organization of the protein-DNA complex. In contrast, consecutive phosphorylation by MAP kinase, which results in a dramatic change in cHMGA conformation, has no direct effect on the complex. Because the phosphorylation of the HMGA proteins attenuates binding affinity and reduces the extent of contacts between the DNA and protein, it is likely that this process mirrors the dynamics and diversity of regulatory processes in chromatin.

This group comprises three families of structurally unrelated proteins: HMGB, 2The nomenclature of the mammalian HMG proteins has been revised recently; see the HMG protein home page.

The presence of 2–15 AT-hooks, the putative DNA binding domains (DBD), is common for the HMGA family (for comparison of multiple AT-hook-containing proteins see Ref. 5Aravind L. Landsman D.

The cHMGA protein from Chironomus tentans is the only characterized HMGA protein originating from a non-mammalian species. Like its mammalian counterparts, it has three AT-hook domains and a C-terminal stretch of mainly acidic amino acid residues (7Claus P. Schulze E. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33042-33048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, mammalian and insect proteins are phosphorylated by the same kinases. In this work we studied the consequences of phosphorylation of cHMGA on the conformation of the protein and its interaction with DNA. We show that phosphorylation of cHMGA by CK2, Cdc2 kinases, and MAP kinase affects the conformation of the protein. Phosphorylation of the protein by CK2 and Cdc2 kinase impairs DNA binding of the AT-hook domains located close to the N and C termini of the protein. In contrast, phosphorylation of Ser-22 by MAP kinase does not affect protein binding to DNA and appears to have another function,e.g. modulation of protein-protein contacts. Three double mutants of the cHMGA protein, in which two residues were mutated to Cys and Trp, respectively, were constructed by means of a polymerase chain reaction. The cysteine and tryptophan residues were introduced at positions 3 and 94 ((Cys-3)cHMGA), 15 and 1 ((Cys-15)cHMGA), and 94 and 1 ((Cys-94)cHMGA; see Fig. 2). The constructs were cloned into the expression vector pET3a, and the proteins were overexpressed in BL 21 (DE3) cells as described (25Wiśniewski J.R. Schulze E. J. Biol.

The proteins were isolated by extraction with 5% (v/v) HClO4 in three freezing-thawing cycles from cultured Chironomus cells or from bacteria expressing cHMGA or its mutants (7Claus P. Schulze E. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33042-33048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cell supernatants were acidified with HCl to 0.35 m, and proteins were precipitated with 6 volumes of acetone and dried. Crude extracts were separated on a cation-exchange column (Poros SP20, 4.6 × 100 mm, PerSeptive Biosystems) using a 0.3–1 mNaCl gradient in 25 mm sodium borate, pH 9.4. To the fraction containing the mutated proteins 1 m dithiothreitol was added to the final concentration of 50 mm. After a 30-min incubation at 20 °C the samples were concentrated and desalted on Sep-Pack Plus C18 cartridges (Waters) using 70% CH3CN, 0.1% CF3COOH in H2O as the eluent. Finally, the proteins were chromatographed on a reverse-phase C18 Zorbax SB-300 column using a linear CH3CN gradient in 0.1% CF3COOH in H2O as described previously (25Wiśniewski J.R. Schulze E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10713-10719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Trp residues introduced into the mutants allowed quantification of the proteins by spectrophotometry using an absorption coefficient for tryptophan of 5,500 m−1cm−1 at 280 nm. The wild type cHMGA was quantified on Coomassie Blue R-stained polyacrylamide gels using one of the cHMGA mutants as a standard. 50 µg of the native or recombinant cHMGA protein were phosphorylated at 30 °C with 10 units of recombinant human Cdc2 kinase (New England Biolabs Inc.) for 5 h in the presence of 4 mm ATP in 8 µl of Cdc2 kinase buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether) tetraacetic acid, pH 7.5). 50 µg of purified cHMGA protein or Cdc2-phosphorylated cHMGA were phosphorylated at 37 °C with 500 units of recombinant human CK2 (New England Biolabs Inc.) for 2.5 h in the presence of 200 µm ATP in 50 µl of CK2 buffer (20 mmTris/HCl, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5). For 32P end labeling 100–150 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP were added to the reaction mixture. The reaction products were separated by reversed-phase HPLC. The cHMGA[PMAPK,PCK2] form of cHMGA was isolated from Chironomus cells as described previously (19Schwanbeck R. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol.

The reaction was carried out at 4 °C for 3–5 h, and the reaction products were separated by reverse-phase HPLC as described above. To verify that the proteins were phosphorylated and modified by acrylodan at the desired sites, we digested the proteins with trypsin in 0.1 mTris/HCl, pH 7.5 at 37 °C for 3 h. Peptides were resolved and identified by reverse-phase C18 chromatography as described previously (19Schwanbeck R. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol.

Synthetic linear poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT) DNA was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The approximate average length of this DNA was 5000 base pairs.

Briefly, 10 pmol of the radioactively end-labeled protein (10–20 kcpm) were digested at room temperature in the presence or absence of DNA in a total volume of 10 µl containing 180 mm NaCl and 10 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.2. The chemical digestions were started by sequential addition of 1 µl each of the following freshly prepared solutions: (i) 20 mm EDTA and 10 mm(NH4)2Fe(II)(SO4)2, (ii) 0.2 m sodium ascorbate, and (iii) 0.375% (v/v) H2O2. Reactions were stopped after 30 min by the addition of 3.3 µl of 4× concentrated SDS sample buffer (4% SDS, 16% glycerol, 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 6% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue). The reaction products were separated on Tricine-SDS-polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by phosphorimaging as described previously (10Frank O. Schwanbeck R. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20015-20020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Size markers were generated by limited digestion of 10 pmol of end-labeled HMG protein by trypsin, thermolysin, proteinase Arg-C, or proteinase Glu-C in a 10-µl reaction volume. Cleavage in the presence of 10 ng of trypsin or thermolysin was carried out in 180 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5 at 0 or 20 °C, respectively. The reactions with trypsin were stopped by addition of 1 µl of 0.14 mm Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone. Cleavage with proteinase Glu-C was carried out in the presence of 5 or 50 ng of enzyme in 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8 and 180 mm NaCl at 20 °C. Digestion of the protein in the presence of 20 ng or 0.5 µg of Arg-C was performed in 90 mm Tris/HCl containing 8.5 mmCaCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm EDTA, at 20 °C. Finally, the reactions were stopped by addition of 4× concentrated SDS sample buffer containing 20 mm EDTA. A mixture of native phosphoforms and the recombinant protein (molar ratio of 1:1:1), each labeled at Ser-3 by Cdc2 modification, was digested with endoproteinase Glu-C in 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8 and 180 mm NaCl at 20 °C. The protein to enzyme ratio was 50:1 (mol/mol). Reactions were terminated by addition of an equal volume of 10 m urea solution containing 5% (v/v) acetic acid, 4% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.2 mm Nα-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethane. Reaction products were separated on 15% polyacrylamide urea-acetic acid-Triton X-100 gels (30Zweidler A. Methods Cell Biol. 1978; 17: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Gels were scanned with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics), and the intensities of the bands were quantified. Mass spectra were recorded on a Finnigan MAT TSQ 700 triple-stage quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ion source. Samples were typically dissolved in a methanol/water/acetic acid (47:48:5, v/v/v) solution at a concentration of 50 pmol/µl and introduced into the electrospray needle by mechanical infusion through a microsyringe at a flow rate of 1 µl/min. A potential difference of 4.5 kV was applied between the electrospray needle. Nitrogen gas was used to evaporate the solvent from the charged droplets. At least 20 scans were averaged to obtain each spectrum. The resulting spectra were transformed using a BioWorks software package (Finnigan). Emission spectra with or without quenching were taken on an SLM-Aminco-Bowman series 2 luminescence spectrometer in 10 mm MOPS/NaOH, pH 7.2, 100 mm sodium acetate, 100 µg/ml bovine serum albumin. Measurements were corrected for buffer background, dilution, and instrumental factors. Excitation was at 391 nm. Emission spectra were recorded using 4- and 2-nm slits for excitation and emission, respectively. The titrations with KI were performed using 2- and 16-nm slits for excitation and emission (530 nm), respectively. CD spectra of 20–50 µm (Cys-94)cHMGA protein in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5 were recorded at a scanning speed of 50 nm/min from 190–280 nm in cuvettes of 1-mm path length with a Jasco 720 spectropolarimeter using a 1-nm bandwidth. For each sample three CD spectra were averaged to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Prior to each CD measurement the protein concentration of the sample in the cuvette was determined in a Cary 100 spectrophotometer (Varian Inc.) using an absorption coefficient of ε206 = 268,550m−1 cm−1. Jasco Secondary Structure Estimation software (version 1.00.00, 1998) was used to estimate the amount of secondary structure elements. Fluorescence lifetimes of acrylodan-labeled proteins were determined by time-correlated single photon counting. The excitation was at 405 nm with a pulsed diode laser (IBH, Glasgow, Scotland) operating at 1 MHz, and emission was collected using a 520-nm interference filter. The fluorescence was detected by an integrated photon detection module (TBX-04, IBH) containing a photomultiplier, pre-amplifier, and constant fraction discriminator, and its output was processed by time-correlated single photon counting. The instrument response function, measured with a LUDOX (DuPont) suspension, had a full width at half-maximum of 245 ps. Decay curves were analyzed with decay analysis software supplied by IBH. Because the decay of all samples was double exponential, number-averaged, and intensity-averaged (31Badea M.G. Brand L. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 61: 378-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), lifetimes were calculated according to Equations 1 and 2. τnum=∑αiτi/∑αi(Eq. 1) τint=∑αiτi2/∑αiτi(Eq. 2) Previously we reported that cHMGA is phosphorylated at distinct sites by Cdc2, MAP kinase, and PKC, respectively (19Schwanbeck R. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27476-27483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These conclusions were drawn from peptide mapping studies of in vivo 32P-labeled protein. Because the major fraction of the protein, having the highest electrophoretic mobility, was not detectable on autoradiograms, and a phosphatase treatment of this form did not change its mobility, we considered this form as dephosphorylated cHMGA. Unexpectedly, mass spectroscopic analysis of native cHMGA revealed that the major fraction of the protein had anM r of 10,544. Because the calculated relative mass of the cHMGA protein is 10,340, this value suggested that this protein fraction could be doubly phosphorylated and singly acetylated (Fig. 1, A and B, Table I). Minor fractions withM r of 10,383 and 10,463 could reflect protein forms that carry a single acetylation and both one acetylation and one phosphorylation, respectively (Table I). The fraction ofM r of 10,623 could reflect the protein with three phosphorylations and a single acetylation (Table I, Fig.1 B). To map the sites of modifications we isolated the main fraction of native cHMGA protein and digested the protein with trypsin. Peptide separation followed by mass analysis showed that the main subfraction of the C-terminal peptide 85–98 was doubly phosphorylated and that the N-terminal peptide 1–7 was acetylated (Table I, Fig.1 D). A small portion (<20%) of the peptide 85–98 was found in a singly phosphorylated form. Peptide 85–98 contains two serine residues in a sequence matching the consensus sequence phosphorylated by casein kinase 2; however, these two serine residues do not represent a preferred recognition site (32Meisner H. Czech M.P. Hardie G. Hanks S. The Protein Kinase Facts Book: Protein-Serine Kinases. Academic Press, London1995: 240-242Google Scholar). To determine whether CK2 can modify Ser-96 and Ser-97 residues, we incubated the cHMGA recombinant protein in the presence of the CK2 and [γ-32P]ATP. Rapid incorporation of labeled phosphate into the protein was observed (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, under the same conditions the native protein was labeled only marginally (Fig. 1 C, inset), indicating that nearly all CK2 target residues are already modified in vivo. To check whether the phosphorylated sites in vitro are identical to those modified in vivo, we digested cHMGA with trypsin and analyzed the products by HPLC. Two radioactive peptides were found (Fig. 1 E, rec. cHMGA/CK2 modified). Their retention times were identical to those of the singly and doubly phosphorylated peptide 85–98 (Fig. 1 D), indicating that Ser-96 and Ser-97 are phosphorylated by CK2 in vivo.Table IMass spectrometric analysis of the native cHMGA protein and its peptides obtained by tryptic digestionElution time1-aPeptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC (Fig. 1 D) as described under “Experimental Procedures.”ObservedM r1-bThe M r values were calculated using monoisotopic masses for peptides less than 1,000, whereas for larger peptides average values were used.Sequence positionCalculatedM r1-bThe M r values were calculated using monoisotopic masses for peptides less than 1,000, whereas for larger peptides average values were used.1-cThe values were calculated based on known protein sequence (7).Concluded posttranslational modificationmin10,38310,3401 acetylation10,463Entire protein10,3401 phosphorylation + 1 acetylation10,5441–9810,3402 phosphorylations + 1 acetylation10,62310,3403 phosphorylations + 1 acetylation10.7287.525–27288.3None385.565–68385.5None11.6614.469–74614.7None12.1527.510–14 and/or 77–81527.6None13.0843.857–64843.9None16.61057.212–241057.2None17.2801.71–7759.9Acetylation18.21653.485–981493.4Double phosphorylation19.01573.985–981493.4Single phosphorylation20.2827.632–38 and/or 33–39828.0None20.51599.239–53 or 40–541598.8None21.31599.239–53 or 40–541598.8None1-a Peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC (Fig. 1 D) as described under “Experimental Procedures.”1-b The M r values were calculated using monoisotopic masses for peptides less than 1,000, whereas for larger peptides average values were used.1-c The values were calculated based on known protein sequence (7Claus P.

Open table in a new tab Taken together, our present and previous results (19Schwanbeck R. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27476-27483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) show that the cHMGA protein has at least five distinct phosphorylation sites located at serine residues at positions 3, 22, 72, 96, and 97 (Fig.2). Phosphorylation of residues 96 and 97 appears to have a constitutive character, because more than 90% of the protein extracted from Chironomus cells is phosphorylated at both sites. The fully dephosphorylated form of the protein was rare, suggesting that in cells only minute amounts of this form are present. Up to 40% of the cHMGA population occurs in a form that is additionally phosphorylated at Ser-22 by MAP kinase (19Schwanbeck R. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27476-27483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The fraction of protein phosphorylated at Ser-3 by Cdc2 kinase is below 5% and reflects the portion of cells that are in the late G2 and M phases. Furthermore, a small fraction, usually below 2% of the cHMGA protein, was found to be modified at Ser-72. This amino acid represents a putative target site of PKC (19Schwanbeck R. Wiśniewski J.R. J.

The intact serglycin proteoglycan could play important modulatory roles in such diverse processes as hematopoiesis, inflammation, and coagulation. It is therefore of interest to understand how the synthesis of this proteoglycan is regulated in various types of hematopoietic cells. Little is known about the mechanisms that regulate either constitutive or stimulated expression of the serglycin gene. Avraham et al. (22Avraham S. Avraham H. Austen K.F. Stevens R.L. J. Biol.

A putative regulatory element was suggested by loss of nearly all activity upon truncation at −81 in the middle of an ets element, but this site was not characterized.

Biol. 1994; 14: 5975-5985Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The ets site was of interest because of the loss of promoter activity when this site in the murine gene was truncated (22Avraham S. Avraham H. Austen K.F. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 610-617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A reverse GATA-binding site (TTATC) at −357, present in the human but not in the mouse gene, is identical to a regulatory site of the megakaryocyte glycoprotein (GP) IIb gene (28Martin F.

A GATA site either alone or in combination with anets site is thought to regulate a number of genes that are restricted in expression to megakaryocytes or erythrocytes (28Martin F. Prandini M.-H.

Science. 1985; 227: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), motifs of the sequence CANNTG that bind basic helix-loop-helix proteins. The human cell lines were human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA), which have erythroid and megakaryocytic potential; CHRF-288-11 megakaryoblastic cells (donated by Dr. Michael Lieberman, University of Cincinnati) (40Fugman D.A. Witte D.P. Jones C.L. Aronow B.J. Lieberman M.A. Blood. 1990; 75: 1252-1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells (American Type Culture Collection). The murine mastocytoma cells were donated by Dr. Jeffrey Esko (41Montgomery R.I. Lidholt K. Flay N.W. Liang J. Vertel B. Lindahl U. Esko J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11327-11331Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). HEL and HL-60 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine. CHRF cells were cultured in Fischer's medium with 20% horse serum. The murine mastocytoma cells were cultured in 45% Ham's F-12 medium, 45% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum. Immortal human skin keratinocytes, HaCaT (42Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3436) Google Scholar), a gift from Dr. Norbert E. Fusenig (German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany), were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. All media contained 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Fetal bovine serum was from Hyclone (Logan, UT). All other tissue culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. The cells were maintained in the presence of 5% CO2 and 95% humidity. The pOGH human growth hormone (hGH) reporter gene system (Nichols Institute Diagnostics, San Juan Capistrano, CA) (43Selden R.F. Howie K.B. Rowe M.E. Goodman H.M. Moore D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3173-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) was used for these studies. This system has been used for studies of promoter expression of murine serglycin (22Avraham S. Avraham H. Austen K.F. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 610-617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), human GP IIb (31Block K.L. Ravid K. Phung Q.H. Poncz M. Blood. 1994; 84: 3385-3393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and PF4 (44Ravid K. Doi T. Beeler D. Kuter D.J. Rosenberg R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 6116-6127Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The reporter protein is virtually 100% secreted, and small amounts of supernatant are assayed. Ten constructs were prepared to encompass the region from −1123/+42 to −20/+42. Inserts were prepared by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with human genomic DNA as template. The primers were made in our institutional nucleic acid facility. Each primer contained 20 bases of promoter sequence based on the published sequence (7Humphries D. Nicodemus C. Schiller V. Stevens R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13558-13563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) placed 3′ to an 8-bp GC-rich anchor and a 6-bp restriction site, using Xba1 for the forward primer and BamHI for the reverse primer. The PCR products were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis. The DNA bands were eluted from the gel, digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes, and ligated into the appropriate restriction sites in the pOGH vector. The vectors were propagated inEscherichia coli JM-109 (Promega, Madison, WI) in LB medium. The vectors were purified on Qiagen columns (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) and quantitated by UV spectroscopy. The sequences were confirmed using primers that were designed from the vector sequences flanking the insert. Over the course of the work two to four different batches of each vector were used. For generation of the flt-1 promoter construct, primers were forward 5′-cgcggccgtctaga−748CTTCTAGGAAGCAGAAGACT and reverse 5′-cgcgccgcggatcc+159AGCCAGGAGACAACCACTTC (lowercase letters indicate the zipper and restriction sites, and uppercase letters indicate the coding sequence), and the vector was constructed as described above. The resulting insert included the sequence 5′-−90TGACGTCACCAGAAGGAGGTGCCGGGGTAGGAAGTG, in which the active CRE and ets sites are underlined. Mutagenesis was performed using the Altered Sites II mutagenesis system (Promega) with the pALTER EX1 vector. TheXba/BamHI restriction sites were compatible with both the native pOGH and pAlter EX1 vectors. The mutagenesis probes were 20-mers centered around the base to be modified. The mutations as well as the integrity of the entire sequence of the insert were confirmed by automated sequencing. Both the −543/+42 and the −284/+42 constructs were used for the single CRE (TGACTG → TA ACGT) and ets (CAGGAA → CAGC AA) mutations and the double mutations of the ets and CRE sites. Mutations were made within the −543/+42 construct at the −357TATC (reverse GATA) site (GATA m1 was TT TC; GATA m2 was TC TC), and the E-box site−522CATCTG was changed to CATCC G. In addition, mutations around the TATA-like region were performed exactly as described by Avraham et al. (22Avraham S. Avraham H. Austen K.F. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 610-617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar):−31TTTCTAAA to TTTCTCAA (Mut1) or TTTATAAA (mut2). Log phase cells were concentrated to 5 × 106/ml in 0.4 ml of electroporation buffer (30.8 mm NaCl, 120.7 mm KCl, 8.1 mmNa2HPO4, 1.46 mmKH2PO4, 5 mm MgCl2). Electroporation was performed in a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser in 0.4-cm Gene Pulser cuvettes. 50 μg of plasmid DNA was added to the cells. The cells were incubated for 2–5 days in biotin-free medium. In experiments in which the effects of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Sigma) (1.6 μm) or dbcAMP (1 mm) (Sigma) were tested, the electroporated cells from a single cuvette were divided into equal aliquots, and the test reagents were added immediately to the wells, so that we would be assured of equivalent transfection efficiency in samples that were being compared with each other. Each of these experiments was set up in duplicate. Background values were obtained from the medium of cells transfected with the pOGH promoterless vector, which gave no expression of hGH over control culture medium. For an external standard, we used a pOGH vector that had been prepared with the cytomegalovirus promoter (pCMVhGH), which was kindly donated by Dr. Jaime Caro. The pCMVhGH vector also provided a standard for measuring the response of our serglycin constructs to PMA. In the data presented, all constructs shown were used in each experiment. We also performed experiments across all three cell lines with the same preparations of vectors to eliminate random variations in vector preparations as a cause for observed differences between cell lines. Our data are presented as the activity of any given construct relative to the −543/+24 construct within any given experiment. In some experiments, pCMVSEAP or pSV40SEAP (Tropix, Bedford, MA), which have secretable placental alkaline phosphatase as a reporter, were used as internal standards. The relative activity profile of the serglycin promoter constructs was essentially unchanged in the presence of pCMVSEAP, but the amount of hGH activity was much greater in the presence of this plasmid. We cannot explain the reason for this. pSV40SEAP had a smaller effect on serglycin promoter expression. After the appropriate incubation times to ensure maximal expression (2 days for HEL, 4–5 days for CHRF and HL-60; the pattern of expression of the reporter gene for HEL cells was unchanged with longer incubations), the cells were pelleted, and aliquots of the culture medium were removed for radioimmunoassay of the secreted hGH as directed by the supplier. We found that less than 1% of the hGH remained in the cell pellet. Secretion of the SEAP reporter protein was quantitated in 30 μl of supernatant by a luminescence assay (Tropix) using a tube luminometer (Monolight 2010, Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). The activity profiles obtained from comparison of the hGH measurements to the secretable internal control were consistent with those obtained with the external control or the relative patterns of expression of the constructs. Cells were incubated with either PMA (1.6 μm), dbcAMP (1 mm), or dexamethasone (10−5m) for 72 h. RNA was extracted from the cells with the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Northern blots were run on 1.2% agarose gels containing formaldehyde and ethidium bromide, and electrophoresis was carried out in MOPS buffer (45Schick B.P. Thornton R.D. Leukemia ( Baltimore ). 1993; 7: 1955-1959PubMed Google Scholar). The RNA was transferred to Hybond nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 20× saline sodium citrate (3 m NaCl, 0.3 msodium citrate). Prehybridization and hybridization were carried out at 50 °C as described (45Schick B.P. Thornton R.D. Leukemia ( Baltimore ). 1993; 7: 1955-1959PubMed Google Scholar) using a buffer containing 50% formamide, 5× Denhardt's solution, 5× SSPE (sodium phosphate, EDTA, NaCl), 0.1% sodium dodecylsulfate, 0.1 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 0.3 mg/ml yeast tRNA. The probe was labeled with [32P]dCTP (New England Nuclear) by random hexamer priming using a 271-bp fragment derived by reverse transcriptase-PCR from HEL cell RNA as a template. The primers were 5′-AATGCAGTCGGCTTGTCCTG and 5′-GCCTGATCCAGAGTAGTCCT, spanning nucleotides 73–344, based on the cDNA sequence published by Nicodemus et al. (23Nicodemus C.F. Avraham S. Austen K.F. Purdy S. Jablonski J. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5889-5896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The probe identified the expected 1.3-kb band on Northern blots. Nuclear extracts were prepared essentially by the method of Dignam et al. (46Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9145) Google Scholar). The integrity of the extracts was tested by performing EMSAs as described below with consensus oligonucleotides for universal transcription factors such as TFIID, Sp1, and AP-1 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Oligonucleotides for the EMSAs were generally 24-mers produced on a nucleotide synthesizer at our institutional nucleic acid facility. The sequences listed below and their complementary strands were hybridized, and efficiency of hybridization was monitored on 4% agarose gels run in Tris acetate/EDTA buffer. The double-stranded probes were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (New England Nuclear) and polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and purified on Sephadex G-25 spin columns. The forward sequences, mutations, and other reagents for investigation of each site were as follows. ets was 5′-−89CTATTTGTTCAGGAA ATTGTG, andets mutant was 5′-−89CTATTTGTTCAGC AAATTGTG (the same mutation used for the transfection studies). For competition for binding to the ets oligonucleotide, an oligonucleotide that contained the CAGGAA ets site of the rat GP IIb gene (29Block K.L. Shou Y. Poncz M. Blood. 1996; 88: 2071-2080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but had no other homology with our probe was donated by Dr. Mortimer Poncz, and an anti ets-1/ets-2 antibody and a peptide containing the amino acid sequence that binds to theets-1 site were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). For CRE, 5′-−78GAAATTGTGACGTGTGTTCTGG was used for the EMSA. The competitor was the CREB consensus binding site, 5′-AGAGATTGCCTGACGTCA GAGAGCTAG (45Schick B.P. Thornton R.D. Leukemia ( Baltimore ). 1993; 7: 1955-1959PubMed Google Scholar). DNA-protein binding reactions were carried out in 20 μl of total volume using the buffer described by Uzan et al. (48Uzan G. Prenant M. Prandini M.-H. Martin F. Marguerie G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8932-8939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with 3 μg of nuclear extract, 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 100,000 dpm labeled probe. Up to 15 pmol of unlabeled competitor probes or 1–2 μl of antisera were added to the reactions as desired. All components except the probe were incubated together for 10 min at room temperature, the probe was added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 20 min. The samples were loaded onto a nondenaturing polyacrylamide/bisacrylamide gel consisting of one-tenth the total gel volume 5× Tris borate/EDTA, 5% acrylamide, 0.25% bisacrylamide, and 6.25% glycerol. The gel was run at 200 V for 2 h at 4 °C. The gels were dried under vacuum and autoradiographed with Fuji film. The reactions were performed as described for the EMSA, but the samples were exposed to UV light using an inverted light box suspended over the open tubes for 30 min. The samples were then run on 20-cm SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels. Prestained molecular weight standards were from Bio-Rad. The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. Assays were performed with HEL, CHRF 288-11, and HL60 cells. Immortal human skin keratinocytes, HaCaT (42Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3436) Google Scholar), were used as a control, because serglycin expression was not detected by reverse transcriptase-PCR of HaCaT RNA. Preparation of nuclei from the cells was performed essentially as described (49Jucker M. Roebroek A.J. Mautner J. Koch K. Eick D. Diehl V. Van de Ven W.J. Tesch H. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 943-952PubMed Google Scholar), except that Igepal CA-630 was used as detergent instead of Nonidet P-40. Approximately 3 × 108 cells were harvested and washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were harvested again, resuspended in 50 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (40 mmpotassium chloride, 10 mm sodium chloride, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% Igepal CA-630), kept on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged at 400 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cells were resuspended, and lysis buffer treatment was repeated. Subsequently, the nuclei were resuspended in lysis buffer, and the nuclear titer was adjusted to ∼2 × 107 nuclei/ml. Aliquots of 0.5 ml were distributed in tubes, and to each sample an appropriate amount of DNase I buffer (1 mm magnesium chloride, 5 mmcalcium chloride) up to 40 μl was added. The nuclei were incubated at 4 °C with increasing amounts of DNase I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) up to 100 units for 4 min. The reactions were stopped by adding 60 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, and the DNA was isolated by proteinase K-SDS digestion and potassium acetate precipitation followed by RNase A digestion, phenol-chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation. The final purified DNA pellet was dissolved in Tris/EDTA, pH 7.5. DNAs (5 μg/sample) were digested with HindIII, and the DNA fragments were separated in 1% agarose gels by electrophoresis, transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond N+; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized at 65 °C overnight in a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1m NaCl, 1% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate (Fisher), 0.05 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and the H106 probe radiolabeled by the random priming method (RadPrime DNA Labeling System by Life Technologies, Inc.). The membrane was washed once with 2× saline sodium citrate at room temperature for 5 min, followed by 0.5X saline sodium citrate at 65 °C for 3–5 min.
