https://openalex.org/W3202007017,"Vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have shown high efficacy, but immunocompromised participants were excluded from controlled clinical trials. In this study, we compared immune responses to the BNT162b2 mRNA Coronavirus Disease 2019 vaccine in patients with solid tumors (n = 53) who were on active cytotoxic anti-cancer therapy to a control cohort of participants without cancer (n = 50). Neutralizing antibodies were detected in 67% of patients with cancer after the first immunization, followed by a threefold increase in median titers after the second dose. Similar patterns were observed for spike protein-specific serum antibodies and T cells, but the magnitude of each of these responses was diminished relative to the control cohort. In most patients with cancer, we detected spike receptor-binding domain and other S1-specific memory B cell subsets as potential predictors of anamnestic responses to additional immunizations. We therefore initiated a phase 1 trial for 20 cancer cohort participants of a third vaccine dose of BNT162b2 ( NCT04936997 ); primary outcomes were immune responses, with a secondary outcome of safety. At 1 week after a third immunization, 16 participants demonstrated a median threefold increase in neutralizing antibody responses, but no improvement was observed in T cell responses. Adverse events were mild. These results suggest that a third dose of BNT162b2 is safe, improves humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and could be immunologically beneficial for patients with cancer on active chemotherapy. After two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine, virus-specific antibodies and T cells were reduced in patients with solid tumors as compared to individuals without cancer, but neutralizing antibodies increased in most patients who received a third vaccine dose."
https://openalex.org/W3203585646,"Single-cell RNA sequencing has revealed extensive transcriptional cell state diversity in cancer, often observed independently of genetic heterogeneity, raising the central question of how malignant cell states are encoded epigenetically. To address this, here we performed multiomics single-cell profiling—integrating DNA methylation, transcriptome and genotype within the same cells—of diffuse gliomas, tumors characterized by defined transcriptional cell state diversity. Direct comparison of the epigenetic profiles of distinct cell states revealed key switches for state transitions recapitulating neurodevelopmental trajectories and highlighted dysregulated epigenetic mechanisms underlying gliomagenesis. We further developed a quantitative framework to directly measure cell state heritability and transition dynamics based on high-resolution lineage trees in human samples. We demonstrated heritability of malignant cell states, with key differences in hierarchal and plastic cell state architectures in IDH-mutant glioma versus IDH-wild-type glioblastoma, respectively. This work provides a framework anchoring transcriptional cancer cell states in their epigenetic encoding, inheritance and transition dynamics. Multimodal DNA methylation and transcriptome profiling of single glioma cells links tumor cell transcriptional states to epigenetics via interaction with PRC2 and shows that these states are heritable and important for tumor plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W3202738945,"Glioma intratumoral heterogeneity enables adaptation to challenging microenvironments and contributes to therapeutic resistance. We integrated 914 single-cell DNA methylomes, 55,284 single-cell transcriptomes and bulk multi-omic profiles across 11 adult IDH mutant or IDH wild-type gliomas to delineate sources of intratumoral heterogeneity. We showed that local DNA methylation disorder is associated with cell-cell DNA methylation differences, is elevated in more aggressive tumors, links with transcriptional disruption and is altered during the environmental stress response. Glioma cells under in vitro hypoxic and irradiation stress increased local DNA methylation disorder and shifted cell states. We identified a positive association between genetic and epigenetic instability that was supported in bulk longitudinally collected DNA methylation data. Increased DNA methylation disorder associated with accelerated disease progression and recurrently selected DNA methylation changes were enriched for environmental stress response pathways. Our work identified an epigenetically facilitated adaptive stress response process and highlights the importance of epigenetic heterogeneity in shaping therapeutic outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3202183913,"Reprogramming brain-resident glial cells into clinically relevant induced neurons (iNs) is an emerging strategy toward replacing lost neurons and restoring lost brain functions. A fundamental question is now whether iNs can promote functional recovery in pathological contexts. We addressed this question in the context of therapy-resistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), which is associated with hippocampal seizures and degeneration of hippocampal GABAergic interneurons. Using a MTLE mouse model, we show that retrovirus-driven expression of Ascl1 and Dlx2 in reactive hippocampal glia in situ, or in cortical astroglia grafted in the epileptic hippocampus, causes efficient reprogramming into iNs exhibiting hallmarks of interneurons. These induced interneurons functionally integrate into epileptic networks and establish GABAergic synapses onto dentate granule cells. MTLE mice with GABAergic iNs show a significant reduction in both the number and cumulative duration of spontaneous recurrent hippocampal seizures. Thus glia-to-neuron reprogramming is a potential disease-modifying strategy to reduce seizures in therapy-resistant epilepsy."
https://openalex.org/W3201662917,"The large diversity of neuron types provides the means by which cortical circuits perform complex operations. Neuron can be described by biophysical and molecular characteristics, afferent inputs, and neuron targets. To quantify, visualize, and standardize those features, we developed the open-source, MATLAB-based framework CellExplorer. It consists of three components: a processing module, a flexible data structure, and a powerful graphical interface. The processing module calculates standardized physiological metrics, performs neuron-type classification, finds putative monosynaptic connections, and saves them to a standardized, yet flexible, machine-readable format. The graphical interface makes it possible to explore the computed features at the speed of a mouse click. The framework allows users to process, curate, and relate their data to a growing public collection of neurons. CellExplorer can link genetically identified cell types to physiological properties of neurons collected across laboratories and potentially lead to interlaboratory standards of single-cell metrics."
https://openalex.org/W3204072168,"Abstract How two subgenomes in allo-tetraploids adapt to coexistence and coordinate through structure and expression evolution requires extensive studies. In the present study, we report an improved genome assembly of allo-tetraploid common carp, an updated genome annotation of allo-tetraploid goldfish and the chromosome-scale assemblies of a progenitor-like diploid Puntius tetrazona and an outgroup diploid Paracanthobrama guichenoti . Parallel subgenome structure evolution in the allo-tetraploids was featured with equivalent chromosome components, higher protein identities, similar transposon divergence and contents, homoeologous exchanges, better synteny level, strong sequence compensation and symmetric purifying selection. Furthermore, we observed subgenome expression divergence processes in the allo-tetraploids, including inter-/intrasubgenome trans- splicing events, expression dominance, decreased expression levels, dosage compensation, stronger expression correlation, dynamic functionalization and balancing of differential expression. The potential disorders introduced by different progenitors in the allo-tetraploids were hypothesized to be alleviated by increasing structural homogeneity and performing versatile expression processes. Resequencing three common carp strains revealed two major ecotypes and uncovered candidate genes relevant to growth and survival rate."
https://openalex.org/W3203066263,"Back and neck pain are significant healthcare burdens that are commonly associated with pathologies of the intervertebral disc (IVD). The poor understanding of the cellular heterogeneity within the IVD makes it difficult to develop regenerative IVD therapies. To address this gap, we developed an atlas of bovine (Bos taurus) caudal IVDs using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). Unsupervised clustering resolved 15 unique clusters, which we grouped into the following annotated partitions: nucleus pulposus (NP), outer annulus fibrosus (oAF), inner AF (iAF), notochord, muscle, endothelial, and immune cells. Analyzing the pooled gene expression profiles of the NP, oAF, and iAF partitions allowed us to identify novel markers for NP (CP, S100B, H2AC18, SNORC, CRELD2, PDIA4, DNAJC3, CHCHD7, and RCN2), oAF (IGFBP6, CTSK, LGALS1, and CCN3), and iAF (MGP, COMP, SPP1, GSN, SOD2, DCN, FN1, TIMP3, WDR73, and GAL) cells. Network analysis on subpopulations of NP and oAF cells determined that clusters NP1, NP2, NP4, and oAF1 displayed gene expression profiles consistent with cell survival, suggesting these clusters may uniquely support viability under the physiological stresses of the IVD. Clusters NP3, NP5, oAF2, and oAF3 expressed various extracellular matrix (ECM)-associated genes, suggesting their role in maintaining IVD structure. Lastly, transcriptional entropy and pseudotime analyses found that clusters NP3 and NP1 had the most stem-like gene expression signatures of the NP partition, implying these clusters may contain IVD progenitor cells. Overall, results highlight cell type diversity within the IVD, and these novel cell phenotypes may enhance our understanding of IVD development, homeostasis, degeneration, and regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3202509667,"Background COVID-19 has triggered an avalanche of research publications, the various aspects of which need to be assessed. The objective of this study is to determine the scientific community’s response patterns to COVID-19 through a bibliometric analysis of the time-trends, global contribution, international collaboration, open-access provision, science domains of focus, and the behavior of journals. Methods The bibliographic records on COVID-19 literature were retrieved from both PubMed and Scopus. The period for searching was set from November 1, 2019, to April 15, 2021. The bibliographic data were coupled with COVID-19 incidence to explore possible association, as well as World Bank indicators and classification of economies. Results A total of 159132 records were included in the study. Following the escalation of incidences of COVID-19 in late 2020 and early 2021, the monthly publication count made a new peak in March 2021 at 20505. Overall, 125155 (78.6%) were national, 22548 (14.2%) were bi-national, and 11429 (7.2%) were multi-national. Low-income countries with 928 (66.8%) international publications had the highest percentage of international. The open-access provision decreased from 85.5% in February 2020 to 62.0% in April 2021. As many as 82841 (70.8%) publications were related to health sciences, followed by life sciences 27031 (23.1%), social sciences 20291 (17.3%), and physical sciences 15141 (12.9%). The top three medical subjects in publications were general internal medicine, public health, and infectious diseases with 28.9%, 18.3%, and 12.6% of medical publications, respectively. Conclusions The association between the incidence and publication count indicated the scientific community’s interest in the ongoing situation and timely response to it. Only one-fifth of publications resulted from international collaboration, which might lead to redundancy without adding significant value. Our study underscores the necessity of policies for attraction of international collaboration and direction of vital funds toward domains of higher priority."
https://openalex.org/W3202916439,"The endophytic bacterium Burkholderia contaminans NZ was isolated from jute, which is an important fiber-producing plant. This bacterium exhibits significant growth promotion activity in in vivo pot experiments, and like other plant growth-promoting (PGP) bacteria fixes nitrogen, produces indole acetic acid (IAA), siderophore, and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase activity. B. contaminans NZ is considered to exert a promising growth inhibitory effect on Macrophomina phaseolina, a phytopathogen responsible for infecting hundreds of crops worldwide. This study aimed to identify the possibility of B. contaminans NZ as a safe biocontrol agent and assess its effectiveness in suppressing phytopathogenic fungi, especially M. phaseolina. Co-culture of M. phaseolina with B. contaminans NZ on both solid and liquid media revealed appreciable growth suppression of M. phaseolina and its chromogenic aberration in liquid culture. Genome mining of B. contaminans NZ using NaPDoS and antiSMASH revealed gene clusters that displayed 100% similarity for cytotoxic and antifungal substances, such as pyrrolnitrin. GC-MS analysis of B. contaminans NZ culture extracts revealed various bioactive compounds, including catechol; 9,10-dihydro-12'-hydroxy-2'-methyl-5'-(phenylmethyl)- ergotaman 3',6',18-trione; 2,3-dihydro-3,5- dihydroxy-6-methyl-4H-pyran-4-one; 1-(1,6-Dioxooctadecyl)- pyrrolidine; 9-Octadecenamide; and 2- methoxy- phenol. These compounds reportedly exhibit tyrosinase inhibitory, antifungal, and antibiotic activities. Using a more targeted approach, an RP-HPLC purified fraction was analyzed by LC-MS, confirming the existence of pyrrolnitrin in the B. contaminans NZ extract. Secondary metabolites, such as catechol and ergotaman, have been predicted to inhibit melanin synthesis in M. phaseolina. Thus, B. contaminans NZ appears to inhibit phytopathogens by apparently impairing melanin synthesis and other potential biochemical pathways, exhibiting considerable fungistatic activity."
https://openalex.org/W3204382991,"Due to the currently ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it is strongly recommended to wear facemasks to minimize transmission risk. Wearing a facemask may have the potential to increase dyspnea and worsen cardiopulmonary parameters during exercise; however, research-based evidence is lacking. We investigated the hypothesis that wearing facemasks affects the sensation of dyspnea, pulse rate, and percutaneous arterial oxygen saturation during exercise. Healthy adults (15 men, 9 women) underwent a progressive treadmill test under 3 conditions in randomized order: wearing a surgical facemask, cloth facemask, or no facemask. Experiment was carried out once daily under each condition, for a total of 3 days. Each subject first sat on a chair for 30 minutes, then walked on a treadmill according to a Bruce protocol that was modified by us. The experiment was discontinued when the subject’s pulse rate exceeded 174 beats/min. After discontinuation, the subject immediately sat on a chair and was allowed to rest for 10 minutes. Subjects were required to rate their levels of dyspnea perception on a numerical scale. Pulse rate and percutaneous arterial oxygen saturation were continuously monitored with a pulse oximeter. These parameters were recorded in each trial every 3 minutes after the start of the exercise; the point of discontinuation; and 5 and 10 minutes after discontinuation. The following findings were obtained. Wearing a facemask does not worsen dyspnea during light to moderate exercise but worsens dyspnea during vigorous exercise. Wearing a cloth facemask increases dyspnea more than wearing a surgical facemask during exercise and increases pulse rate during vigorous exercise, but it does not increase pulse rate during less vigorous exercise. Wearing a surgical facemask does not increase pulse rate at any load level. Lastly, wearing a facemask does not affect percutaneous arterial oxygen saturation during exercise at any load level regardless of facemask type."
https://openalex.org/W3204646187,"Background Few studies have quantified aerosol concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 in hospitals and long-term care homes, and fewer still have examined samples for viability. This information is needed to clarify transmission risks beyond close contact. Methods We deployed particulate air samplers in rooms with COVID-19 positive patients in hospital ward and ICU rooms, rooms in long-term care homes experiencing outbreaks, and a correctional facility experiencing an outbreak. Samplers were placed between 2 and 3 meters from the patient. Aerosol (small liquid particles suspended in air) samples were collected onto gelatin filters by Ultrasonic Personal Air Samplers (UPAS) fitted with &lt;2.5μm (micrometer) and &lt;10 μm size-selective inlets operated for 16 hours (total 1.92m 3 ), and with a Coriolis Biosampler over 10 minutes (total 1.5m 3 ). Samples were assayed for viable SARS-CoV-2 virus and for the viral genome by multiplex PCR using the E and N protein target sequences. We validated the sampling methods by inoculating gelatin filters with viable vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and with three concentrations of viable SARS-CoV-2, operating personal samplers for 16hrs, and quantifying viable virus recovery by TCID 50 assay. Results In total, 138 samples were collected from 99 rooms. RNA samples were positive in 9.1% (6/66) of samples obtained with the UPAS 2.5μm samplers, 13.5% (7/52) with the UPAS 10μm samplers, and 10.0% (2/20) samples obtained with the Coriolis samplers. Culturable virus was not recovered in any samples. Viral RNA was detected in 15.1% of the rooms sampled. There was no significant difference in viral RNA recovery between the different room locations or samplers. Method development experiments indicated minimal loss of SARS-CoV-2 viability via the personal air sampler operation."
https://openalex.org/W3204806359,"Branched-chain amino acids (primarily isoleucine) are important regulators of virulence and are converted to precursor molecules used to initiate fatty acid synthesis in Staphylococcus aureus. Defining how bacteria control their membrane phospholipid composition is key to understanding their adaptation to different environments. Here, we used mass tracing experiments to show that extracellular isoleucine is preferentially metabolized by the branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase complex, in contrast to valine, which is not efficiently converted to isobutyryl-CoA. This selectivity creates a ratio of anteiso:iso C5-CoAs that matches the anteiso:iso ratio in membrane phospholipids, indicating indiscriminate utilization of these precursors by the initiation condensing enzyme FabH. Lipidomics analysis showed that removal of isoleucine and leucine from the medium led to the replacement of phospholipid molecular species containing anteiso/iso 17- and 19-carbon fatty acids with 18- and 20-carbon straight-chain fatty acids. This compositional change is driven by an increase in the acetyl-CoA:C5-CoA ratio, enhancing the utilization of acetyl-CoA by FabH. The acyl carrier protein (ACP) pool normally consists of odd carbon acyl-ACP intermediates, but when branched-chain amino acids are absent from the environment, there was a large increase in even carbon acyl-ACP pathway intermediates. The high substrate selectivity of PlsC ensures that, in the presence or the absence of extracellular Ile/Leu, the 2-position is occupied by a branched-chain 15-carbon fatty acid. These metabolomic measurements show how the metabolism of isoleucine and leucine, rather than the selectivity of FabH, control the structure of membrane phospholipids."
https://openalex.org/W3201956974,"Caspases are a family of cysteinyl proteases that control programmed cell death and maintain homeostasis in multicellular organisms. The caspase family is an excellent model to study protein evolution because all caspases are produced as zymogens (procaspases [PCPs]) that must be activated to gain full activity; the protein structures are conserved through hundreds of millions of years of evolution; and some allosteric features arose with the early ancestor, whereas others are more recent evolutionary events. The apoptotic caspases evolved from a common ancestor (CA) into two distinct subfamilies: monomers (initiator caspases) or dimers (effector caspases). Differences in activation mechanisms of the two subfamilies, and their oligomeric forms, play a central role in the regulation of apoptosis. Here, we examine changes in the folding landscape by characterizing human effector caspases and their CA. The results show that the effector caspases unfold by a minimum three-state equilibrium model at pH 7.5, where the native dimer is in equilibrium with a partially folded monomeric (PCP-7, CA) or dimeric (PCP-6) intermediate. In comparison, the unfolding pathway of PCP-3 contains both oligomeric forms of the intermediate. Overall, the data show that the folding landscape was first established with the CA and was retained for >650 million years. Partially folded monomeric or dimeric intermediates in the ancestral ensemble provide mechanisms for evolutionary changes that affect stability of extant caspases. The conserved folding landscape allows for the fine-tuning of enzyme stability in a species-dependent manner while retaining the overall caspase–hemoglobinase fold.

While folding landscapes of proteins have been studied for decades (1Doyle C.M. Rumfeldt J.A. Broom H.R. Broom A. Stathopulos P.B. Vassall K.A. Almey J.J. Meiering E.M.

Energy landscapes for proteins: From single funnels to multifunctional systems.Adv. Theor. Simulations. 2019; 2: 1800175Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar), many studies focused on small monomeric proteins or dimers with simple folding landscapes (4Kentsis A. Gindin T. Mezei M. Osman R.

Comparison of the folding processes of T. thermophilus and E. coli ribonucleases H.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Studies of monomeric proteins have provided a wealth of information concerning the principles that govern intramolecular interactions during folding, but they do not consider intermolecular interactions provided by the interfaces of multimeric proteins (6Milam S.L. Clark A.C. Folding and assembly kinetics of procaspase-3.Protein Sci. 2009; 18: 2500-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For some dimers, subunit interactions in the dimer interface lead to more complicated folding pathways when compared with simple two-state behavior involving only native dimer (N2) and unfolded monomers (U) (7Yao J. Wang J. Neither two-state nor three-state: Dimerization of lambda cro repressor.J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2015; 6: 2022-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 8Zheng W. Schafer N.P. Davtyan A.

Moreover, relatively little is known about the evolution of dimeric proteins compared with monomeric proteins (2Rumfeldt J.A.O. Galvagnion C. Vassall K.A. Meiering E.M. Conformational stability and folding mechanisms of dimeric proteins.Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2008; 98: 61-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 9Han J.H. Batey S. Nickson A.A. Teichmann S.A. Clarke J. The folding and evolution of multidomain proteins.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), although two-thirds of proteins form a multimeric assembly (10Lynch M. The evolution of multimeric protein assemblages.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2012; 29: 1353-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 11Lynch M. Evolutionary diversification of the multimeric states of proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2013; 110: E2821-E2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, an understanding of the role of oligomerization in the folding landscape of a polypeptide sequence should include a consideration of the interface in assembly (12Hashimoto K. Panchenko A.R. Mechanisms of protein oligomerization, the critical role of insertions and deletions in maintaining different oligomeric states.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2010; 107: 20352-20357Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In this regard, the caspase family of proteases is an attractive model system to study the evolution of protein folding landscapes. Caspases are a family of cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteases that initiate and execute programmed cell death and maintain cellular homeostasis in metazoans (13Clark A.C. Caspase allostery and conformational selection.Chem. Rev. 2016; 116: 6666-6706Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). There are two broad categories of caspases based on their function: inflammatory caspases (caspase-1, caspase-4, and caspase-5) and apoptotic caspases (Fig. 1A). The latter is further subdivided into two groups based on their entry into the apoptotic cascade. Initiator caspases (caspase-2, caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-10) act upstream and activate downstream effector procaspases (PCPs) (caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-7), which execute the cell death function (14MacKenzie S.H. Clark A.C. Death by caspase dimerization.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2012; 747: 55-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, the caspase–hemoglobinase fold has been conserved for >650 million years (15Grinshpon R.D. Shrestha S. Titus-McQuillan J. Hamilton P.T. Swartz P.D. Clark A.C. Resurrection of ancestral effector caspases identifies novel networks for evolution of substrate specificity.Biochem. J. 2019; 476: 3475-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), so the caspase family provides opportunities to examine the folding of monomers as well as changes to the folding landscape that resulted in oligomerization. As described by Aravind and Koonin (16Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Classification of the caspase–hemoglobinase fold: Detection of new families and implications for the origin of the eukaryotic separins.Proteins. 2002; 46: 355-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), the term “caspase–hemoglobinase” refers to the conserved fold found in caspases, legumains (or hemoglobinases), paracaspases, metacaspases, and gingipains. More recently, evolutionary biochemists have used a new approach to study protein folding by examining the evolution of protein structure and function. Ancestral reconstruction methods enable one to use vertical comparisons (comparing ancestral to modern enzymes) as well as horizontal comparisons (comparing modern enzymes from multiple species) (17Lim S.A. Marqusee S. The burst-phase folding intermediate of ribonuclease H changes conformation over evolutionary history.Biopolymers. 2018; 109e23086Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 18Lim S.A.

Thornton J.W. Origin of complexity in haemoglobin evolution.Nature. 2020; 581: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The results of such studies potentially show the mechanisms by which changes in protein sequence have caused shifts in structure and function (20Harms M.J. Thornton J.W. Evolutionary biochemistry: Revealing the historical and physical causes of protein properties.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2013; 14: 559-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The sequence determinants of protein structure and function and substitutions revealed by the evolutionary analysis in common evolutionary nodes can then be introduced singly or in combination into ancestral backgrounds. Ultimately, by examining the ancestral reconstructions and changes that occur throughout evolution of the protein, one can determine the effects of historical mutations on protein structure, function, and physical properties (19Pillai A.S. Chandler S.A. Liu Y. Signore A.V. Cortez-Romero C.R. Benesch J.L.P. Laganowsky A. Storz J.F. Hochberg G.K.A. Thornton J.W. Origin of complexity in haemoglobin evolution.Nature. 2020; 581: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We note that the data presented here describe the folding landscape of the effector caspases, and changes that occurred from the common ancestor (CA) to extant enzymes, rather than the phylogenetic relationship. In contrast, the phylogenetic tree in Figure 1A shows the evolutionary events leading to each caspase, and the lines in the figure are meant only to illustrate the caspase subfamilies. Accordingly, the line lengths in Figure 1A do not represent evolutionary time lines. The effector and initiator caspases evolved by gene duplication and divergence from a CA more than 650 million years ago (Fig. 1A) (15Grinshpon R.D. Shrestha S. Titus-McQuillan J. Hamilton P.T. Swartz P.D. Clark A.C. Resurrection of ancestral effector caspases identifies novel networks for evolution of substrate specificity.Biochem. J. 2019; 476: 3475-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The CA provided a scaffold for the modern caspases to acquire distinct properties, such as formation of oligomers, changes in stability, enzyme specificity, and allosteric regulation (15Grinshpon R.D. Shrestha S. Titus-McQuillan J. Hamilton P.T. Swartz P.D. Clark A.C. Resurrection of ancestral effector caspases identifies novel networks for evolution of substrate specificity.Biochem. J. 2019; 476: 3475-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). All caspases are produced in the cell as inactive zymogens that must be activated during the apoptotic cascade. In general, initiator PCPs are stable monomers, and dimerization is sufficient for activation, whereas effector PCPs are stable, yet inactive dimers, and are activated via cleavage by initiator caspases (Fig. 1B). The oligomeric form of the zymogen and its activation mechanism is key to regulating apoptosis (13Clark A.C. Caspase allostery and conformational selection.Chem. Rev. 2016; 116: 6666-6706Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 15Grinshpon R.D. Shrestha S. Titus-McQuillan J. Hamilton P.T. Swartz P.D. Clark A.C.

While the amino acid sequence identity is low between caspase subfamilies (∼40%) (15Grinshpon R.D. Shrestha S. Titus-McQuillan J. Hamilton P.T. Swartz P.D. Clark A.C.

The structure of the PCP monomer is characterized by a six-stranded β-sheet core with several α-helices on the surface (6Milam S.L. Clark A.C. Folding and assembly kinetics of procaspase-3.Protein Sci. 2009; 18: 2500-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Each monomer of the PCP homodimer consists of approximately 300 amino acids organized into an N-terminal prodomain followed by a protease domain. The protease domain is further divided into large and small subunits that are connected by a short intersubunit linker (Fig. 1B). Previously, we showed that the human PCP-3 dimer assembles by a four-state equilibrium mechanism in which the unfolded protein partially folds to a monomeric intermediate. Following dimerization of the intermediate, the protein undergoes a conformational change to form the native dimer (2U ⇄ 2I ⇄ I2 ⇄ N2) (27Bose K. Clark A.C. Dimeric procaspase-3 unfolds via a four-state equilibrium process.Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14236-14242Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Dimerization results in a substantial increase in conformational free energy, ΔG°conf, for the dimer (∼25 kcal mol−1) versus the monomer (∼7 kcal mol−1) at 25 °C (27Bose K. Clark A.C. Dimeric procaspase-3 unfolds via a four-state equilibrium process.Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14236-14242Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Furthermore, by examining the changes in ΔG°conf versus pH, we showed that the PCP-3 dimer dissociates at lower pH because of a pair of histidine residues that contribute to salt bridges across the dimer interface (28Bose K. Clark A.C. pH effects on the stability and dimerization of procaspase-3.Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 24-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, our previous data showed that the per-residue contribution to the total conformational free energy of the dimer (ΔG°conf) increases from 0.025 kcal/mol/amino acid to 0.044 kcal/mol/amino acid (27Bose K. Clark A.C. Dimeric procaspase-3 unfolds via a four-state equilibrium process.Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14236-14242Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 28Bose K. Clark A.C. pH effects on the stability and dimerization of procaspase-3.Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 24-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, because human PCP-3 is the only caspase in which the folding properties have been examined, the evolutionary trajectories that resulted in dimer formation remain unknown. We recently used ancestral protein reconstruction techniques to resurrect the CA of the caspase-3/6/7 subfamily (29Merkl R. Sterner R. Reconstruction of ancestral enzymes.Perspect. Sci. 2016; 9: 17-23Crossref Google Scholar). In those studies, we examined the robustness of reconstruction methods by resurrecting two sequences (called AncCP-Ef1 and AncCP-Ef2) from the pool of possible sequences of CA, and we characterized the proteins biochemically and structurally (15Grinshpon R.D. Shrestha S. Titus-McQuillan J. Hamilton P.T. Swartz P.D. Clark A.C. Resurrection of ancestral effector caspases identifies novel networks for evolution of substrate specificity.Biochem. J. 2019; 476: 3475-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Here, we examine the evolution of the caspase folding landscape using the ancestral reconstruction AncCP-Ef2 (referred to here as PCP-CA). The results are compared with those for extant human PCP-6 and PCP-7 as well as our previous studies for PCP-3 (27Bose K. Clark A.C. Dimeric procaspase-3 unfolds via a four-state equilibrium process.Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14236-14242Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 28Bose K. Clark A.C. pH effects on the stability and dimerization of procaspase-3.Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 24-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We examined urea-induced equilibrium unfolding over a broad pH range to compare the folding pathways of all three effector caspase subfamilies. The data show that the caspase folding landscape was first established and then retained for >650 million years. The CA PCP-CA forms a weak dimer, and the dimer was stabilized early in the evolution of the subfamily. Of the three extant human effector caspases, caspase-6 is the most stable, whereas caspase-7 is the least stable. The folding landscape of PCP-7 is more similar to that of the CA, which is consistent with previous phylogenetic data that show caspase-7 is closest to the CA (15Grinshpon R.D. Shrestha S. Titus-McQuillan J. Hamilton P.T. Swartz P.D. Clark A.C. Resurrection of ancestral effector caspases identifies novel networks for evolution of substrate specificity.Biochem. J. 2019; 476: 3475-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In PCP-3 and PCP-6, folding intermediates were stabilized later in evolution. A protomer of PCP-6, PCP-7, and PCP-CA consists of 293, 303, and 275 amino acids, respectively (Table S1). Under some conditions, such as the high protein concentrations found in heterologous expression systems, effector caspase activation is autocatalytic. In order to prevent autoproteolysis during expression in Escherichia coli, we substituted the active site cysteine with a serine residue for our equilibrium unfolding studies, as described previously for PCP-3 (27Bose K. Clark A.C. Dimeric procaspase-3 unfolds via a four-state equilibrium process.Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14236-14242Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). PCP-6 and PCP-7 have two tryptophan residues, whereas PCP-CA has only one tryptophan (Fig. 2 and Table S1). In PCP-6, one tryptophan resides in active site loop 1 (Fig. S1), whereas the second tryptophan resides in active site loop 3. In PCP-7 and PCP-CA, the tryptophans are found only in active site loop 3 (Figs. 2 and S1). PCP-6, PCP-7, and PCP-CA have 10, 9, and 13 tyrosine residues, respectively, and they are well distributed in the primary sequence (Figs. 2 and S1). Native PCP-6 has a fluorescence emission maximum at 319 nm (Fig. 3, A and B), whereas that of native PCP-7 is at 338 nm, when excited either at 280 nm or 295 nm (Fig. 3, C and D). In the case of a PCP-CA, the fluorescence emission maximum is 321 nm when excited at 280 nm and 330 nm when excited at 295 nm (Fig. 3, E and F). Overall, the data show that the tryptophan residues in PCP-7 are more solvent exposed than those of PCP-6 or of PCP-CA. In phosphate buffer containing 8 M urea, the fluorescence emission maximum is red shifted to ∼350 nm following excitation at 280 nm or 295 nm in all three proteins, indicating that the proteins were largely unfolded under these solution conditions (Fig. 3). At intermediate concentrations of urea (3–5 M), the emission maxima were red shifted in the case of PCP-6 and PCP-CA but were largely unaffected in the case of PCP-7. We note that, in the unfolded state, PCP-CA exhibits two peaks when excited at 280 nm and a single peak when excited at 295 nm. When excited at 280 nm, but not at 295 nm, the two peaks begin to separate when PCP-CA is incubated in 4.5 M urea and are fully separated by 6 M urea (data not shown). As described previously by Lakowicz (30Lakowicz J.R. Protein fluorescence.Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 3rd Ed. Springer Science and Business Media, Spring Street, NY2006: 530-573Crossref Scopus (16527) Google Scholar), the two peaks likely represent ionized and nonionized tyrosinyl residues, whereas the tryptophanyl residues contribute to the fluorescence emission at ∼350 nm in the unfolded protein. The changes in emission maxima are described more fully later.Figure 3Fluorescence emission spectra of effector caspases following excitation. Left, excitation at 280 nm or right; right, 295 nm.

Clark A.C. Dimeric procaspase-3 unfolds via a four-state equilibrium process.Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14236-14242Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 28Bose K. Clark A.C. pH effects on the stability and dimerization of procaspase-3.Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 24-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the equilibrium unfolding of PCP-6, PCP-7, and PCP-CA at pH 7.5 as a function of urea concentration (0–8 M), and the results are shown in Figure 4. Renaturation experiments of all three proteins demonstrated that the folding transitions are reversible. For PCP-6 at pH 7.5, both the fluorescence emission data (Fig. 4, A and B) as well as the CD data (Fig. 4C) show little to no change in signal between 0 and ∼2.5 M urea. One then observes a cooperative decrease in the signal between ∼3.5 and 5 M urea, demonstrating a plateau between the native and unfolded signals. A second cooperative transition occurs between ∼5 and 6.5 M urea. For PCP-6, the relative signal of the plateau as well as the second cooperative transition is dependent on the protein concentration. In contrast to PCP-6, both PCP-7 (Fig. 4, D–F) and PCP-CA (Fig. 4, G–I) show a protein concentration–dependent increase in the relative signal between 0 and ∼3 M urea, followed by a cooperative decrease in the signal between ∼3 and 6 M urea to form the unfolded state. Thus, the unfolding data are similar for PCP-7 and PCP-CA, where the protein concentration dependence is observed in the first unfolding transition rather than the second transition, as in the case of PCP-6. Altogether, the data in Figure 3, Figure 4 show that the three proteins fold through a stable intermediate, which can be characterized by a red shift in fluorescence emission and a concomitant loss of secondary structure compared with the native dimer. In the case of PCP-6, however, the protein concentration dependence is observed in the second transition, whereas both PCP-7 and PCP-CA show a protein concentration dependence in the first transition. Overall, the data suggest that while the partially folded intermediates that form during urea-induced unfolding have more solvent-exposed tryptophans and less secondary structure, compared with the native dimer, the intermediate remains dimeric in the case of PCP-6, whereas the intermediate is monomeric in the cases of PCP-7 and PCP-CA. The experimental design described previously at pH 7.5 for monitoring fluorescence emission (three to four protein concentrations, each with two excitation wavelengths) and CD (three protein concentrations) provides 11 datasets for each protein are fit globally to determine the free energy and the cooperativity index (m value) for each unfolding transition. In the case of PCP-6, the data were best fit to the three-state equilibrium model described in Equation 1. In this model, the dimeric native conformation, N2, isomerizes to a dimeric intermediate, I2, and the dimeric intermediate dissociates and unfolds to monomers. The dissociation of I2 to 2U leads to a protein concentration–dependent change in the midpoint of the second transition, as shown in Figure 4, A–C. Based on this model, we have determined the conformational free energy, ΔG°conf, and the m values for each step of unfolding. The solid lines in Figure 4, A–C are the results of global fits of the model to the data. The free energy change, ΔG1H2Oand the cooperativity index, m1, for the first step of unfolding, the isomerization of N2 to I2, are 8.4 ± 0.8 kcal/mol and 2.6 ± 0.3 kcal mol−1 M−1, respectively (Table 1). The free energy change, ΔG2H2O, and cooperativity index, m2, for the dissociation and complete unfolding of the dimeric intermediate to two unfolded monomers (I2 ⇄ 2U) are 24.4 ± 0.9 kcal/mol and 2.9 ± 0.2 kcal mol−1 M−1, respectively. Overall, the data demonstrate that PCP-6 is very stable, with the total conformational free energy of 32.8 kcal/mol at pH 7.5 and 25 °C.Table 1Thermodynamic parameters of each step of folding/unfolding of extant and ancestral effector caspases at pH 7.5ProteinsEquilibrium mechanismFree energy changes (ΔG°conf) (kcal mol−1)Cooperativity index (m value) (kcal mol−1 M−1)Total ΔG°conf (kcal mol−1)mtotal (kcal mol−1 M−1)PCP-3aData from Bose and Clark (27).N2 ⇌ I27.9 ± 1.32.8 ± 0.524.8 ± 0.94.5 ± 0.7I2 ⇌ 2I9.7 ± 1.00.5 ± 0.12I ⇌ 2U7.2 ± 0.51.2 ± 0.1PCP-6N2 ⇌ I28.4 ± 0.82.6 ± 0.332.8 ± 1.55.5 ± 0.5I2 ⇌ 2U24.4 ± 0.92.9 ± 0.2PCP-7N2 ⇌ 2I10.2 ± 0.21.3 ± 0.115.4 ± 0.32.5 ± 0.22I ⇌ 2U5.2 ± 0.11.2 ± 0.1PCP-CAN2 ⇌ 2I14.9 ± 0.12 ± 0.121.8 ± 1.33.2 ± 0.22I ⇌ 2U6.9 ± 0.31.2 ± 0.1a Data from Bose and Clark (27Bose K.

Open table in a new tab For PCP-7 and PCP-CA, the global fits demonstrate that the data are well described by a three-state equilibrium model. In contrast to PCP-6, described previously, the partially folded intermediate is monomeric for PCP-7 and PCP-CA (Equation 2). The solid lines in Figures 4, D–F (PCP-7) and 4G–I (PCP-CA) are the results of fits of the data to the model. In the case of PCP-7, the free energy change, ΔG1H2O, and the cooperativity index, m1, for the first step of unfolding, the dissociation of N2 to 2I, are 10.2 ± 0.2 kcal/mol and 1.3 ± 0.1 kcal mol−1 M−1, respectively. The free energy change, ΔG2H2O, and cooperativity index, m2, for the complete unfolding of the monomeric intermediate to unfolded monomeric proteins (I ⇄ U) are 5.2 ± 0.1 kcal/mol and 1.2 ± 0.1 kcal mol−1 M−1, respectively (Table 1). Similarly, for PCP-CA, ΔG1H2O and m1 are 14.9 ± 0.1 kcal/mol and 2.0 ± 0.1 kcal mol−1 M−1, respectively. For unfolding of the monomeric intermediate of PCP-CA (I ⇄ U), ΔG2H2O and m2 are 6.9 ± 0.3 kcal/mol and 1.2 ± 0.1 kcal mol−1 M−1, respectively (Table 1). Overall, the data suggest a minimum three-state process in all effector caspases in which a well-populated intermediate is in equilibrium with the native and unfolded protein. Comparatively, of the three human effector caspases and the CA, PCP-6 is the most stable with ΔG°conf of 32.8 kcal/mol, PCP-CA and PCP-3 are intermediate with ΔG°conf of 21.8 kcal/mol or 24.8 kcal/mol, respectively, and PCP-7 is the least stable with ΔG°conf of 15.4 kcal/mol at pH 7.5 (Fig. 5). We showed previously that PCP-3 undergoes pH-dependent conformational changes, and the dimer dissociates below pH 5.5 (28Bose K.

https://openalex.org/W3202284390,"Many animals migrate to take advantage of temporal and spatial variability in resources. These benefits are offset with costs like increased energetic expenditure and travel through unfamiliar areas. Differences in the cost-benefit ratio for individuals may lead to partial migration with one portion of a population migrating while another does not. We investigated migration dynamics and winter site fidelity for a long-distance partial migrant, barren ground caribou ( Rangifer tarandus granti ) of the Teshekpuk Caribou Herd in northern Alaska. We used GPS telemetry for 76 female caribou over 164 annual movement trajectories to identify timing and location of migration and winter use, proportion of migrants, and fidelity to different herd wintering areas. We found within-individual variation in movement behavior and wintering area use by the Teshekpuk Caribou Herd, adding caribou to the growing list of ungulates that can exhibit migratory plasticity. Using a first passage time–net squared displacement approach, we classified 78.7% of annual movement paths as migration, 11.6% as residency, and 9.8% as another strategy. Timing and distance of migration varied by season and wintering area. Duration of migration was longer for fall migration than for spring, which may relate to the latter featuring more directed movement. Caribou utilized four wintering areas, with multiple areas used each year. This variation occurred not just among different individuals, but state sequence analyses indicated low fidelity of individuals to wintering areas among years. Variability in movement behavior can have fitness consequences. As caribou face the pressures of a rapidly warming Arctic and ongoing human development and activities, further research is needed to investigate what factors influence this diversity of behaviors in Alaska and across the circumpolar Arctic."
https://openalex.org/W3202626669,"Communication policies employed by policymakers and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) often appeal to the emotions to persuade people to adopt virtuous behavior. The aim of this paper is to study the impact of induced emotions on pro-environmental behavior (PEB). We design a three-stage laboratory experiment. In the first stage, we determine the level of the subjects’ environmental awareness. In the second stage, subjects read scripts that place them in realistic hypothetical scenarios designed to induce specific emotions. We implement a 2 x 2 in-between design by varying both the valence and social dimension of the four emotional states induced: happiness, sadness, pride and shame. In the third stage, subjects play a modified dictator game in which the recipient is an environmental non-governmental organization (ENGO). We show that the emotional states of subjects can influence PEB. In particular, negative emotions significantly reduce the average individual amount of donations made to ENGOs. We also find that the precise impact of the emotional states is more complex and appears to be dependent on individuals’ characteristics and awareness for environmental issues. For instance, in positive emotional states, men donate significantly less than women. In addition, a high level of environmental awareness increases donations in subjects experiencing shame and decreases their likelihood to donate when feeling pride. Also, we observe behavioral consistency for negative emotions and rather compensatory behavior for positive emotions."
https://openalex.org/W3202362671,"Intervertebral disc herniation (IVDH) is a frequently occurring neurological disease of dogs and the most common reason for spinal cord injury (SCI). Clinical signs are variable thus a reliable prognosis is crucial for further treatment decisions. Currently, the prognosis of IVDH primarily depends on presence or absence of deep pain perception. The purpose of this study was to investigate if Th17-cells could serve as a potential, prognostic biomarker for IVDH. We investigated a possible role of the adaptive immune system in the pathophysiology of IVDH in dogs. The investigation was performed by analyzing the influence of Th17-cells in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of sixty-two dogs suffering from IVDH. In addition, we examined if Th17-cells might influence the course of this disease. As controls, paired blood and CSF samples of ten healthy clinic-owned dogs were examined and the values were compared to those of the IVDH group. Isolated lymphocytes were analyzed after stimulation by using multicolour flow cytometry to measure the number of Th17-cells. IL-17 levels were measured in paired serum and CSF samples by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA). Highly significant differences of stimulated Th17-cells in EDTA-blood samples could be determined between Th17-cell levels of dogs suffering from IVDH and the healthy control group and also between three sampling time points: preoperative, after clinical improvement and after six months. Preoperatively, Th17-cell levels were strongly decreased in contrast to the healthy controls. The decreased amount of Th17-cell levels recovered postoperatively so that Th17-cell levels of the last follow-up examinations were comparable to the control group after six months. At the same time IL-17 measured in serum preoperatively was significantly higher in dogs with IVDH than in healthy controls. However, there was no considerable difference of IL-17 measured in CSF between the groups. In conclusion, a high activity and consequent consumption of IL-17-producing Th17-cells is suspected in acute IVDH. These findings may indicate an involvement of Th17-cells in the pathogenesis of IVDH and emphasize that these cells might be involved in the interaction of pain, stress and immune reaction. However, based on the findings of this study the development of Th17-cells as a biomarker cannot be recommended, yet."

This study aimed to investigate how the addition of β-glucans can affect the fecal bacterial community with possible consequences on animal growth and health. For this, newborn Holstein calves (n = 14) were individually housed in tropical shelters and blocked according to sex, date, and weight at birth and randomly assigned to one of the following treatments: (1) Control: milk replacer (14% solids, 24% CP, 18.5% fat); (2) β-glucans: milk replacer supplemented with β-glucans (2 g/d). All calves were bucket fed 6 L/d of milk replacer and received water and starter concentrate ad libitum starting on d 2. To evaluate the bacteriome, fecal samples were collected at weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8. The bacterial community was assessed through sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene on the Illumina MiSeq platform and analyzed using the DADA2 pipeline. No differences for Shannon and Chao1 indexes were observed for treatments, but both indexes increased with age (P &lt; 0.001). There were dissimilarities in the structure of the bacterial community during the pre-weaning period ( P = 0.01). In a deeper taxonomic level, Collinsella (Actinobacteriota), Prevotella (Bacteroidota), and Lactobacillus (Firmicutes) were the most abundant genera (9.84, 9.54, and 8.82% of the sequences, respectively). β-glucans promoted a higher abundance of Alloprevotella and Holdemanella , which may indicate a beneficial effect of supplementation on dairy calves. The bacterial community was highly correlated with the fecal score at weeks 1 and 2 and with starter concentrate intake at week 8.

Data was obtained from the publicly available responses to the 2017 Seoul Survey, conducted among Seoul-based Korean locals aged ≥ 15 years (N = 42,687; pet owners = 8,708, non-owners = 33,979). Propensity score was calculated by performing logistic regressions with covariates and data was matched using the nearest-neighbor method. Further, multiple linear regression was performed to analyze this association using the matched data. Additionally, survey-weighted multiple regressions were performed: 1) within pet owners, and 2) after stratifying owners with the number of pets owned. Pet owners in Seoul, South Korea reported higher levels of OLS than non-owners, even after controlling for covariates—age, sex, marital status, family size, family income, job, education, types of housing, housing tenure. Owners with both dogs and cats showed the highest average OLS scores (owners with 2 pets: Mean [M] = 58.05, Standard Deviation [SD] = 0.67; owners with ≥ 3 pets: M = 59.03, SD = 1.02), followed by single pet owners of either a cat (M = 56.64, SD = 0.37) or a dog (M = 56.14, SD = 0.13). Single pet owners reported significantly higher levels of OLS than those with 2 or ≥ 3 pets when pet types were adjusted for. When owners had a single pet, pet types (dog or cat) did not generate a significant difference in OLS scores. Among owners with 2 or ≥ 3 pets, however, owners with both dogs and cats had higher OLS scores than dog owners. This research has significant implications for promoting future study on companion animal effects for improving human health and well-being. Mechanisms of the effect, including cultural factors, should be further investigated."

https://openalex.org/W3204396397,"Pesticides use in Southeast Asia has increased steadily, driven by the growth of large-scale commercial farming, as well as a desire to maximise food production in rural subsistence economies. Given that use of chemical pesticides, such as organophosphates and carbamates, has known potential health impacts, there are concerns about the safety of agricultural workers, and a need for a better evidence base to underpin regulation and worker education. This study, undertaken in 9 districts in Lao PDR, Thailand and Vietnam, will interview agricultural workers to investigate how they use pesticides, their knowledge of risks and self-protective practices, and their self-reported illness symptoms. In each district researchers will recruit and interview 120 participants engaged in vegetable farming, who have recently used pesticides, making a total of 1080 subjects divided equally between the three study countries. Workers’ degree of pesticides exposure will be determined from acetyl cholinesterase concentrations in capillary blood samples collected using field test kits, and these data will be analysed together with the interview findings. Country findings will be compared and contrasted, and general patterns noted. Knowledge gained about risky behaviours, self-protective practices and degree of association with serious pesticides exposure will assist policy makers and inform health improvement programmes."

Using the well-established HIE rat pup model we measured the effects of RLS-0071 during the acute stages of the brain injury and on long-term neurocognitive outcomes. Rat pups subject to hypoxia-ischemia insult received one of 4 interventions including normothermia, hypothermia and RLS-0071 with and without hypothermia. We measured histopathological effects, brain C1q levels and neuroimaging at day 1 and 21 after the injury. A subset of animals was followed into adolescence and evaluated for neurocognitive function. On histological evaluation, RLS-0071 showed neuronal protection in combination with hypothermia (P = 0.048) in addition to reducing C1q levels in the brain at 1hr (P = 0.01) and at 8 hr in combination with hypothermia (P = 0.005). MRI neuroimaging demonstrated that RLS-0071 in combination with hypothermia reduced lesion volume at 24 hours (P&lt;0.05) as well as decreased T2 signal at day 21 in combination with hypothermia (P&lt;0.01). RLS-0071 alone or in combination with hypothermia improved both short-term and long-term memory. These findings suggest that modulation by RLS-0071 can potentially decrease brain damage resulting from HIE."
https://openalex.org/W3203595497,"More than 2,000 common bottlenose dolphins ( Tursiops truncatus ) inhabit the Barataria Bay Estuarine System in Louisiana, USA, a highly productive estuary with variable salinity driven by natural and man-made processes. It was unclear whether dolphins that are long-term residents to specific areas within the basin move in response to fluctuations in salinity, which at times can decline to 0 parts per thousand in portions of the basin. In June 2017, we conducted health assessments and deployed satellite telemetry tags on dolphins in the northern portions of the Barataria Bay Estuarine System Stock area (9 females; 4 males). We analyzed their fine-scale movements relative to modeled salinity trends compared to dolphins tagged near the barrier islands (higher salinity environments) from 2011 to 2017 (37 females; 21 males). Even though we observed different movement patterns among individual dolphins, we found no evidence that tagged dolphins moved coincident with changes in salinity. One tagged dolphin spent at least 35 consecutive days, and 75 days in total, in salinity under 5 parts per thousand. Health assessments took place early in a seasonal period of decreased salinity. Nonetheless, we found an increased prevalence of skin lesions, as well as abnormalities in serum biochemical markers and urine:serum osmolality ratios for dolphins sampled in lower salinity areas. This study provides essential information on the likely behavioral responses of dolphins to changes in salinity (e.g., severe storms or from the proposed Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion project) and on physiological markers to inform the timing and severity of impacts from low salinity exposure."
https://openalex.org/W3202550870,"Background While many studies have reported the rate and risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers (HCWs), there are scant data regarding the impact of employment type and job grades upon such risk. Methods We determined the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on a positive nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) PCR among employees of a large national healthcare system. Antibody testing was performed on those who agreed to provide a blood sample. Using logistic regression analysis, we determined the risk of infection (PCR+) associated with demographic characteristics, job family and job grade. Results We identified 35,075 staff (30,849 full-time, 4,226 outsourced) between March 1-October 31, 2020. Among full-time employees, 78.0% had a NPS (11.8% positive). Among outsourced staff, 94.4% had a NPS (31.1% positive). Antibody testing was performed on 33.9% full-time employees (13.0% reactive), and on 39.1% of the outsourced staff (47.0% reactive). PCR-positivity was higher among outsourced staff (31.0% vs. 18.3% in non-clinical and 9.0% in clinical full-time employees) and those in the low-grade vs. mid-grade and high-grade job categories. Male sex (OR 1.88), non-clinical job family (OR 1.21), low-grade job category (OR 3.71) and being an outsourced staff (OR 2.09) were associated with a higher risk of infection. Conclusion HCWs are a diverse population with varying risk of infection. Clinical staff are at a lower risk likely due to increased awareness and infection prevention measures. Risk is higher for those in the lower socioeconomic strata. Infection is more likely to occur in non-healthcare setting than within the healthcare facilities."
https://openalex.org/W3204915034,"Angler trip success and catch rates are dependent upon a fishes’ vulnerability to angling. Angling vulnerability can be influenced by angler-specific attributes (i.e., bait choice, lure size, use of a guide), and individual fish traits (i.e., boldness, aggression, stress responsiveness, and memory retention). The mechanisms that function in a fishes’ angling vulnerability, and contribute to catch rate, are likely correlated with environmental factors however, the influence of environmental factors on angling vulnerability are not well understood. We used the long-term (1946 –present) compulsory creel dataset from Escanaba Lake, WI, USA to test for interactions between angling vulnerability (i.e., angler trip success and catch rates) and environmental factors to better understand these dynamics in recreational fisheries. Our objective was to test for the influence of angler associated variables and environmental factors on open water angler trip success (i.e., catch ≥ one fish) and catch rate of walleye Sander vitreus and muskellunge Esox masquinongy during 2003–2015 using a hurdle model approach. Fishing trip success and catch rates for both species were most strongly influenced by angler-related variables (i.e., guide status, bait type, the proportion of the fish population previously caught). Environmental factors associated with lower light intensity (i.e., diel period, mean daily solar radiation, solar-Julian day interaction) had a positive influence on walleye vulnerability. Lower air temperatures and lunar position (moon overhead or underfoot) and phase (gibbous’ and full moon) also had a positive effect on walleye angling. Muskellunge trip success and catch rate were positively influenced by light metrics (i.e., diel period and mean daily solar radiation) and increased with air temperature. Lunar variables (position and phase), as well as wind speed and direction also influenced muskellunge angling vulnerability. A better understanding of the influence of environmental factors on angling vulnerability is an important component of fisheries management as management goals focus on balancing fish populations and creating satisfactory catch rates to enhance the angling experience. Our results suggest that angler-specific variables, light, temperature, lunar, and weather conditions influenced species-specific angling vulnerability for walleye and muskellunge."
https://openalex.org/W3202785777,"A numerical model of the dynamic triaxial test of graded crushed stone was established based on DEM (Discrete Element Method) to study its dynamic characteristics. The influence of test conditions on simulation results was analysed through numerical simulation. A method for determining the test conditions was proposed, and the reliability of the simulation was verified. We studied the accumulation rule and failure standard of permanent deformation. We then determined the critical failure stress level. The prediction model of permanent deformation cumulative failure was then established. When the calculation time step is greater than 1 E −4 s per step, the stability of the dynamic triaxial numerical test of graded crushed stone is good. The plastic deformation of the simulated specimen tends to be stable under 10,000 dynamic loading cycles. When the specimen height and diameter are greater than 20 and 10 cm, respectively, the specimen size has little influence on the simulated axial strain. The recommended specimen size is 10 cm (Ф) × 20 cm ( h ). The action time curve results are consistent with indoor measurement results, which proves the simulation’s reliability. The critical failure stress is approximately linearly correlated with the confining pressure, and the cumulative failure equation of plastic deformation is established."
https://openalex.org/W3203328491,"Airborne transmission of infectious respiratory pathogens is a significant health hazard for the general public as well as healthcare professionals. Face masks have been frequently utilized as safety measures to limit the transmission of these infectious aerosolized particles. However, the efficacy of face masks in reducing respiratory virus infectivity and pathogenicity is unknown. Improving the effectiveness of masks in blocking viruses is urgently needed. In this study, surgical mask filters were modified by coating the filters with 1, 3, or 5 M of sodium dihydrogen phosphate, and subsequently exposed to the aerosolized respiratory influenza viruses (A/H3N2, A/H5N1) generated by a nebulizer set. Mask filter modification significantly reduced the size and counts of filter pores, which enabled entrapment of 40–60% of aerosolized viruses (captured viruses) with more than 90% of the captured viruses losing their infectivity. Upon contact with the coated mask filters, both the captured viruses and the viruses that managed to bypass the filter pore (passed viruses) were found to be inactivated. Passed viruses demonstrated significantly reduced pathogenicity in mice as indicated by significantly reduced lung virus titers, bodyweight loss, and prolonged survival compared to bare control. These findings highlight the potential of modified mask filters for reducing viral activity and pathogenicity, which contributes to improving facial mask efficacy as well as limiting airborne pathogen transmission."
https://openalex.org/W3204059382,"Environmental monitoring plays a vital role in environmental protection, especially for the management and conservation of natural resources. However, environmental monitoring data is usually difficult to resist malicious attacks because it is transmitted in an open and insecure channel. In our paper, a new data sharing scheme is proposed by using attribute-based encryption, identity-based signature and cloud computing technology to meet the requirements of confidentiality, integrity, verifiability, and unforgerability of environmental monitoring data. The monitoring equipment encrypts the monitored environmental data and uploads it to the environmental cloud server. Then, monitoring users can request access to the environmental cloud server. If the monitoring user meets the access policy, the plaintext is finally obtained through the fog node decryption. Our proposal mainly uses attribute-based encryption technology to realize the privacy protection and fine-grained access control of monitoring data. The integrity and unforgeability of the monitoring data are ensured by the digital signature. In addition, outsourcing computing technology saves the computing overhead of monitoring equipment and monitoring users. The security analysis illustrates that our proposal can achieve security purposes. Finally, the performance of our proposal and related schemes is evaluated from the aspects of communication overhead and computing overhead. The results indicate that our proposal is secure and efficient in environmental monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W3204142245,"Translators face hectic daily schedules with deadlines they must duly meet. As trainees they receive tuition on how to work swiftly to meet them efficiently. But despite the prominent role of time pressure, its effects on the translation process are still scarcely researched. Studies point to the higher occurrence of errors under stringent time constraints. Most of these studies use key-logging or eye-tracking techniques to identify the problems encountered. But no attempt has yet been made to measure the physiological effects of time pressure in English-to-Spanish translation and their interplay with trainees’ psychological state. The present study researches the influence of time pressure on translation by exploring trainees’ physiological response (i.e., salivary cortisol) and psychological traits (i.e., self-esteem and anxiety). 33 Spanish translation trainees translated 3 English literary texts under different time pressure conditions: Text 1 (no time limit), Text 2 (10 minutes), Text 3 (5 minutes). Regression analysis results showed that higher cortisol levels during preparation predicted higher number of meaning errors in Text 1 and lower number of translated words in Text 2 and 3. Besides, higher trait anxiety emerged as predictor of lower number of translated words, but higher accuracy under extreme time constraints and in the absence of time pressure. Higher self-esteem correlated with lower levels of anxiety and lower levels of cortisol during preparation and recovery, suggesting that it may act as a protective factor against stress. And yet, the regression analysis showed that higher self-esteem predicted lower meaning and total accuracy under extreme time pressure. Besides, in our correlation analysis self-esteem was positively related to the number of translated words in Text 2 and 3. Results suggest that even if self-esteem could be a protective factor against stress, it may also have a negative effect on task performance mediated by overconfidence."
https://openalex.org/W3204206907,"Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) infect up to one-quarter of the global population, with a significant associated disease burden. The main human STH are: Ancylostoma spp. and Necator americanus (hookworms); Ascaris lumbricoides , Trichuris trichiura , and Strongyloides stercoralis . The aim of this study was to establish a scalable system for stool STH multiplex quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions (qPCR). Stool samples collected in Fiji and preserved in potassium dichromate were transferred to Melbourne at ambient temperature. Samples were washed to remove potassium dichromate and DNA was extracted with the Mini-Beadbeater-24 and a column-based kit. A SYBR green qPCR to detect the vertebrate mitochondrial gene was used as a DNA extraction control. Samples were tested using a probe-based multiplex qPCR targeting A . lumbricoides , T . trichiura and S . stercoralis , and in a second multiplex reaction to detect hookworms to the species level ( A . duodenale , A . ceylanicum , N . americanus ). An internal amplification control in both multiplex assays was included to prevent false-negative results due to PCR inhibitors. Samples were homogenised for a single cycle of 40 seconds to release STH DNA and washed stool was stored for up to 15 weeks at -30°C without compromising DNA. Our multiplex qPCR detected multiple species of STH without reduced sensitivity compared to singleplex. qPCR data from 40 stools was validated against STH-positive stools determined by microscopy. We have developed and validated an efficient and staged system for detecting six clinically important STH affecting humans that could be easily implemented without advanced automation in any qPCR-capable laboratory."
https://openalex.org/W3204685024,"Loss of functional pancreatic β-cell mass leads to type 2 diabetes (T2D), attributable to modified β-cell-dependent adaptive gene expression patterns. SetD7 is a histone methyltransferase enriched in pancreatic islets that mono- and dimethylates histone-3-lysine-4 (H3K4), promoting euchromatin modifications, and also maintains the regulation of key β-cell function and survival genes. However, the transcriptional regulation of this important epigenetic modifier is unresolved. Here we identified the nuclear hormone receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) as a major transcriptional regulator of SetD7 and provide evidence for direct binding and functionality of PPARγ in the SetD7 promoter region. Furthermore, constitutive shRNA-mediated PPARγ knockdown in INS-1 β-cells or pancreas-specific PPARγ deletion in mice led to downregulation of SetD7 expression as well as its nuclear enrichment. The relevance of the SetD7-PPARγ interaction in β-cell adaptation was tested in normoglycemic 60% partial pancreatectomy (Px) and hyperglycemic 90% Px rat models. Whereas a synergistic increase in islet PPARγ and SetD7 expression was observed upon glycemic adaptation post-60% Px, in hyperglycemic 90% Px rats, islet PPARγ, and PPARγ targets SetD7 and Pdx1 were downregulated. PPARγ agonist pioglitazone treatment in 90% Px rats partially restored glucose homeostasis and β-cell mass and enhanced expression of SetD7 and Pdx1. Collectively, these data provide evidence that the SetD7-PPARγ interaction serves as an important element of the adaptive β-cell response."

Despite the high incidence of lameness, there are no studies on the features that are useful for classifying lameness patterns. Therefore, we aimed to identify features of high importance for classifying population differences in lameness patterns using an inertial measurement unit mounted above the sacral region. Methods Features computed exhaustively for multidimensional time series consisting of three-axis angular velocities and three-axis acceleration were carefully selected using the Benjamini–Yekutieli procedure, and multiclass classification was performed using LightGBM (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA). We calculated the relative importance of the features that contributed to the classification task in machine learning. Results The most important feature was found to be the absolute value of the Fourier coefficients of the second frequency calculated by the one-dimensional discrete Fourier transform for real input. This was determined by the fast Fourier transformation algorithm using data of a single gait cycle of the yaw angular velocity of the pelvic region. Conclusions Using an inertial measurement unit worn over the sacral region, we determined a set of features of high importance for classifying differences in lameness patterns based on different factors. This completely new set of indicators can be used to advance the understanding of lameness."
https://openalex.org/W3202876333,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) adversely affects the normal functioning, intrinsic material properties, and structural integrity of many tissues, including bone. It is well known that the clinical utility of areal bone mineral density (aBMD) is limited to assess bone strength in individuals with T2DM. Therefore, there is a need to explore new diagnostic techniques that can better assist and improve the accuracy of assessment of bone tissue quality. The present study investigated the link between bone and fingernail material/compositional properties in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). For that, femoral head and fingernail samples were obtained from twenty-five adult female patients (with/without T2DM) with fragility femoral neck fractures undergoing hemi/total hip arthroplasty. Cylindrical cores of trabecular bone were subjected to micro-CT, and lower bone volume fraction was observed in the diabetic group than the non-diabetic group due to fewer and thinner trabeculae in individuals with T2DM. The material and compositional properties of bone/fingernail were estimated using nanoindentation and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, respectively. Both bone/fingernails in T2DM had lower reduced modulus ( E r ), hardness (H), lower Amide I and Amide II area ratio (protein content), higher sugar-to-matrix ratio, and relatively high carboxymethyl-lysine (CML) content compared with non-diabetic patients. Sugar-to-matrix ratio and relative CML content were strongly and positively correlated with HbA 1c for both bone/fingernail. There was a positive correlation between bone and fingernail glycation content. Our findings provide evidence that the degradation pattern of bone and fingernail properties go hand-in-hand in individuals with T2DM. Hence, the fingernail compositional/material properties might serve as a non-invasive surrogate marker of bone quality in T2DM; however, further large-scale studies need to be undertaken."
https://openalex.org/W3203136086,"Inclusive language focuses on using the vocabulary to avoid exclusion or discrimination, specially referred to gender. The task of finding gender bias in written documents must be performed manually, and it is a time-consuming process. Consequently, studying the usage of non-inclusive language on a document, and the impact of different document properties (such as author gender, date of presentation, etc.) on how many non-inclusive instances are found, is quite difficult or even impossible for big datasets. This research analyzes the gender bias in academic texts by analyzing a study corpus of more than 12,000 million words obtained from more than one hundred thousand doctoral theses from Spanish universities. For this purpose, an automated algorithm was developed to evaluate the different characteristics of the document and look for interactions between age, year of publication, gender or the field of knowledge in which the doctoral thesis is framed. The algorithm identified information patterns using a CNN (convolutional neural network) by the creation of a vector representation of the sentences. The results showed evidence that there was a greater bias as the age of the authors increased, who were more likely to use non-inclusive terms; it was concluded that there is a greater awareness of inclusiveness in women than in men, and also that this awareness grows as the candidate is younger. The results showed evidence that the age of the authors increased discrimination, with men being more likely to use non-inclusive terms (up to an index of 23.12), showing that there is a greater awareness of inclusiveness in women than in men in all age ranges (with an average of 14.99), and also that this awareness grows as the candidate is younger (falling down to 13.07). In terms of field of knowledge, the humanities are the most biased (20.97), discarding the subgroup of Linguistics, which has the least bias at all levels (9.90), and the field of science and engineering, which also have the least influence (13.46). Those results support the assumption that the bias in academic texts (doctoral theses) is due to unconscious issues: otherwise, it would not depend on the field, age, gender, and would occur in any field in the same proportion. The innovation provided by this research lies mainly in the ability to detect, within a textual document in Spanish, whether the use of language can be considered non-inclusive, based on a CNN that has been trained in the context of the doctoral thesis. A significant number of documents have been used, using all accessible doctoral theses from Spanish universities of the last 40 years; this dataset is only manageable by data mining systems, so that the training allows identifying the terms within the context effectively and compiling them in a novel dictionary of non-inclusive terms."
https://openalex.org/W3203366671,"Background Common mental disorders are the major public healthproblem that affects mothers with young children. Although there were a number of studies done on maternal mental health problems, they were largely focused on perinatal period. However, there is scarcity of information on the magnitude and correlates of these mental health problems beyond perinatal period and due concern is not given mainly in LMICs including our country. Objective To assess the prevalence and factors associated with common mental disorderamong mothers of under-five year children at Arbaminch town, South Ethiopia, 2019. Methods A community based cross-sectional study was conducted in May and June 2019 at Arbaminch town. A systematic random sampling technique was used to select 776 participants. The Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) was used to assess common mental disorder (CMD). Data was coded and entered in EPIDATA3.1 and analyzed using SPSS version 25. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify factors associated to common mental disorder. P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant and strength of the association was presented by adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval. Result The prevalence of common mental disorder among mothers with children aged below five years was 36.6% with (95% CI, 33.2, 39.9). Being single/divorced/widowed [AOR = 3.64, 95% CI:(1.47, 8.99), chronic medical illness [AOR = 3.25, 95% CI:(2.10, 5.04)], exposure to two/more stressful events [AOR = 1.62, 95% CI:(1.11, 2.36)], poor social support [AOR = 2.59, 95% CI:(1.62, 4.14)], mothers living with cigarette smoker husband [AOR = 2.03, 95% CI:(1.19, 3.47)], and mothers physically abused by their spouse [AOR = 2.36, 95% CI:(1.49, 3.74)] were factors associated with common mental disorder. Conclusion and recommendation The prevalence of common mental disorder was high among mothers with children aged below five years compared to the general population. Being single/divorced/widowed, chronic medicalillness, exposure to two/more stressful events, poor social support, mothers living with cigarette smoker husbandand physically abuse by their spouse were factors associated with common mental disorder. Early detection and management of these maternal mental health problems is vital for mothers’ wellbeing as well as growth and development of children."

Despite providing critical information on the intimate arrangement of a fraction of htau molecule within the fibrillar scaffold, the cryo-EM studies neither yield a complete picture of tau fibrillar assemblies structure nor contribute insights into the surfaces that define their interactions with numerous cellular components. Here, using proteomic approaches such as proteolysis and molecular covalent painting, we mapped the exposed amino acid stretches at the surface and those constituting the fibrillar core of in vitro-assembled fibrils of human htau containing one N-terminal domain and three (1N3R) or four (1N4R) C-terminal microtubule-binding repeat domains as a result of alternative splicing. Using limited proteolysis, we identified the proteolytic fragments composing the molecular ""bar-code"" for each type of fibril. Our results are in agreement with structural data reported for filamentous tau from AD, PiD, and CBD cases predigested with the protease pronase. Finally, we report two amino acid stretches, exposed to the solvent in 1N4R not in 1N3R htau, which distinguish the surfaces of these two kinds of fibrils. Our findings open new perspectives for the design of highly specific ligands with diagnostic and therapeutic potential."
https://openalex.org/W3204928245,"Dynamic actin filaments are required for the formation and internalization of endocytic vesicles. Yeast actin cables serve as a track for the translocation of endocytic vesicles to early endosomes, but the molecular mechanisms regulating the interaction between vesicles and the actin cables remain ambiguous. Previous studies have demonstrated that the yeast Eps15-like protein Pan1p plays an important role in this interaction, and that interaction is not completely lost even after deletion of the Pan1p actin-binding domain, suggesting that additional proteins mediate association of the vesicle with the actin cable. Other candidates for mediating the interaction are endocytic coat proteins Sla2p (yeast Hip1R) and Ent1p/2p (yeast epsins), as these proteins can bind to both the plasma membrane and the actin filament. Here, we investigated the degree of redundancy in the actin-binding activities of Pan1p, Sla2p, and Ent1p/2p involved in the internalization and transport of endocytic vesicles. Expression of the nonphosphorylatable form of Pan1p, Pan1-18TA, caused abnormal accumulation of both actin cables and endocytic vesicles, and this accumulation was additively suppressed by deletion of the actin-binding domains of both Pan1p and Ent1p. Interestingly, deletion of the actin-binding domains of Pan1p and Ent1p in cells lacking the ENT2 gene resulted in severely defective internalization of endocytic vesicles and recruitment of actin cables to the site of endocytosis. These results suggest that Pan1p and Ent1p/2p cooperatively regulate the interaction between the endocytic vesicle and the actin cable."

Despite the known cryptographic guarantees present in the blockchain, there exists significant evidence of inconsistencies and suspicious behavior in the chain. In this paper, we examine the prevalence and evolution of two types of anomalies occurring in coinbase transactions in blockchain mining, which we reported on in earlier research. We further develop our techniques for investigating the impact of these anomalies on the blockchain transaction network, by building networks induced by anomalous coinbase transactions at regular intervals and calculating a range of network measures, including degree correlation and assortativity, as well as inequality in terms of wealth and anomaly ratio using the Gini coefficient. We obtain time series of network measures calculated over the full transaction network and three sub-networks. Inspecting trends in these time series allows us to identify a period in time with particularly strange transaction behavior. We then perform a frequency analysis of this time period to reveal several blocks of highly anomalous transactions. Our technique represents a novel way of using network science to detect and investigate cryptographic anomalies."
https://openalex.org/W3202146605,"To determine trends in either frog distribution or abundance in the State of Louisiana, we reviewed and analyzed frog call data from the Louisiana Amphibian Monitoring Program (LAMP). The data were collected between 1997 and 2017 using North American Amphibian Monitoring Program protocols. Louisiana was divided into three survey regions for administration and analysis: the Florida Parishes, and 2 areas west of the Florida parishes called North and South. Fifty-four routes were surveyed with over 12,792 stops and 1,066 hours of observation. Observers heard 26 species of the 31 species reported to be in Louisiana. Three of the species not heard were natives with ranges that did not overlap with survey routes. The other two species were introduced species, the Rio Grande Chirping Frog ( Eleutherodactylus cystignathoides) and the Cuban Treefrog ( Osteopilus septentrionalis) . Both seem to be limited to urban areas with little to no route coverage. The 15 most commonly occurring species were examined in detail using the percentage of stops at which they observed along a given survey and their call indices. Most species exhibited a multimodal, concave, or convex pattern of abundance over a 15-year period. Among LAMP survey regions, none of the species had synchronous population trends. Only one group of species, winter callers, regularly co-occur. Based on the species lists, the North region could be seen as a subset of the South. However, based on relative abundance, the North was more similar to Florida parishes for both the winter and summer survey runs. Our analyses demonstrate that long-term monitoring (10 years or more) may be necessary to determine population and occupancy trends, and that frog species may have different local demographic patterns across large geographic areas."

Here we present a detailed description of the postcranial skeletal anatomy of the holotype specimen of B . inexpectus , including two never before described dorsal vertebrae from the anterior half of the series. Based on these observations, and comparisons with the postcranial skeleton of therizinosaurian taxa named since the most recent diagnosis, we revised the diagnostic features for B . inexpectus adding three new possible autapomorphies (PII-3 shorter than PIII-4, subequal length of the pre- and postacetabular portions of the ilium, and equidimensional pubic peduncle of ilium). Additionally, we also propose three possible synapomorphies for more inclusive taxa (Therizinosauroidea and Therizinosauridae) and discuss implications for evolutionary trends within Therizinosauria. The newly acquired data from the postcranial osteology of the holotype specimen of B . inexpectus sheds light on our understanding of postcranial skeletal evolution and identification of therizinosaurians."

In this study, we determined the crystal structure of SmuCas5c at a resolution of 1.72 Å, which revealed the presence of an N-terminal modified RNA recognition motif and a C-terminal twisted β-sheet domain with four bound sulphate molecules. Analysis of surface charge and residue conservation of the SmuCas5c structure suggested the location of an RNA-binding site in a shallow groove formed by the RNA recognition motif domain with several conserved positively charged residues (Arg39, Lys52, Arg109, Arg127, and Arg134). Purified SmuCas5c exhibited metal-independent ribonuclease activity against single-stranded pre-CRISPR RNAs containing a stem–loop structure with a seven-nucleotide stem and a pentaloop. We found SmuCas5c cleaves substrate RNA within the repeat sequence at a single cleavage site located at the 3′-base of the stem but shows significant tolerance to substrate sequence variations downstream of the cleavage site. Structure-based mutational analysis revealed that the conserved residues Tyr50, Lys120, and His121 comprise the SmuCas5c catalytic residues. In addition, site-directed mutagenesis of positively charged residues Lys52, Arg109, and Arg134 located near the catalytic triad had strong negative effects on the RNase activity of this protein, suggesting that these residues are involved in RNA binding.

Structure-based mutational analysis revealed that the conserved residues Tyr50, Lys120, and His121 comprise the SmuCas5c catalytic residues. In addition, site-directed mutagenesis of positively charged residues Lys52, Arg109, and Arg134 located near the catalytic triad had strong negative effects on the RNase activity of this protein, suggesting that these residues are involved in RNA binding. Taken together, our results reveal functional diversity of Cas5c ribonucleases and provide further insight into the molecular mechanisms of substrate selectivity and activity of these enzymes. The complex process of the adaptive immunity implemented by the CRISPR and their associated (Cas) genes has been harnessed to revolutionize the fields of molecular biology, biotechnology, and medicine (1Cong L.

RNA-guided genetic silencing systems in bacteria and archaea.Nature. 2012; 482: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). During the initial adaptation stage, new spacer sequences are excised from foreign nucleic acids and inserted into the host CRISPR array, separated by the “repeat” sequences of that locus. In the second stage, the long RNA transcript of the CRISPR locus (pre-crRNA) is specifically cleaved generating individual crRNAs consisting of a single spacer and flanking repeat sequences. These crRNAs bind to Cas proteins to form effector complexes that degrade the corresponding target sequences in the final stage of CRISPR immunity (interference) (7Hale C.R. Zhao P. Olson S.

Although this is the general process of CRISPR immunity, the specific way in which it is achieved varies greatly among different types of CRISPR systems (9Brouns S.J. Jore M.M. Lundgren M.

All CRISPR–Cas systems have been classified into two classes (1 and 2), six types (class 1: types I, III, and IV; class 2: types II, V, and VI), and further into 33 subtypes based on repeat sequences and cas operon composition (10Makarova K.S.

In type II systems, an endogenous RNase III is responsible for the cleavage of the pre-crRNA/transactivating crRNA duplex, whereas the pre-crRNA processing is mediated by a multidomain Cas protein in types V (Cas12) and VI (Cas13) (13Makarova K.S.

Likewise, most type I and IV systems use variants of the Cas6 protein for crRNA maturation. Types I-A and I-B have repeat RNAs similar to that in type III systems and therefore have similarly functioning Cas6a and Cas6b proteins (18Richter H. Lange S.J. Backofen R. Randau L.

Type I-C (previously Dvulg) is the only CRISPR subtype that employs a Cas5 variant, Cas5c (originally known as Cas5d), to process pre-crRNA (10Makarova K.S. Haft D.H. Barrangou R. Brouns S.J.

The repeat sequences in this subtype are also predicted to form stable RNA hairpin structures, and the biochemically and structurally characterized Cas5c proteins from Bacillus halodurans (BhaCas5c), Streptococcus pyogenes (SpyCas5c), Xanthomonas oryzae (XorCas5c), and Desulfovibrio vulgaris (DvuCas5c) have been shown to cleave at the 3′-base of the stem, with no further processing (32Nam K.H.

Both Cas5 and Cas6 proteins belong to the repeat-associated mysterious protein (RAMP) superfamily containing one or more RAMP domains with the RNA recognition motif (RRM) fold (23Reeks J.

RNA is cleaved through a metal-independent acid–base hydrolysis, generating 5′-OH and 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate products (33Garside E.L. Schellenberg M.J. Gesner E.M. Bonanno J.B. Sauder J.M.

Based on sequence analysis, two subgroups have been proposed within the Cas5c family: the subgroup A (B. halodurans and S. pyogenes) contains a C-terminal extension (∼30 residues), whereas the subgroup B (X. oryzae) has an insertion (∼23 residues) between the β3 and β4 strands (34Koo Y. Ka D. Kim E.J. Suh N. Bae E. Conservation and variability in the structure and function of the Cas5d endoribonuclease in the CRISPR-mediated microbial immune system.J. Mol.

After RNA cleavage, the BhaCas5c protein from B. halodurans has been shown to assemble in a complex with the processed crRNA and the Cas8c and Cas7 proteins to form an interference complex (32Nam K.H.

Furthermore, it has also been shown to bind and cleave both single-stranded (ss) and double-stranded (ds) DNA (36Punetha A. Sivathanu R. Anand B. Active site plasticity enables metal-dependent tuning of Cas5d nuclease activity in CRISPR-Cas type I-C system.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 3846-3856Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Two other Cas5c proteins (SpyCas5c and XorCas5c) have been shown to bind dsDNA nonspecifically but not cleave it (34Koo Y. Ka D. Kim E.J. Suh N. Bae E.

Streptococcus mutans is a Gram-positive cariogenic bacterium representing one of the major pathogens implicated in human dental caries (37Burne R.A. Oral streptococci… products of their environment.J. Dent. Res. 1998; 77: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The S. mutans UA159 genome reveals the presence of two CRISPR loci, CRISPR1 (type II-A) and CRISPR2 (type I-C), with several spacers complementary or highly similar to sequences in genomes of the phage M102 or other S. mutans strains (38van der Ploeg J.R.

Oral Biol. 2017; 83: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The CRISPR2 cluster contains only one spacer and a degenerate second repeat suggesting that it might be nonfunctional. However, both CRISPR loci appear to be rigorously maintained in S. mutans being present in most clinical and laboratory strains (50–70%) (40Chen J. Li T. Zhou X. Cheng L. Huo Y. Zou J. Li Y. Characterization of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats sites in Streptococcus mutans isolated from early childhood caries patients.Arch. Oral Biol. 2017; 83: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Recently, the presence of both CRISPR1 and CRISPR2 loci in clinical isolates of S. mutans was also found to be correlated with thicker biofilm production (40Chen J. Li T. Zhou X. Cheng L. Huo Y.

Oral Biol. 2017; 83: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In our previous work, we demonstrated that the expression of both CRISPR systems in the S. mutans UA159 cells is differentially modulated by the two-component signal transduction system VicR/VicK (41Serbanescu M.A. Cordova M.

Bacteriol. 2015; 197: 749-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Moreover, further studies with cas deletion mutants revealed that although deletions had no effect on S. mutans acid production or tolerance, both CRISPR systems appear to contribute to the stress response, whereas the CRISPR1 system is also involved in resistance against incoming plasmids containing target sequences (40Chen J. Li T. Zhou X. Cheng L. Huo Y. Zou J. Li Y.

In the S. mutans genome, the Cas5c gene (SMU1763) is associated with the CRISPR2 locus (type I-C), which is characterized by the presence of a single spacer and several Cas genes: cas1, cas2, cas3, cas4, cas5c, cas8c, and cas7 (Fig. 1A). The purified SmuCas5c protein has been shown to be catalytically active in vitro (41Serbanescu M.A. Cordova M. Krastel K. Flick R. Beloglazova N. Latos A. Yakunin A.F. Senadheera D.B.

However, the molecular mechanisms of substrate specificity and pre-crRNA cleavage of SmuCas5c remain unknown. In addition, significant variations have been reported recently regarding the biochemical and structural properties of BhaCas5c, SpyCas5c, and XorCas5c (19Charpentier E. Richter H. van der Oost J.

To provide further insights into catalytic activities and functional diversity of the Cas5c family, we performed detailed biochemical, structural, and mutational studies on SmuCas5c. We have determined the crystal structure of SmuCas5c at a resolution of 1.7 Å and identified the catalytic triad and other active site residues using site-directed mutagenesis. Our work demonstrated that SmuCas5c is a metal-independent RNase that specifically recognizes the pre-crRNA stem–loop structure and cleaves it at the 3′-stem base. Compared with other Cas5c proteins (BhaCas5c), SmuCas5c exhibits significant substrate plasticity and tolerates sequence variations around the cleavage site. Most of the currently available Cas5c sequences (1635 genes; IPR010155; InterPro database) are present in bacterial genomes (1614 proteins) with only 35 Cas5c genes found in archaea and environmental metagenomes. Phylogenetic analysis of the Cas5c family revealed the presence of three major monophyletic groups: I, II, and III (Fig. 2). The largest group I contains Cas5c proteins from both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria including the biochemically characterized DvuCas5c and XorCas5c proteins from Gram-negative bacteria (Fig. 2). The Cas5c groups II and III are phylogenetically close to each other and contain sequences mostly from Gram-positive bacteria (Firmicutes and Actinobacteria), including BhaCas5c (group II), SpyCas5c (group III), and SmuCas5c (group III) (Fig. 2). Based on sequence alignment, the group I proteins include the Cas5c sequences with an insertion (23 amino acids) in the RRM domain (DvuCas5c and XorCas5c), whereas the members of groups II and III have a C-terminal extension (26–29 amino acids) (BhaCas5c, SmuCas5c, and SpyCas5c) (Fig. S1). A recent study on the cryo-EM structure of the D. vulgaris cascade revealed that the RRM domain insertion of DvuCas5c clamps around the Cas7.7 protein providing additional interactions within the cascade complex (42O'Brien R.E.

https://openalex.org/W3203481811,"Novel topological methods are introduced to protein research. The aim is to identify hot-spot sites where a bifurcation can alter the local topology of the protein backbone. Since the shape of a protein is intimately related to its biological function, a substitution that causes a bifurcation should have an enhanced capacity to change the protein’s function. The methodology applies to any protein but it is developed with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as a timely example. First, topological criteria are introduced to identify and classify potential bifurcation hot-spot sites along the protein backbone. Then, the expected outcome of asubstitution, if it occurs, is estimated for a general class of hot-spots, using a comparative analysis of the surrounding backbone segments. The analysis combines the statistics of structurally commensurate amino acid fragments in the Protein Data Bank with general stereochemical considerations. It is observed that the notorious D614G substitution of the spike protein is a good example of a bifurcation hot-spot. A number of topologically similar examples are then analyzed in detail, some of them are even better candidates for a bifurcation hot-spot than D614G. The local topology of the more recently observed N501Y substitution is also inspected, and it is found that this site is proximal to a different kind of local topology changing bifurcation."
https://openalex.org/W3204176004,"Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) causes chronic digestive dysfunction in cats, but its pathogenesis and pathophysiology are poorly understood. Untargeted metabolomics is a promising analytic methodology that can reveal novel metabolic features and biomarkers of clinical disease syndromes. The purpose of this preliminary study was to use untargeted analysis of the serum metabolome to discover novel aspects of the pathobiology of EPI in cats. Serum samples were collected from 5 cats with EPI and 8 healthy controls. The diagnosis of EPI was confirmed by measurement of subnormal serum feline trypsin-like immunoreactivity (fTLI). Untargeted quantification of serum metabolite utilized ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy. Cats with EPI had significantly increased serum quantities of long-chain fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, mevalonate pathway intermediates, and endocannabinoids compared with healthy controls. Diacylglycerols, phosphatidylethanolamines, amino acid derivatives, and microbial metabolites were significantly decreased in cats with EPI compared to healthy controls. Diacyclglycerols and amino acid metabolites were positively correlated, and sphingolipids and long-chain fatty acids were negatively correlated with serum fTLI, respectively. These results suggest that EPI in cats is associated with increased lipolysis of peripheral adipose stores, dysfunction of the mevalonate pathway, and altered amino acid metabolism. Differences in microbial metabolites indicate that feline EPI is also associated with enteric microbial dysbiosis. Targeted studies of the metabolome of cats with EPI are warranted to further elucidate the mechanisms of these metabolic derangements and their influence on the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of EPI in cats."
https://openalex.org/W3201958150,"Continuous development of the cerebral cortex from the prenatal to postnatal period depends on neurons and glial cells, both of which are generated from neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Owing to technical limitations regarding the transfer of genes into mouse brain, the mechanisms behind the long-term development of the cerebral cortex have not been well studied. Plasmid transfection into NPCs in embryonic mouse brains by in utero electroporation (IUE) is a widely used technique aimed at expressing transgenes in NPCs and their recent progeny neurons. Because the plasmids in NPCs are attenuated with each cell division, the transgene is not expressed in their descendants, including glial cells. The present study shows that an Epstein–Barr virus-based plasmid (EB-oriP plasmid) is helpful for studying long-term cerebral cortex development. The use of the EB-oriP plasmid for IUE allowed transgene expression even in the descendant progeny cells of adult mouse brains. Combining the EB-oriP plasmid with the shRNA expression cassette allowed examination of the genes of interest in the continuous development of the cerebral cortex. Furthermore, preferential transgene expression was achieved in combination with cell type-specific promoter-driven transgene expression. Meanwhile, introducing the EB-oriP plasmid twice into the same individual embryos during separate embryonic development stages suggested heterogeneity of NPCs. In summary, IUE using the EB-oriP plasmid is a novel option to study the long-term development of the cerebral cortex in mice."
https://openalex.org/W3202284329,"Background Air pollution is the largest environmental health risk in the United Kingdom, and an issue of concern amongst outdoor workers. Road transport is a major source producing the largest amount of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) and ozone (O 3 ) (as a secondary pollutant). Hundreds of vehicles enter and exit the Tidworth Camp’s main gate daily, potentially producing these pollutants. However, the air pollution exposure experienced by personnel on guard duty is unknown. This study aimed to determine and compare background NO 2 and O 3 levels experienced by personnel on guard duty. Methods Cross-sectional data was collected using a static sampling technic on randomly selected days of the week. Data analysis was done using IBM-SPSS-26 and a p -value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results The background concentration of NO 2 and O 3 pollutants were within recommended limits. There was no significant difference between mean morning and afternoon exposure levels for both pollutants. However, NO 2 and O 3 levels were significantly higher during weekdays compared to weekends (M = -0.022, SD = 0.007, t(6) = -8.672, p &lt;0.0001 and M = -0.016, SD = 0.008, t(6) = -5.040, p = 0.002 respectively). Both pollutants showed no significant differences in exposure levels when only weekdays were compared. NO 2 levels showed a weak positive correlation during weekdays ( r = 0.04) and a strong positive correlation during weekends ( r = 0.96). O 3 levels had a positive correlation on both weekdays and weekends; however, levels on Monday showed a negative correlation ( r = -0.55). Linear regression analysis showed that outside temperature was a significant predictor of O 3 levels ( p = 0.026). Conclusion Personnel on guard duty experienced higher pollution levels during weekdays compared to weekends; however, air pollution levels for both pollutants were within recommended limits. Further studies are recommended over hotter months using a personal sampling technic to measure personal air pollution exposure levels in order to minimise any health and safety risks."
https://openalex.org/W3202820426,"Lycoris species have various chromosome numbers and karyotypes, but all have a constant total number of chromosome major arms. In addition to three fundamental types, including metacentric (M-), telocentric (T-), and acrocentric (A-) chromosomes, chromosomes in various morphology and size were also observed in natural populations. Both fusion and fission translocation have been considered as main mechanisms leading to the diverse karyotypes among Lycoris species, which suggests the centromere organization playing a role in such arrangements. We detected several chromosomal structure changes in Lycoris including centric fusion, inversion, gene amplification, and segment deletion by using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probing with rDNAs. An antibody against centromere specific histone H3 (CENH3) of L . aurea (2n = 14, 8M+6T) was raised and used to obtain CENH3-associated DNA sequences of L . aurea by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) cloning method. Immunostaining with anti-CENH3 antibody could label the centromeres of M-, T-, and A-type chromosomes. Immunostaining also revealed two centromeres on one T-type chromosome and a centromere on individual mini-chromosome. Among 10,000 ChIP clones, 500 clones which showed abundant in L . aurea genome by dot-blotting analysis were FISH mapped on chromosomes to examine their cytological distribution. Five of these 500 clones could generate intense FISH signals at centromeric region on M-type but not T-type chromosomes. FISH signals of these five clones rarely appeared on A-type chromosomes. The five ChIP clones showed similarity in DNA sequences and could generate similar but not identical distribution patterns of FISH signals on individual chromosomes. Furthermore, the distinct distribution patterns of FISH signals on each chromosome generated by these five ChIP clones allow to identify individual chromosome, which is considered difficult by conventional staining approaches. Our results suggest a different organization of centromeres of the three chromosome types in Lycoris species."
https://openalex.org/W3202923252,"Background and aims Oral health could potentially be a modifiable risk factor for adverse outcomes in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients transitioning from predialysis treatment to maintenance dialysis and transplantation. We aimed to study the association between an index of radiographically assessed oral health, Panoramic Tomographic Index (PTI), and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) and episodes of bacteremia and laboratory measurements during a three-year prospective follow-up in CKD stage 4–5 patients not on maintenance dialysis at baseline. Methods Altogether 190 CKD stage 4–5 patients without maintenance dialysis attended panoramic dental radiographs in the beginning of the study. The patients were followed up for three years or until death. MACEs and episodes of bacteremia were recorded during follow-up. Laboratory sampling for C-reactive protein and leukocytes was repeated tri-monthly. Results PTI was not associated with baseline laboratory parameters or C-reactive protein or leukocytes examined as repeated measures through the 3-year follow-up. During follow-up, 22 patients had at least one episode of bacteremia, but only 2 of the bacteremias were considered to be of oral origin. PTI was not associated with incident bacteremia during follow-up. Thirty-six patients died during follow-up including 17 patients due to cardiovascular causes. During follow-up 42 patients were observed with a MACE. PTI was independently associated with all-cause (HR 1.074 95% CI 1.029–1.122, p = 0.001) and cardiovascular (HR 1.105, 95% CI 1.057–1.157, p&lt;0.0001) mortality, as well as, incident MACEs (HR 1.071 95% CI 1.031–1.113, p = 0.0004) in the multivariable Cox models adjusted for age and kidney transplantation or CKD treatment modality during follow-up. Conclusions Radiographically assessed dental health is independently associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and MACEs but not with the incidence of bacteremia in CKD stage 4–5 patients transitioning to maintenance dialysis and renal transplantation during follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W3203609741,"This study surveyed visitor perceptions of the resources of the Guanwu National Forest Recreation Area (GNFRA) in Taiwan’, their perceptions toward the ecosystem service functions of the GNFRA, their expectations and opinions on its management, and their recreational activities. Independent sample t-tests and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to examine the influences of the backgrounds of respondents on their perceptions toward the ecosystem service functions of the GNFRA. The importance-performance analysis (IPA) method was used to explore evaluations by tourists on the management of the GNRFA. Finally, a global positioning system (GPS) was used to process records of recreational activities by tourists within the GNFRA to understand the movement of tourists during their recreational activities within the GNRFA. The results showed that visitors to the GNRFA regarded its recreational resources to be valuable and that they had a high willingness to revisit. The visitors also showed a certain understanding of the ecosystem services provided by the forest ecosystem. There were significant differences in perceptions of ecosystem services among visitors of different backgrounds. In addition, the results of IPA showed the “importance” of perceptions and “performance” within the opinions of tourists on the management of the forest recreation area. The records of recreational activities by tourists showed that they experienced the most benefits when experiencing picturesque scenery along walking trails. The results of this study can contribute to future management of the GNRFA."
https://openalex.org/W3204749874,"The bone marrow is a frequent location of primary relapse after conventional cytotoxic drug treatment of human B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). Because stromal cells have a major role in promoting chemotherapy resistance, they should be included to more realistically model in vitro drug treatment. Here we validated a novel application of the xCELLigence system as a continuous co-culture to assess long-term effects of drug treatment on BCP-ALL cells. We found that bone marrow OP9 stromal cells adhere to the electrodes but are progressively displaced by dividing patient-derived BCP-ALL cells, resulting in reduction of impedance over time. Death of BCP-ALL cells due to drug treatment results in re-adherence of the stromal cells to the electrodes, increasing impedance. Importantly, vincristine inhibited proliferation of sensitive BCP-ALL cells in a dose-dependent manner, correlating with increased impedance. This system was able to discriminate sensitivity of two relapsed Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) positive ALLs to four different targeted kinase inhibitors. Moreover, differences in sensitivity of two CRLF2-drivenBCP-ALL cell lines to ruxolitinib were also seen. These results show that impedance can be used as a novel approach to monitor drug treatment and sensitivity of primary BCP-ALL cells in the presence of protective microenvironmental cells."
