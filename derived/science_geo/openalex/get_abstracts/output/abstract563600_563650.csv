https://openalex.org/W2464880876,"To provide a detailed analysis of the molecular components and underlying mechanisms associated with ovarian cancer, we performed a comprehensive mass-spectrometry-based proteomic characterization of 174 ovarian tumors previously analyzed by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), of which 169 were high-grade serous carcinomas (HGSCs). Integrating our proteomic measurements with the genomic data yielded a number of insights into disease, such as how different copy-number alternations influence the proteome, the proteins associated with chromosomal instability, the sets of signaling pathways that diverse genome rearrangements converge on, and the ones most associated with short overall survival. Specific protein acetylations associated with homologous recombination deficiency suggest a potential means for stratifying patients for therapy. In addition to providing a valuable resource, these findings provide a view of how the somatic genome drives the cancer proteome and associations between protein and post-translational modification levels and clinical outcomes in HGSC.

https://openalex.org/W2462790599,"Proliferating cells must cross a point of no return before they replicate their DNA and divide. This commitment decision plays a fundamental role in cancer and degenerative diseases and has been proposed to be mediated by phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb) protein. Here, we show that inactivation of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC(Cdh1)) has the necessary characteristics to be the point of no return for cell-cycle entry. Our study shows that APC(Cdh1) inactivation is a rapid, bistable switch initiated shortly before the start of DNA replication by cyclin E/Cdk2 and made irreversible by Emi1. Exposure to stress between Rb phosphorylation and APC(Cdh1) inactivation, but not after APC(Cdh1) inactivation, reverted cells to a mitogen-sensitive quiescent state, from which they can later re-enter the cell cycle. Thus, APC(Cdh1) inactivation is the commitment point when cells lose the ability to return to quiescence and decide to progress through the cell cycle."

Intriguingly, TM4SF1 couples the collagen receptor tyrosine kinase DDR1 to the cortical adaptor syntenin 2 and, hence, to PKCα. The latter kinase phosphorylates and activates JAK2, leading to the activation of STAT3. This non-canonical mechanism of signaling induces the expression of SOX2 and NANOG; sustains the manifestation of cancer stem cell traits; and drives metastatic reactivation in the lung, bone, and brain. Bioinformatic analyses and pathological studies corroborate the clinical relevance of these findings.

Bioinformatic analyses and pathological studies corroborate the clinical relevance of these findings. We conclude that non-canonical DDR1 signaling enables breast cancer cells to exploit the ubiquitous interstitial matrix component collagen I to undergo metastatic reactivation in multiple target organs. Experiments in mouse models and analysis of clinical data suggest that disseminated breast cancer cells enter into a protracted state of proliferative dormancy before undergoing reactivation and causing metastatic relapse (Aguirre-Ghiso, 2007Aguirre-Ghiso J.A. Models, mechanisms and clinical evidence for cancer dormancy.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 834-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). In spite of their clinical relevance, tumor dormancy and reactivation remain poorly understood. Notably, it is unclear if they are mediated by core signaling pathways and transcriptional circuits that operate in multiple target organs. The metastasis-initiating cells enter into dormancy and eventually undergo reactivation in response to niche signals that are part of the extracellular matrix, embedded in it, or exposed on the surface of adjacent stromal or epithelial cells (Giancotti, 2013Giancotti F.G. Mechanisms governing metastatic dormancy and reactivation.Cell. 2013; 155: 750-764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Dormancy-inducing signals include bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), which is produced by lung-resident cells and suppresses the self-renewal capability of breast cancer cells that have infiltrated this organ. Tumor cells eventually avert BMP4 inhibition by producing the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) ligand inhibitor Coco, which reinstates their proliferative capacity (Gao et al., 2012Gao H. Chakraborty G. Lee-Lim A.P. Mo Q. Decker M. Vonica A. Shen R. Brogi E. Brivanlou A.H. Giancotti F.G. The BMP inhibitor Coco reactivates breast cancer cells at lung metastatic sites.Cell. 2012; 150: 764-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Similarly, BMP7 and TGF-β2 have been implicated in dormancy of prostate and squamous cell carcinoma, respectively (Bragado et al., 2013Bragado P. Estrada Y. Parikh F. Krause S. Capobianco C. Farina H.G. Schewe D.M. Aguirre-Ghiso J.A. TGF-β2 dictates disseminated tumour cell fate in target organs through TGF-β-RIII and p38α/β signalling.Nat.

Stimulatory and inhibitory signals can be physically segregated along the abluminal surface of blood vessels, as mature endothelial cells produce thrombospondin, which induces dormancy, whereas angiogenic endothelial cells produce periostin, tenascin C, versican, and TGF-β, which promote metastatic outgrowth (Ghajar et al., 2013Ghajar C.M. Peinado H. Mori H. Matei I.R. Evason K.J. Brazier H. Almeida D. Koller A. Hajjar K.A. Stainier D.Y. et al.The perivascular niche regulates breast tumour dormancy.Nat. Cell Biol. 2013; 15: 807-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). As most of the reactivation signals have been studied in models of breast cancer metastasis to lung, it remains unclear if they can function across organ sites. We recently developed mouse genetic screens that enable the isolation of genetic entities involved in breast cancer reactivation (Gao et al., 2014Gao H. Chakraborty G. Lee-Lim A.P. Mavrakis K.J. Wendel H.G. Giancotti F.G. Forward genetic screens in mice uncover mediators and suppressors of metastatic reactivation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 16532-16537Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the top hit from one such screen, the tetraspanin TM4SF1, promotes reactivation in multiple organs and elucidate the underlying mechanism. Tail-vein injection of dormant 4TO7 cells transduced with cDNA libraries from metastatic 4T1 cells enabled the isolation of lung metastatic derivatives (Figure S1A) (Gao et al., 2012Gao H. Chakraborty G. Lee-Lim A.P. Mo Q. Decker M. Vonica A. Shen R. Brogi E. Brivanlou A.H. Giancotti F.G. The BMP inhibitor Coco reactivates breast cancer cells at lung metastatic sites.Cell. 2012; 150: 764-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding the divergent tetraspanin TM4SF1 were recovered from 44 metastases that had arisen in eight mice. 4TO7 cells re-transduced with TM4SF1 colonized the lung efficiently, corroborating the strong pro-metastatic activity of this hit (Gao et al., 2014Gao H. Chakraborty G. Lee-Lim A.P. Mavrakis K.J. Wendel H.G. Giancotti F.G. Forward genetic screens in mice uncover mediators and suppressors of metastatic reactivation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Consistent with a role for TM4SF1 in metastatic reactivation, its depletion did not reduce the number of viable tumor cells seeding the lung but suppressed their capacity to resume proliferation (Figures 1B, S1F, and S1G). To directly implicate TM4SF1 in this process, we used a doxycycline-regulated promoter to express it in 4TO7 cells, either immediately or 2 weeks after tail vein injection (Figures 1C and S1H). Whereas immediate expression of TM4SF1 induced metastatic outgrowth around day 7 post-injection, expression beginning at day 14 caused it around day 21 (Figures 1D, 1E, and S1I). Thus, a delay in induction of TM4SF1 causes a similar delay in metastatic outgrowth, directly implicating TM4SF1 in metastatic reactivation. TM4SF1 is an evolutionarily divergent tetraspanin upregulated in lung, colon, breast, and ovarian carcinomas (Hellstrom et al., 1986Hellstrom I. Beaumier P.L. Hellstrom K.E.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7397-7401PubMed Google Scholar). High levels of TM4SF1 mRNA in primary tumors correlated with reduced relapse-free survival in ER− but not ER+ patients (Figure 1F; n = 3,455), presumably because estrogen receptor (ER) signaling suppresses TM4SF1 expression in the latter (Al Saleh et al., 2011Al Saleh S.

Estrogen receptor silencing induces epithelial to mesenchymal transition in human breast cancer cells.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e20610Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, Gao et al., 2014Gao H.

USA. 2014; 111: 16532-16537Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Staining of clinically annotated tissue micro arrays (TMAs) (Table S1) indicated that high levels of expression of TM4SF1 in primary tumors correlate with reduced metastasis-free survival, suggesting that TM4SF1 promotes metastatic relapse in patients (Figures 1G and 1H). Finally, hypothesizing that TM4SF1 had a signaling function, we used its transcriptional program as a predictor of its involvement in metastasis. Consistently, we found that an 8-gene signature induced by TM4SF1 strongly predicts early relapse in unfractionated patients from a large dataset (Figures 1I, 1J, and S1J; n = 855). Multivariate analysis showed that this discrete signature is an independent predictor of poor prognosis (Table S2). These results are consistent with a role for TM4SF1 in metastatic reactivation of human breast cancer. Silencing of TM4SF1 inhibited the capacity of 4T1 and ErbB2 cells to form tumor organoids in 3D Matrigel but did not inhibit tumor cell survival, proliferation, or migration under standard culture conditions (Figures 2A, 2B , and S2A–S2D ). Moreover, inactivation of TM4SF1 reduced tumor incidence and tumor growth and prolonged latency after injection of limiting numbers of ErbB2 cells in the mammary fat pad of NSG mice (Figures 2C and 2D, left). Statistical analysis confirmed that silencing of TM4SF1 reduces the frequency of tumor-initiating cells (Table S3). Similar results were obtained in secondary transplantation experiments, in spite of the increase in tumor initiating cells and hence the outgrowth of larger tumors (Figures 2C and 2D right, note different scales; Table S3). Finally, although silencing of TM4SF1 did not affect the expression of the stem cell markers CD24, CD29, Sca1, and CD49f (Figure S2E), it almost completely suppressed the transcription of the pluripotency factors Sox2, Oct4, and Nanog (Figure 2E). These results indicate that TM4SF1 promotes the manifestation of cancer stem cell traits.Figure S2TM4SF1 Enhances Cancer Stem Cell Traits in Response to Collagen I, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Control and TM4SF1-silenced 4T1 cells were cultured in 3D Matrigel.

Error bars, mean ± SE P values of the indicating time points were derived from unpaired Student’s t test. Considering the role of specialized ECM niches in metastatic reactivation, we asked if TM4SF1 mediates outgrowth in response to a specific matrix component. Intriguingly, treatment with soluble collagen I, but not collagen IV, fibronectin, or laminin 1, greatly enhanced the capacity of ErbB2 cells to form primary and secondary tumor spheres (Figure 2F). Silencing of TM4SF1 reversed the stimulatory effect of collagen I in both cases (Figures 2G and S2F). Similar results were obtained with the MDA-MB231 cells (Figure S2G). Collagen fibers, especially if extensively crosslinked by lysil-oxidase (LOX), promote integrin-mediated activation of Rho kinase (ROCK), facilitating FAK/Src signaling (Levental et al., 2009Levental K.R. Yu H. Kass L. Lakins J.N. Egeblad M. Erler J.T. Fong S.F. Csiszar K. Giaccia A. Weninger W. et al.Matrix crosslinking forces tumor progression by enhancing integrin signaling.Cell. 2009; 139: 891-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2765) Google Scholar). However, neither inhibition of ROCK with Y-27632 nor of LOX with BAPN or a function blocking antibody suppressed tumor sphere formation in response to collagen I, suggesting that this process does not require integrin-mediated mechanotransduction (Figure 2H). Because Matrigel contains minimal amounts of collagen I, we asked if it supported the outgrowth of tumor organoids by enabling the retention of tumor-produced collagen I. Consistently, we found that several breast cancer cells produce and deposit collagen I in the pericellular matrix to levels similar or higher as compared to those of mouse embryo fibroblasts (Figure S2H). Moreover, we detected a clear rim of collagen I at the tumor-Matrigel interface in organoids grown in 3D Matrigel (Figure S2I). Finally, antibodies to human collagen I inhibited the ability of MDA-MB231 cells to form tumor spheres in the absence of exogenous collagen I, suggesting that the basal outgrowth of these spheres depends on autocrine collagen I signaling (Figure S2J). These observations suggest that TM4SF1 specifically enhances self-renewal in response to collagen I. Given the ubiquitous presence of collagen I in the interstitial matrix, we examined if TM4SF1 mediates colonization not only of the lung but also of additional organs. Depletion of TM4SF1 suppressed the capacity of ErbB2 and 4T1 cells to produce bone and brain metastases and severely reduced the ability of the bone-tropic MDA-MB231 derivatives, BoM-1833, to colonize the bone (Figures 3A–3E and S3). Quantification of the solitary tumor cells and metastases present in bone and brain sections 3 weeks after injection indicated that silencing of TM4SF1 selectively blocks the ability of solitary tumor cells to outgrow into metastases (Figure 3F). These findings indicate that TM4SF1 is required for metastatic reactivation in multiple organs.Figure S3TM4SF1 Mediates Mice and Human Breast Cancer Metastasis to Bone, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A–C) 4T1-TGL cells infected with lentiviral vectors encoding a control shRNA (sh-Co.) or two shRNAs targeting TM4SF1 (sh-TM4 #1 and #5) were inoculated in the left ventricle (3 X 105) of syngeneic mice.

TM4SF1 has diverged significantly from canonical tetraspanins during evolution, suggesting a distinctive function (Wright et al., 2000Wright M.D. Ni J. Rudy G.B. The L6 membrane proteins--a new four-transmembrane superfamily.Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1594-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Analysis of Pathway Commons pointed to a potential interaction of TM4SF1 with the collagen receptor tyrosine kinase DDR1 and the cortical scaffold syntenin 2 (Figure 4A). Consistently, Myc-TM4SF1 combined efficiently with Flag-DDR1, but not Flag-DDR2, in 293T cells lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer and endogenous TM4SF1 associated to a lower extent with endogenous DDR1 in ErbB2 cells solubilized under the same conditions (Figures 4B and S4A–S4C ). In contrast to canonical tetraspanins, recombinant TM4SF1 did not combine with endogenous αv or β1 integrins, which include all known collagen-binding heterodimers, in MCF-7 cells (Figure S4D).Figure S4TM4SF1 Combines with DDR1 to Promote Tyrosine Kinase-Independent Signaling and Metastasis, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) 293FT cells were co-transfected with Myc-TM4SF1 in combination with Flag-DDR1, Flag-DDR2, or empty vector, and immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag.

https://openalex.org/W2468896753,"Through a network of progressively maturing vesicles, the endosomal system connects the cell’s interior with extracellular space. Intriguingly, this network exhibits a bilateral architecture, comprised of a relatively immobile perinuclear vesicle “cloud” and a highly dynamic peripheral contingent. How this spatiotemporal organization is achieved and what function(s) it curates is unclear. Here, we reveal the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-located ubiquitin ligase Ring finger protein 26 (RNF26) as the global architect of the entire endosomal system, including the trans-Golgi network (TGN). To specify perinuclear vesicle coordinates, catalytically competent RNF26 recruits and ubiquitinates the scaffold p62/sequestosome 1 (p62/SQSTM1), in turn attracting ubiquitin-binding domains (UBDs) of various vesicle adaptors. Consequently, RNF26 restrains fast transport of diverse vesicles through a common molecular mechanism operating at the ER membrane, until the deubiquitinating enzyme USP15 opposes RNF26 activity to allow vesicle release into the cell’s periphery. By drawing the endosomal system’s architecture, RNF26 orchestrates endosomal maturation and trafficking of cargoes, including signaling receptors, in space and time."
https://openalex.org/W2470067239,"The HIF transcription factor promotes adaptation to hypoxia and stimulates the growth of certain cancers, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The HIFα subunit is usually prolyl-hydroxylated by EglN family members under normoxic conditions, causing its rapid degradation. We confirmed that TNBC cells secrete glutamate, which we found is both necessary and sufficient for the paracrine induction of HIF1α in such cells under normoxic conditions. Glutamate inhibits the xCT glutamate-cystine antiporter, leading to intracellular cysteine depletion. EglN1, the main HIFα prolyl-hydroxylase, undergoes oxidative self-inactivation in the absence of cysteine both in biochemical assays and in cells, resulting in HIF1α accumulation. Therefore, EglN1 senses both oxygen and cysteine."
https://openalex.org/W2465833271,"The quantitative concepts used to reason about gene regulation largely derive from bacterial studies. We show that this bacterial paradigm cannot explain the sharp expression of a canonical developmental gene in response to a regulating transcription factor (TF). In the absence of energy expenditure, with regulatory DNA at thermodynamic equilibrium, information integration across multiple TF binding sites can generate the required sharpness, but with strong constraints on the resultant ""higher-order cooperativities."" Even with such integration, there is a ""Hopfield barrier"" to sharpness; for n TF binding sites, this barrier is represented by the Hill function with the Hill coefficient n. If, however, energy is expended to maintain regulatory DNA away from thermodynamic equilibrium, as in kinetic proofreading, this barrier can be breached and greater sharpness achieved. Our approach is grounded in fundamental physics, leads to testable experimental predictions, and suggests how a quantitative paradigm for eukaryotic gene regulation can be formulated."
https://openalex.org/W2471534553,"Objective The aim of this study was to compare the effects of 5-week high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and moderate-to-vigorous intensity continuous training (MVCT) on cardiometabolic health outcomes and enjoyment of exercise in obese young women. Methods A randomized controlled experiment was conducted that involved thirty-one obese females (age range of 18–30) randomly assigned to either HIIT or MVCT five-week training programs. Participants in HIIT condition performed 20 min of repeated 8 s cycling interspersed with 12 s rest intervals, and those in MVCT condition cycled continuously for 40 min at 60–80% of peak oxygen consumption (O2peak), both for four days in a week. Outcomes such as O2peak, body composition estimated by bioimpedance analysis, blood lipids, and serum sexual hormones were measured at pre-and post-training. The scores of Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PAES) were collected during the intervention. Results After training, O2peak increased significantly for both training programs (9.1% in HIIT and 10.3% in MVCT) (p = 0.010, η2 = 0.41). Although MVCT group had a significant reduction in total body weight (TBW, −1.8%, p = 0.034), fat mass (FM, - 4.7%, p = 0.002) and percentage body fat (PBF, −2.9%, p = 0.016), there were no significant between-group differences in the change of the pre- and post-measures of these variables. The HIIT group had a higher score on PAES than the MVCT group during the intervention. For both conditions, exercise training led to a decline in resting testosterone and estradiol levels, but had no significant effect on blood lipids. Conclusion Both HIIT and MVCT are effective in improving cardiorespiratory fitness and in reducing sexual hormones in obese young women; however, HIIT is a more enjoyable and time-efficient strategy. The mild-HIIT protocol seems to be useful for at least maintaining the body weight among sedentary individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2467790803,"Fast excitatory neurotransmission in the mammalian central nervous system is largely carried out by AMPA-sensitive ionotropic glutamate receptors. Localized within the postsynaptic density of glutamatergic spines, AMPA receptors are composed of heterotetrameric receptor assemblies associated with auxiliary subunits, the most common of which are transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs). The association of TARPs with AMPA receptors modulates receptor trafficking and the kinetics of receptor gating and pharmacology. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the homomeric rat GluA2 AMPA receptor saturated with TARP γ2 subunits, which shows how the TARPs are arranged with four-fold symmetry around the ion channel domain and make extensive interactions with the M1, M2 and M4 transmembrane helices. Poised like partially opened ‘hands’ underneath the two-fold symmetric ligand-binding domain (LBD) 'clamshells', one pair of TARPs is juxtaposed near the LBD dimer interface, whereas the other pair is near the LBD dimer-dimer interface. The extracellular ‘domains’ of TARP are positioned to not only modulate LBD clamshell closure, but also affect conformational rearrangements of the LBD layer associated with receptor activation and desensitization, while the TARP transmembrane domains buttress the ion channel pore."
https://openalex.org/W2470287356,"Virtual home-based rehabilitation is an emerging area in stroke rehabilitation. Functional assessment tools are essential to monitor recovery and provide current function-based rehabilitation. We developed the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) tool using Kinect (Microsoft, USA) and validated it for hemiplegic stroke patients. Forty-one patients with hemiplegic stroke were enrolled. Thirteen of 33 items were selected for upper extremity motor FMA. One occupational therapist assessed the motor FMA while recording upper extremity motion with Kinect. FMA score was calculated using principal component analysis and artificial neural network learning from the saved motion data. The degree of jerky motion was also transformed to jerky scores. Prediction accuracy for each of the 13 items and correlations between real FMA scores and scores using Kinect were analyzed. Prediction accuracies ranged from 65% to 87% in each item and exceeded 70% for 9 items. Correlations were high for the summed score for the 13 items between real FMA scores and scores obtained using Kinect (Pearson’s correlation coefficient = 0.873, P<0.0001) and those between total upper extremity scores (66 in full score) and scores using Kinect (26 in full score) (Pearson’s correlation coefficient = 0.799, P<0.0001). Log transformed jerky scores were significantly higher in the hemiplegic side (1.81 ± 0.76) compared to non-hemiplegic side (1.21 ± 0.43) and showed significant negative correlations with Brunnstrom stage (3 to 6; Spearman correlation coefficient = -0.387, P = 0.046). FMA using Kinect is a valid way to assess upper extremity function and can provide additional results for movement quality in stroke patients. This may be useful in the setting of unsupervised home-based rehabilitation."
https://openalex.org/W2474073575,"Aging within the human hematopoietic system associates with various deficiencies and disease states, including anemia, myeloid neoplasms and reduced adaptive immune responses. Similar phenotypes are observed in mice and have been linked to alterations arising at the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) level. Such an association is, however, less established in human hematopoiesis and prompted us here to detail characteristics of the most primitive human hematopoietic compartments throughout ontogeny. In addition, we also attempted to interrogate similarities between aging human and murine hematopoiesis. Coupled to the transition from human cord blood (CB) to young and aged bone marrow (BM), we observed a gradual increase in frequency of candidate HSCs. This was accompanied by functional impairments, including decreased lymphoid output and reduced proliferative potential. Downstream of human HSCs, we observed decreasing levels of common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs), and increasing frequencies of megakaryocyte/erythrocyte progenitors (MEPs) with age, which could be linked to changes in lineage-affiliated gene expression patterns in aged human HSCs. These findings were paralleled in mice. Therefore, our data support the notion that age-related changes also in human hematopoiesis involve the HSC pool, with a prominent skewing towards the megakaryocytic/erythroid lineages, and suggests conserved mechanisms underlying aging of the blood cell system."
https://openalex.org/W2461575795,"The proper function of neural circuits requires spatially and temporally balanced development of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. However, the molecular mechanisms coordinating excitatory and inhibitory synaptogenesis remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that SRGAP2A and its human-specific paralog SRGAP2C co-regulate the development of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in cortical pyramidal neurons in vivo. SRGAP2A promotes synaptic maturation, and ultimately the synaptic accumulation of AMPA and GABAA receptors, by interacting with key components of both excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic scaffolds, Homer and Gephyrin. Furthermore, SRGAP2A limits the density of both types of synapses via its Rac1-GAP activity. SRGAP2C inhibits all identified functions of SRGAP2A, protracting the maturation and increasing the density of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Our results uncover a molecular mechanism coordinating critical features of synaptic development and suggest that human-specific duplication of SRGAP2 might have contributed to the emergence of unique traits of human neurons while preserving the excitation/inhibition balance."
https://openalex.org/W2465424457,"Cells engage numerous signaling pathways in response to oxidative stress that together repair macromolecular damage or direct the cell toward apoptosis. As a result of damage, mitochondrial or nuclear has been shown to enter the cytoplasm where it binds to DNA sensors, which in turn initiate signaling cascades. Here we report data that support a novel signaling pathway in response to oxidative stress mediated by specific guanine-rich sequences that can fold into G-quadruplex (G4DNA). In response to oxidative stress, we demonstrate that sequences capable of forming G4DNA appear at increasing levels in the cytoplasm and participate in assembly of stress granules. Identified proteins that bind to endogenous G4DNA in the cytoplasm are known to modulate mRNA translation and participate in stress granule formation. Consistent with these findings, stress granule formation is known to regulate mRNA translation during oxidative stress. We propose a signaling pathway whereby cells can rapidly respond to damage caused by oxidative stress. Guanine-rich sequences that are excised from damaged genomic are proposed to enter the cytoplasm where they can regulate translation through stress granule formation. This newly proposed role for G4DNA provides an additional molecular explanation for why such sequences are prevalent in the human genome."
https://openalex.org/W2472342174,"Homeostatic plasticity, a form of synaptic plasticity, maintains the fine balance between overall excitation and inhibition in developing and mature neuronal networks. Although the synaptic mechanisms of homeostatic plasticity are well characterized, the associated transcriptional program remains poorly understood. We show that the Kleefstra-syndrome-associated protein EHMT1 plays a critical and cell-autonomous role in synaptic scaling by responding to attenuated neuronal firing or sensory drive. Chronic activity deprivation increased the amount of neuronal dimethylated H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me2), the catalytic product of EHMT1 and an epigenetic marker for gene repression. Genetic knockdown and pharmacological blockade of EHMT1 or EHMT2 prevented the increase of H3K9me2 and synaptic scaling up. Furthermore, BDNF repression was preceded by EHMT1/2-mediated H3K9me2 deposition at the Bdnf promoter during synaptic scaling up, both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings suggest that H3K9me2-mediated changes in chromatin structure govern a repressive program that controls synaptic scaling."
https://openalex.org/W2467752068,"Background Selenium is needed by all living cells in order to ensure the optimal function of several enzyme systems. However, the selenium content in the soil in Europe is generally low. Previous reports indicate that a dietary supplement of selenium could reduce cardiovascular disease but mainly in populations in low selenium areas. The objective of this secondary analysis of a previous randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial from our group was to determine whether the effects on cardiovascular mortality of supplementation with a fixed dose of selenium and coenzyme Q10 combined during a four-year intervention were dependent on the basal level of selenium. Methods In 668 healthy elderly individuals from a municipality in Sweden, serum selenium concentration was measured. Of these, 219 individuals received daily supplementation with selenium (200 μg Se as selenized yeast) and coenzyme Q10 (200 mg) combined for four years. The remaining participants (n = 449) received either placebo (n = 222) or no treatment (n = 227). All cardiovascular mortality was registered. No participant was lost during a median follow-up of 5.2 years. Based on death certificates and autopsy results, all mortality was registered. Findings The mean serum selenium concentration among participants at baseline was low, 67.1 μg/L. Based on the distribution of selenium concentration at baseline, the supplemented group was divided into three groups; <65 μg/L, 65–85 μg/L, and >85 μg/L (45 and 90 percentiles) and the remaining participants were distributed accordingly. Among the non-treated participants, lower cardiovascular mortality was found in the high selenium group as compared with the low selenium group (13.0% vs. 24.1%; P = 0.04). In the group with the lowest selenium basal concentration, those receiving placebo or no supplementation had a mortality of 24.1%, while mortality was 12.1% in the group receiving the active substance, which was an absolute risk reduction of 12%. In the middle selenium concentration group a mortality of 14.0% in the non-treated group, and 6.0% in the actively treated group could be demonstrated; thus, there was an absolute risk reduction of 8.0%. In the group with a serum concentration of >85 μg/L, a cardiovascular mortality of 17.5% in the non-treated group, and 13.0% in the actively treated group was observed. No significant risk reduction by supplementation could thus be found in this group. Conclusions In this evaluation of healthy elderly Swedish municipality members, two important results could be reported. Firstly, a low mean serum selenium concentration, 67 μg/L, was found among the participants, and the cardiovascular mortality was higher in the subgroup with the lower selenium concentrations <65 μg/L in comparison with those having a selenium concentration >85 μg/L. Secondly, supplementation was cardio-protective in those with a low selenium concentration, ≤85 at inclusion. In those with serum selenium>85 μg/L and no apparent deficiency, there was no effect of supplementation. This is a small study, but it presents interesting data, and more research on the impact of lower selenium intake than recommended is therefore warranted.

HHV-6 DNA was analyzed and the percentage and immune-phenotype of resident endometrial Natural Killer (NK) cells, as the first line of defense towards viral infections, was evaluated in endometrial biopsies. Cytokine levels in uterine flushing samples were analyzed. HHV-6A DNA was found in 43% of endometrial biopsies from primary unexplained infertile women, but not in control women. On the contrary, HHV-6B DNA was absent in endometrial biopsies, but present in PBMCs of both cohorts. Endometrial NK cells presented a different distribution in infertile women with HHV6-A infection compared with infertile women without HHV6-A infection. Notably, we observed a lower percentage of endometrial specific CD56brightCD16- NK cells. We observed an enhanced HHV-6A-specific endometrial NK cell response in HHV-6A positive infertile women, with a marked increase in the number of endometrial NK cells activating towards HHV-6A infected cells. The analysis of uterine flushing samples showed an increase in IL-10 levels and a decrease of IFN-gamma concentrations in infertile women with HHV6-A infection. Our study indicates, for the first time, that HHV-6A infection might be an important factor in female unexplained infertility development, with a possible role in modifying endometrial NK cells immune profile and ability to sustain a successful pregnancy."

Spontaneous firing and evoked pauses in the tonically active cholinergic interneurons of the striatum.Neuroscience. 2011; 198: 27-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear how the patterns of CHI firing and time course of ACh release activate cholinergic receptors on MSNs. In the present study, G-protein-activated potassium channels (GIRK2; Kir3.2) were virally overexpressed in MSNs to provide a rapid electrophysiological readout of muscarinic receptor activation. We find that cholinergic interneurons make robust monosynaptic muscarinic connections with MSNs. Using paired CHI-MSN recordings, we show that the firing of an individual CHI is sufficient to drive a muscarinic receptor-mediated synaptic event. Despite the intrinsically slow kinetics of GPCR signaling, the rapid dynamics of these synaptic events allows the firing of individual cholinergic interneurons to be discretely encoded within MSNs as spontaneous events as opposed to tonic muscarinic receptor activation. These properties allow for reliable cholinergic transmission in response to different patterns of CHI firing. To examine how muscarinic receptors encode cholinergic interneuron firing patterns in striatal output neurons, we virally overexpressed G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ channels (GIRK2; Kir3.2) in MSNs (Marcott et al., 2014Marcott P.F. Mamaligas A.A. Ford C.P. Phasic dopamine release drives rapid activation of striatal D2-receptors.Neuron. 2014; 84: 164-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Injection of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding tdTomato and GIRK2 under a synapsin promoter into the dorsal striatum led to the co-expression of both GIRK2 and the soluble fluorophore tdTomato (Figure 1A) (Marcott et al., 2014Marcott P.F. Mamaligas A.A. Ford C.P. Phasic dopamine release drives rapid activation of striatal D2-receptors.Neuron. 2014; 84: 164-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Out of 409 tdTomato+ neurons, 366 co-expressed GIRK2 (Figures 1A and 1B). Expression was largely restricted from cholinergic neurons as limited GIRK2 immunoreactivity or tdTomato fluorescence could be detected in choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-positive neurons (4 of 71 ChAT+ co-expressed GIRK2) (Figures 1A and 1B). Weak expression of GIRK2 in CHIs was likely due to the use of a synapsin promoter as we found that other AAVs using this promoter also failed to effectively transfect CHIs (Figure S1A). As seen previously (Marcott et al., 2014Marcott P.F. Mamaligas A.A. Ford C.P. Phasic dopamine release drives rapid activation of striatal D2-receptors.Neuron. 2014; 84: 164-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), no GIRK2 immunoreactivity could be detected in control uninjected striatal slices (Figure S1B). To examine whether exogenous GIRK2 channels could couple to muscarinic receptors (mAChRs) in MSNs, we performed whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings of tdTomato+ neurons in the dorsal striatum. MSNs were identified by their low input resistance, hyperpolarized resting membrane potential, and lack of hyperpolarization-activated current (Kreitzer, 2009Kreitzer A.C. Physiology and pharmacology of striatal neurons.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 32: 127-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, Marcott et al., 2014Marcott P.F. Mamaligas A.A. Ford C.P. Phasic dopamine release drives rapid activation of striatal D2-receptors.Neuron. 2014; 84: 164-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). After allowing 21 days for expression, application of the muscarinic agonist oxotremorine M (Oxo-M) (1 μm) evoked an outward current in tdTomato+ MSNs (Figure 1C). Overexpressed GIRK2 channels couple efficiently to endogenous Gαi/o-coupled GPCRs without altering the affinity of transmitter for the receptor (Marcott et al., 2014Marcott P.F. Mamaligas A.A. Ford C.P. Phasic dopamine release drives rapid activation of striatal D2-receptors.Neuron. 2014; 84: 164-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To confirm that overexpression of GIRK2 did not change the affinity of muscarinic receptors, we varied the extent of GIRK2 expression by recording from MSNs taken 3–5 days post AAV injection. In brain slices taken from mice >21 days post-AAV injection, Oxo-M evoked larger outward currents in tdTomato+ neurons than in animals expressing GIRK for only 3–5 days (Figure 1D). Although the amplitude of Oxo-M induced outward currents were decreased under conditions of reduced expression, the EC50 of Oxo-M was unchanged (4 day expression: 431 nM, 95% confidence interval = 121–741 nM; >21 day expression 234 nM, 95% confidence interval = 118–350 nM) (Figure 1D). Iontophoresis of exogenous ACh (100 μM, 100 ms) also evoked an outward current of 285 ± 84 pA in tdTomato+ MSNs (n = 8) (Figure 1E). The current was eliminated by the mAChR antagonist scopolamine (1 μM) (2 ± 1 pA, n = 5, p < 0.05, Wilcoxon) (Figure 1E). The current-voltage relationship in response to ACh showed inward rectification and a reversal potential near the predicted K+ equilibrium potential, consistent with activation of a GIRK conductance (Figure 1F). Iontophoresis of ACh failed to evoke outward currents in control MSNs from the uninjected hemisphere (1 ± 1 pA, n = 27) (Figure 1E). Together, the results show that overexpressed GIRK2 channels couple to endogenous muscarinic receptors in MSNs without a change in the apparent affinity of receptors. To isolate cholinergic transmission through muscarinic receptors, we performed whole-cell recordings (Vh = −60 mV) from GIRK2+ MSNs in the presence of glutamate, GABA, and dopamine receptor antagonists. In the absence of stimulation, recordings revealed spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents (sIPSCs) that were abolished by the mAChR antagonists scopolamine (1 μM, n = 11, p < 0.001, Wilcoxon) or tropicamide (1 μM, n = 5, p < 0.05, Wilcoxon) (Figures 2A and 2F ). The frequency of sIPSCs was similar to the range of frequencies reported for CHI pacemaker firing in slices (Bennett and Wilson, 1999Bennett B.D. Wilson C.J. Spontaneous activity of neostriatal cholinergic interneurons in vitro.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5586-5596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Wilson et al., 1990Wilson C.J. Chang H.T. Kitai S.T. Firing patterns and synaptic potentials of identified giant aspiny interneurons in the rat neostriatum.J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 508-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While Gαq-coupled M1 mAChRs are expressed in all MSNs, Gαi/o-coupled M4 mAChRs are expressed predominantly in direct pathway MSNs (Bernard et al., 1992Bernard V. Normand E. Bloch B. Phenotypical characterization of the rat striatal neurons expressing muscarinic receptor genes.J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 3591-3600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Goldberg et al., 2012Goldberg J.A.

Coordinated expression of muscarinic receptor messenger RNAs in striatal medium spiny neurons.Neuroscience. 2001; 103: 1017-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Spontaneous IPSCs occurred in roughly half of all MSNs (96 out of 202 GIRK2+ MSNs, Figure 2B). In a subset of experiments, we expressed GIRK2 in Drd1-eYFP mice that express YFP in direct pathway, D1-receptor-containing MSNs (dMSNs). We found that sIPSCs were present in all D1-eYFP neurons tested (10 out of 10 YFP+ neurons, Figure 2B). As GIRK channels preferentially couple to Gαi/o-coupled GPCRs (Lüscher and Slesinger, 2010Lüscher C. Slesinger P.A. Emerging roles for G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels in health and disease.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), scopolamine-sensitive sIPSCs in dMSNs likely result from activation of muscarinic M4-receptors. Spontaneous IPSCs occurred with a mean frequency of 1.4 ± 0.1 Hz (2,489 events, 32 cells) (Figures 2A and 2F) and displayed an average amplitude of 40 ± 4 pA (2,865 events, 40 cells) that varied between 6 and 456 pA. As the level of AAV-driven GIRK2 expression varies among MSNs (Marcott et al., 2014Marcott P.F. Mamaligas A.A. Ford C.P. Phasic dopamine release drives rapid activation of striatal D2-receptors.Neuron. 2014; 84: 164-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the amplitude of sIPSCs was not compared across neurons. However, the amplitude of events within each MSN was normally distributed (56 ± 4 pA, n = 51 events, single cell, p > 0.05, chi-square test) (Figure 2C) and did not correlate with 10%–90% rise time (70 ± 1 ms, n = 51 events, single cell, r2 = 0.03, p = 0.21, Pearson’s correlation) (Figure 2D). These results suggest that the rate of mAChR activation underlying sIPSCs is independent of the amount of ACh released. To examine the mechanism underlying sIPSCs, we recorded events in tetrodotoxin (TTX, 200 nM). Application of TTX abolished sIPSCs (n = 5, p < 0.05, Wilcoxon), indicating that events were action potential dependent (Figures 2E and 2F). In the presence of TTX, it was not possible to resolve individual miniature IPSCs above the baseline noise. Limiting Ca2+ entry by using ACSF without added Ca2+ (n = 5, p < 0.05, Wilcoxon), disrupting the vesicular ACh transporter with vesamicol (2 μM, n = 5, p < 0.05, Wilcoxon), or blocking GIRK channels with Ba2+ (200 μM, n = 5, p < 0.05, Wilcoxon) eliminated sIPSCs (Figure 2F). These results indicate that muscarinic sIPSCs resulted from the activity-dependent vesicular release of ACh. To confirm that ACh underlying sIPSCs originated from local CHIs, we selectively expressed the light-activated cation channel, channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), in CHIs by co-injecting a Cre-dependent AAV (AAV.DIO.ChR2.eYFP) into the striatum of choline acetyltransferase-IRES-Cre transgenic mice (ChAT-Cre) (Figure 2G). Photoactivation of ChR2-expressing CHIs (2 ms widefield light, 470 nm, ∼1 mW, Figure S2A) resulted in scopolamine-sensitive muscarinic IPSCs in roughly half of all GIRK2+ MSNs examined (n = 8 of 19 neurons) (Figure 2H). Optogenetically evoked IPSCs (oIPSCs) were larger in amplitude and longer in duration than sIPSCs (sIPSCs: 38 ± 6 pA, 197 ± 11 ms half width n = 8; oIPSCs: 517 ± 112 pA, 237 ± 14 ms half width, n = 8 neurons, p < 0.01 for amplitude and p < 0.05 for half width, Wilcoxon) (Figure 2I). Electrical stimulation (0.7 ms, 20–40 μA) also evoked large IPSCs that were longer than sIPSCs (302.1 ± 18.8 ms, n = 16, p < 0.05 versus sIPSC 20% width, Mann-Whitney). Thus, the synchronous activation of multiple CHI terminals led to a large increase in mAChR activation. We confirmed that CHI firing was necessary to drive muscarinic sIPSCs using the light-driven Cl− pump, halorhodopsin, expressed in cholinergic interneurons. We co-injected a Cre-dependent AAV (AAV.DiO.eNpHR3.0-eYFP) into the dorsal striatum of ChAT-Cre mice along with AAV.GIRK2 (Figure S2B). Wide-field illumination of the striatum with long pulses of green light (5 s, 530 nM) led to a silencing of CHI firing during current-clamp recordings (Figure S2C). This resulted in a pause in sIPSCs in GIRK2+ MSNs (7.6% ± 2% of control, n = 5 neurons, p < 0.01, Wilcoxon) (Figure 2K). We found that while inhibiting CHI firing with halorhodopsin eliminated sIPSCs, there was no change in the holding current (99.4% ± 0.7% of control, n = 5 neurons, p > 0.05, Wilcoxon) (Figure 2K). The lack of a standing outward current upon silencing CHI activity suggests that muscarinic receptors on MSNs encode tonic firing of CHIs as a series of phasic events rather than a sustained level of receptor activation. Synchronous activation of cholinergic interneurons drives the release of dopamine and GABA in the striatum from SNc terminals via presynaptic nicotinic receptors (Cachope et al., 2012Cachope R. Mateo Y. Mathur B.N. Irving J. Wang H.L. Morales M. Lovinger D.M. Cheer J.F.

As synchronous optogenetic activation of multiple CHIs evoked oIPSCs that were prolonged relative to sIPSCs (Figure 2I), we next performed paired recordings between cholinergic interneurons and GIRK2+ MSNs to determine whether the firing of an individual CHI was sufficient to evoke a muscarinic receptor-mediated IPSC. MSNs were voltage clamped at −60 mV, and CHIs were recorded in current-clamp configuration. CHIs were identified by their large size, lack of tdTomato fluorescence (Figure 1A), and presence of hyperpolarization activated inward current (Figure S2B). CHI-MSN pairs were separated by less than 200 μm. Approximately 70% of recorded CHIs were synaptically connected to GIRK2+ MSNs that exhibited sIPSCs (62 of 89 paired attempts). Cholinergic interneurons were hyperpolarized to just below threshold to prevent pacemaker firing. In synaptically coupled pairs, current injection (4 ms, 150–500 pA) triggered a single action potential (AP) in a CHI that was time locked to a unitary muscarinic IPSC (uIPSCs) in the postsynaptic MSN (Figures 3A and 3B ). Action potentials reliably evoked uIPSCs, as no failures were apparent in 560 events from 24 pairs (Figure 3C). CHI-triggered uIPSCs activated following a lag of 39 ± 1 ms (time to 10%, n = 532 events, 24 pairs; 10%–90% rise time: 76 ± 1 ms, n = 537 events, 24 pairs) (Figure 3B). The latency to activation is similar to that seen in isolated systems where saturating concentrations of agonist have been applied to evoke GPCR-mediated GIRK currents (Courtney and Ford, 2014Courtney N.A.

Williams J.T. The time course of dopamine transmission in the ventral tegmental area.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 13344-13352Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Paired uIPSCs were abolished in the presence of scopolamine (1 μM) (control: 42.4 ± 19 pA, scopolamine: 3.4 ± 1 pA, n = 6 pairs, p < 0.05, Wilcoxon) (Figure 3D). Subthreshold depolarizations of CHIs did not evoke IPSCs. Together, the results indicate that individual CHIs make monosynaptic connections with MSNs and that, after release, muscarinic receptors are exposed to a high concentration of ACh. In a subset of experiments, we made paired recordings in the absence of GABA and glutamate receptor antagonists. Unitary IPSCs were unaffected by blocking GABA or glutamate receptors (uIPSC amplitude with antagonists: 111 ± 6% of control, n = 4 pairs, p > 0.05, Wilcoxon) (Figures S3A and S3B). In addition, in the absence of antagonists, no paired GABA or glutamate synaptic events were observed from CHIs to MSNs (Figure S3A). This was in contrast to the fast inward synaptic current that was seen in MSNs following synchronous photo-activation of multiple CHIs via ChR2 (Figure S3C). This confirms that synchronous CHI activation is required to evoke the disynaptic release of GABA from dopamine terminals and GABAergic interneurons (English et al., 2011English D.F.

We administered the MMAS-U to consecutively selected hypertensive adults and used principal factor analysis and Cronbach's alpha to determine its validity and internal consistency respectively. Then we randomly selected one-sixth of participants for a 2-week test-retest telephone interview. Lastly, we used ordinal logistic regression modeling to explore factors associated with levels of medication adherence.Of the 329 participants, 228 (69%) were females, median age of 55 years [Interquartile range (IQR) (46-66)], and median duration of hypertension of 4 years [IQR (2-8)]. The adherence levels were low (MMAS-U score ≤ 5) in 85%, moderate (MMAS-U score 6-7) in 12% and high (MMAS-U score ≥8) in 3%. The factor analysis of construct validity was good (overall Kaiser's measure of sampling adequacy for residuals of 0.72) and identified unidimensionality of MMAS-U. The internal consistency of MMAS-U was moderate (Cronbach α = 0.65), and test-retest reliability was low (weighted kappa = 0.36; 95% CI -0.01, 0.73).

Higher macrophage signature in the ALStwinwas also shownby RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Moreover, the twins differed in the methylome at loci near several genes, including EGFR and TNFRSF11A, and in the pathways related to the tretinoin and H3K27me3 markers. We also tested cytokine production by PBMCs. The ALS twin's PBMCs spontaneously produced IL-6 and TNF-α, whereas PBMCs of the healthy twin produced these cytokines only when stimulated by superoxide dismutase (SOD)-1. These results and flow cytometric detection of CD45 and CD127 suggest the presence of memory T cells in both twins, but effector T cells only in the ALS twin. The ALS twin's PBMC supernatants, but not the healthy twin's, were toxic to rat cortical neurons, and this toxicity was strongly inhibited by an IL-6 receptor antibody (tocilizumab) and less well by TNF-α and IL-1β antibodies. The putative neurotoxicity of IL-6 and TNF-α is in agreement with a high expression of these cytokines on infiltrating macrophages in the ALS spinal cord.

The highly conserved Hippo pathway, originally identified in Drosophila, is attracting intense interest as a key regulator of organ size, tissue regeneration, tumorigenesis, and GPCR signaling (7Yu F.-X. Guan K.-L. The Hippo pathway: regulators and regulations.Genes. Dev. 2013; 27: 355-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Canonical Hippo signals in vertebrate cells are transduced through a core serine/threonine kinase cascade wherein Mst1/2 kinases, in complex with the scaffold Sav1, phosphorylate and activate Lats1/2 (large tumor suppressor 1//2), in complex with its regulatory protein MOB1/2 (8Avruch J.

Biol. 2012; 23: 770-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In addition to Mst1/2, Hppy/MAP4Ks were recently identified as alternative kinases that phosphorylate Lats1/2 (9Zheng Y. Wang W.

In turn, Lats1/2 phosphorylates the transcriptional co-activators Yes-associated protein (YAP) and WW-domain-containing transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), two major downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway. The intracellular distribution of YAP and TAZ is highly dynamic, exhibiting rapid nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling. The phosphorylation of YAP and TAZ by Lats1/2 is widely thought to restrict their activity, cellular localization, and stability. In the absence of phosphorylation, YAP localizes to the nucleus where it binds and activates the TEA domain DNA-binding transcription factors thereby stimulating the expression of proliferative and anti-apoptotic genes. Several studies indicate that YAP acts as a context-specific oncogene (11Moroishi T. Hansen C.G. Guan K.-L. The emerging roles of YAP and TAZ in cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2015; 15: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar) and that the Hippo pathway inhibits its activity. Despite intense interest in this novel pathway, many important questions relating to its function remain unanswered as follows: 1) the mechanism(s) by which upstream signals feed into the Hippo cascade remain incompletely defined; 2) YAP not only acts as a transcriptional co-activator in the nucleus but also mediates biological functions in other cellular locations, including the cytoplasm (12Chen C.-L.

Even at the most fundamental level, the precise role of YAP in intestinal epithelial cell proliferation remains incompletely understood, as evidence for both growth-stimulatory and growth-suppressive roles of YAP/TAZ has been presented 14Barry E.R.

Collectively, these results support the notion that PKD1 signaling is a novel element in the pathway leading to proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo. The mechanisms downstream of PKD1, however, remain to be elucidated, and in particular, cross-talk between PKD and YAP has not been identified either in intestinal epithelial cells or in any other cell type. The results presented here identify a novel temporal pattern of nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of endogenous YAP in response to GPCR stimulation in intestinal epithelial cells. Specifically, we show that GPCR activation elicits a rapid but transient YAP phosphorylation and localization to the cytoplasm followed by a second phase involving YAP re-localization to the nucleus and stimulation of YAP/TEAD-regulated genes. Further studies demonstrate, for the first time, cross-talk between PKD and Lats/YAP/TEAD signaling pathways. Based on the results presented here, we conclude that the PKD family controls the localization, phosphorylation, and transcriptional co-activator activity of YAP in intestinal epithelial cells. In turn, YAP is necessary for the stimulation of the proliferative response of intestinal epithelial cells to GPCR agonists that act via PKD. Collectively, our results identify, for the first time, a novel cross-talk between YAP and PKD signaling pathways leading to biphasic regulation of YAP in intestinal epithelial cells. To examine the regulation of YAP cellular localization, phosphorylation, and activity in intestinal epithelial cells, we used the non-transformed IEC-18 and IEC-6 cells (41Quaroni A. Wands J.

For research the influence of wind speed and rainfall—separately as well as together—on the extent and degree of lodging, five levels of the severity of lodging were defined based on a combination of the lodging area and the degree of tilting. Detailed meteorological information was studied on 52 instances of large-scale lodging that occurred from 2007 to 2014. The results showed that strong wind’s lodging accounted for 8% of the instances studied, continuous rainfall’s lodging accounted for 19% and strong winds-heavy rainfall’s accounted for 73%. The minimum instantaneous wind speed that could cause large-scale lodging was closely related to rainfall. Without rainfall, the wind speed that resulted in lodging ranging in severity from slight to severe (Level 2 to Level 5) was 14.9 m/s, 19.3 m/s, 21.5 m/s, and 26.5 m/s, respectively; when accompanied by rainfall, the wind speed that resulted in lodging of the same severity decreased linearly with the increase of rainfall. These results will be particularly useful in preventing and alleviating wheat lodging as well screening wheat varieties with good lodging resistance."

We investigated the effects of body size of adult females introduced on Thyestilla gebleri (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) larvae on their paralysis time, pre-oviposition period, oviposition period and fecundity, and the related fitness of their offspring. Results showed that small female wasps needed more time to paralyze a host and had a higher mortality rate than large female wasps. More offspring were produced by large female wasps than by small female wasps, and the percentage and body size of female offspring was not affected by maternal body size. The duration of the egg stage was not affected by foundress size, nor was that of the pupal stage, but the duration of the larval stage and generation time of small female wasps was longer than that of large females. Our findings suggest that the parasitic fitness and offspring performance are affected by maternal size, and there is need to choose reasonable body size of female wasps, to optimally utilize mass rearing and to control target pests with the lowest mortality cost."
https://openalex.org/W2473490719,"The Himalayas are a global hotspot for bird diversity with a large number of threatened species, but little is known about seasonal changes in bird communities along elevational gradients in this region. We studied the seasonality of bird diversity in six valleys of the Central Himalayas, Nepal. Using 318 plots with a 50 m radius, located from 2200 to 3800 m a.s.l., and repeated sampling during different seasons (mainly pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon), we analyzed 3642 occurrences of 178 species. Birds classified in the literature as resident were more species-rich than migratory birds (140 vs. 38 species). In all six valleys and within the studied elevation range, species richness of all birds showed a peak at mid-elevation levels of 2600 or 3000 m a.s.l. Similar patterns were found for the most species-rich feeding guilds of insectivores (96 species) and omnivores (24 species), whereas the species richness of herbivores (37 species including frugivores) increased towards higher elevations. Among these feeding guilds, only species richness of insectivores showed pronounced seasonal changes with higher species numbers during post-monsoon season. Similarly, individual bird species showed distinct spatio-temporal distribution patterns, with transitions from species dominated by elevational differences to those characterized by strong seasonal changes. In an era of climate change, the results demonstrate that individual bird species as well as feeding guilds might greatly differ in their responses to climate warming and changes in the seasonality of the precipitation regime, two aspects of climate change which should not be analyzed independently."

Methods Data and banked blood samples collected in second trimester from a subset of 537 women in the APrON (Alberta Pregnant Outcomes and Nutrition) study cohort were examined. Frozen collected plasma were assayed using LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry) to determine 25(OH)D2, 25(OH)D3, 3-epi-25(OH)D3 concentrations. Dietary data were obtained from questionnaires including a Supplement Intake Questionnaire and a 24-hour recall of the previous day’s diet. Results Participants were 87% Caucasian; mean (SD) age of 31.3 (4.3); BMI 25.8 (4.7); 58% were primiparous; 90% had education beyond high school; 80% had a family income higher than CAN $70,000/year. 25(OH)D2, 25(OH)D3, and 3-epi-25(OH)D3) were identified in all of the 537 plasma samples;3-epi-25(OH)D3 contributed 5% of the total vitamin D. The median (IQR) total 25(OH)D (D2+D3) was 92.7 (30.4) nmol/L and 20% of women had 25(OH)D concentration < 75 nmol/L. The median (IQR) reported vitamin D intake from diet and supplements was 600 (472) IU/day. There was a significant relationship between maternal reported dietary vitamin D intake (diet and supplement) and 25(OH)D and 3-epi-25(OH)D3 concentrations in an adjusted linear regression model. Conclusions We demonstrated the current RDA (600 IU/ day) may not be adequate to achieve vitamin D status >75 nmol/L in some pregnant women who are residing in higher latitudes (Calgary, 51°N) in Alberta, Canada and the current vitamin D recommendations for Canadian pregnant women need to be re-evaluated."

Thomson J.A. Pluripotent stem cell lines.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1987-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). With such a cultured pluripotent stem cell (PSC) system, it has been well established that the undifferentiated state of PSCs is governed by a network of transcription factors, including Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, Klf5, Esrrb, and Tbx3, which repress differentiation-promoting genes while activating pluripotency genes (2Iovino N. Cavalli G. Rolling ES cells down the Waddington landscape with Oct4 and Sox2.Cell. 2011; 145: 815-817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Among them, Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog are considered to be the master pluripotency factors as each of them is unique and indispensable for pluripotency and self-renewal (3He S. Nakada D. Morrison S.J. Mechanisms of stem cell self-renewal.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2009; 25: 377-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 4Wang Z. Oron E. Nelson B. Razis S. Ivanova N.

Remarkably, they can regulate their own or each other's gene transcription via combinatorial interactions, forming a positive feedback transcriptional regulatory circuit that suppresses differentiation (3He S.

Furthermore, they are at the center of a highly integrated regulatory network composed of many transcriptional and epigenetic regulators (6Rizzino A.

Oct4 (encoded by POU5F1 gene) is a member of the class 5 POU (Pit-Oct-Unc) family of transcription factors, which specifically binds to the canonical octamer motif (with consensus sequence ATGC(A/T)AAT) at target gene enhancer or promoter regions via the cooperation of two subdomains known as the POUS (for POU-specific, binding to the sequence ATGC) and POUH (for POU homeodomain, binding to the sequence (A/T)AAT) that is connected by a flexible linker (7Jerabek S. Merino F. Schöler H.R. Cojocaru V. OCT4: dynamic DNA binding pioneers stem cell pluripotency.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1839: 138-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Depending on the specific core octamer DNA sequence and its flanking sequence, POUS and POUH domains can position in different orientations relative to each other to allow Oct4 to form monomers, homodimers in PORE motif (ATTTGAAAT/GGCAAAT)- or the More PORE motif (ATGCATATGCAT)-binding configuration, or to form heterodimers with other transcription factors such as Sox2 (7Jerabek S. Merino F. Schöler H.R. Cojocaru V. OCT4: dynamic DNA binding pioneers stem cell pluripotency.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1839: 138-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Compelling evidence shows that the maintenance of the Oct4/Sox2-centered complex is of paramount importance for pluripotency, and altering the stoichiometry of cellular Oct4/Sox2 will trigger differentiation. For instance, knocking down either Oct4 or Sox2 in mouse ESCs led to their differentiation into trophectoderm-like cells, and elevating Oct4 or Sox2 protein levels in ESCs induced their differentiation into either primitive endoderm and mesoderm or most non-endoderm lineages, respectively (6Rizzino A. Review–the Sox2-Oct4 connection-critical players in a much larger interdependent network integrated at multiple levels.Stem Cells. 2013; 31: 1033-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a contrasting pattern of Oct4 versus Sox2 expression during cell fate determination was reported by Thomson et al. (8Thomson M. Liu S.J. Zou L.N. Smith Z. Meissner A. Ramanathan S. Pluripotency factors in ESCs regulate differentiation into germ layers.Cell. 2011; 145: 875-889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), who showed that Oct4 is up-regulated in cells choosing the mesendoderm fate but repressed in cells choosing the neural ectoderm fate, and Sox2 exhibited the opposite expression pattern in both cell fate choices. Thus, it is likely that during gastrulation the developing embryo has differentiation signals that continuously and asymmetrically modulate Oct4 and Sox2 protein levels, altering their binding pattern and binding targets in the genome and leading to cell fate choices. Multiple studies have established that nodal/activin A, BMP, WNT, and FGF pathways are the major signaling pathways that regulate the formation of three germ layers (9Sui L. Bouwens L. Mfopou J.K. Signaling pathways during maintenance and DE differentiation of ESCs.Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2013; 57: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, it remains unknown how these differentiation signaling pathways initiate the disruption of the Oct4/Sox2 complex and alter the expression of Oct4 and Sox2 during lineage specification. Biochemical, structural, and cellular analyses have provided substantial mechanistic insights into the Oct4/Sox2 interaction in the context of undifferentiated PSCs. It is established that in ESCs Oct4 and Sox2 can bind cooperatively to two adjacent cis-regulatory elements known as the octamer motif ATGC(A/T)AAT and the SOX-binding motif C(T/A)TTGTT, respectively (10Chen X. Xu H. Yuan P. Fang F. Huss M. Vega V.B. Wong E. Orlov Y.L. Zhang W. Jiang J. Loh Y.H. Yeo H.C. Yeo Z.X. Narang V.

Recent molecular simulations indicated that Sox2 influences the orientation and dynamics of the DNA-bound configuration of Oct4 (11Merino F. Bouvier B. Cojocaru V. Cooperative DNA recognition modulated by an interplay between protein-protein interactions and DNA-mediated allostery.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2015; 11: e1004287Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Single molecule imaging study on how Oct4 and Sox2 dynamically search for and assemble on their cognate DNA target sites gave rise to a model in which Sox2 engages with the chromatin first and primes the target site for subsequent Oct4 binding in ESCs, and Oct4 in turn helps to stabilize the Oct4/Sox2 complex at composite recognition sites (12Chen J.

This stepwise-ordered assembly at endogenous chromatin sites indicates that the Oct4/Sox2 heterodimers are unlikely to form prior to binding DNA, consistent with their DNA-dependent interaction reported in live cells (13Lam C.S. Mistri T.K. Foo Y.H. Sudhaharan T. Gan H.T. Rodda D. Lim L.H. Chou C. Robson P. Wohland T. Ahmed S.

Cell Biol. 2013; 15: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), it can be inferred that the direct interaction between Oct4 and Sox2 is mediated by the POUS α1 helix of Oct4 and the HMG α3 helix of Sox2. Depending on the Oct4/Sox2-binding motif, two models of DNA-bound Oct4/Sox2 were built (7Jerabek S. Merino F. Schöler H.R. Cojocaru V. OCT4: dynamic DNA binding pioneers stem cell pluripotency.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1839: 138-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In one configuration, the octamer motif follows right after the SOX-binding motif, and such no-gap canonical Oct4/Sox2-binding motif is present in the regulatory regions of NANOG, UTF1, FBXO15, HOXB1, etc. In the other configuration, 3 bp separate the octamer and SOX-binding motifs, and the best-studied example is the FGF4 promoter. Based on the modeling, it is evident that the contact surface area between Oct4 and Sox2 in the former configuration is larger than that in the latter one, indicating a stronger association of these two pluripotency factors when bound to the no-gap canonical Oct4/Sox2-binding motif. Although a number of key residues mediating the Oct4/Sox2 binding (most notably Oct4/Ile-158, Oct4/Gln-155, Oct4/Lys-151, Sox2/Met-102, Sox2/Arg-98, and Sox2/Lys-95) have been inferred from the above-mentioned crystal structures (7Jerabek S.

Moreover, how the Oct4/Sox2 interaction is disrupted in response to extracellular and intracellular cues during lineage-specific differentiation, and how it impacts on the target gene binding, expression, and cell fate choices are even more important but unanswered questions. In this study, by taking combinatory approaches of biochemistry, cell biology, molecular dynamics (MD), and bioinformatics analysis, we identified Oct4/Lys-156 as a key residue regulating the Oct4/Sox2 interaction in PSCs, which serves as a master switch that coordinates mesendodermal differentiation and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). To select candidate key residues mediating the Oct4/Sox2 interaction, we built the model of Oct4/Sox2/DNA from the NMR structure of the Oct1-Sox2-DNA complex (PDB code 1O4X), in which the DNA template (HOXB1) harbors a no-gap canonical Oct4/Sox2-binding motif (GTCTTTGTCATGCTAATG) (Fig. 1A). In this canonical binding mode, POUS α1 helix of Oct4 and HMG α3 helix of Sox2 form the Oct4/Sox2 interface, and Fig. 1B highlights the key residues at this interface. Based on our MD simulation results, the most significant electrostatic interaction at the Oct4/Sox2 interface was the salt bridge formed between Oct4/Lys-151 and Sox2/Asp-107 that is equivalent to the Oct1/Lys-14/Sox2/Asp-71 (whose amino acid numbering was based on the solved crystal structure) electrostatic interaction inferred from a previous study (15Williams Jr., D.C. Cai M. Clore G.M. Molecular basis for synergistic transcriptional activation by Oct1 and Sox2 revealed from the solution structure of the 42-kDa Oct1·Sox2·Hoxb1-DNA ternary transcription factor complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1449-1457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Because the alterations of electrostatic forces and local structures by multiple post-translational modifications (PTMs) at certain residues are known to critically regulate protein/protein interaction (18Hunter T. The age of crosstalk: phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and beyond.Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 730-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the key residues mediating the Oct4/Sox2 interaction may be modified during lineage specification, and therefore the same residues may have differential PTMs between PSCs and differentiated cells. To this end, we employed mass spectrometry and an in vitro PTM system (19Dan S. Kang B. Duan X. Wang Y.J. A cell-free system toward deciphering the post-translational modification barcodes of Oct4 in different cellular contexts.Biochem Biophys. Res. Commun. 2015; 456: 714-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) to determine multiple PTM profiles of the POUS domain of Oct4 derived from a pluripotent ECC line NCCIT or from the differentiated cancer cell line U87. Eight residues at the POUS were found to be differentially modified between the two cell lines, and five of them (Lys-140, Lys-144, Lys-151, Lys-154, andLys-156) were at the α1 helix that is crucial for forming the Oct4/Sox2 interaction interface (Fig. 1C). In a subsequent expanded experiment involving two PSC lines and two differentiated cell lines, residue Lys-151 was post-translationally modified in two differentiated cell lines but not in two PSCs, whereas residue Lys-156 was only modified in PSCs (Fig. 1D). Somatic mutations (particularly those cancer-associated driver mutations) identified in many protein kinases are found to correspond to sites and regions that are important for protein function and structure, such as ATP- and substrate-binding sites, conserved residues or domains, and the apolar core of the protein (20Izarzugaza J.M. Redfern O.C. Orengo C.A. Valencia A. Cancer-associated mutations are preferentially distributed in protein kinase functional sites.Proteins. 2009; 77: 892-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We therefore reasoned that somatic mutation corresponding to amino acid substitutions in Oct4 that are distributed at the Oct4/Sox2 interface may have significant structural/functional relevance in physiological or pathological settings. We searched for two somatic mutation databases and summarized the results in Fig. 2A. In the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database, 13 somatic mutations have been identified so far in the POU5F1 gene from 8651 unique samples, and three of them are located at the POUS domain. In the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, there are 23 somatic mutations of which nine are at the POUS domain (data not shown). When the two databases were combined together, two somatic mutations (K156N and F194L, Fig. 2A, marked in red) overlapped, and only K156N was located at the POUS α1 helix. Sequence alignment showed that Lys-156 is highly conserved across many species (Fig. 2B), implicating its importance for Oct4 function. Taken together, because the highly conserved Oct4/Lys-156 is located close to the Oct4/Sox2 interface (Fig. 1B), differentially modified between undifferentiated and differentiated cells (Fig. 1, C and D), and detected as a K156N somatic mutation in multiple bladder cancer specimens (Fig. 2A), we focused on this particular site in the following studies. To assess the potential role of Oct4/Lys-156, we determined the impact of substituting the Lys-156 with various mutants (K156N and K156A mutants losing positive charges and K156R mutant retaining positive charge) on Oct4/Sox2 binding in a series of in vitro assays as described previously (21Lin Y. Yang Y. Li W. Chen Q. Li J. Pan X. Zhou L. Liu C. Chen C. He J. Cao H. Yao H. Zheng L. Xu X. Xia Z. et al.Reciprocal regulation of Akt and Oct4 promotes the self-renewal and survival of embryonal carcinoma cells.Mol. Cell. 2012; 48: 627-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). First, in the electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), a biotin-labeled probe of NANOG promoter harboring the no-gap canonical Oct4/Sox2-binding motif was incubated with recombinant Sox2 mixed with either wild type recombinant Oct4 protein (Oct4-WT) or one of the recombinant Oct4 mutant proteins, and the binding of the Oct4/Sox2 heterodimer to the NANOG probe was reflected by a mobility shift of the protein-bound probes versus free probes as resolved by native PAGE. Oct4-WT alone can bind to the NANOG probe, Oct4/K156R had the same level of binding, and either Oct4/K156N or Oct4/K156A had much reduced binding (Fig. 3A, arrow 2). The putative Oct4/Sox2 probe band (Fig. 3A, arrow 1) was strong with the Sox2-Oct4-WT or Sox2-Oct4/K156R combinations, but was significantly reduced when Oct4-WT was replaced with either Oct4/K156N or Oct4/K156A, possibly as a result of reduced binding of the mutant Oct4 proteins to the NANOG probe. EMSA with the UTF1 probe gave a fairly similar result as the NANOG probe (Fig. 3B). However, it is difficult to distinguish by EMSA whether the specific mutations at Lys-156 reduced the direct binding of Oct4 with Sox2 or with the probes. To circumvent the above caveat and assess the Oct4/Sox2 binding in a more cellular-relevant context, the same NANOG probe was incubated with lysates from NCCIT cells infected with lentiviruses harboring a POU5F1 shRNA (to knock down endogenous Oct4) and one of the FLAG-POU5F1 variants (to functionally replace the endogenous Oct4) (Fig. 3, C and D), followed by pulldown of biotin-labeled probes using streptavidin beads and detection of probe-bound proteins by immunoblotting. Despite the similar total amounts of overexpressed FLAG-Oct4 variant proteins and endogenous Sox2 proteins present in the reaction system and the similar amounts of probe-bound FLAG-Oct4 proteins pulled down by streptavidin beads, there were many reduced probe-bound Sox2 proteins in the K156N or K156A group compared with the WT or K156R group (Fig. 3E), suggesting that the specific Oct4/Lys-156 mutations resulted in a dramatically diminished binding with Sox2 protein besides their reduced binding with the target genes. Accordingly, when similar levels of ectopically expressed FLAG-Oct4 variant proteins were pulled down, there were less Sox2 proteins co-precipitated with K156N or K156A compared with WT or K156R (Fig. 3F). As a functional validation, the transcription of stemness genes that are dually regulated by the Oct4/Sox2 complex was examined, which showed a dramatic decrease in NANOG and UTF1 transcripts and a slight increase in FBX15 transcripts (Fig. 3G). It should be noted that to eliminate the potential effect of the Oct4 variants on their own transcription, we used the U6 promoter and hPGK promoter (rather than endogenous POU5F1 promoter) to drive the transcription of POU5F1 variants + POU5F1 shRNA that should be independent from the feedback regulation of the expressed Oct4 proteins. To achieve similar protein level as its counterparts, we had to infect cells with higher titers of the “POU5F1-K156N + POU5F1 shRNA” lentiviruses that were reflected by a significantly higher Oct4/K156N mRNA level (shown in Fig. 3, D and G). The obvious disconnection between the high Oct4/K156N mRNA level and its low protein level (shown in Fig. 3, C and H) is a strong indication that the translated FLAG-Oct4/K156N protein may be degraded by certain mechanisms. Taken together, we concluded from the above experiments that Oct4/Lys-156 critically controls the Oct4/Sox2 interaction, and the transcription of genes dually targeted by the Oct4/Sox2 complex in PSCs. To better understand the molecular mechanism by which Oct4/Lys-156 regulates the Oct4/Sox2 interaction and how the Oct4/K156N mutant impairs such interaction, we performed 500-ns MD simulations for both wild type Oct4 and Oct4/K156N mutant in the Oct4/Sox2-HOXB1 complex. Our simulation results showed that from 100 ns onward, Lys-151 of the wild type Oct4 formed a stable salt bridge with Asp-107 of Sox2, although in the mutant complex this stable salt bridge did not form (Fig. 4, A and B). To experimentally validate the importance of this specific intermolecular salt bridge in mediating the Oct4/Sox2 interaction, we generated Oct4/K151A and Sox2/D107A recombinant proteins and evaluated their interaction in the presence of the NANOG probe using EMSA. A combination of both mutant proteins or Oct4/K151A alone greatly diminished the Oct4/Sox2 binding. However, Sox2/D107A alone only marginally reduced the binding (Fig. 4C). This indicates that Oct4/Lys-151 plays a more important role than Sox2/Asp-107 in mediating the Oct4/Sox2 interaction, and additional neighboring residues in Sox2 (e.g. Sox2/Pro-106) may also contribute to the interaction as inferred from the previous study (15Williams Jr., D.C. Cai M. Clore G.M. Molecular basis for synergistic transcriptional activation by Oct1 and Sox2 revealed from the solution structure of the 42-kDa Oct1·Sox2·Hoxb1-DNA ternary transcription factor complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1449-1457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Because Oct4/Thr-159 appeared to reside at the Oct4/Sox2 binding interface (Fig. 1B), and Oct4/T159P somatic mutation was reported in the TCGA database (Fig. 2A), we also examined the binding of recombinant Oct4/T159P protein to the Sox2 protein in the presence of the NANOG probe using EMSA. Similar to Oct4/K156N, Oct4/T159P also had dramatically reduced binding with Sox2 (Fig. 4D). Our MD simulations further showed that in the Oct4/WT-Sox2-HOXB1 complex, from around 90 ns onward, Oct4/Lys-156 formed an intramolecular salt bridge with Oct4/Asp-212 on the α4 helix, which was likely to lock the C-terminal ends of the α1 and α4 helices together (Fig. 5, A and B). In Oct4/K156N-Sox2-HOXB1 complex, however, without this stabilizing salt bridge, the C-terminal helical part of the α4 helix (from the conserved hydrophobic Trp-207 to the C-terminal end) became disentangled, and several residues turned into a new part of the linker helix. Therefore, the single mutation K156N is likely to alter the structure of the linker region of Oct4, which is known to be crucial for somatic reprogramming (16Esch D. Vahokoski J. Groves M.R. Pogenberg V. Cojocaru V. Vom Bruch H. Han D. Drexler H.C. Araúzo-Bravo M.J. Ng C.K. Jauch R. Wilmanns M. Schöler H.R. A unique Oct4 interface is crucial for reprogramming to pluripotency.Nat. Cell Biol. 2013; 15: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The impairment of the Oct4 protein stability by the K156N mutation was indicated by the root mean square fluctuation curves calculated from the last 200 ns of the MD simulation trajectory (Fig. 5A). A similar phenomenon was also observed in the MD trajectories for the Oct4/Sox2-FGF4 complex (Fig. 5B). However, when evaluating the potential effect of the Oct4 Lys-156–Asp-212 salt bridge on the Oct4/Sox2 interaction, Oct4/D212A mutant did not show significantly reduced binding with Sox2 (Fig. 5C), indicating that either Asp-212 plays a less important role than Lys-156 in maintaining the intramolecular Lys-156–Asp-212 salt bridge, and/or besides impairing the Lys-156–Asp-212 salt bridge, Oct4/K156N mutant has other effects that more significantly impact the Oct4/Sox2 interaction (such as impairing the Oct4/Lys-151/Sox2–Asp-107 intermolecular salt bridge as shown above). We searched the entire UniProt database and found that in all the 74 POU family proteins, the position corresponding to Oct4/Lys-156 is non-exceptionally occupied with positively charged residues (Lys or Arg), and the position corresponding to Oct4/Asp-212 is occupied with negatively charged residues (Asp or Glu) (data not shown), suggesting that the extremely conserved Lys/Arg-156–Asp/Glu-212 salt bridge is likely crucial for the proper structure and function of the POU family proteins. To experimentally examine the effect of K156N mutant on Oct4 protein stability, we transfected NCCIT cells with FLAG-POU5F1-WT or its variants, treated the cells with cycloheximide (CHX) to block the synthesis of new proteins for up to 12 h, and determined the protein levels of FLAG-Oct4 variants as a function of time by immunoblotting. It was evident that in NCCIT cells, overexpressed Oct4/K156N (Fig. 6A) or Oct4/K156A (Fig. 6B) proteins had a shorter half-life (<2 h) than Oct4/WT proteins (4–6 h), although Oct4/K156R had a similar half-life as Oct4/WT (Fig. 6C). However, in U87 cells, overexpressed Oct4/K156N (Fig. 6D) and Oct4/K156R (Fig. 6E) proteins had similar half-lives that were both longer than that of expressed Oct4/WT. To explore whether"

Personal shark deterrents are being marketed as the solution to mitigate the threat that sharks pose. However, the effectiveness claims of many personal deterrents are based on our knowledge of shark sensory biology rather than robust testing of the devices themselves, as most have not been subjected to independent scientific studies. Therefore, there is a clear need for thorough testing of commercially available shark deterrents to provide the public with recommendations of their effectiveness. Using a modified stereo-camera system, we quantified behavioural interactions between white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) and a baited target in the presence of a commercially available, personal electric shark deterrent (Shark Shield Freedom7™). The stereo-camera system enabled an accurate assessment of the behavioural responses of C. carcharias when encountering a non-lethal electric field many times stronger than what they would naturally experience. Upon their first observed encounter, all C. carcharias were repelled at a mean (± std. error) proximity of 131 (± 10.3) cm, which corresponded to a mean voltage gradient of 9.7 (± 0.9) V/m. With each subsequent encounter, their proximity decreased by an average of 11.6 cm, which corresponded to an increase in tolerance to the electric field by an average of 2.6 (± 0.5) V/m per encounter. Despite the increase in tolerance, sharks continued to be deterred from interacting for the duration of each trial when in the presence of an active Shark Shield™. Furthermore, the findings provide no support to the theory that electric deterrents attract sharks. The results of this study provide quantitative evidence of the effectiveness of a non-lethal electric shark deterrent, its influence on the behaviour of C. carcharias, and an accurate method for testing other shark deterrent technologies."
https://openalex.org/W2468312763,"The increased importance of in vivo diagnostics has posed new demands for imaging technologies. In that regard, there is a need for imaging molecules capable of expanding the applications of current state-of-the-art imaging in vivo diagnostics. To that end, there is a desire for new reporter molecules capable of providing strong signals, are non-toxic, and can be tailored to diagnose or monitor the progression of a number of diseases. Aequorin is a non-toxic photoprotein that can be used as a sensitive marker for bioluminescence in vivo imaging. The sensitivity of aequorin is due to the fact that bioluminescence is a rare phenomenon in nature and, therefore, it does not suffer from autofluorescence, which contributes to background emission. Emission of bioluminescence in the blue-region of the spectrum by aequorin only occurs when calcium, and its luciferin coelenterazine, are bound to the protein and trigger a biochemical reaction that results in light generation. It is this reaction that endows aequorin with unique characteristics, making it ideally suited for a number of applications in bioanalysis and imaging. Herein we report the site-specific incorporation of non-canonical or non-natural amino acids and several coelenterazine analogues, resulting in a catalog of 72 cysteine-free, aequorin variants which expand the potential applications of these photoproteins by providing several red-shifted mutants better suited to use in vivo. In vivo studies in mouse models using the transparent tissue of the eye confirmed the activity of the aequorin variants incorporating L-4-iodophehylalanine and L-4-methoxyphenylalanine after injection into the eye and topical addition of coelenterazine. The signal also remained localized within the eye. This is the first time that aequorin variants incorporating non-canonical amino acids have shown to be active in vivo and useful as reporters in bioluminescence imaging."
https://openalex.org/W2460174227,"Medulloblastoma (MB), a neuroectodermal tumor arising in the cerebellum, represents the most frequent childhood brain malignancy. Current treatments for MB combine radiation and chemotherapy and are often associated with relevant side effects; novel therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. N-(4-Hydroxyphenyl) retinamide (4-HPR, fenretinide), a synthetic analogue of all-trans retinoic acid, has emerged as a promising and well-tolerated cancer chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agent for various neoplasms, from breast cancer to neuroblastoma. Here we investigated the effects of 4-HPR on MB cell lines and identified the mechanism of action for a potential use in therapy of MB. Flow cytometry analysis was performed to evaluate 4-HPR induction of apoptosis and oxygen reactive species (ROS) production, as well as cell cycle effects. Functional analysis to determine 4-HPR ability to interfere with MB cell migration and invasion were performed. Western Blot analysis were used to investigate the crucial molecules involved in selected signaling pathways associated with apoptosis (caspase-9 and PARP-1), cell survival (ERK 1/2) and tumor progression (Wnt3a and β-catenin). We show that 4-HPR induces caspase 9-dependent cell death in DAOY and ONS-76 cells, associated with increased ROS generation, suggesting that free radical intermediates might be directly involved. We observed 4-HPR induction of cell cycle arrest in G1/S phase, inactivated β-catenin, and inhibition of MB cell migration and invasion. We also evaluated the ability of 4-HPR to target MB cancer-stem/cancer-initiating cells, using an MB spheroids model, followed by flow cytometry and quantitative real-time PCR. 4-HPR treatment reduced DAOY and ONS-76 spheroid formation, in term of number and size. Decreased expression of the surface markers CD133+ and ABCG2+ as well as Oct-4 and Sox-2 gene expression were observed on BTICs treated with 4-HPR further reducing BITIC invasive activities. Finally, we analyzed 4-HPR ability to inhibit MB tumor cell growth in vivo in nude mice. Taken together, our data suggest that 4-HPR targets both parental and MB tumor stem/initiating cell-like populations. Since 4-HPR exerts low toxicity, it could represent a valid compound in the treatment of human MB."
https://openalex.org/W2467481665,"In recent years, the “forest-specialist” pine marten Martes martes has been reported to also occur also in largely fragmented, lowland landscapes of north-western Italy. The colonization of such an apparently unsuitable area provided the opportunity for investigating pine marten ecological requirements and predicting its potential south- and eastwards expansion. We collected available pine marten occurrence data in the flood plain of the River Po (N Italy) and relate them to 11 environmental variables by developing nine Species Distribution Models. To account for inter-model variability we used average ensemble predictions (EP). EP predicted a total of 482 suitable patches (8.31% of the total study area) for the pine marten. The main factors driving pine marten occurrence in the western River Po plain were the distance from watercourses and the distance from woods. EP suggested that the pine marten may further expand in the western lowland, whilst the negligible residual wood cover of large areas in the central and eastern plain makes the habitat unsuitable for the pine marten, except for some riparian corridors and the pine wood patches bordering the Adriatic coast. Based on our results, conservation strategies should seek to preserve remnant forest patches and enhance the functional connectivity provided by riparian corridors."
https://openalex.org/W2473922003,"Background Resveratrol, a phytoalexin found in berries, peanuts, grapes, and red wine, inhibits oxidation, inflammation, and cell proliferation and collagen synthesis in multiple cell types and or animal models. It represses collagen deposition in the vasculature, heart, lung, kidney, liver, and esophagus in animal models and may have some utility as an anti-fibrotic. Recent studies have shown that increased collagen deposition and tissue stiffness in the peri-urethral area of the prostate are associated with lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) and urinary obstructive symptoms. The aim of this study was to determine whether Resveratrol might be useful to inhibit or revert TGFβ- and/or CXCL12-mediated myofibroblast phenoconversion of prostate fibroblasts in vitro, and therefore whether the use of anti-fibrotic therapeutics might be efficacious for the treatment of LUTD. Methods Primary prostate and lung tissues were explanted and fibroblast monolayers expanded in vitro. Primary and N1 immortalized prostate stromal fibroblasts, as well as primary fibroblasts cultured from a normal lung and one affected by idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) for comparison, were grown in serum–free defined media supplemented with vehicle, TGFβ or CXCL12, pre- or post-treatment with Resveratrol, and were evaluated using immunofluorescence for alpha smooth muscle actin (αSMA) and collagen I (COL1) protein expression and assessed for cell proliferation, apoptosis, and COL1 and EGR1 transcript expression. Results This study showed that low concentrations of Resveratrol (≤50 μM) had no effect on N1 or primary prostate fibroblast cell proliferation, apoptosis, or COL1 or EGR1 gene transcription but repressed and reversed myofibroblast phenoconversion. As expected, these same effects were observed for IPF lung fibroblasts though higher levels of Resveratrol (≥100uM) were required. Taken together, these data suggest that, like lung fibroblasts, prostate fibroblast to myofibroblast phenoconversion can be both repressed and reversed by Resveratrol treatment. Thus, anti-fibrotic therapeutics might be efficacious for the treatment of LUTD."
https://openalex.org/W2464452428,"Background Little is known about the expression of inhibitory molecules cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and programmed-death-1 (PD-1) on Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-specific CD4 T-cells and how their expression is impacted by TB treatment. Methods Cryopreserved PBMCs from HIV-TB co-infected and TB mono-infected patients with untreated and treated tuberculosis (TB) disease were stimulated for six hours with PPD and stained. Using polychromatic flow cytometry, we characterized the differentiation state, cytokine profile, and inhibitory molecule expression on PPD-specific CD4 T-cells. Results In our HIV-TB co-infected cohort, TB treatment increased the proportion of PPD-specific CD4 T-cells co-producing IFN-γ+IL-2+TNF-α+ and IFN-γ+IL-2+ (p = 0.0004 and p = 0.0002, respectively) while decreasing the proportion of PPD-specific CD4 T-cells co-producing IFN-γ+MIP1-β+TNF-α+ and IFN-γ+MIP1-β+. The proportion of PPD-specific CD4 T-cells expressing an effector memory phenotype decreased (63.6% vs 51.6%, p = 0.0015) while the proportion expressing a central memory phenotype increased (7.8% vs. 21.7%, p = 0.001) following TB treatment. TB treatment reduced the proportion of PPD-specific CD4 T-cells expressing CTLA-4 (72.4% vs. 44.3%, p = 0.0005) and PD-1 (34.5% vs. 29.2%, p = 0.03). Similar trends were noted in our TB mono-infected cohort. Conclusion TB treatment alters the functional profile of Mtb-specific CD4 T-cells reflecting shifts towards a less differentiated maturational profile and decreases PD-1 and CTLA-4 expression. These could serve as markers of reduced mycobacterial burden. Further study is warranted."

Hemodialysis patients have advanced atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between serum s(P)RR levels and background factors, including indices of atherosclerosis, in hemodialysis patients. Serum s(P)RR levels were measured in hemodialysis patients and clearance of s(P)RR through the membrane of the dialyzer was examined. Furthermore, relationships between serum s(P)RR levels and background factors were assessed. Serum s(P)RR levels were significantly higher in hemodialysis patients (30.4 ± 6.1 ng/ml, n = 258) than those in subjects with normal renal function (21.4 ± 6.2 ng/ml, n = 39, P < 0.0001). Clearance of s(P)RR and creatinine were 56.9 ± 33.5 and 147.6 ± 9.50 ml/min, respectively. Serum s(P)RR levels were significantly higher in those with ankle-brachial index (ABI) of < 0.9, an indicator of severe atherosclerosis, than those with ABI of ≥ 0.9 (32.2 ± 5.9 and 30.1 ± 6.2 ng/ml, respectively, P < 0.05). An association between low ABI and high serum s(P)RR levels was observed even after correction for age, history of smoking, HbA1c, and LDL-C. Serum s(P)RR levels were significantly higher in hemodialysis patients when compared with subjects with normal renal function, although s(P)RR is dialyzed to some extent, but to a lesser extent than creatinine. High serum s(P)RR levels may be associated with atherosclerosis independent of other risk factors, suggesting that serum s(P)RR could be used as a marker for atherosclerotic conditions in hemodialysis patients."
https://openalex.org/W2471343369,"Background Interest in self-care haemodialysis (HD) has increased because it improves patients’clinical and quality-of-life outcomes. Patients who undertake self-management for haemodialysis may hold illness beliefs differently to those choosing institutional care at the time of making the modality choice or moulded by their illness and dialysis treatment experience. Illness perceptions amongst predialysis patients and in those undertaking fully-assisted and self-care haemodialysis are being investigated in a combined cross-sectional and longitudinal study. Study Design The study data are derived from the BASIC-HHD study, a multicentre observational study on factors influencing home haemodialysis uptake. 535 patients were enrolled into three groups: Predialysis CKD-5 group, prevalent ‘in-centre’ HD and self-care HD groups (93% at home). We explore illness perceptions in the cross-sectional analyses of the three study groups, using the revised Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ-R). Predialysis patients’ illness beliefs were reassessed prospectively, typically between 4 and 12 months after dialysis commencement. Results Illness belief subscales are significantly different between in-centre and self-care HD groups. In a step-wise hierarchical regression analysis, after adjustment for age, education, marital status, diabetes, dialysis vintage, depression, anxiety scores, and IPQ-R subscales, personal control (p = 0.01) and illness coherence (p = 0.04) are significantly higher in the self-care HD group. In the predialysis group, no significant associations were found between illness representations and modality choices. In prospectively observed predialysis group, scores for personal control, treatment control, timeline cyclical and emotional representations reduced significantly after commencing dialysis and increased significantly for illness coherence. Conclusions Illness beliefs differ between hospital and self-care haemodialysis patients. Patient’s affect and neurocognitive ability may have an important role in determining illness beliefs. The impact of modality upon illness representations may also be significant and remains to be explored."
https://openalex.org/W2461508733,"One of the major health risks to astronauts is radiation on long-duration space missions. Space radiation from sun and galactic cosmic rays consists primarily of 85% protons, 14% helium nuclei and 1% high-energy high-charge (HZE) particles, such as oxygen (16O), carbon, silicon, and iron ions. HZE particles exhibit dense linear tracks of ionization associated with clustered DNA damage and often high relative biological effectiveness (RBE). Therefore, new knowledge of risks from HZE particle exposures must be obtained. In the present study, we investigated the acute effects of low doses of 16O irradiation on the hematopoietic system. Specifically, we exposed C57BL/6J mice to 0.1, 0.25 and 1.0 Gy whole body 16O (600 MeV/n) irradiation and examined the effects on peripheral blood (PB) cells, and bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) at two weeks after the exposure. The results showed that the numbers of white blood cells, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils and platelets were significantly decreased in PB after exposure to 1.0 Gy, but not to 0.1 or 0.25 Gy. However, both the frequency and number of HPCs and HSCs were reduced in a radiation dose-dependent manner in comparison to un-irradiated controls. Furthermore, HPCs and HSCs from irradiated mice exhibited a significant reduction in clonogenic function determined by the colony-forming and cobblestone area-forming cell assays. These acute adverse effects of 16O irradiation on HSCs coincided with an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), enhanced cell cycle entry of quiescent HSCs, and increased DNA damage. However, none of the 16O exposures induced apoptosis in HSCs. These data suggest that exposure to low doses of 16O irradiation induces acute BM injury in a dose-dependent manner primarily via increasing ROS production, cell cycling, and DNA damage in HSCs. This finding may aid in developing novel strategies in the protection of the hematopoietic system from space radiation."
https://openalex.org/W2468093457,"In early reactions of DNA mismatch repair, MutS recognizes mismatched bases and activates MutL endonuclease to incise the error-containing strand of the duplex. DNA sliding clamp is responsible for directing the MutL-dependent nicking to the newly synthesized/error-containing strand. In Bacillus subtilis MutL, the β-clamp-interacting motif (β motif) of the C-terminal domain (CTD) is essential for both in vitro direct interaction with β-clamp and in vivo repair activity. A large cluster of negatively charged residues on the B. subtilis MutL CTD prevents nonspecific DNA binding until β clamp interaction neutralizes the negative charge. We found that there are some bacterial phyla whose MutL endonucleases lack the β motif. For example, the region corresponding to the β motif is completely missing in Aquifex aeolicus MutL, and critical amino acid residues in the β motif are not conserved in Thermus thermophilus MutL. We then revealed the 1.35 A-resolution crystal structure of A. aeolicus MutL CTD, which lacks the β motif but retains the metal-binding site for the endonuclease activity. Importantly, there was no negatively charged cluster on its surface. It was confirmed that CTDs of β motif-lacking MutLs, A. aeolicus MutL and T. thermophilus MutL, efficiently incise DNA even in the absence of β-clamp and that β-clamp shows no detectable enhancing effect on their activity. In contrast, CTD of Streptococcus mutans, a β motif-containing MutL, required β-clamp for the digestion of DNA. We propose that MutL endonucleases are divided into three subfamilies on the basis of their structural features and dependence on β-clamp."
https://openalex.org/W2468817818,"It has been suggested that above-ground biomass (AGB) inventories should include tree height (H), in addition to diameter (D). As H is a difficult variable to measure, H-D models are commonly used to predict H. We tested a number of approaches for H-D modelling, including additive terms which increased the complexity of the model, and observed how differences in tree-level predictions of H propagated to plot-level AGB estimations. We were especially interested in detecting whether the choice of method can lead to bias. The compared approaches listed in the order of increasing complexity were: (B0) AGB estimations from D-only; (B1) involving also H obtained from a fixed-effects H-D model; (B2) involving also species; (B3) including also between-plot variability as random effects; and (B4) involving multilevel nested random effects for grouping plots in clusters. In light of the results, the modelling approach affected the AGB estimation significantly in some cases, although differences were negligible for some of the alternatives. The most important differences were found between including H or not in the AGB estimation. We observed that AGB predictions without H information were very sensitive to the environmental stress parameter (E), which can induce a critical bias. Regarding the H-D modelling, the most relevant effect was found when species was included as an additive term. We presented a two-step methodology, which succeeded in identifying the species for which the general H-D relation was relevant to modify. Based on the results, our final choice was the single-level mixed-effects model (B3), which accounts for the species but also for the plot random effects reflecting site-specific factors such as soil properties and degree of disturbance."
https://openalex.org/W2460277758,"Low vitamin D status has been associated with short-term (30-day) mortality in hospitalized adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Data on its prevalence in these patients are scarce, and impact on long-term prognosis is unknown. We examined the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and inadequacy and their effect on long-term mortality in hospitalized adults with CAP.Secondary follow-up analysis of data from a prospectively recruited (January 2008-January 2011) well-defined cohort of 241 hospital survivors of CAP (Norway, latitude 60°N). Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were measured within 48 hours of admission. The etiology of CAP was established in 63% of patients through extensive microbiological investigations. Mortality data were obtained from the national Cause of Death Registry. Explanatory strategy and Cox regression models were used to explore the association between vitamin D status and all-cause mortality.Median age was 66 years. Eighty-seven (36%) patients were vitamin D deficient (<30 nmol/L), 81 (34%) were inadequate (30-49 nmol/L), and 73 (30%) were sufficient (≥50 nmol/L). Seventy-two patients died over a median of 1839 days (range 1-2520 days), corresponding to cumulative 5-year survival rates of 66.2% (95% CI 56.2-76.2%), 77.0% (67.6-86.4%), and 77.8% (67.8-87.8%) for vitamin D deficient, inadequate, and sufficient patients, respectively. After adjusting for confounders (age, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, immunocompromization and season), vitamin D deficiency, but not inadequacy, was significantly associated with higher mortality compared to patients with sufficiency (HR 1.91, 95% CI 1.06-3.45; P = .031).There is a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and inadequacy among hospitalized adults with CAP. The results of this study also suggest that vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased risk of mortality way beyond the short-term in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2466293779,"Background Chronic kidney disease (CKD) alters the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic response of various drugs and increases the risk of toxicity. The data regarding the pattern and predictors of medication dosing errors is scare from the developing countries. Therefore, the present study was conducted to assess the pattern and predictors of medication dosing errors in CKD patients in a tertiary care setting in Pakistan. Methods A retrospective study design was employed and medical charts of all those CKD patients who had an eGFR ≤60ml/min/1.73m2, hospitalization ≥24 hours, and admitted in the nephrology unit during January 2013 to December 2014 were assessed. Descriptive statistics and the logistic regression analysis were done using IBM SPSS version 20. Results In total, 205 medical charts were assessed. The mean age of patients was 38.64 (±16.82) years. Overall, 1534 drugs were prescribed to CKD patients, of which, nearly 34.0% drugs required dose adjustment. Among those drugs, only 41.8% were properly adjusted, and the remaining 58.2% were unadjusted. The logistic regression analysis revealed that the medication dosing errors were significantly associated with the CKD stages, i.e. stage 4 (OR 0.054; 95% CI [0.017–0.177]; p <0.001) and stage 5 (OR 0.098; 95% CI [0.040–0.241]; p <0.001), the number of prescribed medicines ≥ 5 (OR 0.306; 95% CI [0.133–0.704]; p 0.005), and the presence of a comorbidity (OR 0.455; 95% CI [0.226–0.916]; p 0.027) such as the hypertension (OR 0.453; 95% CI [0.231–0.887]; p 0.021). Conclusions It is concluded that more than half drugs prescribed to CKD patients requiring dose adjustment were unadjusted. The predictors of medication dosing errors were the severe-to-end stages of chronic kidney disease, the presence of a comorbidity such as hypertension, and a higher number of prescribed medicines. Therefore, attention should be paid to these risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W2462280930,"Previous research indicates that work modifications can effectively enhance return to work (RTW) at an early stage of work disability. We aimed to examine how occupational physicians (OPs) reason about recommending early return to work (RTW) with work modifications. Pre-defined propositions regarding the use of work modifications in promoting early RTW were discussed in four focus groups with altogether 11 Finnish OPs. Discussions were audio recorded, and the transcribed data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Five different rationales for supporting early RTW were identified: to manage medical conditions, to enhance employee well-being, to help workplace stakeholders, to reduce costs to society, and to enhance OP’s own professional fulfillment. However, OPs identified situations and conditions in which early RTW may not be suitable. In addition, there were differences between the OPs in the interpretation of the rationales, suggesting variation in clinical practice. In conclusion, encouraging early RTW with work modifications was perceived by OPs as a meaningful task and, to a large extent, beneficial for employees and several stakeholders. However, this practice was not accepted without consideration to the RTW situation and context. If early RTW and work modifications are to be promoted, OPs should be offered education that addresses their views regarding this practice."
https://openalex.org/W2473487364,"Optimizing the morphology of bulk heterojunctions is known to significantly improve the photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells, but available quantitative imaging techniques are few and have severe limitations. We demonstrate X-ray ptychographic coherent diffractive imaging applied to all-organic blends. Specifically, the phase-separated morphology in bulk heterojunction photoactive layers for organic solar cells, prepared from a 50:50 blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and thermally treated for different annealing times is imaged to high resolution. Moreover, using a fast-scanning calorimetry chip setup, the nano-morphological changes caused by repeated thermal annealing applied to the same sample could be monitored. X-ray ptychography resolves to better than 100 nm the phase-segregated domains of electron donor and electron acceptor materials over a large field of view within the active layers. The quantitative phase contrast images further allow us to estimate the local volume fraction of PCBM across the photovoltaically active layers. The volume fraction gradient for different regions provides insight on the PCBM diffusion across the depletion zone surrounding PCBM aggregates. Phase contrast X-ray microscopy is under rapid development, and the results presented here are promising for future studies of organic-organic blends, also under in situ conditions, e.g., for monitoring the structural stability during UV-Vis irradiation."
https://openalex.org/W2469121178,"Publish/subscribe is a communication paradigm where loosely-coupled clients communicate in an asynchronous fashion. Publish/subscribe supports the flexible development of large-scale, event-driven and ubiquitous systems. Publish/subscribe is prevalent in a number of application domains such as social networking, distributed business processes and real-time mission-critical systems. Many publish/subscribe applications are sensitive to message loss and violation of privacy. To overcome such issues, we propose a novel method of using secret sharing and replication techniques. This is to reliably and confidentially deliver decryption keys along with encrypted publications even under the presence of several Byzantine brokers across publish/subscribe overlay networks. We also propose a framework for dynamically and strategically allocating broker replicas based on flexibly definable criteria for reliability and performance. Moreover, a thorough evaluation is done through a case study on social networks using the real trace of interactions among Facebook users."
https://openalex.org/W2475104644,"We describe a physics-based data compression method inspired by the photonic time stretch wherein information-rich portions of the data are dilated in a process that emulates the effect of group velocity dispersion on temporal signals. With this coding operation, the data can be downsampled at a lower rate than without it. In contrast to previous implementation of the warped stretch compression, here the decoding can be performed without the need of phase recovery. We present rate-distortion analysis and show improvement in PSNR compared to compression via uniform downsampling."
https://openalex.org/W2465919628,"Previous research has identified a set of core factors that influence moral judgments. The present study addresses the interplay between moral judgments and four factors: (a) incidental affects, (b) sociocultural context, (c) type of dilemma, and (d) participant's sex. We asked participants in two different countries (Colombia and Spain) to judge the acceptability of actions in response to personal and impersonal moral dilemmas. Before each dilemma an affective prime (erotic, pleasant or neutral pictures) was presented suboptimally. Our results show that: a) relative to neutral priming, erotic primes increase the acceptance of harm for a greater good (i.e., more utilitarian judgments), b) relative to Colombians, Spanish participants rated causing harm as less acceptable, c) relative to impersonal dilemmas, personal dilemmas reduced the acceptance of harm, and d) relative to men, women were less likely to consider harm acceptable. Our results are congruent with findings showing that sex is a crucial factor in moral cognition, and they extend previous research by showing the interaction between culture and incidental factors in the making of moral judgments."
https://openalex.org/W2471726907,"Non-protein coding RNA (npcRNA) is a functional RNA molecule that is not translated into a protein. Bacterial npcRNAs are structurally diversified molecules, typically 50-200 nucleotides in length. They play a crucial physiological role in cellular networking, including stress responses, replication and bacterial virulence. In this study, by using an identified npcRNA gene (Sau-02) in Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), we identified the Gram-positive bacteria S. aureus. A Sau-02-mediated monoplex Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay was designed that displayed high sensitivity and specificity. Fourteen different bacteria and 18 S. aureus strains were tested, and the results showed that the Sau-02 gene is specific to S. aureus. The detection limit was tested against genomic DNA from MRSA and was found to be ~10 genome copies. Further, the detection was extended to whole-cell MRSA detection, and we reached the detection limit with two bacteria. The monoplex PCR assay demonstrated in this study is a novel detection method that can replicate other npcRNA-mediated detection assays."

https://openalex.org/W2465584911,"Intermittent hepatic inflow occlusion (IHIO) is associated with acute hyperglycemia during living donor hepatectomy when the ischemia is prolonged. Bilirubin is a potent antioxidant to play an important role for maintaining insulin sensitivity and preventing hyperglycemia. Thus, we aimed to test whether serum bilirubin level is associated with prolonged IHIO-induced intraoperative hyperglycemia.Seventy-five living liver donors who underwent a prolonged IHIO with a >30 minute cumulative ischemia were included. The association between preoperative serum bilirubin concentrations and the risk of intraoperative hyperglycemia (blood glucose concentration >180 mg/dl) was analyzed using binary logistic regression with adjusting for potential confounders including age and steatosis.The number of donors who underwent 3, 4, 5, and 6 rounds of IHIO was 41, 22, 7, and 5, respectively. Twenty-nine (35%) donors developed intraoperative hyperglycemia. Total bilirubin concentration was inversely associated with hyperglycemia risk (odds ratio [OR] 0.033, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.004-0.313, P = 0.003). There was an interaction between age and total bilirubin concentration: the effect of lower serum total bilirubin (≤0.7 mg/dl) on the development of hyperglycemia was greater in older donors (>40 years) than in younger donors (P = 0.0.028 versus P = 0.212). Both conjugated bilirubin (OR 0.001 95% CI 0.001-0.684) and unconjugated bilirubin (OR 0.011 95% CI 0.001-0.246) showed an independent association with hyperglycemia risk.Lower preoperative serum bilirubin was associated with greater risk of prolonged IHIO-induced hyperglycemia during living donor hepatectomy particularly in older donors. Thus, more meticulous glycemic management is recommended when prolonged IHIO is necessary for surgical purposes in old living donors with lower serum bilirubin levels."
