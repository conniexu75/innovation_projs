https://openalex.org/W2070964543,"Unusual cell wall structure and resistance to microbial degradation led to an investigation of resistant biopolymers in Coleochaete (Chlorophyta, class Charophyceae), a green alga on the evolutionary lineage that led to land plants. In Coleochaete that are undergoing sexual reproduction, vegetative cell walls contain material similar to lignin, a substance generally thought absent from green algae, and the zygote wall includes sporopollenin. Knowledge of chemically resistant compounds in Coleochaete may facilitate interpretation of the fossil record. Placental transfer cells in Coleochaete orbicularis and in the hornwort Anthoceros survive acetolysis and contain lignin-like compounds, implying a close relation between these taxa."
https://openalex.org/W2040194788,"The point at which a submarine canyon debouches on its associated abyssal fan is generally characterized by a drop in channel slope. Turbidity currents of the kind responsible for the genesis of the canyon and fan should display an internal hydraulic jump near the slope transition. No direct field observations of any such jump appear, however, to have been made. Experiments on the nature of the jump and the resulting sedimentary deposits indicate that the thickness of the deposits just downstream of the jump tends to increase as the ratio of bed shear velocity immediately behind the jump to particle fall velocity decreases."

These include the choice of an appropriate mathematical model, the design of shock-capturing algorithms, the treatment of complex geometric configurations, and shape modifications to optimize the aerodynamic performance."
https://openalex.org/W1630159880,"Results are presented for infrared photometry of Pluto in the wavelength range from 1.2 to 2.2 microns, which includes the diagnostic absorption bands of water and methane frosts (designated as H1 and H2, respectively). Based on Pluto's observed J-H color and H1/H2 reflectance ratio as well as restrictions imposed by other observational and theoretical studies, it is concluded that methane frost is probably the dominant reflecting material on the planet's surface. It is suggested that this frost may be mixed with other materials, and some variation of the frost cover is indicated. Two plausible sources for the methane on Pluto are discussed, the average geometric albedo of the planet is assumed to be 0.4, and its diameter is estimated to be 3300 km."
https://openalex.org/W3012135373,Infrared photometry (1.2 to 2.2 micrometers) of Pluto provides evidence for frozen methane on the surface of the planet. This appears to be the first observational indication of this ice in the solar system. Its presence on Pluto suggests that the planet's albedo (reflectance) may be >/= 0.4 and that its diameter may be less than that of the moon.

Similar analyses of sediment deposited during the last ice age (18,000 years before the present) indicate a maximum shallowing of the upper limit of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) of about 100 meters, coupled with an increase in velocity, which resulted in an increase in AABW transport."
https://openalex.org/W2011034698,"Molecular beam epitaxy has been used to grow microcrystalline clusters of gallium arsenide (GaAs) in the size range from 2.5 to 60 nanometers on high-purity, amorphous silica supports. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy reveals that clusters as small as 3.5 nanometers have good crystalline order with a lattice constant equal to that of bulk GaAs. Study of the microcrystallite surfaces by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows that they are covered with a shell (1.0 to 1.5 nanometers thick) of native oxides of gallium and arsenic (Ga(2)O(3) and As(2)O(3)), whose presence could explain the low luminescence efficiency of the clusters. Optical absorption spectra of the supported GaAs are consistent with the blue-shifted band edge expected for semiconductor microcrystallites in the quantum size regime."

Shadows will not resemble these flowers if the appearance of each in visible light is also considered. Examples are shown from Mexican heliotropiums and Michigan dune plants."
