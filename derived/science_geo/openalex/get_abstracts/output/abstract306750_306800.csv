https://openalex.org/W2020962802,More precise and comprehensive analytical results for lunar material in Sinus Medii have been derived from the alpha-scattering experiment on Surveyor VI. The amounts of the principal constituents at this mare are approximately the same as those of constituents at Mare Tranquillitatis. The sodium contents of both maria are lower than those of terrestrial basalts. The titanium content at Sinus Medii is lower than that at Mare Tranquillitatis; this suggests important differences in detailed chemical composition at different mare areas on the moon.
https://openalex.org/W2044643488,"Acquisition measurements of the round-trip travel time of light, from the McDonald Observatory to the Laser Ranging Retro-Reflector deployed on the moon by the Apollo 11 astronauts, were made on 20 August and on 3, 4, and 22 September 1969. The uncertainty in the round-trip travel time was +/- 15 nanoseconds, with the pulsed ruby laser and timing system used for the acquisition. The uncertainty in later measurements of a planned long-term sequence from this observatory is expected to be an order of magnitude smaller. The successful performance of the retro-reflector at several angles of solar illumination, as well as during and after a lunar night, confirms the prediction of thermal design analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2016492285,Flower formation was initiated in Lemna by acetone extracts of flowering cocklebur (Xanthium). These extracts also initiated flower formation in Xanthium when they were supplemented with gibberellic acid. No flower formation was initiated in duckweed (Lemna) or Xanthium by extracts from vegetative Xanthium. Extracts from vegetative plants supplemented with gibberellic acid did not initiate flowers in Xanthium or Lemna.

https://openalex.org/W2010554207,Removal of the petiole from detached betel leaves delays onset of leaf senescence; the delay is nearly proportional to the extent of depetiolation. An agar diffusate from intact midrib or excised petioles induces normal senescence in depetiOlated leave.
