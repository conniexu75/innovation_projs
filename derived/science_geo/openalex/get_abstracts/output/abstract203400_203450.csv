It was found that this antibiotic, as well as the related antibiotics oxytetracycline and chlorotetracycline, specifically combines with the mitochondria of living cells, either in tissue culture or in fresh preparations from various organs."

Lipolysis by intestinal enzymes was first established by Schiff (2) in studies with depancreatized dogs. Kalaboukoff and Terroine (3) later reported that glycerol extracts of intestinal mucosa hydrolyzed olive oil and that this activity was accelerated by the addition of bile salts. In this study, the lipase activity of intestinal mucosa has been examined. In order to limit the study to lipase activity, we have employed long chain triglycerides as substrate in the form of olive oil emulsions. As will be seen, the intestine also contains aliesterases, as judged by the rapid hydrolysis of short chain fatty acid esters. These enzymes would not be expected to interfere with lipase estimations, since, in other tissues such as the liver, they have been shown to be completely inactive toward long chain triglycerides. The pancreatic enzyme has generally been regarded as the prototype of lipases. We have therefore compared the intestinal and pancreatic enzymes with regard to substrate specificity and the effects of various activators and inhibitors, a number of which have been employed by other investigators to characterize esterolytic enzymes. Although the intestinal activity appears to be similar, in general, to that of the pancreas, it is clear that the enzymes involved are not identical. The possible participation of intestinal lipase in the intestinal absorption of fat is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1981504291,"The plaque titer of poliovirus ""ribonucleic acid"" on monkey kidney cells cultured in vitro is greatly increased by depleting these cells of calcium and treating the ""ribonucleic acid"" inoculum with a suspension of any one of several poorly water-soluble substances before inoculation. These undissolved substances apparently facilitate infection by serving as solid vehicles for the ""ribonucleic acid."""

A brain ganglioside containing neuraminic acid and a Pseudomonas polysaccharide were even more inhibitory. Inhibition was specific for anti-D sera."

https://openalex.org/W1997311330,Experimental elimination of mast cells from the peritoneal tissues of the rat by distilled water treatment inhibited the increase of vascular permeability which normally follows a passively induced antigen-antibody reaction in peritoneal tissue. Thus mast cells may contribute to the initiation of inflammation which follows antigen-antibody reactions.

Conflicting results concerning the flavor of irradiated foods are due largely to different methods of evaluation and to incorrect interpretation of results. Unusual flavor due to irradiation should be considered different, not necessarily objectionable."
